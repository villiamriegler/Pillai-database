2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
RotaTeq is currently indicated in the European Union for the active immunisation of infants from the 
age of 6 weeks to 26 weeks for prevention of gastroenteritis due to rotavirus infection.   
The purpose of this variation is to extend the upper age limit for the administration of the third dose of 
vaccine from 26 to 32 weeks of age. Making this change has implications for sections 4.1 and 4.2 of 
the SmPC and the MAH also proposes modifications to sections 4.8 and 5.1. The extended age range 
has implications also for section 3 of the PL. 
In support of this variation the MAH has submitted post-hoc sub-analyses of data from previously 
completed Phase III studies 006, 007 and 009. The purpose of these analyses was to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of RotaTeq in infants who received the third dose of vaccine at age > 26 to ≤ 32 
weeks. In addition, the MAH conducted sub-analyses of safety data among infants who received their 
third dose of RotaTeq when they were aged > 26 weeks to ≤ 32 weeks in the completed post 
marketing safety surveillance study 019.  No newly reported studies are included in this application.  
Prior to filing this variation the MAH submitted a Paediatric Investigation Plan (P/149/2011), which has 
been approved. The measures presented in this application were performed in line with the 
corresponding PIP Decision (P/149/2011) and a positive opinion on compliance check has been 
adopted by the PDCO (EMEA-C-000967-PIP01-10). 
2.2.  Clinical aspects  
In the pre-approval clinical studies the third dose of RotaTeq could be administered up to 32 weeks of 
age although the actual mean age of infants at the time of the last dose was approximately 26 weeks.  
Since 2006 the vaccine has been used in the United States with a recommended age range of 6 to 32 
weeks of age. As of December 2010, over 44 million doses have been distributed worldwide, of which 
approximately 36 million have been distributed in the U.S. 
RotaTeq was initially approved in the EU (June 2006) with an upper age limit of 26 weeks for the third 
dose, which reflected the mean age in Phase III prelicensure studies. This was considered necessary to 
avoid administration of the last dose during the age range for peak incidence of naturally-occurring 
intussusception, which was thought at the time of approval to be approximately 32 weeks of age in 
Europe. Since initial licensure, new information concerning the natural background incidence of 
intussusception in Denmark, Switzerland and Germany suggest that the peak occurs or at least begins 
before 26 weeks of age. This corresponds to the US peak age of naturally-occurring intussusception 
between approximately 21 to 26 weeks. 
The MAH stated in this procedure that the extension of administration of Dose 3 until 32 weeks of age 
is not expected to lead to additional safety concerns with respect to intussusception and will allow for 
improved adherence to the 3-dose regimen. For example, the 2-4-6 months primary infant 
immunisation schedule is currently in use in Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Austria, Romania, Cyprus and 
Poland and other countries with a vaccination visit at 6 months of age are Bulgaria, Czech Republic, 
Estonia, Greece,  Ireland, Latvia and Slovenia. In reality, the exact timing of administration of the third 
vaccine doses may be > 26 weeks of age. There is also a possibility that the third dose of RotaTeq 
would be missed entirely if not administered by 26 weeks of age because of circumstances such as 
intercurrent illness or scheduling difficulties. The data re-analysed in this application come from three 
pre- and one post-marketing studies, which have all been submitted and fully assessed previously:

  006 (REST)  
  007 (Vaccine at Expiry Potency)  
  009 (3 Consistency Lots) 
These were randomised, multicentre, in-house blinded placebo-controlled studies conducted 
throughout the United States, Europe, Latin America and Asia. Healthy infants aged 6 through 12 
weeks were enrolled in the studies. Subjects received 3 oral doses of RotaTeq or placebo 
administered at intervals of 4 to 10 weeks (28 to 70 days). The last dose was administered by 32 
weeks of age. 
  019 - Post-Marketing Evaluation of the Short-Term Safety of RotaTeq 
This was a prospective observational study to monitor the safety profile of RotaTeq in the post-
licensure period in a large number of subjects under conditions of routine use. The setting for this 
study was based on, a proprietary research database built from electronically captured provider, 
facility and pharmacy claims with large private health plans and large employer groups. The 
individuals covered by this health plan are geographically diverse across the United States. 
Please see previous assessment reports for full details of the study objectives, designs and results for 
the total study populations. 
2.2 Clinical Efficacy aspects  
2.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The primary objective was to evaluate efficacy against any severity of rotavirus gastro-enteritis (RVGE) 
caused by serotypes G1, G2, G3, and G4 occurring at least 14 days following the third dose in the 
subset of subjects who were aged > 26 weeks and ≤ 32 weeks upon receipt of the third dose.  
The data from 006 and 007 were combined. The combined analysis was based on the per-protocol 
population comprised of subjects enrolled who received the 3 scheduled doses of RotaTeq or placebo 
and adhered to the guidelines for administration of vaccine. Thus, all subjects who were not protocol 
violators and received dose 3 up to 32 weeks of age were included in the analyses. 
Efficacy = (1 - relative risk), where relative risk is the incidence in the vaccine group divided by the 
incidence in the placebo group. An estimate of efficacy and an associated 95% confidence interval 
were calculated. The confidence interval was based on a binomial distribution for the number of 
subjects classified as cases in the vaccine group relative to the total number of subjects classified as 
cases that is formed by conditioning on the total number of subjects classified as cases. The estimate 
and confidence limits for efficacy were then computed using the relationship efficacy = (1-(k+1)p) / 
(1-p), where p is the corresponding parameter of interest from the binomial distribution and k is the 
total amount of follow-up time in the placebo group divided by the total amount of follow-up time in 
the vaccine group.  
An observational comparison was made between the efficacy observed in the subset aged >26 and 
≤32 weeks at the time of the third dose and the efficacy estimated previously for the overall efficacy 
population.  
For the healthcare resource utilisation (HCRU) analysis of data from study 006, estimates of the rate 
reduction for the incidence of hospitalisations and ER visits and the corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals were computed, based on the exact binomial method for ratios of Poisson counts.

Protocol violators excluded from the per-protocol population included (1) subjects who missed any of 
the 3 study vaccinations (2) subjects who did not have at least 28 days between study vaccinations (3) 
subjects who received a mixed regimen of study materials (4) subjects for whom the treatment arm 
was prematurely unblinded (5) subjects for whom there was a temperature excursion among 
administered vials/tubes of RotaTeq / placebo and (6) subjects who received more than 3 doses of the 
same vaccination material. In addition, subjects were classified as unevaluable for the analysis due to 
wild-type rotavirus prior to 14 days Post-dose 3, incomplete clinical and/or laboratory results or stool 
samples collected outside of the protocol-specified day range. 
2.2.2.  Results 
Across studies 006 and 007 the numbers in the efficacy analyses who were aged > 26 and ≤ 32 weeks 
at the time of dose 3 are shown in the table. Recipients of RotaTeq and placebo were comparable with 
respect to gender, age at enrolment and race.

In the combined primary per-protocol analysis of efficacy against any severity RVGE caused by G1, G2, 
G3 and G4 (see next table) the efficacy estimate was 61.5% (14.2%, 84.2%). However, the estimates 
varied from 56.8% in 006 to 79% in 007. It should be noted that the actual numbers of cases 
underlying these estimates was relatively small and the 95% CI are very wide.  
The pooled study estimate (61.5%) was lower than the efficacy that was observed (and reported 
previously) in the overall population by study, being 74.0% (66.8%, 79.9%) in 006, 72.5% (50.6%, 
85.6%) in 007 and 73.8% (67.2%, 79.3%) in the combined studies.

The combined efficacy against severe RVGE caused by G1, G2, G3 and G4 was 100% (-150.9%, 
100%). However, in this subset analysis there were only 3 cases of severe RVGE, all of which occurred 
in the placebo group. The corresponding analysis for severe RVGE due to any virus type gave the exact 
same numbers.

The combined efficacy against any severity RVGE and regardless of serotype was 58.2% (13.0%, 
81.3%). Again, the estimate was much lower in 006 than in 007 and the total (pooled) number of 
cases was only 38 (11 RotaTeq and 27 placebo). This pooled estimate is lower than the efficacy 
observed in the overall population, being 71.8% (64.5%, 77.8%) in 006, 72.7% (51.9%, 85.4%) in 
007 and 72.0% (65.3%, 77.5%) for combined data.

All subjects in 006 were followed for 2 years post-vaccination to capture hospitalisations and ER visits 
for RVGE. The HCRU analysis of G1, G2, G3 and G4 RVGE (see next table) gave a rate reduction 
estimate of 89.4% (56.8%, 98.8%) for hospital and ER visits. This result was comparable to those 
obtained in the overall population of this study (94.5% [91.2%, 96.6%]) for hospitalisation and ER 
visits, 95.8% ([90.5%, 98.2%]) for hospitalisations and 93.7% ([88.8%, 96.5%]) for ER visits.

† The rates of events represent the incidence density and are expressed as the 
annual number of events per 1000 person years. 
The MAH’s conclusions from these analyses are as follows: 
  RotaTeq showed efficacy against any severity RVGE in subjects aged >26 to ≤32 weeks at Dose 3. 
  Based on limited data, the vaccine appeared to have positive efficacy against severe RVGE in 
subjects aged >26 to ≤32 weeks at Dose 3. 
  RotaTeq reduced the rate of hospitalisations and ER visits for RVGE in subjects aged >26 to ≤32 
weeks at Dose 3. 
 
The data support the use of the third dose of RotaTeq between 26 and 32 weeks of age. 
Analyses for the subjects aged > 26 up to 32 weeks at the time of the third dose 
The MAH was requested during the procedure to provide analyses for the subjects aged > 26 up to 32 
weeks at the time of the third dose based on all cases of RVGE regardless of the PP case definition and 
also all cases of RVGE regardless of whether or not subjects met the PP population criteria. The MAH 
was also requested to show all cases of RVGE that occurred after the second dose was administered 
and from 14 days after the second dose. 
The MAH stated that the PP approach evaluated efficacy starting from Dose 3 + 14 days and excluded 
subjects who were protocol violators. In the context of evaluating subjects who were >26 up to 32 
weeks of age at Dose 3, the relevant starting point is Dose 3 and the relevant population is all subjects 
who were vaccinated with 3 doses (and were >26 up to 32 weeks of age at Dose 3). 
Because the vast majority of protocol violations involved receipt of < 3 doses, the MAH clarified that 
"PP population" and the "relevant population regardless of PP criteria" is essentially the same. From

Dose 3 to before 14 days following Dose 3 there were no cases of RVGE in recipients of RotaTeq and 
only one case in the placebo group (Table 6). From Dose 2 to before Dose 3, there were 4 cases of 
RVGE in recipients of RotaTeq and 6 in the placebo group.  From 14 days after Dose 2 to before Dose 3, 
there were 2 cases of RVGE in recipients of RotaTeq group and 2 cases in the placebo group.

2.2.3.  Discussion on efficacy 
Across studies 006 and 007 the numbers in the efficacy analyses who were aged >26 and ≤32 weeks 
at the time of dose 3 exceeded 500 per treatment group but there were only ~60 per group in study 
007. The analyses presented focus on RVGE that occurred at least 14 days after the last dose in the PP 
population and using the PP case definition. The estimates of efficacy against RVGE due to vaccine 
types and any rotavirus types both showed a difference between the two studies such that efficacy was 
higher in 007 but this was based on a very few cases and is considered to be unreliable. In 006, where 
the estimates of efficacy were based on larger numbers of cases, the point values were lower than 
reported previously for the overall population while the 95% CI were very wide and spanned zero. 
There were too few severe cases to make any comment. 
It is only the study 006 HCRU analysis that suggested that the effect of vaccination was comparable 
between the total study population and the subset of subjects who were at the upper end of the age 
range when the last dose was administered. This analysis is based on only 21 events but the 95% CI 
do support a benefit for RotaTeq use under these circumstances.  
The analyses are all based on the PP population and PP case definition.  
The results presented initially in this application were based on the subset that received the third dose 
between weeks 26 and 32, counting cases that met the PP case definition that occurred from 14 days 
after the third dose. These results showed some disadvantage for delaying the third dose as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/251107/2012 
Page 10/21
 
   
   
 
 
 
 
  Efficacy against any severity RVGE caused by G1, G2, G3 and G4 was estimated at 61.5% (14.2%, 
84.2%). However, the estimates varied from 56.8% in 006 to 79% in 007 (with very wide 95% 
CI). This pooled study estimate (61.5%) was lower than those for the overall population (74.0% in 
006, 72.5% in 007 and 73.8% in the combined studies). 
  Efficacy against any severity RVGE and regardless of serotype was 58.2%, which was much lower 
than the efficacy observed in the overall population (71.8% in 006, 72.7% in 007 and 72.0% for 
combined data). 
 
The HCRU analysis of G1, G2, G3 and G4 RVGE gave a rate reduction estimate of 89.4% (56.8%, 
98.8%) for hospital and ER visits, which was near to the estimates obtained in the overall 
population (95.8% for hospitalisations and 93.7% for ER visits). The corresponding analysis based 
on RVGE of any virus type gave the exact same figures. 
On the basis of these initial analyses it seemed that efficacy was lower when the third dose was 
delayed. 
The additional analyses that also show the numbers of cases that occurred between doses 2 and 3 
underline this concern. Overall, delaying the third dose beyond week 26 should be conveyed as the 
exception and not a routinely acceptable regimen. 
2.3.  Clinical Safety aspects  
2.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Statistical Analysis Plan - combined safety analysis of data from studies 006, 007 and 009 
The objective was to evaluate the risk of IS among recipients of RotaTeq relative to placebo within 42 
days following the third dose when this last dose was administered between 26 and 32 weeks of age. 
The primary safety endpoint was confirmed IS within 42 days following the third dose of RotaTeq or 
placebo in the subset of subjects aged > 26 to ≤ 32 weeks at the time of the last vaccination. The 
following endpoints were also summarised: 
  Confirmed IS that occurred within 7, 14 and 60 days Post-dose 3  
  Adverse experiences of special clinical interest: diarrhoea, elevated temperatures, irritability and 
vomiting that occurred within 7 days Post-dose 3  
  Adverse experience of haematochezia that occurred within 42 days Post-dose 3 
The safety data across studies 006, 007 and 009 were combined. The relative risk of IS was the 
incidence in the vaccine group divided by the incidence in the placebo group. An estimate of relative 
risk and associated 95% confidence interval was calculated. The confidence interval was based on a 
binomial distribution for the number of subjects with IS in the vaccine group relative to the total 
number of subjects with intussusception, formed by conditioning on the total number of subjects with 
intussusception.  The confidence limits for relative risk were then computed based on the relationship 
relative risk = p/(1-p), where p was the corresponding parameter of interest from the binomial 
distribution. 
For the analysis of the other AEs, risk differences (RotaTeq minus placebo) were calculated for the 
proportions of subjects with the AEs, along with associated 95% confidence intervals around the 
differences and p-values. The confidence intervals and p-values for the differences were based on an 
Assessment report  
EMA/251107/2012 
Page 11/21
 
 
 
 
exact binomial approach. An observational comparison of the result of >26 and ≤32 weeks of age at 
Dose 3 analysis with the result of the overall group analysis was also performed. 
All subjects (Safety Cohort) were evaluated for potential cases of IS and SAEs. Subjects in the Detailed 
Safety Cohort of study 006 and all subjects in 007 and 009 were evaluated with respect to all clinical 
AEs that occurred within 42 days following any vaccination. 
Statistical Analysis Plan – study 019 
The primary objective of 019 was to compare the observed incidence of IS within 30 days after infants 
received one or more doses of RotaTeq to the expected incidence of IS derived from the historical data 
using a statistical monitoring boundary. A secondary objective was to compare the incidence of IS in 
children who received RotaTeq to that in the concurrent control cohort composed of children not 
vaccinated with RotaTeq, matched by date of birth. The analysis was based on the concurrent control 
cohort. 
Available person-time was determined within the 0 to 30 day window following each dose. Person-time 
of follow-up was censored within the follow-up window upon the occurrence of a subsequent dose of a 
relevant vaccination, occurrence of a study outcome, study withdrawal or the infant reaching one year 
of age. The initial claims-based event date was replaced by the actual event date for chart-confirmed 
cases of IS if they were different. Potential cases IS were confirmed through searching cohort 
insurance claims for qualifying diagnosis or procedure codes from hospitals or ERs. Medical records 
were sought and there was adjudication of the diagnosis by an independent Adjudication Committee 
(AC) composed of three clinicians. 
Calculations were conducted for incidence rates of chart-confirmed events (events divided by person-
time), exact 95% confidence intervals (CI) and associated relative risks (RR), along with one-sided 
non-mid-p exact probabilities. 
Relative risks associated with RotaTeq were estimated by comparing the incidence of outcomes in the 
30 days following administration of any dose to the incidence derived from the 30 days subsequent to 
DTaP in the concurrent cohort of infants not vaccinated with RotaTeq. The RR was calculated by 
stratifying IS by the age of receipt of the third doses at <= 32 week and > 32 weeks of age and also 
at <= 26 weeks or > 26 weeks of age.  For this analysis by age, the cohort of children receiving the 
third dose of RotaTeq was compared to concurrent DTaP controls that received DTaP in the same age 
category.  
Vaccinated Cohorts were: 
1.  Prospective RotaTeq cohort: On a quarterly basis, all infants vaccinated with RotaTeq were 
identified in the claims database from the 1Q2006 through end 4Q2007 using the Current 
Procedural Terminology (CPT) code for oral rotavirus vaccine (90680 Rotavirus vaccine, 
pentavalent, 3 dose schedule, live, for oral use). 
2.  Concurrent DTaP control cohort: Applying the same eligibility criteria the concurrent DTaP infants 
were identified on a quarterly basis using CPT codes for DTaP vaccination. If a concurrent DTaP 
infant had a subsequent claim for RotaTeq then follow-up time of the infant was censored as of the 
date of vaccination and the infant entered into the RotaTeq cohort. A replacement concurrent DTaP 
infant was then selected from the pool of eligible comparators. The cohort included all infants first 
vaccinated with RotaTeq and DTaP in 2007.

A summary of the number of subjects who received the third dose of RotaTeq or placebo at >26 to 
≤32 weeks of age is provided in the next table. Numbers are based on the group to which the subject 
was randomised. Recipients of RotaTeq and placebo were comparable with respect to gender, age at 
enrolment and race.

There were no positively-adjudicated (confirmed) cases of intussusception in 007 or 009.   
In 006 one case of confirmed IS occurred within 42 days of dose 3 among subjects aged >26 to ≤32 
weeks of age at Dose 3. This subject had confirmed IS on Day 40 Post-dose 3 of RotaTeq. The subject 
was a Hispanic-American female aged 2 months when enrolled. On Day 22 Post-dose 3, the subject 
was taken to the ER and admitted to the hospital with blood and mucous in her stool. A stool specimen 
was negative for rotavirus and a stool culture was negative. A metabolic panel was within normal 
limits. On Day 23 Post-dose 3 she was discharged from the hospital with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis.   
Subsequently, on Day 40 Post-dose 3, the subject was brought back to the ER and was admitted to the 
hospital due to reports of bright red blood and an increase in the amount of mucous in her stools, 
constipation, abdominal pain and intermittent pyrexias. The signs and symptoms were consistent with 
total colon IS as suspected clinically from a protruding rectal mass. A barium enema confirmed IS and 
reduction was attempted using a barium enema. The mass was successfully reduced from the rectal 
region into the caecum but complete reduction was not possible. Exploratory laparotomy confirmed IS 
within the caecum and partial reduction was accomplished but perforation of the terminal ileum 
occurred so that a segmental resection of the terminal ileum and caecum was performed with ileal 
colostomy and appendectomy.  
On Day 45 Post-dose 3, the subject was discharged from the hospital and was considered to be 
recovered. The blinded investigator determined that the serious adverse experiences of gastroenteritis 
and intussusception were possibly related to RotaTeq. 
There were 5 confirmed cases of IS that occurred at any time Post-dose 3 in subjects aged > 26 to ≤ 
32 weeks at Dose 3, of which 2 received RotaTeq (see next table). In addition to the subject described 
above, the other case in the RotaTeq group concerned a subject who died due to confirmed IS on Day 
96 Post-dose 3 and sepsis on Day 99 Post-dose 3. The investigator determined that the 
intussusception and sepsis were probably not related to study vaccine.

There were also 9 non-confirmed cases of IS that occurred at any time Post-dose 3 in study 006 
among subjects aged >26 to ≤32 weeks at Dose 3. Three of the 9 cases had received RotaTeq and had 
non-confirmed IS within 42 days Post-dose 3. There were also 5 subjects in 007 and 2 in 009 who 
were medically evaluated for possible IS and one who received RotaTeq was aged >26 to ≤32 weeks 
at Dose 3.   
In the three studies and total study populations there were 17 subjects (7 RotaTeq) who experienced 
an AE resulting in death following Dose 3. This number included 5 subjects (2 RotaTeq) aged >26 
weeks to ≤32 weeks at Dose 3 and one of the two in the RotaTeq group was the subject mentioned 
above with IS and sepsis. The other RotaTeq recipient died on Day 16 Post-dose 3 with a cause of 
death initially reported as neonatal (“positional”) asphyxia (similar to SIDS) probably not related to 
study vaccine. The AE was later changed to death of unknown cause as the coroner found some 
evidence of pneumonia and could not define the cause of death as SIDS. Since the coroner was unable 
to exclude an association with the study vaccine the assessment of causality was changed to possibly 
vaccine related. 
No subjects discontinued due to a clinical AE from Day 1 to Day 42 following Dose 3. 
AEs of special interest were to be recorded on the vaccination report card (VRC) for the first 7 days 
following any dose for subjects in the Detailed Safety Cohort of study 006 and subjects in 007 and 
009. Among all these subjects there was no evidence of a difference between RotaTeq and placebo for 
rates of AEs of special clinical interest following Dose 3. 
In the subset aged >26 to ≤32 weeks at Dose 3 who reported AEs of special clinical interest within 7 
days Post-dose 3 the next table shows rates that were comparable between the RotaTeq and placebo 
groups or (for diarrhoea) were slightly numerically higher as was observed in the entire Detailed Safety 
Cohort in study 006. Number (%) aged >26 to ≤32 weeks at Dose 3 with AEs of special interest within

In 007 and 009 haematochezia was summarised in the CSR if reported within 42 days after a dose or 
as a SAE. In study 1.2% RotaTeq and 0.9% placebo group subjects reported haematochezia as a non-
serious AE and one in the placebo group reported haematochezia as a SAE 38 days Post-dose 3. In 
009, 0.4% RotaTeq and no placebo group subjects reported haematochezia. 
In the Detailed Safety Cohort of study 006 haematochezia was evaluated as an AE of special clinical 
interest within 42 days following each dose. Four of the 9 subjects who reported haematochezia as an 
AE within 42 days post-dose 3 had received RotaTeq. However, only two aged > 26 to ≤ 32 weeks at 
Dose 3 reported haematochezia as an AE within 42 days post-dose 3 and only one of these received 
RotaTeq 
The MAH’s conclusions from the combined safety analysis are as follows: 
1.  Among subjects who were > 26 to ≤ 32 weeks of age at Dose 3, the results suggest that there is 
no evidence of excess risk of intussusception associated with RotaTeq following Dose 3 when Dose 
3 is administered between 26 to 32 weeks of age.  
2.  There is no evidence of a difference between RotaTeq and placebo with respect to the incidences of 
adverse experiences of special clinical interest (diarrhoea, elevated temperature, irritability and 
vomiting) within 7 days following Dose 3 in subjects who were > 26 to ≤ 32 weeks of age at Dose 
3. 
3.  There is no evidence of a difference between the group that received RotaTeq and the group that 
received placebo with respect to the incidence of haematochezia within 42 days following Dose 3 in 
subjects who were > 26 to ≤ 32 weeks of age at Dose 3. 
Results – study 019 
The study identified 85,150 infants vaccinated with RotaTeq (over 210,000 doses) in the 2-year 
accrual period, contributing 17,433 person-years of follow-up within 30 days. The 62,617 concurrent 
DTaP controls contributed 12,339 person-years of follow-up within 30 days. The infants in the two 
cohorts were comparable with respect to age at first dose and proportion receiving subsequent doses. 
Among the infants that received at least one dose of RotaTeq there were 70,998 who received a 
second dose and 53,923 had received a third dose by the end of follow-up in March 2009.

For the 0 to 30 day follow-up window following any dose, there were 6 confirmed cases of IS among 
infants vaccinated with RotaTeq, which gives an incidence rate of 0.3 per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 
0.13, 0.75) compared with 5 cases among the concurrent controls vaccinated with DTaP for an 
incidence rate of 0.4 per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 0.13, 0.95) (RR of intussusception = 0.8, 95% 
CI: 0.22, 3.52). 
The figure below shows the distribution by week of age of vaccinated infants who received the third 
dose of RotaTeq. By the end of the study follow-up in period, 53,923 infants had received a third dose. 
Of these, 28,549 (52.9%) infants received the third dose at ≤ 26 weeks of age and 25,374 (47.1%) 
infants received the third dose at ages greater than 26 weeks.

Age at Adminstration (weeks)
The table below shows that when Dose 3 was administered at ≤ 26 weeks of age there were no 
confirmed cases of IS in the 30-day follow-up period in the RotaTeq or control groups. When Dose 3 
was administered at > 26 weeks of age there was one case only and this occurred in the control group. 
The corresponding analysis based on Dose 3 administration at ≤ 32 or > 32 weeks of age showed no 
cases when the dose was given after week 32 and the single case in the control group when it was 
given before 32 weeks of age.

Post-Marketing Safety Summary 
The MAH’s NWAES database was queried on May 12 2011 for spontaneous post-marketing reports 
received from Health Care Providers for the cumulative time period from market introduction 
(November 2005) up to March 31 2011. Additional criteria were added to narrow the search to identify 
patients with a vaccination at an age between 26 and 32 weeks. The criteria included all cases with the 
patient's birth date and vaccination date so that age at the time of vaccination could be calculated. 
Reports that had an estimated date of birth or vaccination were included.   
There were 330 reports that involved a patient with an age between 26 to 32 weeks at the time of 
vaccination of which 154 (47%) were serious (including all reports of haematochezia). The reports 
originated from the United States (n=283), Australia (n=37), Germany (n=4) and Spain (n=3) with 
single reports from each from Greece, Nicaragua and Slovenia.   
The most frequently reported serious adverse events were Intussusception† (86), Gastroenteritis 
rotavirus (20), vomiting† (20), dehydration (18), diarrhoea† (15), haematochezia† (14- from the time 
from market introduction through 01 March 2011, all reports of haematochezia were automatically 
upgraded to “serious” to ensure prompt regulatory reporting as part of a regulatory commitment), 
pyrexia† (13), gastroenteritis (6), irritability (5) and rotavirus infection (5).  Five (denoted †)of these 
10 events are listed in the CCDS.  
The MAH states that the conclusions that can be drawn are subject to the limitations of post-marketing 
data. The number of reports in which the age of the patient at the time of vaccination could be 
determined was relatively small (1853) compared to the total number of reports in the database 
(5272). The denominator (number of doses administered to infants between the ages of 26-32 weeks)

is unknown. However, in over five years of post-marketing experience, no new safety concerns have 
been identified in this patient population.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The CHMP considered that the clinical safety data from the studies discussed did not raise any specific 
concerns in view of IS or overall safety when the 3rd dose of Rotateq is given 26-32 weeks of age. 
Concerning the available post marketing data, also no specific safety signal could be detected up to 32 
weeks of age, however the CHMP noted that the number of reports in which the age of the patient at 
the time of vaccination could be determined was relatively small. Although the size of the safety 
database is limited for this population, the CHMP acknowledged that in over five years of post-
marketing experience no new safety concern has arisen in infants that received the 3rd dose of the 
vaccine at 26-32 weeks of age. 
2.4.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that no new pharmacovigilance 
activities in addition to those already being performed were needed to monitor the safety of the 
product. 
No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information. 
2.5.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed: 
SmPC  
Section 4.2: Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
(...) 
From 6 weeks to 26 32 weeks 
The vaccination course consists of three doses.  
The first dose may be administered from the age of 6 weeks and no later than the age of 12 weeks. 
RotaTeq may be given to infants who were born prematurely provided that the period of gestation was 
at least 25 weeks. These infants should receive the first dose of RotaTeq at least six weeks after birth 
(see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
There should be intervals of at least 4 weeks between doses. 
It  is  preferable  that  tThe  vaccination  course  of  three  doses  should  preferably  be  given  completed  by 
the  age  of  20-22  weeks.  If  necessary,  the  third  (last)  dose  may  be  given  up  to  the  age  of  32  weeks 
(see section 5.1). before the age of 20-22 weeks, and should be completed by the age of 26 32 weeks.

 Pharmacodynamic properties 
(…)  
In a combined post-hoc analysis of REST and another phase III study, the vaccine efficacy against G1-, 
G2-, G3- and G4-serotype RVG cases (any severity) was 61.5 % [95 % CI: 14.2; 84.2] among infants 
who were >26 to ≤32 weeks of age at dose 3. 
During  the  procedure,  the  CHMP  requested  the  following  additional  amendments  to  the  Product 
Information: 
Section 4.2: 
The initial wording proposed by the MAH, which deleted the preference for the 3rd dose up to week 20-
22, was revised to reflect that the vaccination course of three doses should be completed by the age of 
20-22 weeks. If necessary, the third (last) dose may be given up to the age of 32 weeks. 
Section 4.8 
Wording initially proposed by the MAH on analyses up to 32 weeks of age were considered not relevant 
or supported by data and therefore deleted. 
Section 5.1: 
Wording  proposed  by  the  MAH  on  the  administration  of  third  dose  of  vaccine  or  placebo  in  the  study 
was  deleted  as  the  efficacy  data  in  those  who  received  the  last  dose  after  age  26  weeks  suggest  a 
lower estimate of efficacy and since the age-specific efficacy is not shown. 
Furthermore,  the  wording  on  the  study  results  was  revised  as  it  was  not  acceptable  to  pool  the  data 
and  efficacy  was  not  wholly  consistent  with  that  for  the  entire  study  populations.  Also,  a  statement 
regarding severe RVGE was removed since no conclusions could be drawn from the cases 
Changes were also made to the Labelling to bring it in line with the current guidance on Braille which 
were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representatives of Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary and Slovakia. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The CHMP considers that the efficacy data suggest that it is not ideal to delay administration of the 
third dose, however that it was useful to revisit the rationale for the initial (and current) 
recommendation in the SmPC that the 3-dose schedule should be completed preferably by week 22 
and no later than week 26.  
This procedure was predominantly driven by the actual mean age at the time of the last dose in the 
Phase III pre-licensure studies. It was secondarily influenced by an attempt to complete all doses

before the peak age of naturally occurring intussusception in the EU in order to minimise the risk that 
naturally occurring IS could be wrongly attributed to the vaccine. In this regard the MAH has 
attempted to point out that the IS peak may occur even before week 26 but, in fact, the graphs show 
that completing all doses by week 22, as recommended to be preferable in the current SmPC, would 
still avoid dosing at the time of onset of peak incidence. 
Most EU countries employ a 3-dose primary infant immunisation series for all routine antigens and, if 
used, the third dose of RotaTeq is likely to be administered at the same visit as the last of these doses 
i.e. at around 6 months or 24 weeks of age. This last visit may be delayed for more than 2 weeks for 
many possible reasons.  
Therefore, and primarily for reasons of achieving a practical compromise, the CHMP agreed on a 
modified wording, which provides some additional latitude to the current dose recommendations. 
However at the same time, the new wording stresses the preference for adherence to the 
recommendations for completing dosing that were made at the time of initial approval. While delaying 
the last dose is not optimal, omitting the third dose simply because the child presents late is also not 
ideal. Since there is no clear evidence of a safety concern associated with a third dose at week 32 the 
compromise that has been agreed with respect to the SmPC is considered acceptable.  
Overall, taking together the available efficacy and safety data, the CHMP considered that the benefit-
risk remains positive when a 3rd dose is administered up to 32 weeks of age. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
To extend the upper limit of the administration of the third dose of vaccine from up to 26 weeks to up 
to 32 weeks of age. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet and to amend the section on Braille in the Labelling in line with current guidance. 
The variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Labelling and Package Leaflet.

Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Risk management system and PSUR cycle 
Pharmacovigilance system  
The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, as described in Module 1.8.1. of the 
Marketing Authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market. 
Risk Management Plan 
The MAH commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the 
Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in version 5.0 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in 
Module 1.8.2.of the Marketing Authorisation and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the 
CHMP. 
As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, any 
updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the following Periodic Safety Update Report 
(PSUR). 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
o  When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, 
Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities 
o  Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached 
o  At the request of the European Medicines Agency.  
Periodic Safety Reports (PSURS) 
The MAH will continue to submit yearly PSURs, unless otherwise specified by the CHMP. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan (P/149/2011) and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

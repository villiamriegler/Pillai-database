2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) has an estimated prevalence of (about) 1 out of 10,000. There is no 
known difference in prevalence across ethnic groups or gender. The European Register of Hereditary 
Angioedema reports a median age of symptom onset of 11 years and a median age of diagnosis at 26 years. 
In its most common form, hereditary angioedema presents as marked swelling of the face, mouth and/or 
airway (leading to difficulty breathing) and intestinal oedema (causing abdominal pain). Swelling can occur 
in any part of the body. Episodes may occur spontaneously or in response to triggers such as trauma, 
medications, viral illness and stress. The frequency of acute angioedema attacks varies widely but on 
average is approximately 4-5 times per year. Patients have reported as few as 0 and as many as 50 attacks 
per year. 
C1 esterase inhibitor is a protease inhibitor belonging to the serpin superfamily. Its main function is the 
inhibition of the complement system to prevent spontaneous activation. Deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor 
is associated with hereditary angioedema. In the absence of C1 inhibitor, excessive amounts of bradykinin 
are generated. Bradykinin promotes inflammation by increasing the leakage of fluid through the walls of 
blood vessels into body tissues.  C1-inhibitor concentration in blood is about 0.25 g/L. The blood 
concentration of C1-inhibitor is low in 85% of the cases of hereditary angioedema and in the remaining 15% 
the protein circulates in normal amounts but is dysfunctional. 
Mutations in the SERPING1 gene cause hereditary angioedema type I and type II. The SERPING1 gene 
provides instructions for making C1 inhibitor protein which blocks the activity of certain proteins that 
promote inflammation. Mutations that cause hereditary angioedema type I lead to reduced levels of C1 
inhibitor in the blood while mutations that cause type II result in the production of a C1 inhibitor that 
functions abnormally.

The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for 
Ruconest on 28 October 2010. The original marketing authorisation application for Ruconest was supported 
by main studies C1 1205 and C1 1304 conducted with adults as well as subjects aged 14 to <18 years. At the 
time of licence grant, the CHMP restricted the indication for adults only. On 16 July 2014, the US FDA 
approved Ruconest for adolescent and adult HAE patients, with the same dosing as in the European labelling. 
The company now submits the complete, integrated study report of the adolescent subjects who took part in 
studies C1 1205 and C1 1304 in support of the current variation application together with post marketing 
data in adolescents to gain an indication for Ruconest in this population.  
Other medicinal products available 
Berinert 500 units Powder and solvent for solution for injection/infusion is an extract of human plasma that 
contains the active substance: human C1-esterase inhibitor. Berinert is indicated for management of 
Hereditary angioedema types I and II. Berinert was approved via mutual recognition procedure 
DE/H/481/001/MR in 2009 with DE as RMS and multiple EU countries as CMS. The Berinert SmPC bears 
warnings on transmission of infectious agents. 
Icatibant (Firazyr) is a synthetic decapeptide with a structure similar to bradykinin and is a selective 
competitive antagonist at the bradykinin type 2 receptor.Firazyr was approved by a centralised procedure 
EU/1/08/461/01,02 in 2008 and has orphan status. Firazyr is indicated for symptomatic treatment of acute 
attacks of hereditary angioedema in adults (with C1-esterase-inhibitor deficiency).  Firazyr is administered 
subcutaneously. 
Ruconest will hence be the first medicinal product in Europe to bear the indication for management of 
hereditary angioedema in adolescents.

2.4.1.  Main studies 
Study title: An Integrated Analysis of the Safety, Immunogenicity, Pharmacokinetic and Efficacy with 
Recombinant Human C1 Inhibitor for the Treatment of Acute Hereditary Angioedema Attacks in Adolescent 
Patients Participating in Randomized and Open Label Phases of Studies C1 1304-01 and C1 1205-01. 
Study  C1  1205;  was  a  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind  Phase  II  study  on  the  safety  and 
efficacy of rhC1INH at doses of 50 and 100U/kg in relieving eligible attacks of angioedema with involvement 
of sub-mucosal tissues in patients with HAE.  
Study  C1  1304;  was  a  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind,  multi-centre  study  performed  in 
order to demonstrate the efficacy of rhC1INH at 100 U/kg in patients with HAE with attacks of angioedema. 
Methods 
Study participants 
Study C1 1205 
Patients were screened when asymptomatic and had to fulfil the following criteria to be included in the study 
(major criteria):  
•  Aged 12 years and above. 
•  Clinical and (central) laboratory diagnosis of HAE with Baseline plasma level of functional C1INH 
<50% of normal, without evidence for acquired angioedema (AAE) (by a low plasma level of C1q 
and/or presence of anti-C1INH antibodies). 
For randomization into the study, which took place when the patient presented with an attack, the patient 
had to fulfil all of the following criteria: 
1.  Above Screening criteria were still met. 
2.  Evidence for exacerbation or development of an abdominal attack and/or of facial-oropharyngeal 
angioedema and/or laryngeal angioedema and/or of urogenital angioedema and/or peripheral 
angioedema.  
3.  Onset of eligible symptoms within 5 hours before medical evaluation of eligibility had occurred. 
4.  Patient VAS scores of overall severity of angioedema symptoms at least at 1 eligible location at the 
time of evaluation (Time -1 hour) of at least 50 mm, where 0 mm meant ‘no symptoms at all’ and 
100 mm meant ‘extremely disabling’.

Study C1 1304 
Patients were screened when asymptomatic and had to fulfill the following criteria to be included in the 
study: 
•  Aged at least 16 years. 
•  Clinical and central laboratory diagnosis of HAE with HAE with baseline plasma level of functional 
C1INH <50% of normal. 
For randomization into the study, the patient had to fulfil all of the following criteria in addition to the 
screening criteria: 
1.  Evidence for exacerbation or development of an abdominal attack and/or of facial-oropharyngeal 
angioedema and/or laryngeal angioedema and/or of urogenital angioedema and/or peripheral 
angioedema. Patients had to notify and discuss symptoms with the Investigator prior to travelling to 
the study centre. 
2.  Onset of eligible symptoms within 5 hours before medical evaluation of eligibility had occurred. 
3.  Patient VAS score of overall severity of angioedema symptoms of ≥ 50 mm at least 1 anatomical 
location at the time of evaluation (Time -1 hours). 
4.  No clear improvement (improvement defined as a decrease in VAS score of overall severity of 
angioedema symptoms ≥20 mm) in angioedema signs between determination of eligibility, (Time -1 
hour) and baseline (Time 0 hours). 
Major exclusion criteria in both studies concerned history of allergic reactions to C1INH concentrates or any 
rabbit protein, diagnosis of acquired C1INH deficiency, and presentation or development of a 
life-threatening attack (an attack requiring immediate emergency procedures to prevent death, hypoxemia 
related injuries or other unfavourable outcomes). 
Treatments 
In both studies, patients were to present for evaluation within 5 hours and be treated within 1 hour after 
eligibility of the angioedema attack was confirmed. The patients received recombinant human C1 Inhibitor 
(rhC1INH, INN conestat alfa) by intravenous (iv) infusion. 
Study C1 1304 Randomised Clinical Trial 
Study treatment was: 
• 
rhC1INH at 100 U/kg body weight  
Study C1 1304 Open Label Extension  
The initial treatment dose was 1 vial (2100 U resulting in 18-40 U/kg). At the discretion of the Investigator 
and depending upon the patient’s clinical response, an additional iv dose of 1 (2100 U) or 2 (4200 U) vials 
could be administered within 4 hours from the initial dose. The maximum amount of rhC1INH that could be 
given to a patient for a single attack was 3 vials. 
Study C1 1205 Randomised Clinical Trial 
Study treatment was either:

Page 10/37 
 
  
  
 
 
 
• 
• 
rhC1INH at 100 U/kg body weight 
rhC1INH at 50 U/kg body weight 
Study C1 1205 Open Label Extension 
The initial treatment dose was 50 U/kg. At the discretion of the Investigator and depending upon the 
patient’s clinical response, an additional iv dose of 50 U/kg could be administered within 4 hours from the 
initial dose. The maximum amount of rhC1INH that could be given to a patient for a single attack was 100 
U/kg. 
In the double-blind RCT phase of each study, the corresponding volume of 0.9% sodium chloride solution 
was administered as a control. There was no reference therapy in the OLE phase of each study. 
It is noted that only 1 adolescent took part in the randomised, double-blinded phase of one study. All other 
adolescents contributed results after the studies were converted to an open-label format after an interim 
analysis had convinced of efficacy. 
The number of adolescents per RCT (randomised controlled trial) and OLE (open label extension) sections of 
the studies is given in the Table 1. 
Table 1 Number of adolescent patients and attacks treated per study 
Objectives 
Main objectives of the integrated retrospective analysis of data from patients aged less than 18 years that 
took part in randomized controlled trials (studies C1 1205 RCT and C1 1304 RCT) and their respective open 
label extension (OLE) phases (studies C1 1205 OLE and C1 1304 OLE) was to: 
• 
• 
assess the safety, immunogenicity, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
recombinant human C1 inhibitor (rhC1INH, INN: conestat alfa) in symptomatic adolescent patients 
with hereditary angioedema, 
assess the efficacy of rhC1INH in symptomatic adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema, 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy:  
A patient reported visual analogue scale (VAS) was chosen to assess efficacy. VAS scores were recorded 
repeatedly throughout the study at defined time points and were measured at up to 4 different locations 
(abdominal, genitourinary, orofacial-pharyngeal-laryngeal or peripheral), depending on the affected 
locations. A series of VAS assessments were taken that varied for each location. To allow consistent 
evaluation of attacks at different anatomical locations, an overall severity VAS for each location was used. 
The last VAS question for each location indicated the overall severity of angioedema symptoms as felt by the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/203093/2016 
Page 11/37 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
patient for that location. All VAS scores were measured as a continuous scale from 0 to 100 mm. For most 
of the VAS questions, including the overall severity VAS, 0 mm corresponded to ‘No symptoms at all’ and 100 
mm corresponded to ‘Extremely disabling’. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to the beginning of relief, assessed using overall severity VAS 
scores, where beginning of relief was defined as a decrease in VAS score of ≥20 mm (with persistence of the 
decrease at the next assessment time) at an eligible anatomical location compared to Baseline (Time 0, just 
prior to study medication infusion).  
The secondary efficacy endpoint was the time to minimal symptoms, where ‘minimal symptoms’ was defined 
as an overall severity VAS score of <20 mm in severity of symptoms at all locations. 
A number of exploratory endpoints were included in the analysis, e.g. therapeutic failure, relapse of an 
attack.  
Clinical pharmacology: 
Blood samples were taken for functional C1INH, antigenic C1INH and C4. 
Safety and tolerability  
Safety and tolerability were assessed by evaluation of treatment emergent adverse events, vital signs, 
electrocardiogram, physical examination, safety laboratory parameters, and immunogenicity. 
Sample size/patient population 
The studies were planned to provide data describing the treatment of 50 angioedema attacks in at least 16 
recruited adolescent patients. 
Randomisation 
The central randomization was carried out when the patient presented with an acute angioedema attack.  
Study C1 1205-01:  
The block size used was 3 with an allocation ratio of 1:1:1. There was no stratification factor used in the 
randomization. 
Study C1 1304-01: 
Treatment allocation was stratified by attack type (‘submucosal’ and ‘peripheral’) at the discretion of the 
Investigator. The block size was 2 with an allocation ratio of 1:1.  
Only 1 adolescent patient took part in RCT (for 1 attack) remaining patients were enrolled for OLE studies 
Statistical methods 
Full Analysis Set (Modified Intention-To-Treat) (FAS [mITT]): defined as the set of patients who were 
randomized to one of the treatment groups and who took at least 1 dose of the study drug.  
Safety Analysis Set: defined as the set of patients who received study drug and based on the actual 
treatment that the patient received.  
The results for studies C1 1304 and C1 1205 were combined by pooling the data from both studies. 
Assessment report

All 16 patients were included in the FAS (mITT) and the Safety Analysis Sets. 
Results 
Recruitment 
First paediatric patient included in this analysis was enrolled on 17th February 2007 and last patient 
completed on 20th January 2010.  Sixteen patients were recruited (8 male and 8 female), aged 14 to <18yrs 
at the time of first treatment. Nine of the patients participated in the study C1 1205 and remaining 7 took 
part in the study C1 1304. The study was conducted across 6 sites in the USA (9 patients), 3 sites in Israel 
(4 patents) and at 1 site in Romania (3 patients). In total 50 angioedema attacks were treated. 
Patient demographics 
Patient demographics are summarised in the following table: 
None of the patients smoked or used alcohol. Seven patients were on maintenance therapy or prophylactic 
treatment at Screening; 3 patients received androgens, 3 patients received C1INH and 1 patient received 
androgens and C1INH previously. Two patients had received previous treatment with rhC1INH. 
The 16 patients had experienced between 2 and 48 attacks per year prior to the study in which they were 
enrolled. The impact of these attacks ranged from minor (4 patients), through moderate (7 patients), to 
major (5 patients). 
Conduct of the study 
Baseline data 
Of the 16 patients included in this integrated analysis, 14 patients had 2 or more attacks, 8 patients had 3 
or more attacks, 5 patients had 4 or more attacks, and 3 patients had 5 or more attacks whilst aged < 18 
years. (Some patients had treatment for further attacks aged ≥ 18 years, although these are excluded from 
this analysis).

Events are summarised by dose of product administered in the following table: 
The 16 patients received rhC1INH treatment for a total of 50 acute attacks. Overall, 44 of the 50 attacks 
were at single locations (26 abdominal, 9 peripheral, 7 oro-facial-pharyngeal-laryngeal and 2 
genito-urinary); the remaining 6 attacks were located as follows: 3 abdominal/peripheral, 2 peripheral 
attacks manifested at 2 separate locations, and 1 abdominal/oro-facial-pharyngeal-laryngeal. 
Twenty three attacks (46%) were treated with a single dose of rhC1INH 50 U/kg, 16 attacks (32%) were 
treated with rhC1INH 18-40 U/kg with an additional dose, and 8 attacks (16%) were treated with a single 
dose of rhC1INH 18-40 U/kg. The remaining attacks were treated with rhC1INH 50 U/kg with an additional 
dose (2 attacks, 4%) and a single dose of rhC1INH 100 U/kg (1 attack, 2%). 
Overall, 7 patients completed all follow-up visits after each attack, 8 patients did not complete all follow-up 
visits, and 1 patient withdrew consent (entered a different clinical study). 
Concomitant Medication 
Most patients (14 or 88%) reported using concomitant medications during the studies. The most frequently 
used types of concomitant medications were anti-gonadotropins. Concomitant medications are summarised 
in the following table:

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary end-points 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to beginning of relief of symptoms at the location that showed 
the first response to treatment (overall severity VAS decrease of ≥ 20 mm from Baseline with persistence at 
next assessment time) in the FAS (mITT) set. Due to the low number of patients having more than 5 attacks 
(n=2), summaries are presented for the first 5 attacks experienced by the patients. One patient was 
excluded from the summary of Attack 1 for all VAS endpoints as she had no individual or overall VAS value 
at Attack 1. This patient was included in all other efficacy endpoints. 
Median time (minutes) to beginning of relief of symptoms with persistence for each attack is shown in below 
table: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/203093/2016 
Page 15/37 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Due to low number of patients having more than 5 attacks (n=2) summaries are presented for the first 5 
attacks experienced by the patients. The calculated time to beginning of relief of symptoms for the 2 patients 
with 7 treated attacks each were 231 and 15 minutes, respectively (Attack 6), and 62 and 120 minutes, 
respectively (Attack 7). 
Only two adolescents received saline solution in the dataset used for this analysis. The time to beginning of 
relief (of symptoms) for these two saline-treated subjects was 245 and 496mins, both much longer than the 
times reported for the Ruconest-treated subjects.  
The company provided corresponding data to allow for a direct comparison of the treatment effects seen in 
the adult and the adolescent populations. 
The below table shows the results for the primary efficacy analysis for adults: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/203093/2016 
Page 16/37 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The median time to the beginning of relief of symptoms was 65 minutes (95% CI: 60.0-79.0) for adults as 
compared with 35 minutes (95% CI: 31.0-62.0) for adolescents for attack 1. Very similar results for 
subsequent treated attacks were seen in both adults and adolescents. 
Furthermore, the results for time to beginning of relief on subsequent attacks (attacks 2-5) were comparable 
for both the adult and the adolescent population. There was therefore no detectable difference in efficacy 
between adults and adolescents in the response to Ruconest treatment. This is also evident in the 
Kaplan-Meier plots for each group: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/203093/2016 
Page 17/37 
 
  
  
 
 
The results presented above for adolescents and for adults contain data pooled from subjects taking part in 
studies C1 1205 or C1 1304 or their respective OLE phases. During the assessment the company provided 
the results for adults and adolescents separately for each of the studies to allow for a direct analysis of the 
results without the risk of any uncertainties arising from combining the sub-groups.  
According to the provided data, the median time to beginning of relief of symptoms for adolescents taking 
part in the study C1 1205 was about 35mins and the median time for adults was about 60mins. The results 
excluded the data for one adolescent subject who (as the only one) took part in the RCT phase of the study 
C1 1205.  The data for this subject were presented separately and were similar to those for the other 
adolescents in the study C1 1205, irrespective of dose (this subject received both 100U/Kg and 50U/Kg 
single dose for different events). The times to beginning of relief of symptoms for adolescents from the study 
C1 1304 were longer and showed more variability compared to adults, nonetheless the results for 
adolescents and adults could be considered sufficiently similar. 
Time to Beginning of Relief by Dose 
The median time to beginning of relief of symptoms with persistence (in minutes) is presented for the FAS 
(mITT) Population in Table 13.  Although the numbers of participants are small, results suggest that a 
50U/Kg single dose or additional dose shortens the time to the beginning of relief of symptoms (37mins 
median) compared to up to 40U/Kg single dose (120mins median). 
Secondary end-points 
The secondary efficacy endpoint was the time to minimal symptoms for an attack, assessed using VAS at all 
locations. Time to minimal symptoms was defined as overall severity VAS at all locations < 20 mm. 
Table 4 and Table 5 (below) show median time to minimal symptoms for adult and for adolescents, 
respectively. As with the primary efficacy analysis, there was consistency in response to treatment for 
subsequent attacks in both adolescents and adults. The median times were shorter after all attacks for 
adolescents as compared with adults only.

The company also submitted the comparison of data from adolescent and adults separately from each of the 
studies, showing that the results for time to minimal symptoms for adults and adolescents were comparable.

Selected exploratory endpoints: Therapeutic Failure and Relapse of Attack 
Therapeutic failure was defined for patients for whom the time to the beginning of the relief of symptoms 
was longer than 4 hours. In total, 3 patients experienced 5 therapeutic failures: 1 patient following attacks 
1, 2 and 3 and 2 patients following attack 2. The patient who experienced therapeutic failure in 3 attacks 
received a single dose of rhC1INH 18-40 U/kg for each of attacks 1 and 2 and an additional dose of rhC1INH 
18-40 U/kg for the treatment of attack 3 (total dose: 60.87 U/kg) prior to being assessed as a treatment 
failure.  
Two patients who experience therapeutic failure for attack 2 received additional doses of rhC1INH 18-40 
U/kg (total doses: 73.68 and 52.50 U/kg, respectively for the treatment of their second attacks prior to 
being assessed as treatment failures). 
No patients experienced relapse of the attack within 24 hours according to VAS scores. One patient 
experienced relapse of the attack according to Investigator Score (early relapse at a peripheral location 
during Attack 2).  
Summary of main study(ies) 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well as 
the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data were collected in adolescents in analysed studies. The company has presented 
data demonstrating changes in concentration of antigenic C1INH in plasma following administration of the 
treatment. In majority of the patients PK concentrations of antigenic C1INH were maximal at the 15-minute 
time point (one patient in one attack had maximal concentrations of antigenic C1INH at the 30-minute time 
point) and declined slowly thereafter. Those patients, who received a repeated dose of rhC1INH for a single 
attack attained maximal concentrations of antigenic C1INH at the next blood sampling time after the end of 
the repeat infusion.  
The company also submitted the available data documenting Cmax of antigenic C1INH in adolescents treated 
for number of attacks. Most data were collected for those patients who received rhC1INH 18-40 U/kg, either 
as a single or additional dose. For patients who received a single dose of rhC1INH 18-40 U/kg, individual 
antigenic C1INH Cmax ranged from 183-639 μg/mL, with similar mean values of approximately 346 and 377 
μg/mL for Attacks 1 and 2, respectively. For patients who received a repeat dose of rhC1INH 18-40 U/kg, 
individual antigenic C1INH Cmax ranged from 215-782 μg/mL, with mean values ranging from 
383.00-522.20 μg/mL for Attacks 1 to 5. Upon administration of a single dose of rhC1INH 50 U/kg, antigenic 
C1INH Cmax was 361 μg/mL based on the 1 patient with data. For the patient with PK data who received a 
repeat dose of rhC1INH 50 U/kg, antigenic C1INH Cmax was 354 μg/mL.  
Upon administration rhC1INH 100 U/kg, antigenic C1INH Cmax was 641 μg/mL based on the 1 patient with 
data.  
Plasma concentrations of antigenic C1INH appeared to reflect the administered dose and seemed to be 
independent across the treatments for subsequent attacks.

EMA/CHMP/203093/2016

Pharmacodynamics 
C1 esterase inhibitor prevents the proteolytic cleavage of complement component C4. Blood concentrations 
of complement components are low during an acute attack of hereditary angioedema because they are being 
consumed faster than they are generated. Indeed, a low blood concentration of C4 is a key diagnostic finding 
for hereditary angioedema. Exogenous C1 esterase inhibitor administered during an acute attack of 
hereditary angioedema may be expected to prevent further decrease in C4 concentration or even increase 
the levels of C4 in plasma.  
Mean and individual patient C4 antigen concentrations were typically low at baseline and generally increased 
following treatment, although data were highly variable. Visual inspection indicates C4 antigen 
concentrations began to normalize by approximately 4 hours in the rhC1INH 50 U/kg single dose group and 
18-40 U/kg plus additional dose group, and by 8 hours in the rhC1INH 100 U/kg single dose group. C4 
antigen concentrations were more variable in the rhC1INH 18-40 U/kg single dose and 50 U/kg plus 
additional dose groups, although values appeared to normalize by 24 hours. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/203093/2016 
Page 26/37 
 
  
  
 
 
The pattern of change in concentration of C4 in blood of adolescent patients following the administration of 
Ruconest was consistent with expected pharmacodynamic activity. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The company provided pooled data from adolescents taking part in studies C1 1205, C1 1304 and their 
respective OLE phases compared to the results from the adult population. Although only 16 adolescents took 
part in the clinical studies, the results in this patient group demonstrated the marked and consistent 
reductions in time to relief of symptoms in comparison to placebo. The pooled results reported for time to 
beginning of relief of symptoms and time to minimal symptoms, as defined, for adolescents and adults were 
of similar magnitude and in the same direction, i.e. reduction in comparison to placebo. 
However, the interpretation of the pooled results was to some degree difficult to interpret as the clinical 
studies used different posologies and, when converted to single arm studies, the posologies were further 
changed. Therefore, during the assessment the CHMP requested that the company provides the results for 
adults and adolescents separately for each of the studies/study phases, in order to allow for a direct analysis 
of the results without the risk of any uncertainties arising from combining the sub-groups. The submitted 
results show that the time to beginning of relief of symptoms as well as the time to minimal symptoms in 
either of the studies were similar between adolescents and adults and corresponded with the pooled results 
for adults and adolescents. This was considered reassuring by the CHMP. 
Even though there were only 2 identified control subjects on saline, data provide re-assurance on the 
efficacy of Ruconest. From a methodological point of view it would have been preferred to have more 
patients under saline comparator to better establish a timeline on drug response for the placebo comparator 
group but taking into account ethical considerations in this life-threatening condition extrapolation based on 
results in adolescents from the open label phase of the studies and the comparability to adult data is 
acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/203093/2016 
Page 27/37 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Majority of adolescents participating in the analysed studies were administered either 50U/Kg or 18-40U/kg 
(1 vial) single dose of Ruconest, some received also and additional doses. Although numbers of participants 
were small, results suggest that 50U/Kg single dose or additional dose shortens the time to the beginning of 
relief of symptoms in comparison to 18-40U dose. 
Three patients treated with Ruconest experienced therapeutic failure. However, it was noted during the 
assessment that the apparent therapeutic failures were few in number and occurred in the context of 
receiving less than the maximum possible dose of Ruconest. No patients experienced relapse of the attack 
within 24 hours according to VAS scores. One patient experienced relapse of the attack according to 
Investigator Score (early relapse at a peripheral location during Attack 2). However, there was a discrepancy 
between the outcomes reported by the patient and Investigator with the patient recording minimal 
symptoms.  
In the light of limited PK data available for adolescents, a comparable pharmacokinetic behaviour of C1INH 
in adults and adolescents was demonstrated in order to support extrapolation of the positive B/R of C1INH 
in adults to adolescents. The company performed a population PK modelling to evaluate the potential 
differences in C1INH PK between the adolescent and adult populations.  Due to the limited number of 
adolescent patients for whom PK data were available, only 8 individuals were included in the POPPK model.  
The weight range of these subjects was similar to adults, 46- 85 kg versus 45- 128 kg.  
The analysis revealed that the effects of gender and age were adequately captured by the model. The 
correlation between predicted and observed Cmax and AUC was assessed to be adequate. Moreover,  the 
inclusion of age as a categorical covariate on the V, Vmax and Km parameters of the model resulted in a very 
small drop in OFV both with and without weight on V. This indicates that the PK of rhC1INH is consistent 
between adolescents and adults.    
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy and PK results for adolescents are consistent with those seen in adults and indicate a beneficial 
effect of rhC1INH in the treatment of HAE attacks in adolescents. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety and efficacy of rhC1INH were established by 10 clinical studies of immunogenicity, PK, safety, 
and efficacy, and by nonclinical toxicity and pharmacology studies. At the time of the last PSUR (data lock 
point 28 April 2015), the total number of subjects who received Ruconest across all studies was 335 and the 
total number of administrations was 1032. Ruconest was marketed in 19 countries world-wide and no new 
safety concerns arose from the data presented.  
Patient exposure  
In total, 16 adolescent patients were exposed to Ruconest and received treatment for up to 7 attacks each. 
The mean dose received by patients was similar across attacks, being in the range of 25-100 U/kg. Most 
attacks (64%) were treated with 1 dose of rhC1INH; of the 25 attacks treated with rhC1INH 50 U/kg, 23 
attacks (92%) were treated with a single dose and 2 attacks (8%) were treated with an additional dose.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/203093/2016 
Page 28/37 
 
  
  
 
 
Of the 24 attacks treated with rhC1INH 18-40 U/kg, 8 attacks (33%) were treated with a single dose and 16 
attacks (67%) were treated with an additional dose. One attack was treated with a single administration of 
rhC1INH 100 U/kg. 
All treatments with multiple doses were given within the required 4 hours after the initial dose, with the 
exception of 1 patient, who received his second dose 4.75 hours after the start of his first dose infusion. 
The extent of the patient exposure is summarised in the table: 
Adverse events 
The safety set comprised 16 patients. There were no deaths, serious TEAEs or discontinuations due to 
TEAEs. Six patients (38%), all female, reported a total of 24 TEAEs. 
3/16 (19%), 2/14 (14%), 2/8 (25%), 2/5 (40%), and 3/3 (100%) patients reported TEAEs during Attacks 
1-5, respectively. The apparent increase in frequency of TEAEs with subsequent attacks was associated with 
a decrease in the number of patients with attacks. 
Of the 2 patients who experienced 7 attacks each, only 1 patient experienced TEAEs after Attack 5 
(nasopharyngitis and headache during Attacks 6 and 7, respectively). 
All events were mild or moderate in severity; no patients experienced TEAEs which were considered severe. 
None of the events were considered to be probably or definitely related to study drug. One patient 
experienced vertigo and nausea which were considered to be possibly related to study drug. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/203093/2016 
Page 29/37 
 
  
  
 
 
 
TEAEs were most commonly reported in the Infections and Infestations SOC (6 events in 3 patients), with 
influenza, ear infection, and nasopharyngitis being reported at a similar and low frequency. 
For TEAE in adults, the more common events were: (i) 23% reported Infections and infestations, (ii) 14% 
reported headache, (iii) 4% reported abdominal pain and (iv) 10% reported a skin disorder, mostly pruritus 
and erythema. 
For TEAE in adolescents, the more common events were: (i) 19% reported Infections and infestations, (ii) 
6% reported abdominal pain and (iii) 13% reported a skin disorder i.e. urticaria and rash. 
Fifty eight percent of adults (78/141) had a TEAE whereas the corresponding rate for adolescents was 38% 
(6/16).  
Laboratory findings 
Treatment with rhC1INH did not result in clinically significant changes in routine clinical laboratory safety 
parameters. 
No patient developed treatment-emergent anti-pdC1INH, anti-rhC1INH, or anti-HRI antibodies upon 
exposure to the study drug.

Five patients experienced abnormal changes in physical examination findings from Baseline: 
Patient experienced mild sinus arrhythmia (not clinically significant) at 24 hours after treatment for 
attack 1, slight facial edema at 24 hours after treatment for attack 2, and acne on day 22 relative to 
attack 3 
Patient experienced cerumen in right and left ear canals on day 90 following attack 2 
Patient experienced edema of the right hand on day 22 relative to attack 1 
Patient experience an acute facial attack of angioedema which was severe in intensity in day 22 
relative to attack 2 
Patient experienced an acute attack of angioedema on left and right arms on day 22 relative to 
attack 1.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths or other SAEs in the adolescent population. 
Post marketing experience 
Ruconest is licensed for use in adolescents outside of the European Union. The company provided a 
summary of post-marketing evidence of continuing clinical safety in the adolescent population aged 14 to 
<18yrs. As of the end of 2015, there have been 20 patients under the age of 18 years treated with Ruconest 
in the US. For the adolescent population a total of four adverse events have been reported:  
•  Urticaria: 14yr old female, non-serious, possibly related. Patient recovered. 
• 
Ear infection: 14yr old male, non-serious, causality not ascertained, outcome not known.  
•  Neck pain: 16yr old female, non-serious, unlikely related. 
• 
Joint pain: 16yr old female, non-serious, unlikely related, outcome not reported. This subject also 
experienced an episode of lack of efficacy and difficulties with the giving device, considered 
non-assessable. 
None of the reports suggest a new safety concern.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Data on clinical safety in adolescents were presented to the CHMP at the time of initial marketing 
authorisation application and within the context of a combined population of adults and adolescents. Safety 
issues now reported in the integrated study reports do not give any particular reason for concern and are 
encompassed by the current SmPC. 
There are limited adolescent events to make meaningful comparisons for the SOCs, however, the reports in 
adolescents appear to be similar to those of adults. The safety issues reported by the company from the post 
marketing setting do not give any particular reason for concern and are encompassed by the current SmPC.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The evidence of clinical safety in adolescents is limited to the data from 16 participating subjects but do not 
appear to be different from adults and are considered to be reflected appropriately in the SmPC. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The extension of the indication consists of an extension of the target population from adults only to adults 
and adolescents. The supportive clinical data were already present in the previous versions of the RMP. The 
last RMP was recently updated and assessed as part of the renewal application (EMA/H/C/001223/R/0023). 
The CHMP considered no RMP update necessary for this application. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.  
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Ruconest is indicated for treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adults and adolescents with hereditary 
angioedema (HAE) due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration

The safety and efficacy of Ruconest in children (age 0 to 12 years) has not yet been established. Currently 
available data on adolescents (age 13 to 17 years) are described in section 5.1, but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made. 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
(…) 
Paediatric population 
Nine adolescent HAE patients (aged 13 to 17 years) were treated with 50 U/kg for 26 acute angioedema 
attacks, and 7 (aged 16 to 17 years) with 2100 U for 24 acute angioedema attacks. The efficacy and safety in 
adolescent patients was consistent with that seen in adults. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Data from studies C1 1205 and C1 1304 were examined by separating results obtained on adolescents from 
adults with a view to claim the indication in adolescents. 
A beneficial effect of treatment in the condition of hereditary angioedema would be a speedy resolution of 
signs and symptoms of an acute attack of angioedema. The primary end-point chosen by the company 
addresses timing to beginning of resolution of symptoms, recorded in minutes. A secondary endpoint was 
time to minimal symptoms, recorded in minutes. 
For 7 adolescents who took part in study C1 1304 and who were administered Ruconest: 
• 
• 
The median time to beginning of relief of symptoms, as defined, of an attack was 120 minutes (95% 
CI 34, 130; 23 attacks treated). (One patient was given saline placebo and recorded a time to relief 
of symptoms, as defined, of the first attack of 496mins). By simple analysis, the reduction in time to 
relief of symptoms for study drug v. placebo is, therefore, about 6 hours. 
The median time to minimal symptoms was 240mins (95% CI 240, 730). [One patient was given 
saline placebo and recorded a time to minimal symptoms, as defined, of 988 mins]. By simple 
analysis, the reduction in time to minimal symptoms for study drug v. placebo is, therefore, about 12 
hours. 
For 9 adolescents who took part in study C1 1205 and who were administered Ruconest 50U/Kg: 
• 
• 
The median time to beginning of relief of symptoms, as defined, of an attack was 37 minutes (95% 
CI 31, 60). [One patient was given saline placebo and recorded a time to relief of symptoms, as 
defined, of 245mins]. By simple analysis, the reduction in time to relief of symptoms for study drug 
v. placebo is, therefore, about 6.5 hours. 
The median time to minimal symptoms was 116mins (95% CI 60, 141). [One patient was given 
saline placebo and recorded a time to minimal symptoms, as defined, of 2840 mins]. By simple 
analysis, the reduction in time to minimal symptoms for study drug v. placebo is, therefore, about 45 
hours. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/203093/2016

One adolescent in study C1 1205 was administered Ruconest 100U/Kg and returned a time to 
beginning of relief of symptoms of 64 mins and a time to minimal symptoms of 124mins. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Uncertainties as to whether the efficacy will wane on long term repeated administration in subjects who 
develop antibodies against rhC1INH data is addressed by a registry as described in the RMP.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
No deaths occurred during any of the clinical studies. Six out of 16 adolescents (38%) had a 
treatment-emergent adverse event whereas 78 out of 141 adults (58%) reported a treatment-emergent 
adverse event and post marketing experience provided on further 20 adolescent patients do not suggest 
new safety concerns in this rare disease. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The safety database on adolescents is extremely limited but new safety concerns are not evident in the 
adolescent group compared to adults.

Notes: 
[1] study C1 1304. This study began as a randomised placebo-controlled trial using a posology of 100U/Kg Ruconest, one 
dose per acute attack.  
This study was converted to a single-arm study using a posology of 2100 U (i.e. one vial) with provision for a second vial 
to be administered. It is understood that all adolescents entered this study as a single-arm study and that all received 
2100U for each attack. 
[2] study C1 1205. This study began as a randomised placebo-controlled trial using a posology of Ruconest 50U/Kg or 
100U/Kg. This study was converted to a single-arm study with posology of 50 U/kg initial dose Ruconest, upon clinical 
response a repeat dose of 50 U/kg may be given.  
One adolescent entered this study whilst still an RCT, was administered 100U/Kg Ruconest and returned a time to 
beginning of relief of symptoms of 64mins and a time to minimal symptoms of 124mins. 
All other adolescents entered the study after it had become a single-arm study and all adolescents were administered 50 
U/kg Ruconest during the single-arm phase. 
[3] studies C1 1304 and C1 1205 combined. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Hereditary angioedema is a rare condition characterised by potentially life-threatening crises of acute 
angioedema. Early relief of symptoms in order to avert a life-threatening crisis is key in the treatment of 
attacks. Ruconest is intended for the treatment of acute attacks of angioedema in subjects with hereditary 
angioedema to reduce the time taken to achieve relief of symptoms.  
With the caveats that both clinical studies C1 1205 and C1 1304 for adolescents followed a single-arm design 
and that adolescents  represent a sub-group within each study, simple analysis of the results for adolescents 
show marked and consistent reductions in time to beginning of relief of symptoms and time to minimal 
symptoms compared to placebo. The effect was shown to be consistent in both, adults and adolescents. 
The marked reduction in time to achieve relief of symptoms (either beginning of relief or minimal symptoms 
only) is considered to be very important because of the potentially life-threatening nature of the condition. 
The importance of favourable effects is further supported by: 
• 
• 
continued availability of supply of Ruconest (produced by recombinant technology) in comparison to 
supply from donor plasma that may vary, 
not being a blood-derived product thereby removing the potential risk of exposure to blood-borne 
pathogens.

There were no deaths, serious TEAEs or discontinuations due to TEAEs in the clinical studies. 
Six patients (38%), all female, reported a total of 24 TEAEs that were similar to those reported in adults i.e. 
urticaria, skin rash, abdominal discomfort and headache. None of the events were considered to be probably 
or definitely related to study drug.  
One patient experienced vertigo and nausea which were considered to be possibly related to study drug. 
There were too few adolescent subjects to conduct a comprehensive assessment of clinical safety: this is 
understood given the rarity of the condition of hereditary angioedema. Those adverse events / reactions that 
were reported are considered to be tolerable and relatively unimportant. 
The consequences of antibody development is planned to be ascertained in an ongoing PASS as described in 
the RMP.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The potential life-saving consequence of exposure to Ruconest in the management of acute attacks of 
angioedema in subjects with hereditary angioedema far outweighs the unfavourable aspects, thus far 
limited to one patient experiencing vertigo and nausea which were considered to be ‘possibly related’ to 
study drug. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Although the total evidence of clinical efficacy is small as only 16 adolescents took part in the clinical studies 
which were (mostly) conducted in a single-arm experimental fashion, the marked and consistent reductions 
in time to relief of symptoms in comparison to placebo (administered during the placebo-controlled phases 
of the studies) and the similar magnitude of the effect in adults give overall assurance of clinical efficacy in 
adolescents. Furthermore a comparable pharmacokinetic behaviour of C1INH in adults and adolescents was 
demonstrated in order to support extrapolation of the positive B/R of C1INH in adults to adolescents. 
There are outstanding concerns that clinical efficacy may wane over time but these have not been 
substantiated by the clinical programme now submitted which showed (apparent) consistent effect over the 
first five distinct episodes of acute angioedema. A long term follow up is being conducted via a registry. 
The total evidence of clinical safety is limited, with the company reporting only one treatment emergent 
adverse event of vertigo and nausea that it considered to be related to study drug but the safety profile can 
be considered to be adequately managed with current risk minimisation and pharmacovigilance activities as 
described in the RMP.The sparseness of data comes in the context of a rare disease and safety as well as the 
immunological profile of Ruconest in particular in relation to development of neutralizing antibodies against 
C1 inhibitor is further under assessment within an ongoing PASS as described in the risk management plan.  
The overall benefit-risk balance is considered to be positive.

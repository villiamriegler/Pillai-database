2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Nexpovio was proposed to be indicated in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, who have received three prior lines of therapy 
including an anti-CD38 antibody, a proteasome inhibitor, and an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a rare and incurable disease of the plasma cells which typically affects adults 
who are more than 60 years of age (median age is at diagnosis is ~ 70 years). It is the second most 
common haematological malignancy (after non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [NHL]), representing 1% of all 
cancers and 2% of all cancer deaths. In 2018, the estimated annual, age-standardised, MM incidence 
rate worldwide was 1.7 per 100,000 (Ferlay, 2019). Progress has been made over the last 15 years in 
the treatment of multiple myeloma, such that survival of patients with newly diagnosed multiple 
myeloma has increased from approximately 3 years in the years 1985 to 1998 (Kyle 2003) to 6 to 10 
years (Moreau 2015). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Multiple myeloma is characterised by marrow plasmacytomas (plasma cell tumours) and 
overproduction of monoclonal immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgD or IgE) or Bence-Jones protein 
(monoclonal K or h light chains), while the production of normal immunoglobulin is impaired. 
Based on karyotype, MM is classified as nonhyperdiploid and hyperdiploid, with the latter accounting 
for 50% to 60% of cases and characterised by trisomies in odd chromosomes. MM has a 
heterogeneous progression pathway, whereby several MM cell subclones coexist at baseline and 
compete for dominance over time, leading to the evolution of drug-resistance clones [Laubach, 2014]. 
Thus, drug resistance to prior regimens in patients with relapsed/refractory (RR) MM is due to 
continuous changes in the disease biology, in which a higher proportion of malignant cells are 
expressing a more aggressive, highly proliferative phenotype over time (Anderson, 2008). Therapies 
with a multi-modal mechanism of action (MoA), that both target MM cells and elicit an immunogenic 
response are expected to minimise development of drug resistance in MM. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The clinical features of MM are varied and can arise from the effects of the tumour itself, or the toxicity 
of the tumour products, or the host's own immune response. 
The most common symptoms include persistent skeletal pain (especially pain in the back or thorax), 
pathological fractures and vertebral collapse, anaemia, renal impairment, hypercalcaemia and 
recurrent or persistent bacterial infections. Approximately 20% of patients are asymptomatic at the 
time of diagnosis. 
The most common criteria used in diagnosis of symptomatic MM is the presence of neoplastic plasma 
cells comprising greater than 10% of BM cells or presence of a plasmacytoma; paraprotein (M-protein) 
Assessment report

in the serum and/or urine; and evidence of related organ or tissue impairment due to plasma cell 
disorder. 
The International Staging System (ISS) is used for prognosis and it was revised by The International 
Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) including cytogenetics by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) 
and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, Revised International Staging System for Multiple Myeloma, R-ISS), 
and is now widely accepted (Palumbo, 2015). At the time of diagnosis, patients are typically 
categorised according to R-ISS, their age, comorbidity and their suitability for intensive treatment. 
Despite advance in therapy, MM remains incurable. All patients eventually relapse and with each 
successive relapse, the chance of response and duration of response typically decreases and ultimately 
the disease becomes refractory and results in cumulative end organ damage (e.g. renal, cytopenias, 
infections and bone complications). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Current treatment of MM includes glucocorticoids (dexamethasone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone), 
chemotherapy, primarily alkylating agents, including high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous 
stem cell rescue (ASCT), proteasome inhibitors (PIs) (such as bortezomib, carfilzomib and ixazomib),  
immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs) (such as thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide) and the 
anti-CD38 mAB daratumumab. Other approved anti-MM agents are only approved in combinations, all 
of which have shown activity only when used in combination with a PI or IMiD.  
The choice of therapy in the relapse setting depends on several parameters such as age, performance 
status, comorbidities, the type, efficacy and tolerance of the previous treatment, the number of prior 
treatment lines, the available remaining treatment options, the interval since the last therapy and the 
type of relapse.  
In very advanced-stage disease, two other drugs are approved in EU for the treatment of relapsed MM:  
• 
Pomalidomide, the third-in-class IMiD, in combination with low-dose dexamethasone, is 
approved in patients who have received at least two prior therapies, including both lenalidomide and 
bortezomib, and whose disease progressed after treatment.  
• 
Daratumumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD38, was also approved for the treatment of 
adults with relapsed/refractory MM whose previous treatment included a proteasome inhibitor and an 
immunomodulatory agent and whose disease worsened after treatment. 
With the approval of daratumumab and its wide use in combinations in earlier lines of MM treatment, a 
new population of patients is created who have become refractory to all available agents (including 
daratumumab). This population can be referred to as triple-class refractory MM and it encompasses 
those patients with disease refractory to at least 1 PI, 1 IMiD, and an anti-CD38 mAb (such as 
daratumumab). These patients have generally been exposed to all 5 drugs that have demonstrated 
single-agent effect (with or without glucocorticoids), including bortezomib, carfilzomib, lenalidomide, 
pomalidomide, and daratumumab. Most of these patients have already received alkylating agent 
therapy, other anti-MM drugs, as well as multiple courses of glucocorticoids, they also have numerous 
comorbidities and receive multiple concomitant medications. 
Considering that there are no available agents of proven clinical benefit for the treatment of patients 
with triple-class refractory (PIs, IMiDs, and anti-CD38 mAbs) MM, thus there is a clear unmet medical 
need in this setting.

About the product 
Selinexor is an oral, first-in-class, slowly reversible covalent, potent selective inhibition of nuclear 
export (SINE) compound that specifically blocks exportin 1 (XPO1). Exportin 1 mediates the export of 
many proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, including major tumour suppressor proteins, and cell 
cycle and regulators leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells (sparing normal cells). 
Exportin 1 is elevated (2- to 4-fold) in all tumour types tested, including MM, and higher XPO1 levels 
have been demonstrated to be correlated with poor prognosis and/or resistance to chemotherapies. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The  CHMP  agreed  to  the  applicant’s  request  for  an  accelerated  assessment  as  the  product  was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the clinical studies submitted for 
selinexor. Selinexor in combination with dexamethasone has shown a promising antitumour activity in 
patients  considered  refractory  to  PI,  IMiD  and  daratumumab.  Taking  into  account  the  current 
armamentarium of MM and the very few options available in those patients considered penta-exposed, 
triple-class  refractory,  as  well  as  the  clinical  activity  of  the  oral  XPO1  inhibitor  in  this  population, 
selinexor is deemed to have the potential to address the unmet medical and to be of major interest 
from the point of view of public health.  
However, during assessment the CHMP concluded that it was no longer appropriate to pursue 
accelerated assessment, as the applicant requested an extended clock-stop to respond to the List of 
outstanding Issues. 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. The applicant states that 
the results from the global phase 3 randomised, active comparator-controlled clinical trial will 
be available in a timely manner. The phase 3 (BOSTON) study compare the efficacy and assess 
the safety of selinexor plus bortezomib plus low-dose dexamethasone (SVd) versus bortezomib 
plus low dose dexamethasone (Vd) in 402 adult patients with RRMM who have received 1 to 3 
prior anti-MM regimens. After PD is confirmed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC), 
patients in the Vd arm may cross over to SVd or Sd treatment. Progression-free survival is the 
primary endpoint. Patients will be followed for survival until the end of the study. This study will 
be completed as a confirmatory study and will mainly provide comparative safety data. It will 
provide less support from an efficacy perspective considering that Sd is given in combination 
with bortezomib in a prior line of treatment but overall results from the BOSTON study could 
suffice to address remaining uncertainties and to allow the switch from CMA to full approval for 
Sd in the applied indication. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as during clinical studies the ORR was 25.3% in patients 
with penta-refractory multiple myeloma. This is selinexor target patient population for which no 
other approved therapies exists. Despite the increased number of effective treatment options in 
the last 20 years, multiple myeloma remains incurable, and nearly all patients will eventually 
relapse and develop disease that is refractory to all approved anti-MM therapies that have 
demonstrated clinical benefit in randomised trials. In addition, with each subsequent line of 
therapy, the duration of response becomes increasingly shorter. As no therapy, including the 
recently approved belantamab mafodotin, is curative or even effective for the entire population, 
essentially all patients with MM will eventually need further therapies. Without new therapies

targeting novel mechanisms, these patients quickly succumb to the disease. Therefore, there 
continues to be a high unmet medical need for new therapies, particularly those with novel 
mechanisms that can induce rapid disease control and responses in patients with MM whose 
disease is refractory to the available classes of drugs. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of selinexor is (2Z)-3-{3-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl}-
N'-(pyrazin-2-yl)prop-2-enehydrazide corresponding to the molecular formula C17H11F6N7O. It has a 
molecular mass of 443.31 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
Full information on the active substance has been provided in the dossier. The chemical structure of 
selinexor was inferred from the route of synthesis and elucidated by a combination of Fourier-
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), elemental 
analysis, high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) absorption 
spectroscopy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 15/138 
 
 
 
 
 
The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) 
analysis, single crystal x-ray diffraction (SCXRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), analysis by 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) and differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC). 
The active substance is a white to off-white powder. It is non-hygroscopic, and is hydrophobic. 
Hygroscopicity is not considered a critical quality attribute. Selinexor has minor light sensitivity and it 
has a non-chiral molecular structure. 
Selinexor is the cis (Z) olefin isomer (2Z)-3-{3-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl}-
N'-(pyrazin-2-yl)prop-2-enehydrazide. The amount of trans isomer in the active substance is also 
monitored in the release specifications via the ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) 
related substances/total purity method. 
Selinexor exhibits pH dependent solubility in aqueous media. At the highest therapeutic dose strength 
(100 mg), selinexor is not soluble in 250 mL or less in HCl solutions and aqueous media (pH 1.0, 3.0, 
5.0, and 7.4) at 37 °C. Solubility values ranged from a low of ~9 μg/mL at pH 7.4 to a high of ~144 
μg/mL at pH 1.0. The minimum amount of aqueous media at 37 °C to solubilise 100 mg of selinexor is 
>690 mL (at pH 1.0). 
A permeation assay study was performed on selinexor using metoprolol and atenolol as high and low 
permeability control compounds in Caco-2 cells. Results indicated that, once in solution, selinexor 
bioavailability was not limited by its permeability. Selinexor is determined to be a low solubility, high 
permeability drug (BCS class 2). 
Polymorphism has been observed for selinexor. All selinexor active substance used throughout the 
development and manufactured for human use has been in the most stable polymorph, form A. This 
form has suitable flow properties for a dry granulation tablet formulation, and it is controlled in the 
active substance specifications. 
Form A is the most thermodynamically stable and the dominant form arising from aqueous and non-
aqueous solvent mixtures except acetonitrile (ACN) and nitromethane which form solvates (Forms D 
and E respectively). Form D is a weakly bound ACN solvate. Drying and thermal experiments were 
found to convert Form D to metastable partially crystalline Forms B (MP ~91 ºC) and C (MP~155 ºC). 
Forms B and C thermally convert to Form A in the solid state with heating and in all cross-slurry 
experiments. Aqueous solubility data on Forms B, C, and D, are not available due in part to their rapid 
conversion to Form A under aqueous solvent conditions. Form D is isolated as an intermediate in the 
manufacture of selinexor because it can be isolated from acetonitrile in which relevant impurities are 
sufficiently soluble to be purged. 
After ACN crystallisation of the active substance, Form D is isolated and dried, and is readily converted 
to Form A in an isopropyl alcohol/water solvent mixture. The properties of crystalline Form A are such 
that the finished product manufacturing conditions are not expected to impact the polymorphic form. 
The finished product is manufactured using a dry granulation process without solvents. 
Polymorph is a critical quality attribute and is controlled at the active substance specification and has 
been monitored during finished product stability studies. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is obtained from a single manufacturer. 
The manufacturing process for selinexor consists of four stages using well defined starting materials 
with acceptable specifications: stage E2 (triazole annulation), stage A1/A2 (conjugate addition and 
saponification), stage A3 (amide coupling) and stage A4 (polymorph conversion).

Numerous structural alerts exist for potential impurities of the active substance, including those 
impurities found (actual or potential) in KPT-459, the starting material introduced in the last synthetic 
step. A major objection was raised during the procedure regarding designation of this starting material. 
The applicant has provided sufficient data to demonstrate that the overall control strategy is adequate 
and capable to producing an active substance of high quality, fully in line with ICH Q3A and ICH M7 
guidelines, without re-defining this starting material as an intermediate.  
The critical part of the acceptance is related to use of KPT-459 in the non-pharmaceutical market. 
There are numerous suppliers that provide KPT-459 in kilogram quantities for use in non-
pharmaceutical markets.  
In addition, the synthesis of KPT-459 and the manufacturing process of the active substance are 
sufficiently understood, and all the controls needed have been implemented in order to obtain a 
selinexor active substance of sufficient quality from the starting KPT-459 material. The proposed 
starting material KPT-459 is therefore acceptable. Starting materials KPT-482 and KPT-472 are 
introduced early in the synthesis with sufficient number of steps post-introduction and are also in line 
with ICH Q11. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and 
control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Regarding genotoxic impurities, initial assessments were performed using a QSAR software 
(LeadScope) and positive findings were assessed by Ames testing. Several impurities were assessed as 
LeadScope positive but classified as non-mutagenic based upon their structural relationship to a 
compound which had been determined to be non-mutagenic through Ames testing. An additional 
assessment using theoretical purge factors was completed allowing no additional controls for these 
impurities which are controlled according to ICH M7 option 4.  
The proposed specification limits for individual potentially mutagenic impurities are below the 
acceptable intake calculated according to ICH M7 methodology. Suitably sensitive analytical methods 
have been developed and validated for these impurities, with acceptable LOD and LOQ. Testing results 
for registration and validation batches are satisfactory. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have 
been justified.  
A risk-based approach is used for the development of the selinexor manufacturing process. The 
manufacturing process does not include any design spaces; however, aspects of an enhanced approach 
including the definition of critical quality attributes (CQAs), risk assessment, design of experiments 
(DoE) and determination of proven acceptable ranges (PARs) are employed. Finally, a control strategy 
is defined to ensure process performance and active substance quality. The Applicant ensures that “the 
manufacturing process will be conducted within the normal operating ranges (NORs) for all process 
parameters, with excursions into the PAR for only a single parameter at a time”. 
The active substance is packaged in double linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) bags placed into a 
heat-sealed  foil  pouch  and  then  into  a  high-density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  drum  closed  with  a  gasket-
lined, HDPE screw cap. Primary packaging material complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 
10/2011 as amended. 
Specification

The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (visual), identification (IR, UHPLC, 
XRPD), assay (UHPLC), related substances (UHPLC), residual reagents (GC) residual solvents (GC), 
residual hydrazine content (HPLC), residual KPT-459, KPT-534, and KPT-548 (LC-MS), residual KPT 
460, and KPT-550 (LC-MS), total GTI/PGI residuals (LC-MS), water content (KF), elemental impurities 
(ICP-MS), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), particle size distribution (light diffraction) and microbial 
quality (Ph. Eur.). 
The active substance specifications are based on the active substance CQAs. The CQAs identified are: 
identification, assay, related substances, specified and unspecified impurities, residual reagent N,N-
diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), residual solvents, residual hydrazine, residual product-related 
impurities and total GTI/PGI residuals, elemental impurities, crystalline form, and container closure. 
All possible process impurities in the synthesis of selinexor which were found to be Ames positive and 
are categorised by ICH M7(R1) consensus as mutagenic class 2. In addition, the known class 1 
carcinogen, hydrazine, is a reagent in the manufacturing process. 
Liquid chromatography – mass spectroscopy/mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) methods have been 
developed and validated to monitor the limits of the five 5 Ames positive impurities of selinexor. 
Specifications have been set and are monitored in the registration stability testing. 
The current limits for individual genotoxic impurities in selinexor were calculated according to a 
chemical-specific risk assessment. The limits are based on an excess cancer risk of 10-5, taking into 
consideration the potential benefit of the drug and the nature of the patient population (i.e., patients 
with advanced haematological malignancies). While the ICH M7 guidance, Assessment and Control of 
DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals to Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, 
specifically excludes agents intended for the treatment of advanced cancer as part of its scope, the 
principles contained in this guidance were considered in the current assessment of selinexor. 
The total genotoxic/potential genotoxic impurities limit for the six (6) priority impurities has been set. 
Based on ICH M7(R1) guidance, the proposed calculation and limit is well justified and represents a 
tighter specification than the ICH M7 allowable total. It ensures tighter control than the sum of the 
allowable individual limits, and that no combination of impurities within specification or below the LOQ 
can result in a sum greater than the guidance limit. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on three consecutive commercial scale batches of the active substance are 
provided. In addition, results for batches manufactured by the previous manufacturer used for clinical 
and development studies have also been provided. Batch results indicate a consistent production 
process. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 4 pilot and 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) 
and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, identification and polymorphic identity, assay, 
individual impurities, total impurities, water content, product-related impurities, microbial limit test and

specified microorganism. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and are stability 
indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. No significant changes or trends were observed. 
Samples were also stored under stressed conditions (100 °C / ambient (RH) for 24 hours, high 
heat/humidity at 50 °C / 75% RH, high heat at 60 °C. KPT-375 was the only potential degradation 
product that was produced in the forced degradation studies. It was also observed in very small 
amounts (0.05-0.09% w/w) under long-term storage conditions up to 48 months and under 
accelerated storage conditions up to 6 months for both registration and stability batches. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on a single batch. The results 
from the photostability studies indicate that selinexor is slightly susceptible to light and that protective 
packaging should be used for storage. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period and storage conditions “do 
not store above 25 ºC” in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is formulated as immediate release tablets for oral administration. Nexpovio 
tablets are blue, bi-convex, round, film coated tablets with “K20” debossed on one side and nothing on 
the other. Tablets are 4 mm thick and 7 mm in diameter. 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. 
The CQAs identified were crystalline/polymorph form of selinexor in the tablet, identification, assay, 
impurities and degradants, content uniformity, dissolution, and microbial burden. 
The physicochemical properties of the active substance that could influence the performance of the 
finished product and its manufacturability were identified and discussed. 
Selinexor exhibits poor aqueous solubility and rapid transport across membranes. Research and 
development tablets were manufactured with active substance of various particle size distribution 
profiles in order to obtain different dissolution or drug release profiles.   
In general, active substance particle size and particle size distribution can lead to content uniformity 
and flow-related processing issues. Although selinexor is not milled, it represents 12.5% of the tablet 
formulation, and the tablets are manufactured using a dry granulation process that can minimise the 
impact of selinexor particle size and particle size distribution on downstream processing. Particle size 
and particle size distribution within the proposed limit was not identified as a CQA for selinexor tablets. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards with the exception of Opadry 200 Clear and Opadry II Blue. However, these two non-
compendial film coating materials are well-known and composed of only compendial components. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included 
in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The compatibility of selinexor with the excipients has been demonstrated. Multiple binary mixture 
studies between selinexor and excipients of the tablet formulation were performed under accelerated 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 19/138 
 
 
 
 
 
conditions to evaluate the compatibility of the excipients with the active substance. Results indicated 
minimal or no impurity formation of selinexor with the tablet excipients. 
The formulation and manufacturing development have been evaluated through the use of risk 
assessment and design of experiments to identify the critical product quality attributes and critical 
process parameters. A risk analysis was performed using the failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) 
method in order to define critical process steps and process parameters that may have an influence on 
the finished product quality attributes. The risk identification was based on the prior knowledge of 
products with similar formulations and manufacturing processes as well as on the experience from 
formulation development, process design and scale-up studies. The critical process parameters have 
been adequately identified. Design of experiments (DoE) studies were conducted on the dry 
granulation formulation to evaluate the effects of the selected excipients on the manufacturability and 
CQAs of selinexor tablets. 
During development, two different finished product manufacturers were involved. Selinexor 
formulations developed for clinical studies through commercial scale included capsules, wet granulated 
tablets (Tablet Formulation 1 or TF1) and dry granulated tablets (Tablet Formulation 2 or TF2). All 
three formulations met with acceptance criteria for release and stability and demonstrated equivalent 
pharmacokinetic parameters in humans (comparative Phase I bioavailability clinical study in patients). 
The Opadry II Blue 85F90982 film coat used in the TF2 formulation (designated TF2.2) contains FD&C 
Yellow #5 (tartrazine aluminium lake), an ingredient that may cause allergic reactions. Therefore, a 
tartrazine-free Opadry II Blue (85F90892) film coat was selected for the commercial finished product 
formulation, designated TF2.3. The presence or absence of tartrazine aluminium lake does not affect 
the dissolution of selinexor tablet, or the stability of the product. The two formulation variants are 
considered equivalent. 
During product development, high speed homogenised/freeze-dried selinexor capsules, low-shear wet 
granulation tablets (TF1), high-shear wet granulation tablets, and dry granulation tablets (TF2) were 
evaluated. The high speed homogenised/freeze-dried selinexor capsules and low-shear wet granulation 
tablets (TF1) were manufactured to support the early phase clinical studies. Ultimately, the dry 
granulation tablets (TF2) final formulation was developed and manufactured at clinical, pilot and 
commercial scales to support expanded clinical studies, registration stability studies, and product 
commercialisation. 
For an active substance of low solubility and high permeability, the disintegration and dissolution rate 
of the tablet may impact the rate the absorption and bioavailability. Therefore, Nexpovio 20 mg film-
coated tablets were designed to disintegrate rapidly in the stomach and upper gastrointestinal tract to 
ensure absorption. The dissolution method uses a Ph. Eur. paddle apparatus. At the request of CHMP, 
the dissolution limit was tightened to Q=80% in 30 minutes during the procedure, in order to ensure 
that the method is sufficiently discriminatory and appropriate for control of the finished product. 
Although a predictive relationship between in vitro dissolution of selinexor tablet and in vivo response 
has not be established, a highly discriminating dissolution method has been developed which is 
sufficiently able to discriminate between physical changes in the finished product (e.g. varying active 
substance particle sizes, exclusion of disintegrant excipient, varying lubricant level and lubrication 
blend time). 
The primary packaging is PVC/PCTFE/PVC-aluminium blisters. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and 
EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Nexpovio is formulated as an immediate release film-coated tablet and manufactured using a typical dry 
granulation process. The manufacturing process consists of six main steps: pre-compaction de-lumping 
/ blending, dry granulation, final blending, tablet compression, tablet coating and packaging. The process 
is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies  on  three 
commercial  scale  batches.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance  (visual),  package  appearance  (visual),  identification  (HPLC-UV,  HPLC),  assay  (HPLC), 
impurities  (HPLC),  content  uniformity  (HPLC),  dissolution  (HPLC),  water  content  (KF),  microbial 
enumeration test (Ph. Eur.) and tests for specified microorganisms (Ph. Eur.). 
A test for hardness is not included in the finished product specifications as hardness is not considered a 
CQA for Nexpovio film-coated tablets. This test is conducted as an in-process control on the tablet 
cores during tablet compression. Throughout development, the variation of tablet hardness did not 
show an effect on dissolution parameters. 
With the use of the thermodynamically favoured Form A and no observed change in polymorphic form 
during the finished product stability studies, it was not necessary to set testing and acceptance criteria 
for the polymorph identity in the release specifications. 
Based on risk assessment, the testing of residual solvents content in the finished product does not add 
to the control of quality for Nexpovio 20 mg tablets and, in accordance with ICH Q3C, testing for 
residual solvents is not proposed as part of the finished product batch release specification. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in 
the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed as requested considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions 
and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed 
necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided for two commercial scale batches of the intended commercial 
formulation. Supportive data from 28 development batches was also provided and the results confirm 
the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
Assessment report

The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three pilot scale batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under long 
term conditions (5ºC / 60% RH, 25ºC / 60% RH and 30ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Additional supportive data was presented from three commercial scale batches stored for up to 6 months 
under  long  term  conditions  (5ºC  /  60%  RH,  25ºC  /  60%  RH  and  30ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  accelerated 
conditions (40ºC / 75% RH). 
Further supportive data was presented on 2 pilot scale batches and 2 commercial scale batches stored 
for  up  to  48  months  under  long  term  conditions  (5ºC  /  60%  RH,  25ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  intermediate 
conditions (30ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH).  
All of the above-mentioned batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing 
and were packed in the primary packaging representative to the one proposed for marketing. 
Samples  were  tested  for  the  same  parameters  as  for  release,  except  for  content  uniformity.  The 
analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
All stability study results demonstrate the chemical and physical stability of selinexor tablets under all 
storage conditions. The results of long-term and accelerated stability studies demonstrate the chemical 
and  physical  stability  of  selinexor  tablets  when  stored  for  up  to  44  months  under  long-term  and 
intermediate  conditions  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  storage  conditions.  There  were  no 
significant changes or trends observed in the physical appearance, assay, polymorphic identity, drug-
related impurities, hardness, dissolution or water content in the long-term studies and all results were 
within specifications. 
Nexpovio tablets in bulk configuration demonstrated stability for up to 36 months for registration batches 
at controlled room temperature and up to 3 months at 40°C / 75% RH. There were no significant changes 
or  trends  observed  in  the  physical  appearance,  assay,  polymorphic  identity,  drug-related  impurities, 
hardness, dissolution or water content in the long-term studies and all results were within specifications.  
In addition to the long-term studies, data were presented following short-term storage of the finished 
product under a range of stressed conditions. Samples were exposed to a range of conditions including 
thermal  stress  (60°C/Ambient  RH),  acid/base  hydrolysis,  H2O2  oxidation,  intense  light  to  determine 
photostability, freeze-thaw temperature cycling, high heat/humidity and in open bottles. There were no 
significant differences between the peak purity results from the control and stressed samples, indicating 
that there were no degradation products generated under these stress conditions, the finished product 
is considered stable under each of these conditions. Forced degradation studies on selinexor tablets were 
performed both in the solid and solution phase.  
The  results  of  studies  with  finished  product  packaged  in  blisters  and  exposed  to  stressed  conditions 
including high heat/humidity and high heat were consistent and met specifications. The results from the 
freeze-thaw temperature cycling stability study indicate that the finished product remains of high quality 
when exposed to environments that include temperature cycles of extreme cold (-20°C) and high heat 
and humidity (40°C / 75% RH) when packaged in either blister or bulk packaging. These data support 
the choice of the bulk and blister packaging as a robust proposed commercial packaging system.

A photostability study was performed on selinexor stored in blister packages with dark control samples 
overwrapped with aluminum foil. At the end of the 8-day photostability study under ICH Q1B Option 2 
conditions (LUX/UV light conditions (fluorescent light (NLT 1.2 million lux-hours) and UV light (NLT 200 
watt hours/m2) there was very little difference between the results of the dark control and exposed test 
materials. All results were found to be well within specifications. The results from the photostability study 
indicate that the finished product is not sensitive to light exposure and does not require special packaging 
to protect it from light. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months as stated in the SmPC (section 
6.3) is acceptable. This medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. Magnesium stearate is of herbal 
origin.

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Primary and secondary pharmacology studies described in this section were conducted in accordance 
with accepted practice for these study types and in general agreement with the principles of Good 
Laboratory Practice (GLP). 
The effect of selinexor was shown both in vitro and in vivo studies in different experimental models of 
cancer. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The pharmacodynamic studies were conducted to show the potential pharmacological actions of 
selinexor via binding to XPO1, inhibition of XPO1-mediated nuclear transport of tumour suppressor 
proteins and growth regulatory proteins; and cycle arrest and killing of tumour cells. The 
pharmacological characterisation was based on both in vitro and in vivo experimental models. 
• 
In vitro studies 
Selinexor (KPT-330) has been developed as an oral specific inhibitor of exportin-1 (XPO-1), a protein 
that mediates the nuclear export of proteins and RNA. XPO-1 binds cooperatively to proteins containing 
a nuclear export sequence (NES), including a variety of transcription factors and tumour suppressor 
proteins (TSPs). Overexpression of XPO1 has been suggested to occur in a variety of malignancies 
including multiple myeloma where it has been linked to resistance to therapy and poor survival. It is 
hypothesised that inhibition of XPO-1 by selinexor will lead to the nuclear accumulation of TSPs, such 
as p53, resulting in the growth arrest and cell death of the cancer cells. 
XPO1 occupancy by selinexor in in-vitro experimental systems was estimated to be about 50% and 
90% of at 20 nM and 480 nM, respectively. These levels of occupancy were obtained in murine PBMC 
after treatment of animals with 3 mg/Kg and 10 mg/Kg, respectively. As part of the in vitro 
characterisation, selinexor induced the nuclear localisation of TSPs and GRPs (p53, p21, FOXO3a, APC, 
FOXO1a, IκB, p27, PP2Aα, and Survivin) and the inhibition of proto-oncogenic mRNAs (cyclin D, cyclin 
E, Pim1, ODC, c-Myc, Bcl-2 and Bcl-6) regulated by eIF4E. An additional action was also proposed by 
decreasing DNA synthesis and inducing cell cycle arrest. An increase of XPO1 mRNA levels, which was 
not accompanied by XPO1 protein expression was shown. It is noted that selinexor induced XPO1 
protein degradation, reported as proteasome-mediated degradation (Tai et al., 2014).  
The Applicant justified the dose level of 60 to 80 mg in humans based on the occupancy level of XPO1 
receptor reported in mice. According to the data provided, the dose level of 10 mg/Kg in mice (30 
mg/m2) given three times weekly, corresponds to the human dose of 50 mg, which exhibited a 90% of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 24/138 
 
 
 
 
receptor occupancy of XPO1 for 6 hours post dose. However, most studies presented were conducted 
in mice at the dose level of 5 mg/Kg showing efficacy, although a significant reduction in body weight 
was also observed. Moreover, the applicant proposed to use XPO1 mRNA induction as a biomarker of 
the activity for selinexor, although this effect was not followed by protein expression. Maximum activity 
was shown at 12 mg/m2 (study KS-50001). The Applicant reported that the increase in mRNA is a 
biological feedback loop in response to the inhibition of nuclear export.  
The cytotoxic effect of selinexor on cancer cell lines was observed in: multiple myeloma; Non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma; and acute myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells. The 
results showed IC50 values ranged from 20 to 434 nM; 12 to 441 nM; and from 21 to 203 nM, 
respectively. In the case of multiple myeloma cells, the applicant proposed two additional actions of 
selinexor based on publications. One of them was the stabilisation of IκB-α by inhibiting its 
phosphorylation and degradation, resulting in the inhibition of NF-κB transcription activity. The other 
one was an increase in GR protein levels, resulting in the inhibition of the mitogenic and inflammatory 
NF-κB pathway. 
• 
In vivo studies 
Pharmacodynamic effects of selinexor were shown in in-vivo models of cancer, both as single agent 
and in combination with other anticancer agents. Selinexor was tested in MM1.S or H929 myeloma 
cells in NOD-SCID mice. When used as a single agent at doses ≥15 mg/kg twice or three times weekly, 
selinexor was seen to inhibit the observed growth of the implanted tumours. Selinexor alone dosed at 
5 mg/kg (3 times weekly) did not modulate tumour growth, however, when used in addition to 
dexamethasone the combination effectively prevented growth of both MM1.S or H929 melanoma 
tumours in NOD-SCID mice. Moreover, effects on tumour growth of selinexor with lenalidomide and 
with the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib was seen in the same study of MM1.S tumours in NOD-SCID 
mice (KS-0070). No survival data or Kaplan Meier curves have been presented. Mouse models of 
haematological malignancies (Mantle Cell Lymphoblastoid Lymphoma (Z-138), Acute Lymphoblastic 
Leukaemia (MOLT-4), AML (MV-4-11), or AML (MOLM-16)) were also used to test the effects of 
selinexor. In all of them, treatment with selinexor induced the reduction of tumour volume, although 
significant weight loss was also reported as indicative of toxicity.  
The other part of the in vivo studies was related to the results obtained with other treatments 
(dexamethasone, lenalidomide, proteasome inhibitors or panobinostat) in combination with selinexor in 
multiple myeloma mouse models. In all of them, treatment with selinexor in combination resulted in an 
increased reduction of tumour volume. It should be noted that animals receiving selinexor as 
monotherapy showed less significant body weight reduction than in the case of the combination with 
dexamethasone. However, contradictory effects on body weight were observed in animals dosed with 
selinexor as monotherapy or KPT-330 plus dexamethasone in studies KS-0085 and KS-0070.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Selinexor was tested in other potential pharmacological effects than the primary pharmacodynamics 
actions described in the previous section. In this regard, its selectivity was profiled in 112 human and 
rat receptor-binding or enzymatic assays (study KS-0034). The final concentration was 10µM and 
tested in duplicate. In addition, two functional assays were incorporated to the secondary 
pharmacodynamic studies (KS-0065 and KS-0066). 
Activity of selinexor was detected in the case of: Kinase Protein AurA (Aur2/STK6) (h) 40%; Kinase 
Protein p70s6k (h) 42%; and Oxidase, MAO-B, Central 50%. According to the screening assays 
interpretation, compounds showing inhibition of 50% or greater could be qualified. The Applicant 
conducted a study in which selinexor was tested in a MAO-B recombinant enzyme assay (KS-0066). No 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 25/138 
 
 
 
 
IC50 was estimated, as concentration-response curve showed less than 25% effect at the highest 
validated testing concentration. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies were conducted with selinexor, in line with ICH S9 guideline. Additional 
endpoints were incorporated in the repeated dose toxicity studies. 
Cardiovascular system 
In vitro: the effect of selinexor on hERG current was evaluated in a GLP-compliant study (KS-0055). 
hERG current was significantly inhibited by selinexor (p<0.05) when compared to control group ([mean
±SEM] 3.9±0.8% at 1 µM (n=3), 10.4±0.8% at 3 µM (n=3), 31.4±1.1% at 10 µM (n=3), and 60.1±
0.5% at 30 µM (n=3) versus 0.8±0.3% (n=5) in control). Under identical conditions, the positive 
control (60 nM terfenadine) inhibited hERG potassium current by [mean±standard deviation (SD)] 
87.8±4.3% (n=2). The IC50 for the inhibitory effect of selinexor on hERG potassium current was 20.6 
µM (Hill coefficient=1.1). The Applicant estimated >250 times safety margins based on the human free 
unbound Cmax following an 80 mg dose (0.033 µg/mL; based on human plasma protein binding of 
95.1% and mean Cmax of 0.68 µg/mL). 
In vivo: potential in vivo actions of selinexor on cardiovascular system were incorporated in the GLP 4-
week (KS-0047) and 13-week (KNC-G-13-002) toxicity studies in monkeys. No effects were observed 
on cardiovascular function in both studies at the maximum dose level tested, i.e. selinexor at ≤3mg/Kg 
given 3 times weekly in the 4-week study (combined sex mean AUClast of 5.89 µg.hr/mL and mean 
Cmax of 0.83 µg/mL); and selinexor at ≤1mg/Kg/day given 2-3 days per week (combined sex mean 
AUClast of 1.51 µg.hr/mL and mean Cmax of 0.24 µg/mL). 
Central Nervous system 
Selinexor (0, 2, 10, or 50 mg/kg) was orally given (single-dose) to male rats in a GLP study (KS-0051) 
to evaluate the effects on CNS through the Irwin test. No effect was reported at the lowest dose levels, 
i.e. 2 and 10 mg/Kg. On the contrary, animals given with 50 mg/Kg exhibited a significant decrease of 
body temperature (0.9ºC; p<0.05) and respiratory difficulty. The Applicant attributed this effect to the 
reduction in pyrogenic cytokines (IL-1, IL6 or TNF-α). NOEL value was established at 10 mg/Kg. 
Respiratory system 
Respiratory function (respiratory frequency, tidal volume, and minute volume) was evaluated after 
administration of a single-dose of selinexor in a non-GLP study (KS-0054). Male rats received selinexor 
at 0, 2, 10 or 50 mg/Kg. The Applicant considered the NOEL value 2 mg/Kg, given that a dose-
dependent significant reduction (p<0.05) in minute volume, respiratory frequency, and tidal volume 
was observed at ≥10mg/Kg. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic (PD) drug interaction studies with selinexor have been submitted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption, elimination, metabolism and biodistribution properties were studied in in vitro and in vivo 
models. Pharmacokinetic profile of selinexor was analysed in mouse, rat, dog and monkey, both in 
single- and repeated-dose studies. Additional in vitro studies were conducted to further characterise 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 26/138 
 
 
 
 
the properties of selinexor. In this regard, permeability was evaluated in Caco-2 cells, plasma protein 
binding and in vitro metabolism were also analysed. 
The applicant has presented a summary of the methods used for the analysis of selinexor 
concentrations in both rat and monkey plasma samples. Validation was undertaken in compliance to 
GLP standards and is broadly in line with the EMA ‘Guideline on bioanalytical method validation’ 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2). Analyte concentrations are expressed in terms of 
ng/ml.  
In terms of potential permeability, the applicant reported selinexor as not a substrate for P-gp or BCRP 
in the pharmacokinetics written summary.  
Single dose studies were conducted in mouse, rat, dog and monkey. In the case of monkeys, the 
potential effect of formulation changes and food on pharmacokinetic parameters were analysed. It was 
concluded that food could affect Cmax and Tmax parameters, by increasing Tmax and reducing Cmax, but it 
did not modify significantly the exposure (AUC) in monkeys. Tablets and gelatine capsules containing 
selinexor also showed different Cmax and Tmax, although overall exposure was not significantly modified. 
Repeated dose toxicokinetic studies were carried out in satellite groups of animals. A dose dependent 
increases in systemic exposure were observed in these studies. No or moderate accumulation was 
observed after repeated dose in monkeys and rats treated for 13 weeks.  
PPB studies showed that protein binding of KPT-330 was independent of concentration. The results 
indicated high bound to proteins in all the species tested (>95%), except in dogs. Given that blood to 
plasma ratio was less than 1, selinexor is suggested not to be sequestered into red blood cells.  
Biodistribution of selinexor after oral administration was assessed in a tissue distribution study (KS-
0091). It exhibited the highest levels of radioactivity in small intestine, kidney, stomach, and liver. The 
lowest level was quantified in skin, uveal tract, spinal cord, testis, bone and eye. Double-peak levels 
reported in some tissues were attributed to the enterohepatic recirculation by the applicant.  
Main metabolites were studied in rats, monkeys and humans. The GSH-related metabolites were 
majorly detected, with no pharmacological activity, although it is suggested that they contributed to 
the elimination route. The in vivo metabolism was proposed to be cytochrome-P450 mediated and 
conjugation (phase II) was identified as an important route of clearance.  
The applicant reported a possible involvement of CYP3A4 and multiple UGT enzymes in the metabolism 
of selinexor. As such, it is concluded that selinexor at a dose of 100 mg and Cmax value of 2 μM has 
the potential to inhibit intestinal CYP3A4.  
CYP inhibition studies revealed direct inhibition of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5- 
mediated testosterone 6β-hydroxylation with IC50 values of 24, ~ 50, 42, 35 and 24 μM, respectively. 
A biphasic response was seen when CYP3A4/5 was investigated with midazolam as substrate with 
apparent increases in activity up to 10 μM and then decreased activity at higher concentrations. This 
effect can be attributed to a possible allosteric interference with the metabolism of midazolam. Based 
on a Cmax of 2 μM the applicant has argued that selinexor has a low potential for drug interaction due 
to CYP inhibition.  
CYP induction was assessed at levels up to 10 µM owing to cytotoxicity at 30 µM and above. Induction 
of CYP1A2 was only seen in one of the hepatocyte cultures (HC10-23), however, the response occurred 
in a dose proportional manner in this culture and similarly in the HC7-12 cultures although at a very 
marginal level which didn’t reach significance. Of note is the very pronounced inhibition of CYP3A4 
expression on a mRNA level in 2 of the 3 hepatocyte cultures and to a lesser extent in the third 
culture. Although there does not appear to be a dose relationship the effects are very pronounced. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 27/138 
 
 
 
 
However, it is accepted that no accumulation of selinexor was seen following multiple dosing, which 
would support the conclusion that the decrease in mRNA has no in vivo implications.  
Studies on in vitro transporter inhibition revealed that selinexor was an inhibitor of OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, and MATE1 with IC50 values of 11.2, 6.20, 35.6, 11.2 and 22.3 μM, 
respectively. The Applicant calculated the potential for selinexor to inhibit various transporter in vivo 
based on the cut-offs as recommended in the EMA guidance. In this manner, it was concluded that 
there is no potential for selinexor to inhibit any of the investigated transporters in vivo. In vitro SLC 
transporter studies revealed selinexor as a weak substrate of BCRP.  
Bile was identified as the major excretory pathway, while urine and faeces were much minor pathways 
of excretion. It is supposed that excreted content in bile is returned to gastrointestinal tract and then 
excreted in faeces and urine. Regarding the content of bile, it had the highest levels of selinexor by 
comparison with urine and faeces, although the concentration of metabolites in bile was greater than 
selinexor. Additional studies reported that selinexor is minimally excreted in urine. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
The applicant determined the MTD value for selinexor at 100 mg/Kg in rat (AUClast= 65.9 μg*h/mL; 
Cmax= 15.9 μg/mL) administered by oral gavage (KS-0041, non-GLP). In this study, the dose levels 
≥100 mg/Kg produced diarrhoea, recovered on day 2. Microscopic findings (thinness of the GI tract 
and liquid in the stomach and intestine) were also reported at ≥100 mg/Kg. In the case of animals 
given at 500mg/Kg, diarrhoea was observed with decreased motor activity and piloerection. Thinness 
of the GI tract and liquid in the stomach and intestine, and stomach enlargement was also described. 
Clinical chemistry changes were observed at ≥25 mg/Kg. 
A summary of the single dose toxicity studies is included in the table below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 28/138 
 
 
 
 
Table 1 Single dose toxicity studies conducted with selinexor 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Pivotal GLP compliant studies of 4 and 13-week duration were performed in both species in line with the 
requirements  set  out  in  ICH  S9  for  therapies  for  the  treatment  of  advanced  cancers.  The  applicant 
established the NOAEL and STD10 values for selinexor in rats based on the findings reported in the 13-
week repeated dose toxicity study. As such, NOAEL was reported to be 0.25 mg/Kg/day for males and 
1 mg/Kg/day for females, which was hardly justified given the severity of the findings reported in the 
study report. In the case of STD10, it was considered to be between 1 and 4 mg/Kg/day in males and 
females  due  to  reproductive  organ  toxicity  (males:  testes,  epididymides,  and/or  seminal  vesicle 
macroscopic findings, lower organ weights, and microscopic findings; and females: macroscopic findings 
in the uterus, higher uterus weights, and microscopic findings in the ovaries, vagina, and uterus), which 
were not reversible. 
In  the  toxicity  studies  conducted  with  selinexor  in monkeys,  gastrointestinal toxicity,  decreased  body 
weight and food consumption, uncoordinated movements (day 7) and mortality (day 11) were reported 
at the dose level of 7.5 mg/Kg. A similar toxicity profile was also reported in another study carried out 
in monkeys dosed at 6 mg/Kg, in which moribundity and necrosis of granular cells were also observed. 
The  findings  reported  at  this  dose  could  be  indicating  a  central  nervous  system  related  toxicity.  In 
another toxicity study (KS-0047), the applicant considered 3 mg/Kg as the MTD for monkeys. However, 
unscheduled  mortality  and  sacrificed  animals  for  humane  reasons  were  reported  at  this  dose  level. 
Likewise,  in  this  study,  the  HNSTD  was  established  at  1.5  mg/Kg  where  severe  toxicological  findings 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 29/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were reported with no reversibility (high liver weights, high lipase and amylase values, or body weight 
loss). 
Similarly,  the  applicant  considered  the  2.5  mg/Kg  dose  level  as  well  tolerated  in  the  2-week  study 
conducted in monkeys (KS-0046). However, significant changes were reported in animals at this dose 
level,  such  as  alteration  of  haematology  parameters  (lower  white  blood  cell,  neutrophil,  eosinophil, 
basophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, large unstained cell, red blood cell, and reticulocyte counts, as well as 
lower haemoglobin and haematocrit values and mean corpuscular volume); lower organ weights (males: 
epididymides,  seminal  vesicles,  prostate,  spleen,  testes,  and  thymus  weights;  and  females:  thymus, 
thyroid/parathyroid,  and  uterus);  or  histologic  findings  (multifocal  nephrosis  of  the  kidney,  mucosal 
atrophy of the stomach, lymphoid depletion in peripheral lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches of the small 
intestines, cellular depletion of the spleen, thymus atrophy, glandular atrophy of the salivary gland in 
females). Not all of them were reversible, and consequently it is difficult to understand how this dose 
level was considered as tolerated. Last, the applicant considered the NOAEL (and HNSTD) for selinexor 
as  1  mg/kg  from  the  13-week  toxicity  study  performed  in  monkeys.  However,  lower  thymus  weights 
(not recovered) was observed in females at 0.3 mg/Kg and clinical observations at ≥0.1 mg/Kg were 
reported  (inappetence  and  abnormal  excreta  (soft  faeces  and/or  diarrhoea)  in  males  and  females 
correlated  with  thin  body  condition;  and  body  weight  losses  and/or  lower  body  weight  gains).  These 
animals were fed supplemented to maintain their health status. Whilst no CNS effects were seen in the 
safety pharmacology studies, necrosis of granular cells was seen in one monkey receiving selinexor at 6 
mg/Kg  (HED  1.8  mg/Kg)  and  the  study  by  Chen  et  al.,  2018  has  suggested  that  the  frequent  non-
haematological  toxicities  of  fatigue  and  GI  toxicities  were  most  likely  centrally  mediated.  Moreover, 
additional  publications  comparing  selinexor  with  other  SINE  compounds  (such  as  KPT8602),  indicates 
that less anorexia, malaise and weight loss is attributed to a lower penetration across BBB (Etchin et al., 
2017; Vercruysse et al., 2017; Wang and Liu 2019).  
Another question raised from these studies is the minimal or absence of safety margin for human studies. 
In this regard, other XPO1 inhibitors (Leptomycin B, KPT-335) have shown an in vitro and in vivo potency 
along with a significant toxicity (anorexia, body weight reduction, inappetence…), indicating a potential 
class toxicity (including hepatotoxicity). The applicant reported nausea and anorexia as class effect for 
XPO1 inhibitors, including selinexor. 
Toxicokinetics measured as part of the repeat dose studies revealed no evidence of differences in 
exposure between the sexes. The exposure levels at the identified NOAEL in the 13-week study in 
monkeys is less than the measured exposure at the clinical dose of 80 mg. Indeed, with the exception 
of the highest dose in the 4-week study in rats of 15 mg/kg and in monkeys of 3 mg/kg there is no 
margin of exposure from any of the doses in the repeat dose toxicity studies. 
Genotoxicity 
Potential genotoxicity of selinexor was evaluated in two in vitro and one in vivo studies. 
Bacterial reverse mutation test (KS-0039, GLP) 
Genotoxicity of selinexor was evaluated in the bacterial mutation test, by using four S. typhimurium 
strains (TA1535, TA1537, TA98, TA100) and one E. coli strain WP2 uvrA in the presence or absence of 
metabolic activation. Selinexor was tested at the concentrations of 1.58, 5.0, 15.8, 50, 158, 500, 
1581, and 5000 μg/plate. Cytotoxicity and precipitation were observed in some cases at the highest 
concentrations, but no increases in revertant colony numbers were reported. The applicant concluded 
no evidence of genotoxic activity. 
Chromosome aberration test (KNC-G-13-005, GLP) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 30/138 
 
 
 
 
The potential to induce chromosome aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes by selinexor 
was evaluated in short and long incubations with or without metabolic activation system.  
No statistically significant increases in structural aberrations or numerical aberrations (polyploidy or 
endoreduplication) were observed for selinexor.  
Micronucleus test in rat (KNC-G-13-004, GLP) 
Micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes were measured in rat bone marrow after three consecutive 
days of treatment with selinexor. The initial dosage levels were 2, 15 and 30 mg/Kg/day, but due to 
the toxicity observed at the highest dose levels (i.e. 15 and 30 mg/Kg/day), a second study with 2, 4, 
7, and 10mg/Kg/day was conducted.  
No increase of bone marrow micronuclei was reported after treatment with selinexor. However, 
animals dosed at ≥4mg/Kg/day presented lower food consumption and lower body weight gains and 
body weight loss. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies with selinexor were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No fertility and early embryonic development studies with selinexor were submitted. 
In an embryofoetal developmental toxicity study in rats the NOAEL value for maternal toxicity and 
embryo-foetal development was established at 0.25 mg/Kg/day and the resultant exposures measured 
represent a margin of exposure of 0.02 from the clinical dose. The Applicant has suggested that based 
on the findings in rats that studies in a second species are not warranted.  
In the definitive GLP study at doses of 0.25, 0.75, or 2 mg/kg/day no effects on mean numbers of 
corpora lutea and implantation sites, mean litter proportions of pre-implantation loss, or skeletal and 
visceral foetal morphology. The NOAEL was defined on the basis of lower mean body weight gains and 
food consumption in the dams and lower foetal weights and skeletal variations in the foetuses.  
Local Tolerance  
In vitro (Bovine corneal opacity and permeability test, GLP) 
Selinexor was evaluated in BCOP test at the concentrations of 10, 100 or 300 µM (studies KS-0098,

The applicant identified the impurities of selinexor, in line with ICH guidance Q3A and S9. In spite that 
ICH guidance M7 does not apply to drugs intended for advanced cancer indications, the applicant used 
this guidance to control the genotoxic or potential genotoxic impurities.  
Phototoxicity 
Selinexor was identified as non-phototoxic in the in vitro phototoxicity assay (3T3 fibroblasts using the 
neutral red uptake assay).

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Selinexor is an inhibitor of XPO1. The rationale for inhibiting XPO1 is given from its overexpression 
observed in a variety of malignancies, including multiple myeloma.  
Pharmacology 
The non-clinical characterisation of selinexor included both invitro and in-vivo studies.  
The in-vitro studies suggest that selinexor acts to inhibit the nuclear export of many proteins, including 
several tumour suppressor proteins such as p53, resulting in cell cycle arrest and decreased viability. It 
is hypothesis that selinexor may be selectively cytotoxic to cancer cells only, however, the data 
supporting this is weak. Given the mechanism of action, i.e. suppression of nuclear export, it is unlikely 
that this effect is only going to be mediated in cancer cells.  
Efficacy in in vivo tumour models has been seen as a single agent and in combination with 
dexamethasone in line with the proposed indication. The only endpoint investigated in these studies 
Assessment report

was tumour growth and therefore it is unclear if the effects on tumour growth translate into increased 
survival. Moreover, there are both concerns with regards to the methodology and the analysis used for 
one of the pivotal in vivo proof of concept studies where tumour appeared to grow larger than 
permitted by the protocol. The inclusion of such larger tumours in the analysis may have skewed the 
data in favour of demonstrating significance for the treatments applied. Nevertheless, it is 
acknowledged the limitations of such xenograft models and their relevance to the clinical situation.  
Pharmacokinetics 
With respect to the pharmacokinetic and metabolism data, selinexor was partially profiled. The 
absorption data for selinexor is limited and is primarily based on data generated in the repeat dose 
toxicity studies. The metabolite pattern appears similar across the nonclinical species and metabolites 
appear to account for less than 1% of the parent peak plasma in clinical samples with no unique 
human only metabolites identified. The in vitro studies performed for drug interactions have been 
primarily performed in line with the FDA guidance document and the applicant has been asked to 
address where these deviate from the EMA ““Guideline on the investigation of drug interactions” 
(CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 2**).  
With regards to the potential interactions, minimal activation of hepatic and intestinal CYP3A is 
expected, given the expected local concentrations of selinexor and its poor solubility at high 
concentrations. CYP induction studies identified a very potent reduction in CYP 3A4 mRNA levels 
However, it is accepted that no accumulation of selinexor was seen following multiple dosing, which 
would support the conclusion that the decrease in mRNA has no in vivo implications. 
As of metabolites, partial information was provided. Therefore, the applicant committed to conduct 
additional post-authorisation studies to confirm the structure of the metabolites. The Applicant has 
committed to submit results from a metabolite characterisation study, by Q1 2021 (CHMP 
Recommendation).  
Toxicology 
Rats were chosen as the rodent species and cynomolgus monkeys as the non-rodent species. The 
nonclinical safety studies are broadly in line with ICH S9. Non-clinical safety program revealed a high 
toxicity of selinexor. Some tissues were mainly affected (reproductive systems, CNS-mediated 
gastrointestinal system…) and clinical findings reported (food consumption and body weight reduction, 
mortality). No safety margin could be established for human studies. A similar question was raised with 
other XPO1 inhibitors, which were discontinued due to significant toxicity observed (inappetence, body 
weight reduction…). 
On the other hand, selinexor showed no effect on genotoxicity. No carcinogenicity study was 
conducted, and only maternal and embryo-foetal development toxicity were carried out, indicating a 
NOAEL value at 0.25 mg/Kg/day for rats. No data for a second species were provided. Selinexor was 
also identified as non-phototoxic and to induce mild-grade II dermal contact sensitivity response at 24 
and 48 hours. 
Selinexor PEC surface water value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as 
log Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore, selinexor is not expected to pose a risk for environment.   
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical documentation submitted was considered adequate. The relevant information 
has been included in the SmPC (sections 4.6, 5.1 and 5.3).

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Several bioanalytical methods with a linear range of 1.00-1000.00 ng/mL for determination of 
selinexor (KCP-330) and its metabolite (KPT-375) in human plasma, human urine and human faeces 
were validated or qualified and used in the clinical studies. Quantitative analysis of selinexor was

performed by LC-MS/MS. The bioanalytical method validations were subject to QA audit and performed 
according to local SOPs and procedures.  
Noncompartmental analyses were used for the estimation of plasma PK parameters of selinexor and 
the trans-isomer KPT-375 (where applicable) in the phase 1 studies KCP-330-001, KCP-330-002 and 
KCP-330-003. In the Phase 2 studies (KCP-330-008, -009, -010) and the pivotal study (KCP-330-
012/STORM), sparse PK samples were collected, and a population PK approach was used to estimate 
the population PK parameters, interpatient variability, covariates and characterisation of the exposure-
response analyses. The population PK model was developed using pooled data from 721 patients in 
seven clinical studies. The model was used to investigate dosing recommendations and any 
requirement for adjustment in special populations for hepatic and renal impairment and drug 
interactions. The QT modelling included data for PK time-matched QTc from 85 patients from Studies 
KCP-330-001 and KCP-330-003. 
Absorption  
•  Bioavailability 
The absolute bioavailability has not been conducted in humans. Oral bioavailability of selinexor 
in mice, rats and monkeys is high. At therapeutic dose of 80 mg (approximately 45 mg/m2), 
the mean Cmax was 680 ng/mL (1.5 µM) and AUC0-∞ was 5386 ng*hr/mL.  
•  Bioequivalence 
Following a single, 60 mg, oral dose of selinexor in 3 different formulations to fed male and 
female patients with advanced sarcoma, the second generation tablet was considered 
functionally bioequivalent to the first generation tablet with regard to total drug exposure as 
measured by AUC0-t and AUC0-∞. While Cmax was slightly outside the 90% CI of 80% to 125% 
CI criteria, the geometric mean ratio was close to 100% (GMR 103.2%).  
• 
Influence of food 
The presence of food (high- or low-fat meals) delayed selinexor absorption (tmax) from 1.5 to 
approximately 2-4 hours with minimal impact on exposures (the geometric mean ratio ranged 
between 114.7% and 125.5%).  
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding of selinexor is greater than 95% and is not concentration dependent (KS-
0025). The blood to plasma ratio was less than 1, suggesting minimal association with red blood cells 
(KS-50013). The apparent volume of distribution after oral administration (V/F) ranged from 1.5 to 2.1 
L/kg, suggesting that selinexor is distributed into tissues. At the recommended dose of 80 mg 
(approximately 45 mg/m2), the V/F was 1.8 L/kg.  
Elimination 
•  Excretion 
Selinexor has not been studied in definitive radiolabel mass balance study; however, based on 
cold metabolism assessment and rat [14C]-selinexor study, it is presumed that selinexor is 
excreted by hepatobiliary route into faeces with minimal excretion into urine. In rats, the major 
route of excretion was via the faeces with 74.7% faecal elimination of radioactivity occurring 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 36/138 
 
 
 
 
by 168 hours post-dose and 70.6% occurring within the first 48 hours post-dose. Urinary 
excretion was 16.3% of the recovered activity, with 14.6% excreted within the first 72 hours 
post-dose.  
•  Metabolism 
Selinexor, as unchanged parent, is the major circulating moiety in human plasma. The most 
common circulating metabolite (<5% of peak of parent levels) is the trans-isomer of selinexor, 
designated KPT-375. This isomer, which likely derives from cis-trans isomerisation of selinexor, 
has approximately 10% of the XPO1 inhibiting activity of selinexor and no other known 
biological properties. In plasma, other metabolites individually accounted for less than 1% of 
parent at peak selinexor plasma concentrations. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Plasma selinexor exposure was dose proportional across and within the 3 - 85 mg/m2 dose range. 
Volume of distribution, total clearance, and elimination half-life were all independent of selinexor dose.

In clinical studies, selinexor was dosed as single dose and multiple dose twice or three times weekly 
and no substantial accumulation (R<1) was evident following repeat dosing. The half-life was 6 hours 
irrespective of dose and dosing schedule.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The PPK analysis utilised PK data collected in adult cancer patients (Studies KCP-330-001, KCP-330-
002, KCP-330-003, KCP-330-008, KCP-330-009, KCP-330-010, KCP-330-012). For this evaluation the 
primary purpose was to develop a model that would describe the PK of selinexor in adult cancer 
patients. A brief summary of the study designs are provided in the Table below:

from Phase 1 and 2 studies were conducted. Baseline creatinine clearance had no impact on the PK of 
selinexor.

In the population PK model, the effect of hepatic impairment was retained and the patients with

•  Race 
The PopPK dataset was categorised for race as White (n=607), Black/African American (n=46), Asian 
(n=15), or other (n=35). Race was not a significant covariate, suggesting exposures to selinexor were 
not impacted by race (KS-50040).

The median body mass index (BMI) in the population PK dataset was 25.8 kg/m2. For the PPK model, 
BMI was identified as being predictive of CL/F. The patients with lean body mass (13.7 kg/m2) had a 
lower clearance (76% of clearance [CL] in comparison to CL with median BMI) and obese patients had 
a higher clearance (38% of CL in comparison to CL with median BMI). The difference in CL due to BMI 
was not considered clinically relevant as it represents <40% difference.

Effect of Selinexor on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs 
The potential for drug interactions due to inhibition of major human CYPs (CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 
2C19, 2D6 and 3A4/5) is low (all IC50s for CYP inhibition >10 μM), including CYP3A4/5 (IC50 of 24 
μM). No demonstrable CYP induction by selinexor was observed in vitro (KS 50010). Selinexor did not 
inhibit solute carrier transporters except for marginal inhibition of OATP1B1 and 1B3 (KS 50012). 
Based on in vitro results, selinexor twice-weekly is not expected to alter the exposures of other drugs. 
Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Selinexor 
Selinexor is not a substrate for major transporters BCRP, P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, 
OCT1, OCT2, or MATE2. The applicant has used the measured IC50 values of selinexor for the 
transporters instead of the inhibition constant (Ki) as recommended in the EMA guidance. However, it 
is considered justified that Ki values equals IC50 for selinexor under the given experimental conditions 
and that the potential for selinexor to inhibit the tested transporters in vivo is unlikely.  
In a definitive CYP inhibition study with CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4/5 (KS-50010; 
Module 2.6.4) based on FDA’s recent guidance on DDIs (FDA Guidance for Industry 2017), the 
inhibition potential was very low (all IC50S >10 µM), including for CYP3A4/5, where an IC50 of 24 µM 
was observed. These results indicate that no clinically meaningful inhibition of major human CYPs, 
including CYP3A4/5, would be expected.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Selinexor is a reversible covalent selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) compound that specifically 
blocks exportin 1 (XPO1). XPO1 is a nuclear export protein that transports cargo proteins from the 
nucleus to the cytoplasm. Selinexor is the major mediator of the nuclear export of many cargos protein 
including tumour suppressor proteins (TSPs), growth regulators and mRNAs of growth promoting 
(oncogenic) proteins. XPO1 inhibition by selinexor leads to marked accumulation of TSPs in the 
nucleus, cell cycle arrest, reductions in several oncoproteins such as c-Myc and cyclin D1, and 
apoptosis of cancer cells.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
XPO1 mRNA Induction by Tumour Category and Type: Following selinexor treatment, XPO1 
mRNA was significantly induced in peripheral blood cells from patients with haematological cancer 
(Figure below). The Fmax in XPO1 mRNA occurred at approximately 4 hours following the initial 
selinexor dose and stayed elevated for up to 48 hours. The t1/2 for decline in XPO1 mRNA levels is 
significantly longer than the PK t1/2 of selinexor in human plasma (Gounder 2014 Abdul Razak, 2016), 
perhaps due to covalent inhibition of XPO1 protein. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 41/138 
 
 
 
 
 
To determine whether the magnitude of XPO1 mRNA induction depends on the type of cancer, fold 
change in XPO1 mRNA was summarised by patient cancer type and plotted against time. The 3 groups 
of patients were selected based on positive response of these tumour types in the Phase 1 studies and 
the focus of the later phase clinical studies of selinexor. The magnitude of XPO1 induction remained 
uniform between different cancer types resulting in almost identical profiles with Fmax between 4 and 
8 hours after initial dose of selinexor and consistent up-regulation of >2-fold for up to 48 hours post-
dose (Figure below). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 42/138 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary pharmacology 
Selinexor was anticipated to have a very low potential for QTc interval prolongation on the basis of the 
in vitro assessment of hERG potassium current inhibition. In the in vivo cardiovascular assessment in 
4-week and 13-week toxicity studies, selinexor showed no AEs in the cardiovascular system in 
monkeys. 
Concentration - QT/QTc analysis: Selinexor inhibited hERG with an IC50 value of 20.6 μM. The 
IC50 value, based on human plasma protein binding of 95.1% and mean Cmax of 1.53 μM, is 
estimated to be approximately 250-times higher than the free unbound Cmax of 0.07 μM following an 
80-mg dose (KS-0055). A population C-QTc model for selinexor was developed using data from two 
phase I studies (KCP-330-001 and KCP-330-003). ∆QTcF by time-matched selinexor concentrations 
are plotted in the figure below.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 43/138 
 
 
 
 
 
Selinexor showed a weak positive C-QTc relationship, with the upper bound of the 90% confidence 
interval of selinexor concentration predicted not to exceed 20 msec ∆QTcF up to 1500 ng/mL (almost 3 
times the mean therapeutic concentration). As the mean Cmax selinexor concentration at the intended 
therapeutic dose of 80 mg (≈ 45 mg/m2) was 601 ng/mL, based on the model predictions, a clinically 
relevant QT prolongation is not expected at the recommended therapeutic dose of 80 mg in patients 
receiving selinexor. 
Heart rate: The Heart Rate by time stratified by dose groups is displayed in Figure 5. There appeared 
to be a trend between Heart Rate and time, however, the confidence intervals overlap, indicating high 
variability over time. The RR-interval by baseline-corrected QTc interval with Fridericia’s correction 
(∆QTcF) stratified by study is displayed in Figure 6. There appeared to be study differences in RR-
intervals although there were only 6 subjects in study KCP-330-003. There appeared to be a slight 
trend between ∆QTcF and RR-interval, however, the confidence intervals overlap, indicating high 
variability for RR-intervals. 
Relation between plasma concentration and effect 
Exposure-efficacy analysis 
In the patients with MM treated with selinexor, no significant relationship between BOR, PFS, or OS 
and AUC or DOSE was observed.

The analyses highlight thrombocytopenia, hyponatraemia, and fatigue ≥Grade 3 TEAEs as related to 
selinexor dose (and exposure) and therefore physicians caring for patients on selinexor should actively 
monitor and aggressively manage these side effects. In contrast, nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea, and 
decreased weight showed minimal or no association with exposure or dose, although they do occur in 
the context of selinexor treatment. Although not directly addressed in these analyses, all of the TEAEs 
considered herein are typically reversible and generally manageable with supportive care. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Selinexor has been characterised using in vitro and in vivo data from several clinical trials. The 
methodology applied to characterise the pharmacokinetics and interactions through non-
compartmental analysis and population approach is mainly endorsed.

Selinexor is highly permeable in Caco-2 and MDCKII permeability assays. Selinexor was a weak 
substrate of BCRP at 0.1 and 1 μM, with efflux ratios of 2.18 and 1.89. BCRP is expected to be 
saturated even at the lowest 5 mg dose. The solubility at clinically relevant doses and high 
permeability support that selinexor is primarily absorbed by passive transport and only limited, not 
clinically relevant, by active transport. The recommended dose is 80 mg (irrespective of BSA and/or 
body weight). At this dose, the mean Cmax was 680 ng/mL (1.5 µM) and AUC0-∞ was 5386 ng*hr/mL. 
The lack of a mass balance study limits to obtain a definitive conclusion about the implication of the 
metabolites and their main metabolic routes.  
The NCA assessment of formulation on the ratios of AUCinf and Cmax revealed differences between first-
generation versus second-generation tablets and fasted versus fed conditions (>±20%). The results

confirmed bioequivalence between TF1 and TF2 for AUC0-t and AUC0-inf but the 90% CI of the geometric 
mean for Cmax ranged from 87.7 to 130.2, caused by higher variability at Cmax and the reduced 
number of individuals enrolled in the study (13 o 14 individuals). The mean of the 90% CI is close to 
the unity (103), suggesting low influence of tablet formulation on Cmax.  
Metabolism of selinexor occurs through multiple pathways. These include metabolism by CYP3A4, 
CYP2C9 and various UGTs. Selinexor can also undergo metabolism by GSTs (N-dealkylation, 
glucuronidation and GSH conjugations) each occurring at <1% of the parent levels. The majority of 
these metabolites are known to have no XPO1 inhibitory activity. In human faeces, the primary 
metabolite was KPT-452 (N-dealkylation; inactive metabolite). In human urine, the primary metabolite 
was KPT-5000 (cystein adduct, inactive metabolite). Selinexor can also undergo racemisation to the 
trans- form (KPT-375), which is the most common metabolite of selinexor. The KPT-375 isomer has 
approximately 10% of the XPO1 inhibiting activity of unchanged selinexor and no other known 
biological properties. The Applicant informs that KPT-375 has mean Cmax values <5% of those achieved 
for parent selinexor in all groups. Systemic exposure of KPT-375 is low compared to exposure of 
selinexor.  
The Applicant argues and it is agreed that due to the multiple transformation pathways involved in the 
elimination of selinexor, it is considered unlikely that PK would be altered in the event of concomitant 
administrations of modifiers of various enzymes. 
Population PK analysis 
The population pharmacokinetics of selinexor have been described using a two-compartment model 
with zero-order release of the drug followed by a first-order absorption, distribution and elimination. 
Body weight on CL/F and Vc/F and sex on CL/F were identified as statistically significant covariates, 
which resulted in a more parsimonious model compared to the previous final population PK model. The 
clinical relevance of body weight and sex on selinexor exposure could be considered of minor relevance 
(<20% change in AUC), which discards the necessity to establish different dosing recommendations 
based on patient’s characteristics.  
Special populations 
No dedicated studies for the investigation of special populations have been conducted with selinexor.   
Elimination by the renal route is considered minor. Although the number of subjects with severe renal 
impairment was limited, renal function is considered sufficiently evaluated by population PK analysis, 
where patients ranging from having normal kidney function to severe renal impairment was enrolled 
in the clinical phase 1 and 2 studies and thus included in the PPK population. Therefore, mild, 
moderate, or severe renal impairment is not expected to alter selinexor PK, and no adjustments in the 
dose of selinexor are required in patients with renal dysfunction (SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Selinexor undergoes transformation through several hepatic conversion systems but is also able to 
undergo unchanged excretion. The number of patients studied with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment at baseline (N=6 and N=3, respectively) or throughout dosing (N=14 and N=6, 
respectively) was limited, the impact of hepatic function is nonetheless considered adequately 
captured by the population PK analysis. This analysis indicated no clinically relevant effect of hepatic 
impairment between normal and mild hepatic impaired patients. Therefore, no dose adjustment of 
selinexor is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment There are insufficient data in patients 
with moderate or severe hepatic impairment to support a dose recommendation (SmPC sections 4.2 
and 5.2). 
Exploratory analyses of the effect of gender, age and malignancy on PK were conducted. Overall, no 
indications of clinically relevant PK-altering effects of neither gender, age nor malignancy were found. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 48/138 
 
 
 
 
The population PK analysis further investigated possible effects. 422 males and 298 females were 
included in the population PK population. Female patients had significantly lower (19.1%) clearance 
than male patients, however the effect is not considered clinically relevant. Summary statistics 
stratified by race were reported. Subjects with Asian origin appear to have slightly higher exposure, 
and this can be explained by, in general, lower body weight and BSA. Even though the proportion of 
black subjects is low, exposure appear to be comparable to exposure in white subjects.  
In the population PK analysis, a trend towards higher clearance with higher BMI was observed. 
Clearance would increase about 23% for a subject with a BMI above 40. This effect of BMI on exposure 
is not considered clinically relevant. 
The age range represented in the population PK analysis was wide (18-94 years) with a median age of 
68 years. Age was identified as a significant covariate for the absorption rate constant (ka). However, 
although younger patients exhibited a lower ka, the ka value increased only marginally by 30% in the 
older age groups. This is not considered clinically relevant. No paediatric patients below the age of 18 
were included in the clinical trials contributing PK data. 
Interactions 
Comparisons of distributions of CL/F, dose normalised AUC, and dose normalised Cmax for patients 
taking CYP3A4 inhibitors (n=114), CYP3A4 inducers (n=3), CYP2D6 inhibitors (n=12), and CYP2C8 
inhibitors (n=4) versus those not taking concomitant medications were also presented as Box-and-
Whisker plots and none indicated any clinical relevant drug interaction. The Applicant committed to 
conduct an in vivo DDI study with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor clarithromycin as a sub-study in STOMP 
to be completed in Q4 2020.  
Selinexor was shown to inhibit CYP3A4/5 and OATP1B1/B3, induce CYP1A2 and was a weak substrate 
of BCRP in vitro. Selinexor has no potential to inhibit hepatic CYP3A (unbound Cmax/Ki = 0.008 after a 
100 mg dose which is <0.02) and low potential to inhibit intestinal CYP3A in vivo due to limited 
solubility at pH >3 (Igut/Ki <3). It is considered acceptable that no in vivo study investigating 
CYP4A4/5 inhibition by selinexor is conducted. Results from Study KCP-330-003 indicated that biliary 
and renal excretion of selinexor is minor. Hence, BCRP is expected to have minimal effect on the 
absorption of selinexor and no in vivo DDI study is required.  
Due to limited solubility of selinexor, at the proposed dose level, the expected interaction of selinexor 
on dexamethasone exposure would be minimal. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamic data were primarily derived from study KCP-330-001. All PD data were generated in 
the target population or in populations with other malignancies. No healthy subjects were included in 
clinical trials. Selinexor is a reversible covalent selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) compound 
that specifically blocks exportin 1 (XPO1). The mechanism of action is expected to be shared across 
various malignancies including the target population of patient with refractory MM. 
Primary pharmacology 
Changes in XPO1 mRNA were used as a biomarker of PD effects as mRNA transcription increases in 
response to selinexor inhibition of XPO1 protein function. Selinexor treatment induced a 4-fold increase 
above baseline of XPO1 mRNA within a period of approximately 4 hours. A dose-dependent relationship 
is reported. The increase only gradually declined and remained 3-fold increased after 48 hours – which 
is considerably longer than the selinexor T½ of 6-8 hours. Thus, effects lasting beyond the presence of 
selinexor are induced. The induction of mRNA by selinexor was consistent across the haematological 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 49/138 
 
 
 
 
cancers investigated which supports that PD results may be extrapolated between patient groups with 
different haematological malignancies.  
Evaluations were performed between selinexor and different efficacy and safety endpoints, suggesting 
the lack of a significant relationship between selinexor exposure and efficacy outcomes. The exposure-
safety analysis revealed thrombocytopenia, hyponatraemia, and fatigue ≥Grade 3 TEAEs as related to 
selinexor dose and AUC. The Applicant provided the predicted probability of grade >3 fatigue, 
hyponatraemia and AE’s leading to discontinuation across different AUC values (geometric mean, 20% 
increase and 30% increase). The results suggest a minor effect on all three safety endpoints and the 
increase of 30% in exposure might not be of clinical relevance.  
No patients in the PK population had a ∆QTcF >60 msec, and to date no cases of torsade de pointes or 
other polymorphic ventricular tachycardia has been reported in patients exposed to selinexor. Although 
the total number of patients exposed to selinexor is too low to rule out an increased risk of torsade de 
pointes even though no cases have been observed, the absence of such cases is acknowledged. 
Differences in RR-intervals between treatment dose cohorts were observed. The number of patients 
contributing data was limited and interpretation must be done with caution. Although a slight dose-
response relationship was apparent with an increase in heart rate following administration and 
subsequently declining, the overall changes in heart rate were modest (mean 8 beats per minute 
increase or decrease, respectively, for the highest dose cohort). A slight trend between ∆QTcF and RR-
interval, particularly in study KCP-330-003 was also observed but observations built on data from only 
6 patients. In summary, no link between selinexor concentration and increased potential for pro-
arrhythmic risk was demonstrated. Further, although a slight increase in heart rate appeared 
associated with selinexor with an apparent dose-response relationship, the overall changes in heart 
rate were modest and not considered clinically relevant.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The assessment of the clinical pharmacology properties of selinexor were mostly addressed and 
characterised using NCA, population PK analysis and exposure-response assessment. The population 
PK model has been updated, showing the ability of the current structural PK model to properly describe 
the overall time-course of selinexor. 
The overall clinical pharmacology programme can be considered adequate.  
The relevant information has been included in the SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study KCP-330-001 
Study KCP-330-001 was a Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of oral selinexor and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) ─ranging from 3 
to 80 mg/m2─ in patients with haematologic malignancies (N=285+1) , including RRMM (n= 81). 
Study KCP-330-001 was conducted in patients with advanced haematologic malignancies, including 
patients with RRMM with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) of 0

or 1. Patients with MM must have had symptomatic disease relapsed/refractory to ≥3 prior regimens 
that included at least an alkylating agent, an IMiD, a PI, and a steroid.  
Study KCP-330-001 enrolled 286 patients (1 patient with MM was not treated because of disease 
progression before dose initiation; total enrolled and treated = 285) with various previously treated 
haematologic malignancies, 81 of whom had RRMM.  
All 81 patients with RRMM have terminated treatment. The most common reason for termination of 
treatment was PD. 
In this study, XPO1 mRNA induction following selinexor dosing reached a maximum at ~4 hours post 
dose and continued to be elevated at 48 hours post dose. These results indicated a twice-weekly 
dosing regimen of selinexor would maintain the inhibition of XPO1. 
MTD was defined as the next lower dose level below the one in which >1 of 3 patients or ≥2 of 6 
patients had a DLT, provided that that dose level was ≤25% lower than the highest (intolerable) dose 
tested. If the projected MTD was >25% lower than the highest dose tested, then an additional cohort 
of ≥3 patients was to be added at a dose that was intermediate between the intolerable dose and the 
next lower dose.  
MTD/RP2D was determined independently for each arm in the study, and a dose expansion phase was 
allowed at either the MTD or the RP2D.  
There were 8 arms and 11 schedules divided across 3 types of cohorts.  
Several 10-doses-per-cycle, twice-weekly dosing schedules and one once-weekly dosing schedule were 
explored. Analyses of PK and PDn data from Phase 1 studies ongoing at the time and non-clinical 
animal data suggested that alternative dosing schedules may be highly active and well tolerated. A 
standard 3 + 3 design was used for the dose escalation cohorts (Schedules 3 to 9). 
All doses described were given orally (PO), once daily (based on corresponding weekly schedule), and 
with or within 30 minutes of a meal.

Tolerability of selinexor therapy in the absence of GC supportive care was assessed in an ongoing 
manner by investigators and the sponsor. If the investigator believed that a patient was deriving 
clinical benefit from selinexor but had difficulty tolerating treatment, and had exhausted available 
supportive care, that patient received GC supportive care and continued selinexor treatment. However, 
patients who received GCs in the first 2 cycles were considered not evaluable for Arm 8 single-agent 
selinexor response, while patients who had completed Cycle 2 without receiving GCs were evaluable for 
Arm 8 single-agent selinexor response until the date of GC administration. 
The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the KCP-330-001 study was initially determined to be 60 
mg/m2. However, further dosing analysis demonstrated that a dose of 35 to 45 mg/m2 had equivalent 
efficacy and improved long-term tolerability. Hence the RP2D of selinexor as a single-agent for use in 
this study was selected to be 35 to 45 mg/m2 twice weekly, depending on the indication. The MTD for 
selinexor has been defined as 70 mg/m2.  
The selected dose/RP2D for MM patients was finally 45 mg/m2 selinexor plus 20 mg dexamethasone.

occurred at the medium dose range of selinexor. 
•  Among the 7 patients with MM overall (8.6%) who achieved an objective response, the median 
DOR was 180 days (95% CI: 57, NC), with the longest response being 518 days.

• 
For patients with MM treated with selinexor at 45 mg/m2 (RP2D) plus dexamethasone (40 mg 
weekly, n = 12), the ORR was 50.0% (95% CI: 21, 79) and the CBR was 58%, which included 
1 patient (8.3%) with an sCR, 5 patients (41.7%) with a PR, and 1 patient (8.3%) with an MR. 
Three patients (25.0%) had a best response of SD, and 1 patient (8.3%) had PD. 
•  Among the 6 patients with MM treated with selinexor at 45 mg/m2 plus dexamethasone 
(50.0%) who achieved an objective response, the median DOR was 180 days (95% CI: 57, 
NC). These results indicate improvement in the efficacy of selinexor when given with low-dose 
dexamethasone. 
Selinexor at 60 mg/m2 Plus Dexamethasone 20 mg Twice Weekly 
• 
For patients with MM treated with selinexor at 60 mg/m2 plus dexamethasone (40 mg weekly, 
n = 13), the ORR was 0% and the CBR was 7.7%. One patient (7.7%) had a minimal 
response. The lack of response observed for 60 mg/m2 selinexor plus dexamethasone 20 mg 
twice weekly was likely due to poor tolerability of this dose level that resulted in a short time 
on study for patients.

The most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) included nausea, anorexia, fatigue, 
thrombocytopenia, and anaemia, which are generally reversible, and can be attenuated with 
prophylactic and supportive care.  
Tolerability was similar between the groups, except for the patients with RRMM treated with the 
highest dose of selinexor at 60 mg/m2 in combination with dexamethasone (20 mg twice-weekly, n = 
13), where the dose was not well tolerated and patients withdrew from the study primarily with 
constitutional and gastrointestinal symptoms. Overall the most frequently reported adverse events 
(AEs) included nausea, anorexia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia, which are generally 
reversible, and can be attenuated with prophylactic and supportive care. 
Therefore, based on improved efficacy and similar tolerability, in this Phase 1, dose-escalation study, 
the RP2D was established at 45 mg/m2 (~80 mg) selinexor in combination with 20 mg 
dexamethasone, given together twice-weekly. The addition of dexamethasone to selinexor improved 
outcomes, reported by the applicant as consistent with one of the mechanisms of action of selinexor (i. 
e. restoration of anti-MM glucocorticoid receptor signalling in the presence of glucocorticoids). 
In the subset of patients with RRMM (n=12) who received 45 mg/m2 (~80 mg) selinexor in 
combination with 20 mg dexamethasone, given together twice-weekly, the ORR was 50% (n= 6) with 
a median PFS of 232 days; the median OS was not reached. On the basis of these results, this dose 
was selected as the RP2D and was further evaluated for patients with RRMM in the KCP 330 
012/STORM study. 
Duration of Response (study KCP-330-001) 
Patients without evidence of progression were censored at time of last evaluable disease assessment. 
A total of 7 patients with MM (8.6%) achieved an objective response. For all patients with MM, the 
median DOR was not calculable at the low or high dose ranges and was 180 days (95% CI: 57, NC) at 
the medium dose range; the longest response in patients with MM was censored at 518 days.

2.5.2.  Main study 
Study KCP-330-012/STORM  
This was a global, Phase 2b, multicenter, single-arm, 2-part, open-label study designed to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of Sd in patients with quad-exposed, double-class-refractory MM (Part 1 only) or 
penta-exposed, triple-class-refractory MM (Part 1 and Part 2). 
Part 1 (supportive analysis) included patients with both quad-exposed, double-class-refractory 
(lenalidomide, pomalidomide, bortezomib, carfilzomib) (at least 1 PI and 1 IMiD) and penta-exposed, 
triple-class-refractory MM (quad + refractory and either daratumumab or isatuximab) patients. Two 
dosing schedules were examined: selinexor 80 mg twice-weekly for 3 weeks of each 4-week cycle and 
selinexor 80 mg twice weekly continuously in 4-week cycles; dexamethasone 20 mg twice-weekly was 
given with each dose of selinexor. Results from Part 1 and changes in the treatment landscape 
contributed to the design of Part 2. 
Part 2 (pivotal analysis for this application) included patients with penta-exposed MM, defined as 
patients who have MM previously treated with lenalidomide, pomalidomide, bortezomib, carfilzomib, 
and daratumumab (and an alkylating agent), and triple-class-refractory MM, defined as patients whose 
disease is refractory to prior treatment with at least 1 IMiD, at least 1 PI, and the anti-CD38 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) daratumumab (and glucocorticoids). Patients received selinexor 80 mg in 
combination with low-dose dexamethasone 20 mg (Sd) twice-weekly on Days 1 and 3 until disease 
progression, death, or unacceptable toxicity.

Treatments 
Patients received selinexor 80 mg PO in combination with low-dose dexamethasone 20 mg (Sd) twice-
weekly on Days 1 and 3 until disease progression, death, or unacceptable toxicity. 
In selected cases, after 2 cycles of treatment, the selinexor dose may have been increased to 100 mg 
(<70 mg/m2) twice weekly based on efficacy considerations after a minimum of 2 cycles of study 
therapy. Dexamethasone 20 mg was administered with each dose of selinexor. For patients with partial 
intolerance to glucocorticoids (per Investigator), a minimum dose of 10 mg with each dose of selinexor 
was permitted. In patients with stable disease (SD) or MR who tolerated the treatment, the dose of 
selinexor could be increased to 100 mg (provided it was <70 mg/m2) after a minimum of 2 cycles of 
study therapy. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective: 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of selinexor 80 mg plus dexamethasone 20 mg (Sd), both dosed PO on 
Days 1 and 3 weekly in patients with penta-exposed, triple-class-refractory MM enrolled in Part 2 of 
the study. 
Secondary objectives: 
•  
To evaluate the efficacy of Sd in patients with quad-exposed, double-class-refractory and 
penta-exposed, triple-class-refractory MM in Part 1 of the study

•  
•  
•  
To determine the safety and tolerability of Sd in patients with RRMM in both parts of the study 
To evaluate the health-related quality-of-life (QoL) of patients with RRMM treated with Sd 
To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Sd in patients with RRMM (Part 1 only) 
Exploratory objectives: 
•  
 To evaluate potential predictive marker of response to Sd in patients with RRMM. 
Outcomes/endpoints

Secondary endpoints:  
o  DOR (duration of response) 
o  CBR (clinical benefit rate) 
o  DCB (Duration of clinical benefit) 
o  DCR (disease control rate) 
o  PFS (progression free survival)  
o  OS (overall survival) 
o  TTP (time to progression) 
o  TTNT (time to next treatment) 
o  QoL (quality of life) 
Exploratory endpoint: MRD 
Sample size 
The sample size for this study addresses the primary study objective of evaluating the clinical effect of 
Sd in patients with penta-exposed, triple-class-refractory MM by reference to a minimal threshold level 
for ORR, set to 0.10 (10%). This was based on preliminary evidence from Part 1 of this study, 
suggesting Sd may exhibit substantial efficacy; therefore, the statistical test associated with the 
comparison to the threshold will maintain a Type I error rate of 0.025, 1-sided. 
For the primary efficacy analysis, a sample size of 122 patients with penta-exposed, triple-class 
refractory MM will allow a 1-sided test at α=0.025 to detect an ORR of ≥0.20 against the threshold 
ORR of 0.10, with 90% power. 
Overall, a total of approximately 210 patients was to be enrolled, including: 
• Penta-exposed, triple-class-refractory: 
− 122 patients for the primary efficacy analysis (Part 2) 
− 30 patients for supportive efficacy (Part 1) 
• Quad-exposed, double-class-refractory: 48 patients for supportive efficacy analyses

Randomisation 
Not applicable. This is a single-arm study. 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable. This is an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
For each patient that signs the informed consent, the study consists of: 
- 
- 
Screening/baseline visit: occurs within 21 days prior to receiving the 1st dose of study 
treatment 
Treatment period: expected to be up to 12 months, but there is no maximum treatment 
duration. Patients will be treated until disease progression, death, toxicity that cannot be 
managed by standard care, or withdrawal from study, whichever occurs first 
- 
Follow-up period: up to 12 months after last dose of study treatment, patients will be 
contacted approximately every 3 months for durability of response and survival follow-up. 
The End of Study (EoS) will occur when all patients have completed the 12-month follow-up period 
(i.e., when the last patient has expired, been followed for 12 months after last dose of study 
treatment, been lost to follow-up, or has withdrawn consent, whichever occurs first). 
No interim analysis was planned for this study.

Numbers analysed 
Data Sets Analysed 
Modified Intent-To-Treat Population (mITT) (Part 2): The mITT Population includes all 122 
patients with penta-exposed, triple-class-refractory MM treated in Part 2 of the study who received at 
least 1 dose of either selinexor or dexamethasone.  
One patient who received Sd was excluded from the mITT Population because the patient had not 
received prior carfilzomib. 
The mITT Population serves as the primary analysis set for all efficacy endpoints and demographics. 
Table 21 Analysis Populations All Patients in Screened Population 
Additional Efficacy Populations (Part 2): Efficacy was also to be examined by refractoriness to specific 
previous agents. The following populations are included for primary and secondary efficacy variables and 
include subsets of the mITT population from Part 2. To be included in a specific subset, documentation 
of refractoriness to the relevant agent(s) was required.

documented to be refractory to bortezomib, carfilzomib, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and daratumumab. 
The BCLPD-ref Population includes 83 patients. 
- CLPD-ref Population: The CLPD-ref Population includes all patients whose MM was documented to be 
refractory to carfilzomib, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and daratumumab. 
The CLPD-ref Population includes 101 patients. 
- BCPD-ref Population: The BCPD-ref Population includes all patients whose MM was documented to be 
refractory to bortezomib, carfilzomib, pomalidomide, and daratumumab. 
The BCPD-ref Population includes 94 patients.

Outcomes and estimation 
•  Primary endpoint - Overall Response Rate (ORR) 
Part 2: 
The ORR per IRC (mITT Analysis Population) for patients treated in Part 2 was 26.2% (95% CI: 18.7, 
35), which included 2 (1.6%) patients with an sCR/CR, 6 (4.9%) patients with a VGPR, and 24 
(19.7%) patients with a PR; 16 (13.1%) patients had MR, 48 (39.3%) patients had SD, and 26 
(21.3%) patients had PD/NE. 
The median time to response of PR or better was 4.1 weeks (range: 1-14). 
Part 1: 
The ORR per IRC for patients treated in Part 1 was 20.3% (95% CI: 12.0, 30.8), which included 4 (5.1%) 
patients  with  VGPR,  and  12  (15.2%)  patients  with  a  PR;  9  (11.4%)  of  patients  had  MR,  30  (38.0%) 
patients had SD, and 24 (30.4%) patients had PD/NE. 
The CBR was 31.6% (95% CI: 21.6, 43.1), which included all patients with an MR or better. 
The median time to response of PR or better was 4.1 weeks (range: 2-8). 
All Penta-Exposed, Triple-Class-Refractory Patients (Part 2 + Part 1). 
For all penta-exposed, triple-class-refractory patients treated in both Part 2 and Part 1 (n=152), 
the ORR per IRC was 25.0% (95% CI: 18.3, 32.7), which included 2 (1.3%) patients with an sCR/CR, 8 
(5.3%) patients with a VGPR, and 28 (18.4%) patients with a PR; 22 (14.5%) patients had MR, 54 (35.5) 
patients had SD, and 38 (25.0%) patients had PD/NE.

Overall Response Rate per Investigator Assessment 
After  the  data  cut-off  of  07  September  2019.    For  patients  in  Part  2  (mITT  Population)  the  ORR  per 
investigator assessment was 24.6% and CBR was 34.4%. Best responses included: sCR/CR (n=1; 0.8%), 
VGPR (n=8; 6.6%), PR (n=21: 17.2%), and MR (n=12; 9.8%).   
For patients in Part 1, the ORR per investigator assessment was 20.3% and CBR was 31.6%. 
•  Secondary endpoint - Duration of Response (DOR) 
A key secondary efficacy endpoint for the study was DOR per IMWG as determined by the IRC.

Table 25 Duration of Response per IMWG Response Criteria as Assessed by the IRC by 
Previous Anticancer Treatment Part 2 (mITT Analysis Population) 
Duration of response was also examined by prior use of daratumumab. The median DOR in patients who 
had received prior daratumumab as a single agent (± dexamethasone) (n=7) was 2.8 months and 4.4 
months in patients who received daratumumab as part of a prior combination therapy (n=25).  
In patients who had received daratumumab as their last prior therapy (n=20) the median DOR was 3.8 
months and 4.4 months in patients who received daratumumab earlier in their treatment course (n=12). 
Median DOR was also examined by prior use of a checkpoint inhibitor. Among the 9 patients who had 
previously been treated with a checkpoint inhibitor with a response on study, the median DOR was not 
reached. 
Median DOR was also examined by prior SCT. The median DOR was not impacted by prior SCT, with a 
median  DOR  not  estimable  in  patients  without  a  prior  SCT  (n=4),  4.4  months  in  patients  with  1  SCT 
(n=22), and 3.7 months in patients with >1 SCT (n=6).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The KCP-330-012/STORM study was a Phase 2b, multicentre, single-arm, 2–part, open-label study 
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sd in patients with quad-exposed, double-class 
refractory MM (Part 1 only) or patients with penta-exposed, triple-class refractory MM (Part 1 and Part 
2). Part 2 is the pivotal study for this application. 
The population of patients enrolled in both parts of the study has a median age ~64 years, and 
represents patients with multi-refractory MM who have been treated with several anti MM agents, 
including a group of patients with RRMM who have received ≥ 9 prior treatment regimens that 
represents a 30% of the cases. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 92/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A main limitation of the study design is the lack of knowledge about the contribution of the mono-
components and therefore it is not possible to isolate the treatment effect of selinexor vs. 
dexamethasone. Additionally, when it comes to contextualising the clinical value of this combination, 
due to single arm trial design, data especially in these kind of patients with high refractory diseases 
and where historical data are not fully comparable, are difficult to interpret. The Applicant argues that 
the inclusion criteria for STORM required patients to have MM that were refractory to glucocorticoids 
and at least 1 IMiD, at least 1 PI, daratumumab, and their most recent therapeutic regimen. As such, 
the estimated activity of low-dose dexamethasone in this population was estimated to be negligible 
(due to the disease being refractory to glucocorticoids). But additionally, it has been argued that 
selinexor enhances the transcription and translation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), thereby 
increasing GR levels overall. Dexamethasone then activates the GR including enhance its nuclear 
localisation (required for GR transcriptional activity), leading to a synergistic enhancement of the 
antitumour transcriptional activity and cell death. That laid into question whether a higher dose of 
corticosteroids would be associated with an improved effect and it is questionable that the ORR 
observed in patients receiving Sd therapy is reflective of the activity of selinexor when selinexor 
activity as monotherapy do not show good outcomes. 
The primary endpoint is ORR in patients with penta-exposed MM whose disease is triple-class-
refractory to prior therapies. The primary analysis of ORR was designed to determine the superiority of 
Sd to the minimal threshold for ORR.  
The initial design of the study for Part 2 was defined as a threshold of 10% for ORR (using a 2-sided, 
exact 95% CI and calculated for the rate of ORR among the mITT population) to meet the primary 
endpoint. The primary endpoint is acceptable in SAT for regulatory purpose where there is no 
alternative therapy with proven benefit in terms of PFS or OS, since this is a clear reflection of the 
pharmacodynamic effect (antitumour activity).  
An Independent review committee (IRC) was set up to assess the best overall response (primary 
efficacy endpoint: ORR). However, for the assessment of the ORR, patients with "unconfirmed 
response" have been taken into account as exploratory analysis, possibly due to lack of relevant data 
in some subjects, to assess the response category. Amendment 4 was carried out throughout the 
study, involving this requirement of a confirmatory sequential sample (blood sample and/or urine 
sample, as appropriate) to confirm response-categories (PR, VGPR, CR or sCR) as it is demanded per 
current IMWG criteria, therefore previous assessments of response of patients involved in the study 
until the amendment 4 was applied, could be affected by this issue, which is a matter of concern. This 
point seems to affect critical aspects, as the assessments of MP in urine samples, in some cases have 
not been processed. It is well known that sFLC are of clinical value for monitoring disease, but they are 
not accepted as interchangeable for urine assessments in the current criteria. It is acknowledged that 
sFLC do not reflect perfectly the quantification of urine MP and for now it is required for response 
assessment. Additionally, other critical points for response assessment as stated in the current IMWG 
criteria have not been strictly followed, which eventually could overestimate the reported ORR. 
Globally the definition of analysis populations is supported, although the mITT was used for the 
efficacy analyses: the difference between the ITT and the mITT was only one patient, who was 
excluded because the patient did not receive prior carfilzomib. While the exclusion of one patient would 
not change the overall response results, the efficacy results using the ITT population instead of mITT 
has been reported in the SmPC, including all subjects that were treated with Sd.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
On analysing firstly the information from dose – finding / supportive studies, it is noted that in the 
selected Sd-RP2D population (cohort 6) of study KCP-330-001 the patients with better outcomes 
were those who received selinexor 45 mg/m2 plus dexamethasone 20 mg twice weekly. Although the 
rate of response to Sd is reasonably high in the selected RP2D, which consists of patients of very poor 
prognosis and with few therapeutic alternatives, this population is very small (n=12) and the data with 
higher doses, i.e. selinexor 60 mg/m2 plus dexamethasone 20 mg twice weekly, which was the initially 
determined RP2D, (n=13) showed a significant toxicity that leads to the early withdrawal of treatment.  
In addition, it draws attention to the lack of objective responses in the population of selinexor as single 
agent in the KCP-330-001 study. Therefore, the addition of dexamethasone is reasonable as 
corticosteroids are usually administered as backbone therapy and additionally due to the potential 
synergistic benefit for better responses.  
Patients in the pivotal study KCP-330-012/STORM had received more previous treatments than 
those in previous registration studies, which points to a more refractory disease and more 
immunosuppressed patients with a worse general condition than in previous studies.  
Response assessment was performed following the last IMWG response criteria (Kumar 2016). 
Following these criteria all response categories require two consecutive assessments made any time 
before starting any new therapy. As previously noted, the primary analysis of ORR was designed to 
determine the superiority of Sd to the minimal threshold for ORR, documentation of response required 
two consecutive readings of the applicable disease parameter (serum M-protein (sMP), urine M-protein 
(uMP), serum FLC (sFLC), or quantitative immunoglobulin level). As reported by the MAH the 
confirmatory response assessment may have been obtained the same day as the initial response 
assessment but must have been analysed separately, since an unconfirmed response may be 
associated with the patient's specific situation and it could not reflect the real response of the disease 
or it could be distorted by a technical error. This fact is even more relevant in cases where the disease 
is within the limits of detection of the technique applied (e.g. RC). This means that it does not 
represent a true stability of the response, but a punctual response, which can magnify the actual ORR. 
ORR was also assessed based on investigator assessment of response.  
In the same line, patients with uMP at baseline, without follow up in uMP and/or confirmation of 
response in uMP, cannot be evaluated. Serum FLC levels should only be used for response assessment 
when both the serum and urine M-component levels are deemed not measurable. This implies that it 
cannot systematically replace a mandatory evaluation of uMP according to the current criteria. 
Accordingly, and given the fact that we are faced with a single-arm study, without comparator and 
with ORR as a primary efficacy assessment endpoint, the application of response criteria by IMGW 
must be highly strict in order to assess the actual efficacy of the new drug. Subtle changes in the 
application of the response criteria could overestimate the actual value of the ORR. 
Therefore, and with all these doubts in mind, a systematic review was performed of all patients where 
a response rate was achieved according to the CSR. Based on this, the company’s statement of at least 
a PR in all 32 patients considered as responders, was not supported. Further, in the context of the 
critical issues identified during the routine GCP inspection conducted in March 2019 the applicant 
undertook a re-monitoring of ‘all responders’ (i.e. 32 patients) in the study. An update on 9 patients in 
which the re-monitoring exercise identified data edits, as well as additional justification to support the 
10 responses under discussion were submitted. The identified previous doubts in 10 patients were not 
alleviated since no new data were made available. Notwithstanding this, finally 31 responders were 
accepted for all the calculations. ORR was also examined by 3 additional subgroups: R-ISS Stage I, II, 
and III respectively; US vs non-US patients; FLC vs non-FLC MM patients. The ORR was consistent for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 94/138 
 
 
 
 
age groups below 65 and 65-74, which is reassuring; only few patients (18) were ≥75 years with an 
ORR of 27.8%, but there seems to be a difference in terms of ORR between US and non-US patients. 
The difference may be multifactorial, no clear explanation was evident, sample size was small with 
statistical limitations, the subgroup analysis was not predefined and a difference was also noted 
according to clinical experience, thus the ORR was higher at sites enrolling 6 patients, i.e. considered 
more experienced.  
Time to response was a median of 4.1 weeks (range 1 to 14), and the median time of exposure was 8 
weeks. Even when it is of little value for interpretation as it is a single arm study, OS has been 
reported by the MAH as a median of 8 months 95% IC (6.3, 11.3). Non-responding patients (PD or NE) 
showed an OS of 1.9 months for part-2 and 3.8 months for part-1.  
The updated median PFS (IRC based) was the same as the first analysis: 3.7 months (95% CI: 2.8, 
4.7). 
Median OS in US patients was 8.6 months and was not reached in non-US patients. This in contrast to 
the ORR, which was 31% in US patients and 13.2% in non-US patients. The Applicant has updated the 
OS data at data cut-off 7 September 2019. The median time of follow-up was 15.0 for US patients 
versus 14.6 months for non-US patients. Median OS was 8.0 months (95% CI: 6.2, 11.3) in US 
patients and 8.4 months (95% CI: 3.9, NE) in non-US patients. The difference in ORR and OS results 
in US and non-US patients at the first analysis is still not understood, however it is reassuring that the 
OS data with extended follow-up are similar in both US and non-US patients. Sample size is small and 
confirmatory results from a phase 3 study are awaited.  
The absence of a control arm and the small number of patients treated with selinexor impact the 
interpretation of the clinical benefit. It is not possible to fully elucidate the actual role of the mono-
components in this combination. In the light of the data assessed, it seems unlikely that the efficacy in 
terms of ORR observed in the combination of selinexor 80 mg plus dexamethasone 20 mg (Sd) twice 
weekly, can be driven by the activity of one of the mono-components and it is unrealistic to believe 
dexamethasone alone can play the main role in the antitumour activity. 
Notwithstanding the above, the ORR observed in the part 2 of this study is 26.2% (32/122) (somehow 
comparable to the 30% ORR observed in the pomalidomide study), but bearing in mind that the 
population included here is highly refractory and has received several other therapeutic treatments in 
previous lines, this implies a more fragile population and a more refractory disease in the STORM 
study. In fact the population included in the STORM study is more aligned with that included in the 
belantamab mafodotin pivotal registrational trial (i.e. DREAMM-2) in which an ORR of 32% (97.5% CI: 
22%, 44%; N=97) with mDoR of 11 months (95% CI: 4.2, NR) were reported. 
The limitation of the unavailability of a control arm in this context calls into question the interpretation 
of the outcomes, there is no comparable benefit in terms of DoR: median DoR in the STORM study 
(mITT population part 2) was 4.4 months (95% CI: 3.7, NE). Comparing these results with historic 
studies such as pomalidomide (San Miguel et al. Lancet Oncol. 2013), control arm with HD 
dexamethasone showed a median DoR of 6.1 months (ranging from 1.4 to 8.5 months) in patients with 
at least PR whereas pomalidomide arm showed a DoR of 7 months (ranging from 6 to 9 months). In a 
daratumumab study (Lonial, Lancet 2016) DoR was reported as 7.4 months (95% IC 5.5 - NE). 
Further, as described above a mDoR of 11 months (95% CI: 4.2, NR) has been reported for the 
recently authorised antibody drug conjugate belantamab mafodotin (Lonial et al. Lancet Oncol. 2020). 
In summary, the overall response rate (as reported by the applicant) in the STORM study is lower with 
shorter duration of response compared to what is reported in the pomalidomide, daratumumab and 
belantamab mafodotin studies in RRMM. Furthermore, taking into account the uncertainties related to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 95/138 
 
 
 
 
the actual number of responders (see above), the duration of the response is for the time being 
undetermined, which would add even more uncertainty to the overall benefit of this combination. 
Of note, data from the BOSTON study comparing the efficacy and safety of selinexor in combination 
with bortezomib and low-dose dexamethasone (SVd) versus Vd in patients with RRMM, who had 
received 1 to 3 prior anti-MM regimens became available while this procedure was ongoing. A 
summary of top line results from this study was provided by the applicant as supportive data. The 
value of data from the BOSTON study to address remaining uncertainties is recognised, particularly in 
terms of being able to provide comparative safety data even if neither the disease treatment setting is 
the same nor the dose used. Further, interpretable randomised data on time to an event endpoint will 
be available. However, this does not mean that results from the BOSTON study could be used for an 
initial decision on the benefit/risk ratio of a different combination in a different treatment setting. 
Selinexor as monotherapy does not appear to be active, and it is only when it is given in combination 
with other drugs when it can be considered effective. In fact the applicant claims a synergistic effect 
for some combinations. With this in mind different combinations might provide differential efficacy and 
therefore discussions/conclusions should be separate ones. In addition, the disease context can also 
module the response to treatment so that benefit/risk assessment needs to be conducted on the basis 
of data generated for the specific combination in the intended treatment setting (i.e. the STORM 
study).  
Taking into account the above uncertainties, a more restricted indication on the basis of data reported 
in the 83 patients of the STORM study whose disease was refractory to bortezomib, carfilzomib, 
lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and daratumumab (penta- refractory) was agreed by the CHMP.  
The ORR in the updated population was 25.3% (95% CI: 16.3, 36) and median time to first response 
3.9 weeks. Among the 21 responders, 1 had a complete response (CR), 4 had a very good partial 
response (VGPR), and 16 had a partial response (PR). In addition, 10 patients had a minimal response 
(MR), 32 had stable disease (SD), and 20 had progressive disease (PD) or were not evaluable. ORR 
decreases with each subsequent therapy in relapsed/refractory patients and complete responses are 
rarely achieved. With this in mind, and even if some responses were challenged during previous 
assessment rounds within the procedure, the reported ORR can be considered as relevant in the 
intended treatment indication (penta-refractory) and expected to translate into clinically meaningful 
benefit. The duration of the responses normally decreases after each line of therapy, as the disease 
becomes increasingly refractory. In the penta-refractory MM population (n=83) of the STORM study 
the reported median DOR was 3.8 months (95% CI: 2.3, 10.8). Median OS was 8.4 months (95% CI: 
5.9; 11.2) with a longer OS for patients having a response of PR or better, however OS data are to be 
carefully interpreted in the context of a single arm trial.  
Additional expert consultation 
A Scientific Advisory Group in Oncology (SAG-O) was asked to provide their view on the two following 
questions:  
1.  Do available data indicate clinically meaningful efficacy in the sought indication?   
2.  Is the observed safety profile of selinexor acceptable in the proposed target population? 
The SAG-O meeting took place on 30th November 2020. The final minutes on the question 1 are included 
below. For the minutes on question 2, please see section 2.6.1. Discussion on Clinical Safety.  
Do available data indicate clinically meaningful efficacy in the sought indication? 
Assessment report

Page 96/138 
 
 
 
 
 
The SAG considered the arguments presented by the Rapporteurs and the applicant company and 
discussed the claimed indication and the design and results of the “STORM” study.  
In terms of the proposed indication, patients with multiple myeloma that recurred or was refractory to 
multiple therapies including the most active agents, the SAG agreed that there is a large unmet 
medical need based on the very short survival (median OS was 8.4 months in the STORM trial). In this 
indication, in the absence of curative treatments, active agents to keep the disease under control for 
as long as possible are needed. Such agents should also not hamper subsequent treatments as they 
become available. 
The level of activity for selinexor in combination with low-dose dexamethasone in terms of PR and CR 
in the pivotal STORM trial was claimed to be 26.2% (95% CI: 18.7%; 35.0%). Despite some possible 
reclassifications based on different adjudication criteria, the antitumour activity has been clearly 
shown. Furthermore, there was also activity classified as minor response (13.1%). 
Antitumour activity attributable to selinexor has been observed despite the fact that trial design was in 
combination with low-dose dexamethasone, based on indirect comparisons: Although robust estimates 
of ORR for low dose dexamethasone in this population are not available, high-dose dexamethasone in 
an earlier line of treatment (likely more effective than low-dose dexamethasone in a more advanced 
setting of the STORM trial) was associated with 10% ORR (San Miguel et al., 2013).  
One SAG member disagreed, pointing out an ORR of >20% was reported as described in a review by 
Burwick and Sharma 2018. Also, in pretreated patients comparing thalidomide with dexamethasone, 
the response rate for dexamethasone high was 25% (Kropff, et al. 2012). In a randomised trial in 
previously pretreated patients comparing carfilzomib vs. lo-dose dexamethasone, the ORR was 11%, 
MR was 9% and stable disease was 47% for low-dose dexamethasone. There was no PFS and OS 
benefit for the experimental arm with carfilzomib (Hájek et al. 2017). 
Objective response is considered of clinical relevance for patients in this indication provided it is 
sufficiently likely and of sufficient duration. The ORR associated with selinexor+dexamethasone was 
claimed to be about 26.2%, and the median duration of response was 4.4 months. In absolute terms, 
the ORR (also considering re-classification) was rather low and duration of response was considered 
rather short but still of sufficient magnitude to be of clinical relevance for patients who observe a 
response and in the range of what observed with alternative treatments in this multiple-
relapsed/refractory setting with short expected survival.  
Some SAG members disagreed, considering that we do not know, whether the ORR is of relevant 
clinical benefit in lack of randomised trials and in respect to the limited patient number included. 
The magnitude of activity in terms of ORR is in the range of another product that has been recently 
approved under conditional marketing authorisation (belantamab; 32%; 95% CI:21%; 46%) in a 
similar population (7 median no. of prior treatments).  
Despite all the known biases of responder-analyses, some support was also provided by looking at the 
association between response and OS with censoring for subsequent treatments, the fact that some 
responders experienced survival duration of over 24 months, as well as high-level results from the 
BOSTON trial reporting a beneficial effect of selinexor in combination with bortezomib and 
dexamethasone in terms of PFS in earlier stages of treatment of the disease (1-3 prior lines). Selinexor 
did not appear to hamper the number of subsequent treatments. One SAG member added that it is 
interesting to know how many patients with myeloma will come to the moment they are fit enough to 
be included for this treatment. The population in the Boston and Storm trials is heavily selected. 
One SAG member also pointed out that there might, be also a bias in selecting patients. “Refractory” 
has not been clearly defined (primary or secondary refractory?). Additionally, it is not clear whether 
Assessment report

patients have been in last line, as a remarkable proportion of patients received a subsequent therapy. 
It is not clear, whether is due to the response by selixenor or whether the patient had further 
treatment options besides selixenor. 
The probability of observing a response and disease control for some months, and any existing 
uncertainties about other outcomes, should be part of individual clinical benefit-risk decisions taking 
also expected toxicity into account. It is understood that, as for many treatment options in this difficult 
stage of treatment of the disease, treatment with selinexor + dexamethasone may not be the 
preferred treatment option for all patients in the claimed indication. (One SAG member questioned how 
the claimed patient population was defined.) 
In conclusion, the SAG agreed that in the claimed indication, given the high unmet need, the observed 
ORR is expected to be associated with a clinical benefit in patients who respond and although low, the 
activity is considered sufficient to be of benefit to some patients in the proposed indication. However, 
two SAG members considered that we know that ORR is not the relevant endpoint to consider a benefit 
for the overall population. There is no comparison of PFS and OS in this patient population to other 
options. Also, one member considered that the first endpoint should have been quality of life. 
The SAG found that the applicant company has conducted a valuable exploration of possible 
biomarkers for efficacy. This effort should be pursued in order to optimise treatment decisions by 
identifying patients most likely to respond.    
The SAG regretted the lack of a comparative study to confirm an effect on OS, PFS, and health-related 
quality of life in the claimed indication. Some members underlined feasibility of a randomised 
controlled trial in terms of number of patients while others underlined the difficulty of conducting 
randomised trials in this advanced setting. The BOSTON study may provide some level of support to 
confirm the safety and efficacy of the drug in the claimed indication although extrapolations across 
different stages of treatment of the disease require strong assumptions.  
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
Based on the observed efficacy in study KCP-330-012/STORM, a clinical benefit for selinexor in 
combination with dexamethasone can be considered established, but a confirmation from a phase 3 
comparative study is needed in order to confirm the magnitude of the effect.  
To provide additional evidence of the clinical benefits observed in study KCP-330-012/STORM and in 
order to fulfil a CMA, the applicant is requested by the CHMP to provide the final results of the BOSTON 
study, a phase 3, randomised, active comparator-controlled, open-label, multicentre (sites worldwide) 
study to compare the efficacy and assess the safety of selinexor plus bortezomib plus low-dose 
dexamethasone (SVd) versus bortezomib plus low dose dexamethasone (Vd) in ~364 adult patients 
with RRMM who have received 1 to 3 prior anti-MM regimens, with data cut-off February 2021) as a 
Specific Obligation.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The reported ORR of 25.3% (95% CI: 16.3, 36) in the penta-refractory group of patients (n=83) from 
the STORM study can be considered as relevant in the intended treatment setting and expected to 
translate into clinically meaningful benefit in the proposed target population. 
However, efficacy results from a comparative study is needed in order to confirm the magnitude of the 
effect.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021

The CHMP considers the following measure necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of selinexor in combination with dexamethasone in the 
treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients who have received at least four prior therapies and 
whose disease is refractory to at least two proteasome inhibitors, two immunomodulatory agents and 
an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last 
therapy, the MAH should submit the results of the phase 3, KCP-330-023/BOSTON study (data cut off 
February 2021), comparing the efficacy and safety of selinexor plus bortezomib plus low-dose 
dexamethasone versus bortezomib plus low dose dexamethasone in adult patients with 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have received 1 to 3 prior anti-MM regimens.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety evaluation is based on data from 1265 patients from 8 clinical trials evaluating selinexor in 
advanced, heavily pretreated, haematological malignancies including 552 patients with MM.  
Of these, 214 patients from studies KPT-330-012 and KPT-330-001 represent the main safety dataset. 
Study KPT-330-012 (STORM) is the pivotal study; it is a phase 2, single arm, open-label study of Sd in 
patients with heavily pre-treated RRMM. The study initially enrolled 79 patients in Part 1 followed by 
Part 2, which was a separate cohort, with 123 patients. Part 2 included patients with penta-exposed 
and triple-class refractory MM that was refractory to the last line of therapy. Study KPT-330-001 was a 
Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study. In this study, 12 of the 285 patients included had heavily 
pre-treated RRMM and were treated with Sd. 
The applicant has provided an analysis of data from patients included in the safety analyses based on 
various pools: 
•  All Heme – Single Agent (±dex) Pool: Comprised of 996 patients with different types of 
haematologic malignancies (All HM) from Studies 001, KCP-330-008, KCP-330-009, KCP-
330010, STORM, and KCP-330-013. Patients received single agent selinexor (with or without 
dexamethasone). 
•  All MM Pool: Comprised of 552 patients with MM who were treated in Studies 001, STORM, and 
the ongoing studies KCP-330-017 and KCP-330-023 with different selinexor dose levels and 
combination treatment regimens.  
The safety data from the All Heme – Single Agent (±dex) Pool and the All MM Pool were combined for 
some analyses (total safety population). 
In the All MM Pool Sd group, 214 patients received at least 1 dose of selinexor. The median duration of 
exposure for the Sd group was 8.5 weeks (range 1 to 76) with a median of 11 doses (range 1 to 135) 
received and a median total dose of 830 mg (range 80 to 6220). Most patients in the Sd group 
received treatment for either 4 to <12 weeks (85 [39.7%] patients) or 12 to <24 weeks (51 [23.8%] 
patients). The median dose intensity was 112.4 mg/week (range 22 to 240) with a relative dose 
intensity of 77.8% (range 29 to 116) relative to starting dose. The median percent dose compliance 
was 100% (range 64 to 100).

In the Sd group, all 214 (100%) patients had at least 1 TEAE. The most common nonhaematological 
TEAEs in the Sd group (occurring in ≥25% of patients) were nausea (160 [74.8%] patients), fatigue 
(142 [66.4%] patients), decreased appetite (120 [56.1%] patients), decreased weight (105 [49.1%] 
patients), diarrhoea (101[47.2%] patients), vomiting (91 [42.5%] patients), hyponatraemia (85 
[39.7%] patients), and dyspnoea (56 [26.2%] patients). The most common haematological TEAEs in 
the All MM Pool Sd group (occurring in ≥25% of patients) were thrombocytopenia (161 [75.2%] 
patients), anaemia (129[60.3%] patients), neutropenia (78 [36.4%] patients), and leukopenia (64 
[29.9%] patients.

In Sd group, 205 (95.8%) patients had at least 1 ≥Grade 3 TEAE, 99 (46.3%) patients had at least 1 
Grade 4 TEAE, and 20 (9.3%) patients had at least 1 Grade 5 TEAE.  
The most frequently reported Grade ≥3 AEs in the Sd group (occurring in ≥10% of patients) were 
thrombocytopenia (139 [65%] patients), anaemia (94 [43.9%] patients), hyponatraemia (50 [23.4%] 
patients), neutropenia (49 [22.9%] patients), fatigue (43 [20.1%] patients), leukopenia (31 [14.5%] 
patients), lymphopenia (23 [10.7%] patients). Of these, Grade 4 TEAEs included thrombocytopenia 
(87 [40.7%] patients), neutropenia (11 [5.1%] patients), lymphopenia. (7 [3.3%] patients), anaemia 
(5 [2.3%] patients), hyponatraemia (2 [0.9%] patients) and leukopenia (1 [0.5%] patients). The 
majority of Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs of thrombocytopenia were not typically associated with bleeding. 
Of the 139 (65.0%) patients with ≥Grade 3 TEAE of thrombocytopenia, concurrent bleeding events 
(concurrency defined as ±5 days) of ≥Grade 3 were reported in 7 (5.0%; 7/139) patients. The event 
terms for bleeding events by PT included: rectal haemorrhage (2 patients), subdural haematoma (2 
patients), and epistaxis, tumour haemorrhage, and procedural haemorrhage (1 patient each).

Deaths 
In the total safety population, 173 (13.7%) patients had at least 1 treatment-emergent fatal AE. The 
most frequent fatal TEAEs were sepsis (31 [2.5%] patients) and pneumonia (30 [2.4%] patients). The 
majority of cases of fatal pneumonia occurred in Study KCP-330-008/SOPRA (6.1%) in patients with 
relapsed/refractory AML, compared to the other studies. Other fatal TEAEs occurring in more than 2 
patients included respiratory failure (9 [0.7%] patients), febrile neutropenia (8 [0.6%] patients; 7 
patients from Study KCP-330-008/SOPRA), general physical health deterioration (7 [0.6%] patients), 
lung infection (7 [0.6%] patients), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (7 [0.6%] patients), cerebral 
haemorrhage (5 [0.4%] patients), death (5 [0.4%] patients), malignant neoplasm progression (5 
[0.4%] patients), intracranial haemorrhage (4 [0.3%] patients), and subdural haematoma 
(3 [0.2%] patients). All other fatal TEAEs occurred in 1 or 2 patients. 
In study KPT-330-012 a total of 48 patients have died within 30 days of last dose of selinexor (20 in 
Part 1 and 28 in Part 2).  
Out of 20 patients in Part 1, 12 patients were reported to have died due to disease progression and 8 
patients were reported to have died due to TEAEs (1 patient had two TEAEs with a fatal outcome). The 
event terms included cardio-respiratory arrest (2), respiratory failure (1), influenza (1), multiple-organ 
dysfunction syndrome (1), ascites (1), plasma cell leukaemia (1), dyspnoea (1), and subdural 
haematoma (1). Of these only 1 event of subdural haematoma (Patient 0033-002) was assessed by 
the investigator as related to selinexor.  
Out of a total 28 patients on Part 2 of the study, the cause of death was reported as disease 
progression in 15 patients, 12 patients were reported to have died due to a TEAE, and the cause of

death was not reported for 1 patient. Of the 12 patients who died due to a TEAE, 3 were assessed by 
the investigator as related to selinexor and 9 were assessed as not related by the investigator.

In the Sd group, the most frequently reported shifts from baseline to a worst on-study value ≥ Grade 3 
were thrombocytopenia (144 [69.2%] patients), anaemia (102 [49%] patients), lymphocytopenia (93 
[46.7%] patients), leukopenia (82 [39.4%] patients), and neutropenia (69 [33.5%] patients).

In the Sd group, the most frequently reported shifts from baseline clinical chemistry parameters to a 
worst post-baseline value ≥ Grade 3 (occurring in ≥5% of patients) were hyponatraemia (64 [30.0%] 
patients), hyperglycaemia (27 [12.9%] patients), hypophosphataemia (21 [11.4%] patients), 
hypokalaemia (19 [8.9%] patients), increased creatinine (19 [8.9%] patients), and hyperlipasaemia (9 
[5.1%] patients).  
ECG 
The ECG issue and the possible QTc interval concern is further commented in the PD section. Selinexor 
is not expected to cause clinically relevant QTc prolongation at the therapeutic dose concentrations of 
selinexor.  
Safety in special populations 
An analysis of safety data by age, sex or race did not identified clinically meaningful differences, 
although there were some imbalances in the incidence of certain AEs.  
An increased frequency of nausea, anaemia, neutropenia and vomiting was reported in female patients 
compared to male patients. Infections were also more common in female than in male (61% vs 45.6%, 
respectively), mainly upper respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections. Vision blurred was 
reported in 14% of patients in the Sd group; frequency was higher in women (23%) compared to men 
(6.1%).  
An increased frequency of pneumonia and decreased appetite was also observed in patients ≥75 years. 
Regarding race, the small number of patients included in some of the subgroups makes difficult to 
draw conclusions.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of selinexor is based on data from 1265 patients with advanced haematological 
malignancies (MM, AML, NHL) treated with selinexor in 8 clinical trials, most of them are Phase 1 or 
Phase 2 uncontrolled studies (only data from an ongoing Phase 3 study have been included in the 
integrated summary of safety analysis), in which selinexor was administered in different dosing 
regimens and combinations. This application is mainly based on two studies of the above-mentioned, 
the KCP-330-012 study, which is the pivotal study, and the KCP-330-001 study, a dose-escalation 
Phase 1 study. In total, 214 patients received selinexor at the proposed dosing regimen (80 mg twice 
weekly or 45 mg/m2 combined with low dose dexamethasone), for the treatment of RRMM. Study KCP-
330-012 included 202 patients with heavily pre-treated MM, of whom 83 patients included in Part 2 of 
the study represent the penta-refractory intended target population (i.e. refractory to bortezomib, 
carfilzomib, lenalidomide, pomalidomide and daratumumab). Additionally, 12 patients (with MM 
previously treated with, and relapsed or refractory to, ≥3 prior regimens) from study KCP-330-001 
have been included in the safety dataset. Safety data of these 1256 patients have been presented as 
pooled data. Data of the 214 patients treated with selinexor+dexamethasone (Sd Pool) is considered 
the main safety dataset. However, the total safety population has been taken into account to obtain a 
broader perspective of the safety profile of selinexor. 
The absence of a control arm in study KCP-330-012/STORM is one of the limitations of this safety 
dataset, especially in this setting of a heavily pre-treated population, as it makes difficult to establish 
to what extent adverse events reported in patients treated with selinexor could be related to the study 
treatment or on the contrary they were associated with the underlying disease and previous treatment 
received. 
In the Sd Pool the median duration of therapy was 8.5 weeks (range: 1, 76), with a median of doses 
received of 11 (range: 1, 135). Duration of exposure was ≥24 weeks for 31 (14.5%) patients, of whom 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 118/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 (2.3%) received selinexor for 48 weeks or more. Therefore, rare adverse events could be 
underestimated or even not estimated.  
Overall, selinexor tolerability appears to be low, according to the high number of patients that required 
dose modification (dose reduction and/or dose interruption) due to AEs (73.8%). At the database cut-
off date (7 September 2019), all patients had discontinued study treatment, most of them due to 
disease progression (56.1%). However, it is of concern the high number of patients that discontinued 
treatment due to adverse events. In Part 2 of study STORM, 39 (31.7%) patients discontinued study 
treatment due to adverse events, being nausea (7 patients; 17.9%), fatigue (6 patients; 15.4%), 
weight decreased (5 patients; 12.8%) and asthenia (5 patients; 12.8%) the leading causes.  
Per protocol, patients included in Part 2 of study KCP-330-012 received a dose of 80 mg twice weekly 
(days 1 and 3 of each week) continuously in 4-weeks cycles combined with dexamethasone 20 mg 
twice-weekly (in Part 1 of the study, selinexor was administered twice weekly for 3 weeks of each 4-
weeks cycle). However, in select cases, after 2 cycles of treatment, the selinexor dose could be 
increased to 100 mg (<70 mg/m2) twice weekly (after discussion with the Sponsor) based on efficacy 
considerations. There were only two patients who had their doses increased to 100 mg BIW and two 
additional patients that received 100 mg but once a week instead of twice a week. The proposed dose 
for selinexor is mainly based on study KCP-330-001, in which 81 patients with MM were included; 12 of 
these 81 patients received selinexor 45 mg/m2 in combination with 20 dexamethasone twice weekly. 
According to the applicant, the selected dose showed anti-MM activity with a better safety profile than 
higher doses used (60 mg/m2).  
Adverse events 
All patients in the Sd Pool experienced an AE and most of them were considered treatment-related 
(98.6%). The most commonly reported (≥30%) AEs were nausea (74.8%), thrombocytopenia 
(75.2%), fatigue (66.4%), anaemia (60.3%), decreased appetite (56.1%), weight decreased (49.1%), 
diarrhoea (47.2%), vomiting (42.5%), hyponatraemia (39.7%) and neutropenia (36.4%) (SmPC, 
section 4.8) 
Overall, the safety profile was comparable with that observed for the total safety population (n=1265), 
although the incidence of these commonly reported AEs was higher in the Sd Pool, specially weight 
decreased (28.5%) and anaemia (41.7%).  
With regard to grade ≥3 AEs, they were reported in 99% of patients. The most frequently reported 
grade ≥3 AEs were thrombocytopenia (65%), anaemia (43.9%), hyponatraemia (23.4%), neutropenia 
(22.9%), fatigue (20.1%), leukopenia (14.5%) and lymphopenia (10.7%) reported in more than 10% 
of patients. Thrombocytopenia was also the most common grade 4 AE (SmPC, section 4.8). 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
SAEs were reported by 60.7% of patients. Overall, pneumonia and sepsis were the most common SAEs 
reported (16 [7.5%] and 13 [6.1%], respectively). Nearly half of SAEs (27.6%) were considered by 
the investigator as treatment-related, being thrombocytopenia (4.7%), fatigue (2.8%), pneumonia, 
dehydration and hyponatraemia (2.3% each) the most frequent treatment-related SAEs (SmPC, 
section 4.8). 
In the overall population treated with selinexor, either as monotherapy (±dexa) or in combination, 
pneumonia and sepsis were also the most commonly reported SAEs.  
Deaths 
In the study KPT-330-012 a total of 48 patients died within 30 days of last dose of selinexor (20 in Part 
1 and 28 in Part 2 – Cut-off date7 September 2019). Disease progression was the cause of death in 27 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 119/138 
 
 
 
 
patients, whereas in 20 (9.9%) patients the cause of death was a fatal AE. Sepsis (4 [2.0%]), subdural 
haematoma, cardio-respiratory arrest and pneumonia, (2 [1.0%], each) were the main causes of 
deaths. The listed causes of death are commonly seen in heavily treated RRMM patients. There were 
12 deaths in STORM/Part 2 of which 6 were under the SOC Infections and Infestations; as this is not 
uncommon in this heavily treated population the contribution of selinexor is difficult to assess.  
In the total safety population (n=1265), sepsis (31 [2.5%]) and pneumonia (30 [2.4%) were the main 
fatal AEs. There were also approximately 1% of deaths related to haemorrhagic AEs.  
Adverse events of special interest (AEOSIs) 
Haematological adverse events were commonly reported in patients treated with selinexor in clinical 
trials. Of these, thrombocytopenia was the most commonly reported AE. In the Sd Pool it was the most 
frequent grade 4 adverse event reported in patients treated with selinexor (40.7%) and one of the 
leading causes to treatment discontinuation due to AEs (6 [2.8%] patients). In study KPT-330-012 
around 18% of the patients who had AEs of thrombocytopenia received supportive care within 5 days. 
Thrombopoietin receptor agonists such as romiplostim, could also be used. Haemorrhagic AEs could be 
related to thrombocytopenia as the cause. However, despite the high incidence of grade ≥ 3 
thrombocytopenia AEs with selinexor, the incidence of bleeding events was relatively low. In study 
KPT-330-012 of the 124 patients with grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, 5 (4%) patients had a concomitant 
grade ≥ 3 or serious bleeding event, one of them fatal (subdural haematoma). Thrombocytopenia can 
be managed with dose interruptions, modifications, platelet transfusions, and/or other treatments as 
clinically indicated (SmPC, section 4.4). Other haematological AEOSI were neutropenia and anaemia. 
Patients with neutropenia could receive granulocyte colony stimulating factors (GCSF) (SmPC, section 
4.4). The incidence of febrile neutropenia in patient treated with selinexor for MM was low. 
Gastrointestinal AEs were frequently reported in selinexor clinical trials, mainly diarrhoea, nausea and 
vomiting. Most of the events of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were grade 1 or grade 2 and no fatal 
AEs were reported. In the Sd Pool 15 (7%) patients discontinued treatment due to nausea/vomiting 
and 2 (0.9%) patients due to diarrhoea. In addition, adverse events such as fatigue, decreased 
appetite and weight decreased were also commonly reported in patients treated with selinexor and 
have been included as important identified risks in the RMP. The majority of these AEs were grade 1 or 
grade 2 and incidence of SAEs was low. However, rates of treatment discontinuation due to these AEs 
is of concern. In the Sd Pool (n=214), fatigue, decreased appetite, weigh decreased and asthenia 
accounts for approximately 50% of selinexor treatment discontinuations due to AEs. A similar pattern 
is observed in study KCP-330-008, a randomised, phase 2 study in elderly patients (≥60 years) with 
relapsed or refractory AML, in which the incidence of these AEs was also higher in patients treated with 
selinexor compared to those that received Physician´s choice. Furthermore, a reduced food intake 
leading to weight loss was also observed in studies performed in animals. 
The exact mechanism associated to these AEs (i.e., nausea, vomiting, fatigue, decreased appetite, 
weight decreased) is not clear but it is considered they might be mediated by CNS toxicity and not due 
to peripheral effects. Other XPO-1 inhibitors have been related to adverse drug reactions such as 
anorexia, nausea, fatigue, and weight loss (Newlands ES 1996; Hing 2016), considered all of them as a 
class effect. Adverse events of fatigue, anorexia and weight loss reported with XPO-1 inhibitors have 
been postulated to be related to their ability to cross the BBB (Hing 2016).  
Nervous system disorders such as confusional state and dizziness are AEs of special interest reported 
in patients treated with selinexor. The exact mechanism of action associated with these AEs is 
unknown and although other confounding factors were present, a causal association between selinexor 
and AEs of confusional state and dizziness cannot be ruled out. In the Sd Pool, confusional state was 
reported in 38 (17.8%) patients, of which in 13 (6.1%) patients were considered as SAE and there 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 120/138 
 
 
 
 
were 5 (2.3%) patients that discontinued selinexor treatment due to confusional state. Dizziness was 
reported in 16% of patients. Additionally, 3 cases of acute cerebellar syndrome (ACS) have been 
reported in selinexor clinical trials. One of the cases was reported in a patient with pancreatic cancer 
and the other two in paediatric patients with AML. According to the applicant these patients were 
receiving higher doses (85 mg/m2 adult patient and 70 mg/m2 in children) of selinexor and all cases 
were reversible. No events of ACS have been reported in the Sd Pool. However, central nervous 
toxicity (i.e. necrosis of cerebellar granular cells) has been observed in non-clinical trials. Therefore, 
ACS is considered an important potential risk of selinexor (see Risk Management Plan). 
Hyponatraemia was frequently reported. In the Sd Pool 23.8% of patients experienced hyponatraemia 
of grade ≥3 (two of them of grade 4), although in general it was manageable. The mechanism by 
which selinexor causes hyponatraemia has not been fully clarified. According to the applicant it seems 
to be related to (renal) sodium loss, rather than other causes such as SIADH or a more general diuretic 
effect.  
Among patients treated with selinexor in clinical trials, 4 cases of TLS have been reported (1 in the Sd 
Pool). The association of selinexor and TLS is not completely clear; however, considering it is related to 
a significant morbidity, the applicant has included TLS as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
Infections and eye disorders were also included as AEs of special interest.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions 
Clinical experience of selinexor with a large variety of co-administered drugs suggests a lack of DDI 
potential of selinexor. See pharmacology section for further information.  
Laboratory findings 
Overall, the laboratory findings are reflecting the safety profile of this drug. Thrombocytopenia, 
anaemia, neutropenia, leukopenia and hyponatraemia were the most commonly reported.  
Shifts commonly observed in other clinical chemistry parameters to a worst post-baseline value (grade 
≥3) in the Sd Pool were hyperglycaemia (12.9%), hypophosphataemia (11.4%), hypokalaemia (8.9%) 
and creatinine increased (8.9%). 
ALT and AST increased have been reported in patients treated with selinexor (26.8% and 25.4%, 
respectively). Most of them were grade 1 or grade 2 (shifts from baseline to a post-baseline value 
grade ≥3 was reported in 2.8% and 1.9% patients, respectively). One patient had a hepatic grade 4 
SAE (liver transaminases just below 4000 U/L) considered “probably or definitely related” (it took 
about 25 days for this to resolve). One reduced dose of 60 mg selinexor was given after this and 
ALT/AST were normal one week after this, but then treatment was apparently discontinued.  
Lypase and amylase increased have been reported in 15.4% and 15.8% of patients in Sd Pool, 
respectively, of which 5.1% and 2.3% were shifts to grade 3 or 4. Moreover, two events of pancreatitis 
have been reported among patients treated with selinexor; one in study STORM, which was considered 
by the investigator treatment-related and the other in study 008, in patients with AML. 
Subgroups of special interest 
An analysis of safety data by age, sex or race did not identified clinically meaningful differences, 
although there were some imbalances in the incidence of certain AEs. An increased frequency of 
nausea, anaemia, neutropenia and vomiting was reported in female patients compared to male 
patients. Infections were also more common in female than in male (61% vs 45.6%, respectively), 
mainly upper respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections. Blurred vision was reported in 
14% of patients in the Sd group; frequency was higher in women (23%) compared to men (6.1%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 121/138 
 
 
 
 
However, considering all the available data, a higher risk of blurred vision in women compared to men 
due to selinexor treatment is not expected. 
An increased frequency of pneumonia and decreased appetite was also observed in patients ≥75 years. 
Regarding race, the small number of patients included in some of the subgroups makes difficult to 
draw conclusions. 
The median age at enrolment of the Sd group and STORM/Part 2 is 64.0 and 65.2 years, respectively. 
Given a median time since diagnosis of 6 years, these patients may not represent the general MM 
population, as the median age at diagnosis in the general population is around 72 years. The low ECOG 
performance score (ECOG 2; 9.3%, the rest had ECOG 0 or 1) in this heavily treated population most 
likely reflects the relatively young study population. Selinexor usage in a real-life cohort of MM 
patients, which on average are older than in the study, could potentially lead to even more adverse 
events including severe and serious. 
It should be noticed that at least seven cases of selinexor overdose have been reported in clinical 
trials, most of them in study KCP-330-023 (BOSTON), in which selinexor is administered at a dose of 
100 mg once a week. Considering the toxicity associated to selinexor and the potential risk of 
medication errors (i.e. taking daily instead of twice a week), medication errors has been included as an 
important potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Selinexor may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of 
action and findings in animals. Males and females of reproductive potential should be advised to use 
highly effective contraception during treatment with selinexor. There are no data on the presence of 
selinexor in human milk or its effects on breastfed infants or on milk production. Due to the potential 
for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from selinexor, it is advised that lactating women not 
breastfeed during selinexor treatment or for 1 week following the final dose (SmPC, sections 4.4, 4.6 
and 5.3). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Additional expert consultations 
A Scientific Advisory Group in Oncology (SAG-O) was asked to provide their view on the two following 
questions:  
1. 
2. 
Do available data indicate clinically meaningful efficacy in the sought indication?   
Is the observed safety profile of selinexor acceptable in the proposed target population? 
This SAG-O meeting took place on 30th November 2020. The final minutes on the question 2 are included 
below. For the minutes on question 1, please see section 2.5.3. Discussion on Clinical Efficacy.  
Is the observed safety profile of selinexor acceptable in the proposed target population? 
The observed toxicity in the STORM study was clinically significant, including frequent severe 
haematological toxicity, especially thrombocytopenia and anaemia, and frequent severe nausea and 
vomiting, and fatigue. However, this level of toxicity is not considered exceptional in this advanced 
haematological malignancy setting, and generally manageable with adequate monitoring and dose 
adjustment or discontinuation.  
Optimal risk minimisation measures in terms of dose modifications and supportive care should be 
implemented, as well as monitoring of toxicity in the real-life setting. The claim that such measures are 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 122/138 
 
 
 
 
effective in the post-marketing data available to the company should be explored to confirm the 
appropriateness of current risk minimisation measures. 
In conclusion, the safety profile is acceptable taking into consideration other treatments in this setting, 
and well-characterised to allow informed individual clinical benefit-risk decisions. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
Additional comparative safety data from the confirmatory study BOSTON, a phase 3, randomised, 
active comparator-controlled, open-label, multicentre (sites worldwide) study to compare the efficacy 
and assess the safety of selinexor plus bortezomib plus low-dose dexamethasone (SVd) versus 
bortezomib plus low dose dexamethasone (Vd) in ~364 adult patients with RRMM who have received 1 
to 3 prior anti-MM regimens (data cut-off February 2021) will be provided as part of the specific 
obligation in order to fulfil a CMA and will allow a better characterisation and contextualisation of the 
safety profile of selinexor. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the tolerability of selinexor appears to be low. However, even if the toxicity of selinexor is not 
negligible,  the  safety  profile  in  the  target  population  can  be  considered  generally  manageable  with 
adequate  monitoring  and  dose  adjustment  or  discontinuation.  The  fact  that  the  safety  profile  in  the 
penta-refractory  population  was  consistent  with  the  safety  for  the  whole  population  in  STORM  Part  2 
(n=123) concerning all AEs, SAEs and discontinuations due to AEs, with no new safety signals having 
been observed, is reassuring, since these patients are the most heavily pre-treated patients in the whole 
population included in the STORM study.   
The safety has been considered sufficiently characterised in the context of a conditional MA. Additional 
data from the BOSTON study, i.e., a phase 3, randomised, active comparator-controlled, open-label, 
multicentre (sites worldwide) study to compare the efficacy and assess the safety of selinexor plus 
bortezomib plus low-dose dexamethasone (SVd) versus bortezomib plus low dose dexamethasone (Vd) 
in ~402 adult patients with RRMM who have received 1 to 3 prior anti-MM regimens will be provided in 
support of the overall safety profile of selinexor. 
The CHMP considers the following measure necessary to address the missing safety data in the context 
of a conditional MA: 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of selinexor in combination with dexamethasone in the 
treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients who have received at least four prior therapies and 
whose disease is refractory to at least two proteasome inhibitors, two immunomodulatory agents and 
an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last 
therapy, the MAH should submit the results of the phase 3, KCP-330-023/BOSTON study (data cut off 
Feb 2021), comparing the efficacy and safety of selinexor plus bortezomib plus low-dose 
dexamethasone versus bortezomib plus low dose dexamethasone in adult patients with 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have received 1 to 3 prior anti-MM regimens.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with 
the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 03.07.2019. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the 
IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of selinexor with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers selinexor to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Nexpovio (selinexor) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as: 
• 
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU 
It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation [REG Art 14-a] 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Nexpovio, in combination with dexamethasone, is indicated for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult 
patients, who have received at least four prior therapies and whose disease is refractory to at least two 
proteasome inhibitors, two immunomodulatory agents, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and who 
have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current treatment of MM includes glucocorticoids (dexamethasone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone), 
chemotherapy, primarily alkylating agents, including high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem 
cell transplantation (ASCT), proteasome inhibitors (PIs, such as bortezomib, carfilzomib and ixazomib), 
immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs, such as thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide), monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs, such as daratumumab, isatuximab and elotuzumab) and the histone deacetylase 
inhibitor panobinostat. There is a clear unmet medical need for new therapies because the treatment 
options are very limited and their median overall survival is around 3-5 months. 
With the approval of daratumumab and its wide use in combinations in earlier lines of MM treatment, a 
new population of patients is created who have become refractory to all available agents (including 
daratumumab). This population can be referred to as triple-class refractory MM and it encompasses those 
patients with disease refractory to at least 1 PI, 1 IMiD, and 1 anti-CD38 mAb. 
Penta-exposed  MM  is  defined  as  MM  previously  treated  with  bortezomib,  carfilzomib,  lenalidomide, 
pomalidomide, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (mAb; either daratumumab or isatuximab). 
Penta refractory MM has been defined as disease refractory to prior treatment with at least two proteasome 
inhibitors  (PIs;  bortezomib  and  carfilzomib),  two  immunomodulatory  drugs  (IMiDs;  lenalidomide  and 
pomalidomide), and one anti-CD38 mAb (daratumumab or isatuximab). 
Although survival outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) have significantly improved over the 
past 2 decades due primarily to the introduction of novel classes of drugs, myeloma cells invariably acquire 
resistance, and nearly all patients develop disease that is refractory to the available therapies. Therefore, 
development of therapies with new mechanisms of action to overcome drug resistance would be important 
to address unmet medical needs in heavily pre-treated population. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical package of Nexpovio was primarily supported by data from a Phase 2, multicentre, single-arm, 
open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of selinexor in patients with penta-exposed, 
triple-class refractory MM (Study KCP-330-012/STORM, part 2). STORM Part 2 required patients to have 
measurable disease per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, have previously received 
three or more antimyeloma treatment regimens including an alkylating agent, glucocorticoids, bortezomib, 
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 129/138 
 
 
 
 
carfilzomib, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody; and whose myeloma was 
documented to be refractory to glucocorticoids, a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, an 
anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and to the last line of therapy. Patients had to have an ECOG 
performance status score ≤2, adequate hepatic, renal and haematopoietic function. Systemic light chain 
amyloidosis, active central nervous system myeloma, peripheral neuropathy of grade 3 or higher, or 
painful neuropathy of grade 2 or higher were exclusion criteria. 
Patients were treated with 80 mg selinexor in combination with 20 mg dexamethasone on Days 1 and 3 of 
every week. Treatment continued until disease progression, death or unacceptable toxicity. 
Part 1 of the KCP-330-012/STORM study (supportive study) included both patients with quad-exposed MM, 
double-class refractory MM as well as a subset with penta-exposed, triple-class refractory MM. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
For patients treated in Part 2 of STORM (pivotal study of this application) 
• 
• 
• 
The ORR per IRC was 25.3 % (95% CI: 16.3, 36), which included 1 (1.2%) patient with an 
sCR/CR, 4 (4.8%) patients with a VGPR, and 16 (19.3%) patients with a PR; 10 (12.0%) patients 
had MR, 32 (38.6%) patients had SD, and 20 (24.1%) patients had PD/NE. The CBR was 37.3% 
(95% CI: 27.0, 48.7), which included all patients with an MR or better. The median time to 
response of PR or better was 3.9 weeks (range: 1-10). 
For patients with a response, the median DoR per IRC was 3.8 months (95% CI: 2.3, 10.8). 
The median OS was 8.4 months (95% CI: 5.9, 11.2) 
For patients treated in Part 1 (supportive data) 
• 
• 
• 
the ORR per IRC was 20.3% (95% CI: 12.0, 30.8), which included 4 (5.1%) patients with VGPR, 
and 12 (15.2%) patients with a PR; 9 (11.4%) of patients had MR, 30 (38.0%) patients had SD, 
and 24 (30.4%) patients had PD/NE. The median time to response of PR or better was 4.1 weeks 
(range: 2-8). 
For patients with a response, the median DOR per IRC was 6.2 months (95% CI: 3.6, 9.8). 
The median OS was 9.3 months (95% CI: 5.8, 11.3). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The major uncertainty in evaluating the above results is due to the single arm design and lack of a 
comparator in the STORM study part 2. ORR as a primary endpoint is acceptable from a regulatory 
perspective, but the design of the study hinders an appropriate estimation of the actual benefit in terms of 
how the observed antitumour activity translates into an effect on time to event long term endpoints.  
Further, the single arm design does not allow to isolate the contribution of the two components of the 
combination. Of note, based in study KCP-330-001, none of the patients exposed to selinexor in 
monotherapy obtained a response, only MR and SD were achieved. With regards to the activity of 
dexamethasone there are some reports in  the literature showing that the use of high dose 
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 130/138 
 
 
 
 
 
dexamethasone could provide response rates of about 20% in patients with 1-3 prior therapies 
(Richardson 2005, Weber 2007) including also the pomalidomide study (Lancet Oncology, 2013) where an 
ORR of 10% was demonstrated in patients treated with high dose dexamethasone in patients having 
received a median number of prior therapies of 5.  The only recent study where a low dose of 
dexamethasone was used as monotherapy in multiple myeloma corresponds to that conducted with 
plitidepsin, i.e. Study APL-C-001-09 (ADMYRE). In that study, plitidepsin in combination with 
dexamethasone vs. dexamethasone alone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma was 
studied. Patients had a median of 4 lines of previous systemic therapies. The ORR in the dexamethasone 
arm (40 mg orally on Day 1, 8, 15 and 22 q4wk) was 1.2 %.  These data contribute to alleviate the 
concerns that the effect observed with selinexor in combination with low dose dexamethasone could be 
mainly driven by the dexamethasone component.  
Although ORR and DoR can be considered relevant endpoints to conclude on an effect likely to translate 
into clinically meaningful benefit in the proposed treatment setting, there is no comparison of PFS and OS 
in this patient population to other options. 
As expected the median OS decreased with age. Median OS in the penta-refractory targeted population 
was 8.4 months (95% CI: 5.9; 11.2) with a longer OS for patients having a response of PR or better. 
However OS data are to be carefully interpreted in the context of a single arm trial. There is a need to 
further quantify the efficacy of selinexor in a comparative trial (Annex II.E). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
This application is mainly based on study KPT-330-012, a phase 2 study, which included 202 patients. 
Additionally, 12 patients from study KPT-330-001 who received Sd at the proposed dosing regimen have 
been included in the safety assessment. Altogether, 214 patients have been treated with selinexor 80 mg 
administered in combination with dexamethasone 20 mg twice weekly. 
Overall the most commonly reported AEs in the Sd group (which included patients from the pivotal study 
KPT-330-012 + 12 patients from study KPT-330-001) were nausea (74.8%), thrombocytopenia (75.2%), 
fatigue (66.4%), anaemia (60.3%), decreased appetite (56.1%), weight decreased (49.1%), diarrhoea 
(47.2%), vomiting (42.5%), hyponatraemia (39.7%) and neutropenia (36.4%). All patients (100%) 
experienced an AE and most of the AEs were considered treatment-related (98.6%). 
Grade ≥3 AEs were reported by 99% of patients. The most frequently reported grade ≥3 AEs were 
thrombocytopenia (65%), anaemia (43.9%), hyponatraemia (23.4%), neutropenia (22.9%), fatigue 
(20.1%), leukopenia (14.5%) and lymphopenia (10.7%) reported in more than 10% of patients. 
Thrombocytopenia was also the most common grade 4 AE, reported in 38.3% of patients. 
SAEs were reported by 60.7% of patients. Sepsis and pneumonia were the most common SAEs (13 
[6.1%] and 16 [7.5%], respectively). Nearly half of SAEs (27.6%) were considered by the investigator as 
treatment-related, being thrombocytopenia (3.3%), fatigue (2.8%), pneumonia, dehydration and 
hyponatraemia (2.3% each) the most frequent treatment-related SAEs (SmPC, section 4.8).  
With regard to deaths, in study KPT-330-012 a total of 48 patients died within 30 days of last dose of 
selinexor (20 in Part 1 and 28 in Part 2). Disease progression was the cause of death in 27 patients, 
whereas in 20 (9.9%) patients the cause of death was a fatal AE. Sepsis (4 [2.0%]), subdural 
haematoma, cardio-respiratory arrest and pneumonia, (2 [1.0%], each) were the main causes of deaths. 
In the Sd group, 60 (28.0%) patients discontinued study treatment due to AEs. Fatigue (11 [5.1%]), 
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 131/138 
 
 
 
 
nausea (11 [18.3%]), weight decreased and decreased appetite (7 [11.7%], each) and asthenia and 
thrombocytopenia (6 [10%], each) were the main adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation. 
Additionally, 73.8% of patients required dose modifications (i.e. dose reductions and/or dose 
interruptions). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The absence of a control arm is one of the main limitations of this safety dataset, especially in this setting 
of a heavily pre-treated population, as it makes difficult to establish to what extent adverse events 
reported in patients treated with selinexor could be related to the study treatment or on the contrary they 
were associated with the underlying disease and previous treatment received. 
Furthermore, median treatment duration in the Sd group was of only 8.5 weeks (range: 1, 76), with a 
median of doses received of 11 (range: 1,135). Therefore, rare adverse events could be underestimated or 
even not estimated.  
Adverse events such as fatigue, asthenia, nausea, decreased appetite and weight decreased were 
frequently reported in selinexor clinical trials and are among the leading causes for treatment 
discontinuation. Moreover, this is in line with non-clinical data, where reduced food intake and weight loss 
were the main side effects observed. The exact mechanism associated to these AEs is not known. 
Moreover, nervous system disorders such as confusional status and dizziness were AEs of special interest 
reported in patients treated with selinexor. Additionally, 3 cases of acute cerebellar syndrome have been 
reported in selinexor clinical trials (one in a patient with pancreatic cancer and the other two in paediatric 
patients with AML). Despite the applicant states the 3 cases were reported in patients receiving higher 
doses of selinexor, additional monitoring of this adverse event is deemed necessary. 
Submission of results from the confirmatory KCP-330-023/BOSTON study:  A Phase 3 Randomized, 
Controlled, Open-label Study of Selinexor, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone (SVd) versus Bortezomib and 
Dexamethasone (Vd) in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM) will provide 
additional data to evaluate the clinical significance of these events (see Annex II and RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
ORR decreases with each subsequent therapy in relapsed/refractory patients and complete responses are 
rarely achieved. With this in mind and even if some of the observed responses to treatment were 
challenged during previous assessment rounds within this procedure, the reported ORR of 25.3% (95% CI: 
16.3, 36) in the penta-refractory group of patients (n=83) from the STORM study can be considered as 
clinically relevant in the intended treatment setting and expected to translate into clinically meaningful 
benefit in the proposed target population. The duration of the responses normally decreases after each line 
of therapy, as the disease becomes increasingly refractory. In the targeted patient population of penta-
refractory patients, the reported median DOR was 3.8 months (95% CI: 2.3, 10.8) which can also be 
considered of certain relevance in the targeted highly pre-treated patient population. 
The observed toxicity in the STORM study was clinically significant, including frequent severe 
haematological toxicity, especially thrombocytopenia and anaemia, and frequent severe nausea and 
vomiting, and fatigue. Further, a high number of patients required dose reductions and/or dose 
interruptions and more importantly, treatment discontinuation. However, even if the toxicity of selinexor is 
not negligible, it can be considered generally manageable with adequate monitoring and dose adjustment 
or discontinuation. The fact that the safety profile in the penta-refractory population was consistent with 
the safety for the whole population in Part 2 (n=123) concerning all AEs, SAEs and discontinuations due to 
AEs, with no new safety signals having been observed, is reassuring, since these patients are the most 
heavily pre-treated patients in the whole population included in the STORM study.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The reported ORR of 25.3% (95% CI: 16.3, 36) in the penta-refractory group of patients (n=83) from the 
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 134/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
STORM study can be considered as relevant in the intended treatment setting and expected to translate 
into clinically meaningful benefit in the proposed target population. The reported median DOR of 3.8 
months (95% CI: 2.3, 10.8) can also be considered of certain relevance in the targeted highly pre-treated 
patient population.  
Although the toxicity of selinexor is not negligible it is in line with what is expected in a setting where 
patients are heavily pre-treated and can be considered generally manageable with adequate monitoring 
and dose adjustment or discontinuation. Optimal risk minimisation measures in terms of dose 
modifications and supportive care are of course expected to be implemented, as well as monitoring of 
toxicity in the real-life setting.   
Bearing all the above in mind, it is considered that available efficacy and safety data from the STORM 
study (n=83) support a favourable benefit/risk balance for the use of selinexor in combination with 
dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma whose disease is refractory to at least 
two proteasome inhibitors, two immunomodulatory agents and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. 
Limitations of the reported results coming from a single arm trial need to be addressed in the context of a 
conditional marketing authorisation and comprehensive data to address these remaining uncertainties will 
need to be provided by means of the specific obligation proposed. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was 
requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning conditional 
marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease and is designated as an 
orphan medicinal product.  
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed above. 
 It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. The Applicant designed a 
confirmatory, Phase 3 (BOSTON), randomised, active comparator-controlled, open-label, 
multicentre (sites worldwide) study to compare the efficacy and assess the safety of selinexor plus 
bortezomib plus low-dose dexamethasone (SVd) versus bortezomib plus low dose dexamethasone 
(Vd) in ~364 adult patients with RRMM who have received 1 to 3 prior anti-MM regimens. After PD 
is confirmed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC), patients in the Vd arm may cross over to 
SVd treatment. Progression-free survival is the primary endpoint. This study has been designed as 
a confirmatory study to demonstrate and confirm the clinical benefit observed in STORM. It is 
therefore expected that the results of the BOSTON study (cut-off date February 2021) will suffice 
to address the remaining uncertainties and allow the switch from CMA to full approval for Sd in the 
applied indication. 
• 
   Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as RRMM is a condition where there are a number of 
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 135/138 
 
 
 
 
authorised treatment options but no curative treatments. Recently approved products for RRMM 
include lenalidomide, pomalidomide, bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib, panobinostat, 
daratumumab, isatuximab, elotuzumab and belantamab mafodotin. 
For patients who have received at least four prior therapies and whose disease is refractory to at 
least two proteasome inhibitors, two immunomodulatory agents and an anti-CD38 monoclonal 
antibody, and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy, the treatment 
options become very limited.  
Additional treatment options are needed in RRMM aiming to achieve control and remission of the 
disease for as long as possible given that almost all patients eventually relapse and become 
resistant to available treatments, where the remission duration generally decreases with each 
subsequent treatment regimen, and where the toxicity of different regimens is significant and quite 
different between products. In this context, medicinal products with a positive benefit-risk balance 
and new mechanism of action can provide a major therapeutic advantage to patients if they offer 
possible alternative or additional treatment options based on a different safety profile, or based on 
therapeutic efficacy when other products are not expected to be effective.   
On the basis of the data available for penta-refractory patients in the STORM study (n=83), ORR of 
25.3% and median DOR of 3.8 months it can be concluded that selinexor in combination with 
dexamethasone has a positive benefit/risk balance in the revised, more restricted, penta-refractory 
MM patient population that addresses an unmet medical need in such heavily pre-treated patients. 
In the claimed indication, given the high unmet need, the observed ORR is expected to be 
associated with a clinical benefit in patients who respond and although low, the activity is 
considered sufficient to be of benefit. The benefits to public health of the immediate availability 
outweighs the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
• 
  The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required.  In view of the limited treatments options for the highly pre-
treated patients whose disease is refractory to three classes of agents and the new mechanism of 
action, the immediate availability of Nexpovio on the market outweighs the risk inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Nexpovio is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Nexpovio is not similar to Imnovid, Farydak, Ninlaro, 
Darzalex, Kyprolis and Blenrep within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 
847/200. See appendix 1. 
EMA/CHMP/95252/2021 
Page 136/138 
 
 
 
 
 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Nexpovio is favourable in the following indication: 
NEXPOVIO is indicated in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult 
patients who have received at least four prior therapies and whose disease is refractory to at least two 
proteasome inhibitors, two immunomodulatory agents and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and who 
have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions:

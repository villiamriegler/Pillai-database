1.  Introduction 
On 19/03/2018, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Orkambi (Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor), 
in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH has submitted a study titled ‘A Phase 2, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, 
Crossover Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor Combination Therapy in Subjects with 
Cystic Fibrosis Who Have an A455E-CFTR Mutation. 
This Study No: VX15-809-111 (Study 111) is submitted as a stand-alone, post-authorization measure 
(PAM) under Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 (the ‘Paediatric Regulation’). 
The A455E mutation results in a severe reduction of mature CFTR protein at the cell surface. Results of 
in vitro studies suggest that A455E-CFTR could be rescued by the same strategies as F508del-CFTR (in 
vitro strategies include cell co-transfection or incubation with chemical correctors). In turn, these 
findings suggested that A455E might be a suitable candidate for LUM/IVA treatment 
2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a clinical study report for: 
‘A Phase 2, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Crossover Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of 
Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor Combination Therapy in Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis Who Have an A455E-CFTR 
Mutation.

To evaluate the efficacy of LUM/IVA in subjects with CF 12 years of age and older who have at least 
one A455E mutation. 
Other Objectives 
• 
• 
To explore the association between LUM/IVA-induced CFTR function in in vitro organoid-based 
measurements and clinical response to LUM/IVA in subjects with CF 12 years of age and older who 
have at least one A455E mutation. 
To explore the effect of LUM/IVA on glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in subjects with CF 12 
years of age and older who have at least one A455E mutation. 
Rationale for this study: 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by reduced quantity and/or function of the CFTR protein due to mutations 
in the CFTR gene. The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride channel that aids in regulating salt and 
water absorption and secretion and pH balance in multiple organs.1 In people with CF, decreased CFTR 
chloride transport results in multisystem pathology. Although the disease affects multiple organs, 
progressive loss of lung function is the leading cause of mortality. 
Lumacaftor (LUM) is a CFTR corrector that increases the quantity of CFTR delivered to the cell surface, 
and ivacaftor (IVA) is a CFTR potentiator that increases the channel gating activity of CFTR at the cell 
surface. The A455E-CFTR mutation is reported to occur in less than 0.1% of patients with CF 
worldwide, but large regional differences in prevalence exist. In the Netherlands, it is the second most 
prevalent mutation, occurring in 3.6% of all patients with CF, with even higher prevalence in some 
areas.5 Although the A455E mutation was initially reported to be associated with mild lung disease6, 
current clinical experience shows marked differences in clinical disease severity, ranging from relatively 
mild to severe loss of lung function at young adulthood. 
The A455E mutation results in a severe reduction of mature CFTR protein at the cell surface. 
Results of in vitro studies suggest that A455E-CFTR could be rescued by the same strategies as 
F508del-CFTR (in vitro strategies include cell co-transfection or incubation with chemical correctors). In 
turn, these findings suggested that A455E might be a suitable candidate for LUM/IVA treatment. 
A novel functional CFTR assay has been established using patient-derived intestinal stem cell cultures 
termed organoids. Organoids have crypt-like structures and an internal lumen lined by differentiated 
cells, recapitulating the in vivo tissue architecture, with intestinal CFTR expressed at the apical 
membrane. CFTR activation by forskolin (which increases cyclic AMP levels) drives CFTR-dependent 
chloride secretion, inducing rapid, measurable swelling of organoids. 
In this in vitro model, organoids derived from patients homozygous for F508del displayed less 
forskolin-induced swelling than organoids derived from healthy controls.8 Incubation of the 
F508del/F508del organoids with LUM/IVA enhanced forskolin-induced swelling, and a similar LUM/IVA- 
induced improvement was observed in A455E/F508del organoids. Based on the in vitro findings, it is 
hypothesized that LUM/IVA treatment can increase CFTR function and improve disease parameters in 
patients with CF who have an A455E mutation.

Methods  
Objective(s) 
Primary Objective 
To evaluate the efficacy of lumacaftor (LUM)/ivacaftor (IVA) in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) 12 
years of age and older who have at least one A455E mutation. 
Other Objectives 
• 
• 
To explore the association between LUM/IVA-induced CFTR function in in vitro organoid-based 
measurements and clinical response to LUM/IVA in subjects with CF 12 years of age and older 
who have at least one A455E mutation. 
To explore the effect of LUM/IVA on glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in subjects with CF 
12 years of age and older who have at least one A455E mutation 
Study design 
A crossover design with a 1:1 randomization to the 2 treatment sequences enabled within-subject 
comparisons of the effects of placebo and LUM/IVA. The use of placebo was necessary in order to 
provide a robust assessment in this small number of subjects. 
Study Drug Dose and Duration 
Dose of LUM and IVA 
The L400/I250 every 12 hours (q12h) dose regimen was approved in the US, EU, Canada, 
Australia, Switzerland, and Israel for the treatment of CF in patients 12 years of age and older who are 
homozygous for F508del. 
Duration of Dosing 
The 8-week dosing duration in each treatment period was chosen based on results of the pivotal, 
placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies (Studies 103 and 104), in which the effect of LUM/IVA therapy was 
assessed in CF subjects homozygous for F508del. These studies showed an improvement in percent 
predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) after 8 weeks of treatment. 
Washout Period 
An 8-week period was selected as the duration for the Washout Period. It was expected that some 
subjects would be on 28-day-on/28-day-off cycles of stable CF medication. An 8-week washout period 
is compatible with these cycles. 
Inclusion: Male and female subjects 12 years of age and older with confirmed CF, with an A455E 
mutation on at least 1 CFTR allele, and with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≥30% of 
predicted and ≤90% of predicted at screening. 
Approximately 20 subjects were planned to be randomized 1:1 to the 2 treatment sequences: LUM/IVA 
followed by placebo (Sequence 1) or placebo followed by LUM/IVA (Sequence 2).

An interactive web or voice response system was used to assign subjects to treatment sequences in a 
1:1 ratio to receive either LUM/IVA during Treatment Period 1 and placebo during Treatment Period 2 
(Sequence 1) or placebo during Treatment Period 1 and LUM/IVA during Treatment Period 2 (Sequence 
2). 
A schematic of the study design is provided in Figure 2-1.

Treatments 
Treatments administered to participants randomised to sequences as indicated in table 9.1 
Blinding: This study was double-blind. 
Duration of treatment: 8 weeks (seq 1) + 8 weeks (washout) + 8 weeks (seq 2) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy Assessments 
Primary efficacy assessment: Spirometry (excluding assessments on Day 2 and the day after the Week 
16 Visit [if applicable]); 
Others: 
Sweat chloride; Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R); weight and body mass index (BMI); 
height- and weight-for-age and BMI-for-age z-scores (for subjects less than 21 years of age); and 
documentation of events related to outcome (e.g., pulmonary exacerbations). 
Safety Assessments 
Adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory assessments (liver function tests [LFTs]), ophthalmologic 
examinations (OEs) (for subjects less than 18 years of age), vital signs, and spirometry (on Day 2 and 
the day after the Week 16 Visit only, for subjects with FEV1 <40% of predicted). 
Exploratory Assessments 
In vitro analysis of LUM/IVA-induced CFTR function using an organoid assay; glucose and insulin levels 
in oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). 
Statistical Methods 
No formal sample size calculation was conducted for this study. The planned sample size was based on 
the number of subjects expected to be available for participation. 
Efficacy analyses were based on the FAS, which was defined as all randomized subjects who had at 
least one A455E mutation and received at least 1 dose of study drug. Safety analyses were based on 
the Safety Set. Data for a period were used if the subject received at least 1 dose of study drug in that 
treatment period. 
The study baseline was defined as the most recent non-missing measurement (scheduled or 
unscheduled) collected prior to the first dose of study drug in the study. The period baseline was 
defined as the most recent non-missing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the 
first dose of study drug in each treatment period.

Statistical inferences for efficacy analyses were based on change from study baseline unless otherwise 
stated. 
Efficacy Analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) from study 
baseline through 8 weeks of treatment. The primary analysis of the primary endpoint was based on a 
mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) that included the absolute change from the study 
baseline in each treatment period as the dependent variable, with sequence, treatment, period, visit 
within period, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects, study baseline ppFEV1 as a covariate, 
and subject nested within sequence as a random effect. Visit was treated as a class variable. An 
unstructured covariance matrix was assumed for the repeated measurements of the same subject 
within each treatment period. The denominator degrees of freedom for the F-test for fixed effects was 
estimated using the Kenward-Roger approximation. 
The estimated mean treatment difference overall (through Week 8) and its corresponding 95% CI and 
2-sided P value were provided. The estimated mean treatment difference at each visit and its 
corresponding 95% CI and P value were also presented. The raw values and changes from baseline 
were summarized by treatment using descriptive statistics at each scheduled visit. 
As a supportive sensitivity analysis, the MMRM analysis was repeated using change from period 
baseline instead of change from study baseline. 
Safety Analyses 
The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) was summarized in contingency tables by 
treatment. For clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, and pulse oximetry (only for subjects with 
ppFEV1 <40 at screening), the raw values and changes from period baseline were summarized by 
treatment. The incidence of subjects with at least 1 assessment meeting threshold criteria during the 
TE Period was summarized for LFTs. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
All 20 randomized subjects completed dosing in Treatment Period 1, and 17 (85.0%) subjects 
completed dosing in Treatment Period 2 and completed the study. No subjects discontinued during the 
TE periods; 3 discontinuations occurred during the Washout Period. 
Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics 
All subjects were White. The majority of subjects were female (60.0%), and the median age was 40.0 
years, with 18 (90.0%) subjects being ≥18 years of age.  Two subjects were between 12-18y of age. 
The mean (SD) ppFEV1 was 58.9 (15.3), with 2 (10.0%) subjects having a ppFEV1 <40. Means and 
distributions for each demographic and other baseline characteristic were generally similar between the 
2 treatment sequence groups. The common medical history conditions and prior and concomitant 
medications used were consistent with those of a CF population.

Efficacy results 
Evaluation of efficacy was the primary objective of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover 
study of LUM/IVA in CF subjects 12 years of age and older with at least one A455E-CFTR mutation. The 
study was exploratory in nature, and no power calculations were made due to the limited number of 
subjects with this rare mutation that is prevalent in the Netherlands. 
 The  prim a ry  e n d po  int ,  a bs o lut e  change in ppFEV1 from study baseline through 8 weeks of 
treatment, was not met; there was no treatment difference between placebo and LUM/IVA. 
• In a prespecified sensitivity analysis of absolute change in ppFEV1 from period baseline, the least 
squares (LS) mean treatment difference between LUM/IVA and placebo through 8 weeks of treatment 
was 2.1 percentage points (P = 0.1169). 
 Ot he r  e ffica cy  e n d po  int s  s u p po  r t e d  o r  w e r e  s u g ge  s t ive  o f  t he  po t e nt ia l  clin ica l be ne fit  o f  LUM/ IVA. 
Through Week 8, the LS mean treatment difference between LUM/IVA and placebo was as follows: 
o Sweat chloride concentration: -7.8 mmol/L (P = 0.0037) 
o CFQ-R respiratory domain: 3.5 (P = 0.4691) 
 Th e  in  v it ro  o rg a n o id -based assay performed as expected; increased LUM/IVA concentration was 
associated with increased organoid swelling. However, no conclusions were drawn from the exploratory 
analysis of organoid based in vitro measurements versus clinical outcomes due to the limited and 
unbalanced sample size of subjects across mutation groups. 
 No  m e a n ing ful t r e a t m e nt  d iffe r e nce s  w e re  o bs e rve d  in  t he  OGTT  e n d po  int s ,  a nd  ba s e d  o n  t he

Safety Results 
 Administration of LUM 400 mg q12h/IVA 250 mg q12h for approximately 8 weeks was safe and well- 
tolerated in subjects with CF. No new safety concerns were identified.

 The incidence of AEs was 72.2% while receiving placebo and 78.9% while receiving LUM/IVA. One 
subject had a severe AE of hypertension while receiving LUM/IVA. All other AEs were mild or moderate 
in severity. 
 By Preferred Term, the most common AEs occurred only while receiving LUM/IVA and were diarrhea 
(42.1%), flatulence (21.1%), nausea (21.1%), and headache (21.1%). 
 The incidence of related AEs was 22.2% while receiving placebo and 36.8% while receiving 
LUM/IVA. The most common related AEs were diarrhea and flatulence, which occurred during LUM/IVA 
treatment only, and sputum increased, which occurred at similar incidences during both placebo 
(11.1%) and LUM/IVA (10.5%) treatment. 
 No subjects had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation or interruption. 
 No deaths or serious AEs occurred. 
 No important trends were identified from chemistry, hematology, vital signs, physical examinations, 
or OEs. No subjects had alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase elevations >3 × upper limit 
of normal or any bilirubin elevations. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Study VX15-809-111 was a randomised crossover study.  Evaluation of efficacy was the primary 
objective of this study. The study was exploratory in nature, and no power calculations were made due 
to the limited number of subjects with this rare mutation that is prevalent in the Netherlands. 
The primary endpoint, absolute change in ppFEV1 from study baseline through 8 weeks of treatment, 
was not met and showed no treatment difference between placebo and LUM/IVA. 
This outcome is consistent with the small sample size of the study combined with the known variability 
of ppFEV1 measurements. 
Lung function, as measured by spirometry (ppFEV1), is a well-established endpoint in studies of 
therapies for CF. In a prespecified sensitivity analysis of absolute change in ppFEV1 from period 
baseline, the LS mean treatment difference between LUM/IVA and placebo through 8 weeks of 
treatment was 2.1 percentage points (P = 0.1169). 
Sweat chloride is a direct in vivo measure of CFTR function. Subjects had a statistically significant 
improvement (i.e., a reduction) in sweat chloride concentration while receiving LUM/IVA but not while 
receiving placebo. Through Week 8, the LS mean treatment difference between LUM/IVA and placebo 
in sweat chloride concentration was -7.8 mmol/L (P = 0.0037). 
Intestinal-like organoid swelling is a measure of CFTR function in vitro, and in this study, it was 
compared with clinical outcomes (ppFEV1 and sweat chloride) as an exploratory analysis. The in vitro 
organoid-based assay performed as expected; increased LUM/IVA concentration was associated with 
increased organoid swelling. However, no conclusions were drawn from the exploratory analysis of 
organoid-based in vitro measurements versus clinical outcomes due to the limited and unbalanced 
sample size of subjects across mutation groups. 
A time course of glucose and insulin levels was evaluated as an exploratory endpoint. No meaningful 
treatment differences were observed in the OGTT endpoints. Based on the baseline data, there did not 
appear to be impaired glucose tolerance among study subjects.

Safety: Administration of L400/I250q12h for approximately 8 weeks was safe and well-tolerated in 
subjects with CF. No new safety concerns were identified. 
The incidence of AEs was 72.2% while receiving placebo and 78.9% while receiving LUM/IVA. 
One subject had a severe AE of hypertension while receiving LUM/IVA. All other AEs were mild or 
moderate in severity. 
By PT, the most common AEs occurred only while receiving LUM/IVA and were diarrhea 
(42.1%), flatulence (21.1%), nausea (21.1%), and headache (21.1%). 
The incidence of related AEs was 22.2% while receiving placebo and 36.8% while receiving LUM/IVA. 
The most common related AEs were diarrhea and flatulence, which occurred during LUM/IVA treatment 
only, and sputum increased, which occurred at similar incidences during both placebo (11.1%) and 
LUM/IVA (10.5%) treatment. 
No subjects had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation or interruption. 
No deaths or SAEs occurred. 
No important trends were identified from chemistry, hematology, vital signs, PEs, or OEs. No subjects 
had ALT or AST elevations >3 × ULN or any bilirubin elevations. 
Overall, the safety results were consistent with the known safety profile of LUM/IVA. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
This Phase 2, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Crossover Study to Evaluate the Efficacy 
of Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor Combination Therapy in Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis Who Have an A455E-

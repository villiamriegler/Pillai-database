CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Leqvio is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and 
non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet: 
• 
in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to 
reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin, or 
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
• 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 284 mg inclisiran administered as a single subcutaneous injection: initially, 
again at 3 months, followed by every 6 months. 
Missed doses 
If a planned dose is missed by less than 3 months, inclisiran should be administered and dosing 
continued according to the patient’s original schedule. 
If a planned dose is missed by more than 3 months, a new dosing schedule should be started – 
inclisiran should be administered initially, again at 3 months, followed by every 6 months.

Treatment transition from monoclonal antibody PCSK9 inhibitors 
Inclisiran can be administered immediately after the last dose of a monoclonal antibody PCSK9 
inhibitor. To maintain LDL-C lowering it is recommended that inclisiran is administered within 
2 weeks after the last dose of a monoclonal antibody PCSK9 inhibitor. 
Special populations 
Elderly (age ≥65 years) 
No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustments are necessary for patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A) or moderate 
(Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment. No data are available in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh class C) (see section 5.2). Inclisiran should be used with caution in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustments are necessary for patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment or 
patients with end-stage renal disease (see section 5.2). There is limited experience with inclisiran in 
patients with severe renal impairment. Inclisiran should be used with caution in these patients. See 
section 4.4 for precautions to take in case of haemodialysis. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of inclisiran in children aged less than 18 years have not yet been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Subcutaneous use. 
Inclisiran is for subcutaneous injection into the abdomen; alternative injection sites include the upper 
arm or thigh. Injections should not be given into areas of active skin disease or injury such as 
sunburns, skin rashes, inflammation or skin infections. 
Each 284 mg dose is administered using a single pre-filled syringe. Each pre-filled syringe is for 
single use only. 
Inclisiran is intended for administration by a healthcare professional. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Haemodialysis 
The effect of haemodialysis on inclisiran pharmacokinetics has not been studied. Considering that 
inclisiran is eliminated renally, haemodialysis should not be performed for at least 72 hours after 
inclisiran dosing. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Inclisiran is not a substrate for common drug transporters and, although in vitro studies were not 
conducted, it is not anticipated to be a substrate for cytochrome P450. Inclisiran is not an inhibitor or 
inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes or common drug transporters. Therefore, inclisiran is not 
expected to have clinically significant interactions with other medicinal products. Based on the limited 
data available, clinically meaningful interactions with atorvastatin, rosuvastatin or other statins are not 
expected. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of inclisiran in pregnant women. Animal studies 
do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of inclisiran during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether inclisiran is excreted in human milk. Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological 
data in animals have shown excretion of inclisiran in milk (see section 5.3). A risk to newborns/infants 
cannot be excluded. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
inclisiran therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
No data on the effect of inclisiran on human fertility are available. Animal studies did not show any 
effects on fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Leqvio has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The only adverse reactions associated with inclisiran were adverse reactions at the injection site

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions at the injection site 
Adverse reactions at the injection site occurred in 8.2% and 1.8% of inclisiran and placebo patients, 
respectively, in the pivotal studies. The proportion of patients in each group who discontinued 
treatment due to adverse reactions at the injection site was 0.2% and 0.0%, respectively. All of these 
adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity, transient and resolved without sequelae. The most 
frequently occurring adverse reactions at the injection site in patients treated with inclisiran were 
injection site reaction (3.1%), injection site pain (2.2%), injection site erythema (1.6%), and injection 
site rash (0.7%). 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Of the 1,833 patients treated with inclisiran in the pivotal studies, 981 (54%) were 65 years of age or 
older, while 239 (13%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety were observed 
between these patients and younger patients. 
Immunogenicity 
In the pivotal studies 1,830 patients were tested for anti-drug antibodies. Confirmed positivity was 
detected in 1.8% (33/1,830) of patients prior to dosing and in 4.9% (90/1,830) of patients during the 
18 months of treatment with inclisiran. No clinically significant differences in the clinical efficacy, 
safety or pharmacodynamic profiles of inclisiran were observed in the patients who tested positive for 
anti-inclisiran antibodies. 
Laboratory values 
In the phase III clinical studies, there were more frequent elevations of serum hepatic transaminases 
between >1x the upper limit of normal (ULN) and ≤3x ULN in patients on inclisiran (ALT: 19.7% and 
AST: 17.2%) than in patients on placebo (ALT: 13.6% and AST: 11.1%). These elevations did not 
progress to exceed the clinically relevant threshold of 3x ULN, were asymptomatic and were not 
associated with adverse reactions or other evidence of liver dysfunction. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No clinically relevant adverse reactions were observed in healthy volunteers who received inclisiran at 
doses up to three times the therapeutic dose. No specific treatment for inclisiran overdose is available. 
In the event of an overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically, and supportive measures 
instituted as required.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: lipid modifying agents, other lipid modifying agents, ATC code: 
C10AX16 
Mechanism of action 
Inclisiran is a cholesterol-lowering, double-stranded, small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA), 
conjugated on the sense strand with triantennary N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to facilitate uptake 
by hepatocytes. In hepatocytes, inclisiran utilises the RNA interference mechanism and directs 
catalytic breakdown of mRNA for proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9. This increases LDL-C 
receptor recycling and expression on the hepatocyte cell surface, which increases LDL-C uptake and 
lowers LDL-C levels in the circulation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Following a single subcutaneous administration of 284 mg inclisiran, LDL-C reduction was apparent 
within 14 days post-dose. Mean reductions of 49-51% for LDL-C were observed 30 to 60 days 
post-dose. At day 180, LDL-C levels were still reduced by approximately 53%. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
In clinical studies and some publications, the 284 mg inclisiran dose is equivalent and referred to as 
300 mg inclisiran sodium salt. 
The efficacy of inclisiran was evaluated in three phase III studies in patients with atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) (coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease or peripheral artery 
disease), ASCVD risk equivalents (type 2 diabetes mellitus, familial hypercholesterolaemia, or 
10-year risk of 20% or greater of having a cardiovascular event assessed by Framingham Risk Score 
or equivalent) and/or familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). Patients were taking a maximally tolerated 
dose of statin with or without other lipid-modifying therapy and required additional LDL-C reduction 
(patients unable to reach their treatment goals). Approximately 17% of patients were statin intolerant. 
Patients were administered subcutaneous injections of 284 mg inclisiran or placebo on day 1, day 90, 
day 270 and day 450. Patients were followed until day 540. 
The effect of inclisiran on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not yet been determined. 
In the phase III pooled analysis, subcutaneously administered inclisiran lowered LDL-C between 50% 
and 55% as early as day 90 (Figure 1), which was maintained during long-term therapy. Maximal 
LDL-C reduction was achieved at day 150 following a second administration. Small but statistically 
significant increased LDL-C reductions up to 65% were associated with lower baseline LDL-C levels 
(approximately <2 mmol/l [77 mg/dl]), higher baseline PCSK9 levels and higher statin doses and 
statin intensity.

ASCVD and ASCVD risk equivalents 
Two studies were conducted in patients with ASCVD and ASCVD risk equivalents (ORION-10 and 
ORION-11). Patients were taking a maximally tolerated dose of statins with or without other 
lipid-modifying therapy, such as ezetimibe, and required additional LDL-C reduction. As lowering 
LDL-C is expected to improve cardiovascular outcomes, the co-primary endpoints in each study were 
the percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to day 510 relative to placebo and the time-adjusted 
percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after day 90 and up to day 540 to estimate the integrated 
effect on LDL-C over time. 
ORION-10 was a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled 18-month study 
conducted in 1,561 patients with ASCVD. 
The mean age at baseline was 66 years (range: 35 to 90 years), 60% were ≥65 years old, 31% were 
women, 86% were White, 13% were Black, 1% were Asian and 14% were Hispanic or Latino 
ethnicity. The mean baseline LDL C was 2.7 mmol/l (105 mg/dl). Sixty-nine percent (69%) were 
taking high-intensity statins, 19% were taking medium-intensity statins, 1% were taking low-intensity 
statins and 11% were not on a statin. The most commonly administered statins were atorvastatin and 
rosuvastatin. 
Inclisiran significantly reduced the mean percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to day 510 
compared to placebo by 52% (95% CI: -56%, -49%; p <0.0001) (Table 2). 
Inclisiran also significantly reduced the time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after 
day 90 and up to day 540 by 54% compared to placebo (95% CI: -56%, -51%; p <0.0001). For 
additional results, see Table 2.

At day 510, the LDL-C target of <1.8 mmol/l (70 mg/dl) was achieved by 84% of inclisiran patients 
with ASCVD compared to 18% of placebo patients. 
Consistent and statistically significant (p<0.0001) reductions in percentage change in LDL-C from 
baseline to day 510 and time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after day 90 and up 
to day 540 were observed across all subgroups irrespective of baseline demographics, baseline disease 
characteristics (including gender, age, body mass index, race and baseline statin use), comorbidities 
and geographic regions. 
ORION-11 was an international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled 18-month 
study which evaluated 1,617 patients with ASCVD or ASCVD risk equivalents. More than 75% of 
patients were receiving a high-intensity statin background treatment, 87% of patients had ASCVD and 
13% were ASCVD risk equivalent. 
The mean age at baseline was 65 years (range: 20 to 88 years), 55% were ≥65 years old, 28% were 
women, 98% were White, 1% were Black ,1% were Asian and 1% were Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. 
The mean baseline LDL-C was 2.7 mmol/l (105 mg/dl). Seventy-eight percent (78%) were taking 
high-intensity statins, 16% were taking medium-intensity statins, 0.4% were taking low-intensity 
statins and 5% were not on a statin. The most commonly administered statins were atorvastatin and 
rosuvastatin. 
Inclisiran significantly reduced the mean percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to day 510 
compared to placebo by 50% (95% CI: -53%, -47%; p<0.0001) (Table 3). 
Inclisiran also significantly reduced time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after 
day 90 and up to day 540 by 49% compared to placebo (95% CI: -52%, -47%; p<0.0001). For 
additional results, see Table 3.

At day 510, the LDL-C target of <1.8 mmol/l (70 mg/dl) was achieved by 82% of inclisiran patients 
with ASCVD compared to 16% of placebo patients. In patients with an ASCVD risk equivalent, the 
LDL-C target of <2.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl) was achieved by 78% of inclisiran patients compared to 
31% of placebo patients. 
Consistent and statistically significant (p<0.05) percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to day 510 
and time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after day 90 and up to day 540 was 
observed across all subgroups irrespective of baseline demographics, baseline disease characteristics 
(including gender, age, body mass index, race and baseline statin use), comorbidities, and geographic 
regions. 
Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia 
ORION-9 was an international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled 18-month 
trial in 482 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH). All patients were 
taking maximally tolerated doses of statins with or without other lipid-modifying therapy, such as 
ezetimibe, and required additional LDL-C reduction. The diagnosis of HeFH was made either by 
genotyping or clinical criteria (“definite FH” using either the Simon Broome or WHO/Dutch Lipid 
Network criteria). 
The co-primary endpoints were the percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to day 510 relative to 
placebo, and the time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after day 90 and up to 
day 540 to estimate the integrated effect on LDL-C over time. Key secondary endpoints were the 
absolute change in LDL-C from baseline to day 510, the time-adjusted absolute change in LDL-C 
from baseline after day 90 and up to day 540 and the percentage change from baseline to day 510 in 
PCSK9, total cholesterol, Apo-B, and non-HDL-C. Additional secondary endpoints included the, 
individual responsiveness to inclisiran and the proportion of patients attaining global lipid targets for 
their level of ASCVD risk. 
The mean age at baseline was 55 years (range: 21 to 80 years), 22% were ≥65 years old, 53% were 
women, 94% were White, 3% were Black, 3% were Asian and 3% were Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. 
The mean baseline LDL-C was 4.0 mmol/l (153 mg/dl). Seventy-four percent (74%) were taking 
high-intensity statins, 15% were taking medium-intensity statins and 10% were not on a statin. 
Fifty-two percent (52%) of patients were treated with ezetimibe. The most commonly administered 
statins were atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. 
Inclisiran significantly reduced the mean percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to day 510 
compared to placebo by 48% (95% CI: -54%, -42%; p<0.0001) (Table 4).

At day 510, 52.5% of inclisiran patients with ASCVD achieved their LDL-C target of <1.8 mmol/l 
(70 mg/dl) compared to 1.4% of placebo patients with ASCVD, while in the group with ASCVD risk 
equivalents 66.9% of inclisiran patients achieved their LDL-C target of <2.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl) 
compared to 8.9% of placebo patients. 
Consistent and statistically significant (p<0.05) percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to day 510 
and time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after day 90 and up to day 540 were 
observed across all subgroups irrespective of baseline demographics, baseline disease characteristics 
(including gender, age, body mass index, race and baseline statin use), comorbidities, and geographic 
regions. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
inclisiran in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of elevated cholesterol 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following single subcutaneous administration, systemic exposure to inclisiran increased 
approximately dose-proportionally over a range from 24 mg to 756 mg. At the recommended dosing 
regimen of 284 mg plasma concentrations reached peak in approximately 4 hours post dose, with a 
mean Cmax of 509 ng/ml. Concentrations reached undetectable levels within 48 hours post dosing. The 
mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve from dosing extrapolated to infinity was 
7980 ng*h/ml. Pharmacokinetic findings following multiple subcutaneous administrations of inclisiran 
were similar to single-dose administration. 
Distribution 
Inclisiran is 87% protein bound in vitro at the relevant clinical plasma concentrations. Following a 
single subcutaneous 284 mg dose of inclisiran to healthy adults, the apparent volume of distribution is 
approximately 500 litres. Based on non-clinical data inclisiran has been shown to have high uptake 
into and selectivity for the liver, the target organ for cholesterol lowering. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
Inclisiran is primarily metabolised by nucleases to shorter inactive nucleotides of varying length. 
Inclisiran is not a substrate for common drug transporters and, although in vitro studies were not 
conducted, it is not anticipated to be a substrate for cytochrome P450. 
Elimination 
The terminal elimination half-life of inclisiran is approximately 9 hours and no accumulation occurs 
with multiple dosing. Sixteen percent (16%) of inclisiran is cleared through the kidney. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
In the phase I clinical study, an approximately dose proportional increase in inclisiran exposure was 
observed after administration of subcutaneous doses of inclisiran ranging from 24 mg to 756 mg. No 
accumulation and no time-dependent changes were observed after multiple subcutaneous doses of 
inclisiran. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) 
In the phase I clinical study, a dissociation was observed between inclisiran pharmacokinetic 
parameters and LDL-C pharmacodynamic effects. Selective delivery of inclisiran to hepatocytes, 
where it is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), results in a long duration of 
action, beyond that anticipated based on the plasma elimination half-life of 9 hours. The maximal 
effects of reducing LDL-C were observed with a 284 mg dose, with higher doses not producing 
greater effects. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Pharmacokinetic analysis of data from a dedicated renal impairment study reported an increase in 
inclisiran Cmax of approximately 2.3, 2.0 and 3.3-fold and an increase in inclisiran AUC of 
approximately 1.6, 1.8 and 2.3-fold, in patients with mild (creatinine clearance [CrCL] of 60 ml/min to 
89 ml/min), moderate (CrCL of 30 ml/min to 59 ml/min) and severe (CrCL of 15 ml/min to 
29 ml/min) renal impairment, respectively, relative to patients with normal renal function. Despite the 
higher transient plasma exposures over 48 hours, the reduction in LDL-C was similar across all groups 
of renal function. Based on population pharmacodynamic modelling, no dose adjustment is 
recommended in patients with end-stage renal disease. Based on pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic 
and safety assessments, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild, moderate or severe 
renal impairment. The effect of haemodialysis on inclisiran pharmacokinetics has not been studied. 
Considering that inclisiran is eliminated renally, haemodialysis should not be performed for at least 
72 hours after Leqvio dosing. 
Hepatic impairment 
Pharmacokinetic analysis of data from a dedicated hepatic impairment study reported an increase in 
inclisiran Cmax of approximately 1.1 and 2.1-fold, and an increase in inclisiran AUC of 
approximately1.3 and 2.0-fold, respectively, in patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A) and moderate 
(Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment relative to patients with normal hepatic function. Despite the 
higher transient inclisiran plasma exposures, the reductions in LDL-C were similar between the groups 
of patients administered inclisiran with normal hepatic function and mild hepatic impairment. In 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment baseline PCSK9 levels were markedly lower and the 
reduction in LDL-C was less than that observed in patients with normal hepatic function. No dose 
adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A and 
B). Leqvio has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other special populations 
A population pharmacodynamic analysis was conducted on data from 4,328 patients. Age, body 
weight, gender, race, and creatinine clearance were not found to significantly influence inclisiran 
pharmacodynamics. No dose adjustments are recommended for patients with these demographics. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In repeated dose toxicology studies conducted in rats and monkeys the no observed adverse effect 
levels (NOAEL) were identified as the highest doses administered subcutaneously which produced 
exposures considerably in excess of the maximum human exposure. Microscopic observations from 
toxicology studies included vacuolation in hepatocytes of rats and lymph node macrophages of 
monkeys, and the presence of basophilic granules in hepatocytes of monkeys and kidneys of rats and 
monkeys. These observations were not associated with changes in clinical laboratory parameters and 
are not considered adverse. 
Inclisiran was not carcinogenic in Sprague-Dawley rats or in TgRasH2 mice administered inclisiran at 
doses sufficiently in excess of clinical doses. 
No mutagenic or clastogenic potential of inclisiran was found in a battery of tests, including  a 
bacterial mutagenicity assay, in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood 
lymphocytes and an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay. 
Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of harm to the foetus 
due to inclisiran at the highest doses administered, which produced exposure considerably in excess of 
the maximum human exposure. 
Inclisiran did not affect the fertility or reproductive performance of male rats and female rats exposed 
to inclisiran prior to gestation and during gestation. The doses were associated with systemic 
exposures many times greater than the human exposure at clinical doses. 
Inclisiran has been observed in the milk of lactating rats; however, there is no evidence of systemic 
absorption in suckling rat neonates.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Leqvio is and what it is used for 
What Leqvio is and how it works 
Leqvio contains the active substance inclisiran. Inclisiran lowers levels of LDL-cholesterol (“bad” 
cholesterol), which can cause heart and blood circulation problems when levels are raised. 
Inclisiran works by interfering with RNA (genetic material in body cells) to limit the production of a 
protein called PCSK9. This protein can increase LDL-cholesterol levels and preventing its production 
helps to lower your LDL-cholesterol levels. 
What Leqvio is used for 
Leqvio is used in addition to your cholesterol-lowering diet if you are an adult with a high cholesterol 
level in your blood (primary hypercholesterolaemia, including heterozygous familial and non-familial, 
or mixed dyslipidaemia). 
Leqvio is given: 
- 
together with a statin (a type of medicine that treats high cholesterol), sometimes combined with 
another cholesterol-lowering treatment if the maximum dose of the statin does not work well 
enough, or 
alone or together with other cholesterol-lowering medicines when statins do not work well or 
cannot be used. 
- 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Leqvio 
You must not be given Leqvio 
- 
if you are allergic to inclisiran or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Leqvio: 
- 
- 
- 
if you are receiving dialysis 
if you have severe liver disease 
if you have severe kidney disease 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age, because there is no 
experience of using the medicine in this age group. 
Other medicines and Leqvio 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before you are given this medicine. 
The use of Leqvio should be avoided during pregnancy. 
It is not yet known whether Leqvio passes into human breast milk. Your doctor will help you to decide 
whether to continue breast-feeding or to start treatment with Leqvio. Your doctor will consider the 
potential benefits of treatment for you, compared with the health benefits and risks of breast-feeding 
for your baby. 
Driving and using machines 
Leqvio is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use machines. 
Leqvio contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
3. 
How Leqvio is given 
The recommended dose of Leqvio is 284 mg given by injection under the skin (subcutaneous 
injection). The next dose is given after 3 months, followed by further doses every 6 months. 
Before starting Leqvio you should be on a diet to lower your cholesterol and it is likely that you will 
be taking a statin. You should stay on this cholesterol-lowering diet and keep taking the statin all the 
time you receive Leqvio. 
Leqvio is for injection under the skin of the abdomen; alternative injection sites include the upper arm 
or thigh. Leqvio will be given to you by a doctor, pharmacist or nurse (healthcare professional). 
If you receive more Leqvio than you should 
This medicine will be given to you by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse (healthcare professional). In 
the highly unlikely event that you are given too much (an overdose) the doctor or other healthcare 
professional will check you for side effects. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you miss your dose of Leqvio 
If you miss your appointment for your Leqvio injection, contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse as 
soon as you can to arrange your next injection. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Leqvio 284 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe 
inclisiran 
Healthcare professionals should refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for full prescribing 
information. 
Indication (see section 4.1 of the SmPC) 
Leqvio is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and 
non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet: 
• 
in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to 
reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin, or 
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
• 
Posology (see section 4.2 of the SmPC) 
The recommended dose is 284 mg inclisiran administered as a single subcutaneous injection: initially, 
again at 3 months, followed by every 6 months. 
Missed doses 
If a planned dose is missed by less than 3 months, inclisiran should be administered and dosing 
continued according to the patient’s original schedule. 
If a planned dose is missed by more than 3 months, a new dosing schedule should be started – 
inclisiran should be administered initially, again at 3 months, followed by every 6 months. 
Treatment transition from monoclonal antibody PCSK9 inhibitors 
Inclisiran can be administered immediately after the last dose of a monoclonal antibody PCSK9 
inhibitor. To maintain LDL-C lowering it is recommended that inclisiran is administered within 
2 weeks after the last dose of a monoclonal antibody PCSK9 inhibitor. 
Special populations 
Elderly (age ≥65 years) 
No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustments are necessary for patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A) or moderate 
(Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment. No data are available in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh class C). Inclisiran should be used with caution in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustments are necessary for patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment or 
patients with end stage renal disease. There is limited experience wth inclisiran in patients with severe 
renal impairment. Inclisiran should be used with caution in these patients. See section 4.4 of the SmPC 
for precautions to take in case of haemodialysis. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of inclisiran in children aged less than 18 years has not yet been established. 
No data are available. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Method of administration (see section 4.2 of the SmPC) 
Subcutaneous use.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Leqvio is and what it is used for 
What Leqvio is and how it works 
Leqvio contains the active substance inclisiran. Inclisiran lowers levels of LDL-cholesterol (“bad” 
cholesterol), which can cause heart and blood circulation problems when levels are raised. 
Inclisiran works by interfering with RNA (genetic material in body cells) to limit the production of a 
protein called PCSK9. This protein can increase LDL-cholesterol levels and preventing its production 
helps to lower your LDL-cholesterol levels. 
What Leqvio is used for 
Leqvio is used in addition to your cholesterol-lowering diet if you are an adult with a high cholesterol 
level in your blood (primary hypercholesterolaemia, including heterozygous familial and non-familial, 
or mixed dyslipidaemia). 
Leqvio is given: 
- 
together with a statin (a type of medicine that treats high cholesterol), sometimes combined with 
another cholesterol-lowering treatment if the maximum dose of the statin does not work well 
enough, or 
alone or together with other cholesterol-lowering medicines when statins do not work well or 
cannot be used.

Before starting Leqvio you should be on a diet to lower your cholesterol and it is likely that you will 
be taking a statin. You should stay on this cholesterol-lowering diet and keep taking the statin all the 
time you receive Leqvio. 
Leqvio is for injection under the skin of the abdomen; alternative injection sites include the upper arm 
or thigh. Leqvio will be given to you by a doctor, pharmacist or nurse (healthcare professional).

non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet: 
• 
in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to 
reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin, or 
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
• 
Posology (see section 4.2 of the SmPC) 
The recommended dose is 284 mg inclisiran administered as a single subcutaneous injection: initially, 
again at 3 months, followed by every 6 months. 
Missed doses

Important information you need to know before injecting Leqvio 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Do not use the pre-filled syringe if any of the seals on the outer carton or the seal of the plastic 
tray are broken. 
Do not remove the needle cap until you are ready to inject. 
Do not use if the pre-filled syringe has been dropped onto a hard surface or dropped after 
removing the needle cap. 
Do not try to re-use or take apart the pre-filled syringe. 
The pre-filled syringe has a needle guard that will be activated to cover the needle after the 
injection is finished. The needle guard will help to prevent needle stick injuries to anyone who 
handles the pre-filled syringe after injection. 
Step 1. Inspect the pre-filled syringe 
You may see air bubbles in the liquid, which is normal. Do not try to remove the air. 
• 
Do not use the pre-filled syringe if it looks damaged or if any of the solution for injection has 
leaked out of the pre-filled syringe. 
Step 2. Remove needle cap 
Firmly pull straight to remove the needle cap from the 
pre-filled syringe. You may see a drop of liquid at the 
end of the needle. This is normal. 
Do not put the needle cap back on. Throw it away. 
Step 3. Insert needle 
Gently pinch the skin at the injection site and hold the 
pinch throughout the injection. With the other hand insert 
the needle into the skin at an angle of approximately 
45 degrees as shown. 
Step 4. Start injection 
Continue to pinch the skin. Slowly press the plunger as 
far as it will go. This will make sure that a full dose is 
injected. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 5. Complete injection 
Confirm that the plunger head is between the needle 
guard wings as shown. This will make sure that the 
needle guard has been activated and will cover the needle 
after the injection is finished. 
Step 6. Release plunger 
Keeping the pre-filled syringe at the injection site, slowly 
release the plunger until the needle is covered by the 
needle guard. Remove the pre-filled syringe from the 
injection site. 
Step 7. Dispose of the pre-filled syringe 
Dispose of the pre-filled syringe in accordance with local requirements.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This  application  is  based  upon  the  single  pivotal  trial  EMPA-KIDNEY  (1245.137),  which  was  designed  to 
support a new indication for the use of Jardiance (empagliflozin) 10 mg for the treatment of CKD: Jardiance 
is indicated in adults for the treatment of chronic kidney disease. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Chronic kidney disease is increasingly recognized as a global public health problem affecting 10-15% of the 
population  worldwide.  Chronic  kidney  disease  results  from  a  variety  of  causes,  such  as  diabetes, 
hypertension,  vascular  disease,  or  glomerulonephritis,  but  diabetes  remains  the  leading  cause  of  this 
condition. Approximately 40% of patients with type 2 diabetes have CKD based on eGFR or albuminuria 
criteria, and over 20% have clinically overt CKD (eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73m2).  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/304328/2023 
Page 6/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chronic  kidney  disease  is  associated  with  excess  risk  for  cardiovascular  disease  (CVD).  Indeed,  CV  risk, 
including  heart  failure  episodes  and  mortality,  increases  as  eGFR  decreases  below  60  mL/min/1.73m2, 
independent of other risk factors, including diabetes. Cardiovascular events are the most frequent cause of 
death  in  patients  with  CKD.  In  addition,  high  levels  of  albuminuria  (Urine  Albumin-to-Creatinine  Ratio; 
UACR ≥30 mg/g), are associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. 
CKD is associated with impaired quality of life and substantially reduced life expectancy at all ages. End-
stage renal failure (ESRD) is the most severe form of CKD and is fatal if not treated by renal replacement 
therapy. Although patients with early CKD are more likely to die before they reach ESRD, the avoidance of 
ESRD is still highly desirable due to its adverse effects on quality of life and the substantial costs of dialysis 
and  transplantation  to  healthcare  providers.  Although  Renin-Angiotensin  System  (RAS)  blockade  with 
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) have been shown 
to reduce albuminuria and slow the rate of progression in proteinuric nephropathies, particularly in diabetic 
kidney disease, a substantial residual risk of ESRD remains. In summary, there is a high unmet medical 
need for new treatment options that can be added safely to current standard treatments in CKD, with a 
primary aim to slow the progression of CKD and reduce the risk of CV death. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Jardiance  (empagliflozin)  is  a  selective  sodium-glucose  co-transporter-2  (SGLT-2)  inhibitor,  and 
empagliflozin  causes  urinary  glucose  excretion  and  reduces  hyperglycaemia,  weight,  plasma  circulating 
volume  and  blood  pressure.  This  has  been  shown  to  translate  safely  into  reduced  clinical  risk  from 
cardiovascular disease (particularly heart failure and cardiovascular death) in people with type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) and established cardiovascular disease. SGLT-2 inhibition with empagliflozin also reduces albuminuria 
and  slows  the  annual  decline  in  estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate  in  people  with  T2D  who  still  have 
preserved kidney function. The kidney effects may result from increased sodium delivery to the kidney’s 
macula  densa,  which  in  turn  causes  glomerular  afferent  arteriolar  vasoconstriction  and  reduced 
intraglomerular pressure. Raised intraglomerular pressure is believed to be central to the “final common 
pathway” of disease progression in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Since SGLT-2 inhibition with empagliflozin 
also  causes  glycosuria  and  acute  haemodynamic  changes  in  kidney  function  in  people  without  diabetes, 
empagliflozin  may  also  be  nephroprotective  in  conditions  without  ambient  hyperglycaemia,  which 
collectively accounts for 50 to 70% of patients with CKD worldwide. Patients with established CKD are at 
substantial risk of progressing to end-stage kidney disease despite the use of medical therapies, including 
renin-angiotensin system inhibition, so identifying new treatments to delay progression is a priority. 
Empagliflozin was developed by Boehringer Ingelheim (BI), and is approved and marketed for the treatment 
of  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  (T2DM),  prevention  of  cardiovascular  (CV)  events  in  adults  with  T2DM  and 
established CV disease, and for the treatment of adults with heart failure independent of left ventricular 
ejection fraction.  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The  MAH 
received  Scientific 
advice 
from 
the  CHMP/SAWP 
on  9  November  2017 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/715563/2017).  The  Scientific  advice  pertained  to  clinical  aspects  of  the  dossier  with 
some important points as mentioned below: 
• 
The Applicant is advised to follow the Guideline on the clinical investigation of medicinal products 
to 
prevent 
the 
development/slow 
progression 
of 
chronic 
renal 
insufficiency: 
EMA/CHMP/500825/2016 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/304328/2023 
Page 7/85 
 
 
 
 
•  A separate indication based on this target population could be acceptable, depending on the final 
study  results,  in  particular,  providing  that  a  beneficial  treatment  effect  is  not  predominately  a 
consequence of improving glycaemic control in the part of the trial population with Diabetes Mellitus. 
• 
Inclusion of patients with (a) eGFR ≥20 <45 mL/min/1.73²; or (b)eGFR ≥45 mL/min/1.73m2 with 
urinary  albumin/creatinine  ratio  ≥200  mg/g  (or  protein/creatinine  ratio≥300  mg/g),  is  generally 
acceptable.  Patients  with  polycystic  nephropathy  and  those  receiving  immunosuppressive 
medication  are  excluded;  thus,  the  trial  is  not  fully  representative  of  the  whole  CKD  population. 
Immunosuppression with a potency greater than prednisolone 10 mg or immunosuppression with 
non-corticosteroids in the last 3 months is expected to be small. Still, this patient population will 
be  excluded  as  it  represents  a  vulnerable  patient  population,  and  patient  safety  is  of  utmost 
importance. The CHMP acknowledged the explanation and confirmed the proposed approach. 
• 
• 
• 
The trial should be designed to demonstrate beneficial effects across the range of aetiologies and 
stages. 
The selected dose of 10 mg empagliflozin is agreed. 
The trial had been specifically designed to ensure that clear evidence of the effects of empagliflozin 
on  renal  disease  progression  would  emerge  before  any  beneficial  effects  on  vascular  mortality 
become highly significant. This would seem critical to trial interpretation to extend the indication 
statement  in  the  manner  proposed.  On  that  basis,  the  proposed  composite  endpoint  of  the  first 
occurrence of either of the components related to renal disease progression (i.e. end-stage renal 
disease  [ESRD]  or  a  sustained  decline  in  eGFR  of  ≥40%),  or  cardiovascular  (CV)  death,  can  be 
accepted.  However,  whilst  a  wish  to  understand  the  effect  on  the  underlying  renal  and  vascular 
disease process is understood, other deaths cannot be ignored when interpreting the magnitude of 
benefit  and  assessing  the  benefit-risk.  A  secondary  analysis,  including  renal  disease  progression 
events and all-cause mortality will be required. In addition, supplementary analyses treating any 
non-renal  death,  including  CV  death,  as  a  competing  risk  should  be  prospectively  planned.  This 
analysis will necessarily invoke strong assumptions that should be clearly stated and explored in 
sensitivity analyses. In any case all-cause mortality should be analysed as a secondary outcome. 
Change in eGFR should be sustained; this is not guaranteed in those patients where a ≥40% decline 
in eGFR is observed only during the last study visit. 
• 
The Applicant proposed the analysis of all-cause hospitalization in Section 5 of the PI and stated 
that  hospitalization  for  heart  failure  would  be  adjudicated,  but  the  analysis  of  all-cause 
hospitalization will be based on investigator reports which will not be adjudicated. This is not the 
preferred approach. Hospitalization reflects the disease burden for the patient and it is important 
to the understanding of any effect of treatment on hospitalization events to understand the cause 
and the extent to which hospitalisations are influenced by non-clinical considerations. Specifically, 
it is important to differentiate if the cause of hospitalization is related to renal disease progression 
and or cardiovascular disease, consistent with the primary objective of the study, from those due 
to other co-morbidities. Therefore, all hospitalization events would ideally be adjudicated and their 
definition and criteria used for evaluation should be standardized and included in the protocol. It 
would be harder to understand the relevance of an effect on hospitalizations based on unadjudicated 
data, and this might preclude their usefulness for the prescriber and hence their inclusion in the 
SmPC. 
• 
In this study, the Applicant will use minimization allocation in order to maintain a 1:1 (empagliflozin 
vs placebo) ratio within strata (instead of the typically used method: blocked randomization) with 
no consideration of re-randomizations methods for analysis. The use of minimisation has possible 
implications on the analysis with regards to bias and Type I error control. Re-randomization tests 
are an appropriate approach for assessing statistical significance when a minimization algorithm is

used (cf EMA Guideline on adjustment for baseline covariates in clinical trials, 26 February 2015 
EMA/CHMP/295050/2013 and Proschan et al, 2011). Re-randomization tests for the primary and 
secondary  efficacy  analysis  should  be  considered  with  the  use  of  classical  tests  as  supportive 
analyses. A particular concern might be raised in the use of a Cox proportional hazards model when 
the trial has so many strata over which the proportional hazards assumption should hold. 
• 
The use Hochberg procedure for testing key secondary endpoints is acceptable. 
•  Monitoring of severe side effects and risk for amputation in particular, is extremely important in all 
patients with CKD. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
No GCP inspection was performed for the EMPA-KIDNEY trial. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial was performed in 
accordance with the ICH GCP, as claimed by the Applicant. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The  effects  of  empagliflozin  on  different  aspects  of the  pathophysiology  of  chronic  kidney diseases  were 
studied in various pharmacological studies in vitro and in vivo. Cellular assays were done in human proximal 
tubular  cells,  and  in  vivo  studies  were  performed  in  mice  and  rats.  Importantly,  studies  were  done  in 
normoglycemic animals as well as animals with pre-existing diabetes in order to reproduce aspects of the 
beneficial results of the clinical studies and to better understand the mode of action of empagliflozin on the 
renal system. 
Empagliflozin is a potent and selective inhibitor of the human sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT 2). By 
inhibition of SGLT 2 in the proximal tubules of the kidneys empagliflozin reduces the reabsorption of glucose 
leading to increased urinary glucose excretion and, in consequence, to a lowering of blood glucose under 
hyperglycemic as well as normoglycemic conditions. SGLT2 activity results in glucose / sodium absorption 
in  a  ratio  of  1:1.  Increased  reabsorption  of  sodium  contributes  to  diabetic  glomerular  hyperfiltration  by 
lowering the Na-Cl-K concentrations at the macula densa and increasing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
through the physiology of tubuloglomerular feedback. 
Empagliflozin  normalized  GFR  in  various  animal  models.  The  compound  prevented  glomerular 
hyperfiltration in models of DKD in vivo. Different CKD models with reduced GFR empagliflozin prevented 
glomerular  damage  in  various  species,  as  shown  by  the  prevention  of  albuminuria.  Empagliflozin  also 
reduces sodium reabsorption, thereby increasing sodium delivery to the distal tubule. 
Empagliflozin  prevented  inflammatory  processes  in  diabetic  as  well  as  non-diabetic  animals  with  kidney 
diseases induced by different stimuli, exhibiting both glomerular and tubulointerstitial protective measures. 
These effects may contribute to the beneficial effects of empagliflozin on CKD observed in humans. 
Empagliflozin prevented fibrotic processes like epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in vitro. Furthermore, 
renal  remodelling,  including  matrix  and  collagen  deposition,  was  inhibited  in  animals  with  and  without 
diabetes mellitus. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/304328/2023 
Page 9/85 
 
 
 
 
Empagliflozin prevented the increase of reactive oxygen species in vitro and has been shown to inhibit or 
prevent oxidative stress in various pharmacological models. 
Activation of the sympathetic nervous system was shown to be of pathophysiological relevance in animal 
models. This has been demonstrated in an Akita mouse model of diabetes mellitus as well as in a model of 
cyclosporine-induced  kidney  damage.  Empagliflozin  prevented  activation  markers  of  the  sympathetic 
nervous system in both in vivo models. 
Beneficial effects of empagliflozin on kidney disease were demonstrated in mice that showed an increase in 
blood levels of the ketone body beta hydroxybutyrate (b-OHB). Similar beneficial effects were obtained by 
experimental administration of ketone bodies to the mice.  
A  mild  increase  in  plasma  ketone  bodies  was  observed  with  empagliflozin  in  clinical  trials  as  well  as  in 
preclinical studies. Ketone bodies are discussed as additional or alternative “fuel” to glucose oxidation for 
the energy supply of various organs. Indeed, oxidation of ketone bodies, e.g. ß-hydroxybutyrate, appears 
to be an effective way to generate ATP with less oxygen consumption than glucose oxidation. Thus, ketone 
bodies can be regarded as an additional energy source for organs in need.  
All  above-mentioned  effects  of  empagliflozin  can  be  expected  to  be  beneficial  for  the  patients  and  may 
contribute to the overall nephroprotective effects in patients. The exact mechanism of empagliflozin and 
pathways  involved  in  the  benefits  seen  on  the  renal  system,  in  particular  on  chronic  kidney  disease,  is 
presently under investigation in ongoing preclinical and clinical studies. 
In summary: 
Human CKD is a disorder characterized by unphysiological GFR values: hyperfiltration in early DKD, loss of 
GFR in chronic kidney disease. In addition, inflammation, fibrotic processes and oxidative stress commonly 
occur in CKD. Empagliflozin improved renal function and prevented pathophysiological remodelling of the 
kidneys  in  animal  models  of  chronic  kidney  disease  induced  by  different  interventions.  Additionally, 
inflammation and oxidative stress was reduced by empagliflozin and sympathetic activation was attenuated. 
Further,  empagliflozin  might  have  metabolic  effects  providing  ketone  bodies  as  additional  /  alternative 
energy source for the diseased kidney Thus, empagliflozin showed significant beneficial effects on chronic 
kidney disease in a number of different pre-clinical studies in mice and rats. These effects were observed 
consistently in animals with T2DM as well as in non-diabetic animals. 
The beneficial renal effects of empagliflozin may be directly related to SGLT2 inhibition in the kidneys. This 
results in the activation of a tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism, RAAS inhibition, decreased sympathetic 
nerve activity and increased hematocrit. In addition, metabolic effects on renal energy supply, local anti-
inflammatory, anti-remodelling and anti-oxidative effects of empagliflozin may contribute to the beneficial 
effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, despite the number of in vitro 
and in vivo experiments described here and elsewhere, the exact molecular mechanisms of empagliflozin's 
beneficial renal effects are still under investigation.

2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  (ERA)  for  empagliflozin  was  submitted  with  the  initial  MAA  and  an 
updated ERA after completion of an additional study. The risk assessment resulted in the conclusion that 
no significant impact on the environment is expected. 
In the current ERA, the estimation of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) of empagliflozin in 
the various environmental compartments is based on the default market penetration factor (Fpen = 0.01), 
as  provided  in  the  EMA  guideline,  and  the  highest  maximum  daily  dose  of  25  mg.  The  recommended 
maximum daily dose of the newly proposed indication (Chronic Kidney Disease) will only be 10 mg. 
The  default  Fpen  is  based  on  a  very  conservative  worst-case  estimation,  meaning  that  1%  of  all  EU 
inhabitants are treated 365 d/a with the recommended maximum daily dose. The market penetration factor 
was not refined though, e.g., by using the much smaller actual amount of substance placed on the market. 
Therefore, the effects on the environment by adding the new intended Chronic Kidney Disease indication 
with a much smaller patient group are considered negligible and well covered by the used Fpen. 
The ERA tables, including calculations for all proposed indications for Jardiance, were updated as follows: 
Table 1.  Maximum daily doses of empagliflozin for all proposed indications for Jardiance 
To  calculate  the  PEC  values,  taking  into  consideration  all  proposed  indications  of  Jardiance,  the  default 
market penetration factor (Fpen) of 0.01 (not refined) and the sum of the maximum daily doses, i.e. 55 
mg (see Table 1), have been applied. 
For the calculation of the PEC/PNEC ratios in the various environmental compartments the PNEC values as 
mentioned in the original Environmental Risk Assessment have been used (see Table 2 and Table 3).

Phase II – Tier A OECD 308 and Tier B OECD 218 studies: 
In  the  water  sediment  study,  the  relevant  transformation  products  M3  and  M12  generated  in  the 
water/sediment study exceeded the P trigger for sediment (M3) and water (M12), but only after conversion 
to 12°C EU outdoor temperature, and none of the detected transformation products showed continuously 
increasing concentration during the study. 
Consequently,  following  the  ‘total  residue  approach’  (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010  of  17  March  2011)  a 
toxicity  study  in  sediment-dwelling  Chironomid  larvae  (OECD  218)  was  conducted  resulting  in  the 
conclusion that the use of empagliflozin and its transformation products can be considered as insignificant 
environmental risk for the compartment sediment. 
However,  since  the  study  on  identification  of  metabolites  indicates  that  metabolite  M3  may  be  a 
stereoisomer of the parent compound, it might be that M3 has certain pharmacologically activity. Therefore, 
below, information on the structure of M3 and M1 (M12 was instable and could not be further analyzed) as 
well as the DT50-values for total system, sediment and water recalculated to 12 °C for empagliflozin and 
the  relevant  transformation  products  M3,  M1  and  M12  are  given.  M3  is  very  persistent  in  the  sediment 
(DT50 > 180 days) and M12 is persistent in water (DT50 > 40 days).

Conclusion: 
For all three compartments, the PEC/PNEC ratios for all proposed indications of Jardiance are clearly below 
the trigger values of 1 and 0.1, respectively. 
Additionally, empagliflozin and its transformation products can be considered as insignificant environmental 
risk for the compartment sediment. 
Hence, the ERA submitted with the initial MAA remains valid for the current type II variation covering the 
additional proposed indication. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Additional information has been provided on the pharmacologic effects in chronic kidney diseases. Although 
several factors have been mentioned that may contribute to the positive actions of empagliflozin on chronic 
kidney  disease,  the  precise  molecular  mechanisms  of  these  effects  are  not  clear.  Several  possible 
mechanisms  may  play  a  role.  SGLT2i  reduces  glomerular  hyperfiltration  via  various  mechanisms. 
Empagliflozin  improved  renal  function  and  prevented  pathophysiological  remodelling  of  the  kidneys  in 
animal models of chronic kidney disease induced by different interventions. These effects were observed in 
animals with T2DM as well as in non-diabetic animals. Furthermore, the empagliflozin-induced increase in 
ketone bodies may play a role by increasing the uptake and oxidization of β-hydroxybutyrate resulting in 
an improved energy supply. The increase in plasma ketone bodies induced by SGLT2 inhibitors is generally 
mild  and  usually  does  not  exceed  the  physiological  range.  Empagliflozin  was  also  shown  to  reduce 
remodelling processes, including fibrosis in vivo. Further, it reduced inflammation and oxidative stress in 
vivo  and  in  vitro.  It  is  currently  not  clear  which  of  the  numerous  potential  mechanisms  of  action  are  of 
clinical  relevance  or  which  one  would  be  the  dominant  one.  The  proposed  mechanisms  have  been 
substantiated by the literature data and are considered acceptable.  
It is agreed with the MAH that the ERA conclusions, based on the previous ERA of empagliflozin, remain 
unchanged.  The  MAH  has  provided  an  updated  ERA  table,  including  new  calculations  for  all  proposed 
indications of Jardiance. 
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of empaglifozin. 
The non-clinical data provided as part of the application are acceptable.

2.3.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The  exact  mechanisms  of  SGLT2  inhibitors  are  not  completely  understood;  however,  it  has  been 
demonstrated  that  in  addition  to  glucose  lowering,  empagliflozin  reduces  sodium  reabsorption  in  the 
proximal  tubule  and  increases  the  delivery  of  sodium  to  the  distal  tubule.  This  may  influence  several 
physiological functions including, but not restricted to, increasing tubule-glomerular feedback and reducing 
intra-glomerular  pressure,  transient  natriuresis  and  increasing  urine  volume,  lowering  both  pre-  and 
afterload  of  the  heart,  downregulating  sympathetic  activity,  and  reducing  left  ventricular  wall  stress  as 
evidenced by lower NT-proBNP values and beneficial effects on cardiac remodelling, filling pressures and 
diastolic function. Other effects such as an increase in haematocrit, a reduction in body weight and blood 
pressure, and a lowering of uric acid, may further contribute to the beneficial effects. 
The proposed mechanism for reno-protective effects are as follows: mechanisms behind the kidney effects 
of empagliflozin are likely multifactorial, but direct kidney haemodynamic effects are considered to play an 
important  role.  Empagliflozin  reduces  proximal  tubular  sodium  reabsorption,  thereby  increasing  distal 
sodium delivery to the macula densa, which has been shown to activate tubuloglomerular feedback leading 
to  afferent  arteriolar  vasoconstriction,  thereby  reducing  intraglomerular  pressure  and  urinary  albumin 
excretion. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
There were no new dedicated clinical pharmacology studies. There were no clinical pharmacology analyses 
in the EMPA-KIDNEY trial.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
There were no new dedicated clinical pharmacology studies, which is acceptable. There were no clinical 
pharmacology analyses in the EMPA-KIDNEY trial. The proposed mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors with 
regards to renoprotection are likely multifactorial, but direct kidney haemodynamic effects are considered 
to play an important role. Empagliflozin reduces proximal tubular sodium reabsorption, thereby increasing 
distal sodium delivery to the macula densa, which has been shown to activate a tubuloglomerular 
feedback leading to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, thereby reducing intraglomerular pressure. 
Current knowledge on the mechanism of actions of empagliflozin has been sufficiently described. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
There were no new dedicated clinical pharmacology studies, which is acceptable. The mechanisms of action 
of  SGLT2  inhibitors  for  renoprotection  are  not  completely  understood  but  likely  related  to  direct 
hemodynamic  effects  leading  to  a  reduction  in  intraglomerular  pressure.  Current  knowledge  on  the 
mechanism of action of empagliflozin has been sufficiently described. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy is based on the results of the Phase III pivotal outcome trial 1245.137 (EMPA-
KIDNEY). 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
No specific dose response studies were performed. The dose for the EMPA-KIDNEY trials was based on 
previous results from the EMPA-REG trial.  
The results of trial 1245.25 (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) in patients with T2DM and established CV disease 
showed that empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of 3-point major adverse cardiovascular event 
(3P-MACE), which was mainly driven by the reduction in CV death. The results were consistent for 
empagliflozin doses of 10 mg and 25 mg once daily. A post hoc analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial 
indicated that empagliflozin significantly reduced the incidence of the composite outcome of doubling of 
creatinine, the need to start kidney replacement therapy or renal death. These benefits were consistent 
regardless of baseline use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor 
blocker (ARB). In addition, there was no evidence of an increased risk of hyperkalaemia or acute kidney 
injury. For all cardiovascular, renal, and mortality outcomes assessed in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, 
risk reductions observed with 10 mg and 25 mg were virtually identical with a similar safety profile. As a 
result, 10 mg is the only dose being evaluated in other ongoing outcome studies in patients with chronic 
heart failure. For the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, only the dose of 10 mg was therefore being investigated. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Study 1245.137 (EMPA-KIDNEY) 
The main study was trial 1245.137, also known as EMPA-KIDNEY, a multicentre international randomized 
parallel group double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of empagliflozin once daily to assess cardio-renal 
outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Methods 
Study participants 
Key inclusion criteria were:  
•  Age was ≥18 years at time of Screening  
•  Evidence of progressive CKD at risk of kidney disease progression.  
This was based on local laboratory results recorded at least 3 months before and at the time of the 
Screening visit, and required that:  
o  CKD-EPI eGFR ≥20 <45 mL/min/1.73m²; or 
o  CKD-EPI eGFR ≥45 <90 mL/min/1.73m2 with urinary albumin:creatinine ratio ≥200 mg/g 
(or protein:creatinine ratio ≥300 mg/g).  
• 
Treatment  with  appropriate  doses  of  single  agent  RAS-inhibition  with  either  ACEi  or  ARB  unless 
such treatment was either not tolerated or not indicated. 
Note: the number of participants with or without diabetes mellitus (of any type) was to be at least one-
third of each, and the number of participants with an eGFR >45 mL/min/1.73m2 limited to about one-third.  
Key exclusion criteria were 
•  Currently receiving SGLT-2 or SGLT-1/2 inhibitor 
•  Diabetes mellitus type 2 and prior atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with an 
eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73m2 at time of Screening 
•  Receiving combined ACEi and ARB treatment 
•  Maintenance dialysis, functioning kidney transplant, or scheduled living donor transplant 
• 
•  Symptomatic hypotension, or systolic blood pressure <90 or >180 mmHg at time of Screening 
•  Any immunosuppression therapy in the last 3 months (except prednisolone ≤10 mg or equivalent); 
Polycystic kidney disease 
or anyone currently on >10 mg prednisolone (or equivalent) 
In addition, individuals were to be excluded at the Randomization visit if the participant did not adhere to 
run-in treatment, was no longer willing to be randomized and followed for at least 3 years, was considered 
by  a  local  investigator  not  to  be  suitable  for  randomization,  or  experienced  ketoacidosis,  heart  attack, 
stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure, or hospitalization for urinary tract infection or acute kidney injury 
during run-in. 
Treatments 
This was a multicentre international randomised parallel group double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial 
of  empagliflozin  10  mg  once  daily  on  top  of  background  therapy,  including  RASi  to  assess  cardio-renal 
outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease. 
Prior to randomisation, potentially eligible participants entered an 8-12 week ‘Run-in’ period, during which 
they received single-blind placebo tablets. The main purpose of the Run-in period was to help ensure that 
only those likely to continue taking study treatment for an extended period were randomised (see Figure 
1). It also provided time to confirm inclusion criteria based on the local samples taken at the Screening 
Visit, and provided investigators with an opportunity to review and approve the participation of each patient 
and  to  ensure  they  were  on  appropriate  background  therapy  (including  RAS  inhibitors).  Eligible  and

consenting individuals attending the Randomisation Visit were allocated to empagliflozin 10 mg or placebo 
in  a  1:1  ratio  using  a  minimised  randomisation  algorithm  that  helps  to  ensure  balance  between  the 
treatment  groups  with  respect  to  the  following  prognostic  variables:  age,  sex,  prior  diabetes,  eGFR  and 
UACR  (both  based  on  local  laboratory  results  at  screening),  and  region.  Following  randomisation, 
participants were scheduled to attend Follow-up visits at 2 and 6 months, and then 6-monthly until the end 
of the trial. 
Figure 1.  Design of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial 
In general, baseline was defined as the last available measurement on or prior to the day of randomisation 
(excluding  any  pre-screening  measurements).  Trial  medication  start  was  planned  on  the  day  of 
randomisation and baseline assessments were to be taken prior to any intake of trial medication. 
One  tablet  was  to  be  taken  daily  with  or  without  food.  To  ensure  a  dose  interval  of  about  24  hours, 
instructions  were  provided  to  participants  suggesting  the  medication  was  ideally  to  be  taken  at 
approximately the same time every day. 
Objectives 
The  primary  aim  was  to  assess  the  effect  of  empagliflozin  on  time  to  kidney  disease  progression  or  CV 
death.  The  key  secondary  aims  were  to  assess  the  effect  of  empagliflozin  on  time  to  HHF  or  CV  death, 
occurrences  of  hospitalisations  from  any  cause,  and  time  to  death  from  any  cause.  Other  assessments, 
including analyses of safety, were also planned. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The following endpoints were defined for the EMPA-KIDNEY trial: 
Primary endpoint: 
The primary endpoint was a composite of 
• 
time to kidney disease progression, defined as the first occurrence of any of the following: 
‒ 
‒ 
‒ 
‒ 
end stage kidney disease [ESKD*],  
a sustained decline in eGFR to <10 mL/min/1.73 m2,  
‘as adjudicated’ renal death, or  
a sustained decline of ≥40% in eGFR from randomization 
• 
 CV death (‘as adjudicated’) 
Secondary endpoints: 
Key secondary endpoints (confirmatory):

• 
• 
• 
time to the first occurrence of HHF (‘as adjudicated’) or CV death (‘as adjudicated’) 
time to occurrences of all-cause hospitalisations (first and recurrent combined) 
time to death from any cause (‘as adjudicated’) 
Other secondary endpoints (exploratory): 
• 
• 
• 
time to the first occurrence of kidney disease progression 
time to CV death (‘as adjudicated’) 
time to first occurrence of CV death (‘as adjudicated’) or ESKD* 
*ESKD was defined as the initiation of maintenance dialysis or receipt of a kidney transplant. Dialysis was 
considered as maintenance if it was required for ≥90 days or if the dialysis was stopped within 90 days for 
a reason of ‘received kidney transplant’, ‘dialysis is futile’ or ‘subject refused dialysis’. Dialysis ongoing at 
the last scheduled trial follow-up visit or the last scheduled visit before death^, withdrawal of consent or 
loss to follow-up was also considered as maintenance irrespective of duration. Where changes in dialysis 
modality  were  consecutive  with  one  another  durations  were  summed  for  determining  whether  the 
maintenance duration had been met. 
^ For deaths within 90 days of starting dialysis an adjudicator was asked to consider whether the dialysis 
would have been required long-term or only temporarily; if temporary then the outcome of dialysis was to 
be changed from ‘ongoing’ to ‘stopped for other reason’ and not considered as an ESKD event. 
To meet the requirement for a ‘sustained’ decline in eGFR, this was defined as either: 
•  measured at 2 consecutive scheduled trial follow-up visits (at least 30 days apart); or 
•  measured  at  the  last  scheduled  trial  follow-up  visit  or  the  last  scheduled  visit  before  death, 
withdrawal of consent or loss to follow-up. 
Sample size 
The  trial  was  planned  to  randomise  approximately  6000  participants  from  about  200-250  sites  and  to 
continue until a minimum of 1070 primary outcome events has occurred. Such an event-driven trial would 
provide an overall power of 90% at p = 0.05 (2-sided) to detect an 18% relative reduction in the primary 
outcome  (time  to  kidney  disease  progression  or  CV  death).  During  the  trial,  the  Steering  Committee 
monitored event rates for the primary outcome and its components blind to treatment allocation, and if 
necessary, could consider proposing changes to the protocol. 
Randomisation 
Eligible and consenting individuals were allocated empagliflozin or matching placebo using a minimisation 
approach  via  a  randomisation  program  on  the  trial  computer-based  system.  The  algorithm  included  a 
stochastic element (treatment was assigned to the arm determined by the minimisation algorithm with a 
probability  of  0.9  and  by  a  random  number  generator  with  a  probability  of  0.1).  Given  the  stochastic 
element  of  the  randomisation,  rerandomisation  methods  for  the  analysis  were  not  considered  necessary 
and only traditional methods of analysis were planned. Randomised participants were to be issued with a 
7-month supply of study treatment consisting of empagliflozin 10 mg or matching placebo. 
Blinding (masking) 
Participants, investigators and everyone involved in trial conduct or analysis or with any other interest in 
this  double-blind  trial  (apart  from  the  DMC)  remained  blinded  with  regard  to  the  randomised  treatment 
assignments. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/304328/2023 
Page 20/85 
 
 
 
 
 
During the trial, unblinded analyses of all Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and other trial outcomes, both 
overall and in key subgroups, including by region, and all SSARs were supplied in strict confidence to the 
independent DMC. The unblinded Independent Statistician for the DMC was responsible for generating and 
providing these unblinded reports. 
A central panel of clinicians based at, or overseen by, the CCO was responsible for the adjudication of all 
deaths and events initially reported as HHF, MI, stroke, liver injury, ketoacidosis, lower limb amputation, 
genital infections, and acute kidney injury as specified in the respective SOP. The members of that panel, 
and  all  staff  involved  in  preparing  the  documents  reviewed  by  the  panel,  remained  blinded  for  the 
adjudication.  
Statistical methods 
The trial was designed to have a power of 90% for the primary endpoint at a 2-sided α of 0.05 to detect 
an 18% relative reduction in the primary outcome, which required approximately 1070 primary outcome 
events. 
The  final  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  was  performed  at  a  2-sided  α  of  0.0017.  If  the  confirmatory 
primary  endpoint  was  significant,  the  formal  statistical  testing  of  the  key  secondary  endpoints  was 
performed via the Hochberg procedure, preserving the trial's overall type I error rate, starting with a 2-
sided α of 0.0290. The significance levels were predefined according to α-spending functions based on the 
number of primary outcome events observed at the time of the DMC interim analysis. 
Unless otherwise specified, efficacy analyses followed the ITT principle and included all randomised patients 
(RS; treatment assigned as randomised) and all available data from the follow-up period (OC-AD); data 
occurring after the final follow-up visit were not considered.  
Adjudication  was  performed  for  all  deaths  and  events  initially  reported  as  HHF,  myocardial  infarction, 
stroke,  liver  injury,  ketoacidosis,  lower  limb  amputation,  genital  infections,  and  acute  kidney  injury.  A 
central panel of responsible clinicians remained blinded for the adjudication. 
The  primary  and  secondary  time-to-event  endpoints  were  analysed  using  a  Cox  proportional  hazards 
regression model with factors of treatment (empagliflozin, placebo) and each of the variables used in the 
minimisation algorithm for randomisation. This model was used to test the equality of the hazard rates via 
the Wald test for the treatment effect. The same model was used to estimate the HR of the treatment effect 
and  the  corresponding  asymptotic  2-sided  95%  Wald  confidence  interval  (CI).  Cumulative  incidence 
function  and/or  Kaplan-Meier  curves  were  also  produced  to  summarise  the  primary  endpoint  data. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to testing the influence of the source of eGFR data (central or local); 
omitting the randomisation minimisation factors; missing data imputation; competing risk of non-CV/renal 
death (Fine-Gray); COVID-19 AEs.

Recruitment 
This trial was a multicentre trial conducted in 8 countries across North America, Europe, and Asia. Of the 
8266 screened participants, 1657 were not randomised; most commonly because of ineligible screening lab 
results.

Conduct of the study 
The trial has been completed (first patient screened 01 Feb 2019, last patient completed 05 Jul 2022). The 
trial was carried out in compliance with the clinical trial protocol, in accordance with the principles of the 
Declaration  of  Helsinki,  in  accordance  with  ICH  GCP,  and  in  accordance  with  applicable  regulatory 
requirements and the Applicant’s standard operating procedures. 
The EMPA-KIDNEY trial was carried out at 241 clinical sites in 8 countries in North America, Europe, and 
Asia (United States, Canada, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, China, Malaysia, and Japan). 
If knowledge of the actual treatment of a participant was required to provide appropriate medical treatment 
or  to  assure  the  safety  of  trial  participants,  investigators  could  request  emergency  unblinding  of  the 
treatment allocation. During this trial, the medication code was broken for 3 participants. The medication 
code for one participant was broken by the investigator due to adverse events. The medication codes for 
the 2 other participants were broken by the investigators due to other medical reasons. 
Before  the  COVID-19  outbreak,  2848  of  6609  participants  had  been  randomised  in  this  trial,  and  3761 
participants were randomised thereafter. 
The overall proportion of participants with important protocol deviations was similar between the treatment 
groups. The most common important protocol deviation was clustered/short visits, with data not entered 
in real-time.

Table 9.  Demographic data – RS 
The mean eGFR at baseline was 37.3 (SD 14.45) mL/min/1.73 m2. A total of 34.5% of participants had an 
eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, 44.3% had an eGFR ≥30 and <45, 13.4% had an eGFR ≥45 and <60, and 
7.7%  had  an  eGFR  ≥60.  The  median  UACR  was  329.4  mg/g  (Q1,  Q3  48.5,  1068.9).  Normal  UACR  was 
reported for 20.1% of participants, while 28.2% had microalbuminuria and 51.7% had macroalbuminuria. 
54.0% of the participants were non-diabetic, 44.4% had T2DM, 1.0% had T1DM, and the diabetes status 
was unknown or missing for 0.5%. The primary cause of kidney disease was diabetes (31.1%), followed by 
glomerular  disease  (25.3  %),  and  hypertensive/renovascular  disease  (21.9%).  About  one-quarter  of 
participants had prior CV diseases (26.7%), and 10.0% had prior HF.

Concomitant  therapies  at  baseline  were  balanced  across  the  treatment  groups.  A  total  of  85.2%  of 
participants used RAS-inhibitors at baseline. 
The proportion of participants who used diuretics during follow-up increased to 46.7% vs. 41.8% at baseline 
in the placebo group, while it remained almost the same in the empagliflozin group (41.2% vs. 41.8%). 
The  increases  in  use  of  RAS-inhibitors,  betablockers,  and  drugs  for  diabetes  during  the  follow-up  were 
comparable between treatment groups.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint (Time to Kidney disease progression or CV death) 
Kidney  disease  progression  or  CV  death  events  occurred  in  a  lower  proportion  of  participants  in  the 
empagliflozin group in comparison to the placebo group. The risk of kidney disease progression or CV death 
was significantly reduced by 28% with empagliflozin treatment compared with placebo (HR 0.72; 99.83% 
CI 0.59, 0.89). No renal deaths as part of the composite endpoint occurred.

The separation of the estimated cumulative incidence of kidney disease progression or CV death between 
empagliflozin and placebo became evident approximately 1 year after randomisation and continued over 
time until the number of participants at risk became too low to provide stable estimates.

Key secondary endpoints (Hochbergtesting) 
As  the  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  was  statistically  significant  (p<0.0017),  confirmatory  statistical 
testing of the key secondary endpoints was performed. The order of testing the key secondary endpoints 
and  the  2-sided  significance  levels  were  determined  through  the  Hochberg  procedure;  testing  was 
performed in the order of the observed p-values, from largest to smallest. The required significance level 
for  the  first  key  secondary  endpoint  was  p<0.0290;  for  the  second  endpoint,  p<0.0145  (if  first  non-
significant), and p<0.0097 for the third endpoint (if second non-significant). 
•  Time to occurrence of all-cause hospitalisation, first and recurrent combined 
All-cause hospitalisations occurred in a lower proportion of participants in the empagliflozin group than in 
the placebo group. The total number of hospitalisations events (first and recurrent) was also lower in the 
empagliflozin  group  than  in  the  placebo  group.  The  risk  of  all-cause  hospitalisations  was  significantly 
reduced for empagliflozin vs. placebo (Table 15). 
Table 15.  Time to all-cause hospitalisations (first and recurrent combined) and adjudicated death, joint 
frailty model – RS 
The mean cumulative incidence of all-cause hospitalisations in the empagliflozin and placebo groups started 
to diverge shortly after randomisation and continued to separate over time. 
•  Time to first occurrence of HHF or CV death 
Although HHF or CV death occurred in a lower proportion of participants in the empagliflozin group than in 
the placebo group, the risk of HHF or CV death was not significantly reduced with empagliflozin as compared 
with placebo (Table 16).

group. The risk of all-cause death was not significantly reduced with empagliflozin treatment as compared 
with placebo.

•  Time to first occurrence of kidney disease progression  
Kidney disease progression occurred in a lower proportion of participants in the empagliflozin group than 
in the placebo group. The risk of kidney disease progression was reduced with empagliflozin treatment vs. 
placebo.

Adjudicated CV death occurred in a low proportion of participants in both treatment groups. There was no 
strong evidence of a treatment difference between empagliflozin and placebo. 
Table 19.  Time to adjudicated CV death, Cox regression – RS 
•  Time to first occurrence of adjudicated CV death or ESKD  
CV  death  or  ESKD  occurred  in  a  lower  proportion  of  participants  in  the  empagliflozin  group  than  in  the 
placebo group. The risk of CV death or ESKD was reduced with empagliflozin treatment vs. placebo.

•  eGFR changes over time (MMRM analyses) 
In  the  empagliflozin  group,  there  was  an  initial  drop  in  eGFR.  The  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline 
(MMRM results) in eGFR [mL/min/1.73 m2] at 2 months in the empagliflozin group was -2.76 (95% CI -
2.95, -2.58) and -0.64 (95% CI -0.82, -0.45) in the placebo group. After the initial drop, a slower decrease 
was  observed  for  empagliflozin  compared  with  placebo.  This  resulted  in  adjusted  mean  change  from 
baseline at 36 months of -6.25 (95% CI -6.87, -5.63) in the empagliflozin group compared with -7.42 (95% 
CI -8.05, -6.79) in the placebo group. The treatment group difference in adjusted means for the average 
change from baseline over time was -0.31 (95% CI -0.60, -0.01). 
Figure 3.  eGFR [mL/min/1.73 m2] change from baseline over time, MMRM results (centrally assessed) – 
RS (OC-AD) 
•  Annual rate of change in eGFR 
The annual rate of change in eGFR (allowing for the competing events of ESKD or death) was evaluated 
using  a  shared  parameter  model.  The  main  analysis  was  based  on  central  laboratory  evaluations  and 
included all samples collected prior to ESKD. 
The  total  slope  analysis  was  based  on  the  time  from  baseline  to  final  follow-up,  therefore,  the  intercept 
reflects the modelled mean eGFR value per treatment group at baseline. As the analysis assumes a single 
linear relationship, the total slope results for the empagliflozin group are considered to be biased due to 
the non-linearity introduced by the acute drop in eGFR. 
In contrast, the chronic slope analysis was performed based on the time from 2 months to final follow-up. 
The intercept in the chronic slope analysis reflects the mean change from baseline to the 2-month visit per 
group  and  can  be  interpreted  as  the  acute  slope  of  the  initial  2  months.  This  acute  slope  was  more 
pronounced in the empagliflozin group (-2.32 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared with the placebo group (-0.24 
mL/min/1.73 m2). The annual rate of change from the 2-month visit onwards (i.e. the chronic slope) models

the approximately linear decline in the chronic phase. The chronic slope showed a greater eGFR decline in 
the  placebo  group  compared  with  the  empagliflozin  group,  with  a  between  group  difference  of  1.37 
mL/min/1.73 m2 per year (95% CI 1.16, 1.59) and relative difference to placebo of -50% (95% CI -56%, 
-44%).

•  UACR changes over time 
UACR  initially  decreased  after  2  months  in  the  empagliflozin  group  and  later  fluctuated  below  baseline, 
while UACR in the placebo group increased over the course of the trial (MMRM results). UACR remained 
lower in the empagliflozin group compared with the placebo group throughout the trial. The difference in 
the average relative change from baseline over time (MMRM results, gMean ratio) was 0.81 (95% CI 0.77, 
0.85) for empagliflozin compared with placebo.

•  Time to adjudicated death by category of cause 
Analyses  of  adjudicated  death  by  different  categories  of  cause  did  not  indicate  a  treatment  difference 
between the empagliflozin and placebo groups.

•  Time to first occurrence of a major CV event 
The  number  of  participants  with  an  adjudicated  major  CV  event  (i.e.  CV  death,  MI,  stroke  or  HHF)  was 
comparable between empagliflozin and placebo. 
Table 23.  Time to adjudicated major CV event, Cox regression – RS 
•  Time to occurrence of adjudicated HHF 
The time to first occurrence of HHF (Cox regression) and a combined analysis of time to first and recurrent 
HHF  (Joint  frailty  model)  were  analysed  as  further  endpoints.  There  were  no  statistically  significant 
treatment differences for either analysis of the time to occurrence of adjudicated HHF. 
Table 24.  Time to HHF – RS 
•  Time to new onset of diabetes 
The number of participants without diabetes at baseline who had new onset of diabetes during the trial was 
low in both treatment groups. There was no difference in the time to new onset of diabetes in participants 
without diabetes at baseline between the empagliflozin and placebo groups.

•  Time to first occurrence of self-reported gout 
There was no difference in the time to first occurrence of self-reported gout between the empagliflozin and 
placebo  groups:  the  event  was  reported  by  278  participants  (8.4%)  in  the  empagliflozin  group  and  317 
participants (9.6%) in the placebo group (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.74, 1.02); 
•  HbA1c changes over time 
The initial timepoints assessed for the majority of participants showed a greater reduction of HbA1c in the 
empagliflozin  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group,  while  the  later  timepoints  considering  fewer 
participants showed large variability. The average change from baseline over time (MMRM results) was -
0.4 (95% CI -0.8, 0.0) for empagliflozin compared with placebo. 
•  EQ-5D 
There were no relevant treatment differences in the descriptive analyses across the treatment groups in 
the scores of the EQ-5D questionnaire. 
Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint 
The cumulative probability for the censoring of participants without endpoint events were similar between 
treatment groups. 
An  exploratory  analysis  by  year  since  randomisation  was  performed  to  explore  whether  the  HR  for  the 
primary  endpoint  varied  over  time.  The  results  were  numerically  similar  and  consistent  with  the  overall 
results; HR (95% CI) was 0.73 (0.57, 0.94) in the first year, 0.68 (0.57, 0.82) in the second year, and 
0.77 (0.61, 0.98) afterwards (trend test interaction p-value = 0.7241). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/304328/2023 
Page 39/85 
 
 
 
 
 
The sensitivity analyses were exploratory, and in all cases the results were consistent (i.e. the HR and CIs 
were  similar)  with  the  results  of  the  primary  analysis.  There  was  no  meaningful  effect  on  the  primary 
analysis results with respect to the presence of COVID-19 AEs. 
Figure 6.  Sensitivity analyses of the time to the first event of kidney disease progression or adjudicated 
CV death – RS 
The tipping point analysis did not reveal any scenarios where the treatment effect in subjects with missing 
data would overturn the overall significant treatment effect obtained from the primary analysis. There were 
only 23 participants in the empagliflozin group and 18 in the placebo group, who were lost to follow-up with 
no evidence of a primary endpoint event, for whom data needed to be imputed.  
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint 
Results of the post hoc sensitivity analysis based on the regions used in the randomisation minimisation 
process rather than the actual region (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.82; p<0.0001; were consistent with the 
confirmatory analysis. 
The results of the primary endpoint were consistent (interaction p-values >0.05) across the subgroups of 
key interest of baseline diabetes status and baseline eGFR, with the upper bound of the 95% CI for the HR 
for each subgroup <1.  
There was a trend towards increasing treatment effect in participants with higher levels of UACR at baseline 
(trend test interaction p-value = 0.0174).

In  the  subgroup  analysis  by  baseline  eGFR  <20,  20  to  <30,  30  to  <45,  and  ≥45  mL/min/1.73  m2,  the 
results were consistent, HR (95% CI) was 0.73 (0.50, 1.06) for eGFR <20, 0.74 (0.61, 0.89) for eGFR 20 
to <30, 0.78 (0.63, 0.98) for eGFR 30 to <45, and 0.64 (0.44, 0.93) for eGFR ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (trend 
test interaction p-value = 0.8114). 
In the subgroup analysis by baseline UACR <200 and ≥200 mg/g, the results were consistent: HR (95% 
CI) was 0.87 (0.66, 1.15) for UACR <200 mg/g and 0.71 (0.62, 0.82) for UACR ≥200 mg/g (interaction p-
value = 0.2090).  
Results  of  other  subgroup  analyses,  including  background  use  of  RAS-inhibitors  and  underlying  renal 
diseases, were consistent (interaction p-values >0.05); see figure below. Note that the subgroup analyses 
were  not  adjusted  for  multiple  testing  and  effects  observed  in  small  subgroups  are  prone  to  random 
variation.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The EMPA-KIDNEY study was designed as a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group 
event-driven study to demonstrate superiority on slowing renal disease progression of empagliflozin 10 mg 
vs. placebo on top of guideline-directed medical therapy (including appropriate RASi background therapy) 
in a population generally at risk of kidney disease progression both with and without diabetes. The design 
of the study is generally acceptable to potentially demonstrate the defined objective.  
The key inclusion criteria are patients with either eGFR ≥20 <45 mL/min/1.73m2, or an eGFR ≥45 – 90 
mL/min/1.73m2 with urinary albumin/creatinine ratio ≥200 mg/g (or protein/creatinine ratio≥300 mg/g), 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 44/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which can generally be considered a broad population at risk of further renal disease progression. However, 
a CKD population of patients with eGFR 45 to 60 (and 60 to 90) ml/min/1.73m2 without albuminuria was 
not  included,  likely  due  to  a  lower  risk  of  disease  progression.  Furthermore,  patients  had  to  be  on  an 
appropriate  dose  of  single  agent  RAS-inhibition  with  either  ACEi  or  ARB,  which  appropriately  reflects  an 
important treatment element in the clinical care of these patients. Key exclusion criteria were maintenance 
dialysis,  functioning  kidney  transplant,  polycystic  kidney  disease  and  immunosuppressive  usage  (except 
prednisolone ≤10 mg or equivalent), which can be considered reasonable. Though the exclusion of patients 
with polycystic nephropathy and those receiving immunosuppressive medication does mean the trial is not 
fully representative of the whole CKD population, it is not considered needed to specifically mention this in 
the SmPC, comparable to other products of the same class (dapagliflozin).  
The  primary  endpoint  was  a  composite  of  time  to  the  first  occurrence  of  kidney  disease  progression 
(defined  as  end  stage  kidney  disease  [ESKD],  a  sustained  decline  in  eGFR  to  <10  mL/min/1.73  m2,  ‘as 
adjudicated’ renal death, or a sustained decline of ≥40% in eGFR from randomisation); or CV death (‘as 
adjudicated’), which is an acceptable composite and previously used in other renal studies to evaluate any 
potential  protective  renal  treatment  effect.  All-cause  mortality  has  been  included  as  a  key  secondary 
outcome following hierarchical testing, which is acceptable and in line with SAWP recommendations. The 
key  secondary  endpoint  of  time  to  the  first  occurrence  of  HHF  (‘as  adjudicated’)  or  CV  death  (‘as 
adjudicated’) is mainly targeted at the evaluation of cardiovascular effects, which could be understood in 
the context of the known cardio-renal interaction in the disease targeted to be treated and further expand 
on the possible intercurrent effects. It has been explained by the Applicant that the key secondary endpoint 
of time to occurrences of all-cause hospitalisations (first and recurrent combined), may reflect the risk of 
disease  burden  and  mortality.  Further,  a  separation  between  renal  and  cardiovascular  causes  has  been 
provided and shows consistent beneficial effects.  
Other  secondary  and  exploratory  endpoints,  including  single  endpoints  of  previously  mentioned 
composite  endpoints,  other  combinations  of  these  endpoints,  eGFR  trajectories,  and  some  adjudicated 
safety  (gout)  and  biochemical  endpoints  (diabetes  related),  appear  reasonable;  however,  they  are  not 
corrected for possible multiplicity, which limits their support for the main and key secondary findings. 
Blinding  methods  are  commonly  used  for  such  relatively  large  trials  and  can  be  considered  acceptable. 
While the use of minimization allocation is not common for large studies, given the number of strata used, 
it can be understood and was agreed in the CHMP scientific advice. However, according to the same SAWP 
advice, re-randomisation tests were to be considered for the analysis of primary and secondary endpoints, 
given the fact that the random element used in the allocation is small (10%) and the primary analysis does 
not reflect the actual allocation procedure used. Post-hoc re-randomisation tests were performed, which 
showed consistency with the results of the primary analysis. 
Other than the fact that the dynamic allocation was not reflected in the analyses, the analysis populations 
are  acceptable,  the  analysis  of  the  endpoints  are  considered  standard  and  acceptable,  and  multiplicity 
across the endpoints is handled adequately.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
To  include  a  sufficient  number  of  patients,  8266  patients  were  screened  in  centres  across  the  Globe,  of 
which 1657 were not randomised. Of these, only 4.9% were not randomised due to valid reasons in accord 
with the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study, while a large proportion was not randomised due to 
ineligible screening lab results. This latter description is rather vague, but was explained to be in relation 
to the eGFR and UACR values as eligibility criteria.  
Of the 6609 patients randomised (3304 empagliflozin vs 3305 placebo), only 0.6% discontinued the trial, 
which is reassuring. A substantial number of 25.7% vs 22.9% discontinued study treatment, with 9.6% for 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 45/85 
 
 
 
 
unknown reasons. Despite additional efforts by the Applicant, these reasons could not be retrieved. Further, 
this was only slightly increased for empagliflozin mainly due to reasons of adverse events (7.5% vs 7.1%), 
which may indicate that the study treatment was well tolerated during the study period.  
In general, demographics were well-balanced between the treatment groups in the trial. The majority of 
subjects was elderly (55% > 65 years) and white male subjects (67%). Black or African American patients 
may  be  considered  underrepresented  (4.0%).  A  sufficient  proportion  of  patients  was  included  in  Europe 
(40.1%).  Following  the  inclusion  criteria,  patients  had  a  mean  eGFR  of  37  mL/min/1.73  m2,  with  52% 
having  macro-albuminuria  (>300  mg/g),  representing  a  patient  population  at  high  risk  of  disease 
progression. The population was well stratified according to diabetes status, with 54% being non-diabetic. 
T1DM was an exclusion criterium, which seems reasonable based on the current indication, and only 1% 
with T1DM was included. The use of concomitant therapies was as expected, including RASi as cornerstone 
therapy (85%) in line with the treatment guidelines for CKD and was at baseline equally distributed between 
the  treatment  groups.  More  diuretics  were  administered  during  treatment  for  the  placebo  group  (from 
41.8% to 46.7% vs. 41.2% to 41.8%), which could implicitly support the renal benefits as observed (see 
below). 
Empagliflozin showed a significantly superior effect for the primary endpoint of time to the first event of 
kidney disease progression or adjudicated CV death (432 (13.1%) vs 448 (16.9%); HR 0.72 (0.64, 0.82), 
p<0.001, which became evident after approximately 1 year of treatment. The primary endpoint was mainly 
driven by the eGFR reduction ≥40% surrogate (293 (8.9%) vs 373 (11.3%)), although every component 
demonstrated  a  lower  number  of  events  for  empagliflozin  during  the  study  period.  Consistency  in  all 
sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of the primary finding. Also, secondary and exploratory renal 
(composite) endpoints supported the major finding, including endpoints of time to first occurrence of kidney 
disease progression, time to different renal outcome definitions, a slower rate in eGFR change (slope), and 
slower annual rate for total slope and chronic slope. Further, the positive renal findings occurred before any 
CV effects emerged, with non-significant findings in overall mortality, CV mortality, CV endpoints (major 
CV events, time to HHF), and renal components driving the significance of any other combined renal/CV 
endpoints (time to CV death or ESKD). From a mechanistic point of view and as previously observed, the 
initial drop in eGFR and greater reduction in UACR with empagliflozin are of further support. 
Although the renal findings appear convincing based on these findings and the sensitivity analyses, a slightly 
larger decrease in body-weight (-1.6 kg vs -0.7 kg already at month 6 and approximately -2.7 kg vs -1.7 
kg  at  36  months)  was  observed  compared  to  placebo.  However,  this  was  not  significantly  different  for 
muscle  mass  (rather  body  water)  and  is  not  believed  to  strongly  alter  the  renal  findings  from  a  clinical 
perspective.  
It could be questioned whether current data would sufficiently justify treatment across the full range of the 
CKD population as currently proposed in the extension of indication. The full range of the CKD population 
was not included in the study, but was limited to those with a eGFR 20 to 45 mL/min/1.73m2, or eGFR 45-
90  mL/min/1.73m2  and  albuminuria  ≥200  mg/g.  The  possibility  of  extrapolation  to  patients  possibly  at 
lower risk of renal disease progression did not seem directly apparent from current trial. However, further 
evidence was provided by the Applicant during the procedure and following the assessment of all available 
data the CHMP considered it reasonable to accept the broader CKD indication. In support, the MAH provided 
and discussed data on the other studies previously submitted (EMPAREG-OUTCOME and EMPEROR studies) 
including patients with less advanced stages of CKD and moderate to high risk according to KDIGO criteria. 
These  sufficiently  large  subgroups  also  show  treatment  benefits  for  patient  with  renal  progression.  In 
addition,  a  meta-analysis  was  submitted  and  discussed,  showing  efficacy  combined  and  across  several 
SGLT2i  including  patients  for  a  range  of  mean  eGFR  baseline  from  37  to  85  mL/min/1.73m2  m2  and  a 
broad range of UACR. Also, from a mechanistic point of view, such data can be extrapolated to the current 
empagliflozin dossier. However, as for other SGLT2 inhibitors, data on an eGFR <20 ml/min/1.73m2 are 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

very limited and therefore initiation of empagliflozin in this lower eGFR range population is not supported. 
Section 4.2 (Posology and method of administration) of the SmPC was amended to reflect this information.    
Further, although the primary results did appear to be consistent across the key subgroup of baseline eGFR, 
this appeared less consistent for diabetes status and albuminuria level. In non-diabetic patients, the effect 
was slightly less apparent (HR 0.82 (0.68, 0.99) vs diabetic (HR 0.64 (0.54, 0.77), although the p-value 
for interaction did not reach significance (0.0598). For albuminuria, a trend toward lower efficacy with lower 
albuminuria could be observed (p=0.0174), while no significant p for interaction was observed for urinary 
albumin:creatinine  ratio  <  vs  ≥200  mg/g  (HR  0.87  (0.66,  1.15)  and  0.71  (0.62,  0.82),  respectively 
(interaction p-value = 0.2090)). In particular, in the normal to micro-albuminuria groups, a lack of or very 
limited  efficacy  appears  to  be  present.  A  statement  reflecting  these  findings  is  included  in  the  SmPC. 
Presentation  of  patients  in  the  lower  KDIGO  risk  categories  was  limited,  however,  due  to  the  additional 
discussion for the overall class and based on other studies with empagliflozin, not considered to be of major 
concern.  A  further  presentation  of  data  of  treatment  effects  according  to  albuminuria  subgroups  and 
interaction with GFR subgroups and diabetes status are too limited to draw conclusions on, also because of 
inherent limitations of subgroups analyses.  
A minor difference in reduction in HbA1c (-0.4 %) was observed. This may be expected, as the glucose-
lowering  effect  of  empagliflozin  is  eGFR  dependent,  thereby  low  in  this  population  with  reduced  kidney 
function. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In  general,  efficacy  for  a  beneficial  effect  on  renal  disease  progression  of  empagliflozin  has  been 
demonstrated,  although  it  is  not  recommended  to  initiate  treatment  in  a  population  with  a  eGFR  <  20 
ml/min/1.73m2, as reflected in the SmPC.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, the collection of safety data was streamlined; only pre-specified non-serious AEs 
and SAEs were collected. 
An exception was participants entered in Japanese sites, where all AEs (non-serious AEs and SAEs) were 
recorded.  Unless  stated  otherwise  the  AE  analyses  detailed  below  were  based  on  the  pre-specified  non-
serious AEs and SAEs. 
Safety  analyses  in  the  EMPA-KIDNEY  trial  followed  the  “treatment-emergent”  principle  and  included  all 
treated  participants  (TS).  Unless  otherwise  specified,  treatment  was  assigned  as  randomised  and  the 
analyses of AEs were based on the number of participants with AEs. AE analyses were restricted to “on-
treatment”  AEs,  defined  as  AEs  with  an  onset  date  between  the  first  trial  medication  intake  (i.e. 
randomisation) and 7 days after the last intake, unless otherwise stated. Exposure-adjusted AEs were also 
displayed as incidence rates per 100 patient years. 
Patient exposure 
Median  observation  time  up  to  the  end  of  the  follow-up  period  was  about  24  months  in  both  treatment 
groups, with 98% of participants observed for at least 1 year and 51% for at least 2 years.

Table 27.  Observational period up to the end of follow-up – RS 
Median  exposure  to  study  medication  was  about  22  months  in  both  treatment  groups,  with  91%  of 
participants treated for at least 1 year and 44% for at least 2 years.

Adverse events 
Overall safety profile 
Empagliflozin  and  placebo  groups  had  similar  frequencies  of  participants  with  reported  SAEs  and 
prespecified non-serious AEs. The frequency of participants reported with AEs leading to discontinuation of 
study  medication  was  also  similar  between  the  treatment  groups.  The  frequency  of  participants  with 
investigator-defined  drug-related  AEs  was  low.  The  frequency  of  participants  with  SAEs  overall  was 
comparable between groups. The frequency of participants with fatal AEs was similar in both groups.

Most frequently reported AEs 
The  frequencies  of  SAEs  in  each  SOC  were  similar  in  the  empagliflozin  and  placebo  groups.  The  most 
frequently  reported  AEs  were  in  the  SOC  metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders,  followed  by  infections  and 
infestations, investigations, and renal and urinary disorders. The most frequently reported PTs were gout, 
acute kidney injury, and coronavirus infection. Additional serious and prespecified non-serious AEs with PTs 
reported in >2% of participants in either treatment group included blood potassium increased, dehydration, 
and hypoglycaemia.

treatment group at the PT level) – TS 
Adverse events of special interest and specific adverse events 
AESIs (adverse events of special interest) and specific AEs that represent medical concepts were analysed. 
To capture all events related to a specific medical concept, a combination of applicable adjudication results, 
investigator-defined  events,  standardised  MedDRA  query  (SMQ),  BI-customised  MedDRA  query  (BIcMQ; 
when no SMQ was available), and/or additional definitions were used to analyse AESIs and specific AEs. 
The  overall  frequencies  for  liver  injury,  serious  urinary  tract  infection,  serious  genital  infection,  severe 
hypoglycaemia, and urinary tract malignancy were comparable in the empagliflozin and  placebo groups. 
Ketoacidosis  occurred  in  6  participants  in  the  empagliflozin  group  and  1  in  the  placebo  group  (0.10  and 
0.02 per 100 participants-years, respectively). Lower limb amputations occurred in 26 participants in the 
empagliflozin group and 14 in the placebo group (0.43 and 0.23 per 100 participant-years, respectively). 
Within the individual categories of AESIs and specific AEs, generally similar proportions of participants in 
both treatment groups had serious AEs. Few AEs in any category of AESIs or specific AEs led to treatment 
discontinuation.

•  Liver injury 
Similar frequencies were observed between groups for serious liver injury, and liver injury up to 30 days 
after treatment discontinuation. No relevant difference in the frequency of participants with liver injury was 
noted between treatment groups for subgroups by diabetes status.

Table 33.  Participants with liver injury (AESI, adjudicated) – TS 
The hazard ratio based on Cox regression for empagliflozin vs. placebo for time to first occurrence of an 
adjudicated  liver  injury  was  1.09  (95%  CI  0.50,  2.38)  (RS,  OC-AD).  The  frequency  of  participants  with 
elevated liver enzyme values was similar between treatment groups through the follow-up period including 
post-treatment events.

•  Ketoacidosis 
The rate of ketoacidosis (adjudicated) was low. The empagliflozin group had 6 participants with adjudicated 
events of ketoacidosis (narrow BIcMQ) overall, and by PTs including diabetic ketoacidosis and ketoacidosis, 
compared with one participant in the placebo group (0.10 vs. 0.02 per 100 patient-years, respectively). 
Table 35.  Participants with adverse events of ketoacidosis (AESI, adjudicated) – TS 
A  nondiabetic  female  participant  of  73  years  in  the  empagliflozin  group,  had  comorbidities  such  as  left 
ventricular heart failure, ischemic heart disease and Stage IV CKD. After significant weight loss and poor 
oral intake for a few days prior, the participant presented with vomiting and dehydration and was diagnosed 
with  AKI  and  ketoacidosis.  Hospitalisation  was  required,  study  treatment  was  interrupted,  and  the 
participant recovered. The event was adjudicated as confirmed ketoacidosis. 
The results regarding events of ketoacidosis analysed as specific AEs were the same as the results when 
analysed as AESIs, adjudicated. 
Due to the small number of participants with events, the hazard ratio based on Cox regression for time to 
first occurrence of an adjudicated AESI of ketoacidosis was not calculated. The analysis of the estimated 
cumulative incidence of time to first occurrence of an adjudicated AESI of ketoacidosis showed the onset 
was within the first year for participants in the empagliflozin group. 
•  Lower limb amputation 
Lower limb amputation (LLA) is summarised for EMPA-KIDNEY 1245-0137, and for a post-hoc meta-analysis 
of 4 large randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical outcome trials (EMPA-KIDNEY (1245-0137), 
EMPAREG-OUTCOME  (1245-0025),  EMPEROR-Preserved  (1245-0110)  and  EMPEROR-Reduced  (1245-
0121),) (pooled dataset SAF-M3). The main focus should be the analyses including data through the final 
follow up because these include all events; results for the ontreatment period are also provided. 
The frequency of participants with LLA (adjudicated) in the empagliflozin group and in the placebo group is 
provided  in  the  table  below.  In  both  groups,  the  most  commonly  reported  PT  was  toe  amputation.  The 
majority of events were reported in participants with diabetes.

Table 36.  Participants with an AE of lower limb amputation (AESI, adjudicated) – TS, 1245-0137 
In EMPA-KIDNEY, the hazard ratio based on Cox regression for empagliflozin vs. placebo for time to first 
occurrence of an adjudicated LLA was 1.43 (95% CI 0.80, 2.57) (RS, OC-AD). The estimated cumulative 
incidence of time to first occurrence of LLA (adjudicated) in the empagliflozin and placebo groups started 
to diverge shortly after randomisation and remained separated throughout the trial.

Figure 9.  Time to first occurrence of lower limb amputation (adjudicated) (user-defined) (all cause death 
as competing risk) − RS (OC−AD) 
The  post-hoc  meta-analysis  of  trials  EMPA-KIDNEY  (1245-0137),  EMPAREG-OUTCOME  (1245-0025), 
EMPEROR-Preserved (1245-0110) and EMPEROR-Reduced (1245-0121), included 23,340 randomised and 
treated participants. The median duration of exposure to study drug was 1.93 years overall, 2.02 years in 
the  all  empagliflozin  group,  and  1.82  years  in  the  placebo  group.  Total  exposure  was  25,823.7  patient-
years  in  the  all  empagliflozin  group  and  19,526.3  patient-years  in  the  placebo  group.  (The  difference  in 
exposure  was  due  to  the  additional  25  mg  empagliflozin  treatment  group  in  1245-0025).  The  median 
observation period was 2.22 years in the empagliflozin group and 2.11 years in the placebo group. 
The hazard ratio based on Cox regression for empagliflozin vs. placebo for time to first occurrence of LLA 
during treatment was 1.16 (95% CI 0.86, 1.57); study treatment interaction p-value 0.34. The figure below 
shows  the  time  to  first  LLA  and  the  competing  risk  of  time  to  all-cause  mortality,  whilst  on-treatment. 
Considering events until the last follow-up, the hazard ratio based on Cox regression for empagliflozin vs. 
placebo for time to first occurrence of LLA was 1.05 (95% CI 0.81, 1.36); study treatment interaction p-
value 0.38.

AEs potentially related to amputation, including cases not leading to amputation, were identified based on 
the list of PTs established by the EMA as an outcome of the Article 20 referral on LLA. The frequency of 
these event categories among participants in the 4 studies is shown in Table 36 through Table 40.

In Study EMPEROR-Reduced 1245.121, AEs related to diabetic foot were more frequently reported in the 
empagliflozin group. This is most probably a chance finding based on the very low frequency in the placebo 
group and the observation that, based on the KM analysis, no further event occurred on placebo after 1 
year  of  treatment,  which  has  no  plausible  medical  explanation.  Further,  there  is  no  plausible  medical 
explanation why empagliflozin would increase the risk of diabetic foot-related AEs only in participants with 
HFrEF. 
Table 42.  Participants with AEs of volume depletion1 – TS 
According to the MAH, no increased risk of LLA was seen in patients treated with empagliflozin. The data 
do not support that a common class-effect (e.g. dehydration) could explain the increased risk of LLA seen 
in  the  CANVAS  studies  with  canagliflozin.  No  additional  pharmacovigilance  activities  or  additional  risk 
minimisation measures are planned. In line with GVP Module V Rev 2, it is proposed: 
o  To demote this safety concern from the EU-RMP 
o  To further monitor this topic in the PBRER 
o  To no longer collect additional  information about cases of LLA  outside  clinical trials with  a  dedicated 
questionnaire 
o  To consider LLA no longer as AESI in new studies, with the need to collect additional information about 
these events 
•  Severe hypoglycaemia 
Similar  frequencies  of  participants  in  both  treatment  groups  were  observed  for  SAEs  of  severe 
hypoglycaemia.  Few  participants  in  either  group  had  severe  hypoglycaemic  events  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation. 
Four  non-diabetic  participants  in  the  empagliflozin  group  had  severe  hypoglycaemic  events;  one  of  the 
events was considered serious but not related to study treatment. In two cases, participants were taking 
concomitant  traditional  herbal  mixes  containing  cinnamon,  and  in  one  case  the  participant  was 
concomitantly on Valproic acid. All these medications are known to cause hypoglycemia. In the fourth case, 
the participant had concomitant gastric irritability and poor nutrition due to underlying H. pylori infection. 
No  relevant  difference  between  treatment  groups  was  observed  for  subgroups  based  on  baseline  eGFR 
category, or baseline UACR category. 
The number and seriousness of hypoglycaemic episodes was similar between groups; few hypoglycaemic 
episodes led to permanent treatment discontinuation in either treatment group.

•  Urinary tract infection 
The frequency of participants with an SAE of urinary tract infection (narrow sub-BIcMQ) between groups 
overall and by PT is provided in the table below. Few participants in either treatment group discontinued 
study treatment due to an SAE of urinary tract infection. No imbalances in the frequency of participants 
with an SAE of urinary tract infection were observed between treatment groups for subgroups based on sex 
or baseline diabetes status.

Table 44.  Participants with serious urinary tract infection (specific AE, narrow sub-BIcMQ) – TS 
Serious  urosepsis  (PT)  or  pyelonephritis  (narrow  sub  BIcMQ)  was  reported  for  10  participants  in  each 
treatment group. Serious urosepsis or pyelonephritis led to discontinuation of study treatment in none of 
the participants in the empagliflozin group and in four participants in the placebo group. 
The hazard ratio based on Cox regression for empagliflozin vs. placebo for time to first occurrence of an 
SAE  of  urinary  tract  infection  was  0.94  (95%  CI  0.64,  1.37)  (RS,  OC-AD).  The  estimated  cumulative 
incidence  of  time  to  first  occurrence  of  an  SAE  of  urinary  tract  infection  was  the  same  between  groups 
throughout the trial. 
•  Genital infection 
There was one adjudicated SAE of genital infection in the trial through the treatment period and 7 days 
after (residual effect period); an SAE of fungal genital infection was reported for a female participant in the 
empagliflozin group who also had T2DM. 
Through the final follow-up visit, one additional participant (male, in the placebo group) had an adjudicated 
SAE of genital infection. Due to just one participant per group with such an event, the hazard ratio based 
on Cox regression for time to first occurrence of an SAE of genital infection was not calculated (RS, OC-AD) 
and  the  analysis  of  the  estimated  cumulative  incidence  of  time  to  first  occurrence  of  an  SAE  of  genital 
infection was not informative. 
The  analyses  of  serious  genital  infection  (specific  AE)  (narrow  sub-BIcMQ)  were  consistent  with  the 
adjudicated results, with no meaningful imbalances observed between groups overall (0.1%, empagliflozin; 
0.1%, placebo). 
•  Bone fracture 
The frequency of participants with an AE of bone fracture (specific AE) is provided in the table below. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/304328/2023

Table 45.  Participants with bone fracture (specific AE) – TS 
Findings were similar when analysed as frequency of participants with bone fracture events (narrow BIcMQ) 
as  these  analyses  included  two  additional  participants  in  the  empagliflozin  group  with  events  of  bone 
fracture. 
The hazard ratio based on Cox regression for empagliflozin vs. placebo for time to first occurrence of an AE 
of bone fracture was 1.08 (95% CI 0.84, 1.38) (RS, OC-AD). The estimated cumulative incidence of time 
to first occurrence of an AE of bone fracture was similar between groups throughout the trial. 
•  Urinary tract malignancy 
The frequencies of participants with urinary tract malignancies (broad sub-BIcMQs) up to trial completion 
were  similar  between  treatment  groups,  with  19  participants  (0.6%)  in  the  empagliflozin  group  and  15 
participants (0.5%) in the placebo group. The frequencies of participants with urinary tract malignancies 
ontreatment were also similar between treatment groups, with 18 participants (0.5%) in the empagliflozin 
group and 13 participants (0.4%) in the placebo group. 
•  Volume depletion 
The frequency of participants with volume depletion (narrow sub-BIcMQ) compared with placebo is provided 
in  the  table  below.  In  both  treatment  groups  the  most  frequently  reported  PT  was  dehydration.  The 
treatment  groups  were  similar  in  the  frequencies  of  participants  with  serious  volume  depletion  and  few 
participants  in  either  group  discontinued  study  treatment  due  to  volume  depletion.  Subgroup  analyses 
showed higher frequencies of volume depletion events among participants with diabetes, and those using 
RAS inhibitors or diuretics. 
The frequency of participants with hypotension (narrow sub-BIcMQ) was similar between treatment groups. 
The  treatment  groups  were  balanced  in  the  frequencies  of  participants  with  serious  hypotension.  One 
participant in each treatment group discontinued study treatment due to hypotension. 
The frequency of participants with symptomatic dehydration between groups (symptomatic dehydration, 
user-defined) is provided in the table below. One participant in the empagliflozin group and no participants 
in the placebo group discontinued study treatment due to symptomatic dehydration.

Table 46.  Participants with volume depletion (specific AE) – TS 
The  hazard  ratio  based  on  Cox  regression  for  empagliflozin  participants  vs.  placebo  for  time  to  first 
occurrence of a (user-defined) dehydration SAE was 1.25 (95% CI 0.73, 2.14) (RS, OC-AD). 
The  hazard  ratio  based  on  Cox  regression  for  empagliflozin  participants  vs.  placebo  for  time  to  first 
occurrence of a symptomatic dehydration (user-defined) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.81, 1.51) (RS, OC-AD). The 
estimated cumulative incidence of time to first occurrence of a symptomatic dehydration (user-defined) in 
the empagliflozin and placebo groups started to diverge at randomisation but was similar after two years. 
•  Acute kidney injury 
The frequency of participants with serious acute kidney injury (adjudicated) is provided in the table below. 
In  both  treatment  groups,  the  most  common  cause  of  serious  acute  kidney  injury  was  pre-renal 
haemodynamic.  The  stages  of  serious  acute  kidney  injury  were  similar  between  treatment  groups.  The 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/304328/2023

frequency  of  participants  with  serious  acute  kidney  injury  was  generally  lower  for  participants  in  the 
empagliflozin group across subgroups. 
Table 47.  Participants with serious acute kidney injury (other adjudicated event) – TS 
Results were the same for the analyses of participants with serious acute kidney injury (specific AE). 
The hazard ratio based on Cox regression for empagliflozin vs. placebo for time to first occurrence of an 
SAE  of  acute  kidney  injury  (adjudicated)  was  0.78  (95%  CI  0.60,  1.00)  (RS,  OC-AD).  The  estimated 
cumulative incidence of time to first occurrence of an SAE of kidney injury (adjudicated) in the empagliflozin 
and placebo groups started to diverge shortly before one year after randomisation and remained separated 
throughout the trial.

The  frequency  of  participants  with  gout,  SAE(s)  of  gout,  and  gout  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study 
treatment is provided in the table below 
Table 48.  Participants with gout – TS 
•  Hyperkalaemia 
The frequency of participants with serious hyperkalaemia is provided in the table below. 
Hyperkalaemia  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  medication  was  reported  for  two  participants  in  each 
treatment group. 
Table 49.  Participants with serious hyperkalaemia – TS 
The hazard ratio based on Cox regression for empagliflozin vs. placebo for time to first occurrence of an 
SAE of hyperkalaemia was 0.83 (95% CI 0.63, 1.09) (RS, OC-AD). The estimated cumulative incidence of 
time  to  first  occurrence  of  an  SAE  of  hyperkalaemia  started  to  diverge  at  randomisation  and  remained 
separated throughout the trial. 
Potassium (mmol/L) change from baseline over time MMRM results showed the treatment groups diverged 
shortly after randomisation and remained separated throughout the trial.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The  overall  frequency  of  participants  with  SAEs  was  comparable  between  treatment  groups.  SAEs  were 
most frequently reported in the SOCs renal and urinary disorders, and in infections and infestations. The 
most common PTs were acute kidney injury and coronavirus infection. The most commonly reported SAEs 
(PTs  reported  in  >1%  of  participants  in  either  group)  are  summarised  in  the  table  below.  No  relevant 
difference between treatment groups was observed in the frequency of participants with SAEs assessed by 
the investigator as drug-related. 
Table 50.  Participants with SAEs (frequency >1% in either treatment group at the PT level) – TS 
Deaths 
Fatal AEs on treatment were reported for 3.8% of participants in the empagliflozin group (event rate 2.09 
per  100  participant  years)  and  4.1%  of  participants  in  the  placebo  group  (event  rate  2.25  per  100 
participant years). Fatal AEs up to the final follow-up visit were reported for 4.5% of participants in  the 
empagliflozin group (event rate 2.28 per 100 participant years)  and 5.1% of participants in the placebo 
group (event rate 2.61 per 100 participant years).

Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory values measured within 3 days after discontinuation of study medication were considered 
as ‘on-treatment’. 
Elevations in local laboratory measures of ALT and AST as trial-specific safety endpoints are summarised 
together with liver injury AEs. Results of potassium at each scheduled visit during the follow-up as a trial-
specific safety endpoint are summarised together with hyperkalaemia AEs. 
This section summarises the results of haematocrit, haemoglobin, sodium, corrected calcium and phosphate 
at 18 months in the subset of UK participants (trial-specific safety endpoint) as well as the standard analyses 
of  laboratory  parameters.  Changes  from  baseline  to  18  months  in  haematocrit  and  haemoglobin  were 
compared between the treatments using ANCOVA with baseline fitted as a covariate. Mean values at 18 
months  for  sodium,  corrected  calcium,  and  phosphate  were  compared  between  the  treatments  using  t-
tests, as baseline assessments were not taken. 
Haematology 
Haemoglobin and haematocrit levels at Month 18 were higher in the empagliflozin group than the placebo 
group in UK participants. Both parameters showed an increase compared with baseline in the empagliflozin 
group  and  a  decrease  in  the  placebo  group  (see  table  below).  The  percentage  of  UK  participants  with 
‘possibly clinically significant abnormalities’ for high values was 1.8% in the empagliflozin group and 0.5% 
in the placebo group for haemoglobin and 1.3% in the empagliflozin group and 0.5% in the placebo group 
for haematocrit.

Other parameters 
Mean  ALT  at  the  last  value  on  treatment  was  22.3  U/L  in  the  empagliflozin  group  and  21.6  U/L  in  the 
placebo group. Mean AST at the last value on treatment was 25.8 U/L in the empagliflozin group and 24.0 
U/L in the placebo group. Similar percentages of participants in both treatment groups had shifts from a 
normal value at baseline to a value below or above normal at the last value on treatment for ALT, AST, 
alkaline  phosphatase,  and  total  bilirubin  (data  not  shown).  The  analysis  of  ALT  and  AST  elevations  by 
categories is presented as part of the assessment of liver injury.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The  overall  frequency  of  participants  reported  with  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  medication 
between treatment groups is provided in the table below. On the PT level, the most frequently reported 
AEs leading to discontinuation were coronavirus infection and sudden cardiac death. The most commonly 
reported AEs leading to discontinuation of study medication (>0.2%) in either treatment group at the PT 
level) are summarised in Table 57.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
An extensive number of patients have been included in this trial; 3304 patients treated with empagliflozin 
and 3305 with placebo, respectively, with a median exposure of 22 months and 91% treated for at least 1 
year and 44% at least 2 years.  
The overall safety profile appears reassuring and showed a slightly lower number of AEs for empagliflozin 
vs placebo (44% vs 46%), SAEs (33% vs 35%) and AEs leading to death (2.7% vs 2.8%) and appears to 
be  well-tolerated  with  a  lower  rate  of  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  (7.0%  vs  7.3%,  mostly  attributed  to 
cardiac disorders (0.7% vs 1.0%) and coronavirus infection (0.5% vs 0.6%)). Moreover, no SAE according 
to  SOC  or  single  type  of  event  was  reported  to  be  increased  for  empagliflozin  vs  placebo.  Similarly,  no 
specific AE category could be identified with increased AEs leading to death for empagliflozin. Further, the 
most  frequently  reported  AEs  were  gout  (7.0%  vs  8.0%),  acute  kidney  injury  (2.8%  vs  3.5%)  and 
coronavirus infection (3.0% vs 3.2%) and did not reveal any new pattern in comparison to previous findings 
(in different populations). An overall presentation of the safety profile according to diabetes status did not 
reveal on any difference between both groups. 
For  several  AEs  of  special  interest  due  to  the  known  safety  profile  of  empagliflozin  or  (potential)  safety 
issues as included in the RMP, including gout (8.2% vs 9.2%, 4.75 vs 5.35/100pt-yrs), serious hyperkalemia 
(2.6% vs 2.9%, 1.42 vs 1.62/100 pt-yrs), adjudicated liver injury (0.4% each, 0.22 vs 0.20/100pt-yrs), 
and  serious  urinary  tract  infections  (1.3%  vs  1.4%,  0.70  vs  0.78/100  pt-yrs)  the  event  rates  were 
comparable or lower for empagliflozin vs placebo, and do not raise for any safety concern.  
Adjudicated cases of lower limb amputations (LLA) were slightly higher for empagliflozin (0.8% (n=26) vs 
0.4% (n=14), 0.43 vs 0.23/100 pt-yrs), mainly occurred in patients with diabetes (1.5% (n=23) vs 1.1% 
(n=17; data of up-to-final follow-up) vs non-diabetes (0.15% (n=5) vs 0.06% (n=2; data of up-to-final 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

follow-up) and was mainly seen for toe amputation (0.5% vs 0.4%, 0.30 vs 0.22/100 pt-yrs). Based on 
Cox-regression  analyses,  only  a  numerical  increase  could  be  observed  of  HR  1.43  (0.80,  2.57).  When  4 
major trials were combined, the HR was also numerically increased with an HR 1.16 (0.86, 1.57), and a HR 
of  1.14  (0.84,  1.56)  for  the  diabetic  population.  Any  AEs  potentially  related  to  LLA  were  not  consistent 
across the studies, which complicates the interpretation of these findings. A warning statement currently 
included in the SmPC shows that this has been observed with another SGLT-2 inhibitor but that it is not 
known whether it is a class effect. Based on the current data, no stronger conclusions can be drawn, and 
this is thus acceptable.  
Volume depletion (3.0% vs 2.7%, 1.64 vs 1.51/100 pt-yrs) and symptomatic dehydration (2.4% vs 2.1%, 
1.34 vs 1.17 100/pt-yrs) was slightly increased, although hypotension was seen at similar frequency (0.7% 
each).  
Severe hypoglycemic events were comparable between treatment groups (2.2% each, 1.24 vs 1.21/100 
pt-yrs),  although  4  cases  were  observed  in  non-diabetic  patients  treated  with  empagliflozin  (vs  0  in 
placebo).  The  relationship  to  empagliflozin  remains  unclear,  as 
for  these  cases  alternative 
confounders/explanations appear available. 
Adjudicated cases of ketoacidosis occurred at a low frequency but increased for empagliflozin (6 (0.2%) vs 
1  (<0.1%).  Of  these,  one  case  of  non-diabetic  ketoacidosis  occurred,  which  has  not  previously  been 
described and associated to the use of empagliflozin (or any other SGLT-2 inhibitor). This concerned a 73 
year-old woman with comorbidities of HF, CAD and CKD stage IV, who needed hospitalisation for AKI and 
ketoacidosis, and recovered after treatment discontinuation. Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC are amended 
to include appropriate warnings accordingly. 
In the current trial, these were slightly increased using different definitions of using user-defined (3.7% vs 
3.2%, 2.04 vs 1.78/100 pt-yrs) and narrow BIcMQ definition up to trial completion (4.1% vs 3.7%, 2.06 
vs 1.86/100 pt/yrs). The Cox-regression analysis did not reveal a higher incidence for empagliflozin (HR 
1.08 (95% CI 0.84, 1.38)). The MAH did not present the data according to diabetes status.  
Urinary  tract  malignancies  up  to  trial  completion  were  low  and  comparable  for  empagliflozin  vs  placebo 
(0.6% vs 0.5%, 0.28 vs 0.22/100pt-yrs), and do not reveal any signal.  
Adjudicated cases of serious genital infection occurred in only 1 case in the empagliflozin group. This does 
not allow for any clear conclusions, but it has already been included as ADR in the labelling.  
As showed in a trial subset of UK participants (437 vs 374), haemoglobin and haematocrit were increased 
for  empagliflozin  vs  placebo  (clinically  significant  abnormalities  1.8%  vs  0.5%  and  1.3%  vs  0.5%, 
respectively).  Haematocrit  increase  is  already  a  known  reversible  effect  of  empagliflozin  as  already 
described  in  the  product  information.  No  differences  of  sodium-corrected  calcium  or  phosphate  were 
observed between treatment groups in this study subset. 
No clear pattern for a different safety profile of empagliflozin vs placebo was observed according to age 
category (< 50, 50-65, 65-75, >75), except that the frequency of AEs was increased with increasing age. 
No clear pattern for a different safety profile of empagliflozin vs placebo was observed according to GFR 
category  (<  20,  20-30,  30-45,  >45),  except  that  the  frequency  of  AEs  was  increased  with  lower  GFR 
category. No pattern of a different safety profile according to UACR category could be observed. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The pivotal trial provided as part of this application showed a safety profile that appears reassuring and 
showed that empagliflozin appears to be well tolerated also in a population at reduced renal function. In 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

general, the safety profile was as expected, except that one case of ketoacidosis was observed in a non-
diabetic patient, which had not previously been observed for empagliflozin.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/304328/2023 
Page 77/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The  package  leaflet  for  Jardiance  was  subject  to  a  readability  user  testing  with  the  initial  marketing 
authorization  application.  Further,  with  the  indication  extension  for  heart  failure  with  reduced  ejection 
fraction (EMEA/H/C/002677/II/0055) a readablity user test was conducted. In the final report of February 
2021, the package leaflet was rated readable and comprehensive. No further improvement was deemed 
necessary  per  this  recent  report.  During  procedure  EMEA/H/C/002677/II/0055,  the  package  leaflet  was 
updated  based  on  CHMP’s  request  to  ensure  patient’s  understanding  in  the  contexts  of  the  side  effect 
‘diabetic ketoacidosis’. With this proposed indication extension, the update of the package leaflet will only 
concern sections 1. ‘What Jardiance is used for’ and ‘What is chronic kidney disease?’ as well ‘4. Possible 
side effects’. The design and layout of the printed package leaflet will not change. Given that a readability 
user test was only conducted recently and that changes to be introduced with the new indication chronic 
kidney disease are only very limited in extent,  it is considered justified to not consult with target patient 
groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly recognized as a global public health problem affecting 10-
15% of the population worldwide. Chronic kidney disease results from a variety of causes, such as 
diabetes, hypertension, vascular disease, or glomerulonephritis. CKD is associated with excess risk for 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cardiovascular events are the most frequent cause of death in patients 
with CKD. In addition, high levels of albuminuria are associated with an increased risk of all-cause and 
cardiovascular mortality. 
CKD is associated with impaired quality of life and substantially reduced life expectancy at all ages. End-
stage renal disease (ESRD) is the most severe form of CKD and is fatal if not treated by renal 
replacement therapy. Although patients with early CKD are more likely to die before they reach ESRD, the 
avoidance of ESRD is still highly desirable due to its negative impact on quality of life and the substantial 
costs of dialysis and transplantation to healthcare providers. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The standard of care for CKD in patients with and without diabetes is represented by blood pressure 
control and reduction of proteinuria through RAAS blockade (ACE-I or ARB) combined with CV risk 
management and/or and glycaemic control as necessary. 
Although RAAS blockade has been shown to reduce albuminuria and slow the rate of progression in 
proteinuric nephropathies, particularly in diabetic kidney disease, a substantial residual risk of ESRD 
remains. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for new treatment options that can be added safely 
to current standard treatments in CKD, with a primary aim of slowing the progression of CKD and 
reducing risk of CV death. Although, currently another SGLT2i, dapagliflozin, has already been indicated 
to be used in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with CKD based on the results of the DAPA-CKD study 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/304328/2023 
Page 78/85 
 
 
 
 
(and additional evidence from other dapagliflozin studies) including a slightly more restricted population 
of patients with eGFR 25 to 90 ml/min/1.73m2 and albuminuria > 200 mg/g compared to current EMPA-
KIDNEY inclusion. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The EMPA-KIDNEY (trial 1245.137) was a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group 
event-driven study to demonstrate superiority in slowing renal disease progression of empagliflozin 10 
mg vs. placebo on top of guideline-directed medical therapy (including appropriate RASi background 
therapy) in a (broad) population generally at risk of kidney disease progression both with and without 
diabetes. 
The study population was included based on either eGFR ≥20 <45 mL/min/1.73m2, or an eGFR ≥45 
mL/min/1.73m2 with urinary albumin/creatinine ratio ≥200 mg/g (or protein/creatinine ratio≥300 mg/g). 
This does not include the entire CKD population as patients with eGFR 45 to 60 (and 60 to 90) 
ml/min/1.73m2 without albuminuria has not been included, likely due to a lower risk for renal disease 
progression and possibly relatively increased risk for CV events (depending on CV disease history). 
The study was designed to test whether empagliflozin was superior to placebo for the primary endpoint of 
a composite of time to the first occurrence of kidney disease progression (defined as end-stage kidney 
disease [ESKD], a sustained decline in eGFR to <10 mL/min/1.73 m2, ‘as adjudicated’ renal death, or a 
sustained decline of ≥40% in eGFR from randomisation); or CV death (‘as adjudicated’). Secondary 
endpoints that were tested using the Hochberg procedure were all-cause mortality, time to the first 
occurrence of HHF (‘as adjudicated’) or CV death (‘as adjudicated’), and all-cause hospitalisations (first 
and recurrent combined). 
This event-driven study was designed to have a power of 90% for the primary endpoint at a 2-sided α of 
0.05 to detect an 18% relative reduction in the primary outcome, which required approximately 1070 
primary outcome events. 
The EMPA-KIDNEY trial was carried out at 241 clinical sites in 8 countries in North America, Europe, and 
Asia (United States, Canada, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, China, Malaysia, and Japan). The trial 
included 6609 patients (3304 empagliflozin vs 3305 placebo). Baseline data were well balanced between 
the treatment groups. The majority of subjects were elderly (55% > 65 years) white male subjects 
(67%) with a mean eGFR of 37 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 52% having macro-albuminuria (>300 mg/g), and 
54% being non-diabetic, representing a patient population at high risk of disease progression. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Empagliflozin showed a significant superior effect for the primary endpoint of time to the first event of 
kidney disease progression or adjudicated CV death (432 (13.1%) vs 448 (16.9%); HR 0.72 (0.64, 0.82), 
p<0.001, which became evident after approximately 1 year of treatment. The primary endpoint was 
mainly driven by the eGFR reduction ≥40% surrogate (293 (8.9%) vs 373 (11.3%)), although every 
component demonstrated a lower number of events for empagliflozin during the study period. 
Consistency in all sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of the primary finding. Also, secondary and 
exploratory renal (composite) endpoints supported the major finding, including endpoints of time to first 
occurrence of kidney disease progression, time to different renal outcome definitions, a slower rate in 
eGFR change (slope), and slower annual rate for total slope and chronic slope. Further, the positive renal 
findings occurred before any CV effects emerged, with non-significant findings in overall mortality, CV 
mortality, CV endpoints (major CV events, time to HHF), and renal components driving the significance of 
any other combined renal/CV endpoints (time to CV death or ESKD). From a mechanistic point of view

and as previously observed, the initial drop in eGFR and greater reduction in UACR with empagliflozin are 
of further support. 
The primary result was consistent across the key subgroup of baseline eGFR. In non-diabetic patients, the 
primary effect was slightly less apparent (HR 0.82 (0.68, 0.99) vs diabetic (HR 0.64 (0.54, 0.77), 
although the p-value for interaction did not reach significance (0.0598) and it should be noted that in 
both subpopulations a significant effect was observed. For albuminuria, a trend toward lower efficacy with 
lower albuminuria could be observed (p=0.0174), while no significant p-value for interaction was 
observed for UACR < vs ≥200 mg/g (HR 0.87 (0.66, 1.15) and 0.71 (0.62, 0.82), respectively (interaction 
p-value = 0.2090)). 
A significant finding of a lower proportion of patients with the occurrence of all-cause hospitalisations (key 
secondary endpoint) was found, which may reflect the risk of disease burden and mortality. Further, a 
separation between renal and cardiovascular causes has been provided and show consistent beneficial 
effects. 
A minor difference in reduction in HbA1c (-0.4 %) was observed. This may be expected, as the glucose-
lowering effect of empagliflozin is eGFR dependent, thereby low in this population with reduced kidney 
function. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
For albuminuria, a trend toward lower efficacy with lower albuminuria could be observed (p=0.0174), 
while no significant p-value for interaction was observed for UACR < vs ≥200 mg/g (HR 0.87 (0.66, 1.15) 
and 0.71 (0.62, 0.82), respectively (interaction p-value = 0.2090)). In particular, in the normal to micro-
albuminuria groups, absence or very limited efficacy appears to be present. A statement reflecting these 
findings is included in the SmPC.  
A CKD population of patients with eGFR <20 ml/min/1.73m2 has been scarcely evaluated in the current 
study, while such patients were initially covered by the proposed extension of indication and dose 
recommendation. Therefore, initiating treatment in these patients would not be recommended. A 
statement reflecting treatment in this population is included in the SmPC. 
A similar reduction of the primary composite endpoint in the empagliflozin group was seen independent of 
the aetiology of kidney disease, although patients with polycystic nephropathy and those receiving 
immunosuppressive medication were excluded (except prednisolone ≤10 mg or equivalent) .  
Although the renal findings appear convincing (see favourable effects), a slightly larger decrease in body-
weight (-1.6 kg vs -0.7 kg already at month 6 and approximately -2.7 kg vs -1.7 kg at 36 months) was 
observed compared to placebo. However, this was not caused by a decrease in muscle mass.  
In general, demographics were well-balanced between the treatment groups in the trial. The majority of 
subjects was elderly (55% > 65 years) white male subjects (67%), with a sufficient proportion of patients 
have been included in Europe (40.1%). However, Black or African American patients may be considered 
underrepresented (4.0%).  
Inclusion of patients without standard of therapy of RASi are limited in line with the inclusion criteria, but 
show comparable results on the primary endpoint. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
An extensive number of patients have been included in this trial; 3304 treated with empagliflozin and 
3305 with placebo, respectively, with a median exposure of 22 months and 91% treated for at least 1 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/304328/2023 
Page 80/85 
 
 
 
 
year and 44% at least 2 years. Importantly, additional exposure to patients with lower eGFR has now 
emerged, who were previously generally excluded based on the current SmPC recommendation (lower 
glucose-lowering efficacy), except for heart failure patients (≥ 20 ml/min/1.73 m2). 
The overall safety profile appears reassuring and showed a slightly lower number of AEs for empagliflozin 
vs placebo (44% vs 46%), SAEs (33% vs 35%) and AEs leading to death (2.7% vs 2.8%) and appears to 
be well tolerated with a lower rate of discontinuations due to AEs (7.0% vs 7.3%, mostly attributed to 
cardiac disorders (0.7% vs 1.0%) and coronavirus infection (0.5% vs 0.6%)). Moreover, no SAE 
according to SOC or single type of event was reported to be increased for empagliflozin vs placebo. 
Similarly, no specific AE category could be identified with increased AEs leading to death for 
empagliflozin. 
Most frequently reported AEs were gout (7.0% vs 8.0%), acute kidney injury (2.8% vs 3.5%) and 
coronavirus infection (3.0% vs 3.2%) and did not reveal any new pattern in comparison to previous trial 
findings. 
No clear pattern for a different safety profile of empagliflozin vs placebo was observed according to GFR 
category (< 20, 20-30, 30-45, >45), except that the frequency of AEs was increased with lower GFR 
category as expected. No pattern of a different safety profile according to UACR category could be 
observed. 
For several AEs of special interest due to the known safety profile of empagliflozin or potential safety 
issues as included in the RMP, including gout (8.2% vs 9.2%, 4.75 vs 5.35/100pt-yrs), serious 
hyperkalemia (2.6% vs 2.9%, 1.42 vs 1.62/100 pt-yrs), adjudicated liver injury (0.4% each, 0.22 vs 
0.20/100pt-yrs), and serious urinary tract infections (1.3% vs 1.4%, 0.70 vs 0.78/100 pt-yrs) the event 
rates were comparable or lower for empagliflozin vs placebo, and do not raise for any safety concern. 
Further, urinary tract malignancies up to trial completion were low and comparable for empagliflozin vs 
placebo (0.6% vs 0.5%, 0.28 vs 0.22/100pt-yrs), and do not reveal any signal. 
Adjudicated cases of ketoacidosis occurred at a low frequency but were increased for empagliflozin (6 
(0.2%) vs 1 (<0.1%)). Of these, one case of non-diabetic ketoacidosis occurred, which has not previously 
been described and associated to the use of empagliflozin (or any other SGLT-2 inhibitor). This concerned 
a 73 year-old women with comorbidities of HF, CAD and CKD stage IV, who needed hospitalisation for AKI 
and ketoacidosis, and recovered after treatment discontinuation. Appropriate warnings have been added 
accordingly in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.  
As based on a trial subset of UK participants (437 vs 374), haemoglobin and haematocrit were increased 
for empagliflozin vs placebo (clinical significant abnormalities 1.8% vs 0.5% and 1.3% vs 0.5%, 
respectively). Haematocrit increase is already a known reversible effect of empagliflozin as already 
described in the labelling. No differences of sodium, corrected calcium or phosphate was observed 
between treatment groups in this study subset. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Adjudicated cases of lower limb amputations (LLA) were slightly higher for empagliflozin (0.8% (n=26) vs 
0.4% (n=14), 0.43 vs 0.23/100 pt-yrs), mainly occurred in patients with diabetes (1.5% (n=23) vs 1.1% 
(n=17; data of up-to-final follow-up) vs non-diabetes (0.15% (n=5) vs 0.06% (n=2; data of up-to-final 
follow-up) and was mainly seen for toe amputation (0.5% vs 0.4%, 0.30 vs 0.22/100 pt-yrs). Based on 
Cox-regression analyses, only a numerical increase could be observed of HR 1.43 (0.80, 2.57). When 4 
major trials were combined, the HR was also numerically increased with HR 1.16 (0.86, 1.57), and a HR 
of 1.14 (0.84, 1.56) for the diabetic population. Any AEs potentially related to LLA were not consistent 
across the studies, which complicates the interpretation of these findings. A warning statement in this 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

regard is already included in the SmPC to highlight that this has been observed with another SGLT-2 
inhibitor, although it is not known whether it can be considered a class effect. Based on the current data, 
no stronger conclusions can be drawn, and this is thus acceptable.  
Volume depletion (3.0% vs 2.7%, 1.64 vs 1.51/100 pt-yrs) and symptomatic dehydration (2.4% vs 
2.1%, 1.34 vs 1.17 100/pt-yrs) were slightly increased, although hypotension was seen at similar 
frequency (0.7% each).  
Severe hypoglycemic events were comparable between treatment groups (2.2% each, 1.24 vs 1.21/100 
pt-yrs), although 4 cases were observed in non-diabetic patients treated with empagliflozin (vs 0 in 
placebo). The relationship to empagliflozin remains unclear, as for these cases alternative 
confounders/explanations appear available. 
In the current trial, these were slightly increased using different definitions of using user-defined (3.7% 
vs 3.2%, 2.04 vs 1.78/100 pt-yrs) and narrow BIcMQ definition up to trial completion (4.1% vs 3.7%, 
2.06 vs 1.86/100 pt/yrs). The Cox-regression analysis did not reveal a higher incidence of empagliflozin 
(HR 1.08 (95% CI 0.84, 1.38)).  
Adjudicated cases of serious genital infection occurred in only 1 case in the empagliflozin group. This does 
not allow for any clear conclusions, but it has already been included as an  ADR in the product 
information. 
No clear pattern for a different safety profile of empagliflozin vs placebo was observed according to age 
category (< 50, 50-65, 65-75, >75, >85), except that the frequency of AEs was increased with increasing 
age.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
CKD is a serious and progressive condition that is associated with CV disease and an increased risk of 
adverse outcomes. The most common cause of CKD is diabetes. Despite cornerstone therapy of RAAS 
inhibition with either ARBs or ACEi, patients with CKD, including those with diabetes, remain at high risk 
of developing ESRD and/or experiencing CV events. 
Although some trends toward renal benefit have previously been observed in other studies with 
empagliflozin, the current dedicated renal study has demonstrated a renal benefit both in diabetes 
(T2DM) patients and non-diabetes patients. The latter observation is important as this provides a reason 
to make this explicit in the indication, as the currently authorised indication is focused on the beneficial 
effects in the diabetes population (except for HF). This would follow a similar approach as for the HF 
population (a specific indication granted), also including non-diabetics in the HF trials performed and be 
aligned with  another SGLT-2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin), where a specific renal indication has been adopted 
based on results in a dedicated renal study in a population including DM and non-DM CKD patients. 
However, there was a CHMP discussion during the procedure about whether extrapolation to the entire 
CKD population was indeed justified (see further below). 
The primary effect in the EMPA-KIDNEY study was observed even at the lower range of the GFR spectrum 
and without any signal for increased risk of acute kidney injury despite an initial drop in eGFR at start of 
treatment, thus supporting treatment even in patients with very low renal reserve (GFR >20 
ml/min/1.73m2), which is even slightly lower than evaluated with dapagliflozin (> 25 ml/min/1.73m2). 
Although, it could be questioned whether the current data generated by the EMPA-KIDNEY study would 
sufficiently justify treatment across the full range of the CKD population as proposed in the current 
application, additional justification has been provided by the Applicant during the procedure. Based on 
studies previously submitted showing benefits in less advanced CKD patients, a meta-analyses of SGLT2i 
and extrapolation of data from a mechanistic point of view, such broad range seems reasonable and can 
be accepted. However, initiation of empagliflozin in the very low eGFR range of <20 ml/min/1.73m2, is 
not supported due to absence of data and possible safety issues., and thus the product information has 
been updated accordingly.  The approach to accept the broad indication of ”treatment of CKD patients” 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

and to reflect any limitations of the available evidence in the SmPC, is in line with the product information 
of dapagliflozin.   
Generally, the safety profile can be considered reassuring, and empagliflozin appears to be well tolerated 
with no evidence of increased discontinuation due to AEs. As mentioned, even in the lower eGFR range, 
the safety profile is reassuring, although obviously more adverse events occur in general in patients with 
lower GFR, without any clear signal for safety concerns. 
Specific attention has been given to potential adverse effects associated with empagliflozin or based on 
previous safety findings in other populations with empagliflozin. Most remarkable is the finding of one 
case of ketoacidosis in a non-diabetic patient, which has not been observed previously and appropriate 
warnings have been included in the product information  as this may typically not be anticipated in clinical 
practice. Further, the risk of lower limb amputation remains inconclusive based on current and previous 
studies' combined risk estimation. Overall, the proposal to remove this potential safety risk from the RMP 
can be endorsed since the two studies required to address this important potential risk have been 
completed and there is no reasonable expectation that any further pharmacovigilance activity can further 
characterise this risk to draw firm conclusions. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Current positive findings on the primary renal effects in a general CKD population (including non-diabetic 
patients) at risk of disease progression are clinically relevant, although the effect was mainly driven by 
the eGFR reduction ≥40% surrogate. No unexpected safety concern arises from the current trial, except 
the fact that ketoacidosis could also occur in non-diabetic patients and the risk of LLA remains somewhat 
undetermined. However, the initiation of empaglifozin treatment in patients with CKD including those with 
eGFR < 20 ml/min/1.73m2 is not recommended, which is appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Jardiance in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease in adults is positive.

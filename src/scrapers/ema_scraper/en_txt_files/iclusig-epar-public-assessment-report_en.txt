2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder representing about 15% to 20% 
of adult leukaemias (Deininger et al, 2000; Pinilla-Ibarz et al, 2008). The underlying cause of CML is the 
BCR-ABL fusion oncoprotein, which results from a reciprocal t (9; 22) chromosomal translocation in 
hematopoietic stem cells. This chromosomal abnormality, known as the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+), 
is present in about 95% of all patients with CML, as well as about 20% to 25% of adult patients with acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The translocation leads to the fusion of the Breakpoint Cluster Region 
(BCR) coding sequence with the tyrosine kinase coding region of ABL. This fusion event results in the 
constitutive activation of ABL kinase activity. BCR-ABL activates multiple downstream pathways that 
contribute to the growth and survival of cells (Hazlehurst et al, 2009). 
Chronic myeloid leukaemia is typically a triphasic continuum of disease with a chronic phase (CP-CML), 
accelerated phase (AP-CML), and blast phase (BP-CML)—characteristics of the disease and prognosis are 
different for each phase. Chronic is the longest phase, and can last over 10 years in some patients 
(Padmanabhan et al, 2008). However, if transition to AP-CML occurs, median survival is typically limited 
to under a year, while patients in BP-CML (which resembles acute leukaemia) usually live for only a few 
months. Most patients are diagnosed in CP-CML and may be asymptomatic or present with fatigue, 
anaemia, weight loss, night sweats, or splenomegaly. 
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a malignant proliferation of lymphoid cells. The majority of cases 
of ALL show chromosomal and genetic abnormalities, and approximately 25% of adult cases of ALL are 
Ph+. The presence of the BCR-ABL translocation confers an adverse prognosis (Radich, 2001).  
Current treatment guidelines (European LeukemiaNet and National Comprehensive Cancer Network) 
recommend treatment with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs). In Europe the following TKIs are currently 
approved for the treatment of CML and Ph+ ALL: Glivec (imatinib); Sprycel (dasatinib); and Tasigna 
(nilotinib).  
Treatment for CML was significantly advanced in 2001 following the approval of imatinib. Since then, 
targeted therapy with imatinib in newly diagnosed patients has become standard. With imatinib the 
complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rate was reported as 76% (O’Brien et al., 2003). Dasatinib and 
nilotinib have also been approved for the treatment of patients who are or become resistant to imatinib 
therapy. These drugs yield complete cytogenetic response rates (CCyR) from 30%-50% (Talpaz et al., 
2006; Kantarjian et al., 2006). Resistance to TKI therapy continues to be a significant challenge in the 
Iclusig 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220290/2013 
Page 9/100 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment of CML. At present, there is no standard approach to treat the CML patient who has been 
treated unsuccessfully with both imatinib and then either with dasatinib or nilotinib. 
The best understood mechanism of resistance to TKI therapy is the development of point mutations in the 
BCR-ABL kinase domain. More than 100 different mutations in the kinase domain of ABL have been 
discovered and have been shown to be responsible for 40% to 50% of the resistance to existing TKIs 
(Jabbour et al., 2009). The detection of kinase domain mutations even early in disease is adversely 
prognostic (Khorashad et al., 2008), is higher in accelerated phase (AP)/blast phase (BP) compared with 
chronic phase (CP) and increases with the duration of disease (Quintas-Cardama & Cortes, 2008). For 
patients who fail imatinib therapy, the frequency of BCR-ABL mutations ranges from 40% to 90%, 
depending on the phase and method of detection (Quintas-Cardama & Cortes, 2008). 
The most common single resistant mutation, which occurs in approximately 15% of patients who develop 
resistance to imatinib (Quintas-Cardama & Cortes, 2008), is a transition point mutation at position 944 of 
the BCR-ABL gene, resulting in a substitution of isoleucine (I) for threonine (T) at position 315 of the 
protein: designated T315I, a “gatekeeper” mutation. The T315I mutation accounts for 15%-20% of all 
mutations observed in refractory CML (Nicolini et al, 2009).  
Although dasatinib is effective against some mutations that confer resistance to imatinib therapy, and 
nilotinib also treats some imatinib-induced mutations, no approved drug inhibits T315I mutation. 
However, not all patients who fail therapy carry detectable resistance mutations. Mutations are 
undetectable in a substantial proportion of patients who fail imatinib. In many of these patients, non BCR 
ABL driven mechanisms of resistance are likely contributing to resistance. 
About the product 
Ponatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, produced by a computational and structure-based approach to the 
development of a small molecule TKI. Ponatinib was designed with the purpose of potently inhibiting the 
kinase activity of native BCR-ABL, and all mutant variants, including ‘gatekeeper’ T315I. 
The applicant claimed the approval for the following indication: 
Iclusig is indicated in adult patients with chronic phase, advanced phase, or blast phase chronic myeloid 
leukaemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) who are 
resistant or intolerant to prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. 
The final indication following CHMP review of this application is: 
Iclusig is indicated in adult patients with 
 
chronic  phase,  accelerated  phase,  or  blast  phase  chronic  myeloid  leukaemia  (CML)  who  are 
resistant  to  dasatinib  or  nilotinib;  who  are  intolerant  to  dasatinib  or  nilotinib  and  for  whom 
subsequent treatment with imatinib is not clinically appropriate; or who have the T315I mutation 
 
Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) who are resistant to 
dasatinib; who are intolerant to dasatinib and for whom subsequent treatment with imatinib is not 
clinically appropriate; or who have the T315I mutation. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This  application  has  been  submitted  in  accordance  with  the  Article  8(3)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC, 
concerning  a  new  active  substance  in  the  centralised  procedure  containing  administrative,  quality, 
non-clinical and clinical data.

According to Article 3(1) and point 4 of the Annex of  Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, referring to an orphan 
designated  medicinal  product,  this  application  falls  under  the  mandatory  scope  for  a  centralised 
procedure application.  
This application has been accepted for accelerated assessment by the CHMP on 25/07/2012. 
The applicant received protocol assistance from CHMP and COMP: 
EMEA/H/SA/1556/1/2010/PA/SME/III and EMEA/H/SA/1556/2/2010/PA/SME/III 
These involved the non-clinical program, the clinical pharmacology studies planned, and the pivotal phase 
II study design. The phase II single arm study discussed is relevant to the indication applied for in this 
application.  
EMEA/H/SA/1556/3/2011/PA/SME/III 
This scientific advice dealt with quality issues in relation to the development and manufacture of the drug 
substance and product. 
EMEA/H/SA/1556/1/FU/1/2011/PA/SME/III 
This advice dealt with the requirements for additional non-clinical data in relation to the currently applied 
indications. In addition advice was also given regarding the conduct and design of a phase III clinical 
study  comparing  ponatinib  with  imatinib  in  the  first  line  indication  in  chronic  phase  chronic  myeloid 
leukaemia (CML-CP). This indication is not applied for in this application. 
In the adopted SAWP advice, it was stated that  
1) major cytogenetic response or major molecular response rates are both acceptable surrogate primary 
endpoints in CML-CP but should also include a time endpoint to show durability;  
2) if the response rate is convincing a pivotal single arm Phase 2 trial might be acceptable for T315I+ 
CP-CML;  
3) a non-comparative design may not be acceptable for patients resistant or intolerant to a second-line 
agent  without  a  BCR-ABL  mutation;  if  efficacy  of  AP24534  was  comparable  to  that  of  approved 
second-line TKIs in terms of MCyR or MMR, single arm studies in the populations to be studied would 
support licensure if tolerability and toxicity also were similar.  
A paediatric investigation plan (PIP) has been agreed for, in the indication to treat children with Chronic 
(CP), accelerated (AP), or blast phase (BP) CML who are resistant or intolerant to prior tyrosine kinase 
(TKI) therapy.  
A  product-specific  waiver  was  granted  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  myeloid  leukaemia  and  acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia in children from birth to less than 1 year of age, on the basis that these diseases 
do not normally occur in the specified paediatric subset.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Ponatinib is an off-white to yellow powder, not hygroscopic and soluble in organic solvents such as 
2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, sparingly soluble in methanol and 
slightly soluble in ethanol. In addition, the active substance is slightly soluble in aqueous solutions and 
high soluble in acid aqueous solutions. The chemical name is 
3-(imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazin-3-ylethynyl)-4-methyl-N-{4-[(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl]-3-(trifluoro
methyl)phenyl}benzamide hydrochloride. The molecular formula is C29H28ClF3N6O and has the following 
chemical structure: 
Ponatinib has no chiral carbon atoms. Only one polymorphic form is consistently produced and used 
during the manufacture of the finished product.  
Manufacture 
Ponatinib  is  synthesized  in  four  main  steps  using  commercially  available  and  well  defined  starting 
materials. The final active substance is purified by crystallisation. The manufacturing process is described 
in  detail  and  has  been  developed  using  a  combination  of  an  enhanced  development  process  with  a 
number of design of experiment (DOE) studies carried out along with conventional univariate studies. The 
purpose was to better understand the process and to propose design spaces in terms of processing ranges 
for some of the most important unit operations.  
The DOE studies were carried out using fractional or full factorial designs. Full details of the studies have 
been presented. This includes the factors that were evaluated along with the responses and a statistical 
evaluation of the results.  
The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial 
scale batches fully support the proposed Design Spaces.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
A comprehensive discussion on impurities and residual solvents was presented and the results were well 
within the limits set by the ICH guidelines Q3A and Q3C.  
The purified active substance is packed in double polyethylene (LDPE) bags.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identification (FT- IR; HPLC), chloride 
identity, chloride assay, assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), solid form confirmation

(XRPD, Ph.Eur.), heavy metals, particle size distribution (Ph.Eur.), residual metal catalysts (Ph.Eur.) and 
water content (Ph.Eur.). 
A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Full method validation data was also 
provided for the in-house analytical methods in accordance with the relevant ICH Guidelines. The 
analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the active substance. The impurity limits 
are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety.  
Batch analysis data are provided on twenty four pilot batches and four production batches produced by 
the proposed synthetic route, and the batch analysis data show that the active ingredient can be 
manufactured reproducibly. All results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Three production scale batches of the active substance packed in the intended commercial packaging 
(LDPE bags) from the proposed manufacturers were put on stability testing as per ICH conditions: under 
long  term  (25°C/60%RH)  for  up  24  months,  under  intermediate  conditions  (30°C/60%RH)  and 
accelerated (40°C/75%RH) for up 6 months. The active substance used in the primary stability studies 
was manufactured according to the commercial process.  
The  following  parameters  were  tested:  appearance,  assay  (HPLC  98.0–  102.0%),  impurities  (HPLC), 
residual  solvents  (GC),  solid  form  confirmation  (XRPD,  Ph.Eur.),  water  content  and  microbial  quality 
(Ph.Eur.).   
Forced degradation studies were conducted by exposing the active substance to high temperature, acid, 
base  and oxidative conditions. It was noted  that only  minor degradation of the active substance  was 
observed under exposure to heat, but significant degradation was observed in acid and under oxidative 
conditions. 
Photostability testing following ICH guidelines Q1B was performed. The results showed that there are no 
significant changes for any of the evaluated parameters established for the stability studies. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  is  stable  at  controlled  room  temperature.  The 
results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to obtain immediate release film-coated tablet.. The 
proposed strengths of tablets (15mg and 45mg) are of different sizes. The excipients used are common 
for these types of dosage form and are of pharmacopoeial quality.  
During drug development three different pharmaceutical forms have been developed:  drug-in-capsule 
(no other excipients were used in this formulation), capsules, 15 mg and 45 mg film coated tablets. 
The composition of the formulated capsules and tablets were very similar and both were manufactured 
using a dry blend to produce two dose-weight proportional capsule or film-coated tablet.  Capsules were 
used only in the early dose-escalation portion of the phase I clinical trial.  The need for a commercial dose 
of 45 mg was identified during the phase I clinical trial. Bioequivalence studies were not required in order 
Iclusig

to demonstrate similarity between capsules and the proposed commercial formulation. The 
discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated during the drug development. 
The finished product have been developed using an enhanced approach with design of experiment studies 
(DOE) carried out on some aspects of the process. This was done to gain a better understanding of the 
product and manufacturing process. 
Detailed  information  has  been  provided  regarding  the  formulation  development  and  manufacturing 
history in terms of the formulation, process and sites and extensive batch data has been provided which 
confirms the consistency/uniformity of the products.  
The primary packaging proposed is adequately described (HDPE bottles closed with polypropylene screw 
caps).  The  packaging  materials  comply  with  Ph.Eur.  requirements  and  are  adequate  to  support  the 
stability and use of the product. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of the following main steps: blending, compression, film coating and 
packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
As  already  mentioned  Design  space  is  applicable  to  the  compression  step  in  terms  of  acceptable 
processing ranges (compression force and press speed).  
The  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies  for  the  major  steps  of  the 
manufacturing process and it is able to consistently produce a finished product of the intended quality. 
The in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form.  
The  batch  analysis  data  on  three  batches  per  strength  show  that  the  tablets  can  be  manufactured 
reproducibly according to the agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of this 
oral preparation. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specification  includes  appropriate  tests  for  appearance  (visual), 
identification  (UV),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  content  of  uniformity  (Ph.Eur.),  and  dissolution 
(HPLC). 
Batch analysis results in nine commercial batches,  of 15 mg film-coated and eight batches, of 45 mg 
film-coated tablets, confirm consistency and uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is 
under control. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  of  three  batches  of  each  strength  stored  under  long  term  conditions  for  18  months  at 
25ºC/60%RH and 30°C/75% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40ºC/75%RH 
according  to  ICH  guidelines.  The  batches  of  medicinal  product  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.

The stability samples were analysed for appearance, dissolution, assay (HPLC) and impurities (HPLC).  
In addition, the photostability of one batch of film-coated tablets was evaluated in accordance with ICH 
guideline Q1B (Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products). No significant changes were 
observed in the stability parameters tested except appearance. Tablets exposed to direct light changed 
from white to light yellow and failed specification.  
The proposed shelf-life of 24 months with the labelled storage condition “Store in the original package in 
order to protect from light” has been justified by stability data provided. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The Applicant used Quality by Design principles in its 
development approach for both the active substance and finished product. A design space was claimed for 
some steps of the manufacturing process of the active substance.  The potential impurities, by products 
of the synthesis and degradation products, have been discussed in detail and do not raise any safety 
concern. The control test and specifications for the active substance have been adequately established. 
There are no novel excipients used in tablet formulation and all excipients are compendial in line with the 
requirements of the current Ph.Eur. monographs. The manufacturing process of the film-coated tablets 
was considered to be a standard manufacturing process. A Design Space has been developed for the 
compression step. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Based on the data provided the quality of this medicinal product is considered to be acceptable. 
Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have 
been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects

Ponatinib was designed with specific features to gain activity against both native and mutant forms of 
BCR-ABL,  including  the  T315I  gatekeeper  mutant.    Ponatinib’s  design  includes  a  carbon-carbon 
triple-bond functionality to overcome gatekeeper residue steric hindrance as well as optimised binding 
elements that lead to extensive contacts with the ABL kinase domain, rendering binding less susceptible 
to disruption by amino acid mutation.   
In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to examine the activity of ponatinib in BCR-ABL-driven models 
of CML.  Many of these studies used Ba/F3 cell lines, which were engineered to be dependent on native or 
mutant BCR-ABL for survival, to examine the potency as well as the mechanism of action of ponatinib.  In 
several of these studies imatinib, nilotinib and/or dasatinib were also examined for comparison. 
A  broad  in  vitro  screen  was  conducted  to  understand  the  kinase  selectivity  profile  of  ponatinib.  Two 
sequential  screens  were  performed.    First,  a  broad  panel  of  235  protein  kinases,  which  included  222 
unique  human  kinases  and  an  additional  13  mutant  variants,  was  assayed  using  a  single  ponatinib 
concentration of 1 μM.  In this screen, 56 of 235 kinases demonstrated ≥90% inhibition of kinase activity. 
A secondary screen was then performed on a panel of 108 kinases, which included enzymes that were 
strongly inhibited in the first round, to identify IC50 values.

Table 01: In vitro Inhibitory Profile of Ponatinib Against 108 Kinases 
Source:  ARIAD Report ARP280 
Ponatinib potently inhibits the kinase activity of native ABL (0.4 nM IC50) and has activity against native 
BCR-ABL in a cellular assay (0.5 nM IC50). Ponatinib also potently inhibits the kinase activity of T315I ABL 
(IC50-2.0 nM). In cellular assays, ponatinib was able to potently inhibit the activity of all 14 BCR-ABL 
mutants tested, including T315I, that cause resistance to dasatinib, nilotinib, and/or imatinib.  
Of the BCR-ABL mutants tested, T315I, E255K and E255V were inhibited the least, with IC50 values of 11, 
14 and 36 nM, respectively. In a cell-based accelerated mutagenesis assay, no mutation in BCR-ABL was 
detected  that  could  confer  resistance  to  40  nM  ponatinib.  Oral  administration  of  ponatinib  inhibited 
BCR-ABL  signalling,  induced  tumour  shrinkage  and  prolonged  survival  in  mice  bearing  tumours 
expressing native or T315I mutant BCR-ABL. These  preclinical studies support the characterisation of 
ponatinib as a potent pan BCR-ABL inhibitor.

Ponatinib also inhibits the activity of other clinically relevant kinases with IC50 values <20 nM and has 
demonstrated cellular activity against RET, FLT3, and KIT and members of the FGFR, VEGFR and PDGFR 
families of kinases. 
Serum protein binding did not adversely affect the activity of ponatinib.  The potency with which ponatinib 
inhibited the viability of cells expressing T315I mutant BCR-ABL was similar under normal cell culture 
conditions (8 nM IC50) and in the presence of physiologically-relevant levels of human serum albumin (14 
nM IC50).    
AP24600,  a  major  metabolite  of  ponatinib  in  human  plasma,  had  no  effect  on  the  viability  of  cells 
expressing  native  or  T315I  mutant  BCR-ABL  (IC50  >10,000  nM).    AP24567,  a  minor  metabolite  of 
ponatinib in human plasma, inhibited viability of cells expressing native or T315I mutant BCR-ABL with 
approximately 4-fold reduced potency compared to ponatinib.

In  Ba/F3  cells  expressing  native  or  T315I  mutant  BCR-ABL  ponatinib  induced  apoptosis  with  a 
half-maximal concentration of 2–57 nM and inhibited phosphorylation of BCR-ABL with an IC50 of 25-78 
nM.    Nilotinib  and  dasatinib  induced  apoptosis  and  inhibited  phosphorylation  of  BCR-ABL  in  cells 
expressing native but not T315I mutant BCR-ABL. 
Additional studies demonstrated that ponatinib potently inhibited the viability of three BCR-ABL-positive 
cell lines, but not three BCR-ABL-negative cell lines, derived from leukaemia patients.  In one of these 
BCR-ABL-positive cell lines, K562 cells, ponatinib was also shown to potently induce apoptosis and inhibit 
BCR-ABL phosphorylation. 
To determine whether any single mutation in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL could confer resistance to 
ponatinib, 3 accelerated mutagenesis studies were performed with ponatinib. In cells exposed to 10 nM 
ponatinib, limited outgrowth was observed, with a variety of mutations detected at low frequency.  In 
cells exposed to 20 nM ponatinib, outgrowth was sharply curtailed, with only 2 mutations, E255V and 
T315I, persisting.  At 40 nM ponatinib, complete suppression of in vitro resistance was observed in all 3 
studies.  Fourty (40) nM ponatinib was shown to inhibit viability of Ba/F3 cells expressing native BCR-ABL 
and all 14 mutants tested and 40 nM ponatinib was shown to suppress emergence of any single mutant 
BCR-ABL  clone  in  3  separate  studies.    These  results  led  to  the  hypothesis  that  in  patients  with 
BCR-ABL-positive  disease,  trough  concentrations  of  ponatinib  greater  than  40  nM  (21  ng/mL)  should 
result in clinical benefit.  
Two types of mouse model systems were used to characterise the in vivo activity of ponatinib against 
native and T315I mutant BCR-ABL.  In a survival model in which mice were injected intravenously with 
Ba/F3  cells  that  express  native  BCR-ABL,  and  in  a  separate  study  with  Ba/F3  cells  expressing  T315I 
mutant BCR-ABL. treatment with ponatinib prolonged survival time in a dose-dependent manner.   
In a xenograft model in which mice were injected subcutaneously with K562 cells, which express native 
BCR-ABL, treatment  with ponatinib inhibited  tumour growth  in a dose-dependent manner.    Daily  oral 
dosing with 1 mg/kg ponatinib for 18 days suppressed tumour growth significantly. Daily oral dosing at 
2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg caused tumour regression in all mice. During an 8 week observation period after the 
last  dose,  tumour  regression  was  maintained  in  all  mice.  Inhibition  of  BCR-ABL  phosphorylation  was 
observed in tumours from mice dosed with ponatinib. 
In a xenograft model in which mice were injected subcutaneously with Ba/F3 cells  that express T315I 
mutant BCR-ABL, treatment with ponatinib inhibited tumour growth in a dose-dependent manner.  Daily 
oral dosing at 2.5 and 5 mg/kg for 19 days suppressed tumour growth though it was not statistically 
significant.  Daily oral dosing at 10 and 30 mg/kg caused statistically significant tumour growth inhibition 
and stasis, respectively. Daily oral dosing at 50 mg/kg caused statistically significant tumour regression. 
Inhibition  of  T315I  mutant  BCR-ABL  phosphorylation  was  observed  in  tumours  from  mice  dosed  with 
ponatinib.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro, ponatinib inhibited the viability of the FLT3-ITD-positive leukemic cell line, MV-4-11, with an 
IC50 of 2 nM.  In a xenograft model in which mice were injected subcutaneously with  MV-4-11 cells, 
ponatinib  inhibited  tumour  growth  in  a  dose-dependent  manner.    Dosing  at  2.5  mg/kg/day  p.o. 
suppressed tumour growth and dosing at 5 and 10 mg/kg caused significant tumour regression. Inhibition 
of FLT3-ITD phosphorylation occurred in tumours from mice dosed with ponatinib.   
In  Ba/F3  cells  engineered  to  express  activated  FGFR1-4,  ponatinib  potently  inhibited  FGFR-mediated 
signalling  and  viability  with  IC50s  <40  nM.      In  a  panel  of  14  cancer  cell  lines  containing  FGFRs 
dysregulated by a variety of mechanisms, ponatinib inhibited FGFR-mediated signalling with IC50s <40 
nM  and  inhibited  cell  growth  with  half  maximal  concentrations  of  7  to  181  nM.    Daily  oral  dosing  of 
ponatinib (10 to 30 mg/kg) to mice reduced tumour growth and inhibited signalling in all 3 FGFR-driven 
models examined.   
In a cell line containing an activating mutation in KIT (N822K), ponatinib inhibited KIT phosphorylation 
and viability. In a cell line containing an activated PDGFRα (FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion) ponatinib inhibited 
PDGFRα  phosphorylation  and  viability.  In  Ba/F3  cells  engineered  to  express  activated  RET,  ponatinib 
potently inhibited RET phosphorylation and viability. 
These studies indicate that ponatinib is an inhibitor of activated KIT, PDGFRα and RET in cellular models 
and FLT3 and FGFRs in cellular and in vivo models. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The programme was carried out to determine the potential effects of ponatinib on CNS, CVS, pulmonary, 
renal and gastrointestinal systems.   
Under the experimental conditions, ponatinib had no clinically relevant effects on the CNS or pulmonary 
function. Ponatinib at 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg produced increases in urine output and electrolyte excretions 
without  affecting  pH  or  electrolyte  concentrations.  Ponatinib  at  3,  10,  and  30  mg/kg  did  not  affect 
gastrointestinal motility in rats but did cause a non-dose dependent decrease in gastric emptying.  
Ponatinib inhibited the hERG current with an IC50 of 2330 nM however this finding may not be clinically 
significant  since  this  IC50  is  well  above  therapeutic  plasma  concentration  of  ponatinib  in  the  clinical 
setting.  An  increase  in  the  QTc  interval  occurred  in  1/4  telemetered  dogs  at  an  oral  dose  of  10 
mg/kg.  However, the relationship to treatment is uncertain based on the short duration at early time 
points when systemic exposure to the drug was considered submaximal.  The QTc interval for this animal 
returned  to  baseline  prior  to  expected  maximal  systemic  exposure  and  remained  at  baseline  for  the 
remainder of a 24 hour observation period. Whilst there may be no unequivocal evidence of QTc interval 
prolongation, the data shows that the exposure in the dog cardiovascular safety pharmacology was below 
clinical exposure.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been addressed during the clinical development which is 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The ADME of ponatinib have been studied in mice (CD-1), rats (Sprague Dawley and Long-Evans), dogs 
(Beagle), monkeys (Cynomolgus) and humans after oral (p.o) and/or intravenous (i.v) administration.  
Only one of the pharmacokinetic studies was conducted in compliance with GLP. The single dose non-GLP 
studies were conducted in the discovery phase. They  were stated to have been conducted to defined 
Iclusig 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220290/2013 
Page 20/100 
 
 
 
 
 
 
protocols and GLP-like procedures were followed, hence  there was no  impact  on the validity  of these 
studies.  Later  in  development  GLP-compliant  studies  with  complementary  pharmacokinetics  were 
conducted. 
Absorption 
Following oral administration ponatinib was readily absorbed in the mouse but more slowly in the monkey 
(tmax 4h) and rat (tmax 6h). The oral bioavailability in the two main test species was 54% in the rat and 
26% in the monkey. The terminal half-life of ponatinib in plasma after an IV dose was 9.7 h in the rat and 
5.3h in the monkey. The blood clearance was low in the monkey but moderate in the rat. 
Distribution 
Distribution was investigated in male rats, both the albino Long Evans rat and pigmented Sprague Dawley 
rat. The distribution of drug-derived radioactivity in pigmented rats was generally similar to that in albino 
rats. Tissue concentrations in the pigmented uveal tract of the eye of the LE rats (Cmax  of 86.632 µg 
equiv/g at 96 h) were higher than that in the same tissues of albino rats (Cmax of 2.099 µg equiv/g at 24 
h), suggesting binding of drug-derived radioactivity with melanin. According to the published literature it 
appears not to be of toxicological significance. 
Ponatinib  was  highly  bound  to  plasma  proteins.  The  extent  of  protein  binding  (%  bound)  was  nearly 
constant across the range of 100 to 3000 ng/mL in all species tested.  The mean percent protein binding 
of ponatinib in all species was in the range 99.92-99.99. 
Ponatinib was equally distributed into RBCs and plasma, and did not show preferential partitioning into 
red blood cells in mouse, rat, monkey, or human blood. Drug derived radioactivity was found in the brain, 
the Tmax being 48 hours. 
Ponatinib is either a non-substrate or a very weak substrate of P-gp and BCRP and not a substrate of 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OCT1.  Ponatinib is not an inhibitor of transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, 
OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2.  However, ponatinib is an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP and BSEP. Inhibition is seen for 
Pgp and BCRP in vitro in the clinical dose range. 
Metabolism 
The major metabolic pathways of ponatinib in microsomes and hepatocytes were N-demethylation and 
hydroxylation.  In vitro, ponatinib was mostly metabolised by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6, 
CYP2C8 and CYP3A5. All in vitro metabolites of ponatinib in human liver microsomes/hepatocytes were 
also observed either in rat or monkey microsomes/hepatocytes. 
In vivo, ponatinib was hydrolysed by non-specific esterases or amidases at the amide bond to an acid and 
aniline.  AP24600 was the major metabolite in rat and human plasma but was a trace level metabolite in 
monkey plasma. In rat, monkey and human plasma, the amide hydrolysis metabolite AP24600 was 263%, 
<  1%  and  58.4%  of  the  ponatinib  levels.  In  rats,  the  metabolism  of  ponatinib  was  mainly  to  the 
N-desmethyl  metabolite  AP24567,  which  was  excreted  in  faeces,  and  AP24600  (and  its  downstream 
metabolites)  which  was  excreted  in  urine.  In  monkey  faeces  drug-related  radioactivity  was  present 
mostly as the parent compound or as N-desmethyl ponatinib (M42), hydroxy ponatinib (M31), a double 
lactam at piperazine moiety (M35) and N-oxide ponatinib (M36). In human faeces, ponatinib accounted 
for  23.7%  of  the  radioactivity  and  there  was  extensive  metabolism  of  ponatinib.  Other  metabolites 
identified  in  human  faeces  were  hydroxy  ponatinib,  N-desmethyl  ponatinib,  and  several  minor 
metabolites resulting from two or more modifications. 
Hydrolytic cleavage of the central amide would yield aniline and the carboxylic acid metabolite: AP24600.  
The  negative  results  in  the  in  vivo  micronucleus  study  are  reassuring.  On  the  other  hand,  there  is  a 
Iclusig

concern that in the in vitro tests the appropriate metabolic system to generate the aniline was not used. 
However, in view of the proposed therapeutic indication and patient population (with advanced cancer) it 
is considered that further studies are not warranted 
DDIs due to CYP inhibition by the metabolite AP24600 are unlikely since the IC50 for the inhibition of each 
of  the  seven  CYPs  by  AP24600  were  all  >100  µM.  Ponatinib  is  mostly  metabolised  by  CYP3A4  and 
esterases.  Consequently  inhibition  of  ponatinib  metabolism  by  inhibitors  of  CYP3A4  might  lead  to 
increased  exposure  to  ponatinib  whilst  induction  of  CYP3A4  by  co-administered  drugs  might  lead  to 
decreased exposure to ponatinib.  Ponatinib  is metabolized by  esterases (or  peptidases)  to  AP24600.  
Since esterases are ubiquitous, inhibition of esterases leading to increased plasma levels of ponatinib is 
unlikely.  
Excretion 
Following  an  oral  dose,  ponatinib  was  mainly  excreted  in  faeces  (82-  88%)  with  2-10%  of  the  dose 
recovered in the urine of rats, monkeys, and humans. Overall, ponatinib was eliminated predominantly by 
metabolism.

Major findings 
Seven (2 males, 5 females) of the 30 animals at 6 mg/kg/day in the 
toxicology portion of the study were found dead/sacrificed in moribund 
condition between dose Days 5 and 9.  Because of poor health, dosing of 
animals in this high dose group was stopped. Three (1 male, 2 females) of 30 
animals at 3 mg/kg/day in the toxicology portion of the study were found 
dead/sacrificed in moribund condition between Days 9 and 13. One animal (a 
male) of 30 animals at 1.5 mg/kg/day in the toxicology portion of the study 
was found dead on Day 28. 
6 mg/kg: Hyperplasia of bone marrow. Minimal to marked necrosis of 
thymus. Sporadic necrosis of the glandular and non-glandular mucosa of the 
stomach. 
≥3mg/kg: rough hair coats; inappetance; thinness; lethargy; hunched 
posture; cold skin; dry, red material (porphyrin staining) on the eyes, nose, 
face, and forepaws; scant feces; urine staining; dark yellow urine; eye 
squint; and labored breathing. Dry, flaky skin of forepaws. 
Reduced body weight gain and food consumption. Hyperplasia of epiphyseal 
plate of the femur. 
≥1.5 mg/kg: Slight increases in neutrophils, monocytes and eosinophils and 
decreases in lymphocytes; most pronounced in 3 and 6 mg/kg groups.

Transient and minor increases in ALT, AST, BUN, glucose and triglycerides. 
Slight decrease in thyroid hormone T3. 
With the exception on lower body weight gain in males at 3 mg/kg, all 
findings were reversible. 
Mortality: 2 mg/kg: 20/68 animals, 0.75 mg/kg: 3/68 animals. 
2 mg/kg: Incease in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, decreases in 
albumin, globulin and total protein. Increase in urine protein, correlated to 
increased incidence of chronic progressive nephropathy. Lymphoid depletion 
in thymus. 
≥0.75 mg/kg: Reduced body weight and food consumption. Increases in 
neutrophil, monocyte and eosinophil counts. Increase in fibrogen. 
Inflammation in preputial and clitoral glands. Reduced number of 
chnodrocytes along the physis in femur.  
After recovery period, changes in femur at ≥0.75 mg/kg and kidney at 2 
mg/kg still present. 
Mortality: 5 mg/kg: Three animals (2M, 1F) euthanized in moribound 
condition during study (days 19, 21 and 22). 
5 mg/kg: Dry flaky skin, mild to marked skin erythema at a large number of 
anatomical sites. Ocular discharge. Decreased thyroid hormone T3 levels and 
increased T4 levels. Pancreas diffusely thickened due to either diffuse fibrosis 
or insterstitial oedema. Acinar cell necrosis or atrophy in pancreas. All early 
descendants had lymphoid depletion in thymus. Degeneration of germ cell 
epithelium of testes, decrease numbers of spermatids. Increased follicular 
atresia in ovaries and atrophy of the uterine endometrium follicles. 
≥2.5 mg/kg: Pancreas: Acinar cell necrosis, atrophy or regeneration. 
Lymphoid depletion in thymus, spleen , lymph nodes and gut associated 
lymphoid tissue. Granulamotous inflammation of the lung. 
≥1 mg/kg: Dose-dependent decrease in body weight and/or body weight 
gain. Lower food consumption. Systolic heart murmurs in all dose groups (LD 
1M, MD 1F, HD 1M+1F). Increase excretion of urinary protein, no 
microscopic correlates. 
At the end of recovery period, atrophy of thyroid gland in one male at 5 
mg/kg, increased urinary protein at all doses. 
No microorganisms or evidence for infectious agents were apparent 
microscopically. 
The only noteworthy ponatinib related observations were reversible 
increases in serum ALT and AST levels. 
The low degree of toxicity observed at the high dose was likely due to lower 
than expected exposure levels. 
In the rat, histopathological changes in the stomach including hyperkeratosis and necrosis occurred at the 
top dose of 6mg/kg in the 28-day study, but were absent in the 6-month study. However, the 6-month 
study was conducted at lower dose levels (top dose 2mg/kg/day at which the multiple of human steady 
state exposure at the 45mg clinical dose was 1.0) than the 28-day study (top dose 6mg/kg/day at which 
the  exposure  multiple  was  2.1).  These  findings  were  reversible  upon  cessation  of  treatment.  These 
findings were not reported in the monkey studies. 
In the single dose toxicity study in the monkey on Day 13 post-dose there were systolic heart murmurs 
(Grade II/VI) in 1/2 males at 45 mg/kg and 1/2 females at 5 mg/kg.  These murmurs were not detected 
during the pre-study physical examination. Heart murmurs were also noted near the end of the 28-day 
repeat dose toxicity study in surviving animals as follows: one male at 1 mg/kg/day (a low Grade I/VI), 
one female at 2.5 mg/kg/day (Grade III/VI), one male at 5 mg/kg/day (Grade II/VI) and one female at 
5 mg/kg/day (Grade I/VI, intermittent). These findings were reversible during a 28-day non-treatment 
recovery period.  No murmurs were detected during the pre-study physical examinations. No macroscopic 
or microscopic correlates were noted in the hearts of these animals, including examination of the aortic 
and other valves. Also they were not reported in the 6 month monkey toxicity study but dose levels were 
low  and  the  multiples  of  human  steady  state  exposure  were  0.02,  0.82  and  0.46  at  0.25mg/kg, 
0.75mg/kg and 2mg/kg (top dose) respectively i.e. below clinical exposure levels.

Inflammatory changes accompanied by increases in neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and fibrinogen 
levels  were  found  in  the  preputial  and  clitoral  glands  in  the  rat  6-month  study.  These  effects  were 
reversible upon cessation of treatment. 
In the monkey 28-day study granulomatous inflammation involving the lungs was present in 1/3 females 
at 2.5 mg/kg/day and in 2/2 males and 1/3 females at 5 mg/kg/day at the end of the dosing phase.  This 
lesion  was  characterised  by  mild  to  moderate,  multifocal  aggregates  of  alveolar  macrophages, 
lymphocytes, and multinucleated syncitial cells within alveolar spaces, occasionally within alveolar spaces 
off of respiratory bronchioles. It was not reported in the subsequent 6-month study.

Segment I studies are not required according to the EMEA/CHMP/ICH/646107/2008 S9 guideline for 
medicinal products for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. 
Toxicokinetic data 
The recommended daily dose of ponatinib in patients is 45 mg/day. Because of the relatively high 
sensitivities of the animal species to the toxic effects of ponatinib, a margin of safety either could not be 
established or was low with respect to the repeat dose toxicity studies relative to the exposure levels 
obtained in humans at the human oral dose of 45 mg/day (see table 7)

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following point to be addressed: 
The Applicant will conduct appropriate studies to assess the environmental risk and submit the results 
by March 2014. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Ponatinib was shown to inhibit viability of  Ba/F3 cells expressing native  BCR-ABL and  all 14 clinically 
relevant mutants tested, including T315I, with IC50 values of 0.5 to 36 nM. Serum protein binding did not 
adversely affect the activity of ponatinib.  
Preclinical studies have shown that certain compound  mutations in BCR-ABL,  defined  as two  or more 
mutations  in  the  same  BCR-ABL  allele,  can confer  resistance  to  ponatinib;  the  T315I/E255V 
compound mutant  may  confer  clinically  relevant  resistance.  As  shown  in  vitro,  activation  of  the 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR and STAT3 pathways may potentially constitute BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms of 
resistance to ponatinib. No information on the effect of p53 mutation status or function on the efficacy of 
ponatinib is available.  
Ponatinib  was  highly  bound  to  plasma  proteins.  Ponatinib  is  either  a  non-substrate  or  a  very  weak 
substrate of P-gp and BCRP and not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OCT1.  Ponatinib is not an 
inhibitor of transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2.  However, ponatinib is an 
inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP and BSEP. 
The major metabolic pathways of ponatinib in microsomes and hepatocytes were N-demethylation and 
hydroxylation.  In vivo, ponatinib was hydrolysed by non-specific esterases or amidases at the amide 
bond to an acid and aniline.  AP24600 was the major metabolite in rat and human plasma. Following an 
oral dose, ponatinib was mainly excreted in faeces (82- 88%). 
Ponatinib has been evaluated in safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, reproductive 
toxicity, and phototoxicity studies. 
Dose-limiting toxicity was expressed as mortality and occurred at exposures below clinical exposure. The 
cause for mortality was not clearly established.  
Cynomolgus monkeys were selected as the non-rodent species for toxicology testing.

Dry flaky skin, rough coats and thinning fur was also a common observation in the repeated dose 
toxicology studies at clinically relevant exposure levels.   
Depletion  of  lymphoid  organs  was  observed  in  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  cynomolgus 
monkeys.    The  effects  were  shown  to  be  reversible  after  withdrawal  of  the  treatment.  It  is  unknown 
whether  ponatinib  causes  lymphoid  depletion  in  humans.  Decreases  in  peripheral  lymphocyte  counts 
(20.8%  grade  3  or  4)  were  observed  in  the  clinical  studies,  however,  the  relationship  to  lymphoid 
depletion is unclear.  
Approved BCR-ABL inhibitors are associated with congestive failure/left ventricular dysfunction (imatinib) 
and conduction abnormalities (QT prolongation) (dasatinib; nilotinib). A thorough QT/QTc study has not 
been conducted and the effect of ponatinib on QT prolongation cannot be ruled out (see section 4.4 of the 
SmPC). 
Hyper-/hypoplastic changes of the chondrocytes in the physis were noted in repeat-dose toxicity studies 
in rats. The effect was reversible upon cessation of treatment in the 28-day study but not in the 6 month 
study. These findings may be species specific since they were not reported in either monkey studies.  
While mild-moderate visual disturbances were occasionally reported in clinical trials, there were no 
reports of ocular phototoxicity. In a study in rats, diffuse corneal oedema with neutrophilic cell infiltration, 
and hyperplastic changes in the lenticular epithelium suggestive of a mild phototoxic reaction were 
observed in animals treated with 5 and 10 mg/kg ponatinib (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
In cynomolgus monkeys,  systolic heart murmurs  with  no macroscopic or microscopic correlates were 
noted  in  individual  animals  in  the  toxicity  studies.  The  clinical  relevance  of  this  finding  is  unknown. 
Nevertheless, it has been reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC.  
The pancreas was identified as a target organ of toxicity in the 28 day toxicity study in monkeys. This 
observation correlated with the identification of pancreatitis as the dose limiting toxicity in the clinical 
program.  Elevations  in  pancreatic  enzymes  and  clinical  pancreatitis  were  observed  in  humans. 
Pancreatitis is an identified risk in the RMP. 
Thyroid gland follicular atrophy mostly accompanied by a reduction in T3 levels and a tendency toward 
increased TSH levels were observed in the 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. No 
noteworthy changes in thyroid hormone have been observed in humans, in particular, decreased serum 
T3 values were not observed in clinical studies. In addition TSH values were routinely measured in the 
phase 1 study and clinically relevant levels of increased TSH were not observed. 
The histological changes observed in the femur of rats appear to be species specific since histological 
changes in the femur were not observed in the monkey studies. However, because of emerging concerns 
of growth delay in children exposed to long term imatinib and possibly other TKIs (Suttorp 2010),  the 
Applicant proposed to monitor growth in children receiving ponatinib. 
In the monkey 28-day study, granulomatous inflammation involving the lungs was present at the end of 
the dosing phase. The cause of the granulomatous inflammation in this study is unknown.  The clinical 
data shows no evidence of pulmonary granulomatous inflammation. The evidence indicates that these 
findings in the monkey are not of clinical relevance. 
Slight increases in liver enzyme levels were observed at clinically relevant or lower exposure levels in the 
repeat  dose  toxicology  program.    However,  there  were  no  histological  correlates  observed  upon 
microscopic examination of liver specimens.  Elevated liver enzyme levels (including ALT and AST) were 
observed in clinical trials. No Hy’s law cases were identified in the ponatinib clinical development program. 
This finding is addressed in the SmPC and in the RMP as an important identified risk.

The administration of ponatinib was associated with transient increase of glucose and triglycerides in the 
rat. In some monkeys there was an increase in triglycerides but this was not invariably associated with 
pancreatitis.    The  clinical  data  presented  did  not  indicate  a  clinical  relevance  of  increased  glucose  or 
triglycerides in the development of pancreatitis in patients treated with ponatinib. 
Ponatinib did not exhibit genotoxic properties when evaluated in the standard in vitro and in vivo systems.  
According to the guideline EMEA/CHMP/ICH/646107/2008 S9, carcinogenicity studies are not warranted 
to support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer. 
Possible  ponatinib-related  findings  in  the  28  day  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  in  cynomolgus  monkey 
study at 5mg/kg/day included degeneration of germ cell epithelium with decreased number of spermatids 
in  males,  and  increased  ovarian  follicular  atresia  with  associated  atrophy  of  endometrial  follicles  in 
females. The clinical relevance remains unclear. These issues are addressed in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
The Applicant will conduct a formal study in rats to evaluate the effects of ponatinib on male fertility, as 
reflected in the RMP. Results will be submitted by December 2015. 
In rats, embryo-foetal toxicity in the form of post-implantation loss,  reduced  foetal body weight, and 
multiple soft tissue and skeletal alterations were observed at maternal toxic dosages.  Multiple foetal soft 
tissue and skeletal alterations were also observed at maternal nontoxic dosages.  
In the ERA conducted by the Applicant, the PBT screening was lacking. Whilst the data calculated by the 
applicant is above the trigger for PBT, it is recommended that a correct experimentally determined log 
Kow value is provided accompanied by a study report as stated in the CHMP Q&A on environmental risk 
assessment. When log Kow is above 4.5, a PBT assessment is warranted irrespective of the PECsw.  If 
appropriate, it is recommended to finalise a PBT assessment. The PBT should follow the REACH guidance 
meaning that a BCF value should be obtained before embarking on animal studies. The 100 ton/yr limit is 
not considered relevant in this matter. It is recommended that the Applicant submits the relevant results 
by March 2014.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

the treatment of ALL and CML.

The phase I dose finding study and the phase II pivotal study were performed in patients. The other 3 
phase I studies (food effect study, drug interaction study and mass balance study) were conducted in 
healthy subjects. Population PK analysis has been performed in patients in the phase I dose finding study. 
Target  effect  PD  measurements  have  been  performed  in  the  dose  finding  study  by  investigating  the 
reduction in phosphorylated CRKL in patients with CML and Ph+ ALL. This clinical data was supplemented 
by data from 7 in vitro studies. 
The applicant claimed the approval for the following indication:

Iclusig is indicated in adult patients with chronic phase, advanced phase, or blast phase chronic myeloid 
leukaemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) who are 
resistant or intolerant to prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. 
The final indication following CHMP review of this application is: 
Iclusig is indicated in adult patients with 
 
chronic  phase,  accelerated  phase,  or  blast  phase  chronic  myeloid  leukaemia  (CML)  who  are 
resistant  to  dasatinib  or  nilotinib;  who  are  intolerant  to  dasatinib  or  nilotinib  and  for  whom 
subsequent treatment with imatinib is not clinically appropriate; or who have the T315I mutation 
 
Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) who are resistant to 
dasatinib; who are intolerant to dasatinib and for whom subsequent treatment with imatinib is not 
clinically appropriate; or who have the T315I mutation. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No  pharmacologically  active  metabolites  have  been  described  for  ponatinib.  The  major  metabolite 
identified  in  humans  is  AP24600,  formed  by  amide  hydrolysis  of  ponatinib.  This  metabolite  was  only 
identified during the mass balance study, and was found in humans, rats, and monkeys (albeit at low 
levels). CYP3A4/5-mediated metabolism of ponatinib in vitro resulted in the formation of both AP24567 
and  AP24734.  AP24567  (N-desmethyl  metabolite)  was  subsequently  identified  as  a  metabolite  of 
ponatinib  in  human  plasma,  whereas  AP24734  was  not  observed  to  any  significant  extent  in  patient 
plasma. Plasma levels of AP24567 were approximately 1% to 2% of ponatinib plasma levels in patients. 
Absorption  
Absolute oral bioavailability of ponatinib in humans has not been determined. Ponatinib HCl is considered 
a “low solubility” compound due to its insolubility in aqueous solution above pH 2. Combined with high 
permeability  assessed  using  the  Caco-2  cell  transport,  ponatinib  is  categorised  as  a  BCS  Class  II 
compound.  Under  fasting  conditions,  maximum  ponatinib  blood  concentrations  in  patients  with 
hematologic  malignancies  generally  occurred  4  to  6  hours  following  oral  administration  of  ponatinib.  
Following  single  dose  administration,  as  well  as  under  steady-state  conditions,  ponatinib  plasma 
exposures (Cmax and AUC) increased in a manner approximately proportional with increasing dose.  
The  influence  of  a  high-fat  meal  and  a  low-fat  meal  on  the  relative  bioavailability  and  the 
pharmacokinetics of a single dose of ponatinib were studied in healthy volunteers, and this showed no 
effect. 
Distribution 
The steady-state apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of ponatinib at the recommended 45 mg dose 
was estimated to be 1101 L.  
In vitro binding of ponatinib in human plasma was estimated to be greater than 99%. The blood to plasma 
partition ratio of ponatinib was 0.96 in human blood. Ponatinib was equally distributed into RBCs and 
plasma and did not show preferential partitioning into red blood cells.  
AP24600, the major metabolite in human and rat plasma, was also highly bound to plasma proteins. The 
extent of protein binding in human and rat plasma was 94.7% and 93.5 %, respectively.

Elimination 
The estimated apparent clearance of ponatinib at steady-state (CLss/F) at the recommended 45 mg dose 
is 35 L/h (CV=55%, N=20). The terminal elimination half-life of ponatinib at steady state at a daily dose 
of 45 mg was 22 hours, resulting in a 1.5-fold accumulation of exposures at steady-state.  
In  the  human  mass  balance  study,  AP24534-11-104,  faecal  excretion  accounted  for  elimination  of 
86.63% of the radioactive dose. Ponatinib was the largest peak in the radiochromatogram accounting for 
23.7% of the faecal radioactivity. M31 (20.4%) was identified as hydroxyl ponatinib. Other metabolites 
M36, M47 and M49 were approximately 2-4% of the total radioactivity. Several, chromatographically not 
well-resolved, metabolites (33.0 to 37.6 min) together accounted for 17.2% of the faecal radioactivity; 
and individually each metabolite accounted for 2-3%. 
The amount of drug and metabolites eliminated through urine was 5.4% of the dose. The metabolite 
profile in urine was dominated by AP24600 (M14) and its glucuronides, M15 and M16. These metabolites 
accounted  for  5.6%  (M14)  28.1%  (M15)  and  19.8%  (M16).  M24  was  identified  as  ponatinib 
hydroxyl-glucuronide and contributed 5.1% to the urinary profile. 
In plasma samples from the ADME study a long terminal half-life of radioactivity of 149 hours is seen, 
further profiling of these samples is required to determine what is contributing to this long half-life. The 
Applicant committed to evaluate plasma samples from the human ADME study in order to identify and 
quantify metabolites of ponatinib. The Final report will be submitted by December 2016. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality of ponatinib was investigated in study AP24534-07-101. Ponatinib showed dose 
proportional increase in Cmax and AUC with dose at steady-state.   
In the population PK analysis, clearance was described to increase as a function of ponatinib 
concentration and time. For a daily dose of 45 mg, a decrease in the steady state concentration by 26% 
was predicted compared to a situation where no change in clearance was assumed. 
As the data in study AP24534-07-101 did not support estimation of terminal elimination rate constant 
after single-dose administration, assessment of within-study time dependency is not possible based on 
the submitted data. The Applicant has used between study comparisons to assess the time-dependency 
in ponatinib exposure (AUC) (see Table 9).

Special populations 
Impaired renal function: 
The effect of baseline serum creatinine and estimated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft Gault formula) was 
found to not have a significant effect on ponatinib concentrations. The median (range) baseline serum 
creatinine  of  the  128  subjects  included  was  0.91  ng/dL  (0.38  to  2.1  ng/dL)  and  the  median  (range) 
estimated creatinine clearance was 105 mL/min (33.8 to 184 mL/min). Only four of the included patients 
had an estimated creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min, and no patient < 30 mL/min. 
Impaired hepatic function: 
Ponatinib has not been formally evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment.  
Gender: 
Of the total 128 patients or healthy subjects included in the analysis, 90 (70%) were males and 38 (30%) 
were females. There does not appear to be a gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of ponatinib. 
Weight: 
Both the effect of weight and body mass index (BMI) on ponatinib pharmacokinetics has been evaluated. 
The median (range) weight of the total 128 subjects included was 77.4 kg (41.7 to 125 kg). The median 
(range) BMI of the evaluable population was 27 kg/m2 (16.3 to 41.1 kg/m2). BMI but not weight was 
found  to  be  a  statistically  significant  covariate  on  apparent  volume  of  distribution  of  the  central 
compartment  (V/F).  A  person  with  a  BMI  level  equal  to  the  upper  90th  percentile  (34  kg/m2)  was 
predicted to have a 14.5% increased V/F whereas a person with an BMI level equal to the lower 10th 
percentile (21 kg/m2), was predicted to have 14.1% lower V/F. The effect of BMI on V/F was however not 
considered clinically relevant. 
Age: 
The  model  used  in  the  PK  studies  does  not  suggest  a  large  effect  of  age  on  clearance,  with  an  18% 
decrease for a subject age 70.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
Ponatinib was incubated with individual recombinant human CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, and CYP2C9). Ponatinib was stable in the incubations with all enzymes 
tested, except CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C8 and CYP2D6. Nearly 55% of ponatinib was metabolised by CYP 
3A4/5 at 60 min leading to metabolites AP24567 (30%), AP24734 (24%) and mono-oxy ponatinib (2%). 
Metabolism of ponatinib by CYP 3A4/5 was qualitatively identical to the metabolism by liver microsomes 
and  hepatocytes.  The  results  from  studies  where  ponatinib  metabolism  was  selectively  inhibited  by 
CYP-specific  inhibitors  and  monoclonal  antibodies  indicate  that  ponatinib  was  metabolised  mostly  by 
CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6, CYP2C8 and CYP3A5. Since human metabolism of ponatinib 
involves CYP3A4/5 isozymes, drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with co-administered  CYP3A4/5  inhibitors 
and inducers are possible. These in vitro data have been followed with a clinical study evaluating the 
impact of ketonconazole mediated CYP3A4/5 inhibition on single dose ponatinib PK (AP24534-11-103).  
In  vitro data showed that ponatinib does not  behave either as an inhibitor or an inducer  of all major 
human drug metabolising CYP450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or 
CYP3A4) (Report ARP267). Further, in vitro data using human hepatocytes demonstrated that ponatinib 
did not alter CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 enzyme activity or messenger RNA (mRNA) levels or CYP2C9 
mRNA levels. It was concluded that ponatinib was not an inhibitor or an inducer of major CYP enzymes 
and that the potential for CYP enzyme inhibition- or induction-mediated drug interaction by ponatinib is 
low at the therapeutic dose of 45 mg. Based on these data, no clinical studies evaluating ponatinib effect 
on CYP probe substrates have been performed.  
In vitro data also indicated that ponatinib was a concentration-dependent inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, with 
IC50  values  of  0.491  μM  and  0.013  μM, 
respectively.  Ponatinib  also  showed  weak 
concentration-dependent inhibition of BSEP that is not expected to be clinically relevant (IC50 of 31.5 
μM). Ponatinib was shown not to be an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3. 
Based  on  these  in  vitro  data,  ponatinib  may  have  the  potential  to  increase  plasma  concentrations  of 
co-administered substrates of P-gp or BCRP. 
In vivo 
One drug interaction study (AP24534-11-103) has been conducted to evaluate the effects of concomitant 
administration  of  ketoconazole  on  the  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  profile  of  ponatinib  following  single-dose 
administration in healthy subjects. 
The  results  showed  a  78%  and  47%  increase  in  plasma  ponatinib  AUC0-∞  and  Cmax,  respectively, 
without  affecting  time  to  achieve  maximum  plasma  concentrations,  following  co-administration  with 
ketoconazole.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No clinical mechanism of action studies were submitted by the applicant. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The  pharmacodynamic  activity  of  ponatinib  was  studied  as  one  of  the  secondary  objectives  of  the 
ponatinib phase  1 trial (AP24534-07-101). The activity  of ponatinib  was studied  in  CML  and Ph+ ALL 
patients, including patients with T315I mutant BCR-ABL. Pharmacodynamic assessments were performed 
on  64  of  65  CML  and  Ph+  ALL  patients  enrolled  in  the  study  by  measuring  relative  levels  of 
phosphorylation  of  the  BCR-ABL  substrate  CRKL  (pCRKL),  relative  to  total  CRKL,  in  peripheral  blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), at baseline and multiple time points throughout the first cycle of ponatinib 
treatment.  
pCRKL, a BCR-ABL adaptor protein, serves as a surrogate of BCR-ABL kinase activity in vivo. 
Fourty  three  (43)  of  the  61  patients  were  ultimately  considered  evaluable  for  pharmacodynamics 
assessment.  
  No substantial reduction was seen in the 2 evaluable patients in the lowest dose cohort (2 mg).  
  A partial reduction of pCRKL (≥25% or ≥50%) was seen in 1 evaluable patient in the 4 mg cohort.  
  A reduction of ≥50% was seen in 4/6 (67%) patients receiving the 8 mg dose, with no substantial 
reduction in 2 patients, both of whom had T315I mutant BCR-ABL.  
  At doses ≥15 mg, 32/34 (94%) patients, including 8/10 (80%) patients with T315I, demonstrated a 
≥50% reduction of pCRKL. One patient at 15 mg had a reduction of ≥25% to <50% and 1 patient at 
45 mg had a reduction of <25%. 
  One patient at 15 mg had a reduction of ≥25% to <50% and 1 patient at 45 mg had a reduction of 
<25%.

Of the 21 non-evaluable patients, 6 patients were lacking either a baseline sample or a sufficient number 
of post treatment samples for evaluation. An additional 15 patients were considered non-evaluable due to 
baseline pCRKL levels ≤20%. Notably, in 14 of these patients pCRKL levels were maintained at ≤20% at 
trough time points. The one exception was a patient who showed a transient elevation of pCRKL levels 
after an 8-day period off therapy.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Ponatinib is a TKI targeting a broad range of kinases. Activity against BCR-ABL, RET, FLT3, and KIT and 
members  of  the  FGFR,  VEGFR,  and  PDGFR  families  of  kinases  has  been  shown  in  cellular  assays. 
Importantly, also investigated BCR-ABL mutants, including the T315I mutation, are inhibited with IC50s 
<40 nM; T315I, E255K and E255V were inhibited least potently, with IC50 values of 11, 14 and 36 nM, 
respectively. Clinical efficacy in T315I+ disease is supported by animal experiments. 
In plasma samples from the ADME study a long terminal half-life of radioactivity of 149 hours is seen. The 
Applicant will evaluate plasma samples from the human ADME study to identify and quantify metabolites 
of ponatinib. The Final report will be submitted by December 2016. 
In order to address missing information regarding time dependency of the pharmacokinetics of ponatinib, 
the Applicant will update the population PK model with PK data from ongoing clinical trials to address 
missing information related to. The updated model will be available by March 2016. 
The Applicant has conducted a comprehensive package of in vitro studies to support inferences regarding 
the potential impact of co-administration of ponatinib with other drugs.   
Ponatinib  is  metabolised  by  CYP3A4.  Co-administration  of  a  single  15 mg  oral  dose  of  Iclusig  in  the 
presence  of  ketoconazole  (400 mg  daily),  a  strong  CYP3A  inhibitor,  resulted  in  modest  increases  in 
ponatinib systemic exposure, with ponatinib AUC0-∞ and Cmax values that were 78% and 47% higher, 
respectively, than those seen when ponatinib was administered alone.  
Caution should be exercised with concurrent use of Iclusig and moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors such 
as  atazanavir,  clarithromycin,  indinavir,  itraconazole,  ketoconazole,  nefazodone,  nelfinavir,  ritonavir, 
saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin, voriconazole, and grapefruit juice.

One in vivo drug interaction study was performed to look at the effect of ketoconazole on ponatinib but 
only a single dose of ketoconazole was given prior to administration of ponatinib in the interaction study. 
The Applicant has therefore included “Treatment of patients receiving concomitantly CYP3A4 inhibitors” 
as important missing information  in the RMP, pending results of PBPK modelling of the interaction of 
ponatinib with twice-daily ketoconazole dosing. Results of this modelling experiment are expected to be 
available by the end of 2013. 
The effect of CYP3A inducers on ponatinib pharmacokinetics has not been studied.  Based on the role of 
CYP3A  in  the  metabolism  of  ponatinib,  it  is  anticipated  that  strong  inducers  will  decrease  ponatinib 
systemic exposures; however, the magnitude of decrease is unknown.  Caution should be exercised with 
concurrent use of Iclusig and strong CYP3A inducers such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, 
rifabutin, rifampicin, and St. John’s Wort. 
The aqueous solubility of ponatinib is pH dependent, with higher pH resulting in lower solubility. Medicinal 
products  that  elevate  the  gastric  pH  (such  as  proton  pump  inhibitors,  H2  blockers,  or  antacids)  may 
decrease the solubility of ponatinib and subsequently reduce its bioavailability. Caution should therefore 
be exercised in case of concurrent treatment. The Applicant will conduct an interaction study with a PPI.  
At present caution is recommended in section 4.4 of the SmPC with drugs that affect gastric pH, the 
results of this study should be used to further inform wording in the SmPC. 
In  vitro,  ponatinib  is  an  inhibitor  of  P-gp  and  BCRP.  Therefore,  ponatinib  may  have  the  potential  to 
increase  plasma  concentrations  of  co-administered  substrates  of  P-gp  (e.g.,  digoxin,  dabigatran, 
colchicine, pravastatin) or BCRP (e.g., methotrexate, rosuvastatin, sulfasalazine) and may increase their 
therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Close clinical surveillance is recommended when ponatinib is 
administered with these medicinal products. 
Induction of cytochrome P450 isozymes by ponatinib was added as important missing information in the 
RMP  and  the  Applicant  committed  to  conduct  an  induction  study  in  hepatocytes  using  higher 
concentrations of ponatinib to allow determination of CYP3A4 induction. The results of this study should 
be submitted by March 2014. A possible effect of induction of CYP450 isozymes by ponatinib could be a 
decrease in the exposure to oral contraceptives.  To ensure this is not the case, an interaction study 
between ponatinib and oral contraceptives will be conducted by the Applicant. The Final report will be 
submitted by December 2016. 
On the basis of the results of the observed 5.4% urinary excretion of administered radioactivity, in the 
human mass balance study, the applicant concluded that renal excretion is not a major route of excretion 
for  ponatinib.  Therefore  a  renal  excretion  study  was  not  conducted.  However,  a  statement  has  been 
included  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  to  advise  caution  when  administering  ponatinib  in  patients  with 
estimated creatinine clearance of <50mL/min, or with end-stage renal disease. 
As  the  hepatic  route  is  a  major  route  of  elimination,  the  presence  of  moderate  to  severe  hepatic 
impairment may result in increased plasma ponatinib concentrations. The Applicant will conduct a study 
in patients with hepatic impairment to address the lack of data in this patient population. The Final report 
will be submitted by July 2014. Pending the results of this study, treatment with ponatinib should be used 
with caution in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. 
Data is limited regarding the effect of age on ponatinib pharmacokinetics. 
There was no clinically significant effect of weight over the weight ranges studied.  
Once  daily  oral  dosing  of  ponatinib  to  patients  resulted  in  sustained  inhibition  of  BCR-ABL  signalling. 
Maximal activity, including in patients with T315I mutant BCR,  was seen at dose levels of 15 mg and 
above.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Ponatinib is a low solubility, high permeability (BCS class 2) compound.  Over the proposed clinical dose 
range of 15- 45 mg the exposure appears to be linear with a Cmax of 77 ng/ml (0.1 nM free) following 45 
mg.  Food does not have a significant effect on the exposure of ponatinib. 
Ponatinib is extensively metabolised with the majority of excretion in the faeces.  Enzymes responsible for 
the  metabolism  are  CYPs  (3A4,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  CYPs  2C8  and  2D6);  and  amidase/esterase 
hydrolysis in the gut.   Products of the hydrolytic cleavage are  the carboxylic  acid which is the major 
circulating metabolite and the aniline which does not circulate to any great extent but whose elimination 
has  not  been  fully  quantified.  Consistent  with  the  involvement  of  CYP3A4  in  the  elimination 
co-administration with ketoconazole results in an interaction (78% increase in AUC). 
In  in  vitro  studies,  ponatinib  does  not  inhibit  cytochrome  P450’s  or  the  drug  transporters,  OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OCT1, OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2, but it is an inhibitor of Pgp and BCRP with IC50s of 0.491 and 
0.013 µM. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The Applicant submitted two clinical studies relevant to the efficacy of ponatinib in the proposed 
indications. 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
This phase 1 study (AP24534-07-101) is ongoing in the United States. Patients were enrolled from 05 
June 2008 to 13 October 2010. The data presented includes data up to a cut-off date of 06 January 2012, 
and summarise observations made for a total of 81 eligible patients who were enrolled and received oral, 
once daily doses of ponatinib. At the time of analysis (23 March 2012), 33 patients (40.7%) remained on 
therapy, and median follow-up for all patients was 14.5 (0.4 to 41.0) months, and median follow-up for 
Ph+ leukaemia patients was 21.1 (0.5 to 41.1) months. 
Patients were sequentially assigned to starting dose level cohorts as they enrolled. Dose levels were 2 mg, 
4 mg, 8 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg, and 60 mg ponatinib once daily. Over the course of the study, patients 
were  escalated  and/or  de-escalated  (using  protocol-defined  criteria  to  manage  side  effects)  to  an 
appropriate dose of ponatinib. The starting dose of ponatinib was 2 mg/day. This dose level was selected 
on the basis of data obtained from the 28-day oral toxicology studies in rats and monkeys, as well as 
taking into consideration the prospective clinical trial patient population. The rationale for selecting the 
starting dose was as follows: an acceptable method for selecting the first dose of nonspecific cytotoxic 
agents for a first-in-human trial in cancer patients is to begin with a dose that is 1/10 of the lethal dose 
for 10% of animals (LD10) in mg/m2 in rodents, provided that this dose level is shown to be tolerated in 
a non-rodent species (DeGeorge et al, 1998). The LD10 of the 28-day regimen in rats was between 1.5 
mg/kg (9 mg/m2) and 3 mg/kg (18 mg/m2). Assuming human patients had a BSA of 1.7 m2, the lower 
BSA equivalent dose for humans was approximately 15 mg. Based on the rule of 1/10 of the LD10 in 
mg/m2 in rodents, the starting dose in humans would be somewhat higher than 1.5 mg. Therefore, 2 
mg/day represented a conservative and acceptable starting dose. 
No DLTs were observed in patients in cohorts up to 30 mg (cohort 5). In cohort 6, the next cohort, 60 mg 
was administered, and 4 DLTs were observed in 11 evaluable patients. The next cohort (cohort 7) was 45 
mg, and 1 DLT was observed in 12 DLT-evaluable patients. At this point, the cohort 7 tablet dosage form

was introduced, and 45 mg (cohort 8; no DLTs) and 60 mg (cohort 10; 2 DLTs) cohorts were enrolled. The 
DLTs observed in the pooled 45 and 60 mg cohorts are summarised in Table 10. 
Table 10: Dose escalation and summary of dose-limiting toxicity 
Pancreatic events were the most commonly occurring DLTs. Four patients treated at 60 mg daily had 
pancreas-related DLTs during the defined cycle 1 DLT evaluation period; these consisted of grade 3 or 4 
increased  lipase  and/or  blood  amylase  concurrent  with  clinical  evidence  of  pancreatitis.  Two  patients 
treated at 60 mg experienced other DLTs;  1 with grade 3 fatigue; and, 1  with grade 3  ALT and  AST 
increased. At 45 mg, there was 1 DLT of grade 3 maculo-papular rash.  
Of the 7 patients with DLTs, 3 continued study participation, 3 discontinued study treatments for reasons 
other than the DLT they experienced, and 1 discontinued due to the DLT.  
In summary, while some patients were able to tolerate 60 mg and remain on study at this dose, the safety 
data are consistent with 60 mg exceeding the MTD of 45 mg. No DLTs were reported in patients with AML 
or other hematologic malignancies.  
Some evidence of the activity of the lower doses is also available from the results, but the numbers of 
patients,  on  doses  lower  than  45  mg,  are  small.  However,  it  can  be  said  that  there  was  appreciable 
activity noted with the lower doses. (see table 11)

Study Participants  
Eligible patients had CML in CP, AP, or BP; or had Ph+ ALL. Patients either:  
1)  had disease that was resistant to, or were intolerant to, therapy with either dasatinib or nilotinib; 
or  
2)  had the BCR-ABL T315I mutation. 
Patients were to remain on treatment for as long as they continue to receive benefit from ponatinib or 
until disease progression, development of intolerance, patient withdrawal of consent, or decision by the 
investigator. Patients were grouped in the following cohorts.

daily. Patients were requested to take the prescribed number of tablets with or without food at 
approximately the same time each day. Patients were instructed not to eat or drink anything other than 
water for 2 hours after taking the tablets. Each 28-day dosing period is termed 1 cycle.  
Doses could be held for up to 28 days or reduced per the protocol to manage adverse reactions; lowest 
dose was 15 mg daily.

Sample size 
Cohort A (R/I CP-CML): 100 patients would provide at least 85% power to distinguish between a null 
response rate of 20% and an alternative response rate of 35%. 
Cohort B (T315I CP-CML): 60 patients would provide approximately 98% power to distinguish between a 
null response rate of 10% and an alternative response rate of 35%. 
Cohorts C to F (R/I and T315I AP-CML, and BP-CML/Ph+ ALL): 40 patients in each cohort (160 patients 
total) would provide approximately 89% power to distinguish between the null response rate of 10% and 
an alternative response rate of 30%. 
An anticipated higher relative proportion of R/I patients to T315I patients required over-enrolment of the 
R/I cohorts (Cohorts A, C, and E) to ensure full T315I patient enrolment. At the time of the most recent 
protocol amendment, it was anticipated that the trial would require up to 450 patients to ensure reaching 
the planned sample sizes of the T315I cohorts.

Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
This is an open label uncontrolled study. At enrolment patients were assigned to 1 of the 6 cohorts in 
accordance with disease diagnosis (CP-CML, AP-CML or BP-CML/Ph+ ALL) and, when the mutations test 
results were available, presence of the T315I mutation (yes or no). 
Statistical methods 
Regarding efficacy, each cohort of patients was to be analysed separately. No adjustments for multiplicity 
were applied. The primary endpoints of MCyR rate and MaHR rate respectively were analysed using a 
2-sided exact 95% confidence interval based on all treated patients. For primary and secondary analyses 
data handling rules were pre-defined for each cohort. Patients who did not meet the criteria for MCyR or 
the criteria for MaHR respectively were analysed as non-responders.  
Data handling rules cohort A and B 
For analyses of cytogenetic response, patients with <20 metaphases examined at baseline (including 
missing baseline cytogenetic assessments), or CCyR at baseline were analysed as non-responders in the 
primary analysis. For analyses of hematologic response (CHR), patients who entered the trial in CHR and 
continued to meet CHR criteria on study also were analysed as responders. For MMR, patients for whom 
Iclusig 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220290/2013 
Page 44/100 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a valid baseline MMR assessment was missing or who met the criteria for MMR at baseline were analysed 
as non-responders.  
Data handling rules cohort C through F 
For analyses of hematologic response (MaHR), patients for whom baseline bone marrow blasts could not 
be determined were analysed as non-responders, and patients who entered the trial in MaHR were 
analysed as non-responders in the primary analysis. For MMR measured in peripheral blood, patients for 
whom a valid baseline MMR assessment was missing or who met the criteria for MMR at baseline were 
analysed as non-responders. For BP-CML/Ph+ALL, MMR was also assessed in bone marrow—in this 
analysis, patients for whom a valid baseline MMR assessment was missing or who met the criteria for MMR 
at baseline were analysed according to their on-study assessments. For analyses of cytogenetic response, 
patients with <20 metaphases examined at baseline, CCyR at baseline, or missing baseline cytogenetic 
assessments were analysed as non-responders. 
In addition, patients should have showed response within 6 months (MaHR) or 12 months (MCyR) after 
initiation of study treatment, otherwise they were to be classified as non-responders. 
According to the Statistical Analysis Plan the primary analyses were to be based on the per protocol 
populations with sensitivity analyses based on the Treated population. The Treated population included all 
patients assigned to one of the Cohorts A through F who had received at least 1 dose of study drug. The 
per protocol cytogenetic population included all patients in the treated population with a baseline 
cytogenetic assessment with at least 20 metaphases examined. Patients with <20 metaphases examined 
at baseline, CCyR at baseline, or missing baseline cytogenetic assessments were excluded. The per 
protocol hematologic population included all patients in the treated population in Cohorts C through F with 
a baseline BM assessment for which the percentage of BM blasts was determinable. Patients with missing 
baseline bone marrow blasts or MaHR at baseline were excluded. 
Several sensitivity analyses were planned, among them one based on the original planned sample size in 
cohorts with an over-enrolment of patients.  
Duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival and time to response were estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method and, pre-defined censoring rules. 
Patients who were not confirmed to have a detectable T315I mutation and who were not resistant or 
intolerant to dasatinib or nilotinib were analysed separately. 
The Safety population included all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. In the analyses of 
safety, data from all cohorts were to be pooled.

Recruitment 
A total of 449 patients, whereof 444 eligible, were enrolled from 21 September 2010 to 04 October 2011. 
Patients were recruited at 68 sites in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, South Korea, 
United Kingdom, United States, the Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden.

Protocol deviations 
Major protocol deviations that occurred are summarised in the table below. 
Table 15: Major protocol deviations: safety population 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol was approved on 16 July 2010 (study initiation 21 September 2010) 
  Protocol Amendment 1 was dated 27 October 2010  
Response criteria were updated. 
  Protocol Amendment 2 was dated 08 April 2011  
As early enrolment experience demonstrated over-availability of R/I patients compared with T315I 
patients, the amendment served to increase the overall sample size of the study to allow for 
over-enrolment in the R/I cohorts to ensure full patient enrolment in the T315I cohorts. 
  Protocol Amendment 3 was dated 24 May 2012 
No important change.

Numbers analysed 
Predefined analysis populations included: 1) the safety population, 2) the treated population 3) the per 
protocol cytogenetic population, and 4) the per protocol hematologic population. 
The “safety population” (N=449) included all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
The “treated population” (N=444) included all patients assigned to Cohorts A through F who received at 
least 1 dose  of study drug. There were 267  CP-CML  patients (R/I  Cohort A:  n=203, T315I Cohort  B: 
n=64),  83  AP-CML  patients  (R/I  Cohort  C:  n=65,  T315I  Cohort  D:  n=18),  and  94  BP-CML/Ph+  ALL 
patients (R/I Cohort E: n=48, T315I Cohort F: n=46) in the treated population. 
The “per protocol cytogenetic population” included all patients in the treated population with a baseline 
cytogenetic assessment with at least 20 metaphases examined and who did not enter in CCyR. Patients 
whose baseline cytogenetic status was missing were excluded from the analysis. There were 265 CP-CML 
patients (R/I Cohort A: n=201, T315I Cohort B: n=64), 79 AP-CML patients (R/I Cohort C: n=62, T315I 
Cohort D: n=17), and 82 BP-CML/Ph+ ALL patients (R/I Cohort E: n=41, T315I Cohort F: n=41) in the per 
protocol cytogenetic population. 
The  per  protocol  hematologic  population  included  all  patients  in  the  treated  population  in  Cohorts  C 
through F with a baseline BM assessment for which the percentage of BM blasts was determinable and 
who did not have MaHR at baseline. There were 68 AP-CML patients (R/I Cohort C: n=53, T315I Cohort 
D:  n=15),  and  90  BP-CML/Ph+  ALL  patients  (R/I  Cohort  E:  n=46,  T315I  Cohort  F:  n=44)  in  the  per 
protocol hematologic population. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The  pivotal  study  being  a  non-randomised  study  has  the  limitation  of  not  having  a  comparator  arm. 
However an internal comparison is possible by looking at the study population previous response to the 
most recent other TKIs. This is summarised in the table below.

Table 23: Response by Prior TKI Therapy: Safety Population (Including Non-Cohort Assigned patients) 
For all 6 cohorts in the pivotal study, the pre-specified primary statistical criteria were met, as the 95% 
CIs of the primary endpoint response rates exceeded and exclude the pre-specified null (uninteresting) 
values set forth in the protocol. 
Ancillary analyses 
Time to response was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method for all patients and for responders only  
CP-CML:  For  the  combined  CP-CML  group,  the  median  time  to  MCyR  (responders  only)  was  84  days 
(range 49 to 334 days), and the median time to MMR (responders only) was 167 days (range 55 to 421 
days). 
AP-CML:  For  the  combined  AP-CML  group,  the  median  time  to  MaHR  (responders  only)  was  21  days 
(range 12 to 176 days), the median time to MCyR (responders only) was 111.5 days (range 25 to 295 
days), and the median time to MMR (responders only) was 113 days (range 55 to 343 days). 
BP-CML/Ph+ ALL: For the combined AP-CML group, the median time to MaHR (responders only) was 26.0 
days (range 11 to 168 days), the median time to MCyR (responders only) was 55 days (range 27 to 168 
days), and the median time to MMR (responders only) was 56 days (range 54 to 113 days). 
Duration  of  response  was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method as the probability of remaining in 
response measured in weeks. This is based on overall median durations of follow-up for Ph+ patients of 
14.7 (range 0.1 to 24.9) months with the phase 2 study; and 24.9 (range 0.48 to 44.1) months with the 
phase 1study. The results are summarised in the tables below.

Duration of MCyR and MMR in CP patients, and MaHR and MCyR in more advanced patients, 
per number of previous TKIs for each cohort in the 201 study: 
The TKIs in this analysis are the 3 TKIs that had received marketing authorization at the time the patients 
enrolled in the trial: imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. Overall, 29 patients in the treated population had 
1 prior TKI, 177 had 2 prior TKIs, and 237 had all 3 TKIs.

Progression-free Survival Kaplan-Meier curves were prepared for CP-CML, AP-CML and BP-CML/Ph+ 
ALL. At the time of analyses, the median follow-up, especially for CP-CML and AP-CML patients, was too 
limited to allow for meaningful conclusions from these data. A brief summary of the preliminary analysis 
to date (median follow-up 9.9 months) has been provided by the applicant. 
For CP-CML all patients combined, as well as individual cohorts R/I (Cohort A) and T315I (Cohort B), the 
median  PFS  has  not  yet  been  reached.  For  the  overall  CP-CML  group  (n=267),  the  probability  of 
maintaining PFS at week 26 and week 52 is estimated as 91.0% and 79.6%, respectively. For the R/I and 
T315I  cohorts,  the  probability  of  maintaining  PFS  at  week  26  is  estimated  as  91.6%  and  89.3%, 
respectively;  and,  the  probability  of  maintaining  PFS  at  week  52  is  estimated  as  77.7%  and  86.7%, 
respectively. 
For the overall AP-CML group (n=83), the median PFS is estimated as 79.9 weeks (range 6.0 to 80.0 
weeks),  and  the  probability  of  maintaining  PFS  at  week  26  and  week  52  is  estimated  as  80.1%  and 
56.9%, respectively (Figure 11-8). For the R/I and T315I cohorts, the probability of maintaining PFS at 
week 26 is estimated as 80.9% and 77.4%, respectively; and, the probability of maintaining PFS at week 
52 is estimated as 54.7% and 64.5%, respectively. 
The natural history of treated BP-CML and Ph+ ALL is marked by more rapid progression; therefore, the 
data for these cohorts are more conclusive. For the overall BP-CML/Ph+ ALL group (n=94), the median

CHMP assessment report

PFS is estimated as 17.9 weeks (range 0.1 to 64.1 weeks), and the probability of maintaining PFS at week 
26 and week 52 is estimated as 34.4% and  19.7%,  respectively. For the R/I  and T315I cohorts, the 
probability of maintaining PFS at week 26 is estimated as 34.4% and 19.7%, respectively. 
Overall survival (OS) Kaplan-Meier curves were prepared for CP-CML, AP-CML and BP-CML/Ph+ ALL.  
For CP-CML all patients combined, as well as individual cohorts R/I (Cohort A) and T315I (Cohort B), the 
median OS has not yet been reached. For the overall CP-CML group (n=267), the probability of OS at 
week 26 and week 52 is estimated as 97.3% and 93.5%, respectively. For the R/I and T315I cohorts, the 
probability of OS at week 26 is estimated as 96.9% and 98.4%, respectively; and, the probability of OS 
at week 52 is estimated as 94.4% and 90.2%, respectively. 
For AP-CML all patients combined, as well as individual cohorts R/I (Cohort C) and T315I (Cohort D), the 
median OS has not yet been reached. For the overall AP-CML group (n=83), and the probability of OS at 
week 26 and week 52 is estimated as 96.3% and 82.1%, respectively. For the R/I and T315I cohorts, the 
probability of OS at week 26 is estimated as 95.4% and 100%, respectively; and, the probability of OS at 
week 52 is estimated as 83.9% and 72.2%, respectively. 
For BP-CML and Ph+ ALL, the prognosis of relapsed disease is severe, and even with the relatively short 
follow-up available to date, the data are instructive. For the overall BP-CML/Ph+ ALL group (n=94), the 
median OS is estimated as 29.9 weeks (range 0.4 to 66.0 weeks), and the probability of OS at week 26 
and  week  52  is  estimated  as  54.3%  and  33.4%,  respectively.  For  the  R/I  and  T315I  cohorts,  the 
probability of OS at week 26 is estimated as 53.6% and 55.0%, respectively; and, the probability of OS 
at week 52 is estimated as 54.3% and 33.4%, respectively.  
Ancillary analyses 
Molecular  genetic  analyses  were  included  as  an  exploratory  endpoint.  These  data  are  still  being 
investigated  as  the  study  in  ongoing;  however,  preliminary  results  are  available  including  baseline 
molecular status and response by mutation. 
Overall,  the  most  frequent  BCR-ABL  mutations  reported  at  study  entry  were  T315I  (28.5%),  F317L 
(8.0%), E255K (4.0%), and F359V (3.8%).  
Cytogenetic  and  molecular  response  rates  for the  most  frequent  mutations  in  CP-CML  patients  were: 
74.0% and 50.0% for T315I; 50.0% and 36.4% for F317L; 46.2% and 23.1% for F359V; 62.5% and 
50.0% for E255K; and 75.0% and 37.5% for G250E, respectively.  
Patients with no detectable BCR-ABL mutations also responded: 46.3% MCyR and 19.1% MMR. 
In CP-CML patients, 16 different mutations were detected in ≥2 patients at study entry. 
At the time of analysis (median follow-up 9.9 months), for every individual mutation that was detected at 
least twice at entry (i.e., 16 different mutations) a response was achieved in at least 1 patient. 
Patients with no mutations in BCR-ABL also responded: CP-CML- MCyR 46.3% and MMR 19.1%.

description 
The “safety population” (N=449) included all patients who received at 
least 1 dose of study drug.  
The “treated population” (N=444) included all patients assigned to 
Cohorts A through F who received at least 1 dose of study drug. There 
were 267 CP-CML patients (R/I Cohort A: n=203, T315I Cohort B: 
n=64), 83 AP-CML patients (R/I Cohort C: n=65, T315I Cohort D: 
n=18), and 94 BP-CML/Ph+ ALL patients (R/I Cohort E: n=48, T315I 
Cohort F: n=46) in the treated population. 
The  results  presented  below  are  those  observed  with  the 
treated population. 
At  the  time  of  analysis  (27  April  2012),  252  patients  (56.1%)  were 
ongoing, mostly CP-CML (n=185) or AP-CML (n=56).

Supportive study 
The dose finding study AP24534-07-101 contains endpoints supportive of the efficacy (see also section 
2.5.1).  
Enrolled  patients  had  advanced  haematological  malignancies  (e.g.,  leukaemia,  multiple  myeloma), 
including CML that had relapsed, or was refractory to standard chemotherapy or approved TKIs, or for 
which no standard therapy was available. Overall, 65 patients had Ph+ leukaemia. These included 60 CML 
(43 CP-CML, 9 AP-CML and 8 BP-CML) and 5 Ph+ ALL.  
Of the 65 Ph+ patients, 18 (27.7%) had no mutations at study entry, 37 (56.9%) had 1 mutation, 5 
(7.7%) had 2 mutations, and 5 (7.7%) had no sequencing data. The most frequent BCR-ABL mutations 
reported at study entry were T315I (29.2%), F317L (10.8%), and G250E (6.2%). 
This patient population was characterised by haematologic malignancy that was refractory or resistant to 
available therapy or for which no therapies were available. Ph+ patients were heavily treated with prior 
TKIs  and  conventional  therapies.  The  most  frequently  reported  prior  cancer  treatments  in  CP-CML 
patients included approved TKIs, imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, as well as hydroxyurea, interferon,

cytarabine, and omacetaxine. Only 1  CP-CML patient had  a prior  SCT,  as  well  as 1  patient  each with 
BP-CML and Ph+ ALL. 
At the time of analysis, out of the 65 Ph+ patients, 42 (64.6%) had CHR, 38 (58.5%) had MCyR, and 21 
(32.3%) had MMR. Of note, molecular responses were deep with 15.4% of patients experiencing MR4 and 
4.6% CMR4.5. 
Of 43 CP-CML patients,  31 CP-CML patients achieved  a MCyR  with  a  median duration of follow-up of 
25.3 months (range: 1.7 to 38.4 months). At the time of reporting, 25 CP-CML patients were in MCyR 
(median duration of MCyR had not been reached).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application is based on a phase I dose-finding study and an open single-arm phase II study with a 
total of 6 cohorts; R/I or T315I+ patients with CP-CML, AP-CML, and BP/Ph+ ALL disease, respectively. 
The limitations of single arm open labelled studies are known. In this case the criteria, when a single arm 
study might be acceptable, have been previously discussed in the CHMP scientific advice given to the 
applicant.  Design  and  endpoints  were  discussed  with  SAWP  and  although  generally  accepted  it  was 
concluded that a non-comparative design may not be acceptable for patients resistant or intolerant to a 
second-line agent without a BCR-ABL mutation and the sponsor was cautioned that results barely meeting 
the statistical objectives may not support regulatory approval.  
Iclusig 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220290/2013 
Page 69/100 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is here noted that the final alternative response rate for the CP-CML R/I cohort was lowered from 40% 
at the time of the advice to 35%. However, it is important to note that the observed response rates far 
exceed both these limits. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In  the  pivotal  phase  II  study,  at  a  median  follow-up  of  14.5 months,  ponatinib  exhibited  clinically 
meaningful responses in all stages of Ph+ leukaemia in this heavily pre-treated patient population, which 
is consistent with the preliminary findings of the phase 1 study. 
At the time of analysis, median duration of Iclusig treatment was 281 days in CP-CML patients, 286 days 
in AP-CML patients, 89 days in BP-CML patients, and 81 days in patients with Ph+ ALL. 
This patient population was characterised by Ph+ leukaemia patients who were resistant or intolerant to 
prior  dasatinib  or  nilotinib;  were  heavily  pre-treated  with  prior  TKIs  and  convention  therapy;  were 
relatively  advanced  in  their  diagnosis  (median  time  since  diagnosis  was  6.1 years);  and  54.8%  had 
BCR-ABL resistance mutations confirmed at entry, including T315I. Overall, the majority of patients were 
resistant (87.6%); only 11.7% were purely intolerant to prior dasatinib or nilotinib therapy. 
Most patients had exhausted available TKI options and conventional therapies, and best response to most 
recent prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy has been highlighted. 
The response rates achieved in each of the 6 study cohorts met the pre-specified statistical criteria for 
success.  For all cohorts, the estimated rate exceeded the pre-specified interesting value. 
In CP-CML, 16 different mutations were detected in ≥2 patients at entry; for all 16 of these mutations, 
there was at least 1 response, which is consistent with the pan-BCR-ABL inhibitor activity of ponatinib 
observed in vitro. 
Ponatinib had efficacy in both groups of patients included in the study (i.e., R/I and T315I cohorts).   
There were significantly higher response rates in patients who were less heavily treated.  All patients who 
failed prior TKI therapies demonstrated responses, and response rates in CP-CML patients. Of the CP-CML 
patients previously treated with one, two, or three prior TKIs, 81% (13/16), 61% (65/105), and 46% 
(66/143) achieved a MCyR while on Iclusig, respectively. 
Responses  were  found  to be  durable; the  median  duration  of  response  has  not  yet been  reached  for 
CP-CML patients.  
Generally the data shows that, in study 201, the populations with dose reductions or dose interruption or 
both, did not perform inferior in terms of primary and secondary endpoints or probability of remaining in 
response of the primary endpoint at 12 months in relation to the corresponding overall population; the 
exception being AP patients where, overall, 50% with MaHR were estimated to retain their response at 12 
months, compared with 39% among AP-CML patients with dose reductions and 45% among patients with 
reductions/interruptions 
It is noted that the MaHR rates and probability of remaining at response at 12 months were superior in the 
above sub-populations BP/Ph+ ALL  compared  to the  corresponding overall population. This variability 
could be because of the small numbers of patients with adjustments, or because patients in this disease 
group  who  do  not  continue  on  therapy  with  dose  adjustments  have  discontinued  due  to  disease 
progression. 
A post hoc multivariate analysis (data not shown) examining the impact of several predictor variables and 
outcomes in the CP-CML population in the phase 2 study was performed.  Dose intensity and patient age 
were  significant  predictors  for  MCyR  in  CP-CML  patients.    The  number  of  prior  TKIs  and  time  since 
Iclusig 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220290/2013 
Page 70/100 
 
 
 
 
 
 
diagnosis trended toward significance.  Increasing response rate was therefore correlated with increased 
dose  intensity,  younger  age,  fewer  prior  therapies,  and  less  time  since  diagnosis.    Notably,  T315I 
mutation status is not an independent predictor of response, despite the higher response rates observed 
in  Cohort  B.    This  may  be  explained  by  the  significant  association  between  dose  intensity  and  T315I 
status, and between age and T315I status.  The T315I CP-CML patients are younger and tolerate higher 
doses. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The findings in the pivotal phase 2 study were consistent with, and confirm, the initial activity findings of 
ponatinib in the phase 1 setting.  The magnitude of response rates shown in the two clinical studies is 
considered clinically relevant, especially for, but not restricted to, CML patients harbouring the T315I 
mutation. Ponatinib has demonstrated efficacy in heavily pre-treated Ph+ leukaemia patients in all 
stages of disease, i.e., patients who have received dasatinib/ nilotinib as second line or further line TKI 
therapy; and in patients with the T315I mutation. 
It is noted that, in the pivotal study, there are very few patients without the T315I mutation that 
received only one line of therapy with either dasatinib or nilotinib. However considering the broader 
target activity of dasatinib and nilotinib, treatment with imatinib following failure of first line treatment 
with these agents, is considered inappropriate. Therefore the use of ponatinib would be a viable option, 
and has been taken into consideration in the wording of the indication. 
Another issue to be noted is that nilotinib is not approved for the treatment of Ph+ ALL, although 
patients with Ph+ ALL pre-treated with nilotinib have been included in the pivotal study. This fact was 
taken into consideration in the wording of the indication. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Five clinical studies of ponatinib have been conducted and are included in this dossier: 2 in patients and 
3 in healthy subjects. In all, 530 patients and 53 healthy subjects have received ponatinib through these 
studies. 
In addition, an expanded access program is providing ponatinib to patients through individual patient 
treatment INDs in the United States (US); Named Patient Programs (NPPs) in Europe, Australia, Canada, 
and Singapore; and an expanded access protocol in the US (AP24534-12-901). As of 03 June 2012, 212 
patients have been approved to receive ponatinib through the INDs and NPPs. As of 28 June 2012, 18 
patients have enrolled at 3 sites in the expanded access protocol. 
Finally,  2  investigator-sponsored  trials  (ISTs)  are  underway  with  14  patients  enrolled  according  to 
updates received as of 01 July 2012: “Phase II Study of Combination of Hyper-CVAD and Ponatinib in 
Patients  With  Philadelphia  (PH)  Chromosome  Positive  and/or  BCR-ABL  Positive  Acute  Lymphoblastic 
Leukaemia (ALL)” being conducted by Dr. Susan O'Brien (M.D. Anderson Cancer Centre, Houston, Texas, 
United States); and “Ponatinib as Initial Therapy for Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia in Chronic 
Phase”  being  conducted  by  Dr.  Jorge  Cortes  (M.D.  Anderson  Cancer  Centre,  Houston,  Texas,  United 
States). 
Safety results from the 3 healthy-subject studies and SAEs from the expanded access program and ISTs 
have been discussed briefly by the applicant. The main discussion provided was the description of the 
safety results from each of the 2 studies in patients and a display and discussion of safety analyses from

Note:  Adverse events are coded using MedDRA v 15.0 and graded according to NCI CTCAE v 3.0 for AP24534-07-101 
and CTCAE v 4.03 for AP24534-10-201.  Only treatment-emergent adverse events with a start date on or after 
the first dose of study drug are reported.  For patients who experience the same coded event more than once at 
each level of summarization, the greatest NCI-CTCAE grade is presented.  System organ classes are included 
only if they contain preferred terms meeting the cut-off defined in the table title.  Clinically synonymous terms 
have been recoded to single MedDRA preferred terms. 
AE = Adverse event, n = number of patients, No. = number. 
Adverse events that occurred in at least 20% of patients were decreased platelet count, rash, abdominal 
pain, headache, constipation, dry skin, fatigue, arthralgia, nausea, pyrexia, decreased neutrophil count, 
hypertension, and anaemia. 
Adverse  events  that  reached  grade  ≥3  in  >10%  of  patients  overall  were  decreased  platelet  count, 
decreased neutrophil count, anaemia, and increased lipase.   
Pancreatitis, which was identified in the phase 1 study as the DLT, occurred in 39 patients (7.4%), with 27 
patients’ pancreatitis reaching grade 3 (5.1%; no grade 4). 
Most adverse events occurred with similar incidence across disease groups; however, a few differences of 
note were seen.  Decreased platelet count occurred in fewer patients with BP-CML/Ph+ ALL (26.2%) than 
in patients with CP-CML or AP-CML (41.9% and 46.8%, respectively).   
A lower percentage of patients with CP-CML (18.2%) reported decreased neutrophil count than patients 
with the advanced phases (AP-CML: 28.7%; BP-CML/Ph+ ALL: 29.9%).  Similarly, febrile neutropenia 
Iclusig 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220290/2013 
Page 76/100 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increased with increasing disease severity (CP-CML: 1.9%; AP-CML: 4.3%; BP-CML/Ph+ ALL: 20.6%).  
The percentage of patients with anaemia increased with increasing disease severity (CP-CML: 13.7%; 
AP-CML: 27.7%; BP-CML/Ph+ ALL: 29.9%).   
These results are consistent with those seen in the 2 studies individually. 
There are certain adverse events of interest that have been discussed by the applicant. These are adverse 
events that are either common with ponatinib or known to occur with this class of TKIs. These include 
myelosuppression  and  related  events,  pancreatic  events,  hepatic  events,  cardiac  events,  ischemic 
vascular events, oedema and fluid retention, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. 
Myelosuppression:  Myelosuppression was a frequent laboratory finding and reported adverse event in 
the  ponatinib  clinical  program.  A  major  manifestation  of  intolerance  to  prior  therapy  is  also 
myelosuppression,  either  due  to  the  interaction  between  underlying  disease  and  the  treatment,  or 
induced by the treatment itself. 
Infections  were  reported  in  over  half  of  patients.    Infections,  like  myelosuppressive  events,  are  a 
characteristic  feature  of  the  natural  history  of  leukaemia,  and  they  are  predisposed  by  either 
disease-related or iatrogenic bone marrow depletion.  In this program, in most patients the infections 
were non-serious upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infections.  Serious 
infections  were  reported  in  approximately  19%  of  patients  with  most  of  these  patients  experiencing 
pneumonia/lung infection  and sepsis (including  neutropenic sepsis and bacteraemia), typically due to 
organisms associated with hospital acquired infections.  Opportunistic infections (OI) were reported in 
only 1.3% of patients.  Of the patients with an OI, most had been on treatment for <4 months, had 
advanced  disease  (AP-CML,  BP-CML,  Ph+ ALL,  and  AML)  or  severe  neutropenia  at  baseline.  
Approximately 3% of patients had a fatal infection, all of whom had either advanced disease and/or low 
neutrophil  counts.    Gram-negative  sepsis  and/or  pneumonia  was  the  most  common  cause  of  fatal 
infection;  opportunistic  infections  (e.g.,  systemic  zygomycosis,  fungal  pneumonia  (not  otherwise 
specified), and Pneumocystis pneumonia) were reported in a few patients with fatal infection. 
Bleeding  events were commonly reported, with 25% of patients experiencing at least one event.  In 
most patients, however the event was classified as either grade 1 or 2.  The most commonly reported 
preferred terms were epistaxis (6.6% of patients), petechiae (4.2% of patients), and ecchymoses (2.8% 
of  patients).    Serious  bleeding  events  were  reported  in  4.9%  of  patients.    The  incidence  of  serious 
bleeding events was higher in patients with AP-CML (8.5%) and BP-CML/Ph+ ALL (10.3%) compared to 
those  with  CP-CML  (1.3%).    Cerebral  haemorrhage  and  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage  were  the  most 
commonly  reported  serious  bleeding  events,  as  well  as  the  most  commonly  reported  fatal  bleeding 
events.  Fatal bleeding events were reported in 1.3% of patients. 
Pancreatic Events: Reversible pancreatitis with pancreatic enzyme abnormality was the DLT from the 
phase 1 study.  Overall in the pooled safety populations of Studies 101 and 201, 129 patients (24.3%) 
had pancreatic events.  These events reached grade 3 or 4 severity for 78 patients (14.7%); no events 
were fatal (grade 5). The most commonly reported pancreatic events were increased lipase (17.4% of 
patients; grade 3 or 4: 10.4%), pancreatitis (7.4%; grade 3 or 4: 5.1%), increased amylase  (4.9%; 
grade 3 or 4: 2.1%), and increased blood bilirubin (3.0%; grade 3 or 4: 0.9%).  Increased lipase and 
increased amylase were often accompanied by pancreatitis. Overall, 36 patients (6.8%) had pancreatic 
related serious adverse events. 
The phase 1 protocol allowed no dose modifications for grade 1 or 2 toxicities attributable to study drug, 
unless the event was intolerable and not controlled by optimal supportive care.  Grade 3 or 4 toxicities 
attributed to study drug could be managed by a combination of dose reduction to one level lower and dose 
delay of up to 2 weeks.  Dose  re-escalation was allowed upon  agreement  with the sponsor’s medical 
Iclusig

Page 77/100 
 
 
 
 
 
 
monitor if the patient had recovered and would benefit from the escalated dose.  The phase 2 protocol 
similarly restricted dose modifications to grade 3 or 4 events but had specific guidelines for pancreatic 
toxicities.  Namely, for grade 2 pancreatitis with mild symptoms or radiologic findings, ponatinib was to be 
held  until  resolution  by  imaging,  and  then  resumed  at  the  current  dose.    For  grade  3  pancreatitis, 
ponatinib was to be withheld and upon resolution restarted at one dose level lower.  For grade 3 or 4 
amylase or lipase elevations, ponatinib was withheld, and if (or once) imaging was negative or showed 
resolution, the dose was resumed at the next-lower level (i.e., 45 to 30; 30 to 15 mg). 
Of the 35 patients with pancreatic SAEs, 1 had study drug permanently withdrawn, 2 had no action taken, 
1 had a dose reduction, and 31 had study drug temporarily discontinued at least once. 
Hepatic  Events:  Overall,  138  patients  (26.0%)  had  at  least  one  adverse  event  from  the  SMQ 
(standardised MedRA Query) for hepatotoxicity; 55 (10.4%) had events that reached grade 3 or 4 in 
severity.  No hepatic adverse events had a fatal (grade 5) outcome. 
14 patients (2.6%) were identified as having SAEs in the hepatotoxicity SMQ. Based on liver enzyme 
levels and other assessments concurrent with some of the SAEs, 8 of these 14 patients did not appear to 
have  SAEs  of  hepatotoxicity.  The  remaining  6  patients  did  have  hepatotoxicity  SAEs  while  on  study 
treatment. Study drug was interrupted for all 6 cases.  Study drug was restarted for 4 patients and did not 
restart  for  2  patients  (1  due  to  disease  progression;  and  1  due  to  physician’s  decision).  The  events 
recurred  for  3  patients  after  restarting  study  drug.    Outcomes  were  favourable,  and  all  6  patients 
recovered from serious hepatotoxic events. 
Possible Hy’s Law cases (patients at increased risk of drug-induced liver failure as outlined are defined as 
patients with ALT or AST >3 × ULN, with ALP <2 × ULN and total bilirubin (TBL) ≥2 × ULN with no other 
aetiology to explain these liver-function test results.  There were 2 patients who at a single time point met 
all the laboratory criteria for Hy’s Law cases.  These patients both had confounding underlying conditions. 
Cardiac Events: 
Approved BCR-ABL inhibitors are associated with congestive failure/left ventricular dysfunction (Glivec) 
and conduction abnormalities (QT prolongation) (dasatinib; nilotinib).  
The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  event  term  in  the  congestive  failure/left  ventricular 
dysfunction (CF/LVD) query was the nonspecific event of oedema peripheral (14.7%). Serious CF/LVD 
events  were  reported  in  4%  of  patients  with  cardiac  failure  congestive  reported  in  1.5%  of  patients, 
cardiac failure in 0.9% of patients and ejection fraction decreased in 0.9% of patients 
Rate and Rhythm Disorders- The most commonly reported arrhythmia was tachycardia with 4.5 %.  
Most  of  these  events  were  non-serious  and  assessed  as  grade  1  or  2.    The  second  most  commonly 
reported arrhythmia was atrial fibrillation (4.3%), followed by electrocardiogram QT prolonged (2.5%), 
and palpitations (2.1%).  All other arrhythmia events were reported at an incidence of approximately 1% 
or less. 
The AE of QT prolongation was reported in 13 patients (2.5%).  Of the 13 patients, 7 patients were from 
AP24534-07-101  in  which  centralized  ECG  monitoring  in  triplicate  and  pharmacokinetic  data  were 
collected. The other 6 patients with an AE of QT prolongation were from Study AP24534-10-201 in which 
no centralized ECG monitoring was performed.  
Of these 6 patients, one patient had a QTcF increase 48 ms above baseline.   
Of the remaining 5 patients, 1 had an increase of unreported duration, and 4 had an increase in QTcF of 
>60 msec from baseline.

Although  investigators  considered  4 of  the  5  cases to  be treatment-related,  an  analysis  of  each  case 
shows that based on either negative rechallenge with study treatment or resolution of the event with 
continued dosing these events were most likely not related to ponatinib. One patient had not received any 
ponatinib for 1 week prior to event onset.  Given the half-life of ponatinib and the fact that restart of 
ponatinib did not lead to recurrence, the event was unlikely related to study drug.  One patient, who had 
a prior history of prolonged QT, developed an increase in QTcF of 82 msec above baseline.  Ponatinib was 
temporarily  discontinued  and  restarted  with  no  recurrence  of  the  event.    Two  patients  developed  a 
prolonged QT that resolved and did not recur, despite continuation of their dosing regimen.  One patient, 
with a history of AV node block, right bundle branch block, and a pacemaker, developed QT prolongation.  
Although a final outcome was not reported, ponatinib was continued for another 3 weeks, suggesting that 
the event was probably not related to study treatment. 
Cardiac  arrest,  syncope,  and  ventricular  events:    Patients  who  experienced  a  cardiac  arrest, 
ventricular event, or serious syncopal event were reviewed and nearly all of the patients had pre-existing 
cardiac disease, infection, or severe dehydration.  None of the patients developed QT-prolongation during 
the study. 
Ischemic Vascular Events: An ischemic vascular event was reported in approximately 11% of patients, 
and serious ischemic vascular events were reported in 6%.  All of the patients with an ischemic event had 
at least one cardiovascular risk factor and the majority had multiple risk factors (e.g., >65 years of age, 
male gender, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia).   
Most serious ischemic events were cardiovascular in nature with myocardial infarction reported in 2.6% of 
patients.    The  observed  incidence  of  coronary  ischemic  events  is  possibly  explained  by  the  multiple 
confounding factors in these patients, but the role of ponatinib in the development of these events cannot 
be determined at this time.   
Cerebral  infarction  was  reported  in  1.3%  of  patients,  and  a  serious  peripheral  ischemic  event  was 
reported in <1% of patients.  Given the observed incidence of peripheral and cerebrovascular ischemic 
events  in  this  study,  the  population  demographics,  and  the  individual  patient  histories,  a  causal 
relationship of ponatinib to the development of these conditions appears unlikely. 
Fluid  retention  adverse  events  were  reported  in  approximately  one-quarter  of  the  patients;  most 
patients experienced grade 1 or 2 events (21.2%).  The patients who developed serious fluid retention 
events  (2.5%)  often  had  confounding  conditions  (e.g.,  pneumonia,  congestive  cardiac  failure,  prior 
dasatinib exposure).  Most patients recovered from their SAEs with or without drug interruption within a 
month.   
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders were commonly reported, and the majority of the events 
were  non-serious.    One  patient  discontinued  due  to  non-serious  exfoliative  rash.    Seven  patients 
experienced SAEs that were considered related to study drug; all recovered except one patient (who died 
of sepsis).  There were no reports of serious skin toxicity such as Stevens Johnson syndrome or toxic 
epidermal necrolysis.  
Pulmonary arterial hypertension 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has been reported with dasatinib. In responses to questions the 
Applicant presented all cases observed in the ponatinib development programme. These included 11 AEs 
of PAH, 10 from AP24534-07-101 and AP24534-10-201, and 1 from the expanded access program. 
Following assessment of these cases it is concluded that there is currently no evidence at the present 
time to suggest a class effect for ponatinib with regard to pulmonary hypertension. An alternative 
aetiology or contributory factor for pulmonary hypertension was identified in all 11 cases identified in the 
Iclusig 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220290/2013 
Page 79/100 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ponatinib development programme and no consistent pattern in the temporal relationship between the 
start of ponatinib therapy and the onset of pulmonary hypertension was seen. Of the 10 patients whose 
TKI history was reported, 9 had prior dasatinib, for which an association with pulmonary hypertension 
has been reported in the medical literature. 
Exploratory analyses 
An analysis of time periods when patients with advanced disease stages were in complete haematological 
response  and  patients  with  CP-CML  had  achieved  major  cytogenetic  response,  i.e.  periods  when  the 
adverse events of the disease are expected to be less prominent, showed that the frequency of adverse 
events reported during these periods were considerably lower than in the overall analysis.

The  most  common  non-disease-progression-related  serious  adverse  events  were  pneumonia  and 
pancreatitis (5.8% of patients for each).   
Fatal  (grade  5)  serious  adverse  events  included  infection-related  events  (pneumonia,  sepsis,  septic 
shock,  and  pyrexia);  cardiac  events  (congestive  cardiac  failure,  cardiac  failure,  acute  myocardial 
infarction,  cardiac  arrest);  and  bleeding  events  (intracranial  haemorrhage,  haemorrhagic  gastritis, 
haemorrhagic cerebral infarction, ischemia).

The overall incidence of serious adverse events by disease group increased with increasing severity of 
disease  (CP-CML:  41.5%;  AP-CML:  57.4%;  BP-CML/Ph+  ALL:  81.3%).    Although  individual  serious 
adverse events occurred in few patients, a trend is seen of increasing infection-related serious adverse 
events with increasing disease severity.   
The  percentages  of  patients  with  the  following  events  in  the  CP-CML,  AP-CML,  and  BP-CML/Ph+ ALL 
disease groups, respectively were:  pneumonia: 2.6%, 8.5%, 9.3%; febrile neutropenia: 1.0%, 3.2%, 
12.1%; and sepsis: 0.6%, 2.1%, 5.6%.  These results may be due to the higher incidence of neutropenia 
seen in the more-advanced disease groups. 
These results are consistent with those seen in the 2 studies individually. 
Deaths were reported up to the time of the data cut-off for each study. For the purpose of the safety 
evaluation,  the  applicant  has  summarised  deaths  that  occurred  within  30  days  after  the  last  dose  of 
ponatinib  or  if  they  occurred  after  this  window  and  are  considered  at  least  possibly  related  to  study 
treatment.   
Across both studies, 66 patients died within the 30-day window or had a related death more than 30 days 
after  the  last  dose.    The  total  percentage  of  patients  with  deaths  in  this  time  frame  increased  with 
increasing disease severity, mostly due to disease progression events.  Twenty-eight of the deaths (17 in 
the  BP-CML/Ph+ ALL  disease  group)  were  due  to  the  neoplasm  progression  (all  unrelated  to  study 
treatment).   
Of the remaining 38 deaths, 5 (all from AP24534-10-201) were considered at least possibly related to 
study treatment (1 of these deaths was outside the 30-day time frame).

chromosome-positive, WBC=white blood cells. 
Immunological events 
One case of grade 2 hypogammaglobulinemia was reported among the 530 patients in the phase 1 and 2 
trials. The patient continued on study drug, with no adverse event of infection. Decreased lymphocyte 
count was reported in 2% of patients. 
Safety in special populations 
Gender 
The  most  common  adverse  events,  including  decreased  platelet  count,  rash,  and  headache  generally 
occurred with similar incidences between genders in the patient population overall and by disease group.  
Pancreatitis also occurred with similar incidence between the groups.   
Overall, there was a higher incidence of decreased neutrophil count in women than in men (26.6% vs. 
18.8%); this difference held true for CP-CML and AP-CML (CP-CML: 23.0% vs. 13.9%; AP-CML: 39.2% 
vs. 16.3%), but not for BP-CML/Ph+ ALL (22.5% vs. 34.3%).   
Urinary tract infections were seen with higher incidence in women than in men (15.3% versus 1.8%).  
Other differences were slight, in events that were seen at low incidences, and were not seen consistently 
across disease groups.

Individual events (any grade) that appear to occur with progressively higher incidence with increasing 
age  included  decreased  platelet  count  (37.1%,  34.5%,  42.6%,  51.1%),  anaemia  (16.9%,  15.8%, 
25.0%, 33.3%), peripheral oedema (11.2%, 15.8%, 15.4%, 22.2%), increased lipase (9.6%, 18.1%, 
24.3%,  24.4%),  dyspnoea  (5.1%,  12.9%,  17.6%,  20.0%),  asthenia  (8.4%,  10.5%,  11.8%,  26.7%), 
muscle spasms (9.6%, 11.1%, 11.8%, 20.0%), and decreased appetite (7.3%, 8.2%, 15.4%, 22.2%).   
Events  that  occurred  with  higher  incidence  in  the  oldest  age  group  compared  with  the  other  groups 
included pneumonia and pruritus.  These trends were generally consistent across disease groups.  
Increased  alanine  aminotransferase  and  aspartate  aminotransferase  levels  occurred  with  decreasing 
incidence  from  the  youngest  to  oldest  age  group;  this  trend  was  also  seen  in  the  CP-CML  and 
BP-CML/Ph+ ALL disease groups. 
Febrile neutropenia occurred with the highest incidence in the youngest age group (14.0% versus 3.5% 
to 4.4%).  The trend was not seen in every disease group, possibly because of low overall incidence and 
low patient numbers in each group. 
Overall,  a  slight  increase  in  the  percentage  of  patients  experiencing  grade  ≥3  events  is  seen  with 
increasing age.  Incidence of Grade 3 increased lipase was higher with increasing age (5.1%, 10.5%, 
15.4%, 15.6%), and Grade ≥3 dehydration was highest in the oldest age group (11.1% vs. 0 to 1.8%).  
Most individual adverse events that reached grade ≥3 occurred with similar incidence across age groups. 
An overall trend was seen toward more total serious adverse events in the higher age groups.  Though the 
numbers of patients experiencing these AEs are low, the following observations are made with increasing

age:    a  higher  incidence  of  serious  pneumonia  and  a  lower  incidence  of  serious  febrile  neutropenia.  
Abdominal pain and headache were serious in slightly more young patients than old, while the overall 
incidence  of  these  events  (serious  and  non-serious)  was  similar  across  age  groups.    Cardiac  serious 
adverse  events  of  atrial  fibrillation,  myocardial  infarction,  acute  myocardial  infarction,  cardiac  arrest, 
congestive cardiac failure, and cardiac failure occurred with higher incidence in the oldest age groups, as 
did dehydration and hyponatremia. 
Race 
Race subgroups collected were the following: American Indian / Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African 
American, White, Other, and Unknown 
Adverse events occurred with similar incidences across race subgroups.   
Prior Approved TKIs 
The  number  of  patients  receiving  only  1  prior  approved  TKI  (N=40)  was  much  lower  than  patients 
receiving 2 (N=203) or 3 (N=270) prior approved TKIs.  Therefore, any differences observed between this 
group and the others could be due to variability caused by the small population size. 
An increase is seen with increasing number of prior TKIs in the percentage of patients with any and with 
grade ≥3 decreased platelet count.  This tendency was also seen in the AP-CML and BP-CML/Ph+ ALL 
disease groups, but was not as prominent in the CP-CML disease group.  Anaemia and lipase increases 
were slightly more common with increasing prior TKI.  Most other events occurred with similar incidence 
across subgroups. 
Time since Diagnosis 
Patients were divided into tertiles based on time since diagnosis (0 to <3.2 years; 3.2 to <8.8 years; 8.8 
to <28 years).  The incidence of most AEs was similar across tertiles.  The incidence of decreased platelet 
count (any grade or grade ≥3) was higher with increasing time since diagnosis.  This tendency was also 
seen in patients with CP-CML and AP-CML, but not in patients with BP-CML/Ph+ ALL.  Peripheral oedema, 
dyspnoea,  asthenia,  and  muscle  spasms  increased  slightly  with  increasing  time  since  diagnosis;  this 
observation  was  consistent  across  disease groups  for  most  of  these  events.    Urinary  tract  infections, 
pleural effusion, and pruritus were slightly higher in the longest tertile.  Patients with a longer time since 
diagnosis  are  also  more  likely  to  be  older  and  to  have  received  more  treatment  regimens  than 
more-recently diagnosed patients. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Preclinical data suggest that cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is involved in the human metabolism of 
ponatinib.  In the clinical studies in patients, concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors was discouraged, but 
not prohibited.  Therefore, a study was conducted to determine whether concurrent administration of the 
CYP3A4  inhibitor  ketoconazole  would  inhibit  the  metabolism  of  a  single  dose  of  ponatinib  in  healthy 
subjects (AP24534-11-103). 
Concurrent administration of multiple doses of ketoconazole with single-dose ponatinib (15 mg) resulted 
in a 78% and 47% increase in plasma ponatinib AUC0-∞ and Cmax, respectively, without affecting time to 
achieve maximum plasma concentrations.  Multiple-dose ketoconazole co-administration also resulted in 
a 70% decrease in plasma exposure to AP24567 (a metabolite of ponatinib).

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Thirteen patients (16.0%) in the phase 1 study discontinued due to AEs. The 15 events leading to these 
13 patients’ discontinuations were pancreatitis (2 patients), increased lipase, cardiomyopathy, pyrexia, 
headache,  staphylococcal  eye 
infection, 
intracranial  haemorrhage,  graft-versus-host  disease, 
neutropenia  (1  patient  each),  and,  in  1  patient,  the  3  events  of  bone  pain,  febrile  neutropenia,  and 
petechiae. 
Fifty  patients  (11.1%)  discontinued  the  phase  2  study  due  to  an  AE;  an  additional  14  patients  had 
progressive disease coded as an AE leading to discontinuation (total summarized in the discontinuation 
due to AEs = 64). Decreased platelet count (18 patients; 4%) and neoplasm progression (14; 3%, coded 
as  AEs)  were  the  2  most  common  events  leading  to  discontinuation  in  these  64  patients.  Decreased 
platelet count was evenly distributed across disease groups. Neoplasm progression was a more common 
reason for discontinuation with increasing disease severity (CP-CML: 1.1%; AP-CML: 4.7%; BP-CML/Ph+ 
ALL:  7.4%).  Most  other  AEs  led  to  discontinuation  for  1  patient  each  and  included  laboratory 
abnormalities, other disease progression terms, cardiac events, cerebrovascular events, and infections. 
Only 1 patient discontinued due to pancreatitis, and 1 patient due to skin conditions. 
The off-treatment platelet values in the 18 patients (3.4%) who discontinued due to decreased platelet 
count were analysed per request by the CHMP. Some degree of recovery was seen in 13 of 18 patients 
after discontinuation of ponatinib (in 5 cases to normal platelet levels). The fact that two patients had 
decreasing values following discontinuation may be most likely explained by the underlying disease. It 
was  also  noted  that  several  patients  entering  the  study  with  low  platelets  (due  to  disease)  achieved 
normal values during some period under therapy, indicating a treatment effect.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The most common serious adverse reactions >1% (treatment-emergent frequencies) were pancreatitis 
(5.1%), abdominal pain (3.6%), pyrexia (3.3%), anemia, (2.9%), febrile neutropenia (2.9%), platelet 
count  decreased  (2.9%),  myocardial  infarction  (2.9%),  diarrhea  (1.6%),  lipase  increased  (1.3%), 
neutrophil  count  decreased  (1.3%),  and  pancytopenia  (1.3%).  Overall,  the  most  common  adverse 
reactions  (≥20%)  were  platelet  count  decreased,  rash,  dry  skin,  and  abdominal  pain.  The  rates  of 
treatment-related adverse events resulting in discontinuation were 10% in CP-CML, 7% in AP-CML and 
3% in BP-CML/Ph+ ALL. 
SAEs occurred in 284 (53.6%) patients; 171 (32.3%) were grade 3-4, and 75 (14.2%) were fatal (grade 
5). 
The most commonly occurring serious adverse events (in ≥2% of patients) were neoplasm progression, 
pneumonia, pancreatitis, febrile neutropenia, pyrexia, abdominal pain, decreased platelet  count, atrial 
fibrillation, anaemia, and sepsis. 
The SOCs with most fatal serious adverse events were Infections (15 patients; 2.8%); Nervous system 
disorders (7 patients- 1.3%, including 4 intracranial haemorrhage and 1 haemorrhagic cerebral infarction 
–  i.e.  bleeding  events);  and  Cardiac  disorders  (8  patients;  1.5%).  In  the  GI  SOC  an  additional  fatal 
bleeding event was seen – haemorrhagic gastritis. In total 6 (1.1%) fatal bleeding serious adverse events 
occurred.

Ponatinib is associated with severe (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events grade 3 or 4) thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anaemia.  The frequency of these events is 
greater in patients with accelerated phase CML (AP-CML) or blast phase CML (BP-CML)/Ph+ ALL than in 
chronic phase CML (CP-CML). As a consequence, patients should perform a complete blood count should 
be performed every 2 weeks for the first 3 months and then monthly or as clinically indicated (see SmPC 
sections  4.2,  4.4  and  4.8).  Myelosuppression  was  generally  reversible  and  usually  managed  by 
withholding  Iclusig  temporarily  or  reducing  the  dose.  Discontinuation  due  to  myelosuppression  was 
infrequent (thrombocytopenia 3.6%, neutropenia and anaemia <1% each).  
Ponatinib is associated with pancreatitis, the frequency of which is greater in the first 2 months of use.  
Serum lipase should be checked every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then periodically thereafter. 
Dose  interruption  or  reduction  may  be  required.    If  lipase  elevations  are  accompanied  by  abdominal 
symptoms, ponatinib should be withheld and patients evaluated for evidence of pancreatitis (see section 
4.2 of the SmPC).  Patients with a history of pancreatitis or alcohol abuse should be cautiously treated.  
Patients with severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia should be appropriately managed to reduce the 
risk of pancreatitis. 
Non-hematologic laboratory abnormalities occurred with similar incidence across disease groups except 
bilirubin, which was lowest in the CP-CML group (14.4% vs. 26.6% and 27.1%), increased creatinine, 
which  was  highest  in  the  BP-CML/Ph+ ALL  group  (12.1%  vs.  6.4%  and  3.2%),  and  increased  lipase, 
which was lowest in the BP-CML/Ph+ ALL group (10.3% vs. 24.3% and 26.6%). A warning has been 
included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
During the initial phases of clinical development, there was insufficient safety data available to justify 
supratherapeutic  doses  in  normal  subjects  to  conduct  a  thorough  QTc  study.  Instead  the  applicant 
collected ECG data from subjects enrolled into the phase 1 study, and this was continued in the phase 2 
study. Overall, the incidences of QT prolongation were low in the conducted trials. However the lack of a 
thorough QTc study makes it difficult to completely rule out an effect of ponatinib on QT prolongation. This 
is acknowledged by the applicant, and appropriate wording has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Further data collection is planned and ongoing in the phase 3 study with ponatinib. 
Pancreatic events (24%), including pancreatitis in 7.4%, stand out as one of the major safety issues of 
ponatinib use, which is unlike the other TKIs with less than 1% pancreatitis. With regard to fluid retention 
and related AEs, ponatinib appears somewhat better than dasatinib but less favourable than nilotinib. 
Haematological  laboratory  abnormalities  were  similar  between  ponatinib  and  dasatinib.  The  GI  AEs 
abdominal pain and constipation were more common with ponatinib compared with the two approved 
TKIs, but diarrhoea was more than twice as common for dasatinib, and even more frequent for bosutinib. 
Frequencies for any grade vomiting were very similar across TKIs, except for bosutinib that had a higher 
frequency.  Rash  occurred  with  similar  frequencies  across  TKIs.  Treatment-emergent  grade  3/4  ALT 
elevations were somewhat more frequent with ponatinib use (8%) compared with dasatinib and nilotinib 
and similar to bosutinib. Fluid retention and oedema–group AEs occurred with an overall frequency of 
more than 24% with ponatinib, and peripheral oedema was reported in 14.7%, which is lower than the 
frequency of fluid retention with dasatinib (50%) including superficial oedema at 36%. In contrast, lower 
frequencies are seen for nilotinib with superficial oedema at 11% (peripheral oedema 5-6% according to 
Tasigna SmPC). Similarly, pleural effusion appears in falling incidence from dasatinib (22%), bosutinib 
(8% treatment-related), ponatinib (7.4%) and nilotinib (not reported). 
A  high  frequency  of  hypophosphatemia  is  seen  also  with  other  TKIs.  The  mechanism  for  serum 
phosphorus decrease by TKIs is not well defined and several different mechanisms have been suggested 
Iclusig 
CHMP assessment report

in literature, including e.g. inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDFGR) signalling and 
induction  of  secondary  hyperparathyroidism.  The  clinical  condition  of  hypophosphatemia  is  known  to 
cause  a  number  of  symptoms,  e.g.  muscle  weakness,  pareses,  and  spasms,  neurological  symptoms 
(tiredness,  cerebellar  symptoms,  confusion,  convulsions/seizures,  coma),  rhabdomyolysis  and 
haemolysis (due to reduced ability of the cells to produce ATP, leading to cellular energy depletion and 
resulting  instability  of  cell  membranes).  Dysfunction  of  erythrocytes  and  leukocytes  has  also  been 
reported, causing impaired oxygen transport and worsening of infections, respectively. The frequencies of 
observed  events  that  could  in  theory  be  potential  hypophosphatemia-related  symptoms  were 
investigated in relation to the observed serum phosphorous levels in pivotal Study 201. No increased 
frequencies of relevant events were seen in patients with hypophosphatemia compared with the overall 
frequencies in the study population. Only 2 of 112 patients with hypophosphatemia experienced grade 3 
events,  fatigues  and  asthenia,  respectively.  Thus,  no  immediately  apparent  relationship  between 
ponatinib-induced  hypophosphatemia  and  symptoms  was  revealed.  Hypophosphatemia  and  related 
symptoms have been included as an important potential risk in the RMP and will be closely monitored in 
the phase 3 trial. 
Imatinib and dasatinib have been associated with hypogammaglobulinemia, which is often implicated in 
recurrent or opportunistic infections (Koskela et al. 2011). Similar observations have not been made for 
ponatinib. 
Although immunoglobulin levels were not routinely measured in clinical trials of ponatinib, most evidence 
indicate  that  infections  were  primarily  due  to  decreased  neutrophil  count,  which  is  a  hallmark  of  the 
disease  state  and  also  a  very  common  adverse  reaction  of  ponatinib.  The  opportunistic  infections 
observed to date were generally explained by the patients’ underlying conditions. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The lack of a comparative study hampers the assessment of causality of several adverse events that are 
also characteristic features of the diseases treated, such as the frequently occurring myelosuppression, 
infections, and bleeding. In line with this, lower frequencies were seen during periods of response, i.e. 
when symptoms of the disease are fewer. Fluid retention, GI events and hypertension are also frequent 
in the clinical studies of ponatinib. 
While overall, the safety profile is similar to that of other TKI agents, it differs from them in the incidence 
of several clinically important events. Pancreatitis, uncommon with other TKIs, occurred overall in about 
7.4% of ponatinib treated-patients, but rarely led to discontinuation.

PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 4, the PRAC considers by consensus 
that the risk management system for ponatinib (Iclusig) in the proposed indication in adult patients 
with  
• 
chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) who are 
resistant to dasatinib or nilotinib; who are intolerant to dasatinib or nilotinib and for whom subsequent 
treatment with imatinib is not clinically appropriate; or who have the T315I mutation 
• 
Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) who are resistant 
to dasatinib; who are intolerant to dasatinib and for whom subsequent treatment with imatinib is not 
clinically appropriate; or who have the T315I mutation. 
could be acceptable. 
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Patients with CML and Ph+ ALL who have failed, or are intolerant to, second line tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
therapy with dasatinib or nilotinib, have limited therapies available, and outcomes are poor. Patients with 
the T315I mutation are resistant to currently available tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (namely imatinib, 
dasatinib and nilotinib). Both of the above groups have been studied in the trials submitted in support of 
this application. 
In CP disease, achievements of cytogenetic and molecular responses are of prognostic value and 
consequently the most important surrogate outcome measures for a particular treatment. These 
outcomes are of course beneficial also in the treatment of advanced disease, but here the achievement 
even of a haematological response is a clinically highly relevant outcome, associated with improved 
symptom control. Ultimately, response to therapy may enable certain patients to proceed to allogeneic 
stem cell transplantation, a potentially curative intervention in CML.  
The efficacy of ponatinib in the treatment of the above population of Ph+ leukaemia patients, with regards 
to the accepted primary endpoints, has been shown in the pivotal clinical trial submitted. With a median 
follow-up of 9.9 months, estimates of time related end-points especially in the population expected to 
have longest survival (CP-CML) were immature. However, estimates made of the duration of response, 
progression free survival and overall survival, point towards the responses being durable. Further 
analyses with additional follow-up data from an additional median of 5 months have supported the 
conclusions of the previous analyses. Subsequently analyses have been provided with a median follow-up 
of 14.5 months, and the results still support the conclusions that the responses are durable and the 
prospectively defined efficacy endpoints of the phase 2 study were met with statistical significance in all 
6 cohorts of the study. The pivotal results were consistent with and supported by the observations in the 
phase 1 study. 
Therefore Iclusig has shown a significant beneficial effect on the endpoints studied in the clinical trials. 
The effects seen are clinically relevant, and appear superior to the effects, seen in the same patient 
population, with the prior other TKI therapy. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Many adverse events are characteristic features of the diseases treated. Thus myelosuppression was 
frequent and laboratory abnormalities of thrombocytopenia, anaemia, and neutropenia all occurred in > 
50% of patients, with grade 3-4 AEs also very common. Infections also occurred in > 50% of patients and 
nearly 20% had serious infections (infection SAEs).  
Pancreatitis was noted as the dose-limiting toxicity in the dose finding study. With a frequency of 7.4% in 
the pooled safety populations of Studies 101 and 201, it constitutes one of the major safety issues of 
ponatinib use.  
The adverse events of myelosuppression and pancreatitis were managed effectively by the regimen of 
dose reduction/ dose delay used in the pivotal phase II trial. These dose recommendations have been 
included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Bleeding events occurred in 25% of all patients. Cerebral haemorrhage and gastrointestinal haemorrhage 
were the most commonly reported serious bleeding events, as well as the most commonly reported fatal 
bleeding events.  
Fluid retention and oedema occurred with an overall frequency of more than 24%, and 16.3% of patients 
had dose reductions or drug interruptions for fluid retention events.  
Gastrointestinal AEs are frequently occurring with ponatinib use, affecting 77.7% of patients; 18.7% had 
grade ≥3 events (almost all of these were grade 3). 
Two patients discontinued due to hepatotoxicity. No cases fulfilling Hy’s law were seen. 
Of all 38 deaths during study that were not due to progressive disease, 5 were considered at least possibly 
related to study treatment. These included 2 cases of pneumonia (1 being fungal), 1 haemorrhagic 
gastritis, 1 myocardial infarction and 1 cardiac arrest due to diarrhoea and dehydration.  
The overall pattern is that AEs of any grade and of grade ≥3 generally increase with disease severity. 
Multivariate analysis showed that AEs generally increased with increasing dose intensity, number of prior 
TKIs, time since diagnosis, and age.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
A thorough QT/QTc study has not been conducted, and therefore an effect of ponatinib on QT 
prolongation cannot be definitely ruled out. Warnings and precautionary texts have been added to the 
product information, and further intensive ECG monitoring is planned in future studies.  
The mechanism(s) for hypophosphatemia with ponatinib and other TKIs remain largely unknown and a 
number of different potential mechanisms have been proposed for these TKIs in the literature. The clinical 
relevance of decreased serum phosphorus appears to be minor based on currently available data, but 
should be further monitored. Hypophosphatemia and related symptoms are being included in the RMP as 
an important potential risk, and will be closely monitored in the phase 3 trial. 
The elimination pathways of major importance have not been fully clarified. This has consequences for the 
interaction potential and which medicinal products interactions could be expected for on a mechanistic 
basis. CYP3A4 is responsible in part for the elimination, and the interaction study with ketoconazole 
shows an effect of 70-80 % increase in the exposure of ponatinib, that could potentially be larger.

Patients with hepatic impairment are likely at risk of higher exposure. This effect has so far not been 
quantified but the Applicant committed to conduct a study in patients with hepatic impairment. Exposure 
increase could also occur in patients with severe renal impairment, due to the presence of uremic toxins 
affecting also hepatically eliminated medicinal products. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The magnitude of response rates shown in the two clinical studies is considered very clinically relevant, 
especially for, but not restricted to, CML patients harbouring the T315I mutation.  
The  most  common  unfavourable  effects  include  gastrointestinal  events,  rash  and  other  skin  events, 
infections, myelosuppression, fluid retention, pancreatitis, fatigue, and myalgia.  However, most of the 
common unfavourable effects were well-managed with the dose reduction/ dose delay regimen used in 
the pivotal trial.  
Benefit-risk balance 
In a patient population, that includes patients with the T315I mutation, or patients who resistant to 
treatment with dasatinib/ nilotinib, the clinical benefits are considered relevant and outweigh the 
potential risks, which to large extent appear manageable. The same benefit-risk balance can also be 
concluded in a patient population intolerant to dasatinib or nilotinib, and for whom subsequent treatment 
with imatinib is clinically inappropriate. It is however noted that although patients with Ph+ ALL 
pre-treated with nilotinib have been included in the clinical studies, nilotinib is not approved in the 
treatment of Ph+ ALL patients which is reflected in section 4.1 of the SmPC. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that ponatinib is not similar to Atriance, Evoltra, Sprycel, Tasigna 
and Xaluprine within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix 
1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Iclusig in the treatment of adult patients with  
•  chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) who are resistant 
to dasatinib or nilotinib; who are intolerant to dasatinib or nilotinib and for whom subsequent 
treatment with imatinib is not clinically appropriate; or who have the T315I mutation 
•  Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) who are resistant to 
dasatinib; who are intolerant to dasatinib and for whom subsequent treatment with imatinib is not 
clinically appropriate; or who have the T315I mutation.

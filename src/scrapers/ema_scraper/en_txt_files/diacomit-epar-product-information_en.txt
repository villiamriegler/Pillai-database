PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Hard capsule 
Size 4, pink and white capsule, imprinted with “Diacomit 100 mg”, length of 14 mm. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Diacomit is indicated for use in conjunction with clobazam and valproate as adjunctive therapy of 
refractory generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy 
(SMEI, Dravet’s syndrome) whose seizures are not adequately controlled with clobazam and 
valproate. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Diacomit should only be administered under the supervision of a paediatrician / paediatric neurologist 
experienced in the diagnosis and management of epilepsy in infants and children.  
Posology 
Paediatric population  
The dose of stiripentol is calculated on a mg/kg body weight basis. 
The daily dosage may be administered in 2 or 3 divided doses. 
The initiation of adjunctive therapy with stiripentol should be undertaken gradually using upwards 
dose escalation to reach the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day administered in conjunction with 
clobazam and valproate.  
Stiripentol dosage escalation should be gradual, starting with 20mg/kg/day for 1 week, then 
30mg/kg/day for 1 week. Further dosage escalation is age dependent: 
- children less than 6 years should receive an additional 20 mg/kg/day in the third week, thus 
achieving the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day in three weeks; 
- children from 6 to less than 12 years should receive an additional 10 mg/kg/day each week, thus 
achieving the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day in four weeks; 
- children and adolescents 12 years and older should receive an additional 5 mg/kg/day each week 
until the optimum dose is reached based on clinical judgment. 
The recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day is based on the available clinical study findings and was the 
only dose of Diacomit evaluated in the pivotal studies (see section 5.1).

Stiripentol must always be taken with food as it degrades rapidly in an acidic environment (e.g. 
exposure to gastric acid in an empty stomach). 
Stiripentol should not be taken with milk or dairy products (yoghurt, soft cream cheese, etc.), 
carbonated drinks, fruit juice or food and drinks that contain caffeine or theophylline. 
Children aged less than 3 years 
The pivotal clinical evaluation of stiripentol was in children of 3 years of age and over with SMEI. 
The clinical decision for use of stiripentol in children with SMEI less than 3 years of age needs to be 
made on an individual patient basis taking into consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks. 
In this younger group of patients, adjunctive therapy with stiripentol should only be started when the 
diagnosis of SMEI has been clinically confirmed (see section 5.1). Data are limited about the use of 
stiripentol under 12 months of age. For these children the use of stiripentol will be done under the 
close supervision of the doctor. 
Patients aged ≥ 18 years of age 
Long-term data has not been collected in a sufficient number of adults to confirm maintenance of 
effect in this population. Treatment should be continued for as long as efficacy is observed. 
Dose adjustments of other antiepileptics used in combination with stiripentol 
Despite the absence of comprehensive pharmacology data on potential drug interactions, the following 
advice regarding modification of the dose and dosage schedules of other anti-epileptic medicinal 
products administered in conjunction with stiripentol is provided based on clinical experience. 
- Clobazam 
In the pivotal studies, when the use of stiripentol was initiated, the daily dose of clobazam was 
0.5 mg/kg/day usually administered in divided doses, twice daily. In the event of clinical signs of 
adverse reactions or overdose of clobazam (i.e., drowsiness, hypotonia, and irritability in young 
children), this daily dose was reduced by 25% every week. Approximately two to three-fold increases 
in clobazam and five-fold increases in norclobazam plasma levels respectively have been reported 
with co-administration of stiripentol in children with Dravet’s syndrome. 
- Valproate 
The potential for metabolic interaction between stiripentol and valproate is considered modest and 
thus, no modification of valproate dosage should be needed when stiripentol is added, except for 
clinical safety reasons. In the pivotal studies in the event of gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as 
loss of appetite, loss of weight, the daily dose of valproate was reduced by around 30% every week. 
Abnormal laboratory findings 
In the event of an abnormal blood count or liver function test finding, the clinical decision for 
continuing use or adjusting the dose of stiripentol in conjunction with adjusting the doses of clobazam 
and valproate needs to be made on an individual patient basis taking into consideration the potential 
clinical benefits and risks (see section 4.4). 
Effect of formulation 
The sachet formulation has a slightly higher Cmax than the capsules and thus the formulations are not 
bioequivalent. It is recommended that if a switch of formulations is required this is done under clinical 
supervision, in case of problems with tolerability (see section 5.2). 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Stiripentol is not recommended for use in patients with impaired hepatic and/or renal function (see 
section 4.4). 
Method of administration 
Oral use 
The capsule should be swallowed whole with a glass of water.  
To ensure that the whole amount of powder is taken by the patient, the capsule should not be opened. 
For the interaction of stiripentol with food, please see section 4.5.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
A past history of psychoses in the form of episodes of delirium. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital 
These substances should not be used in conjunction with stiripentol in the management of Dravet’s 
syndrome. The daily dosage of clobazam and/or valproate should be reduced according to the onset of 
side effects whilst on stiripentol therapy (see section 4.2). 
Growth rate of children 
Given the frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions to treatment with stiripentol and valproate 
(anorexia, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting), the growth rate of children under this combination of 
treatment should be carefully monitored. 
Blood count 
Neutropenia may be associated with the administration of stiripentol, clobazam and valproate. Blood 
counts should be assessed prior to starting treatment with stiripentol. Unless otherwise clinically 
indicated, blood counts should be checked every 6 months. 
Liver function 
It should be assessed prior to starting treatment with stiripentol. Unless otherwise clinically indicated, 
liver function should be checked every 6 months. 
Hepatic or renal impairment 
In the absence of specific clinical data in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function, stiripentol is 
not recommended for use in patients with impaired hepatic and/or renal function (see section 4.2). 
Substances interfering with CYP enzymes 
Stiripentol is an inhibitor of the enzymes CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 and may markedly 
increase the plasma concentrations of substances metabolised by these enzymes and increase the risk 
of adverse reactions (see section 4.5). In vitro studies suggested that stiripentol phase 1 metabolism is 
catalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and possibly other enzymes. Caution is advised when 
combining stiripentol with other substances that inhibit or induce one or more of these enzymes. 
Paediatric population 
The pivotal clinical studies did not include children below 3 years old. As a consequence, it is 
recommended that children between 6 months and 3 years of age are carefully monitored whilst on 
stiripentol therapy. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Potential medicinal product interactions affecting stiripentol 
The influence of other antiepileptic medicinal products on stiripentol pharmacokinetics is not well 
established. 
The impact of macrolides and azole antifungal medicinal products on stiripentol metabolism, that are 
known to be inhibitors of CYP3A4 and substrates of the same enzyme, is not known. Likewise, the 
effect of stiripentol on their metabolism is not known. 
In vitro studies suggested that stiripentol phase 1 metabolism is catalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and 
CYP3A4 and possibly other enzymes. Caution is advised when combining stiripentol with other 
substances that inhibit or induce one or more of these enzymes. 
Effect of stiripentol on cytochrome P450 enzymes 
Many of these interactions have been partially confirmed by in vitro studies and in clinical trials. The 
increase in steady state levels with the combined use of stiripentol, valproate, and clobazam is similar 
in adults and children, though inter-individual variability is marked. 
At therapeutic concentrations, stiripentol significantly inhibits several CYP450 isoenzymes: for 
example, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. As a result, pharmacokinetic interactions of metabolic 
origin with other medicines may be expected. These interactions may result in increased systemic 
levels of these active substances that may lead to enhanced pharmacological effects and to an increase 
in adverse reactions. 
Caution must be exercised if clinical circumstances require combining stiripentol with substances 
metabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. citalopram, omeprazole) or CYP3A4 (e.g. HIV protease inhibitors, 
antihistamines such as astemizole and chlorpheniramine, calcium channel blockers, statins, oral 
contraceptives, codeine) due to the increased risk of adverse reactions (see further in this section for 
antiepileptic medicines). Monitoring of plasma concentrations or adverse reactions is recommended. A 
dose adjustment may be necessary. 
Co-administration with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be avoided due to 
the markedly increased risk of severe adverse reactions.  
Data on the potential for inhibition of CYP1A2 are limited, and therefore, interactions with 
theophylline and caffeine cannot be excluded because of the increased plasma levels of theophylline 
and caffeine which may occur via inhibition of their hepatic metabolism, potentially leading to 
toxicity. Use in combination with stiripentol is not recommended. This warning is not only restricted 
to medicinal products but also to a considerable number of foods (for example: cola, chocolate, coffee, 
tea, and energy drinks) and nutritional products aimed at children: Patient should not drink cola drinks, 
which contain significant quantities of caffeine or chocolate, which contains trace amounts of 
theophylline (see section 4.2). 
As stiripentol inhibited CYP2D6 in vitro at concentrations that are achieved clinically in plasma, 
substances that are metabolized by this isoenzyme like: beta-blockers (propranolol, carvedilol, 
timolol), antidepressants (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, imipramine, clomipramine), antipsychotics 
(haloperidol), analgesics (codeine, dextromethorphan, tramadol) may be subject to metabolic 
interactions with stiripentol. A dose-adjustment may be necessary for substances metabolised by 
CYP2D6 and that are individually dose titrated. 
Potential for stiripentol to interact with other medicinal products 
In the absence of available clinical data, caution should be taken with the following clinically relevant 
interactions with stiripentol: 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Undesirable combinations (to be avoided unless strictly necessary) 
- Rye ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) 
Ergotism with possibility of necrosis of the extremities (inhibition of hepatic elimination of rye ergot). 
- Cisapride, halofantrine, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil 
Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and torsades de pointes/wave burst arrhythmia in particular. 
- Immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, cyclosporine, sirolimus) 
Raised blood levels of immunosuppressants (decreased hepatic metabolism). 
- Statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, etc.) 
Increased risk of dose-dependent adverse reactions such as rhabdomyolysis (decreased hepatic 
metabolism of cholesterol-lowering medicinal product). 
Combinations requiring precautions 
- Midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam 
Increased plasma benzodiazepine levels may occur via decreased hepatic metabolism leading to 
excessive sedation. 
- Chlorpromazine 
Stiripentol enhances the central depressant effect of chlorpromazine. 
- Effects on other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) 
Inhibition of CYP450 isoenzyme CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 may provoke pharmacokinetic interactions 
(inhibition of their hepatic metabolism) with phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
clobazam (see section 4.2), valproate (see section 4.2), diazepam (enhanced myorelaxation), 
ethosuximide, and tiagabine. The consequences are increased plasma levels of these anticonvulsants 
with potential risk of overdose. Clinical monitoring of plasma levels of other anticonvulsants when 
combined with stiripentol with possible dose adjustments is recommended. 
- Topiramate 
In a French compassionate use program for stiripentol, topiramate was added to stiripentol, clobazam 
and valproate in 41% of 230 cases. Based on the clinical observations in this group of patients, there is 
no evidence to suggest that a change in topiramate dose and dosage schedules is needed if co-
administered with stiripentol. 
With regard to topiramate, it is considered that potential competition of inhibition on CYP2C19 should 
not occur because it probably requires plasma concentrations 5-15 times higher than plasma 
concentrations obtained with the standard recommended topiramate dose and dosage schedules. 
- Levetiracetam 
Levetiracetam does not undergo hepatic metabolism to a major extent. As a result, no pharmacokinetic 
metabolic drug interaction between stiripentol and levetiracetam is anticipated. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Risk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general 
It has been shown that in the offspring of women with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is 
two to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population. Although other 
factors, e.g. the epilepsy, can contribute, available evidence suggests that this increase, to a large 
extent, is caused by the treatment. In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been 
noted with polytherapy. 
However, effective anti-epileptic therapy should not be interrupted during pregnancy, since the 
aggravation of the illness may be detrimental to both the mother and the foetus.

Risk related to stiripentol 
No data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect 
harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, foetal development, parturition or postnatal development at 
non-maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). In view of the indication, administration of stiripentol during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential would not be expected. The clinical decision for 
use of stiripentol in pregnancy needs to be made on an individual patient basis taking into 
consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to 
pregnant women and use of efficient methods of contraception is advisable. 
Breastfeeding 
In the absence of human studies on excretion in breast milk, and given that stiripentol passes freely 
from plasma into milk in the goat, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment. In case 
stiripentol therapy is continued during breast-feeding, the breast-fed infant should be carefully 
observed for potential adverse effects. 
Fertility 
No impact on fertility was detected in animal studies (see section 5.3). No clinical data are available, 
potential risk for human is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Stiripentol has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines because it may cause dizziness 
and ataxia. Patients should be advised not to drive or use machines until they have gained sufficient 
experience to gauge whether it adversely affects their abilities (see section 4.8).  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common side effects with stiripentol are anorexia, weight loss, insomnia, drowsiness, ataxia, 
hypotonia and dystonia.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions encountered most often are as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to 
< 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable 
effects are presented in order of decreasing severity.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Many of the above adverse reactions are often due to an increase in plasma levels of other 
anticonvulsant medicinal products (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) and may regress when the dose of these 
medicinal products is reduced. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Data on clinical overdose are not available. Treatment is supportive (symptomatic measures in 
intensive care units).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX17 
Mechanism of action 
In animal models, stiripentol antagonizes seizures induced by electric shock, pentetrazole and 
bicuculline. In rodent models, stiripentol appears to increase brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid 
(GABA) - the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian brain. This could occur by inhibition of 
synaptosomal uptake of GABA and/or inhibition of GABA transaminase. Stiripentol has also been 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
shown to enhance GABAA receptor-mediated transmission in the immature rat hippocampus and 
increase the mean open-duration (but not the frequency) of GABAA receptor chloride channels by a 
barbiturate-like mechanism. Stiripentol potentiates the efficacy of other anticonvulsants, such as 
carbamazepine, sodium valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbital and many benzodiazepines, as the result 
of pharmacokinetic interactions. The second effect of stiripentol is mainly based on metabolic 
inhibition of several isoenzymes, in particular CYP450 3A4 and 2C19, involved in the hepatic 
metabolism of other anti-epileptic medicines. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The pivotal clinical evaluation of stiripentol was in children of 3 years of age and over with SMEI. 
A French compassionate use program included children from 6 months of age because the diagnosis of 
Dravet’s syndrome may be made with confidence at that age in some patients. The clinical decision for 
use of Diacomit in children with SMEI less than 3 years of age needs to be made on an individual 
patient basis taking into consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks (see section 4.2). 
41 children with SMEI were included in a randomised, placebo-controlled, add-on trial. After a 
baseline period of 1 month, placebo (n=20) or stiripentol (n=21) was added to valproate and clobazam 
during a double-blind period of 2 months. Patients then received stiripentol in an open fashion. 
Responders were defined as having more than 50% reduction in the frequency of clonic (or tonic-
clonic) seizures during the second month of the double-blind period compared with baseline. 15 (71%) 
patients were responders on stiripentol (including nine free of clonic or tonic-clonic seizures), whereas 
there was only one (5%) on placebo (none was seizure free; stiripentol 95% CI 52.1-90.7 vs. placebo 
0-14.6). The 95% CI of the difference was 42.2-85.7. Percentage of change from baseline was higher 
on stiripentol (-69%) than on placebo (+7%), p< 0.0001. 21 patients on stiripentol had moderate side-
effects (drowsiness, loss of appetite) compared with eight on placebo, but side-effects disappeared 
when the dose of comedication was decreased in 12 of the 21 cases (Chiron et al, Lancet, 2000).  
There are no clinical study data to support the clinical safety of stiripentol administered at daily doses 
greater than 50 mg/kg/day. There are no clinical study data to support the use of stiripentol as 
monotherapy in Dravet’s syndrome. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The following pharmacokinetic properties of stiripentol have been reported from studies in adult 
healthy volunteers and adult patients. 
Absorption 
Stiripentol is quickly absorbed, with a time to peak plasma concentration of about 1.5 hours. The 
absolute bioavailability of stiripentol is not known since an intravenous formulation is not available 
for testing. It is well absorbed by the oral route since the majority of an oral dose is excreted in urine. 
Relative bioavailability between the capsules and powder for oral suspension in sachet formulations 
has been studied in healthy male volunteers after a 1,000 mg single oral administration. The two 
formulations were bioequivalent in terms of AUC but not in terms of Cmax. Cmax of the sachet was 
slightly higher (23%) compared with the capsule and did not meet the criteria for bioequivalence. Tmax 
was similar with both formulations. Clinical supervision is recommended if switching between the 
stiripentol capsule and powder for oral suspension in sachet formulations. 
Distribution 
Stiripentol binds extensively to circulating plasma proteins (about 99%). 
Elimination 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Systemic exposure to stiripentol increases markedly compared to dose proportionality. Plasma 
clearance decreases markedly at high doses; it falls from approximately 40 l/kg/day at the dose of 
600 mg/day to about 8 l/kg/day at the dose of 2,400 mg. Clearance is decreased after repeated 
administration of stiripentol, probably due to inhibition of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 
responsible for its metabolism. The half-life of elimination was in the range of 4.5 hours to 13 hours, 
increasing with dose. 
Biotransformation 
Stiripentol is extensively metabolized, 13 different metabolites having been found in urine. The main 
metabolic processes are demethylenation and glucuronidation, although precise identification of the 
enzymes involved has not yet been achieved. 
On the basis of in vitro studies, the principal liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes involved in phase 1 
metabolism are considered to be CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. 
Excretion 
Most stiripentol is excreted via the kidney. 
Urinary metabolites of stiripentol accounted collectively for the majority (73%) of an oral acute dose 
whereas a further 13-24% was recovered in faeces as unchanged substance. 
Paediatric population pharmacokinetic study 
A population pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 35 children with Dravet Syndrome treated with 
stiripentol  and  two  substances  not  known  to  affect  stiripentol  pharmacokinetics,  valproate  and 
clobazam.  The  median  age  was  7.3  years  (range:  1  to  17.6  years)  and  the  median  daily  dose  of 
stiripentol was 45.4 mg/kg/day (range: 27.1 to 89.3 mg/kg/day) received in two or three divided doses. 
The data were best fitted with a one compartment model with first order absorption and elimination 
processes.  The  population  estimate  for  the  absorption  rate  constant  Ka  was  2.08  hr-1  (standard 
deviation of random effect = 122%). Clearance and volume of distribution were related to body weight 
by an allometric model with exponents of 0.433 and 1, respectively: as body weight increased from 10 
to 60 kg, apparent oral clearance increased from 2.60 to 5.65 L/hr and apparent volume of distribution 
increased from 32.0 to 191.8 L. As a result, elimination half-life increased from 8.5hr (for 10 kg) to 
23.5 hr (for 60 kg). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Toxicity studies in animals (rat, monkey, mouse) have not revealed any consistent pattern of toxicity 
apart from liver enlargement associated with hepatocellular hypertrophy, which occurred when high 
doses of stiripentol were administered to both rodents and non-rodents. This finding is considered to 
be an adaptive response to a high metabolic burden on the liver.  
Stiripentol was not teratogenic when tested in the rat and rabbit; in one study in the mouse, but not in 
several other similar studies, a low incidence of cleft palate formation was observed at a maternotoxic 
dose (800 mg/kg/day). These studies in mice and rabbits were undertaken prior to the introduction of 
Good Laboratory Practice requirements. Studies in the rat on fertility and general reproductive 
performance and on pre- and postnatal development were uneventful except for a minor reduction in 
the survival of pups nursed by mothers exhibiting toxic responses to stiripentol at a dose of 
800 mg/kg/day (see section 4.6).  
Genotoxicity studies have not detected any mutagenic or clastogenic activity.  
Carcinogenicity studies gave negative results in the rat. In the mouse there was only a small increase 
in the incidence of hepatic adenomas and carcinomas in animals treated with 200 or 600 mg/kg/day for 
78 weeks but not in those given 60 mg/kg/day. In view of the lack of genotoxicity of stiripentol and 
the well known, special susceptibility of the mouse liver to tumour formation in the presence of 
hepatic enzyme induction, this finding is not considered to indicate a risk of tumorigenicity in patients.

Size 2, pink capsule, imprinted with “Diacomit 250 mg”. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Diacomit is indicated for use in conjunction with clobazam and valproate as adjunctive therapy of 
refractory generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy 
(SMEI, Dravet’s syndrome) whose seizures are not adequately controlled with clobazam and 
valproate. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Diacomit should only be administered under the supervision of a paediatrician / paediatric neurologist 
experienced in the diagnosis and management of epilepsy in infants and children.  
Posology 
Paediatric population  
The dose of stiripentol is calculated on a mg/kg body weight basis. 
The daily dosage may be administered in 2 or 3 divided doses. 
The initiation of adjunctive therapy with stiripentol should be undertaken gradually using upwards 
dose escalation to reach the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day administered in conjunction with 
clobazam and valproate.  
Stiripentol dosage escalation should be gradual, starting with 20mg/kg/day for 1 week, then 
30mg/kg/day for 1 week. Further dosage escalation is age dependent: 
- children less than 6 years should receive an additional 20 mg/kg/day in the third week, thus 
achieving the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day in three weeks; 
- children from 6 to less than 12 years should receive an additional 10 mg/kg/day each week, thus 
achieving the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day in four weeks; 
- children and adolescents 12 years and older should receive an additional 5 mg/kg/day each week 
until the optimum dose is reached based on clinical judgment. 
The recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day is based on the available clinical study findings and was the 
only dose of Diacomit evaluated in the pivotal studies (see section 5.1). 
Stiripentol must always be taken with food as it degrades rapidly in an acidic environment (e.g. 
exposure to gastric acid in an empty stomach). 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stiripentol should not be taken with milk or dairy products (yoghurt, soft cream cheese, etc.), 
carbonated drinks, fruit juice or food and drinks that contain caffeine or theophylline. 
Children aged less than 3 years 
The pivotal clinical evaluation of stiripentol was in children of 3 years of age and over with SMEI. 
The clinical decision for use of stiripentol in children with SMEI less than 3 years of age needs to be 
made on an individual patient basis taking into consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks. 
In this younger group of patients, adjunctive therapy with stiripentol should only be started when the 
diagnosis of SMEI has been clinically confirmed (see section 5.1). Data are limited about the use of 
stiripentolunder 12 months of age. For these children the use of stiripentol will be done under the close 
supervision of the doctor. 
Patients aged ≥ 18 years of age 
Long-term data has not been collected in a sufficient number of adults to confirm maintenance of 
effect in this population. Treatment should be continued for as long as efficacy is observed. 
Dose adjustments of other antiepileptics used in combination with stiripentol 
Despite the absence of comprehensive pharmacology data on potential drug interactions, the following 
advice regarding modification of the dose and dosage schedules of other anti-epileptic medicinal 
products administered in conjunction with stiripentol is provided based on clinical experience. 
- Clobazam 
In the pivotal studies, when the use of stiripentol was initiated, the daily dose of clobazam was 
0.5 mg/kg/day usually administered in divided doses, twice daily. In the event of clinical signs of 
adverse reactions or overdose of clobazam (i.e., drowsiness, hypotonia, and irritability in young 
children), this daily dose was reduced by 25% every week. Approximately two to three-fold increases 
in clobazam and five-fold increases in norclobazam plasma levels respectively have been reported 
with co-administration of stiripentol in children with Dravet’s syndrome. 
- Valproate 
The potential for metabolic interaction between stiripentol and valproate is considered modest and 
thus, no modification of valproate dosage should be needed when stiripentol is added, except for 
clinical safety reasons. In the pivotal studies in the event of gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as 
loss of appetite, loss of weight, the daily dose of valproate was reduced by around 30% every week. 
Abnormal laboratory findings 
In the event of an abnormal blood count or liver function test finding, the clinical decision for 
continuing use or adjusting the dose of stiripentol in conjunction with adjusting the doses of clobazam 
and valproate needs to be made on an individual patient basis taking into consideration the potential 
clinical benefits and risks (see section 4.4). 
Effect of formulation 
The sachet formulation has a slightly higher Cmax than the capsules and thus the formulations are not 
bioequivalent. It is recommended that if a switch of formulations is required this is done under clinical 
supervision, in case of problems with tolerability (see section 5.2). 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Stiripentol is not recommended for use in patients with impaired hepatic and/or renal function (see 
section 4.4). 
Method of administration 
Oral use 
The capsule should be swallowed whole with a glass of water.  
To ensure that the whole amount of powder is taken by the patient, the capsule should not be opened. 
For the interaction of stiripentol with food, please see section 4.5.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
A past history of psychoses in the form of episodes of delirium. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital 
These substances should not be used in conjunction with stiripentol in the management of Dravet’s 
syndrome. The daily dosage of clobazam and/or valproate should be reduced according to the onset of 
side effects whilst on stiripentol therapy (see section 4.2). 
Growth rate of children 
Given the frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions to treatment with stiripentol and valproate 
(anorexia, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting), the growth rate of children under this combination of 
treatment should be carefully monitored. 
Blood count 
Neutropenia may be associated with the administration of stiripentol, clobazam and valproate. Blood 
counts should be assessed prior to starting treatment with stiripentol. Unless otherwise clinically 
indicated, blood counts should be checked every 6 months. 
Liver function 
It should be assessed prior to starting treatment with stiripentol. Unless otherwise clinically indicated, 
liver function should be checked every 6 months. 
Hepatic or renal impairment 
In the absence of specific clinical data in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function, stiripentol is 
not recommended for use in patients with impaired hepatic and/or renal function (see section 4.2). 
Substances interfering with CYP enzymes 
Stiripentol is an inhibitor of the enzymes CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 and may markedly 
increase the plasma concentrations of substances metabolised by these enzymes and increase the risk 
of adverse reactions (see section 4.5). In vitro studies suggested that stiripentol phase 1 metabolism is 
catalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and possibly other enzymes. Caution is advised when 
combining stiripentol with other substances that inhibit or induce one or more of these enzymes. 
Paediatric population 
The pivotal clinical studies did not include children below 3 years old. As a consequence, it is 
recommended that children between 6 months and 3 years of age are carefully monitored whilst on 
stiripentol therapy. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.   
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Potential medicinal product interactions affecting stiripentol 
The influence of other antiepileptic medicinal products on stiripentol pharmacokinetics is not well 
established. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The impact of macrolides and azole antifungal medicinal agents on stiripentol metabolism, that are 
known to be inhibitors of CYP3A4 and substrates of the same enzyme, is not known. Likewise, the 
effect of stiripentol on their metabolism is not known. 
In vitro studies suggested that stiripentol phase 1 metabolism is catalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and 
CYP3A4 and possibly other enzymes. Caution is advised when combining stiripentol with other 
substances that inhibit or induce one or more of these enzymes. 
Effect of stiripentol on cytochrome P450 enzymes 
Many of these interactions have been partially confirmed by in vitro studies and in clinical trials. The 
increase in steady state levels with the combined use of stiripentol, valproate, and clobazam is similar 
in adults and children, though inter-individual variability is marked. 
At therapeutic concentrations, stiripentol significantly inhibits several CYP450 isoenzymes: for 
example, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. As a result, pharmacokinetic interactions of metabolic 
origin with other medicines may be expected. These interactions may result in increased systemic 
levels of these active substances that may lead to enhanced pharmacological effects and to an increase 
in adverse reactions. 
Caution must be exercised if clinical circumstances require combining stiripentol with substances 
metabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. citalopram, omeprazole) or CYP3A4 (e.g. HIV protease inhibitors, 
antihistamines such as astemizole and chlorpheniramine, calcium channel blockers, statins, oral 
contraceptives, codeine) due to the increased risk of adverse reactions (see further in this section for 
antiepileptic medicines). Monitoring of plasma concentrations or adverse reactions is recommended. A 
dose adjustment may be necessary. 
Co-administration with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be avoided due to 
the markedly increased risk of severe adverse reactions.  
Data on the potential for inhibition of CYP1A2 are limited, and therefore, interactions with 
theophylline and caffeine cannot be excluded because of the increased plasma levels of theophylline 
and caffeine which may occur via inhibition of their hepatic metabolism, potentially leading to 
toxicity. Use in combination with stiripentol is not recommended. This warning is not only restricted 
to medicinal products but also to a considerable number of foods (for example: cola, chocolate, coffee, 
tea, and energy drinks) and nutritional products aimed at children: Patient should not drink cola drinks, 
which contain significant quantities of caffeine or chocolate, which contains trace amounts of 
theophylline (see section 4.2). 
As stiripentol inhibited CYP2D6 in vitro at concentrations that are achieved clinically in plasma, 
substances that are metabolized by this isoenzyme like: beta-blockers (propranolol, carvedilol, 
timolol), antidepressants (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, imipramine, clomipramine), antipsychotics 
(haloperidol), analgesics (codeine, dextromethorphan, tramadol) may be subject to metabolic 
interactions with stiripentol. A dose-adjustment may be necessary for substances metabolised by 
CYP2D6 and that are individually dose titrated. 
Potential for stiripentol to interact with other medicinal products 
In the absence of available clinical data, caution should be taken with the following clinically relevant 
interactions with stiripentol: 
Undesirable combinations (to be avoided unless strictly necessary) 
- Rye ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) 
Ergotism with possibility of necrosis of the extremities (inhibition of hepatic elimination of rye ergot). 
- Cisapride, halofantrine, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil 
Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and torsades de pointes/wave burst arrhythmia in particular. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- Immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, cyclosporine, sirolimus) 
Raised blood levels of immunosuppressants (decreased hepatic metabolism). 
- Statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, etc.) 
Increased risk of dose-dependent adverse reactions such as rhabdomyolysis (decreased hepatic 
metabolism of cholesterol-lowering medicinal product). 
Combinations requiring precautions 
- Midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam 
Increased plasma benzodiazepine levels may occur via decreased hepatic metabolism leading to 
excessive sedation. 
- Chlorpromazine 
Stiripentol enhances the central depressant effect of chlorpromazine. 
- Effects on other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) 
Inhibition of CYP450 isoenzyme CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 may provoke pharmacokinetic interactions 
(inhibition of their hepatic metabolism) with phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
clobazam (see section 4.2), valproate (see section 4.2), diazepam (enhanced myorelaxation), 
ethosuximide, and tiagabine. The consequences are increased plasma levels of these anticonvulsants 
with potential risk of overdose. Clinical monitoring of plasma levels of other anticonvulsants when 
combined with stiripentol with possible dose adjustments is recommended. 
- Topiramate 
In a French compassionate use program for stiripentol, topiramate was added to stiripentol, clobazam 
and valproate in 41% of 230 cases. Based on the clinical observations in this group of patients, there is 
no evidence to suggest that a change in topiramate dose and dosage schedules is needed if co-
administered with stiripentol. 
With regard to topiramate, it is considered that potential competition of inhibition on CYP2C19 should 
not occur because it probably requires plasma concentrations 5-15 times higher than plasma 
concentrations obtained with the standard recommended topiramate dose and dosage schedules. 
- Levetiracetam 
Levetiracetam does not undergo hepatic metabolism to a major extent. As a result, no pharmacokinetic 
metabolic drug interaction between stiripentol and levetiracetam is anticipated. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Risk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general 
It has been shown that in the offspring of women with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is 
two to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population. Although other 
factors, e.g. the epilepsy, can contribute, available evidence suggests that this increase, to a large 
extent, is caused by the treatment. In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been 
noted with polytherapy. 
However, effective anti-epileptic therapy should not be interrupted during pregnancy, since the 
aggravation of the illness may be detrimental to both the mother and the foetus. 
Risk related to stiripentol 
No data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect 
harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, foetal development, parturition or postnatal development at 
non-maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). In view of the indication, administration of stiripentol during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential would not be expected. The clinical decision for 
use of stiripentol in pregnancy needs to be made on an individual patient basis taking into 
consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to 
pregnant women and use of efficient methods of contraception is advisable. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breastfeeding 
In the absence of human studies on excretion in breast milk, and given that stiripentol passes freely 
from plasma into milk in the goat, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment. In case 
stiripentol therapy is continued during breast-feeding, the breast-fed infant should be carefully 
observed for potential adverse effects. 
Fertility 
No impact on fertility was detected in animal studies (see section 5.3). No clinical data are available, 
potential risk for human is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Stiripentol has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines because it may cause dizziness 
and ataxia. Patients should be advised not to drive or use machines until they have gained sufficient 
experience to gauge whether it adversely affects their abilities (see section 4.8).  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common side effects with stiripentol are anorexia, weight loss, insomnia, drowsiness, ataxia, 
hypotonia and dystonia.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions encountered most often are as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to 
< 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable 
effects are presented in order of decreasing severity.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Many of the above adverse reactions are often due to an increase in plasma levels of other 
anticonvulsant medicinal products (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) and may regress when the dose of these 
medicinal products is reduced. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Data on clinical overdose are not available. Treatment is supportive (symptomatic measures in 
intensive care units). 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX17 
Mechanism of action 
In animal models, stiripentol antagonizes seizures induced by electric shock, pentetrazole and 
bicuculline. In rodent models, stiripentol appears to increase brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid 
(GABA) - the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian brain. This could occur by inhibition of 
synaptosomal uptake of GABA and/or inhibition of GABA transaminase. Stiripentol has also been 
shown to enhance GABAA receptor-mediated transmission in the immature rat hippocampus and 
increase the mean open-duration (but not the frequency) of GABAA receptor chloride channels by a 
barbiturate-like mechanism. Stiripentol potentiates the efficacy of other anticonvulsants, such as 
carbamazepine, sodium valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbital and many benzodiazepines, as the result 
of pharmacokinetic interactions. The second effect of stiripentol is mainly based on metabolic 
inhibition of several isoenzymes, in particular CYP450 3A4 and 2C19, involved in the hepatic 
metabolism of other anti-epileptic medicines. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The pivotal clinical evaluation of stiripentol was in children of 3 years of age and over with SMEI. 
A French compassionate use program included children from 6 months of age because the diagnosis of 
Dravet’s syndrome may be made with confidence at that age in some patients. The clinical decision for 
use of Diacomit in children with SMEI less than 3 years of age needs to be made on an individual 
patient basis taking into consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks (see section 4.2). 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
41 children with SMEI were included in a randomised, placebo-controlled, add-on trial. After a 
baseline period of 1 month, placebo (n=20) or stiripentol (n=21) was added to valproate and clobazam 
during a double-blind period of 2 months. Patients then received stiripentol in an open fashion. 
Responders were defined as having more than 50% reduction in the frequency of clonic (or tonic-
clonic) seizures during the second month of the double-blind period compared with baseline. 15 (71%) 
patients were responders on stiripentol (including nine free of clonic or tonic-clonic seizures), whereas 
there was only one (5%) on placebo (none was seizure free; stiripentol 95% CI 52.1-90.7 vs. placebo 
0-14.6). The 95% CI of the difference was 42.2-85.7. Percentage of change from baseline was higher 
on stiripentol (-69%) than on placebo (+7%), p< 0.0001. 21 patients on stiripentol had moderate side-
effects (drowsiness, loss of appetite) compared with eight on placebo, but side-effects disappeared 
when the dose of comedication was decreased in 12 of the 21 cases (Chiron et al, Lancet, 2000).  
There are no clinical study data to support the clinical safety of stiripentol administered at daily doses 
greater than 50 mg/kg/day. There are no clinical study data to support the use of stiripentol as 
monotherapy in Dravet’s syndrome. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The following pharmacokinetic properties of stiripentol have been reported from studies in adult 
healthy volunteers and adult patients. 
Absorption 
Stiripentol is quickly absorbed, with a time to peak plasma concentration of about 1.5 hours. The 
absolute bioavailability of stiripentol is not known since an intravenous formulation is not available 
for testing. It is well absorbed by the oral route since the majority of an oral dose is excreted in urine. 
Relative bioavailability between the capsules and powder for oral suspension in sachet formulations 
has been studied in healthy male volunteers after a 1,000 mg single oral administration. The two 
formulations were bioequivalent in terms of AUC but not in terms of Cmax. Cmax of the sachet was 
slightly higher (23%) compared with the capsule and did not meet the criteria for bioequivalence. Tmax 
was similar with both formulations. Clinical supervision is recommended if switching between the 
stiripentol capsule and powder for oral suspension in sachet formulations. 
Distribution 
Stiripentol binds extensively to circulating plasma proteins (about 99%). 
Elimination 
Systemic exposure to stiripentol increases markedly compared to dose proportionality. Plasma 
clearance decreases markedly at high doses; it falls from approximately 40 l/kg/day at the dose of 
600 mg/day to about 8 l/kg/day at the dose of 2,400 mg. Clearance is decreased after repeated 
administration of stiripentol, probably due to inhibition of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 
responsible for its metabolism. The half-life of elimination was in the range of 4.5 hours to 13 hours, 
increasing with dose. 
Biotransformation 
Stiripentol is extensively metabolized, 13 different metabolites having been found in urine. The main 
metabolic processes are demethylenation and glucuronidation, although precise identification of the 
enzymes involved has not yet been achieved. 
On the basis of in vitro studies, the principal liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes involved in phase 1 
metabolism are considered to be CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Excretion 
Most stiripentol is excreted via the kidney. 
Urinary metabolites of stiripentol accounted collectively for the majority (73%) of an oral acute dose 
whereas a further 13-24% was recovered in faeces as unchanged substance. 
Paediatric population pharmacokinetic study 
A population pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 35 children with Dravet Syndrome treated with 
stiripentol  and  two  substances  not  known  to  affect  stiripentol  pharmacokinetics,  valproate  and 
clobazam.  The  median  age  was  7.3  years  (range:  1  to  17.6  years)  and  the  median  daily  dose  of 
stiripentol was 45.4 mg/kg/day (range: 27.1 to 89.3 mg/kg/day) received in two or three divided doses. 
The data were best fitted with a one compartment model with first order absorption and elimination 
processes.  The  population  estimate  for  the  absorption  rate  constant  Ka  was  2.08  hr-1  (standard 
deviation of random effect = 122%). Clearance and volume of distribution were related to body weight 
by an allometric model with exponents of 0.433 and 1, respectively: as body weight increased from 10 
to 60 kg, apparent oral clearance increased from 2.60 to 5.65 L/hr and apparent volume of distribution 
increased from 32.0 to 191.8 L. As a result, elimination half-life increased from 8.5hr (for 10 kg) to 
23.5 hr (for 60 kg). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Toxicity studies in animals (rat, monkey, mouse) have not revealed any consistent pattern of toxicity 
apart from liver enlargement associated with hepatocellular hypertrophy, which occurred when high 
doses of stiripentol were administered to both rodents and non-rodents. This finding is considered to 
be an adaptive response to a high metabolic burden on the liver.  
Stiripentol was not teratogenic when tested in the rat and rabbit; in one study in the mouse, but not in 
several other similar studies, a low incidence of cleft palate formation was observed at a maternotoxic 
dose (800 mg/kg/day). These studies in mice and rabbits were undertaken prior to the introduction of 
Good Laboratory Practice requirements. Studies in the rat on fertility and general reproductive 
performance and on pre- and postnatal development were uneventful except for a minor reduction in 
the survival of pups nursed by mothers exhibiting toxic responses to stiripentol at a dose of 
800 mg/kg/day (see section 4.6).  
Genotoxicity studies have not detected any mutagenic or clastogenic activity.  
Carcinogenicity studies gave negative results in the rat. In the mouse there was only a small increase 
in the incidence of hepatic adenomas and carcinomas in animals treated with 200 or 600 mg/kg/day for 
78 weeks but not in those given 60 mg/kg/day. In view of the lack of genotoxicity of stiripentol and 
the well known, special susceptibility of the mouse liver to tumour formation in the presence of 
hepatic enzyme induction, this finding is not considered to indicate a risk of tumorigenicity in patients.

Diacomit is indicated for use in conjunction with clobazam and valproate as adjunctive therapy of 
refractory generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy 
(SMEI, Dravet’s syndrome) whose seizures are not adequately controlled with clobazam and 
valproate. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Diacomit should only be administered under the supervision of a paediatrician / paediatric neurologist 
experienced in the diagnosis and management of epilepsy in infants and children.  
Posology 
The dose of stiripentol is calculated on a mg/kg body weight basis. 
The daily dosage may be administered in 2 or 3 divided doses. 
The initiation of adjunctive therapy with stiripentol should be undertaken gradually using upwards 
dose escalation to reach the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day administered in conjunction with 
clobazam and valproate.  
Stiripentol dosage escalation should be gradual, starting with 20mg/kg/day for 1 week, then 
30mg/kg/day for 1 week. Further dosage escalation is age dependent: 
- children less than 6 years should receive an additional 20 mg/kg/day in the third week, thus 
achieving the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day in three weeks; 
- children from 6 to less than 12 years should receive an additional 10 mg/kg/day each week, thus 
achieving the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day in four weeks; 
- children and adolescents 12 years and older should receive an additional 5 mg/kg/day each week 
until the optimum dose is reached based on clinical judgment. 
The recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day is based on the available clinical study findings and was the 
only dose of Diacomit evaluated in the pivotal studies (see section 5.1). 
Stiripentol must always be taken with food as it degrades rapidly in an acidic environment (e.g. 
exposure to gastric acid in an empty stomach). 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stiripentol should not be taken with milk or dairy products (yoghurt, soft cream cheese, etc.), 
carbonated drinks, fruit juice or food and drinks that contain caffeine or theophylline. 
Children aged less than 3 years 
The pivotal clinical evaluation of stiripentol was in children of 3 years of age and over with SMEI. 
The clinical decision for use of stiripentol in children with SMEI less than 3 years of age needs to be 
made on an individual patient basis taking into consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks. 
In this younger group of patients, adjunctive therapy with stiripentol should only be started when the 
diagnosis of SMEI has been clinically confirmed (see section 5.1). Data are limited about the use of 
stiripentol under 12 months of age. For these children the use of stiripentol will be done under the 
close supervision of the doctor. 
Patients aged ≥ 18 years of age 
Long-term data has not been collected in a sufficient number of adults to confirm maintenance of 
effect in this population. Treatment should be continued for as long as efficacy is observed. 
Dose adjustments of other antiepileptics used in combination with stiripentol 
Despite the absence of comprehensive pharmacology data on potential drug interactions, the following 
advice regarding modification of the dose and dosage schedules of other anti-epileptic medicinal 
products administered in conjunction with stiripentol is provided based on clinical experience. 
- Clobazam 
In the pivotal studies, when the use of stiripentol was initiated, the daily dose of clobazam was 
0.5 mg/kg/day usually administered in divided doses, twice daily. In the event of clinical signs of 
adverse reactions or overdose of clobazam (i.e., drowsiness, hypotonia, and irritability in young 
children), this daily dose was reduced by 25% every week. Approximately two to three-fold increases 
in clobazam and five-fold increases in norclobazam plasma levels respectively have been reported 
with co-administration of stiripentol in children with Dravet’s syndrome. 
- Valproate 
The potential for metabolic interaction between stiripentol and valproate is considered modest and 
thus, no modification of valproate dosage should be needed when stiripentol is added, except for 
clinical safety reasons. In the pivotal studies in the event of gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as 
loss of appetite, loss of weight, the daily dose of valproate was reduced by around 30% every week. 
Abnormal laboratory findings 
In the event of an abnormal blood count or liver function test finding, the clinical decision for 
continuing use or adjusting the dose of stiripentol in conjunction with adjusting the doses of clobazam 
and valproate needs to be made on an individual patient basis taking into consideration the potential 
clinical benefits and risks (see section 4.4). 
Effect of formulation 
The sachet formulation has a slightly higher Cmax than the capsules and thus the formulations are not 
bioequivalent. It is recommended that if a switch of formulations is required this is done under clinical 
supervision, in case of problems with tolerability (see section 5.2). 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Stiripentol is not recommended for use in patients with impaired hepatic and/or renal function (see 
section 4.4). 
Method of administration 
Oral use 
The capsule should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. 
To ensure that the whole amount of powder is taken by the patient, the capsule should not be opened. 
For the interaction of stiripentol with food, please see section 4.5. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
A past history of psychoses in the form of episodes of delirium. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital 
These substances should not be used in conjunction with stiripentol in the management of Dravet’s 
syndrome. The daily dosage of clobazam and/or valproate should be reduced according to the onset of 
side effects whilst on stiripentol therapy (see section 4.2). 
Growth rate of children 
Given the frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions to treatment with stiripentol and valproate 
(anorexia, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting), the growth rate of children under this combination of 
treatment should be carefully monitored. 
Blood count 
Neutropenia may be associated with the administration of stiripentol, clobazam and valproate. Blood 
counts should be assessed prior to starting treatment with stiripentol. Unless otherwise clinically 
indicated, blood counts should be checked every 6 months. 
Liver function 
It should be assessed prior to starting treatment with stiripentol. Unless otherwise clinically indicated, 
liver function should be checked every 6 months. 
Hepatic or renal impairment 
In the absence of specific clinical data in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function, Stiripentol is 
not recommended for use in patients with impaired hepatic and/or renal function (see section 4.2). 
Substances interfering with CYP enzymes 
Stiripentol is an inhibitor of the enzymes CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 and may markedly 
increase the plasma concentrations of substances metabolised by these enzymes and increase the risk 
of adverse reactions (see section 4.5). In vitro studies suggested that stiripentol phase 1 metabolism is 
catalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and possibly other enzymes. Caution is advised when 
combining stiripentol with other substances that inhibit or induce one or more of these enzymes. 
Paediatric population 
The pivotal clinical studies did not include children below 3 years old. As a consequence, it is 
recommended that children between 6 months and 3 years of age are carefully monitored whilst on 
stiripentol therapy. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Potential medicinal product interactions affecting stiripentol 
The influence of other antiepileptic medicinal products on stiripentol pharmacokinetics is not well 
established. 
The impact of macrolides and azole antifungal medicinal products on stiripentol metabolism, that are 
known to be inhibitors of CYP3A4 and substrates of the same enzyme, is not known. Likewise, the 
effect of stiripentol on their metabolism is not known. 
In vitro studies suggested that stiripentol phase 1 metabolism is catalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and 
CYP3A4 and possibly other enzymes. Caution is advised when combining stiripentol with other 
substances that inhibit or induce one or more of these enzymes. 
Effect of stiripentol on cytochrome P450 enzymes 
Many of these interactions have been partially confirmed by in vitro studies and in clinical trials. The 
increase in steady state levels with the combined use of stiripentol, valproate, and clobazam is similar 
in adults and children, though inter-individual variability is marked. 
At therapeutic concentrations, stiripentol significantly inhibits several CYP450 isoenzymes: for 
example, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. As a result, pharmacokinetic interactions of metabolic 
origin with other medicines may be expected. These interactions may result in increased systemic 
levels of these active substances that may lead to enhanced pharmacological effects and to an increase 
in adverse reactions. 
Caution must be exercised if clinical circumstances require combining stiripentol with substances 
metabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. citalopram, omeprazole) or CYP3A4 (e.g. HIV protease inhibitors, 
antihistamines such as astemizole and chlorpheniramine, calcium channel blockers, statins, oral 
contraceptives, codeine) due to the increased risk of adverse reactions (see further in this section for 
antiepileptic medicines). Monitoring of plasma concentrations or adverse reactions is recommended. A 
dose adjustment may be necessary. 
Co-administration with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be avoided due to 
the markedly increased risk of severe adverse reactions.  
Data on the potential for inhibition of CYP1A2 are limited, and therefore, interactions with 
theophylline and caffeine cannot be excluded because of increased plasma levels of theophylline and 
caffeine which may occur via inhibition of their hepatic metabolism, potentially leading to toxicity. 
Use in combination with stiripentol is not recommended. This warning is not only restricted to 
medicinal products but also to a considerable number of foods (for example: cola, chocolate, coffee, 
tea, and energy drinks) and nutritional products aimed at children: Patient should not drink cola drinks, 
which contain significant quantities of caffeine or chocolate, which contains trace amounts of 
theophylline (see section 4.2). 
As stiripentol inhibited CYP2D6 in vitro at concentrations that are achieved clinically in plasma, 
substances that are metabolized by this isoenzyme like: beta-blockers (propranolol, carvedilol, 
timolol), antidepressants (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, imipramine, clomipramine), antipsychotics 
(haloperidol), analgesics (codeine, dextromethorphan, tramadol) may be subject to metabolic 
interactions with stiripentol. A dose-adjustment may be necessary for substances metabolised by 
CYP2D6 and that are individually dose titrated. 
Potential for stiripentol to interact with other medicinal products 
In the absence of available clinical data, caution should be taken with the following clinically relevant 
interactions with stiripentol: 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Undesirable combinations (to be avoided unless strictly necessary) 
- Rye ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) 
Ergotism with possibility of necrosis of the extremities (inhibition of hepatic elimination of rye ergot). 
- Cisapride, halofantrine, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil 
Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and torsades de pointes/wave burst arrhythmia in particular. 
- Immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, cyclosporine, sirolimus) 
Raised blood levels of immunosuppressants (decreased hepatic metabolism). 
- Statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, etc.) 
Increased risk of dose-dependent adverse reactions such as rhabdomyolysis (decreased hepatic 
metabolism of cholesterol-lowering medicinal product). 
Combinations requiring precautions 
- Midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam 
Increased plasma benzodiazepine levels may occur via decreased hepatic metabolism leading to 
excessive sedation. 
- Chlorpromazine 
Stiripentol enhances the central depressant effect of chlorpromazine. 
- Effects on other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) 
Inhibition of CYP450 isoenzyme CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 may provoke pharmacokinetic interactions 
(inhibition of their hepatic metabolism) with phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
clobazam (see section 4.2), valproate (see section 4.2), diazepam (enhanced myorelaxation), 
ethosuximide, and tiagabine. The consequences are increased plasma levels of these anticonvulsants 
with potential risk of overdose. Clinical monitoring of plasma levels of other anticonvulsants when 
combined with stiripentol with possible dose adjustments is recommended. 
- Topiramate 
In a French compassionate use program for stiripentol, topiramate was added to stiripentol, clobazam 
and valproate in 41% of 230 cases. Based on the clinical observations in this group of patients, there is 
no evidence to suggest that a change in topiramate dose and dosage schedules is needed if co-
administered with stiripentol. 
With regard to topiramate, it is considered that potential competition of inhibition on CYP2C19 should 
not occur because it probably requires plasma concentrations 5-15 times higher than plasma 
concentrations obtained with the standard recommended topiramate dose and dosage schedules. 
- Levetiracetam 
Levetiracetam does not undergo hepatic metabolism to a major extent. As a result, no pharmacokinetic 
metabolic drug interaction between stiripentol and levetiracetam is anticipated. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Risk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general  
It has been shown that in the offspring of women with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is 
two to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population. Although other 
factors, e.g. the epilepsy, can contribute, available evidence suggests that this increase, to a large 
extent, is caused by the treatment. In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been 
noted with polytherapy. 
However, effective anti-epileptic therapy should not be interrupted during pregnancy, since the 
aggravation of the illness may be detrimental to both the mother and the foetus. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk related to stiripentol 
No data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect 
harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, foetal development, parturition or postnatal development at 
non-maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). In view of the indication, administration of stiripentol during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential would not be expected. The clinical decision for 
use of stiripentol in pregnancy needs to be made on an individual patient basis taking into 
consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to 
pregnant women and use of efficient methods of contraception is advisable. 
Breastfeeding 
In the absence of human studies on excretion in breast milk and given that stiripentol passes freely 
from plasma into milk in the goat, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment. In case 
stiripentol therapy is continued during breast-feeding, the breast-fed infant should be carefully 
observed for potential adverse effects. 
Fertility 
No impact on fertility was detected in animal studies (see section 5.3). No clinical data are available, 
potential risk for human is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Stiripentol has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines because it may cause dizziness 
and ataxia. Patients should be advised not to drive or use machines until they have gained sufficient 
experience to gauge whether it adversely affects their abilities (see section 4.8).  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common side effects with stiripentol are anorexia, weight loss, insomnia, drowsiness, ataxia, 
hypotonia and dystonia. 
Tabulated list of adverse reaction 
Adverse reactions encountered most often are as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to 
< 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable 
effects are presented in order of decreasing severity.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Many of the above adverse reactions are often due to an increase in plasma levels of other 
anticonvulsant medicinal products (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) and may regress when the dose of these 
medicinal products is reduced. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Data on clinical overdose are not available. Treatment is supportive (symptomatic measures in 
intensive care units).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX17 
Mechanism of action 
In animal models, stiripentol antagonizes seizures induced by electric shock, pentetrazole and 
bicuculline. In rodent models, stiripentol appears to increase brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid 
(GABA) - the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian brain. This could occur by inhibition of 
synaptosomal uptake of GABA and/or inhibition of GABA transaminase. Stiripentol has also been 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
shown to enhance GABAA receptor-mediated transmission in the immature rat hippocampus and 
increase the mean open-duration (but not the frequency) of GABAA receptor chloride channels by a 
barbiturate-like mechanism. Stiripentol potentiates the efficacy of other anticonvulsants, such as 
carbamazepine, sodium valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbital and many benzodiazepines, as the result 
of pharmacokinetic interactions. The second effect of stiripentol is mainly based on metabolic 
inhibition of several isoenzymes, in particular CYP450 3A4 and 2C19, involved in the hepatic 
metabolism of other anti-epileptic medicines. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The pivotal clinical evaluation of stiripentol was in children of 3 years of age and over with SMEI. 
A French compassionate use program included children from 6 months of age because the diagnosis of 
Dravet’s syndrome may be made with confidence at that age in some patients. The clinical decision for 
use of Diacomit in children with SMEI less than 3 years of age needs to be made on an individual 
patient basis taking into consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks (see section 4.2). 
41 children with SMEI were included in a randomised, placebo-controlled, add-on trial. After a 
baseline period of 1 month, placebo (n=20) or stiripentol (n=21) was added to valproate and clobazam 
during a double-blind period of 2 months. Patients then received stiripentol in an open fashion. 
Responders were defined as having more than 50% reduction in the frequency of clonic (or tonic-
clonic) seizures during the second month of the double-blind period compared with baseline. 15 (71%) 
patients were responders on stiripentol (including nine free of clonic or tonic-clonic seizures), whereas 
there was only one (5%) on placebo (none was seizure free; stiripentol 95% CI 52.1-90.7 vs. placebo 
0-14.6). The 95% CI of the difference was 42.2-85.7. Percentage of change from baseline was higher 
on stiripentol (-69%) than on placebo (+7%), p<0.0001. 21 patients on stiripentol had moderate side-
effects (drowsiness, loss of appetite) compared with eight on placebo, but side-effects disappeared 
when the dose of comedication was decreased in 12 of the 21 cases (Chiron et al, Lancet, 2000).  
There are no clinical study data to support the clinical safety of stiripentol administered at daily doses 
greater than 50 mg/kg/day.  
There are no clinical study data to support the use of stiripentol as monotherapy in Dravet’s syndrome. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The following pharmacokinetic properties of stiripentol have been reported from studies in adult 
healthy volunteers and adult patients. 
Absorption 
Stiripentol is quickly absorbed, with a time to peak plasma concentration of about 1.5 hours. The 
absolute bioavailability of stiripentol is not known since an intravenous formulation is not available 
for testing. It is well absorbed by the oral route since the majority of an oral dose is excreted in urine. 
Relative bioavailability between the capsules and powder for oral suspension in sachet formulations 
has been studied in healthy male volunteers after a 1,000 mg single oral administration. The two 
formulations were bioequivalent in terms of AUC but not in terms of Cmax. Cmax of the sachet was 
slightly higher (23%) compared with the capsule and did not meet the criteria for bioequivalence. Tmax 
was similar with both formulations. Clinical supervision is recommended if switching between the 
stiripentol capsule and powder for oral suspension in sachet formulations. 
Distribution 
Stiripentol binds extensively to circulating plasma proteins (about 99%). 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Systemic exposure to stiripentol increases markedly compared to dose proportionality. Plasma 
clearance decreases markedly at high doses; it falls from approximately 40 l/kg/day at the dose of 
600 mg/day to about 8 l/kg/day at the dose of 2,400 mg. Clearance is decreased after repeated 
administration of stiripentol, probably due to inhibition of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 
responsible for its metabolism. The half-life of elimination was in the range of 4.5 hours to 13 hours, 
increasing with dose. 
Biotransformation 
Stiripentol is extensively metabolized, 13 different metabolites having been found in urine. The main 
metabolic processes are demethylenation and glucuronidation, although precise identification of the 
enzymes involved has not yet been achieved. 
On the basis of in vitro studies, the principal liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes involved in phase 1 
metabolism are considered to be CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. 
Excretion 
Most stiripentol is excreted via the kidney. 
Urinary metabolites of stiripentol accounted collectively for the majority (73%) of an oral acute dose 
whereas a further 13-24% was recovered in faeces as unchanged substance. 
Paediatric population pharmacokinetic study 
A population pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 35 children with Dravet Syndrome treated with 
stiripentol  and  two  substances  not  known  to  affect  stiripentol  pharmacokinetics,  valproate  and 
clobazam.  The  median  age  was  7.3  years  (range:  1  to  17.6  years)  and  the  median  daily  dose  of 
stiripentol was 45.4 mg/kg/day (range: 27.1 to 89.3 mg/kg/day) received in two or three divided doses. 
The data were best fitted with a one compartment model with first order absorption and elimination 
processes.  The  population  estimate  for  the  absorption  rate  constant  Ka  was  2.08  hr-1  (standard 
deviation of random effect = 122%). Clearance and volume of distribution were related to body weight 
by an allometric model with exponents of 0.433 and 1, respectively: as body weight increased from 10 
to 60 kg, apparent oral clearance increased from 2.60 to 5.65 L/hr and apparent volume of distribution 
increased from 32.0 to 191.8 L. As a result, elimination half-life increased from 8.5hr (for 10 kg) to 
23.5 hr (for 60 kg). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Toxicity studies in animals (rat, monkey, mouse) have not revealed any consistent pattern of toxicity 
apart from liver enlargement associated with hepatocellular hypertrophy, which occurred when high 
doses of stiripentol were administered to both rodents and nonrodents. This finding is considered to be 
an adaptive response to a high metabolic burden on the liver.  
Stiripentol was not teratogenic when tested in the rat and rabbit; in one study in the mouse, but not in 
several other similar studies, a low incidence of cleft palate formation was observed at a maternotoxic 
dose (800 mg/kg/day). These studies in mice and rabbits were undertaken prior to the introduction of 
Good Laboratory Practice requirements. Studies in the rat on fertility and general reproductive 
performance and on pre- and postnatal development were uneventful except for a minor reduction in 
the survival of pups nursed by mothers exhibiting toxic responses to stiripentol at a dose of 
800 mg/kg/day (see section 4.6).  
Genotoxicity studies have not detected any mutagenic or clastogenic activity.  
Carcinogenicity studies gave negative results in the rat. In the mouse there was only a small increase 
in the incidence of hepatic adenomas and carcinomas in animals treated with 200 or 600 mg/kg/day for 
78 weeks but not in those given 60 mg/kg/day. In view of the lack of genotoxicity of stiripentol and 
the well known, special susceptibility of the mouse liver to tumour formation in the presence of 
hepatic enzyme induction, this finding is not considered to indicate a risk of tumorigenicity in patients.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Diacomit is indicated for use in conjunction with clobazam and valproate as adjunctive therapy of 
refractory generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy 
(SMEI, Dravet’s syndrome) whose seizures are not adequately controlled with clobazam and

experienced in the diagnosis and management of epilepsy in infants and children.  
Posology 
The dose of stiripentol is calculated on a mg/kg body weight basis. 
The daily dosage may be administered in 2 or 3 divided doses. 
The initiation of adjunctive therapy with stiripentol should be undertaken gradually using upwards 
dose escalation to reach the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day administered in conjunction with 
clobazam and valproate.  
Stiripentol dosage escalation should be gradual, starting with 20mg/kg/day for 1 week, then 
30mg/kg/day for 1 week. Further dosage escalation is age dependent: 
- children less than 6 years should receive an additional 20 mg/kg/day in the third week, thus 
achieving the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day in three weeks; 
- children from 6 to less than 12 years should receive an additional 10 mg/kg/day each week, thus 
achieving the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day in four weeks; 
- children and adolescents 12 years and older should receive an additional 5 mg/kg/day each week 
until the optimum dose is reached based on clinical judgment. 
The recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day is based on the available clinical study findings and was the 
only dose of Diacomit evaluated in the pivotal studies (see section 5.1). 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stiripentol must always be taken with food as it degrades rapidly in an acidic environment (e.g. 
exposure to gastric acid in an empty stomach). 
Stiripentol should not be taken with milk or dairy products (yoghurt, soft cream cheese, etc.), 
carbonated drinks, fruit juice or food and drinks that contain caffeine or theophylline 
Children aged less than 3 years 
The pivotal clinical evaluation of stiripentol was in children of 3 years of age and over with SMEI. 
The clinical decision for use of stiripentol in children with SMEI less than 3 years of age needs to be 
made on an individual patient basis taking into consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks. 
In this younger group of patients, adjunctive therapy with Diacomit should only be started when the 
diagnosis of SMEI has been clinically confirmed (see section 5.1). Data are limited about the use of 
stiripentol under 12 months of age. For these children the use of stiripentol will be done under the 
close supervision of the doctor. 
Patients aged ≥ 18 years of age 
Long-term data has not been collected in a sufficient number of adults to confirm maintenance of 
effect in this population. Treatment should be continued for as long as efficacy is observed. 
Dose adjustments of other antiepileptics used in combination with stiripentol 
Despite the absence of comprehensive pharmacology data on potential drug interactions, the following 
advice regarding modification of the dose and dosage schedules of other anti-epileptic medicinal 
products administered in conjunction with stiripentol is provided based on clinical experience. 
- Clobazam 
In the pivotal studies, when the use of stiripentol was initiated, the daily dose of clobazam was 
0.5 mg/kg/day usually administered in divided doses, twice daily. In the event of clinical signs of 
adverse reactions or overdose of clobazam (i.e., drowsiness, hypotonia, and irritability in young 
children), this daily dose was reduced by 25% every week. Approximately two to three-fold increases 
in clobazam and five-fold increases in norclobazam plasma levels respectively have been reported 
with co-administration of stiripentol in children with Dravet’s syndrome. 
- Valproate 
The potential for metabolic interaction between stiripentol and valproate is considered modest and 
thus, no modification of valproate dosage should be needed when stiripentol is added, except for 
clinical safety reasons. In the pivotal studies in the event of gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as 
loss of appetite, loss of weight, the daily dose of valproate was reduced by around 30% every week. 
Abnormal laboratory findings 
In the event of an abnormal blood count or liver function test finding, the clinical decision for 
continuing use or adjusting the dose of stiripentol in conjunction with adjusting the doses of clobazam 
and valproate needs to be made on an individual patient basis taking into consideration the potential 
clinical benefits and risks (see section 4.4). 
Effect of formulation 
The sachet formulation has a slightly higher Cmax than the capsules and thus the formulations are not 
bioequivalent. It is recommended that if a switch of formulations is required this is done under clinical 
supervision, in case of problems with tolerability (see section 5.2). 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Stiripentol is not recommended for use in patients with impaired hepatic and/or renal function (see 
section 4.4). 
Method of administration 
Oral use 
The powder should be mixed in a glass of water and should be taken immediately after mixing. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the interaction of stiripentol with food, please see section 4.5. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
A past history of psychoses in the form of episodes of delirium. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital 
These substances should not be used in conjunction with stiripentol in the management of Dravet’s 
syndrome. The daily dosage of clobazam and/or valproate should be reduced according to the onset of 
side effects whilst on stiripentol therapy (see section 4.2). 
Growth rate of children 
Given the frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions to treatment with stiripentol and valproate 
(anorexia, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting), the growth rate of children under this combination of 
treatment should be carefully monitored. 
Blood count 
Neutropenia may be associated with the administration of stiripentol, clobazam and valproate. Blood 
counts should be assessed prior to starting treatment with stiripentol. Unless otherwise clinically 
indicated, blood counts should be checked every 6 months. 
Liver function 
It should be assessed prior to starting treatment with stiripentol. Unless otherwise clinically indicated, 
liver function should be checked every 6 months. 
Hepatic or renal impairment 
In the absence of specific clinical data in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function, stiripentol is 
not recommended for use in patients with impaired hepatic and/or renal function (see section 4.2). 
Substances interfering with CYP enzymes 
Stiripentol is an inhibitor of the enzymes CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 and may markedly 
increase the plasma concentrations of substances metabolised by these enzymes and increase the risk 
of adverse reactions (see section 4.5). In vitro studies suggested that stiripentol phase 1 metabolism is 
catalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and possibly other enzymes. Caution is advised when 
combining stiripentol with other substances that inhibit or induce one or more of these enzymes. 
Paediatric population 
The pivotal clinical studies did not include children below 3 years old. As a consequence, it is 
recommended that children between 6 months and 3 years of age are carefully monitored whilst on 
stiripentol therapy. 
Stiripentol powder for oral suspension in sachet contains aspartame, a source of phenylalanine.  
Neither non-clinical nor clinical data are available to assess aspartame use in infants below 12 weeks 
of age. Therefore it may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria. Patients with rare glucose-
galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine, as the formulation contains glucose. As the 
flavouring component contains small amount of sorbitol, patients with hereditary problems of fructose 
intolerance should not take this medicine. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Potential medicinal product interactions affecting stiripentol 
The influence of other antiepileptic medicinal products on stiripentol pharmacokinetics is not well 
established. 
The impact of macrolides and azole antifungal medicinal product on stiripentol metabolism, that are 
known to be inhibitors of CYP3A4 and substrates of the same enzyme, is not known. Likewise, the 
effect of stiripentol on their metabolism is not known. 
In vitro studies suggested that stiripentol phase 1 metabolism is catalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and 
CYP3A4 and possibly other enzymes. Caution is advised when combining stiripentol with other 
substances that inhibit or induce one or more of these enzymes. 
Effect of stiripentol on cytochrome P450 enzymes 
Many of these interactions have been partially confirmed by in vitro studies and in clinical trials. The 
increase in steady state levels with the combined use of stiripentol, valproate, and clobazam is similar 
in adults and children, though inter-individual variability is marked. 
At therapeutic concentrations, stiripentol significantly inhibits several CYP450 isoenzymes: for 
example, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. As a result, pharmacokinetic interactions of metabolic 
origin with other medicines may be expected. These interactions may result in increased systemic 
levels of these active substances that may lead to enhanced pharmacological effects and to an increase 
in adverse reactions. 
Caution must be exercised if clinical circumstances require combining stiripentol with substances 
metabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. citalopram, omeprazole) or CYP3A4 (e.g. several HIV protease 
inhibitors, antihistamines such as astemizole and chlorpheniramine, calcium channel blockers, statins, 
oral contraceptives, codeine) due to the increased risk of adverse reactions (see further in this section 
for antiepileptic medicines). Monitoring of plasma concentrations or adverse reactions is 
recommended. A dose adjustment may be necessary. 
Co-administration with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be avoided due to 
the markedly increased risk of severe adverse reactions.  
Data on the potential for inhibition of CYP1A2 are limited, and therefore, interactions with 
theophylline and caffeine cannot be excluded because of increased plasma levels of theophylline and 
caffeine which may occur via inhibition of their hepatic metabolism, potentially leading to toxicity. 
Use in combination with stiripentol is not recommended. This warning is not only restricted to 
medicinal products but also to a considerable number of foods (for example: cola, chocolate, coffee, 
tea, and energy drinks) and nutritional products aimed at children: Patient should not drink cola drinks, 
which contain significant quantities of caffeine or chocolate, which contains trace amounts of 
theophylline (see section 4.2). 
As stiripentol inhibited CYP2D6 in vitro at concentrations that are achieved clinically in plasma, 
substances that are metabolized by this isoenzyme like: beta-blockers (propranolol, carvedilol, 
timolol), antidepressants (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, imipramine, clomipramine), antipsychotics 
(haloperidol), analgesics (codeine, dextromethorphan, tramadol) may be subject to metabolic 
interactions with stiripentol. A dose-adjustment may be necessary for substances metabolised by 
CYP2D6 and that are individually dose titrated. 
Potential for stiripentol to interact with other medicinal products 
In the absence of available clinical data, caution should be taken with the following clinically relevant 
interactions with stiripentol: 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Undesirable combinations (to be avoided unless strictly necessary) 
- Rye ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) 
Ergotism with possibility of necrosis of the extremities (inhibition of hepatic elimination of rye ergot). 
- Cisapride, halofantrine, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil 
Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and torsades de pointes/wave burst arrhythmia in particular. 
- Immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, cyclosporine, sirolimus) 
Raised blood levels of immunosuppressants (decreased hepatic metabolism). 
- Statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, etc.) 
Increased risk of dose-dependent adverse reactions such as rhabdomyolysis (decreased hepatic 
metabolism of cholesterol-lowering medicinal product). 
Combinations requiring precautions 
- Midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam 
Increased plasma benzodiazepine levels may occur via decreased hepatic metabolism leading to 
excessive sedation. 
- Chlorpromazine 
Stiripentol enhances the central depressant effect of chlorpromazine. 
- Effects on other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) 
Inhibition of CYP450 isoenzyme CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 may provoke pharmacokinetic interactions 
(inhibition of their hepatic metabolism) with phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
clobazam (see section 4.2), valproate (see section 4.2), diazepam (enhanced myorelaxation), 
ethosuximide, and tiagabine. The consequences are increased plasma levels of these anticonvulsants 
with potential risk of overdose. Clinical monitoring of plasma levels of other anticonvulsants when 
combined with stiripentol with possible dose adjustments is recommended. 
- Topiramate 
In a French compassionate use program for stiripentol, topiramate was added to stiripentol, clobazam 
and valproate in 41% of 230 cases. Based on the clinical observations in this group of patients, there is 
no evidence to suggest that a change in topiramate dose and dosage schedules is needed if co-
administered with stiripentol. 
With regard to topiramate, it is considered that potential competition of inhibition on CYP2C19 should 
not occur because it probably requires plasma concentrations 5-15 times higher than plasma 
concentrations obtained with the standard recommended topiramate dose and dosage schedules. 
- Levetiracetam 
Levetiracetam does not undergo hepatic metabolism to a major extent. As a result, no pharmacokinetic 
metabolic drug interaction between stiripentol and levetiracetam is anticipated. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Risk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general  
It has been shown that in the offspring of women with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is 
two to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population. Although other 
factors, e.g. the epilepsy, can contribute, available evidence suggests that this increase, to a large 
extent, is caused by the treatment. In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been 
noted with polytherapy. 
However, effective anti-epileptic therapy should not be interrupted during pregnancy, since the 
aggravation of the illness may be detrimental to both the mother and the foetus. 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk related to stiripentol 
No data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect 
harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, foetal development, parturition or postnatal development at 
non-maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). In view of the indication, administration of stiripentol during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential would not be expected. The clinical decision for 
use of stiripentol in pregnancy needs to be made on an individual patient basis taking into 
consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to 
pregnant women and use of efficient methods of contraception is advisable. 
Breastfeeding 
In the absence of human studies on excretion in breast milk, and given that stiripentol passes freely 
from plasma into milk in the goat, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment. In case 
stiripentol therapy is continued during breast-feeding, the breast-fed infant should be carefully 
observed for potential adverse effects. 
Fertility 
No impact on fertility was detected in animal studies (see section 5.3). No clinical data are available, 
potential risk for human is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Stiripentol has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines because it may cause dizziness 
and ataxia. Patients should be advised not to drive or use machines until they have gained sufficient 
experience to gauge whether it adversely affects their abilities (see section 4.8).  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common side effects with stiripentol are anorexia, weight loss, insomnia, drowsiness, ataxia, 
hypotonia and dystonia. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions encountered most often are as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to 
< 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable 
effects are presented in order of decreasing severity.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Many of the above adverse reactions are often due to an increase in plasma levels of other 
anticonvulsant medicinal products (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) and may regress when the dose of these 
medicinal products is reduced. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Data on clinical overdose are not available. Treatment is supportive (symptomatic measures in 
intensive care units).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX17 
Mechanism of action 
In animal models, stiripentol antagonizes seizures induced by electric shock, pentetrazole and 
bicuculline. In rodent models, stiripentol appears to increase brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid 
(GABA) - the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian brain. This could occur by inhibition of 
synaptosomal uptake of GABA and/or inhibition of GABA transaminase. Stiripentol has also been 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
shown to enhance GABAA receptor-mediated transmission in the immature rat hippocampus and 
increase the mean open-duration (but not the frequency) of GABAA receptor chloride channels by a 
barbiturate-like mechanism. Stiripentol potentiates the efficacy of other anticonvulsants, such as 
carbamazepine, sodium valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbital and many benzodiazepines, as the result 
of pharmacokinetic interactions. The second effect of stiripentol is mainly based on metabolic 
inhibition of several isoenzymes, in particular CYP450 3A4 and 2C19, involved in the hepatic 
metabolism of other anti-epileptic medicines. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The pivotal clinical evaluation of stiripentol was in children of 3 years of age and over with SMEI. 
A French compassionate use program included children from 6 months of age because the diagnosis of 
Dravet’s syndrome may be made with confidence at that age in some patients. The clinical decision for 
use of Diacomit in children with SMEI less than 3 years of age needs to be made on an individual 
patient basis taking into consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks (see section 4.2). 
41 children with SMEI were included in a randomised, placebo-controlled, add-on trial. After a 
baseline period of 1 month, placebo (n=20) or stiripentol (n=21) was added to valproate and clobazam 
during a double-blind period of 2 months. Patients then received stiripentol in an open fashion. 
Responders were defined as having more than 50% reduction in the frequency of clonic (or tonic-
clonic) seizures during the second month of the double-blind period compared with baseline. 15 (71%) 
patients were responders on stiripentol (including nine free of clonic or tonic-clonic seizures), whereas 
there was only one (5%) on placebo (none was seizure free; stiripentol 95% CI 52.1-90.7 vs. placebo 
0-14.6). The 95% CI of the difference was 42.2-85.7. Percentage of change from baseline was higher 
on stiripentol (-69%) than on placebo (+7%), p<0.0001. 21 patients on stiripentol had moderate side-
effects (drowsiness, loss of appetite) compared with eight on placebo, but side-effects disappeared 
when the dose of comedication was decreased in 12 of the 21 cases (Chiron et al, Lancet, 2000).  
There are no clinical study data to support the clinical safety of stiripentol administered at daily doses 
greater than 50 mg/kg/day.  
There are no clinical study data to support the use of stiripentol as monotherapy in Dravet’s syndrome. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The following pharmacokinetic properties of stiripentol have been reported from studies in adult 
healthy volunteers and adult patients. 
Absorption 
Stiripentol is quickly absorbed, with a time to peak plasma concentration of about 1.5 hours. The 
absolute bioavailability of stiripentol is not known since an intravenous formulation is not available 
for testing. It is well absorbed by the oral route since the majority of an oral dose is excreted in urine. 
Relative bioavailability between the capsules and powder for oral suspension in sachet formulations 
has been studied in healthy male volunteers after a 1,000 mg single oral administration. The two 
formulations were bioequivalent in terms of AUC but not in terms of Cmax. Cmax of the sachet was 
slightly higher (23%) compared with the capsule and did not meet the criteria for bioequivalence. Tmax 
was similar with both formulations. Clinical supervision is recommended if switching between the 
stiripentol capsule and powder for oral suspension in sachet formulations. 
Distribution 
Stiripentol binds extensively to circulating plasma proteins (about 99%). 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Systemic exposure to stiripentol increases markedly compared to dose proportionality. Plasma 
clearance decreases markedly at high doses; it falls from approximately 40 l/kg/day at the dose of 
600 mg/day to about 8 l/kg/day at the dose of 2,400 mg. Clearance is decreased after repeated 
administration of stiripentol, probably due to inhibition of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 
responsible for its metabolism. The half-life of elimination was in the range of 4.5 hours to 13 hours, 
increasing with dose. 
Biotransformation 
Stiripentol is extensively metabolized, 13 different metabolites having been found in urine. The main 
metabolic processes are demethylenation and glucuronidation, although precise identification of the 
enzymes involved has not yet been achieved. 
On the basis of in vitro studies, the principal liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes involved in phase 1 
metabolism are considered to be CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. 
Excretion 
Most stiripentol is excreted via the kidney. 
Urinary metabolites of stiripentol accounted collectively for the majority (73%) of an oral acute dose 
whereas a further 13-24% was recovered in faeces as unchanged substance. 
Paediatric population pharmacokinetic study 
A population pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 35 children with Dravet Syndrome treated with 
stiripentol  and  two  substances  not  known  to  affect  stiripentol  pharmacokinetics,  valproate  and 
clobazam.  The  median  age  was  7.3  years  (range:  1  to  17.6  years)  and  the  median  daily  dose  of 
stiripentol was 45.4 mg/kg/day (range: 27.1 to 89.3 mg/kg/day) received in two or three divided doses. 
The data were best fitted with a one compartment model with first order absorption and elimination 
processes.  The  population  estimate  for  the  absorption  rate  constant  Ka  was  2.08  hr-1  (standard 
deviation of random effect = 122%). Clearance and volume of distribution were related to body weight 
by an allometric model with exponents of 0.433 and 1, respectively: as body weight increased from 10 
to 60 kg, apparent oral clearance increased from 2.60 to 5.65 L/hr and apparent volume of distribution 
increased from 32.0 to 191.8 L. As a result, elimination half-life increased from 8.5hr (for 10 kg) to 
23.5 hr (for 60 kg). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Toxicity studies in animals (rat, monkey, mouse) have not revealed any consistent pattern of toxicity 
apart from liver enlargement associated with hepatocellular hypertrophy, which occurred when high 
doses of stiripentol were administered to both rodents and nonrodents. This finding is considered to be 
an adaptive response to a high metabolic burden on the liver.  
Stiripentol was not teratogenic when tested in the rat and rabbit; in one study in the mouse, but not in 
several other similar studies, a low incidence of cleft palate formation was observed at a maternotoxic 
dose (800 mg/kg/day). These studies in mice and rabbits were undertaken prior to the introduction of 
Good Laboratory Practice requirements. Studies in the rat on fertility and general reproductive 
performance and on pre- and postnatal development were uneventful except for a minor reduction in 
the survival of pups nursed by mothers exhibiting toxic responses to stiripentol at a dose of 
800 mg/kg/day (see section 4.6).  
Genotoxicity studies have not detected any mutagenic or clastogenic activity.  
Carcinogenicity studies gave negative results in the rat. In the mouse there was only a small increase 
in the incidence of hepatic adenomas and carcinomas in animals treated with 200 or 600 mg/kg/day for 
78 weeks but not in those given 60 mg/kg/day. In view of the lack of genotoxicity of stiripentol and 
the well known, special susceptibility of the mouse liver to tumour formation in the presence of 
hepatic enzyme induction, this finding is not considered to indicate a risk of tumorigenicity in patients.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Diacomit is indicated for use in conjunction with clobazam and valproate as adjunctive therapy of 
refractory generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy 
(SMEI, Dravet’s syndrome) whose seizures are not adequately controlled with clobazam and

experienced in the diagnosis and management of epilepsy in infants and children.  
Posology 
The dose of stiripentol is calculated on a mg/kg body weight basis. 
The daily dosage may be administered in 2 or 3 divided doses. 
The initiation of adjunctive therapy with stiripentol should be undertaken gradually using upwards 
dose escalation to reach the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day administered in conjunction with 
clobazam and valproate.  
Stiripentol dosage escalation should be gradual, starting with 20mg/kg/day for 1 week, then 
30mg/kg/day for 1 week.  Further dosage escalation is age dependent: 
- children less than 6 years should receive an additional 20 mg/kg/day in the third week, thus 
achieving the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day in three weeks; 
- children from 6 to less than 12 years should receive an additional 10 mg/kg/day each week, thus 
achieving the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day in four weeks; 
- children and adolescents 12 years and older should receive an additional 5 mg/kg/day each week 
until the optimum dose is reached based on clinical judgment. 
The recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day is based on the available clinical study findings and was the 
only dose of Diacomit evaluated in the pivotal studies (see section 5.1). 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stiripentol must always be taken with food as it degrades rapidly in an acidic environment (e.g. 
exposure to gastric acid in an empty stomach). 
Stiripentol should not be taken with milk or dairy products (yoghurt, soft cream cheese, etc.), 
carbonated drinks, fruit juice or food and drinks that contain caffeine or theophylline. 
Children aged less than 3 years 
The pivotal clinical evaluation of stiripentol was in children of 3 years of age and over with SMEI. 
The clinical decision for use of stiripentol in children with SMEI less than 3 years of age needs to be 
made on an individual patient basis taking into consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks. 
In this younger group of patients, adjunctive therapy with Diacomit should only be started when the 
diagnosis of SMEI has been clinically confirmed (see section 5.1). Data are limited about the use of 
stiripentol under 12 months of age. In these children, the use of stiripentol will be done under the close 
supervision of the doctor. 
Patients aged ≥ 18 years of age 
Long-term data has not been collected in a sufficient number of adults to confirm maintenance of 
effect in this population. Treatment should be continued for as long as efficacy is observed. 
Dose adjustments of other antiepileptics used in combination with stiripentol 
Despite the absence of comprehensive pharmacology data on potential drug interactions, the following 
advice regarding modification of the dose and dosage schedules of other anti-epileptic medicinal 
products administered in conjunction with stiripentol is provided based on clinical experience. 
- Clobazam 
In the pivotal studies, when the use of stiripentol was initiated, the daily dose of clobazam was 
0.5 mg/kg/day usually administered in divided doses, twice daily. In the event of clinical signs of 
adverse reactions or overdose of clobazam (i.e., drowsiness, hypotonia, and irritability in young 
children), this daily dose was reduced by 25% every week. Approximately two to three-fold increases 
in clobazam and five-fold increases in norclobazam plasma levels respectively have been reported 
with co-administration of stiripentol in children with Dravet’s syndrome. 
- Valproate 
The potential for metabolic interaction between stiripentol and valproate is considered modest and 
thus, no modification of valproate dosage should be needed when stiripentol is added, except for 
clinical safety reasons. In the pivotal studies in the event of gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as 
loss of appetite, loss of weight, the daily dose of valproate was reduced by around 30% every week. 
Abnormal laboratory findings 
In the event of an abnormal blood count or liver function test finding, the clinical decision for 
continuing use or adjusting the dose of stiripentol in conjunction with adjusting the doses of clobazam 
and valproate needs to be made on an individual patient basis taking into consideration the potential 
clinical benefits and risks (see section 4.4). 
Effect of formulation 
The sachet formulation has a slightly higher Cmax than the capsules and thus the formulations are not 
bioequivalent. It is recommended that if a switch of formulations is required this is done under clinical 
supervision, in case of problems with tolerability (see section 5.2). 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Stiripentol is not recommended for use in patients with impaired hepatic and/or renal function (see 
section 4.4). 
Method of administration 
Oral use 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The powder should be mixed in a glass of water and should be taken immediately after mixing. For the 
interaction of stiripentol with food, see section 4.5. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
A past history of psychoses in the form of episodes of delirium. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital 
These substances should not be used in conjunction with stiripentol in the management of Dravet’s 
syndrome. The daily dosage of clobazam and/or valproate should be reduced according to the onset of 
side effects whilst on stiripentol therapy (see section 4.2). 
Growth rate of children 
Given the frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions to treatment with stiripentol and valproate 
(anorexia, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting), the growth rate of children under this combination of 
treatment should be carefully monitored. 
Blood count 
Neutropenia may be associated with the administration of stiripentol, clobazam and valproate. Blood 
counts should be assessed prior to starting treatment with stiripentol. Unless otherwise clinically 
indicated, blood counts should be checked every 6 months. 
Liver function 
It should be assessed prior to starting treatment with stiripentol. Unless otherwise clinically indicated, 
liver function should be checked every 6 months. 
Hepatic or renal impairment 
In the absence of specific clinical data in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function, stiripentol is 
not recommended for use in patients with impaired hepatic and/or renal function (see section 4.2). 
Substances interfering with CYP enzymes 
Stiripentol is an inhibitor of the enzymes CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 and may markedly 
increase the plasma concentrations of substances metabolised by these enzymes and increase the risk 
of adverse reactions (see section 4.5). In vitro studies suggested that stiripentol phase 1 metabolism is 
catalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and possibly other enzymes. Caution is advised when 
combining stiripentol with other substances that inhibit or induce one or more of these enzymes. 
Paediatric population 
The pivotal clinical studies did not include children below 3 years old. As a consequence, it is 
recommended that children between 6 months and 3 years of age are carefully monitored whilst on 
Diacomit therapy. 
Diacomit powder for oral suspension in sachet contains aspartame, a source of phenylalanine. Neither 
non-clinical nor clinical data are available to assess aspartame use in infants below 12 weeks of age. 
Therefore it may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria. Patients with rare glucose-galactose 
malabsorption should not take this medicine, as the formulation contains glucose. As the flavouring 
component contains small amount of sorbitol, patients with hereditary problems of fructose 
intolerance should not take this medicine. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.   
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Potential medicinal product interactions affecting stiripentol 
The influence of other antiepileptic medicinal products on stiripentol pharmacokinetics is not well 
established. 
The impact of macrolides and azole antifungal medicinal product on stiripentol metabolism, that are 
known to be inhibitors of CYP3A4 and substrates of the same enzyme, is not known. Likewise, the 
effect of stiripentol on their metabolism is not known. 
In vitro studies suggested that stiripentol phase 1 metabolism is catalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and 
CYP3A4 and possibly other enzymes. Caution is advised when combining stiripentol with other 
substances that inhibit or induce one or more of these enzymes. 
Effect of stiripentol on cytochrome P450 enzymes 
Many of these interactions have been partially confirmed by in vitro studies and in clinical trials. The 
increase in steady state levels with the combined use of stiripentol, valproate, and clobazam is similar 
in adults and children, though inter-individual variability is marked. 
At therapeutic concentrations, stiripentol significantly inhibits several CYP450 isoenzymes: for 
example, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. As a result, pharmacokinetic interactions of metabolic 
origin with other medicines may be expected. These interactions may result in increased systemic 
levels of these active substances that may lead to enhanced pharmacological effects and to an increase 
in adverse reactions. 
Caution must be exercised if clinical circumstances require combining stiripentol with substances 
metabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. citalopram, omeprazole) or CYP3A4 (e.g. several HIV protease 
inhibitors, antihistamines such as astemizole and chlorpheniramine, calcium channel blockers, statins, 
oral contraceptives, codeine) due to the increased risk of adverse reactions (see further in this section 
for antiepileptic medicines). Monitoring of plasma concentrations or adverse reactions is 
recommended. A dose adjustment may be necessary. 
Co-administration with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be avoided due to 
the markedly increased risk of severe adverse reactions.  
Data on the potential for inhibition of CYP1A2 are limited, and therefore, interactions with 
theophylline and caffeine cannot be excluded because of increased plasma levels of theophylline and 
caffeine which may occur via inhibition of their hepatic metabolism, potentially leading to toxicity. 
Use in combination with stiripentol is not recommended. This warning is not only restricted to 
medicinal products but also to a considerable number of foods (for example: cola, chocolate, coffee, 
tea, and energy drinks) and nutritional products aimed at children: Patient should not drink cola drinks, 
which contain significant quantities of caffeine or chocolate, which contains trace amounts of 
theophylline (see section 4.2). 
As stiripentol inhibited CYP2D6 in vitro at concentrations that are achieved clinically in plasma, 
substances that are metabolized by this isoenzyme like: beta-blockers (propranolol, carvedilol, 
timolol), antidepressants (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, imipramine, clomipramine), antipsychotics 
(haloperidol), analgesics (codeine, dextromethorphan, tramadol) may be subject to metabolic 
interactions with stiripentol. A dose-adjustment may be necessary for substances metabolised by 
CYP2D6 and that are individually dose titrated. 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Potential for stiripentol to interact with other medicinal products 
In the absence of available clinical data, caution should be taken with the following clinically relevant 
interactions with stiripentol: 
Undesirable combinations (to be avoided unless strictly necessary) 
- Rye ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) 
Ergotism with possibility of necrosis of the extremities (inhibition of hepatic elimination of rye ergot). 
- Cisapride, halofantrine, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil 
Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and torsades de pointes/wave burst arrhythmia in particular. 
- Immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, cyclosporine, sirolimus) 
Raised blood levels of immunosuppressants (decreased hepatic metabolism). 
- Statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, etc.) 
Increased risk of dose-dependent adverse reactions such as rhabdomyolysis (decreased hepatic 
metabolism of cholesterol-lowering medicinal product).  
Combinations requiring precautions 
- Midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam 
Increased plasma benzodiazepine levels may occur via decreased hepatic metabolism leading to 
excessive sedation. 
- Chlorpromazine 
Stiripentol enhances the central depressant effect of chlorpromazine. 
- Effects on other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) 
Inhibition of CYP450 isoenzyme CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 may provoke pharmacokinetic interactions 
(inhibition of their hepatic metabolism) with phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
clobazam (see section 4.2), valproate (see section 4.2), diazepam (enhanced myorelaxation), 
ethosuximide, and tiagabine. The consequences are increased plasma levels of these anticonvulsants 
with potential risk of overdose. Clinical monitoring of plasma levels of other anticonvulsants when 
combined with stiripentol with possible dose adjustments is recommended. 
- Topiramate 
In a French compassionate use program for stiripentol, topiramate was added to stiripentol, clobazam 
and valproate in 41% of 230 cases. Based on the clinical observations in this group of patients, there is 
no evidence to suggest that a change in topiramate dose and dosage schedules is needed if co-
administered with stiripentol. 
With regard to topiramate, it is considered that potential competition of inhibition on CYP2C19 should 
not occur because it probably requires plasma concentrations 5-15 times higher than plasma 
concentrations obtained with the standard recommended topiramate dose and dosage schedules. 
- Levetiracetam 
Levetiracetam does not undergo hepatic metabolism to a major extent. As a result, no pharmacokinetic 
metabolic drug interaction between stiripentol and levetiracetam is anticipated. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Risk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general 
It has been shown that in the offspring of women with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is 
two to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population. Although other 
factors, e.g. the epilepsy, can contribute, available evidence suggests that this increase, to a large 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
extent, is caused by the treatment. In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been 
noted with polytherapy. 
However, effective anti-epileptic therapy should not be interrupted during pregnancy, since the 
aggravation of the illness may be detrimental to both the mother and the foetus. 
Risk related to stiripentol 
No data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect 
harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, foetal development, parturition or postnatal development at 
non-maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). In view of the indication, administration of stiripentol during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential would not be expected. The clinical decision for 
use of stiripentol in pregnancy needs to be made on an individual patient basis taking into 
consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to 
pregnant women and use of efficient methods of contraception is advisable. 
Breastfeeding 
In the absence of human studies on excretion in breast milk, and given that stiripentol passes freely 
from plasma into milk in the goat, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment. In case 
stiripentol therapy is continued during breast-feeding, the breast-fed infant should be carefully 
observed for potential adverse effects. 
Fertility 
No impact on fertility was detected in animal studies (see section 5.3). No clinical data are available, 
potential risk for human is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Stiripentol has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines because it may cause dizziness 
and ataxia. Patients should be advised not to drive or use machines until they have gained sufficient 
experience to gauge whether it adversely affects their abilities (see section 4.8).  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common side effects with stiripentol are anorexia, weight loss, insomnia, drowsiness, ataxia, 
hypotonia and dystonia. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions encountered most often are as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to 
< 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable 
effects are presented in order of decreasing severity.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Many of the above adverse reactions are often due to an increase in plasma levels of other 
anticonvulsant medicinal products (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) and may regress when the dose of these 
medicinal products is reduced. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Data on clinical overdose are not available. Treatment is supportive (symptomatic measures in 
intensive care units). 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX17 
Mechanism of action 
In animal models, stiripentol antagonizes seizures induced by electric shock, pentetrazole and 
bicuculline. In rodent models, stiripentol appears to increase brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid 
(GABA) - the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian brain. This could occur by inhibition of 
synaptosomal uptake of GABA and/or inhibition of GABA transaminase. Stiripentol has also been 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
shown to enhance GABAA receptor-mediated transmission in the immature rat hippocampus and 
increase the mean open-duration (but not the frequency) of GABAA receptor chloride channels by a 
barbiturate-like mechanism. Stiripentol potentiates the efficacy of other anticonvulsants, such as 
carbamazepine, sodium valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbital and many benzodiazepines, as the result 
of pharmacokinetic interactions. The second effect of stiripentol is mainly based on metabolic 
inhibition of several isoenzymes, in particular CYP450 3A4 and 2C19, involved in the hepatic 
metabolism of other anti-epileptic medicines. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The pivotal clinical evaluation of stiripentol was in children of 3 years of age and over with SMEI. 
A French compassionate use program included children from 6 months of age because the diagnosis of 
Dravet’s syndrome may be made with confidence at that age in some patients. The clinical decision for 
use of Diacomit in children with SMEI less than 3 years of age needs to be made on an individual 
patient basis taking into consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks (see section 4.2). 
41 children with SMEI were included in a randomised, placebo-controlled, add-on trial. After a 
baseline period of 1 month, placebo (n=20) or stiripentol (n=21) was added to valproate and clobazam 
during a double-blind period of 2 months. Patients then received stiripentol in an open fashion. 
Responders were defined as having more than 50% reduction in the frequency of clonic (or tonic-
clonic) seizures during the second month of the double-blind period compared with baseline. 15 (71%) 
patients were responders on stiripentol (including nine free of clonic or tonic-clonic seizures), whereas 
there was only one (5%) on placebo (none was seizure free; stiripentol 95% CI 52.1-90.7 vs. placebo 
0-14.6). The 95% CI of the difference was 42.2-85.7. Percentage of change from baseline was higher 
on stiripentol (-69%) than on placebo (+7%), p<0.0001. 21 patients on stiripentol had moderate side-
effects (drowsiness, loss of appetite) compared with eight on placebo, but side-effects disappeared 
when the dose of comedication was decreased in 12 of the 21 cases (Chiron et al, Lancet, 2000).  
There are no clinical study data to support the clinical safety of stiripentol administered at daily doses 
greater than 50 mg/kg/day.  
There are no clinical study data to support the use of stiripentol as monotherapy in Dravet’s syndrome. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The following pharmacokinetic properties of stiripentol have been reported from studies in adult 
healthy volunteers and adult patients. 
Absorption  
Stiripentol is quickly absorbed, with a time to peak plasma concentration of about 1.5 hours. The 
absolute bioavailability of stiripentol is not known since an intravenous formulation is not available 
for testing. It is well absorbed by the oral route since the majority of an oral dose is excreted in urine. 
Relative bioavailability between the capsules and powder for oral suspension in sachet formulations 
has been studied in healthy male volunteers after a 1,000 mg single oral administration. The two 
formulations were bioequivalent in terms of AUC but not in terms of Cmax. Cmax of the sachet was 
slightly higher (23%) compared with the capsule and did not meet the criteria for bioequivalence. Tmax 
was similar with both formulations. Clinical supervision is recommended if switching between the 
stiripentol capsule and powder for oral suspension in sachet formulations. 
Distribution 
Stiripentol binds extensively to circulating plasma proteins (about 99%). 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Systemic exposure to stiripentol increases markedly compared to dose proportionality. Plasma 
clearance decreases markedly at high doses; it falls from approximately 40 l/kg/day at the dose of 
600 mg/day to about 8 l/kg/day at the dose of 2,400 mg. Clearance is decreased after repeated 
administration of stiripentol, probably due to inhibition of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 
responsible for its metabolism. The half-life of elimination was in the range of 4.5 hours to 13 hours, 
increasing with dose. 
Biotransformation 
Stiripentol is extensively metabolized, 13 different metabolites having been found in urine. The main 
metabolic processes are demethylenation and glucuronidation, although precise identification of the 
enzymes involved has not yet been achieved. 
On the basis of in vitro studies, the principal liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes involved in phase 1 
metabolism are considered to be CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. 
Excretion 
Most stiripentol is excreted via the kidney. 
Urinary metabolites of stiripentol accounted collectively for the majority (73%) of an oral acute dose 
whereas a further 13-24% was recovered in faeces as unchanged substance. 
Paediatric population pharmacokinetic study 
A population pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 35 children with Dravet Syndrome treated with 
stiripentol  and  two  substances  not  known  to  affect  stiripentol  pharmacokinetics,  valproate  and 
clobazam.  The  median  age  was  7.3  years  (range:  1  to  17.6  years)  and  the  median  daily  dose  of 
stiripentol was 45.4 mg/kg/day (range: 27.1 to 89.3 mg/kg/day) received in two or three divided doses. 
The data were best fitted with a one compartment model with first order absorption and elimination 
processes.  The  population  estimate  for  the  absorption  rate  constant  Ka  was  2.08  hr-1  (standard 
deviation of random effect = 122%). Clearance and volume of distribution were related to body weight 
by an allometric model with exponents of 0.433 and 1, respectively: as body weight increased from 10 
to 60 kg, apparent oral clearance increased from 2.60 to 5.65 L/hr and apparent volume of distribution 
increased from 32.0 to 191.8 L. As a result, elimination half-life increased from 8.5hr (for 10 kg) to 
23.5 hr (for 60 kg). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Toxicity studies in animals (rat, monkey, mouse) have not revealed any consistent pattern of toxicity 
apart from liver enlargement associated with hepatocellular hypertrophy, which occurred when high 
doses of stiripentol were administered to both rodents and nonrodents. This finding is considered to be 
an adaptive response to a high metabolic burden on the liver.  
Stiripentol was not teratogenic when tested in the rat and rabbit; in one study in the mouse, but not in 
several other similar studies, a low incidence of cleft palate formation was observed at a maternotoxic 
dose (800 mg/kg/day). These studies in mice and rabbits were undertaken prior to the introduction of 
Good Laboratory Practice requirements. Studies in the rat on fertility and general reproductive 
performance and on pre- and postnatal development were uneventful except for a minor reduction in 
the survival of pups nursed by mothers exhibiting toxic responses to stiripentol at a dose of 
800 mg/kg/day (see section 4.6).  
Genotoxicity studies have not detected any mutagenic or clastogenic activity.  
Carcinogenicity studies gave negative results in the rat. In the mouse there was only a small increase 
in the incidence of hepatic adenomas and carcinomas in animals treated with 200 or 600 mg/kg/day for 
78 weeks but not in those given 60 mg/kg/day. In view of the lack of genotoxicity of stiripentol and 
the well known, special susceptibility of the mouse liver to tumour formation in the presence of 
hepatic enzyme induction, this finding is not considered to indicate a risk of tumorigenicity in patients.

Diacomit with food and drink 
Do NOT take Diacomit with milk or dairy products (yoghurt, soft cream cheeses, etc), fruit juice, fizzy 
drinks or food and drinks that contain caffeine or theophylline (for example cola, chocolate, coffee, tea 
and energy drinks).  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If your child is pregnant or breast-feeding, think she may be pregnant or is planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
During pregnancy, effective antiepileptic treatment must NOT be stopped.  
Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
This medicine may make your child feel sleepy. 
Your child should not use any tools, machines, ride or drive if affected in this way. Check with your 
child’s doctor.  
Diacomit contains sodium 
80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to take Diacomit 
Your child should always take these capsules exactly as your child’s doctor has told you. You should 
check with your child’s doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.  
Dosage 
The dose is adjusted by the doctor according to your child’s age, weight and condition, generally 
50 mg per kg bodyweight and per day.  
When to take Diacomit 
Your child should take this medicine two or three times a day at regular intervals as directed by your 
child’s doctor, for example morning - noon - bedtime to cover the night-and-day period.  
Dose adjustment 
Dose increases should be gradual, taking place over a few weeks while the dose(s) of the other 
antiepileptic medicine(s) is (are) reduced at the same time. Your child’s doctor will tell you the new 
dose of the other antiepileptic medicine(s). 
If you have the impression that the effect of this medicine is too strong or too weak, talk to your 
child’s doctor or pharmacist. The dose will be adjusted by the doctor according to your child’s 
condition.  
There are slight differences between the Diacomit capsules and powder for oral suspension. If your 
child experiences any problems when switching from taking the capsules to the powder for oral 
suspension or vice versa please inform your doctor. In case of switch between capsule and powder 
formulations it should be done under the close supervision of your child’s doctor. 
In case of vomiting within the first few minutes of intake it is assumed that no medicine has been 
absorbed and a new dose should be given. 
However, the situation is different if the vomiting occurs more than one hour after medicine intake 
because stiripentol is quickly absorbed.  
In such a case, it is assumed that a significant fraction of the administered dose has been absorbed 
systemically from the digestive tract. Thus, there would be no need for a new intake or for an 
adjustment of the next dose. 
How to take the Diacomit capsules 
To ensure that the whole amount of powder is taken by the patient, it is preferable not to open the 
capsule and to swallow it as a single oral administration unit form. Your child should take Diacomit 
with food, it should NOT be taken on an empty stomach. For food and drinks to be avoided, see the 
section “Diacomit with food and drink” above.  
If your child takes more Diacomit than he or she should 
Contact your child’s doctor if you know or think your child has taken more medicine than he or she 
should have.  
If your child forgets to take Diacomit 
It is important that your child takes this medicine regularly at the same time each day. If your child 
forgets to take a dose, he or she should take it as soon as you remember unless it is time for the next 
dose. In that case carry on with the next dose as normal. Your child should not take a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten individual dose. 
81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If your child stops taking Diacomit 
Your child must not stop taking this medicine unless the doctor tells you to. Stopping treatment 
suddenly can lead to an outbreak of seizures. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your child’s doctor or pharmacist.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Diacomit is and what it is used for 
Stiripentol, the active ingredient of Diacomit, belongs to a group of medicines called antiepileptics.  
It is used in conjunction with clobazam and valproate (other antiepileptic medicines) to treat a certain 
form of epilepsy called severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (Dravet’s syndrome), which affects 
children. Your child’s doctor has prescribed this medicine to help treat your child’s epilepsy.  
2.  What you need to know before your child takes Diacomit 
Your child must NOT take Diacomit 
• 
if your child is allergic to stiripentol or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if your child has ever experienced attacks of delirium (a mental state with confusion, 
excitement, restlessness and hallucinations). 
• 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your child’s doctor or pharmacist before taking Diacomit 
• 
• 
if your child has kidney or liver problems. 
Your child’s liver function should be assessed prior to starting Diacomit and checked every 6 
months. 
Your child’s blood count should be assessed prior to starting Diacomit and checked every 6 
months. 
Because of the frequency of gastrointestinal side effects with Diacomit, clobazam and valproate, 
such as anorexia, loss of appetite, vomiting, your child’s growth rate should be carefully 
monitored. 
• 
• 
If your child has problems with certain ingredients of Diacomit (e.g. aspartame, glucose, sorbitol). In 
this case, please see below: “Important information about some of the ingredients of Diacomit”.

drinks or food and drinks that contain caffeine or theophylline (for example cola, chocolate, coffee, tea 
and energy drinks).  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If your child is pregnant or breast-feeding, think she may be pregnant or is planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
During pregnancy, effective antiepileptic treatment must NOT be stopped.

Diacomit contains aspartame, glucose, sorbitol and sodium 
This medicine contains 2.5 mg aspartame in each 250mg-sachet and 5 mg each 500mg-sachet. 
Aspartame is a source of phenylalanine. It may be harmful if you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare 
genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because the body cannot remove it properly. 
This medicine contains sorbitol: 2.4 mg in each 250mg-sachet and 4.8 mg in each 500mg-sachet. 
Glucose may be harmful to the teeth. 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicinal product. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to take Diacomit 
Your child should always take the contents of each sachet exactly as your child’s doctor has told you. 
You should check with your child’s doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Dosage 
The dose is adjusted by the doctor according to your child’s age, weight and condition, generally 
50 mg per kg bodyweight and per day.  
When to take Diacomit 
Your child should take this medicine two or three times a day at regular intervals as directed by your 
child’s doctor: for example morning - noon - bed-time to cover the night-and-day period. 
Dose adjustment 
Dose increases should be gradual, taking place over a few weeks while the dose(s) of the other 
antiepileptic medicine(s) is (are) reduced at the same time. Your child’s doctor will tell you the new 
dose of the other antiepileptic medicine(s). 
If you have the impression that the effect of this medicine is too strong or too weak, talk to your 
child’s doctor or pharmacist. The dose will be adjusted by the doctor according to your child’s 
condition.  
Please consult your child’s doctor in the event of any side effects as the doctor may have to adjust the 
dose of this medicine and the other antiepileptic medicine(s). 
There are slight differences between the Diacomit capsules and powder for oral suspension. If your 
child experiences any problems when switching from taking the capsules to the powder for oral 
suspension or vice versa please inform your doctor. In case of switch between capsule and powder 
formulation it should be done under the close supervision of your child’s doctor. 
In case of vomiting within the first few minutes of intake it is assumed that no medicine has been 
absorbed and a new dose should be given. 
However, the situation is different if the vomiting occurs more than one hour after medicine intake 
because stiripentol is quickly absorbed. In such a case, it is assumed that a significant fraction of the 
administered dose has been absorbed systemically from the digestive tract. Thus, there would be no 
need for a new intake or for an adjustment of the next dose. 
How to take the Diacomit powder for oral suspension 
The powder should be mixed in a glass of water and should be taken immediately after mixing during 
the meal. Your child should take Diacomit with food, it should NOT be taken on an empty stomach. 
For food and drinks to be avoided, see the section “Diacomit with food and drink” above. 
If your child takes more Diacomit than he or she should 
Contact your child’s doctor if you know or think your child has taken more medicine than he or she 
should have.  
95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If your child forgets to take Diacomit 
It is important that your child takes this medicine regularly at the same time each day. If your child 
forgets to take a dose, he or she should take it as soon as you remember unless it is time for the next 
dose. In that case carry on with the next dose as normal. Your child should not take a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten individual dose. 
If your child stops taking Diacomit 
Your child must not stop taking this medicine unless the doctor tells you to. Stopping treatment 
suddenly can lead to an outbreak of seizures. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your child’s doctor or pharmacist.

The Labelling and PL have been updated accordingly. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

The MAH submitted a series of in vitro studies performed to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
characterise the activity of regadenoson as a substrate or 
data 
inhibitor of various human transporters.  
PL 
Regadenoson does not significantly inhibit the transporters 
OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2-K, 
BCRP, P-gp, BSEP, ENT 1 or ENT2 at 1 µM.  The data are 
insufficient to conclude about the risk of interactions at the 
level of these transporters given that a single concentration 
was evaluated in most instances. Regadenoson may have a 
modest inhibitory effect on the active renal transporter, 
OCT2, and has been found to be likely substrate for BCRP, 
ENT1 or ENT2 mediated transport. However, given the 
proposed duration of use, the effects of the drug 
transporters are unlikely to be clinically relevant.

following the recommendations from the AR for the 
second PSUR. The Package Leaflet was updated 
accordingly. 
C.I.z - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and 
Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation

section 4.8 of the SmPC. The MAH proposed and the CHMP 
agreed to add hypersensitivity reactions including rash, 
urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis and/or throat tightness 
under category “uncommon” in the adverse drug reactions 
table and to add the information that signs of 
hypersensitivity may be immediate or delayed onset.

tolerance of regadenoson in subjects with asthma or 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In this study 
dyspnoea was reported more frequently following Rapiscan 
(18% for patients with COPD; 11% for patients with 
asthma) than placebo, but at a lower rate than reported 
during clinical development however the use of 
bronchodilator therapy for symptoms was not different 
between Rapiscan and placebo. Section 5.1 of the SmPC 
was updated accordingly. Study 3606 CL-3002 was 
assessing the effect of caffeine intake on single photon 
emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial 
perfusion imaging (MPI) in subjects administered 
Regadenoson. The assessment of this study led to a 
conclusion that caffeine compromised the diagnostic 
accuracy of detecting reversible perfusion defects and 
resulted in modifications of section 5.1 of the SmPC.

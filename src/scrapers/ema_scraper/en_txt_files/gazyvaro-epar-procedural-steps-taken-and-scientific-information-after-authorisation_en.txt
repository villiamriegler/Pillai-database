Hodgkin’s lymphoma (GAO4753/GADOLIN), 97% (171 out 
of 176) of evaluable patients treated with Gazyvaro were 
B-cell depleted at the end of the treatment period, and 
97% (61 out of 63) remained depleted for more than 6 
months from the last dose. Recovery of B-cells was 
observed within 12-18 months of follow-up in 11% (5 out 
of 46) of evaluable patients. 
At final analysis, the median observation time was 45.9 
months (range: 0-100.9 months) for follicular lymphoma 
patients in the bendamustine arm and 57.3 months (range: 
0.4-97.6 months) for patients in the 
Gazyvaro+bendamustine arm, representing an additional 
25.6 months and 35.2 months of median follow-up in the 
two arms, respectively, since the primary analysis. Overall, 
the investigator assessed efficacy results were consistent 
with what was observed in the primary analysis.

Hypersensitivity may be difficult to clinically distinguish 
from infusion related reactions. Hypersensitivity symptoms 
can occur after previous exposure and very rarely with the 
first infusion. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected 
during or after an infusion, the infusion must be stopped 
and treatment permanently discontinued. Patients with 
known hypersensitivity to obinutuzumab must not be 
treated.

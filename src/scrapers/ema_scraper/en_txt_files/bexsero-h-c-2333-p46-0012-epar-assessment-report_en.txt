Primary 
To explore bactericidal antibody persistence in children at 40 months of age who previously received 
three doses of rMenB or rMenB+OMV NZ as infants in parent study V72P9.  
Secondary 
a)  To characterize the bactericidal antibody response of a booster dose of rMenB or rMenB+OMV 
NZ administered at 40 months of age to children who previously received three doses of the 
same vaccine as infants in parent study V72P9.  
b)  To explore bactericidal antibody persistence in children at 60 months of age who received a 
booster dose of rMenB or rMenB+OMV NZ at 40 months of age in the present extension study.  
c)  To assess the bactericidal antibody response of a two-dose catch-up regimen of rMenB+OMV

To assess the safety and tolerability of a booster dose of rMenB or rMenB+OMV NZ administered to 
children at 40 months of age who previously received three doses of the same vaccine as infants in 
parent study V72P9.  
Secondary 
To assess the safety and tolerability of a two-dose catch-up regimen of rMenB+OMV NZ administered 
to naive children starting at 40 and 60 months of age.  
•  Study design 
This study was an extension of study V72P9. It was conducted as an open-label, single centre study 
(Oxford Vaccine Group, Oxford University Centre for Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, Churchill 
Hospital, Oxford, UK).  
•  Study population /Sample size 
57 subjects completed parent study V72P9 and were potentially eligible for the extension study. Of 
these, 16 and 14 subjects were enrolled into groups 4rMenB and 4rMenB+OMV NZ respectively.  
Two groups of newly recruited, naive subjects, 40 months and 60 months of age, were also enrolled 
into the study. 50 subjects were to be enrolled in each group. 41 subjects were enrolled in group III 
and 49 subjects were enrolled in group IV.  
Subjects eligible to be enrolled in the study were healthy 40-44 months old children who participated 
and completed the V72P9 study; naive subjects aged 40 to 44 months and 60 to 62 months; for whom 
a parent/legal guardian has given written informed consent after the nature of the study has been 
explained; available for all the visits scheduled in the study; in good health as determined by: medical 
history, physical examination and clinical judgment of the investigator.  
• 
Treatments 
Subjects who completed study V72P9 and who met all other enrollment criteria were eligible to 
participate in this extension study. These subjects were treated as follows:  
o  Group I (4rMenB): Subjects who were vaccinated at 6-8 months of age, two months later 
and at 12 months of age with rMenB vaccine in Study V72P9 were vaccinated with a single 
booster dose of rMenB at 40 months of age.  
o  Group II (4rMenB+OMV): Subjects who were vaccinated at 6-8 months of age, two months 
later, and at 12 months of age with rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine in study V72P9 were vaccinated 
with a single booster dose of rMenB+OMV NZ at 40 months of age.  
o  Group III (Naive_4042) and Group IV (Naive_6062): Two groups of naive subjects were 
recruited at 40 and 60 months of age and were vaccinated with two doses of rMenB+OMV NZ, 
given two months apart (see below). The pre vaccination antibody level for the group recruited 
at 40 months of age (group III) served as a baseline to assess antibody persistence at 40 
months of age for groups I and II. Responses following the first injection of this group also 
served as a comparator to evaluate booster responses and the presence of immunological 
memory for groups I and II. The prevaccination antibody level for the group recruited at 60 
months of age (group IV) was to serve as a baseline to evaluate antibody persistence at 60 
months of age for groups I through III.  
Assessment report under Article 46  
EMA/646697/2014  
Page 4/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Both groups III and IV also provided data on two-dose catch-up vaccinations in children 40 and 60 
months of age, as described below.  
o  Group III (Naive_4042): Naive subjects recruited at 40 months of age were vaccinated with 
two doses of rMenB+OMV NZ, given two months apart, at 40 and 42 months of age.  
o  Group IV (Naive_6062): Naive subjects recruited at 60 months of age were to be vaccinated 
with two doses of rMenB+OMV NZ, given two months apart, at 60 and 62 months of age.  
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Immunogenicity endpoints 
Serum bactericidal activity was measured against N. meningitidis serogroup B strains H44/76, 5/99, 
NZ98/254 and M10713. Data were summarized by calculating hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs), 
percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:4 and ≥1:8, and additionally ≥1:5 and percentage of subjects 
with fourfold increase over baseline. Antibody responses to vaccine antigen 287-953 were also 
determined by ELISA and summarized by geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and four-fold rises.  
Antibody persistence and immune responses were interpreted using data from the naive groups of 
children recruited at 40 months and 60 months of age, as indicated below. 
o  Baseline antibody levels measured in naive subjects at 40 months of age (Group III) served as 
a descriptive comparator to evaluate antibody persistence at 40 months of age for Groups I 
and II.  
o  Responses to the first catch-up dose of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to naive subjects at 40 
months of age (Group III) served as a descriptive comparator to evaluate the booster response 
and, in turn, the presence of immunological memory in Groups I and II.  
o  Baseline antibody levels measured in naive subjects at 60 months of age (Group IV) served as 
a descriptive comparator to evaluate antibody persistence at 60 months of age post-boost in 
Groups I and II and post-two catch-up doses in Group III.  
Safety endpoints 
All subjects who received at least one dose of investigational vaccine and provided post vaccination 
safety data (defined as the safety population) were included in the safety and tolerability analyses. All 
safety analyses were descriptive  
Local and Systemic Adverse Events  
Incidences of local adverse events (i.e., pain, erythema, induration, swelling) and systemic reactions 
(i.e., fever [defined as axillary temperature ≥38°C], change in eating habits, sleepiness, irritability, 
vomiting, diarrhea, arthralgia, headache and rash) occurring during the 7 days following each 
rMenB±OMV NZ vaccination were summarized by maximal severity and study group. Additionally, the 
numbers of subjects who used antipyretic medication (prophylactically or therapeutically) within 7 days 
of rMenB±OMV NZ vaccination were summarized. Erythema, induration and swelling were categorized 
as none, 0< -10 mm, 10- < 25 mm, 25- < 50 mm, 50 -< 100 mm and ≥ 100 mm. Temperature taken 
by the axillary route were categorized as < 38°C, 38- < 38.5°C, 38.5- < 39°C, 39 -< 39.5°C, 39.5- < 
40°C and ≥ 40°C. All other systemic reactions were categorized as none, mild, moderate or severe. 
Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs)  
Assessment report under Article 46  
EMA/646697/2014  
Page 5/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All AEs occurring during the 7 days following each study vaccination were collected. AEs that require a 
medical visit and/or resulting in premature withdrawal from the study, as well as serious adverse 
events (SAEs), were collected throughout the study period, except for the 7 days after each study 
vaccination in which all AEs were collected.  
All reported AEs, as well as AEs at least possibly related to rMenB±OMV NZ vaccine were summarized 
according to system organ class and preferred term within each system organ class. These summaries 
were presented by treatment group. When an AE occurred more than once for a subject, the maximal 
severity and strongest relationship to the vaccine was counted. Additionally, three separate summaries 
of AEs were generated as follows: (i) SAEs, (ii) AEs that are possibly or probably related to vaccine, 
and (iii) AEs that are unrelated to vaccine. Data listings of all AEs were provided by subject. In 
addition, a summary of the primary termination reasons, a listing of subjects withdrawn from the study 
because of an AE, and a listing of all termination reasons were presented.  
•  Statistical Methods 
Due to the small sample sizes, the analyses of safety and immunogenicity were purely descriptive. As 
such, no statistical tests were performed.  
The primary analyses of the immunogenicity results were based on the modified Intention-to-treat 
population (MITT). All safety analyses were based on the safety population.  
  Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
In total, 120 subjects were enrolled in this extension study. This included 16 subjects in the 4rMenB 
vaccine group, 14 subjects in the 4rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine group, 41 subjects in the Naive_4042 
vaccine group and 49 subjects in the Naive_6062 vaccine group. Of these, a total of 102 subjects 
(85%) from all the vaccine groups completed the study, as per the criteria specified in the protocol. 
The primary reason for withdrawal of subjects was “Withdrawal of Consent” (10 subjects), followed by 
“Lost to Follow-up” (6 subjects). A summary of reasons for study termination in all vaccine groups is 
presented in Table 10.1-1. 115 subjects were part of immunogenicity MITT analysis for persistency and 
108 subjects were part of the immunogenicity PP analysis for persistency (table 11.1-1).  
Of the 120 subjects enrolled in the study, 119 subjects received at least one study injection and were 
thus included in the safety analyses.

Assessor´s comment: It is noted that the number of enrolled subjects is limited and that about half of 
the eligible subjects from the parent study were enrolled into this extension study. It is also noted that 
the proportion of withdrawals was considerably higher in group Naive_4042 than in other groups. The 
study groups are small and interpretation of data and comparisons between groups should therefore be 
made with caution. Due to the limited sample size, no firm conclusions are drawn from the data 
presented from this study.

•  Baseline data 
Overall the demographic and other baseline characteristics for the enrolled population in all four 
vaccine groups were similar, except for the gender differences. There was an unequal distribution of 
males and females in the 4rMenB+OMV NZ, Naive_4042 and Naive_6062 vaccine groups. Higher 
percentages of females were enrolled in the 4rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine group (79%) and Naive_4042 
vaccine group (54%). In the Naive_6062 vaccine group, higher percentages of males (57%) were 
enrolled.

Prior to booster vaccination at 40 months of age, GMTs and proportions of seropositive subjects in the 
vaccinated group had decreased to low levels approaching baseline and were comparable to those of 
the naïve group for all reference strains except strain 5/99. For strain 5/99 vaccinated subjects had a

mean GMT of 29 (18-47) compared to 1 (1-1) of naive subjects, and 100% of vaccinated subjects 
were seropositive whereas none of the naïve subjects were seropositive. 
Assessor´s comment: The decrease in GMTs and proportion of seropositive subjects was not 
unexpected and could indicate the need for a booster vaccination at 40 months of age. However, the 
number of subjects is very small, and confirmation is needed from larger studies. 
Secondary endpoints 
a.  To characterize the bactericidal antibody response of a booster dose of rMenB or rMenB+OMV 
NZ administered at 40 months of age to children who previously received three doses of the 
same vaccine as infants in parent study V72P9.

One month post booster or first vaccination in the extension study subjects receiving booster 
vaccinations had higher levels of GMTs and a greater proportion of subjects were seropositive as 
compared to naïve individuals indicating the presence of immunological memory. The levels of GMTs 
after booster at 40 months of age were at the same level or slightly lower than those induced by the 
third vaccination dose at 12 months of age (table 11.4.1.1-1, primary endpoint).

b.  To explore bactericidal antibody persistence in children at 60 months of age who received a 
booster dose of rMenB or rMenB+OMV NZ at 40 months of age in the present extension study.

20 months post booster vaccination at 40 months of age GMTs had decreased for all strains and were 
approaching the levels prior to the booster dose except for strain 5/99 where a GMT of 119 (56-252) 
was demonstrated. 
Assessment report under Article 46  
EMA/646697/2014  
Page 15/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c.  To assess the bactericidal antibody response of a two-dose catch-up regimen of rMenB+OMV 
NZ administered to naive children at 40 and 42 months of age or at 60 and 62 months of age.

Following the second vaccination an increase in GMTs was demonstrated for all strains in both groups. 
Levels were, however lower than those of group 4rMenB+OMV one month after the second the 
injection at 8-10 months of age for all strains except NZ98/254 (see table 11.4.1.1-1, primary 
endpoint). At 18 months after the second injection a decrease in GMTs was demonstrated.

Assessor´s comment: although it appears that the levels of GMTs induced after two vaccinations in 
children aged 40/42 or 60/62 months are lower than those in children vaccinated before 12 months of 
age the clinical relevance of this is unclear. 
d.  To explore bactericidal antibody persistence in children at 60 months of age who received a 
two-dose catch-up regimen of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to naive children at 40 and 42 
months of age in the present extension study

At 18 months post second injections GMT levels had decreased and approached baseline for all strains 
except for strain 5/99 where levels were slightly higher and 100% of subjects were still seropositive.

Immune response for Vaccine antigen 287-953  
Booster vaccination induced a marked increase in GMC levels for all strains. After 20 months levels had 
declined but were still above baseline. Two vaccinations given to naïve subjects induced a clear 
increase in GMCs, but at a lower level than in subject receiving the full primary vaccination schedule + 
booster.

Assessor’s general comment on efficacy results:  
Due to the limited sample size, no firm conclusions are drawn from the data presented from this study 
and interpretation of data and comparisons between groups should be made with caution. Responses 
presented in this extension study are comparative to what has been presented from other studies and 
there is no concern to indicate reduced immunogenicity of vaccination from the data presented here. 
It is noted that baseline values for strain M10713 in the newly recruited groups Naive_4042 and 
Naive_6062 are high. The analytical method for this strain was, however, subject to discussion during 
initial assessment, and the ELISA was also considered relevant. This issue will not be commented on 
further in this report. 
•  Safety results 
A summary of local and systemic solicited adverse events and unsolicited adverse events occurring by 
vaccination group is provided in tables 12.2.3.1-1, 12.2.3.1-2 and 12.2.3.2-1 respectively.

A total of 7 subjects experienced at least one SAE. A summary of subjects with SAEs in all the four 
vaccine groups is presented in Table 12.3.1.2-1. Except for one SAE (febrile convulsion, from the 
Naive_4042 vaccine group), all other SAEs were considered not to be related to study vaccines.  
Subject 01/334 in group Naïve_4042 was febrile (39.9 degrees) and developed febrile convulsions 
lasting few minutes approximately 8 hours post second vaccination. The event resolved completely 
without hospitalization within two days.

Assessor’s comment: The safety results presented in this study are in agreement with previously 
presented results, and no new safety concerns are raised based on this study.  
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
The submitted study was intended to explore aspects of persistence of immunogenicity and safety 
following different vaccination schedules in children aged up to 60 months of age. The results generally 
confirm what is already known regarding immunogenicity and safety of Bexsero. Therefore no further 
regulatory action regarding Bexsero is required based on the presented results.

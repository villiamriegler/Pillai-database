Jylamvo EMEA/H/A-31/1463/C/3756/0002  
Nordimet EMEA/H/A-31/1463/C/3983/0006 
requested on 22 March 2018 the opinion of the 
European Medicines Agency further to serious cases 
of overdose, sometimes fatal, having been reported 
in patients inadvertently receiving the product daily 
instead of weekly for indications that require weekly 
dosing despite additional risk minimisation measures 
having been put in place by several Member States. 
The CHMP was requested to assess the impact 
thereof on the benefit-risk balance of methotrexate-
containing medicinal products and to give its 
recommendation whether the marketing 
Page 3/5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
authorisation of these products should be 
maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
As the request results from the evaluation of data 
resulting from pharmacovigilance activities, the 
CHMP opinion should be adopted on the basis of a 
recommendation of the Pharmacovigilance Risk 
Assessment Committee (PRAC).

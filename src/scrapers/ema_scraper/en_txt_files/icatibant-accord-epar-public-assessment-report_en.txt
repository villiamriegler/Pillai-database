2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Quality aspects
2.1.1.  Introduction
The finished product is presented as solution for injection containing 30 mg of icatibant (as acetate) as the 
active substance in 3 mL solution (10 mg/mL).
Other ingredients are: sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, glacial acetic acid and water for injection.
The product is available in a pre-filled syringe (type I glass) with plunger stopper (bromobutyl coated with 
fluorocarbon polymer) as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. A 3 mL syringe is used and a hypodermic 
needle (25 G; 16 mm) is included in the pack. The product is intended for single administration.
2.1.2.  Active substance
General information
The information on icatibant was provided in the form of an active substance master file (ASMF).
Icatibant is a synthetic decapeptide. It consists of ten amino acids in the following sequence: H-D-Arg-Arg-
Pro-Hyp-Gly-Thi-Ser-D-Tic-Oic-Arg-OH.
The chemical name of icatibant acetate is D-arginyl-L-arginyl-L-prolyl-L[(4R)-4-hydroxyprolyl]-glycyl-L[3-(2-
thienyl)Alanyl]-L-seryl-D-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-3-ylcarbonyl)-L[(3as,7as)octahydroindol-2-
ylcarbonyl]-L-arginine, acetate salt corresponding to the molecular formula C59H89N19O13S. It has a relative 
molecular mass of 1304.52 g/mol and the following structure:
Assessment report 
EMA/306744/2021
Page 8/19
Figure 1: active substance structure
The chemical structure of icatibant was elucidated by various analytical techniques and found satisfactory.  
The active substance is a white or off-white powder in amorphous form. It is optically active due to the 
presence of chiral centres in the amino acids. It is freely soluble in water and hygroscopic by nature. Optical 
rotation is routinely controlled as part of the active substance specification.
Solid state properties of the active substance such as particle size or potential changes in polymorphic form 
are not critical since the active substance is dissolved in the finished product (solution for injection).
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of 
the ASMF and was considered satisfactory.
The active substance in produced by one manufacturer.
Icatibant acetate is synthesised in three main steps using commercially available well-defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications. 
The designation of the starting materials is in line with ICH Q11 and its Q&A document.
Acceptable limits for impurities (specified, unspecified and total impurities) in the starting materials have 
been established. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and 
control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised.
The optical purity of amino acid derivatives and peptides has been investigated to demonstrate that 
racemisation does not occur.
Sufficient data has been presented to confirm comparability to the reference product Firazyr. 
No genotoxic or potentially genotoxic impurities were identified.

EMA/306744/2021
Page 9/19
All solvents and reagents used throughout the manufacture are commonly used for peptide synthesis. 
Carry-over of residual solvents as well as Class 1 solvents which could be contaminants in other solvents has 
been studied in line with ICH Q3C and CPMP/ICH/283/95. 
The active substance is packaged in a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle. The primary packaging 
material complies with Ph. Eur. chapter 3.2.2 on plastic containers.
Specification
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identity (MS, HPLC, IR), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), specific optical rotation (USP), colour & clarity 
of solution in water (USP), solubility in water (USP), pH (USP), bacterial endotoxins (USP) and microbial 
enumeration (USP) and absence of E. coli (USP).
Limits for impurities are set in line with ICH Q3A. The limit for total impurities is considered acceptable based 
on batch analysis data.
The absence of elemental impurities as per ICH Q3D Option 1 has been demonstrated.
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay testing and the three working standards for impurity testing has been presented.
Batch analysis data of three commercial-scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.
Stability
Stability data of active substance, which is of commercial scale and manufactured by the proposed 
manufacturer, stored in packaging representative of the commercial packaging for up to 48 months under 
long term conditions and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions according to the ICH guidelines, 
were provided. No significant changes were observed, and the results were within specifications.
The parameters tested are the same as for release. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release and were stability indicating. 
Forced degradation studies have been performed and the active substance degrades under conditions of light, 
high temperature and humidity as well as acidic, alkali and oxidative conditions. An increase in impurity 
levels was observed.
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable under the proposed storage conditions (store in tight, light resistant containers, store in freezer 
(-20±5°C)). The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.
2.1.3.  Finished medicinal product
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development
The finished product icatibant, solution for injection, 30 mg/3 mL is presented as a clear, colourless solution 
in a clear glass pre-filled syringe (PFS). 
Assessment report 
EMA/306744/2021
Page 10/19
The purpose of pharmaceutical development was to develop a generic formulation of icatibant, solution for 
injection, 30 mg/3 mL which is equivalent to the reference product Firazyr.
The generic product has the same pharmaceutical form, the same qualitative and quantitative composition in 
terms of the active substance and the same qualitative composition in terms of excipients as the reference 
product Firazyr (solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe). Both the generic and the reference product 
contain the active substance in the acetate form.
Since the finished product is a solution, solid-state properties of the active substance have no impact on 
performance of the finished product.
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Sufficient  information  related  to  the  development  of  the  finished  product  has  been  provided.  Comparative 
structural  and  performance  investigations  confirm  the  similarity  of  the  generic  product  with  the  reference 
product.
The choice of the excipients has been justified, and their functions explained. The compatibility of excipients 
with the active substances was proven by stability studies.
No bioequivalence study was required since the finished product is a parenteral dosage form and is 
administered as an aqueous solution containing the same active substance in the same concentration as the 
reference product.
Sufficient information related to manufacturing process development has been provided. Several studies have 
been performed to optimise the manufacturing process of the finished product. The process is robust and 
suitable for industrial manufacturing. 
The materials involved in the manufacturing process of the final product have been described in sufficient 
detail and their compatibility with the finished product has been adequately demonstrated.
The microbial attributes for the finished product are sufficiently monitored by sterility and bacterial 
endotoxins testing in the finished product at release and during the stability studies. Additional assurance of 
the microbiological quality of the product is provided by container closure integrity testing.
The primary packaging for the 3 mL of solution is a 3 mL pre-filled syringe (type I glass) with plunger stopper 
(bromobutyl coated with fluorocarbon polymer). The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. 
The proposed container closure system is the same as used for the reference product and considered 
adequate. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for 
the intended use of the product. 
A hypodermic needle (25 G; 16 mm) is included in the pack. The injection needle is a non-integral medical 
device, complies with Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC and has CE mark certification. Icatibant Accord is 
indicated for adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and older. No graduation is needed on the 
syringes as the complete content of the syringes is injected for adult patients. When used in the paediatric 
population, where the dose is less than 30 mg (3 ml) based on body weight, additional equipment 
(connector, 3 ml graduated syringe) is required to extract the appropriate dose. This information included in 
the SmPC section 6.6 and is in line with the SmPC of the reference product.

Information has been provided on the extractables and leachables study. All leachables were found below the 
Analytical Evaluation Threshold.
Manufacture of the product and process controls
The manufacturing process consists of three main steps: mixing of the active substance and excipients with 
pH adjustment, filtration and terminal sterilisation. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing 
process.
The finished product is terminally sterilised in the final container by heat using the reference condition of the 
European Pharmacopeia for steam sterilisation.
Validation of the manufacturing process has been completed on three commercial scale batches. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and 
pharmaceutical form.
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description, 
identification (HPLC), colour of solution (Ph. Eur.), clarity of solution (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), extractable 
volume (Ph. Eur.), impurities (HPLC), assay (HPLC), particulate contamination (Ph. Eur.), bacterial 
endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.), break loose force (in house), glide force (in 
house) and uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.).
The proposed specifications are compliant with ICH Q6A and cover appropriate parameters for this dosage 
form.
The proposed limits for the impurities have been appropriately justified. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk assessment and the 
presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in 
the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and 
answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures 
are deemed necessary.
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines or reference is made to the relevant Ph. Eur. chapters. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been 
presented.

EMA/306744/2021
Page 12/19
Batch analysis data for several commercial scale batches of the finished product used in process validation 
and stability studies have been provided confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its 
ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product
Stability data from several production-scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under 
long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are representative of those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. The analytical 
procedures used are stability indicating. No significant change was observed, and all the results met the 
established criteria. Overall, the tested parameters are considered adequate to indicate stability sufficiently. 
In addition, one batches was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug Substances and Products. The product was found not to be sensitive to light in clear glass syringes.
The expiry date of the product is calculated in accordance with the Note for Guidance on Start of the Shelf-
life of the Finished Dosage Form (CPMP/QWP/072/96). 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is 
acceptable. The medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions. Considering the finished 
product is in glass containers and to be in line with products on the market, the supplementary warning “Do 
not freeze” has been included in the SmPC (section 6.4).
Adventitious agents
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.
2.1.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.1.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.1.6.  Recommendations for future quality development
Not applicable.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects
2.2.1.  Introduction
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological 
properties of icatibant are well known. As icatibant is a well-known active substance, overview based on 
mostly literature review is, thus, appropriate. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC 
of the reference product. 
The applicant provided a revised Module 4 with inclusion of the toxicology study according to the eCTD 
structure, and a revised non-clinical overview, with inclusion of more detailed information on the performed 
toxicological study. The impurity profile has been discussed and the data provided is considered acceptable. 
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
The applicant has provided updated information related to environmental risk assessment. The presented 
data allows the conclusion that the medicinal product is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment. This 
was justified by the applicant as the introduction of Icatibant Accord manufactured by Accord Healthcare 
S.L.U. is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for 
all icatibant containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA 
is expected to be similar.
2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects
There are no objections to approval of Icatibant Accord from a non-clinical point of view.
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Icatibant Accord and justifications that 
icatibant does not differ in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the reference product was 
provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional 
non-clinical studies were not considered necessary.
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction
This is an application for a solution for injection containing icatibant. This application concerns a generic 
version of icatibant acetate solution for injection. The reference product Firazyr is indicated for symptomatic 
treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years 
and older, with C1-esterase-inhibitor deficiency.
Icatibant  is  a  selective  competitive  antagonist  at  the  bradykinin  type  2  (B2)  receptor.  It  is  a  synthetic 
decapeptide with a structure similar to bradykinin, but with 5 non-proteinogenic amino acids. In HAE increased 
bradykinin concentrations are the key mediator in the development of the clinical symptoms.

2.6.  Product information
2.6.1.  User consultation
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of 
a bridging report making reference to Firazyr). The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been 
found acceptable.
3.  Benefit-risk balance
This application concerns a generic version of icatibant acetate solution for injection. The reference product 
Firazyr is indicated for symptomatic treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adults, 
adolescents and children aged 2 years and older, with C1-esterase-inhibitor deficiency.
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application apart from impurity toxicity studies and an 
adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and 
considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the 
applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was 
considered sufficient.
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information.
4.  Recommendation
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Icatibant Accord is favourable in the following indication:
Icatibant Accord is indicated for symptomatic treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in 
adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and older, with C1-esterase-inhibitor deficiency.
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Introduction 
On 03 August 2015, the MAH submitted the completed paediatric study for Humira, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006. 
This application concerns the final Clinical Study Report (CSR) for study M04-717 which was completed 
on 3 February 2015. An interim CSR of the same study was used to support the Type II variation 
application EMEA/H/C/481/II/134 that was approved in March 2015. This Type II variation included 
use in paediatric patients (from 4 years of age) with severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The cut-off date 
for the interim CSR was the date when the last subject completed Period C of the study (2 December 
2013).  
A short critical expert overview was provided. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study M04-717 is a stand-alone study.  
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study  
Humira 40 mg/0.8 ml solution for injection for paediatric use contains 40 mg of adalimumab. 
Adalimumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary 
cells. 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report(s) for: 
• 
Study M04-717 A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Dummy, Double-Blind Study Evaluating 
Two Doses of Adalimumab versus Methotrexate (MTX) in Pediatric Subjects with Chronic Plaque 
Psoriasis (Ps)

Study M04-717: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Dummy, Double-Blind Study Evaluating Two 
Doses of Adalimumab versus Methotrexate (MTX) in Pediatric Subjects with Chronic Plaque Psoriasis 
(Ps) 
Description 
Study M04-717 consisted of 4 treatment periods, summarised in the table below:

At the cut-off date for the interim CSR, the vast majority of patients (69 of 90) had already completed 
the final long-term open label period of the study (Period D). Twenty-four patients had withdrawn from 
the study at that time. At the completion of the study, 90 patients had completed Period D, and the 
number of drop-outs from the study remained at 24. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The objectives of the study were to determine the safety and efficacy of two doses of adalimumab 
versus MTX in pediatric subjects with severe chronic plaque psoriasis, to determine the time to loss of 
disease control, the ability to regain response upon re-treatment, and to examine the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of adalimumab following subcutaneous (SC) administration 
in this subject population. 
Study design 
The study design for study M04-717 is shown below. The study is comprised of 4 periods and the 
objective of each period is shown in the table below.

Discontinuation: 
13 subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg discontinued from the study, whereas 8 subjects 
randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg and 3 subjects randomized to MTX discontinued from the study. 
Lack of efficacy was the most reported primary reason for discontinuation. Two subjects discontinued 
because of an adverse event as primary reason (1 subject randomized to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg had 
an event of moderate Ps flare in Period C and 1 subject initially randomized to MTX, but receiving 
adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, had an event of severe urticaria in Period D).  
CHMP comment 
The study design is somewhat complex but has been agreed upon at scientific advice meetings and is 
considered acceptable.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoints were: 
● The proportion of subjects achieving a ≥ PASI 75 response at Week 16A, adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg 
versus MTX. 
● The proportion of subjects achieving a PGA "cleared" or "minimal" (0 or 1) at Week 16A, adalimumab 
0.8 mg/kg versus MTX. 
The a priori defined order of the statistical hypotheses is: 
● Superiority of adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX, regarding the proportion of subjects achieving a 
PASI 75 response at Week 16A 
● Superiority of adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX, regarding the proportion of subjects achieving a 
PGA "cleared" or "minimal" (0 or 1) at Week 16A. 
The following secondary variables were evaluated per the ranking order: 
1. The proportion of subjects achieving a PASI 90 at Week 16A, adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX 
2. The proportion of subjects achieving a PASI 100 at Week 16A, adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX 
3. Change from baseline in the CDLQI scores at Week16A, adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX 
4. Change from baseline in the PedsQL scores at Week16A, adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX 
5. The proportion of subjects achieving PGA "cleared" or "minimal" (0 or 1) upon completion of re-
treatment (Period C), according to the original randomized group assignment in Period A (adalimumab 
0.8 mg/kg versus adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg). 
6. Time to loss of disease control (Period B), according to the original randomized group assignment in 
Period A (adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg and MTX). 
In addition to the primary and the ranked secondary endpoints, the following efficacy endpoints were 
to be assessed at the different time points throughout the study: 
● Proportion of subjects achieving a PGA of "cleared" or "minimal" (0 or 1). 
● Proportion of subjects achieving a PGA of "cleared" (0). 
● Proportion of subjects achieving ≥ PASI 50/75/90/100. 
● Mean % improvement in PASI score relative to baseline (Week 0A).

● Proportion of subjects with CDLQI = 0. 
● Time to PASI 50/75/90/100 response. 
● Change from baseline in PedsQL. 
● Change from baseline in the CDI:S. 
CHMP comment 
The design of the study has been agreed upon by the PDCO, and the protocol, including the primary 
endpoint, has been approved as compliant with the PIP. 
Statistical Methods 
All efficacy analyses were based on the ITT population. 
The two primary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of subjects achieving a PASI ≥ 75 response 
and the proportion of subjects achieving a PGA "cleared" or "minimal" (0 or 1) response at Week 16A. 
These endpoints were tested in hierarchical order, first PASI then PGA, at a level of significance of 5% 
to preserve the overall type I error. 
Due to the expected small number of subjects per group with prior etanercept treatment, the primary 
confirmatory analysis was to be done without stratification using a chi-square test or Fisher's exact test 
if expected cell count was less than 5 at alpha level of 5%. Analysis using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
test stratified for prior etanercept use was to be done as sensitivity analysis. 
Subjects who did not have PGA or PASI assessments at Week 16A were to be imputed as 
nonresponders in the primary analysis and using LOCF for continous variables. This includes subjects 
that "early escaped" during the initial 16-week Period A. 
CHMP comment 
The statistical methods are considered acceptable. 
Results 
Recruitment 
A total of 114 subjects were recruited at 38 sites in Canada, the EU, and rest of world (Chile, Mexico, 
Switzerland, and Turkey).

CHMP comment 
Only two subjects between the age of 4 and 6 were treated, and these subjects were randomized to 
adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg. Consequently there are no subjects that have received adalimumab 0.8 
mg/kg, the dose proposed for marketing in this age group. The numbers of subjects at the age of 6, 7 
and 8 years of age were approximately 5 in every age group, while the majority of subjects were 9-18 
years of age. 
It was a slight majority for girls in the study, as could be expected considering the gender distribution 
of the disease. The vast majority of participating subjects was white and of normal height according to 
their age. The weight was somewhat on the higher level, as could be expected in subjects with 
psoriasis. 
The average subject had been diagnosed with plaque psoriasis for 5 years before participating in this 
study. The disease was considered severe on the basis of enrolment criteria.

CHMP comment 
The severity of psoriasis was evaluated using the PASI and the PGA scales which are often used scales. 
According to the Applicant, the subjects included in the study had severe psoriasis, which partly can be 
agreed upon. In the PASI scale, moderate to severe psoriasis has a score between 10 and 20, while 
severe psoriasis has a score above 20. The average score in the study was 18.3. The PGA scale used in 
the study used cleared, minimal, mild, moderate, marked and severe to define the disease severity of 
the patients. According to this definition approximately half of the subjects had moderate and half had 
marked psoriasis, while only a few subjects had a severe form, one a minimal and a few mild psoriasis. 
The average subject had 28% of the body surface area affected by psoriasis lesions.  
The effects of the disease on quality of life was measured using three scales; a life quality index, a 
pediatric quality of life inventory and a children’s depression inventory. All together, the results 
demonstrate that the quality of life of the children was negatively affected by their disease. 
All subjects reported prior topical use of medication for psoriasis. One half of the subjects had 
previously received phototherapy. Approximately 10% had previously used etanercept and on-third of 
the subjects had previously used a systemic nonbiologic treatment. The most frequently reported prior 
psoriasis treatments, reported by > 30% of subjects were vitamin D analogue, mid to high potency 
corticosteroids and ultraviolet B narrow band UVB treatment.

CHMP comment 
Considering the disease severity of the subjects included in the study, the previous medications used 
are as could be expected. 
Efficacy results 
Primary efficacy endpoints 
The results are presented for the two primary efficacy endpoints to compare the adalimimab 0.8 mg/kg 
and MTX treatment groups in the proportion of subjects achieving a ≥PASI 75 response and the 
proportion of subjects achieving a PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) response at Week 16A (Period A). 
The results presented for the primary endpoints are based on the ITT set.  The primary method of 
handling missing or incomplete data was the nonresponder imputation (NRI) method.  Sensitivity 
analysis included last observation carried forward (LOCF) and observed cases analyses.  Results from 
LOCF and observed cases analyses were similar to NRI. 
A statistically significantly higher proportion of subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg 
achieved a PASI 75 response at Week 16A than subjects randomized to MTX (57.9% versus 32.4%, P 
= 0.027) (see table below). 
Table. Proportion of Subjects Who Achieved a PASI 75 Response at Week 16A (NRI) (ITT 
Set) 
The other primary endpoint investigated, the response at Week 16A of PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal), did 
not reach statistical significance (see table above).  
CHMP comment 
The results following 16 weeks of treatment (Period A) demonstrated that the efficacy of adalimumab 
0.8 mg/kg, measured as per cent subjects reaching PASI 75, seems to be higher than that of 
adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg. The dose proposed for marketing in subjects with paediatric psoriasis is 0.8 
mg/kg. Moreover, treatment with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg was superior to that of methotrexate. The 
difference in per cent efficacy superior to that efficacy achieved with methotrexate is approximately 26.

The efficacy of adalimumab in adult patients with psoriasis was according to the SmPC section 5.1 
evaluated using the same efficacy scores as in the present application. The efficacy results in adults 
seem overall to be somewhat higher than in children and adolescents. This might have affected the 
Applicant in designing the responder rates in the sample size calculation. As can be seen earlier in this 
AR, the postulated responder rate in PASI 75 was 69% responder rate for adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, 
while the outcome was 57%.  
The second primary endpoint, the response at Week 16A of PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal), did not reach 
statistical significance. A tendency of efficacy was obtained, while statistical significance using this 
endpoint has been obtained in adult psoriasis patients. The Applicant concluded that the lack of 
statistical significance might be due to the limited sample size and power of the study or to an 
imbalance of exposure to prior nonbiologic treatment or etanercept. This might be the case. However it 
can only be concluded that a less convincing efficacy has been demonstrated in paediatric subjects 
with psoriasis compared to the adult population. No subjects at the proposed lower age limit for 
treatment, between 4-6 years, have been exposed to the dose proposed for marketing (LoQ) since 
they were randomised to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg. 
Furthermore, the Applicant has conducted several post-hoc sensitivity analysis in which PASI 75 and 
PGA 0,1 (cleared or minimal) results were stratified against different factors. Overall, these calculations 
are considered of limited value.  
Secondary endpoints 
The ranked secondary endpoints provide support for the 2 primary endpoints; however, because the 
secondary ranked primary endpoint (PGA 0,1 [cleared, minimal]) did not achieve statistical 
significance, none of the secondary ranked endpoints can be interpreted as confirmatory. 
In the following sections, the efficacy response through the entire study is described and assessed. 
Initial response (Period A) 
Period A was a 16-week period of initial treatment in which subjects were randomized to adalimumab 
0.4 mg/kg, adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, or MTX. 
A higher proportion (20% to 39%) of subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg achieved PASI 
50/75/90 and PGA 0,1 responses than subjects randomized to MTX. Statistical significance was 
observed as early as Week 4A for PASI 50/75 and as early as Week 8A for PASI 90.  No statistical 
significance was observed for any of the timepoints in PASI 100 responses. 
At Week 16A, an improvement in the mean CDLQI and PedsQL scores was greater for subjects 
randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg than subjects randomized to MTX (see table below).  The 
change from baseline in PedsQL at Week 16A was statistically significant.

Table. Clinically Meaningful Improvements in Primary and Ranked Secondary Endpoints 
Loss of response (Period B) 
Subjects who achieved both a PASI 75 and a PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) response after 16 weeks of 
initial treatment in Period A had their treatment withdrawn for up to 36 weeks in Period B. 
The time to loss of disease control, defined as a worsening of PGA scores in comparison to Week 16A 
by at least 2 grades after treatment withdrawal, was numerically shorter for subjects randomized to 
adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg than subjects who were randomized to MTX (see table).

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

No subjects experienced a loss of disease control during the withdrawal period of the study that met 
the definition of rebound, defined as a rapid and excessive or atypical recurrence of psoriasis following 
the cessation of therapy, with a PASI score at least 125% above baseline PASI within 90 days of 
treatment discontinuation. 
CHMP comment 
The time to loss of disease control defined as a worsening of PGA scores in comparison to Week 16A by 
at least 2 grades after treatment withdrawal, was numerically shorter for subjects randomized to 
adalimumab 0.8 mg/k, than subjects who were randomized to MTX. This finding is assessed as could 
be anticipated considering the higher responder rates for adalimimab 0.8 mg/kg in PASI scores at 
week 16A. 
Retreatment (Period C) 
In Period C, subjects who lost disease control during Period B were re-treated for 16 weeks with their 
initially randomized adalimumab dose regimen or, if they were initially randomized to MTX, with 
adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg.  PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) responses at Week 16C for subjects 
initially randomized to MTX, therefore, are a result from exposure to both MTX (during initial treatment 
in Period A) and adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg (during re-treatment in Period C). 
For subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, the PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) 
response rates during initial treatment and re-treatment were similar.  For subjects randomized to 
MTX, the response rate to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg in Period C was higher and occurred faster than the 
response rate to MTX in Period A (see figure below).

Subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg or to MTX, who were re-treated with adalimumab 0.8 
mg/kg, also had an improvement in mean CDLQI and mean PedsQL values (data not shown). 
CHMP comment 
The efficacy of adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg (PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) response rates) was 
similar following the 16 week retreatment period C in subjects that previously (period A) had been 
randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg. Subjects that had been initially treated with MTX, and in Period 
C treated with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, demonstrated a higher and faster response rate to adalimumab 
than to MTX in Period A. 
Maintenance (Period D) 
Period D is a 52-week long-term follow-up period during which subjects continued to receive 
adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg or adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg or continued to be observed off-treatment, if their 
disease remained under control after treatment withdrawal in Period B.  PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 (cleared, 
minimal) response rates for subjects initially randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg or MTX were 
retained through at least Week 40D (see figure below)

Maintenance in Period D for Subjects Initially Randomized to Adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg or

For subjects initially randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, who achieved an adequate clinical 
response in Period A, lost disease control in Period B, and re-achieved an adequate clinical response in 
Period C, PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) response rates was maintained for the full 52 weeks 
in Period D.  In addition, PASI 50/75/90/100 response rates were generally as high or higher at Week 
52D than at Week 16A. 
The improvement in CDLQI that was achieved at Week 16A was maintained with adalimumab 0.8 
mg/kg throughout Period D and the proportion of subjects who achieved CDLQI scores of 0 at Week 
16A generally increased with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg treatment throughout Period D.  Subjects 
randomized to MTX and treated with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg in Period D showed an approximate 5-fold 
increase in mean change from baseline in PedsQL at Week 52D, as compared to Week 16A. 
CHMP comment 
The efficacy of adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg was maintained over the 52 week follow up period, which is 
reflected also in the CDLQI.

Safety results 
Introduktion 
The safety of adalimumab in subjects with paediatric psoriasis was determined using data from one 
Phase 3 clinical trial. Study M04-717 is a randomized, 4-period, double-blind, double-dummy, 
multicenter, clinical trial conducted in pediatric subjects from 4 through 17 years of age with severe 
chronic plaque psoriasis. 
AEs representing identified and potential risks of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapy are of 
special interest and were examined separately by category.   
Patient exposure 
A total of 114 subjects from 4 through 17 years of age who were diagnosed with chronic plaque 
psoriasis and whose disease was considered severe on the basis of enrolment criteria were enrolled in 
the study. These subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to either adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg, adalimumab 0.8 
mg/kg or MTX.  
The duration of treatments can be seen in the tables below.

Set) 
CHMP comment 
The mean duration of treatment with either dose of adalimumab during Period A was 112 days. The 
duration of treatment overall to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg was 374 days and to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg 
464 days. The demographic characteristics, baseline disease measures, prior and concomitant 
medications were identical as presented earlier in this Assessment report. 
In the Updated Rapporteur extension of indication variation AR, is was stated in section 
2.5.2 Discussion on clinical safety. The text has been updated with results obtained from the 
last 21 patients in Period D.   
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
The safety of adalimumab in subjects with paediatric psoriasis was determined using data from study 
M04-717, a randomized, 4-period, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter, clinical trial. A total of 
114 subjects from 4 through 17 years of age, diagnosed with chronic plaque psoriasis were enrolled in 
the study. The subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to receive treatment with either adalimumab 0.4 
mg/kg, adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg or MTX.  
The data presented are from the end of the first 16-week treatment period (Period A) and from the 
entire study (Period B to Period D). The duration of treatment overall to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg was 
374 days and to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg 464 days.  
During Period A, the incidence of adverse events was approximately 35% in subjects dosed with either 
dose of adalimumab or MTX. In the study overall (Period B to Period D), the incidence of AEs was also 
similar across all treatment groups. The incidence of AEs considered by the investigator to be at least 
possibly related to adalimumab was 42.9% among subjects in the adalimumab groups, and 40.5% 
among subjects randomized to MTX.

The most frequently reported adverse events in Period A were in the Infections and Infestations SOC.  
Upper respiratory tract infections occurred in 7.8% of subjects randomized to adalimumab (10.3% in 
subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg, and 5.3% in subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.8 
mg/kg) and in 16.2% of subjects randomized to MTX.  Rhinitis was reported in 5.2% of subjects 
randomized to adalimumab (2.6% adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg and 7.9% adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg) and 
2.7% of subjects randomized to MTX. Occasionally, there is more adverse event noted among subjects 
treated with 0.4 mg/kg adalimumab compared to 0.8 mg/kg, which is assessed as a chance finding. 
0.8 mg/kg of adalimumab is the dose proposed for use in paediatric psoriasis patients. 
Adverse events in the gastrointestinal tract were more frequently reported among MTX subjects than 
adalimumab subjects (24.3% versus 18.2%, respectively). The most commonly reported 
gastrointestinal events were nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and abdominal pain upper, which are 
adverse events commonly associated with MTX. 
In the study overall (Period B-Period D), the incidence of adverse events was similar among the 
treatment groups, with infections as the most frequently seen adverse event. Among the adverse 
events reported in more than one subject in any treatment group and by the investigator assessed as 
possibly or probably related to study drug, infections, injections site pain and injections site reactions, 
nausea and headache dominated in the overall safety data set.

One death occurred during the study, a 17-year-old white male randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, 
who died from an accidental fall. The death was by the investigator assessed as not related to study 
drug, an opinion which is endorsed by the assessor. All treatment-emergent SAEs (hand fracture 
tendon injury, fall, haemorrhagic ovarian cyst, GI infection, chest pain, rash, agitation) were assessed 
by the investigator as not related or probably not related to study drug. One new SAE was reported in 
Period D (eye nevus) after the cut-off for the interim report. No malignancies were detected during the 
study. 
Adverse events of special interest followed during the study were infections, tuberculosis, parasitic 
infections, herpes zoster, allergic reactions, haematological disorders, injections site reactions, and 
worsening and new onset of psoriasis.  
Respiratory infections with nasopharyngitis were the most common observed infection during the 
study. Two subjects tested positive for TB conversion and one subject had a parasitic infection 
assessed as not related to study drug. Three subjects had herpes zoster and allergic reactions 
(urticarial and pruritus) were reported for 7 subjects. Two subjects reported three haematological 
adverse events (mild leukopenia and mild neutropenia). Injection site AEs were observed in 12% of 
subjects in the study M04-717. The majority were mild and most resolved without treatment. Eleven

subjects reported worsening of new onset of psoriasis; three events were reported during Period A, 
one event during Period B, four events during Period D, and four events during the post-treatment 
period following Period D.  
Occasional elevations of ALT were noted during the study. Elevated liver enzymes are included as a 
very common adverse event in the SmPC, and are not considered a cause for concern. 
The new safety data collected from the last 21 subjects who completed the study have not changed 
the conclusions of the interim safety data base.  
Conclusion of clinical safety 
No new safety concerns have emerged in the present study performed in paediatric patients with 
psoriasis. The adverse events noted have been seen in adult patients with psoriasis and in clinical trials 
with Humira in other paediatric indications.  
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
See below section 3. Rapporteur´s overall conclusion and recommendation. 
2.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
A fairly convincing efficacy of adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg has been demonstrated in children and 
adolescents with severe plaque psoriasis. 
Considering both the PK and safety profile of adalimimab, the 4 years of age as lower age limit for 
treatment of children with chronic plaque psoriasis was accepted. The new safety data collected from 
the last 21 subjects who completed the study have not changed the conclusions of the interim safety 
data base.  
Overall conclusion 
The variation application to extend the indication of Humira to treat children with severe chronic plaque 
psoriasis from the age of 4 was approved in March 2015. The submission of the final report does not 
change the conclusions drawn from the interim data. 
Recommendation  
The application is recommended for approval. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Deltyba is indicated for use as part of an appropriate combination regimen for pulmonary multi-drug 
resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in adults, adolescents, children and infants with a body weight of at 
least 10 kg when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of 
resistance or tolerability (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with delamanid should be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the 
management of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 
Delamanid must always be administered as part of an appropriate combination regimen for the 
treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Treatment with an 
appropriate combination regimen should continue after completion of the 24-week delamanid 
treatment period according to WHO guidelines. 
It is recommended that delamanid is administered by directly observed therapy (DOT). 
Posology 
Adults 
The recommended dose for adults is 100 mg twice daily for 24 weeks. 
Adolescents and children 
Paediatric patients with a body weight of 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
≥ 30 to < 50 kg: the recommended dose is 50 mg twice daily for 24 weeks 
≥ 50 kg: the recommended dose is 100 mg twice daily for 24 weeks 
- 
- 
For patients with a body weight below 30 kg please see the SmPC for Deltyba 25 mg dispersible 
tablets. 
Treatment duration 
The total duration of treatment with delamanid is 24 weeks. Data on longer treatment duration is very 
limited. When treatment with delamanid is considered necessary beyond 24 weeks to obtain a curative 
treatment, a longer duration of therapy may be considered. 
Elderly patients (> 65 years of age) 
No data are available in the elderly. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. There 
are no data on the use of delamanid in patients with severe renal impairment and its use is not 
recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Delamanid is 
not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Deltyba in children with a body weight below 10 kg have not yet been 
established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation 
on a posology can be made. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
Delamanid should be taken with food.

Serum albumin < 2.8 g/dL (see section 4.4 regarding use in patients with serum albumin 
≥ 2.8 g/dL). 
Coadministration of medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. 
carbamazepine). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
There are no clinical data on the use of delamanid to treat 
- 
- 
- 
extra pulmonary tuberculosis (e.g. central nervous system, bone) 
infections due to Mycobacterial species other than those of the M. tuberculosis complex 
latent infection with M. tuberculosis 
There are no clinical data on the use of delamanid as part of combination regimens used to treat drug-
susceptible M. tuberculosis. 
Resistance to delamanid 
Delamanid must only be used in an appropriate combination regimen for MDR-TB treatment as 
recommended by WHO to prevent development of resistance to delamanid. 
QT prolongation 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
QT prolongation has been observed in patients treated with delamanid. This prolongation increases 
slowly over time in the first 6 to 10 weeks of treatment and remains stable thereafter. QTc 
prolongation is very closely correlated with the major delamanid metabolite DM-6705. Plasma 
albumin and CYP3A4 regulate the formation and metabolism of DM-6705 respectively (see Special 
Considerations below). 
General recommendations 
It is recommended that electrocardiograms (ECG) should be obtained before initiation of treatment 
and monthly during the full course of treatment with delamanid. If a QTcF > 500 ms is observed either 
before the first dose of delamanid or during delamanid treatment, treatment with delamanid should 
either not be started or should be discontinued. If the QTc interval duration exceeds 450/470 ms for 
male/female patients during delamanid treatment, these patients should be administered more frequent 
ECG monitoring. It is also recommended that serum electrolytes, e.g. potassium, are obtained at 
baseline and corrected if abnormal. 
Special considerations 
Cardiac risk factors 
Treatment with delamanid should not be initiated in patients with the following risk factors unless the 
possible benefit of delamanid is considered to outweigh the potential risks. Such patients should 
receive very frequent monitoring of ECG throughout the full delamanid treatment period. 
- 
Known congenital prolongation of the QTc-interval or any clinical condition known to prolong 
the QTc interval or QTc > 500 ms. 
History of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias or with clinically relevant bradycardia. 
Any predisposing cardiac conditions for arrhythmia such as severe hypertension, left ventricular 
hypertrophy (including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) or congestive cardiac failure 
accompanied by reduced left ventricle ejection fraction. 
Electrolyte disturbances, particularly hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia or hypomagnesaemia. 
Taking medicinal products that are known to prolong the QTc interval. These include (but are 
not limited to): 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone, disopyramide, dofetilide, ibutilide, procainamide, 
quinidine, hydroquinidine, sotalol). 
Neuroleptics (e.g. phenothiazines, sertindole, sultopride, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, 
mesoridazine, pimozide, or thioridazine), antidepressive agents. 
Certain antimicrobial agents, including: 
-  macrolides (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin) 
-  moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin (see section 4.4 regarding use with other 
fluoroquinolones) 
bedaquiline 
triazole antifungal agents 
pentamidine 
saquinavir 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Certain non-sedating antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine, astemizole, mizolastine). 
Certain antimalarials with QT-prolonging potential (e.g. halofantrine, quinine, 
chloroquine, artesunate/amodiaquine, dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine). 
Cisapride, droperidol, domperidone, bepridil, diphemanil, probucol, levomethadyl, 
methadone, vinca alkaloids, arsenic trioxide. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypoalbuminaemia 
In a clinical study, the presence of hypoalbuminaemia was associated with an increased risk of 
prolongation of the QTc interval in delamanid treated patients. Delamanid is contraindicated in 
patients with albumin < 2.8 g/dL (see section 4.3). Patients who commence delamanid with serum 
albumin < 3.4 g/dL or experience a fall in serum albumin into this range during treatment should 
receive very frequent monitoring of ECGs throughout the full delamanid treatment period. 
Co-administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
Co-administration of delamanid with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (lopinavir/ritonavir) was 
associated with a 30% higher exposure to the metabolite DM-6705, which has been associated with 
QTc prolongation. Therefore, if co-administration of delamanid with any strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 
is considered necessary it is recommended that there is very frequent monitoring of ECGs, throughout 
the full delamanid treatment period. 
Co-administration of delamanid with quinolones 
All QTcF prolongations above 60 ms were associated with concomitant fluoroquinolone use. 
Therefore, if co-administration is considered to be unavoidable in order to construct an adequate 
treatment regimen for MDR-TB it is recommended that there is very frequent monitoring of ECGs 
throughout the full delamanid treatment period. 
Hepatic impairment 
Deltyba is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 
and 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
There are no data on the use of delamanid in patients with severe renal impairment and its use is not 
recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Paradoxical drug reaction 
Post-marketing cases of paradoxical drug reactions (clinical or radiological worsening of existing 
lesions or development of new lesions in a patient who had previously shown improvement with 
appropriate antimycobacterial treatment) have been reported with Deltyba. Paradoxical drug reactions 
are often transient and should not be misinterpreted as failure to respond to treatment. If a paradoxical 
response is suspected, continuation of planned combination therapy is recommended and symptomatic 
therapy to suppress the exaggerated immune reaction should be initiated if necessary (see section 4.8). 
Excipients 
Deltyba film-coated tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal 
product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effects of other medicinal products on delamanid 
Cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers 
Clinical drug-drug interactions studies in healthy subjects indicated a reduced exposure to delamanid, 
of up to 45% following 15 days of concomitant administration of the strong inducer of cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) 3A4 (rifampicin 300 mg daily) with delamanid (200 mg daily). No clinically relevant 
reduction in delamanid exposure was observed with the weak inducer efavirenz when administered at 
a dose of 600 mg daily for 10 days in combination with delamanid 100 mg twice daily. 
Anti-HIV medicinal products 
In clinical drug-drug interaction studies in healthy subjects, delamanid was administered alone 
(100 mg twice daily) and with tenofovir disoproxil (245 mg daily) or lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg 
daily) for 14 days and with efavirenz for 10 days (600 mg daily). Delamanid exposure remained 
unchanged (< 25% difference) with anti-HIV medicinal products tenofovir disoproxil and efavirenz 
but was slightly increased with the combination anti-HIV medicinal products containing 
lopinavir/ritonavir. 
Effects of delamanid on other medicinal products 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In-vitro studies showed that delamanid did not inhibit CYP450 isozymes. 
In-vitro studies showed that delamanid and metabolites did not have any effect on the transporters 
MDR1(p-gp), BCRP, OATP1, OATP3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and BSEP, at 
concentrations of approximately 5 to 20-fold greater than the Cmax at steady state. However, since the 
concentrations in the gut can potentially be much greater than these multiples of the Cmax, there is a 
potential for delamanid to have an effect on these transporters. 
Anti-tuberculosis medicinal products 
In a clinical drug-drug interaction study in healthy subjects, delamanid was administered alone 
(200 mg daily) and with rifampicin/isoniazid/pyrazinamide (300/720/1800 mg daily) or ethambutol 
(1100 mg daily) for 15 days. Exposure of concomitant anti-TB drugs (rifampicin [R]/ isoniazid [H]/ 
pyrazinamide [Z]) was not affected. Co-administration with delamanid significantly increased steady 
state plasma concentrations of ethambutol by approximately 25%, the clinical relevance is unknown. 
Anti-HIV medicinal products 
In a clinical drug-drug interaction study in healthy subjects, delamanid was administered alone 
(100 mg twice daily) and tenofovir disoproxil (245 mg daily), lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg daily) 
for 14 days and with efavirenz for 10 days (600 mg daily). Delamanid given in combination with the 
anti-HIV-medicines, tenofovir disoproxil, lopinavir/ritonavir and efavirenz, did not affect the exposure 
to these medicinal products. 
Medicinal products with the potential to prolong QTc 
Care must be taken in using delamanid in patients already receiving medicinal products associated 
with QT prolongation (see section 4.4). Co-administration of moxifloxacin and delamanid in MDR-TB 
patients has not been studied. Moxifloxacin is not recommended for use in patients treated with 
delamanid. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of delamanid in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Deltyba is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether delamanid/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available 
pharmacokinetic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of delamanid and/or its 
metabolites in milk (for details see section 5.3). A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. It 
is recommended that women should not breastfeed during treatment with Deltyba. 
Fertility 
Deltyba had no effect on male or female fertility in animals (see section 5.3). There are no clinical data 
on the effects of delamanid on fertility in humans. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Deltyba is expected to have a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients 
should be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience any adverse reaction with a potential 
impact on the ability to perform these activities (e.g. headache is very common and tremor is 
common).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
ECG QT interval prolongation 
In patients receiving 200 mg delamanid total daily dose in the phase 2 and 3 trials, the mean placebo 
corrected increase in QTcF from baseline ranged from 4.7 - 7.6 ms at 1 month and 5.3 ms - 12.1 ms at 
2 months, respectively. The incidence of a QTcF interval > 500 ms ranged from 0.6% (1/161) - 2.1% 
(7/341) in patients receiving delamanid 200 mg total daily dose versus 0% (0/160) - 1.2% (2/170) of 
patients receiving placebo + OBR, while the incidence of QTcF change from baseline > 60 ms ranged 
from 3.1% (5/161) - 10.3% (35/341) in patients receiving delamanid 200 mg total daily dose versus 
0% (0/160) - 7.1% (12/170) in patients receiving placebo. 
Palpitations 
For patients receiving delamanid + OBR in the phase 2 and 3 trials, the frequency was 7.9% 
(frequency category common) in comparison to a frequency of 6.7% in patients receiving placebo + 
OBR. 
Paediatric population 
Based on a study (see section 5.1) in 37 paediatric patients aged 0 to 17 years, the frequency, type and 
severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in adults. 
Cases of hallucination have been reported predominantly in the paediatric population during post-
marketing. The incidence of hallucination in clinical trials was common for children (5.4%) and adults 
(1%). 
Cases of nightmare have been reported predominantly in the paediatric population during post-
marketing.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No cases of delamanid overdose have been observed in clinical trials. However, additional clinical 
data showed that in patients receiving 200 mg twice daily, i.e. total 400 mg delamanid per day, the 
overall safety profile is comparable to that in patients receiving the recommended dose of 100 mg 
twice daily. Albeit, some reactions were observed at a higher frequency and the rate of QT 
prolongation increased in a dose-related manner. Treatment of overdose should involve immediate 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
measures to remove delamanid from the gastrointestinal tract and supportive care as required. 
Frequent ECG monitoring should be performed. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycobacterials, drugs for treatment of tuberculosis, ATC code: 
J04AK06. 
Mechanism of action 
The pharmacological mode of action of delamanid involves inhibition of the synthesis of the 
mycobacterial cell wall components, methoxy-mycolic and keto-mycolic acid. The identified 
metabolites of delamanid do not show anti-mycobacterial activity. 
Activity against specific pathogens 
Delamanid has no in vitro activity against bacterial species other than mycobacteria. 
Resistance 
Mutation in one of the 5 coenzyme F420 genes is suggested as the mechanism for resistance against 
delamanid in mycobacteria. In mycobacteria, the in vitro frequencies of spontaneous resistance to 
delamanid were similar to those for isoniazid and were higher than those for rifampicin. Resistance to 
delamanid has been documented to occur during treatment (see section 4.4). Delamanid does not show 
cross-resistance with any of the currently used anti-tuberculosis medicinal products except 
pretomanid. In vitro studies have shown cross-resistance with pretomanid. This is likely to be due to 
delamanid and pretomanid being activated via the same pathway. 
Susceptibility testing interpretive criteria 
When 7H11 agar medium is used for drug susceptibility testing, the recommended epidemiological 
cut-off (ECOFF) and susceptibility testing interpretive criteria for delamanid are: 
ECOFF: 
Clinical breakpoint: 
S = susceptible; R = resistant 
0.016 mg/L 
S ≤ 0.016 mg/L; R > 0.016 mg/L 
Data from clinical studies 
Delamanid has been evaluated in two, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials for the treatment of 
MDR-TB. The analyses of SCC were conducted on the modified intent to treat population which 
included patients who had positive cultures at baseline and the isolate was resistant to both isoniazid 
and rifampicin, i.e., had MDR-TB. 
In the first trial (Trial 204), 64/141 (45.4%) patients randomised to receive delamanid 100 mg BID + 
OBR and 37/125 (29.6%) of patients randomised to receive placebo (PLC) + OBR achieved two-
month sputum culture conversion (SCC) (i.e. growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to no growth 
over the first 2 months and maintained for 1 more month) (p = 0.0083). The time to SCC for the group 
randomised to 100 mg BID was also found to be faster than for the group randomised to receive 
placebo + OBR (p = 0.0056). 
In the second trial (Trial 213), delamanid was administered orally at 100 mg BID as an add-on therapy 
to an OBR for 2 months followed by 200 mg once daily for 4 months. The median time to SCC was 
51 days in the delamanid + OBR group compared with 57 days in the PLC + OBR group (p = 0.0562 
using the stratified modified Peto-Peto modification of Gehan’s Wilcoxon rank sum test). The 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
proportion of patients achieving SCC (sputum culture conversion) after the 6-month treatment period 
was 87.6% (198/226) in the delamanid + OBR treatment group compared to 86.1% (87/101) in the 
placebo + OBR treatment group (p = 0.7131). 
All missing cultures up to the time of SCC were assumed to be positive cultures in the primary 
analysis. Two sensitivity analyses were conducted - a last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) 
analysis and an analysis using ‘bookending’ methodology (which required that the previous and 
subsequent cultures were both observed negative cultures to impute a negative result, otherwise a 
positive result was imputed). Both showed a 13-day shorter median time to SCC in the delamanid + 
OBR group (p = 0.0281 for LOCF and p = 0.0052 for ‘bookending’). 
Delamanid resistance (defined as MIC ≥ 0.2 µg/mL) has been observed at baseline in 2 of 316 patients 
in Trial 204 and 2 of 511 patients in Trial 213 (4 of 827 patients [0.48%]). Delamanid resistance 
emerged in 4 of 341 patients (1.2%) randomised to receive delamanid for 6 months in Trial 213. These 
four patients were only receiving two other medicinal products in addition to delamanid. 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of delamanid in combination with a background regimen 
(BR) were evaluated in trial 242-12 -232 (10 days pharmacokinetics) followed by trial -233 
(pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety), both single-arm, open-label trials, which included 37 patients 
who had a median age of 4.55 years (range 0.78 to 17.60 years), 25 (67.6%) were Asian and 19 
(51.4%) were female. 
Paediatric patients were enrolled in four groups: 
Group 1: 12 to 17 years (7 patients), group 2: 6 to 11 years (6 patients), group 3: 3 to 5 years 
(12 patients) and group 4: 0 to 2 years (12 patients). The overall mean baseline body weight of 
subjects was 19.5 kg and in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 the mean body weights were 38.4, 25.1, 14.8, and 
10.3 kg, respectively. 
The patients had confirmed or probable MDR-TB infection and were to complete 26 weeks of 
treatment with delamanid + OBR, followed by OBR only in accordance with the WHO 
recommendation. Patients in groups 1 and 2 received film-coated tablets. The delamanid dose in 
group 1 was 100 mg twice daily and 50 mg twice daily in group 2. The doses administered were 
higher than the currently recommended weight-based dosage in the paediatric population. Patients in 
groups 3 and 4 received dispersible tablets. This paediatric formulation is not bio-equivalent with the 
film-coated tablets. Patients in group 3 were administered 25 mg twice daily and patients in group 4 
were administered doses between 10 mg twice daily and 5 mg once daily based on body weight. The 
doses administered in group 4 were below the currently recommended weight-based dosage in the 
paediatric population. 
A population PK analysis was performed on data from the 2 paediatric trials to determine the doses in 
paediatric subjects which would provide delamanid exposures similar to those observed in adult 
subjects with MDR-TB. Data in children with a body weight of less than 10 kg were too limited to 
determine doses for that patient population. 
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This 
means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. 
The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every 
year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Oral bioavailability of delamanid improves when administered with a standard meal, by about 2.7-fold 
compared to fasting conditions. The peak plasma concentrations are reached in approximately 4 hours 
post-dose, regardless of food intake. 
Distribution 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Delamanid highly binds to all plasma proteins with a binding to total proteins of ≥ 99.5%. Delamanid 
has a large apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F of 2 100 L). 
Biotransformation 
Delamanid is primarily metabolised in plasma by albumin and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. The 
complete metabolic profile of delamanid has not yet been elucidated, and there is a potential for drug 
interactions with other co-administered medicinal products, if significant unknown metabolites are 
discovered. The identified metabolites do not show anti-mycobacterial activity but some contribute to 
QTc prolongation, mainly DM-6705. Concentrations of the identified metabolites progressively 
increase to steady state after 6 to 10 weeks. 
Elimination 
Delamanid disappears from plasma with a t1/2 of 30 to 38 hours. Delamanid is not excreted in urine. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Delamanid plasma exposure increases less than proportionally with increasing dose. 
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
During treatment with the recommended delamanid doses to adolescents and children with a body 
weight of at least 10 kg (see section 4.2), similar plasma exposure were obtained as in adults. 
Patients with renal impairment 
Less than 5% of an oral dose of delamanid is recovered from urine. Mild renal impairment 
(50 mL/min < CrCLN < 80 mL/min) does not appear to affect delamanid exposure. Therefore no dose 
adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. It is not known whether 
delamanid and metabolites will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is considered necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Delamanid is 
not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. 
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) 
No patients of ≥ 65 years of age were included in clinical trials. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no specific hazard for humans based on conventional studies for genotoxicity 
and carcinogenic potential. Delamanid and/or its metabolites have the potential to affect cardiac 
repolarisation via blockade of hERG potassium channels. In the dog, foamy macrophages were 
observed in lymphoid tissue of various organs during repeat-dose toxicity studies. The finding was 
shown to be partially reversible; the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in rabbits revealed an inhibitory effect of delamanid and/or its metabolites on vitamin K-
dependent blood clotting. In rabbits reproductive studies, embryo-fetal toxicity was observed at 
maternally toxic dosages. Pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of 
delamanid/metabolites into breast milk. In lactating rats, the Cmax for delamanid in breast milk was 4-
fold higher than that of the blood. In juvenile toxicity studies in rats, all delamanid treatment-related 
findings were consistent with those noted in adult animals.

15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Resistance to delamanid 
Delamanid must only be used in an appropriate combination regimen for MDR-TB treatment as 
recommended by WHO to prevent development of resistance to delamanid. 
QT prolongation 
QT prolongation has been observed in patients treated with delamanid. This prolongation increases 
slowly over time in the first 6 to 10 weeks of treatment and remains stable thereafter. QTc 
prolongation is very closely correlated with the major delamanid metabolite DM-6705. Plasma 
albumin and CYP3A4 regulate the formation and metabolism of DM-6705 respectively (see Special 
Considerations below). 
General recommendations 
It is recommended that electrocardiograms (ECG) should be obtained before initiation of treatment 
and monthly during the full course of treatment with delamanid. If a QTcF > 500 ms is observed either 
before the first dose of delamanid or during delamanid treatment, treatment with delamanid should 
either not be started or should be discontinued. If the QTc interval duration exceeds 450/470 ms for 
male/female patients during delamanid treatment, these patients should be administered more frequent 
ECG monitoring. It is also recommended that serum electrolytes, e.g. potassium, are obtained at 
baseline and corrected if abnormal. 
Special considerations 
Cardiac risk factors 
Treatment with delamanid should not be initiated in patients with the following risk factors unless the 
possible benefit of delamanid is considered to outweigh the potential risks. Such patients should 
receive very frequent monitoring of ECG throughout the full delamanid treatment period. 
- 
Known congenital prolongation of the QTc-interval or any clinical condition known to prolong 
the QTc interval or QTc > 500 ms.  
History of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias or with clinically relevant bradycardia. 
Any predisposing cardiac conditions for arrhythmia such as severe hypertension, left ventricular 
hypertrophy (including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) or congestive cardiac failure 
accompanied by reduced left ventricle ejection fraction. 
Electrolyte disturbances, particularly hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia or hypomagnesaemia. 
Taking medicinal products that are known to prolong the QTc interval. These include (but are 
not limited to): 
-  
- 
- 
- 
- 
Antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone, disopyramide, dofetilide, ibutilide, procainamide, 
quinidine, hydroquinidine, sotalol). 
Neuroleptics (e.g. phenothiazines, sertindole, sultopride, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, 
mesoridazine, pimozide, or thioridazine), antidepressive agents. 
Certain antimicrobial agents, including: 
-  macrolides (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin) 
-  moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin (see section 4.4 regarding use with other 
fluoroquinolones) 
bedaquiline 
triazole antifungal agents 
pentamidine 
saquinavir 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Certain non-sedating antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine, astemizole, mizolastine). 
Certain antimalarials with QT-prolonging potential (e.g. halofantrine, quinine, 
chloroquine, artesunate/amodiaquine, dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine). 
Cisapride, droperidol, domperidone, bepridil, diphemanil, probucol, levomethadyl, 
methadone, vinca alkaloids, arsenic trioxide.

- 
- 
Hypoalbuminaemia 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a clinical study, the presence of hypoalbuminaemia was associated with an increased risk of 
prolongation of the QTc interval in delamanid treated patients. Delamanid is contraindicated in 
patients with albumin < 2.8 g/dL (see section 4.3). Patients who commence delamanid with serum 
albumin < 3.4 g/dL or experience a fall in serum albumin into this range during treatment should 
receive very frequent monitoring of ECGs throughout the full delamanid treatment period. 
Co-administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 
Co-administration of delamanid with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (lopinavir/ritonavir) was 
associated with a 30% higher exposure to the metabolite DM-6705, which has been associated with 
QTc prolongation. Therefore, if co-administration of delamanid with any strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 
is considered necessary it is recommended that there is very frequent monitoring of ECGs, throughout 
the full delamanid treatment period. 
Co-administration of delamanid with quinolones 
All QTcF prolongations above 60 ms were associated with concomitant fluoroquinolone use. 
Therefore, if co-administration is considered to be unavoidable in order to construct an adequate 
treatment regimen for MDR-TB it is recommended that there is very frequent monitoring of ECGs 
throughout the full delamanid treatment period. 
Hepatic impairment 
Deltyba is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 
and 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
There are no data on the use of delamanid in patients with severe renal impairment and its use is not 
recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Paradoxical drug reaction 
Post-marketing cases of paradoxical drug reactions (clinical or radiological worsening of existing 
lesions or development of new lesions in a patient who had previously shown improvement with 
appropriate antimycobacterial treatment) have been reported with Deltyba. Paradoxical drug reactions 
are often transient and should not be misinterpreted as failure to respond to treatment. If a paradoxical 
response is suspected, continuation of planned combination therapy is recommended and symptomatic 
therapy to suppress the exaggerated immune reaction should be initiated if necessary (see section 4.8). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effects of other medicinal products on delamanid 
Cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers 
Clinical drug-drug interactions studies in healthy subjects indicated a reduced exposure to delamanid, 
of up to 45% following 15 days of concomitant administration of the strong inducer of cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) 3A4 (rifampicin 300 mg daily) with delamanid (200 mg daily). No clinically relevant 
reduction in delamanid exposure was observed with the weak inducer efavirenz when administered at 
a dose of 600 mg daily for 10 days in combination with delamanid 100 mg twice daily. 
Anti-HIV medicinal products 
In clinical drug-drug interaction studies in healthy subjects, delamanid was administered alone 
(100 mg twice daily) and with tenofovir disoproxil (245 mg daily) or lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg 
daily) for 14 days and with efavirenz for 10 days (600 mg daily). Delamanid exposure remained 
unchanged (< 25% difference) with anti-HIV medicinal products tenofovir disoproxil and efavirenz 
but was slightly increased with the combination anti-HIV medicinal products containing 
lopinavir/ritonavir. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effects of delamanid on other medicinal products 
In-vitro studies showed that delamanid did not inhibit CYP450 isozymes. 
In-vitro studies showed that delamanid and metabolites did not have any effect on the transporters 
MDR1(p-gp), BCRP, OATP1, OATP3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and BSEP, at 
concentrations of approximately 5 to 20-fold greater than the Cmax at steady state. However, since the 
concentrations in the gut can potentially be much greater than these multiples of the Cmax, there is a 
potential for delamanid to have an effect on these transporters. 
Anti-tuberculosis medicinal products 
In a clinical drug-drug interaction study in healthy subjects, delamanid was administered alone 
(200 mg daily) and with rifampicin/isoniazid/pyrazinamide (300/720/1800 mg daily) or ethambutol 
(1100 mg daily) for 15 days. Exposure of concomitant anti-TB drugs (rifampicin [R]/ isoniazid [H]/ 
pyrazinamide [Z]) was not affected. Co-administration with delamanid significantly increased steady 
state plasma concentrations of ethambutol by approximately 25%, the clinical relevance is unknown. 
Anti-HIV medicinal products 
In a clinical drug-drug interaction study in healthy subjects, delamanid was administered alone 
(100 mg twice daily) and tenofovir disoproxil (245 mg daily), lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg daily) 
for 14 days and with efavirenz for 10 days (600 mg daily). Delamanid given in combination with the 
anti-HIV-medicines, tenofovir disoproxil, lopinavir/ritonavir and efavirenz, did not affect the exposure 
to these medicinal products. 
Medicinal products with the potential to prolong QTc 
Care must be taken in using delamanid in patients already receiving medicinal products associated 
with QT prolongation (see section 4.4). Co-administration of moxifloxacin and delamanid in MDR-TB 
patients has not been studied. Moxifloxacin is not recommended for use in patients treated with 
delamanid. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of delamanid in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Deltyba is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether delamanid/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available 
pharmacokinetic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of delamanid and/or its 
metabolites in milk (for details see section 5.3). A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. It 
is recommended that women should not breastfeed during treatment with Deltyba. 
Fertility 
Deltyba had no effect on male or female fertility in animals (see section 5.3). There are no clinical data 
on the effects of delamanid on fertility in humans. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Deltyba is expected to have a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients 
should be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience any adverse reaction with a potential 
impact on the ability to perform these activities (e.g. headache is very common and tremor is 
common).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
ECG QT interval prolongation 
In patients receiving 200 mg delamanid total daily dose in the phase 2 and 3 trials, the mean placebo 
corrected increase in QTcF from baseline ranged from 4.7 - 7.6 ms at 1 month and 5.3 ms - 12.1 ms at 
2 months, respectively. The incidence of a QTcF interval > 500 ms ranged from 0.6% (1/161) - 2.1% 
(7/341) in patients receiving delamanid 200 mg total daily dose versus 0% (0/160) - 1.2% (2/170) of 
patients receiving placebo + OBR, while the incidence of QTcF change from baseline > 60 ms ranged 
from 3.1% (5/161) - 10.3% (35/341) in patients receiving delamanid 200 mg total daily dose versus 
0% (0/160) - 7.1% (12/170) in patients receiving placebo. 
Palpitations 
For patients receiving delamanid + OBR in the phase 2 and 3 trials, the frequency was 7.9% 
(frequency category common) in comparison to a frequency of 6.7% in patients receiving placebo + 
OBR. 
Paediatric population 
Based on a study (see section 5.1) in 37 paediatric patients aged 0 to 17 years, the frequency, type and 
severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in adults. 
Cases of hallucination have been reported predominantly in the paediatric population during post-
marketing. The incidence of hallucination in clinical trials was common for children (5.4%) and adults 
(1%). 
Cases of nightmare have been reported predominantly in the paediatric population during post-
marketing.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No cases of delamanid overdose have been observed in clinical trials. However, additional clinical 
data showed that in patients receiving 200 mg twice daily, i.e. total 400 mg delamanid per day, the 
overall safety profile is comparable to that in patients receiving the recommended dose of 100 mg 
twice daily. Albeit, some reactions were observed at a higher frequency and the rate of QT 
prolongation increased in a dose-related manner. Treatment of overdose should involve immediate 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
measures to remove delamanid from the gastrointestinal tract and supportive care as required. 
Frequent ECG monitoring should be performed. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycobacterials, drugs for treatment of tuberculosis, ATC code: 
J04AK06. 
Mechanism of action 
The pharmacological mode of action of delamanid involves inhibition of the synthesis of the 
mycobacterial cell wall components, methoxy-mycolic and keto-mycolic acid. The identified 
metabolites of delamanid do not show anti-mycobacterial activity. 
Activity against specific pathogens 
Delamanid has no in vitro activity against bacterial species other than mycobacteria. 
Resistance 
Mutation in one of the 5 coenzyme F420 genes is suggested as the mechanism for resistance against 
delamanid in mycobacteria. In mycobacteria, the in vitro frequencies of spontaneous resistance to 
delamanid were similar to those for isoniazid and were higher than those for rifampicin. Resistance to 
delamanid has been documented to occur during treatment (see section 4.4). Delamanid does not show 
cross-resistance with any of the currently used anti-tuberculosis medicinal products except 
pretomanid. In vitro studies have shown cross-resistance with pretomanid. This is likely to be due to 
delamanid and pretomanid being activated via the same pathway. 
Susceptibility testing interpretive criteria 
When 7H11 agar medium is used for drug susceptibility testing, the recommended epidemiological 
cut-off (ECOFF) and susceptibility testing interpretive criteria for delamanid are: 
ECOFF: 
Clinical breakpoint: 
S = susceptible; R = resistant 
0.016 mg/L 
S ≤ 0.016 mg/L; R > 0.016 mg/L 
Data from clinical studies 
Delamanid has been evaluated in two, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials for the treatment of 
MDR-TB. The analyses of SCC were conducted on the modified intent to treat population which 
included patients who had positive cultures at baseline and the isolate was resistant to both isoniazid 
and rifampicin, i.e., had MDR-TB. 
In the first trial (Trial 204), 64/141 (45.4%) patients randomised to receive delamanid 100 mg BID + 
OBR and 37/125 (29.6%) of patients randomised to receive placebo (PLC) + OBR achieved two-
month sputum culture conversion (SCC) (i.e. growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to no growth 
over the first 2 months and maintained for 1 more month) (p = 0.0083). The time to SCC for the group 
randomised to 100 mg BID was also found to be faster than for the group randomised to receive 
placebo + OBR (p = 0.0056). 
In the second trial (Trial 213), delamanid was administered orally at 100 mg BID as an add-on therapy 
to an OBR for 2 months followed by 200 mg once daily for 4 months. The median time to SCC was 
51 days in the delamanid + OBR group compared with 57 days in the PLC + OBR group (p = 0.0562 
using the stratified modified Peto-Peto modification of Gehan’s Wilcoxon rank sum test). The 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
proportion of patients achieving SCC (sputum culture conversion) after the 6-month treatment period 
was 87.6% (198/226) in the delamanid + OBR treatment group compared to 86.1% (87/101) in the 
placebo + OBR treatment group (p = 0.7131).  
All missing cultures up to the time of SCC were assumed to be positive cultures in the primary 
analysis. Two sensitivity analyses were conducted - a last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) 
analysis and an analysis using ‘bookending’ methodology (which required that the previous and 
subsequent cultures were both observed negative cultures to impute a negative result, otherwise a 
positive result was imputed). Both showed a 13-day shorter median time to SCC in the delamanid + 
OBR group (p = 0.0281 for LOCF and p = 0.0052 for ‘bookending’). 
Delamanid resistance (defined as MIC ≥ 0.2 µg/mL) has been observed at baseline in 2 of 316 patients 
in Trial 204 and 2 of 511 patients in Trial 213 (4 of 827 patients [0.48%]). Delamanid resistance 
emerged in 4 of 341 patients (1.2%) randomised to receive delamanid for 6 months in Trial 213. These 
four patients were only receiving two other medicinal products in addition to delamanid. 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of delamanid in combination with a background regimen 
(BR) were evaluated in trial 242-12 -232 (10 days pharmacokinetics) followed by trial -233 
(pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety), both single-arm, open-label trials, which included 37 patients 
who had a median age of 4.55 years (range 0.78 to 17.60 years), 25 (67.6%) were Asian and 19 
(51.4%) were female. 
Paediatric patients were enrolled in four groups: 
Group 1: 12 to 17 years (7 patients), group 2: 6 to 11 years (6 patients), group 3: 3 to 5 years 
(12 patients) and group 4: 0 to 2 years (12 patients). The overall mean baseline body weight of 
subjects was 19.5 kg and in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 the mean body weights were 38.4, 25.1, 14.8, and 
10.3 kg, respectively.  
The patients had confirmed or probable MDR-TB infection and were to complete 26 weeks of 
treatment with delamanid + OBR, followed by OBR only in accordance with the WHO 
recommendation. Patients in groups 1 and 2 received film-coated tablets. The delamanid dose in 
group 1 was 100 mg twice daily and 50 mg twice daily in group 2. The doses administered were 
higher than the currently recommended weight-based dosage in the paediatric population. Patients in 
groups 3 and 4 received dispersible tablets. This paediatric formulation is not bio-equivalent with the 
film-coated tablets. Patients in group 3 were administered 25 mg twice daily and patients in group 4 
were administered doses between 10 mg twice daily and 5 mg once daily based on body weight. The 
doses administered in group 4 were below the currently recommended weight-based dosage in the 
paediatric population. 
A population PK analysis was performed on data from the 2 paediatric trials to determine the doses in 
paediatric subjects which would provide delamanid exposures similar to those observed in adult 
subjects with MDR-TB. Data in children with a body weight of less than 10 kg were too limited to 
determine doses for that patient population. 
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This 
means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. 
The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every 
year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Oral bioavailability of delamanid improves when administered with a standard meal, by about 2.7-fold 
compared to fasting conditions. The peak plasma concentrations are reached in approximately 5 hours 
post-dose, regardless of food intake. 
Distribution 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Delamanid highly binds to all plasma proteins with a binding to total proteins of ≥ 99.5%. Delamanid 
has a large apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F of 2 100 L). 
Biotransformation 
Delamanid is primarily metabolised in plasma by albumin and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. The 
complete metabolic profile of delamanid has not yet been elucidated, and there is a potential for drug 
interactions with other co-administered medicinal products, if significant unknown metabolites are 
discovered. The identified metabolites do not show anti-mycobacterial activity but some contribute to 
QTc prolongation, mainly DM-6705. Concentrations of the identified metabolites progressively 
increase to steady state after 6 to 10 weeks.  
Elimination 
Delamanid disappears from plasma with a t1/2 of 30 to 38 hours. Delamanid is not excreted in urine. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Delamanid plasma exposure increases less than proportionally with increasing dose. 
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
During treatment with the recommended delamanid doses to adolescents and children with a body 
weight of at least 10 kg (see section 4.2), similar plasma exposure were obtained as in adults. 
Patients with renal impairment 
Less than 5% of an oral dose of delamanid is recovered from urine. Mild renal impairment 
(50 mL/min < CrCLN < 80 mL/min) does not appear to affect delamanid exposure. Therefore no dose 
adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. It is not known whether 
delamanid and metabolites will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is considered necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Delamanid is 
not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. 
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) 
No patients of ≥ 65 years of age were included in clinical trials. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no specific hazard for humans based on conventional studies for genotoxicity 
and carcinogenic potential. Delamanid and/or its metabolites have the potential to affect cardiac 
repolarisation via blockade of hERG potassium channels. In the dog, foamy macrophages were 
observed in lymphoid tissue of various organs during repeat-dose toxicity studies. The finding was 
shown to be partially reversible; the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in rabbits revealed an inhibitory effect of delamanid and/or its metabolites on vitamin K-
dependent blood clotting. In rabbits reproductive studies, embryo-fetal toxicity was observed at 
maternally toxic dosages. Pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of 
delamanid/metabolites into breast milk. In lactating rats, the Cmax for delamanid in breast milk was 4-
fold higher than that of the blood. In juvenile toxicity studies in rats, all delamanid treatment-related 
findings were consistent with those noted in adult animals.

1.  What Deltyba is and what it is used for 
Deltyba contains the active substance delamanid, an antibiotic for the treatment of tuberculosis in the 
lung caused by bacteria that are not killed by the most commonly used antibiotics to treat tuberculosis. 
It must always be taken together with other medicines for treating tuberculosis. 
Deltyba is used in adults, adolescents, children and infants who are weighing at least 10 kg. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Deltyba 
Do not take Deltyba: 
- 
if you are allergic to delamanid or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have very low levels of albumin, in the blood. 
if you are taking medicines that strongly increase the activity of a certain liver enzyme called 
‘CYP450 3A4’ (e.g. carbamazepine [a medicine used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures]). 
- 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Deltyba. 
Before you start taking Deltyba, and during the treatment, your doctor may check your heart’s 
electrical activity using an ECG (electrocardiogram) machine (electrical recording of the heart). Your 
doctor may also perform a blood test to check the concentration of some minerals and proteins which 
are important for the function of your heart. 
Tell your doctor if you have one of the following conditions: 
• 
• 
you have reduced levels of albumin, potassium, magnesium or calcium in the blood. 
you have been told that you have heart problems, for example a slow heart rhythm (bradycardia) 
or have a history of heart attack (myocardial infarction). 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
if you have a condition called congenital long QT syndrome or have a serious heart disease or 
problems with heart rhythm. 
you have liver disease or severe kidney disease. 
Inform your doctor immediately while taking this medicine: 
• 
if you experience reappearance or worsening of symptoms of tuberculosis (see 4. Possible side 
effects). 
Children and adolescents 
Deltyba is not suitable for children with a body weight of less than 10 kg because there are not enough 
data available in those patients to determinate the correct doses. 
Other medicines and Deltyba 
Tell your doctor: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
if you are taking medicines to treat an abnormal heart rhythm (e.g. amiodarone, disopyramide, 
dofetilide, ibutilide, procainamide, quinidine, hydroquinidine, sotalol). 
if you are taking medicines to treat psychoses (e.g. phenothiazines, sertindole, sultopride, 
chlorpromazine, haloperidol, mesoridazine, pimozide, or thioridazine) or depression. 
if you are taking certain antimicrobial medicines (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin, 
moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin, bedaquiline, or pentamidine). 
if you are taking triazole antifungal medicines (e.g. fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole). 
if you are taking certain medicines to treat allergic reactions (e.g. terfenadine, astemizole, 
mizolastine). 
if you are taking certain medicines to treat malaria (e.g. halofantrine, quinine, chloroquine, 
artesunate/amodiaquine, dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine). 
if you are taking any of the following: cisapride (used to treat stomach disorders), droperidol 
(used against vomiting and migraine), domperidone (used against nausea and vomiting), 
diphemanil (used to treat stomach disorders or excessive sweating), probucol (lowers the level 
of cholesterol in the bloodstream), levomethadyl or methadone (used for the treatment of opiate 
addiction), vinca alkaloids (anti-cancer medicines), or arsenic trioxide (used to treat certain 
types of leukaemia). 
if you are taking HIV-medicines containing lopinavir/ritonavir, or saquinavir. 
- 
You may be more at risk for dangerous changes of the heart rhythm. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Deltyba may cause harm to an unborn baby. It is not usually recommended for use during pregnancy. 
It is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to get 
pregnant. Your doctor will weigh up the benefits to you against the risks to your baby of taking 
Deltyba whilst you are pregnant. 
It is not known if delamanid passes into breast milk in humans. Breast-feeding is not recommended 
during treatment with Deltyba. 
Driving and using machines 
Deltyba is expected to have a moderate influence on your ability to drive and use machines. If you 
experience side effects that might affect your ability to concentrate and react, do not drive or use 
machines. 
Deltyba 50 mg film-coated tablets contain lactose monohydrate. 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicinal product. 
3. 
How to take Deltyba 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The recommended dose as advised by your doctor is: 
Adults, adolescents and children with a body weight of 50 kg or more: two 50 mg film-coated tablets 
taken twice a day (morning and evening) for 24 weeks. 
Children with a body weight of 30 kg or more and less than 50 kg: one 50 mg film-coated tablet taken 
twice daily for 24 weeks. 
For children with a body weight of less than 30 kg please see the package leaflet for Deltyba 25 mg 
dispersible tablets. 
Your doctor may decide to prescribe the 50 mg film-coated tablets for longer than 24 weeks. 
The film-coated tablets must be taken during or just after a meal. Swallow the tablets with water. 
If you take more Deltyba than you should 
If you have taken more tablets than your prescribed dose, contact your doctor or your local hospital. 
Remember to take the pack with you so that it is clear what medicine you have taken. 
If you forget to take Deltyba 
If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember it. However, if it is nearly time for the next dose, 
just skip the missed dose. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. 
If you stop taking Deltyba 
DO NOT stop taking the tablets unless your doctor tells you to. Stopping too early could allow the 
bacteria to recover and to become resistant to delamanid. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

section 6). 
if you have very low levels of albumin, in the blood. 
if you are taking medicines that strongly increase the activity of a certain liver enzyme called 
‘CYP450 3A4’ (e.g. carbamazepine [a medicine used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures]). 
- 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Deltyba. 
Before you start taking Deltyba, and during the treatment, your doctor may check your heart’s 
electrical activity using an ECG (electrocardiogram) machine (electrical recording of the heart). Your

are important for the function of your heart. 
Tell your doctor if you have one of the following conditions: 
• 
• 
you have reduced levels of albumin, potassium, magnesium or calcium in the blood. 
you have been told that you have heart problems, for example a slow heart rhythm (bradycardia) 
or have a history of heart attack (myocardial infarction). 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
if you have a condition called congenital long QT syndrome or have a serious heart disease or 
problems with heart rhythm. 
you have liver disease or severe kidney disease. 
Inform your doctor immediately while taking this medicine: 
• 
if you experience reappearance or worsening of symptoms of tuberculosis (see 4. Possible side 
effects). 
Children and adolescents 
Deltyba is not suitable for children with a body weight of less than 10 kg because there are not enough 
data available in those patients to determinate the correct doses. 
Other medicines and Deltyba

- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
-

dofetilide, ibutilide, procainamide, quinidine, hydroquinidine, sotalol). 
if you are taking medicines to treat psychoses (e.g. phenothiazines, sertindole, sultopride,

if you are taking certain antimicrobial medicines (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin, 
moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin, bedaquiline, or pentamidine). 
if you are taking triazole antifungal medicines (e.g. fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole).

(used against vomiting and migraine), domperidone (used against nausea and vomiting), 
diphemanil (used to treat stomach disorders or excessive sweating), probucol (lowers the level 
of cholesterol in the bloodstream), levomethadyl or methadone (used for the treatment of opiate 
addiction), vinca alkaloids (anti-cancer medicines), or arsenic trioxide (used to treat certain 
types of leukaemia). 
if you are taking HIV-medicines containing lopinavir/ritonavir, or saquinavir. 
- 
You may be more at risk for dangerous changes of the heart rhythm. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Deltyba may cause harm to an unborn baby. It is not usually recommended for use during pregnancy. 
It is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to get 
pregnant. Your doctor will weigh up the benefits to you against the risks to your baby of taking 
Deltyba whilst you are pregnant. 
It is not known if delamanid passes into breast milk in humans. Breast-feeding is not recommended 
during treatment with Deltyba. 
Driving and using machines 
Deltyba is expected to have a moderate influence on your ability to drive and use machines. If you 
experience side effects that might affect your ability to concentrate and react, do not drive or use 
machines. 
3. 
How to take Deltyba 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. 
The recommended dose as advised by your doctor is: 
Children with a body weight of 20 kg or more and less than 30 kg: two 25 mg dispersible tablets in the 
morning and one 25 mg dispersible tablet in the evening for 24 weeks. 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Children with a body weight of 10 kg or more and less than 20 kg: one 25 mg dispersible tablet in the 
morning and one 25 mg dispersible tablet in the evening for 24 weeks. 
For children with a body weight of 30 kg or more please see the package leaflet for Deltyba 50 mg 
film-coated tablets. 
The dispersible tablets must be taken during or just after a meal. 
Place the 25 mg dispersible tablet(s) in a glass or a cup. Pour 10 to 15 mL of water (approximately 
1 tablespoon) per 25 mg dispersible tablet in the cup or the glass. Wait until the dispersible tablet(s) 
dissolve(s) completely (approximately 30 seconds) and gently swirl to make a uniform suspension. 
The resulting whitish suspension must be ingested immediately. Thereafter, a further 10 to 15 mL of 
water (approximately 1 tablespoon) per 25 mg dispersible tablet must be added to the glass or cup, 
swirl gently ensuring that potentially remaining suspension is dispersed and the resulting suspension 
must also be ingested immediately. 
If you take more Deltyba than you should 
If you have taken more tablets than your prescribed dose, contact your doctor or your local hospital. 
Remember to take the pack with you so that it is clear what medicine you have taken. 
If you forget to take Deltyba 
If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember it. However, if it is nearly time for the next dose, 
just skip the missed dose. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. 
If you stop taking Deltyba 
DO NOT stop taking the tablets unless your doctor tells you to. Stopping too early could allow the 
bacteria to recover and to become resistant to delamanid. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

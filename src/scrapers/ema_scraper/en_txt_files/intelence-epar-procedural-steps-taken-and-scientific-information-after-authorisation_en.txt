The drug interactions between etravirine (ETR) and

dolutegravir. Furthermore, the PI is being brought in

dolutegravir (DTG) were investigated in an open-label, 
2-period, crossover study in 16 healthy adult subjects. 
Dolutegravir did not appear to affect the PK of etravirine. 
Etravirine decreased plasma DTG concentration, which may 
result in loss of virologic response and possible resistance to 
dolutegravir. Dolutegravir should not be used with etravirine, 
as mentioned in the Tivicay (dolutegravir) SmPC. 
The drug interactions between ETR with lopinavir 
(LPV)/ritonavir (rtv) and DTG, and between ETR with 
darunavir (DRV)/rtv and DTG were investigated in a 
randomized, open-label, crossover study in 17 healthy adult 
subjects. 
Coadministration of ETR and LPV/rtv had no effect on the 
DTG AUCmin and Cmax and resulted in approximately 28% 
increase in Cmin at steady state. 
Coadministration of ETR and DRV/rtv resulted in decreased 
DTG exposures, with a more prominent effect on Cmin (37% 
reduction) than on AUC24h (25% reduction) and Cmax (12% 
reduction). 
Therefore, ETR can be coadministered with DTG and LPV/rtv, 
and with DTG and DRV/rtv without dose adjustment. The 
combination of ETR with DTG and another boosted PI, 
atazanavir/rtv, is anticipated to give a similar effect, and is 
therefore also allowed without dose adjustment.

exceedingly low. A position statement on the use of 
antiretroviral therapy to reduce HIV transmission was 
published by the British HIV Association (BHIVA) in January 
2013. As a consequence, the recommendations for 
post-exposure prophylaxis have also been changed in 
recently updated HIV treatment guidelines. For example, the 
2013 BHIVA guideline does not generally recommend 
post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after exposure from a 
patient with well treated HIV. Based on these data, the 
wording on the risk of transmission for HIV products was 
revised to reflect the current scientific knowledge. While 
effective suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been 
proven to substantially reduce the risk of sexual 
transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions 
to prevent transmission should be taken in accordance with 
national guidelines.

Regarding the interaction of etravirine with fluconazole as 
expected due to the main excretion of fluconazole on 
unchanged form by urinary way, no effect has been observed 
on fluconazole pharmacokinetics in case of co-administration

Package Leaflet 
with etravirine. On the contrary, fluconazole increased 
etravirine PK parameters by about a 2-fold factor. Since no 
safety signal emerged from this interaction study or from 
other clinical safety data such an increase in etravirine 
exposure is not expected to alter the safety profile of 
etravirine in HIV-infected patients receiving fluconazole in 
combination with etravirine. Therefore, etravirine and 
fluconazole can be used without dose adjustments. 
Regarding the interaction of etravirine with voriconazole 
voriconazole increased the etravirine PK parameters, but to a 
lesser extent than did fluconazole (less than 50% with 
voriconazole compared to about 100% with fluconazole). 
When analysing the effect of etravirine co-administration on 
voriconazole PK parameters the situation is more 
complicated because of the dependence of voriconazole 
metabolism on CYP2C19 genotype. As expected, patients 
presenting a CYP2C19*2 allele (i.e. intermediate or poor 
metabolisers) presented higher voriconazole PK parameters 
than patients not presenting this allele. However, and as a 
reassuring finding, in these patients (who can be considered 
as the worst-case scenario), etravirine decreased the 
voriconazole PK parameters. On the contrary, in extensive 
metabolisers, etravirine increases the voriconazole PK 
parameters (AUC +50%). Overall, in the whole population, in 
the presence of etravirine, Cmin and AUC12h of voriconazole 
were increased by 23% and 14%, respectively, while Cmax 
of voriconazole was decreased by 5%, when combined with 
etravirine. Therefore etravirine and voriconazole can be used 
without dose adjustments.

interaction study was performed between etravirine and 
lopinavir/ritonavir capsules. The study showed an increase in 
etravirine pharmacokinetic parameters and a decrease in the 
lopinavir PK parameters. The interaction was judged as 
not-clinically relevant, as described in the SPC up to now. 
Additionally, the MAH had planned, as a post-authorisation 
commitment, to perform a new interaction data with the 
current formulations (tablet formulation of lopinavir/ritonavir 
and the commercial formulation of etravirine). Results of the 
study confirmed no clinically relevant effects of etravirine on 
either lopinavir or ritonavir pharmacokinetics.  
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and

explained by differences in trial design and formulation. 
Since this final study included the current formulations of 
etravirine and lopinavir/ritonavir these results are consider 
more relevant. Overall the pharmacokinetic interactions 
observed between etravirine and lopinavir/ritonavir were not 
considered clinically relevant and the CHMP recommends no 
dose adjustment when etravirine is co-administered with 
lopinavir/ritonavir. 
This study confirmed that co-administration of etravirine 
with lopinavir/ritonavir was safe and well tolerated.

The interaction between etravirine and rifabutin was

evaluated in a trial during the marketing authorisation and is 
described in the SPC. 
Since etravirine should be administered in combination with 
a boosted protease inhibitor a thorough assessment of each 
potential interaction between etravirine with both a 
ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor and rifabutin was 
performed. The CHMP concluded that the SPC should be 
updated to inform that a decrease in etravirine exposure is 
expected and a close monitoring for virologic response 
should be recommended. An absence or a moderate increase 
in rifabutin exposure is expected whereas a high increase in 
the 25-O-desacetylrifabutin (a metabolite of rifabutin) 
exposure is predicted. Therefore, a close monitoring for 
rifabutin-associated adverse reactions should be 
recommended and reference should be made to the 
corresponding protease inhibitor for dose adjustment.

No new safety finding has been observed in the phase IIb/III

safety profile of etravirine was similar to that seen in the 
pooled DUET analysis, except for the absence of the gender 
difference for rash at 48 weeks of treatment. However, the 
warning is still maintained in section 4.4 of the SPC since at 
this stage further data is awaited to further substantiate this 
observation. The relevant sections of the SPC and PL are

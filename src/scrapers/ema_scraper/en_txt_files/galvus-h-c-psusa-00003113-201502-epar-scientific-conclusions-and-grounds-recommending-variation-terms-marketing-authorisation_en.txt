During the reporting period concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and vildagliptin resulted in a slightly higher 
incidence of angioedema in the vildagliptin group versus the comparator group. The incidence of 
angioedema in patients not taking concomitant ACE inhibitors was the same in both groups. Information 
regarding the increased risk of angioedema in patients taking ACE inhibitors and vildagliptin is known and 
already partly reflected in the product information (section 4.8). In line with the Guideline on Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) this should also be reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC.     
Therefore, in view of available data regarding vildagliptin and vildagliptin/metformin, the PRAC considered 
that changes to the product information were warranted.

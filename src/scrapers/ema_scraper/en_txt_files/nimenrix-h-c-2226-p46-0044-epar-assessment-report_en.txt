1.  Introduction 
On 7 and 8 September 2015, the MAH submitted 3 paediatric clinical study reports in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. Each of these represented a follow-up report 
resulting from assessment of antibody persistence and/or responses to a booster dose several years 
after the primary vaccination.  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided for each of the three submissions. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
In November 2013, a letter was sent to the EMA to inform about a delay in providing the clinical study 
reports for the MenACWY-TT-088 EXT081 M56 and EXT081 M68 data and to explain the reason for the 
delay. These data from EXT081 M56 and M68/69 (pre/post-boost) are submitted in parallel as follows: 
MenACWY-TT-088 EXT081 M56 is a follow-up study at 56 months of the primary study MenACWY-
TT-081. MenACWY-TT-081 was submitted as part of the initial MAA for Nimenrix.  
MenACWY-TT-088 EXT081 M68 is a follow-up study at 68 months of the primary study MenACWY-
TT-081. It includes a booster dose at M68 and data on post-boost immune responses at M69. 
The third clinical study report submitted concerns a separate study: 
MenACWY-TT-043 EXT036 Y5 represents the follow-up to Year 5 of children who were initially 
enrolled into MenACWY-TT-036. The primary phase study MenACWY-TT-036, as well as the follow-up 
study after 2 years (MenACWYTT 043 EXT 036 Y2) were submitted as part of the initial MAA for 
Nimenrix. The Year 3 and Year 4 follow-up data (MenACWY-TT-043 EXT036 Y3 & MenACWY-TT-043 
EXT036 Y4) were submitted and assessed under Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006 in April 
2013 (art 46 reference P46/0034 & P46/0035). 
A variation application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e. containing several studies to 
update the SmPC with available persistence and booster data) is expected to be submitted by 
December 2015. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies 
Nimenrix was developed specifically for use in children and adults. The same formulation and dose is 
used across the full age range approved. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted three reports as described above.

2.3.2.  Clinical studies 
Study 081 
Children 2-10 years vs. Menjugate 
The study was conducted in 2008-9 in France and Germany. In the original study 400 subjects were to 
be randomised in a 3:1 ratio to ACWY-TT or Menjugate. There was stratified enrolment to provide 
~200 subjects aged 2-5 and ~200 aged 6-10 years, which was to provide power to meet the 
immunogenicity criterion of at least 85.6%. All 414 subjects enrolled and vaccinated completed the 
initial phase. The mean age was 5.6 years (3.5 and 7.8 years in the two age strata) with a balanced 
gender distribution. Almost all subjects were of European Caucasian descent.  
Only rSBA functional antibody responses (assayed at GSK’s laboratories) were reported from the initial 
study but hSBA data were planned to be generated in follow-up. Based on rSBA, non-inferiority of 
ACWY-TT vs. Menjugate was demonstrated for responses to MenC based on a lower bound of the 95% 
CI that was -5.25%, with virtually no difference in response rates between vaccines for each subset 
according to baseline MenC serostatus. Response rates to ACWY-TT for each meningococcal group 
were higher in the subsets seronegative at baseline (99-100%) compared to those seropositive at 
baseline (89-98%). In the Menjugate group some subjects fulfilled the criteria for a vaccine response 
to MenA, W or Y. This was especially noticeable for rSBA against MenW and MenY among those 
seronegative to these meningococcal groups at baseline.

The supplementary tables of the response rates by age strata showed that in each case the responses 
to the MenC conjugates were comparable. In both age strata there were similar responses to MenW 
and MenY in Menjugate subjects who were seronegative for these groups at baseline. However, 
responses to MenA, W and Y were all much higher in the ACWY-TT group regardless of baseline 
serostatus. 
As shown below: 
  Baseline percentages with rSBA titres  1:8 ranged from 43.4% (MenA in the Menjugate group) to 
 
86.3% (MenY in the ACWY-TT group).  
The  percentages  with  rSBA  titres    1:128  increased  to  at  least  99.3%  after  administration  of 
ACWY-TT and all the Menjugate subjects had a MenC titre  1:128.

The  rSBA  GMTs  increased  by  54-fold  to  198-fold  in  the  ACWY-TT  group  and  the  MenC  GMT 
increased  273-fold  in  the  Menjugate  group  vs.  123-fold  in  the  ACWY-TT  group.  The  rSBA-MenC 
GMT adjusted for pre-vaccination measurements and age strata was statistically significantly lower 
in the ACWY-TT group.

The post-vaccination percentages with rSBA titres  1:8 and  1:128 were comparable for the two age 
strata whereas the GMTs tended to be lower in the younger subjects compared to the older subjects. 
In each age stratum of subjects who received the ACWY-TT vaccine the rSBA GMT for MenC was lower 
than for the other three meningococcal groups.

Percentages of subjects with anti-PS concentrations  0.3 g/mL before vaccination were low for each 
meningococcal group (from 3.4% to 23.1%). One month after vaccination anti-PS  2 g/ml was 
observed in at least 86.8% in the ACWY-TT group and all subjects in the Menjugate group had  2 
g/ml against MenC. GMCs increased from 41-fold to 162-fold after ACWY-TT and by 90-fold to MenC 
in Menjugate recipients compared to 83-fold in ACWY-TT recipients. No statistically significant 
difference was observed for GMCs adjusted for pre-vaccination measurements and age strata between 
the ACWY-TT group and the Menjugate group.

Anti-tetanus antibody was not reported from this study. 
For the comparison with Menjugate the most frequently reported solicited local AE in both vaccine 
groups was redness for subjects 2-5 years of age and pain for subjects 6-10 years of age. There were 
no significant differences between groups for the AEs reported in the 2-5 and 6-10 years age groups. 
There were no SAEs reported in the primary vaccination phase of the study. 
Ext 081 Month 56  
The analysis of antibody persistence was based on the ATP cohort for antibody persistence at Month 
56. Since >5% of those with Month 56 serological results were excluded from the ATP cohort a second 
analysis based on the Total Vaccinated Cohort Month 56 was performed. For each treatment group, at 
the Month 56 blood sampling time-point, and for each antigen assessed: 
  GMTs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were tabulated. 
 
Percentages  of  subjects  with  titres  above  the  proposed  cut-offs  with  exact  95%  CIs  were 
calculated. 
The distribution of antibody titres was tabulated and presented using reverse cumulative curves. 
 
All reported SAEs considered related to study procedures, or a concomitant GSK drug or vaccine, or 
fatal SAEs were to be described in detail from the end of the six-month Extended Safety Follow-up 
period following vaccination until the Month 56 persistence time-point. 
Of the 414 subjects enrolled in MENACWY-TT-081 there were 260 enrolled at the Month 56 persistence 
time-point, including 193 from the ACWY-TT group and 67 from the MenCCRM group. 
The rSBA serological testing at pre-vaccination and one month post-vaccination in MENACWY-TT-081 
were performed at GSK laboratories but rSBA testing at Months 32, 44 and 56 were performed at the 
Public Health England (PHE) laboratories in the United Kingdom. Therefore rSBA antibody kinetics and 
decay from one month post-vaccination cannot be directly assessed and the table below shows the 
serial data from M32 onwards. 
At Month 56 based on PHE rSBA data (see table below): 
o  Percentages  with  rSBA-MenA  titres  ≥1:8  were  86.6%  in  the  ACWY-TT  group  and  29.2%  in  the 
MenCCRM group with rates at ≥1:128 of 57.5% vs. 15.4%. 
o  Percentages  with  rSBA-MenC  titres  ≥1:8  were  59.1%  in  the  ACWY-TT  group  and  64.6%  in  the 
MenCCRM group with rates at ≥1:128 of 34.9% vs. 49.2%. 
o  Percentages  with  rSBA-MenW-135  titres  ≥1:8  were  78.0%  in  the  ACWY-TT  group  and  26.2%  in 
the MenCCRM group with rates at ≥1:128 of 66.1% vs. 15.4%.

MenCCRM group with rates at ≥1:128 of 74.7% vs. 15.6%.

At Month 56 based on hSBA data (GSK’s assay; see table above): 
o  Percentages with hSBA-MenA titres ≥1:8 were very similar for the ACWY-TT and MenCCRM groups 
(59.6%  and  57.6%)  but  in  both  groups  these  rates  were  much  higher  than  at  M32  and  M44 
(<30% and < 20% for respective vaccine groups). Considering that the study sites were in France 
and Germany this finding is rather strange. However, in both groups the GMTs were low and not 
markedly  higher  than  at  the  two  previous  time  points,  suggesting  that  in  reality  the  difference 
over time reflects only a shift in percentages with titres just below and just above the assay LLOQ. 
No details are provided on the hSBA assay. 
o  Percentages  with  hSBA-MenC  titres  ≥1:8  were  74.4%  in  the  ACWY-TT  group  and  67.7%  in  the 
MenCCRM group with GMTs of 20.6 and 31.2.  
o  Percentages with  hSBA-MenW-135 titres  ≥1:8 were 83.1%  in the  ACWY-TT group and 43.3% in 
the MenCCRM group with GMTs of 59.3 and 9.2. 
o  Percentages  with  hSBA-MenY  titres  ≥1:8  were  88.8%  in  the  ACWY-TT  group  and  71.0%  in  the 
MenCCRM group with GMTs of 117.9 and 35.7.  
No SAEs considered to be possibly related to vaccination by the investigator or considered related to 
study participation were reported from the end of the 6-month Extended Safety Follow-up period 
following vaccination in study MENACWY-TT-081 until the Month 56 persistence time-point.  
Ext 081 Month 68 
All 241 subjects who returned for the M68 follow-up visit were offered a single dose of Nimenrix. The 
study report provides antibody persistence data at M68 and one month post-booster data at M69 for 
220 subjects in the ATP cohort. In the ATP cohort for persistence at Month 68, the mean age at 
booster dose was 11.4 years with an equal gender split. 
At Month 68 based on PHE rSBA data:

Study 036/043 
Adolescents vs. ACWY 
The initial part of the study was conducted in 2007-8 in Asia. The target sample size was 1024 subjects 
who were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to the quadrivalent conjugate (N=768) and unconjugated (N=256) 
vaccines. Enrolment was stratified to ensure ~340 subjects in each of the three age strata of 11-13, 
14-15 and 16-17 years. Of the 1025 subjects enrolled and vaccinated 1016 completed the study while 
1012 were included in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity. The mean age was 14.3 years, 53% were 
female and the study population was of South, East and Southeast Asian heritage. 
The applicant concluded that non-inferiority of ACWY-TT vs. Mencevax was demonstrated for each 
meningococcal group based on 95% CI around the differences in response rates within -1.8%.

Response rates to each meningococcal group were at or near 100% for both vaccines in subsets 
seronegative at baseline but were higher (only very slightly for MenC) with the conjugate in the 
subsets seropositive at baseline. The analyses were not performed separately for the three age strata. 
Pre-vaccination percentages of subjects with rSBA titres  1:8 varied from 58.6%-59.4% for 
rSBA-MenC to 85.4%-90.9% for rSBA-MenY. One month after vaccination almost all subjects had titres 
 1:128 for the four serogroups. The rSBA GMTs for all serogroups increased in both vaccine groups by 
16.4- to 274.3-fold following vaccination, with ranges of 44.5 to 368.2 pre-dose to 2679.3 to 13865.2 
at one month post-dose. An exploratory analysis of the differences between the vaccine groups 
indicated that the rSBA GMTs adjusted for pre-vaccination measurements and age strata for all 
serogroups were significantly higher in the ACWY-TT group vs. the MenPS group.

A subset of samples selected (using Gibb’s method) from those of sufficient volume was also tested by 
rSBA at HPA and reported in the Y2 follow-up study report 043.  
  At  M24  the  HPA  data  showed  that  rSBA  titres    1:8  were  observed  in  74.3%  (MenW)  to  95.0% 
(MenC)  from  the  ACWY-TT  group  compared  to  26.1%  (MenW)  to  85.7%  (MenA)  from  the 
Mencevax group. Percentages with rSBA-MenA titre  1:128, rSBA-MenC titre  1:8, rSBA-MenW-
135  titre    1:8  and    1:128  and  rSBA-MenY  titre    1:8  and    1:128  were  all  statistically 
significantly  higher  for  the  ACWY-TT  group.  In  addition,  the  rSBA  GMTs  were  statistically 
significantly higher in the ACWY-TT for MenA, W and Y.  
  At M24 the GSK rSBA data showed that all subjects had titres  1:8 for the four serogroups in the 
ACWY-TT  group  compared  to  94-100%  in  the  control  group.  The  percentages  with  rSBA-MenA 
titre    1:128,  rSBA-MenW-135  titre    1:8  and    1:128  and  rSBA-MenY  titre    1:8  and    1:128 
were  all  statistically  significantly  higher  for  the  ACWY-TT  group.  In  addition,  the  GMTs  were 
statistically significantly higher in the ACWY-TT for MenA, W and Y. 
The table below shows the HPA data from M0, M1 and M24. In particular, note that much lower 
percentages were reported as being seropositive at baseline using the HPA rSBA assay.

The first three figures below show the percentages of subjects with HPA and GSK rSBA titres  8 and 
GSK rSBA titres  128 at M0, M1 and M24 and the percentages with a vaccine response at M1 using 
each assay. The GSK rSBA assay resulted in generally higher titres than the HPA assay especially 
noticeable at M0. The HPA rSBA assay better discriminated between ACWY-TT and Mencevax, 
especially at the 2-year persistence time point, and gave results in favour of the conjugate vaccine. 
The last two figures compare the response rates at M1 using each assay. Whichever assay is applied 
the results suggest that vaccine response rates were at least as good with the conjugate vaccine vs. 
the control vaccine.

In both vaccine groups, anti-PS GMCs for all serogroups reached values within the range 14.81 to 
86.63 g/mL compared to pre-vaccination values from 0.19 to 1.06 g/mL. Pre-vaccination 
percentages with anti-PS concentrations  0.3 g/mL varied from 9.8%-12.4% for anti-PSW-135 to 
70.1%-74.0% for anti-PSA. One month post-vaccination the percentages with  0.3 g/mL increased 
to 98.7%-100.0% across the two vaccine groups while  2.0 g/mL was achieved in 97.6%-100.0% for 
groups A, C and Y and 93.7%-94.8% for group W-135. Exploratory evaluation of the between-group 
differences indicated statistically significantly higher anti-PSA GMCs and lower anti-PSC GMCs 
(adjusted for pre-vaccination measurements and age strata) in the ACWY-TT group compared to the 
MenPS group. 
The percentages with pre-vaccination anti-TT antibody concentration ≥ 0.1 IU/mL were 67.4% and 
72.2% in the ACWY-TT and the MenPS groups, respectively. One month post-vaccination the anti-TT 
GMC had increased by 26.2-fold and the percentage with ≥ 0.1 IU/mL had increased to 97.8% in the 
ACWY-TT group. Both values remained essentially unchanged in the MenPS group. Exploratory 
evaluation of the between-group differences indicated a statistically significantly higher proportion with 
anti-TT  0.1 IU/mL and GMC adjusted for pre-vaccination measurements and age strata in the ACWY-
TT group compared to the MenPS group. 
Month 60 
The Month 60 (Y5) persistence study was conducted by three principal investigators at three centres in 
two countries (two in India and one in the Philippines). 
The rSBA testing at Months 36, 48 and 60 was done at the PHE (formerly HPA; see primary results 
above) laboratory in the United Kingdom. The results using the PHE assay have been shown for each 
time point in the table below. However, it should be noted that only a small subset had sera tested 
using this assay before M36. No hSBA data are reported from the later follow-up time points.  
Of the 790 subjects enrolled in India and the Philippines in the initial study (036) 478 participated in 
the Month 60 persistence visit but 155/478 (119 ACWY-TT and 36 MenPS) were not compliant with the 
blood sampling schedule and one other had essential serological data missing. The ATP cohort for 
persistence at Month 60 comprised 322 subjects. 
At M60 the percentages of subjects with rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY 
titres ≥ 1:8 were 97.5%, 88.6%, 86.0% and 96.6% in the ACWY-TT group and 93.0%, 87.1%, 34.9%

There were some baseline differences between India and Philippine adolescents with higher baseline 
seropositivity rates in India for MenA and to a lesser extent for MenC. At M60 the GMTs for Men A, 
W135 and Y (but not Men C) were significantly higher in both Indian subjects and Philippine subjects 
who had received the conjugate vaccine vs. the unconjugated vaccine subsets.  
The MenA GMTs were significantly higher for Indian vs. Philippine subjects in both vaccine groups. The 
MenC GMT was significantly higher in Philippine subjects vs. Indian subjects who had each received the 
conjugate vaccine but there was no difference among those who received unconjugated 
polysaccharide. For MenC the GMT was numerically higher for plain polysaccharide among Indian 
subjects but there was no difference between vaccine groups among Philippine subjects. The MenY 
GMT was significantly higher in Indian vs. Philippine subjects who had each received the conjugate 
vaccine but there was no difference among those who received unconjugated polysaccharide.   
No SAEs that were related to study procedures or concurrent GSK medication were reported from the 
last visit of the primary vaccination study (MENACWY-TT-036) up to 60 months after primary 
vaccination.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Study 081/088 M56, M68 and response to a booster dose in children aged 2-10 years 
In the original study rSBA was assayed at GSK’s laboratories and non-inferiority of ACWY-TT vs. 
Menjugate was demonstrated for responses to MenC with numerically comparable findings within 
subsets according to baseline MenC serostatus. The supplementary tables of the response rates by age 
strata showed that responses to the MenC conjugates were comparable and responses to MenA, W and 
Y were all much higher in the ACWY-TT group regardless of baseline serostatus. GMTs tended to be 
lower in the younger subjects compared to the older subjects. In each age stratum the rSBA GMT for 
MenC was lower with ACWY-TT than with Menjugate (ratios 0.43 and 0.57). 
At Month 56 based on PHE rSBA data there were clear differences between ACWY-TT and Menjugate 
groups for seropositivity to MenA, W135 and Y reflecting the immune responses to the additional 
conjugates in Nimenrix. For MenC the percentages with rSBA-MenC titres  1:8 (59.1% vs. 64.6%) 
and with  1:128 (34.9% vs. 49.2%) as well as the GMT were numerically lower in the ACWY-TT 
group.   
At Month 56 based on GSK’s hSBA assay the MenC antibody levels supported a conclusion of broad 
comparability as deduced from the rSBA data. The MenW135 and MenY data did suggest a benefit for 
prior vaccination with Nimenrix but the difference was not so marked, especially for MenY. The MenA

data are a surprise not only because the seropositivity rates and GMTs were comparable but also 
because these rates seemingly increased between M32 and M44 (<30% and < 20% for respective 
vaccine groups) compared to M56 (near to 60%). However, the GMTs remained low, suggesting that 
many subjects must have had titres near to 1:4 and 1:8, which is borne out by the RCD shown below. 
On this basis it remains possible that a small change in assay conditions, including use of a different 
pool of human complement, may have influenced the results. No assay details are provided to 
substantiate this hypothesis but these should be provided when the planned variation is filed. 
At Month 68 based on PHE rSBA data the pattern was similar to that at M56 except that there seemed 
to be an advantage for MenC rSBA in the Menjugate group with non-overlapping 95% CI for 
percentages at ≥1:8 and ≥1:128 as well as the GMTs. Nevertheless, with a much smaller Menjugate 
group a few outliers could have influenced the overall results, which need to be viewed with some 
caution. 
The PHE rSBA data clearly showed that a dose of Nimenrix was able to boost the MenC responses in 
subjects primed with the same vaccine and in those primed with the CRM197 conjugate. The data also 
showed that the GMTs to MenA, W135 and Y were all higher in primed vs. previously unvaccinated 
subjects, supporting the conclusion that the first dose of Nimenrix successfully primed subjects against 
the other serogroups. 
At Month 68 the hSBA (GSK’s assay) data indicated that the titres against MenA had fallen in both 
vaccine groups since the unexpected findings at M56. This again suggests a problem with the assay 
rather than a real phenomenon. Apart from the MenC titres in both groups and the MenW135 titres in 
the ACWY-TT group the other titres also showed a decline from the previous time point.  
At one month post booster vaccination the hSBA results supported the ability of Nimenrix to prime 
subjects against all four serogroups and to boost MenC responses regardless of the type of conjugate 
used for priming. A single dose of Nimenrix also elicited good primary responses to MenA, W135 and Y 
in the Menjugate group although the immune response was much weaker against MenA than against 
MenW135 and MenY.

The follow-up and post-booster safety analyses from this study do not raise any new concerns. 
Study 036/043 
Adolescents vs. ACWY up to M60 
In Asian adolescents who received either Nimenrix or unconjugated MenACWY, the initial study 
suggested a small degree of benefit for the conjugate. In addition to this, all other evidence pointed to 
a benefit for the conjugate in terms of priming, which does not occur with unconjugated 
polysaccharides. Based on the GSK rSBA assay the GMTs were all much higher with the conjugated 
vaccine. The HPA/PHE rSBA assay results supported the conclusions from the GSK assay up to M24 
even though much lower percentages were reported as being seropositive at baseline using the HPA 
rSBA assay and the GMTs were lower. Based on a randomly selected subset, the HPA rSBA assay 
better discriminated between ACWY-TT and Mencevax, especially at the 2-year persistence time point, 
and gave results in favour of the conjugate vaccine. 
The Month 60 (Y5) persistence study must be viewed in light of the fact that it was conducted at only 
three of the original study centres and only in two countries. Also, only rSBA results using the PHE 
assay are available from M36 onwards. These data suggest high persistent seropositivity rates at M60 
and higher rates with the conjugate for rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY. In addition GMTs were higher 
for ACWY-TT except that the MenC GMTs were comparable between the two vaccine groups. 
There were some baseline differences between India and Philippine adolescents with higher baseline 
seropositivity rates in India for MenA and to a lesser extent for MenC. At M60 the GMTs for Men A, 
W135 and Y (but not Men C) were significantly higher in Indian subjects and in Philippine subjects who 
had received the conjugate vaccine vs. unconjugated vaccine.  
The MenA GMTs were significantly higher for Indian vs. Philippine subjects in both vaccine groups. The 
MenC GMT was significantly higher in Philippine subjects vs. Indian subjects who had each received the 
conjugate vaccine but there was no difference among those who received unconjugated 
polysaccharide. For MenC the GMT was numerically higher for plain polysaccharide among Indian 
subjects but there was no difference between vaccine groups among Philippine subjects. The MenY 
GMT was significantly higher in Indian vs. Philippine subjects who had each received the conjugate 
vaccine but there was no difference among those who received unconjugated polysaccharide.   
In conclusion 
The available follow-up data from both studies raise no new concerns and the pre/post boost data 
indicate that Nimenrix effectively primes children and is able to boost MenC responses following 
priming with an alternative conjugate. The rSBA assays and hSBA assay (the latter being GSK’s in-
house assay) generally paint a similar picture even though the results are numerically quite different.  
There are some issues that do need to be addressed, such as presenting the data from the extension 
of study 081 by age sub-group and discussing the rather strange pattern of MenA findings over time. 
However, these issues can be taken up within the forthcoming variation planned to be filed in 
December 2015. On that basis the assessor proposes not to issue a RSI at this time but to address all 
issues under that single variation intended to update the information in the current SmPC.

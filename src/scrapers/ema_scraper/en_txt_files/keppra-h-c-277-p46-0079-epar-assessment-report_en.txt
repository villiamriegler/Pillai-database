Conclusion 
• 
• 
The efficacy of monotherapy with LEV 1000mg/day to 2000mg/day in Japanese subjects aged 
≥16 years with newly or recently diagnosed epilepsy was demonstrated by the measurements 
of 6-month and 12-month seizure freedom.  
The safety profile for LEV monotherapy was similar to the known data and appeared to be safe 
and well tolerated in subjects. 
2.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
Results from N01375 show efficacy of monotherapy with LEV 1000mg/day to 2000mg/day in Japanese 
subjects aged ≥16 years with newly or recently diagnosed epilepsy as measured by 6-month and 12-
month seizure freedom. 
The evaluation of the safety data demonstrated that LEV was well tolerated. No new safety concerns 
were identified in this study.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, AbbVie Limited submitted to the 
European Medicines Agency on 28 March 2018 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed: 
Variation requested 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.13  
Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this 
Type II 
II and IIIB 
Annex which involve the submission of studies to the 
competent authority 
Submission of the interim report from study M14-032 a phase II open-label study investigating efficacy 
and safety of venetoclax in patients with CLL with relapse or refractory to B-cell receptor signalling 
pathway inhibitor therapy, listed as a category 2 study in the RMP.  
Consequently, the remaining SOB is fulfilled and Annex II E is updated accordingly. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Annex II and Package Leaflet. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance  
Venetoclax received a conditional marketing authorization (EMEA/H/C/004106) in the EU on 05 
December 2016. The current submission of the interim report of the Phase II Study M14-032 is 
towards the fulfilment of the Specific Obligation subject to which the conditional marketing 
authorization has been granted: "In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of venetoclax, the 
MAH should submit the clinical study report of study M14-032 investigating venetoclax in patients with 
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia relapsed after or refractory to treatment with B-cell receptor signalling 
pathway inhibitors". 
The basis to support efficacy of venetoclax in adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) 
in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutations was the pivotal M13-982, where 106 patients (of a 
total 107) with del17p-CLL were enrolled in the main cohort.  
In the submitted report of study M14-032 (a Phase II open-label study of the efficacy and safety of 
venetoclax in chronic lymphocytic leukemia subjects with relapse or refractory to B-cell receptor 
signaling pathway inhibitor therapy), patients who have previously received treatment with ibrutinib 
(n=91) and/or idelalisib (n=36), have relapsed on treatment, or experienced progression after 
discontinuation of either one of these agents were evaluated.  Latest analysed efficacy outcomes 
(investigator assessed objective response rate (ORR) 65.4%; nodular partial remission (nPR) 2.4%; 
partial remission (PR) 52.8%) are consistent with earlier results (investigator assessed ORR 64%; nPR 
3%; PR 52%). Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessed outcomes as of study cut-off date 
provided for a thorough assessment of efficacy. Progression-free survival (PFS) 12 months estimate is 
similar to original submitted data. Overall survival (OS) results are not yet mature but this is expected 
due to the chronic nature of the disease. 
The safety profile presented in study M14-032 is consistent with known safety profile of venetoclax 
with diarrhoea, nausea, anaemia, and neutropenia among the most common Treatment Emergent 
Adverse Events (TEAEs).

Overall, data submitted confirmed the positive benefit/risk balance of Venclyxto in the approved 
indications. The submission of the present data fulfils the SOB and the CHMP was of the view that 
subject to the data submitted the dossier is now comprehensive. Therefore the CHMP recommends 
granting of a MA no longer subject to specific obligations.  
Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, this application regarding the following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.13  
Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in 
Type II 
I, II and 
this Annex which involve the submission of studies to 
IIIB 
the competent authority 
The Annex II is being updated following the fulfilment of Specific Obligation, which was requested to 
confirm the efficacy and safety of venetoclax in monotherapy, based on the assessment of interim 
study report of M14-032.  In addition, section 5.1 of SmPC is being updated to reflect the updated 
results of Study M14-032. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.  
Study M14-032 is: a phase II open-label study investigating efficacy and safety of venetoclax in 
patients with CLL with relapse or refractory to B-cell receptor signalling pathway inhibitor therapy, 
listed as a category 2 study in the RMP.  The CHMP recommends granting of a marketing authorisation 
no longer subject to specific obligations.  
 is recommended for approval. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
The following obligation has been fulfilled, and therefore it is recommended that it be deleted from the 
Annex II to the Opinion: 
"In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of venetoclax, the MAH should submit the clinical 
study report of study M14-032 investigating venetoclax in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
relapsed after or refractory to treatment with B-cell receptor signalling pathway inhibitors"

4.  Scientific discussion 
4.1.  Introduction 
Venetoclax (also referred to as ABT-199 and GDC-0199) is a first-in-class, orally bioavailable, small-
molecule B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 family protein inhibitor in the biarylacylsulfonamide chemical class. 
Venetoclax is being developed jointly by AbbVie and Genentech Roche for the treatment of several 
haematological malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin's 
lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukaemia, and 
myelodysplastic syndrome. 
The currently approved indication in the EU is: 
"Venclyxto monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in the 
presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or have failed a B 
cell receptor pathway inhibitor. 
Venclyxto monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of CLL in the absence of 17p deletion or TP53 
mutation in adult patients who have failed both chemoimmunotherapy and a B cell receptor pathway 
inhibitor." 
Venetoclax was granted a conditional marketing authorisation pursuant to Article 14(7) of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004, by Commission Decision on 5 December 2016, subject to a specific obligation 
whereby the MAH was required to complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures: 
Description 
Due date 
In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of venetoclax, the MAH should 
March 2018 
submit the clinical study report of study M14-032 investigating venetoclax in 
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia relapsed after or refractory to 
treatment with B-cell receptor signalling pathway inhibitors. 
At the time of initial Marketing Authorisation of Venclyxto the MAH was required to provide further 
comprehensive clinical data to confirm efficacy and safety of venetoclax in the proposed indications 
with a specific focus on patients who had previously received ibrutinib or idelalisib as at the time of the 
venetoclax development these agents were being authorised and were not yet standard treatment. 
Therefore, the aim of the SOB from the efficacy perspective was to further confirm the efficacy of 
venetoclax in CLL patients who progressed on or after idelalisib or ibrutinib where patient numbers 
were low in the pivotal trial of the MAA. The updated M14-032 report was required to be submitted in 
2018 (with number of subjects: n=124) providing longer term efficacy and safety follow up for original 
cohort (n=64) and a second, 60 patient cohort that has been added to the M14-032 protocol; of which 
55 patients ((23 subjects with del 17p/TP53mut; 30 patients without del 17p/TP53mut) were enrolled 
at the time of Venclyxto approval. A complete 36 week response assessment for the second cohort was 
also required by CHMP.  
These data were provided with the present submission of the interim report of trial M14-032 in line 
with the agreed deadline of March 2018.

The above measure is also listed as an additional pharmacovigilance activity category 2 in the risk 
management plan (RMP) with a due date of March 2018. Its purpose – in the context of the RMP - was 
to help address safety in long term exposure > 12 months and second primary malignancies and 
Richter's transformation in longer exposure to venetoclax. 
The CHMP considered at the time of MA authorisation that this data will enable confirmation of benefit 
– risk in the target population of venetoclax. 
At the time of market authorisation, study M14-032 intended to reach a median treatment duration of 
≥24 months with data able to inform on exposure beyond 12 months. The interim study report was 
considered appropriate to fulfil the condition for the CMA. Final CSR was at that time to be anticipated 
by 2Q2019 and is expected to be submitted to CHMP for assessment. 
The MAH states that this application is intended to fulfil the specific obligation [SOB] subject to which 
the conditional marketing authorization has been granted, and proposed deletion of the SOB from 
Annex II.E and an update to the package leaflet to remove reference to the conditional approval.  
No RMP update was proposed with this variation. The RMP was assessed in a parallel submission (see 
procedure II/08). 
5.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
5.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study M14-032 is fully enrolled but considered ongoing due to the fact that survival information will be 
collected up to 5 years after the last subject has been enrolled. A summary of the study as of 26 July 
2017 is provided below. This is the interim report being submitted to satisfy the specific obligation. 
Title of Study: A Phase II open-label study of the efficacy and safety of venetoclax (ABT-199/GDC-

One hundred twenty-seven subjects in Study M14-032 were enrolled with a median duration of 
venetoclax exposure of 14.3 (range: 0.1 – 31.4) months. All subjects in the main cohort crossed the 
24-week assessment. All subjects in the expansion cohort had the 36-week assessment. Median study 
follow-up was 16.9 months. 
The primary efficacy endpoint, objective response rate (ORR), was calculated for all subjects in Study 
M14-032 based on International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) National Cancer 
Institute-Working Group (NCI-WG) criteria.

5.2.  Results 
The majority of subjects enrolled in the study were white (92.1%) and male (70.1%). The median 
number of prior oncology regimens was 4 (range 1 to 15). The subjects ranged in age from 28 to 85 
years of age (median: 66 years). At screening, a total of 52 subjects (40.9%) had one or more nodes 
≥ 5 cm; 14 subjects (11.0%) had one or more nodes ≥ 10 cm.

a.  Data are as of 26 July 2017. 
b.  Subjects with progressive disease, stable disease, or incomplete data were considered non-
responders by the IRC.   
Note:        IRC assessments were performed at Week 24 for the Main Cohort and Week 36 for 
the Expansion Cohort. 
Key secondary efficacy endpoints included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival 
(PFS), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS), and were calculated for all subjects in 
Study M14-032. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of DOR at 12 months for total ibrutinib failure subjects 
and total idelalisib failure subjects were 86.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 73.5%, 93.3%) and 
90.2% (95% CI: 66.2%, 97.5%), respectively. The median duration of PFS is 24.7 months in ibrutinib 
failure total cohort, and was not reached in the idelalisib failure total cohort. Per investigator 
assessment, median time to first response for all subjects was 2.5 months (range: 1.6 to 14.9 
months).The Kaplan-Meier estimate for OS for all subjects at 12 months was 92.0% (95% CI: 85.6%, 
95.6%) and was similar between total ibrutinib failure and total idelalisib failure subjects.

The efficacy data were further evaluated by an IRC demonstrating a combined ORR of 70% (Arm A: 
70%; Arm B: 69%). One patient (ibrutinib failure) achieved complete remission with incomplete 
marrow recovery. The ORR for patients with 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation was 72% (33/46) 
(95% CI: 56.5, 84.0) in Arm A and 67% (8/12) (95% CI: 34.9, 90.1) in Arm B. For patients without 
17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation, the ORR was 69% (31/45) (95% CI: 53.4, 81.8) in Arm A and 
71% (17/24) (95% CI: 48.9, 87.4) in Arm B. 
Median OS and DOR were not reached with median follow-up of approximately 14.3 months for Arm A 
and 14.7 months for Arm B. 
Twenty-five percent (32/127) of patients were MRD negative in the peripheral blood, including 8 
patients who were also MRD negative in bone marrow. 
5.3.  Discussion 
Study M14-032, an open-label, multi-center, non-randomised phase II trial in patients with CLL who 
had been previously treated with and failed ibrutinib or idelalisib therapy - is now fully enrolled. The 
study is still ongoing due to planned 5-year survival follow up but more mature data (compared to 
previous submissions) are presented regarding several efficacy endpoints.  
At the time of data cut-off (26 July 2017), 127 patients were enrolled and treated with venetoclax. Of 
these, 91 patients had received prior ibrutinib therapy (Arm A) and 36 had received prior idelalisib 
therapy (Arm B). The median age was 66 years (range: 28 to 85 years), 70% were male, and 92% 
were white. The median time since diagnosis was 8.3 years (range: 0.3 to 18.5 years; N=96). 
Chromosomal aberrations were 11q deletion (34%, 43/127), 17p deletion (40%, 50/127), TP53 
mutation (38%, 26/127) and unmutated IgVH (78%, 72/127). At baseline, 41% of patients had one or 
more nodes ≥5 cm and 31% had ALC ≥25 x 109/l. The median number of prior oncology treatments 
was 4 (range: 1 to 15) in ibrutinib-treated patients and 3 (range: 1 to 11) in idelalisib-treated 
patients. Overall, 65% of patients received prior nucleoside analogue, 86% rituximab, 39% other 
monoclonal antibodies, and 72% alkylating agent (including 41% with bendamustine). At the time of 
evaluation, median duration of treatment with venetoclax was 14.3 months (range: 0.1 to 
31.4 months).  
The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR according to IWCLL updated NCI-WG guidelines. Response 
assessments were performed at 8 weeks, 24 weeks, and every 12 weeks thereafter. 
The efficacy data were further evaluated by an IRC demonstrating a combined ORR of 70% (Arm A: 
70%; Arm B: 69%). One patient (ibrutinib failure) achieved complete remission with incomplete 
marrow recovery. The ORR for patients with 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation was 72% (33/46) 
(95% CI: 56.5, 84.0) in Arm A and 67% (8/12) (95% CI: 34.9, 90.1) in Arm B. For patients without 
17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation, the ORR was 69% (31/45) (95% CI: 53.4, 81.8) in Arm A and 
71% (17/24) (95% CI: 48.9, 87.4) in Arm B. 
Median OS and DOR were not reached with median follow-up of approximately 14.3 months for Arm A 
and 14.7 months for Arm B. 
Twenty-five percent (32/127) of patients were MRD negative in the peripheral blood, including 8 
patients who were also MRD negative in bone marrow. 
At the time of the MAA data cut-off, 64 patients were enrolled and treated with venetoclax. Of these, 
43 patients had received prior ibrutinib therapy (Arm A) and 21 had received prior idelalisib therapy 
Assessment report

(Arm B). Of the patients, 91% (39/42) in Arm A had relapsed on or were refractory to ibrutinib and 
67% (14/21) in Arm B had relapsed on or were refractory to idelalisib. The primary efficacy endpoint 
was ORR according to IWCLL updated NCI-WG guidelines was 67% with CR at 7%.  
The updated efficacy results, as presented by the MAH above, are in line with, or slightly more 
positive, than previous presented efficacy results. Investigator assessed ORR was initial 64% and at 
latest data cut-off 65.4%. CR + CRi has changed from 9% to 10.2% (0.8% IRC assessed) and 12 
months PFS estimate has changed from 72% to 76.8% (81.1% IRC assessed). PFS estimate beyond 
12 months declines, but not unexpectedly and at 18 months there are still a sufficient number of 
patients in the analysis whereas data become more immature at the 24 months estimate. The SmPC 
has been updated to include updated efficacy data from Study M14-032 as of 26 July 2017 data cutoff 
(see SmPC point 5.1). 
6.  Clinical Safety aspects 
6.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
As of 26 July 2017, 127 subjects in Study M14-032 were enrolled with a median duration of venetoclax 
exposure of 14.3 (range: 0.1 – 31.4) months. A total of 59 subjects discontinued venetoclax, including 
7 subjects who discontinued venetoclax during ramp-up. The most common primary reasons for study 
discontinuation were progressive disease (35 subjects, including 6 subjects with Richter's 
transformation), AEs related to progression (2 subjects), AEs not related to progression (7 subjects), 
and stem cell transplant (6 subjects).

MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
Based on cumulative safety data for venetoclax to date, the following adverse events of special 
interest have been closely monitored: tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), neutropenia, and serious 
infections. 
Of the 8 subjects identified as meeting Howard Criteria for laboratory TLS (LTLS), 2 subjects were 
identified as having LTLS during medical review, both with high tumor burden. Six subjects identified 
for meeting Howard criteria had confounding factors: 4 of these subjects had confounding factors due 
to other medical events and 2 of these subjects had electrolyte changes before administration or after 
discontinuation of venetoclax. 
Overall, the updated data from Study M14-032 continue to demonstrate that 400 mg venetoclax was 
well tolerated, and the available safety profile is comparable to that observed in the overall venetoclax 
monotherapy CLL clinical programme. 
With regards to the RMP category 2 commitments, the current data do not confirm a contributory role 
of venetoclax to the events of second primary malignancies or Richter's transformation. These two 
potential safety concerns will continue to be monitored using a number of other ongoing monotherapy 
studies as outlined in the current RMP as well as the non- interventional Prospective Observational 
Study to Assess the Long Term Safety Profile of Venetoclax in a Swedish cohort of CLL patients 
(Protocol P16-562), agreed by CHMP 25th January 2018. 
In the SmPC the following tabulated list of adverse reactions is available:

Tumour lysis syndrome is an important identified risk when initiating venetoclax. 
In 122 patients with CLL starting with a daily dose of 20 mg and increasing over 5 weeks to a daily 
dose of 400 mg, the rate of TLS was 3%. 
In addition the MAH was requested to provide further information on IRC assessed efficacy from the 
same data cut off time Table 7 in the SmPC.

6.3.  Discussion 
The MAH presented a comprehensive safety report including presentation of the individual study data 
as well as integrated safety data. Reported frequency of TEAEs and common SAEs in study M14-032 
are consistent with frequencies described in SmPC. No new safety concerns have been described.  
IRC assessment of responses does not change significantly between previous and more recent 
evaluation. The differences are not considered clinical significant.  
The safety profile presented in study report M14-032 does not change benefit / risk balance of 
Venclyxto in approved indications. 
The MAH will discuss and update section 4.8 of the SmPC with updated safety analysis of studies: M14-
032, M12-175 and M13-982 in the context of another procedure currently under assessment in order 
to reflect the most up to safety information from each study.

7.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, Annex II has been updated to remove the SOB. 
Furthermore, upon request by the CHMP, the MAH has updated SmPC section 5.1 to include the latest 
efficacy  analyses  from  study  M14-032.  The  package  leaflet  was  also  updated  to  remove  reference  to 
the conditional approval. 
Safety information will be included in the SmPC 4.8, as combined safety data from multiple studies in 
the context of an ongoing variation.

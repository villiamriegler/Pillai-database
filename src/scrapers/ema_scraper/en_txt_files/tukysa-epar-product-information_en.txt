Co-administration with CYP2C8 inhibitors 
Concomitant use with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors should be avoided. If coadministration with a strong 
CYP2C8 inhibitor cannot be avoided, the starting tucatinib dose should be reduced to 100 mg orally 
4 
 
 
twice daily. After discontinuation of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor for 3 elimination half-lives, the 
tucatinib dose that was taken prior to initiating the inhibitor should be resumed (see section 4.4 and 
section 4.5). Monitoring for TUKYSA toxicity should be increased when administered with moderate 
CYP2C8 inhibitors.  
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in patients aged ≥ 65 years (see section 5.2). Tucatinib has not been 
investigated in patients above the age of 80 years. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (see 
section 5.2).  
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), a reduced starting dose of 200 mg orally 
twice daily is recommended. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of TUKYSA in paediatric patients have not been established. No data are 
available. 
Method of administration  
TUKYSA is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole and should not be chewed, crushed, 
or split prior to swallowing (see section 5.2).  
TUKYSA should be taken approximately 12 hours apart, at the same time every day, with or without a 
meal. TUKYSA may be taken at the same time with capecitabine.  
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Laboratory Tests 
Increased ALT, AST, and bilirubin 
Increased ALT, AST, and bilirubin have been reported during treatment with tucatinib (see 
section 4.8). ALT, AST, and total bilirubin should be monitored every three weeks or as clinically 
indicated. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, treatment with tucatinib should be interrupted, 
then dose reduced or permanently discontinued (see section 4.2).  
Increased creatinine without impaired renal function 
Increase in serum creatinine (30% mean increase) has been observed due to inhibition of renal tubular 
transport of creatinine without affecting glomerular function (see section 4.8). Alternative markers 
such as BUN, cystatin C, or calculated GFR, which are not based on creatinine, may be considered to 
determine whether renal function is impaired.

Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea, including severe events such as dehydration, hypotension, acute kidney injury and death, 
has been reported during treatment with tucatinib (see section 4.8). If diarrhoea occurs, antidiarrheals 
should be administered as clinically indicated. For Grade ≥3 diarrhoea, treatment with tucatinib should 
be interrupted, then dose reduced or permanently discontinued (see section 4.2). Prompt medical 
management should also be instituted in the event of persistence of concomitant Grade 2 diarrhoea 
with concomitant Grade ≥2 nausea and/or vomiting. Diagnostic tests should be performed as clinically 
indicated to exclude infectious causes of Grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea or diarrhoea of any grade with 
complicating features (dehydration, fever, neutropenia). 
Embryo-foetal toxicity 
Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, tucatinib may cause harmful 
effects to the foetus when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, 
administration of tucatinib to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused foetal abnormalities in 
rabbits at maternal exposures similar to the clinical exposures at the recommended dose.  
Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a foetus. Women of childbearing potential 
should be advised to use effective contraception during and up to at least 1 week after the last dose of 
treatment (see section 4.6). Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential should also be 
advised to use an effective method of contraception during and up to at least 1 week after the last dose 
of treatment. 
Sensitive CYP3A substrates 
Tucatinib is a strong CYP3A inhibitor. Thus, tucatinib has the potential to interact with medicinal 
products that are metabolised by CYP3A, which may lead to increased plasma concentrations of the 
other product (see section 4.5). When tucatinib is co-administered with other medicinal products, the 
SmPC for the other product should be consulted for the recommendations regarding co-administration 
with CYP3A inhibitors. Concomitant treatment of tucatinib with CYP3A substrates when minimal 
concentration changes may lead to serious or life–threatening adverse reactions should be avoided. If 
concomitant use is unavoidable, the CYP3A substrate dosage should be reduced in accordance with 
the concomitant medicinal product SmPC.  
P-gp substrates 
Concomitant use of tucatinib with a P-gp substrate increased the plasma concentrations of P-gp 
substrate, which may increase the toxicity associated with a P-gp substrate. Dose reduction of P-gp 
substrates (including sensitive intestinal substrate such as dabigatran) should be considered in 
accordance with the concomitant medicine SmPC and P-gp substrates should be administered with 
caution when minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicities. 
Strong CYP3A/moderate CYP2C8 inducers 
Concomitant use of tucatinib with a strong CYP3A or moderate CYP2C8 inducer decreased tucatinib 
concentrations, which may reduce tucatinib activity. Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inducer or 
moderate CYP2C8 inducer should be avoided. 
Strong/moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors 
Concomitant use of tucatinib with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor increased tucatinib concentrations , 
which may increase the risk of tucatinib toxicity. Concomitant use with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors 
should be avoided (see section 4.2).  
There are no clinical data on the impact of concomitant use of moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors on 
tucatinib concentrations. Monitoring for tucatinib toxicity should be increased with moderate CYP2C8 
inhibitors.

Information about excipients 
This medicinal product contains 55.3 mg sodium per 300 mg dose. This is equivalent to 2.75% of the 
recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
This medicinal product contains 60.6 mg potassium per 300 mg dose. This should be taken into 
consideration for patients who have impaired kidney function or are on a controlled potassium diet 
(diet with low potassium content).  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Tucatinib is primarily metabolised by CYP2C8. Tucatinib is a metabolism-based inactivator of 
CYP3A and inhibits renal transporters of metformin and creatinine. Tucatinib is a substrate of P–gp.  
Effects of other medicinal products on tucatinib 
CYP3A/CYP2C8 inducers 
A clinical drug interaction study found that co-administration of a single dose of 300 mg tucatinib with 
rifampicin (a strong CYP3A and moderate CYP2C8 inducer) resulted in a reduction in tucatinib 
concentrations (0.6-fold Cmax (90% CI: 0.5, 0.8) and 0.5-fold AUC (90% CI: 0.4, 0.6)). 
Co-administration of tucatinib with strong CYP3A or moderate CYP2C8 inducers such as rifampicin, 
phenytoin, St. John's wort, or carbamazepine should be avoided as this may result in decreased activity 
of tucatinib (see section 4.4). 
CYP2C8 inhibitors 
A clinical drug interaction study found that co-administration of a single dose of 300 mg tucatinib with 
gemfibrozil (a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in tucatinib concentrations (1.6-fold 
Cmax (90% CI: 1.5, 1.8) and 3.0-fold AUC (90% CI: 2.7, 3.5)). Co-administration of tucatinib with 
strong CYP2C8 inhibitors such as gemfibrozil should be avoided as this may result in increased risk of 
tucatinib toxicity (see section 4.4). 
CYP3A inhibitors 
A clinical drug interaction study found that co-administration of a single dose of 300 mg tucatinib with 
itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor) resulted in an increase in tucatinib concentrations (1.3-fold 
Cmax (90% CI: 1.2, 1.4) and 1.3-fold AUC (90% CI: 1.3, 1.4)). No dose adjustment is required. 
Proton pump inhibitors 
Based on clinical drug interaction studies conducted with tucatinib, no drug interactions were observed 
when tucatinib is combined with omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor). No dose adjustment is 
required. 
Effects of tucatinib on other medicinal products 
CYP3A substrates 
Tucatinib is a strong CYP3A inhibitor. A clinical drug interaction study found that co-administration 
of tucatinib with midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) resulted in an increase in midazolam 
concentrations (3.0-fold Cmax (90% CI: 2.6, 3.4) and 5.7-fold AUC (90% CI: 5.0, 6.5)). 
Co-administration of tucatinib with sensitive CYP3A substrates such as alfentanil, avanafil, buspirone, 
darifenacin, darunavir, ebastine, everolimus, ibrutinib, lomitapide, lovastatin, midazolam, naloxegol, 
saquinavir, simvastatin, sirolimus, tacrolimus, tipranavir, triazolam, and vardenafil may increase their 
systemic exposures which may increase the toxicity associated with a CYP3A substrate. Concomitant 
use of tucatinib with CYP3A substrates, when minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or 
life-threatening toxicities, should be avoided. If concomitant use is unavoidable, the CYP3A substrate 
dosage should be decreased in accordance with the concomitant medicinal product SmPC.  
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
P-gp substrates 
A clinical drug interaction study found that co-administration of tucatinib with digoxin (a sensitive 
P-gp substrate) resulted in an increase in digoxin concentrations (2.4-fold Cmax (90% CI: 1.9, 2.9) and 
1.5-fold AUC (90% CI: 1.3, 1.7)). Concomitant use of tucatinib with a P-gp substrate may increase the 
plasma concentrations of the P-gp substrate, which may increase the toxicity associated with the P-gp 
substrate. Dose reduction of P-gp substrates (including sensitive intestinal substrate such as 
dabigatran) should be considered in accordance with the concomitant medicine SmPC and P-gp 
substrates should be administered with caution when minimal concentration changes may lead to 
serious or life-threatening toxicities (see section 4.4). 
CYP2C8 substrates 
A clinical drug interaction study found that co-administration of tucatinib with repaglinide (a CYP2C8 
substrate) resulted in an increase in repaglinide concentrations (1.7-fold Cmax (90% CI: 1.4, 2.1) and 
1.7-fold AUC (90% CI: 1.5, 1.9)). No dose adjustment is required. 
MATE1/2K substrates 
A clinical drug interaction study found that co-administration of tucatinib with metformin (a 
MATE1/2-K substrate) resulted in an increase in metformin concentrations (1.1-fold Cmax (90% CI: 
1.0, 1.2) and 1.4-fold AUC (90% CI: 1.2, 1.5)). Tucatinib reduced the renal clearance of metformin 
without any effect on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as measured by iohexol clearance and serum 
cystatin C. No dose adjustment is required. 
CYP2C9 substrates 
Based on clinical drug interaction studies conducted with tucatinib, no drug interactions were observed 
when tucatinib is combined with tolbutamide (a sensitive CYP2C9 substrate). No dose adjustment is 
required. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females 
Based on findings in animals, tucatinib may cause harmful pharmacological effects when administered 
to women during pregnancy and/or on the foetus/newborn child. Women of childbearing potential 
should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception during and up to at 
least 1 week after treatment. Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential should also 
be advised to use effective contraception during and up to at least 1 week after treatment (see section 
4.4).  
Please also refer to section 4.6 of the prescribing information for trastuzumab and capecitabine. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of tucatinib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). TUKYSA should not be used during pregnancy unless the 
clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with tucatinib. The pregnancy status of women of 
childbearing potential should be verified prior to initiating treatment with tucatinib. If the patient 
becomes pregnant during treatment, the potential hazard to the foetus/newborn child must be 
explained to the patient. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether tucatinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with 
TUKYSA. Breast-feeding may be resumed 1 week after treatment.  
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility 
No fertility studies in men or women have been conducted. Based on findings from animal studies, 
tucatinib may impair fertility in females of reproductive potential (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
TUKYSA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. The clinical status of 
the patient should be considered when assessing the patient’s ability to perform tasks that require 
judgment, motor, or cognitive skills.  
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions (≥5%) during treatment are diarrhoea 
(13%), ALT increased (6%) and AST increased (5%). 
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 29% of patients treated with tucatinib, and include diarrhoea 
(4%), vomiting (3%), and nausea (2%).  
Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of TUKYSA occurred in 6% of patients; the most 
common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were diarrhoea (1%) and ALT increased (1%). 
Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction of TUKYSA occurred in 23% of patients; the most 
common adverse reactions leading to dose reduction were diarrhoea (6%), ALT increased (5%), and 
AST increased (4%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The data summarised in this section reflect exposure to TUKYSA in 431 patients with locally 
advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received TUKYSA in 
combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine across two studies, HER2CLIMB and ONT-380-005 
(see section 5.1). The median duration of exposure to TUKYSA across these studies was 7.4 months 
(range, <0.1, 43.6).  
The adverse reactions observed during treatment are listed in this section by frequency category. 
Frequency categories are defined as follows: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Increased ALT, AST, or bilirubin 
In HER2CLIMB, increased ALT, AST or bilirubin occurred in 41% of patients treated with tucatinib 
in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine. Grade 3 and above events occurred in 9% of 
patients. Increased ALT, AST or bilirubin led to dose reduction in 9% of patients and treatment 
discontinuation in 1.5% of patients. The median time to onset of any grade increased ALT, AST, or 
bilirubin was 37 days; 84% of events resolved, with a median time to resolution of 22 days. 
Monitoring and dose modification (including discontinuation) should be considered (see section 4.4).  
Diarrhoea 
In HER2CLIMB, diarrhoea occurred in 82% of patients treated with tucatinib in combination with 
trastuzumab and capecitabine. Grade 3 and above diarrhoea events occurred in 13% of patients. Two 
patients who developed Grade 4 diarrhoea subsequently died, with diarrhoea as a contributor to death. 
Diarrhoea led to dose reduction in 6% of the patients and treatment discontinuation in 1% of the 
patients. The median time to onset of any grade diarrhoea was 12 days; 81% of diarrhoea events 
resolved, with a median time to resolution of 8 days. Prophylactic use of antidiarrheals was not 
required. Antidiarrheal medicinal products were used in less than half of the treatment cycles where 
diarrhoea events were reported. The median duration of antidiarrheal use was 3 days per cycle (see 
section 4.4).  
Increased creatinine without impaired renal function 
Increase in serum creatinine has been observed in patients treated with tucatinib due to inhibition of 
renal tubular transport of creatinine without affecting glomerular function. In clinical studies, increases 
in serum creatinine (30% mean increase) occurred within the first cycle of tucatinib, remained 
elevated but stable throughout treatment and were reversible upon treatment discontinuation.  
Special populations 
Elderly 
In the HER2CLIMB study, 82 patients who received tucatinib were ≥65 years, of whom 8 patients 
were ≥75 years. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 34% in patients ≥ 65 years compared 
to 28% in patients < 65 years. There were too few patients ≥75 years to assess differences in safety. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
There is no specific antidote, and the benefit of haemodialysis in the treatment of tucatinib overdose is 
unknown. In the event of an overdose, treatment with tucatinib should be withheld and general 
supportive measures should be applied.

Mechanism of action 
Tucatinib is a reversible, potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of HER2. In cellular signalling 
assays, tucatinib is >1000-fold more selective for HER2 compared to epidermal growth factor 
receptor. In vitro, tucatinib inhibits phosphorylation of HER2 and HER3, resulting in inhibition of 
downstream cell signalling and cell proliferation, and induces death in HER2 driven tumour cells. In 
vivo, tucatinib inhibits the growth of HER2 driven tumours and the combination of tucatinib and 
trastuzumab showed enhanced anti-tumour activity in vitro and in vivo compared to either medicinal 
product alone.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Cardiac electrophysiology  
Multiple doses of tucatinib 300 mg twice a day did not have an effect on the QTc interval in a TQT 
study in healthy subjects. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine was evaluated in a 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active comparator, global study (HER2CLIMB). 
Patients enrolled had locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, with or 
without brain metastases, and had prior treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab 
emtansine (T-DM1) separately or in combination, in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting. 
HER2 overexpression or amplification was confirmed by central laboratory analysis. 
Patients with brain metastases, including those with untreated or progressing lesions, were eligible to 
enrol provided they were neurologically stable and did not require immediate brain radiation or 
surgery. Patients who required immediate local intervention could receive local therapy and be 
subsequently enrolled. The study included patients with untreated brain metastases and patients with 
treated brain metastases that were either stable or progressing since last brain radiation or surgery. 
Patients were excluded from the study if they received systemic corticosteroids (≥2 mg total daily of 
dexamethasone or equivalent) for control of symptoms of CNS metastases <28 days prior to the first 
dose of study treatment. The study also excluded patients with leptomeningeal disease. Patients who 
had previously been treated with HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors were excluded with the exception of 
patients who received lapatinib for ≤21 days and was discontinued for reasons other than disease 
progression or severe toxicity. For patients with hormone receptor positive tumors, endocrine therapy 
was not permitted as concomitant therapy, with the exception of gonadotropin-releasing hormone 
agonists used for ovarian suppression in premenopausal women. 
A total of 612 patients were randomised 2:1 to receive tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and 
capecitabine (N=410) or placebo in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine (N=202). 
Randomisation was stratified by the presence or history of brain metastases (yes vs. no), Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 vs. 1), and region (U.S., Canada, or rest 
of world). 
Patient demographics were balanced between treatment arms. The median age was 54 years 
(range, 25 to 82); 116 (19%) patients were aged 65 years or older. 444 patients were white (73%) and 
607 were female (99%). 314 patients (51%) had an ECOG performance status of 1 and 298 patients 
(49%) had an ECOG performance status of 0. Sixty percent had oestrogen and/or progesterone 
receptor-positive disease. Forty-eight percent of patients had a presence or history of brain metastases; 
of these, 23% had untreated brain metastases, 40% had treated but stable brain metastases, and 37% 
had treated but radiographically progressing brain metastases. Additionally, 49% of patients had lung 
metastases, 35% had liver metastases, and 14% had skin metastases. Patients had a median of 4 (range, 
2 to 17) prior lines of systemic therapy and a median of 3 (range, 1 to 14) prior lines of systemic 
therapy in the metastatic setting. All patients received prior trastuzumab-based treatments and 
trastuzumab emtansine, while all but two patients had prior pertuzumab-based treatment.

Tucatinib or placebo, 300 mg orally twice per day, was administered until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. Trastuzumab was administered intravenously as a loading dose of 8 mg/kg on 
Day 1 of Cycle 1, followed by a maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg on Day 1 of each subsequent 21-day 
cycle. An alternate dosing option for trastuzumab was a fixed dose of 600 mg administered 
subcutaneously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Capecitabine, 1000 mg/m2 orally twice per day, was 
administered on Days 1 through 14 of each 21-day cycle.  
The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review 
(BICR) in the first 480 randomized patients. In this population, the median duration of exposure to 
tucatinib was 7.3 months (range <0.1, 35.1) for patients on the tucatinib + trastuzumab + capecitabine 
arm compared to 4.4 months (range <0.1, 24.0) of placebo for patients on the placebo + trastuzumab + 
capecitabine arm. Similar differences in exposure to trastuzumab and capecitabine were observed. 
Secondary endpoints were evaluated in all randomized patients (N=612) and included overall survival 
(OS), PFS among patients with a history or presence of brain metastases (PFSBrainMets) and confirmed 
objective response rate (ORR). 
Primary and key secondary endpoint results were consistent across pre-specified subgroups: hormone 
receptor status, presence or history of brain metastases, ECOG status, and region. PFS as determined 
by the investigator was consistent with PFS as assessed by BICR. 
Efficacy results from the primary analysis are summarized in Table 5 and Figures 1 and 2.

As planned per protocol, approximately two years after last patient randomized, the final OS analysis 
was performed based on 370 events, which corresponded to a median follow-up of 29.6 months. 
Median OS was 24.7 months (95% CI: 21.6, 28.9) for patients on the tucatinib + trastuzumab + 
capecitabine arm compared to 19.2 months (95% CI: 16.4, 21.4) for patients on the placebo + 
trastuzumab + capecitabine arm (HR = 0.725; 95% CI: 0.585, 0.898). The final OS analysis is present 
in Figure 3.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
TUKYSA in all subsets of the paediatric population in malignant breast neoplasms (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Plasma tucatinib exposure (AUCinf and Cmax) demonstrated dose proportional increases at oral doses 
from 50 to 300 mg (0.17 to 1 time the recommended dose). Tucatinib exhibited 1.7-fold accumulation 
for AUC and 1.5-fold accumulation for Cmax following administration of 300 mg tucatinib twice daily 
for 14 days. Time to steady-state was approximately 4 days. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption 
Following a single oral dose of 300 mg tucatinib, the median time to peak plasma concentration was 
approximately 2.0 hours (range 1.0 to 4.0 hours). 
Effects of food 
Following administration of a single dose of tucatinib in 11 subjects after a high-fat meal 
(approximately 58% fat, 26% carbohydrate, and 16% protein), the mean AUCinf increased by 1.5-fold, 
the Tmax shifted from 1.5 hours to 4.0 hours, and Cmax was unaltered. The effect of food on the 
pharmacokinetics of tucatinib was not clinically meaningful, thus tucatinib may be administered 
without regard to food.  
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution of tucatinib was approximately 1670 L in healthy subjects after a 
single dose of 300 mg. The plasma protein binding was 97.1% at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Biotransformation 
Tucatinib is metabolized primarily by CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent via CYP3A and aldehyde 
oxidase. 
In Vitro drug interaction studies 
Tucatinib is a substrate of CYP2C8 and CYP3A. 
Tucatinib is a reversible inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP3A and a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A, 
at clinically relevant concentrations.  
Tucatinib has low potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and 
UGT1A1 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Tucatinib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. Tucatinib is not a substrate of OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, 
OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2-K, and BSEP. 
Tucatinib inhibits MATE1/MATE2-K-mediated transport of metformin and OCT2/MATE1-mediated 
transport of creatinine. The observed serum creatinine increase in clinical studies with tucatinib is due 
to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine via OCT2 and MATE1. 
Elimination 
Following a single oral dose of 300 mg, tucatinib is cleared from plasma with a geometric mean half-
life of approximately 8.5 hours and apparent clearance of 148 L/h in healthy subjects. 
Excretion 
Tucatinib is predominantly eliminated by the hepatobiliary route and is not appreciably renally 
eliminated. Following a single oral dose of 300 mg 14C-tucatinib, approximately 85.8% of the total 
radiolabelled dose was recovered in faeces (15.9% of the administered dose as unchanged tucatinib) 
and 4.1% in urine with an overall total recovery of 89.9% within 312 hours post-dose. In plasma, 
approximately 75.6% of the plasma radioactivity was unchanged, 19% was attributed to identified 
metabolites, and approximately 5% was unassigned. 
Special populations 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis according to demographic characteristics, age 
(<65 years (N=211); ≥ 65 years (N=27)), albumin (25.0 to 52.0 g/L), creatinine clearance (CLcr 60 to 
89 mL/min (N=89); CLcr 30 to 59 mL/min (N=5)), body weight (40.7 to 138.0 kg), and race (White 
(N=168), Black (N=53), or Asian (N=10)) did not have a clinically meaningful effect on tucatinib 
exposure. There are no data for subjects with severely impaired renal function.  
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment  
The pharmacokinetics of tucatinib have not been evaluated in a dedicated renal impairment study.  
Hepatic impairment 
Mild (Child–Pugh A) and moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment had no clinically relevant 
effect on tucatinib exposure. Tucatinib AUCinf was increased by 1.6-fold in subjects with severe 
(Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. There are no 
data for breast cancer patients with severely impaired hepatic function. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with tucatinib.  
Tucatinib was not clastogenic or mutagenic in the standard battery of genotoxicity assays.  
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, decreased corpora lutea/corpus luteum cyst, increased interstitial 
cells of the ovary, atrophy of the uterus, and mucification of the vagina were observed at doses of 
≥ 6 mg/kg/day administered twice daily, equivalent to 0.09 times the human exposure based on 
AUC0-12 at the recommended dose. No histological effects were observed on male or female 
reproductive tracts in cynomolgus monkeys or on male reproductive tracts in rats at doses resulting in 
exposures up to 8 times (in monkey) or 13 times (in rat) the human exposure at the recommended dose 
based on AUC0-12. 
Embryo-foetal development studies were conducted in rabbits and rats. In pregnant rabbits, increased 
resorptions, decreased percentages of live foetuses, and skeletal, visceral, and external malformations 
were observed in foetuses at ≥90 mg/kg/day; at this dose, maternal exposure is approximately 
equivalent to the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC. In pregnant rats, 
decreased maternal body weight and body weight gain were observed at doses of ≥90 mg/kg/day. 
Foetal effects of decreased weights and delayed ossification were observed at ≥120 mg/kg/day; at this 
dose, maternal exposure is approximately 6-fold higher than human exposure at the recommended 
dose based on AUC.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What TUKYSA is and what it is used for  
What TUKYSA is 
TUKYSA is a medicine for breast cancer. It contains the active substance tucatinib and it belongs to a 
group of medicines called protein kinase inhibitors which prevent the growth of some types of cancer 
cells in the body. 
What TUKYSA is used for 
TUKYSA is used for adults who have breast cancer which: 
-  has a receptor (target) on the cancer cells called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2-positive breast cancer) 
-  has spread beyond the original tumour or to other organs such as the brain or cannot be 
removed by surgery  
-  has previously been treated with certain other breast cancer treatments  
TUKYSA is taken with two other cancer medicines, trastuzumab and capecitabine. Separate patient 
information leaflets are available for these medicines. Ask your doctor to tell you about them. 
How TUKYSA works 
TUKYSA works by blocking the HER2 receptors on cancer cells. HER2 produces signals that can 
help the cancer to grow, and blocking it may slow or stop cancer cells from growing or may kill them 
altogether.

2.  What you need to know before you take TUKYSA  
Do not take TUKYSA 
• 
if you are allergic to tucatinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
Warnings and precautions 
•  Talk to your doctor before taking TUKYSA if you have liver problems. During your treatment, 
your doctor will run tests to check that your liver is working properly. 
•  TUKYSA can cause severe diarrhoea. Talk to your doctor right away at the first sign of 
diarrhoea (loose stool) and if your diarrhoea persists with nausea and/or vomiting.  
•  TUKYSA may cause harm to an unborn baby when taken by a pregnant woman. Talk to your 
doctor before you take TUKYSA if you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a 
baby. See section on “Pregnancy and breast-feeding” below. 
Children and adolescents 
TUKYSA should not be used in children under the age of 18 years. The safety of TUKYSA and how 
effective it is has not been studied in this age group.

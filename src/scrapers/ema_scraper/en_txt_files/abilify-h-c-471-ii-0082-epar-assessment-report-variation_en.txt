1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
Bipolar  disorders  are  severe  and  most  often  chronic  mental  illnesses.  They  are  associated  with 
considerable morbidity and mortality, and for many patients an initial episode of mania or depression 
evolves  into  a  life  long  illness  (Bauer  and  Pfennig  2005).  Of  those  who  recover,  up  to  80%  will 
experience  one  or  more  syndromal  recurrences  over  a  period  of  2  to  5  years  (Birmaher  et  al.  2009, 
Geller  et  al.  2008).  Factors  associated  with  worse  longitudinal  outcome  include  early  age  at  illness 
onset,  long  illness  duration,  mixed  episodes,  rapid  cycling,  psychosis,  subsyndromal  symptoms, 
comorbid disorders, low socioeconomic status, exposure to negative life events, lack of psychotherapy 
treatment, poor adherence to pharmacological treatment, and family psychopathology (Birmaher et al. 
2009). 
Although there has been substantial research on the epidemiology of bipolar disorders in children and 
adolescents, there is still a striking lack of information on estimates of the prevalence and distribution 
of  mental  disorders  generally  in  children.  However,  the  lifetime  prevalence  rates  for  bipolar  disorder 
estimated in a number of cross-sectional surveys have ranged from 0.4 to 1.9% for mania (Merikangas 
et al. 2009).  
The  clinical  differentiation  of  bipolar  I  disorder  and  in  particular  early-onset  mania  from  other  severe 
psychiatric conditions below age 10, such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Conduct 
Disorder (CD), and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), can be complicated and unreliable. In children 
and  adolescents,  bipolar  disorder  is  characterized  by  elevated  mood  and  other  mood  disturbances, 
aggression,  irritability,  and  hyperactivity.  Additional  symptoms  can  include  extreme  emotional 
outbursts, depression, social withdrawal, and sleep disturbances. Bipolar disorder in both children and 
adolescents  is  cyclical  with  high  rates  of  rapid  cycling  and  patients  most  often  present  with  mixed 
episodes  (primarily  irritability  and  explosiveness).  Children  with  bipolar  disorders  can  often  have  a 
protracted, chronic course of illness that is difficult to treat. The degree of impairment and dysfunction 
often results in the loss of social and educational opportunities and thus has a lifelong impact for the 
patients (AACAP 2007). 
Current guidelines for the treatment of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder recommend first-
line  treatment  with  atypical  antipsychotics  or  mood  stabilizers  (AACAP  2007).  By  2007,  the 
recommendation  was  based  on  data  available  for  those  agents  for  bipolar  disorder  in  adults,  as 
evidence  for  the  efficacy  for  these  agents  in  children  and  adolescents  was  sparse.  Despite  the 
significant  rise  in  the  recognition  of  paediatric  bipolar  disorder  and  the  use  of  antipsychotic  agents, 
there remained a lack of data from randomized, placebo-controlled trials to guide treatment decisions. 
The  clinical  development  program  undertaken  by  the  applicant  was  intended  to  address  this  lack  of 
sounding evidence by investigating the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in this patient population. 
In  this  type  II  variation,  the  MAH  initially  applied  for  an  extension  of  indication  of  Abilify  (new 
indication is underlined) as follows: 
“ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in 
adults and in children and adolescents aged 10 years and older.” 
During  the  evaluation,  the  MAH  proposed  to  restrict  the  proposed  indication  to  Bipolar  I  Disorder  in 
children and adolescents aged 13 years and older.

Discussion on non clinical aspects 
No new non clinical data were submitted and this was considered acceptable by the CHMP as relevant 
information  related  to  juvenile  animal  studies  had  already  been  submitted  in  the  context  of  the 
approved variation extending the indication to the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents 15 years 
and older (EMA/H/C/471/II/48) and reflected in the latest approved SmPC for Abilify.

Regarding the ERA, the CHMP agreed that no screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity is 
required  since  the  Log  K OW  is  <4.5.  In  addition  based  on  the  lower  Kow  value  (<1000)  a 
bioconcentration study in fish is not considered necessary. 
The  data  submitted  regarding  the  water  sediment  study  (OECD  308)  suggested  significant  shifting  of 
the  drug  substance  to  the  sediment  (from  day  14  on  more  than  10%  of  aripiprazole  was  present  in 
sediment  extracts),  and  because  aripiprazole  does  not  seems  to  be  ready  biodegradable  (OECD  308 
and  FDA  3.11  studies),  the  study  of  the  effects  on  sediment  organisms,  namely  Chironomids,  was 
conducted  in  tier  B  analysis.  This  study  (OECD  308)  also  suggested  that  aripiprazole  does  not  have 
adverse effects on microbial activity, but a dose response relationship cannot be established.  
From  the  data  submitted  regarding  screening  sorption/desorption  studies  on  aripiprazole  partition  to 
sludge, the CHMP agreed that the data indicates significant sorption to organic carbon in sludge with a 
Koc>10  000  L/kg  which  implies  that  an  environment  assessment  of  the  drug  substance  in  terrestrial 
compartment should be conduct unless readily biodegradable, which does not seems to be the case. A 
tier  B  terrestrial  analysis  was  conducted.  By  comparing  the  PECsoil  (0.000974  mg/kg)  with  the 
Predicted  No  Effect  Concentrations  in  soil  (PNECsoil)  obtained  with  the  lowest  NOEC  (Collembolan 
reproduction) from the full battery of terrestrial studies the applicant concluded that the soil (terrestrial) 
is not impacted by aripiprazole entering the environment.  
In  addition  the  aquatic  and  sediment  compartments  did  not  show  any  impact  from  patient  use  of 
aripiprazole considering the following indications: schizophrenia (authorised in the EU), bipolar disorder 
including  paediatric  population  (only  authorised  in  adults  in  the  EU),  and  Major  Depressive  Disorders 
(not  authorised  in  the  EU)  as  the  corresponding  PEC/PNEC  ratios  are  below  the  threshold  value. 
However  the  surface  water  compartment  PEC/PNEC  ratio  below  one  was  only  achieved  when  further 
PECsw  refinement  was  applied  in  tier  B  to  account  for  sewage  treatment  plant  removal  using  the 
adsorption data and the output from simple treat model, giving a PECsw.refined value of 5.524 x 10-8 
mg/L instead of 2.668 x 10-4 mg/L. 
It  is  worth  noting  that  the  revised  PEC  value  of  0.2668  µg/L  corresponds  to  76%  (because  of  the 
human  metabolism)  of  the  PEC  value  obtained  using  a  refined  Fpen  value  of  0.0234.  This 
higher refined Fpen than the default one, was calculated using annual prevalence of bipolar disorders 
(1% includes the target pediatric population of this application), of schizophrenia (0.35%) and of MDD 
(1%)). In addition there is no requirement to refine the default Fpen, and there is no requirement to 
use a refined Fpen when it is above the default value, as in this case. If the PECsw value (0.15 µg/L) 
obtained with default Fpen (1%) value is used the PEC/PNECsw ratio obtained is below 1 (0.58). So it 
is likely that the margin between PEC and PNEC to be considerable higher as the PECsw was estimated 
very  conservatively,  using  a  Fpen  higher  than  the  default  one  and  not  accounting  for  depletion  via 
sorption  to  sludge  in  a  sewage  treatment  plant,  it  is  therefore  not  expected  that  aripiprazole  should 
pose a risk to the surface water compartment. 
Finally, the precautionary and safety measures taken in order to reduce any risk to the environment by 
including the general statement on the SmPC and PL have been applied which is considered acceptable 
by the CHMP. 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
The development program completed to support the proposed extension of indication consisted of: 
- 
two Phase I studies to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of aripiprazole in children and adolescent 
patients  with  a  primary  schizophrenia  spectrum  diagnosis,  bipolar  spectrum  diagnosis,  or  other 
Assessment Report 
EMA/62007/2013

paediatric  psychiatric  disorders  between  the  age  of  10 - 17 years  (Study  31-03-238)  and  in  children 
and adolescents with conduct disorders between the age of 6 - 17 years (Study CN138014); 
- 
a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4 week study (31-03-240) of 
two fixed oral doses of aripiprazole 10 mg and 30 mg in the treatment of child and adolescent patients, 
aged  10-17 years, with bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed episode with or without psychotic features 
with a 6 month extension period; 
- 
a  phase  III,  multi-center,  open-label  (study  31-03-241)  designed  to  provide  additional  long  term 
safety  data  of  aripiprazole  in  the  paediatric  population.  Patients who  had  completed  study  31-03-239 
(adolescents  with  schizophrenia)  or  had  withdrawn  from  the  double  blind  study  31-03-240  were 
offered to continue in the open-label, flexible-dose study 31-03-241 for an additional 26 weeks.  
Additional  pharmacokinetic  analysis  (study  31-05-242)  was  performed  and  included  a  comparison 
with historical data from adults. 
All  of  the  above  studies  were  previously  submitted  to  the  CHMP.  Studies  31-03-238,  CN138014,  31-
03-240  and  31-03-241  were  submitted  in  the  context  of  the  approved  variation  extending  the 
indication  to  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in  adolescents  15  years  and  older  (EMA/H/C/471/II/48) 
and  study  31-03-240  was  submitted  in  accordance  with  the  article  46  of  the  Paediatric  Regulation 
1901/2006. 
The  applicant  claimed  that  the  above  clinical  development  program  has  been  designed  in  accordance 
with  the  “Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Clinical  Investigation  of  Medicinal  Products  in  the  Treatment  of 
Bipolar Disorder”, (CPMP/EWP/567/98).  
1.3.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Based  on  studies  31-03-238  and  CN138014,  the  linearity  of  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of 
aripiprazole  in  children  and  adolescents  was  considered  as  established.  In  the  paediatric  population, 
C max levels were generally higher compared to those reported from studies with adults. However, when 
values were normalized for body weight, apparent oral clearance was similar in children, adolescents, 
and adults. The CHMP noted that steady-state was attained after 14 days of oral daily (QD) dosing of 
aripiprazole;  similarily  to  the  time  to  steady-state  observed  in  studies  with  adults.    Aripiprazole 
accumulation after 14 days of dosing was similar between children and adolescents i.e 2.4- to 6.4-fold 
and adults i.e 3 to 5 fold. The overall metabolic profile following oral dosing of aripiprazole was similar 
in children and adolescents, with dehydro-aripiprazole as the predominant circulating metabolite.  
Given  the  similar  pharmacokinetic  profile,  the  main  efficacy  study  31-03-240  investigated  the  full 
range of available doses by testing the 10 mg and 30 mg doses (see further discussion on 2.3.2.4). 
1.3.2.  Clinical efficacy 
1.3.2.1.  Main efficacy study 
Study 31-03-240 is the main efficacy study to support the indication applied for and was submitted in 
accordance with the article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation 1901/2006.

This was a multicenter, randomized, 30 week double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial 
conducted in 59 centres in the United States (US). 
Objective 
The objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of two fixed doses of aripiprazole (10 mg and 30 
mg)  compared  to  placebo  in  children  and  adolescents,  aged  10  to  17  years,  with  a  Diagnostic  and 
Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV) diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed episode with or without 
psychotic features. 
Main inclusion criteria  
Male and female subjects, 10 to 17 years of age, with a manic or mixed episode associated with bipolar 
I disorder were eligible to participate in this study.  
The main inclusion criterion was a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed episode, with 
or without psychotic features (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). The DSM-IV diagnosis was also 
independently confirmed by a separate, trained clinician administering the Kiddie Schedule for Affective 
Disorders  and  Schizophrenia  for  School  Aged  Children:  Present  and  Lifetime  Version  (K-SADS-PL) 
(Kaufman et al. 1996), which is a semi-structured interview of patients and parents/caregivers by an 
adequately  trained  clinician.  Co-morbid  diagnoses  were  permitted  including  Attention  Deficit 
Hyperactivity  Disorder  (ADHD),  Conduct  Disorder  (CD),  Oppositional  Defiant  Disorder  (ODD),  and 
anxiety  disorders  (except  Post  Traumatic  Stress  Disorder  [PTSD]  and  Obsessive  Compulsive  Disorder 
[OCD]). 
The  initial  diagnosis  was  made  by  an  adequately  trained  clinician  (ie,  board  certified  child  and 
adolescent  psychiatrist  [CAP]  or  board  eligible  CAP),  and  then  confirmed  by  an  adequately  trained 
utilizing the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children: Present and 
Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) at screening.

Treatment period 
There  were  two  phases  in  this  study,  a  4-week  acute  phase  and  a  26-week  extension  period.  Each 
subject  had  the  potential  to  participate  in  this  study  for  a  total  of  up  to  30  weeks  of  double-blind 
treatment, including a 4-week acute phase with a 6-month extension period, preceded by a screening 
phase of up to 28 days.  
Both  phases  of  the  study  could  be  conducted  either  on  an  outpatient  basis  (with  the  option  for 
inpatient hospitalization, if needed), or in a partial or full inpatient basis at any given time of the study. 
On Day 1 of the acute Phase, subjects were randomized to either 10 mg or 30 mg of oral aripiprazole 
or  placebo  treatment.  Subjects  reached  their  target  dose  through  a  forced  titration  schedule  of up  to 
13 days and proceeded with treatment at their target dose.  
If the subject reached week 4 of the acute Phase, they continued into the extension phase, a 26-week 
double-blind treatment period, beginning at the same dose as taken at the end of the acute phase. The 
investigator had the option to down-titrate a subject’s dose only one time during the extension phase 
to half the target dose for tolerability reasons. Following a dose reduction, investigators could also up-
titrate one time as needed to enhance efficacy to 20 mg from 15 mg in the 30 mg arm, and to 10 mg 
from 5 mg in the 10 mg arm. Subjects who discontinued during the acute phase for lack of efficacy, or 
for any reason, were offered an alternative rescue medication for 4 to 8 weeks. 
Subjects who received at least one dose of study medication in the extension Phase of the study were 
eligible to roll-over to an open-label study (Study No. 31-03-241) if they dropped out of this phase due 
to tolerability reasons. 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy variable is the change from baseline to week 4 in the Young Mania Rating Scale 
(YMRS) Total Score. Subjects who completed the week 4 visit were defined as completers of the acute 
phase. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Secondary  efficacy  variables  included  the  change  from  baseline  (evaluated  at  each  visit  up  to  30 
weeks)  in  the  YMRS  total  score;  the  Children’s  Global  Assessment  Scale  (CGAS)  score,  the  clinical 
Global  Impressions  Scale-Bipolar  Version  (CGI-BP)  severity  score;  the  Children’s  Depression  Rating 
Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) score, the General Behavior Inventory Scale (GBI) score; the Attention Deficit 
Hyperactivity Disorders Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV) score and Pediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and 
Satisfaction Questionnaire (P-Q-LES-Q translated into different languages when applicable). 
In addition, subject response to treatment (defined as a 50% or higher reduction from baseline in Y-
MRS  total  score);  change  from  preceding  phase  score  on  the  CGI-BP  and  P-Q-LES-Q;  time  to 
discontinuation due to all reasons were also measured as secondary efficacy variables. 
Subjects who completed the week 30 visit were defined as completers for the entire study.

Statistical method 
The  core  data  set  for  all  efficacy  analyses  was  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  dataset,  which  contains  data 
from  all  randomized  subjects.  In  order  to  handle  missing  data  and  restrictions  imposed  by  different 
types of analyses (e.g., change from baseline analysis), other data sets derived from the ITT data set 
were used for the efficacy analyses, such as the observed cases (OC) data set and the last observation 
carried forward (LOCF) datasets as described below.  
For change from baseline analysis, only subjects who had both baseline and post-baseline values were 
included  in  the  OC  and  LOCF  data  sets.  LOCF  data  sets  were  the  primary  analysis  data  sets.  The  OC 
data set corresponding to a visit consists of data from all subjects who were evaluated at that visit on 
the  efficacy  variable  under  analysis,  i.e.,  subjects  with  missing  data  due  to  dropout  or  other  reasons 
were not included in the OC data set. In the LOCF data set, missing data at a post-baseline visit were 
imputed  with  the  value  obtained  at  the  nearest  preceding  visit,  except  that  baseline  values  were  not 
carried forward to impute missing values at a post-baseline visit. 
Nominal overall significance level of 0.05 (two-tailed) was used in testing the statistical significance of 
the comparisons between aripiprazole 10 mg target dose versus placebo and aripiprazole 30 mg target 
dose  versus  placebo.  For  the  primary  treatment  comparisons  of  a  dose  group  versus  placebo, 
adjustment  in  testing  due  to  multiple  comparisons  was  handled  by  an  overall  F-test.  Descriptive 
statistics  for  the  YMRS  Total  Scores  and  change  from  baseline  scores  were  presented  by  treatment 
group  for  week  1  through  week  4  for  both  OC  and  LOCF  datasets.  The  change  scores  were  analyzed 
using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment as a factor, and baseline YMRS Total 
Score  as  a  covariate.  For  comparing  YMRS  Total  Scores  between  treatment  groups  at  Baseline,  only 
treatment  was  included  in  the  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  model  with  baseline  value  as  the 
dependent  variable.  The  least  squares  (LS)  means  obtained  from  a  type  III  analysis  using  SAS  were 
used for the treatment comparisons. Two-tailed student’s t-tests were used to test differences between 
the LS means within the ANCOVA or ANOVA model. 
The  CGAS,  CGI-BP  severity,  CDRS-R,  GBI,  ADHD-RS-IV,  and  P-QLES-Q  Total  Score  were  analyzed 
similarly  to  the  YMRS.  The  proportion  of  subjects  responding  to  treatment  was  analyzed  using  a  chi-
square  test,  with  95%  confidence  intervals  for  differences  in  response  rates.  Changes  from  the 
preceding  phase  score  in  the  CGI-BP  and  P-QLES-Q  overall  score  were  analyzed  using  the  Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel  row  mean  score  statistic  by  week.  Time  to  discontinuation  was  analyzed  by  plotting 
the Kaplan-Meier curves and testing for significance of the differences in survival curves using the log-
rank test for each active group versus the placebo group.  
Sample size 
The study is designed to have 85% power given a difference between aripiprazole and placebo of -5.1 
for  the  change  from  baseline  in  Y-MRS  total  Score  at  week  4  (LOCF).  The  difference  of  -5.1  was 
estimated from two bipolar mania trials in adult populations. A pooled standard deviation of 11.1 was 
used  in  these  computations.  Based  on  these  estimates  and  using  a  two-sided  alpha  of  0.025,  87 
patients per treatment arm with a total 261 patients are required for 85% power. An evaluable patient 
is  defined  as  one  having  a  baseline  and  a  post-baseline  value  of  Y-MRS  total  assessment.  Maximum 
300 patients were to be enrolled for screening to maintain the power of the study.

All  randomized  subjects  were  included  in  the  efficacy  analyses  (randomized  subjects  evaluated  for  at 
least one primary or secondary efficacy parameter). 
A high rate of retention (237/296 [80.1%] subjects overall) was observed for the acute phase of the 
study:  84/98  (85.7%)  in  the  aripiprazole  10  mg  arm,  77/99  (77.8%)  in  the  aripiprazole  30  mg  arm, 
and 76/99 (76.8%) in the placebo arm. 
A total of 68/296 (23.0%) subjects completed the entire study: 34/98 (34.7%) in the aripiprazole 10 
mg arm, 22/99 (22.2%) in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and 12/99 (12.1%) in the placebo arm.

1.3.2.2.  Supportive study 
Study  31-03-241  was  submitted  in  the  context  of  the  approved  variation  extending  the  indication  to 
the  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in  adolescents  15  years  and  older  (EMA/H/C/471/II/48).  It  was 
designed  to  provide  additional  long  term  safety  data  of  aripiprazole  in  the  paediatric  population. 
Patients who had completed study 31-03-239 (adolescents with schizophrenia) or had withdrawn from 
the  double  blind  study  31-03-240  were  offered  to  continue  in  the  open-label,  flexible-dose  study  31-
03-241 for an additional 26 weeks.  
The  results  obtained  in  these  two  different  patient  populations  were  evaluated  separately.  For  the 
purpose of the present application, only relevant methodological aspects and efficacy results obtained 
in the population of adolescents and children with bipolar I disorder who had withdrawn from study 31-
03-240 are presented.  
METHODS 
Treatment period 
Subjects  enrolled  in  the  study  were  eligible  to  receive  up  to  a  total  of  6  months  (cumulative  with 
exposure  in  the  parent  study)  of  open-label  aripiprazole  treatment  at  daily  doses  of  2  mg  to  30  mg. 
The  open-label  trial  overlapped  with  the  parent  study  31-03-240  for  1  day.  The  End  of  Treatment 
evaluations conducted at the last office visit of the parent study served as Baseline (Day 0) evaluation 
for this open-label trial.

On Day 0 of open-label treatment in Study 31-03-241, patients from all treatment groups of the parent 
study  31-03-240  received  an  up-titration  blister  card  for  treatment  Days  1  through  6.  Up-titration  to 
the target dose of 10 mg was done in the following manner for all patients: Days 1 and 2: 2 mg/day; 
Days 3 and 4: 5 mg/day; Days 5 and 6: 10 mg/day. If the subject was unable to tolerate the titration 
during  this  fixed  up-titration  phase,  the  subject  was  withdrawn  from  the  study.  On  Day  7,  the 
investigator  had  the  option  to  continue  the  dose  escalation  up  to  a  maximum  of  30  mg/day,  or,  for 
tolerability issues, to reduce the dose of aripiprazole to no less than 2 mg/day for subjects with bipolar 
I  disorder.  To  escalate  the  dose,  subjects  received  15  mg  for  a  minimum  of  2  days,  20  mg  for  a 
minimum of 2 days, 25 mg for a minimum of 2 days, and then 30 mg for 2 days as the highest dose. 
Dose  escalation  could  stop  at  any  dose  level  that  the  investigator  felt  was  tolerable  for  the  subject. 
Dose reduction, if necessary based on clinical judgment in regard to tolerability, occurred at a rate that 
was  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  appropriate  for  the  subject.  Following  the  initial  dose 
reduction, the investigator could escalate the subject’s dose again based on clinical judgment at a rate 
that  was  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  appropriate  for  the  subject.  Once  a  subject’s  dose  had 
been escalated following the initial dose reduction, no further dose reductions were permitted. Failure 
to tolerate the medication after dose reduction to the minimal allowable dose level, or to the escalated 
dose level afterwards, resulted in removal of the subject from the study. 
The open-label safety study was conducted on an outpatient basis with clinic visits at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 
8, 12, 18, and 26.  
Efficacy endpoints 
The  efficacy  variables  for  subjects  with  bipolar  I  disorder  (manic  or  mixed  episode  with  or  without 
psychotic features) were: mean change from Baseline on the YMRS score; the CGI-BP severity score;  
the GBI score and the ADHD-RS-IV score.  
Other  outcome  variable  included  the  P-QLES-Q  Total  score  (translated  into  different  languages  when 
applicable). PL-QLES-Q was completed by each subject at Baseline (Day 0) and End of Treatment/Early 
Termination (week 26). 
RESULTS 
A  total  of  86  child  and  adolescent  subjects  with  bipolar  I  disorder  from  the  parent  study  31  03  240 
were enrolled receiving an average daily dose of aripiprazole of 15.1 mg (range 4.9 – 17.7 mg). 
All 86 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. A total of 57 patients completed the study (see 
Table 8).

1.3.2.3.  Ancillary analyses 
At the CHMP request, comparative data up to 12 weeks were provided by the MAH to further support 
the maintenance of the effect. The MAH presented these data for lower and higher age groups (10-12 
and 13-17 years old) since the MAH proposed to revise the indication applied for from 10-17 years old 
to  13-17  years  old  due  to  the  CHMP  concerns  over  the  safety  profile  in  the  younger  population  (see 
2.3.3). 
In addition, subgroup analyses were also provided to evaluate the efficacy in patients with or without 
comorbidities  including  the  effect  on  symptoms  specific  to  mania  in  these  population  subgroups. 
Patients  characteristics  from  2  publications  were  presented  to  address  the  CHMP  concern  over  the 
generalisibility of the pivotal study results (31-03-240) to the EU population since it included only US 
patients. 
Maintenance of the effect

At  week  12,  approximately  half  of  the  subjects  receiving  aripiprazole  remained  in  the  double-blind 
study, compared with about one quarter of subjects receiving placebo. Of the 77 subjects on placebo 
who left the double-blind study by week 12, over half of them (n = 42, 54.5%) left because of lack of 
efficacy. In contrast, of the 103 subjects receiving aripiprazole who discontinued by week 12, only 23 
(22.3%) left because of lack of efficacy. 
Efficacy in patients with or without comorbidities 
The  analysed  subgroups  (patients  with  or  without  any  psychiatric  comorbidity,  with  or  without  ODD, 
with  or  without  ADHD)  were  of  small  sizes  to  provide  a  robust  statistical  analysis.  Results  indicated 
that the presence of any psychiatric comorbidity did not seem to influence the YMRS changes at weeks 
4 and 12 (see Figure 3), this being less evident with patients with or without ADHD at both week 4 and 
12  for  the  30  mg  dose.  According  to  the  MAH,  the  smaller  effect  observed  in  patients  without  ADHD 
versus patients with ADHD could be explained by a stronger placebo response obtained in the patients 
without  ADHD  as  compared  to  patients  with  ADHD.  To  further  address  this  point,  a  new  subgroup 
analysis  was  performed  by  the  MAH  including  “ongoing  ADHD”  instead  of  “ADHD”  with  the  aim  of 
evaluating whether this would lead to an effect on the total YMRS (see Tables 14-17, Figure 4).

1.3.2.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal 31-03-240 study had a single primary efficacy endpoint in acute phase: the mean change 
from  baseline  to  week  4  in  the  YMRS  total  score.  Bipolar  disorders  in  children  and  adolescents  are 
being  increasingly  reported  and  the  need  for  adequate  diagnosis  and  treatment  is  important, 
particularly  since  most  prescribed  treatments  are  based  in  small  studies  and  there  is  a  lack  of 
authorised  treatment  for  this  disorder.  The  MAH  developed  a  training  and  certification  program 
ensuring that it would be rigorously applied. For a rater to be considered certified on the YMRS, they 
were first prequalified using a rater experience survey and then were required to successfully complete 
the  didactic  training  and  certification  process.  All  raters  were  required  to  demonstrate  inter-rater 
reliability  before  rating  subjects  in  this  trial.  Furthermore,  two  “recalibration”  ratings  had  to  be 
performed at 6- and 12- month intervals after initial rater certification.  
YMRS total score has been considered as a valid instrument to assess bipolar disorders and has been 
used in clinical practice since its development in 1978, including paediatric population (J Am Acad Child 
Adolesc Psychiatry. 2002 Nov;41(11):1350-9. Discriminative validity of a parent version of the Young 
Assessment Report

Mania Rating Scale. Gracious BL, Youngstrom EA, Findling RL, Calabrese JR.). A definition of clinically 
significant  mean  value  difference  of  YMRS  total  score  has  not been  pre-specified  in  the study  design. 
Only responder definition was settled a priori and this was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The study was conducted in 59 centres in the US. Demographic characteristics of the population may 
be significantly different from European population, both physical, psychological and cultural. Given the 
difference of opinion between the US and the EU about the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder 
in children and adolescents, and the discrepancies reported in the literature in terms of disease on-set 
between  US  and  EU  bipolar  I  patient  populations,  the  validity  of  extrapolating  the  results  of  the  US-
based  studies  to  the  EU  population  was  questioned  by  the  CHMP.  Data  on  2  EU  studies  conducted  in 
Spain  and  Italy  in  patients  with  Bipolar  I  disorder  however  showed  similar  patients  characteristics 
regarding severity of illness and age of onset (see Table 18). Differences were noted on the presence 
of any psychiatric comorbidity with even lower rates of comorbidities in the US patients, although the 
ADHD  diagnosis  was  more  frequently  observed  in  study  31-03-240  with  51.7%  versus  21.1%  and 
37.8%, respectively, in Spain and Italy. Bipolar I disorder population is more prone to  co-morbidities 
than  schizophrenic  population,  and  overall  the  CHMP  considered  that  these  data  were  sufficiently 
supporting the extrapolation of study 31-03-240 to the intended European population. 
The  study  was  a  double blind  placebo  controlled  consisting  of an  acute  4  week  phase  and  a  26  week 
maintenance  phase.  The  duration  of  the  study  was  therefore  longer  than  the  recommended  12  week 
maintenance  trial  as  referred  in  the  “Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Clinical  Investigation  of  Medicinal 
Products in the Treatment of Bipolar Disorder”, (CPMP/EWP/567/98).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the acute phase, treatment with aripiprazole resulted in statistically significant improvements (LOCF) 
compared with placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint YMRS Total Score at week 4  in both 10 mg (  -
5.99, CI:-8.49;-3.50, p<0.0001) and 30 mg (-8.26, CI:-10.7;-5.77, p<0.0001).  
This  efficacy  was  maintained  through  week  30  showing  a  statistically  significant  sustained 
improvement  over  placebo  in  both  10  mg  (-5.89,  CI:-8.70;-3.08,  p<0.0001)  and  30  mg  (-6.73,  CI:-
9.53;-3.94, p<0.0001). Mean changes in YMRS Total Scores at week 30 using LOCF data were −14.1 
in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm, −14.9 in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and −8.2 in the placebo arm.  
Significant  improvements  were  also  documented  for  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoints:  CGAS,  CGI-BP 
Severity  Score  for  mania  and  for  overall  bipolar  illness,  GBI  Total  Score  for  mania  and  for  the  ADHD 
rating scale. For efficacy endpoints evaluating the effect of treatment on depressive symptoms (CGI-BP 
Severity  Score  for  depression,  GBI  Total  Score  for  depression  and  CDRS)  no  statistically  significant 
superiority of aripiprazole over placebo treatment was observed.  
Both  the  aripiprazole  10  mg  and  30  mg  arms  had  significantly  higher  percentages  of  responders 
compared  to  the  placebo  arm  at  every  treatment  week  during  both  at  week  4  and  and  at  week  30 
using the LOCF data set, thus showing maintenance of the effect of treatment. At week 4, percentages 
of  responders  were  44.79  %  and  63.64%  for  10  and  30  mg  group  as  compared  to  26.09%  for  the 
placebo  group.  At  week  30,  percentages  of  responders  were  around  50%  and  55.56%  for  10  and  30 
mg group as compared to 26.6% for the placebo group 
In study 31-03-240, the placebo effect was always high and particularly significant in the acute phase, 
but it did not reduce with time in the double blind extension phase. In addition, the number of patients 
who  completed  the  26  week  extension  phase  was  low:  34,  22  and  12  patients  respectively  in  the 
Assessment Report 
EMA/62007/2013 
Page 25/57 
 
 
 
 
 
10 mg  ,  30  mg  doses  of  aripiprazole  and  placebo  groups.  During  the  oral  explanation,  the  MAH 
presented further analysis of the drop out rates showing that  discontinuation with aripiprazole 10 mg 
due to lack of efficacy or lack of tolerability was low [at week 4: 2 (3%); at week 12: 11 (16.7%)] and 
more  frequent  with  placebo  [at  week  4:  4  (6.7%);  at  week  12:  26  (43%)].  Among  the  drop  outs 
occurring between week 4 and week 12, half of the patients treated with aripiprazole 10 mg went into 
the  open  label  study  and  all  of  them  were  completers  at  week  12  as  compared  to  70%  of  patients 
treated  with  placebo  and  85.7%  of  them  were  completers  at  week  12.  It  was  also  noted  that 
discontinuation rates were of similar magnitude of studies conducted in adults with Bipolar I disorder. 
An  analysis  of  the  time  to  discontinuation  due  to  all  reasons  revealed  that  statistically  significant 
differences  were  noted  between  both  the  aripiprazole  10  mg  arm  versus  placebo  (p  <  0.0001)  and 
30 mg  arm  versus  placebo  (p  =  0.0124).  For  both  aripiprazole  doses,  the  proportions  of  subjects 
remaining in the study (as measured by the Kaplan-Meier curve) were superior to that of placebo. The 
median times that subjects remained in the study  were 109 days for the aripiprazole 10 mg arm, 66 
days  for  the  aripiprazole  30  mg  arm,  and  37  days  for  the  placebo  arm.  With  regard  to  time  to 
discontinuation  for  all  reasons,  both  aripiprazole  doses  showed  statistically  significantly  superior 
retention  profiles  over  the  30-week  study  (in  Kaplan-Meier  curves),  i.e.,  proportions  of  subjects 
remaining in the study at different time points, compared to placebo. 
At the CHMP request, subgroup analyses on efficacy for patients aged 13-14 years versus 15-17 years 
were performed as the proposed choice to restrict the age to 13-17 years due to safety concerns (see 
2.3.3) was not based on clinical milestones. However, these data did not show any differences on the 
positive trends of improvement on YRMS and CGI-BP scores. The CHMP also acknowledged that further 
interpretation of such analysis is limited in the absence of statistical power. 
Efficacy in patients with and without comorbidities 
Following  the  CHMP  concern  over  the  patient  population  included  in  the  study  31-03-240  (mixing 
Bipolar  I  disorder  with  other  comorbidity  conditions),  a  number  of  post-hoc  analyses  were  performed 
by the MAH. Results showed that the population without comorbid disorders did not differ significantly 
in  mean  change  of  YMRS  in  both  10  mg  aripiprazole  and  placebo  by  week  4  thus  questioning  as  to 
whether  aripiprazole  may  act  mainly  in  symptoms  common  to  ADHD  /  ODD  and  not  specifically  on 
Bipolar  Disorder  type  I.  Additional  subgroup  analyses  however  indicated  that  the  presence  of  any 
comorbidity  did  not  seem  to  influence  the  YMRS  changes  at  weeks  4  and  12,  this  was  being  less 
evident with patients with or without ADHD at both weeks 4 and 12 for the 30 mg dose.  
In  a  further  subgroup  analysis  of  patients  with  or  without  ADHD,  the  CHMP  noted  that  the  selected 
patients  included  “ongoing  ADHD”  instead  of  “ADHD”  with  the  aim  of  evaluating  whether  this  would 
lead to an effect on the total YMRS. Only “current comorbid ADHD” were selected: subjects with either 
a  current  diagnosis  of  ADHD  or  who  discontinued  medication  for  ADHD  in  the  run-in  phase  were 
included in this definition. Previous ADHD comorbidity definition relied on the post hoc analysis of the 
Kiddie Schedule for Affective disorders, and had “unknown” values for 59 subjects. This new “current 
ADHD”  definition  was  considered  more  inclusive  by  the  CHMP  and  may  therefore  better  reflect  real 
ADHD  comorbidity  in  this  population.  Almost  half  of  patients  with  ADHD  were  included  in  the  10-12 
years  old  group.  Nevertheless,  the  effect  of  ADHD  in  the  13-17  years  old  group  was  still  significant, 
with  a  difference  of  >2  points  improvement  (as  compared  to  baseline)  in  the  YMRS  total  score  in 
patients with ADHD versus no ADHD, but placebo had also more pronounced improvement in the older 
patients  (see  Table  15).  The  trend  towards  better  reduction  of  YMRS  total  score  was  present  in  all 
treatment groups and age ranges, despite the small sample in the subgroup analysis, both at 4 and 12 
Assessment Report

weeks. The  CHMP further noted a very clear placebo effect increasing with age, both at  weeks 4 and 
week  12,  and  the  difference  in  response  to  placebo  between  ADHD  and  no  ADHD  patients  was  kept 
constant  in  the  3  different  age  groups  (10-12,  13-14  and  15-17,  Table  16).  Therefore,  the  CHMP 
concluded that 15-17 age group had clearly a more pronounced placebo effect, rendering aripiprazole 
treatment effect less evident. 
During the oral explanation, the MAH presented the data for the 10 mg dose showing same directional 
improvements  on  the  YRMS  score  at  weeks  4  and  12  (Figure  3)  in  patients  with  or  without  any 
comorbidities  and  the  subgroup  analysis  showing  that  ADHD  status  did  not  change  the  10  mg 
treatment effect significantly, particularly at week 12, where the use of ADHD medication was already 
permitted  and  favoured  aripiprazole  effect  independently  the  presence  of  ADHD  or  ADHD  medication 
(Figure 4). 
Maintenance of the effect 
At  week  12,  53%  and  42%  of  patients  treated  respectively  with  aripiprazole  10  mg  and  30  mg  were 
still receiving treatment. Mean changes in YMRS score in placebo, 10 mg and 30 mg were respectively 
-8.2, -15.7 and -16.5. 
When compared to the placebo at week 12, the efficacy was maintained with a statistically significant 
differences  over  the  placebo  for  both  10  mg  and  30  mg    on  the  YRMS  score  total  score  and  in  both 
analysed  age  groups.  In  the  10-12  years  old  group,  mean  changes  in  YMRS  Total Scores  at  week  12 
using LOCF data were: −16.2 in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm, −15.9 in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and 
−6.9  in  the  placebo  arm  using  LOCF  data  (for  both  doses,  p<0.05).  In  the  13-17  years  old  group, 
mean  changes  in  YMRS  Total  Scores  at  week  12  using  LOCF  data  were:  −15.6  in  the  aripiprazole  10 
mg arm, −16.8 in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and −9.7 in the placebo arm using LOCF data (for 10 
mg:  p<0.05,  for  30  mg:  p<0.001).  Similar  findings  were  obtained  for  the  secondary  endpoints  using 
LOCF  data.  However,  the  OC  analysis  failed  to  show  statistical  significant  over  the  placebo  for  both 
doses  on  all  analysed  efficacy  endpoints  for  both  age  groups.  Considering  the  number  of 
discontinuation  (77/99  patients),  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  OC  analysis  did  not  provide  any 
relevant findings apart that a significant percentage of patients did improve spontaneously by week 12, 
suggesting that the treatment should not be prolong longer than 12 weeks. The CHMP was therefore of 
the  opinion  that  the  efficacy  was  demonstrated  up  to  12  weeks  only  and  the  treatment  should  be 
therefore limited to this duration.  
Having considered the written responses and oral explanation given by the MAH, the CHMP considered 
that  the  presented  efficacy  data  were  sufficiently  supportive  of  an  efficacy  of  aripiprazole  on  manic 
episodes in the paediatric Bipolar I disorder population. 
Dosing recommendation 
The  MAH  initially  proposed  to  recommend  10  mg  /day  as  aripiprazole  dose  for  the  treatment  of 
paediatric subjects 10 to 17 years of age with bipolar I disorder. Treatment initiation was proposed to 
start at 2 mg titrated to 5 mg after 2 days and to the target dose of 10 mg after two additional days. 
When  appropriate,  subsequent  dose  increases  should  be  administered  in  5  mg  increments.  The 
maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg. Since 5 mg had been tested in schizophrenia and 10 
mg were the lowest efficacious dose in adults, this was the lowest dose chosen. For the highest range 
the MAH choose the highest tolerated dose in trials CN138-014 and 31-03-238.

However, the CHMP considered that enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 10 mg has 
not been demonstrated when comparing results from the 10 mg and 30 mg groups (See Tables 5 and 
6).  In  addition,  taking  into  consideration  the  safety  profile  in  this  paediatric  population,  (see  section 
2.3.3), the use of the 30  mg dose was not recommended by the CHMP, and an increase over 10  mg 
should  only  be  performed  under  strict  surveillance.  The  CHMP  recommended  the  following  SmPC 
information regarding the posology in the paediatric Bipolar I disorder population:

for ABILIFY is 10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment 
should be initiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for 
2 additional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. 
The treatment duration should be the minimum necessary for symptom control and must not exceed 
12 weeks. Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, 
and a daily dose of 30 mg is associated with a substantially higher incidence of significant undesirable 
effects including EPS related events, somnolence, fatigue and weight gain (see section 4.8). Doses 
higher than 10 mg/day should therefore only be used in exceptional cases and with close clinical 
monitoring (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). 
Younger patients are at increased risk of experiencing adverse events associated with aripiprazole. 
Therefore, ABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients below 13 years of age (see sections 4.8 
and 5.1).” 
1.3.3.  Clinical safety 
The  safety  of  aripiprazole  in  the  treatment  of  bipolar  I  disorder  in  children  and  adolescents  was 
evaluated in the two clinical studies that were already discussed in clinical efficacy: Study 31-03-240 
and  Study  31-03-241.  No  pooling  with  other  clinical  trials  regarding  children  and  adolescents  with 
bipolar disorder was performed and the safety data presented below relates to both study 31-03-240 
and 31-03-241. 
1.3.3.1.  Patient exposure 
A total of 296 subjects with bipolar I disorder were enrolled in Study 31-03-240. Thereof, 86 subjects 
rolled  over  to  the  open-label  Study  31-03-241.  The  total  number  of  children  and  adolescents  with 
bipolar I disorder exposed to aripiprazole in Study 31-03-240 and 31-03-241 was 233. 
Of the 296 subjects randomized, a total of 197 subjects were exposed to aripiprazole: 98 in the 10 mg 
arm, with an average dose of 8.6 mg overall (8.3 mg in the acute Phase and 9.3 mg in the extension 
phase), and 99 in the 30 mg arm, with an average dose of 22.1 mg (19.5 in the acute phase and 27.5 
in  the  extension  phase).  A  total  of  99  subjects  were  randomized  to  placebo  (2  subjects  from  the 
placebo  arm  did  not  receive  study  drug).  The  percentages  of  subjects  exposed  to  study  medication 
beyond the planned 26-week double blind extension phase treatment period were 14.3%, 10.2%, and 
5.1% in the aripiprazole 10 mg and 30 mg and the placebo arm, respectively.

1.3.3.2.  Adverse events 
Study 31-03-240 
During  the  entire  study  period,  a  total  of  376  TEAEs  were  experienced  by  78/98  (79.6%)  subjects  in 
the  aripiprazole  10  mg  arm;  366  TEAEs  were  experienced  by  84/99  (84.8%)  subjects  in  the 
aripiprazole 30  mg  arm;  and  164  TEAEs  were  experienced  by  64/97  (66.0%)  subjects  in  the  placebo 
arm. 
The  most  common  TEAEs  reported  at  an  incidence  rate  of  ≥  5%  in  the  aripiprazole  10  mg  arm  were 
somnolence  (24.5%),  headache  (20.4%),  fatigue  (18.4%),  nausea  (13.3%),  vomiting  (13.3%), 
extrapyramidal disorder (12.2%), vision blurred (10.2%), nasal congestion (10.2%), upper abdominal 
pain (9.2%), akathisia (9.2%), increased weight (8.2%), increased appetite (8.2%), upper respiratory 
tract  infection  (8.2%),  decreased  appetite  (7.1%),  nasopharyngitis  (7.1%),  cough  (7.1%),  dizziness 
(7.1%), 
insomnia  (6.1%),  back  pain  (5.1%),  anxiety  (5.1%),  dysmenorrhea  (5.1%),  and 
pharyngolaryngeal pain (5.1%).  
The  most  common  TEAEs  reported  at  an  incidence  rate  of  ≥  5%  in  the  aripiprazole  30  mg  arm  were 
extrapyramidal disorder (28.3%), somnolence (27.3%), headache (23.2%), nausea (14.1%), akathisia 
(13.1%), fatigue (12.1%), vomiting (8.1%), vision blurred (8.1%), increased appetite (8.1%), salivary 
hypersecretion  (8.1%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (6.1%),  stomach  discomfort  (6.1%),  bipolar 
disorder (6.1%), upper abdominal pain (5.1%), increased weight (5.1%), dizziness (5.1%), diarrhoea 
(5.1%),  and  dystonia  (5.1%).  In  the  placebo  arm  during  the  entire  study,  the  most  common  TEAEs 
were headache (18.6%), vomiting (9.3%), bipolar disorder (5.2%), and nausea (5.2%).  
From the acute phase to the extension phase there did not appear to be any unexpected increases in 
the incidence of the most common TEAEs associated with aripiprazole. 
Following CHMP concerns over the safety profile in Bipolar I disorder paediatric patients (younger than 
the authorised paediatric indication for schizophrenia), the MAH presented a comparison of the safety 
profile  for  10-12  years  and  13-17  years  to  support  their  proposal  to  revise  the  indication  applied  for 
from 10-17 years to 13-17 years.  Overall AE profile is presented in Table 17. Other safety subgroup 
analyses (10-12 years versus 13-17 years) are presented under the relevant sections together with the 
other  additional  safety  data  requested  by  the  CHMP  comparing  13-14  years  to  15-17  years  (see  EPS 
related symptoms, weight gain related events).

Extrapyramidal Syndrome (EPS) related symptoms  
The  overall  incidence  of  any  extrapyramidal  event  was  25.8%  (51/197  subjects)  in  the  combined 
aripiprazole group (10 mg and 30 mg) and 5.1% (5/97 subjects) in the placebo group during the acute 
phase.  The  most  commonly  reported  EPS-related  symptoms  were  Parkinsonism  events  (21.8%  and 
4.1%  in  the  aripiprazole  and  placebo  groups,  respectively,  during  the  acute  phase).  Akathisia  events 
occurred in 10.1% (20/197 subjects) of the combined aripiprazole group and 2.0% (2/97 subjects) of 
the placebo group during the acute phase. There was no notable increase in akathisia events following 
the  acute  phase  (up  to  week  30).  Over  the  entire  study  period,  the  incidence  of  any  extrapyramidal 
events (excluding akathisia) was 36.3% (36/99 subjects) in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, 20.4% (20/98 
subjects) in the 10 mg arm, and 5.1% (3/97 subjects) in the placebo arm. 
In  study  31-03-240,  the  overall  rate  of  EPS  symptoms  (including  akathisia)  was  34.5  %,  salivary 
hypersecretion and drooling were observed in 6% of the subjects. 
EPS-SAS  (SAS:  Simpson  Angus  Scale)  and  EPS-AIMS  (AIM:Abnormal  Involuntary  Movement  Scale 
Scale) mean changes are presented for 10-12 years and 13-17 years groups in Tables 22 and 23.

When comparing 13-14 and 15-17 age groups, akathisia was the most significant AE:  4 patients in the 
13-14 years old group (but all resolved by week 12) and 4 patients in the 15-17 years old group (one 
led to discontinuation).  Dystonia was not reported in the 13-14 years old group, while there was one 
case in the 15-17 years old group. There were 2 patients experiencing Parkinsonian symptoms in the 
13-14 year old group, one led to drug discontinuation and another resolved by week 12; in the 15-17 
years old group there were 4 reports of Parkinsonism, both resolved by week 12. 
Seizures related events 
One subject experienced a grand mal convulsion in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm during the acute phase. 
No other TEAEs related to seizures occurred.  
Suicide related events 
Two subjects experienced suicidal ideation, 1/98 (1%) in the aripiprazole 10 mg and 1/99 (1%) in the 
30 mg arm in the acute phase of the study.  
Intentional self-injury related events 
Intentional  self-injury  was  reported  in  2/98  (2.0%)  in  the  aripiprazole  10  mg  arm, in  1/99  (1.0%)  in 
the  30  mg  arm,  and  in  1/97  (1.0%)  in  the  placebo  arm  during  the  acute  phase.  Self  mutilation  was 
reported in 1/98 (1%) in the aripiprazole 10 mg and 1/99 (1%) in the 30 mg arm.  
Weigth gain related events 
There were no significant differences in weight change between aripiprazole and placebo in the end of 
the acute phase (at week 4).  
The  mean  changes  in  weight  at  week  4  were  0.82,  1.08,  and  0.56  kg  for  the  aripiprazole  10  mg,  30 
mg,  and  placebo  arms,  respectively  (p  =  0.3488  and  p  =  0.1276  for  the  10  mg  and  30  mg  arms, 
respectively, versus  placebo).  Mean  changes  from  baseline in  weight  were  significantly  greater  in  the 
aripiprazole 10 mg and 30 mg arms versus placebo at week 12 through week 30 and at the last visit. 
The mean changes in weight at the end of the study (Last Visit) were 3.20, 2.85, and 0.98 kg for the 
aripiprazole 10 mg, 30 mg, and placebo arms, respectively (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.0019 for the 10 mg 
and 30 mg arms, respectively, versus placebo).  
The  percentages  of  subjects  who  experienced  a  potentially  clinically  significant  weight  gain  (≥  7% 
weight gain compared to baseline) at their Last Visit were 35.8% (34/95 subjects) in the aripiprazole 
10 mg arm, 29.2% (28/96 subjects) in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and 9.8% (9/92 subjects) in the 
placebo  arm.  The  differences  from  placebo  in  the  incidence  of  potentially  clinically  significant  weight 
gain were statistically significant at the Last Visit for both the aripiprazole 10 mg arm and 30 mg arm 
(p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0009, respectively), at week 30 for the 10 mg arm (p=0.0487), and at week 16 
for the 30 mg arm (p = 0.0337). 
At  baseline  25.5%,  25.3%,  and  21.6%  in  the  aripiprazole  10  mg  arm,  aripiprazole  30  mg  arm,  and 
placebo  arm,  respectively,  had  a  weight  z  -score  ≥  95th  percentile.  This  proportion  of  subjects 
increased  to  27.4%,  29.2%,  and  22.8%  in  the  aripiprazole  10  mg  arm,  aripiprazole  30  mg  arm,  and 
placebo  arm,  respectively,  at  the  Last  Visit.  It  was  noted  that  a  few  subjects  had  shifts  in  weight  z-
scores from normal at baseline to abnormal at the last visit: 4 subjects in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm, 
5 subjects in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and 2 subjects in the placebo arm. 
Mean weight and BMI changes are presented for 10-12 years and 13-17 years groups in Tables 24 and

When comparing 13-14 and 15-17 age groups, mean weight changes were significant with aripiprazole 
10 mg in both age groups by week 12. In the OC analysis, increase weight of 2.7 Kg (placebo: 1.4 Kg) 
by week 12 in the 13-14 years old group versus 2.5 Kg (placebo 1.1 Kg) in the 15-17 years old group. 
Similar results were obtained using LOCF analysis. BMI index followed the same pattern. 
Study 31-03-241. 
A total of 214 TEAEs were experienced by 65/86 (75.6%) of subjects with bipolar I disorder in Study 
31-03-241.  The  majority  of  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  6/86  (7.0%)  of  subjects 
experienced SAEs.  
The most commonly reported TEAEs by 5 % or greater incidence included: diarrhoea (5.8%), nausea 
(10.5%),  Irritability  (5.8%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (8.1%),  weight  increased  (7.0%), 
akathisia  (8.1%),  dizziness  (7.0%),  headache  (16.3%),  somnolence  (10.5%),  nasal  congestion

Extrapyramidal Syndrome (EPS) related symptoms  
Parkinsonism were reported for 6/86 (6.9%) children and adolescents with bipolar I disorder in Study 
31-03-241.  Akathisia  were  reported  for  7/86  subjects  (8.1%).  The  majority  of  EPS-related  AEs  were 
mild to moderate in severity. None of the EPS-related AEs led to discontinuation. On subject reported 
dystona (1.1%). 
Seizures related events 
No seizures were reported in study 31-03-241. 
Suicide related events 
No cases of suicide ideation were reported in study 31-03-241 for subjects with bipolar I disorder. 
Intentional self injury related events 
In two out of eighty-six  subjects (2.3%),  intentional self-injury was reported as TEAE. 
Weigth gain related events 
At the Last Visit, the percentage of subjects who experienced a potentially clinically significant weight 
gain (≥ 7% compared to baseline) was 36/86 (44.2%). 
Somnolence related events 
At  week  12,  the  incidence  of  somnolence  was  20.0%  and  34.1%  in  subjects  13-14  and  15-17  years, 
respectively,  after  treatment  with  aripiprazole  10  mg,  compared  to  an  incidence  of  6.5%  and  3.7%, 
respectively,  after  treatment  with  placebo.  Sedation  was  not  reported  for  any  of  the  patients  treated 
with aripiprazole 10 mg or placebo in subjects 13-14 and 15-17 years of age. 
1.3.3.3.  Serious adverse events and deaths 
No deaths were reported in studies 31-03-240 and 31-03-241.  
Study 31-03-240 
A total of 18/294 (6.1%) subjects with Bipolar I disorder experienced SAEs. 
The  most  commonly  reported  SAEs  during  the  entire  study  were  bipolar  disorder  (9/294  subjects; 
3.1%  overall)  and  bipolar  I  disorder  (3/294  subjects,  1.0%  overall).  During  the  acute  phase,  bipolar 
disorder was reported as serious in 2 subjects (2.0%) of the aripiprazole 30 mg arm and in 4 subjects 
(4.1%) of the placebo arm. An additional 3 subjects in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm (for a total 5.1% in 
that group for the entire study) had SAEs of bipolar disorder after week 4. An SAE of bipolar I disorder 
was  also  reported  in  2  subjects  in  the  aripiprazole  30  mg  arm  after  week  4,  and  1  subject  in  the 
placebo arm during the acute Phase. 
Other  SAEs  reported  during  the  acute  phase  were  fatigue  (1  subject  in  the  10  mg  arm),  accidental 
overdose (1 subject in the 10 mg arm), grand mal convulsion (1 subject in the 10 mg arm), aggression 
(2 subjects in the 10 mg arm), oppositional defiant disorder (1 subject in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm), 
suicidal  ideation  (1  subject  in  the  10  mg  arm),  and  respiratory  arrest  (1  subject  in  the  10  mg  arm). 
Additional SAEs that were reported after week 4 were:  increased libido (1 subject in the 30 mg arm) 
and mania (1 subject in the placebo arm). 
Overall,  6  subjects  experienced  SAEs  resulting  in  discontinuation  of  study  medication:  in  the 
aripiprazole  10  mg  arm,  1  subject  was  discontinued  due  to  suicidal  ideation,  and  1  subject  was 
discontinued  due  to  aggression  and  fatigue;  in  the  aripiprazole  30  mg  arm,  3  subjects  were 
discontinued due to bipolar disorder; and in the placebo arm, 1 subject was discontinued due to bipolar 
I disorder.

No  relevant  differences  on  the  SAE  profile  were  observed  between  the  age  groups  of  10-12  years 
versus 13-17 years. 
Study 31-03-241 
A total of 6/86 (7.0%) patients experienced SAEs. The majority of these SAEs were severe in intensity. 
The  following  SAEs  were  reported:  aggression  (n=2),  bipolar  disorder  (n=3),  depression  (n=1),  and 
intentional self-injury (n=1). 
1.3.3.4.  Laboratory, Vital and Physical findings 
Although, CPK elevation was identified as potential significant laboratory changes, no clinically relevant 
changes were noted in enzyme or serum chemistry elevations or changes in hematology parameters.  
In  study  31-03-240,  one  of  98  (1.0%)  subjects  in  the  aripiprazole  10  mg  arm  showed  glycolysated 
haemoglobin  increased  during  the  acute  phase.  None  was  reported  in  study  31-03-241.  However, 
significant changes in prolactin levels were observed and further details are provided below. 
No  clinically  meaningful  changes  in  mean  QT  or  QTc  intervals,  or  other  ECG  abnormalities,  were 
observed.  In  study  31-03-241,  an  ECG  abnormality  (abnormal  ECG)  was  reported  as  TEAE  in  one 
subject. This TEAE was not an SAE nor did it result in a discontinuation of study medication. 
In  both  studies,  pyrexia  was  reported:  3  subjects  in  the  aripiprazole  10  mg  and  4  subjects  in  the  30 
mg  arm  in  study  31-03-240  and  4/86  (437%)  subjects  in  study  31-03-241.  In  addition  significant 
orthostatic  changes  were  noted.  These  were  defined  as  a  decrease  of  at  least  20  mmHg  in  systolic 
blood  pressure  accompanied  by  an  increase  in  heart  rate  of  at  least  25  bpm  when  changing  from  a 
supine to a standing position: 2 subjects in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm and 2 subjects in the placebo 
arm,  corresponding  to  an  incidence  2.1%,  0.0%,  and  2.1%  in  the  aripiprazole  10  mg  arm,  the 
aripiprazole  30  mg  arm,  and  the  placebo  arm,  respectively  in  study  31-03-240  and  5/86  (5.8%) 
subjects in study 31-03-241. 
Prolactin levels 
Study 31-03-240 
Mean decreases in prolactin levels relative to baseline were observed in the two aripiprazole treatment 
arms  in  male  subjects,  and  in  both  of  the  aripiprazole  arms  and  the  placebo  arm  in  female  subjects. 
The mean changes from baseline to the last visit in prolactin levels(in ng/ml) were −2.58, −3.39, and 
0.72 in the aripiprazole 10 mg, aripiprazole 30 mg, and placebo arms, respectively, in male subjects. 
The  incidence  of  low  prolactin  levels  (less  than  3  ng/dL  in  females  and  less  than  2  ng/dL  in  males) 
during  the  acute  phase  was  greatest  in  the  aripiprazole  30  mg  arm  (35/89,  39.3%),  followed  by  the 
aripiprazole  10  mg  arm  (22/87,  25.3%),  and  then  by  the  placebo  arm  (2/85,  2.4%).  For  males,  the 
total incidence of low prolactin levels was 38/89 (38.8%) in the aripiprazole arms and 2/47 (4.3%) in 
the  placebo  arm.  For  females,  the  total  incidence  of  low  prolactin  levels  was  19/87  (21.8%)  in  the 
aripiprazole  arms  and  0/38  (0.0%)  in  the  placebo  arm.  During  the  entire  study  period,  the  overall 
incidence of low prolactin levels was greatest in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm (41/92, 44.6%), followed 
by the aripiprazole 10 mg arm (34/93, 36.6%), and then by the placebo arm (2/86, 2.3%). A higher 
proportion  of  males  experienced  decreased  prolactin  levels  than  females  in  both  dose  groups.  For 
males, the total incidence of low prolactin levels was 49/92 (53.3%) in the aripiprazole arms and 2/47 
(4.3%) in the placebo arm. For females, the total incidence of low prolactin levels was 26/93 (28.0%) 
in the aripiprazole arms and 0/39 (0.0%) in the placebo arm. None of these events were reported as 
TEAEs or SAEs or resulted in discontinuation of study medication.

A decrease in prolactin levels relative to baseline was observed in children and adolescents with bipolar 
I disorder. The mean changes from baseline to the last visit in prolactin levels (in ng/ml) were: -1.55  
at  week  8;  -1.24  ng/ml  at  week  18;  -0.74  at  week  26  and  -0.88  at  the  last  visit.  For  females  the 
decreases  in  prolactin  levels  were  smaller  than  for  males.  The  incidence  of  low  prolactin  levels  was 
38/83 (45.8%). For females, the incidence of low prolactin levels was 9/34 (26.5%), for males 29/49 
(59.2%). None of these events were reported as TEAEs or SAEs or resulted in discontinuation of study 
medication. 
1.3.3.5.  Discontinuation due to AES 
Study 31-03-240 
During  the  acute  phase,  a  total  of  16/294  (5.4%)  subjects  discontinued  study  medication  due  to  a 
TEAE:  6/98  (6.1%)  in  the  aripiprazole  10  mg  arm,  8/99  (8.1%)  in  the  aripiprazole  30  mg  arm,  and 
2/97 (2.1%) in the placebo arm. During the entire 30-week study, a total of 30/294 (10.2%) subjects 
discontinued  study  medication  due  to  a  TEAE:  9/98  (9.2%)  in  the  aripiprazole  10  mg  arm,  19/99 
(19.2%) in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and 2/97 (2.1%) in the placebo arm.  
No  relevant  differences  on  the  rates  of  discontinuation  due  to  AEs  were  observed  between  the  age 
groups of 10-12 years versus 13-17 years. 
Study 31-03-241 
One  out  of  Eighty  six  (1.2%)  subjects  with  bipolar  I  disorder  discontinued  study  medication  due  to  a 
TEAE : auditory hallucination. 
1.3.3.6.  Post marketing experience 
During  the  six-month  period  from  17  July  2010  through  16  January  2011,  among  files  for  which  the 
age  of  the  patient  was  reported,  there  were  a  total  of  234  healthcare  professional  confirmed  cases 
(221 initial and 13 follow up) of AEs occurring in patients 17 years of age or younger. Of these cases, 
223  were  spontaneous  cases  and  11  were  derived  from  published  literature.  Furthermore,  73  cases

The MAH performed a supplementary search of the most common AEs from the CARES (BMS Corporate 
Adverse  Events  Reporting  and  Evaluation  System)  database,  by  August  7,  2012.  The  estimated 
worldwide  postmarketing  aripiprazole  exposure  for  patients  aged  0-17  years  was  1,451,600  patients, 
most  on  the  schizophrenia  indication.  There  were  151  cases  of  somnolence  or  sedation  (131  reports 
from  healthcare  professionals,  20  from  published  literature).  Of  these  cases,  39  were  considered 
serious. The events reported to be similar across different pediatric age groups. There were 217 cases 
that  fell  under  “Weight  increased”.  Of  these  cases,  214  were  spontaneous  cases,  and  3  were  from 
published literature. Thirty of the 217 cases were considered serious. The 217 cases which met criteria 
for inclusion in this search described 94 males and 86 females (gender not provided in 37 cases). The 
nature  of  the  reported  events  related  to  weight  increased  was  similar  across  different  pediatric  age 
groups.  There  were  442  cases  of  “Dyskinesias  and  movement  disorders”  or  “Parkinson’s  disease  and 
Parkinsonism”  which  included  444  events.  Of  these  cases,  1  case  was  from  a  clinical  trial,  409  were 
spontaneous  cases,  and  14  cases  were  from  published  literature.  Ninety-two  of  the  442  cases  were

groups in the pediatric population (age range 7 months to 17 years old, mean 13 years old). 
1.3.3.7.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  from  the  two  clinical  studies  supportive  of  the  intended  indication  in  Bipolar  I 
disorders  (10  years  and  older)  appeared  to  be  similar  in  events  to  the  one  observed  in  the  adult 
population.  The  short  and  medium  term  features  of  the  studies,  however  did  not  allow  to  make  any 
conclusions,  particularly  for  the  high  rate  of  EPS  symptoms  and  of  weight  gain  observed  in  this 
population.  
In  the  pivotal  study  31-03-240,  the  majority  of  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  Neurologic 
gastrointestinal  AEs  and  psychiatric  AEs  not  related  to  lack  of  efficacy  (including  aggression,  bipolar 
disorder,  libido  increased,  oppositional  defiant  disorder  and  suicidal  ideation)  were  mainly  reported. 
However, somnolence and fatigue were commonly reported (24.5% and 11.8% , respective) and are of 
concern  in  the  proposed  population,  younger  than  the  authorised  paediatric  indication  for 
schizophrenia. 
The  percentage  of  subjects  who  experienced  severe  TEAEs  during  the  entire  study  was  higher  in  the 
aripiprazole  arms  compared  to  the  placebo  arm.  The  percentage  of  subjects  who  discontinued  study 
medication due to TEAEs was greatest in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, followed by the aripiprazole 10 
mg  and  the  placebo  arm.  For  the  majority  of  TEAEs,  no  dose-relationship  could  be  established, 
however, EPS symptoms were very significant AEs and dose dependent, with more than quarter of the 
patients experiencing EPS in the 30 mg aripiprazole arm. 
According to previous discussion on efficacy (see 2.3.2.4), the CHMP considered that the MAH proposal 
to have a maximum daily dose of 30 mg was not acceptable, especially given its safety profile and the 
intended use in a population, younger than the authorised paediatric indication for schizophrenia. 
Weight  gain is  possibly  the  most  significant AE  reported,  particularly  in  bipolar  disorders.  Although in 
the  acute  phase  the  difference  is  not  statistically  significant,  there  is  nonetheless  a  difference,  which 
appeared  clinically  relevant,  meaning  that  for  most  patients  weight  gain  /  increased  appetite  started 
immediately after initiation of treatment. Increased weight in such short time cannot be attributed to 
growth, and even small weight increases may represent a significant percentage of weight increase in 
lighter subjects. At week 30, there was a mean 6.5 Kg increase in aripiprazole treatment arms versus 
3.0 Kg increase in placebo.   
Potentially  clinically  significant  weight  gain  (≥  7%  weight  gain  compared  to  baseline),  was  over  30% 
and reached 44% in studies 31-03-240 and 31-03-241, respectively.  
On the basis of further analyses performed at the CHMP request, a clear weight increase over time of 
>3.5 Kg as compared to placebo by week 30 was observed  for completers. Weight gain was higher in 
the  10-12  years  old  particularly  on  the  30  mg  aripiprazole  arm  (even  taking  in  consideration  the 
increase in placebo arm the difference is 4.9 Kg), but the sample  size was small and lacked statistical 
significance. Patients whose weight increased most were non baseline overweight. Although the sample 
sizes  were  small,  same  trend  of  weight  increased  were  observed  in  all  analyses  performed.  BMI 
showed a similar pattern to weight gain, with the placebo arm also increasing slightly in the younger 
group,  and  the  greatest  BMI  increased  in  the  treatment  arms.  One  of  98  (1.0%)  subjects  in  the 
aripiprazole 10 mg arm showed glycolysated haemoglobin increased during the acute phase. None was 
reported  in  study  31-03-241.  Hyperglycaemia  /  diabetes  usually  takes  longer  to  develop  than  the 
duration of the  studies, therefore no conclusions on these AEs can be made, although this event has 
been  identified  as  potential  concern.  In  the  30  week  period,  other  metabolic  effects  were  not  overly 
seen, apart from an increase in triglycerides but with high intersubject variability.

In order to address the CHMP concerns over the AE profile observed in the bipolar I disorder population 
aged  10  years  and  older,  ie  high  frequency  of  EPS  related  symptoms,  somnolence  and  weight  gain 
related events, the MAH presented a comparison of the safety profile for 10-12 years and 13-17 years 
to  support  their  proposal  to  revise  the  indication  applied  for  from  10-17  years  to  13-17  years  (see 
Table  21).    This  analysis  provided  further  evidence  that  the  frequency  of  EPS,  weight  gain  and 
somnolence reported in the 10-12 years old group precluded an indication in this younger population. 
Most AEs occurred with 30 mg aripiprazole than with 10 mg dose.  
Comparative data on EPS, sedation, somnolence and weight/BMI changes between age groups of 13-
14 years versus 15-17 years did not show any significant differences in AE profiles, suggesting that a 
restriction to 15-17 years population would not be an appropriate measure to minimise these risks. 
Overall,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  safety  profile  was  unfavourable  for  the  10-12  age  group  and 
therefore agreed to restrict the indication to the adolescents aged 13 years and older, as proposed by 
the applicant. ). Long term studies are also ongoing that will collect further data to monitor the safety 
profile of the product in this population. 
The CHMP also recommended that educational materials are provided to patients/caregivers to ensure 
the safe and effective use of Abilify in this new paediatric indication (see 2.3.4).  
1.3.4.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated Risk Management Plan (version 7.4) within this variation procedure

2.  BENEFIT RISK ASSESSMENT 
2.1.1.  Benefits  
2.1.1.1.  Beneficial effects 
Results  from  study  31-03-240,    a  large  randomised  controlled  trial  conducted  in  children  and 
adolescents  aged  10  years  and  older,  showed  that  aripiprazole  is  effective  in  the  treatment  of 
moderate  to  severe  manic  episodes,  as  demonstrated  by  statistically  significant  improvement 
compared with placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint, the mean change from baseline to week 4 in 
the  total  YMRS  score.  The  study  was a  double  blind  placebo  controlled  consisting  of  an acute  4  week 
phase  and  a  26  week  maintenance  phase.  The  duration  of  the  study  was  therefore  longer  than  the 
recommended  12  week  maintenance  trial  as  referred  in  the  “Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Clinical 
Investigation  of  Medicinal  Products  in  the  Treatment  of  Bipolar  Disorder”,  (CPMP/EWP/567/98). 
Significant  improvements  were  also  documented  for  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoints:  CGAS,  CGI-BP 
Severity  Score  for  mania  and  for  overall  bipolar  illness,  GBI  Total  Score  for  mania  and  for  the  ADHD 
rating scale. 
In the acute phase, treatment with aripiprazole resulted in statistically significant improvements (LOCF) 
compared with placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint YMRS Total Score at week 4  in both 10 mg (-
5.99, CI:-8.49;-3.50, p<0.0001) and 30 mg (-8.26, CI:-10.7;-5.77, p<0.0001).  
This  efficacy  was  maintained  through  week  30  showing  a  statistically  significant  sustained 
improvement  over  placebo  in  both  10  mg  (-5.89,  CI:-8.70;-3.08,  p<0.0001)  and  30  mg  (-6.73,  CI:-
9.53;-3.94, p<0.0001). Mean changes in YMRS Total Scores at week 30 using LOCF data were −14.1 
in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm, −14.9 in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and −8.2 in the placebo arm.  
Significant  improvements  were  also  documented  for  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoints:  CGAS,  CGI-BP 
Severity  Score  for  mania  and  for  overall  bipolar  illness,  GBI  Total  Score  for  mania  and  for  the  ADHD 
rating scale 
Both  the  aripiprazole  10  mg  and  30  mg  arms  had  significantly  higher  percentages  of  responders 
compared to the placebo arm at every treatment week during both at week 4 and at week 30 using the 
LOCF  data  set,  thus  showing  maintenance  of  the  effect  of  treatment.  At  week  4,  percentages  of 
responders  were  44.79  %  and  63.64%  for  10  and  30  mg  groups  as  compared  to  26.09%  for  the 
placebo  group.  At  week  30,  percentages  of  responders  were  around  50%  and  55.56%  for  10  and 
30 mg groups as compared to 26.6% for the placebo group. 
2.1.1.2.  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In  a  post-hoc  analysis,  the  population  without  comorbid  disorders  did  not  differ  significantly  in  mean 
change  of  YMRS  in  both  10  mg  aripiprazole  and  placebo  by  week  4  thus  questioning  as  to  whether 
aripiprazole  may  act  mainly  in  symptoms  common  to  ADHD  /  ODD  and  not  specifically  on  Bipolar 
Disorder  type  I.  Additional  subgroup  analyses  were  performed  indicating  that  the  presence  of  any 
comorbidity did not seem to influence the YMRS changes at weeks 4 and 12. However, the persistence 
of effect was less evident in patients with or without ADHD at both weeks 4 and 12 for the 30 mg dose. 
When  compared  to  the  placebo  at  week  12,  the  OC  analysis  failed  to  show  statistical  significant  over 
the placebo for both doses on all analysed efficacy endpoints for both age groups. Considering the high 
rates  of  discontinuation,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  OC  analysis  did  not  provide  any  relevant 
Assessment Report 
EMA/62007/2013 
Page 51/57 
 
 
 
 
 
findings  apart  that  a  significant  percentage  of  patients  did  improve  spontaneously  by  week  12, 
suggesting that the treatment should not be prolong longer than 12 weeks.  
For  efficacy  endpoints  evaluating  the  effect  of  treatment  on  depressive  symptoms  (CGI-BP  Severity 
Score for depression, GBI Total Score for depression and CDRS) no statistically significant superiority 
of aripiprazole over placebo treatment was observed.  
2.1.2.  Risks  
2.1.2.1.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile from the two clinical studies supportive of the intended initial indication in Bipolar I 
disorders  (10  years  and  older)  appeared  to  be  similar  in  events  to  the  one  observed  in  the  adult 
population.  High rate of EPS symptoms and weight gain and somnolence are of particular concern in 
the proposed population.  
Potentially clinically significant weight gain reached 30% in study 31-03-240 and 44% in study 31-03-
241, reflecting a very high risk of weight gain associated with a morbid status, particularly in a bipolar 
population. 
EPS  symptoms,  particularly  parkinsonism  was  very  frequent  and  dose  dependent  to  aripiprazole.  If 
moderate  or  severe,  these  symptoms  will  be  a  stigma  to  subjects,  and  slowness  of  movements  and 
thought will have impact in patient’s activities of daily living and quality of life. 
Somnolence/fatigue was also very frequent and can have a deleterious effect on school attendance and 
school achievements. 
2.1.2.2.  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
No  paediatric  data  on  the  long  term  effect  of  aripiprazole  (e.g  on  weight  gain  and  EPS) are  currently 
available. Long term safety studies are ongoing to monitor the safety profile in this population. 
2.1.2.3.  Balance 
2.1.2.4.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Efficacy was demonstrated over placebo in Bipolar I disorder patients aged 10-17 years old at week 4 
as shown by statistically significant improvement on the total YRMS score. This efficacy was maintained 
through week 30 showing a statistically significant sustained improvement over placebo in both 10 mg 
and  30  mg.  However,  when  compared  to  the  placebo  at  week  12,  the  OC  analysis  failed  to  show 
statistical  significant  over  the  placebo  for  both  doses  on  all  analysed  efficacy  endpoints  for  both  age 
groups  of  10-12  and  13-17  years.  Given  the  high  number  of  discontinuation,  this  finding  suggested 
that the treatment should not be prolong longer than 12 weeks. 
Whilst the CHMP noted the standardised measures put in place for diagnosis based on DSM-IV criteria, 
a post-hoc analysis showed that the population without comorbid disorders did not differ significantly in 
mean  change  of  YMRS  in  both  10  mg  aripiprazole  and  placebo  by  week  4  thus  questioning  as  to 
whether  aripiprazole  might  act  mainly  in  symptoms  common  to  ADHD  /  ODD  and  not  specifically  on 
Bipolar  Disorder  type  I.  However,  additional  subgroup  analyses  were  performed  indicating  that  the 
presence of any comorbidity did not seem to influence the YMRS changes at weeks 4 and 12, this was 
being less evident with patients with or without ADHD at both weeks 4 and 12 for the 30 mg dose. In 
addition,  further  analysis  were  presented  showing  that  ADHD  status  did  not  change  the  10  mg 
Assessment Report

treatment effect significantly, particularly at week 12, where the use of ADHD medication was already 
permitted and favoured aripiprazole effect independently the presence of ADHD or ADHD medication. 
The  available  data  to  date  raised  safety  concerns  regarding  mostly  weight  gain,  EPS  symptoms, 
especially in the young Bipolar I disorder population aged 10-12 years.  Most AEs occurred with 30 mg 
aripiprazole than with 10 mg dose. Since enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 10 mg 
has not been demonstrated, the use of the 30 mg  dose was not recommended by the CHMP, and an 
increase over 10 mg should only be performed under strict surveillance. 
2.1.2.5.  Benefit-risk balance 
Considering  the  efficacy  and  safety  data  across  paediatric  age  groups  from  10-17  years,  the  CHMP 
noted  that  the  safety  profile  was  not  favourable  for  the  younger  population  (10-12  years)  and 
therefore  concluded  that  the  benefit  –risk  balance  was  positive  in  the  paediatric  Bipolar  I  disorder 
population aged 13 years and older. In order to minimise the risks of dose-related AEs occurrence, the 
use of the 30 mg dose is not recommended by the CHMP, and an increase over 10 mg should only be 
performed  under  strict  surveillance.  In  addition,  educational  material will  be  provided  to  patients  and 
caregivers to ensure the safe and effective use of Abilify in this new paediatric indication. 
2.2.  Conclusions 
The  overall  benefit-risk  balance  of Abilify is  positive  for  the  following indication:  “ABILIFY is indicated 
for  the  treatment  up  to  12 weeks  of  moderate  to  severe  manic  episodes  in  Bipolar  I  Disorder  in 
adolescents aged 13 years and older (see section 5.1)”.

DIVERGENT POSITIONS 
The undersigned members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending the 
variation  to  the  marketing  authorisation  to  add  the  following  indication:  “ABILIFY  is  indicated  for  the 
treatment  up  to  12 weeks  of  moderate  to  severe  manic  episodes  in  Bipolar  I  Disorder  in  adolescents 
aged 13 years and older (see section 5.1).” The reasons for divergent opinion were the following: 
• 
• 
The efficacy of aripiprazole in the treatment of manic or mixed episodes of type 1 bipolar 
mood  disorder  has  not  been  shown;  the  treatment  effects  largely  disappeared  after 
exclusion of psychiatric comorbid disorders suggesting the effect is mediated by a possibly 
aspecific  effect  on  symptoms  due  to  comorbidity  hence  at  least  questioning  the  effect  on 
symptoms of mania in adolescents; 
The  safety  profile  (occurrence  of  EPS  symptoms,  weight  gain  and  somnolence)  is 
unfavourable  in  younger  patients  aged  13  years  and  older  with  manic  episode,  especially 
taking the above into account.

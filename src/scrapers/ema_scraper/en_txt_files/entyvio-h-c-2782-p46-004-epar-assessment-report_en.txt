Study design 
This  study  consisted  of  screening,  induction,  and  maintenance  phases,  and  an  open-label  cohort. 
Subjects  enrolled  into  the  induction  phase  that  consisted  of  2  cohorts  and  enrolment  into  Cohort  2 
started only after completion of enrolment into Cohort 1. Subjects in Cohort 1 were randomized 1:2 in 
a double-blinded manner to receive placebo or vedolizumab 300 mg at Weeks 0, 2, and 6. Subjects in 
Cohort  2  received  vedolizumab  300  mg  at  Weeks  0,  2,  and  6  in  an  unblinded  manner. Subjects  not 
showing  a  clinical  response  to  the  study  drug  at  Week  10  were  allowed  to  be  enrolled  into  the 
openlabel  cohort.  In  addition,  subjects  who  experienced  disease  worsening  or  received  rescue 
treatments during the maintenance phase, or those who completed Week 60 of the maintenance phase 
were also allowed to be enrolled into the open-label cohort. 
Study population /Sample size 
Study MLN0002/CCT-101 enrolled a total of 292 subjects in the induction phase, of these only 4 were 
aged  15  to  18  years  at  entry  (2  were  16  years  old  and  2  were  17  years  old):  2  were  randomized  in 
vedolizumab and 2 in placebo arm. Subjects enrolled in the maintenance phase were 109 and subjects 
enrolled in the open-label cohort were 259. 
Treatments 
Subjects  in  Cohort  1  were  randomized  1:2  in  a  double-blinded  manner  to  receive  placebo  or 
vedolizumab  300  mg  at  Weeks  0,  2,  and  6.  Subjects  in  Cohort  2  received  vedolizumab  300  mg  at 
Weeks 0, 2, and 6 in an unblinded manner. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy evaluation in the induction  phase (clinical response) was performed at Week 
10.  The  following  2  conditions  had  to  be  fulfilled  for  clinical  response:  a)  decrease  of  the  complete 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

Mayo score by ≥3 points and by ≥30% from baseline, and b) decrease of the subscore of rectal bleeding 
by ≥1 point from baseline, or ≥1 in the subscore of rectal bleeding. Subjects showing clinical response 
at Week 10 were enrolled into the maintenance phase at Week 14. Subjects who received the placebo 
in the induction phase continued to receive placebo at Weeks 14, 22, 30, 38, 46, and 54 in a double-
blinded manner and subjects who received vedolizumab in the induction phase were randomized 1:1 in 
a double-blinded manner to receive placebo or vedolizumab 300 mg at Weeks 14, 22, 30, 38, 46, and 
54. 
The  primary  efficacy  evaluation  in  the  maintenance  phase  (clinical  remission,  defined  as  ≤2  in  the 
complete  Mayo  score  and  ≤1  in  all  subscores)  was  performed  at  Week  60.  Subjects  who  completed 
Week 60 of the maintenance phase, subjects not showing a clinical response at Week 10, and subjects 
who experienced disease worsening or received rescue treatments during the maintenance phase could 
enroll  into  the  open-label  cohort.  In  the  openlabel  cohort  subjects  received  vedolizumab  300  mg  at 
Weeks  0x,  2x,  6x,  and  then  every  8  weeks  thereafter  for  46  weeks  (minimum)  to  94  weeks 
(maximum). 
Statistical Methods 
Induction Phase 
Primary Endpoint 
 –evaluated in the Full Analysis Set.” 
-superiority of MLN0002 over the placebo on clinical response at Week 10. 
-no  adjustments  for  multiplicity  were  made  between  the  analyses  of  the  two  phases  setting  the 
significance level at 5% each. 
Secondary Endpoints 
The superiority of MLN0002 over the placebo on clinical remission at Week 10 in the primary analysis 
of  the  induction  phase  was  demonstrated  when  a  statistically  significant  difference  was  observed  in 
both the clinical response at Week 10 and clinical remission at Week 10.  
For the other efficacy analysis, mucosal healing at  Week 10 was summarized in the same manner as 
those in the primary analysis in the induction phase.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 292 subjects entered into the induction phase at 86 sites in Japan; 246 subjects entered into 
Cohort  1  and  46  subjects  entered  into  Cohort  2.  The  246  subjects  who  entered  into  Cohort  1  were 
randomized to the placebo group (82 subjects) or the MLN0002 group (164 subjects), and all subjects 
received  the  placebo  or  MLN0002  in  a  double-blinded  manner.  The  46  subjects  who  entered  into 
Cohort  2  all  received  open-label  MLN0002.  Of  the  292  subjects  who  received  study  drug  in  the 
induction phase, 269 subjects (92.1%) completed the planned infusions  in the induction phase and 23 
subjects (7.9%) discontinued the study drug. The reasons for study drug  discontinuation were PTE/AE 
in 17 subjects, lack of efficacy in 5 subjects, and major protocol deviation in 1  subject. By treatment 
group, the proportion of subjects who discontinued the study drug was higher in the Cohort 2 MLN0002 
group than in the Cohort 1 placebo and MLN0002 groups 
Baseline data 
In  overall  subjects  who  entered  in  the  induction  phase,  the  proportion  of  male  subjects  was  61.6%. 
The overall mean age was 42.8 years, and 26 subjects (8.9%) were ≥65 years. The mean duration of 
UC was 7.91 years, and the mean complete Mayo score at Week 0 was 8.3. The study was projected to 
have subjects without prior TNFα antagonist use accounting for 50% of the planed sample size. As a 
result, 48.6% (142/292) of subjects who entered in the induction phase had no prior TNFα antagonist 
use. No clear differences were observed between treatment groups in demographic and other baseline 
characteristics of subjects who entered in the induction phase.

Mucosal Healing  
Mucosal Healing at Week 10 (Full Analysis Set in Induction Phase) 
Paediatric subset  
4 subjects  were aged 15 to 18 years at entry (2 were 16 years old and 2 were 17 years old): 2 in 
vedolizumab and 2 in placebo for UC in induction phase. All of these subjects had no response in the 
induction phase and moved to the open-label extension cohort. 
The study did not stratify by age and no subgroup analysis was planned or conducted for subjects aged 
15 to 18 years.  
Induction Phase Immunogenicity Results: 
The  total  of  3  subjects  (2.0%)  in  the  Cohort  1  MLN0002  group  and  in  the  Cohort  2  MLN0002  group 
were  AVA  positive  at  any  time  point  during  the  induction  phase.  All  subjects  were  assessed  as  AVA 
positive at only 1 time point. One subject was AVA positive at Week 10, and other 2 subjects were AVA 
positive  at  the  time  point  16  weeks  after  the  last  administration  of  MLN0002.  All  subjects  with  AVA 
positive were also positive for neutralizing antibody. 
Maintenance Phase Efficacy Results: 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Clinical remission at Week 60 was 31.0% and 56.1% in the placebo and MLN0002 groups, respectively. 
The  difference  (95%  two-sided  CI)  between  the  MLN0002  and  placebo  groups  in  clinical  remission  at 
Week 60 was 25.1% (4.500, 45.790) with the adjusted odds ratio of 2.88 (1.168, 7.108). Therefore, 
the  MLN0002  group  was  superior  to  the  placebo  group  (p=0.0210).  Regardless  of  prior  TNF α 
antagonist use, the MLN0002 group exceeded the placebo group in clinical remission at Week 60. 
Paediatric subset No pediatric patients entered in the maintenance phase. 
Open-Label Cohort 
Of the 292 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the induction phase or maintenance 
phase,  259  subjects  (88.7%)  entered  into  the  open-label  cohort  at  84  sites  in  Japan.  All  the  259 
subjects received MLN0002 in the open-label cohort. A total of 71 subjects (27.4%) discontinued the 
study drug in the open-label cohort. The reasons for study drug discontinuation were lack of efficacy in

44 subjects, PTE/AE in 19 subjects, voluntary withdrawal in 7 subjects, and major protocol deviation in 
1 subject. 
All 259 subjects who entered in the open-label cohort received at least one dose of the study drug in 
the open-label cohort and were included in the “Full Analysis Set in open-label cohort” and“Safety 
Analysis Set in open-label cohort.” 
Paediatric  subset:  all  the  four  subjects  aged  15  to  18  years  moved  to  the  open-label  extension 
cohort. 
In  general,  efficacy  results  of  MLN0002  in  the  open-label  cohort  was  favorable  when  MLN0002  was 
administered 300 mg IV at Weeks 0x (enrollment day to the open-label cohort), 2x, 6x, and every 8 
weeks thereafter to Japanese subjects with moderate or severe UC.  
Eleven subjects (11/194 subjects, 5.7%) were AVA positive at any time point in the open-label cohort. 
Of these, 3 subjects (3/194 subjects, 1.5%) were persistently positive and 8 subjects (8/194 subjects, 
4.1%)  were  transiently  positive.  Of  these  11  AVA  positive  subjects,  7  subjects  were  positive  for 
neutralizing antibodies. No infusion reactions (based on the investigator assessment recorded on CRF) 
occurred in the AVA positive subjects. 
Paediatric subset: no subgroup analysis was planned or conducted for subjects aged 15 to 18 years.  
Safety results 
Induction phase 
The  incidence  of  TEAEs  was  52.4%  (43/82  subjects)  in  the  Cohort  1  placebo  group,  50.0%  (82/164 
subjects)  in  the  Cohort  1  MLN0002  group,  and  71.7%  (33/46  subjects)  in  the  Cohort  2  MLN0002 
group. The incidence of TEAEs in the Cohort 1 MLN0002 group was comparable with that in the Cohort 
1 placebo group. The incidence of TEAEs in the Cohort 2 MLN0002 group was higher than that in the 
Cohort 1 placebo and MLN0002 groups. On the other hand, the incidence of drug-related TEAEs was 
14.6%  (12/82  subjects)  in  the  Cohort  1  placebo  group,  10.4%  (17/164  subjects)  in  the  Cohort  1 
MLN0002 group, and 15.2% (7/46 subjects) in the  Cohort 2 MLN0002 group, and  no clear difference 
was observed between the treatment groups. Most of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. One 
severe  TEAE  was  observed  in  1  subject  in  the  Cohort  1  placebo  group  and  7  severe  TEAEs  were 
observed  in  5  subjects  in  the  combined  MLN0002  group.  Most  of  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in 
intensity. 
The  incidence  of  TEAEs  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation  was  2.4%  (2/82  subjects)  in  the 
Cohort  1  placebo  group,  4.9%  (8/164  subjects)  in  the  Cohort  1  MLN0002  group,  and  13.0%  (6/46 
subjects) in the Cohort 2 MLN0002 group. The incidence of serious  TEAEs was 4.9% (4/82 subjects) 
in  the  Cohort  1  placebo  group,  6.1%  (10/164  subjects)  in  the  Cohort  1  MLN0002  group,  and  13.0% 
(6/46  subjects)  in  the  Cohort  2  MLN0002  group.  Drug-related  serious  TEAEs  were  observed  in  2 
subjects in the Cohort 1 placebo group, 1 subject in the Cohort 1 MLN0002 group, and 1 subject in the 
Cohort 2 MLN0002 group. No deaths occurred in the induction phase. 
TEAEs by SOC with an incidence of ≥10% in any treatment groups were “infections and infestations” 
(22.0%,  22.0%,  and  39.1%  in  the  Cohort  1  placebo,  Cohort  1  MLN0002,  and  Cohort  2  MLN0002 
groups,  respectively),  “ gastrointestinal  disorders ”   (13.4%,  13.4%,  and  19.6%,  respectively),  
respiratory,  thoracic,  and  mediastinal  disorders ”   (7.3%,  7.3%,  and  10.9%,  respectively),  and  “
metabolism and nutrition disorders” (3.7%, 1.2%, and 10.9%, respectively). 
Infusion reactions in the induction phase were observed in 2 subjects (2.4%) in the Cohort 1 placebo 
group and in 5 subjects (3.0%) in the Cohort 1 MLN0002 group, and none was observed in the Cohort 
2 MLN0002 group. Infections were observed in 18 subjects (22.0%) in the Cohort 1 placebo group, 36 
subjects (22.0%) in the Cohort 1 MLN0002 group, and 18 subjects (39.1%) in the Cohort 2 MLN0002 
group.  The  TEAEs  in  the  neoplasms  benign,  malignant,  and  unspecified  (including  cysts  and  polyps)

SOC  were  observed  in  1  subject  each  in  the  Cohort  1  MLN0002  group  and  in  the  Cohort  2  MLN0002 
group. 
One  subject  in  the  Cohort  1  MLN0002  group  had  a  positive  finding  (visual  field  disorder)  on  the 
Subjective  PML  checklist  at  Week  6  but  she  had  no  positive  findings  on  the  Objective  PML  checklist. 
There  were  no  other  subjects  with  positive  findings  on  the  Subjective  PML  checklist.  No  PMLs  were 
observed. 
Maintenance phase 
No paediatric patients entered in the maintenance phase. 
Open-label cohort 
Overview of TEAEs, Including Serious TEAEs (Safety Analysis Set in Open-Label Cohort) 
TEAEs by SOC with an incidence of ≥10% were“infections and infestations” (73.7%), “gastrointestinal 
disorders ” (44.8%), “ musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders ” (25.9%),  “skin  and 
subcutaneous  tissue  disorders ”   (23.2%),  ,  “ respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders ” 
(18.5%),  “ nervous  system  disorders ”   (17.4%),  “ general  disorders  and  administration  site 
conditions” (17.0%), and “eye disorders” (12.0%). 
TEAEs  by  PT  with  an  incidence  of  ≥5%  were  viral  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (50.2%),  colitis 
ulcerative  (16.2%),  influenza  (9.3%),  headache  (8.9%),  back  pain  (8.5%),  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection (7.7%), pyrexia (6.6%), pharyngitis (6.2%), gastroenteritis (5.4%), arthralgia (5.4%), upper 
respiratory tract inflammation (5.4%), stomatitis (5.4%), and eczema (5.0%). The trend of TEAEs in 
the  “Safety  Analysis  Set  in  open-label  cohort”  was  not  clearly  different  from  that  in  the  “Safety 
Analysis Set in induction phase” or the “Safety Analysis Set in maintenance phase.”

Paediatric subjects 
 Two  pediatric  patients  (16  and  17  years  old)  in  open-label  cohort,  experienced  a  serious  TEAEs,  as 
reported  in  the  “Narratives  of  other  Serious  Adverse  Events”.  However,  they  were  considered  not 
treatment related by the investigator and the Applicant, as follow: 
Subject: Japanese Male 16 years old.  
Investigator’s comment: It is considered that the patient experienced upper respiratory tract infection. 
Since  this  event  developed  after  the  discontinuation  of  the  study  drug,  there  is  no  causal  relation 
between  the  event  and  the  study  drug.  The  severity  of  the  event  is  mild.  Since  the  patient  was 
hospitalized  for  further  examination  and  treatment,  the  event  is  reported  as  a  serious  one.  The 
event  is  assessed  as  resolved,  then  the  patient  was  discharged  from  the  hospital  with  improved 
general condition. Causal relation to the study procedure: not related 
Subject: Japanese Male 17 years old.  
Investigator’s  comment:  The  patient  was  withdrawn  from  the  study  on  18  February  2015  because  of 
lack  of  efficacy.  Although  a  workup  performed  on  19  February  2015  showed  no  aggravation  of  the 
ulcerative  colitis  which  the  patient  had  been  suffering  from  since  before  the  start  of  the  study  drug, 
salvage treatment with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and ciclosporin was given. However, the patient 
experienced  adverse  reactions  to  ciclosporin,  which  led  to  discontinuation.  The  medical  therapy  was 
determined  to  be  ineffective,  and  surgery  was  considered  as  an  option.  The  patient  was  then 
transferred  to  the  surgery  dept,  then  the  event  was  determined  to  be  a  serious  adverse  event  of 
"aggravation of ulcerative colitis". It is lack of efficacy of the study drug which was seen in this case, 
therefore the event is assessed as not causally related to the study drug. 
No PMLs were observed in the open-label cohort. Positive findings on the Subjective PML checklist were 
observed  in  6  subjects  in  the  open-label  cohort.  Of  these  subjects,  2  subjects  also  having positive 
findings on the Objective PML checklist were evaluated by the Independent Adjudication Committee for 
PML, but PML was ruled out. 
There was no new safety signal reported in this study.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In order to comply with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation, the MAH submitted  a final report(s) for 
Study MLN0002/CCT-101, a phase 3 study of vedolizumab 300 mg (powder for concentrate for solution 
for  infusion)  in  ulcerative  colitis  (UC)  conducted  in  Japan.  This  study  is  not  part  of  the  vedolizumab 
Paediatic Investigational Plan (PIP) in UC and Crohns disease (CD), EMEA-000645-PIP01-09.   
Study MLN0002/CCT-101 in UC is part of the phase 3 clinical program to support registration in Japan 
(Study MLN0002/CCT-101 in UC and Study MLN0002/CCT-001 in CD).  
In this phase 3 program in Japan the age entry criteria was from 15 to 80 years old subjects.  
An assessment of efficacy results for the whole study is out of the scope of this AR. Moreover, stratified 
data on pediatric patients have not been provided not allowing any efficacy evaluation of vedolizumab 
in this target population, which is the object of this assessment. 
Four  paediatric  subjects  entered  the  study  (2  randomized  in  the  vedolizumab  and  2  in  the  placebo 
arm).  All  of  these  subjects  had  no  response  in  the  induction  phase  and  moved  to  the  open-label 
extension cohort. Therefore efficacy is not supported. Only 4 subjects aged 15 to 18 years at entry (2 
were  16  years  old  and  2  were  17  years  old)  were  included  in  the  Study  (2  in  vedolizumab  and  2  in 
placebo  for  UC  in  induction  phase).  All  of  these  subjects  had  no  response  in  the  induction  phase  and 
moved to the open-label extension cohort. 
 In  the  overall  population  at  induction  phase  results  coming  from  both  primary  and  secondary 
endpoints didn’t support efficacy.   
The  number  of  Japanese  pediatric  patients  included  in  this  Study  is  considered  too  low  to  add 
important efficacy information on the vedolizumab treatment in this patient population. Moreover, the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/225577/2019  
Page 11/12 
 
 
 
lack of a subgroup analysis does not allow to draw firm conclusion. Therefore, the information provided 
are considered not informative and, as consequence, an update of the SmPC is at present not required.  
Overall,  from  a  safety  point  of  view,  no  new  signal  seems  to  have  occurred  in  this  study.  Stratified 
safety  data  in  the  four  pediatric  patients  have  not  been  provided  therefore  the  vedolizumab  safety 
profile in these very few Japanese pediatric patients remains unknown. Two SAEs were identified in a 
16 years old and a 17 years old (one case of upper respiratory tract infection and one of aggravation of 
ulcerative  colitis,  respectively)  from  the  Narratives  of  other  Serious  Adverse  Events.  However,  they 
were  both  considered  not  to  be  related  to  study  treatment  by  the  investigators.  Therefore,  no  firm 
conclusion can be drawn regarding the safety profile in pediatric patients. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
In  order  to  comply  with  Article  46  of  the  Paediatric  Regulation,  the  MAH  submitted  a  final  report  for 
Study MLN0002/CCT-101, a phase 3 study of vedolizumab 300 mg in ulcerative colitis (UC) conducted 
in  Japan.  Overall,  the  very  low  number  of  Japanese  pediatric  patients  included  in  this  Study  (2 
randomized in the vedolizumab and 2 in the placebo arm) does not add important efficacy information 
on the vedolizumab treatment in pediatric patient population and the lack of a subgroup analysis does 
not  allow  to  draw  firm  conclusion.  Moreover,  stratified  safety  data  in  the  four  pediatric  patients  have 
not  been  provided,  therefore  the  vedolizumab  safety  profile  in  these  very  few  Japanese  pediatric 
patients remains unknown. Two SAEs  were identified in a 16- and 17-years old patients (one case of 
upper  respiratory  tract  infection  and  one  of  aggravation  of  ulcerative  colitis,  respectively),  but  they 
were both considered not to be related to study treatment by the investigators. 
In conclusion, the information provided are considered not informative and, as consequence, an update 
of the SmPC is at present not required.  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

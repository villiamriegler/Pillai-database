The  applicant  received  Scientific  Advice  on  the  development  relevant  for  the  approved  indication  from  the 
CHMP, on 13 October 2016 (EMEA/H/SA/3415/1/2016/III), 21 April 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/3415/2/2017/I) and 14 
December 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/3415/1/FU/1/2017/II). The Scientific Advice pertained to the following quality, 
non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier: 
 
 
the approach to control the high molecular weights (HMW) in the fixed dose combination (FDC) as sum of 
HMW forms of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for release and during stability; 
the  approach  to  control  the  low  molecular  weights  (LMW)  species  in  the  FDC  as  sum  of  LMW  forms  of 
pertuzumab and trastuzumab for release and during stability; 
  Suitability of a proposed method to control the potential critical quality attributes. 
 
the proposal to control the bioactivity of the FDC using two HER2 binding cell-free assays; 
  Adequacy of nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology studies conducted to support the 
proposed clinical studies for the FDC; 
  Adequacy of the Phase I development programme to support the proposed Phase III study for the FDC;   
  Adequacy of the design of the Phase III study to support the comparability of the benefit-risk profile of the 
FDC to the single components, Perjeta + Herceptin IV formulations in breast cancer, including the choice 
of  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints,  the  selected  patient  populations,  choice  of  control  arm  and 
chemotherapy backbone, the safety monitoring plan of the Phase III study; 
 
 
The proposed statistical analysis of the proposed Phase III study to show the comparability between the 
FDC and Perjeta IV + Herceptin IV; 
The proposed size of the safety database for the Phase III study to support the comparability of benefit-
risk profile for the FDC to Perjeta and Herceptin IV; 
  Whether the clinical development plan is adequate to support the approval of a new MAA for the FDC for 
the treatment of patients in both early and metastatic breast cancer; 
  Whether the available PK and safety results of the Phase I study (BO30185) can support the selected FDC 
doses (co-formulation of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and rHuPH20) for the Phase III clinical study; 
 
the  choice  of  the  proposed  Patient-Reported  Outcome  (PRO)  measures  in  the  phase  III  trial  [Patient 
Preference  Questionnaire  (PPQ)  and  validated  Therapy  Administration  Satisfaction  Questionnaire  IV/SC 
(TASQ IV/SC)] to assess patient preference and satisfaction with the route of administration and whether 
the satisfaction data can be included in the label.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed indications for pertuzumab plus trastuzumab fixed-dose combination for subcutaneous use (PH 
FDC SC) are the same as those approved for pertuzumab (Perjeta) in the EU, in combination with 
trastuzumab (Herceptin) and chemotherapy for HER2+ breast cancer.  
When these agents are administered via IV infusions, they can be given in any order. Both antibodies are 
administered sequentially as an IV infusion over 60-90 minutes, respectively, for the loading dose and 30 
minutes for the maintenance dose.  Following the infusion, there is an observation time of approximately 30–
60 minutes for Perjeta and 2–6 hours for Herceptin.  The usage of IV MAbs with the observation time 
required after infusion has placed a strain on medical centres with respect to time and resources required to 
prepare and administer the infusion (De Cock et al, PLOS ONE 2016).   
Additionally, the required procedure to establish IV access in a patient is considered invasive. HER2-targeted 
therapy is usually given for long periods of time: pertuzumab and trastuzumab treatment is recommended 
for 1 year in the approved indication in the adjuvant early breast cancer (EBC) setting in patients with high 
risk of recurrence. In metastatic breast cancer (MBC), they are administered as first-line therapy until 
disease progression, which may be for several years for some patients. These patients often require 
installation of a port under the skin which can be associated with increased risk of infection, thrombosis, 
discomfort and high cost (Shivakumar et al. JCO 2009; Poorter et al. EJC 1996). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the world. In 2018, according to the prediction of 
the European Cancer Information System (ECIS), breast cancer continues to be the most common female 
cancer, with incidence in the European Union (EU-28) accounting for 29.2% of all cancers in women. In the 
EU-28 countries, a total of 404,920 new female breast cancer cases was estimated to occur in 2018 (Dafni, 
BC 2019).  
Breast cancer represents a major Public Health concern due to its high morbidity and mortality rates, with 
EUROSTAT reporting that it accounted for 1.8% of all deaths in the EU-28 in 2015 and 3.6% (i.e., double) of 
deaths in women. Breast cancer was the leading cause of death from cancer in women (138,000; 16.2% of 
850,000 cancer deaths) among 40 European countries in 2018, but it was reported as the second cause after 
lung cancer in the EU-28 (Dafni, BC 2019). 
The most important risk factors include: genetic predisposition, exposure to oestrogens [endogenous and 
exogenous, including long-term hormone replacement therapy (HRT)], ionizing radiation, low parity, high 
breast density and a history of atypical hyperplasia. The Western-style diet, obesity and the consumption of 
alcohol also contribute to the rising incidence of breast cancer (McTiernan, Oncologist 2003; Cardoso, Ann 
Oncol 2018). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 12/113 
 
  
  
Prevalence is increasing, due to increased incidence and improvements in treatment outcomes. In most 
Western countries, the mortality rate has decreased in recent years, especially in younger age groups, 
because of improved treatment and earlier detection (Allemani, Lancet 2015). 
Breast cancer in males is rare, contributing to 1% of cases. The major risk factors include clinical disorders 
carrying hormonal imbalances (especially gynaecomastia and cirrhosis), radiation exposure, a positive family 
history and genetic predisposition (Ottini, Crit Rev Oncol Hematol, 2010). 
Early Breast Cancer is a curable disease. Metastatic Breast Cancer remains virtually an incurable disease with 
a median overall survival (OS) of 3 years and a 5-year survival of only 25% (Cardoso, 2019). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous, phenotypically diverse disease composed of several biologic subtypes that 
have distinct behaviour. Amplification or overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2) oncogene is present in approximately 15 percent of primary invasive breast cancers (King, SCIENCE 
1985).  
HER2 overexpression was initially associated with high rates of disease recurrence and death in the absence 
of adjuvant systemic therapy. However, the value of this prognostic information in current clinical practice is 
questionable, particularly with the earlier use of HER2-directed agents in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant 
setting. 
HER2 status provides predictive information used for selecting optimal treatment. Several HER2-targeted 
therapies, such as trastuzumab (Herceptin), pertuzumab (Perjeta), trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1; 
Kadcyla), lapatinib (Tyverb), and neratinib (Nerlynx) were developed and have transformed the treatment of 
HER2-positive breast cancer. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
In countries with established breast cancer screening programmes, most patients present due to an abnormal 
mammogram. However, up to 15 percent of women are diagnosed with breast cancer due to the presence of 
a breast mass that is not detected on mammogram, and another 30 percent present with a breast mass in 
the interval between mammograms. In addition, women without access to screening mammograms and 
younger women under 40 years who may not be undergoing routine screening mammograms may present 
with a breast or axillary mass with or without skin changes. 
The diagnosis of breast cancer requires histologic evaluation. There are various histologic types of breast 
carcinoma that differ in microscopic appearance and biologic behaviour. Based on gene expression profiles, 
the following molecular subtypes have been identified: luminal A and B, HER2-enriched and basal (most of 
them under the category of triple negative). 
Breast cancer is staged using the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Union for 
Cancer Control classification system for Tumour, Nodes, and Metastases (TNM). The eighth edition of the 
TNM staging system, which was effective as of January 1, 2018, includes anatomic stage groups as well as 
prognostic stage groups, which incorporate biomarker testing.  Tumour stage is the most important 
prognostic indicator for breast cancer.

EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 13/113 
 
  
  
2.1.5.  Management 
In general, patients with early-stage breast cancer undergo primary surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) to 
the breast and regional nodes with or without radiation therapy (RT). 
Following definitive local treatment, adjuvant systemic therapy may be offered based on primary tumour 
characteristics, such as tumour size, grade, number of involved lymph nodes, the status of oestrogen (ER) 
and progesterone (PR) receptors, and expression of the human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) receptor. 
However, some patients with early-stage breast cancer (particularly those with HER2-positive or triple-
negative disease) may be treated with neoadjuvant therapy first, followed by surgery.  
The introduction of anti-HER2 therapies for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer has 
led to outstanding improvements of survival in both early and advanced settings (Pernas and Tolaney, 2019). 
The addition of trastuzumab (Herceptin®) to standard therapy dramatically improved prognosis for patients 
with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer and became a landmark in the treatment of these patients 
(Slamon et al, 2001). The subsequent addition of pertuzumab (Perjeta) to a taxane and trastuzumab 
combination compared with taxane and trastuzumab therapy alone as a first-line treatment in advanced 
HER2-positive breast cancer resulted in an improvement not only in PFS but also in OS by almost 16 months, 
reaching a median survival of nearly 5 years (CLEOPATRA trial, Swain et al, 2015).  
In the early breast cancer (EBC) setting, the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab and chemotherapy has 
also proved efficacious, both in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases of treatment. In the neoadjuvant EBC 
setting such combination showed a significant increase in pathological complete response (pCR) rates 
(NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA trials; Gianni et al 2016; Schneeweis et al 2013). In the adjuvant EBC setting 
it led to a marginal improvement of invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) in patients at high risk of recurrence 
(APHINITY trial, von Minckwitz et al, 2017). 
Overall, the role of trastuzumab and pertuzumab in combination with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, 
adjuvant and metastatic settings of patients with HER2+ BC is clearly defined.

Metastatic breast cancer (MBC): Phesgo is indicated for use in combination with docetaxel in adult patients 
with HER2-positive metastatic or locally recurrent unresectable breast cancer, who have not received 
previous anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. 
Special pharmaceutical aspects: Phesgo is administered subcutaneously, as a fixed non-weight-based dose, 
which is similar to the approved pertuzumab IV and trastuzumab SC formulations. Phesgo was developed to 
offer patients a less invasive and faster administration of pertuzumab and trastuzumab as a single product 
compared to individual IV infusions.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
Since the pertuzumab and trastuzumab active ingredients in the FDC for SC administration are identical to 
the active ingredients in the IV formulations, the underlying principle of the clinical development programme 
(CDP) of the FDC is a pharmacokinetic bridging approach. The CDP is based on the scientific consideration 
that pertuzumab and trastuzumab serum trough concentrations (Ctrough) after SC administration are at least 
as high as those Ctrough after IV infusion, resulting in a comparable degree of target-site saturation and thus 
comparable degree of efficacy, regardless of the route of administration. The CDP also builds on the 
development of the Herceptin SC formulation and the VELVET study (MO27782), in which Perjeta IV and 
Herceptin IV were administered in the same infusion bag. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product, Phesgo, is presented as solution for injection containing either 600 mg (for the 10 mL 
maintenance dose) or 1200 mg (for the 15 mL loading dose) of pertuzumab together with 600 mg of 
trastuzumab as active substances.

Other ingredients are: vorhyaluronidase alfa, L-histidine, L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, α,α-
trehalose dihydrate, sucrose, polysorbate 20, L-Methionine and water for injections. 
The finished product is a fixed dose combination (FDC) of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for subcutaneous 
(SC) administration; it is developed by Genentech, Inc. (a member of the Roche group), to offer patients a 
less invasive and faster administration of pertuzumab and trastuzumab compared to the intra-venous (IV) 
infusion. 
Pertuzumab concentrate for solution for infusion has been approved in the EU, under the trade name Perjeta, 
since March 2013; the MAH is the same as the proposed MAH for Phesgo. The changes introduced to the 
active substance (AS) manufacturing process to adapt to the SC formulation are described under the active 
substance section. 
Trastuzumab for SC administration, co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20, 
vorhyaluronidase alfa), has been approved in the EU through the centralised procedure since August 2013, 
under the trade name Herceptin, (MA Number: EU/1/00/145/002); the MAH is the same as the proposed 
MAH for Phesgo. 
2.2.2.  Active substances 
General information 
Pertuzumab and trastuzumab active substances are produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell cultures 
and then purified extensively using standard chromatographic and filtration methods. They are both 
recombinant, humanised monoclonal antibodies based on the human IgG1 (κ) framework sequences, 
containing an N-linked oligosaccharide. They are both directed against the extracellular domain of the human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), however they bind to distinct HER2 epitopes (within the 
subdomain II for pertuzumab and within the subdomain IV for trastuzumab), without competing, and have 
complementary mechanisms for disrupting HER2 signalling. The result is augmented anti-proliferative 
activity. Trastuzumab also has ADCC as additional mode of action (MoA). Pertuzumab is based on an IgG1 
framework, it also has the potential to engage immune effector functions, however this is only considered as 
secondary MoA. 
2.2.2.1.  Active substance - Trastuzumab 
The trastuzumab active substance used in the FDC finished product is identical to the trastuzumab active 
substance in Herceptin SC, only section S.4.5 Batch Analysis has been updated with batch data and a 
description of batches used in clinical phase III studies and for finished product process performance 
qualification (PPQ). As all updated batch analysis results met the release specifications without trends 
observed, the trastuzumab active substance for the FDC finished product is not further discussed in this 
assessment report.

2.2.2.2.  Active substance - Pertuzumab 
General information 
Pertuzumab is a humanised mAb based on a human IgG1(κ) framework. The recombinant antibody is 
produced in CHO cells and consists of two HCs (449 amino acid residues each) and two LCs (214 amino acid 
residues each). As is typical for IgG1 antibodies, pertuzumab contains an N-linked glycosylation site at 
Asn299 on each of the two HCs. The calculated molecular mass of the 448-residue HC form is 145,197 Da 
(without HC glycosylation or C-terminal lysine). The structure and the physicochemical and biological 
characteristics of pertuzumab SC active substance are the same as those of the pertuzumab IV active 
substance and hence they are only briefly discussed in this report. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The active substance manufacturing process for pertuzumab SC active substance is the same as the 
manufacturing process for pertuzumab IV active substance, with the exception that it has been optimised to 
obtain a more concentrated pertuzumab active substance  and to implement the experience gained from the 
pertuzumab IV active substance manufacturing process.  
Pertuzumab SC active substance is produced in a fed-batch process using a suspension-adapted CHO cell 
line. The manufacturing process has been adequately described. Main steps are cell culture, harvest, protein 
recovery and purification. The adaptations introduced for the cell culture harvest have been described. The 
purification process upstream of the ultrafiltration and diafiltration (UFDF) step (i.e. affinity chromatography, 
low pH virus inactivation, cation-exchange chromatography, virus filtration, anion-exchange chromatography 
steps) is the same as the approved pertuzumab IV active substance process. The UFDF step (concentration of 
the product and buffer exchange) has been modified to ensure an active substance concentration of 
pertuzumab. During purification, the samples are tested for bioburden, endotoxin, protein concentration and 
yield.  
The primary container closure is equivalent to the primary container closure used for pertuzumab IV active 
substance. 
Control of materials 
The serum-free master cell bank (MCB) used for pertuzumab SC is the same as the one approved for 
pertuzumab IV. There are no changes in the development of the CHO DP-12 cell line. A working cell bank is 
not used for pertuzumab SC active substance due to the high frequency of growth issues with WCBs relative 
to the MCB.  
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, while 
specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented. The raw materials of 
animal, human, or recombinant origin used in the production of the pertuzumab SC active substance are the 
same as those used for the pertuzumab IV active substance, thus the TSE risk is considered unchanged. 
Compliance with the current revision of the EMA/410/01 “Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products” is 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 17/113 
 
  
  
confirmed for relevant raw materials and no TSE issue have been identified for the manufacture of the 
Pertuzumab-Trastuzumab Fixed Dose Combination. 
Further information is provided under the Adventitious Agents part of the report.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The in-process limits for pertuzumab SC active substance are the same as those for pertuzumab IV active 
substance with the exception of UFDF step.  Acceptable information has been provided on the control system 
in place to monitor and control the active substance manufacturing process. Action limits and acceptance 
criteria are employed for bioburden sampling (either pre- or post-filtration through bioburden-reducing 
filters) and for in-process pools in the cell culture and purification processes. Actions taken if limits are 
exceeded are specified. 
Process validation 
The pertuzumab SC active substance manufacturing process is very similar to the validated pertuzumab IV 
active substance manufacturing process, hence, many of the validation studies previously performed for 
pertuzumab IV are directly applicable to pertuzumab SC. 
Additionally, five full scale commercial scale batches, from three independent thaws of MCB, were 
manufactured during the PPQ campaign. Although all process parameters remained within the acceptance 
range for all batches, demonstrating a robust manufacturing process, one of the PPQ batches showed 
reduced cell growth and titre in the production culture; consequently, it did not meet all comparability and 
release acceptance criteria. The batch was not released. Such inherent variability is also seen in the 
pertuzumab IV process and it is thus not unexpected. The PPQ batches were also included in a process 
consistency study with four clinical pertuzumab SC batches and released pertuzumab IV batches. Both the 
pertuzumab IV and SC cell culture processes exhibit occasional reduced growth and titre, attributed to the 
pertuzumab cell line’s sensitivity to low pH and potentially other cell environmental stressors. To address this 
issue, a new cell line (derived from a new transfection of a CHO host cell line) is being developed, in line with 
the recommendations obtained with a scientific advice given in parallel to this MAA. 
Since the manufacturing process is a standard antibody manufacturing process, and in light of the extensive 
process knowledge already gained for the similar pertuzumab IV process, the results from the four remaining 
PPQ batches are considered sufficient to qualify the pertuzumab SC manufacturing process. 
Pertuzumab SC-specific single-factor risk assessments and validation studies were performed to account for 
the introduced changes, and were used, along with prior knowledge, to identify CPPs and set acceptable 
ranges.  
The frozen active substance is stored in tanks, which are either shipped via air and ground transportation. 
Sufficient shipping qualification/validation has been performed.  
Manufacturing process development 
The commercial active substance manufacturing process was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development programme. Several important changes have been introduced during the development of the 
manufacturing process. The pertuzumab SC active substance used for phase I clinical studies was 
manufactured with the pertuzumab IV active substance as starting material, which was reformulated and 
concentrated for SC administration. The active substance used for phase III studies was manufactured with a 
process highly similar to the IV process except for the introduction of a new working cell bank, changes to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 18/113 
 
  
  
 
the cell culture medium and modifications to the UFDF step. Between phase III and commercial the 
manufacturing site was transferred to the final proposed site, where PPQ was performed. A comparability 
study comparing PPQ/commercial pertuzumab SC versus phase III material confirmed comparability, 
including comparable degradation. One of the five batches failed the comparability acceptance criteria for 
some attributes and was not released. The four released PPQ batches manufactured at the proposed 
commercial site, which conform to all release specifications and comparability acceptance criteria, are 
considered comparable to phase III material in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy. 
Characterisation 
The Pertuzumab SC active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological 
state-of-the-art methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure of a human IgG1-
type antibody; the same characterisation studies performed for pertuzumab IV active substance were 
repeated. The analytical results are consistent with the proposed structure. Furthermore, heterogeneity of the 
active substance was adequately characterised by analysing size and charge variants, glycosylation and other 
product-related substances and impurities. The isolation and physicochemical characterisation of the product 
variants, which were described in the initial marketing application for Perjeta and have not been repeated, 
which is found acceptable as pertuzumab SC and pertuzumab IV active substances have similar 
chromatographic profiles in terms of overall peak shape and peak rank order. Heterogeneity of the active 
substance was adequately characterised; the levels of HMW forms was found to be slightly higher in the 
pertuzumab SC than in pertuzumab IV active substance, which is not unexpected considering the higher 
antibody concentration. The levels of deamidated forms was also slightly higher, however it does not raise 
concerns. 
Only a subset of biological characterisation assays, namely anti-proliferation and ADCC potency assay, were 
performed using the pertuzumab SC secondary reference standard as more extensive bioactivity assessments 
of the primary reference standards were performed for Perjeta (i.e. anti-proliferation activity, ADCC activity, 
FcγR and FcRn binding, HER2 binding, C1q binding and CDC, and apoptosis-inducing activity).  In summary, 
the characterisation is considered appropriate for this type of molecule. While the primary and the secondary 
reference standard displayed comparable inhibition of cell proliferation, the potency by ADCC for the 
secondary reference standard was below the comparability assessment criteria. The primary reference 
standard is therefore used as reference in the Potency by ADCC. 
In summary, the characterisation is considered appropriate for this type of molecule. 
The designated CQAs have been provided. The CQAs, for which changes are introduced compared to the 
CQAs listed for pertuzumab IV, are highlighted by the applicant. The risk ranking and filtering (RRF) tool 
addresses the recategorisation of some QAs and the risk assessment is considered appropriately 
conservative. 
Specification 
The test parameters and acceptance criteria for release and stability testing for pertuzumab SC active 
substance include parameters for: colour (Ph.Eur.), clarity and opalescence (Ph.Eur.), appearance (visual), 
pH, osmolality (Ph.Eur.), identity (peptide map, protein content by UV (Gravimetric)), purity (SE-HPLC), 
purity (non-reduced and reduced CE-SDS), purity (IE-HPLC), protein content by UV (Gravimetric), potency 
(anti-proliferation assay), potency (ADCC assay), bioburden (Ph.Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph.Eur.), content 
of polysorbate 20 (HPLC-ELSD), relative glycan distribution (2-AB HILICUHPLC). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 19/113 
 
  
  
 
The parameters tested correspond to the approved test parameters for the active substance of Perjeta; 
however, the active substance specification has been extended with the potency by ADCC assay and purity 
by IE-HPLC.  
Peptide mapping is used to confirm the identity of the drug substance. In order to distinguish pertuzumab SC 
active substance from pertuzumab IV active substance, which has an identical amino acid sequence, a 
secondary identity method, Protein Content by UV Spec Scan, is included as well. 
The omission of tests for process-related impurities is acceptable based residual DNA, residual HCP, and 
leached Protein A measurements during process validation demonstrating consistent reduction to levels below 
or close to the assay QL.  
The 2-AB HILIC-UHPLC method has replaced the CE-LIF method for the determination of relative glycan 
distribution. The test for determining the polysorbate content and the test for determining rodent parvovirus 
have also been replaced. 
The proposed specification tests and parameters are considered adequate for this type of molecule. No 
changes were implemented in the specification during the procedure. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
Potency is measured using two assays. The first one is an anti-proliferation assay, which measures 
pertuzumab SC active substance ability to inhibit the proliferation of the human HER2-expressing breast 
cancer cell line MDA-MB-175-VII, this is the same assay as used for pertuzumab IV active substance; the 
second is an ADCC assay. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data on two phase I batches, 4 phase III clinical batches and 5 PPQ, full scale, batches of the 
active substance were provided. The results are within the specifications with the exception of the value for 
the Potency by ADCC assay for a PPQ Batch, which exceeded the upper limit of the acceptance criteria and 
was hence not released. The results provided confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
The use of the same PRS as approved for pertuzumab IV commercial use is considered appropriate. 
Stability 
The proposed shelf life is 30 months at storage condition ≤-20 ºC protected from light. The stability results 
indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf life in the proposed 
container (stainless steel or Hastelloy vessel). 
Real time, real condition (-20ºC) stability data on three full scale batches of active substance from the 
commercial manufacturing process stored in the intended container for 9 months and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions at 5 ºC according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Additionally, real condition (-20ºC) stability data on four supportive batches of active substance used in the 
phase III clinical studies from manufacturing process representative of the commercial process, stored in a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 20/113 
 
  
  
container representative of the proposed container for 30 months and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions at 5ºC according to the ICH guidelines were also provided. 
The following parameters were tested during stability studies: colour (Ph.Eur.), clarity and opalescence 
(Ph.Eur.), purity (SE-HPLC), purity (non-reduced), purity (IE-HPLC) and potency (anti-proliferation assay); 
these stability indicating tests are in line with the stability tests for pertuzumab IV active substance. 
The stability data provided is within the specifications and support the proposed 30 months shelf life. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is an FDC of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for SC administration; it is provided as a 
sterile, colourless-to-slightly brownish solution and it contains no preservatives. The product is available in 
two formulations: 
The loading dose (LD) is formulated as 80 mg/mL pertuzumab and 40 mg/mL trastuzumab. Each single-dose 
vial contains 15 mL of the solution equivalent to 1200 mg pertuzumab, 600 mg trastuzumab and 2000 U/mL 
vorhyaluronidase alfa (also referred to as recombinant human hyaluronidase, rHuPH20) at target pH 5.5.  
The maintenance dose (MD) is formulated as 60 mg/mL pertuzumab and 60 mg/mL trastuzumab. Each 
single-dose vial contains 10 mL of the solution equivalent to 600 mg pertuzumab, 600 mg trastuzumab and 
2000 U/mL rHuPH20 at target pH 5.5 
The intended commercial formulation is the same as that used during clinical studies. 
The finished product contains vorhyaluronidase alfa (permeation enhancer), L-histidine and L-histidine 
hydrochloride monohydrate (buffer), α,α-trehalose dihydrate and sucrose (tonicity agents), polysorbate 20 
(surfactant), L-Methionine (stabiliser) and water for injections (solvent). All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards, with the exception of 
hyaluronidase (rHuPH20, vorhyaluronidase alfa), which has previously been assessed as (novel) excipient in 
the approved Herceptin SC (600 mg, solution for injection).  
The finished product does not contain any overages. Extractable volume studies were used to establish the 
minimum fill volume of the vials for both LD and MD FDC finished products to permit withdrawal and 
administration of the dose when used as directed. The primary packaging is a 15ml or 20 mL type I 
borosilicate glass vial tapered with fluororesin-laminated rubber stopper. The stopper is sealed with 
aluminium and covered by a plastic flip-off cap. The flip off cap is cool green for the loading dose and orange 
color for the maintenance dose. 
The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. The suitability of the 
container closure system with the finished product was demonstrated in terms of protection, safety and 
compatibility. 
The quality target product profile (QTPP), summarised in Table 2, is applied as guidance during pharmaceutical 
development.

Assessment report

For the finished product, the following quality attributes are considered as critical: subvisible particles, visible 
particles, sterility, container closure integrity, potency (by ELISA), protein content, primary packaging 
extractables/leachables, process-related impurities (including leachables). With the exception of the container 
closure integrity test, primary packaging extractables/leachables and process-related impurities (including 
leachables) all the CQAs are controlled by the finished product release specifications. Container closure

integrity is evaluated as part of stability testing, extractables/leachables and process-related impurities were 
also evaluated in respective studies. 
The applicant’s primary objective of the finished product development was to co-formulate pertuzumab, 
trastuzumab to enable a single subcutaneous injection.  
The LD and MD formulation development was guided by prior knowledge from the development of 
commercially available trastuzumab SC drug product and pertuzumab IV drug product. The trastuzumab SC 
finished product formulation was chosen as basis for the finished product development to support the stability 
of trastuzumab. rHuPH20 is added to the formulation to facilitate large volume injection subcutaneously. The 
trastuzumab SC finished product formulation was modified to optimise the stability of the finished product; 
hence, sucrose was used instead of trehalose to support pertuzumab SC active substance frozen storage at -
20C. The formulation development has been thoroughly described and the rationale for the selection of the 
formulation, including appropriate dosage form, protein concentration, buffer type, solution pH, stabiliser and 
surfactant, has been adequately addressed and justified. 
Compatibility with the excipients is considered demonstrated based on long-term stability, formulation 
development studies, and extended characterisation studies, which included a subvisible particles study, 
charged variants and size variants studies, a study of potential interactions between the antibodies and 
rHuPH20 and a study of the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Additionally, the comprehensive 
data presented from the three formulation robustness studies support the acceptable ranges of the 
formulation factors, including the pH, antibody and excipient concentration and ratios, and the surfactant 
polysorbate 20 concentration range. 
To  reduce  the  risk  of  particle  formation  in  Phesgo,  the  applicant  has  optimised  the  formulation.  Based  on 
previous  experience,  polysorbate  20  fatty  acid  degradants  accumulate  over  time  and  form  particles  that 
eventually  can  be  detected  during  stability  testing.  The  root  cause  for  polysorbate  20  degradation,  will  be 
addressed to mitigate the risk of FFA particle formation upon its degradation. A recommendation (REC 1) to 
evaluate and implement measures to mitigate the root cause for particle formation in the finished product has 
been given.  
To  confirm  that the polysorbate 20  surfactant  in  the  formulation  provides  suitable protection  from  agitation 
stress, an agitation formulation robustness stress study was performed. The data provided are satisfactory. 
However,  to  fully  conclude  on  the  suitability  of  polysorbate  to  protect  from  shipping  stress,  the  applicant  is 
recommended  to  perform  a  finished  product  agitation  stress  study,  to  simulate  mechanical  shipping  stress 
(agitation) including stability 2°C-8°C until end of shelf life post stress (REC 2).  
The  manufacturing  process  development  history  has  been  described  in  sufficient  details.  The  pivotal  clinical 
batches  were  manufactured  utilizing  the  same  manufacturing  process  main  steps  as  the  commercial  site.  A 
comparability exercise between the finished products from the pivotal clinical process and commercial process 
has been performed and confirms the comparability between the manufacturing process used for the pivotal 
clinical  batches  and  commercial  process.  The  comparability  study  includes  quantitative  comparison  with 
predefined comparability acceptance criteria, qualitative comparison and extended characterisation as well as 
a stress stability comparability study.  
The  measurements  to  control  microbiological  quality  and  sterility  of  the  finished  product  is  considered 
acceptable and include process validation (media fills, bacterial retention test of filters, microbial hold times), 
manufacturing controls, IPC testing and release testing. The integrity of the container closure system to prevent 
microbial contamination has been adequately described and continues to be controlled during stability. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020

A  compatibility  study  was  performed  to  address  potential  hold  times  subsequent  to  the  preparation  of  the 
syringe  and  prior  to  administration.  The  results  demonstrate  that  finished  product  in  simulated  SC 
administration is physically and chemically stable under the tested conditions (4 weeks at 2°C-8°C protected 
from  light  followed  by  24  hours  at  30°C  exposed  to  ambient  room  lighting  conditions)  when  stored  in 
polypropylene (PP) or polycarbonate (PC syringes). The in-use physico-chemical stability has been addressed 
properly  by  the  applicant.  A  minor  issue  concerning  the  microbiological  stability  has  been  resolved.  The 
proposed in use shelf-life, as described in section 6.3 of the SmPC, is supported. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  Phesgo  finished  product  manufacturing  process  consist  of  simple  physical  unit  operations  involving  no 
chemical  modifications  or reactions  and include  the  following  steps:  active  substance  and  excipient  thawing 
(pertuzumab  SC  AS,  trastuzumab  SC  AS  and  rHuPH20),  compounding  of  the  finished  product,  bioburden 
reduction  filtration,  in-line  sterile  filtration,  aseptic  filling  and  stoppering,  capping  and  crimping,  final  vial 
inspection, storage, transportation, and labelling and secondary packaging.  
Validation of the finished product manufacturing process included the manufacture of three consecutive PPQ 
batches for both the LD and MD of the finished product (total of six), representing the full range of batch sizes 
for commercial manufacturing. A bracketing approach was used during the finished product PPQ campaign to 
cover  the  full  manufacturing  batch  size  ranges.  Four  different pertuzumab  SC active  substance batches,  six 
different trastuzumab SC active substance batches and two rHuPH20 batches were used for the FDC finished 
product  PPQ  batch  manufacturing  campaign.  The  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate. 
One  Post  Approval  Change  Management  Protocol  (PACMP)  concerning  scale-up  of  the  MD  manufacturing 
process has been submitted with the application and found acceptable. 
Product specification  
The  proposed  finished  product  release  and  shelf-life  specifications  for  both  the  loading  dose  (LD)  and  the 
maintenance  dose  (MD)  include  general  tests  (appearance,  colour,  clarity/opalescence,  extractable  volume, 
visible particles subvisible particles, pH and osmolality, all Ph.Eur.), test for identity (Identity by Content of 
Proteins by RP-UHPLC Lys-C peptide mapping), test for quantity (protein concentration, RP-UHPLC, extractable 
volume),  potency  test  (two  specific  ELISAs),  purity  and  impurity  tests  (SE-HPLC,  non-reduced  CE-SDS,  IE-
HPLC)  as  well  as  test  for  safety  (sterility,  endotoxin).  In  addition,  tests  for  excipients;  Polysorbate  20  and 
hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) are included. Tests for osmolality, identity tests, bacterial endotoxin test and test for 
sterility are excluded from the shelf-life specifications, while container closure integrity is included in the shelf-
life specifications. Overall, the parameters included in the finished release and shelf-life specifications are found 
adequate  to  control  the  quality  of  the  finished  product.  The  overall  approach  for  setting  the  specification  is 
found satisfactory and in line with ICH Q6B. 
Adequate justification for not testing specific CQAs for pertuzumab SC is provided based on the control of the 
active substance. The anti-proliferative and Fc-mediated (ADCC) activities are controlled at the active substance 
level. At the finished product level the potency of each antibody is controlled by two specific ELISA methods. 
The ELISAs are based on the binding of the antibodies to the respective epitopes on HER2 and are designed to 
eliminate cross-reactivity between the co-formulated antibody. The specificity of each ELISA has further been

demonstrated during method validation. The anti-proliferation assay is not a suitable assay to be used at the 
finished product level due to the masking effect of the second antibody on the response of the first antibody. 
Based on this, it is agreed, that the ELISAs are considered the best possible assays to control the potency of 
the finished product.  
The  collective  potency  control  strategy  with  control  of  the  anti-proliferation  and  ADCC  activity  at  the  active 
substance level and the control by ELISA at the finished product level is considered sufficient to control the 
potency of the final finished product and ensure manufacturing consistency.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk assessment it can be 
concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The information on the control 
of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
A quality risk assessment on the possible presence of nitrosamine components in Phesgo has been submitted 
during the procedure. The biological components pertuzumab, trastuzumab and rHuPH20, the excipients, WFI 
and the primary packaging have been evaluated to determine the risk of nitrosating conditions or the 
presence of nitrosamine in the drug product. No risk was identified. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of 3 commercial scale PPQ batches for the LD and 3 for the MD of the finished product, 3 
phase III clinical batches for the LD and 3 for the MD finished product and 2 phase I clinical studies were 
provided. The results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
For the finished product two-tiered (primary and secondary) reference standard systems have been 
established for commercial use for LD and MD. The assay reference standard used for testing of rHuPH20 
bulk enzyme activity has been described. Reference standards for pertuzumab SC and trastuzumab SC active 
substances are described in the respective Module 3 Sections. 
Stability of the product 
Based on available stability data, the 18 months proposed shelf-life and storage conditions “Store in a 
refrigerator (2°C 8°C). Do not freeze. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light”, as 
stated in the SmPC, are acceptable. 
Real time/real condition stability data of 14 primary stability batches (3 commercial scale PPQ batches for the 
LD and 3 for the MD; 3 phase III clinical batches for the LD and 3 for the MD; 2 phase I clinical studies 
batches) for up to 24 months under long term conditions at 5ºC and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions at 25ºC / 60% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal 
product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing.

Shift of charge variants, LMW formation and HMW formation are the primary modes of degradation. Changes 
observed at recommended storage condition are within acceptance criteria and do not result in a potential 
failure to meet the acceptance criteria at the end of the proposed shelf life.  
Data generated from temperature excursion at above and below the recommended storage condition 
temperature confirm the stability of the finished product under conditions that might occur during 
manufacturing, shipping, and handling. 
In addition, 2 commercial scale batches were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The results confirm that the finished product is 
light sensitive with changes observed in SE-HPLC main peak, SE-HPLC sum of HMW forms, and shift of 
charge variants in IE-HPLC. Data from the control samples, exposed to light but stored in the proposed 
secondary packaging confirm that the packaging configuration adequately protects the finished product from 
light. 
Adventitious agents 
For the production of one of the recombinant human insulins used for the culture process of the pertuzumab 
and trastuzumab active substances, several animal-derived raw materials were used. Sufficient information to 
confirm the acceptability of these animal-derived raw materials with respect to TSE and adventitious agents 
are  provided  including  the  relevant  Certificates  of  Suitability.  An  appropriate  raw  material  specification  has 
been set for the recombinant human insulin.  
The media used to establish the pertuzumab SC cell bank contained amino acids derived from human hair or 
chicken  feathers.  As  no  ruminant  tissues  were  used,  there  is  no  significant  TSE  risk  from  this  material; 
additionally, the process used to manufacture the two amino acids effectively inactivates all viruses. 
Viral  and  non-viral  adventitious  agents  are  controlled  by  heat  treatment,  irradiation,  and/or  filtration  of 
materials used in the process. The procedure for cell culture media sterilisation and viral barriers is the same 
as that used for the approved pertuzumab IV process.  
The cell culturing and harvest includes sufficient IPCs for bioburden, endotoxin, mycoplasma, leptospira, rodent 
parvoviruses,  and  other  adventitious  viruses,  and  the  purification  process  includes  in-process  tests  for 
bioburden and endotoxin. 
Viral removal capacity studies performed for pertuzumab IV remain applicable to the pertuzumab SC process.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
The finished product, Phesgo, is presented as solution for injection containing pertuzumab and trastuzumab 
as active substances. Its development is based on the already approved pertuzumab solution for injection 
(Perjeta) and trastuzumab for SC administration, co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase 
(Herceptin). Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and

uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. No major objections were raised 
during the procedure and the other concerns have been adequately addressed. 
One PACMP concerning scale up of the MD manufacturing process has been submitted with the application 
and it is considered acceptable. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were two minor unresolved quality issues, linked to the observed 
presence of FFA particles upon storage, and having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, as 
described under ‘Recommendations for future quality development’.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety and it is considered adequate. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The current MAA concerns a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for subcutaneous 
(SC) injection (referred to as “PH FDC SC”). PH FDC SC is a new ready-to-use solution co-formulated with 
recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), a permeation enhancer which allows SC administrations 
of high drug volumes.  
Pertuzumab and trastuzumab are recombinant humanised immunoglobulin (Ig)G1κ monoclonal antibodies 
(MAbs), which target the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, c-erbB2), a transmembrane 
glycoprotein with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. The MAbs bind to distinct HER2 epitopes, subdomains II 
and IV respectively, without competing, and they have complementary mechanisms for disrupting the HER2 
signalling. 
Both active substances are approved and marketed by Roche as individual products for IV injection under the 
names Perjeta (pertuzumab) and Herceptin (trastuzumab). Trastuzumab is additionally approved in a SC 
formulation in combination with rHuPH20 (Herceptin SC line extension). Pertuzumab IV and trastuzumab 
IV/SC in combination with chemotherapy is already used clinically in free combination in the “Perjeta 
treatment regimen” for HER2-posivtive breast cancer. The proposed indication for the fixed-dose combination 
is therefore in line with currently approved therapeutic indications for patients with HER2-positive Early or 
Metastatic Breast Cancer (EBC/MBC) described in the Perjeta product information. 
The non-clinical strategy to support the application of PH FDC SC is therefore primarily based on a 
pharmacokinetic bridging approach. In addition to references to the initial marketing authorisation dossiers of 
Perjeta, Herceptin IV and the Herceptin SC line extension, one new non-clinical study was conducted, a 
single-dose PK bioavailability study in Göttingen minipigs (Study 1038750). This approach is generally 
acceptable according to the ICH M3 (R2) guideline (EMA/CPMP/ICH/286/1995) and the guideline on fixed 
combinations (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/ 258498/2005), provided that sufficient documentation of their individual 
and combined use exists. 
Scientific advice on the nonclinical strategy was received from the EMA (EMEA/H/SA/3415/1/2016/III) for PH 
FDC SC. The submitted nonclinical data are in line with the recommendations in this scientific advice. 
The previously performed studies for the already marketed Perjeta and Herceptin IV/SC supporting this 
application have already been assessed and are only summarised in brief where relevant. Additional 
information about the pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicology of the individual approved substance 
can be found in the respective EPARs. Reference to relevant parts of the initial MAA’s for the individual 
compounds were provided by the applicant in the submitted non-clinical overview. It should be noted, that 
the non-clinical overview only consisted of very brief summaries of the previous conducted studies. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
No new pharmacological data was presented by the applicant, which is acceptable, as no harmful 
pharmacodynamic effects was expected for the fixed-combination which has not been seen for the individual 
products applied in free combination. The synergistic effect of the two active substances has additionally 
been described in literature from 2009 by their complementary modes of action (Junttila et al. 2009; Scheuer 
et al. 2009). From the data presented in figure 1 below, it is apparent that combination treatment with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 28/113 
 
  
  
pertuzumab and trastuzumab has a beneficial effect in mice by reducing tumour growth and metastatic 
potential. 
 Figure 1 Pertuzumab+Trastuzumab Combination Therapy in a HER2-Positive Human 
Breat Cancer Xenograf Model 
The cynomolgus monkey was identified as the relevant toxicological species, as pertuzumab and trastuzumab 
bind to human HER2 and monkey ErbB2 with comparable affinity in vitro and neither of the antibodies bind to 
the rodent orthologue, neu.  
No dedicated safety pharmacology studies were performed for PH FDC SC. Safety pharmacological endpoints 
were in accordance with ICH S6(R1) guideline incorporated into the initial pivotal repeat-dose toxicological 
studies for pertuzumab and trastuzumab, respectively. The repeat-dose studies in cynomolgus monkeys did 
not identify any concerns regarding cardiovascular, respiratory, neurologic, or ophthalmic abnormalities for 
either pertuzumab or trastuzumab (MAA’s of Perjeta and Herceptin), and no safety concerns are therefore 
expected for the fixed combination PH FDC SC. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Beside a bioavailability study conducted in minipigs to support SC administration of Pertuzumab + rHuPH20 
with and without co-administration of trastuzumab + rHUPH20, no new studies were conducted to support 
the pharmacokinetics (PK) of PH FDC SC. The PK of the current MAA is therefore to a large degree supported 
by the data from the marketed products Perjeta (IV) and Herceptin (IV/SC line extension). This is an 
acceptable approach according to the guidelines on fixed combination medicinal products 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). 
The applicant has highlighted the most important observations from the PK and TK studies of Perjeta (IV) and 
Herceptin (IV/SC line extension). According to the applicant, IV studies in mice, rats and monkeys have 
shown that the pharmacokinetics of pertuzumab and trastuzumab follows that of other IgG1 monoclonal 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 29/113 
 
  
  
 
 
 
antibodies with similar Fc region (distribution phase less than 1 day, T1/2 of approximately 10 days, Vc of 30 
to 50 mL/kg). However, clearance of pertuzumab is faster in tumour bearing mice compared to non-tumour 
bearing mice.  
Studies of SC administration of trastuzumab co-administrated with rHuPH20 in mice and cynomolgus 
monkeys indicated rapid absorption with Cmax values reached after 7 and 24 h and a bioavailability of 83.4% 
and 100% in mice and monkeys respectively.  
Absorption of SC trastuzumab in minipigs was much faster when co-administrated with rHuPH20 than without 
(changes in Tmax from 72h to 24h). No increases were seen in the absorption rate or absorbed fraction of 
trastuzumab when increasing the rHuPH20 dose above 2000 U/mL and the bioavailability of trastuzumab was 
independent of rHuPH20 co-administration. These findings corresponded to a large degree with the result 
from the pertuzumab SC minipig bioavailability study (report 1038750) addressed below. 
The toxicokinetics of trastuzumab co-formulated with rHuPH20 in the repeat-dose toxicology study in 
cynomolgus monkeys confirms systemic exposure after SC administration (MAA of Herceptin SC line 
extension).   
The minipig bioavailability study (Report 1038750) 
The absorption study in minipigs (“RO5221651 (Pertuzumab) and RO0452317 (Trastuzumab): Bioavailability 
Study following a Single Intravenous or Subcutaneous Administration to the Minipig”) is the only full study 
submitted in order to support this MAA for the fixed-combination product PH FDC SC. The study was 
conducted to support the use of Pertuzumab for subcutaneous administration, in addition to assessing the 
effect of concurrent administration of trastuzumab on SC absorption of both compounds. The study aims to 
fulfill the gaps not covered by the MAA for the already marked products Perjeta and Herceptin for IV and 
IV/SC use respectively. Conduction of the study to non-GLP is acceptable. 
The ELISA assay for determination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab in minipigs is considered adequately 
validated. It should be noted, however, that the assay does not differentiate between trastuzumab or 
pertuzumab when combined, as it binds the Fc region of the antibody which is similar for the two compounds. 
Only the sum of the two antibodies is measured. A test system with the ability of separating the plasma 
concentrations of the two compounds would have been preferred. 
Following subcutaneous administration of 120 mg/animal pertuzumab co-formulated with 2000 U rHuPH20 to 
minipigs, pertuzumab was relatively rapidly absorbed with maximum plasma levels observed at 7 - 48 hours 
post dose (see Figure 3.2.2.1 below, from report 1038750). The average Cmax and AUC(0-672h) values were 
138 μg/mL and 52800 ug. h/mL, respectively (see Table 3.2.2.1 below, from report 1038750). The half-life 
(524 hours) was similar to that following intravenous administration. The average subcutaneous 
bioavailability of pertuzumab was estimated at 73.8%.

Table 3 K parameters of pertuzumab in plasma after single SC administration of pertuzumab (Group2), or 
sequential subcutaneous administrations of trastuzumab and pertuzumab to male minipigs (Group 3) 
Co-administration of trastuzumab had no obvious effect on the SC absorption of both compounds. The 
doubling of the exposure (both Cmax and AUC) after administration of pertuzumab and trastuzumab as 
compared to the administration of pertuzumab alone indicated that the subcutaneous absorption of 
pertuzumab is not impaired by the co-administration of trastuzumab (see Figure 3.2.2.1 and Table 3.2.2.1 
above). However, since the ELISA assay was not able to differentiate between pertuzumab and trastuzumab 
the specific contribution of each compound to the detected increase could not be estimated. 
Subcutaneous sequential administration of pertuzumab and trastuzumab both co-formulated with 2000 U 
rHuPH20 seemed to have a beneficial effect on a more homogenous Tmax of 24 h for all five animals 
compared to the Tmax of 7-48 h of the individual animals in Group 2. A reason for this stabilisation of the Tmax 
Assessment report

has not been discussed by the applicant. The average Cmax and AUC(0-672h) values of total concentration were 
296 μg/mL and 108000 ug.h/mL, respectively. The half-life was 396 hours.  
According to the protocol the injection site was inspected on clinical examinations after the SC injection and 
no specific mentioning of local reaction (adverse or none) was made in the report.  
In conclusion, the study meets the requirements and successfully bridges the gap between the results from 
the already marketed individual products and the results needed to support this MAA of PH FDC SC. Data 
showed that pertuzumab was similarly rapidly absorbed in minipigs after SC administration compared to IV 
administration, and that co-administration of trastuzumab has no apparent effect on the SC absorption of 
pertuzumab. The population kinetic modelling provided concordant data in non-linear mixed effect model. 
The data indicate that in minipigs, the pharmacokinetics of pertuzumab is not adversely impacted in 
combination with trastuzumab and rHUPH20 after subcutaneous administration.  
The lack of distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies is in line with the 
ICH S6(R1) guideline, the guidelines on fixed combination medicinal products 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005) and the justification presented by the applicant. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
As no new single- or repeat-dose studies were conducted for PH FDC SC, the toxicity assessment relied on 
the data presented in the previous MAA of Perjeta and Herceptin (IV/SC). This in line with the ICH M3 (R2) 
guideline (EMA/CPMP/ICH/286/1995) and the guideline on fixed combinations 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005), provided that sufficient experience of concomitant use exists.  
As pertuzumab and trastuzumab have been used clinically in free combinations and as clinical data for the 
fixed combination product has been provided (see clinical part), the experience on concomitant use is 
considered sufficient and the approach taken by the applicant is supported. Additionally, SC administration of 
pertuzumab and trastuzumab in the minipig bioavailability study (Report 1038750) showed that the 
combination of the two compounds was well tolerated.  
The nonclinical studies supporting Perjeta and Herceptin have previously been assessed in support of the 
respective MAA and relevant extensions. Therefore, a detailed discussion will not be provided here. However, 
a few points for consideration have been highlighted below.  
Based on the toxicity results presented by the applicant from the MAAs of the individual products, 
pertuzumab and trastuzumab seem to be relatively well tolerated after both IV and SC administration and no 
safety pharmacology findings (with a particular focus on detection of cardiac toxicity) were detected. IV 
pertuzumab administration has, however, been associated with episodes of diarrhoea without 
histopathological findings in 7 and 26-week repeat-dose studies in cynomolgus monkeys (IV doses ≥ 15 
mg/kg). Diarrhoea has according to the EPAR for Perjeta also been seen clinically, where it is assessed as 
manageable and the combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel in the clinic has according to the EPAR only 
added little toxicity to the adverse event profile (Perjeta EPAR). 
According to the applicant, repeat-dose SC administration of trastuzumab + rHuPH20 (30 mg/kg once weekly 
for 13-weeks) revealed similar exposure as for IV administration in cynomolgus monkeys (25 mg/kg twice 
weekly). 
The omission of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies is acceptable in accordance with the ICH S6 (R1) 
guideline and the fixed combination guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 32/113 
 
  
  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Pertuzumab related changes were seen in an embryo-foetal development study in cynomolgus monkeys 
leading to restrictions in section 4.6 of the SmPC (i.e. women of childbearing potential should use effective 
contraception and Perjeta was not recommended for pregnant women). The same restrictions are included in 
the SmPC for the PH FDC SC fixed-dose combination. In accordance with the fixed combination guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005), it is considered to be acceptable that no new embryo-foetal developmental 
(EFD) toxicity studies are conducted, especially since the before mentioned restriction is included in the 
SmPC of PH FDC SC.  
No findings were observed in trastuzumab EFD toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys. However, clinical 
observations of trastuzumab related EFD changes were identified in post marketing settings questioning the 
cynomolgus monkey as an appropriate model for trastuzumab EFD studies. This is addressed in the SmPC of 
PH FDC SC. 
Systemic maternal and foetal exposure at clinically relevant concentrations were confirmed for both 
pertuzumab and trastuzumab. Transfer of both pertuzumab and trastuzumab across the placenta was 
confirmed in the initial MAAs of the individual products. 
Local Tolerance  
No new dedicated non-clinical local tolerance studies were conducted for PH FDC SC. Generally stand-alone 
nonclinical studies assessing local tolerance are not needed, as local tolerance endpoints should be included 
in the pivotal toxicity studies, if relevant. Two clinical studies confirmed SC tolerability of the final formulation 
of the fixed dose combination. Only slight erythema and bruising (grade 1 in severity) was observed at the 
injection site in the clinical setting.  
Local tolerance of pertuzumab and trastuzumab was assessed in their respective MAAs. For the approval of 
trastuzumab SC with rHuPH20, local tolerance was assessed in a dedicated rabbit study and as part of a 13-
week SC toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. No test item related changes with regards to local tolerance, 
were observed in either study. In addition, local tolerance of rHuPH20 was sufficiently addressed in the MAA 
of the Herceptin SC line extension.  
SC local tolerance of pertuzumab was assessed in a repeat-dose cynomolgus study and by clinical 
observations. Additionally, local tolerance parameters were, according to the study protocol, included in the 
minipig bioavailability study as observations of the injection site. However, no detailed records of these 
observations being performed are included in the study report, nor any summary of findings, or even absence 
of findings are presented. No histological examination was conducted. Nevertheless, it was stated in the local 
tolerance section in the non-clinical overview prepared by the applicant that SC administration of pertuzumab 
was well tolerated in the minipig study. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has submitted a justification for not providing a full ERA. The fixed-dose combination of 
pertuzumab and trastuzumab do not provide an environmental risk, as monoclonal antibodies are readily 
biodegradable. In general, proteins and peptides are exempted from the need to provide an ERA, because 
they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment, in accordance with the "Guideline on the 
environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use" (EMEA, 2006). Additionally, as the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 33/113 
 
  
  
indication for the SC formulation is to substitute the IV administration, no increase in the exposure of 
pertuzumab and trastuzumab is foreseen. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
There is a clear scientific rationale for combining pertuzumab and trastuzumab for the treatment of HER2 
positive breast cancer. Both antibodies target HER2 with different but complementary mechanisms of actions. 
Inclusion of the permeation enhancer rHuPH20 in the formulation to increase absorption of pertuzumab and 
trastuzumab after subcutaneous dosing has been shown not to impair the anti-tumour activity of 
trastuzumab in tumour xenograft model (Herceptin SC line extension). Although not experimentally tested, 
similar effect can be assumed for pertuzumab. To increase the absorption of pertuzumab and trastuzumab 
after subcutaneous administration the permeation enhancer rHuPH20 has also been included in the fixed-
dose formulation.  
Overall, no non-clinical major concerns have been identified during the non-clinical assessment of the fixed-
dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab (PH FDC SC) for SC administration.   
No new pharmacology or safety pharmacology studies were conducted with the PH FDC SC formulation. This 
is acceptable in accordance with the ICH M3 (R2) guideline (EMA/CPMP/ICH/286/1995) and the guideline on 
fixed-combinations (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005), as the efficacy of the two monoclonal antibodies 
administered alone, as well as in free combination, has been established in the already approved individual 
MAAs, as well as by clinical use in free combination. Additionally, a summary of the synergistic effect of 
pertuzumab and trastuzmab on the HER-2 receptor was provided based on available public literature and 
studies submitted in the approved MAA’s of Perjeta (IV) and Herceptin (IV/SC line extension). The 
cynomolgus monkey was identified as the relevant toxicological species based on comparable receptor 
binding affinity to the monkey ErbB2 receptor.      
Beside a bridging bioavailability study in minipigs to support SC administration of Pertuzumab + rHuPH20 
with and without co-administration of trastuzumab + rHUPH20 (Report 1038750), no additional 
pharmacokinetics (PK) studies were conducted with the fixed-dose combination PH FDC SC. As sufficient PK 
data from the individual MAAs exists, this is an acceptable approach according to the guidelines on fixed 
combination medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). 
The minipig bioavailability study (Report 1038750) showed a good absorption with a relatively high 
bioavailability of 73.8% for SC administration of pertuzumab co-formulated with rHuPH20. It was shown that 
after subcutaneous administration antibodies are rapidly absorbed yielding essentially the same Cmax and 
AUC values as after intravenous administration. Inclusion of rHuPH20 does not significantly impact the half-
life. Subcutaneous co-administration of trastuzumab in combination with rHuPH20 had no obvious effect on 
the absorption or exposure of either compound. It is noteworthy that the concentration of rHUPH20 has been 
lower in the nonclinical studies than what is proposed for the fixed dose combination.  
Toxicity of pertuzumab and trastuzumab has been comprehensively characterised in the context of the initial 
MAAs of Perjeta and Herceptin, and of rHuPH20 in the context of subcutaneous line extension of 
trastuzumab, and no new toxicology studies were conducted. This approach is acceptable in accordance with 
the ICH M3 (R2) guideline (EMA/CPMP/ICH/286/1995) and the guideline on fixed combinations 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005), provided that sufficient experience of concomitant use exists. As 
pertuzumab and trastuzumab have been used clinically in free combinations and that clinical data for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 34/113 
 
  
  
fixed combination product has been provided (see clinical part), the experience on concomitant use is 
considered sufficient and the approach taken by the applicant is supported.  
Previously, toxicological and clinical findings of diarrhea have been identified for pertuzumab and clinical 
findings of cardiotoxicity identified for trastuzumab. Furthermore, pertuzumab related changes were also 
seen in an embryo-foetal development study in cynomolgus monkeys and evidence of reproduction toxicity 
was also seen for trastuzumab as well as for rHuPH20. This has been reflected in the SmPC section 4.6 and 
5.3, where relevant restrictions to the use of PH FDC SC in women of child-bearing potential, pregnant and 
lactating women are included. 
The applicant has presented available data regarding local tolerance of both pertuzumab and trastuzumab 
administered alone, as well as data from the bioavailability study of pertuzumab administered SC alone and 
in combination with trastuzumab. Although the reporting of clinical signs of local tolerance (adverse or none) 
appears to have been omitted in the bioavailability study report (report 1038750), the applicant stated in the 
non-clinical overview that the SC administration of pertuzumab was well tolerated and it is indicated in 
several places that the same is true for the sequential SC administration of the pertuzumab trastuzumab 
combination. However, as clinical information supersedes non-clinical information and only grade 1 injection 
site changes were seen in the clinical studies, the lack of traceability of non-clinical tolerability in study 
1038750, is not pursued further. 
It is agreed with the applicant, that the fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab do not 
provide an environmental risk, as monoclonal antibodies are readily biodegradable. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Comprehensive PD, PK and toxicological characterisation of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and rHuPH20 has 
been performed. There is a clear scientific rationale for combining trastuzumab and pertuzumab in the 
treatment of breast cancer and no findings leading to any non-clinical major objections have been identified 
during the non-clinical assessment of the MAA for the fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and 
trastuzumab (PH FDC SC). 
Overall, from the non-clinical perspective, the applicant has provided sufficient documentation and 
justification to support this MAA for the fixed-dose combination product PH FDC SC.

Study BO30185 
Methods 
Study BO30185 was a single dose, Phase I, open label, multi-centre, dose finding study, that consisted of 
two parts. Healthy male volunteers (HMV) were enrolled in the Part 1 of the study, which was intended for 
determining loading and maintenance dose of pertuzumab SC, whereas in the Part 2 of the study, which was 
intended for dose confirmation, females with EBC were enrolled who have completed their (neo)adjuvant 
breast cancer therapy. The overview of the BO30185 study design can be seen in Figure 3

Permeation enhancer rHuPH20 was used in Part 1 and Part 2 of the study. Following concentrations of 
rHuPH20 were used in different cohorts: 0 U/mL (Cohort 1), 2000 U/mL (Cohort 2-7), 667 U/mL (Cohort 8), 
1000 U/mL (Cohort B), and 2000 U/mL (Cohort C). PK samples were collected in the following days for the 
SC administration route: Day 1 (Pre-dose, 6, 8, and 12 hrs post dose), Days 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 15, 22, 43, 85, 
and the follow-up visit. PK samples were collected in the following days for the IV administration route: Day 1 
(Pre-dose and end of infusion, and 3 hrs post dose), Days 2, 3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 35, 43, 85, and the follow-up 
visit. Samples for rHuPH20 plasma concentrations were collected at baseline (pre-dose) and 0.5 and 1.0 
hours post-dose. 
Results 
Forty-eight HMVs were enrolled in Part 1 of the study (six in each Cohorts 1-8). In Part 2, 40 female 
patients with EBC were enrolled (20 patients in each Cohort B and C). Cohort A was not required, since 
feasibility of the PH FDC SC had been demonstrated. The comparison of the approved dosage of IV 
pertuzumab 420 mg (Cohort 1) for EBC with SC pertuzumab 600mg (Cohort 3) showed similar exposure

results, both cohorts consisted of HMVs. Results for pertuzumab and trastuzumab from Part 1 and Part 2 of 
the study are presented below in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively. Based on the results obtained, the 
maintenance dosage of SC pertuzumab 600mg in the PH FDC SC formulation is deemed acceptable. 
The approved IV loading dose of pertuzumab 840 mg was not included in the study as a control. According to 
applicant, an approximately dose-proportional increase of exposure was seen in the study. As a result, the 
loading dose for PH FDC SC formulation was estimated based on dose-proportionality, and it was determined 
to be 1200 mg. This was deemed acceptable in the scientific advice EMA/CHMP/SAWP/791149/2017.

During study BO30185 various concentrations of rHuPH20 were tested. Cohort 8 had higher pertuzumab and 
trastuzumab exposure (higher Cmin and AUCinf) than Cohort 7 despite using lower concentrations of 
rHuPH20 (667 U/mL vs. 2000 U/mL). Whereas Cohort B (rHuPH20 concentration of 1000 U/mL) had similar 
exposure of trastuzumab and pertuzumab to Cohort C (rHuPH20 concentration of 1000U/mL). The MAA chose 
the 2000U/ml concentration of rHuPH20 for the PH FDC SC formulation. The decision to choose this 
concentration was based on the available clinical experience with rHuPH20.

Administration of pertuzumab and trastuzumab as single agents resulted in similar exposure results 
compared to co-mixed and co-formulated administration. As a result, no significant PK interactions are 
expected between these two agents. (see Table 5 and Table 6)

The PPP analysis population comprised 203 patients in the P+H IV arm and 206 patients in the PH FDC SC 
arm, of the 252 (P+H IV arm) and 248 (PH FDC SC arm) patients who were randomised. 
Primary endpoint: The mean and geometric mean Cycle 7 (pre-dose Cycle 8) serum pertuzumab Ctrough 
values were higher in the PH FDC SC arm than the P+H IV arm. The geometric mean for the PH FDC SC arm 
was 88.7 μg/mL compared with 72.4 μg/mL for the P+H IV arm (Table 8 below). The resulting GMR of Cycle 
7 (pre-dose Cycle 8) serum pertuzumab Ctrough, SC/Ctrough, IV values were 1.22 (90% CI: 1.14, 1.31). The 
corresponding lower limit of the two-sided 90% CI of 1.14 was above the pre-specified non-inferiority margin 
of 0.8.

Analytical methods 
The applicant submitted information on performance of the analytical methods used in Studies BO30185 and 
WO40324 to measure pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and rHuPH20, as well as ADAs to them. The methods were 
developed and validated prior to the analysis of clinical study samples and met predefined criteria. Details of 
the assays’ performance are provided in the bioanalytical reports as well as in the method validation reports 
(included in Module 5). 
The applicant reported that the bioanalytical vendor confirmed a calibration error in the assay method for the 
trastuzumab pharmacokinetic (PK) sample analysis resulting in approximately 3% higher reported 
concentration of trastuzumab in clinical samples. Although the corrected PK calculations show only minor 
corrections for Cycle 7 Ctrough, the observed error is much less than the normal trastuzumab PK variability. 
The study conclusions are not impacted by this issue. 
Population PK exposure-response study BO40324 
Population pharmacokinetic modelling and exposure-response analysis were performed. Plasma 
concentrations from the one phase III study FeDeriCa (WO40324) was included in the population PK analysis. 
A total of 5656 plasma samples were taken, out of which 5180 quantifiable samples from 489 patients were 
used in the current final pertuzumab PopPK analysis. 
The PK model that best described the data was a two-compartment model with first-order elimination from 
the central compartment, refer to Figure 5. SC absorption was modelled as a first–order process (see Figure 
below). The PK model was parameterised in terms of clearance (CL), central volume (Vc), intercompartmental 
clearance (Q), peripheral volume (Vp), first-order absorption rate (ka) and bioavailability (F). Inter-individual 
variability (IIV) was estimated for CL, Vc, Vp and F. Due to the limited samples collected during the 
distribution phase and absorption phase, no IIV was estimated for Q and ka.

Using step wise covariate model building, in the forward step, in addition to LBW on CL, Vc, and Vp and albumin 
on CL, Asian (region) was added as significant covariate (p-value <0.01) on CL. No covariate was excluded 
through the backward step and all remained in the final model. 
Parameter estimates for final model 
The equations for the final model are: 
The pertuzumab population PK model parameter estimates are presented in Table 10. 
Table 10 
Pertuzumab population PK model parameters’ estimates 
IIV = inter-individual variability, IV = intravenous, RSE = relative squared error, SC = subcutaneous. Half-life estimate is calculated from 
typical parameter values. The half-life IIV is calculated from post-hoc estimates.  
The effects of LBW, albumin and Region (Asian vs. non-Asian) on pertuzumab PK were quantified in the final 
model. After inclusion of all significant covariates in the final model, IIV was reduced from 27.4% to 23.5% 
for CL, from 35.2% to 34.8% for Vc, from 27.4% to 25.6% for Vp and from 20.2% to 17.8% for F. The 
following covariate parameter relationships were identified: 1. CL increased in patients with higher 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 43/113 
 
  
  
 
 
 
LBW: CL could increase by 22% when LBW is at the 95th percentile while other covariates are fixed to typical 
values. CL could decrease by 34% when LBW is at the 5th percentile; 2. Vc increased in patients with higher 
LBW. Vc could increase by 14.5% when LBW is at the 95th percentile. Vc could decrease by 13.4% when LBW 
is at the 5th percentile; 3. Vp increased in patients with higher LBW. Vp could increase by 12.3% when LBW 
is at the 95th percentile. Vp could decrease by 11.5% when LWT is at the 5th percentile; 4. CL also decreases 
in patients with higher albumin by 6% when albumin is at the 95th percentile and increases by 16% when 
albumin is at the 5th percentile; 5. CL was increased in Asians (12.3%). 
The parameter values estimated in the current popPK model are similar to the ones estimated in 
previously used popPK model described in Garg et al. 20141. However, no bootstrapping was 
performed for the current popPK model evaluation. The applicant argues that bootstrapping was not 
performed for the final model as the standard error of the final model were obtained after the estimation step 
from NONMEM. This issue is not further pursued.  
According to the developed pertuzumab s/c PopPK patients of Asian ethnicity have an increased CL of 
pertuzumab (12.3%). However, the exposure, efficacy and safety results for subjects of Asian ethnicity are 
similar to non-Asians.  
According to MAA, the standard goodness-of fit diagnostics, separated for SC and IV patients, in Figure 6 
show good agreement between predicted and observed pertuzumab concentrations.

One of the issues identified evaluating goodness-of-fit plots is that there was a single low observation, 
diverting the smooth line of the agreement between predicted and observed concentrations. The applicant 
explains, that the estimate did not match outlier criteria throughout the modelling process, and thus was 
retained. It is acceptable, as in general, the model predicts the concentration well, we can see in the top left 
most panel of Figure 2.3.14, that most of the observation lay on the quantile-quantile (QQ) line.  
Absorption  
The Tmax determined in the Phase I study BO30185 was between 4 to 7 days, in HMVs. In the phase 3 study 
in patients, the median time to reach Cmax was 3.82 days. Pertuzumab exposure appeared to increase 
proportionally with SC dose. In both studies, PH FDC SC was administered subcutaneously in the thigh over 5 
- 8 minutes. 
Bioavailability 
The FeDeriCa pertuzumab population PK model is a two-compartment model with first-order subcutaneous 
absorption with estimated bioavailability of 71%. 
Distribution 
The central compartment volume of distribution (Vc) was estimated to be 2.77 L. Vc increased in patients 
with higher lean body weight. Vc could increase by 14.5% when LBW is at the 95th percentile while other 
covariates are fixed to typical values. Similarly, Vc could decrease by 13.4% when LBW is at the 5th 
percentile. 
The peripheral compartment volume of distribution (Vp) was estimated to be 2.49 L. Vp increased in patients 
with higher lean body weight. Vp could increase by 12.3% when LBW is at the 95th percentile while other 
covariates are fixed to typical values. Similarly, Vp could decrease by 11.5% when LBW is at the 5th 
percentile. 
Elimination 
The primary elimination pathways for pertuzumab and trastuzumab are degradation by the reticulo- 
endothelial system (like endogenous IgG) or by target-mediated elimination. Metabolites are amino acids and 
small peptides. 
In the Pop PK analyses, pertuzumab clearance is 0.163 L/day with 23% inter-individual variability. The inter-
compartmental clearance (Q) was estimated to be 0.616 L/day. Clearance was smaller than previous 
estimates for P+H IV pertuzumab (0.163 L/d for current model, 0.235 L/d for previous model). In the 
previous model, the median lean body weight was slightly larger (48 kg in previous model vs. 45 kg in 
present model), and median albumin was slightly smaller (39 g/L in previous model vs. 43 g/L in present 
model). After correcting for these differences, the estimated clearance for the previous model in the FeDeriCa 
population is 0.204 L/d. 
The t1/2 was determined to be 24.3 days in the popPK analysis with 28% inter-individual variability. 
Significant covariates influencing the CL were LBW, serum albumin, and Asian ethnicity (see Table 16)

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In the Perjeta MAA it was demonstrated that pertuzumab has linear PK with respect to dose-proportionality 
and time-independence at a dose range of 2 to 25 mg/kg when weight-based dosing was studied, and from 
an 840 mg loading dose followed by 420 mg maintenance dose to 1050 mg dose when fixed, non-weight-
based dosing was studied. Pertuzumab exposure appear to increase proportionally with SC dose in the Phase 
I study. The dose-proportional data was used to select the PH FDC SC loading dose of 1200 mg. 
After a single injection of 600 mg pertuzumab in the PH FDC SC formulation, the AUCinf of pertuzumab was 
2010 day*ug/mL (mean CV% 25.5). 
In the Phase I study, the loading dose 1200 mg of pertuzumab was not tested in the FDC formulation, only in 
co-mixed formulation. AUCinf of pertuzumab administered in the co-mixed formulation with trastuzumab, was 
4630 day*ug/mL (mean CV% 25.5) and 6160 day*ug/mL (mean CV% 22.7), depending on the concentration 
of the rHuPH20. 
In the FeDeriCa study, mean Cycle 7 AUC0-21 for pertuzumab was determined to be 2530 day*ug/mL (mean 
CV% 26.2). 
Special populations 
Age 
The FeDeriCa pertuzumab pop PK analysis dataset included data from 489 patients with a median age of 51 
years (range: 25−80 years). A total of 446 patients (91.2%, 224 in the PH FDC SC arm and 222 in the P+H 
IV arm) were ≤65 years of age and 43 patients (8.8%, 19 in the PH FDC SC arm and 24 in the P+H IV arm) 
were >65 years of age. Median model predicted pertuzumab Cycle 7 Ctrough for patients ≤65 years was 82.7 
μg/mL versus 80.8 μg/mL for patients >65 years in FeDeriCa study. Figure 7 shows the current final pop PK 
model predicted pertuzumab steady state exposure (Cycle 7 Ctrough, Cmax, and AUC) following administration 
of PH FDC SC or P+H IV by age for all patients in the FeDeriCa PopPK analysis; age had no effect on 
pertuzumab steady state exposure. Following the PH FDC SC administration, median model predicted 
pertuzumab Cycle 7 Ctrough for patients ≤65 years was 88.8 μg/mL versus 90.1 μg/mL for patients >65 years.

Impaired hepatic function 
No dedicated clinical studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment for pertuzumab. The 
FeDeriCa pertuzumab PopPK analysis dataset included the following data: 
•  38 patients (7.8%, 20 in the PH FD SC arm and 18 in the P+H IV arm) categorised with mild hepatic 
impairment  
•  3 patients (0.6%, 1 in the PH FDC SC arm and 2 in the P+H IV arm) categorised with moderate 
hepatic impairment  
•  448 (91.6%, 222 in the PH FDC SC arm and 226 in the P+H IV arm) patients categorised with normal 
hepatic function  
The current pertuzumab final pop PK model indicated no apparent relationship between pertuzumab CL and 
baseline ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and hepatic function category. This is consistent with the previous pop PK 
analysis. Figure 8 shows the current final pop PK model predicted pertuzumab steady state exposure (Cycle 7

Impaired renal function 
No dedicated clinical studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment for pertuzumab. The 
FeDeriCa pertuzumab pop PK analysis dataset included the following data: 
• 158 patients (32.3%, 77 in the PH FDC SC arm and 81 in the P+H IV arm) categorised with mild renal 
impairment  
• 26 patients (5.3%, 14 in the PH FDC SC arm and 12 in the P+H IV arm) categorised with moderate renal 
impairment  
• 305 patients (62.4%, 152 in the PH FDC SC arm and 153 in the P+H IV arm) categorised with normal renal 
function  
The current pertuzumab pop PK model indicated no apparent relationship between pertuzumab CL and CLcr 
or renal function category. This is consistent with the previous pop PK analyses. Figure 9 shows the current 
final pop PK model predicted pertuzumab steady-state exposure (Cycle 7 Ctrough, Cmax, and AUC) following 
administration of PH FDC SC or P+H IV by renal function for all patients in the FeDeriCa PopPK analysis.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No dedicated DDI studies have been conducted. 
Based on data from the previous pivotal phase III WO20698 (CLEOPATRA) study in patients with HER2-
positive MBC, no significant drug-drug interactions (DDIs) were observed between pertuzumab and 
trastuzumab (in the presence of docetaxel), or between pertuzumab and docetaxel (in the presence of 
trastuzumab) were observed.  
Pertuzumab-Trastuzumab PK Drug-Drug Interaction 
In part 1 of study BO30185, two types of Perjeta SC injections were assessed: Perjeta given as a single-
agent injection (for eventual use in co-administration with Herceptin SC single-agent injection) and Perjeta 
SC co-mixed with Herceptin SC in a single injection. If there were a PK interaction between Perjeta and 
Herceptin when co-mixed, the development of PH FDC SC would not be feasible. 
To satisfy an exploratory analysis of a potential PK drug-drug interaction between pertuzumab and 
trastuzumab following administration of the PH FDC SC, a Visual Predictive Check (VPC) and Numerical 
Predictive Check (NPC) approach was applied. 
A comparison of trastuzumab concentrations between HANNAH SC patients and FeDeriCa PH FDC SC patients 
after the first dose is shown below.

There was no apparent impact of trastuzumab on the PK of pertuzumab when the two antibodies were 
delivered SC co-mixed. 
Immunogenicity 
In the phase 1 trial, the overall baseline prevalence for ADAs to pertuzumab and trastuzumab, and anti-
rHuPH20 antibodies was 2/88 patients (2.3%), 6/88 patients (6.8%), and 6/87 patients (6.9%), respectively. 
These data may reflect a combination of pre-existing ADAs and/or untreated positive rate based on the 
statistical design of the assay cutpoints. 
The overall incidence of ADAs to pertuzumab and trastuzumab, and anti-rHuPH20 antibodies in all cohorts 
was 27/88 patients (30.7%), 9/88 patients (10.2%), and 4/88 patients (4.5%), respectively. Exploratory 
analyses indicated that the occurrence of ADAs to pertuzumab and trastuzumab and/or anti-rHuPH20 
antibodies did not appear to impact PK or have any clinical consequences with respect to safety (i.e., 
hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis events). 
In the phase 3 trial (FeDeriCa), the incidence of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) was 
comparable between the P+H IV and PH FDC SC treatment arms. In the P+H IV arm, the incidence of 
treatment emergent ADAs to pertuzumab and trastuzumab was 3.0% (7/237 patients) and 0.4% (1/237 
patients), respectively. In the PH FDC SC FDC arm, the incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs to

pertuzumab and trastuzumab, and anti-rHuPH20 antibodies was 4.8% (11/231 patients), 0.9% (2/232 
patients), and 0.9% (2/225 patients), respectively. The exploratory analyses indicated that the occurrence of 
treatment-emergent ADAs to pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and/or anti-rHuPH20 antibodies did not appear to 
have any clinical consequences with respect to PK, efficacy or safety. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are both recombinant humanised monoclonal antibodies based upon the 
human IgG1(κ) framework sequence composed of two light chains and two heavy chains with functional 
differentiation based on their different CDRs. Via their respective distinct CDR regions, trastuzumab 
recognises sub-domain IV, the juxtamembrane region, while pertuzumab recognises sub-domain II, the 
dimerisation region, of the HER2 extracellular domain. 
Binding of trastuzumab to the HER2 sub-domain IV inhibits ligand-independent HER2 signalling by blocking 
its homodimerisation and prevents the proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular domain subsequent 
constitutive activation of associated intracellular signalling pathways. As a result, trastuzumab has been 
shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumour cells that 
overexpress HER2. 
Binding of pertuzumab to the HER2 subdomain II blocks ligand-dependent heterodimerisation of HER2 with 
other HER family members, including EGFR, HER3 and HER4. As a result, pertuzumab inhibits ligand-initiated 
intracellular signalling supporting cell growth arrest and apoptosis, respectively. 
Pertuzumab and trastuzumab bind to distinct epitopes on the HER2 receptor without competing with each 
other and have complementary mechanisms for disrupting HER2 signalling. This results in augmented anti-
proliferative activity in vitro and in vivo when pertuzumab and trastuzumab are given in combination. 
Additionally, the Fc portion of both their IgG1 framework provides for potent activation of ADCC. In addition, 
in vitro, both trastuzumab and pertuzumab mediate ADCC activity only on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells 
compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No specific PD data were collected in the clinical studies BO30185 and WO40324. Accordingly, only exposure-
response relationships will be described in this section. 
Rationale for pharmacokinetic endpoint Ctrough 
The rationale for Ctrough as a primary endpoint is based on historical in vitro, nonclinical, and clinical data. 
Nonclinical xenograft models have demonstrated that maximum tumour growth inhibition is achieved at 
concentrations of at least 20 µg/mL. 
As Ctrough represents target saturation, demonstrating non-inferiority in Ctrough is to ensure the same degree of 
receptor saturation as IV administration and therefore the same degree of efficacy and comparable safety 
regardless of the route of administration. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 52/113 
 
  
  
 
Based on data from the Phase I Study BO30185, other PK parameters, such as AUC are highly correlated 
with Ctrough, and are therefore expected to be similar between IV and SC administration. Due to slower 
absorption following SC dosing, the Cmax is not expected to exceed the maximum exposure previously 
observed in EBC clinical trials following IV administration. 
Therefore, a dose of pertuzumab and trastuzumab within the PH FDC SC that is statistically non-inferior to 
that of IV administration is believed to maintain the same degree of efficacy observed in studies with P+ H IV 
administration. 
The applicant has received an endorsement for the design of the study and the proposed endpoints during 
the SA procedure EMA/CHMP/SAWP/645161/2016. 
Exposure-response relationship 
The E-R efficacy endpoint evaluated was total pathological complete response (tpCR). The basic exploratory 
plot for efficacy endpoints was tpCR rate versus pertuzumab exposure (Ctrough, AUC), with mean exposure 
and tpCR rate stratified by pertuzumab exposure quartile. The relationships were summarised with simple 
linear logistic regression. Covariate analysis was conducted whenever E-R relationship was observed. 
Covariate analysis was done in a stepwise fashion, using p<0.05 in the forward step and p<0.01 in the 
backward step. 
The exposure-efficacy analyses data set included 243 patients with model-predicted pertuzumab Cycle 7 
Ctrough in the PH FDC SC arm of FeDeriCa study. Five patients were excluded because they were not included 
in the population PK analysis set and did not have exposure estimates. A summary of the baseline covariates 
for patients in the exposure-efficacy data set, overall and by quartile of model predicted pertuzumab Cycle 7 
Ctrough, is provided in Table 12.

Table 13 describes the tpCR data stratified by Cycle 7 Ctrough quartile and shows a slightly higher tpCR rate for 
patients in higher pertuzumab exposure quartile groups. Of note, the baseline characteristics (such as 
albumin, ECOG, clinical stage, hormone receptor status) were well balanced across different pertuzumab 
exposure quartile groups. Positive ERPR hormone receptor status was largest in the second exposure quartile, 
the percentages did not differ significantly across the groups (p=0.19). Between the first and fourth quartile, 
there was a 1.9-fold difference in median Ctrough while tpCR rate increased modestly (8%). For the four 
exposure quartile groups, the difference in tpCR rate from the overall mean tpCR rate in the IV arm ranged 
from -7.6% to 7.4%, respectively, and the 95% CI for all quartile groups included zero. This indicates that 
the tpCR rates in these patients are comparable to P+H IV arm.

Figure 11 shows the univariate logistic regression plot for tpCR in PH FDC SC arm. Multivariate testing 
showed that hormone receptor status (ERPR, oestrogen receptor [ER] or progesterone receptor [PgR]) was a 
statistically significant covariate on the intercept of the logistic regression relationship. Lower tpCR rate was 
observed for patients with positive ERPR. However, after adjusting ERPR status at baseline, there was no 
statistically significant relationship between model-predicted pertuzumab exposure (i.e., Cycle 7 Ctrough) and 
tPCR rate (p=0.069).

Logistic regression of tpCR using the exposure metric Cycle 7 serum pertuzumab Ctrough suggested that 
increased model-predicted pertuzumab exposures were associated with slightly higher rates of tpCR (p = 
0.048). When Cycle 7 serum pertuzumab Ctrough values were stratified into quartiles and correlated with tpCR

rates, minor increases in tpCR rates were observed over the Cycle 7 serum pertuzumab Ctrough quartiles. After 
adjusting the baseline ERPR status, which was identified as a statistically significant covariate on the 
intercept of the logistic regression relationship (lower tpCR rate was observed for patients with positive 
ERPR), there was no statistically significant relationship between model-predicted pertuzumab exposures and 
tpCR rates (p = 0.069). 
All quartiles in the E-R analysis reached concentrations higher than the pre-specified PK/PD target of 20 
µg/mL. Despite the fact that concentrations between quartiles differed, the CIs overlapped, thus suggesting 
similarity in the tpCR rates between different exposure quartiles. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of pertuzumab is in general adequately described. The PK of pertuzumab (and 
trastuzumab) was investigated in one Phase I and one Phase III clinical studies, and a popPK modelling was 
provided. The results give a rather good picture of absorption, distribution, and half-life values. 
The approved IV loading dose of pertuzumab 840 mg was not included in the study as a control. The loading 
dose for PH FDC SC formulation was estimated based on dose-proportionality, and it was determined to be 
1200 mg. This was deemed acceptable in the scientific advice EMA/CHMP/SAWP/791149/2017. 
The applicant chose the 2000U/ml concentration of rHuPH20 for the PH FDC SC formulation. The decision to 
choose this concentration was mainly based on the available clinical experience with rHuPH20.  
The applicant has provided adequate justification that the selected Ctrough is the actual steady state Ctrough.  
The Cycle 7 AUC0-tau for pertuzumab and trastuzumab in PH FDC SC and P+H IV arms are highly comparable 
as it is evident from the GMR and 90% CI, which values are all centred around 1. As a result, the exposure of 
these formulations is deemed comparable. No comparison was done with IV loading doses of pertuzumab and 
SC loading dose in the PH FDC SC. In the Phase III data, it was observed that the mean Ctrough following a 
loading dose is higher in the SC formulation, but not significantly. Due to the fact that no safety concerns 
arise due to increased exposure after a loading dose this concentration difference is deemed acceptable.  
The Cycle 5 Ctrough of trastuzumab in the PH FDC SC arm was lower compared to P+H IV arm. However, due 
to the fact that the Ctrough pre-dose Cycle 8 was non-inferior, and efficacy concerns are not raised, the Cycle 5 
Ctrough is deemed comparable, and the differences clinically insignificant. 
PK Drug-Drug interactions (DDIs) between co-mixed or co-formulated pertuzumab and 
trastuzumab 
Administration of pertuzumab and trastuzumab as single agents resulted in similar exposure results 
compared to co-mixed and co-formulated administration. The applicant had compared the trastuzumab SC 
concentrations from HANNAH and FeDeriCa studies. In FeDeriCa study trastuzumab was administered in the 
FDC SC together with pertuzumab. Thus, the pertuzumab could have influenced the PK of trastuzumab. To 
address this, the applicant took the model from the HANNAH study, where trastuzumab’s PK was modelled 
for it as a single agent, and imputed the data from FeDeriCa study to assess, if the trastuzumab PK still 
follows the same pattern. Based on the GOF plots, VPCs, the observed PK of trastuzumab in PH FDC SC is 
similar to the one predicted by the model based on the HANNAH study. As a result, no significant PK 
interactions are expected between these two agents.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 57/113 
 
  
  
 
Since the drug is administered subcutaneously, no influence of food is anticipated. 
The applicant has performed popPK modelling of data from the clinical programme, using standard 
methodology. One of the issues identified evaluating goodness-of-fit plots is that there was a single low 
observation, diverting the smooth line of the agreement between predicted and observed concentrations. The 
applicant explains, that the estimate did not match outlier criteria throughout the modelling process, and 
thus was retained, which is acceptable. 
According to the developed pertuzumab s/c PopPK, patients of Asian ethnicity have an increased CL of 
pertuzumab (12.3 %). However, the exposure, efficacy and safety results for subjects of Asian ethnicity are 
similar to non-Asians. 
The routes and patterns of excretion were not investigated in detail. This is acceptable considering the nature 
of the product. This is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody of IgG1 protein, and it is not expected 
that this protein should be different from other proteins. 
Patients with impaired liver function were not studied for this application. This is in line with the IV 
formulation which was also not studied in patients with hepatic impairment, this is reflected in the SmPC.  
It was observed that patients with lower LBW and increased albumin concentration resulted in higher PH FDC 
SC exposure. The developed popPK model identified that CL is decreased in patients with higher albumin by 
6% when albumin is at the 95th percentile and increased by 16% when albumin is at the 5th percentile, 
while other covariates are fixed to typical values. Similarly, CL could decrease by 34% when LBW is at the 
5th percentile. However, when analysed according to key safety endpoints, no clear trend of increased SAEs 
or AEs was observed in patients with different LBW or albumin concentration.  
There was an observed numerical difference in the Ctrough depending on the status of the ADAs. The higher 
influence could be inferred in the IV formulation group for pertuzumab, for trastuzumab, in both SC and IV 
groups there was a single patient with ADA. Therefore, given the low numbers, no conclusions can be drawn. 
The patients who developed ADAs reached the target Ctrough concentrations. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Both drugs discussed in this application have a well-known and established MoA. IV formulations of these 
medicines have been widely used. For the exposure-response assessment, the applicant evaluated the tpCR 
with regards to different Ctrough. There was a trend toward a higher tpCR rate with increasing pertuzumab 
Cycle 7 Ctrough in the PH FDC SC arm, which was statistically significant (p=0.048). However, after adjusting 
for baseline estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor (ERPR) status, there was no statistically significant 
relationship between model-predicted pertuzumab exposures and tpCR rate (p=0.069).   
Patients at lower quartile of albumin have a somewhat lower median exposure compared to patients in higher 
albumin quartile. However, when analysed according to tpCR, no impact of lower albumin concentrations was 
found.  
Lean body weight (LBW) has a significant impact on CL. However, the applicant has demonstrated that body 
weight is not a significant covariate for tpCR. Specific studies for drug-drug interactions were not performed 
for the PH FDC SC, and that is deemed acceptable, since neither pertuzumab, nor trastuzumab are likely to 
exhibit DDIs.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The primary endpoint of the FeDeriCa trial was met, indicating that the fixed dose combination of pertuzumab 
and trastuzumab for SC administration (Phesgo) is pharmacokinetically non-inferior to its IV counterparts.

•  Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) prior to initiation of neoadjuvant therapy  
•  Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) prior to neoadjuvant therapy 
•  Serious cardiac illness or medical conditions 
•  Current severe, uncontrolled systemic disease that could interfere with planned treatment (e.g., clinically 
significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, or metabolic disease; wound-healing disorders) 
•  Any serious medical condition or abnormality in clinical laboratory tests that, in the Investigator’s 
judgment, precluded the patient’s safe participation in and completion of the study 
•  Known hypersensitivity to study drugs, excipients, and/or murine proteins 
•  Current chronic daily treatment with corticosteroids (dose >10 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent 
excluding inhaled steroids) 
Treatments 
The investigational medicinal products (IMPs) in this study were Perjeta® IV, Herceptin® IV, Herceptin® SC, 
and PH FDC SC. 
The non-investigational medicinal products (NIMPs) in this study were doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, 
paclitaxel, docetaxel, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and adjuvant hormone therapy. 
Once eligibility for the study was confirmed, the investigator selected one of the two protocol-approved 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens with which to treat the patient. Patients in both study arms received 8 
cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, either: 
•  ddAC x 4 Q2W → paclitaxel x 12 Q1W: Doxorubicin 60mg/m2 IV and cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2 IV, 
Q2W for four cycles (ddAC, Cycles 1-4) with G-CSF support as per local clinical practice. This is followed (2 
weeks later) by paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 QW for 12 weeks; or  
•  AC x 4 Q3W → docetaxel x 4 Q3W: Doxorubicin 60mg/m2 IV and cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2 IV (AC) 
Q3W for 4 cycles (Cycles 1-4). AC is followed (3 weeks later) by docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV, escalating to 100 
mg/m2 IV if no dose-limiting toxicity occurs (at the discretion of the investigator).  
Once the investigator’s choice of chemotherapy was made and eligibility confirmed, the patient was 
randomised to one of the two treatment arms.  
During the neoadjuvant treatment period, P+H IV (Arm A; sequential administration) or PH FDC SC (Arm B) 
was administered Q3W for 4 cycles at Cycles 5-8 concurrently with the taxane component of chemotherapy.  
Loading doses for the first cycle (i.e., study Cycle 5) and maintenance doses for subsequent cycles (i.e., 
study Cycle 6 onwards) were as follows: 
•  Arm A (P+H IV):  loading doses Perjeta 840 mg IV and Herceptin 8 mg/kg IV; maintenance doses 
Perjeta 420 mg IV and Herceptin 6 mg/kg IV 
•  Arm B (PH FDC SC):  loading dose 1200 mg pertuzumab plus 600 mg trastuzumab (15 mL); 
maintenance dose 600 mg pertuzumab plus 600 mg trastuzumab (10 mL) 
Patients in both cohorts were scheduled to undergo surgery after 8 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy, and no 
earlier than 14 days following the last infusion or injection of neoadjuvant therapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 61/113 
 
  
  
After surgery, patients continued to receive the same HER2-targeted therapy in the adjuvant setting (cycles 
9-22) as per randomisation until a total of 18 cycles of HER2-targeted therapy have been given. Treatment 
could be stopped in case of investigator-assessed radiographic or clinical progression, or recurrence of 
disease, or unmanageable toxicity. 
Crossover was not permitted as part of this study. However, patients in the P+H IV arm, from Cycle 9 
onward, could switch from Herceptin IV to Herceptin SC in countries were Herceptin SC was routinely used, 
at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Adjuvant endocrine therapy for patients with hormone-receptor positive disease and postoperative 
radiotherapy were to be given as clinically indicated and as per local practice. 
All patients will be followed until approximately 3 years after the last patient’s last treatment, and the end of 
study is expected approximately 4.5 years after last patient in.

Sample size 
PK sample size calculations were based on the coefficient of variation (CV)% for the Ctrough of trastuzumab 
observed from previous studies in MBC and EBC patients after Q3W treatment. With a CV of 60% assumed, a 
minimum or 130 patients per arm (i.e., a total of 260 patients) was needed to demonstrate Ctrough non-
inferiority with a power of 80% if the true means of the two formulations did not differ by more than 5%. An 
additional 240 patients were also to be recruited to provide a substantial database to assess tpCR and safety 
profile comparability. Therefore, a total of approximately 500 patients (~250 patients per arm) was to 
provide a sufficient sample size to test the primary PK hypothesis as well as assess efficacy and safety profile 
comparability. 
Randomisation 
Patients  were  randomised  using  the  method  of  stratified  permuted  blocks  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  receive  either 
treatment  Arm  A  or  Arm  B.  Accounting  for  the  three  following  stratification  factors,  each  with  two  levels, 
patients were stratified using a fixed block of 6: 
•  Hormonal Receptor Status [Oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive or progesterone receptor (PgR)-positive, ER-
negative and PgR-negative] 
•  Clinical stage at presentation (Stage II−IIIA, Stage IIIB−IIIC) 
•  Type of chemotherapy (ddAC followed by paclitaxel, AC followed by docetaxel)

The study was open labelled 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations: 
• 
Per Protocol PK Analysis Population: The primary and secondary PK analysis were performed on the 
Per Protocol PK analysis population. Patients were assigned to treatment groups as treated. The Per 
Protocol PK analysis population included all patients enrolled who adhered to the protocol. Exclusions 
from the Per Protocol PK analysis population were made for the following reasons: 
o  Patients were missing the Ctrough pre-dose Cycle 8 PK sample. 
o  Patients had a Ctrough sample collected with at least 2 days deviation from the planned date on 
Day 21 (i.e., before Day 19 or after Day 23). 
o  Patients were given a dose amount that deviated from the planned dose by > 20% within 
3 cycles (from Cycle 5). 
o  Patients had a dose delay of more than 7 days. 
o  A subcutaneous injection site other than thigh was used. 
o  Cycle 8 pre-dose and post-dose samples were switched in the IV arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 64/113 
 
  
  
o  There was an assay error impacting Ctrough measurement. 
Excluded cases were to be thoroughly investigated and documented, including the reason for exclusion. All 
decisions on exclusions from the analysis were made prior to database closure. 
• 
Intention-to-Treat Population: All efficacy analyses were performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) 
population. The ITT population was defined as all randomised patients. Patients were assigned to 
treatment groups as randomised. 
•  Safety Analysis Population: The safety analysis population included all patients who received at least 
one dose of study medication (i.e., chemotherapy, Perjeta IV, Herceptin IV, Herceptin SC, or PH FDC 
SC) and was grouped according to actual treatment received. Patients who did not receive any of 
their study medication were excluded from the safety-evaluable population. 
Analysis of pharmacokinetic endpoints: The primary endpoint of this study was the observed pertuzumab 
trough concentration (Ctrough) at Cycle 7 (i.e., the measured pre-dose concentration value at Cycle 8), 
following 3 cycles of Perjeta IV and Herceptin IV or PH FDC SC. The non-inferiority of the SC and IV dose of 
pertuzumab was assessed if the lower bound of the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the geometric mean 
ratio was equal or greater than 0.8. 
The non-inferiority of the SC and IV dose of pertuzumab and trastuzumab were tested in a hierarchical order 
to adjust for multiple statistical testing and control the type I error at a one-sided 5% significance level. 
The following hypotheses were tested: 
•  H0: The SC dose is inferior to the IV dose (i.e., the CtroughSC/CtroughIV geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 
the SC dose relative to the IV dose is not greater than 0.8) versus 
•  H1: The SC dose is non-inferior to the IV dose (i.e. the CtroughSC/CtroughIV GMR of the SC dose relative 
to the IV dose is equal or greater than 0.8) 
The hierarchical testing procedure followed the steps below: 
1. Test the primary endpoint, Cycle 7 pertuzumab serum CtroughSC/CtroughIV, at a one-sided 5% significance 
level. 
If positive, continue to Step 2; otherwise, stop. 
2. Test the secondary endpoint, Cycle 7 trastuzumab serum CtroughSC/CtroughIV, at a one-sided 5% significance 
level. 
The non-inferiority of the SC and IV dose was assessed by a one-sided testing procedure. The null hypothesis 
was rejected and non-inferiority concluded if the lower bound of the 90% CI of the GMR was ≥ 0.8. 
The secondary PK endpoint of this study was the observed trastuzumab trough concentration (Ctrough) at 
Cycle 7 (i.e., the measured pre-dose concentration value at Cycle 8), following 3 cycles of Perjeta IV and 
Herceptin IV or PH FDC SC. The non-inferiority of the SC and IV dose of trastuzumab were assessed using 
the same criteria as for the primary analysis and were tested in a hierarchical order to adjust for multiple 
statistical testing and control the Type I error at a one-sided 5% significance level. 
Type I error control: The type I error is controlled within the two PK endpoints, primary endpoint, Cycle 7 
pertuzumab serum CtroughSC/CtroughIV and the secondary endpoint Cycle 7 trastuzumab serum 
CtroughSC/CtroughIV, with a closed testing procedure. All other secondary and exploratory endpoints will not be 
analysed outside the closed testing procedure and are therefore considered exploratory.

EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 65/113 
 
  
  
Analysis of efficacy endpoint: The main efficacy secondary endpoint was the rate of tpCR in the breast and 
nodes evaluated after surgery following a scheduled 8 cycles of neoadjuvant treatment. Rates of tpCR were 
calculated in each treatment the P+H IV arm and were assessed using the difference between PH FDC SC 
tpCR rate and IV tpCR rate and corresponding 95% Clopper Pearson CIs. The difference between the PH FDC 
SC tpCR rate and IV tpCR rates along with corresponding 95% Hauck-Anderson CIs were also calculated.  
Acknowledging that tpCR is an exploratory endpoint and not type I error controlled, non-inferiority was 
assessed using the criteria that if the lower limit of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval for the difference 
in tpCR rate (using the continuity correction of Anderson and Hauck) was above the non-inferiority margin of 
-12.5% (absolute percentage points), then this could reliably reflect the largest pathologic complete response 
(pCR) difference that could be considered unlikely. The non-inferiority margin of -12.5% in Study WO40324 
(FeDeriCa) is based on Study BO22227 (HannaH) and is consistent with the EMEA guideline (choice of the 
non-inferiority margin, January 2006) which considers -12.5% an acceptable margin, still demonstrating 
clinical benefit of a product. 
Statistical methods used to compare groups for primary outcome(s) include definition of the populations for 
main analysis, error probabilities, adjustment for multiplicity, brief description of the statistical techniques 
used, interim analyses.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The first version of the protocol is dated 2-FEB-2018. There was only one amendment and version 2 is dated 
12-OCT-2018. The main changes to the protocol and their rationale are summarised below: 
•  Sections 3.1, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, 4.1, 4.1.1, and 4.5.10 have been updated to clarify that the size of the tumour 
allowed for entry into the study is > 2 cm and not ≥ 2cm. This change to > 2 cm aligns with Stage II as 
inclusion criteria. 
•  Section 4.1.1 has been changed to give more clarity on “node-positive” and also to clarify that suspicious 
lymph nodes must be confirmed by cytology and/or histopathology. 
•  The observation period for Herceptin SC has been added to Section 4.3.2.1, along with instructions for 
slowing or interrupting the injection if the patient experiences injection-related symptoms, as this was 
missing in Version 1. 
•  Additional instructions have been added to Sections 4.3.2.1, 4.3.2.2, and 5.1.1.1 to allow for extra 
observation time (at the investigator’s discretion, if deemed necessary) after administration of Herceptin 
SC, Herceptin IV, and the fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for SC injection (the 
FDC), taking into account different local requirements for observation time for Herceptin SC and IV. 
•  Sections 4.3.2.3 and 4.3.2.4 have been updated to provide additional guidance for the management of 
hypersensitivity reactions that occur following docetaxel and paclitaxel administrations, respectively. 
•  Sections 4.5.7.2, 4.5.10, and footnote ‘h’ of Appendices 1 and 2 have been updated to clarify that tumour 
staging at baseline is not mandatory and should only be performed if clinically indicated. 
•  Additional details and explanations about the PK sampling process have been added to Section 4.5.9.1, as 
this level of detail was not included in Version 1. Further clarifications on time windows for sampling have 
also been provided in Section 4.5.9.2 and are reflected in updates to Appendices 5 and 6. 
•  The definition for pathological complete response (and evaluation) in Section 4.5.11 has been updated to 
align with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency guidance for industry on 
pCR endpoints. 
•  Symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and/or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 
decline were added as reasons for discontinuing anti-HER2 therapy in Section 5.2.5.1 (Symptomatic LVSD 
and/or LVEF Decline) to align with Section 4.7.1 (Study Treatment Discontinuation). 
•  The guidelines for taxane dose delays and modifications have been updated to provide instructions for 
patients who experience a Grade ≥ 3 enterocolitis event (see Section 5.2.4 and Table 8). 
•  LVEF assessment before surgery has been added to Appendices 1 and 2 to ensure adequate cardiac 
function prior to surgery and avoid risks due to anaesthesia.  
•  Wording was added to Appendices 1-4 to allow for an additional pregnancy test at the Month 7 follow-up 
visit, if deemed necessary by the investigator, due to the 7-month Herceptin wash out period.

SAP amendments 
VERSION 2, 19-JUL-2019: 
Two changes concerning exploratory efficacy endpoints: 
•  Removing Per Protocol PK analysis population from exploratory efficacy analysis in Section 4.5.5: This line 
was to be removed in previous version but due to error was retained in the final version 1. This was 
changed in version 2 to align with initial strategy described in section 4.5. 
•  Addition of text 'the non-inferiority margin' to make the clear that the preestablished non-inferiority 
margin is -12.5% (absolute percentage points). 
VERSION 3, 23-AUG-2019: 
•  Addition of two new exclusion criteria in section 4.1.1 Per Protocol PK analysis population: 
–  If pre-dose and post-dose samples were switched 
–  Assay error impacting Ctrough measurement. 
•  Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency. 
Protocol deviations

Protocol deviations occurred in a similar proportion of patients from both arms of the FeDeriCa trial. Most of 
those deviations were procedural and related to adherence to the protocol-defined schedule of PK 
assessments. 
Baseline data 
Demographics 
All patients except two were female; both males were randomised to the P+H IV arm. Median age was 
51 years (49 years P+H IV vs. 52 years PH FDC SC). The majority of patients were White (65.1% P+H IV and 
66.5% PH FDC SC) or Asian (21.4% P+H IV and 20.6% PH FDC SC). The vast majority of patients had a 
baseline ECOG performance status of 0 (93.3% P+H IV vs. 91.5% PH FDC SC). Overall, 59 patients (11.8%) 
were aged ≥65 years (13.1% P+H IV and 10.5% PH FDC SC), of whom 7 (1.4%) were ≥75 years old 
(3 patients [1.2%] P+H IV and 4 patients [1.6%] PH FDC SC). See Table 15 
The number of pre-menopausal patients was higher in the P+H IV arm (57.1% P+H IV vs. 47.6% PH FDC 
SC); and the number of post-menopausal patients was higher in the PH FDC SC arm (42.1% P+H IV vs. 
52.4% PH FDC SC).

• 
The intention-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomised patients. 
The Safety Analysis population included all patients who received at least one dose of study 
medication, according to the treatment actually received. 
The Per Protocol PK (PPP) analysis population included all enrolled patients who adhered to the pre-
specified criteria in the protocol for PK assessments.

Most patients (242 [96.0%] P+H IV and 234[94.4%] PH FDC SC patients) completed the neoadjuvant 
treatment phase. Of these, 239 in the P+H IV arm and all 234 patients in the PH FDC SC arm underwent 
primary surgery. 
The PPP analysis population was comprised of 203 patients in the P+H IV arm and 206 patients in the PH FDC 
SC arm. Out of the 252 (P+H IV arm) and 248 (PH FDC SC arm) patients randomised, a total of 239 (P+H IV 
arm) and 234 (PH FDC SC arm) had predose Cycle 8 PK measurements. Of these, 36 patients in the P+H IV 
arm and 28 patients in the PH FDC SC arm were excluded from the PPP population due to at least one 
predefined PK protocol violation. The most common reasons for exclusion in both arms were delays in Day 21 
Ctrough sample collection (13 patients in P+H IV arm and 17 patients in the PH FDC SC arm), or due to a dose 
delay of more than 7 days (17 patients in P+H IV arm and 9 patients in the PH FDC SC arm).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary and secondary PK endpoints were presented in detail in the Pharmacokinetics section and 
summarised below. 
Primary endpoint: Serum pertuzumab Ctrough during Cycle 7 (pre-dose Cycle 8); assessed pre-dose on Cycle 
8, Day 1 (up to 21 weeks). 
The geometric mean of serum pertuzumab Ctrough for the PH FDC SC arm was 88.7 μg/mL compared with 
72.4 μg/mL for the P+H IV arm. The resulting geometric mean ratio (GMR) of Cycle 7 (pre-dose Cycle 8) 
serum pertuzumab Ctrough, SC/Ctrough IV values was 1.22 (90% CI: 1.14, 1.31). 
The observed lower limit of the two-sided 90% CI of 1.14, was above the prespecified non-inferiority margin 
of 0.8. 
The coefficients of variation for Cycle 7 (pre-dose Cycle 8) serum pertuzumab Ctrough were 34.1% in the P+H 
IV arm vs. 33.6% in the PH FDC SC arm, showing comparable variability between the two treatment arms. 
Secondary pharmacokinetic endpoint: Serum trastuzumab Ctrough during Cycle 7 (pre-dose Cycle 8) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 74/113 
 
  
  
 
The geometric mean of serum trastuzumab Ctrough for the PH FDC SC arm was 57.5 μg/mL compared with 
43.2 μg/mL for the P+H IV arm. The resulting GMR Cycle 7 corresponding lower limit of the two-sided 90% 
CI of 1.24 was greater than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 0.8. 
The coefficients of variation for Cycle 7 (pre-dose Cycle 8) serum trastuzumab Ctrough were 34.7% in the P+H 
IV arm vs. 37.0% in the PH FDC SC arm, showing comparable variability between the two treatment arms. 
Main efficacy endpoint: Total pathological complete response (tpCR) 
In the ITT population, most patients in both arms achieved tpCR in the breast and axilla and this was 
comparable between the two arms. The tpCR rate was 59.5% (150/252) with 95% CI: 53.18% - 65.64% in 
the P+H IV arm and 59.7% (148/248) with 95% CI: 53.28%- 65.84% in the PH FDC SC arm. This resulted in 
a difference of 0.15% (95% CI: -8.67, 8.97) in the tpCR rate. See Table 19

At surgery, 51.6% of patients in the P+H IV arm and 52.4% of patients in the PH FDC SC arm had no 
residual tumour in the breast. For patients who did not achieve tpCR, the majority had T1 tumours (23.8% 
vs. 24.2%) and N1 status (11.9% vs. 11.3%) in the P+H IV and PH FDC SC arms, respectively. 
At surgery, the most common histopathological type was invasive carcinoma of no special type (27.8% vs. 
26.6%) and most tumours were Grade 2 (14.7% vs. 16.1%), unifocal (38.1% vs. 31.0%) and ≥ 5 mm 
(26.2% vs. 23.4%) in the P+H IV vs. PH FDC SC arms, respectively. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses 
In both arms, the rate of tpCR was higher in patients who were: hormone receptor negative (66.0% and 
70.8%), had Stage II-IIIA disease (61.7% and 61.1%) and who received ddAC followed by paclitaxel (63.3% 
and 66.7%) in the P+H IV and PH FDC SC arms, respectively. See Table 20

Total pathological CR rates were numerically higher for obese patients in the P+H IV arm (63.3% P+H IV vs. 
48.1% PH FDC SC) and for Asian patients in the PH FDC SC arm (48.1% P+H IV vs. 60.8% PH FDC SC). 
In general, tpCR rates were comparable within biomarker subgroups between both treatment arms. tpCR 
rates in HER2 IHC3+ patients were 61.7% (95% CI: 54.08, 68.95) in the P+H IV arm and 63.5% (95% CI: 
55.81, 70.76) in the PH FDC SC arm. In HER2 IHC2+ patients, the tpCR rate was 58.8% (95% CI: 46.23, 
70.63) in the P+H IV arm and 50.0% (95% CI: 38.14, 61.86) in the PH FDC SC arm. Patients with mutated 
PIK3CA had slightly lower tpCR rates compared to those with a non-mutated gene within each treatment arm 
and the tpCR rates were comparable between treatment arms. 
Patients with a higher HER2 gene copy number (i.e., ≥6) had higher tpCR rates compared to patients with a 
lower HER2 gene copy number (i.e., ≥4 and <6) (61.1% vs. 46.2% in the P+H IV arm and 61.5% vs. 37.5% 
in the PH FDC SC arm), and this was balanced across treatment arms.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This is an application for a fixed dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab co-formulated with 
recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20, a permeation enhancer), for subcutaneous administration 
(PH FDC SC). Pertuzumab and trastuzumab in PH FDC SC are identical to those contained in the currently 
approved mono-components Perjeta and Herceptin. This product was developed to offer patients a less 
invasive and faster administration of pertuzumab and trastuzumab compared to IV infusions or SC 
administration of trastuzumab and IV infusion of pertuzumab. 
The proposed indications for PH FDC SC are the same as those approved for pertuzumab in the EU, i.e. in 
combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for early and metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. 
This application is primarily based on a pharmacokinetic bridging approach and efficacy and safety are 
presented as supportive. There is only one clinical efficacy study, FeDeriCa (WO40324), an ongoing pivotal 
Phase III, global, two-arm, open-label, multicentre, randomised study. The applicant submitted also a Phase 
I Study, BO30185, which was performed for dose selection. This study and selected dose for phase III trial 
are discussed in section 2.4. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The overall design of the FeDeriCa trial –targeted population, open-label nature, stratification factors for 
randomisation, definition of primary and secondary endpoints, choice of control arm, chemotherapy 
backbones– has been extensively discussed in scientific advice meetings between 2016 and 2017. As was the 
case with the HannaH study, which led to the approval of trastuzumab for SC administration in 2013, the 
selection of the EBC setting in FeDeriCa allows for a much more homogeneous treatment-naïve population, 
further granting faster delivery of PK, efficacy and safety results. 
It has long been debated whether pCR truly can be a surrogate for overall survival, the most persuasive –
albeit longest to collect– efficacy outcome of Oncology trials, or at least whether it relates to post-adjuvant 
endpoints after curative-intent treatment (IDFS, DFS, EFS). The evolving definition of pCR (e.g. including or 
excluding in situ disease, only considering the breast and not lymph nodes, among others) and other factors 
that increase heterogeneity (e.g. tumour biological profile) have complicated overall agreement. Currently, it 
is considered that tpCR (ypT0/is ypN0), the most widely accepted definition of pCR, can predict survival in 
the most aggressive subtypes of breast cancer, i.e., triple-negative and HER2-enriched. The tpCR comparison 
is exploratory and hence not type I error controlled. The non-inferiority margin of -12.5% in FeDeriCa is 
based on study HannaH (SC vs. IV trastuzumab in EBC) and consistent with EMA guidelines for the choice of 
non-inferiority margin, hence clinically acceptable.

Up to surgery, the study had progressed as expected during the neoadjuvant setting, with very few patients 
withdrawn for conceivable reasons. Recruitment finished faster than anticipated. The updated patient 
disposition tree showed that overall discontinuation of anti-HER2 treatment because of AEs during both 
phases was balanced between treatment arms. 
The low proportion of elderly patients in the FeDeriCa trial seems to reflect the distribution of age of HER2+ 
EBC in clinical practice. 
Upon the CHMP’s request, the applicant was recommended to providing long-term efficacy data from 
FeDeriCa in Q4 2023 (final CSR), noting that an important proportion of patients (98%) is available for 
treatment-free follow-up. 
64 patients (36 patients from the P+H IV arm and 28 from the PH FDC SC arm) were excluded from the PPP 
population due to at least one predefined PK protocol violation. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The distribution of baseline demographic and disease characteristics in the two arms of the study is balanced. 
Although the only two male subjects were randomised to the control arm, extrapolation of overall study 
results to male patients is anticipated. 
Since PK endpoints were prioritised in hierarchical testing, efficacy was assessed as a secondary endpoint. 
Clinical efficacy, as measured by local assessment of tpCR, using the definition recommended by the EMA 
(absence of invasive neoplastic cells in the resected breast and axillary lymph nodes, that is, ypT0/is ypN0), 
showed comparable results in both arms: 59.5% in the P+H IV arm and 59.7% in the PH FDC SC arm, with 
95% CIs almost fully overlapped. Importantly, these data are analogous to similar anthracycline regimens 
with dual HER2 blockade in recent neoadjuvant trials (involving trastuzumab and pertuzumab) that used akin 
pCR definitions (BERENICE, TRAIN-2, GEPAR-SEPTO and TRYPHAENA). Regarding the difference in tpCR rates 
between SC and IV arms (0.15%, 95% CI -8.67, 8.97), the maximum potential efficacy loss (-8.67%) from 
the SC vs. the IV route falls under the clinically acceptable defined threshold of -12.5%. 
Subgroup analysis on tpCR did not identify a particular subgroup of patients with significantly different results 
across arms. As expected, numerically higher tpCR rates were observed in the HR- subgroup vs. the HR+ 
subgroup: 66.0% vs. 55.5% in the P+H IV arm and 70.8% vs. 52.3% in the PH FDC SC arm. Likewise, 
earlier stages (II-IIIA) had also a superior trend to accomplish complete response as compared to more 
advanced stages (IIIB-IIIC): 61.7% vs. 51.0% in the P+H IV arm and 61.1% vs. 54.0% in the PH FDC SC 
arm. Of note, the dose dense scheme (ddAC → paclitaxel) also achieved higher tpCR rates as compared to 
the AC → docetaxel regimen: 63.3% vs. 56.1% in the P+H IV arm and 66.7% vs. 53.1% in the PH FDC SC 
arm. 
Slight variations in the pathological definition of complete response (bpCR and GBG pCR) were consistent 
with the main efficacy outcome. bpCR is a less conservative definition of complete response that only takes 
the breast into account, i.e. regardless of lymph node status. On the other hand, GBG pCR entails a stricter 
definition that excludes responders that have residual carcinoma in situ: only ypT0 ypN0 is regarded as 
complete response. These exploratory efficacy endpoints were not considered for sensitivity analysis for the 
main efficacy endpoint (tpCR). As expected, bpCR exhibited higher rates than tpCR, whereas those according 
to GBG pCR definition were lower. Importantly, the results of each endpoint were comparable between the IV 
and SC arms, hence reflecting the main efficacy analysis.

EMA/CHMP/646782/2020

Overall incidence of ADAs was low and comparable between treatment arms (see Clinical Safety). Due to low 
numbers of ADAs, no conclusion can be drawn on their effect on efficacy. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The main efficacy outcome of the FeDeriCa trial shows comparable tpCR rates between the P+H IV and PH 
FDC SC arms. Although short-term efficacy in the early breast cancer setting can be extrapolated to the 
metastatic setting in the HER2-enriched subtype, the applicant is expected to provide results from the time-
to-event endpoints (final CSR from FeDeriCa expected in Q4 2023). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Both trastuzumab (IV and SC formulation) and pertuzumab (IV formulation only) are EMA-approved anti-
HER2 treatments with a known safety profile and extensive post-marketing PSUR follow-up.  
The main safety concern from trastuzumab is congestive heart failure (CHF) and asymptomatic cardiac 
dysfunction. Hence all candidates for treatment with this drug, especially those with prior anthracycline and 
cyclophosphamide exposure, should undergo baseline cardiac assessment including left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) determination. Other common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from trastuzumab are infusion-
related reactions, haematotoxicity (in particular neutropenia), infections and pulmonary events (i.e. 
interstitial lung disease). The safety profile of trastuzumab SC is consistent with the known safety profile for 
trastuzumab IV with no new safety findings.  
Pertuzumab (IV formulation) is only licensed for use in combination with trastuzumab, thus its potential 
adverse reactions must be always considered as an addition to those from trastuzumab. The most common 
ADRs (≥30%) from pertuzumab are diarrhoea, alopecia, nausea, fatigue, neutropenia, and vomiting. 
In the context of a full marketing authorisation application, the applicant has submitted PK, efficacy and 
safety data for pertuzumab/trastuzumab fixed dose combination for subcutaneous injection (PH FDC SC) in 
the currently approved therapeutic indications for pertuzumab IV.  
The safety evaluation of PH FDC SC to treat patients with HER2+ BC is based on data from two clinical 
studies: FeDeriCa (phase III) and study BO30185 (phase I), both done in the EBC setting and summarised in 
Table 24 below. Owing to differences in trial design, it was not considered clinically meaningful to pool the 
safety data from the two studies. The main focus of the safety assessment will be FeDeriCa study.

The safety population of FeDeriCa is constituted by 252 patients from the P+H IV arm and 248 patients from 
the PH FDC SC arm. 
The  primary  analysis  in  the  pivotal  FeDeriCa  study  was  conducted  once  all  patients  had  completed  the 
neoadjuvant therapy and underwent surgery (clinical cut-off date 04-JUL-2019).  
Upon request, the applicant provided an updated safety database once all patients from the trial have 
finished receiving adjuvant anti-HER2 treatment, with a cut-off date 10-JUL-2020. The following safety 
assessment focuses on this late database, since it allowed for comparing safety performance of both arms 
along the adjuvant phase, where dual HER2-targeted treatment is no longer confounded by chemotherapy. 
Patient exposure 
The median number of cycles to anti-HER2 to treatment was 18 cycles for both the P+H IV and PH FDC SC 
arms (range: 1-18 cycles for both arms), which is in line with the expected number of cycles as per protocol 
(up to max. 18 cycles).

frequently in older patients 
The incidence and severity of AEs seems balanced between the IV and SC arms of FeDeriCa across categories 
of age, region and race, although patients ≥ 65 years have a higher risk to develop diarrhoea in both arms 
(67% vs. 55% in patients < 65 years).  
Safety in patients ≥ 75 years is limited to data from 7 out of 500 patients, but this has been clarified at the 
SmPC. It is expected that long-term safety in elderly patients should remain comparable to their younger 
counterparts, but this will be confirmed by follow-up data to come. 
Data provided by the applicant suggests that no dose adjustments are needed for the new fixed-dose 
combination in patients with low and high body weight. 
Data in patients with moderate renal impairment is limited but suggests that no dose adjustments of Phesgo 
are necessary. Concerning hepatic impairment, no studies have been done, hence no specific dose 
recommendations can be made for these patients.

timepoint: ITT population (FeDeriCa) 
At this point, the incidence of ADAs and NAbs in both arms of the study is too low to assess their potential 
impact on efficacy and safety. However, the applicant has guaranteed that more immunogenicity data are 
expected through an Integrated Summary of Immunogenicity to be submitted in February 2021. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There was no evidence of drug-drug interactions between pertuzumab and trastuzumab when administered 
as the PH FDC SC formulation (FeDeriCa study) nor when administered as a co-mixed formulation in study 
BO30185 Part 1.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of trastuzumab is extensively documented and most Breast Oncologists are acquainted with 
its toxicities and how to handle them, particularly concerning heart failure and other forms of cardiac 
dysfunction. The addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab-based regimens in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant and 
metastatic settings of HER2+ breast cancer proved to improve efficacy without significantly compromising 
safety, with diarrhoea as main adverse event.  
The safety objective of the FeDeriCa trial was to compare the incidence and severity of AEs between its two 
arms: P+H IV (n=252) and PH FDC SC (n=248). Of note, the study involved the administration of 4 cycles of 
pertuzumab + trastuzumab (IV or SC) combined with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant phase and the 
remaining 14 cycles –without chemotherapy– in the adjuvant phase. At the initial submission, with a cut-off 
date 4-JUL-2019, safety results mainly concerned the neoadjuvant phase. 
Upon request, the applicant provided an updated safety database once all patients from the trial had finished 
receiving anti-HER2 treatment, with a cut-off date 10-JUL-2020. According to exposure tables, the median 
number of cycles of pertuzumab + trastuzumab in both arms is 18, whereas median dose intensity remained 
at 100%. 
AEs: The overall distribution of AEs, G3/4 AEs, G5 AEs, serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation across 
the neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases is comparable between the IV and SC arms of this open-label trial. 
Importantly, the proportions of each subcategory of AEs correspond to those seen in similar trials with dual 
HER2-blockade plus chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting of HER2+ EBC. 
As expected, the only notable imbalance between arms corresponds to infusion/administration related 
reactions, with higher proportion of any grade events in the SC arm (22% vs. 15% in the IV arm), which 
occurred predominantly in the adjuvant phase.  
The most common AEs (incidence ≥ 5%) occurred with similar frequency between arms. Evidently, typical 
AEs from chemotherapy (alopecia, nausea/vomiting, asthenia/fatigue, stomatitis, neutropenia, myalgia, 
peripheral sensory neuropathy) were more prevalent in the neoadjuvant phase of the trial. 
AEs with significant incidence in the adjuvant phase in both arms of FeDeriCa included diarrhoea (21% IV, 
17% SC); arthralgia (21% IV, 18% SC); and radiation skin injury (21% IV, 20% SC). Since arthralgia can be 
attributable to adjuvant endocrine treatment and radiation skin injury to adjuvant radiotherapy, it seems that 
diarrhoea was the main AE attributable to anti-HER2 treatment in the adjuvant phase. 
G≥3 AEs: A little over half of the patients of each arm experimented G≥3 AEs across both phases of the 
study (59% IV, 54% SC). In the adjuvant phase, these high-grade AEs occurred more frequently in the IV 
arm (15% vs. 11% in the SC arm). With the exception of G3/4 diarrhoea (13 patients in the IV arm vs. 18 in 
the SC arm), G3/4 AEs with the highest incidence were of haematological nature and thus attributable to 
concomitant chemotherapy during the neoadjuvant phase. G3/4 cardiac events across both phases were 
reported in very few patients, 1 from the IV arm and 3 from the SC arm. 
SAES: The proportion of patients who suffered SAEs were similar in the IV (20%) and SC (19%) arms across 
both phases of the trial. Most SAEs occurred in the neoadjuvant phase and were of haematological (like 
attributable to the chemotherapy backbone) or infectious nature.  
In the adjuvant phase there were 8 patients with SAEs in the IV arm and 10 in the SC arm. From these, 2 
patients in the IV arm and 3 in the SC arm were serious cardiac failure events. There were 2 events of 
serious diarrhoea in the IV arm and 1 in the SC arm, all in the neoadjuvant phase.

EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 100/113 
 
  
  
Deaths: In the primary analysis and 4-month safety update from FeDeriCa (data cut-off 4-NOV-2019) one 
death in each arm had been reported, both in the neoadjuvant phase:  
-An elderly patient from the P+H IV arm who died from urosepsis after 2 cycles of P+H and 5 doses of 
paclitaxel.  
-An elderly patient from the PH FDC SC arm who died from an acute myocardial infarction after 2 cycles of 
ddAC and before any anti-HER2 treatment. 
The updated safety database with data cut-off on 10-JUL-2020 reports 6 additional deaths: 2 in the IV arm 
and 4 in the SC arm. 1 patient in the IV arm and 3 in the SC arm died from progressive disease in the follow-
up phase of the trial. The other 2 patients died during the adjuvant phase: 1 patient from the IV arm died 
from cardiac failure related to anti-HER2 treatment and 1 from the SC arm died from sudden dyspnoea after 
hospitalisation for pneumonia.   
Overall, it appears that only the patient who died from cardiac failure (NYHA class IV) in the IV arm from 
FeDeriCa suffered a G5 AE directly related to anti-HER2 treatment. 
AESIs: Diarrhoea, likely associated to both taxanes and pertuzumab, occurred in about 60% of patients from 
each arm, although mostly low-grade and manageable, not leading to the suspension of anti-HER2 treatment 
in any patient. G3/4 diarrhoea occurred in 5% of patients from the IV arm and 7% of the SC arm, 
predominantly in the neoadjuvant phase of the trial. 
Cardiac toxicity, the main safety concern of dual HER2-blockade, was similar between arms and as expected, 
but led to discontinuing anti-HER2 treatment in 10 patients from the IV arm [8 from ejection fraction 
decreased (EFD) and 2 from cardiac failure)] and 5 from the SC arm (2 and 3, respectively). The overall 
behaviour of LVEF across both phases of the trial is comparable between the two arms. 
2 primary cardiac events (NYHA class III/IV heart failure with EFD<50% or cardiac death) occurred in the IV 
arm vs. 4 in the SC arm, whereas secondary cardiac events (NYHA class II heart failure) prevailed in the IV 
arm (18 vs. 12 in the SC arm). Of note, the overall incidence of EFD events in both arms was considerably 
higher in the late adjuvant phase of the trial: confirmatory assessment seems to have happened in the 
follow-up period.  
Interstitial lung disease events, although rare (3 in the IV arm and 5 in the SC arm) and mild (none G≥3), 
led to permanent withdrawal of HER2-targeted therapy in 1 patient from the IV arm and 2 from the SC arm. 
Infusion/administration related reactions: Reasonably, reactions related to the administration route of anti-
HER2 treatment differed considerably between arms: while systemic G1-3 related reactions prevailed in the 
IV arm (11% vs. 0.8% in the SC arm), local injection site events were predominant in the SC arm (16% vs. 
0.4% in the IV arm). However, hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis events were rare, occurring in 4 patients from 
each arm. Both trastuzumab and pertuzumab were discontinued in one patient from each arm because of 
anaphylaxis during or immediately after administration. 
Discontinuations: The majority of patients from both arms of FeDeriCa completed the intended 18 cycles of 
dual HER2-targeted treatment in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases. As explained earlier, withdrawal of 
pertuzumab and/or trastuzumab due to AEs during both phases was balanced between arms (15 vs. 12 
patients, respectively). The main reason for anti-HER2 treatment discontinuations in both arms was cardiac 
events such as EFD or cardiac failure (10 patients in the IV arm, 5 in the SC arm). In the IV arm, 
discontinuations due to AEs occurred predominantly in the adjuvant phase, whereas in the SC arm they were 
balanced between both phases. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 101/113 
 
  
  
Special populations: The incidence and severity of AEs seems balanced between the IV and SC arms of 
FeDeriCa across categories of age, region and race, although patients ≥ 65 years have a higher risk to 
develop diarrhoea in both arms (67% vs. 55% in patients < 65 years). Safety in patients ≥ 75 years is 
limited to data from 7 out of 500 patients, but this has been clarified at the SmPC.  
Data in patients with moderate renal impairment is limited but suggests that no dose adjustments of Phesgo 
are necessary. Concerning hepatic impairment, no studies have been done, and therefore no specific dose 
recommendations can be made.  
Immunogenicity: The incidence of ADAs and NAbs in both arms of the study is too low to assess their 
potential impact on efficacy and safety at this point. The applicant has committed to providing more 
immunogenicity data through an Integrated Summary of Immunogenicity in February 2021 (see RMP). 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Given the accepted PK-bridging (supported by the similarity of safety profile in FEDERICA and the IV safety 
database), the safety database for Phesgo is understood to be the totality of data from the pooled studies 
CLEOPATRA, NEOSPHERE, TRYPHAENA, APHINITY, and FEDERICA. The CHMP recommended to provide post-
approval an updated ADR table for SmPC 4.8 displaying such ADR frequencies. 
Except for AEs related to route of administration, the safety profile of Phesgo (pertuzumab + trastuzumab 
fixed dose for SC administration) across the neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases of the FeDeriCa trial is 
comparable to its IV counterparts, with no new safety signals identified. Chemotherapy-related AEs were 
prevalent in the neoadjuvant phase of the trial. AEs related to anti-HER2 treatment were more prevalent in 
the adjuvant phase, among which diarrhoea and cardiac events were most frequent, although with incidence 
and severity comparable to other trials in similar EBC settings.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2.1 is acceptable.  
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
Assessment report

Page 107/113 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 29.06.2020. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.8.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
The QRD Group accepts the request for use of minimum particulars on the vial labels, however regarding the 
complete omission of the pharmaceutical form, the Group asked that at least the short pharmaceutical form 
(i.e., injection) is displayed on the labels. If the mock-ups assessment concludes that the inclusion of the 
term is not possible without compromising the readability of the labels, then the omission can eventually be 
acceptable. 
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will, however, be included in 
the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website and translated in all languages, but will appear in grey-
shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.  
2.8.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Phesgo is included in the additional monitoring list 
as it contains a biological product which is not a new active substance and authorised after 1 January 2011.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant has developed a new product containing pertuzumab and trastuzumab in one fixed-dose 
combination for SC injection –Phesgo, PH FDC SC– and seeks approval in the same indications as those that 
pertuzumab (IV) holds in the EU: in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for the treatment of 
early (neoadjuvant and adjuvant) and metastatic HER2+ breast cancer. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Trastuzumab and pertuzumab in their IV formulation have been approved and available in the market for a 
number of years, with a consolidated role in the treatment of HER2+ breast cancer. Trastuzumab SC was 
developed subsequently and proven non-inferior and as safe as its IV predecessor, receiving approval for 
marketing in the EU in September 2013. 
PH FDC SC, as a fixed non-weight-based dose, is intended for subcutaneous administration, and was 
developed to offer patients a less invasive and faster administration of pertuzumab and trastuzumab as a 
single product compared to individual IV infusions. In turn, this should reduce the strain on medical centres 
with respect to time and resources required to prepare and administer IV therapy. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant submitted data from the primary analysis of the FeDeriCa trial, an ongoing Phase III, open-
label, multicentre study that investigated the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of PH FDC SC compared 
with P+H IV, in combination with chemotherapy, in 500 subjects with HER2-positive early breast cancer in 
the neoadjuvant/adjuvant settings. The primary objective of the study was to prove the pharmacokinetic 
non-inferiority of the SC vs. the IV formulation of the drugs. Efficacy and safety were secondary objectives. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
•  The primary endpoint of the study was met, since the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of Cycle 7 (pre-dose 
Cycle 8) serum pertuzumab Ctrough SC/Ctrough IV was 1.22 (90% CI: 1.14, 1.31). The lower limit of the two-
sided 90% CI of 1.14 was above the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 0.8. 
•  The PH FDC SC yields pre-dose Cycle 8 Ctrough concentrations of trastuzumab that are non-inferior to the 
concentrations  seen  in  the  IV  administration  of  the  two  agents.  Furthermore,  trastuzumab  PK  was  not 
altered by co-formulation with pertuzumab. 
•  Key  efficacy  endpoint:  the  proportions  of  locally  assessed  tpCR  in  both  arms  of  the  FeDeriCa  trial  are 
comparable:  59.5%  in  the  P+H  IV  arm  and  59.7%  in  the  PH  FDC  SC  arm,  with  nearly  matching  and 
considerably  overlapping  95%  confidence  intervals.  These  results  are  analogous  to  similar  anthracycline 
regimens with dual HER2 blockade in recent neoadjuvant trials that used akin pCR definitions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 109/113 
 
  
  
• 
tpCR rates are similar across most subgroups of both arms, particularly concerning the stratification factors 
used for randomisation. 
•  Exploratory analyses, including bpCR, GBG pCR were consistent with the main efficacy results. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
•  64 patients (36 patients from the P+H IV arm and 28 from the PH FDC SC arm) were excluded from the 
PPP population due to at least one predefined PK protocol violation. The exclusion of 14% of patients 
from PK analysis brings some uncertainty to results from the PK endpoints.  
• 
Long-term efficacy data from FeDeriCa study, from prospective time-to-event endpoints, is expected – 
final CSR from the trial anticipated in Q4 2023. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
•  The overall distribution of AEs, G3/4 AEs, G5 AEs, serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation across the 
neoadjuvant  and  adjuvant  phases  is  comparable  between  the  IV  and  SC  arms  of  this  open-label  trial. 
Importantly, the proportions of each subcategory of AEs correspond to those seen in similar trials with dual 
HER2-blockade plus chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting of HER2+ EBC. 
•  Diarrhoea was reported in about 60% of patients from each arm. G3/4 diarrhoea occurred in 13 patients 
from the IV arm and 18 from the SC arm.  
•  Cardiac dysfunction events (e.g. peripheral oedema, EF decreased, nocturnal dyspnoea) were predominantly 
low  grade  (G1/2)  and  balanced  across  arms.  Overall,  incidence  and  type  of  cardiac  toxicity  events  were 
comparable between arms and as expected for dual HER2-blockade in the neoadjuvant setting, but led to 
withdrawal of anti-HER2 treatment in 15 patients (10 IV, 5 SC). 
•  The proportion of patients who suffered SAEs were similar in the IV (20%) and SC (19%) arms of the trial. 
Most SAEs were of haematological (like attributable to the chemotherapy backbone) or infectious nature.  
•  Only one patient (IV arm) seems to have died from cardiac failure related to anti-HER2 treatment. 
•  The  frequency  and  type  of  reactions  related  to  the  administration  route  of  anti-HER2  treatment  differed 
considerably between the IV and SC arms. Systemic reactions (G1-3) were more frequent in the IV arm 
(11% vs. 0.8% in SC arm), whereas local injection site events occurred more in the SC arm (16% vs. 0.4% 
in the IV arm). Most of the local site reactions to PH FDC SC were injection site pain or erythema and none 
led to discontinuation of the drug. 
•  The incidence and severity of AEs seems balanced between the IV and SC arms of FeDeriCa across categories 
of age, region and race, though higher risk for diarrhoea was seen in patients ≥65 years. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
•  No studies have been done in patients with hepatic impairment, so no specific dose adjustment is 
recommended (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 110/113 
 
  
  
• 
The incidence of ADAs and NAbs in both arms of the study is too low to assess their potential impact on 
efficacy and safety at this point. The applicant has committed to provide more immunogenicity data 
through an Integrated Summary of Immunogenicity in February 2021 (see RMP).

3.1.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.1.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Upon results from the FeDeriCa trial, the applicant proposes to extrapolate the approved pertuzumab 
indications –early and metastatic settings of HER2+ breast cancer– to a new fixed dose combination of 
pertuzumab and trastuzumab for subcutaneous (SC) administration to be marketed as Phesgo. 
The new subcutaneous fixed-dose formulation of trastuzumab in combination with pertuzumab is not a new 
therapeutic innovation and does not change breast cancer treatment protocols except for the convenience of 
the new route of administration.  
The analysis of PK parameters shows that PH FDC SC is overall non-inferior to the same combination 
administered via the IV route, although the exclusion of 14% of patients from PK analysis brings some 
uncertainty to results from the PK endpoints. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/646782/2020 
Page 111/113 
 
  
  
 
 
Efficacy in terms of locally-assessed tpCR after neoadjuvant treatment is also comparable between both SC 
and IV arms, but the eventual support from prospective time-to-event endpoints –final CSR from the trial 
anticipated in Q4 2023– is expected. 
The structure of the submitted clinical safety data is considered adequate for safety evaluation of PH FDC SC, 
entailing both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases of the trial. Overall, the safety profile of Phesgo across 
both phases of the trial is considered comparable to its IV counterparts, noticing obvious differences in AEs 
related to the route of administration. The incidence and severity of cardiac dysfunction events and 
diarrhoea, the main AEs related to dual-HER2 blockade, was comparable to similar trials in HER2+ EBC. 
Because of low incidence, the role of ADAs to any of the components of PH FDC SC is still unclear. 
3.1.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Data from the neoadjuvant phase of the FeDeriCa trial indicate that the fixed dose combination of 
pertuzumab and trastuzumab for SC administration (Phesgo) is pharmacokinetically non-inferior to its IV 
counterparts. Early efficacy results from both arms are similar and ensure long-term follow-up for time-to-
event endpoints. The safety profile of Phesgo across the neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases of FeDeriCa is 
comparable to pertuzumab + trastuzumab for IV administration. 
3.1.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.2.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Phesgo is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus decision 
that the benefit-risk balance of Phesgo is favourable in the following indication: 
Early breast cancer (EBC): 
Phesgo is indicated for use in combination with chemotherapy in:  
• the neoadjuvant treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, inflammatory, or early 
stage breast cancer at high risk of recurrence

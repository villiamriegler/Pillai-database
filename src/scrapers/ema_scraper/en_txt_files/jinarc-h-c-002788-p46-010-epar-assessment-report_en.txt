Study 156-102-00123: a Phase 3, Multicenter, Open-label, Dose-defining Trial to Investigate 
the Efficacy, Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Tolvaptan in Pediatric Heart Failure 
Patients With Volume Overload. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study 156-102-00123 - A Phase 3, Multicenter, Open-label, Dose-defining Trial to Investigate the 
Efficacy, Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Tolvaptan in Pediatric Heart Failure 
Patients With Volume Overload. 
Description 
This was a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled, dose-titration trial to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of tolvaptan in male and female pediatric heart failure patients with volume overload 
despite having received conventional diuretic therapy. Pediatric patients aged 6 months to less than 15 
years were included. The target number of subjects for receiving tolvaptan was set at 60. A basic trial 
design schematic is shown in Figure 9.1-1. 
After completion of a screening examination, subjects were hospitalized prior to the evening meal on 3 
days before start of tolvaptan administration. Tolvaptan administration was started at 0.05 mg/kg/day, 
and subjects with sufficient increase in urine volume continued administration at 0.05 mg/kg/day for 3 
days. For subjects whose urine volume did not sufficiently increase (see below for study rule 
specifications), the dose was increased to 0.15, 0.3, or 0.5 mg/kg/day according to the specification. 
In that case, the dose was decided for each individual subject to obtain sufficient increase in urine 
volume, and administration at the decided dose was continued for 3 days. When the dose was 
increased to 0.5 mg/kg/day, administration at 0.5 mg/kg/day was continued for 3 days. After final 
tolvaptan administration, subjects continued to be hospitalized for 2 days, so that their condition could 
be monitored. Subjects also underwent the follow-up 5 to 7 days after final tolvaptan administration. 
Methods 
Study participants 
The target patients were divided into 3 age groups (6 months to less than 2 years, 2 years to less than 
7 years, and 7 years to less than 15 years).

Treatments 
Subjects took tolvaptan 1% granules or tolvaptan 15 mg tablet with water once daily after breakfast.  
The dose of tolvaptan 1% granules to be administered was determined depending on the subject’s 
body weight on the day before start of tolvaptan administration; however, the maximum dose was 15 
mg/day even if the calculated dose exceeded 15 mg/day. For administration at the maximum dose of 
15 mg, tolvaptan 15-mg tablet was allowed to be administered in place of tolvaptan 1% granules. 
The initial dose of tolvaptan was 0.05 mg/kg/day. From the second day of the treatment period and 
onward, if necessary the dose could be increased to 0.15, 0.3, or 0.5 mg/kg/day according to the 
increase in urine volume. Decision on up-titration was based on daily urine volume. Dose increase was 
considered in cases of “insufficient increase in urine volume” when it was less than 150% of that for 
the pretreatment observation period (one day before the start of tolvaptan administration), while 
“sufficient increase in urine volume” was at least 150%. The dose decided for each individual subject 
was administered for 3 days. and then the dose decided for each individual subject was administered 
for 3 days. 
Objective(s) 
Primary: To determine the efficacy, safety, and dose and regimen of tolvaptan in pediatric heart failure 
patients with volume overload. 
Secondary: To determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of tolvaptan when 
administered to pediatric heart failure patients with volume overload. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
The percentage of subjects who satisfied the following condition: 
- Body weight on the day after the third day of treatment with tolvaptan at the evaluation dose was 
decreased by 1.7% or more from the weight measured before breakfast on the first day of the 
treatment period (the initial tolvaptan administration day). 
However, the mean daily urine volume for the 3 days of treatment with tolvaptan at the evaluation 
dose had to be higher than the daily urine volume for the pretreatment observation period. For 
subjects who discontinued treatment with tolvaptan, the mean daily urine volume up to the time of 
discontinuation had to be higher than the daily urine volume for the pretreatment observation period. 
Secondary Endpoints 
- Body weight 
- Edematous symptoms (edema [lower limbs, eyelids, etc], dyspnea, jugular venous distension, 
pulmonary congestion, cardiothoracic ratio, respiration rate at rest, pulse rate, and pleural effusion), 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

central venous pressure (only subjects with central venous catheterization), and retention of 
pericardial effusion (only subjects requiring echocardiography to confirm retention of pericardial 
effusion prior to tolvaptan administration) 
- Daily urine volume 
Sample size 
For the primary endpoint, the required sample size was set by first setting the threshold value for 
assessment of efficacy, and then using binomial distribution to determine the number of subjects 
required to maintain a 90% or higher probability that the lower limit of the 95% CI for the percentage 
of subjects achieving the primary endpoint above the threshold value. 
As reference information for the threshold value and binomial distribution parameter required to set 
the sample size for the trial, a threshold of 0.3 and a binomial distribution parameter of 0.5 to 0.6 
were used based on interviews with clinicians, since no clinical trial results for administration of 
tolvaptan in pediatric patients have been obtained either in Japan or other countries. 
Based on the above, the required number of subjects was calculated to be a minimum of 68 for a 
parameter of 0.5 and a minimum of 30 for a parameter of 0.6. A sample size of 30 to 68 subjects was 
therefore considered to be appropriate, and in view of feasibility the number of subjects for the trial 
was set at 60. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Not applicable 
Statistical Methods 
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the IMP and have 
postdose data on body weight and daily urine volume. 
The dose maintenance analysis set includes all subjects who received administration at same dose for 
at least 3 days in the full analysis set. 
The safety analysis set (SAS) includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the IMP. 
The pharmacokinetic analysis set includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the IMP and 
have postdose data on drug concentration. 
The pharmacodynamic analysis set includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the IMP and 
have postdose pharmacodynamic data. 
For the primary endpoint analysis, the number and percentage of subjects as well as the exact 95% CI 
based on binomial distribution were calculated. The same calculations were performed for body weight 
on the day after the final administration at the evaluation dose and the day after the final 
administration. The number and percentage of subjects was also calculated for each time point after 
the start of administration at the evaluation dose (the data to be summarized are from the first day of 
administration at the evaluation dose to the day after the final administration at the evaluation dose 
and follow-up period; the same shall apply hereinafter). 
Similar calculations were performed for the percent change in body weight as secondary endpoint. For 
edematous signs, a shift table was prepared for changes in the degree of edema (lower limbs) from 
baseline to the third day of administration at the evaluation dose, the day of the final administration at 
the evaluation dose, and the day of the final administration.  In addition, the number and percentage

of subjects as well as the exact 95% CI based on binomial distribution was calculated for the 
improvement rate (the percentage of subjects who had symptoms at baseline and showed remarkable 
improvement or improvement after the IMP administration) and the disappearance rate (the 
percentage of subjects who had symptoms at baseline and whose symptoms resolved after the IMP 
administration) on the third day of administration at the evaluation dose, the day of the final 
administration at the evaluation dose, and the day of the final administration. Analysis was also 
performed using data collected immediately before the start of administration at the evaluation dose as 
the baseline (the phrase “after the IMP administration” for the improvement and disappearance rates 
was read as that of “after the start of administration at the evaluation dose”). 
A shift table was prepared for changes in the degree of pulmonary congestion from baseline through 
the day after the final administration. The number and percentage of subjects as well as the exact 
95% CI based on the binomial distribution was calculated for the improvement and disappearance 
rates on the day after the final administration. 
Subgroup analyses and analyses by the evaluation dose of the primary endpoint, percent changes in 
body weight, and edematous symptoms were performed for (the day after) the third day of 
administration at the evaluation dose, the day of (or the day after) the final administration at the 
evaluation dose, and the day of (or the day after) the final administration (except for the 
summarization by the number of days that had elapsed since the start of administration).

Pharmacokinetics results 
Time points of blood sampling 
Blood was to be collected before administration, and at 2 to 4, 10 to 14, and approximately 24 hours 
after administration on the third day of treatment with tolvaptan at 0.05, 0.15, 0.3, or 0.5 mg/kg/day.  
Rationale for the time points of blood sampling: To determine the pharmacokinetics of tolvaptan in 
pediatric heart failure patients, data on the plasma concentrations of tolvaptan (OPC-41061) and its 
metabolites (DM-4103 and DM-4107) were to be collected. For the time points of blood sampling, a 
trial in adult CHF patients (Trial 156-06-004) was referred to. As a result of consideration, a total of 4 
time points (before administration, at around the peak time [2 to 4 hours after administration], and at 
times in an elimination phase [10 to 14 hours and 24 hours after administration]) were set, so that the 
pharmacokinetic parameters of tolvaptan (OPC-41061) could be determined by a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, which was to be separately conducted. 
In the pharmacokinetic analysis set, the plasma concentrations of tolvaptan (OPC-41061) and its 
metabolites (DM-4103 and DM-4107) were summarized by descriptive statistics, in the following 2 
ways. The doses used for tabulation (0.05, 0.15, 0.3, and 0.5 mg/kg/day) were those on the date of 
blood sampling. 
- Summarization for each compound, time point of blood sampling, and dose 
- Summarization for each compound, time point of blood sampling, dose, and age group (young age, 6 
months to less than 2 years; middle age, 2 years to less than 7 years; and old age, 7 years to less 
than 15 years) 
Descriptive statistics to be determined were the number of subjects, mean, SD, coefficient of variation, 
minimum, median, and maximum. 
The population pharmacokinetic analysis of tolvaptan (OPC-41061) was to be separately performed 
and reported. 
Pharmacokinetic results 
For tolvaptan (OPC-41061) the changes in the plasma concentrations by subject are shown in the 
figures below.

The plasma concentrations (mean) of tolvaptan (OPC-41061) reached the maximum values at 2 to 4 
hours after administration at all of the evaluation doses of 0.05, 0.15, 0.3, and 0.5 mg/kg/day, and 
decreased at 10 to 14 hours after administration and at approximately 24 hours after administration. 
The plasma concentrations of tolvaptan (OPC-41061) at approximately 24 hours after administration 
were below the lower limit of quantitation (2.00 ng/mL) in 12/13 subjects at 0.05 mg/kg/day, in 5/14 
subjects at 0.15 mg/kg/day, in 1/2 subject at 0.3 mg/kg/day, and in 1/5 subject at 0.5 mg/kg/day. 
The plasma concentrations (mean) at 2 to 4 hours after administration were comparable to those at 
baseline at 0.15 and 0.3 mg/kg/day, but generally increased in proportion to the evaluation dose. 
The plasma concentrations (mean) of DM-4103 at each evaluation dose were highest at 10 to 14 hours 
after administration or at approximately 24 hours after administration. The plasma concentrations 
(mean) of DM-4107 at each evaluation dose reached the peak at 2 to 4 or 10 to 14 hours after 
administration, and decreased at approximately 24 hours after administration. 
The number of subjects included in the pharmacokinetic analyses by evaluation dose and by age 
group, in the order of young, middle, and old age, was 3, 2, and 8 subjects at 0.05 mg/kg/day; 5, 2, 
and 8 subjects at 0.15 mg/kg/day; 1, 1, and 0 subjects at 0.3 mg/kg/day; and 3, 0, and 2 subjects at 
0.5 mg/kg/day. It was limited to 2 or fewer subjects in 1 or more age groups, at all of the evaluation 
doses. The plasma concentrations (mean) of tolvaptan (OPC-41061) at 0.05 and 0.15 mg/kg/day, at 
which plasma drug concentration results were obtained in all age groups, showed no trends that were 
dependent on age-group.

Table 11.5.3.3.4-1. 
The change (mean ± SD) from baseline in plasma AVP concentration (2.55 ng/L) on the day after the 
final administration shows an increase compared to baseline. 
The changes (mean ± SD) from baseline in plasma AVP concentration on the day after the final 
administration, by age group show a greater increase in the young age group than in the middle and 
old age groups. 
Pharmacodynamic conclusions 
Data by the number of days that had elapsed since the start of the tolvaptan administration showed 
that the percent change (mean) from baseline in daily urine volume was from 18.9% to 46.4%, and 
that the changes (mean) in daily fluid intake and daily fluid balance were from 164.5 to 365.5 mL and 
−98.9 to 18.4 mL, respectively. The daily urine volume and daily fluid intake increased compared to 
baseline for the 3 days after the start of administration at the evaluation dose. The daily fluid balance 
decreased compared to baseline on the first and second days of administration at the evaluation dose, 
but did not change markedly on the third day. 
Urine osmolality decreased compared to baseline for the 3 days after the start of administration at the 
evaluation dose. No significant changes were observed in daily urine sodium excretion or daily urine 
potassium excretion. 
Serum osmolality and serum or blood sodium concentration increased slightly compared to baseline, 
for the 3 days after the start of administration at the evaluation dose. There were no marked changes 
in serum or blood potassium concentration. 
Plasma AVP concentration on the day after the final administration increased compared to baseline.

AEs by age group 
The incidence of AEs by age group was 50% (10/20 subjects) in the young age group, 37.5% (6/16 
subjects) in the middle age group, and 41.7% (10/24 subjects) in the old age group. The AEs that 
occurred in at least 2 subjects in the young age group were pyrexia and thirst (two subjects each, 
10%). 
No AEs occurred in the middle age group. 
The AEs occurring in at least 2 subjects in the oldest age group were vomiting, thirst, and 
hyperkaelimia (2 subjects each, 8.3%). 
Deaths 
No deaths occurred in this trial. 
Other SAEs 
An SAE occurred in 1/60 subjects (1.7%). The SAE that occurred was cardiac failure chronic, and was 
determined to be unrelated to the IMP. The subject was between 10 and 13 years old at the evaluation 
dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day. after the completion of the treatment with the IMP, the event occurred on 
Day 8 (5 days affetr the completion of treatment) and resolved on day 17 after onset (21 days after 
the completion of treatment). 
AEs leading to discontinuation 
AEs of special interest 
The AEs of special interest in this trial were dehydration and renal impairment. Dehydration and renal 
impairment were reported in one subject each (the same subject). The subject who experienced 
dehydration and renal impairment was a between 11 and 14 years old; both of these two events were 
determined to be unrelated to the IMP. All of the events were mild in severity and occurred on Day 5  
(4 days after discontinuation), and the outcome was unresolved. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
According to Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the MAH has submitted the results of a 
paediatric clinical trial with tolvaptan in patients with heart failure. The presented data pertain a short-
term administration of tolvaptan in a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, dose-defining trial to 
investigate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug in male and 
female paediatric heart failure patients with volume overload, aged from 6 months to less than 15

years. The study design contemplated an initial 3 day-hospitalisation period before IMP administration, 
followed by an up-titration scheme starting at 0.05 mg/kg/day that was progressively increased to 
0.15, 0.3, or 0.5 mg/kg/day according with daily urine volume. Dose augmentation was considered in 
cases of “insufficient increase in urine volume” when it was less than 150% of that for the 
pretreatment observation period (one day before the start of tolvaptan administration). Once reached 
the target dose (i.e. evaluation dose), treatment was maintained for 3 days, and that period was 
considered for efficacy evaluation. The dose range was empirically chosen, based on the adult dose 
finding trials and post-marketing experience in Japan.  
The study was conducted in Japan, where a MA is in place for tolvaptan in the treatment of heart 
failure in adults. This is indication is not licensed in the EU, nor a paediatric line of extension is herein 
pursued. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The plasma concentrations (mean) of tolvaptan (OPC-41061) reached the maximum value at 2 to 4 
hours after administration, and subsequently decreased. The MAH states that plasma concentrations 
(mean) of tolvaptan (OPC-41061) at 0.05 and 0.15 mg/kg/day, at which plasma drug concentration 
results were obtained in all age groups, showed no trends that were dependent on age-group. 
However, no clear graphical or tabular data are reported to allow drawing firm conclusions.  
In addition, it is not clear why pharmacokinetic analysis set included only 44/60 participants, i.e. why 
post dose samples are not available for a significant number of subjects. 
Subjects took tolvaptan 1% granules or tolvaptan 15 mg tablet with water once daily after breakfast. 
The impact of the different formulations used on pharmacokinetics cannot be excluded, since it is not 
clear if bioequivalence was demonstrated. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamics parameters were well described and analysed, age subgroups analysis was 
performed, even though numbers are small. 
Efficacy and Safety 
Definition of treatment response was derived from the clinical experience with tolvaptan as 
accumulated in the adult heart failure setting. Specifically, based on the body weight reduction of 1.27 
kg observed 3 days post-treatment initiation in adults, a cut-off of 1.5 kg in body weight decrease on 
Day 3 was taken for the efficacy evaluation in children. Body weight reduction was under the condition 
that the mean daily urine volume for the 3 days of treatment with tolvaptan at the evaluation dose was 
higher than the daily urine volume for the pre-treatment observation period.  By acknowledging the 
general lack of a standardised measure of diuretic responsiveness, the primary endpoint appears quite 
controversial since body weight fluctuations do not represent changes in volume distribution, and 
poorly correlate with fluid output. This measure appears even weaker in the paediatric setting, 
particularly in the youngest ages. As a more solid measure of decongestion, a net fluid output would 
have been more informative or, alternatively and as recently suggested in a position paper from the 
Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology (2019), a combination of biomarkers 
and clinical parameters should have been considered for clinical efficacy determination.  
In total, 60 patients were exposed to tolvaptan for a mean duration of 4.8 ± 2.2 days. Evaluation dose 
groups included 0.05 mg/kg/day (36.7%), 0.15 mg/kg/day (40%), 0.3 mg/kg/day (10%) and 0.5 
mg/kg/day (13.3%). The IMP treatment periods (mean ± SD) by evaluation dose were 2.7 ± 0.6 days 
at 0.05 mg/kg/day, 4.9 ± 0.9 days at 0.15 mg/kg/day, 6.5 ± 0.8 days at 0.3 mg/kg/day, and 9.0 ± 
0.0 days at 0.5 mg/kg/day. The sample size was calculated based on a value for assessment of

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

efficacy as defined by the primary endpoint, and then using binomial distribution to determine the 
number of subjects required to maintain a 90% or higher probability that the lower limit of the 95% CI 
for the percentage of subjects achieving the primary endpoint. 
According with the baseline characteristics, the recruited population showed a representation of the 
three pre-defined age groups (6 months-1 year: 33.9%; 2-6 years: 27.1%; 7-14 years:14%) which is 
in line with disease epidemiology for time of diagnosis. Only Asian patients were recruited, with 47.5% 
and 52.5% of male and female sex, respectively. Surgical history was present in 76.3% of the 
population. As expected, congenital heart disease and cardiomyopathy leading to either over-
circulation failure or pump failure, were among the most common causes of heart failure in the studied 
population. Of note, a wide variety of symptomatology was included encompassing Class II and III of 
the disease severity grading system adopted in children (i.e. NYHA or Ross). Indeed, the majority was 
symptomatic at the time of recruitment (98.3%), as per inclusion criteria requiring patients to present 
with volume overload and inadequate response to “conventional diuretic therapy”. The definition was 
left to the investigator, leading to the recruitment of a heterogeneous population in terms of 
concomitant diuretic medications that mostly reflects clinical practice. The majority of patients were on 
a combination of loop diuretics and anti-aldosterone drugs (76.3%), while a minority was on 
monotherapy with loop diuretics (10.2%), or Loop diuretic + Thiazide diuretic + Antialdosterone drug 
(11.9%). According with clinical practice and as a standard-of-care, additional heart failure 
medications were concomitantly used with tolvaptan, including the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 
milrinone (administrated to 20% of participants on Day 1), and digoxin (used in 8.3% of patients on 
Day 1).  
The percentage of subjects whose body weight was decreased by 1.7% or more from baseline on the 
day after the third day of administration at the evaluation dose was 22.8% (13/57 subjects; 95% CI 
[0.127, 0.358]). A similar percentage of “responders” was identified across all the different dose 
ranges (around 25%) with the exception of the highest dose group, for which a reduced response to 
treatment (12.5%) was registered. Lack of dose-dependency would be expected in an individualised 
up-titration scheme as defined in the study protocol. Of note, the highest dose of tolvaptan was most 
frequently employed in the youngest patients (75% of those receiving 0.5 mg/kg/day were aged 
between 6 month-<2 years), while the oldest patients were more prevalent in the lower dose ranges 
(45% and 50% of those receiving 0.05 mg/kg/day and 0.15 mg/kg/day were aged between 7-15 
years, respectively). The use of concomitant medications including diuretics and anti-aldosterone drugs 
was almost comparable across dose groups.  It could be that disease severity varied across ages, and 
this might justify the worse response rate observed at the highest dose. However, data on disease 
severity were not collected during the study; therefore, this hypothesis remains a speculative 
observation.  
As regards the secondary endpoint, namely the  percentage of body weight change from baseline, the 
trend was generally consistent with the primary endpoint variations, showing a dose-independent 
reduction by 0.7%, 0.2% and 1.5% in the 0.05, 0.15 and 0.3 mg/kg/day group respectively, while an 
increase in body weight from baseline was observed in the 0.5 mg/kg/day dose, which could be 
attributed to either a reduced individual response or increased disease severity in the group receiving 
the highest dose. The requested dose and age subgroup characterisation could offer insight into these 
data. However, the clinical meaning of this observation remains unclear taking into consideration the 
abovementioned poor correlation between body weight fluctuations and volume distribution. In keeping 
with this, the clinical response as evaluated by signs of congestion was generally better compared to 
the primary endpoint results, and was overall consistent across the different dose groups, although 
missing a clear dose-dependency. Improvement in peripheral oedema was registered in 68.6% of the 
population, and resolution of symptoms occurred in 65.7% of patients; the proportion of responders 
progressively augmented by dose increase between 0.05 and 0.3 mg/kg/day (from 81.8% to 100% for 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
Page 49/51 
 
 
 
 
improvement and 72.7% and 100% for disappearance), although falling in the highest dose group (0.5 
mg/kg/day; 40% for improvement and disappearance, respectively). More variable trends were 
observed for improvement in jugular venous distension (50% in all groups with the exception of 
0.5mg/kg/day registering 25% response) and pulmonary congestion (59.3%, 63.6%, 50% and 16.7% 
in the four dose groups); their respective disappearance rates were similar, suggesting a variable 
individual response. Finally, evaluation of daily urine volume as indicative of the aquaretic effect of 
tolvaptan, showed  dose-independent percent changes (mean ± SD) from baseline and high inter-
individual variability,  based on the values on the first day of administration at the evaluation dose in 
the dose maintenance analysis (86.4 ± 67.2% at 0.05 mg/kg/day, 56.5 ± 48.9% at 0.15 mg/kg/day, 
57.5 ± 3.3% at 0.3 mg/kg/day, and 14.7 ± 11.3% at 0.5 mg/kg/day) and the full analysis set (53.1 ± 
52.9% on the first day of administration at the evaluation dose, 47.8 ± 43.3% on the second day, and 
45.8 ± 29.3% on the third day).  
At the subgroup analysis, the intermediate 2-6 year age category had the lowest percentage of 
responders based on the primary endpoint (14.3% compared to 30% and 21.7% of the 6 months-1 
year and 7-14 year group, respectively), while achieving the best clinical response when evaluating 
oedema improvement (47.3% compared to 27.7% and 38.4% of the 6 months-1 year and 7-14 year 
group, respectively) and disappearance rates (87.5% compared to 50% and 66.7% of the 6 months-1 
year and 7-14 year group, respectively). 
From a safety perspective, the incidence of AEs was 43.3% in the total population, with AEs related to 
the IMP occurring in 16.7% of patients. A consistent rate of events was observed across age groups 
and dose ranges. No deaths were reported, nor cases of acute liver toxicity were registered in this trial. 
The majority of AEs by SOC categories included gastrointestinal disorders (13.3%), general disorders 
and administration site conditions (10.0%), and metabolism and nutrition disorders (8.3%). AEs 
occurring with common frequency were thirst (6.7%) and anaemia, constipation, dry mouth, vomiting, 
pyrexia, and hyperkalaemia (3.3% for all of them). AEs were more often mild in severity (35.0%), with 
only a minority reporting moderate AEs (6.7%) and one patient (1.7%) developing a serious event, 
namely cardiac failure that was judged unrelated to the IMP. This was about a 13-old boy with dilated 
cardiomyopathy receiving tolvaptan 0.05 mg/kg/day for 3 days who suffered acute cardiac 
decompensation 5 days post-last dose administration. On revision of this case, no concerns arise. 
Among IMP-related AEs, General disorders and administration site conditions (i.e. pyrexia 1.7%; and 
thirst 6.7%) were the most frequent (8.3%), followed by gastrointestinal disorders (5.5%; dry mouth 
3.3% and constipation 1.7%); polydipsia, dizziness and neutropenia occurred with a frequency of 
1.7%. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
In conclusion, based on the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, the MAH claims treatment 
efficacy for Jinarc (tolvaptan) in children aged from 6 months to less than 15 years with heart failure 
and signs of congestions not controlled by conventional diuretic therapy. However, the benefit of 
treatment in the short-term remains undefined due to the abovementioned study limitations, and 
information on the long-term effect are currently unavailable. No new safety signals emerged in this 
paediatric investigation. The safety profile for this short-term course of tolvaptan administration 
appears manageable and in line with the adult clinical experience accumulated so far. Considering that 
the MAH is not pursuing a paediatric indication in the EU, the presented data have only a limited 
clinical and regulatory impact.

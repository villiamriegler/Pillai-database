NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
ADASUVE 4.5 mg inhalation powder, pre-dispensed 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each single-dose inhaler contains 5 mg loxapine and delivers 4.5 mg loxapine. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Inhalation powder, pre-dispensed (inhalation powder). 
White device with a mouthpiece on one end and a pull-tab protruding from the other end. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
ADASUVE is indicated for the rapid control of mild-to-moderate agitation in adult patients with 
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Patients should receive regular treatment immediately after control 
of acute agitation symptoms. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
ADASUVE should be administered in a medical setting under the direct supervision of a healthcare 
professional. Patients should be observed during the first hour after each dose for signs and symptoms 
of bronchospasm. 
Short-acting beta-agonist bronchodilator treatment should be available for treatment of possible 
severe respiratory side-effects (bronchospasm).  
Posology 
The  recommended  initial  dose  of  ADASUVE  is  9.1  mg.  As  this  dose  cannot  be  reach  with  this 
presentation  (ADASUVE  4.5  mg),  the  presentation  ADASUVE  9.1  mg  should  be  used  initially.  A 
second dose can be given after 2 hours, if necessary. No more than two doses should be administered.  
A lower dose of 4.5 mg may be given if the 9.1 mg dose was not previously tolerated by the patient or 
if the physician decides a lower dose is more appropriate.   
Elderly 
The safety and efficacy of ADASUVE in patients older than 65 years of age have not been established. 
No data are available. 
Renal and/or hepatic impairment 
ADASUVE has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. No data are available.

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of ADASUVE in children (less than 18 years of age) have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Inhalation use. The product is packaged in a sealed pouch.  
When needed, the product is removed from the pouch. Once the pull-tab is removed, a green light 
turns on, indicating the product is ready for use (Note: the product must be used within 15 minutes of 
pulling the tab). To deliver the medicinal product, the patient inhales through the mouthpiece with a 
steady deep breath. Upon completion of the inhalation, the patient removes the mouthpiece from 
mouth and holds breath briefly. The medicinal product has been delivered when the green light turns 
off. The device exterior may become warm during use. This is normal. 
For complete instructions on how to use ADASUVE see information for the healthcare professional 
section of the package leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, or to amoxapine. 
Patients with acute respiratory signs/symptoms (e.g., wheezing) or with active airways disease (such 
as patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Correct use of ADASUVE inhaler is important for administration of the full dose of loxapine. 
Healthcare professionals should ensure the patient will use the inhaler properly. 
ADASUVE may have limited effectiveness when patients are on concomitant medicinal products, 
predominantly other antipsychotics.  
Bronchospasm 
Bronchospasm has been reported following administration of ADASUVE, especially in patients with 
asthma or COPD and was typically reported within 25 minutes after dosing (see section 4.8). 
Consequently, ADASUVE is contraindicated in patients with asthma or COPD as well as patients with 
acute respiratory signs/symptoms (e.g., wheezing) (see section 4.3). ADASUVE has not been 
investigated in patients with other forms of lung disease. It is recommended to observe patients during 
the first hour for signs and symptoms of bronchospasm following administration of ADASUVE. 
In patients who may develop bronchospasm, treatment with a short-acting beta-agonist bronchodilator, 
e.g., salbutamol should be considered (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
ADASUVE should not be re-administered in patients who develop any respiratory signs/symptoms 
(see section 4.3). 
Hypoventilation 
Given the primary Central Nervous System (CNS) effects of loxapine, ADASUVE should be used 
with caution in patients with compromised respiration, such as hypovigilant patients or patients with 
CNS-depression due to alcohol or other centrally acting medicinal products, e.g., anxiolytics, most 
antipsychotics, hypnotics, opiates, etc. (see section 4.5).

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis 
ADASUVE has not been studied in elderly patients, including those with dementia-related psychosis. 
Clinical studies with both atypical and conventional antipsychotic medicinal products have 
demonstrated that elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis are at an increased risk of death 
compared to placebo. ADASUVE is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related 
psychosis.  
Extrapyramidal symptoms 
Extrapyramidal symptoms (including acute dystonia) are known class effects for antipsychotics. 
ADASUVE should be used with caution in patients with a known history of extrapyramidal 
symptoms. 
Tardive dyskinesia 
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient being treated with loxapine, 
discontinuation should be considered. These symptoms can temporally worsen or can even arise after 
discontinuation of treatment. 
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) 
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence 
of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac 
dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria 
(rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of 
NMS, or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, 
ADASUVE must be discontinued.  
Hypotension 
Mild hypotension was reported in short-term (24-hour), placebo-controlled trials in agitated patients 
administered ADASUVE. If vasopressor therapy is required, noradrenaline or phenylephrine is 
preferred. Adrenaline should not be used, since beta-adrenoceptor stimulation may worsen 
hypotension in the setting of loxapine-induced partial alpha-adrenoceptor blockade (see section 4.5). 
Cardiovascular 
No data are available on the use of ADASUVE in patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases. 
ADASUVE is not recommended in patient populations with known cardiovascular disease (history of 
myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), 
cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, 
hypovolaemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products). 
QT interval 
Clinically relevant QT prolongation does not appear to be associated with single and repeat doses of 
ADASUVE. Caution should be exercised when ADASUVE is administered in patients with known 
cardiovascular disease or family history of QT prolongation, and in concomitant use with other 
medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval. The potential risk of QTc prolongation due to 
interaction with medicinal products known to prolong QTc interval is unknown.  
Seizures / convulsions 
Loxapine should be used with caution in patients with a history of convulsive disorders since it lowers 
the convulsive threshold. Seizures have been reported in patients receiving oral loxapine at 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
antipsychotic dose levels, and may occur in epileptic patients even with maintenance of routine 
anticonvulsant drug therapy (see section 4.5). 
Anticholinergic activity 
Because of anticholinergic action, ADASUVE should be used cautiously in patients with glaucoma or 
a tendency to urinary retention, particularly with concomitant administration of anticholinergic-type 
antiparkinson medicinal products. 
Intoxication or physical disease (delirium) 
The safety and efficacy of ADASUVE has not been evaluated in patients with agitation due to 
intoxication or physical disease (delirium). ADASUVE should be used with caution in patients who 
are intoxicated or delirious (see section 4.5). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concomitant administration of benzodiazepines or other hypnosedatives or respiratory depressants 
may be associated with excessive sedation and respiratory depression or respiratory failure. If 
benzodiazepine therapy is deemed necessary in addition to loxapine, patients should be monitored for 
excessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension.  
A study of inhaled loxapine and intramuscular lorazepam 1 mg in combination found no significant 
effects on respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, blood pressure, or heart rate compared with either drug 
administered alone. Higher doses of lorazepam have not been studied. The effects of the combination 
on sedation appeared to be additive. 
Potential for ADASUVE to affect other medicinal products 
Loxapine is not expected to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with medicinal 
products that are either metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isozymes or glucuronidated by 
human uridine 5’-diphosphoglucuronosyl transferases (UGTs).  
Caution is advised if loxapine is combined with other medicinal products known to lower the seizure 
threshold, e.g. phenothiazines or butyrophenones, clozapine, tricyclics or selective serotonine reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs), tramadol, mefloquine (see section 4.4). 
In vitro studies indicated that loxapine was not a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but does inhibit 
P-gp. At therapeutic concentrations, however, it is not expected to inhibit P-gp-mediated transport of 
other medicinal products in a clinically significant manner. 
Given the primary CNS effects of loxapine, ADASUVE should be used with caution in combination 
with alcohol or other centrally acting medicinal products, e.g., anxiolytics, most antipsychotics, 
hypnotics, opiates, etc. The use of loxapine in patients with alcohol or medicinal product intoxication 
(either with prescribed or illicit medicinal products) has not been evaluated. Loxapine may cause 
severe respiratory depression if combined with other CNS-depressants (see section 4.4). 
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ADASUVE 
Loxapine is a substrate for flavin-containing mono-oxygenases (FMOs), and for several CYP450 
isozymes (see section 5.2). Therefore, the risk of metabolic interactions caused by an effect on an 
individual isoform is limited. Caution should be used in patients receiving concomitant treatment with 
other medicinal products that are either inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes, particularly if the 
concomitant medicinal product is known to inhibit or induce several of the enzymes involved in 
loxapine metabolism. Such medicinal products may modify efficacy and safety of ADASUVE in an 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
irregular manner. Concomitant use of CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, 
propranolol and refecoxib) should be avoided, if possible. 
Adrenaline 
Co-administration of loxapine and adrenaline may cause worsening of hypotension (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
New-born infants exposed repeatedly to antipsychotics during the third trimester of pregnancy are at 
risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that may vary in 
severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, 
tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, monitoring of new-borns 
should be considered. ADASUVE should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit 
justifies the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
The extent of the excretion of loxapine or its metabolites in human milk is not known. However, 
loxapine and its metabolites have been shown to be transported into the milk of lactating dogs. 
Patients should be advised not to breast feed for a period of 48 hours after receiving loxapine and 
discard the milk produced in the meantime. 
Fertility 
No loxapine specific human data on fertility are available. It is known that in humans, long-term 
treatment with antipsychotics may lead to loss of libido and amenorrhoea. In female rats, reproductive 
effects have been observed (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
 ADASUVE has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Because of the potential for 
sedation/somnolence, fatigue, or dizziness, patients should not operate hazardous machines, including 
motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that loxapine has not affected them adversely (see 
section 4.8).  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Assessment of adverse reactions from clinical study data is based on two Phase 3 and one Phase 2A 
short-term (24-hour) placebo-controlled clinical trials enrolling 524 adult patients with agitation 
associated with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. 
In those studies, bronchospasm was uncommonly found. However, in specific Phase 1 clinical safety 
trials in subjects with asthma or COPD,  bronchospasm was commonly reported and often required 
treatment with a short-acting beta-agonist bronchodilator. Consequently, ADASUVE is 
contraindicated in patients with asthma,COPD or other active airway disease (see section 4.3). 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions during treatment with ADASUVE were dysgeusia, 
sedation/somnolence and dizziness (dizziness was more common after placebo treatment than 
loxapine treatment).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Bronchospasm 
In short-term (24-hour), placebo-controlled trials in patients with agitation associated with 
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder without active airways disease, bronchospasm and possible 
symptoms of bronchospasm (which includes reports of wheezing, shortness of breath or cough) 
wereuncommon in patients treated with ADASUVE. However, in placebo-controlled clinical trials in 
subjects with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma or moderate-to-severe COPD, adverse reactions of 
bronchospasm were reported very commonly. Most of these events occurred within 25 minutes of 
dosing, were mild to moderate in severity, and could be relieved with an inhaled bronchodilator. 
Adverse reactions seen with chronic oral loxapine use 
With chronic oral administration of loxapine, the reported adverse reactions include sedation and 
drowsiness; extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g., tremor, akathisia, rigidity, and dystonia); cardiovascular 
effects (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, light-headedness, and 
syncope); and anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry eyes, blurred vision, and urinary retention). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No cases of overdosage of ADASUVE were reported in clinical studies. 
Symptoms  
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the event of accidental overdosage, signs and symptoms will depend on the number of units taken 
and individual patient tolerance. As would be expected from the pharmacologic actions of loxapine, 
the clinical findings may range from mild depression of the CNS and cardiovascular systems to 
profound hypotension, respiratory depression, and unconsciousness (see section 4.4). The possibility 
of occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms and/or convulsive seizures should be kept in mind. Renal 
failure following oral loxapine overdosage has also been reported.  
Management 
The treatment of overdosage is essentially symptomatic and supportive. Severe hypotension might be 
expected to respond to the administration of noradrenaline or phenylephrine. Adrenaline should not be 
used since its use in a patient with partial adrenergic blockage may further lower the blood pressure 
(see sections 4.4 and 4.5). Severe extrapyramidal reactions should be treated with anticholinergic 
antiparkinson medicinal products or diphenhydramine hydrochloride, and anticonvulsant therapy 
should be initiated as indicated. Additional measures include oxygen and intravenous fluids.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: psycholeptics, antipsychotics; ATC code: N05AH01 
The efficacy of loxapine is proposed to be mediated through high affinity antagonism of dopamine D2 
receptors and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. Loxapine binds with noradrenergic, histaminergic, and 
cholinergic receptors, and its interaction with these systems may influence the spectrum of its 
pharmacological effects. 
Changes in the level of excitability of subcortical inhibitory areas have been observed in several 
animal species, associated with calming effects and suppression of aggressive behaviour. 
Clinical efficacy  
In the two Phase 3 studies patients were enrolled who had acute agitation of at least moderate level (14 
or higher on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Excited Component (PEC) scale (poor 
impulse control, tension, hostility, uncooperativeness, and excitement). Inclusion in Study 004-301 
required a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Inclusion in Study 004-302 required a diagnosis of bipolar 
disorder (current episode manic or mixed). Patients had significant and long-standing psychiatric 
disease (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV)), based on 
years since diagnosis and previous hospitalizations. Patients were randomised to placebo, ADASUVE 
4.5 mg and ADASUVE 9.1 mg.  
The mean age of randomized patients was 43.1 years in Study 004-301 and 40.8 years in Study 
004-302: young adults (18-25 years old) were scarcely (7.3%) represented in either trial. Women in 
the schizophrenia trial were scarcely represented (26.5%), and about half of the patients were male 
(49.7%) in Study 004-302. About 35% of the patients with schizophrenia were taking concomitant 
antipsychotics at the time of dosing while approximately 13% of the patients with bipolar disorder 
were taking these drugs. A majority of the patients in both Phase 3 studies were smokers with about 
82% of the patients with schizophrenia and 74% of the patients with bipolar disorder currently 
smoking. 
After the first dose, a second dose was administered at least 2 hours later if the agitation had not 
subsided sufficiently. A third dose was administered if needed after at least 4 hours after dose 2. 
Rescue medication (intramuscular lorazepam) was given if medically required. Primary endpoint was 
absolute change in PEC score from baseline to 2 hours following Dose 1 for both doses of ADASUVE 
compared with placebo. Among the other endpoints were PEC and Clinical Global Impression –

Improvement (CGI-I) responders at 2 hours after dose 1, and total number of patients per group who 
received 1, 2, or 3 doses of study medication with and without rescue medication. Responders were 
considered patients with a ≥40% decrease from baseline in the total PEC score or patients with CGI-I 
score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). 
Decreased agitation was evident 10 minutes after Dose 1, the first assessment time, and at all 
subsequent assessments during the 24 hour evaluation period, for both 4.5 mg and 9.1 mg doses in 
both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients. 
Examination of population subsets (age, race, and gender) did not reveal any differential 
responsiveness on the basis of these subgroupings. 
For the main results, see the table below.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
ADASUVE in the subset of the paediatric population from birth to less than 12 years of age for the 
treatment of schizophrenia and in the subset from birth to less than 10 years of age for the treatment of 
bipolar disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
ADASUVE in the subset of the paediatric population from 12 to less than 18 years of age for the 
treatment of schizophrenia and in the subset from 10 years to less than 18 years of age in bipolar 
disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Administration of ADASUVE resulted in rapid absorption of loxapine with a median time of 
maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) by 2 minutes. Loxapine exposure in the first 2 hours after 
administration (AUC0-2h, a measure of early exposure that is relevant to the onset of therapeutic effect) 
was 25.6 ng*h/mL for the 4.5 mg dose and 66.7 ng*h/mL for the 9.1 mg dose in healthy subjects.  
The pharmacokinetic parameters of loxapine were determined in subjects on chronic, stable 
antipsychotic regimens following repeat administration of ADASUVE every 4 hours for a total of 3 
doses (either 4.5 mg or 9.1 mg). Mean peak plasma concentrations were similar after the first and third 
dose of ADASUVE, indicating minimal accumulation during the 4-hour dosing interval. 
Distribution 
Loxapine is removed rapidly from the plasma and distributed in tissues. Animal studies following oral 
administration suggest an initial preferential distribution in the lungs, brain, spleen, heart and kidney. 
Loxapine is 96.6% bound to human plasma proteins. 
Biotransformation 
Loxapine is metabolised extensively in the liver, with multiple metabolites formed. The main 
metabolic pathways include hydroxylation to form 8-OH-loxapine and 7-OH-loxapine, N-oxidation to 
form loxapine N-oxide, and de-methylation to form amoxapine. For ADASUVE, the order of 
metabolites observed in humans (based on systemic exposure) was 8-OH-loxapine >> loxapine N 
oxide > 7-OH-loxapine > amoxapine, with plasma levels of 8-OH-loxapine similar to the parent 
compound. 8-OH-loxapine is not pharmacologically active at the D2 receptor while the minor 
metabolite, 7-OH-loxapine, has high binding affinity to D2 receptors. 
Loxapine is a substrate for several CYP450 isozymes; in vitro studies demonstrated that 7-OH-
loxapine is formed mainly by CYPs 3A4 and 2D6, 8-OH-loxapine is formed mainly by CYP1A2, 
amoxapine is formed mainly by CYP3A4, 2C19, and 2C8, and loxapine N-oxide is formed by FMOs. 
The potential for loxapine and its metabolites (amoxapine, 7-OH-loxapine, 8-OH-loxapine, and 
loxapine-N-oxide) to inhibit CYP450 - mediated drug metabolism has been examined in vitro for 
CYPs 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No significant inhibition was 
observed. In vitro studies indicate that loxapine and 8-OH-loxapine are not inducers of CYP1A2, 2B6 
or 3A4 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. In addition, in vitro studies indicate that loxapine 
and 8-OH loxapine are not inhibitors of UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 2B7 and 2B15. 
Elimination 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Loxapine excretion occurs mainly in the first 24 hours. Metabolites are excreted in the urine in the 
form of conjugates and in the faeces unconjugated. The terminal elimination half-life (T½) ranged 
from 6 to 8 hours. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The mean plasma loxapine concentrations following administration of ADASUVE were linear over 
the clinical dose range. AUC0-2h, AUCinf, and Cmax increased in a dose-dependent manner. 
Pharmacokinetics in special patient populations 
Smokers 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis that compared exposures in smokers versus non-smokers 
indicated that smoking, which induces CYP1A2, had a minimal effect on the exposure to ADASUVE. 
No dosage adjustment is recommended based on smoking status. 
In female smokers exposure (AUCinf) to ADASUVE and its active metabolite 7-OH-loxapine is lower 
than in female non-smokers (84% vs 109% 7-OH-loxapine/Loxapine Ratio), which is probably due to 
an increase in loxapine clearance in smokers. 
Demographics 
There were no important differences in the exposure or disposition of loxapine following 
administration of ADASUVE due to age, gender, race, weight, or body mass index (BMI). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity, except for changes to reproductive tissues 
related to the extended pharmacology of loxapine. Similar changes, e.g., gynecomastia, are known in 
humans, but only after long-term administration of medicines causing hyperprolactinaemia. 
Female rats did not mate due to persistent diestrus after oral treatment with loxapine. Embryo/fetal 
developmental and perinatal studies have shown indications of developmental delay (reduced weights, 
delayed ossification, hydronephrosis, hydrourether, and/or distended renal pelvis with reduced or 
absent papillae) as well as increased numbers of perinatal and neonatal deaths in offspring of rats 
treated from mid-pregnancy with oral doses below the maximum recommended human dose for 
ADASUVE on a mg/m2 basis (see section 4.6).

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
ADASUVE is indicated for the rapid control of mild-to-moderate agitation in adult patients with 
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Patients should receive regular treatment immediately after control 
of acute agitation symptoms. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
ADASUVE should be administered in a medical setting under the direct supervision of a healthcare 
professional. Patients should be observed during the first hour after each dose for signs and symptoms 
of bronchospasm. 
Short-acting beta-agonist bronchodilator treatment should be available for treatment of possible 
severe respiratory side-effects (bronchospasm).  
Posology 
The recommended initial dose of ADASUVE is 9.1 mg. A second dose can be given after 2 hours, if 
necessary. No more than two doses should be administered.  
A lower dose of 4.5 mg may be given if the 9.1 mg dose was not previously tolerated by the patient or 
if the physician decides a lower dose is more appropriate.   
Elderly 
The safety and efficacy of ADASUVE in patients older than 65 years of age have not been established. 
No data are available. 
Renal and/or hepatic impairment 
ADASUVE has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. No data are available.

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of ADASUVE in children (less than 18 years of age) have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Inhalation use. The product is packaged in a sealed pouch.  
When needed, the product is removed from the pouch. Once the pull-tab is removed, a green light 
turns on, indicating the product is ready for use (Note: the product must be used within 15 minutes of 
pulling the tab). To deliver the medicinal product, the patient inhales through the mouthpiece with a 
steady deep breath. Upon completion of the inhalation, the patient removes the mouthpiece from 
mouth and holds breath briefly. The medicinal product has been delivered when the green light turns 
off. The device exterior may become warm during use. This is normal. 
For complete instructions on how to use ADASUVE see information for the healthcare professional 
section of the package leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, or to amoxapine. 
Patients with acute respiratory signs/symptoms (e.g., wheezing) or with active airways disease (such 
as patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Correct use of ADASUVE inhaler is important for administration of the full dose of loxapine. 
Healthcare professionals should ensure the patient will use the inhaler properly. 
ADASUVE may have limited effectiveness when patients are on concomitant medicinal products, 
predominantly other antipsychotics.  
Bronchospasm 
Bronchospasm has been reported following administration of ADASUVE, especially in patients with 
asthma or COPD and was typically reported within 25 minutes after dosing (see section 4.8). 
Consequently, ADASUVE is contraindicated in patients with asthma or COPD as well as patients with 
acute respiratory signs/symptoms (e.g., wheezing) (see section 4.3). ADASUVE has not been 
investigated in patients with other forms of lung disease. It is recommended to observe patients during 
the first hour for signs and symptoms of bronchospasm following administration of ADASUVE. 
In patients who may develop bronchospasm, treatment with a short-acting beta-agonist bronchodilator, 
e.g., salbutamol should be considered (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
ADASUVE should not be re-administered in patients who develop any respiratory signs/symptoms 
(see section 4.3). 
Hypoventilation 
Given the primary Central Nervous System (CNS) effects of loxapine, ADASUVE should be used 
with caution in patients with compromised respiration, such as hypovigilant patients or patients with 
CNS-depression due to alcohol or other centrally acting medicinal products, e.g., anxiolytics, most 
antipsychotics, hypnotics, opiates, etc. (see section 4.5).

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis 
ADASUVE has not been studied in elderly patients, including those with dementia-related psychosis. 
Clinical studies with both atypical and conventional antipsychotic medicinal products have 
demonstrated that elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis are at an increased risk of death 
compared to placebo. ADASUVE is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related 
psychosis.  
Extrapyramidal symptoms 
Extrapyramidal symptoms (including acute dystonia) are known class effects for antipsychotics. 
ADASUVE should be used with caution in patients with a known history of extrapyramidal 
symptoms. 
Tardive dyskinesia 
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient being treated with loxapine, 
discontinuation should be considered. These symptoms can temporally worsen or can even arise after 
discontinuation of treatment. 
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) 
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence 
of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac 
dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria 
(rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of 
NMS, or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, 
ADASUVE must be discontinued.  
Hypotension 
Mild hypotension was reported in short-term (24-hour), placebo-controlled trials in agitated patients 
administered ADASUVE. If vasopressor therapy is required, noradrenaline or phenylephrine is 
preferred. Adrenaline should not be used, since beta-adrenoceptor stimulation may worsen 
hypotension in the setting of loxapine-induced partial alpha-adrenoceptor blockade (see section 4.5). 
Cardiovascular 
No data are available on the use of ADASUVE in patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases. 
ADASUVE is not recommended in patient populations with known cardiovascular disease (history of 
myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), 
cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, 
hypovolaemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products). 
QT interval 
Clinically relevant QT prolongation does not appear to be associated with single and repeat doses of 
ADASUVE. Caution should be exercised when ADASUVE is administered in patients with known 
cardiovascular disease or family history of QT prolongation, and in concomitant use with other 
medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval. The potential risk of QTc prolongation due to 
interaction with medicinal products known to prolong QTc interval is unknown.  
Seizures / convulsions 
Loxapine should be used with caution in patients with a history of convulsive disorders since it lowers 
the convulsive threshold. Seizures have been reported in patients receiving oral loxapine at 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
antipsychotic dose levels, and may occur in epileptic patients even with maintenance of routine 
anticonvulsant drug therapy (see section 4.5). 
Anticholinergic activity 
Because of anticholinergic action, ADASUVE should be used cautiously in patients with glaucoma or 
a tendency to urinary retention, particularly with concomitant administration of anticholinergic-type 
antiparkinson medicinal products. 
Intoxication or physical disease (delirium) 
The safety and efficacy of ADASUVE has not been evaluated in patients with agitation due to 
intoxication or physical disease (delirium). ADASUVE should be used with caution in patients who 
are intoxicated or delirious (see section 4.5). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concomitant administration of benzodiazepines or other hypnosedatives or respiratory depressants 
may be associated with excessive sedation and respiratory depression or respiratory failure. If 
benzodiazepine therapy is deemed necessary in addition to loxapine, patients should be monitored for 
excessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension.  
A study of inhaled loxapine and intramuscular lorazepam 1 mg in combination found no significant 
effects on respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, blood pressure, or heart rate compared with either drug 
administered alone. Higher doses of lorazepam have not been studied. The effects of the combination 
on sedation appeared to be additive. 
Potential for ADASUVE to affect other medicinal products 
Loxapine is not expected to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with medicinal 
products that are either metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isozymes or glucuronidated by 
human uridine 5’-diphosphoglucuronosyl transferases (UGTs) .  
Caution is advised if loxapine is combined with other medicinal products known to lower the seizure 
threshold, e.g. phenothiazines or butyrophenones, clozapine, tricyclics or selective serotonine reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs), tramadol, mefloquine (see section 4.4). 
In vitro studies indicated that loxapine was not a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but does inhibit 
P-gp. At therapeutic concentrations, however, it is not expected to inhibit P-gp-mediated transport of 
other medicinal products in a clinically significant manner. 
Given the primary CNS effects of loxapine, ADASUVE should be used with caution in combination 
with alcohol or other centrally acting medicinal products, e.g., anxiolytics, most antipsychotics, 
hypnotics, opiates, etc. The use of loxapine in patients with alcohol or medicinal product intoxication 
(either with prescribed or illicit medicinal products) has not been evaluated. Loxapine may cause 
severe respiratory depression if combined with other CNS-depressants (see section 4.4). 
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ADASUVE 
Loxapine is a substrate for flavin-containing mono-oxygenases (FMOs), and for several CYP450 
isozymes (see section 5.2). Therefore, the risk of metabolic interactions caused by an effect on an 
individual isoform is limited. Caution should be used in patients receiving concomitant treatment with 
other medicinal products that are either inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes, particularly if the 
concomitant medicinal product is known to inhibit or induce several of the enzymes involved in 
loxapine metabolism. Such medicinal products may modify efficacy and safety of ADASUVE in an 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
irregular manner. Concomitant use of CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, 
propranolol and refecoxib) should be avoided, if possible. 
Adrenaline 
Co-administration of loxapine and adrenaline may cause worsening of hypotension (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
New-born infants exposed repeatedly to antipsychotics during the third trimester of pregnancy are at 
risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that may vary in 
severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, 
tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, monitoring of new-borns 
should be considered. ADASUVE should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit 
justifies the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
The extent of the excretion of loxapine or its metabolites in human milk is not known. However, 
loxapine and its metabolites have been shown to be transported into the milk of lactating dogs. 
Patients should be advised not to breast feed for a period of 48 hours after receiving loxapine and 
discard the milk produced in the meantime. 
Fertility 
No loxapine specific human data on fertility are available. It is known that in humans, long-term 
treatment with antipsychotics may lead to loss of libido and amenorrhoea. In female rats, reproductive 
effects have been observed (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
ADASUVE has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Because of the potential for 
sedation/somnolence, fatigue, or dizziness, patients should not operate hazardous machines, including 
motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that loxapine has not affected them adversely (see 
section 4.8).  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Assessment of adverse reactions from clinical study data is based on two Phase 3 and one Phase 2A 
short-term (24-hour) placebo-controlled clinical trials enrolling 524 adult patients with agitation 
associated with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. 
In those studies, bronchospasm was uncommonly found. However, in specific Phase 1 clinical safety 
trials in subjects with asthma or COPD, bronchospasn was commonly reported and often required 
treatment with a short-acting beta-agonist bronchodilator. Consecuently, ADASUVE is 
contraindicated in patients with asthma, COPD or other active airway disease (see section 4.3). 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions during treatment with ADASUVE were dysgeusia, 
sedation/somnolence and dizziness (dizziness was more common after placebo treatment than 
loxapine treatment).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Bronchospasm 
In short-term (24-hour), placebo-controlled trials in patients with agitation associated with 
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder without active airways disease, bronchospasm and possible 
symptoms of bronchospasm (which includes reports of wheezing, shortness of breath or cough) were 
uncommon in patients treated with ADASUVE. However, in placebo-controlled clinical trials in 
subjects with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma or moderate-to-severe COPD, adverse reactions of 
bronchospasm were reported very commonly. Most of these events occurred within 25 minutes of 
dosing, were mild to moderate in severity, and could be relieved with an inhaled bronchodilator. 
Adverse reactions seen with chronic oral loxapine use 
With chronic oral administration of loxapine, the reported adverse reactions include sedation and 
drowsiness; extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g., tremor, akathisia, rigidity, and dystonia); cardiovascular 
effects (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, light-headedness, and 
syncope); and anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry eyes, blurred vision, and urinary retention). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V . 
4.9  Overdose 
No cases of overdosage of ADASUVE were reported in clinical studies. 
Symptoms 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the event of accidental overdosage, signs and symptoms will depend on the number of units taken 
and individual patient tolerance. As would be expected from the pharmacologic actions of loxapine, 
the clinical findings may range from mild depression of the CNS and cardiovascular systems to 
profound hypotension, respiratory depression, and unconsciousness (see section 4.4). The possibility 
of occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms and/or convulsive seizures should be kept in mind. Renal 
failure following oral loxapine overdosage has also been reported.  
Management 
The treatment of overdosage is essentially symptomatic and supportive. Severe hypotension might be 
expected to respond to the administration of noradrenaline or phenylephrine. Adrenaline should not be 
used since its use in a patient with partial adrenergic blockage may further lower the blood pressure 
(see sections 4.4 and 4.5). Severe extrapyramidal reactions should be treated with anticholinergic 
antiparkinson medicinal products or diphenhydramine hydrochloride, and anticonvulsant therapy 
should be initiated as indicated. Additional measures include oxygen and intravenous fluids. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: psycholeptics, antipsychotics; ATC code: N05AH01 
The efficacy of loxapine is proposed to be mediated through high affinity antagonism of dopamine D2 
receptors and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. Loxapine binds with noradrenergic, histaminergic, and 
cholinergic receptors, and its interaction with these systems may influence the spectrum of its 
pharmacological effects. 
Changes in the level of excitability of subcortical inhibitory areas have been observed in several 
animal species, associated with calming effects and suppression of aggressive behaviour. 
Clinical efficacy  
In the two Phase 3 studies patients were enrolled who had acute agitation of at least moderate level (14 
or higher on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Excited Component (PEC) scale (poor 
impulse control, tension, hostility, uncooperativeness, and excitement). Inclusion in Study 004-301 
required a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Inclusion in Study 004-302 required a diagnosis of bipolar 
disorder (current episode manic or mixed). Patients had significant and long-standing psychiatric 
disease (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV)), based on 
years since diagnosis and previous hospitalizations. Patients were randomised to placebo, ADASUVE 
4.5 mg and ADASUVE 9.1 mg.  
The mean age of randomized patients was 43.1 years in Study 004-301 and 40.8 years in Study 
004-302: young adults (18-25 years old) were scarcely (7.3%) represented in either trial. Women in 
the schizophrenia trial were scarcely represented (26.5%), and about half of the patients were male 
(49.7%) in Study 004-302. About 35% of the patients with schizophrenia were taking concomitant 
antipsychotics at the time of dosing while approximately 13% of the patients with bipolar disorder 
were taking these drugs. A majority of the patients in both Phase 3 studies were smokers with about 
82% of the patients with schizophrenia and 74% of the patients with bipolar disorder currently 
smoking. 
After the first dose, a second dose was administered at least 2 hours later if the agitation had not 
subsided sufficiently. A third dose was administered if needed after at least 4 hours after dose 2. 
Rescue medication (intramuscular lorazepam) was given if medically required. Primary endpoint was 
absolute change in PEC score from baseline to 2 hours following Dose 1 for both doses of ADASUVE 
compared with placebo. Among the other endpoints were PEC and Clinical Global Impression – 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Improvement (CGI-I) responders at 2 hours after dose 1, and total number of patients per group who 
received 1, 2, or 3 doses of study medication with and without rescue medication. Responders were 
considered patients with a ≥40% decrease from baseline in the total PEC score or patients with CGI-I 
score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). 
Decreased agitation was evident 10 minutes after Dose 1, the first assessment time, and at all 
subsequent assessments during the 24 hour evaluation period, for both 4.5 mg and 9.1 mg doses in 
both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients. 
Examination of population subsets (age, race, and gender) did not reveal any differential 
responsiveness on the basis of these subgroupings.

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
ADASUVE in the subset of the paediatric population from birth to less than 12 years of age for the 
treatment of schizophrenia and in the subset from birth to less than 10 years of age for the treatment of 
bipolar disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
ADASUVE in the subset of the paediatric population from 12 to less than 18 years of age for the 
treatment of schizophrenia and in the subset from 10 years to less than 18 years of age in bipolar 
disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Administration of ADASUVE resulted in rapid absorption of loxapine with a median time of 
maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) by 2 minutes. Loxapine exposure in the first 2 hours after 
administration (AUC0-2h, a measure of early exposure that is relevant to the onset of therapeutic effect) 
was 25.6 ng*h/mL for the 4.5 mg dose and 66.7 ng*h/mL for the 9.1 mg dose in healthy subjects.  
The pharmacokinetic parameters of loxapine were determined in subjects on chronic, stable 
antipsychotic regimens following repeat administration of ADASUVE every 4 hours for a total of 3 
doses (either 4.5 mg or 9.1 mg). Mean peak plasma concentrations were similar after the first and third 
dose of ADASUVE, indicating minimal accumulation during the 4-hour dosing interval. 
Distribution 
Loxapine is removed rapidly from the plasma and distributed in tissues. Animal studies following oral 
administration suggest an initial preferential distribution in the lungs, brain, spleen, heart and kidney. 
Loxapine is 96.6% bound to human plasma proteins. 
Biotransformation 
Loxapine is metabolised extensively in the liver, with multiple metabolites formed. The main 
metabolic pathways include hydroxylation to form 8-OH-loxapine and 7-OH-loxapine, N-oxidation to 
form loxapine N-oxide, and de-methylation to form amoxapine. For ADASUVE, the order of 
metabolites observed in humans (based on systemic exposure) was 8-OH-loxapine >> loxapine N 
oxide > 7-OH-loxapine > amoxapine, with plasma levels of 8-OH-loxapine similar to the parent 
compound. 8-OH-loxapine is not pharmacologically active at the D2 receptor while the minor 
metabolite, 7-OH-loxapine, has high binding affinity to D2 receptors. 
Loxapine is a substrate for several CYP450 isozymes; in vitro studies demonstrated that 7-OH-
loxapine is formed mainly by CYPs 3A4 and 2D6, 8-OH-loxapine is formed mainly by CYP1A2, 
amoxapine is formed mainly by CYP3A4, 2C19, and 2C8, and loxapine N-oxide is formed by FMOs. 
The potential for loxapine and its metabolites (amoxapine, 7-OH-loxapine, 8-OH-loxapine, and 
loxapine-N-oxide) to inhibit CYP450 - mediated drug metabolism has been examined in vitro for 
CYPs 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No significant inhibition was 
observed. In vitro studies indicate that loxapine and 8-OH-loxapine are not inducers of CYP1A2, 2B6 
or 3A4 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. In addition, in vitro studies indicate that loxapine 
and 8-OH loxapine are not inhibitors of UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 2B7 and 2B15. 
Elimination 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Loxapine excretion occurs mainly in the first 24 hours. Metabolites are excreted in the urine in the 
form of conjugates and in the faeces unconjugated. The terminal elimination half-life (T½) ranged 
from 6 to 8 hours. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The mean plasma loxapine concentrations following administration of ADASUVE were linear over 
the clinical dose range. AUC0-2h, AUCinf, and Cmax increased in a dose-dependent manner. 
Pharmacokinetics in special patient populations 
Smokers 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis that compared exposures in smokers versus non-smokers 
indicated that smoking, which induces CYP1A2, had a minimal effect on the exposure to ADASUVE. 
No dosage adjustment is recommended based on smoking status. 
In female smokers exposure (AUCinf) to ADASUVE and its active metabolite 7-OH-loxapine is lower 
than in female non-smokers (84% vs 109% 7-OH-loxapine/Loxapine Ratio), which is probably due to 
an increase in loxapine clearance in smokers. 
Demographics 
There were no important differences in the exposure or disposition of loxapine following 
administration of ADASUVE due to age, gender, race, weight, or body mass index (BMI). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity, except for changes to reproductive tissues 
related to the extended pharmacology of loxapine. Similar changes, e.g., gynecomastia, are known in 
humans, but only after long-term administration of medicines causing hyperprolactinaemia. 
Female rats did not mate due to persistent diestrus after oral treatment with loxapine. Embryo/fetal 
developmental and perinatal studies have shown indications of developmental delay (reduced weights, 
delayed ossification, hydronephrosis, hydrourether, and/or distended renal pelvis with reduced or 
absent papillae) as well as increased numbers of perinatal and neonatal deaths in offspring of rats 
treated from mid-pregnancy with oral doses below the maximum recommended human dose for 
ADASUVE on a mg/m2 basis (see section 4.6).

ADASUVE 4.5 mg inhalation powder, pre-dispensed 
loxapine 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains 
important information for you. 
-  Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. 
- 
- 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse.  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not 
listed in this leaflet. See section 4. 
What is in this leaflet 
1.  What ADASUVE is and what it is used for 
2.  What you need to know before you use ADASUVE 
3.  How to use ADASUVE 
4.  Possible side effects 
5.  How to store ADASUVE 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What ADASUVE is and what it is used for 
ADASUVE contains the active substance loxapine, which belongs to a group of medicines called 
antipsychotics. ADASUVE works by blocking certain chemicals in the brain (neurotransmitters) such 
as dopamine and serotonin thus causing calming effects and relieving aggressive behaviour. 
ADASUVE is used to treat acute symptoms of mild-to-moderate agitation that may occur in adult 
patients who have schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. These are diseases characterised by symptoms 
such as: 
• 
• 
(Schizophrenia) Hearing, seeing, or sensing things which are not there, suspiciousness, mistaken 
beliefs, incoherent speech and behaviour and emotional flatness. People with this condition may 
also feel depressed, guilty, anxious or tense. 
(Bipolar disorder) Feeling “high”, having excessive amounts of energy, needing much less sleep 
than usual, talking very quickly with racing ideas, and sometimes severe irritability. 
2. 
What you need to know before you use ADASUVE  
Do not use ADASUVE 
• 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to loxapine or amoxapine; 
if you have symptoms of wheezing or shortness of breath; 
if you have lung problems like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (which your 
doctor may have called “COPD”). 
Warnings and precautions 
Your doctor or nurse will talk to you before you use ADASUVE and determine whether it is 
appropriate for you. 
•  ADASUVE may cause narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) and may cause you to wheeze, 
cough, feel chest tightness or have shortness of breath. Typically, this may occur within 25 
minutes of use. 
•  Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is a set of symptoms that can occur if you are taking 
antipsychotic medicines, including ADASUVE. These symptoms can be high fever, rigid muscles, 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
irregular or fast heart rate or pulse. NMS can cause death. Do not use ADASUVE again if NMS 
occurs. 
•  Antipsychotic medicines like ADASUVE can cause movements that you may not be able to 
control including making faces, sticking out your tongue, smacking or puckering your lips, 
blinking rapidly, or moving your legs, arms or fingers rapidly. Treatment with ADASUVE may 
have to be stopped if this occurs. 
•  ADASUVE should be used with caution in patients who are intoxicated or delirious. 
Before treatment with ADASUVE, tell your doctor or nurse if you: 
• 
have or had breathing problems like asthma or other chronic lung diseases such as bronchitis or 
emphysema 
have or had heart problems or stroke 
have or had low or high blood pressure 
have or had seizures (convulsions) 
have or had glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye)

1. 
What ADASUVE is and what it is used for 
ADASUVE contains the active substance loxapine, which belongs to a group of medicines called 
antipsychotics. ADASUVE works by blocking certain chemicals in the brain (neurotransmitters) such 
as dopamine and serotonin thus causing calming effects and relieving aggressive behaviour. 
ADASUVE is used to treat acute symptoms of mild-to-moderate agitation that may occur in adult 
patients who have schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. These are diseases characterised by symptoms 
such as: 
• 
• 
(Schizophrenia) Hearing, seeing, or sensing things which are not there, suspiciousness, mistaken 
beliefs, incoherent speech and behaviour and emotional flatness. People with this condition may 
also feel depressed, guilty, anxious or tense. 
(Bipolar disorder) Feeling “high”, having excessive amounts of energy, needing much less sleep 
than usual, talking very quickly with racing ideas, and sometimes severe irritability. 
2. 
What you need to know before you use ADASUVE  
Do not use ADASUVE 
• 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to loxapine or amoxapine; 
if you have symptoms of wheezing or shortness of breath; 
if you have lung problems like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (which your 
doctor may have called “COPD”). 
Warnings and precautions 
Your doctor or nurse will talk to you before you use ADASUVE and determine whether it is 
appropriate for you. 
•  ADASUVE may cause narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) and may cause you to wheeze, 
cough, feel chest tightness or have shortness of breath. Typically, this may occur within 25 
minutes of use. 
•  Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is a set of symptoms that can occur if you are taking 
antipsychotic medicines, including ADASUVE. These symptoms can be high fever, rigid muscles, 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
irregular or fast heart rate or pulse. NMS can cause death. Do not use ADASUVE again if NMS 
occurs. 
•  Antipsychotic medicines like ADASUVE can cause movements that you may not be able to 
control including making faces, sticking out your tongue, smacking or puckering your lips, 
blinking rapidly, or moving your legs, arms or fingers rapidly. Treatment with ADASUVE may 
have to be stopped if this occurs. 
•  ADASUVE should be used with caution in patients who are intoxicated or delirious. 
Before treatment with ADASUVE, tell your doctor or nurse if you: 
• 
have or had breathing problems like asthma or other chronic lung diseases such as bronchitis or 
emphysema 
have or had heart problems or stroke 
have or had low or high blood pressure 
have or had seizures (convulsions) 
have or had glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye) 
have or had urinary retention (incomplete emptying of the bladder)

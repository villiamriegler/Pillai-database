Mepolizumab  (Nucala)  is  a  humanised  immunoglobulin  G1k  (IgG1k)  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb),  and  is

produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells using recombinant DNA technology. Mepolizumab targets human 
interleukin-5 (IL-5) with high affinity and specificity. IL-5 is the major cytokine responsible for the growth 
and differentiation, recruitment, activation and survival of eosinophils. Mepolizumab inhibits the bioactivity 
of  IL-5  with  nanomolar  potency  by  blocking  the  binding  of  IL-5  to  the  alpha  chain  of  the  IL-5  receptor 
complex  expressed  on  the  eosinophil  cell  surface,  thereby  inhibiting  IL-5  signalling  and  reducing  the 
production and survival of eosinophils. 
Mepolizumab was approved in the EU in December 2015 as an add-on maintenance treatment for adult 
patients with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma administered subcutaneously. Mepolizumab has also 
been approved in a further 19 countries, and in the United States of America, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, 
Chile, Argentina, Mexico and Saudi Arabia this includes patients aged 12 years and older with severe 
eosinophilic asthma. According to the most recent Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report dated 19 May 
2017, cumulative post-marketing exposure to mepolizumab is estimated to be 5080.62 patient-years. 
Mepolizumab has also been in clinical development for the treatment of a range of eosinophilic indications 
including Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Nasal 
Polyposis, Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES) and Atopic Dermatitis. 
2.1.2.  Nature of the disease 
Asthma is a chronic, heterogeneous lung disease characterised by inflammation, narrowing of the airways, 
and reversible airway obstruction. The global prevalence of asthma for all ages is approximately 358 million 
people and affects 1% to 18% of the population in different countries. Severe asthma, which is defined as 
asthma requiring treatment according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines steps 4 to 5 or 
systemic corticosteroids for ≥50% of the previous year to prevent it becoming uncontrolled or remains 
uncontrolled despite this therapy, is estimated to occur in 5% to 10% of the total asthma population. Severe 
asthma patients frequently experience daily symptoms, such as cough and shortness of breath, and more 
often require Emergency Department visits and hospitalisations compared with patients with 
mild-to-moderate asthma. Furthermore, severe asthma patients with high blood eosinophil counts are at 
increased risk for asthma exacerbations compared with severe asthma patients without eosinophilia, and 
eosinophilic airway inflammation has been suggested to increase the risk of severe or difficult-to-control 
asthma. 
Asthma is the most common chronic disease among paediatric patients, and the prevalence of asthma 
symptoms in children ranges from 2.4% to 37.6% (6 to 7 year olds), and in adolescents from 0.8% to 32.6% 
(13 to 14 year olds). Deaths due to asthma in the paediatric population are rare, but measurable (range 0.0 
to 0.7/100,000), and prevalence of disease is correlated with hospital admissions and mortality. Although 
the proportion of severe asthmatics among paediatric asthma patients is less than adult asthma patients, 
the severity of disease is greater among children and adolescents as evidenced by the frequency of ED visits 
and hospitalisations. In addition, asthma is the leading cause of childhood morbidity from chronic disease as 
measured by school absences, ED visits and hospitalisations. A subset of paediatric patients with severe 
asthma are managed with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, yet frequently require the addition of chronic 
oral corticosteroids; the use of such medications is accompanied by significant adverse events. 
Severe asthma is heterogeneous, with recognized phenotypes such as atopic, obese and eosinophilic. The 
predominant phenotypes among paediatric severe asthma patients are related to atopy, with a small subset 
with increased peripheral blood eosinophilia. Overall, eosinophilic asthma in children and adolescents is 
rare; ≤1% of paediatric patients were classified as having severe uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma in a 
GSK-led database study of United Kingdom (UK) primary care. Nevertheless, among those children and 
adolescents, there is a risk for near-fatal or fatal events. While the representation of severe eosinophilic 
asthma is small in the paediatric population, the burden can be greater compared with adults. Therefore, this 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 8/104 
 
  
  
group is at high risk of serious untoward outcomes, and new treatment modalities are needed to improve 
asthma control and quality of life. 
2.1.3.  Current therapies and unmet need 
The treatment of asthma in children over 5 years follows that of adolescents and adults, i.e., a step-up 
approach determined by the patient’s level of control. For patients whose asthma is difficult to control (i.e., 
those that are uncontrolled on GINA Step 4 and require GINA Step 5), recommended treatment options on 
top of medium- (or high-dose) ICS plus a long-acting beta agonist include adding tiotropium in patients ≥12 
years old with a history of exacerbations, or an anti-IgE treatment, e.g., omalizumab (Xolair) where 
available. Omalizumab is an add-on therapy approved for subcutaneous administration in moderate to 
severe persistent asthma in patients (≥6 years of age in Europe) with a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity 
to a perennial aeroallergen. For patients aged ≥12 years with severe eosinophilic asthma uncontrolled at 
Step 4, anti-interleukin-5 treatment (such as subcutaneous mepolizumab) is recommended, though in 
various parts of the world (including the EU), the licence for mepolizumab is restricted to patients ≥18 years, 
and intravenous reslizumab is currently only approved in the EU in patients ≥18 years. For patients <12 
years, the only add-on therapy currently available is omalizumab which is restricted to patients with severe 
allergic asthma. GINA also states that some patients at Step 5 may benefit from low dose OCS but cautions 
that long term systemic side effects occur. A subset of paediatric severe asthma patients are treated with 
OCS, with estimates of maintenance OCS use ranging from 9.9% to 19.8%; the use of such medications in 
paediatric patients are associated with many of the adverse events observed in adults, with the additional 
burden of impaired growth, and greater susceptibility to certain AEs than adults. Despite the use of 
long-term controller medications including OCS, severe asthma patients still report high rates of healthcare 
utilization with many failing to achieve control. 
Thus, in paediatrics with severe asthma when treatment at GINA step 4 has been unsuccessful, and in 
particular in those patients with an eosinophilic phenotype with repeat exacerbations, treatment options are 
currently very limited. Therefore, there is an unmet need for new medications to provide asthma control in 
these patients. 
2.2.  Quality 
The current approved lyophilized presentation for NUCALA (mepolizumab) solution for injection 100 mg/ vial 
is proposed to support the new indication at a recommended dose of 40 mg for children aged 6 to 11 years 
old and 100 mg for children and adolescents aged 12 years and older. 
Minor quality changes are included and considered acceptable in this submission which includes additional 
clinical drug product batch identification and dose dependent calculations in support of the approved 
specifications and dose dependent controls for raw material clearance and exposure.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of mepolizumab have been characterised in a series 
studies  and  the  reports  have  been  previously  submitted  and  reviewed  for  the  NUCALA  Marketing 
Authorisation  Application.  In  this  submission  to  extend  the  indication  to  severe  eosinophilic  asthma  in 
paediatrics,  non-clinical  data  previously  submitted  and  reviewed  for  NUCALA  are  not  being  included. 
Consequently, the MAH has submitted only the studies carried out after the submission of the MAA, i.e. two 
primary pharmacological studies and one analytical method validation, which are summarised below. This is 
acceptable to the CHMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 9/104 
 
  
  
There are no  new degradants (related substances) or impurities in the drug  product (DP) different from 
those  discussed  at  the  time  of  the  MAA.  Nevertheless,  the  MAH  has  conducted  a  risk  assessment  for 
elemental impurities in the DP which shows that the levels are below the thresholds indicated in the ICH Q3D 
guideline. 
No other new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
A high resolution crystal structure for mepolizumab Fab fragments bound to recombinant IL-5 was 
determined in an in-vitro study. The steric hindrance by the full mepolizumab antibody was reported to 
inhibit the binding of hIL-5 to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The study report 2015N262160_00 describes the in silico identification of the most similar homologue to 
human IL-5. These analyses have been performed to investigate potential cross-reactivity of mepolizumab 
with other human cytokines. 
Sequence-based protein database searches and structural comparisons demonstrated that human IL-5 had 
very little sequence similarity to any other human proteins. IL-5 belongs to the SCOP‘short-chain cytokine
’ family, which is a ‘4-helical cytokine’ fold from the‘all alpha proteins’ class. Structural comparisons 
to other short-chain 4-helical cytokines structures identified interleukin-13 (IL-13) as the cytokine with the 
highest residue identity across the mepolizumab defined IL-5 binding epitope, with only 13% identity. 
Based on this low level of identity, mepolizumab would not be expected to show cross-reactivity to human 
IL-13. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical method and validation reports conducted since the initial submission of NUCALA are listed in study 
report 2016N297144. This provides information regarding the assay procedures for analysis of mepolizumab 
in plasma using the ELISA method in Heparin Human Plasma (Long-term Stability - 1 Month at -80°C). 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  MAH  did  not  submit  an  environmental  risk  assessment.  The  lack  of  environmental  risk  assessment 
(ERA) is justified according to the current ERA guideline (CPMP/SWP/4447/00), since therapeutic antibodies 
such as mepolizumab are proteins which are not excreted unchanged and do not give rise to metabolites 
with potential biological activity.  
2.3.5.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The results of the newly submitted pharmacological studies support the specific of mepolizumab and the lack 
of potential off-target effects on human proteins other than IL-5. These results have no impact neither on 
the SmPC nor on the EPAR. 
The MAH has stated that there are no differences in the physiopathology for this indication due to the age. 
Upon request from CHMP the company provided further information in relation to possible effects of

inhibition of IL-5 signaling for the developmental process. The MAH has conducted a scientific literature 
review on the potential effects of the blocking of IL-5 signalling pathways in children and adolescents. The 
review is quite comprehensive, including 18 literature references dated from 1996 to 2017 and the publicly 
available results for two other recently approved biologics that bind to IL-5 (reslizumab; Cinqair, 2016) or 
IL-5rα (benralizumab; Fasenra, 2016) [FDA Pharmacology Reviews for Cinqair and Fasenra]. The published 
results are presented together with proprietary data. Altogether, there are no toxicities identified to suggest 
any cause for developmental concerns. Based on the results presented, there is neither need to add any new 
information on the SmPC nor to include any related potential risk to the RMP. 
Considering the above data, mepolizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.4.2.  Rationale for an extrapolation from adult to paediatric patients of the 
use of mepolizumab in severe refractory eosinophilic asthma 
The phenotype of severe asthma with eosinophilic inflammation generally has a late onset and consequently 
is predominant in adults. Nonetheless, elevated eosinophils in the lung and blood have been demonstrated 
in adolescents (12 to 17 years) and children (6 to 11 years) with severe asthma, and with few treatment 
options available there is an unmet medical need in the paediatric population. However, due to the low 
incidence in the paediatric population (<1%), the conduct of traditional clinical efficacy studies in a 
paediatric population is challenging and considered not feasible in a reasonable timeframe.  
In view of this a partial extrapolation approach was agreed with the Paediatric Committee (PIP 
EMEA-000069-PIP02-10), in which limited data is collected in the target population, with extrapolation of 
efficacy and safety data from the Phase III studies included in the mepolizumab severe asthma development 
programme. 
The evidence to support a partial extrapolation strategy is based on the overlap in the clinical presentation 
of both adult and paediatric severe eosinophilic asthma, consistency in therapeutic approach, consistency of 
mepolizumab mechanism of action, and relevance of the clinical endpoints for both efficacy and safety. 
2.4.2.1.  Appropriateness of extrapolating mepolizumab data from adults to paediatrics 
The relevance of the clinical efficacy and safety data from the mepolizumab adult/adolescent severe 
eosinophilic asthma programme to paediatric patients is supported by the consistent eligibility criteria that 
were applied irrespective of age (requirement for previous exacerbation history and high ICS dose [with 
allowance for medium dose for adolescents]) in the mepolizumab paediatric and adult/adolescent studies, 
and data from these studies show the similarity of baseline markers of the disease in the different age 
groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 12/104 
 
  
  
 
The primary endpoint in studies MEA115588 and MEA112997 in the adult/adolescent severe asthma 
programme was the frequency of clinically significant exacerbations. The adult/adolescent programme also 
included endpoints of pre-and post-forced expiratory flow in 1 second (FEV1), asthma control 
questionnaire-5 (ACQ-5), daily peak flow, daily rescue medication use, nocturnal awakenings, and OCS use 
as clinical endpoints. Similar to adults, these clinical endpoints are important and used to assess the level of 
control of a paediatric asthma patient as well as to adjust medications as needed.  
The reduction of asthma exacerbations was a measure included in Study 200363 in children 6-11 years, and 
while supportive, data from this uncontrolled, open-label, clinical trial over a short period of time (12 weeks) 
do not provide a complete assessment of efficacy in this age group; therefore, extrapolation of efficacy from 
the adult/adolescent programme to the paediatric population provides supportive information for the 
efficacy of mepolizumab in paediatrics. 
Further support for extrapolation of adult data to paediatrics is provided by the treatment approach for 
asthma in children over 5 years which follows that of adolescents and adults, i.e., a step-up approach 
determined by the patient’s level of control, with the aim of achieving early control and maintaining it; 
national and international guidelines are similar [GINA, 2017; BTS, 2016]. For patients whose asthma is 
difficult to control (i.e., GINA Step 5), treatment options on top of medium- (or high-dose) ICS plus a LABA 
are described in Section 4.1.3 above; these options are limited for adolescent patients and even more 
limited for children. 
2.4.2.1.  Key steps of the proposed extrapolation strategy 
The key steps of the MAHs proposed extrapolation strategy are summarised below and are aligned with the 
EMA Concept paper on extrapolation of efficacy and safety in medicine development, and more recent EMA 
Reflection paper on extrapolation of efficacy and safety in paediatric medicine development: 
1. Confirm that mepolizumab is efficacious with a favourable benefit-risk profile in adult subjects with severe 
eosinophilic asthma (Studies MEA112997, MEA115588 and MEA115575). These data together with data 
from Study 200862 form the basis of extrapolation to paediatric subjects. 
2. Confirm that mepolizumab PK in adults is predictive of PK in paediatrics following both IV and SC 
administration (predictability of available paediatric PK data in severe asthma [6 to 17 years] and EoE). 
3. Confirm that mepolizumab blood eosinophil count reduction in adults is predictive of the blood eosinophil 
count reduction in paediatrics following both IV and SC administration (predictability of available paediatric 
blood eosinophil count data in severe asthma [6 to 17 years] and EoE). 
4. Provide supportive evidence that mepolizumab efficacy in adults with severe asthma can be extrapolated 
to the paediatric population (adolescents [12 to 17 years]) and that establishing this evidence in adolescents 
is sufficient to extend this approach to the 6 to 11 years age group. 
5. Evaluate the safety profile in the paediatric population (6 to 17 years) with severe eosinophilic asthma and 
compare with that of the overall Phase III severe

STUDY TITLE: A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
mepolizumab in the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis in subjects receiving standard 
of care therapy. 
Objectives: The primary objectives of the study were to investigate the efficacy of mepolizumab compared 
with placebo on accrued duration of clinical remission in subjects with relapsing or refractory EGPA receiving 
standard of care therapy, including corticosteroid therapy reduction/withdrawal, and the durability of 
response to treatment with mepolizumab compared with placebo, assessed by the proportion of subjects in 
remission at both Weeks 36 and 48. 
The study also investigated the efficacy of mepolizumab compared with placebo on time to relapse, the 
average daily dose of oral corticosteroid required during the last 4 weeks of the study treatment period, the 
proportion of subjects who achieved remission within the first 24 weeks of the study and remained in 
remission for the remainder of the study treatment period and the safety of mepolizumab compared with 
placebo. Furthermore the study investigated additional measures of the efficacy and quality of life including 
duration of remission; relapse; corticosteroid reduction; Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score; Vasculitis 
Damage Index; health-related quality of life (Short Form-36); asthma symptoms (Asthma Control 
Questionnaire-6 and lung function tests); sino-nasal symptoms (including the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 
questionnaire); blood eosinophil counts and biomarkers of inflammation, the PK of mepolizumab, serum 
total IL-5 levels, Fractional Concentration of Exhaled Nitric Oxide, immunogenicity, impact on work and 
activity (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire), and to monitor healthcare resource 
utilisation during the study. 
Study Design: This was a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study 
of mepolizumab in subjects with a history of relapsing or refractory EGPA on stable corticosteroid therapy 
with or without concomitant stable immunosuppressant therapy. Subjects were randomised 1:1 to receive 
either mepolizumab SC 300 mg or placebo SC treatments (68 per group) every 4 weeks administered into 
the upper arm, thigh or anterior abdominal wall. The study comprised a treatment period of 52 weeks and 
an 8-week follow-up period. Where possible, subjects withdrawn from study treatment prematurely were to 
continue to be followed up until the end of the study. Blood samples were collected in all subjects for PK 
(sparse sampling), eosinophil count, serum IL-5 and anti-mepolizumab antibody assessment. 
Results: One hundred and thirty-six subjects were enrolled into the study. The PK data from this study were 
analysed using population PK methods and data were well described with the most recent population PK 
model applied directly to the dataset without modification and without estimation step (i.e., maxevals=0 in 
NONMEM). The ability of the model to describe the observed data in the study was confirmed with goodness 
of fit tests: Wilcoxon, Ansari-Bradley, Conover, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov. No additional covariates beyond 
the one already included in the model (bodyweight, creatinine clearance and albumin) were identified. 
Predicted mepolizumab trough and maximum observed concentration (Cmax) concentrations showed 
two-fold accumulation when dosed every four weeks, and steady-state being reached by at least Week 28. 
Mepolizumab 300 mg SC was very effective at reducing (within 4 weeks of treatment) blood eosinophil count 
and maintaining the reduction throughout the treatment period. Blood eosinophil reduction relative to 
placebo was 83% at Week 52. After adjusting for blood eosinophil baseline, the blood eosinophil response to 
mepolizumab in subjects with EGPA was no different to that observed in subjects with other eosinophilic 
conditions. 
Conclusion: The PK of mepolizumab in subjects with EGPA was wholly consistent with previous populations, 
confirming these findings in a de novo population. Likewise, in a background of steroid reduction, the blood 
eosinophil reduction was consistent with previous populations after adjusting for blood eosinophil baseline 
only.

Study 200363 Part A (Phase II Paediatric Study) 
STUDY TITLE: An open-label uncontrolled study to characterise the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of mepolizumab administered subcutaneously in children from 6 to 11 years of age with 
severe eosinophilic asthma. 
Objectives: The primary objectives of the study Part A were to characterise the PK as well as the PD of 
mepolizumab administered subcutaneously to subjects aged 6 to 11 years old with severe eosinophilic 
asthma. Secondary objectives were to compare the bodyweight-adjusted clearance between adults and 
subjects aged 6 to 11 years old with severe eosinophilic asthma and to assess asthma control as well as 
safety and tolerability of mepolizumab when administered subcutaneously. Exploratory objectives were to 
assess the number of asthma exacerbations that occur during the study and forced expiratory volume in 1 
second (FEV1). 
The primary objective of the study Part B, which is  on-going at time of this report, is to assess the long-term 
(52 weeks) safety and tolerability of mepolizumab and as a secondary objective the long-term durability of 
PD of mepolizumab administered subcutaneously. Exploratory objectives are to assess the number of 
asthma exacerbations that occur during the 52 weeks part of the study and the long-term asthma control. 
Study Design: This was a multi-centre, open-label, repeat-dose study in subjects aged 6 to 11 years old with 
severe eosinophilic asthma. Subjects received mepolizumab 40 or 100 mg SC, depending on subject 
bodyweight (40 mg for subjects <40 kg and 100 mg for subjects ≥40 kg), every 4 weeks for a total of three 
doses in Part A. Doses were administered into the upper arm or thigh. The study Part A comprised a 
treatment period of 12 weeks and an 8 week follow-up period. Blood samples were collected in all subjects 
for PK (sparse sampling), eosinophil count, serum IL-5 and anti-mepolizumab antibody assessment. 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Males or females, between 6 and 11 years of age inclusive at 
screening with a diagnosis of severe asthma for at least 1 year, as defined by regional asthma guidelines, 
were eligible for inclusion. Subjects were required to have eosinophilic airway inflammation that was related 
to asthma; this was characterised as eosinophilic in nature as indicated by: a peripheral blood eosinophil 
count of ≥300 cells/μL demonstrated within 12 months of screening or a peripheral blood eosinophil count 
of ≥150 cells/μL at Visit 1. Subjects were also required to have a well-documented requirement for regular 
treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid (>200 μg/day fluticasone propionate dry powder inhaler or 
equivalent daily) therapy, in the 12 months prior to Visit 1, with or without maintenance oral corticosteroids 
and were to have been on current treatment with an additional controller medication for at least 3 months 
(or had a documented treatment failure in the past 12 months of an additional controller medication, for at 
least 3 successive months). Subjects were to have a persistent airflow obstruction at either Visit 1 or Visit 2 
(a pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second <110% predicted, or FEV1:forced vital capacity 
ratio <0.8) and had a confirmed history of 2 or more exacerbations requiring treatment with systemic 
corticosteroids, in the 12 months prior to Visit 1, despite the use of ICS. For subjects receiving maintenance 
OCS, the treatment for the exacerbations must have been a 2-fold or greater increase in the CS dose. 
Results: Thirty six subjects were enrolled into the study; 26 subjects to 40 mg SC (weight <40 kg) and 10 
subjects to 100 mg SC (weight ≥40 kg). The PK data from this study were analysed using population PK 
methods. Derived exposures (area under the concentration time curve from zero [pre-dose] extrapolated to 
infinite time [AUC0-inf]) normalised to the average bodyweight in each of the dose groups were 454 
μg.day/mL for the 40 mg SC treatment group (weight <40 kg) and 675 μg.day/mL for the 100 mg SC 
treatment group (weight ≥40 kg). These exposures remain within 2-fold of the historical target adult 
exposure of 343 μg.day/mL (MEA115588). The estimated t½ was approximately 23 days. The MAH indicated 
that the historical  adult value of 343 μg.day/mL is the geometric mean of the post-hoc individual AUC 
estimates in the 100 mg SC group for the average body weight in study MEA115588 which was 75 kg. This 
confirms that the value could be used to compare the exposure to other age groups which were also 
normalised to the average body weight.    
Assessment report

Mepolizumab was effective at reducing blood eosinophil count with geometric mean reductions (ratio to 
baseline) at Week 12 following 40 mg SC and 100 mg SC of 89% and 83%, respectively. Mepolizumab 
bodyweight-adjusted apparent clearance (normalised to 70 kg) was slightly lower than seen previously in 
adults (0.20 versus 0.29 L/day). The most recent population PK and PK/PD models well described 
observations in children 6 to 11 years old after adjustment for bodyweight and bioavailability (complete 
absorption versus 76%). 
Conclusion: Following 40 mg SC (weight <40 kg) and 100 mg SC (weight ≥40 kg) mepolizumab predicted 
exposures (AUC0-inf) was within 2-fold of the historic adult target value. Further dose adjustment beyond 
that tested in the study is therefore not deemed necessary based on mepolizumab’s wide therapeutic index. 
The blood eosinophil reduction was consistent with previous data in adults with severe eosinophilic asthma. 
The difference observed in exposure and bodyweight-adjusted apparent clearance is most likely explained 
by increased bioavailability in children aged 6 to 11 years old (complete absorption versus 76%). 
Exploratory population PK and PK/PD analyses confirmed that extrapolation from adult exposure (PK), and 
blood eosinophil count response (PK/PD), to children 6 to 11 years old with severe eosinophilic asthma is 
valid after adjustment for bodyweight and bioavailability.

Pharmacokinetics in Other Populations 
Nasal Polyposis (NP) 
Study MPP111782 (Phase IIa Study) 
STUDY TITLE: A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, multi-centre study to investigate the use of 
mepolizumab (SB-240563) in reducing the need for surgery in subjects with severe bilateral nasal polyposis. 
Objectives: The primary objective of the study was to define the effect of mepolizumab in reducing the need 
for surgery, defined as reduced endoscopic polyp score and symptom score after six months of dosing. In 
addition, the study was to investigate the effects of 750 mg doses of mepolizumab on nasal polyp size; the 
actual requirement for polyp surgery during the study; to further assess the safety, tolerability and 
immunogenicity of mepolizumab; the effects on associated lower respiratory tract symptoms, inflammation 
and function; the effects on clinical PD assessments; and to characterise the population PK and PK/PD of 
mepolizumab. 
Study Design: This was a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study 
in adult subjects with severe bilateral NP. Subjects were randomised 1:1 to receive mepolizumab IV 750 mg 
or placebo. The IV infusions were administered over 30 minutes. Subjects received 6 doses of study 
treatment administered every 4 weeks over a period of 24 weeks and then were followed up to 44 weeks. 
Blood samples were collected in all subjects for PK, eosinophil count and anti-mepolizumab antibody 
assessment, along with nasal secretion samples. 
Results: One hundred and nine subjects were enrolled into the study. All concentration-time profiles were 
analysed using a previously established population PK model with 2 compartments and IV bolus input. 
Bodyweight was incorporated into the model as a fixed effect with conventional fixed allometric scaling 
powers of unity for volume and 0.75 for clearance. 
Mepolizumab 750 mg IV showed expected PK, consistent with previous analyses, with bodyweight-adjusted 
clearance of 0.22 L/day, volume of distribution at steady-state of 7.1 L, distribution half-life of 1.5 days, and 
a t½ of 24 days. 
An Imax direct response model was fitted to serial blood eosinophil count data from both mepolizumab and 
placebo treatment using model-predicted mepolizumab concentrations, on account of the rapid eosinophil 
dynamics (compared with PK). Consistent with previous analyses, baseline blood eosinophil count was 
included as the only covariate and baseline and maximum inhibitory effect were modelled as random effects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 16/104 
 
  
  
The concentration associated with 50% of the maximal effect (IC50) was estimated at 4.4 μg/mL and 
maximum inhibition at 90.1%. 
Conclusion: Mepolizumab 750 mg IV demonstrated expected PK in subjects with severe bilateral NP, 
confirming disease is not a covariate of mepolizumab exposure. 
Mepolizumab 750 mg IV demonstrated a profound reduction in blood eosinophil count with similar maximum 
inhibition of 90.1% as previously observed in other eosinophilic conditions. The concentration providing 
half-maximal effect of 4.4 μg/mL appears higher than estimates in previous analyses which might reflect the 
higher baseline blood eosinophil count in this study, that was observed in absence of inhaled and oral 
corticosteroids, compared with previous studies in other eosinophilic conditions. 
Paediatrics 
In the initial application mepolizumab IV PK from a paediatric study conducted in subjects aged 2 to 17 years 
old with EoE (MEE103219) at IV doses of 0.55, 2.5 and 10 mg/kg as well as IV and SC PK from adolescents 
(12 to 17 years) dosed with 75, 250 mg IV or 100 mg SC, included in the severe asthma Phase III program, 
were presented. The similarity in mepolizumab PK between 59 paediatrics 2 to 17 years and adults following 
IV administration was demonstrated by the ability of the adult IV PK model to predict paediatric observations 
without parameter estimation or bias. Furthermore, the relationship between predicted clearance or volume 
of distribution and bodyweight confirmed conventional allometric scaling, typical for therapeutic proteins. 
Nineteen adolescents aged 12 to 17 years old, enrolled in the severe asthma clinical development program 
supporting the initial submission, received mepolizumab SC or IV. Population PK analysis of combined adult 
and adolescent data in the individual studies did not identify age as a covariate of mepolizumab exposure 
after adjusting for bodyweight, and concentrations in adolescents were consistent with adults. Predicted 
clearance in adolescent subjects was also within the rest of the study population range, irrespective of 
administration route. The mean apparent clearance in the 9 adolescents who received 100 mg SC was 35% 
less than that of adults and no dose adjustment was therefore considered necessary in the adolescent age 
group. 
Additionally, a population PK meta-analysis of combined adult and paediatric data (including studies 
MEA112997, MEA115588, MEA115575 and MEE103219) from 13 mepolizumab studies encompassing 
various eosinophilic conditions showed that at similar bodyweights, the ranges of clearance and volume are 
comparable between adult and paediatric subjects.  
What remained unknown however at the time of the initial submission was mepolizumab PK in children 6 to 
11 years old following SC administration. A Phase II paediatric PK/PD study (200363 Part A) has since been 
conducted in subject aged 6 to 11 years old with severe eosinophilic asthma to complete our understanding 
of mepolizumab PK following SC administration in the paediatric population. Sparse PK samples (6 blood 
samples), to minimise discomfort in this young population, were collected throughout the Part A of the 
study, and analysed using population PK methods. The doses of 40 mg SC in subjects weighing less than 40 
kg and 100 mg SC for those weighing 40 kg or more in this 6 to 11 years old age group were selected after 
investigation by simulation, based on the PK knowledge accumulated following both IV and SC 
administration in adults and adolescents and IV administration in children. A comparison of selected 
population PK parameter estimates in Study 200363 Part A and in the most recent population PK 
meta-analysis is presented in Table 3.

Table 3: Summary of Selected Population PK parameter estimates from paediatric 
study 200363 Part A (primary analysis) and from meta-analysis of 13 studies 
Derived exposures (AUC0-inf) normalised to the average bodyweight in each of the dose groups were 454 
μg.day/mL (n=26) for the 40 mg SC treatment group (weight <40 kg) and 675 μg.day/mL (n=10) for the 
100 mg SC treatment group (weight ≥40 kg). These exposures were higher than originally predicted from the 
adult model but remained within 2-fold of the historical target adult exposure of 343 μg.day/mL from Phase 
III exacerbation study MEA115588 (1.32-fold at 40 mg SC [weight <40 kg] and 1.97-fold at 100 mg SC 
[weight ≥40 kg]). 
Since the adult IV model was able to accurately predict the IV data from the paediatric 2 to 17 years subjects 
with eosinophilic oesophagitis, rather than lower clearance, a difference in bioavailability was hypothesised 
and tested. The meta-analysis PK model was therefore applied to the children (6 to 11 years) SC data from 
Study 200363 Part A, with estimation of bioavailability and allometric exponents. Although the confidence 
interval (CI) around the bioavailability point estimate of 105% (95% CI: 55%, 155%) was large, there was 
evidence suggesting a higher bioavailability in children 6 to 11 years (complete absorption) compared to 
adults (76%). This is a physiologically plausible explanation since children tend to have lower body mass 
index. 
The difference in exposure between adults and adolescents at 100 mg SC in the Phase III exacerbation study 
(MEA115588) was less evident than in children 6 to 11 years old weighing 40 kg or more, suggesting that 
bioavailability in adolescents might be closer to adults. The number of children (weight ≥40 kg) who received 
100 mg SC was however small (n=10). Nonetheless, in absence of safety signal observed with mepolizumab 
at doses up to 750 mg IV (10-fold higher than the target dose exposure), this two-fold target is in keeping 
with general guidance on both drug-drug interactions and hepatic and renal impairment, where drugs with 
a wide therapeutic index (such as mepolizumab) do not require dose adjustment. 
The proposed dosing scheme tested in Study 200363 for a children population 6 to 11 years old is therefore 
considered acceptable and no further dose adjustment beyond the one proposed is recommended for this 
age group. 
The MAH indicated that the SC bioavailability estimates in adolescent population of study MEA115588 was 
91% which was considered closer to the 80% SC bioavailability of combined adult and adolescent population 
of the same study in contrast to the complete absorption values (105%) in children 6-11 years in study 
200363. However, the MAH claim is not agreed because the MAH did not provide an estimate for the 
bioavailability in the adult population only. In fact, the MAH indicated elsewhere that the bioavailability in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 18/104 
 
  
  
 
 
adults is ~76% which makes adolescent population 91% closer to 6-11 children 105% bioavailability. 
Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether the bioavailability in adolescents (91%) is more comparable 
to adults or children 6-11 years old. However, this issue will not be further pursued as the PK in adolescent 
population is not subject for assessment during the current procedure. 
The MAH also indicated that the 35% lower clearance in adolescent population was calculated as the ratio of 
the geometric mean for clearance between adolescents and adults across studies MEA115575 and 
MEA115588. The clearance was not adjusted for body weight. Therefore, the MAH justification is acceptable.      
The MAH was asked to further discuss the physiological mechanism by which lower body mass index 
increases the bioavailability from SC administered mepolizumab. The MAH suggested that the thickness of 
the hypodermis has been shown to increase with body mass index and decrease with age. Therefore, 
possible differences in the structure of the hypodermis between adults and paediatric population might lead 
to the observed difference in the SC bioavailability of mepolizumab. 
The MAH provided the table for comparison of PK parameters between the paediatric data from 200363 Part 
A and the paediatric sub-population in the meta-analysis. The PK values showed a slightly lower central and 
intercompartmental clearance and slightly higher central and peripheral volumes of distribution in the study 
200363 Part A compared to the meta-analysis. However, due to the low magnitude of the difference (~20% 
for most of the PK parameters except for the intercompartmental clearance which was fixed value in the 
meta-analysis) in PK parameters, it can be considered that the two paediatric populations have a similar PK 
characteristic.    
Population PK for SC Mepolizumab in 6-11 years old paediatric population with 
severe eosinophilic asthma 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis (Primary Analysis)  
The most recent population PK model (two-compartment model with first order absorption and first order 
elimination), was used. Data from subjects who received 40 mg SC (weight <40 kg) and 100 mg SC (weight 
≥40 kg) mepolizumab were modelled simultaneously. The analysis was conducted using SAS software 
(Version 9.2). The distribution parameters and bioavailability were fixed to adult values in view of the sparse 
sampling implemented and the only extravascular route of administration investigated in the study. The 
need to fix additional parameters or to assess specific parameters was then evaluated as well as the 
inclusion of a random effect. The model with the lowest Bayesian Information Criteria was retained as the 
final model and for which the population-PK parameter estimates with 95% CI are presented in Table 11.

Goodness of fit for the final model, as demonstrated by conventional plots and normal prediction distribution 
error (NPDE), are shown in Source Data Figure 2.3. The observed, population and individual predicted 
mepolizumab plasma concentrations versus time after dose profiles are presented in Figure 2.1 and Figure

and bootstrap resampling of subject covariates and presented in Figure 2.6.

In order to evaluate the concordance between the individual predicted and observed plasma concentrations 
in the study, a set of statistical tests were applied: Wilcoxon, Ansari-Bradley, Conover and 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov. All tests supported that there was no evidence of an absence of model fit at the 5%

significance level. Furthermore, based on the following tests: Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramér–
von Mises and Anderson-Darling, there was also no evidence at the 5% significance level to suggest that the 
observations and predictions were drawn from different distributions (: Figure 2.3 [Page 4]). It was 
therefore concluded that the final model was able to accurately predict mepolizumab plasma concentrations 
in the 6 to 11 years old paediatric population with severe eosinophilic asthma. 
Mepolizumab plasma concentration-time profile were similar between Japanese and non-Japanese subjects 
(Figure 2.5) and in subjects with or without presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) (Figure 2.4).

Population PK parameter estimates were normalised to 70 kg (bodyweight not observed in the study but 
typical adult bodyweight for comparison with historic data), and mean bodyweights for the 2 weight groups: 
50 kg (in the ≥40 kg group receiving 100 mg SC); and 27 kg (in the <40 kg group receiving 40 mg SC). 
Population predicted AUC(0-inf) exposure normalised to 50 kg was within 1.5-fold of that normalised to 27 
kg and both exposures were within 2-fold of the historical target adult value of 343 μg. day/mL from the 
Phase III exacerbation study MEA115588. Dose adjustment beyond that studied is therefore not deemed 
necessary in children age 6 to 11 years old. Apparent clearance normalised to 70 kg was slightly lower than 
that observed in adults while the t½ (approximately 23 days) was comparable to previous adult data (16 to 
22 days). 
Exploratory Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
An exploratory analysis using the most recent population PK model (meta-analysis model) was conducted on 
the same analysis dataset as before to support an extrapolation strategy. In order to better understand the 
observed slightly lower bodyweight-adjusted apparent clearance compared with adults, minimal changes 
were made to the model, with only absolute bioavailability, allometric exponents, and residual estimated de 
novo. All other parameters (including clearance) were fixed to previous values. Analysis was conducted 
using NONMEM software (version 7.2). 
Goodness of fit for the model, as demonstrated by conventional plots and NPDE, are shown in Figure 2.8. 
The observed, population and individual predicted mepolizumab plasma concentrations versus time after 
dose profiles are presented in Figure 2.9. Final model performance was also assessed using Visual Predictive 
Check, as shown in Figure 2.10, with incorporation of parameter uncertainty and bootstrap resampling of 
subject covariates.

Concordance between individual predicted and observed plasma concentrations was assessed using the 
following goodness of fit tests: Wilcoxon, Ansari-Bradley, Conover and Kolmogorov-Smirnov. All tests

showed no evidence of absence of model fit at the 5% significance level. Furthermore, based on the 
following tests: Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov Smirnov, Cramér–von Mises and Anderson-Darling, there was 
also no evidence at the 5% significance level to suggest that the observations and predictions were drawn 
from different distributions (Figure 2.8). 
The estimate of SC absolute bioavailability was 105% (95% CI: 55-155%) and allometric exponents for 
clearance and volumes were 0.86 (95% CI: 0.29-1.43) and 0.66 (95% CI: 0.11-1.21), respectively. 
The impact of continuous and categorical covariates on individual PK parameter estimates was examined by 
visual inspection (post-hoc), and formally using the GLMSELECT procedure in SAS 9.2 in a 
forward/backward approach. There was a trend in clearance and volumes with bodyweight, body mass 
index, height and age. After correction for bodyweight, this trend disappeared for clearance. Gender and 
race were not covariates of mepolizumab exposure.  
These findings were further confirmed by visual inspection (Figure 2.31) with a clear effect of bodyweight 
category on clearance (CL) but no effect for race (Japanese/non-Japanese and African 
American-African/non-African American-African). 
2.4.4.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of action of mepolizumab is well established. Mepolizumab blocks the binding of IL-5 to the 
alpha chain of the IL-5 receptor complex expressed on theeosinophil cell surface and thus inhibits IL-5 
signalling and its downstream effects, i.e. the promotion, growth and survival of eosinophils in blood, 
sputum and other tissues. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 33/104 
 
  
  
 
Mepolizumab produces a sustained, consistent, dose-dependent reduction in blood eosinophil count, 
irrespective of disease, or administration route, with maximum eosinopenia of 90% due to IL-3 and 
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) redundancy. 
Blood eosinophil count reduction in adolescents (12 to 17 years) and children 
(6 to 11 years) with severe eosinophilic asthma. 
Consistent with observations in adults with severe asthma and other eosinophilic conditions, in the 
paediatric subjects treated with mepolizumab, blood eosinophils were markedly reduced. 
The validity of the blood eosinophils as a biomarker for clinically relevant effects has not been initially 
confirmed. While the PD aspects of the product in children and adults does appear to be sufficiently similar, 
the MAH was asked to further discuss on the limitations of the approach. Appropriately clarification on the 
link between the PD biomarker and the efficacy outcomes expected to be clinically meaningful to patients 
and clinicians was provided.  
Adolescents 
From the combined analysis of adolescents in Studies 200862 and MEA115588, the baseline geometric mean 
blood eosinophil counts were 265 cells/L in the placebo group and 293 cells/µL in the mepolizumab treated 
group, levels consistent with the overall population seen in Studies 200862 (350 cells/µL and 300 cells/µL in 
the placebo and mepolizumab 100 mg SC groups, respectively) and MEA115588 (280 to 320 cells/µL across 
the different treatment groups). At Week 12, following mepolizumab administration, the geometric mean 
absolute blood eosinophil count in the adolescent population was 33 cells/µL and this level of reduction was 
maintained at subsequent time-points. In the combined analysis of adolescents from Studies 200862 and 
MEA115588, the ratio to baseline at Week 12 was 89% following mepolizumab and was consistent with the 
overall reduction of 87% seen with 100 mg SC at Week 12 in the MEA115588 study overall. 
When considering the studies separately, in the adolescents included in study MEA115588 and 200862, a 
reduction from baseline in blood eosinophils at week 12 of 90% (absolute blood eosinophil count 30 cells/µL) 
and 92% (absolute blood eosinophil count 32 cells/µL), respectively, was observed following 100 mg SC. 
This is similar to the combined adult/adolescent data: MEA115588 (87%, absolute blood eosinophil count 40 
cells/µL) and 200862 (80%, absolute blood eosinophil count 60 cells/µL).

The ratio to baseline over time in blood eosinophils in adolescents from the combined Studies 200862 and

Children 
Geometric mean baseline absolute blood eosinophil counts were 386, 331 and 370 cells/µL in the 
mepolizumab 40 mg SC (weight <40 kg), 100 mg SC (weight ≥40 kg) groups and overall, respectively. 
Marked and similar reductions in blood eosinophil counts were observed in subjects in the mepolizumab 40 
mg SC (weight <40 kg) and 100 mg SC (weight ≥40 kg) groups at Visit 3 (Week 4; first post-dose 
assessment); these reductions were sustained through to Week 12 (4 weeks after the last dose of 
mepolizumab). At Week 16, blood eosinophil counts had started to return towards baseline, however, by 
Week 20 counts had still not returned to baseline values. 
At Week 12, the geometric mean ratio of blood eosinophil count to baseline was 0.115 in the mepolizumab 
40 mg SC group (weight <40 kg), 0.166 in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group (weight ≥40 kg) and 0.129 
overall, indicating an 88.5%, 83.4% and 87.1% reduction, respectively.

Total Serum Interleukin-5 
Previously, in adult/adolescent studies in asthmatic patient’s serum IL-5 was not detectable in most subjects 
at baseline and total IL-5 concentrations were observed to increase during treatment with mepolizumab as 
a result of the formation of mepolizumab-IL-5 complexes, which decreased IL-5 clearance. 
In children aged 6-11 years in study 200363, for 28 out of the 36 subjects, the level of total serum IL-5 at 
baseline was below the limit of quantification of the assay (<7.81 ng/L). Five subjects in the mepolizumab 40 
mg SC group (weight <40 kg) and 3 subjects in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group (weight ≥40 kg) had 
measurable total serum IL-5 at baseline, with levels ranging from 10.68 to 508.83 ng/L. The geometric 
mean values were 6.52 ng/L in the mepolizumab 40 mg SC group (weight <40 kg), 7.39 ng/L in the 
mepolizumab 100 mg SC group (weight ≥40 kg) and 6.75 ng/L overall, respectively.

The Exit Visit (Week 12) was the only visit in this study at which total serum IL-5 was measured post 
mepolizumab dosing. At this visit, total serum IL-5 levels had increased from baseline in all subjects with an 
Exit Visit measurement except one (mepolizumab 40 mg SC [weight <40 kg]). This increase was anticipated 
since the total serum IL-5 assay is measuring both free IL-5 and IL-5 bound to mepolizumab and reflecting 
target engagement. The geometric mean values were 117.51 ng/L in the mepolizumab 40 mg SC group 
(weight <40 kg), 96.69 ng/L in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group (weight ≥40 kg) and 110.57 ng/L overall, 
respectively.

The Effect of Mepolizumab on Blood Eosinophil Count - A Dose Response Meta-analysis 
Data Analysis Plan 
This document describes the meta-analysis of an integrated dataset encompassing 16 studies to evaluate 
the dose-response for blood eosinophil count reduction following treatment with mepolizumab across 
indications. The various indications included are asthma (mild, moderate and severe), hypereosinophilic 
syndrome (HES), eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) and healthy volunteers. This dose-response analysis is 
conducted in support of the dose selection rationale for the phase 3 study planned in subjects with HES. 
Objectives 
1) To conduct a dose-response analysis of the integrated blood eosinophil data from studies conducted to 
date, irrespective of the indication, to support the dose rationale selection in the HES phase 3 study 
(200622). 
2) To extrapolate the dose-response model to incorporate the effects of higher baseline blood eosinophil 
count, consistent with HES patients. 
Endpoints 
Absolute blood eosinophil count 4 weeks post-last dose 
Datasets 
The analysis dataset consists of the integration of dose, PK and absolute blood eosinophil count data, 
together with selected covariates (when available), from 16 studies  
A number of covariates such as demographics (e.g. weight, age, BMI, height, gender...), baseline clinical 
status (e.g. creatinine clearance, serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase ...), baseline disease status 
(e.g. exacerbation history, blood eosinophil count...) were included in the dataset. Of note, some covariates 
(e.g. exacerbation history) were not available in all studies. A dataset specification document describing the 
content of the dataset guided the generation of the dataset. 
The dataset was manipulated, for example to add a treatment column (expressed in mg), the type of the 
study (single versus repeat dose), the study label to identify the nature of the observation (single dose, 
three doses, steady-state) and to select the blood eosinophil measurement collected 4 weeks post the last 
dose irrespective of the study type. The dose and treatment are expressed in absolute dose with appropriate 
conversion for the studies dosed in mg/kg. 
With the exception of the OLE studies, the blood eosinophil measurement selected for analysis was the 
measurement recorded at the planned time occurring four weeks after the last planned dose. In most studies 
this time coincides with the time of the endpoint of the studies. For the OLE studies MEA115666 and 
MEA115661, which were still on-going at the time of this dataset generation, the selected measurement was 
the last recorded blood eosinophil measurement at the cut-off time for each study. A minimum time after the 
first dose was implemented to ensure the measurement was approximately at steady-state (i.e., a minimum 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 38/104 
 
  
  
time after first dose greater than 110 days). Likewise data at approximately steady-state in the OLE study 
MHE100901 were selected; namely Stage 2 of the study. 
Subjects with missing baseline and/or 28-day blood eosinophil count were excluded from further analysis. 
Subjects with 28-day blood eosinophil count recorded as zero had an imputed value of 0.005.  
Methodology 
The absolute blood eosinophil count was analysed using generalised linear and nonlinear (sigmoid Emax) 
dose-response models. For comparison between models the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) was used, 
with lower values denoting better model fit. Study was treated as a random effect with between-study 
variability on intercept in all models. 
A dose-response analysis was selected for several reasons. First, the sampling schedule for absolute blood 
eosinophil count occurs mainly at maximum effect of the dose. Secondly, study MEA114092 provided a 
successful characterisation of the dose response for blood eosinophil count in a PK/PD study conducted in 
moderate/severe asthma subjects. Thirdly, adjustment for absolute bioavailability of the subcutaneous 
route is straightforward for monoclonal antibodies. Fourthly, the relatively slow pharmacokinetics 
(compared with pharmacodynamic response) means that bioavailability-adjusted dose is an excellent 
exposure measure not subject to between-subject variability. Finally, in clinical practice dose is a more 
accessible measure of drug exposure than plasma concentration. 
For the linear model, Log(absolute blood eosinophil count) was modelled, with dose (i.e., treatment) used as 
a class effect. Blood eosinophil count and ratios compared with placebo were estimated using least squares 
means with adjustment for multiple covariates. The non-linear model used a sigmoid Emax model for dose 
in place of the class effect and the following Emax model was used: 
Log(absolute blood eosinophil count) = ß0 + [(ß1*Dose**Slope) /((exp(ß2)**Slope) + (Dose**Slope))], 
Where ß0 is an intercept, ß1 is the maximal response attributable to mepolizumab and ß2 is logarithm of the 
ED50; the dose providing half-maximal drug effect. Slope was fixed to unity. All other model components 
were retained from the linear model allowing direct comparison of model goodness of fit. Plausible 
Covariates were tested for incorporation into the final model using standard methods, with model 
comparison using BIC. Final linear and non-linear model predictions were compared graphically before 
adopting the non-linear model. 
Having identified the final dose-response model, including necessary covariates such as the effect of 
baseline eosinophil count, the relationship between mepolizumab dose and eosinophil suppression was 
inverted to provide response for dose. In this way the model can be used to identify what dose might be 
necessary to reduce blood eosinophils to acceptable target levels for diseases such as HES, where only 
limited data is available and confounded by the use of OCS treatment.  
Results 
Blood eosinophil exploration between severe asthma and HES diseases 
The hypothesis evaluated in this analysis is that a higher dose of mepolizumab than the therapeutic dose in 
severe asthma is required to confer therapeutic benefit in subjects with higher baseline blood eosinophil 
count reported at diagnosis of the disease in HES patients. To begin assessment of the effect of baseline 
blood eosinophil count on mepolizumab drug response, a graphical exploration of the data was conducted 
across all studies of moderate/severe asthmatic and HES subjects. 
Baseline blood eosinophil count between moderate/severe asthma and HES 
Despite blood eosinophil count >1.5 GI/L being a hallmark of the HES disease at diagnosis, due to the 
prescription of regular oral corticosteroids (OCS) in HES patients to stabilise the disease, similar baseline

blood eosinophil levels were recorded in the HES study MHE100185 and across the asthma studies (Figure 
1). Of note, studies MHE100185 and SB-240563/006, and to some extent study MEA112997, did not have 
a specified cut-off blood eosinophil inclusion criteria. Also we note, a minimum screening inclusion criteria for 
blood eosinophil count of 500 cells/μL (0.5 GI/L) is to be implemented in the planned HES study 200622. 
The distribution of baseline blood eosinophils in severe asthma and HES patients is presented in Figure 2. 
There is no apparent difference in the distribution of the two populations.

Blood eosinophil count over time in placebo group in moderate/severe asthma and HES 
Exploring the course of blood eosinophil count in the placebo arm of the asthma studies in the absence or 
presence of OCS tapering, and in the HES steroid tapering study, provides insight into the effect of 
withdrawing OCS treatment on blood eosinophil count over time (Figure 3). 
Although in both OCS tapering studies (MEA115575 [SA] and MHE100185 [HES]) an increase in blood 
eosinophil count is observed at the end of the study, the increase is more prominent in the HES study. This 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 41/104 
 
  
  
 
 
confirms that the involvement of eosinophils is more pronounced in HES patients because blood eosinophil 
count at baseline was comparable between the two diseases with the contribution of OCS inlowering blood 
eosinophil count. This OCS contribution will gradually disappear following OCS tapering as recommended in 
the proposed phase 3 HES study 200622. 
Mepolizumab treatment effect on blood eosinophil count in severe asthma and HES diseases 
Mepolizumab treatment effect on absolute blood eosinophil count in moderate/severe asthma and HES 
Comparing mepolizumab treatment effect on absolute blood eosinophil count in severe asthma and HES 
disease at the common dose of 750 mg IV in both diseases (i.e., studies SB-240563/006, MEA112997 and 
MHE100185) shows that the absolute count achieved is lower in moderate/severe asthma compared to HES 
despite an apparent similar baseline (Figure 4). This difference could be attributed to a change in baseline 
blood eosinophil count over time following OCS tapering. The apparent difference observed between the 
asthma studies SB-240563/006 and MEA112997 needs to be put into the context of study duration (12 
weeks versus 52 weeks). Also of note, study MHE100185 was of 36 weeks duration. 
A similar comparison using quartiles of baseline blood eosinophil count also shows that the absolute count 
achieved is lower in subjects with severe asthma compared to those with HES. More importantly, in the HES 
patients (MHE100185), irrespective of the baseline blood eosinophil quartiles the same absolute count was 
observed, whereas in severe asthma patient’s lower values were achieved in the lower quartiles (Figure 5). 
This would suggest the existence of a residual persistent blood eosinophil count that is unaffected by 
mepolizumab therapy.

EMA/CHMP/547698/2018

Difference in treatment response ratio by baseline blood eosinophil quartiles between SA and HES patients 
A comparison of the ratio (post-baseline/baseline) by baseline blood eosinophil quartiles at a dose of 750 mg 
IV clearly shows that the higher the baseline value, the lower the ratio, irrespective of the disease, 
confirming the inter-dependency between the response and blood eosinophil count at baseline. Again a 
lower ratio was achieved in severe asthmatics than in HES patients, aligned with the observation for absolute 
blood eosinophil count (Figure 6). This is particularly evident in the lower quartiles. This might be the result 
of the presence of HES patients with lower level of blood eosinophil at baseline than in severe asthma, in 
particular in MEA112997 where a blood eosinophil count criteria of >=300 cells/μl at baseline or documented 
in the previous 12 months was one of four criteria for airway inflammation eosinophilic in nature that was 
applied. 
Impact of dose on the absolute blood eosinophil count and post-baseline/baseline ratio achieved by baseline 
blood eosinophil quartiles in severe asthma patients 
Increasing the dose of mepolizumab from 75 mg IV to 250-750 mg IV resulted in lower absolute values 
achieved in each quartiles with no difference between the 250 and 750 mg IV dose (Figure 7). This suggests 
that for higher baseline blood eosinophil counts, increasing the dose does not confer any further benefit. The 
difference between the first quartile and the other quartiles at both the 250 and 750 mg IV dose raises the 
question of the origin of this residual blood eosinophil count. The absence of further effect of mepolizumab 
despite dose increase could suggest that these blood eosinophils might be the result of production from 
alternative pathways to IL-5, namely via IL-3 or GM-CSF mechanism for example. Any further increase in 
mepolizumab dose beyond 250 mg IV would therefore be of no additional value. This would also explain the 
difference observed in nadir between severe asthma and HES. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 43/104 
 
  
  
 
Considering the post-baseline/baseline ratio, again the higher the baseline blood eosinophil quartiles the 
lower the ratio achieved with only limited differences between the 250 and 750 mg IV dose for the 2 highest 
quartiles (Figure 8). Again this could suggest maximum effect achieved with mepolizumab with no further 
benefit observed with higher doses. This is consistent with the observation mentioned for the absolute blood 
eosinophil count achieved. 
Blood eosinophil dose-response analysis 
A linear and non-linear dose response analyses were conducted to further explore the impact of disease on 
the dose response for blood eosinophil count following mepolizumab treatment. 
Linear dose-response model 
A linear model was fitted to the complete dataset using proc mixed. Study was treated as a random effect on 
intercept to account for inter-study variability. Treatment (dose), type of study (single dose or repeat dose) 
and exacerbation history were treated as a class effects, and baseline blood eosinophil count, bodyweight 
and protein as continuous variables, were included as covariates of the model. Model goodness of fit was 
assessed using Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) that considers log-likelihood penalised by the number of 
model parameters. Adjusted least squares means absolute eosinophil count and ratio to placebo were 
estimated, complete with 95% confidence limits. 
A non-linear Emax model was also used to describe mepolizumab treatment using proc nlmixed. All other 
covariates, including the random effect for between-study variability were treated as in the linear model. 
Model comparison with the linear model (fitted using both proc mixed and proc nlmixed), along with further 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 44/104 
 
  
  
 
 
non-linear models fitted using proc nlmixed, was guided using BIC assessment. As expected, the procedure 
used did not change the goodness of fit or model parameters for the linear model. 
The linear model was then used to estimate adjusted least squares means for the dose response in patients 
with HES assuming a range of baseline blood eosinophil counts (0.5 - 8 GI/L) for this population with a 
background of OCS therapy. Formally, this is an extrapolation of the model beyond the realms of 
observation, because HES patients in the dataset are present on OCS. The dose response for absolute blood 
eosinophil count as a function of absolute blood eosinophils is shown in Figures 9 and 10 (per baseline blood 
eosinophil plots). Since log(baseline) is a covariate that enters the model as a linear term, increasing 
baseline blood eosinophil count raises the absolute value by a constant factor. The overall shape of the dose 
response curve is, however, unchanged (on a semi-log plot), which means that the post-baseline/baseline 
blood eosinophil ratio is independent of baseline (and hence disease) as shown in Figure 11 (per baseline 
blood eosinophil plots). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 45/104 
 
  
  
 
Increasing baseline blood eosinophil count shifts the dose response curve for absolute blood eosinophil up 
but does not shift the ED50 as a treatment by baseline blood eosinophil term was not supported by the data. 
Hence an increased baseline blood eosinophil does not have any impact on the dose response curve for 
post-baseline/baseline ratio which is at odds with the graphical exploratory analysis. 
Non-linear dose-response model 
A non-linear model adjusted for the same covariates as in the linear model for direct comparison was then 
used to fit the data. The addition of one or two random effects on intercept and maximum effect (Emax) as 
well as an additional term for an effect of baseline blood eosinophil on Emax and ED50 was tested. Model 
comparison using BIC indicates the best model (lowest BIC) is the Emax model with two random effects (on 
intercept and Emax) and baseline blood eosinophil effect on Emax as well as on ED50. Of note, all non-linear 
models (Emax) provided a better fit to the data compared to the linear model. 
The non-linear model, in which mepolizumab treatment is treated as a continuous variable, provides a better 
model fit than the linear model with a drop of 6.8 points. When an additional random effect on Emax is 
included, complete with incorporation of the effect of baseline blood eosinophil count on first Emax, and then 
both Emax and ED50, the BIC is reduced by 31.4 points. The number of parameters in the Emax model is 
less than that of the linear model, which accounts for the first fall in BIC. However, the final model with two 
random effects and baseline blood eosinophil as a covariate for both Emax and ED50 is a better fitting model 
than the linear model. 
As per the linear model, the effect of baseline blood eosinophil count is incorporated into a predicted dose 
response for patients with HES with a range of baseline blood eosinophil counts (0.5-8 GI/L) with a 
background of OCS therapy. Estimated ED50 and Emax as a function of baseline blood eosinophil count are 
shown in Figure 12.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 46/104 
 
  
  
 
The dose response is again presented for absolute blood eosinophil count in Figure 13 (per baseline blood 
eosinophil plots) and Figure 14 (all baseline blood eosinophil together) as well as for the 
post-baseline/baseline blood eosinophil ratio in Figure 15 (per baseline blood eosinophil plots) and Figure 16 
(all baseline blood eosinophil together). Note that because baseline blood eosinophil count is now a covariate 
for ED50, the dose response curves are no longer parallel. For the linear model, this effect is equivalent to 
a treatment by baseline interaction, which, on account of the large number of treatments, was not supported 
for model selection using BIC. The non-linear model, with fewer parameters is able to support such an 
interaction and this is clearly seen in the response. 
Indeed, we note from Figure 12 that location of the dose response (ED50) increases from 19 mg (95% CI 
9-30) for a baseline blood eosinophil count of 0.25 GI/L up to 50 mg (95% CI 10-89) for an extreme baseline 
of 8 GI/L. The value of 19 mg is in reasonable agreement with an early estimate from study MEA114092 
alone. We also note that increasing blood eosinophil count increases maximum inhibition from 87% to 95%, 
in agreement with earlier graphical data exploration, although the effect is not large.

As with the linear model, increased baseline blood eosinophil moved the dose response curve for absolute 
blood eosinophil up but also shifted the dose response curve slightly to the right due to the inclusion of an 
effect of baseline blood eosinophil on the ED50. Increased baseline blood eosinophil also moved the dose 
response curve for post-baseline/baseline ratio down as a result of the inclusion of a baseline blood 
eosinophil effect on Emax and aligned with the observation in the graphical exploratory analysis. There is 
therefore evidence supporting higher doses as beneficial for higher baseline blood eosinophil counts, as 
would be the case in HES patients. In fact, the model suggests that below some threshold doses, reductions 
of blood eosinophils to normal ranges or below (as shown on the plots) might not be possible. 
The model is able to make adjustment for OCS usage and make predictions of response in the absence of 
OCS. Maximum response, as determined by percentage inhibition, is dependent on baseline blood eosinophil 
count. However inhibition as a percentage is not the whole story; For subjects with asthma, a baseline of 
0.25 GI/L and maximum inhibition of 87%, means that mepolizumab treatment would achieve an absolute 
Assessment report

Page 49/104 
 
  
  
 
 
count of 0.0325 GI/L. For subjects with HES and a baseline of 2 GI/L and maximum inhibition of 93%, 
mepolizumab treatment would reduce blood eosinophils to an absolute count of 0.14 GI/L. 
Having estimated the dose response, inversion to obtain response for dose is of interest for the HES 
population. Figure 17 shows the dose required to achieve a target blood eosinophil level as a function of 
baseline blood eosinophil count (i.e., HES disease severity). The model predicts that reduction from a high 
baseline to a low target level may not be possible at any dose. Overlaid are the severe asthma dose of 75mg 
IV/100 mg SC and 225 mg IV/300 mg SC. 
We note from Figure 17 that, for example, for a baseline blood eosinophil count of approximately 2 GI/L a 
dose of 75mg IV (100 mg SC) would be predicted to reduce blood eosinophil down to 0.3 GI/L while a dose 
of 225 mg IV (300 mg SC) would reduce it down to 0.2 GI/L. This implies that a dose of 300 mg SC is 
anticipated to provide HES patients with a baseline blood eosinophil count up to 4 GI/L a reasonable control 
to a target of 0.5 GI/L or below. By contrast a dose of 100 mg SC would only be predicted to reduce blood 
eosinophil to 0.5 GI/L or below in patients with a baseline blood eosinophil count up to 2 GI/L. 
A population PK/PD (blood eosinophils) meta-analysis of data from 13 mepolizumab studies encompassing 
various eosinophilic conditions, conducted post initial submission, showed that observed baseline blood 
eosinophil count is an important determinant of both predicted baseline and mepolizumab inhibitory 
response. Age, race and ethnicity were not covariates of response to blood eosinophil count. Disease was 
however identified as an additional covariate for predicted baseline blood eosinophil count. Population PD 
parameter estimates were consistent with previous estimates (IC50 0.9 μg/mL and maximum effect 83% 
[for a baseline blood eosinophil count of 0.26 GI/L]). 
Model application to other studies 
PK/PD analyses have been conducted on the data from the additional relevant completed studies. Analysis 
of the NP data (MPP111782) using a direct response model led to an estimated maximal effect of 90.1% (for 
a baseline blood eosinophil count of 0.46 GI/L) and an IC50 of 4.4 μg/mL. Since a wealth of blood eosinophil 
data has been accumulated across the mepolizumab clinical program and well characterised within the 
population PK/PD meta-analysis, data from the Phase III pivotal study in EGPA (MEA115921) and from the

paediatric PK/PD study (200363 Part A) in children 6 to 11 years with severe eosinophilic asthma were used 
to test and confirm the ability of the meta-analysis model to predict observations in a de novo population or 
route of administration in a specific age group. These analyses confirmed that the blood eosinophil response 
to mepolizumab in subjects with EGPA was no different to that observed in subjects with other eosinophilic 
conditions and between age groups with the same disease. 
As previously mentioned in the initial application, there was no relationship between mepolizumab 
concentrations and exacerbations in the Phase IIb/III study MEA112997. After combining data from the 
severe eosinophilic asthma studies MEA112997 and MEA115588, there was also no evidence of an exposure 
(average plasma concentration quartile) response for clinically significant exacerbations nor for time to first 
exacerbation. 
In support of a paediatric extrapolation strategy a bootstrap resampling analysis of exacerbation data from 
the Phase III severe asthma Study MEA115588, in which similar-sized adult and adolescent (12 to 17 years 
old) sample sizes were drawn and compared, was conducted. The results showed no difference between 
adult and adolescent (12 to 17 years old) efficacy estimates, with the adolescent rate ratio reduction falling 
well within the expectation of similar-sized adult trials. 
Predictability of blood eosinophil reduction in children (6 to 11 years) from Study 200363 (Part A) 
In order to demonstrate the meta-analysis model’s ability to predict the blood eosinophil count data from 
Study 200363 in children (6 to 11 years) with severe eosinophilic asthma following mepolizumab SC 
administration, the most recent meta-analysis PKPD model [m5.3.5.3 Supplementary outputs from a 
population PK and PKPD meta-analysis] was applied unchanged and without parameter estimation. 
Observations and predictions were then subjected to statistical goodness of fit tests to assess the degree of 
comparability [m5.3.4.2 CSR 200363]. Although not all statistical goodness of fit tests passed (in particular 
the tests sensitive to distribution tails), the PKPD model was able to predict with very good precision the 
concentrations observed in Study 200363 and the conventional visual predictive checks were satisfied 
(Figure 4). Notably, inclusion of imputed data (0.005 in place of 0), digit precision (2 decimal places), and 
spikes in observed blood eosinophil count, most likely influenced the tails of the observed distribution.

In summary, the PD response to mepolizumab in children (6 to 11 years old) with severe eosinophilic asthma 
is consistent with that of adults with the same disease and of adult and paediatric patients with other 
eosinophilic conditions. This finding confirms that mepolizumab response in children (6 to 11 years old) can 
be extrapolated from adults with severe eosinophilic asthma using a model-based approach. 
2.4.6.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In study MEA115921, after mepolizumab SC dose of 300 mg was administered to subjects with EGPA, 
mepolizumab PK data was analysed using the most recent population PK model and was found to be 
consistent with previously analysed other PK populations. No additional covariates beyond body weight, 
creatinine clearance and albumin were identified. In study MPP111782, Patients with nasal polyposis 
received IV 750 mg doses of mepolizumab, where PK was also consistent with previous analyses. These data 
provide an evidence of mepolizumab PK consistency across populations with different pathological 
conditions.  
In study 200363 Part A, Mepolizumab PK was evaluated in children with severe eosinophilic asthma aged 
between 6-11 years after 40 or 100 mg SC doses for <40 kg and ≥40 kg respectively. For the 36 subjects 
enrolled, 26 subjects received the 40 mg SC dose and 10 subjects received the 100 mg SC dose. AUC0-inf 
normalised to the average bodyweight in each of the dose groups were 454 μg.day/mL for the 40 mg SC 
treatment group (27 kg average bodyweight) and 675 μg.day/mL for the 100 mg SC treatment group (50 kg 
average bodyweight). The MAH claims that that the exposure values remain within 2-fold of the historical 
target adult exposure of 343 μg.day/mL. In addition, the MAH suggested that the difference observed in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 52/104 
 
  
  
 
exposure and bodyweight-adjusted apparent clearance could be explained by increased bioavailability in 
children aged 6 to 11 years old (a complete absorption in children versus 76% bioavailability in adults).  
During the initial MA submission, the effect of age on mepolizumab PK in EoE subjects aged 2-17 received IV 
doses was investigated where adult IV POP PK model using allometric scaling was able to predict paediatric 
observations. In a subpopulation of 19 adolescents received IV and SC mepolizumab, age was not identified 
as a covariate after adjusting for bodyweight and exposure was consistent with adults. However, the 
apparent Cl was 35% lower in the adolescent population received SC doses compared to adults. 
Furthermore, when comparing the new PK data from children aged 6 to 11 years old following SC 
administration based on two weight bands (< 40kg and ≥40 kg), it was evident that the PK parameters Cl 
and Vc were significantly lower and derived exposures were higher compared to the meta-analysis data 
which included adult and paediatric data from 13 different studies. The MAH proposes that higher 
bioavailability in children aged 6-11 rather than reduced Cl could provide plausible explanation as children 
tend to have lower body mass index.  
The MAH used the most recent population PK model with a two-compartment PK model and first-order 
absorption and elimination to model mepolizumab SC PK data in paediatric patients aged 6-11 years. With 
fixed distribution and bioavailability parameters, the model appeared to fit the data. However lower Cl 
values were observed and therefore the MAH run an exploratory analysis where all model parameters were 
fixed except for bioavailability, allometric exponents and residual. The model estimate of SC absolute 
bioavailability was 105% (95% CI: 55-155%) and allometric exponents for clearance and volumes were 
0.86 (95% CI: 0.29-1.43) and 0.66 (95% CI: 0.11-1.21), respectively. The model estimated the 
bioavailability were not consistent with previous historical population PK analysis where bioavailability was 
estimated to be in the range of 70-80%. the observed trend for clearance and volumes with bodyweight, 
body mass index, height and age disappeared after correction to body weight. These data suggest that body 
weight is the only significant covariate on mepolizumab PK. 
Adolescents in the PCSA studies 200862 and MEA115588 and children aged 6-11 years in study 200363 
(data up to 12 weeks) treated with mepolizumab had a marked and sustained reduction in blood eosinophil 
levels consistent with that seen in adults.  
The MAH conducted a dose-response analysis for the blood eosinophil data from 16 studies using linear and 
non-linear sigmoid Emax models. Mepolizumab achieved higher reduction of the absolute eosinophil counts 
in moderate/severe asthma compared to HES. The ratio (post-baseline/baseline) of the blood eosinophil 
quartiles at a dose of 750 mg IV clearly was lower in the higher the baseline eosinophil groups indicating the 
dependency of the response on the baseline blood eosinophil count. A limited difference between 250mg and 
750 mg IV dose suggests that a maximum response is achieved with no further benefit for higher doses. 
The linear model showed that the increase in baseline eosinophil raises the absolute eosinophil value after 
treatment by a constant value with no effect on post-baseline/baseline eosinophil ratio. These results 
confirm that mepolizumab maximum effect is dependent on the baseline eosinophil count. The non-linear 
model showed that ED50 (effective dose 50) increases from 19 mg for a baseline blood eosinophil count of 
0.25 GI/L up to 50 mg for an extreme baseline of 8 GI/L. In addition, increasing blood eosinophil count lead 
to a slight increase maximum inhibition from 87% to 95%. Taken together, the increase in blood eosinophil 
leads to upward and slightly to the right shift in the dose response curve. Additionally, an increase in 
baseline blood eosinophil moved the dose response curve for post-baseline/baseline ratio down. This 
indicates that an increase in the dose could be beneficial for patients with higher eosinophil counts. The 
model could be inverted to predict the doses needed to reduce a baseline eosinophil count to specific target 
level. 
No concentration response relationship was observed between mepolizumab concentrations and asthma 
exacerbations. It was not clear whether higher doses can achieve further benefits in reducing eosinophil

count for patients with high baseline eosinophil count as the PK/PD analyses appear to provide contradictory 
conclusions. However, given similar eosinophil reductions are seen in adults and paediatric patients and 
there is no target treatment eosinophil level this issue will not be pursued. 
The MAH used the PK/PD model to predict the blood eosinophil count paediatric data from study 200363. The 
model appeared to accurately predict paediatric observations which indicates the consistency between adult 
and paediatric PD responses. 
2.4.7.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The submitted PK and PK/PD data provide evidence of mepolizumab PK consistency across populations with 
different pathological conditions.  
In the new paediatric study 200363 Part A, in children with severe eosinophilic asthma aged between 6-11 
years after mepolizumab SC 40mg (<40kg) or 100 mg (≥40kg), AUC0-inf normalised to the average 
bodyweight in each of the dose groups were 454 μg.day/mL and 675 μg.day/mL respectively. These 
exposures are not lower and remain within 2-fold of the historical target adult exposure of 343 μg.day/mL. 
The MAH suggested that the difference observed in the exposure and bodyweight-adjusted apparent 
clearance could be explained by increased bioavailability in children aged 6 to 11 years old. 
The MAH provided a discussion for the mechanism by which lower body mass index increases the 
bioavailability from SC administered mepolizumab. The MAH further discussed the PK similarity between 
adult and adolescent populations and provided a table of comparison for the PK parameters of the paediatric 
populations in study 200363 Part A and in the meta-analysis.  The MAH also discussed the body weight 
exponents on CL and Vd in the submitted population PK analysis for study 200363 Part A and indicated that 
the low sample size of the clinical study 200363 Part A and the sparse PK sampling, in addition to the low 
range of the bodyweight precluded an accurate estimation for the bodyweight allometric exponents. The 
MAH justification is acceptable. 
Based on the data provided, no dose adjustment is considered necessary in adolescent patients aged 12 
years and above.  
Further to a request from the CHMP, the MAH has explored alternative mepolizumab dosing regimen in 
paediatric subjects 6-11 years with severe eosinophilic asthma. The two explored dosing scenarios were; i) 
flat dosing of mepolizumab SC 40 mg every 4 weeks; and ii) a dosing regimen of 40 mg for subjects weighing 
<50 kg or 100 mg for subjects weighing ≥50 kg administered SC every 4 weeks. Based on the submitted 
simulations, the flat dosing regimen of 40 mg provided comparable exposure to adult target and the 
exposure in this age group is predicted to remain within 38% of adults at 100 mg SC. The 40 mg SC dose 
regimen also showed lowest RMSE using appropriate allometric scaling powers. Therefore, the MAH now 
recommends a flat dose of 40 mg SC every 4 weeks in children 6-11 years to ensure exposure is kept as 
close as possible to historical values. Based on the new simulations submitted by the MAH and the RMSE 
provided in the response, the flat dosing of mepolizumab SC 40 mg every 4 weeks for the paediatric 
population aged 6 to 11 years old is considered acceptable. 
Adolescents in the PCSA studies 200862 and MEA115588 and children aged 6-11 years in study 200363 
(data up to 12 weeks) treated with mepolizumab had a marked and sustained reduction in blood eosinophil 
levels consistent with that seen in adults. The PK/PD model used appeared to accurately predict paediatric 
observations which indicates the consistency between adult and paediatric PD responses. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Adult/Adolescent efficacy data are provided from the following clinical studies: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 54/104 
 
  
  
•  MEA112997 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, parallel-group, 52-week 
dose-ranging Phase IIb/III study that evaluated the effect of 3 IV doses of mepolizumab (75, 250 
and 750 mg), administered every 4 weeks, on the frequency of asthma exacerbations in subjects 
with severe asthma, a history of ≥2 exacerbations in the previous 12 months and evidence to 
support eosinophilic airways disease. (Included in initial MAA submission). 
•  MEA115588 was a double-blind, double-dummy, multi-centre, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
32-week Phase III study in subjects with severe asthma, a history of ≥2 exacerbations in the 
previous 12 months and elevated blood eosinophils levels (≥150 cells/μL blood eosinophils at 
baseline or eosinophil count of ≥300 cells/µL in the past 12 months prior to study initiation). This 
study evaluated dosages of 100 mg SC and the corresponding IV dose of 75 mg, administered every 
4 weeks. (Included in initial MAA submission). 
•  MEA115575 was a 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, parallel group Phase III 
study that evaluated the effects of mepolizumab 100 mg SC add-on therapy, administered every 4 
weeks, compared with placebo on reducing the use of maintenance OCS in systemic 
corticosteroid-dependent subjects with severe asthma and elevated blood eosinophils. OCS 
reduction followed a pre-specified algorithm. (Included in initial MAA submission). 
•  Study 200862 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multi-centre, 24-week Phase 
IIIb study. The study primarily evaluated the effect of mepolizumab 100 mg SC on health-related 
quality of life (HR-QoL) but incorporated a number of other efficacy endpoints, including clinically 
significant exacerbations. (Completed since the Phase III programme. Results of the 9 adolescent 
subjects included in this study were reviewed in procedure EMA/H/C/003860/P46/005). 
Paediatric efficacy data are provided from the following clinical studies: 
•  Study 200363 is an ongoing 2-part Phase II study; Part A (completed) evaluated the PK and PD of 
mepolizumab 40 mg (for subjects with bodyweight <40 kg) and 100 mg (for subjects with 
bodyweight ≥40 kg) administered SC every 4 weeks for 12 weeks in children from 6 to 11 years of 
age with severe eosinophilic asthma. Secondary endpoints with the objective to characterise asthma 
control were also included. 
2.5.1.  Appropriateness of efficacy endpoints for extrapolation of mepolizumab 
adult efficacy data 
The clinical data from the adult severe eosinophilic asthma programme are considered relevant for both 
adults and paediatrics since consistent eligibility criteria were applied irrespective of age (requirement for 
previous exacerbation history and ICS treatment corresponding to GINA Step 4/5). 
The primary endpoint in the adult severe asthma programme was the frequency of clinically significant 
asthma exacerbations. In paediatrics, reduction of asthma exacerbations is also a key clinical goal.  
The adult/adolescent programme also included pre- and post-FEV1, ACQ-5, daily peak flow, daily rescue 
medication use, nocturnal awakenings, and oral corticosteroid use as clinical endpoints. Similar to adults, 
exacerbations, FEV1 and ACQ-5 are important and used to assess the level of control of a paediatric asthma 
patient and were evaluated in the paediatric PKPD Study 200363. 
It is agreed that the clinical efficacy endpoint data from the adult severe eosinophilic asthma programme are 
considered relevant for both adults and paediatrics.

2.5.2.  Mepolizumab efficacy in adult subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma 
The data provided in the initial new marketing authorisation application demonstrated the efficacy and 
supported the use of mepolizumab 100 mg SC every 4 weeks as an add-on therapy for the treatment of 
severe refractory eosinophilic asthma in adult patients. 
In particular, the rate of clinically significant exacerbations was reduced by approximately 50% and the rate 
of exacerbations requiring hospitalisations and/or ED visits by 32% to 61%. The efficacy of mepolizumab in 
exacerbation reduction was sustained with no evidence of loss of effect over 32 and 52 weeks of treatment 
with 100 mg SC and 75 mg IV, respectively. Mepolizumab produced consistent reductions in blood eosinophil 
levels detected at Week 4, which were sustained for the duration of treatment. 
2.5.3.  Efficacy extrapolation to adolescents with severe eosinophilic asthma 
Extrapolation of adult efficacy to adolescent (12 to 17 years) patients was investigated using the primary 
efficacy endpoint of rate of clinically significant exacerbations in adults (≥18 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 
years) from either Study MEA115588 alone or from both Studies MEA115588 and 200862 combined. A total 
of 34 adolescent subjects were randomised across both studies. One and 2 adolescent subjects were also 
recruited in Phase III studies MEA112997 and MEA115575, respectively, but these studies were not included 
in the analysis of exacerbation rate since no adolescents were randomised to placebo. 
•  Subject disposition 
Table 6: Subject disposition (PCSA, safety population, adolescents) 
•  Demographics 
The majority of adolescents in the PCSA studies were White (78%) and female (57%), with a mean age of 
14.7 years. The majority of subjects in the PCSA studies in the adult registration programme were also White 
(85%) and female (59%), and the mean age of subjects was 49.4 years. 
•  Baseline Characteristics  
A summary of baseline characteristics in adults/adolescents and children is provided (see section on efficacy 
extrapolation to children below). 
The MAH only provided a summary and discussion of baseline characteristics comparing the data in 
adolescents/adults in studies MEA112997, MEA115588, 200862 and MEA115575 with the data in 6-11 year 
olds in study 200363. The MAH was therefore requested to provide a tabular comparison and brief discussion 
of the baseline characteristics between the adolescent and adult patients in studies MEA112997, 
MEA115588, 200862 and MEA115575 with a focus on studies MEA115588 and 200862. (see below table)

•  Subgroup analysis of efficacy in adults and adolescents 
Subgroup analysis of the rate of clinically significant exacerbations was performed using a negative binomial 
model. The mepolizumab 100 mg SC and 75 mg IV dose groups studied were combined for these analyses 
as the 2 doses provided similar exposure and pharmacological response in Study MEA115588. The model 
included a covariate for age as a categorical covariate (12 to 17 years old and ≥18 years old), the interaction 
of this covariate with treatment group and additional adjustment for baseline covariates.

In the combined analysis of Studies MEA115588 and 200862, a 40% reduction in clinically significant 
exacerbations was observed in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) (rate ratio 0.60; 95% CI: 0.17, 2.10) 
compared with a reduction of 54% in adults (≥18 years old) (rate ratio 0.46; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.56).  Although 
the overall enrolment of adolescents was low, this subgroup showed a similar reduction in the rate of 
exacerbations per year to the much larger adult group. 
This is a very small number of adolescents and consequently the confidence intervals are very wide. 
However, the point estimates favour active treatment in both clinical trials. This replication provides 
reassurance that the treatment effect in adolescents is likely to be real and not a chance finding; though it 
is not possible to obtain a precise estimate of the treatment effect with so few patients. 
•  Extrapolation of adult efficacy to adolescents: supportive analyses 
Bootstrap resampling analysis of exacerbations 
The number of adolescent subjects recruited into Studies MEA115588 and 200862 represents 4.3% of 
subjects in Study MEA115588 and 3.0% of subjects in the 2 studies combined. As a result of this reduced 
sample size the ability to detect statistically significant differences for adolescents alone is limited and 
reflected by the wider confidence limits for the adolescent rate ratio. 
In order to better understand the adolescent (12 to 17 years old) rate ratio of clinically significant 
exacerbations and place it in context with the more accurately estimated adult value, a bootstrap resampling 
approach was also implemented. This analysis was performed on data from Study MEA115588, which had 
the highest number of adolescents enrolled. In this approach, similar-sized adult and adolescent sample

sizes were drawn from the Phase III Study MEA115588 and compared. Samples were stratified by covariates 
of interest: None, previous exacerbation history, region, oral corticosteroids, bodyweight (H/M/L), and 
previous history AND bodyweight (H/L). The results showed no difference between adult and adolescent 
efficacy estimates, with the adolescent rate ratio reduction falling within the expectation of similar-sized 
adult trials.

Bayesian robust mixture prior analysis of exacerbations 
The results of the subgroup analyses of exacerbations presented within Figure 5 were utilised within a 
Bayesian robust mixture prior analysis. The robust mixture prior was defined as a 2 component weighted 
mixture of an informative adult prior and a weak noninformative prior (assuming no knowledge of treatment 
effect), with weights ‘w’ and (1-w), respectively. The observed efficacy response for the adult subjects (≥18 
years old) from Studies MEA115588 and 200862 combined was used as the informative component of the 
prior distribution for the efficacy response in adolescents. 
A Bayesian analysis of the adolescent data allows a range of prior beliefs regarding the acceptability of 
extrapolation of adult efficacy data to adolescents. The choice of prior beliefs could be based on the degree 
of confidence in the relevance of the adult data when estimating the effect in adolescents, with increasing 
prior weights, ‘w’ , providing greater confidence in the extrapolation validity.

Adolescents Against Prior Weight Given to the Adult Prior Component

A commonly used standard for evidence of efficacy is a 2-sided p-value <0.05 or 1-sided p-value <0.025. In 
a Bayesian framework, this corresponds to a posterior probability of >97.5% that the effect of treatment is 
greater than zero. 
With prior odds of at least 2 to 1 in favour of the adolescent treatment effect being similar to the adult 
treatment effect (equivalent to a prior weight of 0.65 or higher on the adult data), then evidence of a 
reduction in exacerbations in adolescents can be concluded. Because of the similarity of disease and the 
similarity of drug disposition and effect between paediatrics and adults, a prior weight of at least 0.65 is 
justified. 
A sensitivity analysis was also conducted, where adolescents and adults rate ratio of exacerbations were 
estimated using separate negative binomial regression models for each age group, which resulted in similar 
conclusions. 
This Bayesian analysis is considered of little value. As expected it demonstrates that the higher our belief in 
the acceptability of extrapolation of adult efficacy data to adolescents, the higher the probability of 
concluding that the treatment is efficacious in adolescents. 
2.5.4.  Efficacy extrapolation to children (6-11 years) with severe eosinophilic 
asthma 
The paediatric PK/PD study 200363 (Part A) was conducted in children (6 to 11 years old) with severe 
eosinophilic asthma accordance with the agreed PIP. 
No placebo arm was included and therefore similar extrapolation analyses as performed on the adolescent 
data collected in the programme are not possible. Furthermore, the duration of treatment period (12 weeks) 
in the Part A of the study is considered too short to provide sufficient information on the clinical endpoint of 
exacerbation.

•  Subject disposition 
Table 9: Subject Disposition (Safety Population, Study 200363 Part A) 
•  Demographics 
Of the 36 subjects in study 200363, the majority (56%) were White, and the average derived age was 8.6 
years; in the mepolizumab 40 mg SC group (weight <40 kg), there was a higher proportion of male subjects 
whereas the male/female ratio was balanced in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group (weight ≥40 kg). The 
mean body mass index was 16.11 kg/m2 in the mepolizumab 40 mg SC group (weight <40 kg), 23.05 kg/m2 
in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group (weight ≥40 kg) and 18.04 kg/m2 overall. 
•  Baseline characteristics 
Comparable markers of disease at baseline were observed in the adult and adolescent studies to those seen 
in children 6 to 11 years enrolled in study 200363. All populations had a similar number of exacerbations in 
the previous 12 months. Treatment with ICS, LABAs, and regular OCS use was also similar across studies 
and was representative of uncontrolled patients receiving GINA Step 4 and 5 treatment. Differences exist 
however in that children, based on blood eosinophil and IgE levels, appear more atopic than adults and 
adolescents. Spirometry for children, even those with severe asthma, is often within predicted normal 
ranges and the children enrolled in the PKPD study 200363 were no exception with a percent predicted FEV1 
near normal. Baseline ACQ-5 scores were similar across paediatric and adult/adolescent studies indicating 
similar levels of asthma symptomatology.

Programme

Predictably, baseline IgE was higher in the paediatic PKPD Study 200363 than in the adult and adolescent 
clinical trials, MEA112997 and MEA115588. However, IgE is not a covariant affecting the efficacy response 
in patients receiving mepolizumab. In sub-group analysis of Studies MEA112997 and MEA115588, there was 
no evidence of differential effect on exacerbations for mepolizumab according to baseline IgE. 
Generally, with the exception of the anticipated differences in children (a more atopic picture reflected by 
higher eosinophil and IgE levels, and higher % predicted normal FEV1), comparable markers of disease at 
baseline were observed in the overall patient population of study 200363 compared with the data from the 
adult/adolescent trials. However, the MAH has not provided the baseline characteristics separately in study 
200363 by the 2 dose/weight groups. On review of the baseline data for asthma control these consistently 
show the Mepolizumab SC 40mg (<40kg) group had less well controlled asthma than the 100mg (≥40kg 
group). The baseline ACQ 5 mean score in the 40mg group is 2.05 compared with 1.42 in the 100mg group; 
baseline ACQ 7 mean score is 1.99 and 1.39 respectively; and baseline C-CAT mean score 15.6 and 20.4. 
The MAH was therefore requested to provide an updated summary of the baseline disease characteristics 
with the data from study 200363 separated by dose/weight group and the apparent differences in asthma 
control/severity between the mepolizumab SC 40mg (<40kg) and 100mg (≥40kg) group discussed.

It is acknowledged that the number of subjects in the study was small, with lower numbers in the 100mg 
treatment group.  
The number of exacerbations in the 12 months prior to screening and OCS use were similar between the 2 
treatment groups and both groups had baseline geometric mean eosinophil levels >300 cells/uL. However, 
based on the data provided, it is not agreed that overall the asthma control scores were similar between the 
2 treatment groups. The mean ACQ scores in both groups were above the 1.25 threshold indicating poor 
asthma control but the mean scores in the 40mg group are >0.5 points higher in the 40mg group. 
Furthermore, only the baseline C-ACT scores in the 40mg group are below the threshold indicating not well 
controlled asthma. 
In study 200363, in the mepolizumab 40mg (<40kg) group an overall improvement in asthma control was 
observed over the treatment period. However, for the mepolizumab 100mg (≥40kg) there were no clear 
changes from baseline by the week 12 exit visit despite adequate mepolizumab exposure and a similar 
percentage decrease in blood eosinophils to those seen in adults. 
It is agreed that the inclusion criteria for study 200363 were acceptable. When looking at the baseline 
characteristics between the two treatment groups, as noted in the discussion on Q28 above, the number of

exacerbations in the 12 months prior to screening and OCS use were similar between the 2 treatment groups 
and both groups had baseline geometric mean eosinophil levels >300 cells/uL. However, based on the data 
provided, it is not agreed that overall the asthma control scores were similar between the 2 treatment 
groups. The mean ACQ scores in both groups were above the 1.25 threshold indicating poor asthma control 
but the mean scores in the 40mg group are >0.5 points higher in the 40mg group. Furthermore, only the 
baseline C-ACT scores in the 40mg group are below the threshold indicating not well controlled asthma. 
It is acknowledged that the number of subjects in this study was small with only 10 subjects in the 100mg 
treatment group, it was of short duration and open-label in nature. The main objectives of the study were to 
evaluate PK/PD and safety and tolerability. However, the apparent better asthma control in the 100mg 
treatment group compared with the 40mg group may also have impacted the limited efficacy data collected. 
It is of note that the proposed licensed indication is ‘as an add-on treatment for severe refractory 
eosinophilic asthma in adults, adolescents and children aged 6 years and older’. 
•  Results from study 200363 
Asthma control questionnaire 
Overall, an improvement in asthma control was observed for the ACQ-7 and ACQ-5 responses. Data from the 
mepolizumab 40 mg SC group (weight <40 kg) showed a sustained trend towards ≥0.5 point reduction in 
ACQ-7 and ACQ-5 score over the treatment period (Week 0 to Week 12). This trend was less evident in the 
mepolizumab 100 mg SC group (weight ≥40 kg), where wide 95% CIs reflect the small number of subjects 
in this group.

Overall, an increase in total scores, suggesting an improvement in asthma control, was observed with a peak

Asthma exacerbations 
Table 13: Summary of on-treatment exacerbations (week 0 to week 12) 
Overall, 8 (22%) subjects reported an exacerbation post-treatment between Week 12 and Week 20. When 
combining on-treatment and post-treatment asthma exacerbations, 10 (38%), 3 (30%) and 13 (36%) 
subjects in the mepolizumab 40 mg SC (weight <40 kg), mepolizumab 100 mg SC (weight ≥40 kg) groups 
and overall, respectively, reported at least 1 asthma exacerbation. 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of the probability of an exacerbation increased from 30.8% by Week 12 to 38.7% by 
Week 20 for the mepolizumab 40 mg SC group (weight <40 kg), from 20.0% by Week 12 to 30.0% by Week 
20 for the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group (weight ≥40 kg) and from 27.8% by Week 12 to 36.3% by Week 
20 overall.

Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second 
Mean baseline pre-bronchodilator FEV1 values were 1407, 1940 and 1555 mL in the mepolizumab 40 mg SC 
(weight <40 kg) and mepolizumab 100 mg SC (weight ≥40 kg) groups and overall, respectively. There was 
no clear change from baseline at any of the time points monitored throughout the treatment period. 
•  Comparison of exacerbation incidence between children and adults/adolescents 
There was a low incidence (28% of subjects) of asthma exacerbations during Study 200363, including 
exacerbations leading to hospital visits; however, the exposure period is shorter than the exacerbation 
studies in adults/adolescents. When matching the exposure period between Study 200363 and the 
adult/adolescent studies, the incidence of asthma exacerbations in Study 200363 is consistent with that 
observed in adults/adolescents. 
Table 14: Summary of Exacerbation Incidence by Week 12 within the Mepolizumab 
Development Programme 
When analysing adults and adolescents separately from Studies MEA115588 and 200862, lower incidences 
of exacerbation were seen by Week 12 when receiving mepolizumab compared with placebo. 
Table 15: Summary of Exacerbation Incidence by Week 12 in Adolescents and Adults 
Twelve weeks is considered too short to provide sufficient information on any effect of mepolizumab on 
exacerbation rates. This was an exploratory endpoint in study 200363 and the MAH has compared the 
results with the results at 12 weeks in the longer adult/adolescent studies. 
With the exception of study 200862 where the baseline exacerbation rate in the previous 12 months was 
lower than for the other studies, the overall exacerbation rate at 12 weeks in study 200363 was lower than 
that in the placebo groups of the remaining adult/adolescent studies and at the higher end of the 
exacerbation rates seen in the mepolizumab treated groups. This remains the case when only considering 
Assessment report

the mepolizumab 40mg (<40kg) group. Updated data were provided during the assessment. 
Exacerbation data from Part B of study 200363 will not be available until the CSR is finalized. GSK will submit 
the CSR to the MAH once the report is available (expected end of July 2018). 
It is noted that art B of study 200363 was designed to collect long-term safety data for mepolizumab in 
children 6 to 11 years of age. While data was collected for exacerbations and asthma questionnaires, similar 
to Part A, there was no comparator arm. Asthma exacerbations and exacerbations requiring hospitalisation 
during Part B will be provided as part of the CSR for comparison against the 12 months prior to screening for 
Part A. Exacerbations requiring emergency visit were not collected in the 12 months prior to screening for 
Part A and are therefore not able to be compared. The exacerbation data from Part A will not be combined 
with the exacerbation data from Part B because of the 8 week follow up period where subjects were not 
treated with mepolizumab (weeks 12 to 20). 
The effect on asthma exacerbations was only an exploratory endpoint in this open-label, uncontrolled study 
and part B was designed to collect long-term safety data. Whilst not optimal, submission of the CSR for Part 
B of study 200363 after this variation procedure can be accepted.  
•  Comparison of improvement in asthma control between children and adults/adolescents 
Mepolizumab led to an overall improvement in asthma control during the treatment period of Study 200363 
(Part A), as indicated by the results of the ACQ-7, ACQ-5 and Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) 
questionnaires. At Week 12, a ≥0.5 point reduction (minimally clinically important change) in ACQ-7 and 
ACQ-5 was observed in 48% and 55% of subjects, respectively. These results are consistent with those 
observed previously in adults/adolescents following 32 weeks of treatment in Study MEA115588 (54% with 
≥0.5 point reduction in ACQ-5 score when IV and SC doses were combined, compared to 46% following 
placebo treatment) and following 24 weeks of treatment in Study 200862 (59% with ≥0.5 point reduction 
with 100 mg SC, compared to 42% following placebo treatment). When analysing adults and adolescents 
separately similar improvements were observed with mepolizumab relative to placebo by Week 12. For the 
C-ACT questionnaire in Study 200363, an increase in total score, also suggesting an improvement in asthma 
control, was also observed with a peak response at Visit 4 (Week 8) for the 2 treatment groups (40 mg SC 
[weight <40 kg] and 100 mg SC [weight ≥40kg]) combined. 
Table 16: Summary of 0.5 Point or More Reduction in ACQ-5 Score from Baseline in 
Adolescents and Adults 
Similar improvements in ACQ-5 asthma control score were seen overall in children aged 6-11 compared with 
the adult data in studies MEA115588 and 200862. However, when separated by treatment group, as noted 
above, the results are better in the mepolizumab 40mg (<40kg) treatment group whose baseline asthma 
control scores indicated less well controlled asthma, compared with the 100mg (≥40kg) treatment group 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 70/104 
 
  
  
 
 
whose results are closer to those in the placebo groups: 61% patients in the 40mg group had a reduction in 
ACQ 5 score of ≥ 0.5 at 12 weeks vs 40% in the 100mg group. 
Summary of main study(ies) 
This table is not added due to the nature of the data submitted in this application  
2.5.5.  Discussion on the clinical efficacy 
Data provided in the initial new marketing authorisation application, including from 3 pivotal placebo 
controlled trials (MEA112997, MEA115588, MEA115575), demonstrated the efficacy and supported the use 
of mepolizumab 100 mg SC every 4 weeks as an add-on therapy for the treatment of severe refractory 
eosinophilic asthma in adult patients. 
Dose recommendation in the paediatric population (6 to 17 years old) with severe refractory eosinophilic 
asthma 
The proposed dosage scheme in paediatric patients is supported by the results from studies including 
adolescents (Phase III clinical program) and children 6 to 11 years old (PKPD study 200363 Part A) and by 
simulations. The dosage scheme is supported by an extrapolation strategy that relies on targeting a similar 
exposure to that observed in the adult population at the approved dose of 100 mg SC mepolizumab 
administered every 4 weeks, leading to a similar blood eosinophil reduction. 
Adolescents 
A limited number of adolescent subjects (28) were also enrolled in these studies, mainly in study 
MEA115588 (25) and an additional phase III study 200862 was completed post-marketing that included 9 
adolescents. The MAH has investigated extrapolation of the adult efficacy data to adolescent patients using 
the primary efficacy endpoint of rate of clinically significant exacerbations in adults from either Study 
MEA115588 alone or from both Studies MEA115588 and 200862 combined. A total of 34 adolescent subjects 
were randomised across both studies. One and 2 adolescent subjects were also recruited in Phase III studies 
MEA112997 and MEA115575, respectively, but these studies were not included in the analysis of 
exacerbation rate since no adolescents were randomised to placebo. 
The MAH has provided comparative baseline characteristic data for the adolescent and adult subjects as 
requested. It is acknowledged that the number of adolescents included in studies MEA112997, MEA115588, 
200862 and MEA115575 is small, with the majority included in studies MEA115588 (25 subjects) and 
200862 (9 subjects). When focusing on these 2 studies, both adolescents and adults had a similar number 
of exacerbations in the previous 12 months.  
Mean blood eosinophil levels were lower in the adolescents in study MEA115588 compared with the adult 
subjects, the reverse was true in study 200862. ICS and LABA use was similar, although regular OCS use 
appeared lower in the adolescent patients. 
In line with what would be expected, the adolescent subjects had higher percent predicted normal FEV1 
values and higher IgE levels compared with adult subjects. ACQ-5 values were slightly lower in the 
adolescent subjects. 
A subgroup analysis of the rate of clinically significant exacerbations was performed using a negative 
binomial model. In the combined analysis of studies MEA115588 and 200862 a 40% reduction in clinically 
significant exacerbations was observed in adolescents compared with a 54% reduction in adults. There is a 
very small number of adolescents and consequently the confidence intervals are very wide. However, the 
point estimates favour active treatment in both clinical trials. This replication provides reassurance that the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 71/104 
 
  
  
treatment effect in adolescents is likely to be real and not a chance finding; though it is not possible to obtain 
a precise estimate of the treatment effect with so few patients. 
In addition to the subgroup analysis, 2 supportive analyses were undertaken. A bootstrap resampling 
analysis of exacerbations was performed on data from study MEA115588 which had the highest number of 
adolescents enrolled. A sample of 25 adults matching the covariates of the adolescent patients was taken, 
looking at the treatment effect in the sample, and repeating this 3000 times to get an average treatment 
effect. When this was done, matching for exacerbation history this resulted  in the average treatment effect 
in adults being greater than the observed effect in adolescents. However, the adolescent effect was still well 
within the distribution of the adult effects from the different samples. 
 A Bayesian robust mixture prior analysis of exacerbations was conducted using data from study MEA115588 
and 200862. This Bayesian analysis is considered of little value. As expected it demonstrates that the higher 
our belief in the acceptability of extrapolation of adult efficacy data to adolescents, the higher the probability 
of concluding that the treatment is efficacious in adolescents. 
Dose recommendation in Adolescents (12 to 17 years) 
No dose adjustment is necessary in this age group. 
There is considerable bodyweight overlap between adolescents (12 to 17 years old) and adults, fast evolving 
stature at puberty (median bodyweight changes from 40 to 45 and 50 kg at 12, 13 and 14 years old, 
respectively). This, combined with, the favourable safety profile in adults at doses up to 750 mg IV every 4 
weeks and paediatric subjects (2 to 17 years old) at IV doses up to 10 mg/kg on 3 occasions, means that 
dose adjustment is unnecessary. 
A GSK analysis reported that the proportion of adolescents (12 to 17 years old) with severe asthma, ≥2 
exacerbations in the prior year and blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/µL that weighed <40 kg was 6.7%. The 
recommended mepolizumab dose is therefore 100 mg SC every 4 weeks in adolescents (12 to 17 years old). 
This is also supported by the adolescent IV and SC data collected in the severe asthma Phase III programme, 
where concentrations in adolescents were consistent with adults and the individual-predicted clearance in 
adolescents were within the rest of the study population range, irrespective of administration route. 
Children aged 6-11 years 
In-line with the agreed PIP, the only clinical trial data available in children aged 6-11 years with severe 
eosinophilic asthma comes from the open label paediatric PK/PD study 200363 (Part A). No placebo arm was 
included and therefore similar extrapolation analyses as performed on the adolescent data collected in the 
programme are not possible. In addition, the 12-week duration of treatment period is considered too short 
to provide sufficient information on the clinical endpoint of exacerbation. The primary endpoints of the study 
were PK/PD with safety and asthma control as secondary endpoints and effect on asthma exacerbations and 
FEV1 as exploratory endpoints 
Thirty-six patients were treated in this study of who 26 received mepolizumab 40mg SC (<40kg) and 10 
received 100mg SC (≥40kg). Generally, with the exception of the anticipated differences in children (a more 
atopic picture reflected by higher eosinophil and IgE levels, and higher % predicted normal FEV1), 
comparable markers of disease at baseline were observed in the overall patient population of study 200363 
compared with the data from the adult/adolescent trials.  When looking at the baseline characteristics 
between the two treatment groups, the number of exacerbations in the 12 months prior to screening and 
OCS use were similar between the 2 treatment groups and both groups had baseline geometric mean 
eosinophil levels >300 cells/uL. However, based on the data provided, it is not agreed that overall the 
asthma control scores were similar between the 2 treatment groups. The mean ACQ scores in both groups 
were above the 1.25 threshold indicating poor asthma control but the mean scores in the 40mg group are 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 72/104 
 
  
  
>0.5 points higher in the 40mg group. Furthermore, only the baseline C-ACT scores in the 40mg group are 
below the threshold indicating not well controlled asthma. 
In the mepolizumab 40mg (<40kg) group an overall improvement in asthma control was observed for the 
ACQ-7 and ACQ-5 responses. The data showed a sustained trend towards a ≥ 0.5 point reduction in ACQ-7 
and ACQ-5 score over the treatment period. Similarly, for C-ACT, an overall increase in total scores, 
suggesting an improvement in asthma control, was observed with a peak response at Visit 4 (Week 8). 
However, for the mepolizumab 100mg (≥40kg) group this trend was less evident with no clear changes from 
the baseline by the week 12 exit visit despite adequate mepolizumab exposure and a similar percentage 
decrease in blood eosinophils to those seen in adults. It is acknowledged that the number of subjects in this 
study was small with only 10 subjects in the 100mg treatment group, it was of short duration and open-label 
in nature. The main objectives of the study were to evaluate PK/PD and safety and tolerability. However, the 
apparent better asthma control in the 100mg treatment group compared with the 40mg group may also 
have impacted the limited efficacy data collected. It is of note that the proposed licensed indication is ‘as an 
add-on treatment for severe refractory eosinophilic asthma in adults, adolescents and children aged 6 years 
and older’. 
Effect of mepolizumab on exacerbation rates was an exploratory endpoint in study 200363 with data only 
available up to 12 weeks. The MAH has compared these results with the results at 12 weeks in the longer 
duration adult/adolescent PCSA studies. With the exception of study 200862 where the baseline 
exacerbation rate in the previous 12 months was lower than for the other studies, the overall exacerbation 
rate at 12 weeks in study 200363 was lower than that in the placebo groups of the remaining 
adult/adolescent studies and at the higher end of the exacerbation rates seen in the mepolizumab treated 
groups. This remains the case when only considering the mepolizumab 40mg (<40kg) group. 
Given that spirometry in children, even those with severe asthma is often within predicted normal ranges (as 
was seen in this study), it is not unexpected that there was no clear change from baseline in FEV1 values at 
any of the time points monitored throughout the treatment period. 
The MAH has also compared the improvements in asthma control between children and adults/adolescents. 
Similar improvements in ACQ-5 asthma control score were seen overall in children aged 6-11 compared with 
the adult data in studies MEA115588 and 200862. However, when separated by treatment group, the results 
are better in the mepolizumab 40mg (<40kg) treatment group whose baseline asthma control scores 
indicated less well controlled asthma, compared with the 100mg (≥40kg) treatment group whose results are 
closer to those in the placebo groups. 
Dose recommendation in Children (6 to 11 years)Initially, the MAH proposed a dosing regimen in paediatric 
subjects aged 6-11 years of mepolizumab 40mg SC every 4 weeks for patients with body weight <40kg and 
mepolizumab 100mg SC every 4 weeks for patients with body weight ≥40kg. However, following a request 
in the LoQ, using modelling and simulation the MAH has explored alternative mepolizumab dosing regimens 
in paediatric subjects 6-11 years with severe eosinophilic asthma. The two explored dosing scenarios were; 
i) flat dosing of mepolizumab SC 40 mg every 4 weeks; and ii) a dosing regimen of 40 mg for subjects 
weighing <50 kg or 100 mg for subjects weighing ≥50 kg administered SC every 4 weeks. Based on the 
submitted simulations, the flat dosing regimen of 40 mg provided comparable exposure to adult target and 
the exposure in this age group is predicted to remain within 38% of adults at 100 mg SC. The 40 mg SC dose 
regimen also showed lowest root mean square error using appropriate allometric scaling powers. Based on 
the new simulations submitted by the MAH, the flat dosing of mepolizumab SC 40 mg every 4 weeks for the 
paediatric population aged 6 to 11 years old is considered acceptable. 
2.5.6.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The incidence of severe eosinophilic asthma in the paediatric population is very low and this was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 73/104 
 
  
  
acknowledged by the PDCO.  
Efficacy data is only available from a limited number of adolescent patients enrolled in the pivotal PCSA 
studies. In a subgroup analysis of the 2 main trials including adolescents, a 40% reduction in clinically 
significant exacerbations was observed in adolescents compared with a 54% reduction in adults. Whilst the 
number of adolescents is small, and the confidence intervals are wide the point estimates favour active 
treatment. Bootstrap resampling of the adult patients was also performed. Matching for exacerbation 
history, the average treatment effect in adults was greater than the observed effect in adolescents. 
However, the adolescent effect was still well within the distribution of the adult effects from the different 
samples. In-line with the agreed PIP, the only clinical trial data available in children aged 6-11 years with 
severe eosinophilic asthma comes from the 12-week uncontrolled open label paediatric PK/PD study 200363 
(Part A). In the mepolizumab 40mg (<40kg) group an overall improvement in asthma control was observed 
over the treatment period. However, for the mepolizumab 100mg (≥40kg) there were no clear changes from 
baseline by the week 12 exit visit despite adequate mepolizumab exposure and a similar percentage 
decrease in blood eosinophils to those seen in adults. It is acknowledged that the number of subjects in this 
study was small with only 10 subjects in the 100mg treatment group, it was of short duration and open-label 
in nature and the confidence intervals were wide. The main objectives of the study were to evaluate PK/PD 
and safety and tolerability. However, the apparent better asthma control in the 100mg treatment group 
compared with the 40mg group may also have impacted the limited efficacy data collected. Generally, the 
overall exacerbation rate at 12 weeks in study 200363 was lower than that in the placebo groups of the PCSA 
adult/adolescent studies at 12 weeks and at the higher end of the exacerbation rates seen in the 
mepolizumab treated groups. 
The proposed dosing regimen in adolescent patients aged ≥12 years of mepolizumab 100mg administered 
subcutaneously every 4 weeks and in paediatric subjects 6-11 years of mepolizumab 40mg SC every 4 
weeks is considered acceptable. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In adults, in the severe eosinophilic asthma clinical studies, the safety profile of mepolizumab plus standard 
of care is similar to placebo plus standard of care. In addition, the safety profile of mepolizumab 100 mg SC 
is similar to the integrated safety profile observed across a 10-fold dose range (75 mg to 750 mg IV) in 
severe eosinophilic asthma clinical studies. 
The primary focus of this section is to provide an overview of the safety of mepolizumab in paediatric 
subjects in the context of the known mepolizumab safety profile in adults. 
The following studies contribute to the data on the safety of mepolizumab in paediatric patients: 
Table 17: Contributing studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 74/104 
 
  
  
(Study MEA115661 was a multi-centre, open-label, long-term safety study (open label extension) of mepolizumab in 
asthmatic subjects who participated in the MEA115588 or MEA115575 studies.) 
Integrated safety data is presented for adolescent subjects from the PCSA studies. Data in children aged 
6-11 years with severe eosinophilic asthma is presented from study 200363. 
The following data is also presented for ‘All studies combined’: Treatment exposure, demographics, deaths 
and serious adverse events. 
2.6.1.  Mepolizumab safety in paediatric subjects with severe eosinophilic 
asthma 
Patient exposure in clinical trials 
All studies combined 
A total of 153 paediatric subjects received at least 1 dose of mepolizumab in the GSK-sponsored studies and 
12 paediatric subjects received placebo. Overall, 70 paediatric subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma 
received at least 1 dose of mepolizumab and 42 of these 70 subjects received mepolizumab 100 mg SC.

Population, Paediatrics) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 75/104 
 
  
  
 
 
Total treatment exposure for the 42 paediatric subjects who received mepolizumab 100 mg SC was 34.72 
subject-years (Table A3). A total of 18 paediatric subjects (43%) were treated with mepolizumab 100 mg SC 
for up to 12 months and 24 paediatric subjects (57%) were treated for between 12 and 24 months. 
PCSA studies with adolescents 
A total of 25 adolescents received at least one dose of mepolizumab in the PCSA studies MEA112997, 
MEA115588, MEA115575 and 200862. Of these, 15 adolescents were treated with 100 mg SC, 9 with 75 mg 
IV (which corresponds to 100 mg SC) and 1 with 250mg IV. Twelve adolescents received placebo. 
Treatment exposure in adolescents of the PCSA Studies was 7.02 subject-years in the placebo group and 
ranged from 0.71 subject-years in the mepolizumab 250 mg IV group to 8.08 subject-years in the 
mepolizumab 100 mg SC group; the majority of adolescent subjects receiving mepolizumab 100mg SC were 
treated for 6 to <9 months (87%). 
Severe asthma studies with children (6-11y) 
A total of 36 children received mepolizumab in study 200363 (Part A). Most subjects (92%) received all 3 
treatments (injection of mepolizumab 40 or 100 mg SC every 4 weeks over 12 weeks) and spent an average 
of 83.5 days on-treatment. Three subjects withdrew from the study following 2 doses of mepolizumab 40 mg 
(weight <40 kg).  
Demographics 
All studies combined 
The majority of paediatric subjects treated with mepolizumab in All Studies Combined were White (76%) 
and male (65%). The mean age of paediatric subjects treated with mepolizumab was 11.6 years.

Adverse events 
Common Adverse Events 
Adolescents 
The incidence of on-treatment adverse events for adolescents in the PCSA Studies was similar in the placebo 
group (n=9, 75%) compared with the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group (n=10, 67%), and the mepolizumab 
75 mg IV group (n=9, 100%). Headache was the most frequently reported AE for adolescents in the PCSA 
Studies. One AE of gastroenteritis rotavirus (placebo group) was considered severe in intensity and was also 
an SAE. All other AEs were mild or moderate in intensity.

Across the treatment groups, AEs in the Infections and infestations SOC occurred most often.  
The incidence of AEs in mepolizumab 100 mg SC group was similar or less than the placebo group for most 
SOCs except General disorders and administration site conditions SOC. This difference was primarily due to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018

a higher incidence of injection site reactions for mepolizumab. The incidence of AEs in the mepolizumab 75 
mg IV group was similar or less than the placebo group for all SOCs. 
The frequency of events per 1000 treatment years that were higher in the mepolizumab groups compared 
with placebo occurred in the Infections and infestations SOC (mepolizumab 75 mg IV), Gastrointestinal 
disorders SOC (mepolizumab 100 mg SC), and General disorders and administration site conditions SOC 
(mepolizumab 100 mg SC).

In adolescent and adult subjects in the Phase III PCSA studies, the incidence of AEs was similar in the 
placebo group (82%) compared with the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group (79%) and the mepolizumab 75 mg 
IV group (83%). The most frequently reported AEs were headache and nasopharyngitis. 
In adolescent and adult subjects in the Phase III PCSA studies, AEs in the Infections and infestations SOC 
occurred most often. 
Children 
The overall incidence of subjects reporting any on-treatment AE was 67%. The majority of all AEs, across 
both groups, were mild or moderate in intensity. 
In the mepolizumab 40 mg SC group, the following AEs were considered severe in intensity: asthma 
(worsening) and dizziness (each in 2 subjects), back pain, cellulitis, chest pain, headache, lower respiratory 
tract infection, nausea and pain (each in 1 subject); each of these AEs, except for 1 incidence of dizziness, 
were also SAEs. 
In the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group, one AE of lower respiratory tract infection was considered severe in 
intensity and serious (1 subject). 
Table 21: On-treatment Adverse Events Occurring in More Than 1 Subject  
The SOCs with the highest frequency of AEs were infections and infestations and respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders.

Drug-related adverse events 
Adolescents 
Drug-related AEs occurred in 1 subject (8%) in the placebo group, 4 subjects (27%) in the mepolizumab 100 
mg SC group, and 1 subject (11%) in the mepolizumab 75 mg IV group. The most frequently reported 
drug-related AE in adolescents was injection site reaction reported by no subjects in the placebo and 
mepolizumab 75 mg IV groups and 3 subjects (20%) in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group. All other 
drug-related AEs were reported by 1 subject each. 
Comparison with combined adolescent/adult data 
In adolescent and adult subjects in the Phase III PCSA Studies, drug-related AEs were reported by 16% of 
subjects receiving placebo, 23% of subjects receiving mepolizumab 100 mg SC, and 18% of subjects 
receiving mepolizumab 75 mg IV. The most frequently reported drug-related AEs were 
infusion-related/injection site reactions and headache. 
Children 
Drug-related AEs were reported by 27% of subjects receiving mepolizumab 40 mg SC and 30% of subjects 
receiving mepolizumab 100 mg SC. The most frequently reported drug-related AEs were injection site 
reaction and headache. 
Post-treatment adverse events 
Adolescents 
Post-treatment AEs were reported by 2 subjects. Escherichia urinary tract infection and Headache were 
reported by 1 subject each. 
Comparison with combined adolescent/adult data 
Post-treatment AEs occurred in 26 subjects (20%) in the mepolizumab 75 mg IV group, 30 subjects (23%) 
in the mepolizumab 250 mg IV group, 32 subjects (25%) in the mepolizumab 750 mg IV group, and 36 
subjects (29%) in the placebo group. The most common post-treatment AE was asthma, occurring in 17% 
of subjects in the placebo group and 12% to 14% of subjects in the mepolizumab group.

Acknowledging the limited number of adolescent patients exposed to mepolizumab in clinical trials, the 
adverse event profile in adolescents appears similar to that seen in adults in the PCSA trials 
Children 
In children with severe asthma enrolled in Study 200363, post-treatment AEs were reported by 14 subjects. 
Asthma and upper respiratory tract infection were the only post-treatment AEs reported by more than 1 
subject (2 subjects each). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No fatal events were reported in adolescents in the PCSA studies or in children with severe asthma enrolled 
in Study 200363. 
In the Phase III adult/adolescent PCSA Studies, 6 deaths were reported in adult subjects. The events leading 
to death included road traffic accident, aspiration, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, severe acute pancreatitis, 
septic shock, asthma, asphyxia due to suicide by hanging, and respiratory arrest. None of the deaths were 
considered related to study medication by the investigator. 
In the integrated safety data across the mepolizumab clinical programme in the paediatric age group, there 
were four deaths in the HES Compassionate Use Study, MHE104317; this included patients with severe 
disease and a longer exposure (mean 35.5 months) compared with other mepolizumab studies. The events 
that were reported as leading to death were bacterial sepsis, klebsiella sepsis, disease progression, 
neoplasm malignant and respiratory failure. 
Serious Adverse Events 
Adolescents 
A total of 5 adolescents in the PCSA Studies reported non-fatal SAEs; 3 subjects (25%) in the placebo group, 
1 subject (7%) in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group, 1 subject in the 250 mg IV group and no subjects in 
the mepolizumab 75 mg IV group. The most frequently reported SAE was asthma, reported by 2 subjects 
(17%) in the placebo group, 1 subject in the mepolizumab 250 mg IV group and no subjects in the 
mepolizumab 100 mg SC and 75 mg IV groups. 
Comparison with combined adolescent/adult data 
Serious adverse events were reported by 63 subjects (15%) in the placebo group, 17 subjects (6%) in the 
mepolizumab 100 mg SC groups, and 34 subjects (10%) in the mepolizumab 75 mg SC group. The most 
frequently reported SAE was asthma. 
Children 
In children with severe asthma enrolled in Study 200363, 18 non-fatal SAEs were reported by 6 subjects 
(17%); the majority of these SAEs (5/6 subjects) were reported by subjects in the mepolizumab 40 mg SC 
group (weight <40 kg). The most frequently reported SAE was asthma (worsening).

All studies combined 
For all studies combined, which includes severe eosinophilic asthma, HES and EoE subjects, a total of 27 
paediatric subjects reported non-fatal SAEs (25% in the placebo group and 17% in all mepolizumab doses). 
The most frequent SAE was asthma, reported by 2 subjects (17%) in the placebo group and 9 subjects (6%) 
in all mepolizumab doses. 
No fatal events were reported in adolescents in the PCAS studies or in children with severe asthma enrolled 
in study 200363.  
In the integrated safety data across the mepolizumab clinical programme in the paediatric age group, there 
were four deaths in the HES Compassionate Use Study, MHE104317; this included patients with severe 
disease and a longer exposure (mean 35.5 months) compared with other mepolizumab studies. None of the 
deaths were considered related to mepolizumab treatment. 
The number of adolescents that received mepolizumab in the PCSA studies reporting SAEs was low and 
similar to the percentage in adult patients. In-keeping with the adult data the incidence of SAEs was higher 
in the placebo group than the mepolizumab treated groups. 
Despite the shorter duration of the study, the percentage (17% [6 children]) of children that reported 
non-fatal SAEs in study 200363 was higher than in the mepolizumab groups of the adult/adolescent PCSA 
studies. However, the percentage is similar to that of non-fatal SAEs in the placebo groups and the only SAEs 
reported more than once were Asthma in 3 subjects and lower respiratory tract infection in 2 subjects. 
Longer-term safety data with 52 weeks of treatment will be available from part B of this study and is to be 
submitted within this procedure. 
Pregnancies 
There was one pregnancy reported in subjects <18 years of age across the mepolizumab clinical 
development programme as of 01 August 2017. A 17-year-old subject from MEA115588 received 8 infusions 
of mepolizumab 75 mg IV prior to the onset of pregnancy. The outcome was a live birth with no apparent 
congenital anomalies. 
Table 24: Reported Pregnancies in the Mepolizumab Clinical Development Programme 
(Completed and Ongoing GSK-Sponsored and Compassionate Use Studies; Status as of 
23 September 2016) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 82/104 
 
  
  
 
 
After the cut-off date of 23 September 2016 up to 1 August 2017, there was one new pregnancy reported. 
It was from study 204471 for a subject who received a 100 mg dose of mepolizumab. In addition, for one 
ongoing pregnancy listed in the table above, the pregnancy outcome was reported. Both pregnancies 
resulted in live births and no birth defects or anomalies were reported. 
In accordance with section 4.6 of the SmPC, as a precautionary measure, it states that it is preferable to 
avoid the use of Nucala during pregnancy. Administration of Nucala to pregnant women should only be 
considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus. 
No changes to section 4.6 of the SmPC are proposed or required on the basis of the data provided. 
Clinical laboratory findings 
Adults and adolescents 
No treatment related effects on clinical laboratory signs, with the exception of the intended therapeutic 
effect on eosinophil levels, were evident in the adult/adolescent PCSA studies. 
Children in study 200363 
Clinical Chemistry  
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in any clinical chemistry parameter for this study. 
One subject in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group had an AE of hyperglycaemia. The onset of the AE of 
hyperglycaemia occurred 19 days after receiving the first dose of mepolizumab and was considered mild and 
non-serious. The elevated blood test was conducted locally as part of a ‘curative holiday’ in a health 
centre in Poland and hence this result is not included within the frozen database. This patient had a blood 
glucose level at screening that was close to the ULN (5.9 mmol/L; normal range [3.3 - 6.1 mmol/L]); this 
was slightly above the ULN at Visit 3 (Week 4; blood glucose = 6.4 mmol/L) and was within normal range 
(but close to the ULN) at Visit 4 (Week 8; blood glucose = 4.9 mmol/L), the exit visit (Week 12 [5.3 mmol/L) 
and at follow-up (Week 20 [6.0 mmol/L]. No action was taken and the subject continued to receive all 
mepolizumab treatments. The event resolved with sequelae after 68 days. 
Liver function tests 
No abnormal liver function test results and no liver stopping criteria were met by any subject in this study 
during the pre-specified visits. 
One subject had an on-treatment AE of ALT increased reported during an unplanned local laboratory visit, 19 
days after the first dose of mepolizumab 100 mg SC, where they reported an ALT value of 60 IU/L; this AE 
had resolved by the time of the next site visit. The elevated blood test was conducted locally as part of a ‘

curative holiday’ in a health centre in Poland and hence this result is not included within the frozen 
database. The AE was considered mild and non-serious. No action was taken and the subject continued to 
receive all mepolizumab treatments. The event resolved with sequelae after 11 days. 
Haematology 
With the exception of an expected decline in eosinophils, which can be attributed to the mechanism of action 
of mepolizumab, there were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in any haematology parameter for 
this study. 
A shift to a neutrophil value below the lower limit of normal was observed at a higher frequency in children 
in study 200363 Part A than in the overall adult/adolescent data. However, the majority of these shifts were 
only slightly below the lower limit of normal and were transient. 
Of the 6 subjects that had a recorded neutrophil level of <1.5 x 109/L at any time point; 2 had low neutrophil 
counts at screening; and the other 4 only had a single low neutrophil count with the remainder of the 
neutrophil counts being in the normal range. 
Four subjects had a neutrophil value below the lower limit of normal at the last visit in Part A. On review of 
the preliminary data for Part B of study 200363, the neutrophils returned to normal and remained normal for 
three subjects; the fourth subject had neutrophil values below the lower limit of normal observed throughout 
the study, including prior to mepolizumab treatment. 
One additional subject had a non-serious adverse event of neutrophil count decreased that was of mild 
intensity. This subject had a neutrophil count below the lower limit of normal range at every Part A study 
visit, including screening and baseline prior to mepolizumab treatment. 
Based on the data provided no changes are required to the SmPC and no further action is required at this 
time. 
Other safety evaluations 
No treatment related effects on ECGs or vital signs, were evident in the adult/adolescent PCSA studies. 
Children in study 200363 
There were no apparent treatment related changes in ECGs or vital signs in study 200363. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No adolescents reported an AE leading to withdrawal in the PCSA studies. 
In the Phase III adult/adolescent PCSA Studies, 35 adult subjects in the PCSA Studies were withdrawn due 
to an AE: 3% in the placebo group and 1% each in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC and 75 mg IV groups. The 
most frequently reported AE leading to withdrawal was asthma. 
In children with severe asthma enrolled in Study 200363, two subjects withdrew from the study. One subject 
was withdrawn due to a drug-related SAE of asthma (worsening); a second subject withdrew consent on Day 
113 (last study day of completing all follow up assessments for this subject), following two administrations 
of mepolizumab 40 mg SC, due to experiencing a combination of AEs throughout the study (cough, 
dizziness, headache, hypersensitivity, lethargy, nausea, oropharyngeal pain, pain, rash, wheezing).

Anaphylaxis 
There were no reports of anaphylaxis in adolescents or children and no reports of anaphylaxis considered 
related to study treatment by the investigator in adolescent and adult subjects in the Phase III PCSA 
Studies. 
Systemic (allergic/hypersensitivity or non-allergic) Reactions 
Allergic/hypersensitivity 
In adolescents, there were no reports of events considered by the investigator to represent systemic 
(allergic/hypersensitivity) reactions. 
In adolescent and adult subjects in the Phase III PCSA Studies, investigator-defined systemic 
(allergic/hypersensitivity) reactions were reported by 2% of subjects in the placebo group and 1% of 
subjects each in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC and 75 mg IV groups. 
In children with severe asthma, 1 event of hypersensitivity following the first SC injection of mepolizumab 40 
mg was reported. The verbatim term for the event was hypersensitivity reaction and it was considered 
non-serious and of mild intensity with associated symptoms of pruritus. The event was considered related to 
study medication by the investigator and resolved with continued dosing. 
Non-allergic 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 86/104 
 
  
  
 
In adolescents, events considered by the investigator to represent systemic (non-allergic) reactions were 
reported by 1 subject (7%) in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group (injection-related reaction). The reported 
symptom of the event was headache, which was considered non-serious and mild in intensity. The event 
resolved while continuing study treatment. 
In adolescent and adult subjects in the Phase III PCSA Studies, investigator-defined non-allergic reactions 
were reported by 2% of subjects in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group and 3% of subjects each in the 
placebo and mepolizumab 75 mg IV groups. 
No children with severe asthma enrolled in Study 200363 had a non-allergic systemic reaction. 
Local Injection Site Reactions 
In adolescents, local injection site reactions were reported by 3 subjects (20%) in the mepolizumab 100 mg 
SC group. The 3 subjects reported 11 events with symptoms of itching (1 event) and pain (10 events) of 
which all were non-serious and 10 were mild in intensity and 1 was moderate in intensity. All events resolved 
while continuing study treatment. 
In adolescent and adult subjects in the Phase III PCSA Studies, local injection site reactions were reported 
for more subjects in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group (21 subjects, 8%) compared with the mepolizumab 
75 mg IV (11 subjects, 3%) and placebo groups (14 subjects, 3%). These events were all non-serious, mild 
to moderate in intensity and the majority resolved within a few days. The common symptoms reported with 
these events included pain, erythema, swelling, itching, and burning sensation. 
In children with severe asthma, 5 subjects (14%) in the mepolizumab 40 mg group reported 7 events of 
local injection site reactions. All events were non-serious and of mild intensity and were associated with 
between 1 and 4 symptoms: erythema and swelling (4 events in 3 subjects each), itching (3 events in 2 
subjects), pain, rash and 1 cm wheal to surrounding area (1 event in 1 subject each). All events resolved 
with continued treatment. 
Infections 
In adolescents, the occurrence of AEs in the Infections and infestations SOC was 7 subjects (58%) in the 
placebo group, 6 subjects (40%) in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group, and 6 subjects (67%) in the 
mepolizumab 75 mg IV group. One adolescent in the placebo group reported a non-fatal SAE of 
gastroenteritis rotavirus. No opportunistic infections were reported by adolescents, and no parasitic 
infections were reported. 
In adolescent and adult subjects in the Phase III PCSA Studies, the occurrence of AEs in the Infections and 
infestations SOC was 58% in the placebo group, 52% in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group, and 61% in the 
mepolizumab 75 mg IV group. Thirty-seven subjects reported non-fatal SAEs in the Infections and 
infestations SOC, with an incidence of 3% each in the placebo and mepolizumab 100 mg SC groups and 2% 
in the mepolizumab 75 mg IV group. Opportunistic infections were infrequent and were reported for 4 
subjects (<1%) in the placebo group, 3 subjects (1%) in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group, and 4 subjects 
(1%) in the mepolizumab 75 mg IV group. The only opportunistic infection that occurred in more than 1 
subject was herpes zoster. 
In children with severe asthma, 14 subjects (54%) in the mepolizumab 40 mg group and 4 subjects (40%) 
in the mepolizumab 100 mg group experienced AEs in the Infections and infestations SOC. Three paediatric 
subjects experienced SAEs in the Infections and infestations SOC. There were no on-treatment opportunistic 
infections reported in children; however, 1 subject reported a post-treatment SAE of campylobacter 
infection that, based on the information presented in the report, could not be ruled out as invasive disease. 
Malignancies 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 87/104 
 
  
  
One adolescent reported an AE in the Neoplasms SOC of skin papilloma in the mepolizumab 75 mg IV group; 
no malignancies were reported by adolescents. 
In the Phase III adult/adolescent PCSA Studies, the occurrence of AEs in the Neoplasms SOC was 2% in the 
placebo group, <1% in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group, and 1% in the mepolizumab 75 mg IV group. 
Malignancies were reported by 3 subjects (<1%) in the placebo group and 1 subject (<1%) in the 
mepolizumab 75 mg IV group. The types of malignancies reported were those that are common in the 
general population and included basal cell carcinoma, basosquamous carcinoma, prostate cancer, and 
squamous cell carcinoma. None of the types of malignancies were reported in more than 1 subject. 
No children with severe asthma enrolled in Study 200363 had a malignancy 
Serious Cardiac, Vascular, Thromboembolic and Ischemic Events 
No serious CVT and ischaemic events were reported by adolescents. 
In adolescent and adult subjects in the original submission, serious CVT events were reported by 3 subjects 
(<1%) in the placebo group, 1 subjects (<1%) in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group, and 4 subjects (1%) 
in the mepolizumab 75 mg IV group. Serious ischaemic events were infrequent and were reported by 2 
subjects (<1%) each in the placebo and mepolizumab 75 mg IV groups and no subjects in the mepolizumab 
100 mg SC group. 
In children with severe asthma, no serious CVT, or ischaemic events were reported. One subject had a 
non-serious post-treatment event of valvulopathy (mild mitral valve incompetence) in the mepolizumab 40 
mg group. The subject was not hospitalised and was treated for the event. The event was considered not 
related to mepolizumab treatment and was ongoing at the time of reporting. 
Immunogenicity 
Mepolizumab has a low immunogenic potential. In the severe eosinophilic asthma registration studies there 
was a low incidence (6% 100 mg SC and 2% all IV doses) and low titre of anti-drug antibodies and 
neutralising antibodies. 
Adolescents 
One adolescent in the placebo group had a positive response for binding anti-drug antibody; the subject 
tested negative for neutralising antibodies and did not report any AEs. 
Children 
No subjects reported positive ADA results at Baseline. Two subjects had transient positive responses for 
binding ADAs with low titres and were negative for binding ADAs in subsequent visits: an unscheduled visit 
8 days following the first administration of mepolizumab in the 40 mg SC group (weight <40 kg) (titre of 4), 
after which the subject continued treatment, and at the first Follow-up visit (Week 16) in the 100 mg SC 
group (weight ≥40 kg) (titre of 16). No subjects tested positive for neutralising antibodies. 
The subject who had a positive ADA result in the 40 mg SC group (weight <40 kg) reported on treatment AEs 
of ankle fracture, back pain, chest pain, constipation, dizziness, headache, injection site reaction, nausea, 
pain, pyrexia, rash and urinary retention. This subject also reported a post-treatment event of 
campylobacter infection. The subject who had a positive ADA result in the 100 mg SC group (weight ≥40 kg) 
did not have any AEs. 
Conclusion 
Mepolizumab has a low immunogenic potential. The number of subjects that had a positive response for 
binding ADA was very low in both children and adolescents. Based on the data available there are no

apparent differences in the immunogenicity of mepolizumab in paediatric and adult patients with severe 
eosinophilic asthma. 
Safety from ongoing GSK-sponsored and ongoing and completed 
Investigator-sponsored studies 
No SAEs occurred in paediatric subjects participating in Studies 204471 or 201956 as of 30 June 2017. In the 
HES compassionate use programme, SAEs in paediatric subjects were reported only from MHE112562 
between 02 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. In the double-blind placebo controlled study in HES (200622), no 
paediatric subjects have been enrolled as of 30 June 2017. 
Overall, there were 26 SAEs in 13 paediatric subjects from the ongoing mepolizumab studies. The majority 
of SAEs were reported in the Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorder SOC (19 SAEs), due to asthma 
being the most commonly reported SAE (15 SAEs). Other SAEs reported included 2 events of influenza, and 
1 event each of pneumonia, nasal polyps, respiratory distress, wheezing, epistaxis, anxiety, depression, 
anaphylactic shock, and food allergy. 
The subject who experienced anaphylactic shock had a peanut allergy, and developed the reaction following 
exposure to nuts. The subject was treated and recovered. Treatment with mepolizumab continued. The 
investigator did not consider the event related to mepolizumab. 
All subjects were reported as recovered or recovering as of 30 June 2017. There were no fatal SAEs reported. 
Post marketing experience 
As of the most recent PBRER/EU-PSUR with a cut-off date of 23 March 2017, the cumulative exposure to 
Nucala in the post-marketing setting is estimated to be 5080.62 patient-years. 
Overall, AEs received from post-marketing sources are generally consistent with what has been observed in 
clinical trials with severe eosinophilic asthma. The most frequently reported AE from post-marketing sources 
is headache. The MedDRA system organ classes with the most AEs reported post-marketing are the General 
Disorders and Administrations Site Conditions SOC, and the Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders 
SOC (in the integrated safety analysis of placebo-controlled severe asthma trials, SOCs with the highest 
incidence of AEs reported were Infections and Infestations, and Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal 
Disorders). During the post-marketing period, spontaneous reports of anaphylaxis associated with 
mepolizumab use have been received. Following a review of these reports, the mepolizumab reference 
safety information was updated to include ‘anaphylaxis’ in the existing Warning regarding hypersensitivity 
reactions and in the Adverse Reactions section. 
No new safety signals have been identified in paediatric patients from post-marketing sources. Based on the 
post-marketing experience to date. 
2.6.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In adults, in the severe eosinophilic asthma clinical studies the safety profile of mepolizumab plus standard 
of care was similar to placebo plus standard of care. In addition, the safety profile of mepolizumab 100 mg 
SC was similar to the integrated safety profile observed across a 10-fold dose range (75 mg to 750 mg IV) 
in severe eosinophilic asthma clinical studies. 
In this application, the MAH has reviewed the safety data available in paediatric subjects exposed to 
mepolizumab in the context of the known safety profile in adults. The incidence of severe eosinophilic 
asthma in the paediatric population is very low and this was acknowledged by the PDCO. The paediatric 
severe eosinophilic asthma clinical trial safety data base is currently limited to 70 subjects that have 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 89/104 
 
  
  
received at least one dose of mepolizumab. When including all indications, a total of 153 paediatric subjects 
have received at least one dose of mepolizumab in clinical trials, including doses up to 750mg IV. 
Safety data in children with severe eosinophilic asthma aged 6-11 years is currently limited to a total of 36 
children who received up to 12 weeks of treatment (3 doses of 40mg or 100mg mepolizumab SC dependant 
on weight) from Part A of study 200363. Part B of this study (long-term safety/pharmacodynamic phase) 
consists of a 52-week long-term treatment period and 8-week follow-up period. The final CSR for Part B is 
expected by the end of July 2018 and the MAH has confirmed that this will be submitted to the EMA as soon 
as this is available, via the article 46 procedure. Part B of study 200363 has been added as an additional 
category 3 pharmacovigilance activity in the RMP for the missing information ‘Limited data in patients < 18 
years of age’ 
Acknowledging the limited number of adolescents and children with severe eosinophilic asthma exposed to 
mepolizumab in clinical trials, and the open label nature and limited duration of the clinical trial in children, 
the adverse event profile in paediatric patients appears similar to that seen in adults in the PCSA studies. 
The most frequently reported AE in adolescents was headache and the most frequently reported AEs in 
children were headache and injection site reaction. The most frequently reported AEs in the overall 
adolescent and adult population in the PCSA studies were headache and nasopharyngitis. 
No fatal events were reported in adolescents in the PCAS studies or in children with severe eosinophilic 
asthma enrolled in study 200363.  In the integrated paediatric safety data across the mepolizumab clinical 
programme, there were four deaths in the HES compassionate use programme; this included patients with 
severe disease and a longer exposure. None of the deaths were considered related to mepolizumab 
treatment. 
The number of adolescents in the PCSA studies reporting SAEs was low and similar to the percentage in adult 
patients. In-keeping with the adult data the incidence of SAEs was higher in the placebo group than the 
mepolizumab treated groups. Despite the shorter duration of the study, the percentage of children that 
reported non-fatal SAEs in study 200363 was higher than in the mepolizumab groups of the adult/adolescent 
PCSA studies. However, the percentage is similar to that of non-fatal SAEs in the placebo groups in the PCSA 
studies and the only SAEs reported more than once were Asthma in 3 subjects and lower respiratory tract 
infection in 2 subjects.  For all studies combined, including severe eosinophilic asthma, a total of 27 
paediatric subjects reported non-fatal SAEs. These were more commonly reported in the placebo group 
(25%) compared with the mepolizumab all doses group (17%). 
There were no apparent clinically relevant treatment related changes in clinical chemistry, liver function 
tests, Haematology, ECGs or vital signs in paediatric subjects. In-keeping with the adult data, the number of 
paediatric subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma that discontinued due to adverse events was very low. 
No adolescents reported an AE leading to withdrawal in the PCSA studies and 2 children withdrew from study 
200363. 
All infections were the adverse events of special interest reported most frequently in adults, adolescents and 
children. In the placebo controlled studies the incidence of infections was similar between the placebo and 
mepolizumab treated groups. 
There were no reports of anaphylaxis in adolescents or children. In adolescents, there were no reports 
considered by the investigator to represent systemic (allergic/hypersensitivity) reactions. In children 1 
event of hypersensitivity following the first SC injection of 40mg mepolizumab was reported. This was 
considered of mild intensity and resolved with continued dosing. Whilst there was a slightly higher rate of 
local injection site reactions in children and adolescents with severe asthma compared with adults in the 
PCSA studies the nature and severity of the events was similar.

Mepolizumab has a low immunogenic potential. The number of paediatric subjects that had a positive 
response for binding ADA was very low in both children and adolescents. Based on the data available there 
are no apparent differences in the immunogenicity of mepolizumab in paediatric and adult patients with 
severe eosinophilic asthma. 
A brief summary of post-marketing safety data for mepolizumab has also been provided. Mepolizumab is 
licensed in 8 countries outside of the EU for use in adolescent patients aged 12 years and over with severe 
eosinophilic asthma. No new safety signals have been identified in paediatric patients from post-marketing 
sources. 
2.6.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The incidence of severe eosinophilic asthma in the paediatric population is very low and this was 
acknowledged by the PDCO. The paediatric severe eosinophilic asthma clinical trial safety data base is 
currently limited to 70 subjects and when including all indications, a total of 153 paediatric subjects have 
received at least one dose of mepolizumab in clinical trials, including doses up to 750mg IV. 
Longer-term safety data (52 weeks of treatment ) in children aged 6-11 years with severe eosinophilic 
asthma will be provided by part B of study 200363. The final CSR for Part B is expected by the end of July 
2018 and the MAH has stated that this will be submitted to the EMA as soon as this is available, via the article 
46 procedure. Part B of study 200363 has been added as an additional category 3 pharmacovigilance activity 
in the RMP for the missing information ‘Limited data in patients < 18 years of age’ 
Acknowledging the limited number of paediatric patients with severe eosinophilic asthma exposed to 
mepolizumab in clinical trials, and the open label nature and limited duration of the clinical trial in children 
aged 6-11 years, with the exception of a slightly higher rate of local injection site reactions and dependant 
on the results of a comparison of the haematology data in paediatric and adult patients, the adverse event 
profile in paediatric patients appears generally similar to that seen in adults in the PCSA studies. 
2.6.4.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Conclusions on extrapolation of adult data to the paediatric population 
1. Confirm that mepolizumab is efficacious with a favourable benefit-risk profile in adult subjects with severe 
eosinophilic asthma (Studies MEA112997, MEA115588 and MEA115575). These data together with data 
from Study 200862 form the basis of extrapolation to paediatric subjects. 
Mepolizumab was approved in the EU in December 2015 as an add-on treatment for severe refractory 
eosinophilic asthma in adult patients. The data provided in the initial new marketing authorisation 
application, including from the 3 pivotal placebo controlled severe asthma studies (MEA112997, 
MEA115588, MEA115575) demonstrated the efficacy and positive benefit-risk profile for the use of 
mepolizumab in the treatment of adult patients with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma. 
For the clinical development programme in paediatric patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, due to the 
low incidence of the disease in the paediatric population and unmet medical need, a partial extrapolation 
approach was agreed with the Paediatric Committee, in which limited data was to be collected in the target 
population, with extrapolation of efficacy and safety data from the Phase III studies included in the 
mepolizumab severe asthma development programme. The basis of the extrapolation approach is the 
overlap in the clinical presentation of both adult and paediatric severe eosinophilic asthma, consistency in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 91/104 
 
  
  
therapeutic approach, consistency of mepolizumab mechanism of action, and relevance of the clinical 
endpoints for both efficacy and safety. 
2. Confirm that mepolizumab PK in adults is predictive of PK in paediatrics following both IV and SC 
administration (predictability of available paediatric PK data in severe asthma [6 to 17 years] and EoE). 
The submitted PK and PK/PD data provide evidence of mepolizumab PK consistency across populations with 
different pathological conditions. 
Based on the data provided, no dose adjustment is considered necessary in adolescent patients aged 12 
years and above.  
In children with severe eosinophilic asthma aged between 6-11 years after mepolizumab SC 40mg (<40kg) 
or 100 mg (≥40kg), AUC0-inf normalised to the average bodyweight in each of the dose groups were 454 
μg.day/mL and 675 μg.day/mL respectively. These exposures are not lower and remain within 2-fold of the 
historical target adult exposure of 343 μg.day/mL. 
Using modelling and simulation, the MAH explored 2 mepolizumab dosing regimens in paediatric subjects 
6-11 years with severe eosinophilic asthma; i) flat dosing of mepolizumab SC 40 mg every 4 weeks; and ii) 
a dosing regimen of 40 mg for subjects weighing <50 kg or 100 mg for subjects weighing ≥50 kg 
administered SC every 4 weeks. Based on the submitted simulations, the flat dosing regimen of 40 mg 
provided comparable exposure to adult target and the exposure in this age group is predicted to remain 
within 38% of adults at 100 mg SC. The 40 mg SC dose regimen also showed lowest route mean square error 
using appropriate allometric scaling powers. Based on the simulations submitted, the flat dosing of 
mepolizumab SC 40 mg every 4 weeks for the paediatric population aged 6 to 11 years old is considered 
acceptable. 
3. Confirm that mepolizumab blood eosinophil count reduction in adults is predictive of the blood eosinophil 
count reduction in paediatrics following both IV and SC administration (predictability of available paediatric 
blood eosinophil count data in severe asthma [6 to 17 years] and EoE). 
Adolescents in the PCSA studies 200862 and MEA115588 and children aged 6-11 years in study 200363 
(data up to 12 weeks) treated with mepolizumab had a marked and sustained reduction in blood eosinophil 
levels consistent with that seen in adults. 
The MAH used a PK/PD model to predict the blood eosinophil count paediatric data from study 200363. The 
model appeared to accurately predict paediatric observations which indicates the consistency between adult 
and paediatric PD responses. 
4. Provide supportive evidence that mepolizumab efficacy in adults with severe asthma can be extrapolated 
to the paediatric population (adolescents [12 to 17 years]) and that establishing this evidence in adolescents 
is sufficient to extend this approach to the 6 to 11 years age group. 
Efficacy data is only available from a limited number of adolescent patients enrolled in the pivotal PCSA 
studies. In a subgroup analysis of the 2 main trials including adolescents, a 40% reduction in clinically 
significant exacerbations was observed in adolescents compared with a 54% reduction in adults. Whilst the 
number of adolescents is small, and the confidence intervals are wide the point estimates favour active 
treatment. A bootstrap resampling of the adult patients was also undertaken. Matching for exacerbation 
history resulted in the average treatment effect in adults being greater than the observed effect in 
adolescents. However, the adolescent effect was still well within the distribution of the adult effects from the 
different samples. In-line with the agreed PIP and partial extrapolation approach, the only clinical trial data 
available in children aged 6-11 years with severe eosinophilic asthma comes from the 12-week uncontrolled 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 92/104 
 
  
  
 
 
open label paediatric PK/PD study 200363 (Part A). In the mepolizumab 40mg (<40kg) group an overall 
improvement in asthma control was observed over the treatment period. However, for the mepolizumab 
100mg (≥40kg) who appeared to have less severe asthma at the start of the study based on baseline 
asthma control scores (ACQ and C-ACT), there were no clear changes from baseline by the week 12 exit visit 
despite adequate mepolizumab exposure and a similar percentage decrease in blood eosinophils to those 
seen in adults.  
It is acknowledged that the number of subjects in this study was small with only 10 subjects in the 100mg 
treatment group, it was of short duration and open-label in nature, the confidence intervals were wide and 
the main objectives of the study were to evaluate PK/PD and safety and tolerability. However, the apparent 
better asthma control in the 100mg treatment group at baseline compared with the 40mg group may also 
have impacted the limited efficacy data collected. 
Generally, the overall exacerbation rate at 12 weeks in study 200363 was lower than that in the placebo 
groups of the PCSA adult/adolescent studies at 12 weeks and at the higher end of the exacerbation rates 
seen in the mepolizumab treated groups. 
5. Evaluate the safety profile in the paediatric population (6 to 17 years) with severe eosinophilic asthma and 
compare with that of the overall Phase III severe asthma clinical development programme. 
Acknowledging the limited number of paediatric patients with severe eosinophilic asthma exposed to 
mepolizumab in clinical trials, and the open label nature and limited duration of the clinical trial in children 
aged 6-11 years, with the exception of a slightly higher rate of local injection site reactions, the adverse 
event profile in paediatric patients appears generally similar to that seen in adults in the PCSA studies. 
However, longer-term safety data in children aged 6-11 years with severe eosinophilic asthma will be 
provided by part B of study 200363 (52 weeks of treatment) which will be provided after approval in the post 
marketing setting.  
2.8.  Risk management plan 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 3.1 is acceptable. In addition, minor revisions 
were recommended to be taken into account with the next RMP update. The MAH is requested to re-evaluate 
the list of safety specifications and update all relevant sections of the RMP in line with GVP revision 2 at the 
next opportunity. 
The PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report is attached. 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of Annex 
I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be submitted 
to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

2.9.  Update of the Product information 
As a result of this group of variations, sections of the SmPC and Sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and Information for 
Healthcare Professionals in the Package Leaflet are updated accordingly. 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections  4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been 
updated.  
In addition, changes related to section 4.4 of the SmPC are introduced stating that the name and batch 
number of the administered product should be clearly recorded in the patient file as Nucala is a biological 
medicine. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: Results of the user 
testing on the current Nucala package leaflet at the time of the original MAA met the criteria for readability 
as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human 
use. The MAH has stated that, in line with the Guideline on the Readability of the Label and Package Leaflet 
of Medicinal Products for Human Use, (12 January 2009), the leaflet has been designed and written to 
maximise the number of people who can use the information, including older children and adolescents, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 96/104 
 
  
  
 
 
elderly, those with poor literacy skills and those with some degree of sight loss. 
•  Nucala is administered by a healthcare professional. It cannot be self-administered or administered 
at home by a parent. Based on the current guidance, the leaflet changes to extend the population to 
6 years, does not pose an additional risk to paediatric patients due to the controlled method for the 
product administration. No additional safety changes have been added to the current leaflet as part 
of this line extension. 
• 
There are minimal changes to the patient leaflet, the design and layout remains the same with only 
amendments to the indication and dosage section and the method of administration remains the 
same. 
2.10.  Significance of paediatric studies 
The CHMP is of the opinion that study MEE103219 (Double blind, randomised, dose ranging, parallel group 
trial to evaluate PK/PD, safety and tolerability of mepolizumab in children from 2 to less than 18 years of age 
with eosinophilic esophagitis), which is contained in the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0239/2017, 
which is completed, and has been completed after 26 January 2007, is considered as significant. 
Study MEE103219 is a pharmaco-kinetic/pharmaco-dynamic clinical studies that was likely to provide 
meaningful data that would preclude the need for a clinical efficacy study and therefore spare the numbers 
of children who may need to be enrolled in a larger trial.  Including this study made it possible to use a partial 
extrapolation approach. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Asthma is the most common chronic disease among paediatric patients. Deaths due to asthma in the 
paediatric population are rare, but measurable (range 0.0 to 0.7/100,000), and prevalence of disease is 
correlated with hospital admissions and mortality. Although the proportion of severe asthmatics among 
paediatric asthma patients is less than adult asthma patients, the severity of disease is greater among 
children and adolescents as evidenced by the frequency of ED visits and hospitalisations. In addition, asthma 
is the leading cause of childhood morbidity from chronic disease as measured by school absences, ED visits 
and hospitalisations. A subset of paediatric patients with severe asthma are managed with high-dose inhaled 
corticosteroids, yet frequently require the addition of chronic oral corticosteroids; the use of such 
medications is accompanied by significant adverse events. 
Severe asthma is heterogeneous, with recognized phenotypes such as atopic, obese and eosinophilic. The 
predominant phenotypes among paediatric severe asthma patients are related to atopy, with a small subset 
with increased peripheral blood eosinophilia. Overall, eosinophilic asthma in children and adolescents is 
rare; ≤1% of paediatric patients were classified as having severe uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma in a 
GSK-led database study of UK primary care. Nevertheless, among those children and adolescents, there is 
a risk for near-fatal or fatal events. While the representation of severe eosinophilic asthma is small in the 
paediatric population, the burden can be greater compared with adults. Therefore, this group is at high risk 
of serious untoward outcomes, and new treatment modalities are needed to improve asthma control and 
quality of life. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 97/104 
 
  
  
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The treatment of asthma in children over 5 years follows that of adolescents and adults, i.e., a step-up 
approach determined by the patient’s level of control. In paediatric patients with severe asthma when 
treatment at GINA step 4 has been unsuccessful, and in particular in those patients with an eosinophilic 
phenotype with repeat exacerbations, treatment options are currently very limited. Recommended 
treatment options on top of medium- (or high-dose) ICS plus a long-acting beta agonist include adding 
tiotropium in patients ≥12 years old, or an anti-IgE treatment, e.g., omalizumab (Xolair) in patients with a 
positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen. For patients aged ≥12 years with severe 
eosinophilic asthma uncontrolled at Step 4, anti-interleukin-5 treatment (such as subcutaneous 
mepolizumab) is recommended, though in various parts of the world (including the EU), the licence for 
mepolizumab is restricted to patients ≥18 years, and intravenous reslizumab is currently only approved in 
the EU in patients ≥18 years. For patients <12 years, the only add-on therapy currently available is 
omalizumab which is restricted to patients with severe allergic asthma. GINA also states that some patients 
at Step 5 may benefit from low dose OCS but cautions that long term systemic side effects occur. Despite the 
use of long-term controller medications including OCS, severe asthma patients still report high rates of 
healthcare utilization with many failing to achieve control. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for 
new medications to provide asthma control in these patients. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Due to the low incidence of severe eosinophilic asthma in the paediatric population (<1%), the conduct of 
traditional clinical efficacy studies in a paediatric population is challenging and was considered not feasible in 
a reasonable timeframe.  In view of this a partial extrapolation approach was agreed with the Paediatric 
Committee (PIP EMEA-000069-PIP02-10), in which limited data is collected in the target population, with 
extrapolation of efficacy and safety data from the Phase III studies included in the mepolizumab severe 
asthma development programme. The evidence to support a partial extrapolation strategy is based on the 
overlap in the clinical presentation of both adult and paediatric severe eosinophilic asthma, consistency in 
therapeutic approach, consistency of mepolizumab mechanism of action, and relevance of the clinical 
endpoints for both efficacy and safety. 
The table below summarises the main paediatric clinical trial data included in the extrapolation strategy. 
Table 27 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/547698/2018 
Page 98/104 
 
  
  
 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The submitted PK and PK/PD data provide evidence of mepolizumab PK consistency across populations with 
different pathological conditions. 
Based on the data provided, no dose adjustment is considered necessary in adolescent patients aged 12 
years and above.  
In children with severe eosinophilic asthma aged between 6-11 years after mepolizumab SC 40mg (<40kg) 
or 100 mg (≥40kg), AUC0-inf normalised to the average bodyweight in each of the dose groups were 454 
μg.day/mL and 675 μg.day/mL respectively. These exposures are not lower and remain within 2-fold of the 
historical target adult exposure of 343 μg.day/mL. 
Using modelling and simulation, the MAH explored 2 mepolizumab dosing regimens in paediatric subjects 
6-11 years with severe eosinophilic asthma; i) flat dosing of mepolizumab SC 40 mg every 4 weeks; and ii) 
a dosing regimen of 40 mg for subjects weighing <50 kg or 100 mg for subjects weighing ≥50 kg 
administered SC every 4 weeks. Based on the submitted simulations, the flat dosing regimen of 40 mg 
provided comparable exposure to adult target and the exposure in this age group is predicted to remain 
within 38% of adults at 100 mg SC. The 40 mg SC dose regimen also showed lowest route mean square error 
using appropriate allometric scaling powers. Based on the simulations submitted, the flat dosing of 
mepolizumab SC 40 mg every 4 weeks for the paediatric population aged 6 to 11 years old is considered 
acceptable. 
Adolescents and children treated with mepolizumab had a marked and sustained reduction in blood 
eosinophil levels consistent with that seen in adults. The PK/PD model used appeared to accurately predict 
paediatric observations which indicates the consistency between adult and paediatric PD responses. 
In a sub analysis of the limited clinical efficacy data in adolescents with severe eosinophilic asthma a 40% 
reduction in clinically significant exacerbations was observed in adolescents compared with a 54% reduction 
in adults. Whilst the number of adolescents is small and the confidence intervals are wide the point estimates 
favour active treatment. 
Limited 12-week, open label, uncontrolled clinical efficacy data is available for children aged 6-11 years with 
severe eosinophilic asthma from study 200363. In the mepolizumab 40mg group (26 patients) an overall 
improvement in asthma control was observed over the treatment period. Generally, the overall exacerbation 
rate at 12 weeks in this study was lower than that in the placebo groups of the PCSA adult/adolescent studies 
at 12 weeks and at the higher end of the exacerbation rates seen in the mepolizumab treated groups.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
A difference was observed in the exposure and bodyweight-adjusted apparent clearance between adults and 
children aged 6-11years. The MAH claims this could be explained by increased bioavailability in children 
(complete absorption was seen in children versus 76% bioavailability in adults). The efficacy data from 
clinical trials in the paediatric population is very limited and in-line with the agreed partial extrapolation 
approach, is only supportive.  
Although the limited 12-week, open label, uncontrolled clinical efficacy data in children aged 6-11 years 
appeared to show an overall improvement in asthma control in the mepolizumab 40mg group (26 patients) 
over the treatment period, this was not seen in the 100mg group (10 patients) despite higher mepolizumab 
exposure and a similar percentage decrease in blood eosinophil levels. It is acknowledged that the numbers 
are very small with wide confidence intervals. The baseline asthma control (as measured by ACQ and C-ACT) 
was also better in this treatment group compared with the 40mg group.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In adults, in the severe eosinophilic asthma clinical studies the safety profile of mepolizumab plus standard 
of care was similar to placebo plus standard of care and generally well-tolerated. In addition, the safety 
profile of mepolizumab 100 mg SC was similar to the integrated safety profile observed across a 10-fold dose 
range (75 mg to 750 mg IV) in severe eosinophilic asthma clinical studies. 
Acknowledging the limited number of adolescents and children with severe eosinophilic asthma exposed to 
mepolizumab in clinical trials, and the open label nature and limited duration of the clinical trial in children, 
the adverse event profile in paediatric patients appears generally similar to that seen in adults in the PCSA 
studies. 
The most frequently reported AE in adolescents was headache and the most frequently reported AEs in 
children were headache and injection site reaction.  
No fatal events were reported in paediatric patients in the severe eosinophilic asthma population. The 
number of adolescents in the PCSA studies reporting SAEs was low and similar to the percentage in adult 
patients. The percentage of children that reported non-fatal SAEs in study 200363 was higher than in the 
mepolizumab groups of the adult/adolescent PCSA studies. However, the percentage is similar to that of 
non-fatal SAEs in the placebo groups of these studies and the only SAEs reported more than once were 
Asthma in 3 subjects and lower respiratory tract infection in 2 subjects.   
The number of paediatric subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma that discontinued due to adverse events 
was very low.  
‘All infections’ were the adverse events of special interest reported most frequently in adults, adolescents 
and children. In the placebo controlled studies the incidence of infections was similar between the placebo 
and mepolizumab treated groups. 
There were no reports of anaphylaxis in adolescents or children. Whilst there was a slightly higher rate of 
local injection site reactions in children and adolescents with severe asthma compared with adults in the 
PCSA studies the nature and severity of the events was similar. 
Mepolizumab has a low immunogenic potential. The number of paediatric subjects that had a positive 
response for binding ADA was very low in both children and adolescents. Based on the data available there 
are no apparent differences in the immunogenicity of mepolizumab in paediatric and adult patients with 
severe eosinophilic asthma. 
No new safety signals have been identified in paediatric patients from post-marketing sources. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The incidence of severe eosinophilic asthma in the paediatric population is very low and this was 
acknowledged by the PDCO. The paediatric severe eosinophilic asthma clinical trial safety data base is 
currently limited to 70 subjects and when including all indications, a total of 153 paediatric subjects have 
received at least one dose of mepolizumab in clinical trials, including doses up to 750mg IV. 
Furthermore, the duration of safety data in children 6-11 years is limited to up to 3 doses (12 weeks). 
Longer-term safety data (52 weeks of treatment) in children aged 6-11 years with severe eosinophilic 
asthma will be provided by part B of study 200363. The final CSR for Part B is expected by the end of July 
2018 and the MAH has stated that this will be submitted to the EMA as soon as this is available, via the article 
46 procedure. Part B of study 200363 was added as an additional pharmacovigilance activity in the RMP for 
the missing information ‘Limited data in patients < 18 years of age’

3.6.  Effects Table 
Due to the nature of the data provided for the partial extrapolation approach an effects table has not been 
included. 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In adults, the data provided in the initial new marketing authorisation application demonstrated the efficacy 
and supported the use of mepolizumab 100 mg SC every 4 weeks as an add-on therapy for the treatment of 
severe refractory eosinophilic asthma. In particular, the rate of clinically significant exacerbations was 
reduced by approximately 50% and the rate of exacerbations requiring hospitalisations and/or ED visits by 
32% to 61%. The efficacy of mepolizumab in exacerbation reduction was sustained with no evidence of loss 
of effect over 32 and 52 weeks of treatment with 100 mg SC and 75 mg IV, respectively. Mepolizumab 
produced consistent reductions in blood eosinophil levels detected at Week 4, which were sustained for the 
duration of treatment. Treatment was generally well tolerated. 
Whilst the phenotype of severe asthma with eosinophilic inflammation generally has a late onset and 
consequently is predominant in adults, elevated eosinophils in the lung and blood have been demonstrated 
in adolescents and children with severe asthma, and with few treatment options available there is an unmet 
medical need in the paediatric population.  
However, due to the low incidence of severe eosinophilic asthma in this population (<1%), the conduct of 
traditional clinical efficacy studies is challenging and considered not feasible in a reasonable timeframe.  In 
view of this a partial extrapolation approach was agreed with the Paediatric Committee. The evidence to 
support such a strategy is based on the overlap in the clinical presentation of both adult and paediatric 
severe eosinophilic asthma, consistency in therapeutic approach, consistency of mepolizumab mechanism of 
action, and relevance of the clinical endpoints for both efficacy and safety 
The key steps of the proposed extrapolation strategy are summarised below and need to be considered in 
the context of the favourable and unfavourable effects: 
1. Confirm that mepolizumab is efficacious with a favourable benefit-risk profile in adult subjects with severe 
eosinophilic asthma (Studies MEA112997, MEA115588 and MEA115575). These data together with data 
from Study 200862 form the basis of extrapolation to paediatric subjects. 
2. Confirm that mepolizumab PK in adults is predictive of PK in paediatrics following both IV and SC 
administration (predictability of available paediatric PK data in severe asthma [6 to 17 years] and EoE). 
3. Confirm that mepolizumab blood eosinophil count reduction in adults is predictive of the blood eosinophil 
count reduction in paediatrics following both IV and SC administration (predictability of available paediatric 
blood eosinophil count data in severe asthma [6 to 17 years] and EoE). 
4. Provide supportive evidence that mepolizumab efficacy in adults with severe asthma can be extrapolated 
to the paediatric population (adolescents [12 to 17 years]) and that establishing this evidence in adolescents 
is sufficient to extend this approach to the 6 to 11 years age group. 
5. Evaluate the safety profile in the paediatric population (6 to 17 years) with severe eosinophilic asthma and 
compare with that of the overall Phase III severe asthma clinical development programme. 
The currently licensed dose of mepolizumab in adult patients is 100mg administered SC every 4 weeks. No 
dose adjustment is considered necessary in adolescent subjects aged ≥12 years. In paediatric patients aged 
6-11 years, based on limited clinical trial data and using modelling and simulation a dosing regimen of 40 mg

mepolizumab administered every 4 weeks provided comparable exposure to adult patients, with the 
exposure in this age group is predicted to remain within 38% of adults at 100 mg SC.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit risk balance of mepolizumab as an add-on therapy for the treatment of severe refractory 
eosinophilic asthma in adult patients is positive. Based on the results of a partial extrapolation strategy, 
provided that satisfactory responses are given to the request for supplementary information, the benefit-risk 
balance in paediatric subjects aged 6-17 years could also be considered positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Nucala is positive.

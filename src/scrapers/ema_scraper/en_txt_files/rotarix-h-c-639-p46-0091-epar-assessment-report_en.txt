1.  Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitment undertaken by the MAH: 
Final study report for the study Rota-079 in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 
1901/2006, in which Rotarix and a DTaP-IPV vaccine are coadministered. 
Study Rota-079 is a phase IV, randomised, open-label, controlled study to assess the immunogenicity 
and safety of the diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and inactivated poliovirus (DPT-IPV) vaccine 
(Squarekids, Kitasato Daiichi Sankyo Vaccine Co., Ltd) when co-administered with Rotarix in healthy 
Japanese infants aged 6-12 weeks at the time of the first dose of HRV vaccination. 
Rotarix liquid formulation is licensed in Japan since 1 July 2011.  
No changes to the Product Information (PI) of Rotarix are proposed by the MAH.

091 
Study ROTA-079 (114720) is a Study Rota-079 was conducted upon request of the Pharmaceuticals 
and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of diphtheria, tetanus, 
pertussis (DTP) vaccine, made by a Japanese domestic manufacturer, as routine vaccine when co-
administered with Rotarix.  
The end of study was defined in the protocol as the last testing results released of samples collected at 
Visit 7. Since this occurred on 20 November 2017, the deadline for submission is 20 May 2018.   
The study was initiated on 16-September-2016 and completed on 29-May-2017 and was conducted at 
11 sites in Japan. 
Squarekids is a DTaP-IPV vaccine containing BP>=4Unit; DT>=14IU; TT>=9IU; Inactivated Poliovirus 
type 1=40DU; Inactivated Poliovirus type 2=8DU; Inactivated Poliovirus type 3=32DU; Sodium 
hydrate=210μg; Trisodium phosphate=810μg; Aluminium chloride=900μg 0.5 mL. It is administered 
subcutaneously as a 3-dose primary vaccination schedule. 
Rotarix is administered orally as a 2-dose primary vaccination schedule, either concomitantly or 
staggered.

Methods 
Primary objective 
Immunogenicity 
- 
To demonstrate that the immunogenicity to the antigens contained in DPT-IPV vaccine was not 
impaired by the co-administration with liquid HRV vaccine (Rotarix). 
Criteria for non-inferiority (one month after the third dose of DPT-IPV vaccine at Visit 7): 
- 
Lower limits of the standardised asymptotic 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on the differences 
(Co-administered group minus Staggered group) in the percentages of subjects with 
seroprotective concentrations ≥0.1 IU/mL for anti-diphtheria antibodies and concentrations 
≥0.1 IU/mL for anti-tetanus antibodies were ≥-10% (clinical limit for non-inferiority),  
- 
Lower limits of the 95% CIs on the differences (Co-administered group minus Staggered 
group) in the percentages of subjects with concentrations ≥10 IU/mL for antibodies against the 
pertussis toxoid (PT) and filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) antigens (anti-PT and anti-FHA) 
were ≥-10% (clinical limit for non-inferiority), 
- 
Lower limits of the standardised asymptotic 95% CIs on the differences (Co-administered 
group minus Staggered group) in the percentages of subjects with seroprotective titres (≥8 
ED50) for each of anti-poliovirus serotypes 1, 2 and 3 antibodies were ≥-10% (clinical limit for 
non-inferiority). 
Secondary objectives 
Immunogenicity 
- 
To assess the immunogenicity of the liquid HRV vaccine in terms of serum anti-RV IgA antibody 
seropositivity and geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) in a sub-cohort of subjects, one 
month after the second dose of the liquid HRV vaccine. 
- 
To assess the immunogenicity to all the antigens contained in the DPT-IPV vaccine in terms of 
GMCs/geometric mean antibody titres (GMTs), one month after the third dose of the DPT-IPV 
vaccine. 
Safety/Reactogenicity 
- 
To assess reactogenicity and safety after each dose of liquid HRV vaccine and first dose of DPT-
IPV vaccine in terms of solicited symptoms during the 8-day follow-up period and unsolicited 
symptoms during the 31-day follow-up period. 
- 
To assess safety in terms of serious adverse events (SAEs) from the first dose of study vaccine 
up to study end. 
CHMP comment 
Immunogenicity data for Rotarix were generated in a sub-cohort. 
Safety data was generated for Rotarix in the staggered administration group, and for Rotarix and 
DTP-IPV co-administration in the concomitant group.

Study population 
Healthy Japanese male or female infants, 6-12 weeks of age at the time of first dose. 
CHMP comment 
The study protocol was correct in defining the main contra-indications of Rotarix as exclusion criteria 
(history of intussusception, history of uncorrected congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal 
tract that would have predisposed the infant to intussusception, history of Severe Combined 
Immunodeficiency Disease (SCID), acute disease at time of enrolment meaning a rectal temperature 
of ≥ 38°C.) 
Sample size 
The target enrolment was at least 292 subjects (146 subjects approximately in each group), in order to 
have 262 evaluable subjects (131 in each study group) for the immunogenicity analyses corresponding 
to the primary confirmatory objective. The first 146 subjects enrolled were to be allocated to the HRV 
immunogenicity sub-cohort. 
Study design 
The study design was a Phase IV, open-label, 1:1 randomised, controlled, multicentre, single-country 
study with two parallel groups: 
-  Co-administered group: Subjects were administered the DPT-IPV vaccine according to a 3, 
4, 6-month schedule and the liquid HRV vaccine according to a 2, 3-month schedule. The co-
administration of study vaccines was to be performed only once, when the infant was 
approximately 3 months old. 
-  Staggered group: Subjects were administered the DPT-IPV vaccine according to a 3, 4.5, 6-
month schedule and the liquid HRV vaccine according to a 2, 3.5-month schedule.

Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity with respect to components of the DPT-IPV vaccine one month after administration of 
the third dose of the vaccine (Visit 7): 
- 
- 
anti-diphtheria antibody concentrations ≥0.1 IU/mL,

- 
- 
anti-PT and anti-FHA antibody concentrations ≥10 IU/mL, 
anti-poliovirus serotypes 1, 2 and 3 antibody titres ≥8 ED50. 
Secondary endpoints: 
Immunogenicity 
-  Serum anti-RV IgA antibody concentration and seropositivity in a sub-cohort of subjects, one 
month after the second dose of the liquid HRV vaccine. 
-  Serum GMCs/GMTs for anti-diphtheria, anti-tetanus, anti-poliovirus serotypes 1, 2 and 3, anti-
PT and anti-FHA antibodies, one month after the third dose of the DPT-IPV vaccine. 
Safety/Reactogenicity 
-  Occurrence of solicited general symptoms during the 8-day (Days 0-7) follow-up period after 
each dose of liquid HRV vaccine. 
-  Occurrence of solicited local and general symptoms during the 8-day (Days 0-7) follow-up 
period after the first dose of DPT-IPV vaccine (Note: the general symptoms solicited for the 
DPT-IPV vaccine were different from those solicited for the HRV vaccine). 
-  Occurrence of unsolicited AEs during the 31-day (Days 0-30) follow-up period after each dose 
of the liquid HRV vaccine and the first dose of DPT-IPV vaccine, according to the medical 
dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) classification. 
-  Occurrence of SAEs from the first dose of the study vaccine up to study end (Visit 7). 
Immunological correlates of protection 
-  Antibodies against diphtheria toxoid (anti-diphtheria) and tetanus toxoid (anti-tetanus): a 
threshold of 0.1 IU/mL (ELISA), provided a conservative estimate of the percentage of subjects 
deemed to be protected 
-  Antibodies against poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 were determined by a virus micro-neutralisation 
test adapted from the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for WHO/EPI Collaborative 
Studies on Poliomyelitis [WHO, 1993]. The lowest dilution at which serum samples were tested 
was 1:8, from which a test was considered positive. Titres were expressed in terms of the 
reciprocal of the dilution resulting in 50% inhibition. Antibody titres greater than or equal to 
this value were considered as protective. 
-  No correlate of protection had been defined for the immune response to pertussis antigens. 
Antibodies against the pertussis components PT and FHA were measured by an ELISA 
technique developed in-house. The assay cut-off for anti-PT was 2.693 IU/mL and for anti-FHA 
was 2.046 IU/mL. 
-  No immunological correlate of protection had been demonstrated so far for the antigen used as 
part of the HRV vaccine. However, a publication indicated that post-vaccination anti-RV IgA 
seropositivity (antibody concentration ≥20 U/mL) could serve as a useful correlate of vaccine 
efficacy in clinical trials of Rotarix (Cheuvart, 2014). 
CHMP comment

vaccine were secondary endpoints. Immunogenicity was determined in a subset of the first 146 
subjects enrolled. Safety endpoints are descriptive. 
Results 
Immunogenicity results 
The primary objective was met as the non-inferiority was demonstrated hierarchically. 
The lower limits of the standardised asymptotic 95% CIs on the differences (Co-administered group 
minus Staggered group) were ≥-10% for all antigens (anti-diphtheria, anti-tetanus, anti-FHA, anti-PT, 
anti-poliovirus type 1, 2 and 3). 
•  Anti-diphtheria and anti-tetanus antibodies (ATP cohort for immunogenicity) 
•  Anti-PT and anti-FHA (ATP cohort for immunogenicity) 
•  Anti-poliovirus 1, 2 and 3 (ATP cohort for immunogenicity)

•  Anti-RV IgA (HRV immunogenicity sub-cohort) 
Anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations were ≥13 U/mL (assay cut-off) in at least 95.7% of subjects in the 
two groups. At least 92.5% of subjects were seropositive i.e. with anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations 
≥20 U/mL in the two groups. The GMCs of anti-RV IgA antibodies were similar in the two groups. 
CHMP comment 
No immune interferences with co-administered antigens were observed. 
The seropositivity rate for HRV vaccine is high and comparable to previous clinical trials (see SmPC).

The analyses for safety were performed on the TVC. The primary analysis of solicited symptom was 
performed by the administered dose, regardless of whether a solicited symptom had been documented 
as present/absent. 
•  Occurrence of solicited general symptoms (Days 0-7) 
Some of the solicited general symptoms are different for the HRV and the DPT-IPV vaccines. 
Solicited general symptoms collected for the HRV vaccine are cough, diarrhoea, irritability/fussiness, 
loss of appetite, temperature and vomiting. 
Solicited general symptoms collected for the DPT-IPV vaccine are drowsiness, irritability/fussiness, loss 
of appetite and temperature. 
The analysis of each solicited symptom was limited to the symptoms specific to each vaccine. 
As a consequence, different general symptoms were solicited overall after the co-administration of first 
DPT-IPV vaccine dose with the second HRV vaccine dose (7 symptoms) as compared to when the first 
DPT-IPV vaccine dose (4 symptoms) and the second HRV vaccine dose (6 symptoms) were 
administered alone. This potentially leads to an artefactual increased total incidence of general 
symptoms in the Co-administered group. Therefore, caution must be exercised when assessing the 
rates of solicited symptoms in each of the groups. 
In overall per subject analysis, irritability/fussiness and cough were the most frequently reported 
solicited general symptoms in the two groups. 
− Irritability/fussiness was reported in 63.3% and 54.5% of subjects in the Co-administered and the 
Staggered groups, respectively. 
− Cough was reported in 46.3% of subjects in the Co-administered group and 49.7% of subjects in the 
Staggered group. 
− Cough, diarrhoea, irritability/fussiness and vomiting, were the most frequently reported Grade 3 
solicited general symptom with a maximum incidence of 1.0% of doses and 2.1% of subjects. 
− The incidence of all solicited general symptoms (i.e. cough, diarrhoea, irritability/fussiness, loss of 
appetite, vomiting and fever) did not show any clinically relevant difference between the groups. 
•  Occurrence of solicited local and general symptoms (Days 0-7) 
Redness was the most frequently reported solicited local symptom in the two groups.

− Redness was reported in 57.8% of subjects in the Co-administered group and 58.3% of subjects in 
the Staggered group. 
•  Occurrence of unsolicited AEs during the 31-day (Days 0-30) follow-up period after each dose 
of the liquid HRV vaccine and the first dose of DPT-IPV vaccine 
For the HRV vaccine, at least one unsolicited symptom was reported in 59.9% of subjects in the Co-
administered group and 55.9% of subjects in the Staggered group. 
By preferred term, the most frequently reported unsolicited symptoms were: 
− Nasopharyngitis (Co-administered group: 15.0% of subjects; Staggered group: 21.4% of subjects) 
− Upper respiratory tract inflammation (Co-administered group: 12.2% of subjects; Staggered group: 
13.1% of subjects) 
− The incidence of the unsolicited symptoms was similar in the two groups. 
No records of grade 3 unsolicited symptoms with causal relationship to vaccination, within the 31-day 
(Days 0-30) post-vaccination period after any dose of liquid HRV vaccine. 
•  Occurrence of SAEs from the first dose of the study vaccine up to study end (Month 5). 
All SAEs reported were recovered and resolved and were not causally related to the vaccination. 
No fatal SAEs were reported. 
Kawasaki disease 
Narrative: This 3-month-old male subject was enrolled in an open label study titled A phase IV, 
randomised, open-label, controlled study to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the diphtheria, 
tetanus, pertussis and inactivated poliovirus (DPT-IPV) vaccine Squarekids when co-administered with 
GSK Biologicals' oral live attenuated HRV liquid vaccine Rotarix in healthy Japanese infants aged 6–12

weeks at the time of the first dose of HRV vaccination. The subject received the 2nd dose of Rotarix 
liquid formulation (oral) 1.5 ml on 18th November 2016, for prophylaxis. The subject received the 1st 
dose of Squarekids (subcutaneous) 0.5 ml on 18th November 2016, for prophylaxis.  
On 2nd December 2016, 14 days after receiving Rotarix liquid formulation and Squarekids, the subject 
developed severe - grade 3 kawasaki's disease. Serious criteria included hospitalization and GSK 
medically significant. Squarekids was continued with no change. The outcome of kawasaki's disease 
was recovered/resolved on 12th December 2016. The investigator considered that there was no 
reasonable possibility that the kawasaki's disease may have been caused by Rotarix liquid formulation 
and Squarekids. 
CHMP comment 
No records of grade 3 unsolicited symptoms with causal relationship to vaccination, within the 31-
day (Days 0-30) post-vaccination period after any dose of liquid HRV vaccine. 
All SAEs reported were recovered and resolved and were not causally related to the vaccination. 
No fatal SAEs were reported. 
This is a relatively small study (n = 292)  
Conclusions  
The primary objective was met as non-inferiority of the immune response was demonstrated 
hierarchically. Hence, the immunogenicity to the antigens contained in DPT-IPV vaccine was not 
impaired by the co-administration with Rotarix. 
The anti-RV IgA seropositivity rates and GMCs one month after the second dose of the liquid HRV 
vaccine, and GMCs/GMTs for DPT-IPV antigens, one month after the third dose of the DPT-IPV vaccine 
were similar in the two groups. 
No safety concerns were raised during the study. All SAEs reported were recovered and resolved and 
were not causally related to the vaccination. The safety results of this study indicate that the subjects 
receiving liquid HRV vaccine with DPT-IPV vaccine experienced a clinically acceptable safety profile. 
The MAH concluded that no changes are needed to the PI of Rotarix since the data are aligned with the 
known safety profile, are aligned with the information already present in the PI related to concomitant 
administration of Rotarix with Hib monovalent or combination vaccines, and do not impact the B/R 
profile of the vaccine.

3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion 
The data of study ROTA-079 (114720) confirm the information already presented in the current SmPC, 
i.e. that Rotarix can be given concomitantly with any of the following monovalent or combination 
vaccines, including hexavalent vaccines (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib), diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis 
vaccine (DTPa), inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). Clinical studies demonstrate that the immune 
responses and the safety profiles of the administered vaccines were unaffected. 
No new safety concerns that could be related to Rotarix were observed in this study. 
The B/R profile of Rotarix therefore remains positive. 
The Rapporteur endorses the conclusions of the MAH. 
  PAM fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled) - No further action required

the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
Fycompa in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

epilepsy who received perampanel as adjunctive treatment 
converted to perampanel monotherapy.  The majority of 
these patients had a history of partial onset seizures.  Of 
these, 14 patients (27%) reverted to adjunctive therapy in 
the following months.  Thirty four (34) patients were 
followed up for at least 6 months and, of these, 24 patients 
(71%) remained on perampanel monotherapy for at least 6 
months.  Ten (10) patients were followed up for at least 18 
months and, of these, 3 patients (30%) remained on 
perampanel monotherapy for at least 18 months. 
Withdrawal of a concomitant CYP450 3A enzyme inducer 
can be expected to increase plasma concentrations of 
perampanel and dose reduction may be required.

study with an open-label extension phase (Study 235) was 
performed to assess the short-term effects on cognition of 
Fycompa (target dose range of 8 to 12 mg once daily) as 
adjunctive therapy in 133 (Fycompa n=85, placebo n=48) 
adolescent patients, ages 12 to less than 18 years old, with 
inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures.  Cognitive 
function was assessed by the Cognitive Drug Research 
(CDR) System Global Cognition t-Score, which is a

composite score derived from 5 domains testing Power of 
Attention, Continuity of Attention, Quality of Episodic 
Secondary Memory, Quality of Working Memory, and Speed 
of Memory.  The mean change (SD) from baseline to end of 
double-blind treatment (19 weeks) in CDR System Global 
Cognition t-Score was 1.1 (7.14) in the placebo group and 
(minus) –1.0 (8.86) in the perampanel group, with the 
difference between the treatment groups in LS means 
(95% CI) = (minus) 2.2 (5.2, 0.8). There was no 
statistically significant difference between the treatment 
groups (p = 0.145). CDR System Global Cognition t-Scores 
for placebo and perampanel were 41.2 (10.7) and 40.8 
(13.0), respectively at the baseline. For patients with 
perampanel in the open label extension (n = 112), the 
mean change (SD) from baseline to end of open-label 
treatment (52 weeks) in CDR System Global Cognition t-
Score was (minus) 1.0 (9.91). This was not statistically 
significant (p = 0.96).  After up to 52 weeks of treatment 
with perampanel (n = 114), no effect on bone growth was 
observed.  No effects on weight, height and sexual 
development were seen following up to 104 weeks of 
treatment (n = 114).

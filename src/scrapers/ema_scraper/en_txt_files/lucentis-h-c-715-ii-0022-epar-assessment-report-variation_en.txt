3.  Executive summary 
3.1.  Scope of the variation  
This  is  a  type  II  variation  to  extend  the  indication  of  Lucentis  to  include  the  treatment  of  visual 
impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO). 
3.2.  Problem statement 
Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second leading cause of blindness for patients with retinal vascular 
disease, following diabetic retinopathy. There are two main types of RVO, depending on the site of the 
vein  occlusion:  branch  retinal  vein  occlusion  (BRVO)  and  central  retinal  vein  occlusion  (CRVO).  In 
addition,  when  the  occlusion  is located  in  one  of  the  2  branches  after  the  division  of  the  central  vein 
the occlusion is classified as a hemiretinal vein occlusion (HRVO). This form is often regarded a subset 
of  BRVO  and  grouped  with  BRVO  in  this  report.  All  type  lead  to  permeability  disorders  of  the  retina 
caused by the blockage of the branch retinal vein or central retinal vein. The incidence of RVO in the 
US  in  2007  was  estimated  to  be  180,000,  with  144,000  patients  diagnosed  with  BRVO  and  36,000 
diagnosed with CRVO (Klein, et al 2008). For the EU, estimates are not available, but the incidence of 
RVO is expected to be similar to that in the US.

The most common presenting symptom of RVO is an abrupt, painless decrease of central visual acuity 
(VA) which varies in severity in BRVO and CRVO. Less frequently, patients may present with a history 
of  transient  vision  loss,  lasting  a  few  seconds  to  minutes,  with  complete  recovery  of  vision.  These 
symptoms may recur over several days to weeks, followed by a decrease in vision that can last beyond 
1 year in some patients. 
Untreated eyes with CRVO generally have poor VA (less than 20/40) which declines further over time. 
In a meta-analysis of studies that investigated the natural history of CRVO, the pooled mean decrease 
in VA from baseline to 6 months was approximately 10 letters for eyes with non-ischemic CRVO and 15 
letters for eyes with ischemic CRVO (McIntosh, et al 2010). By contrast, studies on the natural history 
of BRVO indicate that untreated eyes (no laser) show improvement rather than worsening over time. 
However, improvement beyond a VA of 20/40 was uncommon in these studies (Rogers, et al 2010). 
The  current  standard  of  care  for  the  treatment  of  BRVO  is  laser  therapy.  Laser  therapy  can  provide 
long-term vision stabilisation, but in some patients, also vision improvement with time. The recovery is 
lengthy  since  laser  does  not  yield  short-term  vision  benefits  and  a  significant  number  of  patients  still 
lose  vision.  In  addition  to  the  delayed  onset  of  effect,  laser  destroys  retinal  vessels  and  causes  scar 
tissue. However, laser therapy has not been demonstrated to have a beneficial effect on VA in subjects 
with CRVO, even though laser is used to treat secondary neovascular complication of both subsets of 
RVO.  
Presently, the only pharmacologically approved treatment (approved for both types of RVO) in the EU 
is  Ozurdex,  a  sustained-release  intravitreal  implant  containing  dexamethasone.  Lucentis  has  been 
approved to treat RVO in the US. 
The use of ranibizumab in the treatment of patients with RVO is supported by its mechanism of action 
of neutralising the biologic activity of VEGF, which results in the reduction of vascular permeability and 
macular oedema, hallmarks of RVO. This mechanism is supported by evidence from animal studies and 
clinical data from the ranibizumab wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and visual impairment 
in diabetic macular oedema (DME) programs. 
3.3.  About the product 
Ranibizumab  is  a  recombinant  humanised  IgG1  κ  isotype  monoclonal  antibody  fragment  (Fab)  that 
selectively binds and neutralises VEGF-A. 
Lucentis,  0.5  mg  was  approved  for  the  treatment  of  neovascular  (wet)  AMD  in  January  2007  and  for 
the treatment of visual impairment due to DME in January 2011. 
3.4.  Development programme/Compliance with CHMP Guidance/Scientific 
Advice 
Development programme 
For the proposed additional indication, there are no changes related to quality and no new preclinical 
studies have been submitted.  
The  MAH  has  submitted  12-month  data  from  two  phase  III  clinical  studies,  one  in  BRVO  (FVF4165g, 
BRAVO) and one in CRVO (FVF4166g, CRUISE). After the first six months (primary efficacy evaluation) 
with  monthly  administration  of  0.3  mg,  0.5  mg  ranibizumab  or  sham,  dosing  with  ranibizumab  was 
continued  with  treatment  on  as  needed  basis  for  the  following  6  months,  during  which  previously 
sham-treated  subjects  could  also  receive  ranibizumab.  Both  studies  included  pharmacokinetic  blood 
sampling  to  quantify  ranibizumab  concentrations  in  serum  and  screening  for  immunogenicity  in  the 
form of antibodies to ranibizumab. An extension study (HORIZON) with up to 24 months treatment is 
ongoing  (clinical  phase  finalised)  to  further  address  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  treatment.  From  this 
study,  narratives  describing  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  known  to  have  occurred  up  to  30  June 
2010 have been provided.

Compliance with CHMP guidance/Scientific Advice 
One  central  (including  follow  up)  scientific  advice  (April  2007,  EMEA/H/SA/445/2/2007/II;  January 
2008, EMEA/H/SA/445/2/FU/1/2007/II; Feb 2008, EMEA/H/SA/445/2/FU/1/2007/II) has been given. A 
pre-submission meeting was held in February 2010. The following main comments were provided: 
 
Central advice 
One  central  scientific  advice  (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/593356/2008)  was  given  in  2008.  The 
following main comments were provided: 
  A  single  study  of  adequate  duration  in  each  form  of  RVO  may  be  acceptable  to  allow  an 
adequate evaluation of efficacy and safety. 
  The  justification  for  the  choice  of  evaluation  of  the  primary  endpoint  at  6  months  and 
subsequent submission is not acceptable and 12 month masked data vs. standard care was 
recommended for both trials. 
  The  design  of  the  CRVO  study  was  largely  agreed  on,  although  comparative  12-months 
data were desired. 
  In the BRVO study, the scale and impact of laser rescue should be addressed. 
  Assessment of neovascular complications should be included. 
  If  one  trial  was  negative,  a  submission  in  the  other  RVO  type  would  still  be  possible,  but 
will then be regarded as a single pivotal trial.  
 
Pre-submission meeting 
A  pre-submission  meeting  was  held  in  February  2010.  Efficacy  data  from  both  trials  were 
acknowledged  as  promising  and  very  interesting.  CRVO  represents  a  more  “straight  forward” 
case  since,  at  the  time  of  the  meeting,  there  was  currently  no  treatment  available  and  no 
improvement in these patients was expected. Therefore, even 6 months efficacy data would be 
acceptable for a variation submission in CRVO. In BRVO, data need to reflect a convincing and 
consistent magnitude of the effect compared to spontaneous improvement and laser treatment. 
The main deviation from the CHMP scientific advice is that the studies are not sham-controlled after 6 
months, however, the studies are still to be regarded as controlled (randomised population maintained) 
and blinding has been maintained. 
3.5.  General comments on compliance with GMP, GLP, GCP  
The MAH states that the clinical trials performed outside EU meet the ethical requirements of Directive 
2001/20/EC. A need for a GCP-inspection has not been identified. 
3.6.  Type of application and other comments on the submitted dossier 
This is a type II variation, extension of the indication. 
Paediatric studies 
The  Paediatric  Committee  have  granted  a  product-specific  waiver  (EMEA-000527-PIP01-08)  for  all 
subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of visual impairment associated with RVO. 
According  to  the  Guideline  on  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  if  the  European  Medicines  Agency 
has  waived  a  paediatric  development,  this  information  should  be  given  under  the  section  5.1.  The 
CHMP therefore requested that the MAH updated the SPC to include the applicable wording, as follows: 
“The  European  Medicines  Agency  has  waived  the  obligation  to  submit  the  results  of  studies  with 
Lucentis  in  all  subsets  of  the  paediatric  population  in  neovascular  AMD,  visual  impairment  due  to 
diabetic  macular  oedema  and  visual  impairment  due  to  macular  oedema  secondary  to  retinal  vein 
occlusion. (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).”

4.  Scientific Overview and discussion 
4.1.  Quality aspects 
Not Applicable 
4.2.  Non clinical aspects  
No Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) was submitted. This is justified by the MAH with the protein 
nature of ranibizumab after application to the patient’s eye by injection is completely metabolised and 
adsorbed  in  the  body.  Any  medicinal  product  that  reaches  water  streams  via  eventual  spills  during 
application or after disposal of unused drug is expected to be very rapidly degraded and mineralised to 
CO2 by microbial activity.  
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  MAH  had  appropriately  justified  the  lack  of  an  ERA.  The  lack  of 
additional non-clinical data is acceptable in view of the data submitted with the previous applications. 
Ranibizumab is not likely to pose a risk to the environment. 
4.3.  Clinical aspects 
4.3.1.  Clinical pharmacology  
The  mechanism  of  action  of  ranibizumab  is  to  decrease  permeability  of  leaking  blood  vessels.  This 
basic  mechanism  of  action  is  valid  independent  on  whether  targeting  choroidal  vessels  in  AMD  or 
retinal vessels in RVO. No dedicated clinical pharmacology profiling studies were conducted in patients 
with RVO. However, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic data for ranibizumab were collected 
in  the  2  pivotal  RVO  clinical  studies,  FVF4165g  and  FVF4166g.  For  details  on  the  study  designs  see 
Clinical efficacy below. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  previous  assay  to  measure  ranibizumab  in  serum  was  based  on  an  electrochemiluminescense 
assay  (sensitivity  of  300  pg/mL).  Genentech  has  now  developed  an  alternative  method,  a  sandwich 
ELISA with a colorimetric detection system to quantify ranibizumab in human serum (concentrations < 
0.075  ng/mL  less  than  reportable  for  human  serum  samples).  Since  there  is  no  cross-validation  with 
the previous analysis used for the AMD data, the comparison of PK data in AMD and RVO patients will 
be confounded by this fact. However, the ELISA method appears to perform well and with acceptable 
accuracy and precisions. 
To  assess  whether  the  systemic  exposure  in  RVO  was  similar  to  that  in  AMD  patients,  the  serum 
concentration  obtained  in  AMD  and  RVO  patients  were  compared  graphically.  Serum  sample  was 
collected from all patients in studies FVF4165g and 4166g before the first dose, 7 days after the third 
dose  in  month  2,  at  the  end  of  the  6-month  treatment  period,  and  at  the  end  of  the  observational 
period in month 12. In both trials, the majority of ranibizumab-treated patients had measurable serum 
ranibizumab concentrations at time points up to 14 days postdose. At the end of the dose interval (30 
days  after  the  previous  dose  administered),  serum  concentrations  of  ranibizumab  were  below  the 
assay  quantification  limit  for  the  majority  of  patients.  In  both  studies  there  were  isolated 
concentrations >5 ng/mL. 
The RVO patients appear to obtain systemic exposure of ranibizumab in the same magnitude as AMD 
patients, possibly the variability is higher in the RVO data although below the in vitro determined IC50 
for inhibition of biologic activity of VEGF-A.

In addition, the previously developed population PK model was used to simulate serum concentrations 
for  the  RVO  patients  and  these  were  compared  with  the  observed  concentrations  (a  total  of  441 
patients with 843 quantifiable ranibizumab concentrations). 
The final population PK model for RVO and AMD indicate similar parameter estimates for the two data 
sets,  but  it  is  noted  that  the  effect  of  creatinine  clearance  is  numerically  higher  in  the  RVO  patients. 
Although a somewhat higher exposure cannot be excluded in such subjects, no concerns are raised, a 
dose adjustment is not required. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamic  response  data  in  the  form  of  central  foveal  thickness  (CFT)  was  assessed  using 
optical  coherence  tomography  (OCT).  With  retreatment  based  on  the  protocol-specified  criteria,  the 
proportion  of  patients  with  CFT  ≤  250μm  in  the  0.3-mg  and  0.5-mg  ranibizumab  groups  at  month  6 
was generally maintained through month 12 in both studies. Upon initiation of ranibizumab treatment 
in the sham/0.5- mg group, the proportion of patients with CFT ≤ 250μm at month 12 was higher than 
at month 6, see figures below. 
Figure 1 Mean change from baseline in CFT 
Study FVF4165g BRVO 
Study FVF4166g CRVO 
Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  pharmacodynamic  assessment  of  ranibizumab  in  the  treatment  of  RVO  has  been  made  through 
anatomic  outcomes  (ranibizumab  effect  on  macular  oedema  measuring  the  CFT)  and  show  that 
ranibizumab reduces retinal thickness over time. The RVO patients appear to obtain systemic exposure 
of  ranibizumab  in  the  same  magnitude  as  AMD  patients,  possibly  the  variability  is  higher  in  subjects 
with RVO. Although a somewhat higher exposure cannot be excluded in such subjects, no concerns are 
raised  and  a  dose  adjustment  is  not  considered  required  and  also  difficult  to  make.  The  CHMP 
considered that adequate information is given in the updated section 5.2 of the SPC adopted with this 
Opinion.

Study  FVF3426g  (HORIZON)  is  an  uncontrolled,  Phase  3,  open-label  extension  study  performed  by 
Genentech  that  includes  a  cohort  of  patients  (Cohort  2)  with  RVO  who  have  completed  Study 
FVF4165g or Study FVF4166g. Data from this ongoing study are not included in this submission. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  efficacy  and  safety  outcome  of  FVF3426g  (HORIZON)  should  be 
submitted to support the long-term efficacy and safety of ranibizumab-treatment in RVO. 
Main clinical studies – Studies FVF4165g (BRVO) and FVF4166g (CRVO) 
Studies  FVF4165g  (BRVO)  and  FVF4166g  (CRVO)  have  a  similar  design  and  the  methodology 
description below refers to both studies unless otherwise indicated. 
Methodology 
Studies  FVF4165g  (BRVO)  and  FVF4166g  (CRVO)  were  Phase  3,  randomised,  multicenter,  double-
masked,  sham  injection–controlled,  3-arm  studies  with  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  evaluated  at 
Month  6.  The  study  consisted  of  a  28-day  screening  period,  a  6-month  sham-controlled  treatment 
period, and a 6-month observation period with treatment on an as needed basis.  
Study FVF4165g (BRVO) also included subjects with HRVO, see inclusion criteria. 
Except  for  the  subtypes  of  RVO,  the  studies  had  nearly  identical  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria,  but 
Study  FVF4165g  (BRVO)  allowed  for  the  concomitant  treatment  with  laser  photocoagulation  in  all 
treatment groups if deemed necessary, beginning at the Month 3 visit. 
Subjects were randomised (1:1:1) in a masked fashion to receive monthly sham treatment (needleless 
syringe pressed towards the conjunctiva), 0.3 or 0.5 mg of ranibizumab by intravitreal (IVT) injections 
during  the  first  6  months  of  the  study.  During  the  6-month  observation  period,  subjects  were

 
Improvement of > 10 letters on BCVA between screening and Day 0 
Although both studies were performed in the US the CHMP did not consider the extrapolation of these 
data  to  an  EU  population  with  regards  to  intrinsic  factors  a  concern.  Extrinsic  factors,  e.g.  potential 
differences  in  clinical  practice  are  also  not  considered  likely  to  have  a  meaningful  impact  on  the 
efficacy  outcome  in  view  of  the  internationally  recognised  treatment  recommendations  of  RVO. 
Exclusion of subjects with a pronounced afferent pupillary defect may indicate that subjects with major 
ischaemic  RVO  are  excluded,  but  subjects  with  some  degree  of  ischaemia  were  included  in  the  study 
(see further baseline data). Overall, ocular exclusion criteria are considered of relevance not to hamper 
the  evaluation  of  efficacy.  However,  diabetes  is  a  major  risk  factor  for  RVO,  several  diabetic  patients 
were included in these studies and it is likely that such subjects have significant diabetic retinopathy, 
or  has  been  through,  or  are  in  a  need  for  laser  photocoagulation.  The  MAH  is  therefore  requested  to 
comment  on  these  exclusion  criteria  with  regards  to  the  possibility  to  extrapolate  the  treatment  to  a 
relevant  diabetic  target  population  with  RVO.  In  addition,  the  lack  of  experience  of  treatment  in 
subjects with prior episodes of RVO should be addressed in the SPC. 
The  last  exclusion  criterion,  improvements  of  >  10  letters  from  screening  to  treatment  (28  days)  is 
considered  important  by  the  CHMP,  since  especially  in  BRVO,  a  spontaneous  improvement  is  not 
uncommon. In BRVO (where VA may further improve with laser treatment over 2-3 years), but also in 
CRVO,  the  long-term  effects  of  treatment  need  to  be  further  addressed  by  the  MAH.  Therefore,  the 
ongoing phase IIIb extension study (HORIZON, study FVF3426g, up to 2 years) including patients are 
those who completed the 12 months treatment and follow-up of the phase III studies is acknowledged. 
Since the clinical phase of the study was finalised in July, 2010, the study report should be submitted. 
In addition, the 5-year observational, multicenter cohort Luminous study (protocol CRFB002A2406) will 
be  conducted  to  further  study  and  describe  the  long-term  effectiveness,  treatment  patterns,  safety, 
and HRQoL associated with ranibizumab treatment for any approved indication. The MAH is requested 
to confirm that subjects with BRVO and CRVO will be included in this study.

  Months 0 to 5: Subjects had their first treatment (ranibizumab or sham) on Day 0 and were treated 
with  monthly  injections  months  0  to  5  (six  injections)  where  after  flexible  dosing  was  initiated 
according  to  the  below  criteria.  Concomitant  laser  rescue  treatment  (according  to  the  below)  was 
allowed in all treatment arms from the month 3 visit in study FVF4165g (BRVO), but not in Study 
FVF4166g (CRVO). Eyes with HRVO were treated the same as eyes with BRVO. 
  Months  6  to  12:  During  the  6-month  observation  period,  subjects  were  evaluated  monthly  to 
determine  the  need  for  re-treatment.  If  qualified  for  retreatment,  subjects  randomised  to  0.3-mg 
ranibizumab received the 0.3-mg dose, while subjects randomised to sham or 0.5-mg received 0.5-
mg ranibizumab. 
  Criteria  for  re-treatment  (months  6-11):  Subject’s  BCVA  20/40  (Snellen  equivalent)  using  Early 
Treatment  Diabetic  Retinopathy  Study  (ETDRS)  charts,  or  subject  has  mean  central  subfield 
thickness ≥ 250 μm on OCT. 
  Criteria  for  laser  rescue  (based  on  those  established  by  the  Branch  Vein  Occlusion Study (BVOS), 
1984): BCVA is  20/40 or a mean central subfield thickness ≥ 250 μm on OCT. 
  Compared with the visit 3 months prior to the current visit, subject has BCVA gain < 5 letters or a 
decrease < 50 μm in mean central subfield thickness. If not meeting the rescue criteria at Month 3 
the subject was to be reassessed at the Month 4 visit and again at the Month 5 visit, if applicable 
and similarly for the Month 9, 10 and 11 visits.

  Concomitant  treatment:  Subjects  continued  to  receive  all  medications  and  standard  treatment 
administered for their other conditions at the discretion of their physician except for those detailed 
in the exclusion criteria. In addition, concurrent oral and injectable corticosteroids were not allowed. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  in  BRVO,  a  laser-controlled  study,  or  a  study  allowing  laser  rescue  from 
start would have been preferred. By deferring laser treatment in the sham group, some subjects may 
have not received the best standard of care. The MAH justified this design as it will account for possible 
spontaneous  improvement  before  allowing  laser  treatment.  The  inclusion  of  a  laser  photocoagulation 
therapy and the 3-month waiting period for patients with BRVO is consistent with the outcome of the 
BVOS study (1984) which concluded that there was no basis for recommending early treatment. This is 
also consistent with current clinical practice where laser may be deferred for up to 6 months. 
However,  the  inclusion  criteria  allowed  an  oedema  due  to  BRVO  of  12  months  duration  and 
ranibizumab  has  a  3  month  treatment  advantage  ahead  of  laser.  The  consequences  of  this  study 
design are further discussed in the Subgroup analysis part of this report. 
  Objectives 
Primary: 
  To evaluate the efficacy of IVT injections of ranibizumab administered monthly for 6 months in 
the improvement of VA as measured by the mean change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 
at 6 months compared with baseline 
  To  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  IVT  injections  of  ranibizumab  administered  monthly 
for  6  months,  followed  by  a  6-month  observation  period  with  protocol-specified  retreatment 
criteria 
Secondary: 
  To  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  IVT  injections  of  ranibizumab  administered  monthly  for  6  months 
with  respect  to  other  VA  outcomes,  anatomic  outcomes,  and  patient-reported  visual  function 
outcomes  
  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ranibizumab in subjects with BRVO 
  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Outcome Measure:  
  The mean change from baseline in BCVA score at 6 months (4 meter distance). 
Secondary efficacy variables up to Month 6:  
  Proportion of subjects who gained ≥ 15 letters at 6 months compared with baseline 
  Proportion of subjects who lost < 15 letters at 6 months compared with baseline 
  Mean change from baseline in BCVA score over time  
  Proportion of subjects with a CFT of ≤ 250 μm (OCT), at 6 months 
  Mean absolute change from baseline in CFT (OCT), over time up to 6 months 
  Mean change from baseline in the NEI VFQ-25 near and distance activities subscale over time 
up to 6 months 
Secondary  efficacy  variables  up  to  Month  12  were  identical  to  those  above  but  assessment  was 
performed up to month 12.  
The CHMP considered that the outcome measures are relevant. However, especially in BRVO, it would 
have  been  desired  to  have  a  sham-controlled  study  up  to  12  months  with  a  key  efficacy  outcome 
measure evaluating the effect on VA at that time point.  
  Sample size 
BRVO: The sample size of 390 subjects (130 subjects per treatment group) provides 90% power in the 
ITT analysis to detect a statistically significant difference between one or both ranibizumab groups and 
the control group in the mean change from baseline in BCVA score at 6 months, assuming a change of 
+  12, +  10, and  +  2 letters  (BRVO)  for  the  0.5-mg, 0.3-mg  and  sham-treated  subjects,  respectively 
assuming an SD of 20 letters in the ranibizumab groups and 28 letters in the sham group. 
CRVO:  As  above,  but  assuming  a  change  of  +  8,  +  6,  and  −2  letters  for  the  0.5-mg,  0.3-mg,  and 
sham-treated subjects, respectively.

In  BRVO,  it  has  been  estimated  that  one  third  to  three  quarters  gain  2  or  more  lines  of  VA  without 
intervention. Thus, the calculation based on a +2 letter mean increase in VA is considered optimistic by 
the CHMP.  
  Statistical methods 
Analysis population:  
Intent-to-treat (ITT) population: all randomised subjects. 
 
  Per-protocol  (PP)  population:  subjects  sufficiently  protocol-compliant,  e.g.,  non-missing 
baseline and month 6 BCVA, not missed  3 treatments unless protocol-specified ditto.  
  Safety-evaluable  population:  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  injection  of  study  drug 
(ranibizumab or sham) 
Missing data  
Imputation  of  missing  values  to  be  performed  using  the  last-observation-carried-forward  (LOCF) 
method for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Statistical analyses:  
Primary analyses will be based on the ITT set. 
Subgroup analyses  
Subgroup  analyses  to  be  performed  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  and  key  secondary  efficacy 
endpoints. These will be based on age (< 65 years, ≥ 65 years), sex (male, female), race (White, non-
White),  BCVA  score  in  the  study  eye  (≤  34,  35  to  54, ≥  55  letters),  foveal thickness  as  assessed  on 
OCT in the study eye (< 450 μm, ≥ 450 μm), and any prior therapies for RVO in the study eye (yes, 
no) 
The  choice  of  statistical  methods  raises  no  concern  to  the  CHMP  and  the  hierarchical  testing  for 
secondary  endpoints  is  considered  stringent.  Since  analyses  include  both  of  mean  change  from 
baseline  and  responder  analyses,  the  planned  sensitivity  analyses  appear  adequate.  Only  descriptive 
statistics  has  been  planned  for  during  the  6  months  follow  up  phase.  In  view  of  the  lack  of  a  sham-
controlled  design  of  the  extension  part  of  the  study,  this  is  reasonable.  Additional  subgroup  analyses 
have  been  performed  as  recommended  in  the  CHMP  scientific  advice,  see  further  Subgroup  analyses 
discussion below.

Few  subjects  discontinued  treatment/study,  the  majority  due  to  subject’s  or  physician’s  decision  and 
the  figures  raise  no  concerns  to  the  CHMP.  Somewhat  more  subjects  discontinued  were  found  in  the 
sham  treatment  arms  in  both  studies.  Similar  reasons  for  discontinuations  in  the  treatment  as  in  the

extension  phase  suggest  that  the  switch  to  as-needed  treatment  did  not  alter  the  pattern  of 
discontinuations. 
In study FVF4165g (BRVO) a total of 397 subjects were randomised into the study with 1-23 subjects 
per site (total 93 sites).  N study FVF4166g (CRVO) 392 subjects were randomised into the study with 
1-14 subjects per site (total 95 sites). 
The majority of subjects were white (> 80%). In the studies taken together, 38 subjects whereof 30 
ranibizumab-treated  were    85  years.  For  a  detailed  description  of  the  baseline  characteristics  see

The  CHMP  concluded  that  VA  was  fairly  balanced  at  baseline.  In  subjects  with  BRVO,  slightly  more 
subjects  had  a  lower  baseline  VA  in  the  0.5  mg  ranibizumab  treatment  group,  while  in  subjects  with 
CRVO  somewhat  more  sham-treated  subjects  had  a  better  baseline  VA.  As  expected,  subjects  with 
CRVO had on average, a worse VA. 
Baseline  characteristics  of  the  study  eye  as  assessed  by  fundus  photography  and  fluorescence 
angiography were essentially comparable across the treatment groups, with the following exceptions: 
Somewhat  more  BRVO-treated  subjects  in  the  ranibizumab-treatment  groups  had  a  larger  retinal 
involvement of the occlusion; More CRVO-subjects in the 0.5 mg ranibizumab group had contralateral 
vessel formation; in BRVO-subjects, baseline CFT was smaller in the sham group although the average 
central subfield thickness and macular volume were similar across the 3 treatment groups. 
Demographics and ocular characteristics were essentially balanced at baseline and the included patient 
population  is  considered  by  the  CHMP  to  be  fairly  representative  for  the  target  population.  The  few 
differences are not considered to be in favour of the ranibizumab treatment groups. However, the vast 
majority of RVOs appeared non-ischaemic as defined by BVOS 1986 and CVOS, 1993 (BRVO < 5 disc

areas, CRVO <10 disc areas). This is considered to be a limitation of the targeted population and the 
MAH is requested to address this in the SPC and RMP. 
During the 12 months, 115 and 110 subjects received sham and 0.5 mg ranibizumab, in studies 4165 
and 4166, respectively. The majority of the previously sham-treated subjects (77-79%) received their 
first ranibizumab-injection month 6. Of the sham-treated subjects, 17 (13%, study 4165) and 20 (15%, 
study 4166) received no injections during the follow up phase. The majority of subjects received the 6 
monthly injections, and 3-4 additional injections during the following 6 months. Most previously sham-
treated subjects (>85%) received 0.5 mg ranibizumab during the follow up phase. Upon crossing over 
to  active  treatment  in  the  sham  arm,  the  extent  of  laser  treatment  was  similar  between  treatment 
arms,  with  somewhat  more  subjects  on  0.3  mg  ranibizumab  needing  rescue.  Overall,  the  extent  of 
laser  rescue  in  ranibizumab-treatment  groups  was  markedly  lower  compared  to  sham  and  thus 
considered reassuring by the CHMP.

b Based on pairwise ANOVA models adjusted for baseline VA (≤ 34, 35−54, ≥ 55 letters). 
The CHMP considered that a convincing outcome in both subsets of RVO has been demonstrated, both 
with regards to effect size and statistical significance. In view of the natural poor prognosis in CRVO, 
the outcome in this subset of RVO is even to be considered compelling. These data are supported by 
analysis of the PP population. 
However,  in  BRVO,  although  almost  three  times  more  sham-treated  subjects  received  rescue  laser 
during  the  first  6  months,  these  subjects  were  deferred  rescue  during  the  first  three  months  of  the 
study.  In  addition,  by  allowing  cross-over  of  sham-patients  to  active  treatment  after  6-months,  the 
impact  of  a  spontaneous  improvement  in  BRVO  on the  magnitude  of  effect  of  ranibizumab  cannot  be 
fully  assessed.  Thus,  the  results  for  the  treatment  groups  include  the  outcome  of  the  spontaneous 
resolution  of  the  oedema  as  well  as  the  effect  of  the  delayed  laser.  This  is  further  discussed  in  the 
section Subgroup analyses below.  
Secondary endpoints 
In  conclusion  the  CHMP  considered  that  all  VA-related  secondary  outcome  measures  confirmed  a 
robust and convincing effect of ranibizumab. An important proportion of subjects gained  15 letters at 
month  6.  For  ranibizumab  0.5  mg  >  60%  and  almost  50%  of  subjects  with  BRVO  and  CRVO  gained 
15 letters while the corresponding figures in the sham groups were ~ 30 and 17%. The robustness of 
data was confirmed with sensitivity analyses imputing missing data as failures. These proportions were 
maintained  with  continued  ranibizumab-treatment  during  the  following  6  months  where  an 
improvement  was  observed  in  subjects  that  crossed  over  to  receive  sham.  However,  the  overall

magnitude of improvement in the group that crossed over to ranibizumab-treatment remained smaller 
compared to subjects that received ranibizumab from study start and the 95% CI indicate a sustained 
effect of ranibizumab also compared with these subjects. Since the majority of subjects received active 
treatment  during  this  phase,  this  may  indicate  that  treatment  should  not  be  withheld,  or  that  the  in 
average 4 injections administered during this time period were not sufficient for an optimal response. 
The outcomes of anatomical parameters, i.e. changes in CFT were consistent with those based on VA. 
Also near and distance activities were significantly in favour of ranibizumab treatment, with a clinically 
relevant,  although  not  impressing  effect  size.  Taken  together,  a  convincing  effect  of  ranibizumab  has 
been  demonstrated  in  subjects  with  both  subsets  of  RVO.  However,  the  impact  of  weaknesses  of  the 
BRVO-study (3-months deferral of laser and short sham-controlled phase) are further addressed in the 
Subgroup analysis section below.

The incidence of iris neovascularisation was numerically smaller (few subjects in total) in ranibizumab-
treated subjects. However, at 12 months, an increased incidence was observed in ranibizumab-treated 
subjects  and  the  CHMP  therefore  requested  the  MAH  to  address  the  limited  experience  of  treating 
subjects with iris neovascularisation in the SPC, section 4.4. Rubeosis in the anterior chamber angle is 
further  considered  by  the  CHMP  to  be  a  serious  complication  to  CRVO  that  untreated  almost  always 
leads  to  increased  IOP  and  secondary  glaucoma.  Although  few  subjects  developed  this  complication, 
the  indication  that,  overall,  ranibizumab  seemed  to  reduce  the  neovascular  complications  is  of  clear 
interest.  Since  some  of  these  complications  develop  over  time,  the  CHMP  requested  that  the  MAH 
should include analyses of these in the extension study (HORIZON), in LUMINOUS. 
Subgroup analyses 
Study  FVF4165g  (BRVO):  Subgroup  analyses  for  the  primary  endpoint  (mean  VA  change  from 
baseline)  and  proportion  of  subjects  that  gained    15  letters  by  age,  gender,  race,  baseline  VA, 
baseline CFT and presence of prior therapy indicated a consistent treatment effect in all subgroups, see 
figure 3 below.  
Figure 3 Study FVF4165g Subgroup Analyses Mean Change from Baseline in VA, Month 6 (ITT) 
As in other analyses, the 12-month data were consistent with the 6-month data with an improvement 
in the previously sham-treated subjects. 
Study  FVF4166g  (CRVO):  As  in  subjects  with  BRVO,  the  treatment  effect  was  consistent  over 
subgroups, see figure 4 below.

Additional  post  hoc  subgroup  analyses  by  blood  pressure  (140/90  vs.  <140/<90),  baseline  retinal 
ischaemia (yes/no), history of cataract surgery, time since diagnosis of RVO (≤3 months, 3-12 months, 
≥12 months) showed a consistent treatment effect in favour of ranibizumab in all subgroups.  
The effect of ranibizumab was consistent in all subgroups. The majority of subjects had a RVO-duration 
of less than 3 months (BRVO 65%, CRVO 69%). This subgroup analysis indicated a convincing effect of 
ranibizumab  in  subjects  with  BRVO  (9-11  letters  over  sham).  Although  very  small  subgroups,  it  is 
reassuring to the committee that subjects with a long duration of RVO as well as subjects with retinal 
ischaemia  seemed  to  have  benefit  of  treatment.  However,  it  is  not  clear  to  the  CHMP  whether  the 
ischaemia,  in  the  total  34  subjects,  was  classified  according  to  the  criteria  set  up  by  BVOS  (>5  disc 
areas)  and  CVOS  (>10  disc  areas).  The  MAH  was  further  requested  to  present  key  efficacy  data 
comparing the subgroup with HRVO with those with BRVO. Besides further evaluating retinal ischaemia 
in the ongoing studies, the benefit of treatment in subjects with a long-standing oedema (>12 months) 
should also be addressed in these studies. 
Study FVF4165g (BRVO) Impact of spontaneous resolution of the oedema and delayed laser 
In the CHMP advice, the following main concerns with regards to the current study design were given:  
  Spontaneous improvement has been reported between 6 and 12 months and efficacy data that 
 
 
are not sham-controlled between 6 and 12 months will not be easily interpretable. 
The selection of a sham arm with deferred (3 months) laser rescue means that the test agent 
has a 3 month advance start on any active treatment. 
Laser treatment seems not to improve VA in the short term, rather after 2-3 years and 6 
months data could be seen as not providing clear evidence of a sustained advantage of IVT 
therapy over standard care in the long term. 
The MAH consequently made further subgroup analyses to assess a potential laser effect and the effect 
of spontaneous improvements in BCVA.  
-  Subgroup analysis of patients by first laser treatment and spontaneous improvement of VA (BRVO 
patients) 
This  3-month  laser  deferral  period  was  included  to  account  for  a  spontaneous  VA  improvement  that 
could occur in sham patients. Subgroups of patients were defined by  the visit at which the first laser 
treatment  was  administered  (including  a  subgroup  with  no  laser),  and  within  each  subgroup  the 
changes  from  Baseline  in  BCVA  (see  figures  5  and  6)  and  CFT  up  to  Month  12  and  the  number  of 
treatments (including the proportion receiving ranibizumab/sham injections by visit) were analysed.

Figure  6  BRAVO, sensitivity analysis: VA by time of first laser rescue treatment. Mean change from baseline – 0.5 
mg ranibizumab (ITT/LOCF) 
During the entire 12-month study period, 61.4% of the patients (n = 81) in the sham/ranibizumab 0.5 
mg  group  received  at  least  one  laser  treatment,  compared  with  41.0%  of  the  patients  in  the 
ranibizumab 0.3 group (n = 55) and 34.6% in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg group (n = 45). 
Of  the  100  patients  who  received  laser  photocoagulation  treatment  in  the  combined  ranibizumab 
groups, 33 had their first laser treatment at Month 3, 16 at Month 4, 6 at Month 5, and 32 at Month 9. 
All 4 groups showed, on average, an improvement in VA from Baseline before receiving their first laser 
treatment. At Month 3, the mean change in BCVA from Baseline ranged from +5 letters in the Month 3 
laser group to +15 letters in the Month 9 laser group. All 4 groups showed a mean increase in BCVA 
following  the  combination  of  laser  photocoagulation  and  ranibizumab  injection.  This  increase,  which 
was generally smaller than the increase from Baseline on the preceding ranibizumab monotherapy was 
sustained through the end of the study.

Figure  7  BRAVO,  sensitivity  analysis:  VA  by  time  of  first  laser  rescue  treatment.  Mean  change  from  baseline  – 
pooled 0.3 and 0.5 mg ranibizumab (ITT/LOCF) 
Because  laser  treatment  was  always  given  in  combination  with  ranibizumab  injections,  the  relative 
contribution of laser to the subsequent changes in VA cannot be evaluated based on these data. 
The  results  for  the  sham  control  group  include  the  outcome  of  the  spontaneous  resolution  of  the 
oedema as well as the effect of the delayed laser. The superiority of ranibizumab to sham treatment, 
therefore,  implies  that  the  therapeutic  effect  of  the  drug  in  general  and  its  rapid  onset  in  particular 
cannot  be  explained  by  spontaneous  improvement  of  VA.  Even  “responders”  to  sham  treatment  in 
Study FVF4165g (i.e. 51 sham-treated patients who never required laser treatment during the study) 
had,  on  average,  a  gain  in  mean  BCVA  at  Month  3  (approximately  6  letters)  which  was  markedly 
smaller  than  the  mean  improvement  of  approximately  15  letters  seen  in  the  entire  0.5  mg  group  at 
Month 3. 
In response to the MAH’s subgroup analyses, the CHMP considered that the MAH’s main deviation from 
the CHMP advice was that the study has not been sham-controlled over 12 months. On the other hand, 
masking  was  maintained  and  so  was  the  controlled  design  of  the  study  (the  originally  randomised 
groups  are  still  compared  to  each  others).  Since  the  sham-controlled  design  of  the  study  was  not 
maintained, the exact magnitude of effect of ranibizumab cannot be assessed. As detailed below, it is 
clear that there is an additive effect of ranibizumab. A subgroup analysis by the visit at which the first 
laser  treatment  (month  3,  4,  9  and  never)  was  administered  has  been  presented.  This  subgroup 
analysis is driven by the outcome (patients in need of laser did worse) and a perspective of efficacy, no 
conclusions on whether the combination of ranibizumab and rescue laser would be better or worse can 
be  drawn.  From  a  safety  point  of  view  (see  below),  no  new  concerns  were  identified  with  the 
combination. 
All ranibizumab-treated groups showed, on average, an improvement in VA before receiving their first 
laser treatment; for those who received laser at month 3, the average gain in VA was 5-7 letters (fairly 
stable  over  the  12  months)  while  those  who  received  no  or  later  laser  rescue  did  better  (up  to  ~15 
letters increase in VA). The observation that “sham responders” (51 subjects who never required laser) 
had, on average, an ~ 6 letter gain in mean BCVA at Month 3 compared to the mean ~15 letter gain 
seen in the corresponding non-laser 0.5 mg group at Month 3 and that the effect of ranibizumab was 
sustained also at 6 (ranibizumab +18-19 letters, sham +10 letters) and 12 months (ranibizumab +18-
19 letters, sham/0.5 mg +~13 letters) supports a clinically relevant treatment effect of ranibizumab. 
Still,  the  study  design  hampers  a  conclusion  on  the  magnitude  of  contribution  of  the  effect  of 
ranibizumab compared to the spontaneous improvement of VA and the effect of laser treatment. In the 
recent SCORE study (Arch Ophthalmol, 2009), 29% of laser-treated BRVO-subjects gained 15 letters 
of  VA  after  12  months.  This  is  very  similar  to  the  6  months  data  in  the  sham  group  (29%)  in  the 
current study and to be compared with the ~60% of 0.5 mg ranibizumab-treated subjects that gained

  15  letters  of  VA  (month  6  and  12).  Taken  together,  it  is  clear  that  ranibizumab  has  an  additional 
treatment effect also in BRVO and the above subgroup analyses as well as published data indicate that 
this effect size is of clinical relevance.  
Although  ranibizumab  had  a  3  month  advance  start  over  laser,  deferral  of  laser  for  3-6  months  is 
according  to  clinical  practice  and  an  effect  of  laser  on  VA  is  expected  to  be  seen  after  a  number  of 
years.  Since  the  majority  of  subjects  (65%)  had  duration  of  BRVO  of  less  than  3  months,  it  is 
reassuring that the subgroup analysis of subjects that will not be treated with laser in clinical practice 
(i.e. < 3 months duration of BRVO) demonstrated a convincing effect of ranibizumab (9-11 letters over 
sham).  Thus,  the  rapid  improvement  of  VA  in  BRVO is  acknowledged  and  of  value  for  the  patient.  In 
this  study,  subjects  that  improved    10  letters  in  VA  from  screening  to  study  start  (28  days)  were 
excluded. Consequently, as with laser, treatment with Lucentis may be deferred for some time, taking 
the risks with the injection in relation to the possibility for a spontaneous improvement into account.  
In  conclusion,  despite  limitations  of  study  FVF4165g,  the  CHMP  considered  that  a  clinically  relevant 
effect  of  ranibizumab  in  subjects  with  BRVO  has  been  sufficiently  demonstrated.  However,  the 
submitted study does not address whether there is a sustained advantage of ranibizumab therapy over 
standard care in the long term. In view of the shown effect of ranibizumab, it is difficult to require new 
laser-controlled  studies  and  long-term  effects  will  have  to  be  addressed  in  the  extension  study 
(HORIZON) as well as in the registry study (LUMINOUS). 
Selection of dose and dosing frequency 
In  this  submission  the  MAH  proposed  a  posology  that  is  essentially  identical  with  the  posology 
previously agreed upon for the treatment of DME. If supported by data, to facilitate the use in clinical 
practice, a harmonised posology is in general supported by the CHMP. 
Based  on  the  MAH’s  rationale  for  the  posology  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  0.5  mg  dose  was 
frequently numerically in favour over the lower dose and the choice of the 0.5 mg dose is subsequently 
endorsed.  As  in  previously  approved  indications,  the  effect  of  treatment  has  mainly  been  based  on 
changes in VA and 64% (BRVO) and (73%) of re-treatments were based on VA. Thus it is consistent 
also for RVO to base re-treatment criteria on VA.  
The recommendation regarding a treatment interruption after 3 consecutive monthly injections with a 
stable VA is endorsed, since a fourth consecutive injection gave no additional meaningful improvement 
in  VA  in  stable  subjects.  Also  the  re-treatment  recommendations  are  substantiated  with  analysis  of 
subjects that re-started treatment after an interruption. However, the MAH has not discussed when to 
stop treatment due to lack of effect. During the 12 months, a decrease in VA could already occur within 
1 month after treatment cessation and presently, monthly monitoring would be required to achieve an 
optimal treatment response. As in DME, the MAH was requested to commit to further analyse the long-
term  efficacy  of  Lucentis  with  help  of  the  ongoing  studies  (HORIZON,  LUMINOUS)  to  conclude  on 
whether monthly monitoring and repeat injections are needed long term or if it is possible to withdraw 
treatment or to reduce treatment intervals, in one or both subsets of RVO, with time. If warranted, the 
outcome of the studies should be used to suggest new treatment recommendations.  
Overall, the proposed posology is considered reasonable by the CHMP and very similar to that in DME, 
however, the MAH was requested to elaborate on the criteria for when to discontinue treatment due to 
a  lack  of  effect.  Also,  as  detailed  in  the  assessment  of  the  subgroup  analyses  above,  it  is  not  clear 
whether  ranibizumab-treatment  should  be  deferred  for  patients  with  BRVO  for  one,  two  or  three 
months to allow for a spontaneous resolution of the event. 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Two single pivotal trials investigated the effect of ranibizumab on the visual impairment due to macular 
oedema  secondary  to  RVO,  one  in  BRVO  and  the  other  in  CRVO.  Patients  from  these  trials  continued 
for  up  to  2  additional  years  (mean  additional  1.2  years)  in  the  extension  study  HORIZON  and 
preliminary  data  from  the  extension  has  been  submitted  (final  study  report  to  be  submitted  to  the 
CHMP when available). 
Six  months  after  being  treated  on  a  monthly  basis  BRVO,  and  CRVO  patients  on  ranibizumab 
significantly  improved  the  VA  with  respect  to  those  following  a  sham  procedure.  The  main  effect 
appears to be achieved as soon as by week 1 and remains basically stable or improves during the rest 
of  the  period.  Reassuring  results  were  obtained  when  the  benefit  was  measured  as  clinically  relevant 
improvement in VA (perceived as such by patients), anatomical or functional parameters.

During  the  extension  part  of  the  study,  in  subjects  with  BRVO,  the  effects  on  VA  were  essentially 
maintained.  The  treatment  group  that  initially  received  sham-injections  remained  stable  during  the 
extension phase with a very similar 24 months outcome compared to those that received ranibizumab 
from  study  start.  These  figures  may  thus  indicate  that  it  is  not  necessary  to  initiate  treatment 
immediately.  However,  the  rapid  improvement  in  VA  upon  treatment  initiation  is  recognised  as  a 
benefit  for  the  patient.  Since  some  reports  indicate  that  HRVO  differs  from  BRVO  with  regards  to 
pathogenesis, clinical features and prognosis, it is reassuring that the VA outcome from the 50 subjects 
presented with HRVO confirms the effect of ranibizumab also in this subset of patients. 
In subjects with CRVO, VA appeared to stabilise from month 15, the time point for the first quarterly 
visit  of  HORIZON.  The  3-4  letter  drop  in  VA  between  month  12  and  15  observed  in  both  subsets  of 
patients thus indicate that some subjects needed re-treatment. Overall, subjects that were previously 
sham-treated  did  not  gain  as  much  VA  as  those  who  were  treated  with  ranibizumab from  study  start 
ending up with a difference of almost 10 letters. Taken together, the long-term outcome indicates that 
the effect on VA is maintained over 2 years also in patients with CRVO. 
In both subsets of patients, also the initial decrease in CFT remained at fairly stable levels throughout 
the 24 months independent on when treatment was initiated. 
Although  neovascular  complications  developed  during  the  follow  up  period,  they  were  relatively  few. 
Since the majority of patients had no retinal ischaemia, a limited extent of neovascular complications 
would be expected. However, the MAH has committed to further address the effect of ranibizumab on 
the  development  of  neovascular  complications  in  the  planned  phase  24-months  IIIb  studies  E2401 
(CRVO)  and  E2402  (BRVO).  Even  though  an  improvement  in  VA  was  indicated  also  in  subjects  with 
retinal ischaemia and the rate of retinal ischaemia raised no new concerns during the extension study, 
few  such  subjects  were  included  in  the  studies,  and  there  is  insufficient  information  to  conclude  on 
whether  and  to  what  extent  retinal  ischaemia  and  subsequent  effects  on  vision  are  affected  by 
ranibizumab.  Information  on  the  limited  experience  in  these  subjects  is  now  given  in  the  SPC. 
However,  information  not  to  treat  patients  with  signs  of  functional  loss  due  to  ischaemia  is  also 
warranted.  In  addition,  it  is  considered  of  high  importance  that  the  MAH  make  further  efforts  to 
characterise  the  benefits  and  risks  of  ranibizumab-treatment  in  the  RVO  population  with  ischaemic 
disease  and  the  commitment  made  by  the  MAH  to  include  such  analyses  in  the  planned  studies  are 
acknowledged by the CHMP. 
Whereas  in  patients  suffering  CRVO  the  effect  of  ranibizumab  has  been  convincingly  established,  the 
potential benefit of ranibizumab in BRVO patients cannot be so easily isolated (in an additional or even 
synergic way) from that of the concomitant laser therapy that a group of patients received along the 
study. Additionally, the spontaneous improvement in early stages could also contribute to the observed 
response  given  that  patients  recently  diagnosed  were  preferentially  included  in  the  studies.  On  the 
other hand, masking was maintained over the 12 months and so was the controlled design of the study 
(the originally randomised groups were still compared to each others) and as detailed below, it is clear 
that there is an additive effect of ranibizumab. However, the study design does not allow assessing the 
exact magnitude of effect of ranibizumab over laser/spontaneous improvement. 
The effect of Lucentis was consistent over various subgroups, including the group of RVO patients with 
diabetes which is of importance since diabetes is a major risk factor for RVO.  
During the extension period, subjects received in average 3 additional injections but the variability was 
large  (range  0-11).  The  MAH  has  presented  subgroup  analysis  that  showed  that  in  BRVO, 
approximately 40% of subjects remained with a stable VA without any additional injections during the 
follow  up  period,  while  36%  needed  ≥3  injections.  Also  in  CRVO,  there  was  a  proportion  of  patients 
that  remained  stable  without  further  treatment,  although  this  proportion  was  lower  (20%)  and  the 
majority  of  these  patients  (55%)  needed  ≥  3  additional  injections.  The  analyses  of  the  2-year  data 
confirm  the  large  variability  in  both  subsets  of  RVO  and  also  that  there  is  a  potential  to  withdraw 
treatment  in  some  patients.  Thus  an  individualised  treatment  regimen  appears  reasonable.  The  MAH 
has  committed  to  further  address  whether  there  is  a  potential  to  adapt  the  monitoring  frequency  to 
individual  needs  by  assessing  the  predictive  value  of  observed  responses  to  treatment  and  for

treatment  interruption  in  the  upcoming  studies  E2401  and  E2402  as  well  as  in  the  registry  study 
LUMINOUS. This approach is endorsed by the CHMP. 
In subjects with BRVO, laser treatment is usually withheld for a number of months to allow time for a 
spontaneous  resolution  of  the  oedema  and  the  MAH  has  further  elaborated  on  when  to  initiate 
ranibizumab-treatment in these subjects. Despite that subjects who improved spontaneously between 
screening and study initiation were not to be enrolled, 17/20 of these subjects were actually included 
in  the  study.  In  this  subset  (mean  duration  of  the  disease  2-3  months,  range  0-11),  a  favour  of 
ranibizumab was indicated (5 letters over sham from baseline to month 3). This favour may be biased 
since  the  mean  duration  of  the  RVO  was  shorter  in  ranibizumab-treated  subjects.  However,  also  the 
initial  sham-controlled  analyses  clearly  indicate  that  there  was  a  rapid  improvement  in  VA  upon 
initiation of treatment with ranibizumab and a statistically significant difference vs. sham (5-6 letters) 
was  observed  from  day  7  (p  <0.0001)  while  at  month  6,  in  subjects  with  a  short  duration  of  BRVO 
(and a potential for a rapid spontaneous improvement in VA) indicated an ~10 letter increase in mean 
VA  in  ranibizumab-treated  subjects  over  those  who  were  treated  with  sham.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
long-term  HORIZON  outcome  indicates  that  the  initially  sham-treated  subjects  appeared  to  catch  up 
with those who received ranibizumab from study start. The data thus suggest that there is no need to 
initiate treatment immediately and even if treatment is delayed with 6 months, the average long-term 
outcome  in  VA  appears  not  negatively  affected.  The option  to  withhold  treatment  and  “wait  and  see” 
should  thus  be  weighed  against  the  potential  for  a  rapid  improvement  in  VA  in  case  of  an  early 
treatment  initiation.  Taken  together,  an  approach  to  leave  the  decision  whether  to  initiate  treatment 
immediately or whether to “wait and see” up to the discretion of the physician is supported. As a basis 
for such decision-making, the SPC, section 5.1 has been amended.  
The  MAH  has  also  further  elaborated  on  the  criteria  when  to  stop  treatment  to  avoid  unnecessary 
injections and argues that the proposed posology is based on study treatment and monitoring as well 
as data. The post-hoc analyses indicate that no further gain in VA is seen when patients were treated 
after having reached stability. The MAH also emphasises the high variability between patients to reach 
stability and underscores the importance of an individualised duration of the initial monthly treatment 
regimen.  Finally,  the  MAH  proposed  to  add  a  recommendation  to  section  4.2  of  the  SPC  that  clearly 
states that continued treatment is not recommended if there is no improvement in VA over the course 
of the first three injections. This statement is in line with the recommendations for DME and endorsed. 
However, the posologies for DME and RVO are now identical and have been merged in the SPC adopted 
with this Opinion, as requested by the CHMP. 
Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The benefit of Lucentis in the treatment of BRVO and CRVO has been demonstrated. Additional data to 
complement  the  knowledge  on  this  efficacy  will  be  available  once  the  upcoming  studies  (E2401  and 
E2402 and ‘LUMINOUS’) are completed. The MAH has committed to generate the additional data. This 
is endorsed by the CHMP.

4.3.3.  Clinical safety 
Safety  assessments  included  the  incidence  and  severity  of  ocular  adverse  events,  incidence  and 
severity of non-ocular adverse events, changes and abnormalities in clinical laboratory parameters and 
ocular  safety  assessments  (e.g.,  IOP  and  slitlamp),  incidence  of  positive  serum  antibodies  to 
ranibizumab and changes in vital signs.  
Patient exposure 
A  total  of  525  subjects  with  BRVO  or  CRVO  have  been  administered  ranibizumab  (0.3  –  0.5  mg, 
including those crossing over from sham to active treatment from month 6). Subjects have been given 
in  average  9  injections  during  12  months.  In  addition,  the  ongoing,  uncontrolled  Study  FVF3426g 
(HORIZON) (up to 2 year extension of pivotal studies) that was clinically completed in July 2010, but 
not  submitted  with  this  application  includes  longer  term  data  on  680  subjects  treated  with  0.5  mg 
ranibizumab.  Information  on  deaths  and  other  SAEs  known  to  have  occurred  in  this  extension  up  to 
and including 30 June 2010 was provided. 
The CHMP considered that the overall experience of IVT Lucentis in ocular disease has become large, 
with  exposures  of  ranibizumab  in  3736  and  337  patients  with  AMD  and  DME,  respectively.  For 
HORIZON,  only  safety  line  listings  of  SAEs  have  been  submitted.  The  CHMP  therefore  requested  that 
the study report and an updated summary of clinical safety should be submitted when available. 
Adverse events 
Ocular Adverse Events 
The most frequently reported ocular events in the ranibizumab groups were conjunctival haemorrhage 
and  retinal  exudates,  see  table  9  below.  For  ranibizumab-treated  patients,  38.3%  and  32.4%  of 
patients in the 0.3 mg and 0.5 groups, respectively, experienced an ocular AE that was suspected by 
the  investigator  to  be  related  to  study  drug  or  injection  procedure  compared  with  27.3%  of  sham-
treated patients, see table below.

manifestations  of  the  disease.  However,  they  appeared  more  frequently  in  ranibizumab-treated 
subjects and have been explained by the MAH to be due to grouping of various related terms each only 
seen  in  occasional  subjects.  Ocular  AEs  considered  related  to  the  injection  procedures  rather  than  to 
ranibizumab  included  haemorrhages,  vitreous  deposits,  transient  blindness,  conjunctival  hyperaemia, 
corneal (punctate) keratitis/erosions, pain and endophthalmitis.  
HORIZON 
During  the  extension  study,  ocular  AEs  were  largely  comparable  with  those  previously  reported 
although  the  incidence  of  retinal  depigmentation  or  pigmentation,  increased  IOP  and  cystoid  macular 
oedema increased with time.  
Non-Ocular Adverse Events 
The  most  frequently  experienced  non-ocular  AE  reported  overall  during  the  treatment  period  was 
hypertension  followed  by  nasopharyngitis.  The  pattern  was  similar  during  the  entire  study.  All  non-
ocular AEs (1.5% of patients) that were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug or 
injection procedure were experienced by single patients, see Table 10 below.

Serious adverse events and deaths 
Serious Ocular Adverse Events  
The occurrence of ocular SAEs was uncommon and no treatment differences were observed regarding 
the  frequencies  of  SAEs  in  the  active  groups  versus  the  sham  group  or  between  the  2  dose  groups. 
Most SAEs were experienced by a single patient only.

During  the  observation  period,  of  patients  in  the  sham/0.5  mg  group  treated  with  ranibizumab,  5 
patients  experienced  an  ocular  SAE  in  the  study  eye  (1  patient  each  with  diabetic  retinal  oedema, 
retinal tear, vitreous haemorrhage, cataract, maculopathy, and VA reduced). 
HORIZON 
The most common ocular SAE was macular oedema, which is an indication for the treatment, and may 
reflect suboptimal monitoring and re-treatment. However, a potential relevant AE cannot be discarded. 
Ocular SAEs for subjects enrolled in HORIZON are summarised in table 12 below.

Serious Non-Ocular Adverse Events 
The  occurrence  of  non-ocular  SAEs  was  uncommon  and  no  treatment  differences  were  observed 
regarding the frequencies of SAEs in the active groups versus the sham group or between the 2 dose 
groups. Most SAEs were experienced by single patients only.  
Of patients in the sham/0.5 mg group treated with ranibizumab, 15 patients experienced a non-ocular 
SAE  during  the  observation  period.  Events  included  1  patient  each  with,  for  example,  chest  pain, 
coronary  artery  disease,  hypertension  and  MI.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  there  were  few  non-ocular 
SAEs and the SAE profile raises no new concerns. 
Deaths 
A total of 7 patients died in the studies involving patients with RVO. Except for 1 death from cerebral 
haemorrhage,  none  of  the  deaths  (respiratory  failure,  pneumonia,  unknown,  gastric  cancer,  cardiac 
failure  congestive,  cardiac  failure  congestive  plus  sepsis)  was  suspected  by  the  investigator  to  be 
related to study treatment. This event and other notable cases are summarised below. 
  During  the  6-month  treatment  period  a  78-year-old  white  male  patient  (Patient  11009, 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg) in Study FVF4165g experienced a cerebral haemorrhage on Study Day 169, 
18  days  after  his  sixth  treatment  with  study  drug  (6  February  2009),  and  died  8  days  later  on 
Study Day 177. The medical history of this patient included a haemorrhagic stroke, an intracranial 
haemorrhage  (February  2007  and  May  2007,  respectively).  The  cerebral  haemorrhage  that 
resulted in the death of the patient was thought likely to be the result of amyloid angiopathy and 
hypertension.  The  investigator  considered  the  cerebral  haemorrhage  to  be  related  to  study  drug. 
Other suspected causes for the event included concurrent illnesses. The CHMP considered that the 
assessment  by the investigator’s (i.e. assigning the event of cerebral haemorrhage as treatment-
related)  appeared  reasonable.  On  the  other  hand,  this  patient  had  2  cerebrovascular  accidents 
before entering the study and would be at high risk of experiencing a new such event.  
Two  deaths  occurred  during  the  extension  study  (HORIZON):  cardiac  failure  congestive  and  cardiac 
failure  congestive  and  sepsis.  Both  events  were  not  suspected  to  be  related  to  ranibizumab  by  the 
investigator: 
  An 84-year-old white male patient (Patient 14404, 0.5 mg ranibizumab) experienced cardiac failure 
congestive on 31 Dec 2009 in Study FVF3426g (HORIZON) and died as a result on 04 May 2010. 
The  event  was  not  suspected  to  be  related  to  ranibizumab  by  the  investigator.  The  last  dose  of 
ranibizumab was on 05 Aug 2009. No relevant medical history was reported.  
  A 60-year-old white male patient (Patient 35602, 0.5 mg ranibizumab) experienced cardiac failure 
congestive and sepsis on 24 Nov 2009 in Study FVF3426g (HORIZON) and died the same day due 
to  these  AEs.  The  event was  not  suspected  to  be  related  to  ranibizumab  by the  investigator.  The 
last dose of ranibizumab was on 13 Oct 2009. Relevant medical history included congestive cardiac 
failure, hypertension, arrhythmia, and gout. 
Targeted Adverse Events 
This included the analysis of previously identified risks (current safety concerns for Lucentis as defined 
in wet AMD and DME patients) in the RVO population. The outcome was very similar during the entire 
12-months study period. No new safety concerns were identified in this population. There are also no 
indications that the incidence of AEs is increased in this population compared to subjects with AMD and 
DME. Nevertheless, information in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC regarding risks with systemic VEGF-
inhibition is certainly relevant also for this group of high-risk patients. Thus, the CHMP considered that 
the addition agreed upon in variation II/20 (DME-indication) should be included also for subjects with 
RVO. The MAH submitted updated product information documents, as requested. 
With regards to retinal ischaemia, even though potentially related to the disease, there was a decrease 
in the percentage of patients with “no ischemia” from baseline to month 24 which is of concern. During 
the sham-controlled phase of the study (6-months), more sham-treated patients with no ischaemia at 
baseline  developed  retinal  ischaemia  (6.6%  vs.  2.3%  for  ranibizumab-treated)  and  during  the  12

months,  there  was  a  tendency  towards  an  increased  number  of  patients  with  ischaemia  of  varying 
severity compared to baseline (3.4%). At month 24, 6 % of BRVO- and 12 % and CRVO-patients that 
were non-ischaemic at baseline developed ischaemia. 
There were no concerns with regards to the incidence of AEs that may be related to a systemic VEGF-
inhibition,  e.g.  arterial  thromboembolic  events  (ATEs),  haemorrhages,  hypertension  and  no  new 
concerns were raised during the extension period.  
During  the  6-  and  12-  month  treatment  periods,  the  mean  changes  from  Baseline  in  pre-dose 
Intraocular  pressure  (IOP)  at  each  visit  were  negligible  for  all  treatment  groups.  Few  patients  had  a 
pre-dose IOP increase of ≥10 mmHg compared with Baseline: Month 6, 0.9% - sham (2 of 232), 1.2% 
- 0.3 mg (3 of 250), and 1.7% - 0.5 mg group (4 of 234); Month 12, 4 patients (1.6%) - 0.3 mg group 
and  5  patients  (2.1%)  -  0.5  mg  group.  The  CHMP  acknowledged  that  the  majority  of  events  of 
increased IOP were post-injection and transient and manageable. 
The number of patients with iris neovascularisation of study eye at baseline was low in both studies. At 
6 months, the incidence of iris neovascularisation in the pooled studies was higher in the sham group 
than  in  the  active  ranibizumab  groups.  The  incidences  were  4.6%  in  the  sham  group  compared  with 
1.1%  and  1.6%  of  patients  in  the  0.3  and  0.5  mg  groups,  respectively  (slitlamp  examination)  and 
4.6%  in  the  sham  group  compared  with  0.8%  and  0.4%  in  the  0.3  and  0.5  mg  groups,  respectively 
(AE  reporting).  The  CHMP  considered  that  iris  neovascularisation  with  subsequent  neovascular 
complications  is  an  event  to  be  targeted  in  subjects  with  RVO.  Data  are  reassuring  although  few 
subjects presented with this complication and consistent with the mode of action of ranibizumab. It is 
therefore  considered  that  iris  neovascularisation  and  secondary  glaucoma  are  to  be  monitored  in  the 
PSURs.  
Immunological events 
Serum samples for evaluation of antibodies to ranibizumab were obtained at Screening, Month 6 (prior 
to  study  drug  administration),  and  at  Month  12  or  the  early  termination  visit.  Few  subjects  tested 
positive  for  antibodies,  notably  several  in  the  sham  group  and  at  baseline,  possibly  because  of  pre-
existing  anti-Fab  antibodies.  At  all  three  assessment  occasions  the  percentages  remained  below  5%. 
Changes in VA from baseline to month 12 for these patients were consistent with those in the full study 
populations,  and  no  clinically  relevant  differences  in  adverse  events  (AEs)  between  patients  with  and 
without  a  positive  antibody  response  were  identified.  There  was,  in  summary,  no  indication  that 
positive antibody tests had a negative effect on VA or was associated with a worse AE profile. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific drug interaction studies were performed. As systemic exposure of ranibizumab is expected 
to  be  very  low,  the  potential  for  drug  interactions  is  considered  low.  Subgroup  analyses  on  the 
concomitant  use  of  anticoagulant  drugs  and  ranibizumab  indicated  no  concerns  as  defined  as  RMP 
safety concerns, however, few patients (8%) used anticoagulant drugs during the study. AEs (occurred 
within  14  days  of injection)  with  and without  concomitant laser  treatment  (within  30  days  before  the 
injection)  were  evaluated  (Study  FVF4165g).  The  number  of  injections  that  occurred  in  presence  of 
laser  was  low,  there  appeared  to  be  no  major  effects  of  concomitant  laser  treatment  on  incidence  of 
AEs  defined  as  RMP  safety  concerns.  However,  an  overall  slightly  increased  incidence  of  intraocular 
inflammation  and  deterioration  of  retinal  blood  flow  was  indicated  both  in  sham  and  ranibizumab-
treated groups when laser was administered.  
The  CHMP  considered  that  laser  photocoagulation  as  such  also  induces  side  effects;  however, 
concomitant ranibizumab treatment did not appear to increase the incidence and severity of these. The 
proposed wording of the SPC, section 4.2 (according to the wording agreed upon for DME) is endorsed 
by the committee. The extent of laser rescue has been adequately included in a table in section 5.1 of 
the SPC. 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
Both  studies  had  good  patient  retention,  with  a  total  of  739  patients  (~95%)  completing  the  studies 
through  Month  6  and  92%  of  patients  completing  the  overall  study,  the  majority  of  discontinuations 
due  to  subject’s  or  physician’s  decision.  Overall,  few  subjects  discontinued  treatment  or  study  due  to 
AEs. During the 6-month treatment period, 6 patients had a ranibizumab or sham injection treatment 
held  according  to  protocol-specified  criteria:  2  patients  were  in  the  sham  group  (VA  loss,  IOP 
increased), 3 were in the 0.3 mg group (VA loss, sensory rhegmatogenous retinal break or detachment, 
intraocular surgery) and 1 was in the 0.5 mg group (intraocular surgery).

Post marketing experience 
Lucentis was approved for the treatment of RVO in the US on 22 June 2010. No post-marketing data 
regarding use of Lucentis in patients with RVO were available to include in this SCS because of the cut 
off date for PSUR 7 (30 Jun 2010). Lucentis is currently registered in 85 countries for the indication of 
neovascular (wet) AMD. 
Table 13 Exposures as reported in PSURs no 1-7: 
Cumulatively,  the  safety  database  contains  3419  spontaneous  reports,  including  1958  reports  from 
health care professionals. 
4.3.4.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  clinical  condition  for  which  an  indication  is  being  sought  differs  to  the  currently  authorised 
indications for Lucentis, i.e. AMD and DME, as the latter are chronic and progressive conditions. These 
conditions share however similarities with the sought indication from a demographic viewpoint and the 
proposed regimen has been tested in previous studies, so that the safety database from the authorised 
indications can be considered supportive and was taken as a reference for this application.  
Overall,  the  safety  database  for  the  RVO  indication  is  reassuring.  Most  of  the  ocular  AEs  observed  in 
this  RVO  population  are  related  to  the  injection  procedure.  Frequencies  are  in  line,  or  even  lower,  to 
those  registered  for  the  currently  authorised  conditions.  No  new  significant  ocular  related  AEs  have 
been  observed.  Most  AEs  were  of mild  severity.  The  most  frequently AEs  reported  were:  conjunctival 
haemorrhage, eye pain, increased IOP, maculopathy, myodesopsia, ocular hyperemia, ocular vascular 
disorder, retinal depigmentation, retinal exudates, and retinal vascular disorder.  
During  the  extension  study  (i.e.  in  subjects  exposed  to  ranibizumab  for  a  mean  total  of  2.2  years) 
ocular  AEs  were  largely  comparable  with  those  previously  reported.  Although  the  incidence  of  retinal 
depigmentation  or  pigmentation  and  (cystoid)  macular  oedema  increased  with  time,  they  were  likely 
manifestations associated with the disease. With respect to the increased incidence of macular oedema 
observed  during  this  extension,  the  MAH  has  justified  it  as  related  to  suboptimal  monitoring  and/or 
treatment. These differences have also been observed when macular oedema was reported as serious 
event and a potential relevant AE could not be discarded. The two planned 2-year studies (E2401 and 
E2402) can address this potential issue.  
The  CHMP  expressed  their  concern  over  the  potential  effect  of  ranibizumab  on  retinal  ischaemia. 
During the sham-controlled phase of the study (6-months), more untreated patients developed retinal 
ischaemia, while during the 12 months, there was a tendency towards an increased number of patients 
with ischaemia of varying severity compared to baseline. At month 24, 6 % of BRVO- and 12 % and 
CRVO-patients  that  were  non-ischaemic  at  baseline  developed  ischaemia.  However,  development  of 
retinal ischaemia is part of the disease, e.g. there are reports that in subjects with CRVO, 8 to 34 % of 
non-ischaemic  subjects  convert  to  an  ischaemic  state  over  a  number  of  years  and  the  rate  of 
conversion  presented  appears  not  to  be  alarming.  Still,  it  is  remains  unknown  whether  and  to  what 
extent  retinal  ischaemia  and  subsequent  effects  on  vision  are  affected  by  ranibizumab  and  the 
currently  available  data  only  give  limited  assurance.  The  limited  experience  in  treating  subjects  with 
retinal ischaemia is addressed in the SPC. Additionally, given that the risks with the injection are likely 
to  be  larger  than  a  potential  benefit  in  case  of  signs  of  functional  loss,  a  statement  not  to  treat 
subjects  with  irreversible visual  function  loss  due  to  ischaemia  has  also  been  added  to  section  4.4  of 
the SPC. The MAH has also committed to further address this concern in the upcoming studies and in 
LUMINOUS, as well as to monitor this as detailed in the RMP.

There  were  occasional  subjects  experiencing  a  second  event  of  RVO  although  the  incidence  was  not 
remarkable compared  to  published rates. As for retinal ischaemia, it is not known whether anti-VEGF 
therapy  may  increase  the  risk  for  recurrences  of  RVO.  This  potential  risk  is,  however,  covered  in  the 
RMP (RVO is included in the search strategy to detect reduced blood flow). However, this issue should 
also be addressed in future studies.  
With  regards  to  non-ocular  AEs,  as  in  the  previously  studied  populations,  the  majority  in  this  fairly 
representative  population  was  mild  to  moderate  in  severity  and  few  were  suspected  to  study  drug 
and/or  ocular  injection.  Although  no  indications  of  an  increased  risk  in  this  population,  the  major 
concern  relates  to  the  previously  identified  AEs  potentially  related  to  systemic  VEGF-inhibition,  a  risk 
relevant also for this group of patients. There are no new concerns with regards to immunogenicity in 
this  group  of  patients.  During  the  extension  period,  the  safety  profile  remained  consistent.  An 
increased number of subjects experienced cardiac heart failure congestive and TIA (SAEs) compared to 
the  first  treatment  year.  However,  in  view  of  the  significant  co-morbidities  (confirmed  by  disease 
history,  see  previous  assessment  report),  the  figures  (including  those  regarding  ATEs)  are  not 
considered  alarming  and  are  continuously  monitored  and  the  safety  specification  has  been  updated. 
There are no new concerns with regards to immunogenicity in this group of patients. 
Future  long-term  safety  data  (up  to  4  year)  in  these  conditions  will  be  collected  as  part  of  the 
observational LUMINOUS study and in the two planned 2-year phase IIIb studies.  
4.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The overall safety profile of ranibizumab in the treatment of macular oedema secondary to retinal vein 
occlusion is considered favourable by the CHMP.

Not applicable 
4.3.7.  Risk Management plan 
The most relevant updates to the safety specifications of the ranibizumab Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
from  the  previous  fully  implemented  version  RMP  7.2  and  the  interim  RMPs  produced  in  response  to 
EMA requests are summarised below. 
1.2.1. Exposure:  Clinical trial 
The  safety-evaluable  population  included  525  patients  treated  with  either  ranibizumab  0.3  mg  or  0.5 
mg  and  260  patients  treated  with  sham  injections.  During  the  6-month  treatment  period  with  a 
monthly  dosing  regimen,  2999  ranibizumab  injections  and  1436  sham  injections  were  administered. 
The mean number of injections per patient from Day 0 to Month 5 (of 6 scheduled injections) was 5.5 
for the sham group, 5.8 for the 0.3 mg group, and 5.7 for the 0.5 mg group.  
During the entire 12-month study with a monthly dosing regimen for the first 6 months and as-needed 
injections  for  the  second  6  months,  a  total  of  4660  ranibizumab  injections  were  administered.  The 
mean number of injections received from Day 0 to Month 12 per patient was 8.9; 9.1 for the 0.3 mg 
group and 8.7 for the 0.5 mg group.  
The safety population is limited but safety findings are supported by previous clinical trials in AMD and 
DME.

This  section  was  updated  to  include  RVO  studies.  The  lack  of  experience  in  patients  with  prior 
episode(s) of RVO has been addressed in the SPC. 
1.3. Populations not studied in the pre-authorization phase

of  the  proposed  indication  treatment  of  macular  edema  secondary  to  RVO.  As  in  previous  indications 
patients below 18 years, pregnant/lactating women etc. were not included in the trials. Patients with a 
history of CVA or MI within the previous three months were not included. The issue is addressed in the 
SPC. The majority of patients enrolled in pivotal studies were white. Eight percent were black. There is 
limited experience in patients of other ethnic origin. 
1.4 Post-authorisation experience 
Projected post-authorisation usage data in visual impairment secondary to RVO is updated. 
1.5 Adverse events 
1.5.1 Newly identified safety issues 
With regards to the indication treatment of visual impairment in DME, the RMP was amended by adding 
vitreous  haemorrhage  as  an  identified  risk.  Important  missing  information  for  patients  with  DME 
including  long-term  effects  on  the  progression  of  diabetic  retinopathy,  effects  of  Lucentis  on  the 
deterioration  of  retinal  blood  flow,  systemically  unstable  patients,  age  greater  than  75  years  and 
ethnicities other than Caucasian. The extension of the RESTORE study is aimed at collecting additional 
data on this risk/missing information.   
Data from BRAVO and CRUISE do not suggest any difference in safety concerns for patients with RVO. 
The identified and potential risks and missing information described apply to all indications. 
The following safety concerns require further evaluation for AMD (and by extension, RVO): 
Important identified risks 
  Hypersensitivity reactions 
  Retinal pigment epithelial tear 
  Endophthalmitis 
  Retinal detachment 
  Retinal tear 
 
 
 
  Vitreous hemorrhage 
Traumatic cataract 
Intraocular inflammation 
Intraocular pressure increase 
Important potential risks 
Proteinuria 
  Hypertension 
  Non-ocular hemorrhage 
 
  Myocardial infarction 
  Non-MI arterial thromboembolic events 
  Venous thromboembolic events 
  Deterioration of retinal blood flow (including central retinal artery occlusion CRAO) 
Important missing information for both wet AMD and visual impairment in DME 
  Systemic adverse events related to bilateral treatment and overdose 
  Adverse events related to off-label use, including potential local and systemic adverse events 
related to paediatric off-label use (e.g. retinopathy of prematurity)

 
Long term effects on the progression of diabetic retinopathy including the potential effect on 
diabetic retinopathy of stopping periodic anti-VEGF injections 
  Effects of Lucentis on the deterioration of retinal blood flow including macular ischemia 
  Systemically unstable patients 
  Age greater than 75 
  Ethnicities other than Caucasian 
Section  1.5.2.1  Details  of  important  identified  and  potential  risks  was  updated  to  include  data  from 
BRAVO and CRUISE studies. Pooled data from BRAVO and CRUISE studies (ranibizumab 0.5 mg) were 
used for calculation of incidence rates and relative risks. Data from HORIZON cohort 2 was included in 
the updated RMP.  
Overall, there was no indication of increased risks in the RVO target population. The number of MI and 
non-MI ATEs reports is low but with a tendency towards an increased risk for MI and non-MI ATEs is of 
concern.  There  were  41  reports  of  deterioration  of  retinal  blood  flow  in  the  ranibizumab  treated 
patients  and  47  reports  in  the  control  group  at  6  months,  rendering  a  relative  risk  of  0.88  (95%  CI 
0.60,  1.28),  which  was  higher  compared  to  the  AMD  and  DME  populations.  The  figures  should  be 
interpreted with caution due to possible confounding by indication (vein occlusion). 
1.7 Epidemiology of the indication and important adverse events 
1.7.1 Indication 
This section was updated to include RVO epidemiology data. Review of published data was performed. 
The prevalence of RVO in the general population was estimated between 0.3% and 2.1% depending on 
the study design and population assessed.  
Co-morbidity  in  the  target  population  for  RVO  is  discussed  concerning  cataract,  glaucoma, 
hypertension, diabetes, MI, stroke, hyperlipidemia, depression and anxiety. These topics are the same 
as discussed in relation to the approved indications. In the updated RMP coagulapathy is also discussed. 
Review of the literature demonstrates that prior glaucoma is associated with an increased risk of CRVO. 
Increase  in  IOP  has  been  observed  in  patients  treated  with  Lucentis,  both  short-term  transient 
increases  in  IOP  related  to  injection  procedure  and  increase  in  baseline  IOP  following  long-term 
treatment. 
Pharmacovigilance Plan 
Section  2.2  Safety  concerns  and  planned  pharmacovigilance  actions  was  updated  and  the  long-term 
observational  study  CRFB002A206  (LUMINOUS)  was  added  to  all  risk.  Additionally,  detailed  action 
plans  (section  2.3)  for  long  term  effects  on  the  progression  of  diabetic  retinopathy  including  the 
potential effect on diabetic retinopathy of stopping periodic anti-VEGF injections, effects of Lucentis on 
the deterioration of retinal blood flow including macular ischemia, systemically unstable patients, age 
greater than 75 and ethnicities other than Caucasian have been added. In sections 2.4 and 2.6 long-
term  observational  study  CRFB002A206  (LUMINOUS)  and  study  CRFB002D2303  (REVEAL)  have  been 
added. These changes do not refer to the RVO indication. 
Evaluation of the need for a Risk Minimisation plan 
Section  3.1  was  amended  with  planned  actions  for  vitreous  haemorrhage,  long-term  effects  on  the 
progression  of  diabetic  retinopathy  including  the  potential  effect  on  diabetic  retinopathy  of  stopping 
periodic anti-VEGF injections, effects on deterioration of retinal blood flow including macular ischemia, 
systemically  unstable  patients,  age  greater  than  75,  and  ethnicities  other  than  Caucasian.  These 
changes do not refer to the new proposed indication treatment of macular oedema in RVO. Section 3.6 
Potential  for  off-label  paediatric  use  was  adequately  updated.  The  risk  minimisation  plan  for 
Endophthalmitis  and  Traumatic  cataract  was  updated  concerning  the  educational  material.  The 
educational material has been updated with information regarding the new proposed indications in DME 
and RVO. In the health care professional educational material a self-questionnaire is included focusing 
on  knowledge  of  IVT  injection  procedure  technique,  potential  injection  related  side  effects  and 
monitoring and management of potential complications.  
Risk Minimisation plan 
The  educational  materials  for  health  care  professionals  and  patients  have  been  updated  with 
information regarding the new proposed indication. In the health care professional educational material

a self-questionnaire is included focusing on knowledge of IVT injection procedure technique, potential 
injection  related  side  effects  and  monitoring  and  management  of  potential  complications.  The  self-
questionnaire  is  considered  optional  by  the  MAH  and  there  are  no  plans  for  evaluation  of  the 
effectiveness of this material. At present, it is considered unlikely that there would be a large number 
of clinicians treating RVO who have not previously received the educational materials. However, in due 
time there will be new physicians entering the field of medical retina and the patients still need to be 
informed. A slight revision of the Conditions for Marketing Authorisation was therefore carried out (see 
Annex II). Follow-up of efficiency of the educational material is no longer required. The material will be 
available for distribution to patients and relevant physicians. Follow-up of efficiency of the educational 
material  is  no  longer  required.  The  HCP  self-assessment  questionnaire  (RMP  v  8.0  Annex  8)  is 
considered  optional  and  has  therefore  been  removed  from  the  educational  materials  referred  to  in 
Annex 8 of the RMP. 
Table  5.1  Summary  of  activities  for  each  safety  concern  has  been  amended  with  Long-term 
observational study CRFB002A2406 (LUMINOUS) for each previously included identified risk, important 
potential  risk  and  each  important  missing  information  item,  except  for  overdose.  Safety  activities  for 
vitreous  hemorrhage,  long  term  effects  on  the  progression  of  diabetic  retinopathy  (including  the 
potential effect on diabetic retinopathy of stopping periodic anti-VEGF injections), effects of Lucentis on 
the deterioration of retinal blood flow including macular ischemia, systemically unstable patients, age 
greater  than  75,  and  ethnicities  other  than  Caucasian.  Additionally,  table  5-2  Summary  of  activities 
and milestones has been amended with information on long-term observational study CRFB002A2406 
(LUMINOUS)  and  CRFB002D2303  (REVEAL).  These  changes  do  not  refer  to  the  new  proposed 
indication treatment of macular oedema in RVO. 
The issue of potential risk of glaucoma following long-term treatment with Lucentis is discussed by the 
MAH. In the pooled data for BRAVO and CRUISE for specific glaucoma terms the rates for sham were 
6/260  or  2.3%  and  for  0.5  mg  ranibizumab  2/259  or  0.8%,  which  does  not  suggest  a  signal  for  this 
event.  To  assess  long-term  data  in  RVO  the  MAH  proposes  to  further  analyse  the  RMP  risk  of 
“Increased  IOP”  in  the  planned  RVO  studies  CRFB002E2401  and  CRFB002E2402  as  well  as  in  the 
LUMINOUS  trial.  Additionally,  in  response  to  assessment  of  PSUR  7  including  response  to  the  EPITT 
signal 11801, the MAH proposed the inclusion of a warning in section 4.4 concerning transient as well 
as  sustained  increases  of  IOP  and  that  both  IOP  and  perfusion  of  the  optic  nerve  head  must  be 
monitored and managed appropriately. Since this information is considered especially relevant for the 
now  targeted  population,  the  change  is  endorsed  by  the  CHMP,  to  be  implemented  with  this 
application. Since there is no specific way to distinguish “transient IOP increased” from “sustained IOP 
increase”  it  was  agreed  to  amend  the  list  of  important  potential  risks  with  “glaucoma”.  Relevant 
sections of the RMP have been amended accordingly. The measures to assess potential long-term risk 
of glaucoma have been added to the RMP.  
In addition to the above, Annex 8 has been revised to reflect the current situation (post-launch of the 
AMD- indication) with the new indications, and now includes relevant additional safety concerns.

Demonstrated benefits 
The  mechanism  of  action  of  ranibizumab  is  to  decrease  permeability  of  leaking  blood  vessels.  This 
mechanism  of  action  is  valid  independent  on  whether  targeting  retinal  vessels  in  RVO,  DME  or  the 
choroidal  vessels  in  AMD.  Therefore,  available  data  from  the  AMD-  and  DME-populations  adds  to  the 
basic understanding of the drug. This is of relevance also for understanding the treatment of RVO.  
BRVO 
A  convincing  outcome  has  been  demonstrated,  both  with  regards  to  effect  size  and  statistical 
significance. After 6 months treatment, subjects with BRVO treated with 0.5 mg ranibizumab gained in 
average  18  letters  in  VA  compared  to  7  letters  for  sham-treated  subjects  (primary  endpoint, 
p<0.0001).  After  the  first  6  months  of  the  study,  previously  sham-treated  subjects  received  0.5  mg 
ranibizumab  for  an  additional  6  months  (masking  maintained),  while  subjects  previously  treated  with 
0.3  or  0.5  mg  ranibizumab  continued on  their  originally  assigned  treatment.  At  month  12,  previously 
sham-treated  subjects  had  gained  12  letters  (95%  CI  9.6,  14.6)  vs.  18  letters  in  the  0.5  mg 
ranibizumab-treatment  group  (95%  CI  15.8,  20.9).  At  month  6,  also  a  substantial  proportion  of 
ranibizumab-treated  (0.5  mg)  subjects  gained    15  letters  in  VA;  61  %  vs.  29  %  in  the  sham  group 
(p<0.0001).  The  outcomes  of  the  key  analyses  were  supported  by  sensitivity  analyses.  As  for  the 
primary endpoint, the switch to active therapy during the 2nd part of the study increased the proportion 
of responders in the previous sham-group, but the numerical advantage for subjects that had received 
ranibizumab  during  the  whole  study  remained.  The  0.3  mg  dose  of  ranibizumab  was  also  highly 
effective,  but  numerically  inferior  to  the  higher  dose  in  the  VA-based  analyses.  Other  secondary  and 
exploratory  endpoints  (based  on  VA  or  anatomical  measures)  were  consistently  in  favour  of 
ranibizumab-treatment. 
During  the  extension  part  of  the  study,  the  effects  on  VA  were  essentially  maintained  or  increased 
slightly. At  24  months,  the  VA  outcome  in  the  treatment  group  that  initially received  sham-injections 
was very similar to the outcome in patients that received ranibizumab from study start. These figures 
may  thus  indicate  that  it  is  not  necessary  to  initiate  treatment  immediately.  However,  the  rapid 
improvement  in  VA  upon  treatment  initiation  (5-6  letters  over  sham  after  1  week,  p<  0.0001)  is 
recognised as a benefit for the patient. 
However,  the  design  of  the  BRVO  study  has  limitations  and  deviates  from  recommendations  given  in 
the CHMP-advice. Although positive effects on vision after laser photocoagulation are not expected in 
the  short  term,  laser  photocoagulation  has  been  shown  to  be  of  long-term  benefit  for  subjects  with 
BRVO.  Since  subjects  in  the  sham  arm  were  deferred  (3  months)  laser  rescue,  the  test  agent  has 
consequently a 3-month advance start over laser. Further, in BRVO, spontaneous improvement in VA is 
not uncommon and subjects may continue to improve during the first year. Thus, the 6-months sham-
controlled phase of the study limits the possibility to assess the impact of a spontaneous improvement 
in  BRVO  vs.  the  magnitude  of  (contribution  of)  effect  of  ranibizumab,  this  since  the  results  for  the 
treatment  groups  include  besides  the  outcome  of  the  spontaneous  resolution  of  the  oedema  also 
effects of delayed laser. On the other hand, masking was maintained over the 12 months and so was 
the controlled design of the study (the originally randomised groups were still compared to each others) 
and as detailed below, it is clear that there is an additive effect of ranibizumab and that this effect is 
rapid  and  substantial.  However,  the  study  design  does  not  allow  assessing  the  exact  magnitude  of 
effect of ranibizumab. 
In  subgroup  analyses,  by  visit  at  which  the  first  laser  treatment  (month  3,  4,  9  and  never)  was 
administered,  all  ranibizumab-treated  groups  showed,  on  average,  an  improvement  in  VA  before 
receiving  their  first  laser  treatment.  Even  though  this  subgroup  analysis  is  driven  by  the  outcome 
(subjects who did worse received laser treatment), the observation that sham-treated subjects that did 
not require laser had, on average, an ~ 6 letter gain in mean BCVA at Month 3 compared to the mean 
~15  letter  gain  seen  in  the  corresponding  non-laser  0.5  mg  group  at  Month  3  supports  a  relevant

treatment effect of ranibizumab. Additionally, the extent of the need for laser rescue (almost three-fold 
more in the sham-group compared to ranibizumab) is supportive of a treatment effect of ranibizumab.  
Additionally, in the recent SCORE study (Arch Ophthalmol, 2009), 29% of laser-treated BRVO-subjects 
gained 15 letters of VA after 12 months. This is very similar to the 6 months data in the sham group 
(29%)  in  the  current  study  and  to  be  compared  with  the  ~60%  of  0.5  mg  ranibizumab-treated 
subjects that gained  15 letters of VA (month 6 and 12). Taken together, it is clear that ranibizumab 
has an additional treatment effect also in BRVO and the subgroup analyses as well as published data 
indicate that this effect size is of clinical relevance. 
Although  ranibizumab  had  a  3-month  advance  start  over  laser,  deferral  of  laser  for  3-6  months  is 
according  to  clinical  practice  and  an  effect  of  laser  on  VA  is  expected  to  be  seen  after  a  number  of 
years.  Since  the  majority  of  subjects  (65%)  had  a  duration  of  BRVO  of  less  than  3  months,  it  is 
reassuring that the subgroup analysis of subjects that will not be treated with laser in clinical practice 
(i.e. < 3 months duration of BRVO) demonstrated a convincing effect of ranibizumab (9-11 letters over 
sham).  
Overall,  the  effect  of  ranibizumab  has  been  demonstrated  also  taking  the  spontaneous  improvement 
and the 3-month deferral of laser into account. Thus, the lack of data evaluating the exact magnitude 
of the additive effect of ranibizumab is of minor concern. 
CRVO 
The design of this study also deviates from the CHMP advice since the sham-controlled period was not 
maintained  over  12  months.  As  for  BRVO,  the  masked  and  controlled  design  of  the  study  was 
maintained  (the  originally  randomised  groups  are  still  compared  to  each  others)  and  the  presented 
study  is  considered  acceptable  since  no  overall  spontaneous  improvement  will  be  expected  in  this 
group  of  patients.  In  CRVO,  ranibizumab-treated  subjects  (0.5  mg)  gained  in  average  15  letters  vs. 
1 letter  in  the  sham  group  (p<0.0001).  As  in  the  BRVO-study,  after  the  first  6  months  of  the  study, 
sham-treated subjects received active treatment. At month 12, previously sham-treated subjects had 
gained 7 letters (95% CI 4.5, 10.0) vs. 14 letters in the 0.5 mg ranibizumab-treatment group (95% CI 
11.5, 16.4). Also in CRVO, a substantial proportion of ranibizumab-treated (0.5 mg) subjects gained  
15  letters  in  VA;  48  %  vs.  17 %  in  the  sham  group  (p<0.0001).  The  outcomes  of  the  key  analyses 
were supported by sensitivity analyses and the secondary and exploratory endpoints were consistently 
in  favour  of  ranibizumab-treatment.  Overall,  the  outcome  in  subjects  with  CRVO  is  considered 
impressive. The effect was also maintained during the extension study with a slight drop in VA between 
month  12-15  (time  for  the  first  scheduled  visit),  where  after  VA  remained  stable.  At  24  months, 
subjects that were previously sham-treated did not gain as much VA as those who were treated with 
ranibizumab from study start ending up with a difference of almost 10 letters in mean VA. 
BRVO and CRVO 
With  preliminary  data  from  the  extension  study,  it  has  been  confirmed  that  the  treatment  effect  is 
maintained, at least over one additional year.  
Neovascular iris complications, especially in CRVO, are serious and if left untreated, they almost always 
lead  to  increased  IOP  and  secondary  glaucoma.  Importantly,  the  incidence  of  iris  neovascularisation 
was numerically smaller (few subjects in total) in ranibizumab-treated subjects compared to those who 
were  sham-treated  during  the  first  6  sham-controlled  months  of  the  core  studies.  However,  at  12 
months,  a  slightly  increased  incidence  was  observed  and  even  though  few  subjects  developed  these 
complications during the extension study and the MAH has committed to further address neovascular 
complications in the planned studies E2401 and E2402 as well as in the LUMINOUS study. 
The treatment effect was consistent over subgroups, including the group of RVO patients with diabetes 
which  is  of  importance  since  diabetes  is  a  major  risk  factor  for  RVO.  The  majority  of  subjects  had  a 
duration  of  RVO  of  less  than  3  months  (BRVO  65%,  CRVO  69%).  However,  a  treatment  effect  was 
shown  also  in  subjects  with  a  longer  duration  of  RVO.  Although  very  small  subgroups,  it  is  also 
reassuring  that  subjects  with  retinal  ischaemia  seemed  to  have  benefit  of  treatment,  however,  the 
limited  experience  in  these  subjects  is  now  addressed  in  the  SPC,  section  4.4  and  will  be  further 
investigated in upcoming studies.  
During the extension period, subjects received in average 3 additional injections but the variability was 
large  (range  0-11).  Further,  in  BRVO,  approximately  40%  of  subjects  remained  with  a  stable  VA 
without  any  additional  injections  while  the  corresponding  figures  in  CRVO  were  20%.  Thus,  the 
Assessment report

analyses of the, in total, 2-year data confirm the large variability in both subsets of RVO and also that 
there  is  a  potential  to  withdraw  treatment  in  some  patients.  The  MAH  intends  to  further  address 
whether  there  is  a  potential  to  adapt  the  monitoring  frequency  to  individual  needs  by  assessing  the 
predictive  value  of  observed  responses  to  treatment  and  for  treatment  interruption  in  the  upcoming 
studies E2401 and E2402 (as well as in LUMINOUS). If appropriate, the outcome of the studies could 
be used to suggest new treatment recommendations. This approach was endorsed by the CHMP. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Although it is considered that a clinically relevant effect of ranibizumab in subjects with BRVO has been 
sufficiently demonstrated, the submitted data does not address whether there is a sustained advantage 
of ranibizumab therapy over standard care in the long-term.  
Even  though  data  are  reassuring,  very  few  subjects  with  retinal  ischaemia  and  a  long  duration  (>12 
months)  of  RVO  were  included  in  the  studies,  and  some  uncertainties  with  regards  to  the  benefit  in 
these  groups  remain.  In  the  preliminary  data  from  the  extension  study  HORIZON,  the  rate  of  retinal 
ischaemia  raised  no  new  concerns.  However,  whether  and  to  what  extent  retinal  ischaemia  and 
subsequent effects on vision are affected by ranibizumab remains unknown, and the currently available 
data only give limited assurance. Information on the limited experience in these subjects is now given 
in the SPC. However, information not to treat patients with signs of functional loss due to ischaemia is 
also  warranted.  In  addition,  it  is  considered  of  high  importance  that  the  MAH  will  make  efforts  to 
characterise  the  benefits of  ranibizumab-treatment in  the  RVO population with ischaemic  disease  and 
the planned studies are acknowledged. 
Risks  
Demonstrated risks 
Ranibizumab  is  given  by  IVT  injections.  The  risks  with  such  injections  are  characterised  from  the 
previous  development  programme  including  patients  with  AMD  and  DME  and  consists  mainly  of 
increased IOP that is, in most cases, non-serious, transient and can be managed. In addition, there are 
risks  for  intraocular  inflammation,  damage  to  intraocular  tissues  including  increased  risks  for  retinal 
tears and detachment as well as potentially sight-threatening endophthalmitis. Overall, the submitted 
studies indicate that the risks appear similar for patients with RVO and there were no significant new 
safety  signals.  Concomitant  laser  rescue  and  ranibizumab  treatment  did  not  appear  to  increase  the 
incidence  and  severity  of  adverse  events.  Additionally,  during  the  extension  study  (i.e.  in  subjects 
exposed to ranibizumab for a mean total of 2.2 years) ocular AEs were largely comparable with those 
previously  reported.  Although  the  incidence  of  retinal  depigmentation  or  pigmentation  and  cystoid 
macular oedema increased with time, they were likely to be manifestations associated with the disease. 
With  regards  to  non-ocular  AEs,  as  in  the  previously  studied  populations,  the  majority  in  this  fairly 
representative  population  was  mild  to  moderate  in  severity  and  few  were  suspected  to  study  drug 
and/or ocular injection. An increased number of subjects experienced cardiac heart failure congestive 
and TIA (SAEs) compared to the first treatment year. However, in view of the significant co-morbidities 
(confirmed  by  disease  history),  the  figures  (including  those  regarding  ATEs)  are  not  considered 
alarming  and  are  continuously  monitored.  The  current  information  in  section  4.4  and  4.8  of  the  SPC 
regarding risks with systemic VEGF-inhibition is relevant also for this group of patients. 
The safety data set in RVO consists in total of 525 subjects treated with ranibizumab for up to one year 
and 413 subjects that have been treated in total for a mean of 2.2 years. Of these, 269 subjects have 
been treated for  2 years (occasional subjects up to 3 years). However the overall experience of IVT 
Lucentis  in  ocular  disease  has  become  quite  large  with  exposures  of  ranibizumab  in  3736  and  337 
patients  with  AMD  and  DME,  respectively  and  additional  safety  data  will  be  generated  in  the  registry 
study LUMINOUS as well as in the upcoming phase IIIb studies (studies E2401, E2402). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
A  remaining  concern  is  the  potential  effect  of  ranibizumab  on  retinal  ischemia.  During  the  sham-
controlled phase of the study (6-months), more untreated patients developed retinal ischaemia, while

during the 12 months, there was a tendency towards an increased number of patients with ischaemia 
of  varying  severity  compared  to  baseline.  At  month  24,  6  %  of  BRVO-  and  12  %  and  CRVO-patients 
that were non-ischaemic at baseline developed ischaemia. However, development of retinal ischaemia 
is part of the disease, e.g. there are reports that in subjects with CRVO, 8 to 34 % of non-ischaemic 
subjects  convert  to  an  ischaemic  state  over  a  number  of  years  and  the  rate  of  conversion  presented 
appears  not  to  be  alarming.  Still,  it  remains  unknown  whether  and  to  what  extent  retinal  ischaemia 
and subsequent effects on vision are affected by ranibizumab and the currently available data only give 
limited assurance. The MAH has committed to further address this concern in the upcoming phase IIIb 
studies and in LUMINOUS as well as to follow this as detailed in the RMP.  
There were occasional subjects experiencing a second event of RVO. As for retinal ischaemia, it is not 
known whether anti-VEGF therapy may increase the risk for recurrences of RVO even though the rate 
of  recurrences  was  not  alarming  compared  with  the  published  rates.  Although  included  in  the  RMP 
(covered by search terms), this should be further addressed in future studies.  
With respect to the increased incidence of macular oedema observed during the extension period, the 
MAH has justified it as related to suboptimal monitoring and/or treatment. These differences have also 
been  observed  when  macular  oedema  was  reported  as  serious  events.  However,  a  potential  relevant 
adverse  event  cannot  be  discarded.  The  post-approval  planned  studies  should  thus  also  address  this 
potential issue. 
The  RVO  is  also  a  population  with  a  high  prevalence  of  glaucoma  and  IOP  may  be  more  closely 
monitored  in  ranibizumab-treated  subjects  with  RVO.  The  MAH-proposed  amendment  of  the  SPC 
section  4.4  to  include  not  only  transient  increases  of  IOP,  but  also  to  address  that  such  sustained 
increases  are  considered  of  high  relevance  for  the  various  Lucentis  patient  populations.  The  CHMP 
considered this to be acceptable.  
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Treatment  with  ranibizumab  resulted  in  a  clinically  convincing  and  a  statistically  significant 
improvement of VA in subjects with RVO. However, the outcome of the non sham-controlled 6-months 
phase of the BRVO-study includes the outcome of the spontaneous resolution of the oedema as well as 
the  effect  of  the  delayed  laser  rescue.  Although  the  exact  effect  size  of  ranibizumab  cannot  be 
concluded on, the subgroup analyses as well as published data support a clinically relevant magnitude 
of  effect  of  ranibizumab  that  cannot  be  explained  by  a  spontaneous  improvement  or  the  deferred 
rescue laser. The rapid onset of improvement of VA in ranibizumab-treated subjects with BRVO is also 
acknowledged and of value for the patient. In view of the poor prognosis in CRVO, the outcome in this 
subset of RVO considered compelling. 
Treatment  is  not  without  risks;  however  the  risks  appear  comparable  to  that  previously  identified  in 
the AMD- and DME-populations. Besides risks for the manageable increase in IOP and injection-related 
damage  to  intraocular  tissues,  rare,  but  important  and  potentially  sight  threatening  risks  are  those 
associated  with  retinal  detachment  and  endophthalmitis.  The  most  important  potential,  although  not 
frequent,  non-ocular  risks  in  RVO-patients  that  already  have  major  cardiovascular  risk  factors  are 
those that are previously identified, i.e. risks that may be related to systemic VEGF-inhibition.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The natural progression of BRVO is very variable. Published data indicate that if untreated, one third to 
three  quarters  of  patients  may  improve  their  VA  over  2-3  years,  but  a  limited  proportion  of  subjects 
gain  10 letters of VA (<20% year1 to <40% year 3) a significant proportion (>20%) of subjects end 
up  with  a  poor  VA  (<20/200)  after  3  years.  If  treated  with  laser,  there  are  no  major  short-term 
benefits with regards to an improved vision (proportion with a 10 letter gain year 1 ~35%), however, 
over  3  years,  65%  gain    10  letters  in  VA  although    10  %  of  subjects  have  a  VA  20/200  (BVOS, 
1984). The current study presented a  15 letter gain in 61 % of patients after 6 months and 4% with 
a  VA20/200  at  12  months.  Although  the  long-term  effects  of  ranibizumab-treatment  are  not 
characterised, the rapid improvement (that was sustained over 12 months) in VA is considered to be of 
high  importance.  In  comparison  with  laser  photocoagulation,  the  risk  profile  in  ranibizumab-treated

patients  appears  very  different,  and  the  immediate  risk  is  estimated  to  be  higher  due  to  the  IVT 
injection. However, laser photocoagulation destroys retinal vessels and causes scar tissue.  
In  CRVO,  few  patients  gain  significant  VA,  and  with  time  severe  vision  loss  is  often  developed.  Laser 
treatment  has  not  been  shown  to  improve  VA  in  CRVO,  but  during  the  last  decade,  a  number  of 
treatments  have  been  investigated.  Such  treatments  include  vitrectomy  and  radial  optic  neurotomy 
(i.e.  surgical  procedures  are  associated  with  variable  outcomes  and  not  without  major  risks).  With 
Lucentis,  ocular  drug-related  AEs  have  been  reasonably  characterised,  are  manageable,  but  the 
potential  risks  regarding  systemic  effects  of  VEGF-inhibition  remain.  Also  in  CRVO,  the  effect  of 
Lucentis on VA was maintained during the second year of treatment.  
Recently, Ozurdex (dexamethasone implant) was approved to treat both subsets of RVO. Although no 
comparative data are available, 20-45% of subjects treated with Ozurdex increased their VA with  15 
letters with no major differences between patients with BRVO and CRVO (EPAR).  
The proposed posology for Lucentis in RVO is identical with that agreed upon for the treatment of DME 
(reason why the two posologies have been merged in the SPC) and supported since clear criteria when 
treatment is no longer recommended has been outlined in section 4.2 of the SPC. In addition, while in 
subjects  with  BRVO,  laser  treatment  is  usually  withheld  for  a  number  of  months  to  allow  time  for  a 
spontaneous  resolution  of  the  oedema,  the  MAH  further  elaborated  on  when  to  initiate  ranibizumab-
treatment  in  these  subjects.  The  MAH  presented  data  that  support  an  additional  treatment  effect  of 
ranibizumab over sham also in subjects with a very short duration of BRVO, i.e. in subjects that also 
recovered significantly (10 letters between screening and study start) prior to treatment initiation. On 
the  other  hand,  the  (in  total)  24  month  HORIZON  outcome  indicate  that  subjects  that  were  initially 
sham-treated  appeared  to  catch  up  with  those  who  received  ranibizumab  from  study  start.  The  data 
thus suggest that there is no need to initiate treatment immediately and even if treatment is delayed 
with  6  months,  the  average  long-term  outcome  in  VA  is  not  negatively  affected.  However,  it  is  clear 
that  the  time  to  improvement  in  VA  is  significantly  more  rapid  in  case  of  an  early  initiation  of 
treatment.  Overall,  an  approach  to  leave  the  decision  whether  to  initiate  treatment  immediately  or 
whether  to  “wait  and  see”  up  to  the  discretion  of  the  physician  is  supported.  As  a  basis  for  such 
decision-making, section 5.1 of the SPC has been amended.  
Overall, the rapid and substantial improvement in VA, taking the reassuring safety profile into account, 
is considered to outweigh the risk whether there is a sustained advantage of ranibizumab therapy over 
standard care in the long term in BRVO. In CRVO, the benefits of treatment also outweigh the risks. 
Collection of further data 
The MAH will further evaluate the efficacy and safety of ranibizumab treatment in patients with visual 
impairment due to macular oedema secondary to  RVO in the LUMINOUS study and in two additional, 
24-month,  Phase  IIIb  post-approval  studies  (CRFB002E2401  in  CRVO  and  CRFB002E2402  in  BRVO). 
These two studies are proposed to start Q4 2011. 
In  LUMINOUS,  the  safety  reports  will  include  all  AEs,  including  the  neovascularisation  AEs.  Interim 
reports will be submitted with PSURs, final evaluation within 9 months after end of the study. 
In both Phase IIIb studies (E2401 and E2402) the MAH committed to the following: 
- Efficacy evaluation of patients with or without retinal ischemia will include efficacy analyses in patient 
subgroups  with  different  baseline  ocular  characteristics,  including  the  presence  or  absence  of  retinal 
ischemia 
- Safety evaluation of the retinal ischemia progression over time as well as adverse events in patients 
with or without presence of ischemia 
- Safety evaluation of the neovascular complications based on the incidence rates of adverse events of 
ocular  neovascularisation  (cornea,  iris,  choroidal,  retinal)  -  Patients  with  visual  impairment  due  to 
macular oedema secondary to RVO will be included without limits of time since diagnosis of RVO 
- In the second year, the study design will allow skipping a visit based on the VA stability criterion to 
evaluate the less frequent monitoring and further evaluate the rate of treatment withdrawal long term

Study E2402 will further evaluate the added benefit of laser standard of care treatment in patients with 
BRVO. Both E2401 and E2402 protocols will be submitted within 1 month after approval.  
The  strategy  for  studies  E2401  and  E2402  is  endorsed.  In  addition,  the  MAH  may  consider 
differentiating  between  ischaemic  and  non-ischaemic  subtypes  of  RVO  while  applying  additional  the 
methodologies, e.g. some of those used by Hayreh and co-workers (2011). The MAH may also consider 
not excluding subjects with DR (including DME) and RVO in the upcoming studies E2401 and E2402 as 
well as preparing for analysis of those in the LUMINOUS study.  
See section 5 of this report for a tabulated summary of the commitments made by the MAH. 
4.4.  Product Information 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) 
Attachment 1 to the CHMP Assessment report included a ‘track changes’ version of the adopted SPC 
detailing all the changes. 
Labelling  
Not applicable 
Package Leaflet (PL) 
The  CHMP  reviewed  the  submitted  Results  of  consultation  with  target  patient  groups  for  the  Lucentis 
Patient  Information  Leaflet,  dated  29  July  2010.  The  MAH  proposed  a  bridging  to  a  user  test  carried 
out on the product Lucentis with indication wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The user test 
of the Lucentis wet AMD leaflet, performed in February/April 2006, was assessed and accepted by the 
CHMP.  The  MAH  explained  that  the  ‘parent’  (AMD  indication)  and  the  ‘daughter’  PL  (DME  +  RVO 
indication)  are  almost  identical  in  terms  of  design  and  layout,  and  are  covering  the  same  key  safety 
messages.  The  only  major  differences  are  the  different  posology  wording  and  the  wording  in  the 
Healthcare  Professional  section  due  to  the  additional  RVO  indication.  Because  of  their  inherent 
similarities,  reference  to  the  successful  outcome  of  the  user  test  of  the  Lucentis  ‘parent  PL’  was 
acceptable to the CHMP and no separate user test for the Lucentis ‘daughter PL’ was considered to be 
required.

5.  Conclusion 
Based on the CHMP review of the data on efficacy and safety, the CHMP considers that the overall B/R 
of  Lucentis  in  the  treatment  of  visual  impairment  due  to  macular  oedema  secondary  to  retinal  vein 
occlusion  is  positive  and  the  variation  application  EMEA/H/C/715/II/22  for  the  proposed  change  to 
extend the indication to include treatment of visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to 
retinal vein occlusion (RVO), is approvable. 
On  17  March  2011  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package 
Leaflet.

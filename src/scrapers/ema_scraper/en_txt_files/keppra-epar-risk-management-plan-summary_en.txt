PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of the RMP for levetiracetam 
This is a summary of the RMP for Keppra®/levetiracetam UCB. The RMP details important risks 
of Keppra/levetiracetam UCB, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about levetiracetam’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
The SmPC of Keppra/levetiracetam UCB and its package leaflet give essential information to 
healthcare professionals and patients on how levetiracetam should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Keppra/levetiracetam UCB should be read in the context of all 
this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all of which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
levetiracetam’s RMP.

THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
Keppra/levetiracetam UCB is authorized as a monotherapy for treatment of partial-onset seizures 
with or without secondary generalization in subjects from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed 
epilepsy and as an adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures with or without secondary 
generalization in adults, children, and infants from 1 month of age with epilepsy, myoclonic 
seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and 
primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with 
idiopathic generalized epilepsy (see SmPC for the full indication). Keppra contains levetiracetam 
as the active substance and is given via oral routes in the following strengths: tablets: 250mg, 
500mg, 750mg, 1000mg; oral solution: 100mg/mL; and concentrate for solution for infusion: 
100mg/mL. 
Further information about the evaluation of levetiracetam’s benefits can be found in 
levetiracetam’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, 
under the medicine’s webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/keppra

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND 
ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR FURTHER CHARACTERIZE 
THE RISKS 
Important risks of Keppra/levetiracetam UCB, together with measures to minimize such risks 
and the proposed studies for learning more about Keppra/levetiracetam UCB risks, are outlined 
below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be as follows: 
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
 The authorized pack size: the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so as to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly 
 The medicine’s legal status: the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or without 
prescription) can help minimize its risks 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of levetiracetam is not yet available, it is 
listed under “missing information” below. 
2.1 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Keppra/levetiracetam UCB are risks that need special risk management 
activities to further investigate or minimize the risk so that the medicinal product can be safely 
taken. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Keppra/levetiracetam UCB. Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. 
Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Postauthorization development plan 
Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorization 
There are no studies which are conditions of the marketing authorization or specific obligation of 
Keppra/levetiracetam UCB. 
2.3.2 
Other studies in postauthorization development plan 
Additional pharmacovigilance activities include the following: 
Registry studies to monitor pregnancy outcomes: support of EURAP and NAAPR. 
Activities include provision of requested data from registries to UCB and regular review of 
interim outputs from the registries. The protocols for EURAP and NAAPR include possible 
activities to follow-up on the children.  
Prescribers and reporters of pregnancy cases are encouraged to register pregnant women exposed 
to AEDs into the EURAP or NAAPR. Also, women can register themselves directly with the 
NAAPR, and they are encouraged to do so in the US Medication Guide.

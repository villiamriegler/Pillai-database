Bortezomib Hospira in combination with dexamethasone, or with dexamethasone and thalidomide, is 
indicated for the induction treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who 
are eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Bortezomib Hospira in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma who are 
unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
4.2  Posology and method of administrations 
Bortezomib Hospira treatment must be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the 
treatment of cancer patients, however Bortezomib Hospira may be administered by a healthcare 
professional experienced in use of chemotherapeutic agents. Bortezomib Hospira must be reconstituted 
by a healthcare professional (see section 6.6). 
Posology for treatment of progressive multiple myeloma (patients who have received at least one prior 
therapy) 
Monotherapy 
Bortezomib Hospira is administered via intravenous or subcutaneous injection at the recommended 
dose of 1.3mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 21-day 
treatment cycle. This 3-week period is considered a treatment cycle. It is recommended that patients 
receive 2 cycles of Bortezomib Hospira following a confirmation of a complete response. It is also 
recommended that responding patients who do not achieve a complete remission receive a total of 
8 cycles of Bortezomib Hospira therapy. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of 
Bortezomib Hospira. 
Dose adjustments during treatment and re-initiation of treatment for monotherapy 
Bortezomib Hospira treatment must be withheld at the onset of any Grade 3 non-haematological or any 
Grade 4 haematological toxicities, excluding neuropathy as discussed below (see also section 4.4). 
Once the symptoms of the toxicity have resolved, Bortezomib Hospira treatment may be re-initiated at 
a 25% reduced dose (1.3 mg/m2 reduced to 1.0 mg/m2, 1.0 mg/m2 reduced to 0.7 mg/m2). If the 
toxicity is not resolved or if it recurs at the lowest dose, discontinuation of Bortezomib Hospira must 
be considered unless the benefit of treatment clearly outweighs the risk. 
Neuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy 
Patients who experience bortezomib-related neuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy are to be 
managed as presented in Table 1 (see section 4.4). Patients with pre-existing severe neuropathy may be 
treated with Bortezomib Hospira only after careful risk/benefit assessment.

Combination therapy with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 
Bortezomib Hospira is administered via intravenous or subcutaneous injection at the recommended 
dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 21-day 
treatment cycle. This 3-week period is considered a treatment cycle. At least 72 hours should elapse 
between consecutive doses of Bortezomib Hospira. 
Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is administered at 30 mg/m² on day 4 of the Bortezomib Hospira 
treatment cycle as a 1 hour intravenous infusion administered after the Bortezomib Hospira injection. 
Up to 8 cycles of this combination therapy can be administered as long as patients have not progressed 
and tolerate treatment. Patients achieving a complete response can continue treatment for at least 
2 cycles after the first evidence of complete response, even if this requires treatment for more than 
8 cycles. Patients whose levels of paraprotein continue to decrease after 8 cycles can also continue for 
as long as treatment is tolerated and they continue to respond. 
For additional information concerning pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, see the corresponding 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Combination with dexamethasone 
Bortezomib Hospira is administered via intravenous or subcutaneous injection at the recommended 
dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 21 day 
treatment cycle. This 3-week period is considered a treatment cycle. At least 72 hours should elapse 
between consecutive doses of Bortezomib Hospira. 
Dexamethasone is administered orally at 20 mg on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 12 of the Bortezomib 
Hospira treatment cycle.

Dosage adjustments for transplant eligible patients 
For Bortezomib Hospira dosage adjustments, dose modification guidelines described for monotherapy 
should be followed. 
In addition, when Bortezomib Hospira is given in combination with other chemotherapeutic medicinal 
products, appropriate dose reductions for these products should be considered in the event of toxicities 
according to the recommendations in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Posology for patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) 
Combination therapy with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (BR-CAP) 
Bortezomib Hospira is administered via intravenous or subcutaneous injection at the recommended 
dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, followed by 
a 10-day rest period on days 12-21. This 3-week period is considered a treatment cycle. Six 
Bortezomib Hospira cycles are recommended, although for patients with a response first documented 
at cycle 6, two additional Bortezomib Hospira cycles may be given. At least 72 hours should elapse 
between consecutive doses of Bortezomib Hospira. 
The following medicinal products are administered on day 1 of each Bortezomib Hospira 3 week 
treatment cycle as intravenous infusions: rituximab at 375 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide at 750 mg/m2 
and doxorubicin at 50 mg/m2. 
Prednisone is administered orally at 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of each Bortezomib Hospira 
treatment cycle.

Dose adjustments during treatment for patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma 
Prior to initiating a new cycle of therapy: 
• 
Platelet counts should be ≥ 100,000 cells/μL and the absolute neutrophils count (ANC) should be 
≥ 1,500 cells/μL 
Platelet counts should be ≥ 75,000 cells/μL in patients with bone marrow infiltration or splenic 
sequestration 
• 
•  Haemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL 
•  Non-haematological toxicities should have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline. 
Bortezomib Hospira treatment must be withheld at the onset of any ≥ Grade 3 bortezomib-related 
non-haematological toxicities (excluding neuropathy) or ≥ Grade 3 haematological toxicities (see also 
section 4.4). For dose adjustments, see Table 5 below. 
Granulocyte colony stimulating factors may be administered for haematologic toxicity according to 
local standard practice. Prophylactic use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors should be 
considered in case of repeated delays in cycle administration. Platelet transfusion for the treatment of 
thrombocytopenia should be considered when clinically appropriate. 
Table 5: Dose adjustments during treatment for patients with previously untreated mantle cell 
lymphoma 
Toxicity 
Haematological toxicity 
•  ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia with fever, Grade 4 
neutropenia lasting more than 7 days, a 
platelet count < 10,000 cells/μL 
Posology modification or delay 
Bortezomib Hospira therapy should be withheld for up 
to 2 weeks until the patient has an ANC ≥ 750 cells/μL 
and a platelet count ≥ 25,000 cells/μL. 
• 
• 
If, after Bortezomib Hospira has been held, the 
toxicity does not resolve, as defined above, then 
Bortezomib Hospira must be discontinued. 
If toxicity resolves i.e. patient has an 
ANC ≥ 750cells/μL and a platelet count 
≥ 25,000 cells/μL, Bortezomib Hospira may be 
reinitiated at a dose reduced by one dose level (from 
1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2, or from 1 mg/m2 to 
0.7 mg/m2). 
• 
If platelet counts < 25,000 cells/μL or 
ANC < 750 cells/μL on a Bortezomib 
Hospira dosing day (other than Day 1 of 
each cycle) 
Grade ≥ 3 non-haematological toxicities 
considered to be related to Bortezomib Hospira 
Bortezomib Hospira therapy should be withheld 
Bortezomib Hospira therapy should be withheld until 
symptoms of the toxicity have resolved to Grade 2 or 
better. Then, Bortezomib Hospira may be reinitiated at a 
dose reduced by one dose level (from 1.3 mg/m2 to 
1 mg/m2, or from 1 mg/m2 to 0.7 mg/m2). For 
bortezomib-related neuropathic pain and/or peripheral 
neuropathy, hold and/or modify Bortezomib Hospira as 
outlined in Table 1. 
In addition, when Bortezomib Hospira is given in combination with other chemotherapeutic medicinal 
products, appropriate dose reductions for these medicinal products should be considered in the event of 
toxicities, according to the recommendations in the respective Summary of Product Characteristics.

Special populations 
Elderly 
There is no evidence to suggest that dose adjustments are necessary in patients over 65 years of age 
with multiple myeloma or with mantle cell lymphoma.  
There are no studies on the use of bortezomib in elderly patients with previously untreated multiple 
myeloma who are eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Therefore no dose recommendations can be made in this population.  
In a study in previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma patients, 42.9% and 10.4% of patients 
exposed to bortezomib were in the range 65-74 years and ≥ 75 years of age, respectively. In patients 
aged ≥ 75 years, both regimens, BR-CAP as well as R-CHOP, were less tolerated (see section 4.8). 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with mild hepatic impairment do not require a dose adjustment and should be treated per the 
recommended dose. Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment should be started on 
Bortezomib Hospira at a reduced dose of 0.7 mg/m2 per injection during the first treatment cycle, and a 
subsequent dose escalation to 1.0 mg/m2 or further dose reduction to 0.5 mg/m2 may be considered 
based on patient tolerability (see Table 6 and sections 4.4 and 5.2).

Based on NCI Organ Dysfunction Working Group classification for categorising hepatic impairment 
(mild, moderate, severe). 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of bortezomib are not influenced in patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] > 20 ml/min/1.73 m2); therefore, dose adjustments are not 
necessary for these patients. It is unknown if the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib are influenced in 
patients with severe renal impairment not undergoing dialysis (CrCL < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2). Since 
dialysis may reduce bortezomib concentrations, Bortezomib Hospira should be administered after the 
dialysis procedure (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of bortezomib in children below 18 years of age have not been established (see 
sections 5.1 and 5.2). Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made.

Method of administration 
Bortezomib Hospira is available for intravenous or subcutaneous administration. 
Bortezomib Hospira should not be given by other routes. Intrathecal administration has resulted in 
death. 
Intravenous injection 
Bortezomib Hospira reconstituted solution is administered as a 3-5 second bolus intravenous injection 
through a peripheral or central intravenous catheter followed by a flush with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml 
(0.9%) solution for injection. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of 
Bortezomib Hospira. 
Subcutaneous injection 
Bortezomib Hospira reconstituted solution is administered subcutaneously through the thighs (right or 
left) or abdomen (right or left). The solution should be injected subcutaneously, at a 45-90°angle. 
Injection sites should be rotated for successive injections. 
If local injection site reactions occur following Bortezomib Hospira subcutaneous injection, either a 
less concentrated Bortezomib Hospira solution (Bortezomib Hospira to be reconstituted to 1 mg/ml 
instead of 2.5 mg/ml) may be administered subcutaneously or a switch to intravenous injection is 
recommended. 
When Bortezomib Hospira is given in combination with other medicinal products, refer to the 
Summary of Product Characteristics of these products for instructions for administration. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to boron or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary and pericardial disease. 
When Bortezomib Hospira is given in combination with other medicinal products, refer to their 
Summaries of Product Characteristics for additional contraindications. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
When Bortezomib Hospira is given in combination with other medicinal products, the Summary of 
Product Characteristics of these other medicinal products must be consulted prior to initiation of 
treatment with Bortezomib Hospira. When thalidomide is used, particular attention to pregnancy 
testing and prevention requirements is needed (see section 4.6). 
Intrathecal administration 
There have been fatal cases of inadvertent intrathecal administration of bortezomib. Bortezomib 
Hospira is for intravenous or subcutaneous use. Bortezomib Hospira should not be administered 
intrathecally.

Gastrointestinal toxicity 
Gastrointestinal toxicity, including nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and constipation are very common 
with bortezomib treatment. Cases of ileus have been uncommonly reported (see section 4.8). 
Therefore, patients who experience constipation should be closely monitored. 
Haematological toxicity 
Bortezomib treatment is very commonly associated with haematological toxicities (thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia and anaemia). In studies in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma treated with 
bortezomib and in patients with previously untreated MCL treated with bortezomib in combination 
with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (BR-CAP), one of the most common 
haematologic toxicity was transient thrombocytopenia. Platelets were lowest at Day 11 of each cycle 
of bortezomib treatment and typically recovered to baseline by the next cycle. There was no evidence 
of cumulative thrombocytopenia. The mean platelet count nadir measured was approximately 40% of 
baseline in the single-agent multiple myeloma studies and 50% in the MCL study. In patients with 
advanced myeloma the severity of thrombocytopenia was related to pre-treatment platelet count: for 
baseline platelet counts < 75,000/μl, 90% of 21 patients had a count ≤ 25,000/μl during the study, 
including 14% < 10,000/μl; in contrast, with a baseline platelet count > 75,000/μl, only 14% of 
309 patients had a count ≤ 25,000/μl during the study. 
In patients with MCL (study LYM-3002), there was a higher incidence (56.7% versus 5.8%) of Grade 
≥ 3 thrombocytopenia in the bortezomib treatment group (BR-CAP) as compared to the 
non-bortezomib treatment group (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and 
prednisone [R-CHOP]). The two treatment groups were similar with regard to the overall incidence of 
all-grade bleeding events (6.3% in the BR-CAP group and 5.0% in the R-CHOP group) as well as 
Grade 3 and higher bleeding events (BR-CAP: 4 patients [1.7%]; R-CHOP: 3 patients [1.2%]). In the 
BR-CAP group, 22.5% of patients received platelet transfusions compared to 2.9% of patients in the 
R-CHOP group. 
Gastrointestinal and intracerebral haemorrhage, have been reported in association with bortezomib 
treatment. Therefore, platelet counts should be monitored prior to each dose of Bortezomib Hospira. 
Bortezomib Hospira therapy should be withheld when the platelet count is < 25,000/μl or, in the case 
of combination with melphalan and prednisone, when the platelet count is ≤ 30,000/μl (see section 
4.2). Potential benefit of the treatment should be carefully weighed against the risks, particularly in 
case of moderate to severe thrombocytopenia and risk factors for bleeding. 
Complete blood counts (CBC) with differential and including platelet counts should be frequently 
monitored throughout treatment with Bortezomib Hospira. Platelet transfusion should be considered 
when clinically appropriate (see section 4.2). 
In patients with MCL, transient neutropenia that was reversible between cycles was observed, with no 
evidence of cumulative neutropenia. Neutrophils were lowest at Day 11 of each cycle of bortezomib 
treatment and typically recovered to baseline by the next cycle. In study LYM-3002, colony 
stimulating factor support was given to 78% of patients in the BR-CAP arm and 61% of patients in the 
R-CHOP arm. Since patients with neutropenia are at increased risk of infections, they should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and treated promptly. Granulocyte colony stimulating 
factors may be administered for haematologic toxicity according to local standard practice. 
Prophylactic use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors should be considered in case of repeated 
delays in cycle administration (see section 4.2). 
Herpes zoster virus reactivation 
Antiviral prophylaxis is recommended in patients being treated with Bortezomib Hospira.  
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the Phase III study in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma, the overall incidence of 
herpes zoster reactivation was more common in patients treated with 
bortezomib+melphalan+prednisone compared with melphalan+prednisone (14% versus 4% 
respectively). 
In patients with MCL (study LYM-3002), the incidence of herpes zoster infection was 6.7% in the 
BR-CAP arm and 1.2% in the R-CHOP arm (see section 4.8). 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation and infection 
When rituximab is used in combination with Bortezomib Hospira, HBV screening must always be 
performed in patients at risk of infection with HBV before initiation of treatment. Carriers of hepatitis 
B and patients with a history of hepatitis B must be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs 
of active HBV infection during and following rituximab combination treatment with Bortezomib 
Hospira. Antiviral prophylaxis should be considered. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics 
of rituximab for more information. 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
Very rare cases with unknown causality of John Cunningham (JC) virus infection, resulting in PML 
and death, have been reported in patients treated with bortezomib. Patients diagnosed with PML had 
prior or concurrent immunosuppressive therapy. Most cases of PML were diagnosed within 12 months 
of their first dose of bortezomib. Patients should be monitored at regular intervals for any new or 
worsening neurological symptoms or signs that may be suggestive of PML as part of the differential 
diagnosis of CNS problems. If a diagnosis of PML is suspected, patients should be referred to a 
specialist in PML and appropriate diagnostic measures for PML should be initiated. Discontinue 
Bortezomib Hospira if PML is diagnosed. 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Treatment with bortezomib is very commonly associated with peripheral neuropathy, which is 
predominantly sensory. However, cases of severe motor neuropathy with or without sensory peripheral 
neuropathy have been reported. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy increases early in the 
treatment and has been observed to peak during cycle 5. 
It is recommended that patients be carefully monitored for symptoms of neuropathy such as a burning 
sensation, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, paraesthesia, discomfort, neuropathic pain or weakness.  
In the Phase III study comparing bortezomib administered intravenously versus subcutaneously, the 
incidence of Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy events was 24% for the subcutaneous injection group 
and 41% for the intravenous injection group (p=0.0124). Grade ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 
6% of patients in the subcutaneous treatment group, compared with 16% in the intravenous treatment 
group (p=0.0264). The incidence of all grade peripheral neuropathy with bortezomib administered 
intravenously was lower in the historical studies with bortezomib administered intravenously than in 
study MMY-3021. 
Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy should undergo neurological evaluation 
and may require a change in the dose, schedule or route of administration to subcutaneous (see section 
4.2). Neuropathy has been managed with supportive care and other therapies. 
Early and regular monitoring for symptoms of treatment-emergent neuropathy with neurological 
evaluation should be considered in patients receiving Bortezomib Hospira in combination with 
medicinal products known to be associated with neuropathy (e.g. thalidomide) and appropriate dose 
reduction or treatment discontinuation should be considered. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition to peripheral neuropathy, there may be a contribution of autonomic neuropathy to some 
adverse reactions such as postural hypotension and severe constipation with ileus. Information on 
autonomic neuropathy and its contribution to these undesirable effects is limited. 
Seizures 
Seizures have been uncommonly reported in patients without previous history of seizures or epilepsy. 
Special care is required when treating patients with any risk factors for seizures. 
Hypotension 
Bortezomib treatment is commonly associated with orthostatic/postural hypotension. Most adverse 
reactions are mild to moderate in nature and are observed throughout treatment. Patients who 
developed orthostatic hypotension on bortezomib (injected intravenously) did not have evidence of 
orthostatic hypotension prior to treatment with bortezomib. Most patients required treatment for their 
orthostatic hypotension. A minority of patients with orthostatic hypotension experienced syncopal 
events. Orthostatic/postural hypotension was not acutely related to bolus infusion of bortezomib. The 
mechanism of this event is unknown although a component may be due to autonomic neuropathy. 
Autonomic neuropathy may be related to bortezomib or bortezomib may aggravate an underlying 
condition such as diabetic or amyloidotic neuropathy. Caution is advised when treating patients with a 
history of syncope receiving medicinal products known to be associated with hypotension; or who are 
dehydrated due to recurrent diarrhoea or vomiting. Management of orthostatic/postural hypotension 
may include adjustment of antihypertensive medicinal products, rehydration or administration of 
mineralocorticosteroids and/or sympathomimetics. Patients should be instructed to seek medical 
advice if they experience symptoms of dizziness, light-headedness or fainting spells. 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 
There have been reports of PRES in patients receiving bortezomib. PRES is a rare, often reversible, 
rapidly evolving neurological condition, which can present with seizure, hypertension, headache, 
lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances. Brain imaging, 
preferably magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is used to confirm the diagnosis. In patients developing 
PRES, Bortezomib Hospira should be discontinued. 
Heart failure 
Acute development or exacerbation of congestive heart failure, and/or new onset of decreased left 
ventricular ejection fraction has been reported during bortezomib treatment. Fluid retention may be a 
predisposing factor for signs and symptoms of heart failure. Patients with risk factors for or existing 
heart disease should be closely monitored. 
Electrocardiogram investigations 
There have been isolated cases of QT-interval prolongation in clinical studies, causality has not been 
established. 
Pulmonary disorders 
There have been rare reports of acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease of unknown aetiology such 
as pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, lung infiltration, and acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS) in patients receiving bortezomib (see section 4.8). Some of these events have been fatal. A 
pre-treatment chest radiograph is recommended to serve as a baseline for potential post-treatment 
pulmonary changes. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the event of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (e.g., cough, dyspnoea), a prompt diagnostic 
evaluation should be performed and patients treated appropriately. The benefit/risk ratio should be 
considered prior to continuing Bortezomib Hospira therapy. 
In a clinical trial, two patients (out of 2) given high-dose cytarabine (2 g/m2 per day) by continuous 
infusion over 24 hours with daunorubicin and bortezomib for relapsed acute myelogenous leukaemia 
died of ARDS early in the course of therapy, and the study was terminated. Therefore, this specific 
regimen with concomitant administration with high-dose cytarabine (2 g/m2 per day) by continuous 
infusion over 24 hours is not recommended. 
Renal impairment 
Renal complications are frequent in patients with multiple myeloma. Patients with renal impairment 
should be monitored closely (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Bortezomib is metabolised by liver enzymes. Bortezomib exposure is increased in patients with 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment; these patients should be treated with Bortezomib Hospira at 
reduced doses and closely monitored for toxicities (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Hepatic reactions 
Rare cases of hepatic failure have been reported in patients receiving bortezomib and concomitant 
medicinal products and with serious underlying medical conditions. Other reported hepatic reactions 
include increases in liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinaemia, and hepatitis. Such changes may be reversible 
upon discontinuation of bortezomib (see section 4.8). 
Tumour lysis syndrome 
Because bortezomib is a cytotoxic agent and can rapidly kill malignant plasma cells and MCL cells, 
the complications of tumour lysis syndrome may occur. The patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome 
are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. These patients should be monitored closely and 
appropriate precautions taken. 
Concomitant medicinal products 
Patients should be closely monitored when given Bortezomib Hospira in combination with potent 
CYP3A4-inhibitors. Caution should be exercised when Bortezomib Hospira is combined with 
CYP3A4- or CYP2C19 substrates (see section 4.5).  
Normal liver function should be confirmed and caution should be exercised in patients receiving oral 
hypoglycemics (see section 4.5). 
Potentially immunocomplex-mediated reactions 
Potentially immunocomplex-mediated reactions, such as serum-sickness-type reaction, polyarthritis 
with rash and proliferative glomerulonephritis have been reported uncommonly. Bortezomib Hospira 
should be discontinued if serious reactions occur. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
In vitro studies indicate that bortezomib is a weak inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes 
1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4. Based on the limited contribution (7%) of CYP2D6 to the metabolism 
of bortezomib, the CYP2D6 poor metaboliser phenotype is not expected to affect the overall 
disposition of bortezomib. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the 
pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC increase of 
35% (CI90% [1.032 to 1.772]) based on data from 12 patients. Therefore, patients should be closely 
monitored when given bortezomib in combination with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, 
ritonavir). 
In a drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of omeprazole, a potent CYP2C19 inhibitor, on 
the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), there was no significant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of bortezomib based on data from 17 patients. 
A drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of rifampicin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, on the 
pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC reduction 
of 45% based on data from 6 patients. Therefore, the concomitant use of bortezomib with strong 
CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and St. John’s Wort) is 
not recommended, as efficacy may be reduced. 
In the same drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of dexamethasone, a weaker CYP3A4 
inducer, on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), there was no significant 
effect on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib based on data from 7 patients. 
A drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of melphalan-prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of 
bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC increase of 17% based on data 
from 21 patients. This is not considered clinically relevant. 
During clinical trials, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia were uncommonly and commonly reported in 
diabetic patients receiving oral hypoglycemics. Patients on oral antidiabetic agents receiving 
Bortezomib Hospira treatment may require close monitoring of their blood glucose levels and 
adjustment of the dose of their antidiabetics. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Contraception in males and females 
Male and female patients of childbearing potential must use effective contraceptive measures during 
and for 3 months following treatment. 
Pregnancy 
No clinical data are available for bortezomib with regard to exposure during pregnancy. The 
teratogenic potential of bortezomib has not been fully investigated.  
In non-clinical studies, bortezomib had no effects on embryonal/foetal development in rats and rabbits 
at the highest maternally tolerated doses. Animal studies to determine the effects of bortezomib on 
parturition and post-natal development were not conducted (see section 5.3). Bortezomib Hospira 
should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment 
with Bortezomib Hospira. 
If Bortezomib Hospira is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving 
this medicinal product, the patient should be informed of potential for hazard to the foetus.  
Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active substance that causes severe life-threatening birth 
defects. Thalidomide is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential 
unless all the conditions of the thalidomide pregnancy prevention programme are met. Patients 
receiving Bortezomib Hospira in combination with thalidomide should adhere to the pregnancy 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
prevention programme of thalidomide. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of 
thalidomide for additional information. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether bortezomib is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious 
adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with 
Bortezomib Hospira. 
Fertility 
Fertility studies were not conducted with Bortezomib Hospira (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Bortezomib Hospira may have moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Bortezomib Hospira may be associated with fatigue very commonly, dizziness commonly, syncope 
uncommonly and orthostatic/postural hypotension or blurred vision commonly. Therefore, patients 
must be cautious when driving or using machines and should be advised not to drive or operate 
machines if they experience these symptoms (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Serious adverse reactions uncommonly reported during treatment with bortezomib include cardiac 
failure, tumour lysis syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, posterior reversible encephalopathy 
syndrome, acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disorders and rarely autonomic neuropathy.  
The most commonly reported adverse reactions during treatment with bortezomib are nausea, 
diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, fatigue, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia, 
peripheral neuropathy (including sensory), headache, paraesthesia, decreased appetite, dyspnoea, rash, 
herpes zoster and myalgia. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Multiple myeloma 
Undesirable effects in Table 7 were considered by the investigators to have at least a possible or 
probable causal relationship to bortezomib. These adverse reactions are based on an integrated data set 
of 5,476 patients of whom 3,996 were treated with bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2 and included in Table 7. 
Overall, bortezomib was administered for the treatment of multiple myeloma in 3,974 patients. 
Adverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency grouping. Frequencies are 
defined as: Very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); 
rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the 
available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness. Table 7 has been generated using Version 14.1 of the MedDRA.  
Post-marketing adverse reactions not seen in clinical trials are also included.

Post-marketing adverse reaction regardless of indication 
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) 
The safety profile of bortezomib in 240 MCL patients treated with bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2 in 
combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (BR-CAP) versus 
242 patients treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone 
[R-CHOP] was relatively consistent to that observed in patients with multiple myeloma with main 
differences described below. Additional adverse drug reactions identified associated with the use of 
the combination therapy (BR-CAP) were hepatitis B infection (< 1%) and myocardial ischaemia 
(1.3%). The similar incidences of these events in both treatment arms, indicated that these adverse 
drug reactions are not attributable to bortezomib alone. Notable differences in the MCL patient 
population as compared to patients in the multiple myeloma studies were a ≥ 5% higher incidence of 
the haematological adverse reactions (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anaemia, 
lymphopenia), peripheral sensory neuropathy, hypertension, pyrexia, pneumonia, stomatitis, and hair 
disorders. 
Adverse drug reactions identified as those with a ≥ 1% incidence, similar or higher incidence in the 
BR-CAP arm and with at least a possible or probable causal relationship to the components of the 
BR-CAP arm, are listed in Table 8 below. Also included are adverse drug reactions identified in the 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
BR-CAP arm that were considered by investigators to have at least a possible or probable causal 
relationship to bortezomib based on historical data in the multiple myeloma studies. 
Adverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency grouping. Frequencies are 
defined as: Very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); 
rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the 
available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness. Table 8 has been generated using Version 16 of the MedDRA.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Herpes zoster virus reactivation 
Multiple myeloma 
Antiviral prophylaxis was administered to 26% of the patients in the B+M+P arm. The incidence of 
herpes zoster among patients in the B+M+P treatment group was 17% for patients not administered 
antiviral prophylaxis compared to 3% for patients administered antiviral prophylaxis. 
Mantle cell lymphoma 
Antiviral prophylaxis was administered to 137 of 240 patients (57%) in the BR-CAP arm. The 
incidence of herpes zoster among patients in the BR-CAP arm was 10.7% for patients not administered 
antiviral prophylaxis compared to 3.6% for patients administered antiviral prophylaxis (see section 
4.4). 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation and infection 
Mantle cell lymphoma 
HBV infection with fatal outcomes occurred in 0.8% (n=2) of patients in the non-bortezomib treatment 
group (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone; R-CHOP) and 0.4% 
(n=1) of patients receiving bortezomib in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
doxorubicin, and prednisone (BR-CAP). The overall incidence of hepatitis B infections was similar in 
patients treated with BR-CAP or with R-CHOP (0.8% vs 1.2% respectively). 
Peripheral neuropathy in combination regimens 
Multiple myeloma 
In trials in which bortezomib was administered as induction treatment in combination with 
dexamethasone (study IFM-2005-01), and dexamethasone-thalidomide (study MMY-3010), the 
incidence of peripheral neuropathy in the combination regimens is presented in the table below:

Elderly MCL patients 
42.9% and 10.4% of patients in the BR-CAP arm were in the range 65-74 years and ≥ 75 years of age, 
respectively. Although in patients aged ≥ 75 years, both BR-CAP and R-CHOP were less tolerated, the 
serious adverse event rate in the BR-CAP groups was 68%, compared to 42% in the R-CHOP group.

Notable differences in the safety profile of bortezomib administered subcutaneously versus 
intravenously as single agent 
In the Phase III study patients who received bortezomib subcutaneously compared to intravenous 
administration had 13% lower overall incidence of treatment emergent adverse reactions that were 
Grade 3 or higher in toxicity, and a 5% lower incidence of discontinuation of bortezomib. The overall 
incidence of diarrhoea, gastrointestinal and abdominal pain, asthenic conditions, upper respiratory tract 
infections and peripheral neuropathies were 12%-15% lower in the subcutaneous group than in the 
intravenous group. In addition, the incidence of Grade 3 or higher peripheral neuropathies was 10% 
lower, and the discontinuation rate due to peripheral neuropathies 8% lower for the subcutaneous 
group as compared to the intravenous group. 
Six percent of patients had an adverse local reaction to subcutaneous administration, mostly redness. 
Cases resolved in a median of 6 days, dose modification was required in two patients. Two (1%) of the 
patients had severe reactions; 1 case of pruritus and 1 case of redness. 
The incidence of death on treatment was 5% in the subcutaneous treatment group and 7% in the 
intravenous treatment group. Incidence of death from “Progressive disease” was 18% in the 
subcutaneous group and 9% in the intravenous group. 
Retreatment of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma 
In a study in which bortezomib retreatment was administered in 130 patients with relapsed multiple 
myeloma, who previously had at least partial response on a bortezomib-containing regimen, the most 
common all-grade adverse events occurring in at least 25% of patients were thrombocytopenia (55%), 
neuropathy (40%), anaemia (37%), diarrhoea (35%), and constipation (28%). All grade peripheral 
neuropathy and grade ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy were observed in 40% and 8.5% of patients, 
respectively. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In patients, overdose more than twice the recommended dose has been associated with the acute onset 
of symptomatic hypotension and thrombocytopenia with fatal outcomes. For preclinical cardiovascular 
safety pharmacology studies, see section 5.3. 
There is no known specific antidote for bortezomib overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient’s 
vital signs should be monitored and appropriate supportive care given to maintain blood pressure (such 
as fluids, pressors, and/or inotropic agents) and body temperature (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

Mechanism of action 
Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor. It is specifically designed to inhibit the chymotrypsin-like 
activity of the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex 
that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in 
regulating the turnover of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of 
the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis and affects multiple signalling cascades within 
the cell, ultimately resulting in cancer cell death. 
Bortezomib is highly selective for the proteasome. At 10 µM concentrations, bortezomib does not 
inhibit any of a wide variety of receptors and proteases screened and is more than 1,500-fold more 
selective for the proteasome than for its next preferable enzyme. The kinetics of proteasome inhibition 
were evaluated in vitro, and bortezomib was shown to dissociate from the proteasome with a t½ of 
20 minutes, thus demonstrating that proteasome inhibition by bortezomib is reversible. 
Bortezomib mediated proteasome inhibition affects cancer cells in a number of ways, including, but 
not limited to, altering regulatory proteins, which control cell cycle progression and nuclear factor 
kappa B (NF-kB) activation. Inhibition of the proteasome results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. 
NF-kB is a transcription factor whose activation is required for many aspects of tumourigenesis, 
including cell growth and survival, angiogenesis, cell-cell interactions, and metastasis. In myeloma, 
bortezomib affects the ability of myeloma cells to interact with the bone marrow microenvironment.  
Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types and that 
cancer cells are more sensitive to the pro-apoptotic effects of proteasome inhibition than normal cells. 
Bortezomib causes reduction of tumour growth in vivo in many preclinical tumour models, including 
multiple myeloma.  
Data from in vitro, ex-vivo, and animal models with bortezomib suggest that it increases osteoblast 
differentiation and activity and inhibits osteoclast function. These effects have been observed in 
patients with multiple myeloma affected by an advanced osteolytic disease and treated with 
bortezomib. 
Clinical efficacy in previously untreated multiple myeloma 
A prospective Phase III, international, randomised (1:1), open-label clinical study (MMY-3002 
VISTA) of 682 patients was conducted to determine whether bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 injected 
intravenously) in combination with melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone (60 mg/m2) resulted in 
improvement in time to progression (TTP) when compared to melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone 
(60 mg/m2) in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. Treatment was administered for a 
maximum of 9 cycles (approximately 54 weeks) and was discontinued early for disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. The median age of the patients in the study was 71 years, 50% were male, 88% 
were Caucasian and the median Karnofsky performance status score for the patients was 80. Patients 
had IgG/IgA/Light chain myeloma in 63%/25%/8% instances, a median haemoglobin of 105 g/l, and a 
median platelet count of 221.5 x 109/l. Similar proportions of patients had creatinine clearance 
≤ 30 ml/min (3% in each arm). 
At the time of a pre-specified interim analysis, the primary endpoint, TTP, was met and patients in the 
M+P arm were offered B+M+P treatment. Median follow-up was 16.3 months. The final survival 
update was performed with a median duration of follow-up of 60.1 months. A statistically significant 
survival benefit in favour of the B+M+P treatment group was observed (HR=0.695; p=0.00043) 
despite subsequent therapies including bortezomib-based regimens. Median survival for the B+M+P 
treatment group was 56.4 months compared to 43.1 for the M+P treatment group. Efficacy results are 
presented in Table 11:

Patients eligible for stem cell transplantation 
Two randomised, open-label, multicenter Phase III trials (IFM-2005-01, MMY-3010) were conducted 
to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of bortezomib in dual and triple combinations with other 
chemotherapeutic agents, as induction therapy prior to stem cell transplantation in patients with 
previously untreated multiple myeloma. 
In study IFM-2005-01 bortezomib combined with dexamethasone [BDx, n=240] was compared to 
vincristine- doxorubicin-dexamethasone [VDDx, n=242]. Patients in the BDx group received four 
21 day cycles, each consisting of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 administered intravenously twice weekly on 
days 1, 4, 8, and 11), and oral dexamethasone (40 mg/day on days 1 to 4 and days 9 to 12, in Cycles 1 
and 2, and on days 1 to 4 in Cycles 3 and 4). 
Autologous stem cell transplants were received by 198 (82%) patients and 208 (87%) patients in the 
VDDx and BDx groups respectively; the majority of patients underwent one single transplant 
procedure. Patient demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar between the 
treatment groups. Median age of the patients in the study was 57 years, 55% were male and 48% of 
patients had high-risk cytogenetics. The median duration of treatment was 13 weeks for the VDDx 
group and 11 weeks for the BDx group. The median number of cycles received for both groups was 
4 cycles. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was post-induction response rate (CR+nCR). A statistically 
significant difference in CR+nCR was observed in favour of the bortezomib combined with 
dexamethasone group. Secondary efficacy endpoints included post-transplant response rates 
(CR+nCR, CR+nCR+VGPR+PR), Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival (OS). Main 
efficacy results are presented in Table 12.

In study MMY-3010 induction treatment with bortezomib combined with thalidomide and 
dexamethasone [BTDx, n=130] was compared to thalidomide-dexamethasone [TDx, n=127]. Patients 
in the BTDx group received six 4-week cycles, each consisting of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 administered 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
twice weekly days 1, 4, 8, and 11, followed by a 17-day rest period from day 12 to day 28), 
dexamethasone (40 mg administered orally on days 1 to 4 and days 8 to 11), and thalidomide 
(administered orally at 50 mg daily on days 1-14, increased to 100 mg on days 15-28 and thereafter to 
200 mg daily). 
One single autologous stem cell transplant was received by 105 (81%) patients and 78 (61%) patients 
in the BTDx and TDx groups, respectively. Patient demographic and baseline disease characteristics 
were similar between the treatment groups. Patients in the BTDx and TDx groups respectively had a 
median age of 57 versus 56 years, 99% versus 98% patients were Caucasians, and 58% versus 54% 
were males. In the BTDx group 12% of patients were cytogenetically classified as high risk versus 
16% of patients in the TDx group. The median duration of treatment was 24.0 weeks and the median 
number of treatment cycles received was 6.0, and was consistent across treatment groups. 
The primary efficacy endpoints of the study were post-induction and post-transplant response rates 
(CR+nCR). A statistically significant difference in CR+nCR was observed in favour of the bortezomib 
combined with dexamethasone and thalidomide group. Secondary efficacy endpoints included 
Progression Free Survival and OS. Main efficacy results are presented in Table 13.

Clinical efficacy in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma 
The safety and efficacy of bortezomib (injected intravenously) were evaluated in 2 studies at the 
recommended dose of 1.3 mg/m2: a Phase III randomised, comparative study (APEX), versus 
dexamethasone (Dex), of 669 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received 
1-3 prior lines of therapy, and a Phase II single-arm study of 202 patients with relapsed and refractory 
multiple myeloma, who had received at least 2 prior lines of treatment and who were progressing on 
their most recent treatment. 
In the Phase III study, treatment with bortezomib led to a significantly longer TTP, a significantly 
prolonged survival and a significantly higher response rate, compared to treatment with 
dexamethasone (see Table 14), in all patients as well as in patients who have received 1 prior line of 
therapy. As a result of a pre-planned interim analysis, the dexamethasone arm was halted at the 
recommendation of the data monitoring committee and all patients randomised to dexamethasone were 
then offered bortezomib, regardless of disease status. Due to this early crossover, the median duration 
of follow-up for surviving patients is 8.3 months. Both in patients who were refractory to their last 
prior therapy and those who were not refractory, OS was significantly longer and response rate was 
significantly higher on the bortezomib arm. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of the 669 patients enrolled, 245 (37%) were 65 years of age or older. Response parameters as well as 
TTP remained significantly better for bortezomib independently of age. Regardless of β2-
microglobulin levels at baseline, all efficacy parameters (TTP and OS, as well as response rate) were 
significantly improved on the bortezomib arm. 
In the refractory population of the Phase II study, responses were determined by an independent 
review committee (IRC) and the response criteria were those of the European Bone Marrow 
Transplant Group. The median survival of all patients enrolled was 17 months (range < 1 to 36+ 
months). This survival was greater than the six-to-nine month median survival anticipated by 
consultant clinical investigators for a similar patient population. By multivariate analysis, the response 
rate was independent of myeloma type, performance status, chromosome 13 deletion status, or the 
number or type of previous therapies. Patients who had received 2 to 3 prior therapeutic regimens had 
a response rate of 32% (10/32) and patients who received greater than 7 prior therapeutic regimens had 
a response rate of 31% (21/67).

In the Phase II study, patients who did not obtain an optimal response to therapy with bortezomib 
alone were able to receive high-dose dexamethasone in conjunction with bortezomib. The protocol 
allowed patients to receive dexamethasone if they had had a less than optimal response to bortezomib 
alone. A total of 74 evaluable patients were administered dexamethasone in combination with 
bortezomib. Eighteen percent of patients achieved, or had an improved response [MR (11%) or PR 
(7%)] with combination treatment. 
Clinical efficacy with subcutaneous administration of bortezomib in patients with relapsed/refractory 
multiple myeloma 
An open label, randomised, Phase III non-inferiority study compared the efficacy and safety of the 
subcutaneous administration of bortezomib versus the intravenous administration. This study included 
222 patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, who were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive 
1.3 mg/m2 of bortezomib by either the subcutaneous or intravenous route for 8 cycles. Patients who 
did not obtain an optimal response (less than Complete Response [CR]) to therapy with bortezomib 
alone after 4 cycles were allowed to receive dexamethasone 20 mg daily on the day of and after 
bortezomib administration. Patients with baseline Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy or platelet counts 
< 50,000/μl were excluded. A total of 218 patients were evaluable for response. 
This study met its primary objective of non-inferiority for response rate (CR+PR) after 4 cycles of 
single agent bortezomib for both the subcutaneous and intravenous routes, 42% in both groups. In 
addition, secondary response-related and time to event related efficacy endpoints showed consistent 
results for subcutaneous and intravenous administration (Table 15).

Bortezomib combination treatment with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (study DOXIL-MMY-3001) 
A Phase III randomised, parallel-group, open-label, multicentre study was conducted in 646 patients 
comparing the safety and efficacy of bortezomib plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin versus 
bortezomib monotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma who had received at least 1 prior therapy 
and who did not progress while receiving anthracycline-based therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint 
was TTP while the secondary efficacy endpoints were OS and ORR (CR+PR), using the European 
Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria. 
A protocol-defined interim analysis (based on 249 TTP events) triggered early study termination for 
efficacy. This interim analysis showed a TTP risk reduction of 45 % (95 % CI; 29-57 %, p < 0.0001) 
for patients treated with combination therapy of bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. The 
median TTP was 6.5 months for the bortezomib monotherapy patients compared with 9.3 months for 
the bortezomib plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combination therapy patients. These results, 
though not mature, constituted the protocol defined final analysis. 
The final analysis for OS performed after a median follow-up of 8.6 years showed no significant 
difference in OS between the two treatment arms. The median OS was 30.8 months (95% CI; 
25.2-36.5 months) for the bortezomib monotherapy patients and 33.0 months (95% CI; 28.9-37.1 
months) for the bortezomib plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combination therapy patients. 
Bortezomib combination treatment with dexamethasone 
In the absence of any direct comparison between bortezomib and bortezomib in combination with 
dexamethasone in patients with progressive multiple myeloma, a statistical matched-pair analysis was 
conducted to compare results from the non randomised arm of bortezomib in combination with 
dexamethasone (Phase II open-label study MMY-2045), with results obtained in the bortezomib 
monotherapy arms from different Phase III randomised studies (M34101-039 [APEX] and DOXIL 
MMY-3001) in the same indication. 
The matched-pair analysis is a statistical method in which patients in the treatment group (e.g. 
bortezomib in combination with dexamethasone) and patients in the comparison group (e.g. 
bortezomib) are made comparable with respect to confounding factors by individually pairing study 
subjects. This minimises the effects of observed confounders when estimating treatment effects using 
non-randomised data. 
One hundred and twenty seven matched pairs of patients were identified. The analysis demonstrated 
improved ORR (CR+PR) (odds ratio 3.769; 95% CI 2.045-6.947; p < 0.001), PFS (hazard ratio 0.511; 
95% CI 0.309-0.845; p=0.008), TTP (hazard ratio 0.385; 95% CI 0.212-0.698; p=0.001) for 
bortezomib in combination with dexamethasone over bortezomib monotherapy. 
Limited information on bortezomib retreatment in relapsed multiple myeloma is available.  
Phase II study MMY-2036 (RETRIEVE), single arm, open-label study was conducted to determine the 
efficacy and safety of retreatment with bortezomib. One hundred and thirty patients (≥ 18 years of age) 
with multiple myeloma who previously had at least partial response on a bortezomib-containing 
regimen were retreated upon progression. At least 6 months after prior therapy, bortezomib was started 
at the last tolerated dose of 1.3 mg/m2 (n=93) or ≤ 1.0 mg/m2 (n=37) and given on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 
every 3 weeks for maximum of 8 cycles either as single agent or in combination with dexamethasone 
in accordance with the standard of care. Dexamethasone was administered in combination with 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bortezomib to 83 patients in Cycle 1 with an additional 11 patients receiving dexamethasone during 
the course of bortezomib retreatment cycles. 
The primary endpoint was best confirmed response to retreatment as assessed by EBMT criteria. The 
overall best response rate (CR + PR), to retreatment in 130 patients was 38.5% (95% CI: 30.1, 47.4). 
Clinical efficacy in previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) 
Study LYM-3002 was a Phase III, randomised, open-label study comparing the efficacy and safety of 
the combination of bortezomib, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (BR-CAP; 
n=243) to that of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP; 
n=244) in adult patients with previously untreated MCL (Stage II, III or IV). Patients in the BR-CAP 
treatment arm received bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2; on days 1, 4, 8, 11, rest period days 12-21), rituximab 
375 mg/m2 intravenous on day 1; cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 intravenous on day 1; doxorubicin 
50 mg/m2 intravenous on day 1; and prednisone 100 mg/m2 orally on day 1 through day 5 of the 21 
day bortezomib treatment cycle. For patients with a response first documented at cycle 6, two 
additional treatment cycles were given. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival based on IRC assessment. Secondary 
endpoints included, TTP, time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TNT), duration of treatment free 
interval (TFI), overall response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR/CRu) rate, OS and response 
duration. 
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics were generally well balanced between the two 
treatment arms: median patient age was 66 years, 74% were male, 66% were Caucasian and 32% 
Asian, 69% of patients had a positive bone marrow aspirate and/or a positive bone marrow biopsy for 
MCL, 54% of patients had an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score of ≥ 3, and 76% had Stage IV 
disease. Treatment duration (median=17 weeks) and duration of follow-up (median=40 months) were 
comparable in both treatment arms. A median of 6 cycles was received by patients in both treatment 
arms with 14% of subjects in the BR-CAP group and 17% of patients in the R-CHOP group receiving 
2 additional cycles. The majority of the patients in both groups completed treatment, 80% in the 
BR-CAP group and 82% in the R-CHOP group. Efficacy results are presented in Table 16:

Median PFS by investigator assessment was 30.7 months in the BR-CAP group and 16.1 months in the 
R-CHOP group (Hazard Ratio [HR]=0.51; p < 0.001). A statistically significant benefit (p < 0.001) in 
favour of the BR-CAP treatment group over the R-CHOP group was observed for TTP (median 
30.5 versus 16.1 months), TNT (median 44.5 versus 24.8 months) and TFI (median 40.6 versus 
20.5 months). The median duration of complete response was 42.1 months in the BR-CAP group 
compared with 18 months in the R-CHOP group. The duration of overall response was 21.4 months 
longer in the BR-CAP group (median 36.5 months versus 15.1 months in the R-CHOP group). The 
final analysis for OS was performed after a median follow-up of 82 months. Median OS was 
90.7 months for the BR-CAP group compared with 55.7 months for the R-CHOP group (HR=0.66; 
p=0.001). The observed final median difference in the OS between the 2 treatment groups was 
35 months.  
Patients with previously treated light-chain (AL) Amyloidosis 
An open label non randomised Phase I/II study was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of 
bortezomib in patients with previously treated light-chain (AL) Amyloidosis. No new safety concerns 
were observed during the study, and in particular bortezomib did not exacerbate target organ damage 
(heart, kidney and liver). In an exploratory efficacy analysis, a 67.3% response rate (including a 28.6% 
CR rate) as measured by hematologic response (M-protein) was reported in 49 evaluable patients 
treated with the maximum allowed doses of 1.6 mg/m2 weekly and 1.3 mg/m2 twice-weekly. For these 
dose cohorts, the combined 1-year survival rate was 88.1%. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
bortezomib in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma and in mantle cell 
lymphoma (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
A Phase II, single-arm activity, safety, and pharmacokinetic trial conducted by the Children’s 
Oncology Group assessed the activity of the addition of bortezomib to multi-agent re-induction 
chemotherapy in paediatric and young adult patients with lymphoid malignancies (pre-B cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], T-cell ALL, and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma [LL]). An effective 
re-induction multi-agent chemotherapy regimen was administered in 3 blocks. Bortezomib was 
administered only in Blocks 1 and 2 to avoid potential overlapping toxicities with coadministered 
medicinal product in Block 3. 
Complete response (CR) was evaluated at the end of Block 1. In B-ALL patients with relapse within 
18 months of diagnosis (n = 27) the CR rate was 67% (95% CI: 46, 84); the 4-month event free 
survival rate was 44% (95% CI: 26, 62). In B-ALL patients with relapse 18-36 months from diagnosis 
(n = 33) the CR rate was 79% (95% CI: 61, 91) and the 4-month event free survival rate was 73% 
(95% CI: 54, 85). The CR rate in first-relapsed T-cell ALL patients (n = 22) was 68% (95% CI: 45, 86) 
and the 4-month event free survival rate was 67% (95% CI: 42, 83). The reported efficacy data are 
considered inconclusive (see section 4.2). 
There were 140 patients with ALL or LL enrolled and evaluated for safety; median age was 10 years 
(range 1 to 26). No new safety concerns were observed when bortezomib was added to the standard 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
paediatric pre B cell ALL chemotherapy backbone. The following adverse reactions (Grade ≥ 3) were 
observed at a higher incidence in the bortezomib containing treatment regimen as compared with a 
historical control study in which the backbone regimen was given alone: in Block 1 peripheral sensory 
neuropathy (3% versus 0%); ileus (2.1% versus 0%); hypoxia (8% versus 2%). No information on 
possible sequelae or rates of peripheral neuropathy resolution were available in this study. Higher 
incidences were also noted for infections with Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia (24% versus 19% in Block 1 and 
22% versus 11% in Block 2), increased ALT (17% versus 8% in Block 2), hypokalaemia (18% versus 
6% in Block 1 and 21% versus 12% in Block 2) and hyponatraemia (12% versus 5% in Block 1 and 
4% versus 0 in Block 2). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following intravenous bolus administration of a 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2 dose to 11 patients with 
multiple myeloma and creatinine clearance values greater than 50 ml/min, the mean first-dose 
maximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib were 57 and 112 ng/ml, respectively. In subsequent 
doses, mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/ml for the 1.0 mg/m2 
dose and 89 to 120 ng/ml for the 1.3 mg/m2 dose. 
Following an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection of a 1.3 mg/m2 dose to patients with 
multiple myeloma (n=14 in the intravenous group, n=17 in the subcutaneous group), the total systemic 
exposure after repeat dose administration (AUClast) was equivalent for subcutaneous and intravenous 
administrations. The Cmax after subcutaneous administration (20.4 ng/ml) was lower than intravenous 
(223 ng/ml). The AUClast- geometric mean ratio was 0.99 and 90% confidence intervals were 
80.18%-122.80%. 
Distribution 
The mean distribution volume (Vd) of bortezomib ranged from 1,659 l to 3,294 l following single- or 
repeated-dose intravenous administration of 1.0 mg/m2 or 1.3 mg/m2 to patients with multiple 
myeloma. This suggests that bortezomib distributes widely to peripheral tissues. Over a bortezomib 
concentration range of 0.01 to 1.0 μg/ml, the in vitro protein binding averaged 82.9% in human 
plasma. The fraction of bortezomib bound to plasma proteins was not concentration-dependent. 
Biotransformation 
In vitro studies with human liver microsomes and human cDNA-expressed cytochrome P450 isozymes 
indicate that bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolised via cytochrome P450 enzymes, 3A4, 
2C19, and 1A2. The major metabolic pathway is deboronation to form two deboronated metabolites 
that subsequently undergo hydroxylation to several metabolites. Deboronated-bortezomib metabolites 
are inactive as 26S proteasome inhibitors. 
Elimination 
The mean elimination half-life (t1/2) of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40-193 hours. 
Bortezomib is eliminated more rapidly following the first dose compared to subsequent doses. Mean 
total body clearances were 102 and 112 l/h following the first dose for doses of 1.0 mg/m2 and 
1.3 mg/m2, respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 l/h and 18 to 32 l/h following subsequent doses for 
doses of 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2, respectively.

Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib was assessed in a Phase I 
study during the first treatment cycle, including 61 patients primarily with solid tumors and varying 
degrees of hepatic impairment at bortezomib doses ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 mg/m2. 
When compared to patients with normal hepatic function, mild hepatic impairment did not alter 
dose-normalised bortezomib AUC. However, the dose-normalised mean AUC values were increased 
by approximately 60% in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. A lower starting dose 
is recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, and those patients should be 
closely monitored (see section 4.2, Table 6). 
Renal impairment 
A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in patients with various degrees of renal impairment who 
were classified according to their creatinine clearance values (CrCL) into the following groups: 
Normal (CrCL ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=12), Mild (CrCL = 40-59 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=10), Moderate 
(CrCL = 20-39 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=9), and Severe (CrCL < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=3). A group of 
dialysis patients who were dosed after dialysis was also included in the study (n=8). Patients were 
administered intravenous doses of 0.7 to 1.3 mg/m2 of bortezomib twice weekly. Exposure of 
bortezomib (dose-normalised AUC and Cmax) was comparable among all the groups (see section 4.2). 
Age 
The pharmacokinetics of bortezomib were characterized following twice weekly intravenous bolus 
administration of 1.3 mg/m2 doses to 104 paediatric patients (2-16 years old) with acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, 
clearance of bortezomib increased with increasing body surface area (BSA). Geometric mean (%CV) 
clearance was 7.79 (25%) L/hr/m2, volume of distribution at steady-state was 834 (39%) L/m2, and the 
elimination half-life was 100 (44%) hours. After correcting for the BSA effect, other demographics 
such as age, body weight and sex did not have clinically significant effects on bortezomib clearance. 
BSA-normalized clearance of bortezomib in paediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Bortezomib was positive for clastogenic activity (structural chromosomal aberrations) in the in vitro 
chromosomal aberration assay using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells at concentrations as low as 
3.125 μg/ml, which was the lowest concentration evaluated. Bortezomib was not genotoxic when 
tested in the in vitro mutagenicity assay (Ames assay) and in vivo micronucleus assay in mice. 
Developmental toxicity studies in the rat and rabbit have shown embryo-fetal lethality at maternally 
toxic doses, but no direct embryo-foetal toxicity below maternally toxic doses. Fertility studies were 
not performed but evaluation of reproductive tissues has been performed in the general toxicity 
studies. In the 6-month rat study, degenerative effects in both the testes and the ovary have been 
observed. It is, therefore, likely that bortezomib could have a potential effect on either male or female 
fertility. Peri- and postnatal development studies were not conducted. 
In multi-cycle general toxicity studies conducted in the rat and monkey, the principal target organs 
included the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in vomiting and/or diarrhoea; haematopoietic and 
lymphatic tissues, resulting in peripheral blood cytopenias, lymphoid tissue atrophy and 
haematopoietic bone marrow hypocellularity; peripheral neuropathy (observed in monkeys, mice and 
dogs) involving sensory nerve axons; and mild changes in the kidneys. All these target organs have 
shown partial to full recovery following discontinuation of treatment. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on animal studies, the penetration of bortezomib through the blood-brain barrier appears to be 
limited, if any and the relevance to humans is unknown.  
Cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies in monkeys and dogs show that intravenous doses 
approximately two to three times the recommended clinical dose on a mg/m2 basis are associated with 
increases in heart rate, decreases in contractility, hypotension and death. In dogs, the decreased cardiac 
contractility and hypotension responded to acute intervention with positive inotropic or pressor agents. 
Moreover, in dog studies, a slight increase in the corrected QT interval was observed.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Bortezomib Hospira is and what it is used for 
Bortezomib Hospira contains the active substance bortezomib, a so-called ‘proteasome inhibitor’. 
Proteasomes play an important role in controlling cell function and growth. By interfering with their 
function, bortezomib can kill cancer cells. 
Bortezomib is used for the treatment of multiple myeloma (a cancer of the bone marrow) in patients 
older than 18 years:  
- 
alone or together with the medicines pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or dexamethasone, for 
patients whose disease is worsening (progressive) after receiving at least one prior treatment and 
for whom blood stem cell transplantation was not successful or is unsuitable. 
in combination with the medicines melphalan and prednisone, for patients whose disease has not 
been previously treated and are unsuitable for high-dose chemotherapy with blood stem cell 
transplantation. 
in combination with the medicines dexamethasone or dexamethasone together with thalidomide, 
for patients whose disease has not been previously treated and before receiving high-dose 
chemotherapy with blood stem cell transplantation (induction treatment). 
- 
- 
Bortezomib is used for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (a type of cancer affecting the lymph 
nodes) in patients 18 years or older in combination with the medicines rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin and prednisone, for patients whose disease has not been previously treated and for whom 
blood stem cell transplantation is unsuitable. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Bortezomib Hospira 
Do not use Bortezomib Hospira 
- 
if you are allergic to bortezomib, boron or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6) 
if you have certain severe lung or heart problems.

if you think you have hepatitis infection now or have had it in the past. In a few cases, patients 
who have had hepatitis B might have a repeated attack of hepatitis, which can be fatal. If you 
have a history of hepatitis B infection you will be carefully checked by your doctor for signs of 
active hepatitis B. 
You must read the package leaflets of all medicinal products to be taken in combination with 
Bortezomib Hospira for information related to these medicines before starting treatment with 
Bortezomib Hospira. 
When thalidomide is used, particular attention to pregnancy testing and prevention requirements is 
needed (see Pregnancy and breast-feeding in this section). 
Children and adolescents 
Bortezomib should not be used in children and adolescents because it is not known how the medicine 
will affect them. 
Other medicines and Bortezomib Hospira

Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You should not use bortezomib if you are pregnant, unless clearly necessary. 
Both men and women receiving bortezomib must use effective contraception during and for up to 
3 months after treatment. If, despite these measures, pregnancy occurs, tell your doctor immediately. 
You should not breast-feed while using bortezomib. Discuss with your doctor when it is safe to restart 
breast-feeding after finishing your treatment. 
Thalidomide causes birth defects and foetal death. When bortezomib is given in combination with 
thalidomide you must follow the pregnancy prevention programme for thalidomide (see package 
leaflet for thalidomide). 
Driving and using machines 
Bortezomib might cause tiredness, dizziness, fainting, or blurred vision. Do not drive or operate tools 
or machines if you experience such side effects; even if you do not, you should still be cautious. 
3.  How to use Bortezomib Hospira 
Your doctor will work out your dose of bortezomib according to your height and weight (body surface 
area). The usual starting dose of bortezomib is 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice a week. 
Your doctor may change the dose and total number of treatment cycles, depending on your response to 
the treatment on the occurrence of certain side effects and on your underlying conditions (e.g. liver 
problems). 
Progressive multiple myeloma 
When bortezomib is given alone, you will receive 4 doses of bortezomib intravenously or 
subcutaneously on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, followed by a 10-day ‘rest period’ without treatment. This 
21-day period (3 weeks) corresponds to one treatment cycle. You might receive up to 8 cycles 
(24 weeks). 
You may also be given bortezomib together with the medicines pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or 
dexamethasone. 
When bortezomib is given together with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, you will receive bortezomib 
intravenously or subcutaneously as a 21-day treatment cycle and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 
30 mg/m2 is given on day 4 of the bortezomib 21-day treatment cycle as an intravenous infusion after 
the bortezomib injection. 
You might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks). 
When bortezomib is given together with dexamethasone, you will receive bortezomib intravenously or 
subcutaneously as a 21-day treatment cycle and dexamethasone 20 mg is given orally on days 
1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12, of the bortezomib, 21-day treatment cycle. 
You might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks). 
Previously untreated multiple myeloma 
If you have not been treated before for multiple myeloma, and you are not suitable for blood stem cell 
transplantation you will receive bortezomib intravenously or subcutaneously together with two other 
medicines; melphalan and prednisone. 
In this case, the duration of a treatment cycle is 42 days (6 weeks). You will receive 9 cycles 
(54 weeks). 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
In cycles 1 to 4, bortezomib is administered twice weekly on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29 and 32. 
In cycles 5 to 9, bortezomib is administered once weekly on days 1, 8, 22 and 29. 
Melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone (60 mg/m2) are both given orally on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the first 
week of each cycle. 
If you have not been treated before for multiple myeloma, and you are suitable for blood stem cell 
transplantation you will receive bortezomib intravenously or subcutaneously together with the 
medicines dexamethasone, or dexamethasone and thalidomide, as induction treatment. 
When bortezomib is given together with dexamethasone, you will receive bortezomib intravenously or

cycle is 28 days (4 weeks). 
Dexamethasone 40 mg is given orally on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the bortezomib 28-day 
treatment cycle and thalidomide is given orally daily at 50 mg up to day 14 of the first cycle, and if 
tolerated the thalidomide dose is increased to 100 mg on days 15-28 and may be further increased to 
200 mg daily from the second cycle onwards. 
You might receive up to 6 cycles (24 weeks). 
Previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma  
If you have not been treated before for mantle cell lymphoma you will receive bortezomib 
intravenously or subcutaneously together with the medicines rituximab, cyclophosphamide,

given orally at 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the bortezomib treatment cycle. 
How Bortezomib Hospira is given 
This medicine is for intravenous or subcutaneous use only. Bortezomib will be administered by a 
health care professional experienced in the use of cytotoxic medicines. 
Bortezomib powder has to be dissolved before administration. This will be done by a healthcare 
professional. The resulting solution is then either injected into a vein or under the skin. Injection into a 
vein is rapid, taking 3 to 5 seconds. Injection under the skin is in either the thighs or the abdomen. 
If you are given too much Bortezomib Hospira 
As this medicine is being given by your doctor or nurse, it is unlikely that you will be given too much. 
In the unlikely event of an overdose, your doctor will monitor you for side effects.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Some of 
these effects may be serious. 
If you are given bortezomib for multiple myeloma or mantle cell lymphoma, tell your doctor straight 
away if you notice any of the following symptoms:  
- 
- 
- 
muscle cramping, muscle weakness 
confusion, visual loss or disturbances, blindness, seizures, headaches 
shortness of breath, swelling of your feet or changes in your heart beat, high blood pressure, 
tiredness, fainting 
coughing and breathing difficulties or tightness in the chest. 
- 
Treatment with bortezomib can very commonly cause a decrease in the numbers of red and white 
blood cells and platelets in your blood. Therefore, you will have to take regular blood tests before and 
during your treatment with bortezomib, to check your blood cell counts regularly. You may experience 
a reduction in the number of:  
- 
platelets, which may make you be more prone to bruising, or to bleeding without obvious injury 
(e.g., bleeding from your bowels, stomach, mouth and gum or bleeding in the brain or bleeding 
from the liver) 
red blood cells, which can cause anaemia, with symptoms such as tiredness and paleness 
white blood cells may make you more prone to infections or flu-like symptoms.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
1. 
RECONSTITUTION FOR INTRAVENOUS INJECTION 
Note: Bortezomib Hospira is a cytotoxic agent. Therefore, caution should be used during handling and 
preparation. Use of gloves and other protective clothing to prevent skin contact is recommended. 
ASEPTIC TECHNIQUE MUST BE STRICTLY OBSERVED THROUGHOUT HANDLING OF 
BORTEZOMIB HOSPIRA SINCE NO PRESERVATIVE IS PRESENT. 
1.1  Preparation of the 1 mg vial: carefully add 1.0 ml of sterile, 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride 
solution for injection to the vial containing the Bortezomib Hospira powder by using a syringe 
of the appropriate size without removing the vial stopper. Dissolution of the lyophilised powder 
is completed in less than 2 minutes. 
Preparation of the 2.5 mg vial: carefully add 2.5 ml of sterile, 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium 
chloride solution for injection to the vial containing the Bortezomib Hospira powder by using a 
syringe of the appropriate size without removing the vial stopper. Dissolution of the lyophilised 
powder is completed in less than 2 minutes. 
Preparation of the 3 mg vial: carefully add 3.0 ml of sterile, 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride 
solution for injection to the vial containing the Bortezomib Hospira powder by using a syringe 
of the appropriate size without removing the vial stopper. Dissolution of the lyophilised powder 
is completed in less than 2 minutes. 
Preparation of the 3.5 mg vial: carefully add 3.5 ml of sterile, 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium 
chloride solution for injection to the vial containing the Bortezomib Hospira powder by using a 
syringe of the appropriate size without removing the vial stopper. Dissolution of the lyophilised 
powder is completed in less than 2 minutes. 
The concentration of the resulting solution will be 1 mg/ml. The solution will be clear and 
colourless, with a final pH of 4 to 7. You do not need to check the pH of the solution. 
1.2  Before administration, visually inspect the solution for particulate matter and discolouration. If 
any discolouration or particulate matter is observed, the solution should be discarded. Confirm 
concentration on vial to ensure that the correct dose is being given for the intravenous route of 
administration (1 mg/ml). 
1.3  The reconstituted solution is preservative free and should be used immediately after preparation. 
However, the chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 8 hours at 5°C 
and 25°C stored in the original vial and/or a syringe. The total storage time for the reconstituted 
medicinal product should not exceed 8 hours prior to administration. If the reconstituted solution 
is not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of 
the user. 
It is not necessary to protect the reconstituted medicinal product from light. 
2. 
ADMINISTRATION 
•  Once dissolved, withdraw the appropriate amount of the reconstituted solution according to 
calculated dose based upon the patient´s Body Surface Area. 
•  Confirm the dose and concentration in the syringe prior to use (check that the syringe is marked as 
intravenous administration). 
69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Inject the solution as a 3-5 second bolus intravenous injection through a peripheral or central 
intravenous catheter into a vein. 
•  Flush the peripheral or intravenous catheter with sterile, 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution. 
Bortezomib Hospira IS FOR SUBCUTANEOUS OR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY. Do not give 
by other routes. Intrathecal administration has resulted in death. 
3. 
DISPOSAL 
A vial is for single use only and the remaining solution must be discarded. 
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

colourless, with a final pH of 4 to 7. You do not need to check the pH of the solution. 
1.2  Before administration, visually inspect the solution for particulate matter and discolouration. If 
any discolouration or particulate matter is observed, the solution should be discarded. Confirm 
concentration on vial to ensure that the correct dose is being given for the subcutaneous route 
of administration (2.5 mg/ml). 
1.3  The reconstituted product is preservative free and should be used immediately after preparation. 
However, the chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 8 hours at 5°C 
and 25°C stored in the original vial and/or a syringe. The total storage time for the reconstituted 
medicinal product should not exceed 8 hours prior to administration. If the reconstituted solution 
is not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of

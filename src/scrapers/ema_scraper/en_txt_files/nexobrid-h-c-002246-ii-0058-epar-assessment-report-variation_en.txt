Extension of current indication for removal of eschar in adults with deep partial- and full-thickness 
thermal burns to the paediatric population for NexoBrid based on interim results from study MW2012-01-
01 (CIDS study), listed as Study MW2012-01-01 is a 3-stage, multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, 
controlled, open label, 2 arm study aiming to demonstrate the superiority of NexoBrid treatment over 
SOC treatment in paediatric patients (aged 0 to 18 years) with deep partial thickness (DPT) and full 
thickness (FT) thermal burns of 1% to 30% of total body surface area (TBSA). 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet 
is updated accordingly. Version 9 of the RMP has also been submitted. 
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0189/2021 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0189/2021 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
This variation concerns an application for extension of the current indication to the paediatric population.  
The therapeutic indication initially claimed by the MAH was: “NexoBrid is indicated in all age groups for 
removal of eschar in patients with deep partial- and full-thickness thermal burns.” 
Assessment report

The initially proposed dose regimen was the same as in adults.  
2.1.2.  About the product 
One vial contains 2 g or 5g of concentrate of proteolytic enzymes enriched in bromelain, corresponding to 
0.09 g/g concentrate of proteolytic enzymes enriched in bromelain after mixing (or 2 g/22 g gel or 5 g / 
55 g gel). 
The proteolytic enzymes are a mixture of enzymes from the stem of Ananas comosus (pineapple plant). 
The mixture of enzymes in this medicinal product dissolves burns wound eschar. The specific components 
responsible for this effect have not been identified. The major constituent is stem bromelain. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Please refer to the section ‘Scientific advice’ above. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH stated that the submitted clinical study MW2012-01-01 was conducted according to ICH GCP 
standards and procedures, and that a GCP audit program was undertaken to ensure compliance with 
these procedures. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
To support this application, a juvenile repeated dose toxicity study was submitted (study 1990-003). The 
findings of this study were compared to those of older studies with single or multiple IV dosing. 
2.2.2.  Toxicology 
The objective of study 1990-003 was to evaluate the potential toxicity and toxicokinetics of the test 
article, Debrase powder (another forerunner product to NexoBrid), after three times weekly intravenous 
administration in juvenile (28 to 36 days of age on Day 1) farm pigs and to evaluate reversibility, 
progression, or delayed appearance of any observed changes following a 14-day post-dose observation 
period. The age of the piglets at treatment start corresponds to a human age of 2 years1. Table 1 
provides an overview on the study design and the relevant results.

For comparison, Table 2 below provides an overview on the study design and major findings of 
intravenous single and repeated dose toxicity studies conducted previously in adolescent/adult minipigs. 
In adult minipigs repeated IV administration of Debrase (another forerunner product to NexoBrid) at 4, 8, 
and 12 mg/kg/d was associated with convulsions only in male at 8 mg/kg/day. Due to decreased activity, 
ataxia, salivation, laboured breathing, and haemorrhage in multiple tissues, no NOEL was established 
(study 20002068).

To further support the extension of the indication in children from birth until adulthood with preclinical 
data, single dose studies with dermal or IV route of administration were conducted in non-weaned 
domestic pigs and minipigs which could be considered juvenile (3 months old).  
Topical application of NexoBrid (0.09 g/g) to young pigs (2 months of age) did not cause any local and 
systemic toxicological relevant findings when applied to burn wounds in a formulation and in a dosage 
regimen relevant for the human use of the product.  
2.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the ‘Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use’ 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/ 4447/00) herbal medicinal products as well as medicinal products with active 
ingredients such as proteins and carbohydrates are exempted from the need to provide information on 
ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
To support this extension of indication, the MAH conducted a juvenile toxicity study (study 1990-003) in a 
species (although not in the same strain) that had been used before in older toxicity studies. This 
facilitates comparison of study results obtained in adolescent/adult with those obtained in juvenile 
animals (28-36 days old at treatment start). Except for convulsions, noted at all dose levels in juvenile 
pigs, the results of the juvenile toxicity study do not differ from those obtained previously in adolescent / 
adult (mini)pigs in single and repeated dose IV studies and exposure data are also in the same range. 
Contrary to the findings in the juvenile study, where convulsions occurred at all dose levels, only a single 
adolescent / adult pig of the mid dose group (8 mg/kg/day) showed convulsion.  
In the juvenile toxicity study (study 1990-003), one male piglet each at 4, 8, and 12 mg/kg/day (1/4, 1/4 
and 1/6, respectively) had convulsions, difficulties to breathe, and developed reddening skin at the time 
of the 5th injection. Some of the animals also had findings that included watery faeces, audible breathing, 
salivation and ataxia. In the females, there were no convulsions or other adverse effects after the 5th 
dose at 4 mg/kg/day. However, at 8 mg/kg/day 1/4 female developed ataxia and difficulty to breathe, 
and at 12 mg/kg/day 1/6 female had a convulsion and developed reddening of the skin during the 
injection, as was seen in the males after the 5th dose.  
Based on the possibility of some type of allergic/anaphylactoid reaction, as none of the control animals 
were affected, a decision was made to pretreat the next stagger set of animals (1/sex/group) with oral 
and intramuscular injections of antihistamines prior to dosing to see if the adverse clinical signs, 
particularly the convulsions and reddened skin, could be averted. The second set of animals receiving a 
5th dose were pretreated with antihistamines; however, all the males showed reddening of the skin as 
before, and one male at 12 mg/kg/day had a convulsion. The females from this second set showed 
decreased activity and ataxia at all dose levels (4, 8, and 12 mg/kg/day). At 4 and 8 mg/kg/day, one

female each also had difficulty to breathe. Reddened skin was seen in one female each at 4 and 12 
mg/kg/day. Based on the continued adverse clinical outcome, the remaining animals in the first two sets 
were not administered any additional injections as originally scheduled. For human reasons, the 
remaining set of animals only received four doses to avoid these adverse effects after the 5th dose. One 
female at 12 mg/kg/day from the last set of animals did show signs of decreased activity, ataxia, 
difficulty to breathe, and reddened skin after the 4th dose on Day 8. In the study report, these clinical 
findings were considered to be test article related. 
As a consequence, a No-Observed-Effect-Level (NOEL) for general toxicity could not be established in the 
juvenile toxicity study due to significant clinical findings following the 5th injection in all treatment groups 
as well as alterations in the coagulation parameters and microscopic findings in the terminal animals. 
It is agreed that the animals were juvenile, but not all non-weaned in the single dose studies with dermal 
or IV route of administration. Although in nature, weaning in pigs is a gradual process that occurs around 
10 to 12 weeks of age, coinciding with the near complete maturation of the gastrointestinal tract, in 
commercial pig production, weaning is abrupt, occurring at around 2 to 4 weeks of age2. As these studies 
were performed in laboratories, pigs should be considered to be weaned. According to Hood1, the age of 3 
months in minipigs corresponds to a 12-year-old child. 
It might be reassuring that convulsions were noted in juvenile pigs only following repeated administration 
keeping in mind that according to SmPC section 4.2 Posology and method of administration a second and 
subsequent application is not recommended in humans. However, prior to final risk assessment on the 
relevance of the convulsions observed in pigs for the use of NexoBrid in children, the MAH was requested 
by CHMP to provide a discussion on this issue taking into account the small number of children treated so 
far, the small amount of PK data available in children as well as the fact that no NOEL was established in 
the juvenile toxicity study and consequently the exposure at the NOEL is unknown. The MAH has provided 
a discussion on convulsions observed in pigs and the reason for lack of study results. The reason for 
missing data was explained by sopping of dosing of animals which suffered from severe adverse effects. 
Therefore, a final analysis was not performed. This is understood and acceptable. Regarding convulsions, 
the mechanism and reasons for these convulsions is still not clear and human relevance cannot be fully 
excluded. However, it was discussed that convulsion occurred after repeated i.v injections, while NexoBrid 
is used topically and just once for 4 hours. It can therefore reasonably be assumed that exposure of 
patients is significantly lower than exposure of pigs in the juvenile study, despite the lack of TK data. 
Based on these considerations and the lack of clinical correlates in paediatric patients thus far, 
convulsions observed in pigs are considered to be of minor relevance for patients. In addition, these 
findings were adequately included in section 5.3. of the SmPC. 
Topical application of NexoBrid (0.09 g/g) to young pigs (2 months of age) did not cause any local and 
systemic toxicological relevant findings when applied to burn wounds in a formulation and in a dosage 
regimen relevant for the human use of the product. This information has been adequately added to SmPC 
section 5.3.  
The trend of increasing QT and QTc intervals obtained on Day 10 post-dose in treated piglets were not 
judged treatment-induced but were considered to be due to the substantial clinical signs (e.g., 
convulsions) following the 5th dose. Those findings were included in SmPC section 5.3. Furthermore, study 
2010-03-02 (DETECT) included an evaluation of QT prolongation and no signal was identified.  
Test article-related effects were observed in the coagulation parameters of all treated groups (4, 8, 12 
mg/kg/day) showing dose responsive prolongation of APTT and PT, as well as decreases in fibrinogen

levels. The changes in the coagulation parameters were generally more important on Day 8, in 
comparison to Day 1, suggesting a cumulative effect.  
At necropsy, possible test article-related findings were limited to sporadic haemorrhages in several 
tissues noted macro- and microscopically in terminal animals. These changes were not seen in recovery 
animals, indicating a reversible effect. The haemorrhagic events may be correlated to the changes in the 
coagulation parameters observed (prolongation of PT and APTT and decrease in fibrinogen). 
Phase 3 2010-03-02 (DETECT) study included assessment of coagulation (PTT/INR) and no signal was 
identified. 
A warning on Coagulopathy is already included in the SmPC section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions 
for use. 
The toxicokinetic investigations confirmed dose responsive exposure to Debrase (another forerunner 
product to NexoBrid) following intravenous administration at 4, 8, and 12 mg/kg/day in both male and 
female piglets on Days 1 and 8. Mean Cmax and AUClast were comparable for males and females at each 
dosage, indicating gender independence for both parameters, with similar half-lives on each day of 
evaluation. Debrase was detected in treated animals up to 24 hours after injection. At this time point, the 
mean values were slightly higher on Day 8 as compared to the first day of dosing (Day 1). Exposure 
levels at the lowest dose tested were well above those obtained in pharmacokinetic investigations in 
children following a single administration of NexoBrid. However, as no NOEL could be established in the 
repeated dose toxicity study in juvenile pigs, the exospore at the NOEL is unknown.  
2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
To support this extension of indication in the paediatric population, the results of a juvenile repeated IV 
dose toxicity study covering children of 2 years of age were submitted. Except for convulsions, noted at 
all dose levels in juvenile pigs, the results of the juvenile toxicity study do not differ from those obtained 
previously in adolescent / adult (mini)pigs in single and repeated dose IV studies and even exposure data 
are in the same range. Contrary to the findings in the juvenile toxicity study, in adolescent / adult 
minipigs, convulsion was limited to a single male in the mid dose group. Given that convulsion occurred 
after repeated i.v injections and taking into account that patients receive NexoBrid topically and just one 
application for 4 hours, it can reasonably be concluded that exposure of patients is significantly lower 
than exposure of pigs in the juvenile study, despite the lack of TK data. Based on the above 
considerations and the lack of clinical correlates in paediatric patients thus far, convulsions observed in 
pigs are considered to be of minor relevance for patients. Topical application of NexoBrid (0.09 g/g) to 
young pigs (2 months of age) did not cause any local and systemic toxicological relevant findings when 
applied to burn wounds in a formulation and in a dosage regimen relevant for the human use of the 
product. In addition, these findings were adequately included in section 5.3. of the SmPC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Substudy on Pharmacokinetics in the paediatric population  
This substudy was integrated in the submitted study (interim report) MW2012-01-01. PK blood samples 
were collected from 16 out of 72 NexoBrid treated patients (of the 145 patients randomised in the study). 
All 16 patients received a single dose (and PK samples were not available from the one patient who was 
treated with a second application). Blood samples from patients weighing over 35 kg at screening were 
taken at pre-treatment (time 0) and at 2, 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after start of treatment. For some 
patients, not all time points were collected. In protocol version 9.0 (26 August 2019), a sparse sampling 
approach was implemented for patients >7 kg and <35 kg at screening. These patients were split 
between the 2 sub-groups (A and B). The 'A' sub-group had blood samples taken at 2 and 12 hours while 
the 'B' subgroup had blood samples taken at 4 and 24 hours post treatment. Due to the timing of the 
protocol amendment, this only applied to 2 patients (<2 years of age). 
In addition to the main analysis that used valid samples (n=10), there were an additional 6 patients with 
PK samples analysed outside of the stability period for long term storage in an exploratory analysis. The 
ECL assay used in this analysis as well as the analytical site (Q2 Solutions, Marrietta, GA, USA) were the 
same as described in trial MW2008-09-03 (assessed in EMA-procedure EMEA/H/C/002246/II/0023). 
PK analysis was performed for NexoBrid serum concentration versus time data using standard non-
compartmental methods. PK outcome parameters included:  
Tmax: Time at which the maximum concentration was observed. 
Cmax: Maximum observed concentration. 
Cmax/D: Dose normalised Cmax.

AUClast: Area under the concentration-time curve from the start of dose administration to the last 
quantifiable point within the dosing day, using the trapezoidal rule.  
AUClast/D: Dose normalised AUClast. 
AUC0-4: Area under the concentration-time curve from the start of dose administration to 4 hours after 
dosing (end of treatment) within the dosing day, using the trapezoidal rule.  
AUC0-4/D: Dose normalised AUC0-4. 
AUC0-24: AUC from time zero to time 24 hours post dose administration. 
AUC0-24/D Dose normalised AUC0-24: 
All values reported as below the LLOQ were set equal to zero for descriptive statistics and for PK analysis. 
Nominal sample times and nominal dose values were used in the PK calculations (nominal dose values 
were calculated based on wound area treated and not based on actual reported dose; dose was calculated 
as 2 g NexoBrid/180 cm2 of wound area).  
Patients with less than 3 consecutive quantifiable concentrations were included in the concentration tables 
only and were excluded from the PK analysis. Phoenix WinNonlin (version 8.3) was used to estimate all 
PK parameters using the non-compartmental analysis tool following the Linear Trapezoidal Linear 
Interpolation calculation method. For the 2 patients with sparse sampling, their values were merged to 
create a composite PK profile (resulting in one PK profile for patients < 2 years of age). 
Peak plasma concentrations post-dose (Cmax) and the corresponding Tmax were determined by direct 
assessment (no calculations) of the concentration versus time data. All AUC calculations were performed 
using the linear trapezoidal rule. For the calculation of partial areas (e.g. AUC0-4), if the plasma 
concentration value at the last nominal hour post-dose time point of the desired interval was missing but 
was followed by at least one measurable concentration at a later time point, the partial area was 
calculated using linear interpolation. However, if no measurable concentration was available beyond the 
missing value to define the partial area interval (e.g. post the 4-hour value is missing and there are no 
more values beyond that for an AUC0-4 partial area), a partial area was not calculated. Due to limited 
data, λz could not be assessed for a majority of the patients; as such half-life, AUC from time zero to 
infinity (AUCINF), total body clearance, and the volume of distribution were not reported. A correlation 
analysis of the NexoBrid dose applied and AUC0-4 values was performed in WinNonlin using a Least 
Squares Regression Model (Linear Regression) to obtain a r value. Using a non-validated version of 
GraphPad Prism (Version 9.3.1), the same data set was used in a correlation analysis to obtain the 
Pearson r value and a two-tailed p-value. 
Summary statistics (i.e. N, arithmetic mean, median, SD, CV%, minimum, and maximum) were 
calculated for plasma concentrations for each nominal time point and separated by age group. All 
concentration and descriptive statistic values were reported to 3 significant figures. Summary statistics 
(i.e. N, arithmetic mean, median, SD, CV%, minimum, maximum, geometric mean, and geometric mean 
CV%, confidence interval [CI] 90% lower mean and CI 90% upper mean) were presented for all PK 
parameters and separated by age group. All PK parameters and descriptive statistic values are reported 
to 3 significant figures, except for individual Tmax values which are reported to 2 significant figures. An 
evaluation of Cmax and AUC with respect to age group and dose applied was performed. 
Main Analysis 
PK data were collected from 11 patients, all received a single application of NexoBrid; data from patients 
with less than 3 consecutive quantifiable concentrations were excluded. In addition, data from one patient 
included outliers and this patient was not included in further analysis. Descriptive statistics were therefore 
calculated using PK data from 10 patients (Table 3). This included 2 patients who were less than 2 years

of age (which were used to make a single composite PK profile), 5 evaluable patients aged 4 to 11 years, 
and 3 patients aged 12 to 18 years. PK data were not available from patients < 20 months and aged 2 to 
3 years. 
There were only 10 PK profiles available in the paediatric PK study. The treated TW area ranged from 4 to 
11% TBSA (5.3% in the one profile ~2 years of age), up to 9% in children 4-11 years and up to 11% 
TBSA in the age group 12-18 years; the overall mean was 6.31% TBSA. 
The median Tmax values were 4.0 hours in the full PK profile patients (4 to 18 years) and 2 hours in the 
composite profile (<2 years). The arithmetic mean Cmax ±SD values were 200, 205±169, and 180±114 
ng/mL in the <2, 4 to 11 and 12 to 18 age groups, respectively. Normalising for estimated dose applied 
(g NexoBrid), the mean dose normalised Cmax ± SD values were 66.7, 32.8±23.9, and 19.2±7.50 
ng/mL/g, respectively. 
To allow for comparison between paediatric and adult burn patients treated with NexoBrid, partial areas 
(AUC0-4) were calculated consistently with study MW2010-03-02. The arithmetic mean AUC0-4 (time of 
treatment) ± SD values were 476, 416±259 and 499±315 h·ng/mL in the <2, 4 to 11 and 12- to 18-year 
age groups, respectively, while the mean dose normalised values were 159, 67.9±44.7 and 53.3±20.4 
h·ng/mL/g, respectively. The arithmetic mean AUC0-24 ± SD values were 1020, 1850±1510, 1560±887 
h·ng/mL in the <2, 4 to 11, and 12- to 18-year age groups, respectively, with mean dose normalised 
values of 340, 308±252 and 174±67.4 h·ng/mL/g, respectively. The arithmetic mean AUClast ± SD values 
were 876, 2240±2220, and 1560±887 h·ng/mL in the <2, 4 to 11, and 12- to 18-year age groups 
respectively, with mean dose normalised values of 292, 366±350 and 174±67.4 h·ng/mL/g, respectively. 
When normalised for the dose applied (treatment area), the AUC values were within 2-fold between age 
groups. 
Table 3: Summary Serum Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Topical Administration of NexoBrid (Main 
Analysis) 
Values are reported as Mean ± SD, which the exception of Tmax, which is reported as Median (Min-Max). The <2 year 
age group is a composite profile (n=2); 4-11 year old group represents n=5 and 12-18 year old group represents n=3.  
The interindividual variability was very high, which can be seen e.g. in the Cmax/dose and Cmax/TBSA 
ranges. In the adult study, values for Cmax/dose ranged from 5.19 to 40.9 ng/mL/g (a factor of almost 8); 
in the CIDS study, the range was from 9.18 to 66.7 ng/mL/g (a factor of 7). Values for Cmax/TBSA ranged 
from 10.23 to 88.80 ng/mL/%TBSA in adults (a factor of almost 9) vs. 9.68 to 68.86 ng/mL/%TBSA (a 
factor of 7) in the CIDS study.  
Correlation analyses showed that in the CIDS study there were no correlations between Cmax and the 
treated TW area (in %TBSA) nor between AUC and %TBSA. However, there was a correlation between 
age and Cmax/dose (p-value 0.0765) and between age and AUC0-4/dose (p-value 0.0796).  
Assessment report

The r value for the relationship between Cmax and dose applied was 0.3349, with a p-value of 0.3783, 
indicating a lack of correlation. The r value for the relationship between AUC0-4 and the dose applied was 
0.5926, with a p-value of 0.0926, indicating no correlation. 
When systemic exposure was normalised for the dose applied (treatment area), the AUC values 
decreased with age (but remained within 2-fold between age groups).  
Since less than a third of the patients had sufficient data (as defined in the PK analysis plan) to reliably 
determine λz, additional disposition parameters (e.g. terminal half-life and AUCINF) were not reported. 
Due to the high interindividual variability (e.g. ~factor 7 between lowest and highest Cmax/dose), 
conclusions regarding differences in PK profiles between age groups are difficult to make.

Exploratory Analysis 
There were 6 patients (3 4 to 11-years of age and 3 12- to 18-years) whose serum samples were 
analysed outside of the stability window for the analytical assay. The PK analysis of those samples was 
therefore exploratory only. Evidence of systemic plasma exposure was observed in all patients (Table 4). 
The median Tmax values were 2.0 and 4.0 hours in the 4 - 11 and 12 - 18-year age groups, respectively.  
The arithmetic mean Cmax (±SD) values were 170±103 and 774±866 ng/mL in the 4 to 11 and 12- to 18-
year age groups, respectively, and normalising for estimated dose applied (NexoBrid, g), the mean dose 
normalised Cmax values were 29.5±27.9 and 53.7±39.5 ng/mL/g, respectively. The arithmetic mean 
AUC0-4 values were 525±351 and 2260±2600 h·ng/mL (mean ± SD) in the 4 to 11 and 12 to 18-year age 
groups, respectively, while the mean dose normalised AUC0-4 values were 92.6±91.4 and 157±118 
h·ng/mL/g. The arithmetic mean AUC0-24 values were 2000±1890 and 9700±11900 h·ng/mL in the 4 to 
11 and 12- to 18-year age groups, respectively, while the mean dose normalised values were 379±436 
and 558±353 h·ng/mL/g. The arithmetic mean AUClast values were 2370±2630 and 11900±14500 
h·ng/mL in the 4 to 11 and 12- to 18-year age groups, respectively, while the mean dose normalised 
values were 463±587 and 629±369 h·ng/mL/g. 
There was a positive correlation/relationship between serum Cmax and AUC0-4 values and the dose applied, 
suggesting a dose or treatment area dependent increase in exposure. The r value for the relationship 
between Cmax and dose applied was 0.7227, with a p-value of 0.1047, indicating a lack of significant

correlation. The r value for the relationship between AUC0-4 and the dose applied was 0.7053, with a p-
value of 0.1175, indicating a lack of significant correlation. 
Systemic exposure between the age groups increased with age, concurrent with increased treatment 
area. However, when normalised for the dose applied (treatment area), the AUC values remained within 
2-fold between age groups, suggesting no significant age-related differences in exposure.

Analyses across studies 
The paediatric PK data from the CIDS sub-study were compared to adult PK data.  
Since the PK study MW2008-09-03 contained adult PK data plus paediatric PK data, a meaningful 
comparison of PK data (paediatric vs. adult) was only possible with the data from the paediatric CIDS PK 
sub-study (MW2012-01-01) and from the adult PK sub-study MW2010-03-02.  
The administered dose per skin wound area (cm2) in the paediatric population was the same as in adults 
(i.e. the gel has the same concentration and the amount applied per cm2 is also the same).

aThe <2 years age group is a composite profile of samples collected from 2 patients.  
b PK samples were available for 5 patients in the age 4 to 11 years group.  
c PK samples were available for 3 patients in the age 12 to 18 years age group. 
Comparability of these two studies is corroborated by the fact, that for the oldest subgroup of paediatric 
patients (12-18 years of age in MW2012-01-01 PK sub-study) after administration of a mean dose of 12.2 
g, mean Cmax was 180 ng/mL, compared to adult Cmax of 200 ng/mL (after the same mean dose of 12.2 g 
in MW 2010 PK sub-study).  
In the adult PK-study there was a statistically significant correlation between serum Cmax or AUC0-4 values 
and dose or %TBSA, suggesting a dose or treatment area dependent increase in exposure. The same 
trend was observed in the CIDS study, although not statistically significant (likely due to the smaller 
sample size). Analysis of samples by wound depth (all TWs mixed depth [DPT and FT, MIXED], and all 
TWs DPT [ALL DPT]), comparison of the dose-normalised serum Cmax and AUC0-4 values suggest that the 
depth of the NexoBrid treated-wound has no significant impact on systemic exposure.  
Overall, the PK profile of the age groups 4-11 and 12-18 years of age from the paediatric study was very 
similar to the PK profile of the adults in study MW 2010-03-02. Tmax at 4 hours in both populations, Cmax 
180 vs. 200ng/mL (adolescents vs. adults), Cmax/dose: 19.2 vs. 16.4 ng/mL/g (adolescents vs. adults), 
AUC0-4/dose 53.3 vs. 39.8 ng/mL/g (adolescents vs. adults) and AUC0-24/dose 174 vs. 178 ng/mL/g.  
However, there was a correlation between age and Cmax/dose (p-value 0.0765) and between age and 
AUC0-4/dose (p-value 0.0796). The dose normalised Cmax values e.g. were higher in the age groups < 12 
years of age (paediatric vs. adults: 67 ng/mL/g [0-2 years] and 32 ng/mL/g [4-11 years] vs. 16.4 
ng/mL/g in adults). When normalised for the dose applied (treatment area), the exposure values 
increased with lower age.

age groups and adults 
In general, in the DETECT study, mean elimination half-life values ranged between 12 and 17 hours, 
supporting low presence of NexoBrid in serum 72 hours post treatment. In CIDS, less than a third of the 
patients had sufficient data to reliably determine λz.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Immunogenicity sub-study within MW 2012-01-01 
The ADA (anti-drug antibody) evaluable population for study MW2012-01-01 comprised a total of 17/69 
patients treated with NexoBrid. Samples were scheduled to be collected at multiple time points to enable 
the time-course and maximal extent of the treatment-emergent ADA response - relative to the pre-
treatment levels - following treatment with NexoBrid. According to the MAH, a highly sensitive assay was 
used to detect antibodies reactive with NexoBrid. Evaluation of PK was included as an exploratory 
endpoint, to assess the relationship of ADA signals to the concentration of NexoBrid measured in the 
systemic circulation. The relationship of pre- and post-treatment levels of ADA to efficacy (time to eschar 
removal) and incidence and severity of hypersensitivity reactions were also assessed. The CIDS protocol 
specified that blood samples for ADA testing would be collected only from patients with a body weight of 
over 18 kg at the screening visit. ADA samples were actually collected from 19 patients, with a total of 69 
samples tested in the ADA screening assay. Out of these, 5 patients (29.4%) had an ADA positive result 
pre-treatment, and 14/17 patients (82.4%) had either treatment-induced or treatment-boosted ADA 
positive status. For these patients the time of onset occurred relatively soon after NexoBrid 
administration, with 13/15 patients (86.7%) with ADA results available at Week 4 having a positive ADA 
result (Table 8).

Population)

At 24-months, 6/6 patients (100%) were ADA positive, indicating persistence of the treatment-emergent 
ADA response. There was a trend for higher post-treatment ADA titres in ADA positive-patients at 
baseline. Patients with highest baseline ADA titres had dose-adjusted Cmax values that fell within the 
range of dose-adjusted Cmax values observed for ADA negative patients (assigned as ADA titre=1) at 
baseline. There was no statistically significant difference in time to eschar removal between ADA positive 
patients at baseline vs. ADA negative at baseline (unpaired t-test, p=0.3539).  
As expected, there was no influence of maximal post-treatment ADA titre on time to eschar removal. The 
ADA report focused on describing the relationship between incidence of adverse events (AEs) related to 
hypersensitivity and allergic reactions and ADA positive versus negative status at baseline and maximal 
ADA titre post-treatment. AEs related to hypersensitivity and allergic reactions refer to the following 
Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Queries: Anaphylactic reaction, 
Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid shock conditions, Hypersensitivity, Angioedema, Periorbital and eyelid 
disorders, Shock-associated circulatory or cardiac conditions (excluding torsade de pointes), Eosinophilic 
pneumonia and AEs in the MedDRA System Organ Class of Immune Disorders.  
The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions, including allergic reactions and cases of rash, was 
approximately 5% (4/69) of NexoBrid treated patients; 2/69 were considered related. All were mild or 
moderate in intensity. No cases of anaphylaxis were reported. The only hypersensitivity AEs that occurred 
within 1 day after study treatment were 4 cases of pruritus treated with antihistamines, and one case of 
local rash treated with topical hydrocortisone. However, pruritus is a common symptom in patients with 
burns and 3 out of these 4 pruritus cases were assessed by the investigators as not related to NexoBrid. 
Overall, the detection of only 2 possibly/probably treatment-related local hypersensitivity reactions (local 
rash and local pruritus) of mild intensity does not suggest a relationship between pre- or post-treatment 
ADA status or titre and antibody-mediated AEs. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
PK substudy 
Exploratory PK analyses were performed in a subset of patients who participated in study MW2012-01-01. 
The substudy included PK blood samples collected from 16/72 NexoBrid treated patients. For the main 
analysis valid samples from only 10 patients were available (one combined PK profile for subjects < 2 
years of age and no PK profile for the age group 2-3 years of age). Additional PK samples (from 6 
patients), which were outside the stability period for long term storage were analysed in an additional 
ancillary analysis.  
The ECL assay used in this analysis as well as the analytical site (Q2 Solutions, Marrietta, GA, USA) were 
the same as described in trial MW2008-09-03 which was assessed in EMA-procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002246/II/0023. In this procedure the methods were assessed as being acceptable.  
The adult PK data from MW2008-09-03 are not comparable with the data from the paediatric CIDS PK-
sub-study (e.g. four times higher Cmax values). A meaningful comparison of adult PK data with paediatric 
PK data is therefore only possible with the DETECT data and the CIDS data (see discussion below). 
Evidence of systemic serum exposure was observed in all paediatric patients. Concentrations increased 
relatively rapidly, with median Tmax values between 2 to 4 hours, comparable with adult PK data (median 
Tmax: 4.0 hours).  
The majority of the patients had no quantifiable concentrations after 48 hours, and no quantifiable 
concentrations were observed in any patient at 72 hours. Since less than a third of the patients had 
sufficient data to determine λz, additional parameters (e.g. terminal half-life and AUCINF) could not be 
reliably determined. 
Assessment report 
EMA/560965/2023 
Page 21/87 
 
 
 
 
The administered dose per skin wound area (cm2) in the paediatric population is the same as in adults 
(i.e. the gel has the same concentration and the amount applied per cm2 is also the same). The paediatric 
subjects <12 years of age, in the PK substudy were treated with smaller amounts of NexoBrid (compared 
to adults): 3 g in p. < 2 years of age, 6.9 g in p. 4-11 years, 12.2 g in p. 12-18 years compared to 12.2 g 
in adults. 
Systemic exposure was correlated to the dose. In the main analysis - when normalised for the dose 
applied - the exposure values increased with lower age (<12 years). 
Overall, the PK profile of the age groups 4-11 and 12-18 years of age from the paediatric study was very 
similar to the PK profile of the adults in study MW 2010-03-02. Exposure results for Cmax and AUC were 
comparable between adults and older children (Cmax in adults [DETECT]: 200 ± 184 ng/mL vs. Cmax in 
children [CIDS]: 180±114 [12-18 years of age], 205±169 [4-11 years of age]) and 200 ng/mL [<2 years 
of age]. The absolute AUC0-4 values in the paediatric patients were lower than in adults (AUC0-4 in adults 
[DETECT]: 516±546 h·ng/mL vs. AUC0-4 in children [CIDS]: 499±315 [12-18 years of age], 416±259 [4-
11 years of age] and 476 h·ng/mL [<2 years of age]).  
However, there was a correlation between age and Cmax/dose (p-value 0.0765) and between age and 
AUC0-4/dose (p-value 0.0796). There were higher Cmax/dose values and higher AUC 0-4/dose values in the 
younger children as compared to older children/adolescents and adults. Why this correlation was not also 
shown for age by Cmax/%TBSA (nor between age by AUC/%TBSA) remains unclear, but it might be 
related to the small numbers of paediatric PK-profiles. 
There is no PK data in children at the age group of 0-12 months and also no PK data in children at the 
age group for 2-3 years available. It is acknowledged that collection of blood samples for PK in paediatric 
patients with severe burns is problematic. Furthermore, the lack of PK data does not prevent approval as 
the safety data for these age groups do not indicate an increased safety risk, which is reassuring. 
Due to the high interindividual variability (~factor 7 between lowest and highest Cmax/dose e.g.), 
conclusions regarding differences in PK profiles between adults and the paediatric population are difficult 
to make.  
Therefore, the decision on safe use in the different paediatric age groups must not only be based on the 
scarce PK profiles and the comparison of PK data between adults and children. The assessment of the 
TEAEs in the pooled paediatric study data, especially the comparison between age groups and the dose 
subgroups must be taken into consideration as well.  
Based on the limited PK and safety results, children 0-3 years of age can be safely treated up to 10% 
TBSA and children over 4 years of age can be safely treated up to 15% TBSA. The section 4.2 Posology of 
the SmPC (subsection ‘Paediatric population’) has been updated accordingly. See discussion on clinical 
safety. 
A summary of paediatric PK data (from the Main Analysis) was incorporated in section 5.2 
Pharmacokinetic properties of the SmPC (subsection ‘Paediatric population’), which is considered 
acceptable. In addition, upon CHMP’s request, the MAH agreed to only retain PK data from study MW2010 
and to remove the PK data from study MW2008 which are considered to be less reliable when compared 
to data from PK sub-study MW2012.  
Immunogenicity substudy 
A total of 17 of the 69 patients treated with NexoBrid in study MW2012-01-01 comprised the subset for 
the Immunogenicity substudy. In the protocol for MW2012-01-01 subjects with a history of allergy and/or 
known sensitivity to pineapples, papaya, bromelain, or papain were excluded. 
Assessment report 
EMA/560965/2023 
Page 22/87 
 
 
 
 
The outcomes in this substudy were comparable to the immunogenicity substudy in MW2010-03-02, 
which was assessed in procedures EMEA/H/C/002246/II/0049 and EMEA/H/C/002246/II/0057. 
The ADA-positive status or the ADA-titers did not influence clinical efficacy nor were they related to 
(severe) hypersensitivity reactions. ADA status or titers were not discriminatory to detect clinically 
relevant sensitisation or to predict hypersensitivity reactions. No conclusions can therefore be drawn 
regarding correlation between positive ADA-antibody status (or high titer values) and clinically relevant 
sensitisation or symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions. 
The clinical relevance of the ADA test is therefore considered as insignificant. 
Since currently there is no specific immunogenicity test commercially available with a sufficiently good 
positive predictive value for occurrence of allergic reactions to bromelaine, and specific IgE antibody 
levels are not seen as reliable in predicting clinical symptoms by clinical experts, hypersensitivity 
adverse-reaction–monitoring is viewed as the most reliable method for assessing the risk of allergic / 
anaphylactic reactions. Pre-screening of patients for antigen-specific IgE is considered unnecessary due to 
the observed low clinical relevance. 
In this clinical study AEs in two patients that occurred within one day after treatment (local rash and local 
pruritus, both of mild intensity) were assessed as possibly/probably related to NexoBrid. Only one of 
these subjects had available ADA results, and was negative for ADA at pre-dose. The proportion of 
NexoBrid-treated subjects with ADA results however was low (24.6%). 
No cases of anaphylaxis were reported in clinical studies, and the frequency of serious allergic reactions is 
based on post-marketing data; therefore, the frequency of serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis 
in the EU SmPC section 4.8 is labelled as “not known”. 
The  MAH’s  proposal  to  omit  ‘rosiglitazone’  since  it  was  withdrawn  from  the  market  and  ‘sorafenib’  since 
there are no records in literature that sorafenib is a substrate for CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 from SmPC section 
4.5 was agreed by the CHMP. The patient leaflet was updated accordingly.  
No interaction studies have been performed in children/adolescents, which is agreed. This information has 
been adequately added to SmPC section 4.5.  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Exploratory pharmacokinetic analyses were performed in a PK sub-study of study MW2012. PK blood 
samples were collected from 16 patients treated with a single application of Nexobrid. Summary of 
paediatric PK data was incorporated in section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties of the SmPC (subsection 
‘Paediatric population’). 
Based on the (limited) PK and safety results, children 0-3 years of age can be safely treated up to 10% 
TBSA and children over 4 years of age can be safely treated up to 15% TBSA. The section 4.2 Posology of 
the SmPC (subsection ‘Paediatric population’) has been updated accordingly. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Paediatric study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS) - a multicenter, multinational, randomised, controlled, open label 
study, performed in children with thermal burns, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NexoBrid as 
compared to Standard of Care (SOC) treatment.  
Assessment report 
EMA/560965/2023 
Page 23/87 
 
 
 
 
Methods 
A 3-stage, multi-center, multi-national, randomised, controlled, open label, 2-arm, superiority efficacy 
and safety study. 
Study participants 
Hospitalised paediatric burn victims with DPT and/or FT thermal burns who met the entry criteria below. A 
total of 145 patients from 36 sites were enrolled, stratified, and randomised 1:1 to NexoBrid or SOC  
1.  
Stage I: Males and females between 4 years to 18 years of age, 
Stage II (upon DSMB review): Males and females between 1 year to 18 years of age,  
Stage III (upon DSMB review): Males and females between 0 years to 18 years of age,  
2. Thermal burns caused by fire/flame, scalds or contact,  
3. Patient total burns area ≥ 1% DPT and/or FT, 
4. Patient total burns area were ≤ 30% TBSA; SPT, DPT and/or FT in depth, 
5. Signed written informed consent by a legal guardian obtained within 84 hours of the burn injury. 
Treatments 
1.  2 or 5 g of NexoBrid sterile powder mixed in 20 or 50 g of sterile Gel Vehicle (ratio of 1:10), to obtain 
sterile NexoBrid gel (also referred to as NexoBrid). The gel was applied to the burn wound at a dose 
of 2 g NexoBrid sterile powder mixed with 20 g sterile Gel Vehicle per 180 cm2 for 4 hours. The 
NexoBrid powder and the Gel Vehicle were mixed at the patient’s bedside ≤15 minutes prior to use. 
NexoBrid was not applied to more than 15% TBSA in 1 session. 
Prior to the treatment of the first patient at the participating study centres, all investigators and study 
site staff were trained on the proper application and removal procedures for NexoBrid. 
2.  SOC included surgical and/or nonsurgical eschar removal procedures. Surgical procedures included 
tangential, minor, avulsion, Versajet, and dermabrasion excisions. Nonsurgical procedures included 
the application of antimicrobial solutions (e.g. Dakin’s Solution and Sulpha-Nystatin Solution), 
ointments/creams (e.g. Bacitracin, Polysporin, and Silvadene), and/or silver dressings (e.g. Mepilex 
Ag, Aquacel Ag, and Acticoat). The need for either nonsurgical or surgical procedures or both was 
determined by the burn specialists and could have been repeated as needed until complete 
debridement.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The co-primary and secondary endpoints in the CIDS study are displayed in Table 9 below. 
Table 9: Main study endpoints 
Sample size 
In accordance with the European regulatory requests and planned age distribution, originally a sample 
size of 80 patients per group was selected to detect with a 90% power a difference on each of the 
primary endpoints based on the results from the previous study. 
However, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected all study sites’ ability to enrol additional patients. 
There was a great uncertainty when restrictions would be lifted and study sites would be able to resume 
enrolment. Therefore, the MAH updated the sample size calculation taking into account the recently 
completed 12 month follow up of the phase 3 study MW2010-03-02 (DETECT, with 175 adult patients 
randomised). Power calculations were updated also using data from this latest phase 3 study.  
Actual age distribution in the CIDS study was as follows (NexoBrid vs. SOC): 0-11 months 4 vs. 4, 12-23 
months 19 vs. 18, 24 months–3 years: 15 vs. 15, 4-11 y. 25 vs. 25 and 12-18 years: 9 vs. 11. 
Time to Complete Eschar Removal (estimate based on study MW2010-03-02)  
Since the proportional hazards assumption was rejected in study MW2010-03-02 trial, the sample size 
calculation based in the CIDS study assumed this also to be the case here, and that a generalised 
Wilcoxon-Gehan test should be used in the analysis. Based on the data from MW2010-03-02, simulations 
were conducted, resulting in a total sample size of 94 (47 per group) to achieve a power of 90%. The 
updated sample size calculation confirmed that with a sample size of 145 patients, the study should be 
sufficiently powered to meet the primary and main secondary and safety endpoints as originally planned.  
The enrolment of patients into the study was completed with a total of 145 patients (age distribution: 45 
patients ≥0 months and ≤23 months, 30 patients ≥24 months and ≤3 years, 50 patients ≥4 years and ≤11 
years and 20 patients ≥12 years and <18 years). 
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were stratified into different groups in order to balance the treatment groups with 
respect to factors that may be related to efficacy and safety outcomes. Four factors were used to stratify 
the subjects. 
A. Age group: A1: 0 to 23 month, A2: 24 months to 3 years, A3: 4 to 11 years, A4: 12 to 18 years, 
Assessment report 
EMA/560965/2023 
Page 25/87 
 
 
 
 
 
B. Overall total area of burns measured by % of TBSA: B1: (1% to 15%), inclusive, B2: (> 15% to ≤ 
30%), 
C. The proportion of the FT area out of the total burned area of a patient: C1: < 20% of the burned area 
defined as FT, C2: ≥ 20% of the burned area defined as FT, 
D. Clinical centre, to address possible differences in SOC procedures between sites (if any), to allow 
comparison of the results within centre and to reduce the likelihood of a centre including patients in only 
one arm of the study. D1, D2,…, Dm (m being the number of participating clinical centres). 
Following the stratification, patients were randomised (as per their stratification group) in a 1:1 ratio 
(NexoBrid : SOC).  
Treatment allocation was performed using the method of minimisation (Pocock and Simon, 1975; White 
and Freedman, 1978) with stratification by the factors A, B, C and D: age group, overall % TBSA, % 
TBSA of all TW wounds, overall % of FT area, and clinical centre. Randomisation was conducted using an 
interactive web-based response system. 
Blinding (masking) 
Study treatment randomisation was not blinded in this study due to the visual differences between 
NexoBrid and surgical and non-surgical SOC. Eschar removal and wound closure assessments were not 
blinded assessments.  
Cosmesis, Function and QOL were assessed by an assessor blinded to the original treatment arm at 6 and 
12 weeks from reaching complete wound closure and at 6, 12, 18, 24, and ≥30 months from reaching 
complete wound closure. 
Statistical methods 
A hierarchical testing procedure for the primary endpoints was used, in which Timely Eschar Removal was 
tested first using a two-tailed superiority test at the significance level of 0.05 and then - if the effect was 
statistically significant - % wound area excised was tested. If the effect on both was statistically 
significant, then scar assessment by MVSS was tested using a one-tailed non-inferiority test at the 
significance level of 0.025. The outcome of the trial was to be declared successful only if all three 
endpoints reached the significance levels mentioned.  
Time to complete eschar removal 
Time until complete eschar removal refers to all TWs (time from randomisation in days). Kaplan-Meier 
curves were to be presented to display the distribution under the two treatments (using the FAS). Median 
time to complete eschar removal was to be estimated for each treatment group with a 95% confidence 
interval. The treatment groups were compared using a Cox regression model. The comparison should be 
adjusted for centre, age, %TBSA, proportion of the FT area of a patient and number of TWs (1,2,3-4, ≥5) 
by including each of them in the Cox regression model together with the treatment variable (NexoBrid vs. 
SOC). The treatment groups were to be compared by testing the null hypothesis of no difference, 
comparing the ratio of the estimated treatment coefficient to its standard error to a standard normal 
distribution. The Cox Regression analysis was to be performed, if the proportional hazards assumption 
appeared to hold. This was to be checked by including in the regression model a variable representing the 
interaction between time since randomisation and treatment group. This coefficient should be tested to be 
non-zero. Additionally, a log likelihood test comparing the model fit of a model with time dependent 
factors with a model with constant factors should be computed. The proportionality assumption was to be 
rejected if one of these tests yielded a significant result at the 10% level. If both tests produced non-
Assessment report 
EMA/560965/2023 
Page 26/87 
 
 
 
 
significant results, then the time-treatment group interaction should be significant, then a generalised 
Wilcoxon-Gehan test was to be used.  
Supportive analyses included adjustment for other baseline variables that were imbalanced, and 
investigating interactions between baseline variables and the treatment groups. The comparison between 
treatments using Cox regression should also be conducted on the time of complete eschar removal 
measured from the date of ICF as secondary analysis. 
Percent Wound Area Surgically Excised for Eschar Removal  
Descriptive statistics of the observed values on a subject level (including the number of missing values) 
should be provided by treatment group (in the FAS). Missing values were to be imputated involving the 
multiple imputations procedure. An overall estimate of the treatment difference with its standard error 
should be reported, together with the final combined p-value. As a sensitivity analysis, the main analysis 
should be repeated using the PP as analysis population instead of the FAS. Secondary analyses of this 
primary endpoint should include adding other baseline variables that are imbalanced, all within the re-
randomisation test framework. In another secondary analysis, a percent wound area surgically excised for 
eschar removal should be analysed on a TW level. The difference in the means of the treatment groups 
should be compared using a linear mixed model, with the correlations between TWs within the same 
patient being described by the compound symmetry pattern. The explanatory variables in the model 
should include treatment group (NexoBrid vs. SoC), treatment centre and %TBSA. This analysis should 
yield an estimate of the difference in means between the two groups, adjusted for centre and %TBSA. 
The re-randomisation test procedure should then be applied as in the primary analysis. 
Cosmesis and Function at 12 Months from Wound Closure  
Descriptive statistics of MVSS score at 12 months should be provided by treatment group, for both 
observed and imputed data. The treatment groups should be compared (using the FAS) using a linear 
model with imputed MVSS score at 12 months as the dependent variable. The explanatory variables in 
the model should include treatment, and the following variables: treatment centre, age, %TBSA, 
proportion of the FT area of a patient and number of TWs (1, 2, 3-4, ≥5). The coefficient corresponding to 
the treatment group should be estimated and should represent the estimated mean difference in MVSS 
score at 12 months between NexoBrid and SoC (adjusted for any imbalance in the stratification factors). 
A clinically meaningful difference should be incorporated into the analysis (1.9 or more units advantage to 
SOC), so that the analysis will show whether the NexoBrid group is estimated to have on average a MVSS 
score not worse than 1.9 units vs. SoC. The following hypotheses are about to be tested: H0: Δ ≥ 1.9 vs. 
H1: Δ < 1.9, where Δ is the mean difference in MVSS score between NexoBrid and SoC adjusted for any 
imbalance in the stratification factors. These hypotheses should be tested by comparing the 95% 
confidence interval for the coefficient of the treatment group from the linear model outlined above to the 
clinically meaningful difference 1.9. The null hypothesis will be rejected if the upper bound of this interval 
is smaller than 1.9. As sensitivity analysis, the procedure should be repeated using the PP instead of the 
FAS. The analyses should be performed using both on-site and remotely collected evaluations, with 
missing values imputed. In addition, a sensitivity analysis should be performed (similar to the main 
analysis described above) to explore the possible influence of remotely captured data. For this, the 
remote evaluations should be "corrected", and missing values at 12 months should be imputed on 
observed on-site evaluations and "corrected" remote evaluations. 
Secondary Analyses 
Incidence of Surgical Excision 
This is a binary yes/no variable and the proportion of patients who need excision will be compared using 
logistic regression. The explanatory variables in the model will include treatment, center, age, %TBSA, 
proportion of the FT area of a patient and number of TWs (1,2,3-4, ≥5). The odds ratio of requiring 
Assessment report

Page 27/87 
 
 
 
 
surgery for NexoBrid versus SoC will be estimated from the model, as well as a 95% confidence interval 
and the level of statistical significance. As sensitivity analysis, the procedure will be repeated using the PP 
instead of the FAS population. A supportive analysis will be performed adjusting for other baseline 
variables that are imbalanced. As an additional analysis, the incidence of surgical excision will be 
compared on a wound level using a mixed logistic regression model with a random effect for patient. 
Blood Loss 
The measure of blood loss per patient will be computed using two different methods:  
- Method 1: treating the whole eschar removal process as one continuous procedure.  
- Method 2: summing the blood loss computed per procedure over all procedures carried out to remove 
eschar. Descriptive statistics of the blood loss values will be provided by treatment group. The imputation 
of missing values should be done involving the multiple imputations procedure. An overall estimate of the 
treatment difference with its standard error will be reported, together with the final combined p-value. 
The analysis with less missing values will be regarded as more reliable and is therefore considered the 
main analysis. The other analysis is considered supportive. As sensitivity analysis, the analysis outlined 
above will be repeated using the PP instead of the FAS as analysis population. A supportive analysis will 
be performed adjusting for other baseline variables that are imbalanced.  
Note: No wound level analysis of this endpoint is possible, since blood loss cannot be attributed to single 
target wounds. 
Incidence of Autograft in DPT Wounds 
This is a binary yes/no variable and the proportion of Deep Partial Thickness TWs that were autografted 
will be compared (on a wound level). The comparison of NexoBrid vs. SOC will be conducted using logistic 
regression within the generalised estimating equations framework that accounts for within-subject 
correlation between target wounds. The explanatory variables in the model will include treatment, center, 
age, %TBSA (wound level), proportion of the FT area of a patient and number of TWs (1,2,3-4, ≥5). The 
odds ratio of requiring Autograft for NexoBrid vs. SOC will be estimated from the model, as well as 95% 
confidence intervals and the level of statistical significance. As sensitivity analysis, the procedure will be 
repeated using the PP instead of the FAS. Supportive analyses will include adjustments for baseline 
variables which are found to be imbalanced. These analyses will only take into account DPT target 
wounds. 
Area of Autograft in DPT Wounds 
For the purpose of the main analysis, the mean %area of autograft in DPT wounds will be compared on a 
subject level between NexoBrid and SOC. This analysis will be restricted to subjects having at least one 
DPT target wound. Descriptive statistics of the observed values on a subject level (including the number 
of missing values) will be provided by treatment group. The imputation of missing values will be done 
involving the multiple imputations procedure. An overall estimate of the treatment difference with its 
standard error will be reported, together with the final combined p-value. As sensitivity analysis, the main 
analysis will be repeated using the PP instead of the FAS, also restricted to subjects having at least one 
DPT target wound. Supportive analyses on a subject level will include adjustments for additional baseline 
variables which are found to be imbalanced.  
As an additional analysis, the percent area autografted in DPT target wounds will be analysed on a target 
wound level. This analysis will be restricted to DPT target wounds only. Descriptive statistics will be 
provided on a target wound level for each treatment group. The differences in the distribution of %area 
autografted in DPT wounds between the treatment groups will be tested using a mixed linear regression 
model with patient as the random effect that accounts for within-subject correlation between target

Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted in 3 stages; with only children aged 4 to 18 years, hospitalised in burn units, 
enrolled in Stage 1. A safety analysis was performed on these patients by a DSMB. If the DSMB did not 
have any safety concerns Stage 2 started, enrolling children between the ages of 1 to 18 years of age. 
After the 50th patient had reached wound closure, an additional safety analysis was performed by the 
DSMB. If no safety concerns were raised Stage 3 commenced, this time enrolling children ages 0 to 18 
according to study procedures.  
After reviewing the entry criteria, eligible patients were stratified based on age, overall total area of burns 
(% TBSA), proportion of the FT area (out of the total burned area) and clinical centre groups. Following 
the stratification and identification of TW(s), patients were randomised as per their stratification group in 
a 1:1 ratio to NexoBrid or SOC. Patients in both treatment arms were treated in a similar way except for

the eschar removal stage. All of a patient’s DPT and FT burns that met the specified entry criteria were 
defined as TWs and were to receive study treatment per the randomised treatment arm. Prior to initiation 
of eschar removal treatment, patients were medicated with appropriate analgesia and underwent wound 
cleansing and dressing of all wounds with antibacterial solutions. 
Baseline data 
Overall, patients’ age, ethnicity, height, weight and body mass index (BMI) were similar between 
treatment arms. The majority of patients were male (NexoBrid: 58.3% vs. SOC: 65.8%), and the median 
age was 3.54 years (NexoBrid: 3.37 years vs. SOC: 3.94 years). The mean BMI was 16.88 kg/m2 and 
17.09 kg/m2, respectively (NexoBrid vs. SOC). Most patients were white (NexoBrid: 70.8% vs. SOC: 
68.5%), with 4.2% and 9.6%, respectively Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.

BMI = body mass index, FAS = Full Analysis Set, Max = maximum value observed, Min = minimum value observed, 
SD = standard deviation.   
The majority of physical examinations in all categories were normal (and similar between treatment 
arms). Of the abnormal physical examinations, 2 (1 patient each for NexoBrid and SOC) were considered 
clinically significant with the remaining 4 (1 patient for NexoBrid vs. 3 patients for SOC) considered not 
clinically significant. The majority of patients (in both treatment arms) were assessed as having normal 
vital signs and pain assessments (and no patient had abnormal CS vital sign or pain assessments at 
baseline). The vital signs and baseline pain assessments were similar in both treatment arms. No patient 
had a positive diabetes status at baseline. 
Several baseline factors (gender, percent SPT area [as % of the total TW-area, classified as <25% or ≥
25%], time from injury to randomisation and number of TWs [1, 2, 3-4 and ≥5]) were compared between 
the two treatment arms (Table 11).  
None of the pre-specified baseline factors were found to be significantly different between the treatment 
arms at the 0.15 significance level.

The mean time since injury to randomisation was 41.0 and 37.3 hours (NexoBrid vs. SOC) respectively. 
The majority of patients in both treatment arms had burns caused by scald (NexoBrid: 68.1% vs. SOC: 
65.8%), followed by fire/flame (NexoBrid: 25.0% vs. SOC: 26.0%). For the majority of patients, the 
place of injury was indoors (NexoBrid: 75.0% vs. SOC: 76.7%). 
Target Wound Description at Baseline 
Target wounds were assessed and analysed on a TW level (N=192) and a patient level (N=145). There 
was a total of 98 TWs in the NexoBrid arm vs. 94 TWs with SOC. The average number of TWs per patient 
was 1.36 with NexoBrid (98 TWs/72 patients) vs. 1.29 with SOC (94 TWs/73 patients). The descriptive 
statistics of the % TBSA of an average TW are presented in Table 12.

DPT = deep partial thickness, FAS = full analysis set, FT = full thickness, Max = maximum, Min = minimum, SOC = 
standard of care, SPT = superficial partial thickness, TBSA = total body surface area a Percent TBSA based on clinical 
assessment.    
Target Wound Description at Baseline - Patient Level 
Overall, the mean TW area (% TBSA of SPT+DPT+ FT TWs) was 5.85% (SD 4.431) for NexoBrid-patients 
vs. 5.30% (SD 4.273) in SOC-patients. Mean % TBSA of all TWs was similar across treatment arms for 
each variable (DPT, FT, and SPT). The descriptive statistics of the % TBSA of all TWs (on a patient level) 
are shown by treatment arm and wound depth in Table 13.  
Each TW was composed of DPT and/or FT areas. However, SPT areas that could not be separated from 
the DPT areas were included in the TW. SPT areas of TWs were not considered for this analysis. If the FT 
was 0 then the TW was considered DPT; if the DPT was 0, then the TW was considered FT; and if the TW 
had both DPT and FT it was considered mixed.

Table 13: Target Wound Description as % TBSA– Patient Level (FAS) 
The TW depth of the majority of TWs (on a patient level) was DPT for both treatment arms; however, the 
proportion of patients with DPT TWs was higher in the NexoBrid arm (80.6%) vs. SOC (71.2%). The 
proportion of patients with mixed thickness TWs was lower in the NexoBrid arm (13.9%) vs. SOC

(21.9%). The proportion of patients with full thickness TWs was 5.6% with NexoBrid arm vs. 6.2% with 
SOC respectively. 
Numbers analysed 
Of the 153 patients enrolled, 145 patients were randomised and included in the FAS: NexoBrid 72 vs. 
SOC: 73. Of the 145 patients randomised, 139 (95.9%) patients were treated and included in the SAS: 
NexoBrid: 69 (95.8%) vs. SOC: 70 (95.9%). Six patients were randomised (NexoBrid :3 vs. SOC: 3) but 
did not receive treatment. Among these 6 patients:  
• 1 NexoBrid-patient withdrew due to AE prior to treatment, according to Investigator decision. 
• 1 NexoBrid-patient experienced a fever and possible wound infection after randomisation and the PI 
decided not to treat according to the randomisation,  
• 1 NexoBrid-patient was not treated because the PI falsely thought that the site did not have an ethics 
committee approval in place.  
• 2 SOC-patients had their consent withdrawn by parent,  
• 1 SOC-patient met 1 or more exclusion criteria. 
Of the patients randomised in the study, 132 patients (NexoBrid: 66 [91.7%] patients vs. SOC: 66 
[90.4%]) completed the 12 weeks post wound closure FU period and 129 patients (NexoBrid: 66 [91.7%] 
vs. SOC: 63 [86.3%]) completed the 12 months FU period. The most common reasons for discontinuation 
from the study were “lost to follow up” and “patient withdrew consent to continue in the study”. No 
patients who received study treatment discontinued due to AEs, deaths, protocol deviations, or left 
hospital against advice. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
Time to Complete Eschar Removal  
The Kaplan-Meier estimates for time to complete eschar removal (in days from randomisation until 
complete eschar removal in all TWs) in the FAS (main analysis) are shown in Figure 3. The estimated 
median time to complete eschar removal (Kaplan-Meier method) was 0.99 days (95% CI: 0.88 to 1.04) 
for NexoBrid vs. 5.99 days (95% CI: 2.71 to 9.84) for SOC.

Figure 3: Kaplan-Meier Curves for Time (in days) to Complete Eschar Removal - Main Analysis, Patient 
Level (FAS) 
The proportional hazards assumption for time to complete eschar removal was checked by including in a 
Cox regression model adjusted for clinical centre, age, % TBSA, proportion of the FT area of a patient, 
and number of TWs (1, 2, 3-4, ≥5). The coefficient of the time-treatment interaction of this model was 
significant at the 5% level (p-value <0.0001). Therefore, a generalised Wilcoxon-Gehan test was 
performed. The results demonstrated superiority of NexoBrid over SOC. The effect was statistically 
significant (p-value = 0.0008 at the significance level of 0.05). 
Table 14: Time to complete eschar removal (main analysis), results of the generalised Wilcoxon-Gehan 
test adjusted for clinical centre, age, % TBSA, proportion of the FT area of a patient and number of TWs 
(FAS) 
Four sensitivity analyses were performed for the primary endpoint “Time to complete Eschar Removal” 
according to the SAP. Results of all sensitivity analyses showed that the time to complete eschar removal 
in the NexoBrid arm was statistically significantly shorter than with SOC (Table 15). These sensitivity 
analyses support the results of the main analysis.

Percent Wound Area Surgically Excised  
Analysis results of the percent wound area surgically excised (on a patient level, FAS) is presented in 
Table 16. The mean (SD) percent wound area surgically excised was statically significantly lower for 
NexoBrid (1.5 [12.13]) vs. SOC (48.1 [46.58]) (p-value <0.0001). 
Table 16: Percent Wound Area Surgically Excised for Eschar Removal – Main Analysis, Patient Level (FAS) 
ANOVA = analysis of variance, FAS = Full Analysis Set, Max = maximum value observed, Min = minimum value 
observed, SE = standard error. Descriptive statistics summarise the observed endpoint values on a patient level. Unit 
of measurement is percent. b Analysis statistics were estimated in 3 steps. In the first step, missing values were 
imputed using multiple imputations procedure. In the second step, each imputed dataset was analysed with ANOVA 
model, using the re-randomisation test. The model included the following covariates: treatment arm, centre group, age 
group, % TBSA group, proportion of FT area group and number of TWs group. In the third step, the results across 
imputed datasets were pooled. Since each imputed dataset’s re-randomised p-value was zero, the re-randomised p-
values were replaced with 1E-11 to enable further computations.    
A sensitivity analysis of this co-primary endpoint was performed using the PP set instead of the FAS. In 
the PPS, the mean (SD) percent wound area surgically excised for eschar removal on a patient level in 
the NexoBrid arm was 1.7 (12.60) vs. 48.5 (46.73) in the SOC arm. The results indicate that the mean % 
wound area surgically excised is lower in the NexoBrid arm compared to SOC (p-value <0.0001) in the 
PPS, supporting the main analysis of this endpoint. 
An additional analysis for this co-primary endpoint was performed on the TW level, using all TWs with 
observed endpoint values from patients included in the FAS. The mean % wound area surgically excised 
on a TW level was 1.1 (SD 10.38) for NexoBrid vs. 51.4 (SD 46.67) for SOC. The results indicate that the 
mean % wound area surgically excised on a TW level is lower in the NexoBrid arm vs. SOC (p-value 
<0.0001) in the FAS set, supporting the main analysis of this endpoint. 
Cosmesis and Function (MVSS) at 12 Months from Wound Closure 
The main analysis (using the FAS) consisted of linear regression analysis of 12-month MVSS scores using 
imputation for missing data as outlined in the SAP (Note: Lower MVSS scores indicate better clinical 
outcome). The coefficient corresponding to the treatment arms represent the estimated mean difference 
in MVSS score at 12 months between NexoBrid and SOC adjusted for any imbalance in stratification 
factors. The descriptive statistics for the imputed data show the mean 12-month MVSS score for NexoBrid 
was lower (3.83 [SD 2.876]) than for SOC (4.86 [SD 3.256]) (Table 17). The regression results show an 
estimated treatment difference for NexoBrid vs. SOC of -2.76 (Table 18). The 95% CI for this treatment 
difference estimate is -3.67 to -1.85. Since the upper bound of this CI does not include the pre-defined NI 
margin of 1.9 points, NI of NexoBrid treatment compared with SOC was established at the predefined 
one-sided significance level of 0.025 (p-value<0.0001).

Table 17: Descriptive Statistics of MVSS Scores at 12 Months (FAS) 
Table 18: MVSS Regression Results at 12 Months (FAS) 
Best case and worst-case imputations were performed on the FAS as sensitivity analyses for this co-
primary endpoint. For the best-case imputation missing MVSS at 12M was imputed as 0 (observed 
minimum MVSS value for SOC in previous Study MW2004-11-02). The descriptive statistics for the 
imputed data showed the mean 12-month MVSS score for NexoBrid was lower (2.88 [SD 3.008]) than for 
SOC (3.22 [SD 3.462]). The regression results show an estimated treatment difference for NexoBrid vs. 
SOC of -2.13 (95% CI: -3.21 to -1.05). Since the CI does not include the pre-defined NI margin of 1.9 
points, NI of NexoBrid treatment compared with SOC was established at the one-sided significance level 
of 0.025 (p-value<0.0001), supporting the main analysis of this endpoint. 
For the worst-case imputation, missing MVSS at 12M was imputed as 9 (observed maximum MVSS value 
for SOC in study MW2004-11-02). The descriptive statistics for the imputed data showed that the mean 
12-month MVSS score for NexoBrid was lower (4.88 [SD 3.403]) than for SOC (5.81 [SD 3.452]). The 
regression results showed an estimated treatment difference for NexoBrid vs. SOC of -2.60 (95% CI: -
3.58 to -1.63). The CI does not include the NI margin of 1.9 points. NI of NexoBrid treatment was 
therefore shown at the one-sided significance level of 0.025 (p-value<0.0001), supporting the main 
analysis of this endpoint. 
An additional sensitivity analysis was performed using the PP set. The descriptive statistics for the 
imputed data showed that the mean 12-month MVSS score for NexoBrid was lower (3.67 [SD 2.869]) 
than for SOC (4.54 [SD 3.127]). The treatment difference for NexoBrid vs. SOC is -2.59 (95% CI: -3.54 
to -1.64), which was similar to the main, and best case and worst-case analyses. Again, NI of NexoBrid 
vs. SOC was shown at the one-sided significance level of 0.025 (p-value<0.0001), supporting the main 
analysis.

Based on the hierarchical testing procedure, the main analysis was considered as confirmatory. Each of 
the co-primary endpoints can be interpreted inferentially only if a statistically significant treatment effect 
was detected in the preceding endpoint. The outcome of the study was considered successful since all 
three co-primary endpoints were met. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Incidence of surgical excision  
The proportion of patients who needed excision for ER was compared between NexoBrid and SOC using 
logistic regression. Patients with missing values (NexoBrid: 3 patients vs. SOC: 3 patients) were assumed 
to have received surgery as was pre-defined in the SAP. The proportion and number of patients who 
required surgical excision for ER was 8.33% (6/72 patients) with NexoBrid vs. 64.38% (47/73 patients) 
with SOC (Table 19).  
Table 19: Incidence of Surgical Excision for Eschar Removal for NexoBrid vs SOC – Main Analysis (FAS) 
In the main analysis, the odds ratio of requiring surgical excision for ER for NexoBrid vs. SOC was 0.025 
(95% CI: 0.007 to 0.090, p-value <0.0001), indicating a 97.5% lower likelihood of having an excision in 
the NexoBrid arm compared with SOC. 
The results of three sensitivity analyses were similar to the results of the main analysis (odds ratios were 
in a range of 0.014 to 0.023 [p-value of <0.0001] for NexoBrid vs. SOC). The odds ratios were 
statistically significant, and supportive of the main analysis. An additional analysis was performed on a 
TW level, using all TWs with observed endpoint values (from patients included in the FAS). The proportion 
and number of TWs which required surgical excision for ER was 3.19% (3/94 TWs) with NexoBrid vs. 
63.22% (55/87 TWs) with SOC. The odds ratio was estimated as 0.011 (95% CI: 0.002 to 0.056, p-value 
<0.0001), indicating a 98.9% lower likelihood of excision with NexoBrid compared with SOC, which 
supports the main analysis. Based on the hierarchical testing procedure, the main analysis of this 
endpoint was considered as confirmatory. 
Blood Loss Related to Eschar Removal 
The mean (SD) blood loss with NexoBrid (32.26 [284.757] mL) was numerically lower than with SOC 
(202.55 [409.147] mL). However, the difference was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.1374). 
Notably there were multiple missing values for the blood loss analysis in both treatment arms (NexoBrid: 
30/72 vs. SOC: 49/73), resulting in a small population for the analysis. Physicians tend to draw less blood 
routinely, especially in young children. Missing values derived from missing samples, samples that were 
not analysable, and/or samples that were not collected within the required timeframe. As was pre-defined 
in the SAP, the approach with the least missing values (the subject-oriented analysis) was used as the 
main analysis. The results of the main analysis are presented in Table 20. 
Assessment report 
EMA/560965/2023 
Page 39/87 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 20: Blood Loss (in mL) – Main Analysis, Blood Loss Calculated Using Subject-Oriented Method, 
Subject Level (FAS) 
Results of sensitivity analyses using the PP set showed similar results compared to the main analysis: the 
mean (SD) blood loss with NexoBrid (36.85 [301.932] mL) was numerically lower than with SOC (126.71 
[340.620] mL), however, the effect was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.3081).  
Two additional supportive analyses were conducted, which evaluated procedure-oriented blood loss on 
the FAS and PP set. The mean (SD) blood loss in the NexoBrid arm was numerically lower than in the 
SOC arm; however, the effect was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.3166 [FAS] and 0.3476 [PP 
set]). 
Since the main analysis of the blood loss did not demonstrate superiority of NexoBrid over SOC at the 
significance level of 0.05, the hierarchical testing procedure stops.  
Incidence of Autograft in DPT Wounds 
The main analysis was performed on a TW level using DPT TWs from patients included in the FAS. The 
frequency distribution and analyses results are presented in Table 21. The proportion and number of DPT 
TWs that had been autografted was 25.93% (21/81 DPT TWs) for NexoBrid vs. 37.68% (26/69 DPT TWs) 
for SOC. The odds ratio of requiring autograft for NexoBrid vs. SOC was estimated as 0.414 (95% CI: 
0.163 – 1.054, p-value = 0.0545. 
Table 21: Incidence of Autograft in DPT Wounds – Main Analysis, TW Level (FAS, DPT TWs Only) 
The results of three sensitivity analyses were similar to the main analysis. The incidence rate of autograft 
in DPT wounds was numerically lower in the NexoBrid arm than in the SOC arm.

Percent Area of Autograft Performed in DPT Wounds 
The main analysis was performed using the FAS patients with at least one DPT TW. The descriptive 
statistics and results of the analysis are presented in Table 22. The mean percent DPT wound area 
autografted with NexoBrid (15.9% [SD 38.57%]) was numerically lower than with SOC (22.8% [SD 
43.72%]). The treatment difference between NexoBrid and SOC was estimated as –3.7% (SE=7.60, p-
value = 0.5045). 
Table 22: Percent Area of Autograft Performed in DPT Wounds - Main Analysis, Patient Level (FAS, Only 
Patients with at Least one DPT TW) 
A sensitivity analysis was performed using the PP set, instead of the FAS. Similar to the main analysis, 
the mean % area with NexoBrid (15.8% [SD 39.11%]) was numerically lower than with SOC (23.7% [SD 
44.38%]) in the PP set. The results of this sensitivity analysis were similar to the results in the main 
analysis. The treatment difference between NexoBrid and SOC was estimated as –3.1% (SE=7.73, p-
value = 0.6857). 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup Analyses of the Co-primary Endpoints by Age Group 
The treatment arms were compared using a log rank test, separately for each age group (0 to 23 months, 
24 months to 3 years, 0 to 3 years, 4 to 11 years, and 12 to 18 years on patients from the FAS). The 
results of this subgroup analysis indicate that for each age group the median (SD) time to complete 
eschar removal in the NexoBrid arm was shorter than in the SOC arm (Table 23), supporting the main 
analysis of this endpoint.

was lower than in the SOC arm (Table 24). 
Table 24: Percent Wound Area Surgically Excised for Eschar Removal – Subgroup Analysis by Age Groups,

Cosmesis and Function (MVSS) at 12 Months by Age Group 
The results of this subgroup analysis were similar to the results obtained in the main analysis. The 
cosmesis and function (MVSS score for TWs) at 12 months from wound closure was not worse by more 
than 1.9 points for NexoBrid vs. SOC. Only in the age group 12 to 18 years, after adding the NI margin of 
1.9 MVSS points to the values in the SOC arm, the results show that NexoBrid had a 2.79 MVSS point 
advantage over SOC, however, the 95% CI was -6.00 to 0.42. The upper bound of this CI is slightly 
above 0 (p=0.0424, one-sided).

Results of incidence of surgical excision by age group indicated that for each age group the incidence of 
surgical excision performed for ER in the NexoBrid arm was (significantly) lower vs. SOC, supporting the 
main analysis in all age groups. 
Blood Loss Related to Eschar Removal by Age Group 
The results of this subgroup analysis by age group were similar to the results obtained in the main 
analysis: for each age group the blood loss in NexoBrid arm was numerically (but not significantly) lower 
than in SOC. 
Incidence of Autograft Performed in DPT Wounds by Age Group 
The results of this subgroup analysis by age group were similar to the results obtained in the main 
analysis of this endpoint. For each age group, the proportions of TWs autografted were numerically (but 
not significantly) lower in the NexoBrid arm than in the SOC arm. 
Percent Area of Autograft in DPT Wounds by Age Group 
The mean area (in %) of autograft in the NexoBrid arm was (not significantly) lower than in the SOC arm 
in the age groups 0 to 23 months and 1 to 3 years (and in the 0 to 3 years group). For the age group 4 to 
11 years, the mean area of autograft in the NexoBrid arm was (not significantly) higher than in the SOC 
arm. 
Further Exploratory Endpoints  
1. Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) for TWs were analysed at 6-week FU, 12-week 
FU, 6-month FU, and 12-monthFU. 
- POSAS total score: the mean POSAS total score of TWs decreased over time. The mean (SD) total score 
at 12-months was lower in the NexoBrid arm (29.54 [17.655]) vs. SOC (34.54 [19.995]). However, no 
significant difference was observed between treatment arms at any visit.

- POSAS patient score: the mean (SD) POSAS patient score of TWs decreased over time. At the 12-month 
FU it was lower in the NexoBrid arm (15.53 [10.091]) vs. SOC (17.18 [9.719]). However, no significant 
difference was observed between treatment arms at any visit. 
- POSAS observer score: the mean (SD) POSAS observer score of TWs decreased over time. At the 12-
month FU it was lower in the NexoBrid arm (13.99 [8.720]) vs. SOC (17.22 [11.610]). However, no 
significant difference in POSAS total score of TWs was observed at any visit. Similar results were 
observed in a repeat analysis that excluded patients with remotely collected data. For the 12-months 
visit, the mean POSAS observer score in the NexoBrid arm (15.94 [9.797]) was significantly lower than in 
the SOC arm (21.83 [11.774]; p-value = 0.0317).  
The exploratory analyses of POSAS (total, observer, and patient) of TWs at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 
months, and 12 months post wound closure showed a numerical advantage of NexoBrid over SOC, the 
gap between treatment arms increasing towards the 12-month assessments.  
2. Incidence of surgical escharotomy procedures on circumferential extremities TWs: no surgical 
escharotomy procedures were performed during the study. 
3. Incidence of reduction in interstitial/compartment pressure in circumferential extremities TWs: 13 
patients with NexoBrid vs. 3 patients with SOC had at least one circumferential extremity TW. 
Interstitial/compartment pressure was reduced for at least one circumferential extremity in 4/13 (30.8%) 
NexoBrid-patients vs. 1/3 (33.3%) SOC-patients. No significant difference between arms was detected. 
4. Reduction in surgical need as measured by analysis of incidence of harvested donor sites: less patients 
with NexoBrid had at least 1 donor site wound (19/72 patients [26.4%]) compared with SOC (27/73 
patients [37.0%]). The difference was not statistically significant.  
5. Reduction in surgical need as measured by analysis of % area of harvested donor site: the mean (SD) 
% area of donor site wounds with NexoBrid (0.88 [2.187]) was numerically lower than with SOC (3.28 
[(12.477]). The difference was not statistically significant.  
6. MVSS scores for TWs at the 6-week, 12-week, and 6-month FU were analysed. No significant 
difference for TWs were observed between groups at any visit (by ANOVA superiority test).  
7. Duration of hospitalisation: the estimated median duration of hospitalisation (using the Kaplan-Meier 
method) was 12 days (95% CI: 9 - 16) for NexoBrid vs. 10 days (95% CI: 8 - 14) for SOC. There was no 
statistically significant difference between treatment arms. 
Some endpoints with connection to the clinical efficacy [Time to reach complete wound closure; Lower 
Extremity Function Scale (LEFS); Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDash); Range of 
Motion (ROM) and Quality of Life (EQ-5D)] were evaluated in the study as safety parameters; and are 
presented below. 
Time to Reach Complete (>95%) Wound Closure (TW Level) - Main Analysis CIDS 
In the CIDS study time to reach complete wound closure (defined as % wound area epithelialized and/or 
closed by graft is >95% without drainage or dressing requirements confirmed at 2 consecutive study 
visits, 2 weeks apart) was compared at a TW level using a survival analysis with clustered data (for the 
multiple TWs that can occur in a patient) based on appropriate assumptions. The mean time to reach 
complete wound closure was 30.24 days with NexoBrid vs. 27.93 with SOC. The estimated median time 
to complete wound closure on a TW level (using the Kaplan Meier Method) was 32 days (95% CI: 28.00 – 
42.00) for NexoBrid vs. 41 days (95% CI: 35.00 – 45.00) for SOC, when the NI margin of + 7 days for 
SOC was included. Non inferiority for NexoBrid was shown (Table 26).

Table 26: Time (in Days) to Reach Complete Wound Closure (>95%) – Main Analysis, Target Wound 
Level (FAS) 
Additional Analysis – Time to Complete (>95%) Wound Closure (Patient Level) 
However, the additional analysis of this endpoint on a patient level (using the FAS) showed that a 
Wilcoxon test statistic (estimated from the generalised Wilcoxon-Gehan test) was 32, indicating that for 
the time to complete wound closure in the NexoBrid arm NI was not established (p-value =0.1114). 
Supportive Analysis – Time to Reach 100% Wound Closure (TW Level) 
The estimated median time reach 100% wound closure on a TW level (using the Kaplan Meier Method) 
was 44.00 days (95% CI: 31.00 – 65.00) for NexoBrid vs. 50.00 days (95% CI: 41.00 – 77.00) for SOC, 
including the NI margin of + 7 days for SOC. The hazard ratio of NexoBrid vs. SOC - estimated from the 
parametric frailty model - was 2.25 (95% CI: 1.01 to 5.00), indicating that the time to 100% wound 
closure with NexoBrid was not longer (by more than 7 days) than with SOC (p-value = 0.0475, 
establishing the NI of NexoBrid vs. SOC), supporting the result obtained in the main analysis.

EMA/560965/2023 
Page 45/87 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Supportive Analysis – Time to Reach 100% Wound Closure (Patient Level) 
The results of this supportive analysis were similar to the results obtained for the additional analysis on a 
patient level. The Wilcoxon test statistic, estimated from the generalised Wilcoxon-Gehan test, was 
18.00. NI was not established (p-value = 0.3095). This analysis had a high number of missing values 
(44/72 missing value in NexoBrid, 45/73 missing in SOC, around 61% missing values in both treatment 
arms). 
Lower Extremity Function Scale (LEFS) 
The mean LEFS scores were compared between treatment arms (for each visit separately) by a one-way 
analysis of variance. No statistically significant difference in mean LEFS score was observed between the 
treatment groups at any visit; however, the number of patients included in this LEFS score analysis was 
notably small (NexoBrid and SOC: both N=6), therefore, no conclusion can be drawn from the study data. 
Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDash) 
No statistically significant difference in mean QuickDASH score was observed between the two groups at 
any visit; however, again low numbers of patients (NexoBrid: N=5 vs. SOC: N=4) preclude any 
conclusion. 
Range of Motion (ROM) 
For the majority of patients all measurement were normal in both treatment arms. At least 1 abnormal 
finding was observed in 6/21 (28.6%) in NexoBrid patients vs. 3/13 (23.1%) with SOC. The odds ratio for 
at least one abnormal finding for NexoBrid vs. SOC was estimated as 0.750 (95% CI: 0.151 – 3.716, 
p=0.7246). 
Quality of Life (EQ-5D) 
The mean EQ-5D VAS scores were similar between NexoBrid and SOC both overall and when evaluated 
by age group (0 – 23 months, 24 months – 3 years, 0 – 3 years, 4 – 11 years, and 12 – 18 years). There 
were no statistically significant differences in the EQ-5D mobility, self-care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, or anxiety/depression scores between the treatment arms overall or for any group.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Patient demographic and baseline characteristics for paediatric patients (from pooled studies MW2012-
01-01 (CIDS) and MW2010-03-02 (DETECT)) and adult patients (≥18 years old, from pooled studies 
DETECT, MW2004-11-02, and MW2002-04-01) are presented in Table 28. The demographic and baseline 
characteristics were generally similar across the 2 treatment arms in both paediatric studies. The mean 
(SD) age in the MW2012-01-01 (CIDS) study was 5.71 (4.8) and 5.83 (4.9) years in the NexoBrid and 
SOC arms respectively vs. study MW2004-11-02: 10.0 (4.49), and 10.8 (4.74) years (NexoBrid and SOC, 
respectively; N= 15 vs. N=16). The majority of paediatric patients in both studies were males (CIDS: 
42/72 [58.3%] and 48/73 [65.8%] NexoBrid and SOC respectively vs. MW2004-11-02: 10/15 [66.7%] 
and 14/16 [87.5%] NexoBrid and SOC respectively, and Caucasians (CIDS: 51/72 [70.8%], 50/73 
[68.5%] NexoBrid and SOC respectively, vs. MW2004-11-02: 10/15 [66.7%], 9/16 [56.3%] NexoBrid 
and SOC respectively). This was consistent with demographics observed for the adult population, where 
the majority of patients were male and Caucasians. The majority of paediatric patients in the CIDS study 
had burns resulting from scald (49/72 [68.1%] and 48/73 [65.8%] NexoBrid and SOC respectively), 
while the majority of paediatric patients in study MW2004-11-02 had burns resulting from fire/flame 
(8/15 [53.3%] and 10/16 [62.5%] NexoBrid and SOC respectively), similar to the etiology in the adult 
population.

The mean (SD) % TBSA of all TWs treated was similar in the 2 treatment arms in the paediatric studies 
(5.85 [4.431] and 5.30 [4.273] for NexoBrid and SOC respectively in the CIDS study, and 12.8 [5.89] vs. 
12.7 [5.80] for NexoBrid vs. SOC respectively in study MW2004-11-02). The majority of paediatric 
patients had total treated wound-area (all wounds) that was ≤15% TBSA (CIDS: 68/72 [94.4%] vs. 70/73 
[95.9%] for NexoBrid vs. SOC respectively and MW2004-11-02: 11/15 [73.3%] vs. 10/16 [62.5%] for 
NexoBrid and SOC respectively). The majority of paediatric patients had treated TWs that were DPT 
(CIDS: 80.6% vs. 71.2% of TW NexoBrid vs. SOC, respectively and Study MW2004-11-02: 75.0% vs. 
53.7% of TW NexoBrid vs. SOC, respectively). 
Results - Time to Complete Eschar Removal 
Side by side comparisons of time to complete ER in paediatric patients, together with a summary of 
results in adult patients, are presented in Table 29. Results of the ISE analysis were consistent with 
results in the CIDS study: the Kaplan-Meier estimated median time to complete ER per patient was 
statistical significantly shorter with NexoBrid compared with SOC (1 day vs. 5 days [Wilcoxon test p-value 
= 0.0126] in paediatric patients in study MW2004-11-02, and 1 day vs. 4 days [Wilcoxon test p-value 
<0.0001] in the adult patients in the pooled studies DETECT, MW2004-11-02, and MW2002-04-01). 
Table 29: Time to Complete Eschar Removal (Days) 
Percent Wound Area Surgically Excised for Eschar Removal 
Side by side comparisons of percent wound area surgically excised for ER for all wounds in paediatric 
patients, together with a summary of results in adult patients, are presented in Table 30. 
The results from the CIDS study are supported by results in the subgroup of paediatric patients in study 
MW2004-11-02, where mean (SD) of percent wound area surgically excised was lower for NexoBrid vs. 
SOC (9.5 [19.41] vs. 71.3 [38.68]). The estimated least square mean difference between NexoBrid and 
SOC in the paediatric subgroup of Study MW2004-11-02 was -61.80 (95% CI: -87.21 to -36.40). Results 
in paediatric patients were comparable to results in adult patients in the pooled analysis (studies: 
DETECT, MW2004-11-02, and MW2002-04-01).

Table 30: Percent Wound Area Surgically Excised - Per Patient 
Cosmesis and Function (MVSS) at 12 Months 
This was a primary efficacy endpoint in the paediatric CIDS study (2.76 points advantage over SOC; 95% 
CI -3.67 to -1.85, p-value <0.0001, see above). The DETECT study in adults included cosmesis at 12 
months from wound closure as a safety endpoint. Results were comparable to results in the CIDS study. 
In the DETECT study, NexoBrid had a 1.36 MVSS point advantage over SOC (p-value = 0.0027). The 
95% CI for this treatment effect was -2.24 to -0.48.  
Other endpoints 
Blood loss related to ER in paediatric patients in the CIDS study was numerically lower in the NexoBrid 
arm than in SOC arm (mean (SD): NexoBrid: 32.26mL (285) vs. SOC: 202.5mL (409)), however, the 
effect was not statistically significant due to the number of missing values. Blood loss data were 
consistent with results of acute blood loss and change in hemoglobin from before to after debridement in 
paediatric patients in study MW2004-11-02 (87.4 mL (400) vs. SOC: 959.6mL (1054)), and consistent 
with results in adult patients in both the ISE pooled analysis and the pivotal Phase 3 studies in adults 
(DETECT, MW2004-11-02, and MW2002-04-01; NExoBrid: 104.8mL (511) vs. SOC: 599.2mL (858)). 
The incidence of autografted DPT TWs and the % wound area autografted per DPT TW in the CIDS study 
were numerically lower with NexoBrid arm vs. SOC (25.9% vs. 37.7%). This was supported by results of 
paediatric patients in study MW2004-11-02 NexoBrid: 21.7% vs. SOC: 31.8%). Results in paediatric 
patients are consistent with the positive trend towards fewer autografts and smaller area autografted 
observed in adult patients (DETECT, MW2004-11-02, and MW2002-04-01: NexoBrid: 26.8% vs. SOC: 
33.1%). 
Length of hospital stay (time to hospital discharge) was an exploratory endpoint in the CIDS study. The 
study didn’t show a statistically significant difference between treatment arms. This was consistent with 
results in paediatric and adult patients in the ISE pooled analysis (DETECT, MW2004-11-02, and 
MW2002-04-01), where no notable differences in the length of stay for patients in the NexoBrid arm as 
compared with patients in the SOC arm or Gel Vehicle arms were observed.

Other clinical studies 
Retrospective study 35-98-910 
A total of 154 patients were included in the retrospective study 35-98-910. Of these, 75 patients (<16 
years) were included in paediatric population.   
In the NexoBrid arm, the mean age (SD) was lower in the study 35-98-910 compared to paediatric 
pooled population (4.3 [3.7] vs. 6.5 [5.03] years). The majority of paediatric patients were males in both 
pooled pediatric population (52/87 [59.8%]) and study 35-98-910 (30/46 [65.2%]). The majority of 
patients in both paediatric pooled populations and study 35-98-910 had total treated wounds (all wounds) 
of ≤ 15% TBSA (90.8% vs. 98.7%) in the NexoBrid arm. 
Time to complete ER was not assessed in the retrospective study 35-98-910. The incidence of Surgical 
Excision for Eschar Removal was also not assessed. Debridement was achieved in 92.0% of the area that 
was in contact with NexoBrid. In the NexoBrid arm, percent of eschar removed per TW was similar in the 
paediatric pooled population and study 35-98-910 (96.7% vs. 92.0%). 
The mean (SD) time to complete wound closure for NexoBrid and SOC on a TW level (clustered data of 
TWs in a patient), was 32.0 (16.29) days and 30.5 (16.96) days, respectively. The mean (SD) time to 
complete wound closure on a TW level was shorter in the Study 35-98-910 (21.4 [16.5] days) compared 
with the paediatric pooled population (32.0 [16.29] days).  
Upon CHMP’ request, the MAH has compared the paediatric efficacy data from the controlled studies 
(MW2012-01-01, CIDS, and MW2004-11-02) with the data from the open-label (MW2008-09-03) and 
retrospective (35- 98-910) studies. Efficacy results in paediatric patients from the retrospective study 
were generally consistent with the results in the pooled paediatric patients from controlled studies. 
Differences that were noted may be due to the differing methods of data collection between these 
studies. The results in the 3 paediatric patients from the open-label study (MW2008-09-03) were 
supportive of the overall conclusions. Overall, demographics of age, gender distribution, treated wound 
area, and burn depth were generally similar between pooled paediatric population and study 35-98-910. 
The sample size of MW2008-09-03 was not conducive to a meaningful comparison, but the data were 
within the range of what was reported for the pooled paediatric population and study 35- 98-910. 
Comparisons of key efficacy result data are summarized below:  
Time to Complete Eschar Removal: In the NexoBrid arm, the results of time to ER are consistent across 
studies (1 day in the pooled data vs. 1 to 2 days in Study MW2008-09-03 [not analyzed in 35- 98-910]). 
Incidence of Surgical Excision for Eschar Removal– Per Patient: In the NexoBrid arm, the incidence of 
excision performed for ER was 8.0% (7 out of 87 patients) and no patients required excision for ER in 
Study MW2008-09-03 [not analysed in 35-98-910]). 
Percent Area of Autograft Performed per Target Wound: Overall, the mean of percent wound area 
autografted was low in both paediatric pooled population (14.2% for DPT TWs) and in the Study 35-98- 
910 (1.5% for TWs). In MW2008-09-031, 2 patients required (95% and 50%).  
Time to Complete Wound Closure: In the NexoBrid arm, the mean [SD] time to complete wound closure 
was 32.0 [16.29] days in the paediatric pooled population and 21.4 [16.5] days in Study 35-98- 910. In 
MW2008-09-03, wound closure for all TWs was achieved after 29 days (n=2) and 61 days (n=1).  
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The variation application is supported by interim results from study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS study), a 3-
stage, multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, controlled, open label, 2 arm study aiming to

demonstrate the superiority of NexoBrid treatment over SOC treatment in paediatric patients (aged 0 to 
18 years) with deep partial thickness (DPT) and full thickness (FT) thermal burns of 1% to 30% of total 
body surface area (TBSA). 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH received Protocol assistance at the CHMP on 11/11/2021 where it was indicated, with regards to 
study MW2012-01-01, that it could be acceptable for the CHMP to assess the 12 months interim data of 
the study for the intended extension to the paediatric population, given that the long-term follow-up data 
are likely to be supportive (and thus not considered pivotal for the determination of the benefit-risk 
balance of NexoBrid). Upon CHMP’s request, the MAH committed to submit the long-term follow-up data 
for assessment post-approval, once available (by Q2 2024).  
The present application thus includes the 12 months interim efficacy data derived from paediatric study 
MW2012-01-01 (CIDS study) to support the extension of the current indication of ‘eschar removal for 
removal of eschar in adults with deep partial- and full-thickness thermal burns’ to the paediatric 
population. At least 145 evaluable patients with the following age distribution: at least 75 patients from 
birth to less than 4 years; at least 30 patients from 4 years to less than 12 years of age; at least 20 
patients from 12 years to less than 18 years of age were to be included in the study in line with the 
agreed PIP. The remaining 20 patients were to be enrolled to any of the above groups, per their age 
during enrolment. At least 70 evaluable patients were to be included for the long-term follow-up 
analyses. 
A total of 153 patients were screened for enrolment, of which 145 patients were randomised and included 
in the full analysis set (FAS): NexoBrid 72 vs. SOC 73. Paediatric patients with thermal burn wounds 
defined as DPT and/or FT requiring hospitalisation and who meet the entrance criteria were enrolled in 
the study. The study was conducted in 3 stages; with only children ages 4 to 18 years, hospitalised in 
burn units, enrolled in Stage 1. After the DSMB did not have any safety concerns Stage 2 commenced, 
enrolling children between the ages of 1 to 18 years. Since no safety concerns were raised by the DSMB 
after stage 2, Stage 3 commenced, this time enrolling children ages 0 to 18 according to study 
procedures. 
The numbers analysed in the pivotal CIDS study and the age distribution (45 patients ≥0 months and ≤23 
months, 30 patients ≥24 months and ≤3 years, 50 patients ≥4 years and ≤11 years and 20 patients ≥12 
years and <18 years) are considered adequate and meet the requirements of the PIP.  
Methods with endpoints, recruitment with inclusion/exclusion criteria, dropout distribution and study 
conduct are also considered adequate. 
Baseline data comparison showed good comparability between the two treatment groups (NexoBrid vs. 
SOC). Mean treated wound area (% TBSA) per age group was: 0-23 Months: 6.7% TBSA, 2-3 Years: 
7.0% TBSA, 4-11 Years: 8.5% TBSA and 12-18 Years: 10% TBSA. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The main analysis of the first co-primary endpoint, the ‘time to complete eschar removal’ (FAS 
population) demonstrated superiority of NexoBrid treatment over SOC, with a statistically significant 
shorter time to complete eschar removal for NexoBrid vs. SOC. The estimated median time to complete 
eschar removal (using the Kaplan-Meier method) was 0.99 days for NexoBrid vs. 5.99 days for SOC. The 
main analysis result was confirmed in sensitivity analyses that investigated the robustness of the results 
(missing data). Additionally, a subgroup analysis by age group (0 to 23 months, 24 months to 3 years, 0 
to 3 years, 4 to 11 years, and 12 to 18 years) consistently demonstrated superiority of NexoBrid over 
SOC in each age group evaluated.

The main analysis of the second co-primary endpoint, the ‘% wound area surgically excised for eschar 
removal’ (FAS population) resulted in a significantly smaller mean % wound area surgically excised with 
NexoBrid vs. SOC (1.5% vs. 48.1%). The main analysis result was confirmed in sensitivity analyses using 
a different population (PPS) and an additional analysis on a TW level. In a subgroup analysis by age 
group, superiority of NexoBrid over SOC was consistently demonstrated in each age group. These results 
demonstrate that NexoBrid reduces the surgical burden in paediatric patients.  
The descriptive statistics for the third co-primary endpoint, ‘cosmesis and function measured by MVSS at 
12 months’ post wound closure (FAS) demonstrated a lower mean MVSS score for NexoBrid (3.83 [SD 
2.876] vs. SOC (4.86 [SD 3.256]). The main analysis demonstrated NI of NexoBrid vs. SOC, using a NI 
margin of 1.9. The effect was statistically significant (p-value <0.0001) at the significance level of one 
sided 0.025. All sensitivity analyses of this endpoint using best- and worst-case imputations confirmed NI 
of NexoBrid. Additionally, descriptive statistics of MVSS scores by age groups demonstrated lower mean 
MVSS scores for NexoBrid compared with SOC in all age subgroups.  
In the main analysis of the first secondary endpoint, the ‘proportion of patients who needed excision for 
eschar removal’ (FAS), the odds ratio of requiring surgical excision of eschar for NexoBrid vs. SOC was 
estimated as 0.025 (95% CI: 0.007 to 0.090; p-value <0.0001) indicating a statistically significant 
advantage of NexoBrid over SOC. NexoBrid patients were less likely to require surgical excision than 
SOC-patients (NexoBrid: 8.33% (6/72 patients) vs. SOC: 64.38% (47/73)). Sensitivity analyses on a 
different population (PPS) as well as an additional analysis on the TW level, consistently supported the 
main result. Additional subgroup analysis by age group also supported the main analysis by 
demonstrating superiority of NexoBrid vs. SOC. Based on the hierarchical testing procedure, the main 
analysis of this endpoint can be considered as confirmatory. 
The ‘mean blood loss’ in the NexoBrid arm (using the patient-oriented method) was numerically lower vs. 
SOC (32 mL vs 203 mL); however, the effect was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.3166 [FAS]); 
therefore, the hierarchical testing procedure stopped here.  
There were multiple missing values in blood loss evaluation. Subgroup analysis by age group showed that 
blood loss was numerically lower for NexoBrid vs. SOC in 0 to 3 years, 4 to 11 years, and 12 to 18 years 
subgroups. In addition to the blood loss assessments based on ABL, blood related to eschar removal was 
also assessed by the change in haemoglobin measured before and after the debridement procedure as 
part of the safety assessments (see chapter 2.5,Laboratory findings: Blood transfusions, Change in 
haemoglobin). 
In the main analysis of the third secondary endpoint, the ‘proportion and number of DPT TWs that 
required autografting’ was lower in the NexoBrid treatment arm (25.93% [21/81 TWs]) vs. SOC (37.68% 
[26/69 TWs]). The estimated odd ratio of NexoBrid vs. SOC was 0.414 (95% CI: 0.163 - 1.054) (p-value 
=0.0545). Results of all sensitivity and supportive analysis as well as the subgroup analysis by age 
consistently showed a lower proportion and number of DPT TWs requiring autografting for NexoBrid vs. 
SOC.  
Descriptive statistics for the fourth secondary endpoint showed that the ‘mean percent area of autograft 
in DPT wounds’ with NexoBrid (15.9% [SD 38.57]) was smaller than with SOC (22.8% [SD 43.72]). The 
estimated treatment difference was not statistically significant (-3.7% [SE 7.60] (p-value =0.5045).  
In the subgroup analysis by age group, the percent area of autograft was numerically lower with 
NexoBrid vs. SOC for patients aged 0 to 3 years and 12 to 18 years but was numerically higher than SOC 
for the subset of patients ages 4 to 11.  
Exploratory analysis of POSAS (total, observer, and patient) of TWs at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 
12 months post wound closure demonstrated a consistent numerical advantage of NexoBrid over SOC.  
Assessment report 
EMA/560965/2023 
Page 55/87 
 
 
 
 
In an exploratory analysis, no significant difference was observed in the incidence of reduction in 
interstitial compartmental pressure in circumferential extremity TWs in the NexoBrid and SOC treatment 
arms. 
In an exploratory analysis, the % wound area surgically harvested was numerically lower for NexoBrid 
compared with SOC and the number of patients with at least 1 surgically harvested donor site wound was 
numerically lower with NexoBrid compared with SOC (difference ns). 
Exploratory analyses of MVSS of TWs at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months post wound closure were 
generally similar for the NexoBrid and SOC treatment arm.  
Some endpoints with connection to the clinical efficacy [Time to reach complete wound closure; Lower 
Extremity Function Scale (LEFS); Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDash); Range of 
Motion (ROM) and Quality of Life (EQ-5D)] were evaluated in the study as safety parameters; however 
the results are discussed  below. 
Time to Reach Complete Wound Closure 
In the main Analysis (on the Target Wound Level) ‘Median time to Reach Complete Wound Closure 
(>95%)’ was 28 days for NexoBrid-patients vs. 24 days for SOC-patients (observed data only). This 
difference of 4 days can be considered as clinically not significant even though formal non-inferiority was 
only established in the main analysis (when incorporating a 7-day advantage for the SOC) which could 
not be confirmed in additional analyses (on a patient level). In the pooled studies (adult and paediatric 
patients), time to complete wound closure was (when estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method) median 
NexoBrid: 31.0 days vs. SOC: 27.0 days, or calculated (using actual data) NexoBrid vs. SOC: mean 32.5 
days vs. 30.4 days, median 28.0 days vs. 24.0 days respectively). 
Upon CHMP’s request, the MAH provided an additional post hoc analysis comparing the observed only 
data on ‘Time to complete wound closure’ with the previously submitted main analysis. The new post hoc 
analysis corroborates the main analysis, since observed only data on ‘median time to complete wound 
closure’ for NexoBrid and SOC on a TW level was (NexoBrid vs. SOC): 28 days vs. 23.5 days, compared 
to the main analysis (NexoBrid vs. SOC): 28 days vs. 24 days, respectively. (The estimated median time 
to complete wound closure on a TW level - using the Kaplan Meier Method - was 32.00 days (95% CI: 
28.00 – 42.00) for NexoBrid vs.  41.00 days (95% CI: 35.00 – 45.00) for SOC when including the NI 
margin of + 7 days for SOC.).  
In the main analysis the hazard ratio of NexoBrid vs. SOC (estimated from the parametric frailty model) 
was 2.86 (95% CI: 1.23 - 6.67; p-value = 0.0149), indicating NI of NexoBrid to SOC. 
In the new post hoc analysis the hazard ratio of NexoBrid vs. SOC (estimated from the parametric frailty 
model) was 4.89 (95% CI: 1.32 -18.11; p-value = 0.0176), supporting NI of NexoBrid to SOC (NI margin 
of 7 days in both analyses). 
The results of the analysis on the basis of observed data only were incorporated in the SmPC section 5.1. 
Functionality and QoL life measurements at 12 months were generally similar in the NexoBrid and SOC 
treatment arms. However, the number of patients included in the analyses was low, which precludes firm 
conclusions. No meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the BOQ results due to the low patient 
numbers. 
The results of ROM evaluations were generally similar for NexoBrid and SOC treatment arms.  
Analysis of pooled data 
The efficacy results in the paediatric study CIDS for the co-primary endpoints were supported by efficacy 
data from paediatric patients in study MW2004-11-02. They were also consistent with results in adult 
Assessment report 
EMA/560965/2023 
Page 56/87 
 
 
 
 
patients in the pooled analysis of the pivotal Phase 3 studies in adults (DETECT, MW2004-11-02, and 
MW2002-04-01).  
The time to complete ER, % wound area surgically excised and incidence of surgical excision in paediatric 
patients in the CIDS study were lower for NexoBrid vs. SOC. These results are supported by results of 
paediatric patients in study MW2004-11-02. The results are also consistent with results in adult patients 
in the pooled pivotal Phase 3 studies (DETECT, MW2004-11-02, and MW2002-04-01). 
Time to complete wound closure at the patient level in NexoBrid treated patients was comparable 
between the CIDS study and pooled adult population. In the adult pooled population, the time to reach 
complete (>95%) wound closure on a TW level was comparable in the NexoBrid and SOC treatment 
arms. The Kaplan-Meier estimated median time to complete wound closure for NexoBrid and SOC on a 
TW level (clustered data of TWs in a patient), was 32 (95% CI: 29.0 - 34.0) days and 28 (95% CI: 24.0 - 
29.0) days, respectively. The coefficient for treatment effect for NexoBrid vs SOC arm was -1.44 (95% 
CI: -2.30 to -0.58). 
Time to complete wound closure at the patient level in NexoBrid treated patients was comparable 
between the CIDS study (FAS population) and pooled paediatric population (safety population). In the 
paediatric pooled population, the time to reach complete (>95%) wound closure on a TW level was 
comparable in the NexoBrid and SOC treatment arms. The Kaplan-Meier estimated median time to 
complete wound closure for NexoBrid and SOC on a TW level (clustered data of TWs in a patient), was 31 
(95% CI: 27.0 - 36.0) days and 31 (95% CI: 24.0 - 37.0) days, respectively. The coefficient for 
treatment effect for NexoBrid vs SOC arm was -2.20 (95% CI: -3.56 to -0.85). 
Cosmesis and function (MVSS) at 12 months from wound closure was an efficacy endpoint in the 
paediatric CIDS study. Supporting these results, MVSS score was evaluated as a safety endpoint in adult 
patients in the adult DETECT study. NexoBrid showed advantage over SOC in both studies. 
Retrospective study 35-98-910 
A total of 154 patients were included in the retrospective study 35-98-910. Of these, 75 patients (<16 
years) were included in paediatric population. In Study MW2008-09-03 three (3) were paediatric patients.   
In the NexoBrid arm, the mean age (SD) was lower in the study 35-98-910 compared to paediatric 
pooled population (4.3 [3.7] vs. 6.5 [5.03] years). The majority of paediatric patients were males in both 
pooled pediatric population (52/87 [59.8%]) and study 35-98-910 (30/46 [65.2%]). The majority of 
patients in both paediatric pooled populations and study 35-98-910 had total treated wounds (all wounds) 
of ≤ 15% TBSA (90.8% vs. 98.7%) in the NexoBrid arm. 
In study 35-98-910, debridement was achieved in 92.0% of the area that was in contact with NexoBrid. 
In the NexoBrid arm, percent of eschar removed per TW was similar in the paediatric pooled population 
and study 35-98-910 (96.7% vs. 92.0%). 
The mean (SD) time to complete wound closure for NexoBrid and SOC on a TW level (clustered data of 
TWs in a patient), was 32.0 (16.29) days and 30.5 (16.96) days, respectively. The mean (SD) time to 
complete wound closure on a TW level was shorter in the Study 35-98-910 (21.4 [16.5] days) compared 
with the paediatric pooled population (32.0 [16.29] days). In Study MW2008-09-03, wound closure for all 
TWs was achieved after 29 days for 2 paediatric patients and after 61 days for 1 paediatric patient. 
Efficacy results were consistent in the paediatric populations of the controlled, open-label, and 
retrospective studies. 
Given the scarce PK data in the younger age group (0-3 years), the MAH proposed to revise SmPC section 
4.2 to reflect that for paediatric patients aged 0-3 years old, NexoBrid should not be applied to more than 
10% TBSA. This was agreed by CHMP. In addition, the results from the pivotal paediatric phase 3 study 
Assessment report 
EMA/560965/2023 
Page 57/87 
 
 
 
 
(CIDS) supporting the paediatric extension of indication were adequately added to SmPC section 5.1. The 
patient leaflet was updated accordingly. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical data from the pivotal CIDS  demonstrated clear superiority of NexoBrid over SOC in all three 
Co-Primary endpoints (‘median time to complete eschar removal’, ‘Percent wound area surgically excised 
for eschar removal’’ and Scar score MVSS at 12 months’) as well as the first secondary endpoint 
‘Incidence of surgical excision’.  
NexoBrid significantly reduces the amount of surgical excision of eschar required by burn wounds in 
paediatric patients in a significantly shorter period of time compared to SOC treatment.  
A subgroup analysis by age group (0 to 23 months, 24 months to 3 years, 0 to 3 years, 4 to 11 years, 
and 12 to 18 years) consistently demonstrated superiority of NexoBrid over SOC in each age group. The 
results demonstrate that NexoBrid effectively removes the eschar earlier than the SOC in all paediatric 
age groups. 
Furthermore, treatment with NexoBrid showed no deleterious effect on cosmesis and function at 12 
months post wound closure in paediatric patients. These results were consistently observed across all age 
groups studied. 
The analysis across studies (CIDS data vs. paediatric data from MW 2004-11-02) confirmed the clinical 
efficacy in the paediatric population and the comparison with clinical study data in adults (pooled data 
from DETECT, MW2004-11-02 and MW2002-04-01) showed comparable efficacy results of the CIDS data 
with the results in adults. 
The CHMP concluded that the efficacy data available supports the following indication:  
NexoBrid is indicated in all age groups for removal of eschar in patients with deep partial- and full-
thickness thermal burns. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The main safety data in support of the extension of indication of NexoBrid in the paediatric population 
comes from the pivotal phase 3 CIDS study. The results from the CIDS study are supported by the safety 
data from pooled paediatric studies with pooled adult study data from the (phase 2 and 3) studies: 
MW2001-10-03, MW2002-04-01, MW2005-10-05, MW2008-09-03, MW2004-11-02, and DETECT study 
(MW2010-03-02); and by the results of the retrospective study (35-98-910).  
Patient exposure 
Study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS) assessed the safety (and efficacy) of NexoBrid vs. SOC in paediatric 
patients 0 to 17 years of age. Of the 145 patients randomised, 139 (95.9%) patients were treated and 
included in the SAS: 69 (95.8%) in the NexoBrid arm and 70 (95.9%) in the SOC treatment arm.  
Of the patients randomised in the study, 132 patients (66 [91.7%] patients in the NexoBrid and 66 
[90.4%] in the SOC treatment arm) completed the 12 weeks post wound closure FU period (12W FU 
Period) and 129 patients (66 [91.7%] patients in the NexoBrid and 63 [86.3%] in the SOC treatment

arms) completed the 12M FU Period. The most common reasons for discontinuation from the study were 
“lost to follow-up” and “patient withdrew consent to continue in the study”. 
The distribution of the SAS to the age groups was for 0 - 23 Months: N=42 (NexoBrid: 20 vs. SOC: 22), 
for 24 Months – 3 Years: N=30 (NexoBrid: 15 vs. SOC: 15), for 4 – 11 Years: N=47 (NexoBrid: 25 vs. 
SOC: 22) and for 12 – 18 Years: N= 20 (NexoBrid: 9 vs. SOC: 11). 
The mean amount of NexoBrid administered in the CIDS study was 5.108 g (min.: 0.6 g – max.: 26.8 g). 
In the CIDS study, only 1 patient received 2 applications of NexoBrid (dose 16.8 g). Mean %TBSA of all 
TWs was similar for NexoBrid-patients (7.01% [SD 4.879]) vs. SOC-patients (6.20% [SD 4.777]). 
Adverse events 
The analysis of AEs in the CIDS study was based on the SAS consisting of 69 patients treated with 
NexoBrid vs. 70 patients treated with SOC (0 - 23 Months: N=42 [NexoBrid: 20 vs. SOC: 22], 24 Months 
– 3 Years: N=30 [NexoBrid: 15 vs. SOC: 15], 4 – 11 Years: N=47 [NexoBrid: 25 vs. SOC: 22] 12 – 18 
Years: N= 20 [NexoBrid: 9 vs. SOC: 11]). 
TEAEs were analysed separately for 3 different sub-periods:  
1. Until the 12 weeks follow-up (0-12W FU Period) 
2. Between the 12 weeks follow-up and the 12 months follow-up (including AEs from the first sub-period 
that were still ongoing) (12W-12M FU Period)  
3. In the cumulative period (0-12M FU Period). 
TEAEs in 0-12weeks Follow up Period 
In the 0-12W FU Period (up to the 12 weeks follow-up), 31/69 (44.9%) patients treated with NexoBrid, 
vs. 29/70 (41.4%) with SOC reported at least 1 TEAE. Most were mild to moderate; severe TEAEs were 
reported by 5 patients (4 for NexoBrid vs. 1 for SOC; Table 31). 
Table 31: Summary of incidence of TEAEs in the pivotal CIDS study– 0-12W FU Period (SAS) 
AEs reported in the 0-12W FU Period were also summarised by age group (0 - 23 months, 1 to 3 years, 0 
to 3 years, 4 to 11 years, and 12 - 18 years). There was a trend towards the incidence of AEs increasing 
with age in both treatment arms: ≥1 TEAE: 0 – 23 Months: NexoBrid: 5/20 (25%) vs. SOC: 5/22 
(22.7%); 1 -3 years: NexoBrid: 6/15 (40%) vs. SOC: 7/15 (46.7%); 4 - 11 years (NexoBrid: 14/25 
(56%) vs. SOC: 10/22 (45.5%); 12 - 18 years: NexoBrid: 6/9 (66.7%) vs. SOC: 7/11 (63.6%). In all 
age subgroups the incidence of AEs was similar for NexoBrid-patients vs. SOC-patients. There was no 
increase in the incidence of severe or serious TEAEs across age groups. 
Assessment report 
EMA/560965/2023

TEAEs reported for ≥2 patients for each treatment were as follows:  
• NexoBrid: pruritus (13.0% patients); pyrexia (10.1% p.); vomiting and wound complication (7.2% p. 
each); pain (5.8% p.); constipation, nasopharyngitis, and nausea (4.3% p. each); diarrhoea, ear 
infection, haemoglobin decreased, rash, and rhinovirus infection (2.9% p. each).  
• SOC: pruritus (10.0% p.); pain and wound complication (7.1% p. each); pyrexia (5.7% p.); anaemia, 
tachycardia, and vomiting (4.3% p. each); anxiety, blister, bromhidrosis, chills, diarrhoea, headache, 
nausea, and wound infection (2.9% p. each). 
Among the patients treated with NexoBrid who reported wound complication in the 0-12W FU Period, the 
reported terms included: ‘pseudo-eschar amount greater than expected’, ‘wound pain (during 
movement)’ and ‘itching around wound’.  
Among patients treated with the SOC who reported wound complication in the 0-12W FU Period, the 
reported terms included: ‘poor wound care requiring surgical intervention’ and  ‘itching of target/burn 
wound’.  
For the 2 patients (2.9%) treated with NexoBrid who experienced rash in the 0-12W FU Period, 1 event 
was assessed as treatment-related. Both rash TEAEs were local TW-related TEAEs. 
In the age group 0 – 3 years, TEAES reported for ≥2 patients for each treatment were as follows: 
•  NexoBrid: pyrexia 2/35 (5.7%), Nasopharyngitis 2/35 (5.7%), Wound complication 3/35 (8.6%), 
Pruritus 3/35 (8.6%). 
•  SOC: Anaemia 2/37 (5.4), Nasopharyngitis 2/37 (5.4%), Vomiting 2/37 (5.4%), Diarrhoea 2/37 
(5.4%), Cough 2/37 (5.4%). 
In the age group 4 – 11 years, TEAES reported for ≥2 patients for each treatment were as follows: 
•  NexoBrid: Pain 4/25 (16%), Pyrexia 4/25 (16%), Pruritus 5/25 (20%), Rash 2/25 (8%), Wound 
complication 2/25 (8%), Vomiting 4/25 (16.0%), Constipation 3/25 (12%), Nausea 3/25 (12%), Ear 
infection 2/25 (8%). 
•  SOC: Pyrexia 2/22 (9.1%), Chills 2/22 (9.1%), Pruritus 4/22 (18.2%), Bromhidrosis 2/22 (9.1%). 
In the age group 12 – 18 years, TEAES reported for ≥2 patients for each treatment were as follows: 
•  SOC: Pruritus 3/11 (27.3%), Tachycardia 2/11 (18.2%). 
For NexoBrid severe grade of TEAEs were noted for: Tachycardia (1), Vomiting (1), Pyrexia (2), Pain (1), 
Sepsis (1), UTI (1), Hypoalbuminaemia (1), Seizure (1), Tardive dyskinesia (1), anxiety (1), Sleep 
disorder (1), Pleural effusion (1), Pruritus (1), Rash (1), Hyperhidrosis (1) and Hypertension (1). 
For SOC severe grade TEAEs were noted for: Pyrexia (1), Chills (1), Vascular device infection (1), Pruritus 
(1) and Hyperhidrosis (1).

Table 32: Summary of TEAEs by System Organ Class, Preferred Term, and Maximum Intensity (Reported 
for ≥2 Patients in Either Treatment Arm) – 0-12W FU Period (SAS)
TEAEs in 12weeks-12months Follow up Period 
In the 12W-12M FU Period (time between 12 weeks and 12 months after wound closure), 7/69 (10.1%) 
NexoBrid-patients vs. 8/70 (11.4%) SOC-patients reported at least 1 TEAE. These included new events 
(starting during the 12W-12M FU Period) as well as continuing TEAEs from the 12W FU period. Most of 
the TEAEs were mild to moderate; 1 NexoBrid-patient reported a severe TEAE (Clavicle fracture; 4 to 11 
years). A serious TEAE was reported by 1 SOC-patient (concussion; 12 to 18 years). No patients with 
NexoBrid had a TEAE reported as related to the study drug (the investigator-assigned relationship was 
not collected for TEAEs for patients treated with the SOC). 
AEs reported in the 12W-12M FU Period were further summarised by age group:0 to 23 months 
(NexoBrid: 1/20 (5%), SOC: 2/22 (9.1%)), 1 - 3 years (NexoBrid: 2/15 (13.3%), SOC: 1/15 (6.7%)), 0 - 
3 years (NexoBrid: 3/35 (8.6%), SOC: 3/37 (8.1%)), 4 - 11 years (NexoBrid: 4/25 (16%), SOC: 1/22 
(4.5%)), and 12 - 18 years (NexoBrid: 0/9, SOC: 4/11 (36.4%)). There was no clear trend towards the 
incidence of AEs with age in both treatment arms.  
The only TEAE reported by ≥2 patients treated with NexoBrid was wound complication (reported terms of 
‘itching of target wound’ [mild] and ‘itching of target wounds’ [moderate] each reported by 1 patient). 
Assessment report 
EMA/560965/2023

The only TEAE reported by ≥2 patients treated with the SOC was nasopharyngitis (reported by 3 
patients). 
TEAEs in 0-12M FU Period 
The most frequent TEAEs during the 0-12M FU Period (reported for ≥5% patients in either treatment arm) 
were: 
• pruritus (9 patients (13%) with NexoBrid vs. 7 patients (10%) with SOC),  
• pyrexia (7 patients (10.1%) with NexoBrid vs. 4 patients (5.7%) with SOC),  
• wound complication: 
- 6 patients (8.7%) with NexoBrid (reported terms included: ‘pseudo eschar amount greater than 
expected’, ‘itching of target wounds’, ‘wound pain [during movement]’) and  
- 5 patients (7.1%) with SOC (reported terms included: ‘poor wound care requiring surgical intervention’ 
and ‘itching of target/burn wound),  
• pain (4 patients (5.8%) with NexoBrid vs. 5 patients (7.1%) with SOC) and  
• vomiting (5 patients (7.1%) with NexoBrid vs.4 patients (5.7%) with SOC). 
Treatment-related TEAEs in the 0-12weeks Follow up Period 
Relationship to treatment was not assessed for the SOC treatment arm. The only treatment related TEAEs 
reported by more than 1 NexoBrid-patient were pyrexia (4/69 patients, 5.8%) and wound complication 
(2/69 patients, 2.9%). 
There were no TEAEs considered to be related to NexoBrid during the 12W-12M FU Period. Therefore, the 
treatment-related TEAEs reported during the 0-12M FU Period were the same as those presented in Table 
32. 
Severe TEAEs of pyrexia and tachycardia were each reported by 1 (1.4%) NexoBrid-patient. The severe 
events of pyrexia and tachycardia were reported in the same patient in the 0-12W FU Period (Table 33).

Local TW-related TEAEs in the 0-12W FU Period 
The most frequently reported TW-related TEAEs for each treatment were as follows: 
• NexoBrid: wound complication (5/69 patients, 7.2%) and pruritus (3/69 patients, 4.3%)  
• SOC: wound complication and pruritus (5/70 patients, 7.1% each)  
Wound complications reported terms during the 0-12W FU Period included: NexoBrid: ‘wound pain’, 
‘itching target/burn wounds’, and ‘pseudo eschar amount greater than expected’ and SOC: ‘poor wound 
care requiring surgical intervention’ and ‘itching target/burn wound’. 
Local TW-related TEAEs in the 12W-12M FU Period 
Two patients in each treatment arm experienced local TW-related TEAEs during the 12W-12M FU Period; 
wound complication (reported terms of wound pain and pseudo eschar amount greater than expected) 
was reported for 2 patients treated with NexoBrid, and temperature intolerance and joint contracture 
were each reported by 1 patient treated with the SOC (Table 34).

SAEs  
Two NexoBrid-patients and 5 SOC-patients had SAEs during the 0-12W FU Period (Table 35). These were 
mild to moderate, except 1 patient treated with NexoBrid ( female, 14-months) who had severe 
tachycardia, pyrexia, and systemic inflammatory response (Sepsis). This event (reported within 24 hours 
after treatment) was assessed by the investigator as remotely related, and tachycardia and pyrexia were 
assessed as possibly related to NexoBrid. This SAE was later assessed by the DSMB to be not related to 
NexoBrid, but to a pre-existing respiratory infection and tachycardia. SAEs of pyrexia and tachycardia 
(both considered to be of severe intensity and possibly related to study treatment by the investigator) 
were also reported for this patient. The other SAE (Contracture of left axilla, 4-year-old male) was 
considered as not related to NexoBrid. Relationship to treatment was not assessed for the SOC treatment 
arm. 
Table 35: Summary of SAEs by System Organ Class, Preferred Term, and Maximum Intensity– 0-12W FU 
Period (SAS) 
Only 1 SOC-patient experienced SAEs during the 12W-12M FU Period, an injury and concussion, which 
were of moderate severity. 
Laboratory findings 
The most common shift in a biochemistry laboratory value was from a normal baseline to an abnormal 
high glucose level, which occurred in 13 (25.0%) NexoBrid-patients vs. 6 (13.3%) SOC-patients. When 
evaluated by type of eschar removal procedure, the % of patients with a shift from normal baseline to 
abnormal post baseline high glucose was lower with NexoBrid (46.4%) compared with first surgical SOC 
(55.6%) treatment. 
For electrolytes, the most common shift was from a normal baseline to abnormal low calcium levels, 
which occurred in 6 (11.5%) NexoBrid-patients vs. 0 SOC-patient. 
The following potentially clinically significant (PCS) shifts from normal baseline were observed:  
- Shift from normal to PCS low calcium (defined as <2 mmol/L and decrease ≥10%) for 1 (1.9%) 
NexoBrid-patients; No PCS shift in corrected calcium were observed.  
Assessment report 
EMA/560965/2023 
Page 65/87 
 
 
 
 
 
- Shift from normal to PCS high glucose (defined as >11.10 mmol/L and increase ≥2.78 mmol/L) for 1 
(1.9%) NexoBrid-patients (observed in a patient who received a glucose infusion prior to the laboratory 
assessment). 
The following PCS in haematology shifts from normal baseline were observed: 
- Shift from normal to PCS high neutrophils (defined as ≥20% upper limit of normal WBC upon age group 
and increase ≥ 10% from baseline) were observed for 4 (8.9%) NexoBrid-patients vs. 7 (17.5%) SOC-
patients. 
- Shift from normal baseline to PCS high leukocytes (defined as ≥20% age related threshold) reported for 
1 (2.1%) NexoBrid-patients vs. 2 (4.7%) SOC-patients. 
- Shift from normal baseline to PCS low leukocytes (defined as ≤20% age related lower threshold) 
reported for 1 (2.1%) NexoBrid-patients. 
- Shift from normal baseline to PCS high platelets (defined as >600 and increase >10%) reported for 1 
(2.6%) patient treated with SOC. 
There were no PCS shifts (as defined by the criteria in the SAP) in coagulation parameter values. 
Abnormal CS results for vital signs (Blood Pressure, Pulse, Respiratory Rate, and Body Temperature, as 
assessed by the investigator) were reported post baseline for 1 NexoBrid-patient at 4 days post dose 
(elevated temperature), and 1 SOC-patient (elevated temperature) at 5- and 7-days post dose. 
Overall, no NexoBrid-patients in either age group had a shift from normal to a CS abnormal pain 
assessment post-treatment. One SOC-patient >4 years of age had a shift from normal to a CS abnormal 
pain assessment post treatment, and 1 SOC-patient <4 years had a shift from an abnormal NCS to 
abnormal CS pain assessment post-treatment. Similar results were observed when excluding patients 
with hospital discharge before Day 7. 
Concomitant medication 
During the 0-12W FU Period, 100% (69/69) of NexoBrid-patients and 98.6% (69/70) of SOC-patients 
received at least 1 concomitant medication. The most commonly used (ATC Level 2) concomitant 
medications were analgesics used by 62/69 (89.9%) of NexoBrid-patients vs. 61/70 (87.1%) of SOC-
patients. There was a similar incidence rate for antibacterials for systemic use (41/69 [59.4%] in 
NexoBrid-patients vs. 39/70 [55.7%] treated with SOC). 
The mean overall (SD) systemic antibiotic use was 5.89 (7.34) days for NexoBrid-patients vs. 4.94 (7.04) 
days for SOC-patients. The mean (SD) prophylactic antibiotic use was 4.38 (6.33) days for NexoBrid-
patients vs. 4.31 (6.52) days for SOC-patients. The mean antibiotic use due to AE involvement was 1.80 
(4.90) days for NexoBrid vs. 0.52 (2.82) days for SOC. TEAEs in the infections and infestations system 
organ class were reported for 13 (18.8%) NexoBrid-patients vs. 6 (8.6%) SOC-patients during the 0-12W 
FU Period, and for 14 (20.3%) NexoBrid-patients vs. 9 (12.9%) SOC-patients during the 0-12M FU 
Period. Treatment-related infections and infestations were reported for 1 (1.4%) NexoBrid-patient and 0 
SOC-patient during the 0-12W and 0-12M FU period. 
Blood Transfusions 
Overall, 7 NexoBrid-patients vs. 8 SOC-patients received blood transfusions during hospitalisation. Among 
these 15 patients, 0 NexoBrid-patient vs. 5 SOC-patients received blood transfusion during eschar 
removal; 3 NexoBrid-patients vs. 1 SOC-patient received a blood transfusion within 1 week after eschar 
removal, and 4 NexoBrid-patients vs. 2 SOC-patients received a blood transfusion later than 1 week after 
the eschar removal.

Change in haemoglobin 
On a patient level the mean (SD) change in haemoglobin following eschar removal procedures was 0.21 
(8.714) g/L for NexoBrid-patients vs. 6.71 (13.415) g/dL for SOC-patients (p-value = 0.0201). On a 
procedure level, the mean (SD) blood loss using Hgb-change following eschar removal procedures was -
0.35 (8.135) g/dL for NexoBrid-patients vs. 5.05 (12.773) g/dL for SOC-patients (p-value = 0.0487). 
Rate of Hospital Readmission 
At least one hospital readmission was reported for 8 patients (11.6%) in both treatment arms. Unplanned 
hospital readmissions were reported for 2 patients (2.9%) each in both treatment arms. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No patient discontinued during or after treatment due to TEAEs (1 NexoBrid-patient withdrew due to an 
AE prior to treatment, according to Investigator decision and 1 NexoBrid-patient had fever and possible 
wound infection after randomisation; the PI decided not to treat according to the randomisation). 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses) 
The MAH compared TEAEs from the pooled paediatric studies with pooled adult study data from the 
(phase 2 and 3) studies: MW2001-10-03, MW2002-04-01, MW2005-10-05, MW2008-09-03, MW2004-11-
02, and DETECT study (MW2010-03-02).  
In the pooled studies (adult and paediatric patients, Table 36), most patients in all the arms had mild or 
moderate TAEs. One patient in the NexoBrid arm discontinued due to a TEAE.  
Seven patients died in the acute post wound closure phase (6 [2.0%] NexoBrid and 1 [0.5%] SOC). 
There were no TEAEs leading to death during the CIDS study (or in the pooled paediatric study data).  
The frequency of TEAEs in NexoBrid treated patients was lower in the CIDS study than in the pooled 
studies (adult and paediatric patients), 44.9% vs. 64.3%, respectively. The frequency of severe and 
serious TEAEs was lower in the CIDS study than in the pooled studies (5.8% vs. 11% of patients had 
severe TEAEs, and 2.9% vs. 8.3% of patients had serious TEAEs, respectively). Frequency of related 
TEAEs was higher in the CIDS study than in the pooled studies (13% vs. 9.7%). 
Table 36: Overview of Adverse Events – Pooled Studies (Adult and Paediatric Population) 
Assessment report 
EMA/560965/2023 
Page 67/87 
 
 
 
 
 
The frequency of TEAEs in NexoBrid treated patients was also lower in the CIDS study than in the pooled 
paediatric studies, 44.9% vs. 65%. The frequency of severe TEAEs was comparable between CIDS and 
the pooled studies (5.8% vs. 5%). The frequency of serious TEAEs was again lower in the CIDS study 
than in the pooled studies (2.9% vs. 5%). Frequency of related TEAEs in NexoBrid treated paediatric 
patients was higher in the CIDS study than in the pooled studies (13% vs. 5.0%). 
In the pooled studies the percentage of patients experiencing any TEAEs was similar in both treatment 
arms (NexoBrid: 13 [65.0%] vs. SOC: 9 [56.3%]).  
Table 37: Overall Summary of AEs, Subset of Pooled Studies from Cohort 1 (Paediatric Population Only) 
Cohort 1 (MW2008-09-03 and MW2004-11-02)   
Common Adverse Events 
In the CIDS study the most frequent TEAEs for each treatment were as follows:  
• NexoBrid: pruritus (13.0% patients); pyrexia (10.1% patients); vomiting and wound complication 
(7.2% patients each); pain (5.8% patients); constipation, nasopharyngitis, and nausea (4.3% patients 
each); diarrhoea, ear infection, haemoglobin decreased, rash, and rhinovirus infection (2.9% patients 
each).  
• SOC: pruritus (10.0% patients); pain and wound complication (7.1% patients each); pyrexia (5.7% 
patients); anaemia, tachycardia, and vomiting (4.3% patients each); 
In the pooled paediatric only data, the most frequent TEAEs (reported for ≥10% of NexoBrid-patients) 
were pruritus (30%), pyrexia (20%), vomiting (10%), anaemia (15%), nausea (15%), hyperthermia 
(15%), infection (10%), hypoalbuminaemia (10%), and rash (10%). 
Treatment-related Adverse Events 
In the CIDS study the only treatment related TEAEs reported by more than 1 patient treated with 
NexoBrid were pyrexia (4/69 patients, 5.8%) and wound complication (2/69 patients, 2.9%; reported 
terms of ‘pseudo eschar amount greater than expected’ [possibly related] and ‘wound complication’ 
[related] reported for 1 patient each). 
In the pooled adult and paediatric data related TEAEs were most frequently reported within the system 
organ class of General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions in the NexoBrid group (7.3%). By PT, 
related TEAEs reported by 3 or more patients in the NexoBrid group were pain (18/300, 6%), pyrexia 
(6/300, 2%), and tachycardia (3/300, 1%).

Local Treatment-emergent Adverse Events 
In the CIDS study, the most frequently reported TW-related TEAEs for each treatment were as follows: 
• NexoBrid: wound complication (5/69 patients, 7.2%) and pruritus (3/69 patients, 4.3%) 
• SOC: wound complication and pruritus (5/70 patients, 7.1% each) 
Wound complications reported terms during the 0-12W FU Period included ‘wound pain’, ‘itching target 
wounds’ and ‘pseudo eschar amount greater than expected’ for patients treated with NexoBrid, and poor 
‘wound care requiring surgical intervention’ and ‘itching wound/target wound’ in patients treated with 
SOC. 
In the pooled paediatric studies the most frequent TEAEs (reported for >5% patients in either treatment 
arm) were pruritus (30.0% NexoBrid and 6.3% SOC), wound infection (0 in NexoBrid and 18.8% SOC), 
skin graft failure (5.0% NexoBrid and 6.3% SOC), staphylococcal infection and wound decomposition (0 
in NexoBrid and 6.3% SOC each). 
SAEs 
In the CIDS study two patients treated with NexoBrid, and 5 patients treated with the SOC experienced 
SAEs during the 0-12W FU Period (NexoBrid: Tachycardia, Pyrexia, Systemic Inflammatory Response 
Syndrome (Sepsis; all in one patient) and Joint Contracture; SOC: Withdrawal Syndrome, Viral Infection, 
Injury, Procedural Pain, Wound Complication, Laryngospasm).  
In the pooled studies (adult and paediatric patients), the percentages of patients who experienced serious 
TEAEs were for NexoBrid: (8.3%; 25/300) and for SOC (6.2%; 12/195). SAEs were most frequently 
reported within the system organ class of Infections and Infestations for: NexoBrid (2.3%) vs. SOC 
(2.1%). 3 TEAEs were reported in more than 1 patient (5 patients with sepsis, 2 patients with wound 
infection, and 2 patients with deep vein thrombosis [NexoBrid group]); all other serious TEAEs by PT 
occurred in a single patient. By PT, there were no overlapping SAEs between NexoBrid treated patients in 
the CIDS study and in the pooled studies. 
In the pooled paediatric studies one patient (5.0%) treated with NexoBrid (Wound complications) and 2 
patients (12.5%) treated with the SOC (Wound infection, Wound decomposition) experienced SAEs. 
Pain 
In the CIDS study, the incidence of TEAEs associated with pain related to TW occurring during the 0-12W 
FU period was 4.3% in both the NexoBrid and SOC treatment arms. 
In the pooled studies (adult and paediatric patients), in the NexoBrid group, the frequency of overall pain 
events by combined PTs after implementation of preventive measures was similar with NexoBrid (4%), 
vs. SOC (3.8%). 
Pyrexia 
The incidence of TEAEs associated with fever by PT (pyrexia, hyperthermia, and body temperature 
increased) during the 0-12W FU period in the CIDS study was 11.6% in the NexoBrid arm vs. 5.7% with 
SOC. 
In the pooled studies (adult and paediatric patients) after implementation of preventive measures the 
frequency of pyrexia was for NexoBrid (12.1%) vs. SOC (8.1%). 
Wound Infection 
In the CIDS study, the frequency of ‘any TW associated with TW infection’ was 1.4% in the NexoBrid arm 
vs. 4.3% for SOC. 
Assessment report 
EMA/560965/2023 
Page 69/87 
 
 
 
 
Post-implementation of preventive measures, in pooled studies (adult and paediatric population) the 
frequencies of patients with infection were similar in the NexoBrid and SOC groups (Infection: 5.4% vs. 
8.1%, respectively; Fungal Infection: 1.3% vs. 0%, respectively). 
Sepsis 
In the CIDS study, 1 NexoBrid-patient had SAEs with signs of sepsis (considered to be of severe intensity 
and remotely related to study treatment by the investigator). This SAE was assessed by the DSMB to be 
not related to NexoBrid, but to a pre-existing respiratory infection and tachycardia. 
In the pooled Phase 3 studies post-implementation of preventive measures, the frequencies for any 
sepsis TEAE were: NexoBrid (2.8%) vs. SOC (2.0%). 
Upon CHMP’s request, the MAH has provided a detailed comparison with pooled adult and paediatric data. 
The incidence of TEAEs in the paediatric NexoBrid-pool was lower compared to the adult NexoBrid-pool 
(paediatric p. 49.4% vs. adults 64.3%). Also, SAEs in the paediatric NexoBrid-pool was lower vs. the 
adult NexoBrid-pool (paediatric p. 3.4% vs. adults 8.6%). The same applies for severe TEAEs (paediatric 
p. 5.6% vs. adults 11.4%). Sepsis related SAEs were recorded for 3 (3.4%) in pooled paediatric 
NexoBrid-p. (vs. 1 p. (1.2%) with SOC) compared to 12 (4.3%) in pooled adult NexoBrid-p. (vs. 4 p. 
(1.5%) with SOC-p. vs. 2 p. (2.9%) with Gel-p.). 
The number of related TEAEs was similar between the paediatric vs. the adult NexoBrid-population 
(11.2% vs. 10.0%). Frequency of local TW-related TEAEs was lower in the pooled paediatric NexoBrid 
group vs. paediatric SOC group (24.7% vs. 27.9% in SOC). Local pain incidence was equal to SOC (2.2% 
vs. 2.3%) as was incidence of wound complications (5.6% vs. 5.8% in SOC). Only 1 wound infection was 
reported in NexoBrid paediatric patients (1.1 vs. 8.1% in SOC). Pruritus was reported slightly more often 
with NexoBrid vs. SOC (10.1% vs. 7.0%). 
There were some differences in frequencies of AEs of special interest between the paediatric and the adult 
pool. Lower frequencies in the paediatric population were noted for: tachycardia, pain and wound 
infection. Higher frequencies were noted for hyperthermia/fever (when compared to adults after 
implementation of local antibiotic measures), hypalbuminaemia and rash. Equal frequency was presented 
for anaemia. There were no new safety signals in the paediatric population. 
TEAE Analysis per age group and dose 
Upon CHMP’s request, t MAH provided additional pooled analyses (including CIDS data) of TEAEs (up to 
12 weeks after wound closure) per age group and dose (dose ≤Median vs. dose >Median):  
Incidence of ‘Any TEAE’ per age group and dose (dose ≤Median vs. dose >Median):  
Age group: 0 to 3 Years: dose ≤Median: 4 of 18  (22.2%) vs. dose >Median 7 of 16 (43.8%) (factor 3); 
Age group: 4 to 11 Years: dose ≤Median: 7 of 13 (53.8%) vs. dose >Median 7 of 11 (63.6%) (factor 3);  
Age group: 12 to 18 Years: dose ≤Median: 3 of 5 (60.0%) vs. dose >Median 3 of 5  (60.0%).  
This comparison shows an imbalance in incidence of any TEAE with dose in the younger two age groups 
(factor 3) as compared to the age group of 12–18-year-olds, where dose did not influence the incidence 
rate (although the number of subjects was very low in the oldest age group, limiting the interpretability). 
Comparison for ‘Any SAE’: 
Age group: 0 to 3 Years: dose ≤Median: 0 vs. dose >Median: 1;  
Age group: 4 to 11 Years: dose ≤Median: 0 vs. dose >Median: 1; 
Age group: 12 to 18 Years: dose ≤Median: 0 vs. dose >Median: 0; 
Assessment report 
EMA/560965/2023 
Page 70/87 
 
 
 
 
Numbers per age group are too small to draw any conclusion with regards to SEAs, but results do not 
oppose the finding above with ‘Any TEAE’ (or with the other categories below) either. 
Comparison for ‘Related TEAEs’: 
Age group: 0 to 3 Years: dose ≤Median: 0 vs. dose >Median: 6 (17.6%) (factor >3);  
Age group: 4 to 11 Years: dose ≤Median: 2 of 13 (15.4%) vs. dose >Median: 2 of 12 (16.7%); 
Age group: 12 to 18 Years: dose ≤Median: 1 vs. dose >Median: 0; 
For the youngest age group 0 to 3 years, the trend to a higher incidence with dose > median is 
corroborated here, but not so for the older age group 4-11 years (nor for the oldest age group). 
Comparison for ‘Special TEAEs’ (Pain, Fever, Target Wound Infection): 
Age group: 0 to 3 Years: dose ≤Median: 1 (5.6%) vs. dose >Median 2 (11.8%); (factor 2.1) 
Age group: 4 to 11 Years: dose ≤Median: 4 (30.8%) vs. dose >Median 4 (33.3%);  
Age group: 12 to 18 Years: dose ≤Median: 2 (40.0%) vs. dose >Median 0.  
For the youngest age group 0 to 3 years, the trend to a higher incidence with dose > median is again 
corroborated here. 
Comparison for ‘General TEAEs’:  
Age group: 0 to 3 Years: dose ≤Median: 2 (11.1%) vs. dose >Median 5 (29.4%) (factor 2.6); 
Age group: 4 to 11 Years: dose ≤Median: 4 (30.8%) vs. dose >Median 7 (58.3%);  
Age group: 12 to 18 Years: dose ≤Median: 3 (60.0%) vs. dose >Median 2 (40%). 
For the youngest age group 0 to 3 years, the trend to a higher incidence with dose > median is 
corroborated here again. 
Supportive clinical safety study 
Retrospective study 35-98-910 
The results from the CIDS study are supported by the results of the retrospective study (35-98-910) 
which included 13 patients in the age of 0-12 months treated over 0.5% -12% TBSA. The incidence of 
any TEAE in this age group was 76.9% (10/13), slightly higher than in the 0-23 months (69.2%) and 2-3 
years age groups (66.7%), but lower than in the older paediatric age groups (92% for 4-11years and 
87.5% for 12-18 years) and in the pooled paediatric (77.5%) and adult patients (83.8%) that 
participated in the retrospective study. 
Adverse Events (AEs) in the retrospective study assessed as possibly/probably related to NexoBrid in the 
0-12 months age group were fever in 4 patients and pain in one patient. These AEs with reasonable 
possibility to NexoBrid of fever and pain are similar to the known Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) in the 
other age groups in the pooled paediatric population as well as in adults and are included in Section 4.8 
of the SmPC. The retrospective study was performed before preventive measures for pain and pyrexia 
(preventive analgesia and soaking) were implemented. Severe AEs were reported in only one patient: 
Sepsis and Acute respiratory distress syndrome in the 0-12 months age group. Both were assessed as not 
related to the study drug.  
Serious AEs were reported in 2 patients aged of 0-12 months, both assessed as not related to the study 
drug: one patient had fever and the second patient had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and

sepsis, that started between 24-72 hours following eschar removal treatment and was assessed as not 
related to the study drug. In total, serious AEs were reported in 4/80 (5%) of paediatric patients in the 
retrospective study (2 patients in the 0-12 months (15.4%) and 2 patients in the 4-11 years age group), 
and in 6/74 (8.1%) of adult patients. The common TEAEs in the age group 0-12 months were: 
Anaemia: this was reported with a higher percentage in the 0-12 months age group, reported in 3/13 
treated subjects (23.1%). All AEs of anaemia were assessed as not related to study drug.  
Pain and pyrexia: incidence rates were reported with higher percentage in the 0-12 months age group 
compared to the 0-23 months and 2-3years age groups, but lower or similar to the older paediatric age 
groups, and in adults.  
Diarrhea and Upper respiratory tract infection: these common occurrences in the young paediatric 
population were reported with higher incidence in the 0-12 months age group, but no conclusions can be 
drawn due to the small numbers of patients.  
No new safety concern associated with the 0-3 years age group was observed.  
Post marketing experience 
There is also ‘off-label’ data available for paediatric patients. 
Using the MedDRA PT off label use as a search criterion, 49 case reports from the post marketing sources 
for the paediatric population were retrieved from MediWound’s global safety database until 17 December 
2021. 
These case reports described the following types of off label use: Use in paediatric patients (40 case 
reports), Use in paediatric patients on more than 15% TBSA (5 case reports), Use in paediatric patients 
with chemical burns (2 case reports), Use in paediatric patients with electrical burns (2 case reports). 
Two case reports of use of NexoBrid in paediatric patients also reported ADRs of ‘drug ineffective’, ‘pain’, 
‘muscle twitching’ and ‘therapeutic response decreased’. 
In general, the AE profile of adult and paediatric patients seen in the published literature was similar to 
that seen in clinical studies. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Based on the safety data submitted to support this extension of indication to the paediatric population, 
166 children were treated with NexoBrid during the paediatric development programme: 
•  CIDS study: 69 children from birth to < 18 years 
•  Study MW2012-01-02 = extension study of Study MW2004-11-02: 17 children from 4 to < 18 
years 
• 
• 
Phase 1/2 retrospective Study 35-98-910 (which was not a part of the PIP): 77 children, age 
range not specified 
Phase 2 MW2008-09-03 study, 3 children, age range not specified. 
In the CIDS study, the number of exposed subjects in the safety analysis set (SAS) was small in the two 
treatment arms (NexoBrid vs. SOC: N=69 vs. N=70). The numbers in the age groups were even smaller: 
0 - 23 months: N=42 (NexoBrid: 20 vs. SOC: 22); 24 months – 3 years: N=30 (NexoBrid: 15 vs. SOC: 
15); 4 – 11 Years: N=47 (NexoBrid: 25 vs. SOC: 22) and 12 – 18 years: N= 20 (NexoBrid: 9 vs. SOC: 
11). However, the numbers of patients as agreed in the PIP were met.

TEAEs in the 0-12 Week Follow-Up Period 
As expected, more patients experienced TEAEs within 0 to 12 weeks following wound closure compared 
with the FU period between 12 weeks and 12 months, with incidences that were generally similar 
between the NexoBrid and SOC treatment arms (at least 1 TEAE NexoBrid: 44.9% vs. SOC: 41.4%). 
Overall, the number of patients who experienced SAEs was low in both the NexoBrid and SOC treatment 
arms (NexoBrid: 2/69, 2.9% vs. SOC: 5/70, 7.1%) and the majority were of mild to moderate severity.  
Upon CHMP’s request, the MAH has provided a discussion on severe AEs. Eighteen severe AEs in the first 
3 months were reported in 4 NexoBrid-patients vs. 5 severe AEs were reported in 1 SOC-patient (CIDS 
study). 
Analysis of the case narratives revealed that most AEs graded as severe were reported in one study site. 
No relation to age of the patients was connected to the severity classification. Most severe AEs were not 
related to treatment, excluding fever and tachycardia (reported in 1 patient) which are already included 
in section 4.8 of the SmPC as ADR. These are no new safety signals. 
One patient in the NexoBrid treatment arm had SAEs that were considered as remotely related by the 
investigator (severe systemic inflammatory response, Sepsis) and possibly related to NexoBrid (severe 
tachycardia and severe pyrexia). The SAE of sepsis was assessed again by the DSMB and found to be not 
related to NexoBrid, but to a pre-existing respiratory infection and tachycardia.  
The incidence of TW-related TEAEs was similar in the NexoBrid and SOC treatment arms during this 
period NexoBrid: 21.7%. vs. SOC: 24.3%.  
The most frequent TEAEs in the NexoBrid treatment arm included pruritus (not TW-related TEAEs [6 
patients] and local TW-related TEAEs [3 patients]), pyrexia, vomiting, wound complication (including 
terms of ‘pseudo eschar amount greater than expected’, ‘itching target wounds’, ‘wound pain’), and pain. 
The most frequent TEAEs in the SOC treatment arm included pruritus (not TW-related TEAEs [3 patients] 
and local TW-related TEAEs [4 patients]), pain, wound complication (including ‘poor wound care requiring 
surgical intervention’, ‘intermittent itching wound’), and pyrexia.  
The most frequently reported treatment related TEAEs in NexoBrid-patients during the 0-12W FU Period 
were pyrexia and wound complications (including reported terms of ‘pseudo eschar amount greater than 
expected’ and ‘wound pain’ in 1 patient each). 
The most frequently reported TW related TEAEs in both the NexoBrid and SOC treatment arms were 
wound complications (‘wound pain’, ‘wound itching’ and ‘pseudo eschar amount greater than expected’ 
for patients treated with NexoBrid, and ‘wound itching’, and ‘poor wound care requiring surgical 
intervention’ in patients treated with the SOC) and local TW-related pruritus. 
The incidence of (preferred term) pain in the 0-12W FU period was similar in the NexoBrid and SOC 
treatment arms during the 0-12W FU Period (4.3% for both groups). 
Fever was evaluated as an AESI during the study and included the PTs of pyrexia, hyperthermia, and 
body temperature increased. The incidence of ‘any fever TEAEs’ was (NexoBrid vs. SOC) 11.6% vs. 5.7% 
respectively. 
The incidence of TEAEs associated with TW infections were evaluated as an AESI in the study and 
included the PTs of TW infections, wound infection, or culture wound positive. The frequency of ‘any TW-
associated TEAE’ was (NexoBrid vs. SOC) 1.4% vs. 4.3%. 
In the CIDS-study there was an imbalance between treatment groups for pyrexia-related TEAEs and 
infections. In the pooled paediatric population, the incidence of TEAEs related to fever was 15 (16.9%) 
with NexoBrid vs. 8 (9.3%) with SOC. In 12/15 NexoBrid-p. the fever onset was by Day 3 (vs. 6/8 in 
Assessment report

SOC-p.). Pyrexia/hyperthermia is already included as an ADR in SmPC section 4.8 with a frequency ‘very 
common’. Also, there is nodditional risk for the paediatric (sub) populations. In the paediatric population 
occurrence of fever was lower compared to the pooled adult population (16.9% vs. 19.3%). 
In the paediatric pooled analysis, there was a lower incidence of local target wound related infections with 
NexoBrid compared to SOC (1 [1.1%] vs. 7 [8.1] with SOC). In the CIDS–study it was 1 vs. 3 in SOC. 
Other, not TW related infections were recorded with similar frequencies in the NexoBrid and SPC-groups 
and occurred mostly at time points well beyond the period of time where NexoBrid could have an 
influence (NexoBrid vs. SOC: 18 (20.2%) vs. 13 (15.1%)). 
TEAEs in in the 12W-12M FU Period 
For this period, the incidence of TEAEs was low and was similar for the NexoBrid and SOC treatment arms 
(10.1% vs. 11.4%). Most TEAEs were mild to moderate, with severe AEs reported in 1 patient treated 
with NexoBrid (Clavicle fracture). TEAE PTs reported for more than 1 patient included ‘wound 
complication’ reported for 2 patients treated with NexoBrid and ‘nasopharyngitis’ reported for 3 patients 
treated with the SOC.  
No patient treated with NexoBrid, and 1 SOC-patient (injury and concussion) had SAEs during the 12W-
12M FU Period. Two patients in each treatment arm had local TW-related AEs during this period. These 
included wound complication (‘wound pain’ and ‘pseudo eschar amount greater than expected’) reported 
for 2 NexoBrid-patients, and ‘temperature intolerance’ and ‘joint contracture’ for 1 patient each treated 
with SOC. 
In the clinical study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS), one patient experienced an epileptic seizure in the NexoBrid 
treatment arm (1/69, 1.45%) 24-72 hours after NexoBrid treatment (as was observed in pre-clinical 
studies, see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
Upon CHMP’s request, the MAH submitted a concise analysis of the case. In the pooled paediatric and 
adult studies, 5 adult NexoBrid-patients and 1 paediatric patient had AEs of PT ‘Seizure or Epilepsy’ vs. 1 
adult patient in the placebo group. In 4 out of the 5 NexoBrid-patients the AEs occurred between 14 to 79 
days after NexoBrid application, well beyond the elimination time for the drug. In the paediatric patient, 
the seizure occurred 56 hours after NexoBrid application. Three of the patients had two episodes of 
seizures long after NexoBrid treatment, which implies a relationship other than the drug exposure. 
One seizure was a pseudo convulsion implying psychogenic etiology; 1 was a very short unclear neural 
episode (with possible relationships to Methamphetamine withdrawal); 2 of the NexoBrid-patients had a 
medical history of epilepsy.  
Therefore, the MAH concluded that there is no reasonable relationship between NexoBrid treatment and 
the convulsions in both paediatric and adults, this was accepted by the CHMP. 
Systemic Antibiotic Use 
The mean number of days of systemic antibiotic use (including for prevention, pre-treatment conditions, 
and treatment of TEAEs) was similar for both groups (NexoBrid vs. SOC): 5.89 days vs. 4.94 days. 
Blood transfusions 
Overall, only 7 patients (NexoBrid) vs. 8 patients (SOC) received blood transfusions during 
hospitalisation. No NexoBrid-patient vs. 5 SOC-patients received blood transfusion during the eschar 
removal period. Three NexoBrid-patients vs. 1 SOC-patient received a blood transfusion within 1 week 
after eschar removal period, and 4 NexoBrid-patients vs. 2 SOC-patients received a blood transfusion 
later than 1 week after the eschar removal period.

Hospital readmissions 
The rates of hospital readmission were low in both the NexoBrid and SOC treatment arms, reported for 8 
patients in both treatment arms. Unplanned hospital readmissions were reported for 2 patients in both 
treatment arms. 
Analyses performed across trials (pooled analyses) 
The comparisons presented cover the CIDS study data vs. pooled adult plus paediatric data and vs. 
pooled paediatric data from (MW2008-09-03 and MW2004-11-02).  
Upon CHMP’s request, the MAH has provided a pooled analysis of paediatric safety data vs. pooled adult 
safety data from controlled studies. This comprised 89 paediatric NexoBrid-patients vs. 86 SOC-patients 
and 280 adult NexoBrid-patients vs. 179 adult SOC-patients (and 58 adult Gel vehicle patients). The 
mean exposure was much lower in the pooled paediatric population (5.6g [±5.93g]; median 3.7g, min–
max: 1–27g) compared to the pooled adult population (15.7g [±10.4g]; median 12.0g, min–max: 2–
60g). Mean total TBSA-area of TWs in the paediatric pool was also much lower (7.2 % [±4.83]; median 
6.0%, min–max: 0.24–24%) compared to the adult pool (12.8 % [±7.22]; median 11.0%, min–max: 1–
39%). 
Pooled analysis showed that no deaths occurred in the paediatric study population (vs. 6 in the adult 
NexoBrid-population). The incidence of TEAEs in the paediatric NexoBrid-pool was lower compared to the 
adult NexoBrid-pool (paediatric patients 49.4% vs. adults 64.3%).  
In addition, SAEs in the paediatric NexoBrid-pool was lower compared to the adult NexoBrid-pool 
(paediatric patients 3.4% of p. vs. adults 8.6% of p.). The same applies for severe TEAEs (kids 5.6% of 
p. vs. adults 11.4% of p.). The number of patients with related TEAEs was similar in the paediatric 
NexoBrid-population (11.2% of p.) vs. the adult NexoBrid-population (10.0% of p.). Treatment relation 
was not established for any TEAE in the SOC arm. 
There was one serious case of sepsis related TEAE in the NexoBrid group. 
Sepsis related SAEs were recorded for 3 (3.4% [‘common’]) of pooled paediatric NexoBrid-p. (vs. 1 p. 
(1.2%) with SOC) compared to 12 (4.3%) [‘common’] in pooled adult NexoBrid-p. (vs. 4 p. (1.5%) with 
SOC-p. vs. 2 p. (2.9%) with Gel-p.). The MAH considered that for sepsis related SAEs the difference in 
numbers in the paediatric population is small (Any Sepsis TEAEs: NexoBrid: 3/89 (3.4%) vs. SOC: 1/86 
(1.2%)). In adults, frequencies were higher as compared to children (Any Sepsis TEAEs with NexoBrid: 
12/280 (4.3%) vs. SOC 3/179 (1.7%) vs. Placebo 2/68 (2.9%). The difference between treatment groups 
were again small. Based on the available data, the CHMP agreed that sepsis should not be included in 
SmPC section 4.8 as an adverse drug reaction. 
TEAEs considered related to NexoBrid treatment/local TW related TEAEs in the pooled paediatric 
population were: pruritus (9 [10.1%] ‘very common’), wound complication (5 [5.6%] ‘common’), pyrexia 
(4 [4.5%] ‘common’) and pain (5 [5.6%] ‘common’). In the adult pool these were: pain (17 [6.1%] 
‘common’), wound infection/cellulitis (17 [6.3%] ‘common’), pruritus (17 [6.2%] ‘common’), wound 
complications (9 [3.3%] ‘common’), pyrexia (6 [2.1%] ‘common’), tachycardia (3 [1.1%] ‘common’) and 
rash (2 [0.7%] ‘uncommon’). 
Compared to SOC, frequencies (in numbers of patients affected) in the pooled paediatric analysis of any 
TEAEs was slightly higher in NexoBrid-patients (54.3% vs.49.4 % of p. with SOC), but severe TEAEs 
occurred at similar frequencies (5.6% vs. 4.7% in SOC) and number of patients with serious TEAEs were 
lower with NexoBrid (3 [3.4%] vs. 7 [8.1%] in SOC. 
Frequency of local TW-related TEAEs was lower in the pooled paediatric NexoBrid group vs. paediatric 
SOC group (24.7% vs. 27.9% in SOC). Local pain incidence was equal to SOC (2.2% vs. 2.3%) as was 
Assessment report 
EMA/560965/2023 
Page 75/87 
 
 
 
 
incidence of wound complications (5.6% vs. 5.8% in SOC). Only 1 wound infection was reported in 
NexoBrid paediatric patients (1.1 vs. 8.1% in SOC). Pruritus was reported slightly more often with 
NexoBrid vs SOC (10.1% vs. 7.0%). 
In the pooled paediatric population, there were 3 patients with TEAE hypoalbuminemia reported in the 
NexoBrid arm vs. none with SOC.  
In addition, the following related shifts were presented by the MAH (shift from normal to low) for the 
CIDS study: Albumin: 3/46 (6.5%) in the SOC group, Globulin: 3/52 (5.8%) in the NexoBrid Group, 
Protein: 1/52(1.9%) in the NexoBrid group and 3/46 (6.5%) in the SOC group. No potentially clinical 
significant shift was observed in the NexoBrid arm in the pooled paediatric population, vs. one patient 
(3.6%) in the SOC arm. When comparing the Lab shift for the pooled paediatric population, frequencies 
for low albumin post treatment were similar for NexoBrid vs. SOC (20.9% in NexoBrid arm vs. 17.9% 
with SOC). Therefore, it was agreed that hypoalbuminemia should not be included in section 4.8 as an 
ADR. 
TEAE Analysis per age group and dose 
The analyses of incidences of TEAEs per age group and dose (dose ≤Median vs. >Median dose) show, 
that - especially in the youngest age group (of children 0-3 years of age) - incidences of ‘Any TEAE’, 
‘Related TEAEs’, ‘Special TEAEs’ (Pain, Fever, Target Wound Infection) and ‘General TEAEs’ were 
distinctively higher in the >Median dose subgroup of patients 0-3 years of age, as compared to the 
≤Median dose subgroup. This was not the case in the older age groups. Therefore, this imbalance cannot 
only be attributed to more severe disease (in the subgroup > Median dose). 
In combination with the additional PK data analyses (correlation of age with Cmax/dose and age with AUC0-
4 / dose, see assessment of OCs 2-3 above), which suggest higher Cmax/dose and higher AUC0-4/dose 
values for the youngest children (0-3 years), the imbalance in TEAE-rates by dose and age group - 
especially for ‘Related TEAEs’ and Local TEAEs - cannot be ignored, even though the database is very 
small and given the scares PK data. Due to the overall small number of paediatric patients, conclusions 
cannot be drawn reliably.  
Overall, based on the limited PK and safety data, the CHMP agreed with the MAH’s proposal i.e. children 
0-3 years of age can be safely treated up to 10% TBSA and children over 4 years of age can be safely 
treated up to 15% TBSA. The section 4.2 Posology of the SmPC (subsection ‘Paediatric population’) has 
been updated accordingly. 
Retrospective study 35-98-910 
The retrospective study was conducted between the years 1985 to 2000. After termination, preventive 
measures for pyrexia and pain were installed. In this study safety data are available for 80 
children/adolescents in the following age groups: 0-23 months (N=26), 2-3 years (N=21), 0-3 years 
(N=47), 4-11 years (N=25), 12-18 years (N=8). In the Retrospective Study, the frequency of ‘any TEAEs’ 
was lower in the paediatric patients than in the adult patients (77.5% vs. 83.8%).  
For the age groups ‘any TEAE’ was observed: 0-12months: 10 (76.9%), 0-23 months: 18 (69.2%), 2-3 
years: 14 (66.7%), 0-3 years: 32 (68.1%), 4-11 years: 23 (92.0%) and 12-18 years: 7 (87.5%). The 
incidence of ‘any TEAE’ was higher in the older age groups > 3 years compared to the age group 0 to 3 
years, however the youngest 0-1 year olds had a higher incidence compared to the children of 1-2 and 2-
3 years of age. 
Frequency of ‘Any TEAEs’ in NexoBrid-treated paediatric patients was lower in the pooled paediatric 
population than in the Retrospective Study (49.4% vs. 77.5%). By age groups, frequency of ‘Any TEAEs’ 
in NexoBrid-treated paediatric patients was (pooled paediatric population vs. Retrospective Study): 0 to 3 
years: 31.4% vs. 68.1%; 4 to 11 years: 64.9% vs. 92.0%; and 12 to 18 years: 52.9% vs. 87.5%. 
Assessment report 
EMA/560965/2023 
Page 76/87 
 
 
 
 
The most frequent TEAEs (reported for ≥5% NexoBrid-treated paediatric patients in either pooled aediatric 
population or Retrospective Study) were: pyrexia (pooled paediatric population: 12.4% vs. Retrospective 
Study: 68.8%); pain (5.6% vs. 22.5%); pruritus (16.9% vs. 6.3%); vomiting (7.9% vs. 10.0%); 
anaemia (3.4% vs. 8.8%); sepsis (1.1% vs. 8.8%); nausea (6.7% vs. 0%); diarrhoea (3.4% vs. 6.3%) 
and wound complication (5.6% vs. 0%). 
By age groups of paediatric patients in the Retrospective Study (0 to 3 years, 4 to 11 years, and 12 to 18 
years), there were few events by PT reported in ≥5 patients: pyrexia (57.4%), anaemia (12.8%), and 
pain (12.8%) in the age group 0 to 3 years; pyrexia (84.0%), pain (36.0%), and vomiting (20.0%) in the 
age group 4 to 11 years; and pyrexia (87.5%) in the age group 12 to 18 years. 
Overall, the safety data from the retrospective study did not show any new safety concern. Higher 
frequencies in the retrospective study can be explained by the preventive measures for pyrexia and pain, 
which were installed only after the termination of the retrospective study. 
Taking into consideration the methodological limitations related to the design of retrospective studies, 
safety results from study 35-98-910 are only considered to be supportive.  
Based on information from MW-2012-01-01 paediatric CIDS study, the following changes to the SmPC 
section 4.8 of the SmPC were agreed:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
‘Wound infection’ ADR was revised to include ‘cellulitis’. 
Local pruritus related to TW was more frequent with NexoBrid in all age groups 0-11 years of age. 
Therefore, the frequency of the ADR ‘local pruritus’ was changed from uncommon to common.  
‘local rash’ was added as a common ADR because the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions, 
including allergic reactions and cases of rash, was approximately 5% (4/69) of NexoBrid treated 
patients; 2/69 were considered related. 
‘intradermal hematoma’ was added as a new ADR with a frequency uncommon. 
In addition, the information on description of selective ARs and on paediatric were updated based on the 
data submitted as part of this application.  
Exclusion (safety) criteria in clinical studies included exclusion of patients with history of allergy and/or 
known sensitivity to pineapples, papaya, Bromelain, or papain. Therefore, the SmPC section 4.3 was 
updated accordingly (as papain occurs also in papaya).  
Upon CHMP’s request, the following information ‘the medicinal product should be used with caution in 
areas or varicose veins, to prevent erosion of the veins’ wall and the risk of bleeding.’ was shifted from 
SmPC section 4.2 to SmPC section 4.4. as it relates to special warning and precaution. 
The existing warning on systemic absorption in SmPC section 4.4. was updated to reflect that NexoBrid 
should not be applied to more than 10% or 15% TBSA in patients aged 0-3 years old and patients 4-18 
years, respectively.  
The patient leaflet was updated accordingly.  
The MAH committed to submit the final CSR for the CIDS study for assessment, once available (by Q2 
2024).

EMA/560965/2023 
Page 77/87 
 
 
 
 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Based on the limited PK and safety results, children 0-3 years of age can be safely treated up to 10% 
TBSA and children over 4 years of age can be safely treated up to 15% TBSA. The section 4.2 Posology of 
the SmPC (subsection ‘Paediatric population’) has been updated accordingly. 
Additional ADRs ‘cellulitis’, ‘local rash’, ‘local pruritus’ and ‘intradermal haematoma’ were added in section 
4.8 of the SmPC based on information from MW2012-01-01 Paediatric study (CIDS).  
Considering the limited safety data available, the MAH committed to submit the final results of the CIDS 
study for assessment once available (i.e., by Q2 2024). In addition, the PSUR cycle for NexoBrid was 
reduced to a yearly cycle to allow a closer safety follow-up of the paediatric patients in the post-approval 
setting.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
Based on the limited safety data on the new paediatric indication, the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
already existing entry in the EURD list for concentrate of proteolytic enzymes enriched in bromelain needs 
to be amended as follows: the PSUR cycle for the medicinal product should follow a yearly cycle. The next 
data lock point will be 17 December 2024.  
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 9.4 is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 9.4 with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8., 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the 
SmPC have been updated. The Annex II and the Package Leaflet have been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to combine the two SmPCs (i.e. NexoBrid 2 g and NexoBrid 5 
g), to remove the black triangle from the SmPC and the PL; and to introduce minor editorial corrections in 
the product information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to NexoBrid. The bridging report submitted by the MAH has 
been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH is seeking an extension of indication for Nexobrid, a mixture of enzymes from the stem of 
Ananas comosus (pineapple plant) to paediatrics (0-17 years). The proposed indication is “NexoBrid is 
indicated in all age groups for removal of eschar in patients with deep partial- and full-thickness thermal 
burns.”  
Burned and traumatised tissue is known as an eschar, and can include part of, or the entire, thickness of 
the skin and may even include deeper tissues. Eschar removal, “debridement”, is considered a critical 
initial stage of the comprehensive wound care process. Early (i.e., within 1 to 2 days/before the onset of 
inflammation) and rapid debridement of eschar is essential to initiate body’s own wound healing process, 
to allow clinical visual evaluation of burn severity and depth, preserve viable tissue, and prevent further 
complications.  
Assessment report 
EMA/560965/2023 
Page 81/87 
 
 
 
 
 
Children are more prone to accidents, including thermal injury, than healthy adults, and in many 
countries, children constitute the majority of the burn victim population. This is a debilitating condition 
accompanied by intense pain and often by longer-term illness that creates suffering not only for the child 
but for the wider family and community.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current treatment guideline (e.g. European practice guideline) recommends that debridement may be 
done by applying dressings, surgical debridement of eschar or by applying enzymatic debridement by 
NexoBrid. Surgical debridement is considered effective, but it is traumatic, requires general anesthesia, 
and is resource-intensive and time consuming. Concerns for surgical and postsurgical complications 
including blood and heat loss, often dictate that only a limited percentage of the affected areas (~15% 
TBSA) will be surgically debrided and autografted at one time in order to limit inflicting excessive stress 
on the patient. Surgical debridement is also considered non-selective, resulting in the loss of healthy 
viable tissue while non-viable eschar may still remain. 
Although less invasive than surgical methods, currently available conservative non-surgical ER procedures 
(e.g. collagenase ointment (Santyl, Iruxol), antimicrobial agents such as SSD, or various hydrogels) are 
generally considered inefficient, can result in maceration and a lengthy sloughing period, and have the 
potential for development of granulation tissue and increased infection and scarring.  
Therefore, NexoBrid is considered to be a more viable alternative to surgical excision.  
Overall, it is agreed that there is an unmet need for non-surgical treatment of paediatric burns.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
To demonstrate clinical efficacy in the paediatric population the MAH submitted one pivotal clinical study 
MW2012-01-01 (CIDS)). 
Study MW2012-01-01 is a 3-stage, multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, controlled, open label, 2-
arm study aimed at demonstrating the superiority of NexoBrid treatment over SOC in patients with deep 
partial thickness (DPT) and full thickness (FT) thermal burns of ≥1% TBSA. 
The co-primary endpoints in the CIDS study were ‘time to complete ER compared to SOC’, ‘the % wound 
area surgically excised for ER’ and ‘cosmesis and function using MVSS at 12 months from wound closure’.  
This application was based on interim results from the CIDS study. The final results will be submitted for 
assessment post-approval, once available.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The CIDS study demonstrated clinical superiority of NexoBrid over SOC in all 3 Co-Primary endpoints:  
• 
• 
• 
‘Time to complete eschar removal’ (NexoBrid vs. SOC: 0.99 days (95% CI: 0.88 to 1.04) vs. 5.99 
days (95% CI: 2.71 to 9.84),  
‘Mean % wound area surgically excised for eschar removal’ (NexoBrid vs. SOC: 1.5 [12.13]) vs. 48.1 
[46.58] (p-value <0.0001), 
‘Scar score MVSS at 12 months’ (NexoBrid vs. SOC: 3.83 [SD 2.876]) vs. 4.86 [SD 3.256], p-
value<0.0001),  
and additionally for the first secondary endpoint: 
Assessment report 
EMA/560965/2023 
Page 82/87 
 
 
 
 
• 
‘Incidence of surgical excision’ (NexoBrid vs. SOC: 8.33% (6/72 patients) vs. 64.38% (47/73 
patients; p-value<0.0001) 
in a hierarchal test procedure.  
It was demonstrated in the CIDS study that NexoBrid is a fast and effective topical eschar removal agent 
while significantly reducing the need for surgical excision of eschar compared with SOC. 
A subgroup analysis by age group (0 to 23 months, 24 months to 3 years, 0 to 3 years, 4 to 11 years, 
and 12 to 18 years) consistently demonstrated superiority of NexoBrid over SOC in each age group. 
NexoBrid effectively removed the eschar earlier than the SOC in all paediatric age groups. 
There was no deleterious effect on cosmesis and function at 12 months post wound closure in the 
paediatric patients. These results were consistently observed across all age groups in the CIDS study. 
In addition, the endpoint ‘Time to reach complete wound closure’ (>95% without drainage or dressing 
requirements confirmed at 2 consecutive study visits, 2 weeks apart) was compared at a TW level (using 
the Kaplan Meier Method). For this safety endpoint results were as follows:  
• 
‘Time to reach complete wound closure’ (NexoBrid vs. SOC, median: 31 days vs. 31 days). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Despite an overall statistically significant superior result in the NexoBrid treatment arm, the numerical 
difference between groups was small. Nevertheless, the CHMP ultimately considered the difference to be 
of clinical relevance.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Clinical study experience in paediatric patients (newborn up to 18 years of age) includes use of NexoBrid 
in a dedicated SOC-controlled study (MW2012), in which 69 patients were exposed to NexoBrid (age 
range new born-18 years) and use in paediatric patients from studies MW2004 and MW2008, which 
included 17 and 3 paediatric patients, respectively (age range 4-17 years). The data demonstrates that 
the overall safety profile in children newborn and older and in adolescents, is similar to the profile in 
adults.  
The most commonly reported adverse reactions of the use of NexoBrid in the paediatric population were 
pyrexia and pain (incidence of 16.9% and 7.9%, respectively). The data from the clinical development in 
adults showed that through precautionary measures including preventive analgesia as routinely practiced 
for extensive dressing changes in burn patients as well as antibacterial soaking of the treatment area 
before and after NexoBrid application, the frequency of pain and pyrexia/hyperthermia was reduced. 
These recommendations are included in the SmPC. 
•  No patient died during study MW2012-01-01 (CIDS), 
•  SAEs (0-12weeks follow-up): NexoBrid (tachycardia, fever, sepsis, joint contracture) vs. SOC 
(withdrawal syndrome, viral infection, lyrangospasm, wound complication, injury, procedural pain): 2 
patients vs. 5 patients, 
•  Severe AEs (0-12weeks follow-up): NexoBrid vs. SOC: 4 patients vs. 1 patient, (related to NexoBrid 
are fever and tachycardia), 
• 
Local, TW related AE (0-12weeks follow-up): NexoBrid vs. SOC: 21.7% vs. 24.3% of patients, 
•  RMP identified risks (0-12weeks follow-up):  
Assessment report 
EMA/560965/2023 
Page 83/87 
 
 
 
 
o  Pain: NexoBrid vs. SOC: 4.3% vs. 4.3% of patients, 
o  Pyrexia: NexoBrid vs. SOC: 11.6% vs. 5.7% (imbalance noted, see LoQ in Annex 1 below), 
o  Wound Complications: NexoBrid vs. SOC: 7.2% vs. 7.1%, 
o  Wound Infections: NexoBrid vs. SOC: 1.4% vs. 4.3%, 
o  Allergic reactions: related TEAEs NexoBrid: 2/69 (2.9%), 
•  Additional analyses comparing pooled paediatric safety data with pooled adult data showed that 
incidences of TEAEs per age group differ between the subgroups ≤median dose vs. >median dose in 
the age group 0-3 years of age. This imbalance was seen in incidences for: ‘Any TEAE’, ‘Related 
TEAEs’, ‘Special TEAEs’ (Pain, Fever, Target Wound Infection) and ‘General TEAEs’. Frequencies were 
distinctively higher in the >Median dose subgroup (for patients 0-3 years of age), as compared to the 
≤Median dose subgroup. 
Based on the data available, the following changes to the SmPC section 4.8 of the SmPC were 
implemented:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
The ADR ‘Wound infection’ was updated to include ‘cellulitis’.  
‘Local pruritus’ related to TW was more frequent with NexoBrid in all age groups 0-11 years of age. 
Therefore, the frequency of this ADR was changed from uncommon to common.  
‘local rash’ was added as a common ADR as the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions, including 
allergic reactions and cases of rash, was approximately 5% (4/69) of NexoBrid treated patients; 2/69 
were considered related. 
‘intradermal hematoma’ was added as a new ADR with a frequency uncommon. 
Exclusion (safety) criteria in clinical studies included exclusion of patients with history of allergy and/or 
known sensitivity to pineapples, papaya, Bromelain, or papain. Therefore, the SmPC section 4.3 was 
updated accordingly (as papain occurs also in papaya).  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Uncertainties arise mainly from the small numbers of exposed paediatric patients in the submitted CIDS 
study (SAS NexoBrid vs. SOC: 69 vs. 70 patients) and in the pooled paediatric studies (pooled paediatric 
population: NexoBrid N=89 vs. SOC N=86).  Due to the low numbers of adverse reactions reported in 
each age group, it is not possible to draw valid conclusions regarding potential age-related differences in 
the safety profile. 
As the application was based on the 12 months interim data of the CIDS study, the CHMP has 
recommended the MAH to submit the final results of the CIDS study to provide long-term follow up data 
on NexoBrid.  
Overall, based on the limited PK and safety results, children 0-3 years of age can be safely treated up to 
10% TBSA and children over 4 years of age can be safely treated up to 15% TBSA. Taking into account 
the limited safety data available thus far in the new paediatric indication, the PSUR cycle for the medicinal 
product was shortened to follow a yearly cycle, allowing to closely monitor the safety profile NexoBrid in 
paediatric patients’ post-approval.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The efficacy data from the submitted pivotal paediatric study clearly demonstrate efficacy in the 
paediatric population overall and for the age groups separately.  
There were no new safety concerns in the paediatric population and comparison of TEAE incidences in the 
pooled populations overall show lower incidences in the paediatric patients for ‘Any TEAE’, ‘Serious TEAEs’ 
and ‘Severe TEAEs’ when compared to adults. 
Although the number of exposed paediatric patients per age–group is very low, it can be concluded that 
the safety profile of NexoBrid in paediatric patients has been established. Long-term safety data (final 
results from CIDS study) will be submitted post approval, once available.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The efficacy of NexoBrid in the paediatric population overall and for the age groups separately has been 
demonstrated. There is evidence that NexoBrid significantly reduces the amount of surgical excision of 
eschar required by burn wounds in paediatric patients in a significantly shorter period of time compared 
to SOC treatment. This is considered to be clinically relevant. The safety profile, albeit limited, is in line 
with the favourable profile observed in adults. Long-term safety data from the CIDS study will be 
submitted for assessment post-approval, once available.  
Given the limited PK and safety data available in the younger age group (0-3 years), the CHMP agreed 
with the MAH’s proposal to limit the use of NexoBrid to maximum 10% TBSA for paediatric patients aged 
0-3 years old.  
NexoBrid should only be applied by trained healthcare professionals in specialist burn centres. This is 
already adequately addressed by the SmPC as well as the risk minimisation activities to ensure proper 
management in clinical practice. Given the clear efficacy of Nexobrid for eschar removal, the 
demonstrated clinical benefit of the product and the fact that safety concerns can be adequately managed 
in clinical practice, the demonstrated benefit of NexoBrid outweighs the uncertainties about possible risks. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of NexoBrid is positive.  
4.  Recommendations

01 (CIDS study), listed as Study MW2012-01-01 is a 3-stage, multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, 
controlled, open label, 2 arm study aiming to demonstrate the superiority of NexoBrid treatment over 
SOC treatment in paediatric patients (aged 0 to 18 years) with deep partial thickness (DPT) and full 
thickness (FT) thermal burns of 1% to 30% of total body surface area (TBSA). 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC are updated. The 
Annex II and Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
remove the black triangle from the SmPC and the package leaflet, combine the SmPCs and introduce 
minor editorial corrections to the product information. Version 9.4 of the RMP is acceptable. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

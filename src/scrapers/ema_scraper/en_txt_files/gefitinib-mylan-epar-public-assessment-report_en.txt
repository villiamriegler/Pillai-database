2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Lung cancer is an aggressive, heterogeneous, and life-threatening disease. It has been one of the most 
common cancers in the world for several decades (1.8 million new cases in 2012, 12.9% of all new cancers 
worldwide (GLOBOCAN 2012). In the EU, lung cancer is ranked as the fourth most frequent cancer; 
approximately 313,000 new cases were diagnosed in 2012 (Ferlay et al. 2013). Furthermore, lung cancer 
incidence rates were two-fold higher in males compared to females (1,241,601 and 583,100, respectively). It 
is also the most common cause of death from cancer worldwide, estimated to be responsible for nearly 1 in 5 
cancer deaths (1.59 million deaths; 19.4% of all deaths from cancer) in 2012, including 168,000 deaths in 
the US and 268,000 deaths in Europe (GLOBOCAN 2012). NSCLC represents approximately 80 to 90% of all 
lung cancers (Cataldo et al 2011, Herbst et al 2008). For the minority of patients with NSCLC who have 
resectable disease, surgery offers the best chance of cure (Mountain 1997). Despite progress in early 
detection and treatment, NSCLC is most often diagnosed at an advanced stage and has a poor prognosis 
(Herbst et al 2008). Once NSCLC has progressed to a locally advanced or metastatic stage there is no cure 
and treatment is therefore focused on extending life, delaying disease progression, and improving symptoms 
and quality of life. 
Progress in molecular biology has changed the therapeutic approach to NSCLC, and the treatment of 
advanced NSCLC can now be guided by the presence of certain mutations, e.g., epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR), or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). 
Since the discovery of the common somatic mutations in the kinase domain of EGFR in 2004 (Lynch et al 
2004), NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations in exons 18-21 of EGFR (including L858R and exon 19 
deletions [Ex19del], collectively described as EGFRm) are considered a subset of NSCLC in terms of 
pathogenesis, prognosis and treatment. 
In recent years, studies have identified the presence of EGFR mutations in approximately 10% of patients 
with lung cancer in the European Economic Area (EEA) (Barlesi et al 2013, Esteban et al 2015, Gahr et al 
2013, Rosell et al 2009). Overall, EGFR mutations have been found to be more frequent in never smokers, in 
patients with the adenocarcinoma histologic subtype, and in women. Their prevalence is also higher in East 
Asian patients than in Caucasian patients (ESMO clinical practice guidelines [Reck et al 2014]). 
There is a large body of evidence showing consistent efficacy of EGFR TKIs in patients with sensitizing EGFR 
mutations and that these patients are more likely to benefit from initial treatment with an EGFR TKI in 
preference to doublet chemotherapy (Maemondo et al 2010, Mitsudomi et al 2010, Mok et al 2009, Rosell et 
al 2012, Zhou et al 2011, Wu et al 2014). 
First- or second-generation EGFR TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib) would generally be considered first choice 
treatment for patients with activating mutations in EGFR, offering ORRs of approximately 60-70% and

median PFS of 9 to 14 months (NCCN guidelines, ESMO clinical practice guidelines [Reck et al 2014], 
Sebastian et al 2014). 
A majority of patients develop resistance to EGFR-TKIs with the most common resistance being associated 
with secondary T790M mutation. A 3rd generation TKI (osimertinib) has been authorised for the treatment of 
patients harbouring the T790M mutation and most recently for the 1st line treatment of NSCLC with activating 
EGFR mutations. 
This application for a marketing authorisation of Gefitinib Mylan 250 mg film-coated tablets concerns a 
generic application of a centrally authorised medicinal product according to Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/ 
83/EC.  
The reference product is Iressa 250 mg film-coated tablets registered by AstraZeneca AB, S-151 85, 
Södertälje, Sweden. The community granted marketing authorisation of the reference product Iressa 250 mg 
film-coated tablets on 24/06/2009 under number EMEA/H/C/001016. 
In line with the originator Iressa 250 mg film-coated tablets, the targeted indication for Gefitinib Mylan 250 
mg film-coated tablets is the following:  
“Gefitinib Mylan is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating mutations of EGFR-TK (see section 4.4).” 
The recommended posology of Gefitinib Mylan is one 250 mg tablet once a day. The tablet may be taken 
orally with or without food, at about the same time each day. The tablet can be swallowed whole with some 
water or if dosing of whole tablets is not possible, tablets may be administered as a dispersion in non-
carbonated water. 
Gefitinib is a selective small molecule inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase 
and can be a treatment option for patients with tumours with activating mutations of the EGFR tyrosine 
kinase domain. No clinically relevant activity has been shown in patients with known EGFR mutation negative 
tumours.

The chemical name of gefitinib is N-(3-Chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-7-methoxy-6-[3-(morpholin-4-
yl)propoxy]quinazolin-4-amine corresponding to the molecular formula C22H24ClFN4O3. It has a molecular 
mass of 446.90 g/mol and the following structure (Figure 1): 
Figure 1. Structure of gefitinib. 
The structure has been elucidated using high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), UV spectroscopy, 
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR and 13C NMR) spectroscopy, mass 
spectrometry (MS), differential scanning calorimetry analysis (DSC) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). 
Gefitinib is described in the Ph. Eur. monograph 2866. It appears as a white or almost white, non-
hygroscopic, crystalline powder. It is practically insoluble in water. Sufficient information on the solubility in 
aqueous buffers has been provided: solubility increases with decreasing pH. The molecule has two pKa of 5.4 
and 7.2 and its partition coefficient logP is 3.75 (octanol/water). 
Gefitinib exhibits polymorphism as reported in the literature. The active substance (AS) produced by the 
proposed manufacturer is Form 1. Gefitinib polymorphic form is characterised by X-ray powder diffraction and 
is controlled in the specification. 
One structural isomer (Ph. Eur. Impurity B) is the potential impurity in the manufacturing process of Gefitinib 
and is controlled as specified impurity with limit of NMT 0.2% in the specification of final active substance, 
which is consistent with Ph. Eur. monograph. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The ASMF procedure is used for the drug substance. Detailed information on the manufacturing process of 
the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the ASMFs and it was considered satisfactory. 
Gefitinib is sourced from one manufacturer. Two ASMFs have been submitted as different synthesis routes 
are applied for production of the same crystalline form (Form 1). Gefitinib from both routes is manufactured 
in 5 steps from the same starting materials (SMs).  
The two processes differ mainly in the crystallisation and purification processes in steps (e.g. solvent system, 
temperatures, drying times) applied to the intermediates and the final active substance but not in the 
chemical synthesis steps. It has been demonstrated that the same polymorphic form of gefitinib is 
consistently produced by the two processes and that the polymorphic form remains unchanged following 
storage at long term and accelerated conditions. 
Tests for identification, purity and related substances (specified, unspecified and total impurities) are included 
in the specification of the SMs. The carry-over of impurities from SMs has been addressed including 
justification for the proposed limits for specified impurities and other single impurities in the specification of 
SMs. Palladium (Pd) is used in the manufacturing process of SM1 and carry-over of Pd from SM1 into the AS 
has been studied with a validated ICP-MS method. The test for palladium is performed as skip testing. This is 
acceptable since palladium was found below 30% of ICH Q3D option 1 limit in 3 consecutive batches of

gefitinib. It is stated that no other catalyst is used during the manufacturing process of gefitinib. 
Four intermediates (Gefitinib amides, Gefitinib hydrolysates, Gefitinib crude and 1st purified Gefitinib) are 
isolated, for which the specifications and analytical procedures were provided and are considered acceptable. 
Several critical steps in the manufacture of Gefitinib have been identified. The acceptance criteria and test 
procedures for the in-process controls have been described and are considered satisfactory. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. The potential genotoxicity of all chemical substances including raw materials, 
reagents, catalyst and corresponding impurities have been analysed in accordance with ICH M7 guideline. 
The structures of all chemical substances involved in the production process of gefitinib have been presented. 
3-Chloro-4-fluoroaniline has been identified as potential genotoxic impurity, which is controlled in gefitinib 
drug substance. No residual solvent has been observed above Q3C recommended limits in the active 
substance batches. 
The active substance is stored in double polyethylene (PE) bags placed in aluminium tin with rubber rim and 
aluminium cap. This primary packaging complies with EC directive 10/2011 as amended and the specification 
includes test for identification by IR. 
Specification 
Gefitinib specification includes tests for: appearance, identification (IR, HPLC), related substances (HPLC), 3-
chloro-4-fluoroaniline content (LC-MS), water content (Ph. Eur.), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents 
(GC), assay (HPLC), polymorphism (X-RD),  particle size (laser diffraction) and microbiological quality (Ph. 
Eur.).  The specification and acceptance criteria for gefitinib are established based on the current version of 
the Ph. Eur. monograph. 
The specification for gefitinib applied by the finished product manufacturer has been amended in 
line with the latest versions of specifications in each ASMF. XRD has also been included as a non-
routine test in the updated active substance manufacturer’s specification of gefitinib.  
The limits proposed for residual solvents are those given in ICH Q3C guideline and are therefore acceptable. 
The proposed limits for assay, water content and sulfated ash are in line with the Ph. Eur. monograph for 
gefitinib.  
The requirements for microbiological purity are in line with the criteria presented in Ph. Eur. General Text 
5.1.4 with additional requirement for absence of the specified microorganism E. coli.  
3-Chloro-4-fluoroaniline has been identified as potential genotoxic impurity and is controlled in gefitinib 
active substance based on the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) (≤1.5μg/day). Considering the 
maximum daily dose of gefitinib (250 mg) the acceptance criteria has been established using in-house LC-MS 
method. The impurity was found absent in three batches of gefitinib drug substance.  
Benzene is tested within the specifications of the solvents used during the synthesis. The absence of benzene 
in the active substance has also been demonstrated by batch analysis data. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and and are in line with those in the Ph.Eur. 
monograph for gefitinib. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented.

Batch analysis data from 3 commercial scale batches from each commercial process were provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch and demonstrated the equivalence of 
the two processes. 
Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of gefitinib from each of the two processes placed under 
long term conditions (30±2 ºC / 65±5% RH) for up to 36 months and accelerated conditions (40±2 ºC / 
75±5% RH) for six months were provided according to the ICH guidelines. In addition, data from two 
commercial batches (process I) were provided under long term conditions with higher relative humidity 
(30±2 ºC / 75±5% RH) for up to 24 months as well as under standard accelerated conditions (40±2 ºC / 
75±5% RH) for up to 6 months. The stability samples were stored in sealed double layers of PE bags 
(immediate packaging material) and then put in a sealed aluminium tin (secondary packaging material) that 
are fully representative of the commercial active substance packaging (simulated commercial packaging). 
The following parameters were tested during stability studies: appearance, loss on drying initially, then 
replaced by water content, assay, related substances, 3-chloro-4-fluoroaniline content and microbial limits 
test. The stability indicating nature of the HPLC methods for assay and related substances was demonstrated 
by forced degradation studies. All results for tested parameters remained within specifications during the 
investigated period under long term conditions. No obvious trends or significant changes were observed, 
except for a negligible increase in the level of total impurities from the initial value at both long term and 
accelerated conditions for two batches. 
One commercial scale batch of gefitinib from each process was subjected to stressed degradation study to 
evaluate potential degradation products and to demonstrate stability indicating nature of the HPLC methods 
for assay and related substances. Gefitinib samples were exposed to stress conditions including acid 
degradation, alkaline degradation, oxidative, water hydrolysis, exposure to elevated temperature, high 
humidity and light exposure (ICH Q1B conditions). According to the presented results gefitinib is not sensitive 
to heat, moisture and it is not photosensitive. It is sensitive to oxidation and to lesser extent, to hydrolysis 
under different conditions. The proposed container closure system provides adequate protection to the active 
substance. 
Based on the provided stability results, the proposed retest period of 24 months for the active substance, 
without special storage conditions is justified in both ASMFs. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The  finished  product  is  brown,  round,  biconvex  immediate  release  film-coated  tablets  available  in  250  mg 
strength.  
The  aim  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  develop  a  generic  product  to  the  reference  product 
Iressa.  Gefitinib  is  highly  lipophilic  (LogP  ~4)  and  is  classified  as  class  2  compound  (low  solubility  –  high 
permeability)  according  to  the  biopharmaceutical  classification  system  (BCS).  Evaluation  of  the  main 
characteristics  (physical-chemical  characterisation)  of  Iressa  250  mg  film-coated  tablets  was  performed  on 
three batches obtained from the major European markets of this product. Also, dissolution profiles in pH 1.2, 
pH  4.5  and  pH  6.8  dissolution  media  without  surfactant  (paddles,  50  rpm,  1000  ml)  showed  there  is  no 
significant  difference  in  dissolution  behaviour  at  pH  of  1.2  and  no  significant  difference  in  dissolution 
behaviour  comparing  reference  product  batches  from  different  countries  at  pH  4.5.  However,  at  pH  6.8, 
Assessment report  
EMA/587444/2018 
Page 13/29 
 
  
  
dissolution  is  below  5%.  Based  on  active  substance  characteristics  and  reference  product  characterisation 
data, a quality target product profile (QTTP) was defined for the generic Gefitinib 250 mg film-coated tablets . 
The excipients used in Gefitinib Mylan were selected based on the excipients used in the reference product, 
excipient compatibility studies and development results (dissolution and stability data) and are commonly 
used for tabletting purposes. 
Excipient/active substance compatibility was assessed through HPLC analysis of binary mixtures of varying 
ratios. Water was added to mimic the wet granulation process. Each mixture was stored and then analysed 
for degradation products and organoleptic characteristics. All excipients studied are considered compatible 
because no significant increase in impurity level was observed after 3 and 7 days of storage. The selection of 
suitable grade of excipients was based on the results of the compatibility studies, reference product 
formulation and previous formulation knowledge for similar wet granulation products.  
The tablet weight was set at 500 mg in line with the reference product. The drug load in the generic 
formulation was fixed at 50% based on the reference product label, strength and tablet weight.  
The influence of the levels of diluents, wetting agent, disintegrant, binder, lubricant and film-coating agent on 
dissolution profile was studied and based on the results, a final formulation was selected. 
A solubility study has been carried out and showed that gefitinib is soluble in pH 1.2 and pH 4.5 aqueous 
media and that sink conditions are achieved. Gefitinib is practically insoluble in dissolution media of pH 5.4, 
pH 6.8 and pH 7.2. The FDA recommended dissolution medium for this product is Tween 80 (5% v/v) in 
water. The solubility in the FDA dissolution medium is lower than pH 1.2 and pH 4.5, although sink conditions 
are reached too. Dissolution profiles of the test and reference products were measured in the different 
dissolution media (pH 1.2, pH 4.5, pH 6.8 and FDA dissolution medium). The results indicate that the 
dissolution is very fast at pH 1.2 and that at pH 6.8, gefitinib is not dissolved sufficiently. Both the pH 4.5 and 
FDA dissolution media could be chosen as routine QC medium. Sink conditions were achieved in both these 
media. The discriminatory power of the method was evaluated with different variants of the final tablet 
formulation (excipient ratios) and process parameters (wet granulation step). The chosen dissolution method 
was found to be sufficiently discriminatory.   
A bioequivalence study was performed. As per the bioequivalence guideline comparative dissolution study of 
the reference product and BE test batch was conducted at pH 1.2, 4.5, and 6.8. At pH 1.2, more than 85% of 
AS is dissolved in 15 min, and thus, no further evaluation is required, profiles are deemed similar. For the 
other two media (pH 4.5 and pH 6.8) the dissolution profiles are also similar by visual observation and by 
method of calculation of the Mahalanobis distance and the results of statistical comparison revealed that the 
profiles are similar. Dissolution profiles of 2 other validation batches were compared to the dissolution profile 
of the test product (bio-batch) and were found to be similar too. Additionally, assay and impurities profiles of 
the reference and the test products were compared and found to be comparable. 
According to the SmPC, tablets may be administered as dispersion in water (non-carbonated) and, 
additionally, the dispersion can also be administered through a naso-gastric or gastrostomy tube. Since 
qualitative and quantitative composition of the test and the reference products are not the same, and 
considering that bioequivalence was demonstrated only on whole tablets, but not with dispersion, additional 
in vitro studies were performed comparing test and reference products. The provided results demonstrated 
the similarity between the test and the reference products, when tablets are administered as dispersions in 
water and through a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube as per SmPC section 4.2.

Manufacturing process development 
Some formulations were prepared in order to study the influence of manufacturing processes on the 
polymorphic stability of the active substance. Samples prepared by direct compression (final mixture), 
aqueous granulation and organic granulation processes were studied. They were found to be essentially the 
same. It can be shown that these three formulations contain the same crystalline form of the AS as that of 
reference product. All of them were introduced in stability chambers to study the AS stability. The formulation 
prepared by direct compression (final mixture) gave worse stability results than the other two prepared by 
wet granulation. Both granulated trials presented similar (slightly better) stability results than the reference 
product. 
The use of wet granulation with an aqueous solvent instead of an organic solvent was preferred because of 
the desire to avoid the environmental considerations involved. Dissolution profiles of tablet samples 
manufactured by aqueous solvent instead of an organic solvent were measured in QC dissolution medium in 
order to study the influence of the granulation solvent. Organic solvents were found to slow down the 
dissolution rate. Based on the results an aqueous granulation process was selected as the process for further 
drug product development efforts. 
A risk assessment of the overall drug product manufacturing process was performed to identify the high risk 
steps that may affect the CQAs of the final drug product. Assay, dissolution and degradation products were 
the identified product CQAs.  
A further risk assessment was performed subsequently on each identified high risk process step to evaluate 
which process variables may potentially impact the CQAs of the drug product. 
In the initial risk assessment of the manufacturing process wet granulation, sieving and compression were 
highlighted as high risk considering their impact on dissolution. Respective Design of Experiments (DoE) trials 
were performed for these steps. Based on the DoE results, the manufacturing process parameters that could 
potentially impact the CQAs of the finished product were identified and their associated risk was evaluated 
and the control strategy was defined.  
Evaluation of elemental impurities according to ICH Q3D has been provided. The contribution of each 
component and process to the final content of elemental impurities in the drug product has been discussed. 
The synthesis of gefitinib active substance is stated by the manufacturer not to employ metal catalysts. The 
starting material derives from chemical synthesis involving palladium (Class 2B). Factual batch data was 
provided and a safe maximum concentration of <5 μg/g of Pd is estimated for this precursor. For this reason 
it has been considered that no relevant presence of this and any other metal impurity in the AS should be 
expected. 
All excipients, except for povidone, have been certified according to EMA guideline 
EMA/CHMP/SWP/4446/2000. Povidone, the synthesis of which is known to take place in the presence of 
copper, comes certified as compliant to EMA guideline. All specific reported values provided for the rest of 
elemental impurities are far from reference calculated values.  
Water used in the manufacturing processes meets the current Ph. Eur. requirements for purified water for 
conductivity and heavy metals, and as such, the risk of inclusion of elemental impurities from water is 
negligible. 
Gefitinib 250 mg film-coated tablets are packed in PVC/PVDC/Aluminium blister packs. The blister strips are 
packed in printed cartons. Additionally the blisters may be packed into aluminium pouches. All immediate 
packaging materials comply with the requirements of Commission Regulation (EU) No 10/2011, as amended.

Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process comprises the following main steps: blending, wet granulation, drying, sieving, 
blending, tableting, film coating and packaging.  
The manufacturing process of Gefitinib Mylan film-coated tablets is a standard process, widely used in the 
pharmaceutical industry. Critical steps were identified as wet granulation, drying, tabletting (compression) 
and coating and adequate IPCs have been established. Process validation has been carried out on three 
consecutive commercial scale batches. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable 
of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
Product specification  
The release and shelf-life specifications for the finished products include appropriate tests and limits for: 
appearance (visual), identity of active substance (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), 3-
chloro-4-fluoroaniline content (LC-MS), dissolution (Ph. Eur. - HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (mass 
variation - Ph. Eur.) and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
Limits for impurities are set according to ICH Q3B considering the daily dose of gefitinib is 250 mg. The limit 
for dissolution is in line with dissolution results of bio-batch and Reflection paper on the dissolution 
specification for generic oral immediate release products. Testing of the potentially genotoxic impurity, which 
is also a degradation product, 3-chloro-4-fluoroaniline is included in the finished product specification with a 
limit according the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) concept. Testing of 3-chloro-4-fluoroaniline is also 
included in the stability study. The proposed limit for 3-chloro-4-fluoroaniline is acceptable and in line with 
ICH M7. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for testing has been presented. 
Batch results from four commercial scale batches have been presented, demonstrating compliance with the 
proposed specifications and consistency in manufacture. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
finished product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data was provided for four commercial scale batches under long term conditions (25 °C ± 2 °C / 
60% ± 5% RH and 30 °C ± 2 °C / 75% ± 5% RH) for up to 24 months and under accelerated conditions 
(40 °C ± 2 °C / 75% ± 5% RH) for 6 months according to the ICH guidelines. Stability batches were 
manufactured using AS synthesized by each of the two processes. All samples were packed in PVC/PVDC/Alu 
blister intended for marketing and some samples were additionally packed in Aluminium pouches. 
Tests performed were appearance, assay, related substances, microbiological quality and dissolution. The 
methods for assay and related substance are stability indicating. Under all storage conditions, results for all 
tested parameters of batches packed with and without pouches except one of the tested paraeters were well 
within the applied acceptance criteria. Under accelerated storage conditions, out of specification results for 
one of the tested paraeters were obtained for both pouched and unpouched samples, at the 6 month testing 
point. Due to the significant change for one of the tested paraeters after 6 months under accelerated 
conditions stability data under long-term conditions (30 °C/75% RH) were presented (as already mentioned 
Assessment report  
EMA/587444/2018 
Page 16/29 
 
  
  
above). The results of all batches were well within the applied acceptance criteria after 24 months at 25 °C / 
60% RH and after 12 months at 30 °C / 75% RH. 
Stability studies on tablets packed in bulk packaging material (double PE bag) were performed on one 
commercial scale batch for up to 3 months at 40 °C / 75% RH and 12 months at 25 °C / 60% RH. During 
storage the product did not show any significant changes in the parameters tested, i.e. appearance, assay, 
related substances, dissolution and microbiological quality. Hence, the proposed holding time for Gefitinib 
250 mg film-coated tablets in bulk packaging is 12 months. 
Based on the stability data presented, the proposed shelf life of 24 months and storage conditions (“Do not 
store above 30 °C.”) in both packaging configurations are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
All  excipients  with  the exception  of  lactose  monohydrate  used  for  the production  of  Gefitinib  Mylan  250 mg 
film-coated tablets are of synthetic, vegetable or mineral origin.  
It is confirmed that the lactose used in the manufacture of Gefitinib Mylan is produced from milk from healthy 
animals in the same condition as those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has 
been prepared without the use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance 
on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary 
medicinal products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/587444/2018 
Page 17/29 
 
  
  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Gefitinib Mylan manufactured by Mylan S.A.S. is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the 
combined sales volumes for all gefitinib containing products and the exposure of the environment to the 
active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicological  properties  of  gefitinib  are  well  known.  Published 
literature has been reviewed and is considered of suitable quality. 
In  line  with  the  Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), the justification for not providing new ERA studies is acceptable. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Gefitinib Mylan and justifications that the 
active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the reference 
product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and 
additional non clinical studies were not considered necessary. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for film-coated tablets containing gefitinib. To support the marketing authorisation 
application the applicant conducted one bioequivalence study with cross-over design under fasting conditions. 
This study was the pivotal study for the assessment. 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as 
efficacy and safety of gefitinib based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the 
reference product. 
For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) as 
well as the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09), Question number 
3.6 of the Questions & Answers: Positions on specific questions addressed to the Pharmacokinetics Working 
Party (EMEA/618604) in their current version, are of particular relevance.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/587444/2018 
Page 18/29 
 
  
  
Exemption  
Question number 3.6 of the Questions & Answers: Positions on specific questions addressed to the 
Pharmacokinetics Working Party (EMEA/618604) allows the waiver for drug substances of BCS classification 
class 1 or 3. Based on the EMA Q&As, the same cannot be concluded for BCS class 2 drugs like gefitinib. 
As the drug substance needs to be solubilized in order to be absorbed, comparing intact tablets in vivo could 
generally be considered most sensitive as this would include disintegration and dissolution processes. 
However, published data demonstrate, that bioavailability could change substantially after 
crushing/dispersing tablets. As an example, reduced bioavailability as compared to the intact tablet has been 
described for artemether though not for lumefantrine with a fixed dose combination (Abdulla et al. Malaria 
Journal 2010, 9:253). Further, the product-specific bioequivalence guideline for everolimus (published on the 
EMA website) requires separate bioequivalence testing for the dispersed tablets in addition to the study with 
intact tablets.  
Accordingly, formulation related differences and changes in bioavailability after dispersion cannot be 
completely excluded all the more gefitinib is considered BCS class 2 and formulation effects could be 
expected to be more relevant as compared to highly soluble compounds (BCS 1 and 3). 
However, the relative bioavailability of the originator IRESSA (gefitinib 250 mg) administered as a tablet or 
as a tablet dispersion (drink and tube administered) was investigated in a pharmacokinetic study in 18 
healthy male volunteers. The pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC, Cmax, tmax and t½) investigated in this 
study were found to be similar following each method of administration of a single 250 mg tablet of the 
originator IRESSA (EPAR; study 0229). 
The additional administration process “as a dispersion in water” in line with the SmPC was not adequately 
justified in the initial application. Therefore, a thorough justification for a biowaiver for an additional study of 
the dispersed tablets was requested as part of the Day 120 list of questions in order to exclude the possibility 
of bioinequivalence compared to the originator IRESSA when Gefitinib Mylan is administered as dispersion in 
water (drink or tube administered): Given that the innovator demonstrated similarity for both modes of 
administration this justification should be based on a thorough comparison of the composition of test and 
reference product. Furthermore, the applicant was requested to perform meaningful comparative in vitro 
investigations in order to substantiate the negligible impact of formulation related differences. The 
originator’s SmPC indicates that dispersion may need 20 minutes even with frequent swirling and the 
suspension should be administered within 60 min. These time frames should be considered not only in terms 
of comparable disintegration times of the generic but also in terms of stability of the drug substance. 
During the procedure, the applicant provided a thorough comparison of Quality attributes (see Quality section 
of this AR). 
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study.

Study HMG-P5-597: Single dose crossover comparative 
bioavailability study of gefitinib 250 mg film-coated tablets in 
healthy male and female volunteersMethods 
Study design  
Study no HMG-P5-597 was an open-label, laboratory-blinded, randomized, single dose, two-period, two-
treatment cross-over bioequivalence study in healthy adult male and postmenopausal female subjects under 
fasting conditions with a wash out period of 21 days between two administrations.  
The application concerns an oral immediate release formulation. According to the SmPC of the Iressa no 
specific recommendation regarding food intake is given for Gefitinib posology. Therefore, the conduct of the 
single dose study under fasting condition as most sensitive condition to detect a potential difference between 
formulations is considered adequate.

Food and fluid intake 
Food was controlled and standardized for each housing period and for all subjects. Subjects fasted overnight 
for at least 10 hours prior to drug administration and until approximately 4 hours after drug administration,

when a standardized lunch was served. A supper and a light snack (and other meals) were served at 
appropriate times thereafter, but not before 9 hours after drug administration. 
Fluid intake other than water was controlled for each housing period and for all subjects. Water was provided 
ad libitum until 1 hour predose; the drug was given with about 240 mL (8 oz.) of water at room temperature; 
water was allowed ad libitum beginning 1 hour after the administration of the drug. 
Posture and physical activities 
Subjects were asked to remain seated or ambulatory for the first 4 hours following drug administration, 
avoiding both vigorous exertion and complete rest. However, should adverse events have occurred at any 
time, subjects may have been placed in an appropriate position. Subjects were asked not to engage in 
strenuous activity at any time during the housing periods. During each period of the study, bathrooms were 
locked for at least 4 hours after each drug administration. When necessary, subjects were permitted to use 
the washroom facilities under supervision only during this interval. 
Sampling schedule 
Twenty blood samples were collected for the assessment of Gefitinib in plasma. Blood collections were 
performed prior to the administration of study medication (0 pre-dose) and at 0.50, 1.00, 2.00, 3.00, 4.00, 
4.50, 5.00, 5.50, 6.00, 6.50, 7.00, 8.00, 10.00, 12.00, 16.00, 24.00, 36.00, 48.00, and 72.00 hours after 
study drug administration. Treatments were separated by a washout period of 21 days. The sampling time 
schedule and washout period is considered adequate taking into account the elimination half-life of the drug 
(about 41 hours).

Beside others, subjects with history of significant hypersensitivity to gefitinib or any related products 
(including excipients of the formulations) as well as severe hypersensitivity reactions (like angioedema) to 
any drugs, presence of significant gastrointestinal, liver or kidney disease, or any other conditions known to 
interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs or known to potentiate or

Analytical methods 
Plasma concentrations of Gefitinib were determined using a validated reversed phase HPLC-MS/MS method. 
Precision and accuracy of Gefitinib in human plasma were determined at LOQ, low, medium, and high QC 
sample concentrations. For each precision and accuracy batch, each QC concentration level were assayed 
within a single batch. Between-run and within-run precision and accuracy results were provided in the 
Validation report and were found acceptable. 
The first blood plasma samples were taken 2016-05-21 and the bioanalytical part was completed at 2016-06-
28. Stability for the analyte in plasma (long term stability) was shown for 72 days at -80°C nominal. 
Therefore, the actual longest storage period of the study samples of 37 days is well covered.The 
reproducibility of the bioanalytical method was evaluated by the repeated analysis of some study samples 
(incurred sample reproducibility (ISR)). At least 10% of the first 1000 analysable study samples and 5% of 
the remaining analysable study samples were re-assayed and compared to the original values. For Gefitinib, 
150 samples have been re-assayed as ISR, and on the 150 evaluable samples re-assayed, 145 samples (96.7 
%) have met the percent difference criterion of ≤20.0%. 
At least 2/3 of the total samples selected for ISR evaluation have met the percent difference criteria of 
≤20.0% between original and re-assayed concentrations. 
Pharmacokinetic variables 
The main pharmacokinetic parameters of interest for this study were:  
• AUC0-72h: area under the curve of plasma concentration versus time [ng·h/mL] calculated by the linear 
trapezoidal rule from sampling time zero to the sampling time of 72 h. 
• AUC0-∞: area under the curve of plasma concentration versus time [ng·h/mL] from time zero to infinity. 
• Cmax: maximum plasma concentration measured [ng/mL]. 
• tmax: the time [h] of the maximum measured plasma concentration. 
• Terminal rate constant (λ z): terminal elimination rate constant [h-1]. 
• Terminal Half-life (t1/2): the elimination or terminal half-life [h]. 
Primary PK-parameters were Cmax and AUC0-72h and acceptable. 
Statistical methods 
The natural logarithmic transformation of Cmax, and AUC0-72 and AUC0-∞ was to be used for all statistical 
inference. 
The parameter t max was to be analyzed using a non-parametric approach. Test of fixed period, sequence and 
treatment effects were to be based on the Wilcoxon’s rank sum test (Mann-Whitney U-test). When 
appropriate (e.g. small or sparse sample), the exact version of the test was also to be presented. 
All other pharmacokinetic parameters were to be statistically analyzed using an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 
model. The fixed factors included in this model were to be the subject effect (nested within sequence), the 
treatment received, the period at which it was given, as well as the sequence in which each treatment is 
received.

Safety data 
No serious adverse events (AEs) occurred. One subject (029) was withdrawn from the study by the 
investigator for safety reasons before dosing of period 2 due to a mild abscess (at right armpit), judged not 
related to the administration of Gefitinib, and the concomitant medication administered. 
A total of 45 TEAEs were reported by 20 (42%) of the 48 subjects who participated in this study; 
29 (64%) TEAEs were considered related to drug administration. Of the 45 TEAEs reported during the study, 
13 occurred after administration of the Test and 32 after administration of the Reference. 
The TEAEs reported most commonly in this study were headache, experienced by 3 subjects (7%) after 
administration of only the Reference, and dizziness, experienced by 1 subject (2%) after administration of 
the Test and 2 subjects (4%) after administration of the Reference. Acne was experienced by 2 subjects 
(4%) after administration of only the Test and back pain was experienced by 2 subjects (4%) after 
administration of only the Reference. The remaining TEAEs were experienced by no more than 1 subject 
(2%) per treatment group. 
The incidence of TEAEs was slightly higher in the subjects administered the Reference (33%) than in the 
subjects administered the Test (22%). The incidence of drug-related TEAEs was also slightly higher in the 
subjects administered the Reference (13% for Test, 24% for Reference).All the abnormal clinical laboratory 
values were marginally higher or lower than their reference ranges and none were considered clinically 
significant by the investigator. 
In the limited safety population no new safety signals became obvious.

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of Iressa 250 mg film-coated tablet. The reference product Iressa 
is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating mutations of EGFR-TK. 
 No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical 
aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with a cross-over design. The study design was considered 
adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European 
requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were 
adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were 
adequate. 
The test formulation of Gefitinib Mylan met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared 
with Iressa. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and 
Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. 
Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
Assessment report

2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion 
Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2020 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
“The sponsor Janssen-Cilag International N.V. submitted on 21 October 2019 an application for 
designation as an orphan medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product 
containing Autologous human T cells genetically modified ex-vivo with a lentiviral vector encoding a 
chimeric antigen receptor for B-cell maturation antigen for treatment of multiple myeloma (hereinafter 
referred to as “the condition”). The application was submitted on the basis of Article 3(1)(a) first 
paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products. 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing Autologous human T cells 
genetically modified ex-vivo with a lentiviral vector encoding a chimeric antigen receptor for B-cell 
maturation antigen was considered justified based on clinical data demonstrating a high overall 
response rate; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to the development of hypercalcemia, renal 
insufficiency, anaemia and bone lesions, and life-threatening with a reduced life expectancy; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 4 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European Union, 
the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product 
containing Autologous human T cells genetically modified ex-vivo with a lentiviral vector encoding a 
chimeric antigen receptor for B-cell maturation antigen will be of significant benefit to those affected 
by the condition. The sponsor has provided clinical data that demonstrate that patients who were 
heavily pre-treated with regimens including immunomodulators, proteasome inhibitors and anti-CD38 
antibody, achieved high overall response rates including a high proportion of complete responses. The 
Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing Autologous human T cells genetically modified ex-vivo 
with a lentiviral vector encoding a chimeric antigen receptor for B-cell maturation antigen as an orphan 
medicinal product for the orphan condition: treatment of multiple myeloma”.

3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Multiple myeloma (MM; also known as plasma cell myeloma) is a heterogeneous hematological B-cell 
malignancy characterized by dysregulated proliferation of plasma cells that clonally expand and 
accumulate in the bone marrow and/or at extramedullary sites, with potential for uncontrolled growth 
causing destructive osseous bone lesions, acute kidney injury, anemia, and hypercalcemia. The disease 
accounts for about 10-18% of all hematologic malignancies (Moreau et al., 2017; Siegel et al., 2020) 
and primarily affects older individuals (Howlader et al., 2020). The median age at onset of MM is 
around 72 years. The incidence rates increase with age, particularly after the age of 40 years, and are 
higher in men than in women with a ratio of around 3:2. The disease is often asymptomatic for a long 
time and therefore advanced at the time of diagnosis (Rajkumar et al., 2014). 
The clonal plasma cells that cause MM are derived from post-germinal center B-cells. In a healthy 
individual, following antigen exposure (e.g., viral or bacterial infections), naive B-cells normally 
proliferate and subsequently undergo somatic hypermutation of the immunoglobulin (Ig)H and IgL VDJ 
sequences. This process produces long-lived plasma cells (a subset of plasma cells that provide long-
lasting, sustained antibody production) that reside in the bone marrow and are an important 
component of humoral immunity. The development of an abnormal clonal plasma cell population 
mimics these normal biological processes but results in excessive amounts of intact immunoglobulins. 
In almost all patients, MM begins as an asymptomatic pre
malignant stage termed monoclonal 
gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS), a clonal plasma cell dyscrasia present in 3% to 5% of 
‐
people older than 65 years and in 10% of those older than 80 years. MGUS is associated with 
progression to active (symptomatic) MM, at a rate of approximately 1% to 2% per year, with a 20-
year risk of progression to MM of approximately 18%. Only a few patients develop MM from the more 
advanced pre
malignant stage referred to as smouldering multiple myeloma (SMM). The malignant 
proliferation of the plasma cell clone causes increasing levels of monoclonal protein (M-protein) in the 
serum and urine and may result in bone marrow failure, suppression of uninvolved immunoglobulin 
‐
levels, and skeletal destruction. The level of M-protein in plasma serves as a reflection of the disease 
burden over time. 
Among patients newly diagnosed with MM, approximately 3.3% present with extramedullary disease. 
Approximately 10% to 15% of patients with MM are diagnosed with concurrent immunoglobulin light 
chain amyloidosis during the course of their disease. 
Approximately 86% of people with MM reveals a monoclonal protein in the serum protein 
electrophoresis, defined as the presence of an atypical antibody in the blood. A 24-hour urine protein 
test to quantify Bence-Jones protein is important to document the presence of baseline proteinuria and 
evaluate for evidence of secondary light-chain amyloidosis, which often manifests as nephrotic range 
proteinuria. CT or PET-CT are preferred for diagnosis of MM and should be used to evaluate patients 
with SMM when the clinical suspicion for MM is high (Cowan, JAMA. 2022; 327(5): 464-477).

The approved therapeutic indication “Carvykti is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, who have received at least three prior therapies, including a 
proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated 
disease progression on the last therapy” falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition 
“treatment of multiple myeloma”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk (B/R) assessment of the 
CAT/CHMP. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
MM is a largely incurable blood cancer characterized by the clonal proliferation of malignant plasma 
cells both within the bone marrow and at localized extramedullary sites termed plasmacytomas 
(Rajkumar, 2016a). The malignant proliferation of the plasma cell clone causes increasing levels of 
monoclonal protein (M-protein) in the serum and urine and may result in bone marrow failure, 
suppression of uninvolved immunoglobulin levels, and skeletal destruction. 
The most common presenting symptoms of MM are fatigue, persistent bone pain, especially in the 
lower back or thorax, and opportunistic infections (often pneumococcal). Other common symptoms 
include pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression (from pathologic fracture), weakness, malaise, 
anaemia and/or bleeding, hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, and neuropathies (Shah and Besa, 2018). 
Clinical complications of progressive MM include recurrent infections due to decreased production of 
antibodies, cytopenias (especially anaemia, but also thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia), renal failure 
due to the protein overload, hyperviscosity syndrome, hypercalcemia, bone pain, and pathologic 
fractures (Munshi et al., 2012). 
Substantial progress has been made during the last decade in improving the overall survival (OS) of 
patients with MM through the development and availability of new approved treatment options. Despite 
optimal upfront therapy and recent advances in treatment, MM remains an incurable disease and most 
MM patients progress or relapse, and further treatment is needed. In addition, each subsequent line of 
therapy renders the patient more refractory to treatment. The prognosis of patients with MM who have 
received at least 3 prior lines of therapy, who have become double refractory to IMiDs (lenalidomide or 
pomalidomide) and PIs (bortezomib or carfilzomib), and who have been exposed to an alkylating 
agent, is very poor with an event-free survival and OS of only 5 and 13 months, respectively (Kumar 
et al., 2017). It is therefore acknowledged that the condition remains a serious and potentially fatal 
disease that is largely incurable despite advances in treatment. 
The sponsor has not identified any changes in the seriousness of MM since the orphan designation was 
granted in 2020. The COMP has previously accepted that MM is chronically debilitating due to the 
development of hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anaemia and/or bleeding, frequent infections, and 
bone lesions, and life-threatening in nature due to the poor survival of patients with relapsed or 
refractory (r/r) disease. The seriousness of MM earlier acknowledged by the COMP remains acceptable 
for this procedure. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor has accessed the European Cancer Information System (ECIS) database and 
contemporary literature as the primary and most relevant sources for the estimation of the incidence 
and prevalence of MM in the EU. The estimated crude incidence for the 27 EU member states (EU27) 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000060914 
Page 6/25 
 
 
 
 
 
was reported to be 0.80 per 10,000 persons (ECIS 2020). The sponsor noted that males have a higher 
estimated crude incidence of MM than females in the EU27 with 0.92 per 10,000 persons versus 0.69 
per 10,000 persons, respectively. 
Data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)’s Globocan surveillance project 
(2020 data), the CancerMPact program of Kantar Health for the 4 most populous EU countries 
comprising approximately 58% of the EU population, which are Germany, France, Italy, and Spain 
(including Robert Koch Institute, ITACAN, InVS in France, and IARC; 2020 data), and the Association 
of the Nordic Cancer Registries (NORDCAN; 2020 data) were consulted as secondary sources of 
information for the estimation of the prevalence. 
Based on the review of the epidemiological data sources found, the sponsor concluded on a point 
prevalence for MM of 4.34 per 10,000 people in the EU. The proposed estimate was indirectly 
calculated using the most current European incidence derived from ECIS 2020 data and the highest 
median survival duration of 5.42 years reported among MM patients aged 65 years or younger who 
were diagnosed between 2001-2006 at the Mayo Clinic in the US (Kumar et. al., 2008; Turesson et al., 
2018). The sponsor also referred to median OS data reported in the Swedish Myeloma Registry from 
2008-2015 (Blimark et al., 2018), but did not use them for establishing the disease duration of MM. 
The sponsor emphasised that the prevalence estimates will vary from the proposed value according to 
the age group and treatment line considered for the survival estimate, as the duration of the disease 
between different age groups and treatment lines is different. 
Moreover, a 5-year prevalence of 3.08 per 10,000 people in the EU27 was estimated based on data 
from the Globocan database. The EU country registries provided slightly higher 10-year and total 
prevalence estimates, with an average 10-year prevalence in four of the most populous EU countries of 
3.52 per 10,000 persons and an average total prevalence in the three Nordic EU countries (Denmark, 
Finland, and Sweden) of 3.68 per 10,000 persons. The 10-year prevalence and complete prevalence 
estimates were considered to better reflect the actual prevalence of MM, especially as patients live 
longer with the disease. 
The main concern here is that the disease duration used for establishing the prevalence indirectly by 
the standard formula P=I×D is somewhat lower than the median OS values reported in recent 
procedures assessed over the last year. Higher estimates for the median OS of the whole MM 
population ranging from 5.8-6.2 years have been used in prevalence figures recently accepted for MM 
(Fonseca et al., 2017; Greipp et al., 2005; Cho et al., 2017; Kastritis et al., 2017; Usmani et al., 
2018). The impact of the rapidly evolving therapeutic field and improved survival in recent years are 
reflected in these estimates. The sponsor then claimed to use a publication from 2018 to establish 
overall median survival. The survival data reported in this publication is considered to be outdated and 
more recent publications such as that reported by Cowan and colleagues this year (Cowan, JAMA. 
2022; 327(5): 464-477) indicate that there could be higher median survival of around 10 years in the 
US. Europe may not be far behind. The sponsor also briefly discussed in a sensitivity analysis the 
estimated median OS of 5.8 years used for the prevalence figure accepted for the orphan maintenance 
of Abecma in 2021 but considered this as a more conservative estimate. 
The sponsor puts forward the following argument: considering the totality of the data from multiple 
sources, their estimates show that the true complete prevalence of MM ranges from 3.5 per 10,000 to 
4.64 per 10,000. Given ECIS is a well-established source on cancer incidence, and the sponsor’s 
estimation of survival is based on a recent comprehensive literature review (Turesson et al., 2018) 
reporting a median survival of 5.42 years among those under the age of 65 years, the sponsor 
maintains the complete prevalence of MM to be 4.34 (0.8*5.42) persons. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000060914 
Page 7/25 
 
 
 
 
 
The COMP was of the opinion that the median survival proposed might be a bit low and does not reflect 
the current situation in Europe. The sponsor should therefore use a more current figure and provide an 
updated prevalence estimate. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
There are several medicinal products authorised in the European Community for treatment of MM. 
Central marketing authorisations include daratumumab (Darzalex), carfilzomib (Kyprolis), bortezomib 
(Velcade and generics), doxorubicin (Caelyx), interferon-α-2b (IntronA/ Alfatronol), lenalidomide 
(Revlimid and generics), thalidomide (generics), panobinostat (Farydak), elotuzumab (Empliciti), 
ixazomib (Ninlaro), pomalidomide (Imnovid), dexamethasone (generics), isatuximab (Sarclisa), 
belantamab mafodotin (Blenrep), selinexor (Nexpovio), and the most recently approved CAR-T cell 
product idecabtagene vicleucel (hereinafter referred to as ide-cel, Abecma; CMA in Aug-2021). In 
addition, several products are authorised at the national level for the treatment of MM, including 
carmustine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, bendamustine, epirubicin, melphalan and vincristine. 
The recently updated European Hematology Association (EHA) and European Society for Medical 
Oncology (ESMO) clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of MM describe 
recommended treatment options available for r/r MM patients in the third- and later lines setting 
(Dimopoulos, Ann Oncol. 2021; 32(3): 309-322). The EHA-ESMO guidelines distinguishes between 
treatment of elderly patients in the non-transplant setting, and younger or more fit patients in good 
clinical condition who are eligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) in the transplant 
setting. Treatments are discussed as regards to front-line treatment, consolidation, maintenance, and 
r/r disease. According to the guidelines, the selection of a proper regimen in third- or subsequent lines 
of therapy for any given patient depends on several parameters such as prior exposure, refractoriness, 
and sensitivity to specific agents or classes of agents in prior lines of therapy. 
The treatment algorithm for MM is evolving rapidly and the therapeutic field for the management of the 
condition is continually changing. Currently, the following agents are specifically authorised in the r/r 
MM setting in the EU: 
•  Second- and later lines: bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, 
daratumumab, isatuximab, and elotuzumab. 
• 
• 
• 
Third- and later lines: pomalidomide, daratumumab, isatuximab, elotuzumab, and panobinostat. 
Fourth- and later lines: ide-cel. 
Fifth- and later lines: belantamab and selinexor.

and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. In this disease setting, ide-cel 
(Abecma) for triple-class exposed patients (prior treatment history with a PI, an IMiD, and an anti-
CD38 antibody) in fourth- or later lines, and belantamab (Blenrep) for triple-class refractory patients 
(refractory to a PI, an IMiD, and an anti-CD38 antibody) and selinexor (Nexpovio) for penta-refractory 
patients (refractory to two PIs, two IMiDs, and an anti-CD38 antibody) in fifth- or later lines, could be 
used. The approved therapeutic indications for these three medicinal products are presented below: 
Abecma (ide-cel; an anti-BCMA CAR-T cell product) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior therapies, including 
an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody and have 
demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. 
Blenrep (belantamab mafodotin; an anti-BCMA mAb) is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of 
multiple myeloma in adult patients, who have received at least four prior therapies and whose disease 
is refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 
monoclonal antibody, and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. 
Nexpovio (selinexor; a selective XPO1-mediated nuclear export inhibitor) is indicated in combination 
with dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients who have received at 
least four prior therapies and whose disease is refractory to at least two proteasome inhibitors, two 
immunomodulatory agents and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and who have demonstrated 
disease progression on the last therapy.  
Of these products, only Abecma is considered relevant for a discussion on the significant benefit of 
cilta-cel in MM since the two latter products only covers either triple- or penta-class refractory patients 
with r/r MM in later treatment lines.

Significant benefit 
The sponsor argued that cilta-cel is of significant benefit over existing methods of treatment for the 
target patient population based on the improved and deepened ORR and prolonged PFS observed in 
the pivotal study CARTITUDE-1. They came for protocol assistance (PA) and raised a question on 
significant benefit which the COMP discussed. The challenge with this condition and the multiple 
choices have been that the treatment landscape has emerging quickly over the last couple of years 
making establishing significant benefit more challenging. The sponsor was therefore reminded by the 
EMA in the PA that the most recent therapeutic alternatives for the intended patient population will 
need to be evaluated for demonstrating significant benefit at the time of MA to maintain the orphan 
medicinal product status. The sponsor confirmed that they have complied with the EMA 
recommendations. 
The sponsor has provided an indirect comparison to each of the recently approved products in the r/r 
MM setting to which the studied patient population in the pivotal study CARTITUDE-1 had not been 
exposed to prior to study entry to support significant benefit based on a clinically relevant advantage in 
terms of improved efficacy. An indirect comparison to the approved BCMA-directed CAR-T cell product 
ide-cel (Abecma) is presented below. 
CARTITUDE-1 is an ongoing, open-label, multicenter, single-arm phase 1b/2 study designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of cilta-cel in adult patients with r/r MM in the fourth- and later lines 
setting. Among 143 patients who consented, 113 completed apheresis and were considered enrolled 
into the study (ITT), of which 97 patients (85.8%) received cilta-cel infusion (mITT). The primary 
endpoint for the phase 2 part is overall response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients who 
achieved a partial response (PR) or better (i.e., stringent complete response [sCR] + CR + very good 
PR [VGPR] + PR) as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) according to the international 
myeloma working group (IMWG) response criteria (Kumar et al., 2016). Secondary efficacy endpoints 
included VGPR/CR/sCR rates, minimal residual disease (MRD) negative rate as defined by the IMWG 
response criteria, clinical benefit rate (CBR; ORR + MR [minimal response]), time-to-response (TTR), 
duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and OS. 
The patients who received cilta-cel infusion in the pivotal study were young (median age 61 years 
[range: 43-78]), but heavily pre-treated since the median number of prior lines of therapy was 6 
(range: 3-18) and around half of the patients (50.5%; 49/97) had received at least 5 prior lines of 
therapy. Among the treated patients, 88.7% (86/97) was double-class refractory (refractory to a PI 
and an IMiD), 87.6% (85/97) was triple-class refractory, and 42.3% (41/97) was penta-class 
refractory. All patients had received a prior anti-CD38-directed treatment and all except for one of the 
treated patients (99.0%; 96/97) were refractory to this therapy. In addition, 99.0% (96/97) were 
refractory to their last line of prior therapy, and 99.0%, 94.8%, 91.8%, 85.6%, and 29.9% had 
previously been exposed to lenalidomide (81.4% refractory), bortezomib (68.0% refractory), 
pomalidomide (83.5% refractory), carfilzomib (64.9% refractory), and ixazomib (27.8% refractory), 
respectively, and 89.7% had underwent a prior ASCT and 8.2% an allogenic SCT. Furthermore, 23.7%, 
21.6%, 11.3%, and 8.2% had been exposed to prior treatment with elotuzumab (19.6% refractory), 
thalidomide (8.2% refractory), panobinostat (8.2% refractory), and isatuximab (7.2% refractory). 
Indirect comparison to Abecma 
The sponsor has conducted an indirect comparison of the outcomes between patients treated with 
cilta-cel (Carvykti) in CARTITUDE-1 (N=97) versus patients treated with ide-cel (Abecma) in KarMMa 
(N=128). To account for confounding bias due to lack of randomization, imbalances between patient 
populations from the two pivotal studies on prognostic patient/disease characteristics were adjusted for 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000060914 
Page 13/25 
 
 
 
 
 
using the approach of unanchored MAIC. The prognostic factors to be considered in the analyses were 
a priori identified and ranked by importance, based on input from independent clinical experts. This is 
considered appropriate based on the single-arm trial design of the two clinical studies. 
KarMMa (also referred to as MM-001) is an open-label, multicenter, multinational, single-arm phase 2 
study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ide-cel in adult patients with r/r MM in the fourth- and later 
lines setting (NCT03361748; clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03361748). The study served as the basis for the 
approval in the EU of ide-cel for use in adult patients with r/r MM after three or more prior lines of 
therapy, including an IMiD, a PI, and an anti-CD38-directed antibody. Of 140 enrolled patients, 128 
received lymphodepleting therapy and were subsequently treated with ide-cel at doses between 150.5 
and 518.4 x 106 anti-BCMA CAR+ T-cells (Munshi et al., 2021). The primary efficacy endpoint of ORR 
was defined using IMWG criteria and adjudicated by an IRC. Secondary efficacy endpoints included CR 
rate (defined as a key secondary endpoint), TTR, DOR, MRD negative rate, time to progression (TTP), 
PFS, and OS. 
The sponsor claimed that a secondary analysis using a similar comparison including all enrolled 
patients from CARTITUDE-1 versus the same patient population as mentioned for KarMMa was not 
possible as the latter study did not report results for all enrolled patients. This is not correct as the 
clinical outcomes for the enrolled patient population in KarMMa have been reported in the approved 
SmPC and are also accessible in the published EPAR for Abecma. 
To quantify the differences in outcomes between CARTITUDE-1 and KarMMa on response rates and 
PFS, individual patient-level data (IPD) were derived from the results in KarMMa, by reconstructing 
reported data for ORR and CR or better and by simulating PFS from digitally scanned published Kaplan 
Meier curves using the validated algorithm published by Guyot and colleagues (Guyot et al., 2012; 
Saluja et al., 2019; Latimer et al., 2011). The derived IPD were then pooled with available IPD from 
CARTITUDE-1 to estimate the relative efficacy of cilta cel versus ide-cel for the response and PFS 
outcomes, using logistic regression and Cox regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios 
(HR), respectively. 
The unanchored MAIC approach to adjust for imbalances in patient characteristics between the patient 
populations in the two clinical studies, involved the following steps: 
1.  Eligibility criteria from KarMMa were applied to the CARTITUDE-1 population whereby only 
patients from CARTITUDE-1 satisfying the eligibility criteria from KarMMa were included in the 
comparative analyses. Only one patient treated with cilta-cel in CARTITUDE-1 who were not 
refractory to the last line of prior therapy was considered ineligible and 96 (99.0%) of the 97 
treated patients in CARTITUDE-1 were therefore included in the analyses. 
2.  Patient-level data from CARTITUDE-1 were then weighted such that their baseline 
characteristics matched the summary-level baseline characteristics as reported for KarMMa. 
This approach is a form of propensity score weighting in which patients from CARTITUDE-1 are 
weighted by their inverse odds of being in that group versus the ide-cel cohort. The propensity 
score model was estimated using the generalized method of moments, including baseline risk 
factors which were commonly available in CARTITUDE-1 and KarMMa (Signorovitch et al., 
2012). This process was done only for the infused patient population from CARTITUDE-1. After 
applying this matching algorithm, the baseline characteristics for the reweighted CARTITUDE-1 
population were balanced versus the comparator KarMMa population. 
3.  Finally, the weighted IPD for CARTITUDE-1 were pooled with the simulated IPD for KarMMa (as 
described above) and analysed using weighted logistic regression and weighted Cox

proportional hazards regression to estimate ORs and HRs (including 95% CIs), reflecting the 
relative benefit for cilta-cel versus ide-cel on ORR/≥CR and PFS.

The sponsor noted following their analysis that the response rates are substantially higher for cilta-cel 
versus ide-cel for both ORR and CR. The results demonstrated that the odds for patients treated with 
cilta-cel to respond to treatment compared to patients treated with ide-cel are 1.4- and 2.2-fold higher 
(with the lower limits of the CIs above 1) in terms of ORR and ≥CR, respectively.

Figure 2.  Observed Response Rates (IRC) Based on Published Results 
The adjusted HRs based on the MAIC approach showed significantly better PFS outcomes for cilta-cel 
versus ide-cel corresponding to a reduction in the risk of progression or death when treated with cilta-
cel of 67% when compared to ide-cel (HR: 0.33 [95% CI: 0.20, 0.54; p<0.0001]).

Prior to adjustment, the HR for DOR for cilta-cel versus ide-cel was 0.33 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.52; 
p<0.0001). The effect of cilta-cel was statistically significantly superior to ide-cel after base case 
adjustment (HR: 0.48 [95% CI: 0.28, 0.81; p=0.0058]). The Grambsch-Therneau test (Grambsch 
1994) for violation of the proportional hazards assumption was non-significant for the base case 
adjusted analysis (p=0.11), indicating that the proportional hazards assumption was not violated. 
PFS data was available for all 124 patients in KarMMa who received infusion with the 300 x 106 and 
450 x 106 anti-BCMA CAR+ T-cells dose cohorts, whereas OS data was only available in the public 
domain for 123 of these patients (the available data removed one patient who received a non-
conforming product that did not meet the product release specifications for ide-cel) (Lin et al., 2021). 
Prior to adjustment, the HR for cilta-cel versus ide-cel was 0.26 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.40; P<0.0001) for 
PFS and 0.39 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.66; P=0.0004) for OS. The effect of cilta-cel for PFS was statistically 
significantly superior to ide-cel after base case adjustment (HR: 0.36 [95% CI: 0.22, 0.59; 
P<0.0001]). For OS, the estimated treatment effect was in favor of cilta-cel (HR: 0.54 [95% CI: 0.29, 
1.01; p=0.0527]), but with widened CIs overlapping 1. The Grambsch-Therneau test for violation of

the proportional hazards assumption was non-significant for both outcomes in the base case adjusted 
analysis (PFS: p=0.60; OS: p=0.17), indicating that the proportional hazard assumption was not 
violated. 
Additional comparative analysis between cilta-cel versus ide-cel by sub-population was also presented. 
The comparisons for both ORR and ≥CR were in favour of cilta-cel across all reported sub-populations, 
and consistent with the results observed for the overall population, with all lower CIs above 1 for all OR 
estimates. The results for PFS were consistently in favour of cilta-cel for the reported subgroups, with 
HR ranging between 0.17 and 0.30, and all upper CIs below 1. The point estimates for the OS HR 
varied between 0.21 and 0.94, all favouring cilta-cel over ide-cel. While the upper CI for the overall 
population was below 1, HR estimates by subgroup were less stable with wider confidence intervals, 
compared to the other endpoints, reflecting low observed number of events within sub-populations. 
The presented OS results therefore need to be interpreted with caution, due to the wide CI around the 
HR point estimates, induced by the low sample size as well as the low number of events by subgroup. 
The sponsor concluded that the outcomes in triple-exposed r/r MM patients are consistently in favour 
of cilta-cel versus ide-cel across all efficacy endpoints and sub-populations that were investigated. It is 
agreed that the reported efficacy results for the unanchored MAIC indicate that r/r MM patients in the 
fourth- and later lines setting treated with cilta-cel seemed to have superior outcomes compared to 
patients treated with ide-cel in the pivotal study KarMMa, with substantially higher as well as deeper 
response rates and extended survival without disease progression for cilta-cel.  
However, the sponsor did not provide any table overview comparing all the baseline characteristics for 
the studied patient populations from the two clinical studies. This information is necessary to be able to 
decide whether the two populations are comparable. In addition, a secondary analysis using a similar 
comparison including all enrolled patients from CARTITUDE-1 versus the same patient population as 
mentioned for KarMMa was not conducted, although the outcomes for the enrolled patient population 
in KarMMa have been reported in the approved SmPC and are also accessible in the published EPAR for 
Abecma. The sponsor should therefore provide these data to further support the claim for significant 
benefit. In addition, the very high OR value >100 reported for the observed and adjusted ORR 
between the cilta-cel and ide-cel groups must be further clarified as it does not seem to be a very 
reliable estimate, and the cause of this extreme outcome is not further explained. The sponsor should 
therefore also present the unadjusted results along with adjusted results to expose the impact of the 
conducted adjustments.

Prevalence 
The sponsor appears to have provided a prevalence which is an underestimate of the situation in 
Europe. The sponsor is invited to revise the prevalence using recent data sources which reflect more 
adequately median survival. 
Significant Benefit 
The sponsor is requested to further elaborate on comparing all the baseline characteristics for the 
studied patient populations from the two clinical studies. In addition, a secondary analysis using a 
similar comparison including all enrolled patients from CARTITUDE-1 versus the same patient 
population as mentioned for KarMMa was not conducted. The sponsor should therefore provide this 
data to further support the claim for significant benefit. In addition, the very high OR value >100 
reported for the observed and adjusted ORR between the cilta-cel and ide-cel groups must be further 
clarified as it does not seem to be a reliable estimate, and the cause of this extreme outcome should 
be further explained. The sponsor should therefore also present the unadjusted results along with 
adjusted results to reveal the impact of the conducted adjustments. 
Comments on sponsor’s response to the COMP list of issues 
The sponsor provided a written response and presented at an oral explanation. 
Concerning the response about the MM prevalence, the sponsor revised the calculation using data 
sources as recommended by the COMP, including ECIS incidence data for 2020, Eurostat mortality 
rates (Eurostat 2020), and recent publications on OS for MM patients by stage (Greipp 2005; Cho 
2017; Kastritis 2017; Usmani 2018) to account for varying estimates across data sources and 
observed increases in the assumed duration of the disease. 
The incidence of MM is consistently reported to be 0.8 per 10,000 people across the EU (ECIS; 2020 
data). However, median OS varies. To approximate the most comprehensive and up to date estimates 
of median OS, the sponsor utilised data from recent publications (Greipp 2005; Cho 2017; Kastritis 
2017; Usmani 2018). Based on these data, the median OS for International Staging System (ISS) 
stage I/II patients, who represent 60-70% of all MM patients, is approximately 7 years. For ISS stage 
III patients, who represent 30-40% of all MM patients, the median OS is approximately 1-4 years. 
Using these estimates, the median OS for the entire MM population was estimated to be 5.8 years ([7 
years*0.6) + (4 years*0.4)]. Using the standard formula P=I*D, the updated prevalence was 
estimated to be (0.8*5.8) = 4.64 per 10,000 persons. Although this is higher than the estimates 
reported in the initial application, it likely reflects the recent increases in survival among patients with 
MM due to therapeutic advances, and it is a conservative approach that utilises recently published 
comprehensive data sources. The sponsor therefore concluded on a revised prevalence estimate for 
MM of 4.64 per 10,000 persons in the EU based on a higher median OS of 5.8 years for the whole 
patient population. The proposed estimate and assumptions are in line with those accepted in recent 
designations for MM and is identical to the orphan maintenance procedure for Abecma. The revised 
prevalence calculation proposed by the sponsor was accepted. 
In response to the question on significant benefit, the sponsor provided a table overview of the 
distribution of clinically important prognostic factors which were commonly reported in the infused and 
enrolled populations from CARTITUDE-1 and KarMMa as requested (Table 4). In addition, a secondary 
analysis using a similar unanchored MAIC approach for the enrolled patient populations from 
CARTITUDE-1 and KarMMa was conducted.

The sponsor concluded that the study populations are very similar, with only minor differences 
between the patient populations in the two clinical studies. Specifically, the infused and enrolled 
populations in KarMMa included slightly more patients with high cytogenetic risk, Revised ISS (R-ISS) 
stage II/III, and plasmacytomas than CARTITUDE-1, and CARTITUDE-1 included slightly more penta-
refractory patients than KarMMA. However, these differences were quite minor and the infused and 
enrolled patients from both studies were considered “functionally high-risk” since all were heavily pre-
treated and had a similarly high median number of prior lines of therapy. The other commonly 
reported baseline characteristics were more balanced across both studies. The observed imbalances for 
these risk factors were adjusted for in the MAIC conducted in the infused populations (as presented in 
the initial orphan maintenance report for cilta-cel) and in the enrolled populations. 
MAIC in the infused and enrolled populations from CARTITUDE-1 and KarMMa 
According to the sponsor, the comparative analyses on the enrolled populations confirmed the results 
of the analyses on the infused populations, with the outcomes being consistently in favour of cilta-cel. 
The sponsor noted following their analysis that the response rates were substantially higher for cilta-
cel versus ide-cel for both ORR and ≥CR. The results presented demonstrated, after MAIC-based 
adjustment for imbalances between study populations on clinically important prognostic factors, that 
the odds of responding to treatment were significantly higher for patients treated with cilta-cel than for 
patients treated with ide-cel (with all lower limits of the confidence intervals [CIs] above 1) for both

populations. In terms of response ratios, patients were 1.36-fold and 1.28-fold more likely to respond 
when treated with cilta-cel versus ide-cel for the infused and the enrolled populations, respectively. 
Similarly, patients were 2.23-fold and 1.96-fold more likely to achieve a ≥CR when treated with cilta-
cel versus ide-cel for the infused and the enrolled populations, respectively.

versus ide-cel for both the infused and enrolled populations. A reduction in the risk of progression or 
death of 67% and 47% is seen for the infused and the enrolled populations, respectively, when treated 
with cilta-cel versus ide-cel. The sponsor concluded that these results showed that the improvement in 
PFS for cilta-cel versus ide-cel is statistically significant and clinically relevant for both populations. 
Discussion on the high odds ratio reported for ORR between cilta-cel and ide-cel 
The sponsor explained upon request that a high absolute value for an odds ratio (OR), as was the case 
for the OR reported for the adjusted ORR among patients infused with cilta-cel versus ide-cel, can be 
observed when a proportion of interest comes close to the boundary of a probability (0 or 1). 
The ORR for patients treated with cilta-cel after MAIC-based adjustment changed from 97.9% to 
99.7%, which corresponds to an odds (defined as the ratio between the percentage of responders and 
non-responders) of 99.7/0.03. The ORR of 73.4% for ide-cel corresponds to an odds of 73.4/26.6. The 
OR is the ratio of the odds of a response versus non-response for both treatments. As the odds for 
cilta-cel is close to 100% (and, therefore, high), the reported value for OR is high. Since the absolute 
values of an OR are difficult to interpret, the sponsor also reported the results of the relative response 
rates, calculated as a ratio of response rates (i.e., relative risk [RR]). 
As requested, the sponsor presented the incremental impact on the reported values of both ORs and 
RRs when the ORR observed in the infused populations were adjusted for after applying the exclusion 
criteria of KarMMa to CARTITUDE-1 and based on selected prognostic factors that were identified as 
clinically important for the MM population (as mentioned above). The relative effects on the ORs after 
the adjustment and matching steps applied are presented in Figure 4. The trend of adjustment noticed 
for the OR and RR was the same. However, the adjustment for OR seems to be more pronounced due 
to the properties of this ratio, as explained above. All estimates for OR and RR were consistently above 
1, indicating better response rates for patients treated with cilta-cel in comparison with ide-cel across 
all sensitivity analyses adjusted for all available important risk factors recorded at baseline.

The sponsor also showed the incremental impact on PFS when adjusting for imbalances in baseline 
characteristics for the infused and enrolled populations. While this adjustment process for the ORR has 
little impact on the comparison between studies, the cumulative adjustment process for PFS has a 
substantial impact. The figures presented illustrated that the adjustment for R-ISS stage has the 
biggest impact on the HR, shifting it from 0.23 to 0.31 in the infused populations, and from 0.35 to 
0.47 in the enrolled populations (Figure 5 and Figure 6). This demonstrated that the comparative 
analyses considering and adjusting for the higher proportion of stage III patients in KarMMa as 
advanced disease was associated with worse outcomes.

The base case, which was presented before, additionally adjusted for the percentage of patients with 
plasmacytomas. The additional impact of adjusting for other baseline characteristics was limited. The 
same pattern was observed for the analyses on both the infused and enrolled populations. The relative 
treatment effect for cilta-cel versus ide-cel was consistently in favour of cilta-cel across all sensitivity 
analyses conducted, with point estimates and upper CIs below 1, illustrating statistically significant 
improved outcomes for cilta-cel.

Figure 6.  Hazards ratio for PFS for Cilta-cel versus Ide-cel (Enrolled population) 
The submitted table overview comparing the distribution of clinically important prognostic factors 
identified a priori for the infused and enrolled populations from CARTITUDE-1 and KarMMa revealed 
that the patient populations from these two clinical studies were similar. However, the infused and 
enrolled populations in KarMMa included more patients with high cytogenetic risk, R-ISS stage II/III, 
and plasmacytomas than CARTITUDE-1, and CARTITUDE-1 included more penta-refractory patients 
than KarMMA. It should be noted that the observed imbalances for these risk factors were adjusted for 
in the unanchored MAIC approach conducted for both the infused and enrolled populations. However, 
this has led to a reduction of the effective sample size in the MAIC approach as compared to the actual 
sample size. 
The reported efficacy results for the MAIC after adjusting for differences of important prognostic 
baseline factors between the study populations indicated that patients with r/r MM in the fourth- and 
later lines setting treated with cilta-cel in CARTITUDE-1 have superior efficacy outcomes compared to 
patients treated with ide-cel in the pivotal study KarMMa. Specifically, higher, deeper response rates 
and prolonged PFS were observed for cilta-cel versus ide-cel in triple-exposed patients with r/r MM. 
The COMP noted that the sponsor had satisfactorily explained the reason for the large OR value >100 
reported for the adjusted ORR between patients treated with cilta-cel versus ide-cel, which appear to 
be caused by the high ORR for the cilta-cel treated group that approached the boundary of a 
probability of 1. It was therefore emphasised that the results of the relative response rates reported as 
RRs were more reliable for the interpretation of the MAIC. 
The efficacy data from CARTITUDE-1 combined with the presented outcomes of the unanchored MAIC 
approach provide adequate evidence to support the claim for significant benefit of cilta-cel based on

better efficacy in terms of higher and deeper response rates compared to ide-cel in triple-exposed 
patients with r/r MM. 
The COMP concluded that it could recommend maintaining the orphan designation.

5.  COMP position adopted on 13 April 2022 
The COMP concluded that: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of multiple myeloma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 4.6 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to development of hypercalcemia, 
renal insufficiency, anaemia, bone lesions, and reduced life expectancy; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Carvykti may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition still holds. The sponsor has provided clinical data that 
demonstrated improved and sustained complete response rates after treatment with Carvykti as 
compared to Abecma in adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, who have 
received at least three prior therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory 
agent and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph) of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Carvykti, autologous human T 
cells genetically modified ex-vivo with a lentiviral vector encoding a chimeric antigen receptor for B-cell 
maturation antigen, ciltacabtagene autoleucel for treatment of multiple myeloma (EU/3/20/2252) is 
not removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

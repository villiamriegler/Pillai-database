Management of infusion-related reactions
Pre-infusion medicinal products should be administered to reduce the risk of infusion-related reactions 
(IRRs) prior to treatment with DARZALEX.
4
For IRRs of any grade/severity, immediately interrupt the DARZALEX infusion and manage 
symptoms.
Management of IRRs may further require reduction in the rate of infusion, or treatment 
discontinuation of DARZALEX as outlined below (see section 4.4).

Grade 1-2 (mild to moderate): Once reaction symptoms resolve, the infusion should be resumed 
at no more than half the rate at which the IRR occurred. If the patient does not experience any 
further IRR symptoms, infusion rate escalation may be resumed at increments and intervals as 
clinically appropriate up to the maximum rate of 200 mL/hour (table 5).
Grade 3 (severe): Once reaction symptoms resolve, restarting of the infusion may be considered 
at no more than half the rate at which the reaction occurred. If the patient does not experience 
additional symptoms, infusion rate escalation may be resumed at increments and intervals as 
appropriate (table 5). The procedure above should be repeated in the event of recurrence of 
grade 3 symptoms. Permanently discontinue DARZALEX upon the third occurrence of a 
grade 3 or greater infusion reaction.
Grade 4 (life-threatening): Permanently discontinue DARZALEX treatment.


Missed dose
If a planned dose of DARZALEX is missed, the dose should be administered as soon as possible and 
the dosing schedule should be adjusted accordingly, maintaining the treatment interval.
Dose modifications
No dose reductions of DARZALEX are recommended. Dose delay may be required to allow recovery 
of blood cell counts in the event of haematological toxicity (see section 4.4). For information 
concerning medicinal products given in combination with DARZALEX, see corresponding Summary 
of Product Characteristics.
Recommended concomitant medicinal products
Pre-infusion medicinal product
Pre-infusion medicinal products should be administered to reduce the risk of IRRs to all patients 1-
3 hours prior to every infusion of DARZALEX as follows:

Corticosteroid (long-acting or intermediate-acting)
-
-
Monotherapy:
Methylprednisolone 100 mg, or equivalent, administered intravenously. Following the 
second infusion, the dose of corticosteroid may be reduced (oral or intravenous 
methylprednisolone 60 mg).
Combination therapy:
Dexamethasone 20 mg (or equivalent), administered prior to every DARZALEX 
infusion. When dexamethasone is the background-regimen specific corticosteroid, the 
dexamethasone treatment dose will instead serve as pre-infusion medicinal product on 
DARZALEX infusion days (see section 5.1).
Dexamethasone is given intravenously prior to the first DARZALEX infusion and oral 
administration may be considered prior to subsequent infusions. Additional background 
regimen specific corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) should not be taken on DARZALEX 
infusion days when patients have received dexamethasone as a pre-infusion medicinal 
product.


Antipyretics (oral paracetamol 650 to 1000 mg)
Antihistamine (oral or intravenous diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg or equivalent).
5
Post-infusion medicinal product
Post-infusion medicinal products should be administered to reduce the risk of delayed IRRs as 
follows:
-
-
Monotherapy:
Oral corticosteroid (20 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent dose of an 
intermediate-acting or long-acting corticosteroid in accordance with local standards) 
should be administered on each of the two days following all infusions (beginning the day 
after the infusion).
Combination therapy:
Consider administering low-dose oral methylprednisolone (≤ 20 mg) or equivalent the 
day after the DARZALEX infusion. However, if a background regimen-specific 
corticosteroid (e.g. dexamethasone, prednisone) is administered the day after the 
DARZALEX infusion, additional post-infusion medicinal products may not be needed 
(see section 5.1).
Additionally, for patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the use of 
post-infusion medicinal products including short and long acting bronchodilators, and inhaled 
corticosteroids should be considered. Following the first four infusions, if the patient experiences no 
major IRRs, these inhaled post-infusion medicinal products may be discontinued at the discretion of 
the physician.
Prophylaxis for herpes zoster virus reactivation
Anti-viral prophylaxis should be considered for the prevention of herpes zoster virus reactivation.
Special populations
Renal impairment
No formal studies of daratumumab in patients with renal impairment have been conducted. Based on 
population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal 
impairment (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No formal studies of daratumumab in patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted.
Based on population PK analyses, no dose adjustments are necessary for patients with hepatic 
impairment (see section 5.2).
Elderly
No dose adjustments are considered necessary (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of DARZALEX in children aged below 18 years of age have not been 
established.
No data are available.
Method of administration
DARZALEX is for intravenous use. It is administered as an intravenous infusion following dilution 
with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. For instructions on dilution of the 
medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Infusion-related reactions
DARZALEX can cause serious IRRs, including anaphylactic reactions (see section 4.8). These 
reactions can be life-threatening and fatal outcomes have been reported.
All patients should be monitored throughout the infusion for IRRs. For patients that experience any 
grade IRRs, continue monitoring post-infusion until symptoms resolve.
In clinical studies, IRRs were reported in approximately half of all patients treated with DARZALEX.
The majority of IRRs occurred at the first infusion and were grade 1-2 (see section 4.8). Four percent 
of all patients had an IRR at more than one infusion. Severe reactions have occurred, including 
bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnoea, hypertension, laryngeal oedema, pulmonary oedema and ocular 
adverse reactions (including choroidal effusion, acute myopia and acute angle closure glaucoma). 
Symptoms predominantly included nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, chills, vomiting and 
nausea. Less common symptoms were wheezing, allergic rhinitis, pyrexia, chest discomfort, pruritus,
hypotension and blurred vision (see section 4.8).
Patients should be pre-medicated with antihistamines, antipyretics and corticosteroids to reduce the 
risk of IRRs prior to treatment with DARZALEX. DARZALEX infusion should be interrupted for
IRRs of any severity and medical management/supportive treatment for IRRs should be instituted as 
needed. For patients with grade 1, 2, or 3 IRRs, the infusion rate should be reduced when re-starting 
the infusion. If an anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (grade 4) infusion reaction occurs, 
appropriate emergency resuscitation should be initiated immediately. DARZALEX therapy should be 
discontinued immediately and permanently (see sections 4.2 and 4.3).
To reduce the risk of delayed IRRs, oral corticosteroids should be administered to all patients 
following DARZALEX infusions. Additionally the use of post-infusion medicinal products (e.g. 
inhaled corticosteroids, short and long acting bronchodilators) should be considered for patients with a 
history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to manage respiratory complications should they 
occur. If ocular symptoms occur, interrupt DARZALEX infusion and seek immediate ophthalmologic 
evaluation prior to restarting DARZALEX (see section 4.2).
Neutropenia/thrombocytopenia
DARZALEX may increase neutropenia and thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy (see 
section 4.8).
Complete blood cell counts should be monitored periodically during treatment according to 
prescribing information for background therapies. Patients with neutropenia should be monitored for 
signs of infection. DARZALEX delay may be required to allow recovery of blood cell counts. No dose 
reduction of DARZALEX is recommended. Consider supportive care with transfusions or growth 
factors.
Interference with indirect antiglobulin test (indirect Coombs test)
Daratumumab binds to CD38 found at low levels on red blood cells (RBCs) and may result in a 
positive indirect Coombs test. Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect Coombs test may persist for 
up to 6 months after the last daratumumab infusion. It should be recognised that daratumumab bound 
to RBCs may mask detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient’s serum. The determination 
of a patient’s ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted.
7
Patients should be typed and screened prior to starting daratumumab treatment. Phenotyping may be 
considered prior to starting daratumumab treatment as per local practice. Red blood cell genotyping is 
not impacted by daratumumab and may be performed at any time.
In the event of a planned transfusion blood transfusion centres should be notified of this interference 
with indirect antiglobulin tests (see section 4.5). If an emergency transfusion is required, 
non-cross-matched ABO/RhD-compatible RBCs can be given per local blood bank practices.
Interference with determination of complete response
Daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both, the serum 
protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of 
endogenous M-protein (see section 4.5). This interference can impact the determination of complete 
response and of disease progression in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation
Hepatitis B virus reactivation, in some cases fatal, has been reported in patients treated with 
DARZALEX. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment with 
DARZALEX.
For patients with evidence of positive HBV serology, monitor for clinical and laboratory signs of HBV 
reactivation during, and for at least six months following the end of DARZALEX treatment. Manage 
patients according to current clinical guidelines. Consider consulting a hepatitis disease expert as 
clinically indicated.
In patients who develop reactivation of HBV while on DARZALEX, suspend treatment with 
DARZALEX and institute appropriate treatment. Resumption of DARZALEX treatment in patients 
whose HBV reactivation is adequately controlled should be discussed with physicians with expertise 
in managing HBV.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) 
must not be given this medicinal product unless strictly necessary.
A detailed history with regard to HFI symptoms has to be taken of each patient prior to being given 
this medicinal product.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
As an IgG1қ monoclonal antibody, renal excretion and hepatic enzyme-mediated metabolism of intact 
daratumumab are unlikely to represent major elimination routes. As such, variations in 
drug-metabolising enzymes are not expected to affect the elimination of daratumumab. Due to the 
high affinity to a unique epitope on CD38, daratumumab is not anticipated to alter drug-metabolising 
enzymes.
Clinical pharmacokinetic assessments of daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide, 
pomalidomide, thalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone indicated no clinically-relevant drug-drug 
interaction between daratumumab and these small molecule medicinal products.
Interference with indirect antiglobulin test (indirect Coombs test)
Daratumumab binds to CD38 on RBCs and interferes with compatibility testing, including antibody 
screening and cross matching (see section 4.4). Daratumumab interference mitigation methods include 
treating reagent RBCs with dithiothreitol (DTT) to disrupt daratumumab binding or other locally 
8
validated methods. Since the Kell blood group system is also sensitive to DTT treatment, 
Kell-negative units should be supplied after ruling out or identifying alloantibodies using DTT-treated 
RBCs. Alternatively, phenotyping or genotyping may also be considered (see section 4.4).
Interference with serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation tests
Daratumumab may be detected on serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) 
assays used for monitoring disease monoclonal immunoglobulins (M protein). This can lead to false 
positive SPE and IFE assay results for patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein impacting initial 
assessment of complete responses by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. In 
patients with persistent very good partial response, where daratumumab interference is suspected, 
consider using a validated daratumumab-specific IFE assay to distinguish daratumumab from any 
remaining endogenous M protein in the patient’s serum, to facilitate determination of a complete 
response.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of child-bearing potential/contraception
Women of child-bearing potential should use effective contraception during, and for 3 months after 
cessation of daratumumab treatment.
Pregnancy
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of daratumumab in pregnant women. Animal 
studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). DARZALEX is not 
recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether daratumumab is excreted in human milk.
A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from DARZALEX therapy taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.
Fertility
No data are available to determine potential effects of daratumumab on fertility in males or females 
(see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
DARZALEX has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, fatigue 
has been reported in patients taking daratumumab and this should be taken into account when driving 
or using machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most frequent adverse reactions of any grade (≥ 20% patients) were IRRs, fatigue, nausea, 
diarrhoea, constipation, pyrexia, dyspnoea, cough, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, oedema 
peripheral, asthenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy and upper respiratory tract infection. Serious 
adverse reactions were sepsis, pneumonia, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, pulmonary 
oedema, influenza, pyrexia, dehydration, diarrhoea and atrial fibrillation.
9
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Table 6 summarises the adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving DARZALEX. The data 
reflects exposure to DARZALEX (16 mg/kg) in 2066 patients with multiple myeloma including 
1910 patients who received DARZALEX in combination with background regimens and 156 patients 
who received DARZALEX as monotherapy. Post-marketing adverse reactions are also included.
In study MMY3006, the number of CD34+ cell yield was numerically lower in the D-VTd arm 
compared with the VTd arm (Median: D-VTd: 6.3 x 106/kg; VTd 8.9 x 106/kg) and among those who 
completed mobilisation, more patients in the D-VTd group received plerixafor compared to those in 
the VTd arm (D-VTd: 21.7%; VTd: 7.9%). The rates of engraftment and haematopoietic reconstitution 
was similar among the transplanted subjects in the D-VTd and VTd arms (D-VTd: 99.8%; VTd: 
99.6%; as measured by the recovery of neutrophils > 0.5 x 109/L, leukocytes > 1.0 x 109/L, and 
platelets > 50 x 109/L without transfusion).
Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1000 
to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10000 to < 1/1000) and very rare (< 1/10000). Within each frequency grouping 
adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

Post-marketing adverse reaction.
Infusion-related reaction includes terms determined by investigators to be related to infusion, see below.
Incidence is based on a subset of patients who received at least one dose of study treatment on or after 01 February 2020 
(the start of the COVID-19 pandemic) from studies MMY3003, MMY3006, MMY3008 and MMY3013.
Description of selected adverse reactions
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs)
In clinical studies (monotherapy and combination treatments; N=2066) the incidence of any grade 
IRRs was 37% with the first (16 mg/kg, week 1) infusion of DARZALEX, 2% with the week 2 
infusion, and cumulatively 6% with subsequent infusions. Less than 1% of patients had a grade 3/4 
IRR with the week 2 or subsequent infusions.
The median time to onset of a reaction was 1.5 hours (range: 0 to 72.8 hours). The incidence of 
infusion modifications due to reactions was 36%. Median durations of 16 mg/kg infusions for the 1st
week, 2nd week and subsequent infusions were approximately 7, 4 and 3 hours respectively.
Severe IRRs included bronchospasm, dyspnoea, laryngeal oedema, pulmonary oedema, ocular adverse 
reactions (including choroidal effusion, acute myopia and acute angle closure glaucoma), hypoxia, and 
hypertension. Other adverse IRRs included nasal congestion, cough, chills, throat irritation, blurred 
vision, vomiting and nausea (see section 4.4).
When DARZALEX dosing was interrupted in the setting of ASCT (study MMY3006) for a median of 
3.75 (range: 2.4; 6.9) months, upon re-initiation of DARZALEX the incidence of IRRs was 11% at 
first infusion following ASCT. Infusion rate/dilution volume used upon re-initiation was that used for 
the last DARZALEX infusion prior to interruption due to ASCT. IRRs occurring at re-initiation of 
DARZALEX following ASCT were consistent in terms of symptoms and severity (grade 3/4: < 1%) 
with those reported in previous studies at week 2 or subsequent infusions.
In study MMY1001, patients receiving daratumumab combination treatment (n=97) were administered 
the first 16 mg/kg daratumumab dose at week 1 split over two days i.e. 8 mg/kg on day 1 and day 2 
respectively. The incidence of any grade IRRs was 42%, with 36% of patients experiencing IRRs on 
day 1 of week 1, 4% on day 2 of week 1, and 8% with subsequent infusions. The median time to onset 
of a reaction was 1.8 hours (range: 0.1 to 5.4 hours). The incidence of infusion interruptions due to 
reactions was 30%. Median durations of infusions were 4.2 h for week 1-day 1, 4.2 h for week 1-
day 2, and 3.4 hours for the subsequent infusions.
Infections
In patients receiving DARZALEX combination therapy, grade 3 or 4 infections were reported as 
follows:
Relapsed/refractory patient studies: DVd: 21%, Vd: 19%; DRd: 28%, Rd: 23%; DPd: 28%
Newly diagnosed patient studies: D-VMP: 23%, VMP: 15%; DRd: 32%, Rd: 23%; D-VTd: 22%, 
VTd: 20%.
11
Pneumonia was the most commonly reported severe (grade 3 or 4) infection across studies. In active 
controlled studies, discontinuations from treatment due to infections occurred in 1-4% of patients. 
Fatal infections were primarily due to pneumonia and sepsis.
In patients receiving DARZALEX combination therapy, fatal infections (grade 5) were reported as 
follows:
Relapsed/refractory patient studies: DVd: 1%, Vd: 2%; DRd: 2%, Rd: 1%; DPd: 2%
Newly diagnosed patient studies: D-VMP: 1%, VMP: 1%; DRd: 2%, Rd: 2%; DVTd: 0%, VTd: 0%.
Key: D=daratumumab; Vd=bortezomib-dexamethasone; Rd=lenalidomide-dexamethasone; Pd=pomalidomide-
dexamethasone; VMP=bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone; VTd=bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone.
Haemolysis
There is a theoretical risk of haemolysis. Continuous monitoring for this safety signal will be 
performed in clinical studies and post-marketing safety data.
Other special populations
In the phase III study MMY3007, which compared treatment with D-VMP to treatment with VMP in 
patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell 
transplant, safety analysis of the subgroup of patients with an ECOG performance score of 2 (D-VMP: 
n=89, VMP: n=84), was consistent with the overall population (see section 5.1).
Elderly patients
Of the 2459 patients who received DARZALEX at the recommended dose, 38% were 65 to 75 years 
of age, and 15% were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed 
based on age. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was higher in older than in younger patients. 
Among patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (n=1213), the most common serious 
adverse reactions that occurred more frequently in elderly (≥ 65 years of age) were pneumonia and 
sepsis. Among patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous 
stem cell transplant (n=710), the most common serious adverse reaction that occurred more frequently 
in elderly (≥ 75 years of age) was pneumonia.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Symptoms and signs
There has been no experience of overdose in clinical studies. Doses up to 24 mg/kg have been 
administered intravenously in a clinical study.
Treatment
There is no known specific antidote for daratumumab overdose. In the event of an overdose, the 
patient should be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate 
symptomatic treatment should be instituted immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug 
conjugates, CD38 (Clusters of Differentiation 38) inhibitors, ATC code: L01FC01.
Mechanism of action
Daratumumab is an IgG1κ human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the CD38 protein 
expressed at a high level on the surface of multiple myeloma tumour cells, as well as other cell types 
and tissues at various levels. CD38 protein has multiple functions such as receptor mediated adhesion, 
signalling and enzymatic activity.
Daratumumab has been shown to potently inhibit the in vivo growth of CD38-expressing tumour cells. 
Based on in vitro studies, daratumumab may utilise multiple effector functions, resulting in immune 
mediated tumour cell death. These studies suggest that daratumumab can induce tumour cell lysis 
through complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and 
antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis in malignancies expressing CD38. A subset of myeloid 
derived suppressor cells (CD38+MDSCs), regulatory T cells (CD38+Tregs) and B cells (CD38+Bregs) 
are decreased by daratumumab mediated cell lysis. T cells (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+) are also known 
to express CD38 depending on the stage of development and the level of activation. Significant 
increases in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell absolute counts, and percentages of lymphocytes, were observed 
with daratumumab treatment in peripheral whole blood and bone marrow. In addition, T-cell receptor 
DNA sequencing verified that T-cell clonality was increased with daratumumab treatment, indicating 
immune modulatory effects that may contribute to clinical response.
Daratumumab induced apoptosis in vitro after Fc mediated cross-linking. In addition, daratumumab 
modulated CD38 enzymatic activity, inhibiting the cyclase enzyme activity and stimulating the 
hydrolase activity. The significance of these in vitro effects in a clinical setting, and the implications 
on tumour growth, are not well-understood.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Natural killer (NK) cell and T-cell count
NK cells are known to express high levels of CD38 and are susceptible to daratumumab mediated cell 
lysis. Decreases in absolute counts and percentages of total NK cells (CD16+CD56+) and activated 
(CD16+CD56dim) NK cells in peripheral whole blood and bone marrow were observed with 
daratumumab treatment. However, baseline levels of NK cells did not show an association with 
clinical response.
Immunogenicity
In patients treated with intravenous daratumumab in clinical studies, less than 1% of patients 
developed treatment-emergent anti-daratumumab antibodies.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
Combination treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients ineligible for autologous 
stem cell transplant
Study MMY3008, an open-label, randomised, active-controlled phase III study, compared treatment 
with DARZALEX 16 mg/kg in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (DRd) to 
treatment with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) in patients with newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide (25 mg once daily orally on days 1-21 of repeated 28-day [4-week] 
cycles) was given with low dose oral or intravenous dexamethasone 40 mg/week (or a reduced dose of 
20 mg/week for patients > 75 years or body mass index [BMI] < 18.5). On DARZALEX infusion 
13
days, the dexamethasone dose was given as a pre-infusion medicinal product. Dose adjustments for 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone were applied according to manufacturer’s prescribing information. 
Treatment was continued in both arms until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
A total of 737 patients were randomised: 368 to the DRd arm and 369 to the Rd arm. The baseline 
demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. The median 
age was 73 (range: 45-90) years, with 44% of the patients ≥ 75 years of age. The majority were white 
(92%), male (52%), 34% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 
0, 49.5% had an ECOG performance score of 1 and 17% had an ECOG performance score of ≥ 2. 
Twenty-seven percent had International Staging System (ISS) stage I, 43% had ISS stage II and 29% 
had ISS stage III disease. Efficacy was evaluated by progression free survival (PFS) based on 
International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria and overall survival (OS).
With a median follow-up of 28 months, the primary analysis of PFS in study MMY3008 showed an 
improvement in the DRd arm as compared to the Rd arm; the median PFS had not been reached in the 
DRd arm and was 31.9 months in the Rd arm (hazard ratio [HR]=0.56; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.73; 
p < 0.0001), representing 44% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in patients treated 
with DRd. Results of an updated PFS analysis after a median follow-up of 64 months continued to 
show an improvement in PFS for patients in the DRd arm compared with the Rd arm. Median PFS 
was 61.9 months in the DRd arm and 34.4 months in the Rd arm (HR=0.55; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.67).
Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier curve of PFS in study MMY3008
With a median follow-up of 56 months, DRd has shown an OS advantage over the Rd arm (HR=0.68; 
95% CI: 0.53, 0.86; p=0.0013). Results of an updated OS analysis after a median of 64 months
continued to show an improvement in OS for patients in the DRd arm compared to the Rd arm. 
Median OS was not reached in the DRd arm and was 65.5 months in the Rd arm (HR=0.66;
95% CI: 0.53, 0.83).

Combination treatment with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (VMP) in patients ineligible for 
autologous stem cell transplant
Study MMY3007, an open-label, randomised, active-controlled phase III study, compared treatment 
with DARZALEX 16 mg/kg in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (D-VMP), to 
treatment with VMP in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Bortezomib was 
administered by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly at 
weeks 1, 2, 4 and 5 for the first 6-week cycle (cycle 1; 8 doses), followed by once weekly 
administrations at weeks 1, 2, 4 and 5 for eight more 6-week cycles (cycles 2-9; 4 doses per cycle). 
Melphalan at 9 mg/m2, and prednisone at 60 mg/m2 were orally administered on days 1 to 4 of the nine 
6-week cycles (cycles 1-9). DARZALEX treatment was continued until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity.
A total of 706 patients were randomised: 350 to the D-VMP arm and 356 to the VMP arm. The 
baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. The 
median age was 71 (range: 40-93) years, with 30% of the patients ≥ 75 years of age. The majority
were white (85%), female (54%), 25% had an ECOG performance score of 0, 50% had an ECOG 
performance score of 1 and 25% had an ECOG performance score of 2. Patients had IgG/IgA/Light 
chain myeloma in 64%/22%/10% of instances, 19% had ISS stage I, 42% had ISS stage II, 38% had 
ISS stage III disease and 84% had standard risk cytogenetics. Efficacy was evaluated by PFS based on 
IMWG criteria and overall survival (OS).
With a median follow-up of 16.5 months, the primary analysis of PFS in study MMY3007 showed an 
improvement in the D-VMP arm as compared to the VMP arm; the median PFS had not been reached 
in the D-VMP arm and was 18.1 months in the VMP arm (HR=0.5; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.65; p < 0.0001). 
Results of an updated PFS analysis after a median follow-up of 40 months continued to show an 
improvement in PFS for patients in the D-VMP arm compared with the VMP arm. Median PFS was 
36.4 months in the D-VMP arm and 19.3 months in the VMP arm (HR=0.42; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.51; 
p < 0.0001), representing a 58% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in patients treated 
with D-VMP.

Figure 3: Kaplan-Meier curve of PFS in study MMY3007
After a median follow-up of 40 months, D-VMP has shown an OS advantage over the VMP arm 
(HR=0.60; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.80; p=0.0003), representing a 40% reduction in the risk of death in patients 
treated in the D-VMP arm. Median OS was not reached for either arm.

In responders, the median time to response was 0.79 months (range: 0.4 to 15.5 months) in the 
D-VMP group and 0.82 months (range: 0.7 to 12.6 months) in the VMP group. The median duration 
18
of response had not been reached in the D-VMP group and was 21.3 months (range: 18.4, not 
estimable) in the VMP group.
A subgroup analysis was performed on patients at least 70 years old, or those 65-69 years old with 
ECOG performance score of 2, or aged less than 65 years of age with significant comorbidity or 
ECOG performance score of 2 (D-VMP: n=273, VMP: n=270). The efficacy results in this subgroup 
were consistent with the overall population. In this subgroup, median PFS was not reached in the 
D-VMP group and was 17.9 months in the VMP group (HR=0.56; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.75; p < 0.0001). 
The overall response rate was 90% in the D-VMP group and 74% in theVMP group (VGPR rate:29% 
in D-VMP group and 26% in VMP group; CR: 22% in D-VMP group and 18% in VMP group; sCR 
rate: 20% in D-VMP group and 7% in VMP group). The safety results of this subgroup were 
consistent with the overall population. Furthermore, safety analysis of the subgroup of patients with an 
ECOG performance score of 2 (D-VMP: n=89, VMP: n=84), was also consistent with the overall 
population.
Combination treatment with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (VTd) in patients eligible for 
autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)
Study MMY3006 is a 2 part, open-label, randomised, active-controlled phase III study. Part 1 
compared induction and consolidation treatment with DARZALEX 16 mg/kg in combination with 
bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (D-VTd) to treatment with bortezomib, thalidomide and 
dexamethasone (VTd) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma eligible for ASCT. The 
consolidation phase of treatment began a minimum of 30 days post-ASCT, when the patient had 
recovered sufficiently, and engraftment was complete. In part 2, subjects with at least a partial 
response (PR) by day 100 post-transplant were re-randomised in a 1:1 ratio to daratumumab 
maintenance or observation only. Only results from part 1 are described henceforth.
Bortezomib was administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous injection at a dose of 
1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks (days 1, 4, 8, and 11) of repeated 28 day 
(4-week) induction treatment cycles (cycles 1-4) and two consolidation cycles (cycles 5 and 6) 
following ASCT after cycle 4. Thalidomide was administered orally at 100 mg daily during the six 
bortezomib cycles. Dexamethasone (oral or intravenous) was administered at 40 mg on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 
15, 16, 22 and 23 of cycles 1 and 2, and at 40 mg on days 1-2 and 20 mg on subsequent dosing days 
(days 8, 9, 15, 16) of cycles 3-4. Dexamethasone 20 mg was administered on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16 in 
cycles 5 and 6. On the days of DARZALEX infusion, the dexamethasone dose was administered 
intravenously as a pre-infusion medicinal product. Dose adjustments for bortezomib, thalidomide and 
dexamethasone were applied according to manufacturer’s prescribing information.
A total of 1085 patients were randomised: 543 to the D-VTd arm and 542 to the VTd arm. The 
baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. The 
median age was 58 (range: 22 to 65) years. All patients were ≤ 65 years: 43% were in the age group 
≥ 60-65 years, 41% were in the age group ≥ 50-60 years and 16% below age of 50 years. The majority 
were male (59%), 48% had an ECOG performance score of 0, 42% had an ECOG performance score 
of 1 and 10% had an ECOG performance score of 2. Forty percent had International Staging System 
(ISS) stage I, 45% had ISS stage II and 15% had ISS stage III disease.
Efficacy was evaluated by the stringent complete response (sCR) rate at day 100 post-transplant and 
PFS.

Relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma
Monotherapy:
The clinical efficacy and safety of DARZALEX monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma whose prior therapy included a proteasome inhibitor and an 
immunomodulatory agent and who had demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy, was 
demonstrated in two open-label studies.
In study MMY2002, 106 patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma received 16 mg/kg 
DARZALEX until disease progression. The median patient age was 63.5 years (range, 31 to 84 years), 
11% of patients were ≥ 75 years of age, 49% were male and 79% were Caucasian. Patients had 
received a median of 5 prior lines of therapy. Eighty percent of patients had received prior autologous 
stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Prior therapies included bortezomib (99%), lenalidomide (99%), 
pomalidomide (63%) and carfilzomib (50%). At baseline, 97% of patients were refractory to the last 
line of treatment, 95% were refractory to both, a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and immunomodulatory 
agent (IMiD), 77% were refractory to alkylating agents, 63% were refractory to pomalidomide and 
48% of patients were refractory to carfilzomib.
Efficacy results of the pre-planned interim analysis based on Independent Review Committee (IRC)

Overall response rate (ORR) in MMY2002 was similar regardless of type of prior anti-myeloma 
therapy.
At a survival update with a median duration of follow-up of 14.7 months, median OS was 17.5 months 
(95% CI: 13.7, not estimable).
In study GEN501, 42 patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma received 16 mg/kg 
DARZALEX until disease progression. The median patient age was 64 years (range, 44 to 76 years), 
64% were male and 76% were Caucasian. Patients in the study had received a median of 4 prior lines 
of therapy. Seventy-four percent of patients had received prior ASCT. Prior therapies included 
bortezomib (100%), lenalidomide (95%), pomalidomide (36%) and carfilzomib (19%). At baseline, 
76% of patients were refractory to the last line of treatment, 64% were refractory to both a PI and 
IMiD, 60% were refractory to alkylating agents, 36% were refractory to pomalidomide and 17% were 
refractory to carfilzomib.
Pre-planned interim analysis showed that treatment with daratumumab at 16 mg/kg led to a 36% ORR 
with 5% CR and 5% VGPR. The median time to response was 1 (range: 0.5 to 3.2) month. The 
median duration of response was not reached (95% CI: 5.6 months, not estimable).
At a survival update with a median duration of follow-up of 15.2 months, median OS was not reached 
(95% CI: 19.9 months, not estimable), with 74% of subjects still alive.
Combination treatment with lenalidomide
Study MMY3003, an open-label, randomised, active-controlled phase III study, compared treatment 
with DARZALEX 16 mg/kg in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (DRd) to 
treatment with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) in patients with relapsed or refractory 
multiple myeloma who had received at least one prior therapy. Lenalidomide (25 mg once daily orally 
on days 1-21 of repeated 28-day [4-week] cycles) was given with low dose dexamethasone at 
40 mg/week (or a reduced dose of 20 mg/week for patients > 75 years or BMI < 18.5). On 
DARZALEX infusion days, 20 mg of the dexamethasone dose was given as a pre-infusion medicinal 
product and the remainder given the day after the infusion. Treatment was continued in both arms until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
A total of 569 patients were randomised; 286 to the DRd arm and 283 to the Rd arm. The baseline 
demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the DARZALEX and the control arm. 
The median patient age was 65 years (range 34 to 89 years) and 11% were ≥ 75 years. The majority of 
patients (86%) received a prior PI, 55% of patients had received a prior IMiD, including 18% of 
patients who had received prior lenalidomide; and 44% of patients had received both a prior PI and 
IMiD. At baseline, 27% of patients were refractory to the last line of treatment. Eighteen percent 
(18%) of patients were refractory to a PI only, and 21% were refractory to bortezomib. Patients 
refractory to lenalidomide were excluded from the study.

With a median follow-up of 13.5 months, the primary analysis of PFS in study MMY3003 
demonstrated an improvement in the DRd arm as compared to the Rd arm; the median PFS had not 
been reached in the DRd arm and was 18.4 months in the Rd arm (HR=0.37; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.52; 
p < 0.0001). Results of an updated PFS analysis after a median follow-up of 55 months continued to 
show an improvement in PFS for patients in the DRd arm compared with the Rd arm. Median PFS 
was 45.0 months in the DRd arm and 17.5 months in the Rd arm (HR=0.44; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.54; 
p < 0.0001), representing a 56% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in patients treated 
with DRd (see figure 6).

Combination treatment with bortezomib
Study MMY3004, an open-label, randomised, active-controlled phase III study, compared treatment 
with DARZALEX 16 mg/kg in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd), to treatment 
with bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma 
who had received at least one prior therapy. Bortezomib was administered by subcutaneous injection 
or intravenous injection at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks (days 1, 
4, 8, and 11) of repeated 21 day (3-week) treatment cycles, for a total of 8 cycles. Dexamethasone was 
administered orally at a dose of 20 mg on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of each of the 8 bortezomib 
cycles (80 mg/week for two out of three weeks of the bortezomib cycle) or a reduced dose of 
24
20 mg/week for patients > 75 years, BMI < 18.5, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus or prior 
intolerance to steroid therapy. On the days of DARZALEX infusion, 20 mg of the dexamethasone 
dose was administered as a pre-infusion medicinal product. DARZALEX treatment was continued 
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
A total of 498 patients were randomised; 251 to the DVd arm and 247 to the Vd arm. The baseline 
demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the DARZALEX and the control arm. 
The median patient age was 64 years (range 30 to 88 years) and 12% were ≥ 75 years. 
Sixty-nine percent (69%) of patients had received a prior PI (66% received bortezomib) and 76% of 
patients received an IMiD (42% received lenalidomide). At baseline, 32% of patients were refractory 
to the last line of treatment. Thirty-three percent (33%) of patients were refractory to an IMiD only, 
and 28% were refractory to lenalidomide. Patients refractory to bortezomib were excluded from the 
study.
With a median follow-up of 7.4 months, the primary analysis of PFS in study MMY3004 
demonstrated an improvement in the DVd arm as compared to the Vd arm; the median PFS had not 
been reached in the DVd arm and was 7.2 months in the Vd arm (HR [95% CI]: 0.39 [0.28, 0.53]; 
p-value < 0.0001). Results of an updated PFS analysis after a median follow-up of 50 months 
continued to show an improvement in PFS for patients in the DVd arm compared with the Vd arm. 
Median PFS was 16.7 months in the DVd arm and 7.1 months in the Vd arm (HR [95% CI]: 0.31 
[0.24, 0.39]; p-value < 0.0001), representing a 69% reduction in the risk of disease progression or 
death in patients treated with DVd versus Vd (see figure 8).

Cardiac electrophysiology
Daratumumab as a large protein has a low likelihood of direct ion channel interactions. The effect of 
daratumumab on the QTc interval was evaluated in an open-label study for 83 patients (study 
GEN501) with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma following daratumumab infusions (4 to 
26
24 mg/kg). Linear mixed PK-PD analyses indicated no large increase in mean QTcF interval (i.e. 
greater than 20 ms) at daratumumab Cmax.
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
DARZALEX in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of daratumumab following intravenous administration of daratumumab 
monotherapy were evaluated in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma at dose levels 
from 0.1 mg/kg to 24 mg/kg.
In the 1 to 24 mg/kg cohorts, peak serum concentrations (Cmax) after the first dose increased in 
approximate proportion to dose and volume of distribution was consistent with initial distribution into 
the plasma compartment. Following the last weekly infusion, Cmax increased in a greater than 
dose-proportional manner, consistent with target mediated drug disposition. Increases in AUC were 
more than dose-proportional and clearance (CL) decreased with increasing dose. These observations 
suggest CD38 may become saturated at higher doses, after which the impact of target binding 
clearance is minimised and the clearance of daratumumab approximates the linear clearance of 
endogenous IgG1. Clearance also decreased with multiple doses, which may be related to tumour 
burden decreases.
Terminal half-life increases with increasing dose and with repeated dosing. The mean (standard 
deviation [SD]) estimated terminal half-life of daratumumab following the first 16 mg/kg dose was 
9 (4.3) days. The estimated terminal half-life of daratumumab following the last 16 mg/kg dose 
increased, but there are insufficient data for a reliable estimation. Based on population PK analysis, the 
mean (SD) half-life associated with non-specific linear elimination was approximately 18 (9) days; 
this is the terminal half-life that can be expected upon complete saturation of target mediated clearance 
and repeat dosing of daratumumab.
At the end of weekly dosing for the recommended monotherapy schedule and dose of 16 mg/kg, the 
mean (SD) serum Cmax value was 915 (410.3) micrograms/mL, approximately 2.9-fold higher than 
following the first infusion. The mean (SD) predose (trough) serum concentration at the end of weekly 
dosing was 573 (331.5) micrograms/mL.
Four population PK analyses were performed to describe the PK characteristics of daratumumab and 
to evaluate the influence of covariates on the disposition of daratumumab in patients with multiple 
myeloma; analysis 1 (n=223) in patients receiving DARZALEX monotherapy while analysis 2 
(n=694), analysis 3 (n=352) and analysis 4 (n=355) were conducted in patients with multiple myeloma 
that received daratumumab combination therapies. Analysis 2 included 694 patients (n=326 for 
lenalidomide-dexamethasone; n=246 for bortezomib-dexamethasone; n=99 for pomalidomide-
dexamethasone; n=11 for bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone; and n=12 for bortezomib-thalidomide-
dexamethasone), analysis 3 included 352 patients (bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone) and analysis 4
included 355 patients (lenalidomide-dexamethasone).
Based on the population PK analysis of daratumumab monotherapy (analysis 1), daratumumab steady 
state is achieved approximately 5 months into the every 4-week dosing period (by the 21st infusion), 
and the mean (SD) ratio of Cmax at steady-state to Cmax after the first dose was 1.6 (0.5). The mean (SD) 
central volume of distribution is 56.98 (18.07) mL/kg.
Three additional population PK analyses (analysis 2, analysis 3 and analysis 4) were conducted in 
patients with multiple myeloma that received daratumumab combination therapies. Daratumumab 
concentration-time profiles were similar following the monotherapy and combination therapies. The 
27
mean estimated terminal half-life associated with linear clearance in combination therapy was 
approximately 15-23 days.
Based on the four population PK analyses (analyses 1-4) body weight was identified as a statistically 
significant covariate for daratumumab clearance. Therefore, body weight based dosing is an 
appropriate dosing strategy for the multiple myeloma patients.
Simulation of daratumumab pharmacokinetics was conducted for all recommended dosing schedules 
in 1309 patients with multiple myeloma. The simulation results confirmed that the split and single 
dosing for the first dose provide similar PK, with the exception of the PK profile in the first day of the 
treatment.
Special populations
Age and gender
Based on four individual population PK analyses (1-4) in patients receiving daratumumab 
monotherapy or various combination therapies (analyses 1-4), age (range: 31-93 years) had no 
clinically important effect on the PK of daratumumab, and the exposure of daratumumab was similar 
between younger (aged < 65 years, n=518) and older (aged ≥ 65 to < 75 years n=761; aged ≥ 75 years, 
n=334) patients.
Gender did not affect exposure of daratumumab to a clinically relevant degree in the population PK 
analyses.
Renal impairment
No formal studies of daratumumab in patients with renal impairment have been conducted. Four 
individual population PK analyses were performed based on pre-existing renal function data in 
patients receiving daratumumab monotherapy, or various combination therapies (Analyses 1-4), and 
included a total of 441 patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance [CRCL] 
≥ 90 mL/min), 621 with mild renal impairment (CRCL < 90 and ≥ 60 mL/min), 523 with moderate 
renal impairment (CRCL < 60 and ≥ 30 mL/min), and 27 with severe renal impairment or end stage 
renal disease (CRCL < 30 mL/min). No clinically important differences in exposure to daratumumab 
were observed between patients with renal impairment and those with normal renal function.
Hepatic impairment
No formal studies of daratumumab in patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted. Changes 
in hepatic function are unlikely to have any effect on the elimination of daratumumab since IgG1 
molecules such as daratumumab are not metabolised through hepatic pathways.
Four individual population PK analyses were performed in patients receiving daratumumab 
monotherapy or various combination therapies (Analyses 1-4), and included a total of 1404 patients 
with normal hepatic function (total bilirubin [TB] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] ≤ upper limit 
of normal [ULN]), 189 with mild hepatic impairment (TB 1.0 x to 1.5 x ULN or AST > ULN) and 
8 patients with moderate (TB > 1.5 x to 3.0 x ULN; n=7), or severe (TB > 3.0 x ULN; n=1) hepatic 
impairment. No clinically important differences in the exposure to daratumumab were observed 
between patients with hepatic impairment and those with normal hepatic function.
Race
Based on four individual population PK analyses in patients receiving either daratumumab 
monotherapy or various combination therapies (analyses 1-4), the exposure to daratumumab was 
similar between white (n=1371) and non-white subjects (n=242).
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Toxicology data have been derived from studies with daratumumab in chimpanzees and with a 
surrogate anti-CD38 antibody in cynomolgus monkeys. No chronic toxicity testing has been 
conducted.
28
Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity
No animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of daratumumab.
Reproductive toxicology
No animal studies have been performed to evaluate the potential effects of daratumumab on 
reproduction or development.
Fertility
No animal studies have been performed to determine potential effects on fertility in males or females.

Special precautions for disposal and other handling
This medicinal product is for single-use only.
Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique as follows:











Calculate the dose (mg), total volume (mL) of DARZALEX solution required and the number 
of DARZALEX vials needed based on patient weight.
Check that the DARZALEX solution is colourless to yellow. Do not use if opaque particles, 
discolouration or other foreign particles are present.
Using aseptic technique, remove a volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for 
injection from the infusion bag/container that is equal to the required volume of DARZALEX 
solution.
Withdraw the necessary amount of DARZALEX solution and dilute to the appropriate volume 
by adding to an infusion bag/container containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for 
injection (see section 4.2). Infusion bags/containers must be made of polyvinylchloride (PVC), 
polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) or polyolefin blend (PP+PE). Dilute under appropriate 
aseptic conditions. Discard any unused portion left in the vial.
Gently invert the bag/container to mix the solution. Do not shake.
Visually inspect parenteral medicinal products for particulate matter and discolouration prior to 
administration. The diluted solution may develop very small, translucent to white proteinaceous 
particles, as daratumumab is a protein. Do not use if visibly opaque particles, discolouration or 
foreign particles are observed.
Since DARZALEX does not contain a preservative, diluted solutions should be administered 
within 15 hours (including infusion time) at room temperature (15 °C-25 °C) and in room light.
If not used immediately, the diluted solution can be stored prior to administration for up to 
24 hours at refrigerated conditions (2 °C-8 °C) and protected from light. Do not freeze. If stored 
in the refrigerator, allow the solution to reach ambient temperature before administration.
Administer the diluted solution by intravenous infusion using an infusion set fitted with a flow 
regulator and with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding polyethersulfone 
(PES) filter (pore size 0.22 or 0.2 micrometre). Polyurethane (PU), polybutadiene (PBD), PVC, 
PP or PE administration sets must be used.
Do not infuse DARZALEX concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents.
Do not store any unused portion of the infusion solution for reuse. Any unused product or waste 
material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

Posology and method of administration
DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation is not intended for intravenous administration and should be 
given by subcutaneous injection only, using the doses specified.
DARZALEX should be administered by a healthcare professional, and the first dose should be 
administered in an environment where resuscitation facilities are available.
It is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the appropriate formulation (intravenous or 
subcutaneous formulation) and dose is being given to the patient as prescribed.
For patients currently receiving daratumamab intravenous formulation, DARZALEX solution for 
subcutaneous injection may be used as an alternative to the intravenous daratumumab formulation 
starting at the next scheduled dose.
Pre- and post-injection medicinal products should be administered to reduce the risk of 
infusion-related reactions (IRRs) with daratumumab. See below “Recommended concomitant 
medicinal products” and section 4.4.

Missed dose
If a planned dose of DARZALEX is missed, the dose should be administered as soon as possible and 
the dosing schedule should be adjusted accordingly, maintaining the treatment interval.
Dose modifications
No dose reductions of DARZALEX are recommended. Dose delay may be required to allow recovery 
of blood cell counts in the event of haematological toxicity (see section 4.4). For information 
concerning medicinal products given in combination with DARZALEX, see corresponding Summary 
of Product Characteristics.
In clinical studies, no modification to rate or dose of DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection 
was required to manage IRRs.
Recommended concomitant medicinal products
Pre-injection medicinal product
Pre-injection medicinal products (oral or intravenous) should be administered to reduce the risk of 
IRRs to all patients 1-3 hours prior to every administration of DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous 
injection as follows:

Corticosteroid (long-acting or intermediate-acting)
-
-
Monotherapy:
Methylprednisolone 100 mg, or equivalent. Following the second injection, the dose of 
corticosteroid may be reduced to methylprednisolone 60 mg.
Combination therapy:
Dexamethasone 20 mg (or equivalent), administered prior to every DARZALEX solution 
for subcutaneous injection. When dexamethasone is the background-regimen specific 
corticosteroid, the dexamethasone treatment dose will instead serve as pre-injection 
medicinal product on DARZALEX administration days (see section 5.1). Additional 
background regimen specific corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) should not be taken on 
DARZALEX administration days when patients have received dexamethasone (or 
equivalent) as a pre-injection medicinal product.


Antipyretics (paracetamol 650 to 1000 mg).
Antihistamine (oral or intravenous diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg or equivalent).
Post-injection medicinal product
Post-injection medicinal products should be administered to reduce the risk of delayed IRRs as 
follows:
-
Monotherapy:
Oral corticosteroid (20 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent dose of an 
intermediate-acting or long-acting corticosteroid in accordance with local standards) 
35
-
should be administered on each of the two days following all injections (beginning the 
day after the injection).
Combination therapy:
Consider administering low-dose oral methylprednisolone (≤ 20 mg) or equivalent the 
day after the DARZALEX injection. However, if a background regimen specific 
corticosteroid (e.g. dexamethasone, prednisone) is administered the day after the 
DARZALEX injection, additional post-injection medicinal products may not be needed 
(see section 5.1).
If the patient experiences no major IRRs after the first three injections, post-injection corticosteroids 
(excluding any background regimen corticosteroids) may be discontinued.
Additionally, for patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the use of 
post-injection medicinal products including short and long acting bronchodilators, and inhaled 
corticosteroids should be considered. Following the first four injections, if the patient experiences no 
major IRRs, these inhaled post-injection medicinal products may be discontinued at the discretion of 
the physician.
Prophylaxis for herpes zoster virus reactivation
Anti-viral prophylaxis should be considered for the prevention of herpes zoster virus reactivation.
Special populations
Renal impairment
No formal studies of daratumumab in patients with renal impairment have been conducted. Based on 
population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal 
impairment (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No formal studies of daratumumab in patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted.
No dose adjustments are necessary for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Elderly
No dose adjustments are considered necessary (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of DARZALEX in children aged below 18 years of age have not been 
established.
No data are available.
Body weight (> 120 kg)
Limited number of patients with body weight > 120 kg have been studied using flat-dose (1800 mg) 
DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection and efficacy in these patients has not been 
established. No dose adjustment based on body weight can currently be recommended (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Method of administration
DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation is not intended for intravenous administration and should be 
given by subcutaneous injection only, using the doses specified. See section 6.6 for special precautions 
prior to administration.
To avoid needle clogging, attach the hypodermic injection needle or subcutaneous infusion set to the 
syringe immediately prior to injection.
Inject 15 mL DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection into the subcutaneous tissue of 
the abdomen approximately 7.5 cm to the right or left of the navel over approximately 
36
3-5 minutes. Do not inject DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection at other sites of the body 
as no data are available.
Injection sites should be rotated for successive injections.
DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection should never be injected into areas where the skin is 
red, bruised, tender, hard or areas where there are scars.
Pause or slow down delivery rate if the patient experiences pain. In the event pain is not alleviated by 
slowing down the injection, a second injection site may be chosen on the opposite side of the abdomen 
to deliver the remainder of the dose.
During treatment with DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection, do not administer other 
medicinal products for subcutaneous use at the same site as DARZALEX.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Infusion-related reactions
DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection can cause severe and/or serious IRRs, including 
anaphylactic reactions. In clinical studies, approximately 9% (74/832) of patients experienced an IRR. 
Most IRRs occurred following the first injection and were grade 1-2. IRRs occurring with subsequent 
injections were seen in 1% of patients (see section 4.8).
The median time to onset of IRRs following DARZALEX injection was 3.2 hours (range 
0.15-83 hours). The majority of IRRs occurred on the day of treatment. Delayed IRRs have occurred 
in 1% of patients.
Signs and symptoms of IRRs may include respiratory symptoms, such as nasal congestion, cough, 
throat irritation, allergic rhinitis, wheezing as well as pyrexia, chest pain, pruritis, chills, vomiting, 
nausea, hypotension and blurred vision. Severe reactions have occurred, including bronchospasm, 
hypoxia, dyspnoea, hypertension, tachycardia and ocular adverse reactions (including choroidal 
effusion, acute myopia and acute angle closure glaucoma) (see section 4.8).
Patients should be pre-medicated with antihistamines, antipyretics, and corticosteroids as well as 
monitored and counselled regarding IRRs, especially during and following the first and second 
injections. If an anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (grade 4) reactions occur, appropriate 
emergency care should be initiated immediately. DARZALEX therapy should be discontinued 
immediately and permanently (see sections 4.2 and 4.3).
To reduce the risk of delayed IRRs, oral corticosteroids should be administered to all patients 
following DARZALEX injection (see section 4.2). Patients with a history of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease may require additional post-injection medicinal products to manage respiratory 
complications. The use of post-injection medicinal products (e.g. short- and long-acting 
bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids) should be considered for patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease. If ocular symptoms occur, interrupt DARZALEX and seek immediate 
ophthalmologic evaluation prior to restarting DARZALEX (see section 4.2).
37
Neutropenia/thrombocytopenia
DARZALEX may increase neutropenia and thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy (see 
section 4.8).
Complete blood cell counts should be monitored periodically during treatment according to 
manufacturer’s prescribing information for background therapies. Patients with neutropenia should be 
monitored for signs of infection. DARZALEX delay may be required to allow recovery of blood cell 
counts. In lower body weight patients receiving DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation, higher rates 
of neutropenia were observed; however, this was not associated with higher rates of serious infections. 
No dose reduction of DARZALEX is recommended. Consider supportive care with transfusions or 
growth factors.
Interference with indirect antiglobulin test (indirect Coombs test)
Daratumumab binds to CD38 found at low levels on red blood cells (RBCs) and may result in a 
positive indirect Coombs test. Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect Coombs test may persist for 
up to 6 months after the last daratumumab administration. It should be recognised that daratumumab 
bound to RBCs may mask detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient’s serum. The 
determination of a patient’s ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted.
Patients should be typed and screened prior to starting daratumumab treatment. Phenotyping may be 
considered prior to starting daratumumab treatment as per local practice. Red blood cell genotyping is 
not impacted by daratumumab and may be performed at any time.
In the event of a planned transfusion blood transfusion centres should be notified of this interference 
with indirect antiglobulin tests (see section 4.5). If an emergency transfusion is required, 
non-cross-matched ABO/RhD-compatible RBCs can be given per local blood bank practices.
Interference with determination of complete response
Daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both, the serum 
protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of 
endogenous M-protein (see section 4.5). This interference can impact the determination of complete 
response and of disease progression in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation
Hepatitis B virus reactivation, in some cases fatal, has been reported in patients treated with 
DARZALEX. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment with 
DARZALEX.
For patients with evidence of positive HBV serology, monitor for clinical and laboratory signs of HBV 
reactivation during, and for at least six months following the end of DARZALEX treatment. Manage 
patients according to current clinical guidelines. Consider consulting a hepatitis disease expert as 
clinically indicated.
In patients who develop reactivation of HBV while on DARZALEX, suspend treatment with 
DARZALEX and institute appropriate treatment. Resumption of DARZALEX treatment in patients 
whose HBV reactivation is adequately controlled should be discussed with physicians with expertise 
in managing HBV.
Body weight (> 120 kg)
There is a potential for reduced efficacy with DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection in 
patients with body weight > 120 kg (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
38
Excipients
This medicinal product contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) 
should not be given this medicinal product.
This medicinal product also contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
As an IgG1қ monoclonal antibody, renal excretion and hepatic enzyme-mediated metabolism of intact 
daratumumab are unlikely to represent major elimination routes. As such, variations in 
drug-metabolising enzymes are not expected to affect the elimination of daratumumab. Due to the 
high affinity to a unique epitope on CD38, daratumumab is not anticipated to alter drug-metabolising 
enzymes.
Clinical pharmacokinetic assessments with daratumumab intravenous or subcutaneous formulations 
and lenalidomide, pomalidomide, thalidomide, bortezomib, melphalan, prednisone, carfilzomib, 
cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone indicated no clinically-relevant drug-drug interaction between 
daratumumab and these small molecule medicinal products.
Interference with indirect antiglobulin test (indirect Coombs test)
Daratumumab binds to CD38 on RBCs and interferes with compatibility testing, including antibody 
screening and cross matching (see section 4.4). Daratumumab interference mitigation methods include 
treating reagent RBCs with dithiothreitol (DTT) to disrupt daratumumab binding or other locally 
validated methods. Since the Kell blood group system is also sensitive to DTT treatment, 
Kell-negative units should be supplied after ruling out or identifying alloantibodies using DTT-treated 
RBCs. Alternatively, phenotyping or genotyping may also be considered (see section 4.4).
Interference with serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation tests
Daratumumab may be detected on serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) 
assays used for monitoring disease monoclonal immunoglobulins (M protein). This can lead to false 
positive SPE and IFE assay results for patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein impacting initial 
assessment of complete responses by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. In 
patients with persistent very good partial response, where daratumumab interference is suspected, 
consider using a validated daratumumab-specific IFE assay to distinguish daratumumab from any 
remaining endogenous M protein in the patient’s serum, to facilitate determination of a complete 
response.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of child-bearing potential/contraception
Women of child-bearing potential should use effective contraception during, and for 3 months after 
cessation of daratumumab treatment.
Pregnancy
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of daratumumab in pregnant women. Animal 
studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). DARZALEX is not 
recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.
39
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether daratumumab is excreted in human milk.
A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from DARZALEX therapy taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.
Fertility
No data are available to determine potential effects of daratumumab on fertility in males or females 
(see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
DARZALEX has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, fatigue 
has been reported in patients taking daratumumab and this should be taken into account when driving 
or using machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most frequent adverse reactions of any grade (≥ 20% patients) with daratumumab (either 
intravenous or subcutaneous formulations) when administered either as monotherapy or combination 
treatment were IRRs, fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, pyrexia, cough, neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, anaemia, oedema peripheral, peripheral sensory neuropathy and upper respiratory 
tract infection. Serious adverse reactions were pneumonia, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, 
sepsis, pulmonary oedema, influenza, pyrexia, dehydration, diarrhoea, atrial fibrillation and syncope.
The safety profile of the DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation was similar to that of intravenous 
formulation with the exception of a lower rate of IRRs. In the phase III study MMY3012, neutropenia 
was the only adverse reaction reported at ≥ 5% higher frequency for DARZALEX subcutaneous 
formulation compared to intravenous daratumumab (grade 3 or 4: 13% vs 8%, respectively).
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Table 6 summarises the adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving DARZALEX 
subcutaneous formulation or intravenous formulation of daratumumab.
The data reflects exposure to DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation (1800 mg) in 639 patients with 
multiple myeloma (MM). The data includes 260 patients from a phase III active-controlled study
(MMY3012) who received DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection as monotherapy and
149 patients from a phase III active-controlled study (MMY3013) who received DARZALEX 
subcutaneous formulation in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Pd). The data 
also reflects three open-label, clinical studies in which patients received DARZALEX solution for 
subcutaneous injection either as monotherapy (N=31, MMY1004 and MMY1008) and MMY2040 in 
which patients received DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection in combination with either 
bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (D-VMP, n=67), lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Rd, 
n=65) or bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D-VRd, n=67). Additionally, data reflect 
exposure to 193 patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis from a phase III active-controlled 
study (AMY3001) in which patients received DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation in combination 
with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (D-VCd).
The safety data also reflects exposure to intravenous daratumumab (16 mg/kg) in 2324 patients with 
multiple myeloma including 1910 patients who received intravenous daratumumab in combination 
with background regimens and 414 patients who received intravenous daratumumab as monotherapy. 
Post-marketing adverse reactions are also included.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs)
In clinical studies (monotherapy and combination treatments; N=832) with DARZALEX subcutaneous 
formulation, the incidence of any grade IRRs was 8.2% with the first injection of DARZALEX 
(1800 mg, week 1), 0.4% with the week 2 injection, and 1.1% with subsequent injections. Grade 3 
IRRs were seen in 0.8% of patients. No patients had grade 4 IRRs.
Signs and symptoms of IRR may include respiratory symptoms, such as nasal congestion, cough, 
throat irritation, allergic rhinitis, wheezing as well as pyrexia, chest pain, pruritis, chills, vomiting, 
nausea, blurred vision and hypotension. Severe reactions have occurred, including bronchospasm, 
hypoxia, dyspnoea, hypertension, tachycardia and ocular adverse reactions (including choroidal 
effusion, acute myopia and acute angle closure glaucoma) (see section 4.4).
Injection site reactions (ISRs)
In clinical studies (N=832) with DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation, the incidence of any grade 
injection site reaction was 7.7%. There were no grade 3 or 4 ISRs. The most common (> 1%) ISR at 
the site of injection was erythema.
Infections
In patients with multiple myeloma receiving daratumumab as monotherapy, the overall incidence of 
infections was similar between DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation (52.9%) versus intravenous 
daratumumab groups (50.0%). Grade 3 or 4 infections also occurred at similar frequencies between 
DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation (11.7%) and intravenous daratumumab (14.3%). Most 
infections were manageable and rarely led to treatment discontinuation. Pneumonia was the most 
commonly reported grade 3 or 4 infection across studies. In active-controlled studies, discontinuations 
from treatment due to infections occurred in 1-4% of patients. Fatal infections were primarily due to 
pneumonia and sepsis.
In patients with multiple myeloma receiving intravenous daratumumab combination therapy, the 
following were reported:
Grade 3 or 4 infections:
Relapsed/refractory patient studies: DVd: 21%, Vd: 19%; DRd: 28%, Rd: 23%; DPd: 28%
Newly diagnosed patient studies: D-VMP: 23%, VMP: 15%; DRd: 32%, Rd: 23%; D-VTd: 22%, 
VTd: 20%.
42
Grade 5 (fatal) infections:
Relapsed/refractory patient studies: DVd: 1%, Vd: 2%; DRd: 2%, Rd: 1%; DPd: 2%
Newly diagnosed patient studies: D-VMP: 1%, VMP: 1%; DRd: 2%, Rd: 2%; DVTd: 0%, VTd: 0%.
In patients with multiple myeloma receiving DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation combination 
therapy, the following were reported:
Grade 3 or 4 infections: DPd: 28%, Pd: 23%
Grade 5 (fatal) infections: DPd: 5%, Pd: 3%
Key: D=daratumumab; Vd=bortezomib-dexamethasone; Rd=lenalidomide-dexamethasone; Pd=pomalidomide-
dexamethasone; VMP=bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone; VTd=bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone.
In patients with AL amyloidosis receiving DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation combination 
therapy, the following were reported:
Grade 3 or 4 infections: D-VCd: 17%, VCd:10%
Grade 5 infections: D-VCd: 1%, VCd: 1%
Key: D=daratumumab; VCd=bortezomib-cyclophosphamide-dexamethasone
Haemolysis
There is a theoretical risk of haemolysis. Continuous monitoring for this safety signal will be 
performed in clinical studies and post-marketing safety data.
Cardiac disorders and AL amyloidosis-related cardiomyopathy
The majority of patients in AMY3001 had AL amyloidosis-related cardiomyopathy at baseline 
(D-VCd 72% vs. VCd 71%). Grade 3 or 4 cardiac disorders occurred in 11% of D-VCd patients 
compared to 10% of VCd patients, while serious cardiac disorders occurred in 16% vs. 13% of D-VCd 
and VCd patients, respectively. Serious cardiac disorders occurring in ≥ 2% of patients included 
cardiac failure (D-VCd 6.2% vs. VCd 4.3%), cardiac arrest (D-VCd 3.6% vs. VCd 1.6%) and atrial 
fibrillation (D-VCd 2.1% vs. VCd 1.1%). All D-VCd patients who experienced serious or fatal cardiac 
disorders had AL amyloidosis-related cardiomyopathy at baseline. The longer median duration of 
treatment in the D-VCd arm compared to the VCd arm (9.6 months vs. 5.3 months, respectively) 
should be taken into consideration when comparing the frequency of cardiac disorders between the 
two treatment groups. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates (number of patients with the event per 
100 patient-months at risk) of overall grade 3 or 4 cardiac disorders (1.2 vs. 2.3), cardiac failure (0.5 
vs. 0.6), cardiac arrest (0.1 vs. 0.0) and atrial fibrillation (0.2 vs. 0.1) were comparable in the D-VCd 
arm vs. the VCd arm, respectively.
With a median follow-up of 11.4 months, overall deaths (D-VCd 14% vs. VCd 15%) in study 
AMY3001 were primarily due to AL amyloidosis-related cardiomyopathy in both treatment arms.
Other special populations
In the phase III study MMY3007, which compared treatment with D-VMP to treatment with VMP in 
patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell 
transplant, safety analysis of the subgroup of patients with an ECOG performance score of 2 
(D-VMP: n=89, VMP: n=84), was consistent with the overall population (see section 5.1).
Elderly patients
Of the 3549 patients who received daratumumab (n=832 subcutaneous; n=2717 intravenous) at the 
recommended dose, 38% were 65 to less than 75 years of age, and 16% were 75 years of age or older. 
No overall differences in effectiveness were observed based on age. The incidence of serious adverse 
reactions was higher in older than in younger patients. Among patients with relapsed and refractory 
multiple myeloma (n=1976), the most common serious adverse reactions that occurred more 
frequently in elderly (≥ 65 years of age) were pneumonia and sepsis. Among patients with newly 
diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (n=777), the most 
common serious adverse reaction that occurred more frequently in elderly (≥ 75 years of age) was 
pneumonia. Among patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis (n=193), the most common serious 
adverse reaction that occurred more frequently in elderly (≥ 65 years of age) was pneumonia.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Symptoms and signs
There has been no experience of overdose in clinical studies.
Treatment
There is no known specific antidote for daratumumab overdose. In the event of an overdose, the 
patient should be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate 
symptomatic treatment should be instituted immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug 
conjugates, CD38 (Clusters of Differentiation 38) inhibitors, ATC code: L01FC01.
DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection contains recombinant human hyaluronidase 
(rHuPH20). rHuPH20 works locally and transiently to degrade hyaluronan ((HA), a naturally 
occurring glycoaminoglycan found throughout the body) in the extracellular matrix of the 
subcutaneous space by cleaving the linkage between the two sugars (N-acetylglucosamine and 
glucuronic acid) which comprise HA. rHuPH20 has a half-life in skin of less than 30 minutes. 
Hyaluronan levels in subcutaneous tissue return to normal within 24 to 48 hours because of the rapid 
biosynthesis of hyaluronan.
Mechanism of action
Daratumumab is an IgG1κ human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the CD38 protein 
expressed on the surface of cells in a variety of haematological malignancies, including clonal plasma 
cells in multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis, as well as other cell types and tissues. CD38 protein 
has multiple functions such as receptor mediated adhesion, signalling and enzymatic activity.
Daratumumab has been shown to potently inhibit the in vivo growth of CD38-expressing tumour cells. 
Based on in vitro studies, daratumumab may utilise multiple effector functions, resulting in immune 
mediated tumour cell death. These studies suggest that daratumumab can induce tumour cell lysis 
through complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and 
antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis in malignancies expressing CD38. A subset of myeloid 
derived suppressor cells (CD38+MDSCs), regulatory T cells (CD38+Tregs) and B cells (CD38+Bregs) 
are decreased by daratumumab mediated cell lysis. T cells (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+) are also known 
to express CD38 depending on the stage of development and the level of activation. Significant 
increases in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell absolute counts, and percentages of lymphocytes, were observed 
with daratumumab treatment in peripheral whole blood and bone marrow. In addition, T-cell receptor 
DNA sequencing verified that T-cell clonality was increased with daratumumab treatment, indicating 
immune modulatory effects that may contribute to clinical response.
Daratumumab induced apoptosis in vitro after Fc mediated cross-linking. In addition, daratumumab 
modulated CD38 enzymatic activity, inhibiting the cyclase enzyme activity and stimulating the 
44
hydrolase activity. The significance of these in vitro effects in a clinical setting, and the implications 
on tumour growth, are not well-understood.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Natural killer (NK) cell and T-cell count
NK cells are known to express high levels of CD38 and are susceptible to daratumumab mediated cell 
lysis. Decreases in absolute counts and percentages of total NK cells (CD16+CD56+) and activated 
(CD16+CD56dim) NK cells in peripheral whole blood and bone marrow were observed with 
daratumumab treatment. However, baseline levels of NK cells did not show an association with 
clinical response.
Immunogenicity
In multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis patients treated with subcutaneous daratumumab in 
monotherapy and combination clinical studies, less than 1% of patients developed treatment-emergent 
anti-daratumumab antibodies.
In multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis patients, the incidence of treatment-emergent 
non-neutralizing anti-rHuPH20 antibodies was 7.3% (55/750) in patients who received either 
monotherapy DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation or combination DARZALEX subcutaneous 
formulation. The anti-rHuPH20 antibodies did not appear to impact daratumumab exposures. The 
clinical relevance of the development of anti-daratumumab or anti-rHuPH20 antibodies after treatment 
with DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation is not known.
Clinical experience of DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection (subcutaneous formulation)
Monotherapy – relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma
MMY3012, an open-label, randomised, phase III non-inferiority study, compared efficacy and safety 
of treatment with DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection (1800 mg) vs. intravenous 
(16 mg/kg) daratumumab in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received 
at least 3 prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent 
(IMiD) or who were double-refractory to a PI and an IMiD. Treatment continued until unacceptable 
toxicity or disease progression.
A total of 522 patients were randomised: 263 to the DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation arm and 
259 to the intravenous daratumumab arm. The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were 
similar between the two treatment groups. The median patient age was 67 years (range: 33-92 years), 
55% were male and 78% were Caucasian. The median patient weight was 73 kg (range: 29 – 138 kg) 
Patients had received a median of 4 prior lines of therapy. A total of 51% of patients had prior 
autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), 100% of patients were previously treated with both PI(s) and 
IMiD(s) and most patients were refractory to a prior systemic therapy, including both PI and IMiD 
(49%).
The study met its co-primary endpoints of overall response rate (ORR) by the IMWG response criteria 
(table 7) and maximum Ctrough at pre-dose cycle 3 day 1, (see section 5.2).

After a median follow-up of 29.3 months, the median OS was 28.2 months (95% CI: 22.8, NE) in the 
DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation arm and was 25.6 months (95% CI: 22.1, NE) in the 
intravenous daratumumab arm.
Safety and tolerability results, including in lower weight patients, were consistent with the known 
safety profile for DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation and intravenous daratumumab.
Results from the modified-CTSQ, a patient reported outcome questionnaire that assesses patient 
satisfaction with their therapy, demonstrated that patients receiving DARZALEX subcutaneous 
formulation had greater satisfaction with their therapy compared with patients receiving intravenous 
daratumumab. However, open-label studies are subject to bias.
Combination therapies in multiple myeloma
MMY2040 was an open-label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of DARZALEX subcutaneous 
formulation 1800 mg:
-
in combination with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (D-VMP) in patients with newly 
diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) who are ineligible for transplant. Bortezomib was 
administered by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly 
at weeks 1, 2, 4 and 5 for the first 6-week cycle (cycle 1; 8 doses), followed by once weekly 
administrations at weeks 1, 2, 4 and 5 for eight more 6-week cycles (cycles 2-9; 4 doses per 
cycle). Melphalan at 9 mg/m2, and prednisone at 60 mg/m2 were orally administered on days 1 
to 4 of the nine 6-week cycles (cycles 1-9). DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation was 
continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Rd) in patients with relapsed or 
refractory MM. Lenalidomide (25 mg once daily orally on days 1-21 of repeated 28-day 
[4-week] cycles) was given with low dose dexamethasone 40 mg/week (or a reduced dose of 
20 mg/week for patients > 75 years or BMI < 18.5). DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation 
was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (D-VRd) in patients with 
newly diagnosed MM who are transplant eligible. Bortezomib was administered by 
subcutaneous injection at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly at weeks 1 and 2. 
Lenalidomide was administered orally at 25 mg once daily on days 1-14; low dose 
dexamethasone was administered 40 mg/week in 3-week cycles. Total treatment duration was 
4 cycles.
-
-
A total of 199 patients (D-VMP: 67; D-Rd: 65; D-VRd: 67) were enrolled. Efficacy results were 
determined by computer algorithm using IMWG criteria. The study met its primary endpoint ORR for 
D-VMP and D-Rd and the primary endpoint VGPR or better for D-VRd (see table 8).

Combination treatment with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd)
Study MMY3013 was an open-label, randomised, active-controlled phase III study that compared 
treatment with DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation (1800 mg) in combination with pomalidomide 
and low-dose dexamethasone (D-Pd) to treatment with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone 
(Pd) in patients with multiple myeloma who had received at least one prior line of therapy with 
lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor (PI). Pomalidomide (4 mg once daily orally on days 1-21 of 
repeated 28-day [4-week] cycles) was given with low dose oral or intravenous dexamethasone 
40 mg/week (or a reduced dose of 20 mg/week for patients > 75 years). On DARZALEX 
subcutaneous formulation administration days, 20 mg of the dexamethasone dose was given as a pre-
administration medicinal product and the remainder given the day after the administration. For patients 
on a reduced dexamethasone dose, the entire 20 mg dose was given as a DARZALEX subcutaneous 
formulation pre-administration medicinal product. Dose adjustments for pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone were applied according to manufacturer’s prescribing information. Treatment was 
continued in both arms until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
A total of 304 patients were randomised: 151 to the D-Pd arm and 153 to the Pd arm. Patients with 
documented evidence of disease progression on or after the last regimen were included in the study. 
Patients who had ≥ grade 3 rash during prior therapy were excluded as per the pomalidomide 
Summary of Product Characteristics. The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were 
similar between the two treatment groups. The median patient age was 67 years (range 35 to 90 years), 
18% were ≥ 75 years, 53% were male, and 89% Caucasian. Patients had received a median of 2 prior 
lines of therapy. All patients received a prior treatment with a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and 
lenalidomide, and 56% of patients received prior stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Ninety-six percent 
(96%) of patients received prior treatment with bortezomib. The majority of patients were refractory to 
lenalidomide (80%), a PI (48%), or both an immunomodulator and a PI (42%). Eleven percent of 
patients received 1 prior line of therapy; all were refractory to lenalidomide and 32.4% were refractory 
to both lenalidomide and a PI. Efficacy was evaluated by progression free survival (PFS) based on 
International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria.
With a median follow-up of 16.9 months, the primary analysis of PFS in study MMY3013 showed a 
statistically significant improvement in the D-Pd arm as compared to the Pd arm; the median PFS was 
12.4 months in the D-Pd arm and 6.9 months in the Pd arm (HR [95% CI]: 0.63 [0.47, 0.85]; 
p-value = 0.0018), representing a 37% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death for patients 
treated with D-Pd versus Pd.
47
Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier curve of PFS in study MMY3013
An additional planned follow-up analysis of OS after a median follow-up of 39.6 months was 
performed. At OS maturity of 57%, the median OS was 34.4 months in the D-Pd arm and 23.7 months 
in the Pd arm (HR [95% CI]: 0.82 [0.61, 1.11]).

In responders, the median time to response was 1 month (range: 0.9 to 9.1 months) in the D-Pd group 
and 1.9 months (range: 0.9 to 17.3 months) in the Pd group. The median duration of response had not 
been reached in the D-Pd group (range: 1 to 34.9+ months) and was 15.9 months (range: 1+ to 
24.8 months) in the Pd group.
Combination treatment with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone in patients with AL
amyloidosis
Study AMY3001, an open-label, randomised, active-controlled phase III study, compared treatment 
with DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation (1800 mg) in combination with bortezomib, 
cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (D-VCd) to treatment with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and 
dexamethasone (VCd) alone in patients with newly diagnosed systemic AL amyloidosis. 
Randomisation was stratified by AL amyloidosis Cardiac Staging System, countries that typically 
offer autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) for patients with AL amyloidosis, and renal function.
All patients enrolled in study AMY3001 had newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis with at least one 
affected organ, measurable hematologic disease, cardiac stage I-IIIA (based on European Modification 
of Mayo 2004 cardiac stage), and NYHA class I-IIIA. Patients with NYHA class IIIB and IV were 
excluded.
Bortezomib (SC; 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area), cyclophosphamide (oral or IV; 300 mg/m2 body 
surface area; max dose 500 mg), and dexamethasone (oral or IV; 40 mg or a reduced dose of 20 mg 
for patients > 70 years or body mass index [BMI] < 18.5 or those who have hypervolemia, poorly 
controlled diabetes mellitus or prior intolerance to steroid therapy) were administered weekly on 
days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of repeated 28-day [4-week] cycles. On the days of DARZALEX dosing, 20 mg 
of the dexamethasone dose was given as a pre-injection medicinal product and the remainder given the 
day after DARZALEX administration. Bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone were given 
for six 28-day [4-week] cycles in both treatment arms, while DARZALEX treatment was continued 
until disease progression, start of subsequent therapy, or a maximum of 24 cycles (~2 years) from the 
first dose of study treatment. Dose adjustments for bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone 
were applied according to manufacturer’s prescribing information.
A total of 388 patients were randomised: 195 to the D-VCd arm and 193 to the VCd arm. The baseline 
demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. The majority 
(79%) of patients had lambda free light chain disease. The median patient age was 64 years (range: 34 
to 87); 47% were ≥ 65 years; 58% were male; 76% Caucasian, 17% Asian, and 3% African American; 
23% had AL amyloidosis Clinical Cardiac stage I, 40% had stage II, 35% had stage IIIA, and 2% had 
stage IIIB. All patients had one or more affected organs and the median number of organs involved 
was 2 (range: 1-6) and 66% of patients had 2 or more organs involved. Vital organ involvement was: 
71% cardiac, 59% renal and 8% hepatic. Patients with grade 2 sensory or grade 1 painful peripheral 
neuropathy were excluded. The primary efficacy endpoint was hematologic complete response 
(HemCR) rate as determined by the Independent Review Committee assessment based on 
International Concensus Criteria. Study AMY3001 demonstrated an improvement in HemCR in the 
D-VCd arm as compared to the VCd arm. Efficacy results are summarised in table 10.

Clinical experience with daratumumab concentrate for solution for infusion (intravenous formulation)
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
Combination treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients ineligible for autologous 
stem cell transplant
Study MMY3008, an open-label, randomised, active-controlled phase III study, compared treatment 
with intravenous daratumumab 16 mg/kg in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose 
dexamethasone (DRd) to treatment with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) in patients 
with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide (25 mg once daily orally on days 1-21 of 
repeated 28-day [4-week] cycles) was given with low dose oral or intravenous dexamethasone 
40 mg/week (or a reduced dose of 20 mg/week for patients >75 years or body mass index 
[BMI] < 18.5). On intravenous daratumumab infusion days, the dexamethasone dose was given as a 
pre-infusion medicinal product. Dose adjustments for lenalidomide and dexamethasone were applied 
according to manufacturer’s prescribing information. Treatment was continued in both arms until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
A total of 737 patients were randomised: 368 to the DRd arm and 369 to the Rd arm. The baseline 
demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. The median 
age was 73 (range: 45-90) years, with 44% of the patients ≥ 75 years of age. The majority were white 
(92%), male (52%), 34% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 
0, 49.5% had an ECOG performance score of 1 and 17% had an ECOG performance score of ≥ 2. 
Twenty-seven percent had International Staging System (ISS) stage I, 43% had ISS stage II and 29% 
had ISS stage III disease. Efficacy was evaluated by progression free survival (PFS) based on 
International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria and overall survival (OS).
With a median follow-up of 28 months, the primary analysis of PFS in study MMY3008 showed an 
improvement in the DRd arm as compared to the Rd arm; the median PFS had not been reached in the 
DRd arm and was 31.9 months in the Rd arm (hazard ratio [HR]=0.56; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.73; 
p < 0.0001), representing 44% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in patients treated 
with DRd. Results of an updated PFS analysis after a median follow-up of 64 months continued to 
show an improvement in PFS for patients in the DRd arm compared with the Rd arm. Median PFS 
was 61.9 months in the DRd arm and 34.4 months in the Rd arm (HR=0.55; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.67).

Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier curve of PFS in study MMY3008
With a median follow-up of 56 months, DRd has shown an OS advantage over the Rd arm (HR=0.68; 
95% CI: 0.53, 0.86; p=0.0013). Results of an updated OS analysis after a median of 64 months 
continued to show an improvement in OS for patients in the DRd arm compared to the Rd arm.
Median OS was not reached in the DRd arm and was 65.5 months in the Rd arm (HR= 0.66;

(D-VMP), to treatment with VMP in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Bortezomib 
was administered by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly at 
weeks 1, 2, 4 and 5 for the first 6-week cycle (cycle 1; 8 doses), followed by once weekly 
administrations at weeks 1, 2, 4 and 5 for eight more 6-week cycles (cycles 2-9; 4 doses per cycle). 
Melphalan at 9 mg/m2, and prednisone at 60 mg/m2 were orally administered on days 1 to 4 of the nine 
6-week cycles (cycles 1-9). Intravenous daratumumab treatment was continued until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity.
A total of 706 patients were randomised: 350 to the D-VMP arm and 356 to the VMP arm. The 
baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. The 
median age was 71 (range: 40-93) years, with 30% of the patients ≥ 75 years of age. The majority 
were white (85%), female (54%), 25% had an ECOG performance score of 0, 50% had an ECOG 
performance score of 1 and 25% had an ECOG performance score of 2. Patients had IgG/IgA/Light 
chain myeloma in 64%/22%/10% of instances, 19% had ISS stage I, 42% had ISS stage II, 38% had 
ISS stage III disease and 84% had standard risk cytogenetics. Efficacy was evaluated by PFS based on 
IMWG criteria and overall survival (OS).
With a median follow-up of 16.5 months, the primary analysis of PFS in study MMY3007 showed an 
improvement in the D-VMP arm as compared to the VMP arm; the median PFS had not been reached 
in the D-VMP arm and was 18.1 months in the VMP arm (HR=0.5; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.65; p < 0.0001). 
Results of an updated PFS analysis after a median follow-up of 40 months continued to show an 
improvement in PFS for patients in the D-VMP arm compared with the VMP arm. Median PFS was 
36.4 months in the D-VMP arm and 19.3 months in the VMP arm (HR=0.42; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.51; 
p < 0.0001), representing a 58% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in patients treated 
with D-VMP.

After a median follow-up of 40 months, D-VMP has shown an OS advantage over the VMP arm 
(HR=0.60; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.80; p=0.0003), representing a 40% reduction in the risk of death in patients 
treated in the D-VMP arm. Median OS was not reached for either arm.

In responders, the median time to response was 0.79 months (range: 0.4 to 15.5 months) in the 
D-VMP group and 0.82 months (range: 0.7 to 12.6 months) in the VMP group. The median duration 
55
of response had not been reached in the D-VMP group and was 21.3 months (range: 18.4, not 
estimable) in the VMP group.
A subgroup analysis was performed on patients at least 70 years old, or those 65-69 years old with 
ECOG performance score of 2, or aged less than 65 years of age with significant comorbidity or 
ECOG performance score of 2 (D-VMP: n=273, VMP: n=270). The efficacy results in this subgroup 
were consistent with the overall population. In this subgroup, median PFS was not reached in the 
D-VMP group and was 17.9 months in the VMP group (HR=0.56; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.75; p < 0.0001). 
The overall response rate was 90% in the D-VMP group and 74% in theVMP group (VGPR rate:29% 
in D-VMP group and 26% in VMP group; CR: 22% in D-VMP group and 18% in VMP group; sCR 
rate: 20% in D-VMP group and 7% in VMP group). The safety results of this subgroup were 
consistent with the overall population. Furthermore, safety analysis of the subgroup of patients with an 
ECOG performance score of 2 (D-VMP: n=89, VMP: n=84), was also consistent with the overall 
population.
Combination treatment with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (VTd) in patients eligible for 
autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)
Study MMY3006 is a 2 part, open-label, randomised, active-controlled phase III study. Part 1 
compared induction and consolidation treatment with intravenous daratumumab 16 mg/kg in 
combination with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (D-VTd) to treatment with bortezomib, 
thalidomide and dexamethasone (VTd) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma eligible 
for ASCT. The consolidation phase of treatment began a minimum of 30 days post-ASCT, when the 
patient had recovered sufficiently, and engraftment was complete. In part 2, subjects with at least a 
partial response (PR) by day 100 post-transplant were re-randomised in a 1:1 ratio to daratumumab 
maintenance or observation only. Only results from part 1 are described henceforth.
Bortezomib was administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous injection at a dose of 
1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks (days 1, 4, 8, and 11) of repeated 28 day 
(4-week) induction treatment cycles (cycles 1-4) and two consolidation cycles (cycles 5 and 6) 
following ASCT after cycle 4. Thalidomide was administered orally at 100 mg daily during the six 
bortezomib cycles. Dexamethasone (oral or intravenous) was administered at 40 mg on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 
15, 16, 22 and 23 of cycles 1 and 2, and at 40 mg on days 1-2 and 20 mg on subsequent dosing days 
(days 8, 9, 15, 16) of cycles 3-4. Dexamethasone 20 mg was administered on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16 in 
cycles 5 and 6. On the days of intravenous daratumumab infusion, the dexamethasone dose was 
administered intravenously as a pre-infusion medicinal product. Dose adjustments for bortezomib, 
thalidomide and dexamethasone were applied according to manufacturer’s prescribing information.
A total of 1085 patients were randomised: 543 to the D-VTd arm and 542 to the VTd arm. The 
baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. The 
median age was 58 (range: 22 to 65) years. All patients were ≤ 65 years: 43% were in the age group 
≥ 60-65 years, 41% were in the age group ≥ 50-60 years and 16% below age of 50 years. The majority 
were male (59%), 48% had an ECOG performance score of 0, 42% had an ECOG performance score 
of 1 and 10% had an ECOG performance score of 2. Forty percent had International Staging System 
(ISS) stage I, 45% had ISS stage II and 15% had ISS stage III disease.
Efficacy was evaluated by the stringent complete response (sCR) rate at day 100 post-transplant and 
PFS.

randomisation showed HR=0.50; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.75; p=0.0005. Results of an updated PFS analysis 
with a median follow-up of 44.5 months, censoring patients who were randomised to daratumumab 
maintenance in the second randomisation, showed HR=0.43; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.55; p < 0.0001. Median 
PFS was not reached in the D-VTd arm and was 37.8 months in the VTd arm.

Relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma
Monotherapy:
The clinical efficacy and safety of intravenous daratumumab monotherapy for the treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma whose prior therapy included a proteasome 
inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent and who had demonstrated disease progression on the last 
therapy, was demonstrated in two open-label studies.
In study MMY2002, 106 patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma received 16 mg/kg 
intravenous daratumumab until disease progression. The median patient age was 63.5 years (range, 31 
to 84 years), 11% of patients were ≥ 75 years of age, 49% were male and 79% were Caucasian. 
Patients had received a median of 5 prior lines of therapy. Eighty percent of patients had received prior 
autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Prior therapies included bortezomib (99%), lenalidomide 
(99%), pomalidomide (63%) and carfilzomib (50%). At baseline, 97% of patients were refractory to 
the last line of treatment, 95% were refractory to both, a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and 
immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), 77% were refractory to alkylating agents, 63% were refractory to 
pomalidomide and 48% of patients were refractory to carfilzomib.
Efficacy results of the pre-planned interim analysis based on Independent Review Committee (IRC) 
assessment are presented in table 14 below.

Overall response rate (ORR) in MMY2002 was similar regardless of type of prior anti-myeloma 
therapy.
At a survival update with a median duration of follow-up of 14.7 months, median OS was 17.5 months 
(95% CI: 13.7, not estimable).
In study GEN501, 42 patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma received 16 mg/kg 
intravenous daratumumab until disease progression. The median patient age was 64 years (range, 44 to 
76 years), 64% were male and 76% were Caucasian. Patients in the study had received a median of 4 
prior lines of therapy. Seventy-four percent of patients had received prior ASCT. Prior therapies 
included bortezomib (100%), lenalidomide (95%), pomalidomide (36%) and carfilzomib (19%). At 
baseline, 76% of patients were refractory to the last line of treatment, 64% were refractory to both a PI 
and IMiD, 60% were refractory to alkylating agents, 36% were refractory to pomalidomide and 17% 
were refractory to carfilzomib.
Pre-planned interim analysis showed that treatment with daratumumab at 16 mg/kg led to a 36% ORR 
with 5% CR and 5% VGPR. The median time to response was 1 (range: 0.5 to 3.2) month. The 
median duration of response was not reached (95% CI: 5.6 months, not estimable).
At a survival update with a median duration of follow-up of 15.2 months, median OS was not reached 
(95% CI: 19.9 months, not estimable), with 74% of subjects still alive.
Combination treatment with lenalidomide
Study MMY3003, an open-label, randomised, active-controlled phase III study, compared treatment 
with intravenous daratumumab 16 mg/kg in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose 
dexamethasone (DRd) to treatment with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) in patients 
with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received at least one prior therapy. 
Lenalidomide (25 mg once daily orally on days 1-21 of repeated 28-day [4-week] cycles) was given 
with low dose dexamethasone at 40 mg/week (or a reduced dose of 20 mg/week for patients > 75 years 
or BMI < 18.5). On intravenous daratumumab infusion days, 20 mg of the dexamethasone dose was 
given as a pre-infusion medicinal product and the remainder given the day after the infusion. 
Treatment was continued in both arms until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
A total of 569 patients were randomised; 286 to the DRd arm and 283 to the Rd arm. The baseline 
demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the intravenous daratumumab and the 
control arm. The median patient age was 65 years (range 34 to 89 years) and 11% were ≥ 75 years. 
The majority of patients (86%) received a prior PI, 55% of patients had received a prior IMiD, 
including 18% of patients who had received prior lenalidomide; and 44% of patients had received both 
a prior PI and IMiD. At baseline, 27% of patients were refractory to the last line of treatment. Eighteen 
percent (18%) of patients were refractory to a PI only, and 21% were refractory to bortezomib. 
Patients refractory to lenalidomide were excluded from the study.
59
With a median follow-up of 13.5 months, the primary analysis of PFS in study MMY3003 
demonstrated an improvement in the DRd arm as compared to the Rd arm; the median PFS had not 
been reached in the DRd arm and was 18.4 months in the Rd arm (HR=0.37; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.52; 
p < 0.0001). Results of an updated PFS analysis after a median follow-up of 55 months continued to 
show an improvement in PFS for patients in the DRd arm compared with the Rd arm. Median PFS 
was 45.0 months in the DRd arm and 17.5 months in the Rd arm (HR=0.44; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.54; 
p < 0.0001), representing a 56% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in patients treated 
with DRd (see figure 7).
Figure 7: Kaplan-Meier curve of PFS in study MMY3003
After a median follow-up of 80 months, DRd has shown an OS advantage over the Rd arm (HR=0.73;
95% CI: 0.58, 0.91; p=0.0044). The median OS was 67.6 months in the DRd arm and 51.8 months in 
the Rd arm.

Combination treatment with bortezomib
Study MMY3004, an open-label, randomised, active-controlled phase III study, compared treatment 
with intravenous daratumumab 16 mg/kg in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd), 
to treatment with bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma who had received at least one prior therapy. Bortezomib was administered by subcutaneous 
injection or intravenous injection at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two 
weeks (days 1, 4, 8, and 11) of repeated 21 day (3-week) treatment cycles, for a total of 8 cycles. 
Dexamethasone was administered orally at a dose of 20 mg on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of each 
61
of the 8 bortezomib cycles (80 mg/week for two out of three weeks of the bortezomib cycle) or a 
reduced dose of 20 mg/week for patients > 75 years, BMI < 18.5, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus 
or prior intolerance to steroid therapy. On the days of intravenous daratumumab infusion, 20 mg of the 
dexamethasone dose was administered as a pre-infusion medicinal product. intravenous daratumumab
treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
A total of 498 patients were randomised; 251 to the DVd arm and 247 to the Vd arm. The baseline 
demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the intravenous daratumumab and the 
control arm. The median patient age was 64 years (range 30 to 88 years) and 12% were ≥ 75 years. 
Sixty-nine percent (69%) of patients had received a prior PI (66% received bortezomib) and 76% of 
patients received an IMiD (42% received lenalidomide). At baseline, 32% of patients were refractory 
to the last line of treatment. Thirty-three percent (33%) of patients were refractory to an IMiD only, 
and 28% were refractory to lenalidomide. Patients refractory to bortezomib were excluded from the 
study.
With a median follow-up of 7.4 months, the primary analysis of PFS in study MMY3004 
demonstrated an improvement in the DVd arm as compared to the Vd arm; the median PFS had not 
been reached in the DVd arm and was 7.2 months in the Vd arm (HR [95% CI]: 0.39 [0.28, 0.53]; 
p-value < 0.0001). Results of an updated PFS analysis after a median follow-up of 50 months 
continued to show an improvement in PFS for patients in the DVd arm compared with the Vd arm. 
Median PFS was 16.7 months in the DVd arm and 7.1 months in the Vd arm (HR [95% CI]: 0.31 
[0.24, 0.39]; p-value < 0.0001), representing a 69% reduction in the risk of disease progression or 
death in patients treated with DVd versus Vd (see figure 9).

After a median follow-up of 73 months, DVd has shown an OS advantage over the Vd arm (HR=0.74;
95% CI: 0.59, 0.92; p=0.0075). The median OS was 49.6 months in the DVd arm and 38.5 months in 
the Vd arm.

Cardiac electrophysiology
Daratumumab as a large protein has a low likelihood of direct ion channel interactions. The effect of 
daratumumab on the QTc interval was evaluated in an open-label study for 83 patients (Study 
GEN501) with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma following daratumumab infusions (4 to 
63
24 mg/kg). Linear mixed PK-PD analyses indicated no large increase in mean QTcF interval (i.e. 
greater than 20 ms) at daratumumab Cmax.
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
DARZALEX in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
In patients with multiple myeloma, daratumumab exposure in a monotherapy study following the 
recommended 1800 mg administration of DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation (weekly for 
8 weeks, biweekly for 16 weeks, monthly thereafter) as compared to 16 mg/kg intravenous 
daratumumab for the same dosing schedule, showed non-inferiority for the co-primary endpoint of 
maximum Ctrough (cycle 3 day 1 pre-dose), with mean ± SD of 593 ± 306 µg/mL compared to 
522 ± 226 µg/mL for intravenous daratumumab, with a geometric mean ratio of 107.93% (90% 
CI: 95.74-121.67).
In a combination study, AMY3001, in patients with AL amyloidosis, the maximum Ctrough (cycle 3 
day 1 pre-dose) was similar to that in multiple myeloma with mean ± SD of 597 ± 232 µg/mL 
following the recommended 1800 mg administration of DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation 
(weekly for 8 weeks, biweekly for 16 weeks, monthly thereafter).
Following the recommended dose of 1800 mg DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection, peak 
concentrations (Cmax) increased 4.8-fold and total exposure (AUC0-7 days) increased 5.4-fold from first 
dose to last weekly dose (8th dose). Highest trough concentrations for DARZALEX solution for 
subcutaneous injection are typically observed at the end of the weekly dosing regimens for both 
monotherapy and combination therapy.
In patients with multiple myeloma, the simulated trough concentrations following 6 weekly doses of 
1800 mg DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection for combination therapy were similar to 
1800 mg DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection monotherapy.
In patients with multiple myeloma, daratumumab exposure in a combination study with pomalidomide 
and dexamethasone (study MMY3013) was similar to that in monotherapy, with the maximum Ctrough
(cycle 3 day 1 pre-dose) mean ± SD of 537 ± 277 µg/mL following the recommended 1800 mg
administration of DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection (weekly for 8 weeks, biweekly for 
16 weeks, monthly thereafter).
Absorption and distribution
At the recommended dose of 1800 mg in multiple myeloma patients, the absolute bioavailability of 
DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection is 69%, with an absorption rate of 0.012 hour-1, with 
peak concentrations occurring at 70 to 72 h (Tmax). At the recommended dose of 1800 mg in AL 
amyloidosis patients, the absolute bioavailability was not estimated, the absorption rate constant was 
0.77 day-1 (8.31% CV) and peak concentrations occurred at 3 days.
The model predicted mean estimate of the volume of distribution for the central compartment was 
5.25 L (36.9% CV) and peripheral compartment (V2) was 3.78 L in daratumumab monotherapy, and 
the modeled mean estimate of the volume of distribution for V1 was 4.36 L (28.0% CV) and V2 was 
2.80 L when daratumumab was administered in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone 
in multiple myeloma patients. In AL amyloidosis patients, the model estimated apparent volume of 
distribution after subcutaneous administration is 10.8 L (3.1% CV). These results suggest that 
daratumumab is primarily localised to the vascular system with limited extravascular tissue 
distribution.
64
Metabolism and elimination
Daratumumab exhibits both concentration and time-dependent pharmacokinetics with parallel linear 
and nonlinear (saturable) elimination that is characteristic of target-mediated clearance. The 
population PK model estimated mean clearance value of daratumumab is 4.96 mL/h (58.7% CV) in 
daratumumab monotherapy and 4.32 mL/h (43.5% CV) when daratumumab is administered in 
combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients. In AL amyloidosis 
patients, the apparent clearance after subcutaneous administration is 210 mL/day (4.1% CV). The 
model-based geometric mean for half-life associated with linear elimination is 20.4 days (22.4% CV)
in daratumumab monotherapy and 19.7 days (15.3% CV) when daratumumab was administered in 
combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients and 27.5 days 
(74.0% CV) in AL amyloidosis patients. For the monotherapy and combination regimens, the steady 
state is achieved at approximately 5 months into every 4 weeks dosage at the recommended dose and 
schedule (1800 mg; once weekly for 8 weeks, every 2 weeks for 16 weeks, and then every 4 weeks 
thereafter).
A population PK analysis was conducted using data from DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous 
injection monotherapy and combination therapy multiple myeloma studies, and the predicted PK 
exposures are summarised in table 17.

Special populations
Age and gender
Based on population PK analyses in patients (33-92 years) receiving monotherapy or various 
combination therapies, age had no statistically significant effect on the PK of daratumumab. No 
individualisation is necessary for patients on the basis of age.
Gender had a statistically significant effect on PK parameters in patients with multiple myeloma but 
not in patients with AL amyloidosis. Slightly higher exposure in females were observed than males, 
but the difference in exposure is not considered clinically meaningful. No individualisation is 
necessary for patients on the basis of gender.
Renal impairment
No formal studies of DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation in patients with renal impairment have 
been conducted. Population PK analyses were performed based on pre-existing renal function data in 
patients with multiple myeloma receiving DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation monotherapy or 
various combination therapies in patients with multiple myeloma or AL amyloidosis. No clinically 
important differences in exposure to daratumumab were observed between patients with renal 
impairment and those with normal renal function.
Hepatic impairment
No formal studies of DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation in patients with hepatic impairment have 
been conducted.
Population PK analyses were performed in patients with multiple myeloma receiving DARZALEX 
subcutaneous formulation monotherapy or various combination therapies in patients with multiple 
myeloma and in AL amyloidosis. No clinically important differences in the exposure to daratumumab 
were observed between patients with normal hepatic function and mild hepatic impairment. There 
were very few patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment to make meaningful conclusions 
for these populations.
Race
Based on the population PK analyses in patients receiving either DARZALEX subcutaneous 
formulation monotherapy or various combination therapies, the daratumumab exposure was similar 
across races.
Body weight
The flat-dose administration of DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation 1800 mg as monotherapy 
achieved adequate exposure for all body-weight subgroups. In patients with multiple myeloma, the 
mean cycle 3 day 1 Ctrough in the lower body-weight subgroup (≤ 65 kg) was 60% higher and in the 
higher body weight (> 85 kg) subgroup, 12% lower than the intravenous daratumumab subgroup. In 
some patients with body weight > 120 kg, lower exposure was observed which may result in reduced 
efficacy. However, this observation is based on limited number of patients.
In patients with AL amyloidosis, no meaningful differences were observed in Ctrough across body 
weight.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Toxicology data have been derived from studies with daratumumab in chimpanzees and with a 
surrogate anti-CD38 antibody in cynomolgus monkeys. No chronic toxicity testing has been 
conducted.
No animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of daratumumab.
No animal studies have been performed to evaluate the potential effects of daratumumab on 
reproduction or development or to determine potential effects on fertility in males or females.
66
No carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or fertility studies were conducted for recombinant human 
hyaluronidase. There were no effects on reproductive tissues and function and no systemic exposure of 
hyaluronidase in monkeys given 22000 U/kg/week subcutaneously (12 times higher than the human 
dose) for 39 weeks. As hyaluronidase is a recombinant form of the endogenous human hyaluronidase, 
no carcinogenity, mutagenesis, or effects on fertility are expected.

The requirements for submission of PSURs for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union 
reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.
D.
CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND 
EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Risk management plan (RMP)
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities 
and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation 
and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP.
70
An updated RMP should be submitted:


At the request of the European Medicines Agency;
Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

Additional risk minimisation measures
Prior to the launch of DARZALEX (daratumumab) in each Member State (MS) the Marketing 
Authorisation Holder (MAH) must agree about the content and format of the educational materials, 
aiming at increasing awareness about the Important Identified Risk of “Interference for blood typing 
(minor antigen) (Positive Indirect Coombs’ test)” and providing guidance on how to manage it.
The MAH shall ensure that in each MS where DARZALEX (daratumumab) is marketed, all HCPs and 
patients who are expected to prescribe, dispense and receive this product have access to/are provided 
with the below.
The HCPs and Blood Banks educational materials, shall contain the following key elements:
o
o
The guide for HCPs and Blood Banks, to advice about the risk of interference for blood typing 
and how to minimise it;
The Patient Alert Card.
The Guide for HCP and Blood Banks shall contain the following key elements:
o
o
o
o
o
o
o
o
o
All patients should be typed and screened prior to start treatment with daratumumab; 
alternatively, phenotyping may also be considered;
Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect Coombs test (interfering with cross-matching of 
blood) may persist for up to 6 months after the last product’s infusion, therefore, the HCP 
should advise the patient to carry the Patient Alert Card until 6 months after the treatment has 
ended;
Daratumumab bound to Red Blood Cells (RBCs) may mask the detection of antibodies to minor 
antigens in the patient’s serum;
The determination of a patient’s ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted;
The interference mitigation methods include treating reagent RBCs with dithiothreitol (DTT) to
disrupt daratumumab binding or other locally validated methods. Since the Kell Blood group 
system is also sensitive to DTT treatment, Kell-negative units should be supplied after ruling 
out or identifying alloantibodies using DTT-treated RBCs. Alternatively, genotyping may also 
be considered;
In case of urgent need for transfusion, non-cross matched ABO/RhD compatible RBC units can 
be administered as per local bank practices;
In the event of a planned transfusion, the HCPs should notify blood transfusion centres about 
the interference with indirect antiglobulin tests;
Reference to the need to consult the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC);
Reference to the need of giving the Patient Alert Card to the patients and to advise them to 
consult the Package Leaflet (PL).
The Patient Alert Card, shall contain the following key elements:
o
o
o
A warning message for HCPs treating the patient at any time, including in conditions of 
emergency, that the patient is using DARZALEX (daratumumab), and that this treatment is 
associated with the Important Identified Risk of Interference for blood typing (minor antigen) 
(Positive Indirect Coombs’ test), which might persist for up to 6 months after the last product’s 
infusion, and a clear reference that the patient should continue to carry this card until 6 months 
after the treatment has ended;
Contact details of the DARZALEX (daratumumab) prescriber;
Reference to the need to consult the Package Leaflet (PL).
71

Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures:
Description
Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to further evaluate the 
efficacy of subcutaneous daratumumab in combination with 
cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult 
patients with newly diagnosed systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis, the 
MAH should submit the final OS results of the AMY3001 study.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What DARZALEX is and what it is used for
What DARZALEX is
DARZALEX is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance daratumumab. It belongs to a 
group of medicines called “monoclonal antibodies”. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that have 
been designed to recognise and attach to specific targets in the body. Daratumumab has been designed 
to attach to specific cancer cells in your body, so that your immune system can destroy the cancer 
cells.
What DARZALEX is used for
DARZALEX is used in adults 18 years or older, who have a type of cancer called “multiple 
myeloma”. This is a cancer of your bone marrow.
2. What you need to know before you are given DARZALEX
You must not be given DARZALEX

if you are allergic to daratumumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).
Do not use DARZALEX if the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse 
before you are given DARZALEX.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given DARZALEX.
Infusion-related reactions
DARZALEX is given as an infusion (drip) into a vein. Before and after each infusion of DARZALEX, 
you will be given medicines which help to lower the chance of infusion-related reactions (see 
“Medicines given during treatment with DARZALEX” in section 3). These reactions can happen 
during the infusion or in the 3 days after the infusion.
In some cases you may have a severe allergic reaction which may include a swollen face, lips, mouth, 
tongue or throat, difficulty swallowing or breathing or an itchy rash (hives). Some serious allergic 
reactions and other severe infusion-related reactions have resulted in death.
86
Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get any of the infusion-related reactions or related 
symptoms listed at the top of section 4.
If you get infusion-related reactions, you may need other medicines, or the infusion may need to be 
slowed down or stopped. When these reactions go away, or get better, the infusion can be started 
again.
These reactions are most likely to happen with the first infusion. If you have had an infusion-related 
reaction once it is less likely to happen again. Your doctor may decide not to use DARZALEX if you 
have a strong infusion reaction.
Decreased blood cell counts
DARZALEX can decrease white blood cell counts which help fight infections, and blood cells called 
platelets which help to clot blood. Tell your healthcare provider if you develop any symptoms of 
infection such as fever or any symptoms of decreased platelet counts such as bruising or bleeding.
Blood transfusions
If you need a blood transfusion, you will have a blood test first to match your blood type. 
DARZALEX can affect the results of this blood test. Tell the person doing the test that you are using 
DARZALEX.
Hepatitis B
Tell your doctor if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because 
DARZALEX could cause hepatitis B virus to become active again. Your doctor will check you for 
signs of this infection before, during and for some time after treatment with DARZALEX. Tell your 
doctor right away if you get worsening tiredness, or yellowing of your skin or white part of your eyes.
Children and adolescents
Do not give DARZALEX to children or adolescents below 18 years of age. This is because it is not 
known how the medicine will affect them.
Other medicines and DARZALEX
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
This includes medicines you can get without a prescription, and herbal medicines.
Pregnancy
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before you are given this medicine.
If you become pregnant while being treated with this medicine, tell your doctor or nurse straight away. 
You and your doctor will decide if the benefit of having the medicine is greater than the risk to your 
baby.
Contraception
Women who are being given DARZALEX should use effective contraception during treatment and for 
3 months after treatment.
Breast-feeding
You and your doctor will decide if the benefit of breast-feeding is greater than the risk to your baby. 
This is because the medicine may pass into the mother’s milk and it is not known how it will affect the 
baby.
Driving and using machines
You may feel tired after taking DARZALEX which may affect your ability to drive or use machines.
DARZALEX contains sorbitol
Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If you have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic 
disorder, you must not receive this medicine. Patients with HFI cannot break down fructose, which 
may cause serious side effects.
87
You must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you have HFI.
3.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
This medicinal product is for single-use only.
Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique as follows:











Calculate the dose (mg), total volume (mL) of DARZALEX solution required and the number 
of DARZALEX vials needed based on patient weight.
Check that the DARZALEX solution is colourless to yellow. Do not use if opaque particles, 
discolouration or other foreign particles are present.
Using aseptic technique, remove a volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for 
injection from the infusion bag/container that is equal to the required volume of DARZALEX 
solution.
Withdraw the necessary amount of DARZALEX solution and dilute to the appropriate volume 
by adding to an infusion bag/container containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for 
injection. Infusion bags/containers must be made of polyvinylchloride (PVC), polypropylene 
(PP), polyethylene (PE) or polyolefin blend (PP+PE). Dilute under appropriate aseptic 
conditions. Discard any unused portion left in the vial.
Gently invert the bag/container to mix the solution. Do not shake.
Visually inspect parenteral medicinal products for particulate matter and discolouration prior to 
administration. The diluted solution may develop very small, translucent to white proteinaceous 
particles, as daratumumab is a protein. Do not use if visibly opaque particles, discolouration or 
foreign particles are observed.
Since DARZALEX does not contain a preservative, diluted solutions should be administered 
within 15 hours (including infusion time) at room temperature (15 °C-25 °C) and in room light.
If not used immediately, the diluted solution can be stored prior to administration for up to 
24 hours at refrigerated conditions (2 °C-8 °C) and protected from light. Do not freeze.
Administer the diluted solution by intravenous infusion using an infusion set fitted with a flow 
regulator and with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding polyethersulfone 
(PES) filter (pore size 0.22 or 0.2 micrometre). Polyurethane (PU), polybutadiene (PBD), PVC, 
PP or PE administration sets must be used.
Do not infuse DARZALEX concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents.
Do not store any unused portion of the infusion solution for reuse. Any unused product or waste 
material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What DARZALEX is and what it is used for
What DARZALEX is
DARZALEX is a medicine that contains the active substance daratumumab. It belongs to a group of 
medicines called “monoclonal antibodies”. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that have been 
designed to recognise and attach to specific targets in the body. Daratumumab has been designed to 
attach to specific abnormal blood cells in your body, so that your immune system can destroy these
cells.
What DARZALEX is used for
DARZALEX is used in adults 18 years or older, who have a type of cancer called “multiple 
myeloma”. This is a cancer of your bone marrow.
DARZALEX is also used in adults 18 years or older, who have a type of blood disorder called “AL 
amyloidosis.” In AL amyloidosis, abnormal blood cells make excessive amounts of abnormal proteins 
that deposit in various organs, causing these organs to not function properly.
2. What you need to know before you are given DARZALEX
You must not be given DARZALEX
-
if you are allergic to daratumumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).
Do not use DARZALEX if the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse 
before you are given DARZALEX.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given DARZALEX.
Infusion-related reactions
DARZALEX is given as a subcutaneous injection using a small needle to inject the medicine under 
your skin. Before and after each injection, you will be given medicines which help to lower the chance 
of infusion-related reactions (see “Medicines given during treatment with DARZALEX” in section 3).
These reactions are most likely to happen with the first injection and most reactions occur on the day 
of injection. If you have had an infusion-related reaction once it is less likely to happen again. 
94
However, delayed reactions can happen up to 3-4 days after the injection. Your doctor may decide not 
to use DARZALEX if you have a strong reaction after the injection.
In some cases you may have a severe allergic reaction which may include a swollen face, lips, mouth, 
tongue or throat, difficulty swallowing or breathing or an itchy rash (hives). See section 4.
Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get any of the infusion-related reactions or related 
symptoms listed at the top of section 4. If you get infusion-related reactions, you may need other 
medicines to treat your symptoms, or the injections may need to be stopped. When these reactions go 
away, or get better, the injection can be started again.
Decreased blood cell counts
DARZALEX can decrease white blood cell counts which help fight infections, and blood cells called 
platelets which help to clot blood. Tell your healthcare provider if you develop any symptoms of 
infection such as fever or any symptoms of decreased platelet counts such as bruising or bleeding.
Blood transfusions
If you need a blood transfusion, you will have a blood test first to match your blood type. 
DARZALEX can affect the results of this blood test. Tell the person doing the test that you are using 
DARZALEX.
Hepatitis B
Tell your doctor if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because 
DARZALEX could cause hepatitis B virus to become active again. Your doctor will check you for 
signs of this infection before, during and for some time after treatment with DARZALEX. Tell your 
doctor right away if you get worsening tiredness, or yellowing of your skin or white part of your eyes.
Children and adolescents
Do not give DARZALEX to children or adolescents below 18 years of age. This is because it is not 
known how the medicine will affect them.
Other medicines and DARZALEX
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
This includes medicines you can get without a prescription, and herbal medicines.
Pregnancy
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before you are given this medicine.
If you become pregnant while being treated with this medicine, tell your doctor or nurse straight away. 
You and your doctor will decide if the benefit of having the medicine is greater than the risk to your 
baby.
Contraception
Women who are being given DARZALEX should use effective contraception during treatment and for 
3 months after treatment.
Breast-feeding
You and your doctor will decide if the benefit of breast-feeding is greater than the risk to your baby. 
This is because the medicine may pass into the mother’s milk and it is not known how it will affect the 
baby.
Driving and using machines
You may feel tired after taking DARZALEX which may affect your ability to drive or use machines.
DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 15 mL, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
95
DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection contains sorbitol
Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If your doctor has told you that you have an intolerance to some sugars 
or if you have been diagnosed with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder in 
which a person cannot break down fructose, talk to your doctor before you take this medicine.
3.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection should be administered by a healthcare professional.
To prevent medication errors, it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the appropriate 
formulation (intravenous or subcutaneous formulation) and dose is being given to the patient as 
prescribed. DARZALEX solution for injection should be given by subcutaneous injection only, using 
the dose specified. DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation is not intended for intravenous 
administration.
DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection is for single use only and is ready to use.

DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection is compatible with polypropylene or 
polyethylene syringe material; polypropylene, polyethylene, or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) 
subcutaneous infusion sets; and stainless steel transfer and injection needles.
DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection should be a clear to opalescent and colourless 
to yellow solution. Do not use if opaque particles, discolouration or other foreign particles are 
present.
Remove the DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection vial from refrigerated storage 
(2 °C – 8 °C) and equilibrate to ambient temperature (15 °C–30 °C). The unpunctured vial may 
be stored at ambient temperature and ambient light for a maximum of 24 hours in the original 
carton to protect from light. Keep out of direct sunlight. Do not shake.
Prepare the dosing syringe in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.
To avoid needle clogging, attach the hypodermic injection needle or subcutaneous infusion set 
to the syringe immediately prior to injection.
Storage of prepared syringe

If the syringe containing DARZALEX is not used immediately, store the solution of 
DARZALEX for up to 24 hours refrigerated followed by up to 12 hours at 15 °C-25 °C and 
ambient light. If stored in the refrigerator, allow the solution to reach ambient temperature 
before administration.
Administration

Inject 15 mL DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection into the subcutaneous tissue of 
the abdomen approximately 7.5 cm to the right or left of the navel over approximately 3-
5 minutes. Do not inject DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection at other sites of the 
body as no data are available.
Injection sites should be rotated for successive injections.
DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection should never be injected into areas where the 
skin is red, bruised, tender, hard or areas where there are scars.
Pause or slow down delivery rate if the patient experiences pain. In the event pain is not 
alleviated by slowing down the injection, a second injection site may be chosen on the opposite 
side of the abdomen to deliver the remainder of the dose.
During treatment with DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection, do not administer other 
medicinal products for subcutaneous use at the same site as DARZALEX.
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

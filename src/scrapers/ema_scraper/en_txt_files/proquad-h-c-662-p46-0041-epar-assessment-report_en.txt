1.  ASSESSMENT 
Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 the MAH provides the final clinical 
study report for the study ‘An open-label, multicentre study of the safety of a 2-dose regimen of a 
combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella live vaccine (ProQuad) manufactured with 
recombinant human albumin (rHA) when administered to children in their second year of life, MRV01C. 
Assessment 
Rationale for the study 
In order to fulfill a post authorization commitment related to the marketing authorisation of M-M-
RVAXPRO (EMEA/H/C/604), the MAH proposed to provide additional safety data for its measles, 
mumps and rubella vaccine manufactured with recombinant human albumin (rHA) instead of human 
serum albumin (HSA). The MAH proposed to fulfill this commitment by conducting a phase III clinical 
safety study with ProQuad manufactured with rHA. This proposal was accepted by the CHMP in 
November 2006.  
ProQuad is currently manufactured using pooled serum-derived HSA. However, based on the same 
rationale as for M-M-RVAXPRO, the substitution of HSA by rHA in the bulk manufacturing process of 
ProQuad is under development. rHA is structurally and analytically comparable to the unmodified 
monomeric population of HSA. Thus, rHA and HSA, which are essentially similar, are considered 
functionally comparable for the production of viral bulks. Experimental data have confirmed that the 
substitution of HSA by rHA in the viral growth media results in satisfactory vaccine virus growth and 
product characteristics. However, concerns were raised whether repeated administration of MMR 
vaccines containing traces of rHA might lead to a higher rate of hypersensitivity/allergic reactions.  
The primary objective of study MRV01C was to provide additional safety data in relationship to the new 
vaccine manufacturing process using rHA. The specific study design was reviewed and approved by 
CHMP in May 2007.  
Study design 
Study MRV01C was an open-label study evaluating 2 doses of ProQuad/rHA administered 4 weeks 
apart in 3340 children 12 to 22 months of age. No control group was included. The safety follow-up 
period after each dose was planned to be 28 days to 42 days, which was a total of 56 to 84 days of 
safety follow-up. The study has been conducted in Denmark, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, 
Spain and Sweden from October 2007 (FVFS) to November 2008 (LVLS). 
The main inclusion criteria were as follows: 
Healthy infants aged 12 to 22 months; consent form signed by parent(s) or legal representative; no 
vaccination history and/or suspected clinical history and/or exposure in the past 30 days to measles, 
mumps, rubella, varicella and/or zoster; no history of febrile illness (defined as rectal temperature 
>=38.0°C) in the past 3 days; no known personal history of encephalopathy, seizure disorder or 
Assessment Report under Article 46

progressive, evolving or unstable neurological condition; no known sensitivity and/or allergy to any 
component of the study vaccine; no impairment of the immune system (including receipt of systemic 
corticosteroids for more than 14 days); no receipt of inactivated vaccine in the past 14 days or live 
vaccine in the past 28 days.  
The inclusion/non-inclusion criteria were in accordance with the approved SmPC of ProQuad. 
Objectives and Endpoints: 
Primary objective: 
To describe the safety profile of a second dose of ProQuad manufactured with rHA when administered 
to children in their second year of life 
Secondary objective:       
To describe the safety profile of a first dose of ProQuad manufactured with rHA when administered to 
children in their second year of life 
Primary endpoint: 
The primary safety objective of this study will describe the safety profile of a second dose of ProQuad 
manufactured with rHA when administered to children in their second year of life. 
No formal statistical hypothesis has been tested 
Secondary endpoint: 
The secondary safety objective of this study will describe the safety profile of a first dose of ProQuad 
manufactured with rHA when administered to children in their second year of life. 
These analyses will describe injection-site adverse reactions, systemic adverse events, daily 
temperatures, rashes and mumps-like illness and serious adverse events. 
Safety evaluations: 
For both evaluations, i.e. after the second dose of ProQuad (primary objective) and after the first dose 
of ProQuad (secondary objective), the safety criteria were as follows: 
• 
• 
From Day 0 to Day 4 following each dose solicited injection-site adverse reactions (i.e. 
injection-site erythema, injection-site swelling, injection-site pain) were evaluated: 
From Day 0 to Day 28 following each dose the following evaluations were conducted 
o  Unsolicited injection-site adverse reactions, 
o  Numeric values of temperature, 
o  Systemic adverse events: 
  Measles-like rash 
  Mumps-like illness 
  Rubella-like rash 
  Varicella-like rash 
  Zoster-like rash 
o  Other systemic adverse events

• 
From Day 0 to the next visit (or last visit in case of premature discontinuation) all serious 
adverse events were evaluated. 
No formal statistical hypothesis was tested. Injection-site adverse reactions, systemic adverse events, 
numerical values of temperature, rashes, mumps-like illnesses and serious adverse events were 
described. 
Results 
Demographic characteristics: 
At the date of first vaccination, the mean age of the 3,388 vaccinated subjects was 14.6 months 
(range 11.5 – 23.8). There were 1,650 (48.7%) girls and 1,738 (51.3%) boys. Their mean weight was 
10.4 kg (range 7 – 17) and their mean height was 78.3 cm (range 67 – 97).  
Most subjects (3,367 out of 3,388, 99.38%) received a previous vaccination: Mainly combined 
bacterial and viral vaccines (e.g. Pentavac, INFANRIX hexa, INFANRIX-IPV+Hib) for 3348 subjects 
(98.82%) and pneumococcal vaccines, for 2783 subjects (82.14%). 
Two subjects (0.06%), subjects 58041 and 67014, were included although they had already received a 
first dose of MMR vaccine (Triple Virica). This finding, which constituted a protocol deviation, was not 
known at baseline. These two subjects were withdrawn after the first injection of ProQuad thus the 
recommended schedule of 2 doses of MMR vaccine was followed for the concerned subjects. 
Out of 3388 subjects included, 12 did not present follow-up data after the first administration and were 
not included in the post-dose 1 safety set and 34 subjects did not present follow-up data after the 
second dose. 
Protocol Deviations: 
A total of 487 subjects out of 3388 vaccinated subjects, i.e. 14.37%, presented at least one protocol 
deviation. The most frequent type of deviation was related to a poor compliance with the immunization 
schedule (246 subjects; 7.26%), and with the time intervals between visits (344 subjects; 10.15%). 
Seven subjects (0.21%) received non-study vaccine(s), between Visit 2 and Visit 3, which constituted 
protocol deviations. 
Concomitant medications:  
A total of 1127 subjects (33.26%) received at least one concomitant medication for prophylaxis or 
adverse events following the first dose; a majority of the treatments were anilides (991 subjects, 
29.25%). A total of 601 subjects (17.74%) received at least one treatment following the second dose; 
a majority of the treatments were anilides (503 subjects, 14.85%). 
Safety evaluation 
Post dose 2  
From Day 0 to Day 28 after the second dose, 57.66% of subjects reported at least one adverse event, 
34.23% reported at least one injection-site adverse reaction and 40.42% reported at least one 
systemic adverse event (Table 1).

2.  RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND FURTHER 
ACTION IF REQUIRED 
The primary objective of study MRV01C was to provide additional safety data in relationship to the new 
vaccine manufacturing process using rHA. Specifically the MAH was asked to investigate the 
occurrence of adverse events related to hypersensitivity/allergic reactions following repeated doses of 
rHA containing vaccines. The rates of adverse reactions after the second dose of ProQuad were 
generally similar to, or lower than, those seen after the first dose. Especially the rate of allergic-type 
adverse events did not increase after the second dose. Only the injection side adverse events, 
Assessment Report under Article 46  
EMA/640073/2014  
Page 8/9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
particularly the rate of erythema, were lower post dose 1 compared with post dose 2. However, most 
of these events were mild.  
Overall, the safety profile of ProQuad manufactured with rHA is in accordance with the currently 
approved SmPC of ProQuad manufactured with HSA indicating that there is no increased risk of allergic 
reactions or other adverse events due to the use of rHA instead of HSA. 
However, it should be noted that after the second dose of ProQuad the solicited injection-site adverse 
reactions from Day 0 to Day 4 increase from 21.42% after the first dose, to 33.72% after the second 
dose. In particular, the injection site erythema is reported by 14.31% of individuals after the first dose 
and by 30.46% of individuals after the second dose; injection site swelling increases from 5.57% after 
the first dose to 13.23% after the second dose. Notwithstanding, considering that the increase is 
mainly due to events of mild or moderate intensity, it can be concluded that the safety profile of 
ProQuad manufactured with rHA is in accordance  with the currently approved SmPC of ProQuad 
manufactured with HSA. 
However, the MAH should present a type II variation to update section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to 
reflect the observed increase in the injection-site adverse reactions following the second dose of 
ProQuad. The wording “The rates of adverse reactions after the second dose of ProQuad were generally 
similar to, or lower than, those seen with the first dose” is no longer acceptable. 
  PAC fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled) - No further action required 
  PAC not fulfilled (not all commitments fulfilled) and further action required: 
The MAH is required to submit by 01.03.2011 the following variation(s): 
Update of section 4.8 to amend information on increase in injection site adverse reactions. 
Moreover, the MAH is asked to include a warning statement for patients with rare hereditary problems 
of fructose intolerance, since sorbitol is present in the vaccine. This is in accordance with the guideline 
on excipients and was unfortunately deleted during previous procedures.

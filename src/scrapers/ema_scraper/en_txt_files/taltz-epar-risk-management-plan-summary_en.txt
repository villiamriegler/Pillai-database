Summary of Risk Management Plan for Taltz (Ixekizumab) 
This summary of the RMP for Taltz should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which 
are part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of the 
Taltz RMP. 
I - The Medicine and What It is Used for 
Taltz is authorised for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis 
who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
Taltz, alone or in combination with methotrexate, is also authorised for the treatment of active 
PsA in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more 
DMARD therapies (see SmPC for the full indication).  It contains ixekizumab as the active 
substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection. 
Taltz is authorised for the treatment of adult patients with active radiographic axSpA/AS. 
Taltz is authorised for the treatment of adult patients with active nonradiographic axSpA with 
objective signs of inflammation. 
Taltz is authorised for the treatment of children from the age of 6 years and adolescents with 
moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy.  Further 
information about the evaluation of Taltz’s benefits can be found in Taltz’s EPAR, including in 
its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage.

II - Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or 
Further Characterise the RisksImportant risks of Taltz, together with measures 
to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for learning more about Taltz’s risks, are 
outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare providers 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (for 
example, with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Taltz is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Taltz are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be taken safely.  Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Taltz.  Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (for example, on the long-term use of the medicine).

post-authorisation development plan. 
Important Identified Risk:  Serious Infections 
Evidence for linking the risk to the medicine 
Ixekizumab works by modulating the immune system for the 
treatment of psoriasis, PsA, and axSpA.  This may also 
reduce the body’s ability to fight certain infections. 
In clinical trials, more patients on ixekizumab than on 
placebo experienced nonserious infections such as upper 
airway infection, thrush, conjunctivitis (“pink eye”), and 
fungal skin infections.  Neutropaenia has been commonly 
observed in patients receiving ixekizumab, raising the 
concern for possible increased risk of serious infection.  For 
the majority of cases, neutropaenia was transient in nature 
and did not result in treatment discontinuation or 
hospitalisation.  The majority of infection events were mild to 
moderate, with only a small proportion of patients (3%) 
experiencing a severe infection in clinical trials.

Important Identified Risk:  Serious Infections 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No risk groups or specific risk factors have been identified 
from the psoriasis, PsA, or axSpA clinical development 
programmes. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Additional pharmacovigilance activities 
Due to the mechanism of action and potential effect on 
decreasing immune response by anti-TNF or anti-IL 17 
classes of medicines, patients with evidence of untreated 
latent (inactive) TB or certain viral infections such as chronic 
HBV may be at greater risk of reactivation or exacerbation of 
their underlying disease.  It is reasonable to assume that this 
additional risk in patients with evidence of untreated latent 
TB or certain viral infections such as chronic HBV would 
apply to ixekizumab as well, even though this has not been 
observed in the clinical development programme.

Current evidence is mixed regarding contributions of IL-17A 
to the atherosclerotic plaque instability.  Sustained IL-17 
levels are present in the target population and may be linked 
to the pathology of atherosclerosis; however, the role played 
by IL-17 and T helper-17 cells in atherosclerosis is still 
controversial.  Several studies in mice suggest a contribution 
of the IL-17 pathway to vascular inflammation (Dart et al. 
2010; Kotla et al. 2013; Lim et al. 2014), yet other studies in 
animal models suggest a stabilising effect on the 
atherosclerotic plaque related to an inhibitory effect on 
endothelial vascular cells adhesion molecules (VCAM-1) 
(Taleb et al. 2009) and to a stimulatory effect on fibrillar 
collagen synthesis by smooth muscle cells (Gisterå et al. 
2013). 
No specific risk factors for MACE in relation to treatment 
with ixekizumab have been identified.

There are theoretical considerations which could link the 
pharmacologic mode of action of ixekizumab to the 
development of tumours; however, the current clinical and 
nonclinical data do not suggest that ixekizumab causes 
malignant tumours or promotes tumour growth. 
No specific risk factors for malignancy in relation to 
treatment with ixekizumab have been identified.

II.C.2 Other Studies in Post-Authorisation Development Plan 
Study Short Name and Title:  [Trial alias pending] An Observational Study to Assess the 
Utilization and Safety of Ixekizumab Among Pediatric Patients Treated in the Course of Routine 
Clinical Care  
Rationale and Study Objectives:  Ixekizumab, a humanised IgG subclass 4 monoclonal antibody 
that neutralises IL-17A, is under review for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in children ages 6 
years and above.  Data from clinical trials demonstrate that ixekizumab is effective and generally 
well-tolerated; however, long-term safety pertaining to the important risks of inflammatory 
bowel disease and serious infections among pediatric patients treated in clinical practice is not 
fully characterized. 
The objectives of this study are: 
•  To monitor the uptake of ixekizumab in a real-world pediatric population  
•  To characterize the demographics and clinical characteristics of pediatric patients 
receiving ixekizumab   
•  To provide additional information about the long-term safety pertaining to serious 
infections and inflammatory bowel disease  
Study Short Name and Title:  I1F-MC-RHBT– A Prospective, Observational Study to Assess the 
Long-Term Safety of Ixekizumab Compared with Other Therapies Used in the Treatment of 
Adults with Moderate-to-Severe Psoriasis (May Include Psoriatic Arthritis) in the Course of 
Routine Clinical Care 
Purpose of the study:  Ixekizumab is an IL-17A antagonist approved for the treatment of 
moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis.  Data from clinical trials 
demonstrate that ixekizumab is effective and generally well tolerated; however, the long-term 
safety profile among patients treated in routine clinical practice is not fully characterised. 
The objectives of this study are: 
•  To monitor the frequency and nature of infections, hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions, 
inflammatory bowel disease, “heart attack” (myocardial infarction) and stroke, and 
cancers in clinical practice 
•  To provide additional information on the long-term safety (effects which are infrequent, 
and/or take a long time to develop) in routine clinical practice 
•  To watch the frequency and nature of side effects in the very elderly in routine 
clinical practice  
•  To look for any new side effects 
•  To determine if the use of ixekizumab is associated with any new adverse effects, and to 
confirm the safety profile in a real-world setting 
Study Short Name and Title:  I1F-MC-B005 – Observational Study to Assess Maternal and Fetal 
Outcomes Following Exposure to Ixekizumab 
Purpose of the study:  Ixekizumab, a humanised IgG subclass 4 monoclonal antibody that 
neutralises IL-17A, is currently intended for systemic treatment of individuals with 
moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis and PsA.  Pregnant women were not included in the 
ixekizumab clinical development programme; however, it is recognised that IgG does cross the 
placenta and is central to foetal immunity, with transport increasing as the pregnancy progresses.  
Given that disease onset in the indicated psoriasis population commonly occurs prior to age 
35 years, when many women become pregnant, characterisation of risks to pregnant mothers and 
their infants is sought. 
The objectives of this study are: 
•  To understand the utilisation of ixekizumab among pregnant mothers with psoriasis, PsA, 
and other newly approved indications 
•  To look for any harmful effects of ixekizumab on pregnant mothers and their babies 
•  To look for any new side effects

Summary of risk management plan for Ultomiris (ravulizumab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Ultomiris. The RMP details 
important risks of Ultomiris, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about the risks and uncertainties (missing information) of Ultomiris. 
The summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for Ultomiris and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Ultomiris should be 
used. 
This summary of the RMP for Ultomiris should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of the 
RMP for Ultomiris. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Ultomiris is authorised for treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), 
atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS), generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG), and 
neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) (see SmPC for the full indication). It 
contains ravulizumab as the active substance and it is given by the intravenous or 
subcutaneous route of administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of benefits of Ultomiris can be found in the EPAR 
for Ultomiris, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under 
the medicine’s webpage. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks 
Important risks of Ultomiris, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about the risks of Ultomiris, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
−  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
− 
−  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
−  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Ultomiris, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Ultomiris is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Ultomiris are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Ultomiris. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks 
Meningococcal infection  
Serious haemolysis after drug discontinuation in 
PNH patients 
Severe TMA complications in aHUS patients after 
ravulizumab discontinuation 
Immunogenicity 
Serious infections 
Malignancies and haematologic abnormalities in 
PNH patients 
Use in pregnant and breast-feeding women 
Identified risk: Meningococcal infection  
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
This important identified risk is based on the 
ravulizumab mode of action, findings from the 
clinical trial development programme for 
ravulizumab, and on the long-term experience with 
eculizumab (Soliris). 
The link between terminal complement components 
deficiency states and (serious) infections caused by 
N. meningitidis is firmly established and evidenced 
by the scientific literature. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Main risk factors for these infections include: 
Risk minimisation measures 
−  Genetic deficiency or therapeutic inhibition of 
terminal complement 
−  Lack of commercially available vaccine against 
certain meningococcus serogroup 
− 
(Partial) resistance of meningococcal strain to 
prophylactic antibiotics 
−  Professionals who are exposed to environments 
of greater risk for meningococcal disease 
−  Research, industrial, and clinical laboratory 
personnel who are routinely exposed to 
N. meningitidis 
−  Military personnel during recruit training 
(military personnel may be at increased risk of 
meningococcal infection when accommodated in 
close quarters)  
−  Day-care centre workers  
−  Living on a college or university campus  
−  Travelling to endemic areas for meningococcal 
meningitis (e.g. India, Sub-Saharan Africa, 
pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia for Hajj)

Potential risk: Serious haemolysis after drug discontinuation in PNH patients 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
This is a theoretical possibility based on the mode of 
action of ravulizumab, nature of PNH, and 
experience with the use (and discontinuation) of 
Soliris (eculizumab). 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No risk factors have yet been identified.

Potential risk: Severe TMA complications in aHUS patients after ravulizumab 
discontinuation 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities 
This potential risk is based on the long-term 
observational prospective study with eculizumab 
(Study C11-003). Discontinuation of eculizumab can 
result in signs and symptoms of severe TMA 
complications. The efficacy results from C11-003 
observational study with eculizumab indicate that 
patients who discontinued eculizumab experienced a 
higher rate of TMA recurrence (13.5-fold) and 
showed a trend toward reduced renal function 
compared to patients who continued eculizumab 
treatment. 
No such effects have been observed in the clinical 
development programme for ravulizumab in aHUS 
patients. Therefore, this represents a potential risk 
for ULTOMIRIS. 
Patients with known genetic abnormalities in 
complement genes or known autoantibodies to 
complement proteins are likely at higher risk.

Potential risk: Immunogenicity 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
This potential risk is based on the known potential of 
all medicinal products and on the class effect of all 
therapeutic proteins, including mAbs. 
 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No specific risk factors for the development of 
immunogenicity have yet been identified.

This risk is a based on the mode of action of 
ravulizumab and experience with the use Soliris 
(eculizumab). Since relevance of serious infections 
to ravulizumab therapy has not been confirmed in 
clinical trials, this remains a potential risk. 
Patients with underlying immunodeficiency or 
acquired conditions (e.g. aplastic anaemia or 
myelodysplastic syndrome in patients with PNH or 
end-stage renal disease in patients with aHUS) or 
due to exposure of immunosuppressive drugs 
(e.g. long-term use of corticosteroids and/or 
immunosuppressive agents in patients with gMG and 
NMOSD).

Potential risk: Malignancies and haematologic abnormalities in PNH patients 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
This potential risk is based on the incidence of 
malignancies in PNH patients treated by Soliris 
(eculizumab). As the natural evolution of PNH 
makes PNH patients more prone to development of 
haematologic abnormalities or malignancies, the role 
of eculizumab or ravulizumab remains unknown. 
Patients with underlying myelodysplastic syndrome 
or other pre-leukaemic syndromes are at-risk of 
leukaemia acutisation.

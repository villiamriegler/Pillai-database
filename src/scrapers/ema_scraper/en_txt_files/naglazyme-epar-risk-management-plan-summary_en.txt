PART VI:  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Naglazyme (galsulfase) 
This is a summary of the RMP for Naglazyme. The RMP details important risks of 
Naglazyme, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be 
obtained about Naglazyme’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Naglazyme’s SmPC and its package leaflet give essential information to healthcare 
professionals and patients on how Naglazyme should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Naglazyme should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Naglazyme’s RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Naglazyme is authorised for the treatment of mucopolysaccahridosis VI (MPS VI; 
N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase deficiency; Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome) disease (see 
SmPC for the full indication). It contains galsulfase as the active substance and it is given 
by intravenous infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of Naglazyme’s benefits can be found in 
Naglazyme’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/naglazyme 
II. 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
charaterise the risks 
Important risks of Naglazyme, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Naglazyme’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg 
with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
 
In the case of Naglazyme, these measures are supplemented with additional risk 
minimisation measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected 
continuously and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance 
activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Naglazyme is not yet available, it 
is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Naglazyme are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Naglazyme. 
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long- 
term use of the medicine).

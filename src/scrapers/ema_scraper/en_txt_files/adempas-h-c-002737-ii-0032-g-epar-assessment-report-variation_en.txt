4.  Introduction 
Riociguat belongs to the class of soluble guanylate-cyclase (sGC) stimulators and is approved in the EU 
under the tradename “Adempas” for the treatment of pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) and chronic 
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Riociguat has a dual mode of action: it sensitizes sGC 
to the body’s own nitric oxide (NO) and can also increase sGC activity in the absence of NO. With its dual 
mode of action, riociguat is restoring the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway causing vasorelaxation.  
Vericiguat is another member of the class of sGC stimulators. The vericiguat company core data sheet 
(CCDS) states that concomitant use of other sGC stimulators, such as riociguat is contraindicated. To 
ensure a consistent safety instruction for this pharmacological class of sGC stimulators, the MAH has 
amended the CCDS of riociguat (current version CCDS #07) and proposes to update SmPC sections 4.3 
and 4.5 by adding a contraindication for coadministration with other sGC stimulators (e.g. vericiguat). 
Following CCDS #06, Type II variation EMEA/H/C/002737/II/0028 was submitted to include the results 
from the drug-drug interaction study between riociguat and HAART medications. In this update the 
change in the pharmacokinetic properties of riociguat (AUC and Cmax) in HIV patients in comparison to 
healthy subjects was presented. Afterwards an incorrect value for the increase in Cmax in HIV patients was 
erroneously depicted. Hence, the CCDS and SmPC section 4.5 are updated to rectify the riociguat peak 
plasma concentration (Cmax) increase in combination with HAART treatment. This error occurred only in 
the SmPC  and not in the source document. 
4.1.  Product development rationale 
Riociguat belongs to a class of sGC stimulators for the treatment of PAH and CTEPH.  
Compounds using similar pathway(s)/MoAs like sGC stimulators, nitrates, and PDE5 inhibitors are 
contraindicated for use in combination with riociguat because of an increased risk of hypotension as 
demonstrated in preclinical investigations and clinical studies. 
5.  Clinical pharmacology aspects 
5.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The SmPC for riociguat provides information regarding drug-drug interaction of riociguat with HAART 
medication used for treatment of HIV patients. The increase of riociguat peak plasma concentration in 
combination with HAART treatment should be corrected reflecting a maximum increase of 30%.  
Table 1: Summary of historical comparison - fasted (PKS, N=64, excluding 16 subjects from study 
11261) provides the corrected outcome of the statistical analysis showing AUC and Cmax ratio for 
riociguat on top of antiretroviral therapies versus a historical control (riociguat alone).

PKS = pharmacokinetics set, CV = coefficient of variation, AUC = area under the plasma concentration vs time curve 
from zero to infinity after single (first) dose, Cmax = maximum observed drug concentration in plasma after single dose 
administration  
Subjects of study 11261 were excluded as they received breakfast prior to study drug administration 
Concomitant administration of HAART combinations led to an increase in riociguat mean AUC of up to 
about 160% and to an approximate 30% increase in mean Cmax.  
The update of Cmax value does not change the overall positive benefit-risk balance for riociguat.  
6.  Clinical safety aspects 
6.1.  Drugs interacting by mode of action 
Riociguat belongs to a novel class of sGC stimulators and is approved in the EU for the treatment of PAH 
and CTEPH. With its dual mode of action, riociguat is restoring the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway, causing 
vasorelaxation. 
Compounds using similar pathway(s)/MoAs such as PDE5 inhibitors and nitrates are already 
contraindicated in riociguat because of an increased risk of hypotension. Therefore, like for PDE5 
inhibitors and nitrates, the MAH proposes to include a contraindication for co-administration with other 
sGC stimulators as an additive effect on the systemic circulation is to be expected. 
The current riociguat SmPC contains the following contraindications for co-administration with other 
drugs: 
•  Co-administration with PDE5 inhibitors (such as sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) (Sections 4.2 and 
4.5). 
•  Co-administration with nitrates or nitric oxide donors (such as amyl nitrite) in any form including 
recreational drugs called ‘poppers’ (Section 4.5). 
There are no data for co-administration of riociguat with other sGC stimulators, nevertheless it can be 
argued that compounds using similar pathway(s)/MoAs are already contraindicated in riociguat because

of an increased risk of hypotension and therefore, from a theoretical perspective, this can be expected 
from co-administration with other sGC stimulators like vericiguat (BAY 1021189 / MK1242). 
Vericiguat CCDS v 01.1 (Error! Reference source not found.) states that concomitant use of other sGC 
stimulators, such as riociguat is contraindicated. The rationale for the contraindication with other sGC 
stimulators is further explained as follows (Error! Reference source not found.): Coadministration of 
vericiguat and other sGC stimulators was not permitted in the Phase 3 VICTORIA clinical study. 
To ensure a consistent safety message for the pharmacological class of sGC stimulators, the MAH 
proposes for riociguat SmPC to contraindicate the coadministration with other sGC stimulators (e.g. 
vericiguat). 
7.  Changes to the product information 
7.1.  Section 4.3 
7.1.1.  MAH proposal 
The MAH proposes addition of the underlined text. 
-

- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Co-administration with PDE5 inhibitors (such as sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) (see sections 4.2 
and 4.5). 
Severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C). 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Pregnancy (see sections  4.4; 4.5 and 4.6). 
Co-administration with nitrates or nitric oxide donors (such as amyl nitrite) in any form including 
recreational drugs called ‘poppers’ (see section 4.5). 
Co-administration of Adempas with other soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators is contraindicated (see 
section 4.5). 
Patients with systolic blood pressure < 95 mm Hg at treatment initiation. 
Patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (PH-IIP) (see 
section 5.1)  
7.1.2.  Assessor’s comment 
The addition of the contra-indication is acceptable as it is consistent with the reciprocal contra-indication 
in the SmPC of vericiguat (the only other authorised sGC stimulator). However, the wording needs to be 
amended: 
• 
The contra-indication should refer to concomitant use rather than co-administration (suggesting 
use at the same timepoint) 
•  Use of the tradename is redundant.  
•  No complete sentence is required in 4.3  
• 
The cross reference to 4.5 retrieves no additional information and is therefore also redundant. 
The following changes result: 
- 
Concomitant use -administration of Adempas with other soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators is 
contraindicated (see section 4.5). 
The following would therefore be acceptable: 
Assessment report  
EMA/621814/2021

- 
Concomitant use with other soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators. 
7.2.  Section 4.4 
7.2.1.  MAH proposal 
The MAH proposes deletion of the text in strikethrough 
Concomitant use with other medicinal products 
• 
The concomitant use of riociguat with strong multi pathway cytochrome P450 (CYP) and P-
glycoprotein (P-gp) / breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitors such as azole antimycotics 
(e.g. ketoconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir) results in a 
pronounced increase in riociguat exposure (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
7.2.2.  Assessor’s comment 
This editorial change is accepted. The abbreviations are spelled out in section 4.2.  
Of note: there is some text in 4.2 near “BCRP” in 12 point font. 
7.3.  Section 4.5 (1)

Soluble Guanylate Cyclase Stimulators 
Co-administration of Adempas with other soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3). 
7.3.2.  Assessor’s comment 
The addition of the contra-indication is acceptable (see above). However, the wording needs to be 
amended: 
• 
The contra-indication should refer to concomitant use rather than co-administration (suggesting 
use at the same timepoint) 
•  Use of the tradename is redundant.  
• 
The cross reference can be set in normal font. 
The following would be acceptable: 
Soluble Guanylate Cyclase Stimulators 
Concomitant use of riociguat with other soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3).

7.4.  Section 4.5 (2) 
7.4.1.  MAH proposal 
The MAH proposes deletion of the text in strikethrough and addition of the underlined  text  
Effects of other substances on riociguat 
Riociguat is cleared mainly via cytochrome P450-mediated (CYP1A1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2J2) 
oxidative metabolism, direct biliary/faecal excretion of unchanged riociguat and renal excretion of 
unchanged riociguat via glomerular filtration.  
Concomitant use with strong multi pathway CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors  
Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) 
In vitro, abacavir, rilpivirine, efavirenz, ritonavir, cobicistat and elvitegravir inhibited CYP1A1 and the 
metabolism of riociguat in the order listed with abacavir as the strongest inhibitor. Cobicistat, ritonavir, 
atazanavir and darunavir are additionally classified as CYP3A inhibitors. In addition, ritonavir showed 
inhibition of P-gp. 
The impact of  HAART (including different combinations of abacavir, atazanavir, cobicistat, darunavir, 
dolutegravir, efavirenz, elvitegravir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, rilpivirine, ritonavir, and tenofovir) on 
riociguat exposure was investigated in a dedicated study in HIV patients. Concomitant administration of 
HAART combinations led to an increase in riociguat mean AUC of up to about 160% and to an approximate 
2030% increase in mean Cmax. The safety profile observed in HIV patients taking a single dose of 0.5 mg 
riociguat together with different combinations of HIV drugs used in HAART was generally comparable to 
other patient populations. 
To mitigate the risk of hypotension when Adempas is initiated in patients on stable doses of strong multi 
pathway CYP (especially CYP1A1 and CYP3A4) and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors, e.g. as contained in HAART, 
consider a reduced starting dose. It is recommended to monitor these patients for signs and symptoms of 
hypotension (see sections 4.2 and  4.4). 
7.4.2.  Assessor’s comment 
The correction of the error is accepted. 
Of note: In at least 15 instances (such as here), the use of the tradename in the current Adempas SmPC 
is redundant.

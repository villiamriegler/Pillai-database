Vildagliptin is an oral antidiabetic agent which belongs to the class of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP -4) 
inhibitors. The International Birth Date (IBD) of vildagliptin (Galvus) is 14  Feb 2007 (Mexico) and of 
vildagliptin/metformin FDC (Eucreas) is 14 Nov 2007 (EU).  Both vildagliptin and vildagliptin/metformin 
FDC is indicated in the treatment  of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in adults.  
The purpose of this application is to provide summary of the findings  from the recently concluded 5 -year 
study CLAF237A23156  (VERIFY Study - Vildagliptin Efficacy in combination with  metformin for early 
treatment of type 2 diabetes). The VERIFY study was conducted to determine whether the  early initiation 
of a vildagliptin  plus metformin combination regimen would result in mo re durable glycaemic control than 
a sequential approach, with  metformin monotherapy followed by combination therapy in treatment-naïve 
patients with  T2DM. 
The MAH has previously in 2010 submitted  results from a 24-week study (LMF23A2302)  of the  fixed dose 
combination of vildagliptin and metformin (gradually titrated  to a dose of 50  mg/500 mg twice  daily or 
50 mg/1000  mg twice daily) as initial  therapy in drug-naïve patients (var II/006/G). The study 
demonstrated that vildagliptin/metformin  50 mg/1000 mg twice  daily reduced HbA1c by -1.82%, 
vildagliptin/metformin 50  mg/500 mg twice daily by -1.61%,  metformin 1000 mg twice  daily by -1.36% 
and vildagliptin 50 mg twice  daily by -1.09% from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.6%.  Information from this 
study has been reflected in  section 5.1  of the SmPC for Eucreas.  
Assessment report  
EMA/402373/2021 
Page 5/54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With  this application the MAH  proposes changes in section 4.1,  4.4, 4.5 and 5.1  for Eucreas, Icandra and 
Zomarist. In the cover letter, the  MAH proposes modifications of the approved indication for Eucreas, 
Icandra and Zomarist to simplify the wording of the indication  in section 4.1, in line with  the guideline 
recommendations and the label wording of the  other D PP4 inhibitors, and, moreover, proposes to include 
information on study results from the finalised VERIFY study in section 5.1. However, in the submitted 
revised product information, the MAH  proposes further changes in section 4.1 and to extend the 
indication to  include “initial  combination of vildagliptin and metformin, when diabetes is not adequately 
controlled by diet  and exercise alone”. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this  application, which was considered acceptable by  the 
CHMP,  while an updated ERA was required. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
As this procedure concerned a change in indication,  an updated ERA was required for the  originally 
applied products including  the authorised new indications . An updated ERA has been provided on request 
however some issues remain, and the ERA(s) cannot be considered finalized within  this  variation.  
Regarding vildagliptin:  The ERA remains to be updated by the data an OECD TG308 and OECD TG218 
study was missing for vildagliptin.  A commitment  (with  time schedule by June 2023) to  submit an update 
has been made by the MAH.  Depending on the  outcome of the study a risk characterisation of the 
sediment is deemed necessary. If so, this  will also involve recalculating the PEC sediment for which 
adsorption data on soils and sludges would be needed. Data of adsorption/desorption studies is available 
for three types of sludges, but  not for soils. The MAH  intends to use a worst-case KOCsoil of 100 000. 
Regarding metformin: A previous assessment of metformin degradation in water sediment systems 
(OECD TG308) within  the application EMEA/H/C/2656  (in 2014) found metformin hydrochloride to be 
persistent. A supportive study ([14C]JNJ-28431754  – Generation of Aerobic Transformation Products for 
Identification in Aquatic Sediment Systems) on the formation of transformation products was also 
provided in EMEA/H/C/2656  but has not been noted/included in the present ERA. The following 
recalculated sediment DT50 value should be used:  DT50 (sediment) = 70.5  – 354.8  days (SFO, 20°C). 
Although metformin has shown to be very persistent (DT50>180d, 12°C)  in one of the sediments, several 
sets of data on Metformin  confirm degradation to higher contents, which suggests that  the derived DT50 
of 70.5 d (20°C)  is more reliable. In both sediments a limited amount of extractable parent and a high 
amount of non-extractable residues (>70%)  were observed. Therefore, Metformin hydrochloride is 
considered to be persistent in sediments (150.5 d, 12°C)  which should be noted in an updated ERA. 
Additionally, a commitment for a Fish  Full Life Cycle Test for Metformin is requested. The applicant is 
recommended to handle this matter via a letter of access for such a metformin study if possible. The 
company committed to  provide the necessary ERA information and update as a post-authorisation 
measure by 31.05.2023. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
This procedure concerned a change in indication and an updated ERA has been provided on request. 
Some issues regarding vildagliptin and metformin remain, and the ERA(s) cannot be considered finalized 
within  this variation and necessary update will be provided latter as REC commitment. It was also noted 
Assessment report  
EMA/402373/2021 
Page 6/54 
 
 
 
 
that  in section SmPC 6.6. and Package Leaflet there was no disposal advice of the product , therefore 
disposal statement  was included and SmPC and PL updated accordingly. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this  application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP,  while an updated ERA was required and provided. Remaining ERA information regarding 
vildagliptin and metformin will be provided, and ERA updated accordingly as a post-authorisation measure 
(REC) by 31.05.2023.   
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The current application is based on the results of one study CLAF237A23156  (VERIFY), her eafter referred 
to as study VERIFY. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by  the WSA. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
As part of the CDS update, an assessment was conducted against the  individual labels of vildagliptin and 
metformin. In the innovator label of metformin, an interaction  was noted with  concomitant  use of drugs 
that  interfere with  common renal tubular transport systems involved  in the  renal elimination of 
metformin. 
A systematic review of information on clinical pharmacology and interactions of metformin  and vildagliptin 
in clinical databases using various key words was performed according to the  criteria mentioned below. 
Databases:  Stockley’s drug interactions, Medline, Drug interaction database, Embase and International 
pharmaceutical abstracts. 
Key words: “Metformin”, “Vildagliptin”,  “Pharmacokinetics (PK)”, “Pharmacodynamics  (PD)”, 
“Metabolism” and “Interactions”. 
Experiments performed in cell lines expressing hOCT2, hMATE1  and hMATE2-K confirmed the  in vitro 
uptake of metformin (Kimura et al 2004 and Tanihara et al 2007).  The in vitro findings were further 
confirmed by the clinical drug interaction data where metformin exposure was increased when co-
administered with  cimetidine, dolutegravir, ranolazine and vandetanib  (inhibitors  of hOCT2, hMATE1  and 
hMATE2-K).  Due to the unavailability of selective inhibitors of these transporters, the relative contribution 
of each transporter in the renal uptake of metformin could not  be established. 
Some of the clinical drug interaction studies of metformin done with  OCT2, MATE1 and  MATE2-K 
transporters are summarized in the table below: 
Assessment report  
EMA/402373/2021 
Page 7/54 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH satisfactorily justified why a warning regarding an interaction with  metformin and the renal 
transporter inhibitors OCT2, MATE1 and MATE-2K is being included in the SmPC for Eucreas in section 
4.4. and 4.5  and also provided relevant references to support this claim. In section 4.5 of the SmPC, the 
information about renal inhibitors  has as suggested been placed under the  subheading Combinations 
requiring precautions for use. The package leaflet has been updated to add the interaction with  cimetidine 
as requested to section 2, Other medicines and <X>. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study(ies) 
Study VERIFY 
This was a 5-year study in treatment naïve patients  with T2DM  to demonstrate the  superiority of 
combination of vildagliptin 50mg bid and metformin over metformin monotherapy in treatment-naïve 
patients with  T2DM, by testing  the hypothesis that the risk of confirmed initial treatment  failure (defined 
as HbA1c ≥ 7.0%) is lower with  the combination of vildagliptin and metformin c ompared with metformin 
monotherapy. 
Methods 
VERIFY was a phase IV, multi-centric,  double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm, parallel group study with  a 
run-in period and up to 5 years treatment period (Figure 1). 
Following  a screening visit (Visit 1) and a screening period of up to 2 weeks, treatment-naïve patients, 
meeting all eligibility criteria entered the run-in  period at Visit 2. 
Run-in period: At Visit  2, in all eligible patients, metformin treatment was initiated and/or uptitrated.  At 
the end of the 3-week run-in  period, patients  who were able to tolerate a total  dose of at least 1000 mg 
and up to 2000  mg daily proceeded to randomization and started in  Period 1. 
Period 1 (vildagliptin/metformin combination versus metformin): At Visit  3, patients were 
randomized 1:1 to  one of the following study regimens:  
•  Metformin up to  1000 mg bid plus vildagliptin  50 mg bid or 
•  Metformin up to  1000 mg bid plus matching placebo bid 
During the first 4 weeks of Period 1 the metformin dose could be adjusted (increased or  decreased, but 
not below 1000  mg daily or above 2000 mg). The objective was to optimise metformin dose to 2000  mg 
daily or to the  maximum tolerated dose. No anti-diabetic  medication other than  the study drug regimen 
was allowed during  Period 1, except if the patient  had temporarily reduced/interrupted the treatment 
regimen due to AEs or untoward events that  require temporary dose adjustments. In such cases dose

adjustments or interruptions of the study drug were permitted. Patients  who, during Period 1, took anti -
diabetic medication other than the study drug regimen (except for AEs or untoward events that  require  
temporary dose adjustments) were to be discontinued from the  study. 
The duration of Period 1 could differ between patients depending on the time when the  second of two 
HbA1c measurements taken at two consecutive visits after randomization confirmed HbA1c ≥ 7.0%   (i.e. 
reached the primary endpoint of the study).  When/if patients reached this endpoint,  they entered into 
Period 2 of the study. Otherwise, they remained in Period 1. 
Period 2 (vildagliptin/metformin combination versus vildagliptin add -on to metformin): When 
entering period 2,  patients who were randomized to  the placebo arm in Period 1 received vildagliptin 50 
mg bid. Patients who were randomized to the active vildagliptin 50 mg bid arm in Period 1 continued to 
receive vildagliptin 50 mg bid. All patients continued  to take their metformin dose unchanged. Period 2 
remained masked to the patient  and both patients and investigators remained masked to the treatment 
allocation in Period 1. No  anti-diabetic medication other than the study regimen was allowed during 
Period 2, except if the patient had temporarily reduced/interrupted the treatment regimen due to  AEs or 
untoward events that required temporary dose adjustment/interruption. 
If, during Period 2, therapy intensification was required in accordance with  the local guide lines, the 
patient entered Period 3. Period 2  was considered ended when insulin treatment  was initiated,  or, 
alternatively, when the  patient was discontinued because the patient  did not initiate  insulin treatment  in 
Period 3. 
Period 3 (insulin initiation): In Period 3, patients were to be initiated  on open-label insulin.  The study 
drug regimen continued unchanged and remained masked to the patient  in Period 3 and both  patients 
and investigators remained masked to the treatment allocation in Period 1.

were strictly  treatment naïve since 1 month of pre vious treatment with  metformin was allowed. 
Objectives Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary objective 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the  superiority of  early combination of vildagliptin 
50 mg bid and metformin over metformin monotherapy in treatment-naïve patients with  T2DM by testing 
the hypothesis that  the risk of confirmed initial  treatment failure (defined as HbA1c ≥ 7.0%)  is lower with 
the combination of vildagliptin and metformin compared to that  with  metformin monotherapy. The 
primary endpoint was “time to  initial treatment failure” defined as HbA1c≥7.0%,  confirmed at  two 
consecutive scheduled study visits, starting from Visit 4 (Week 13). 
Secondary objectives 
• 
Testing the hypothesis that  the rate of loss in glycaemic control over time (estimated annualised 
slope of HbA1c over time using  a random coefficient model or by threshold) is lower with  
the combination vildagliptin  plus metformin compared to that  with  metformin monotherapy. 
• 
Progression of HbA1c from 26 weeks after the start of Period 2 to  the end of Period 2   assessed by 
rate of loss in glycaemic control over time. 
• 
Progression of FPG evaluated by the rate of loss in glyc aemic control over time assessed by 
estimated annualised slope of FPG over time for periods. 
•  Change in HbA1c 
•  Safety and tolerability.

Sample size 
A total sample size of 1000 randomized patients  per treatment group (in 1:1  allocation ratio to 
vildagliptin +  metformin and metformin monotherapy) was planned. The sample size calculation assumed 
that  all randomized patients were to  be followed up for 5 years unless patients dropped out from the 
study for various reasons (lack of efficacy, AEs, abnormal labs, lost to  follow -up etc.), and that  the yearly 
dropout rate is 11%, based on ADOPT data (Kahn et al 2006).  
The existing vildagliptin study data suggested that approximately 10% of vildagliptin patients  would have 
an HbA1c >7.0%  after the first  3 months of the study (initial  response phase), since those patients who 
were randomized with  an HbA1c measurement above the failure threshold (7.0%) might  never have an 
HbA1c measurement below the required threshold during the  study and were therefore to be counted as 
failures during the  first 13 weeks. A similar proportion was assumed for the comparator arm. Hence it 
was expected that  the difference in failure rate was likely to be small early in  the study but diverges as 
the study progresses. The power calculations have been adjusted  to take this assumption into  account 
using statistical  simulations. 
The simulations showed that assuming an annual initial treatment  failure rate of 7.1%  in the metformin 
monotherapy arm (estimated based on ADOPT data), incorporating a 10%  initial failure  rate after 13 
weeks in each treatment group (due to some patients with  baseline HbA1c  ≥7.0%), 1000  patients per 
treatment group would be sufficient to detect a hazard-ratio of 0.75  between vildagliptin  + metformin and 
metformin alone (corresponding to  a risk reduction rate of 25% in vildagliptin  + metformin group versus 
metformin alone) with  approximate 75% power and a 1-sided significance level of 0.025 (corresponding 
to a 2-sided test at 0.05). 
The sample size calculation seemed appropriate, even if the p ower of the primary test  was low at the 
planning stage of the trial. This is, however, not an issue, given the study results. It is acknowledged that 
the planned sample size remained unchanged when the rate of loss in glycaemic control over time was 
removed from the primary to  the secondary endpoints. 
Randomisation 
Patients were assigned in a ratio of 1:1  to one of two  treatment groups: 
-  Metformin up to  1000 mg bid plus vildagliptin  50 mg bid (Period 1).  
-  Metformin up to  1000 mg bid plus vildagliptin  placebo 50 mg bid (Period 1).   
In Period 2 all patients received metformin up to 1000 mg bid plus vildagliptin  50 mg bid. 
A patient randomisation list was produced by the IRT provider using a validated system that  automated  
the random assignment of patient  numbers to randomisation numbers. These randomisation 
numbers were linked to  the different treatment groups, which in turn  were linked to medication  
numbers. A separate medication list was produced by or under the  responsibility of Novartis  
drug supply management using a validated system that automated the  random assignment of  
medication numbers to  study drug packs containing each of the study drugs.  The randomized allocation 
to treatment approach was provided by centre. 
The randomisation numbers were generated for each study centre using an IRT system. The 
randomisation was not  stratified.

Blinding (masking) 
As described in the CSR, patients,  investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, and data 
analysts remained masked to the identity of the treatment  from the time of randomisation until  database 
lock, using  the following methods: (1) randomisation data were kept strictly confidential until  the time of  
unmasking, and were not accessible by anyone else involved in the  study ; (2) the identity  of the 
treatments was concealed by the  use of study drugs that were all identical in packaging,  labelling, 
schedule of administration and appearance. Unmasking could only occur in  the case of patient 
emergencies. The database was locked on May 10, 2019.

Per protocol set 
A subset of FAS that  consisted of all randomized patients  who received at least 
(PPS) 
one dose of randomized study medication (vildagliptin or placebo), had at least 
one post-randomization assessment of any efficacy parameter in Period 1, did  not 
discontinue the study prior to Week 26,  and had no major protocol deviations 
occurring during  Period 1. 
Primary efficacy variable 
The primary efficacy variable was time to confirmed initial treatment  failure, defined as the time  from 
randomization to the second of two  consecutive scheduled visits, at which  HbA1c ≥ 7.0% was measured, 
starting from Visit 4 (13  weeks after randomization), i.e. the end of Period 1.  
Primary analysis 
The primary statistical hypothesis of time to confirmed initial  treatment failure was assessed by a 1 -sided 
test of superiority of the combination treatment  with  vildagliptin + metformin versus metformin 
monotherapy on alpha level of 0.025. The null hypothesis was that  the hazard-ratio (HR)  between the 
combination treatment vildagliptin  + metformin and metformin monotherapy was equal or greater than 1, 
and the 1-sided alternative hypothesis was that  the hazard-ratio was less than  1.  
The primary efficacy analysis used a Cox proportional hazard regression model to  assess the probability 
of confirmed initial  treatment failure, with  treatment  approach and geographic region as classification 
variables and baseline HbA1c as a covariate. The hazard-ratio and associated 95% confidence interval as 
well as the p-value estimated from the above model were presented by treatment  approach. The 
confirmed initial  treatment failure rate over time by treatment approach was  summarized using estimates 
and 95% confidence intervals from a Kaplan-Meier analysis. The primary analysis for the primary efficacy 
variable was performed using the  FAS and repeated in  the PPS as supportive analysis.  Patients who 
discontinued the study for any reason during  Period 1 (la ck of efficacy, lost to follow-up,  AE or abnormal 
laboratory values etc.) were treated as censored values at the time of discontinuation.  Patients who 
remained under the threshold (or whose measurement above the threshold was not confirmed at next 
scheduled visit)  were censored at the time of last study visit. 
As supportive analyses, time to first treatment  failure (derived as the time from randomization to the first 
of two consecutive scheduled visits, at which HbA1c ≥7.0%  was measured, starting from Visit 4, at 13 
weeks after randomization), and time to  second treatment failure (a post-hoc endpoint, derived as the 
time from randomization to the  second of the two consecutive scheduled visits, at which  HbA1c ≥7.0% 
was measured in Period 2) were analysed in a similar way as in the primary analysis. Patients who 
discontinued the study for any reason during  Period 1 or Period 2 without  the treatment failure were 
censored at the date of discontinuation.  Patients that faile d in Period 1 and did not  fail in  Period 2 were 
censored at the end of Period 2. Patients who did not  fail in Period 2 who passed to Period 3 were 
censored to last study visit prior Period 3.  
Subgroup analyses of HbA1c by treatment approach were performed using descriptive statistics.   
Secondary analyses 
The rate of loss in glycaemic control over time was estimated by the slope of HbA1c  over time (in years) 
as a random coefficient in a linear mixed effect model: the model was fitted to HbA1c  data collected from 
Visit 5 (Week 26)  and onwards, up to  and including  the end of the Period 1 visit, i.e. up to  and including 
the initial  treatment failure date. It included treatment approach, geographic r egion, baseline HbA1c, time 
(of HbA1c measurements, in years) and the interaction of treatment  approach by time as the fixed 
effects, and time and intercept as random effects.  
For the time to  insulin initiation  (defined as the time  from treatment start  to the date of initiation  of 
insulin therapy prescribed in Period 3 or to the date of discontinuation from the study in Period 2  due to 
Assessment report  
EMA/402373/2021

being unable or unwilling  to initiate  insulin therapy for  treatment  intensification in Period 3)  the same Cox 
proportional hazards regression model used in the primary efficacy endpoint was used for this secondary 
variable as well.  Patients who discontinued the study during Period 1  or Period 2 for reasons other than 
not being able or unwilling  to initiate  insulin therapy in Period 3 (i.e. for treatment intensification),  or who 
completed the study during Period 1 or Period 2, were  censored at the  time of last study visit. 
Variables related to the  rate of change of β-cell function and insulin  sensitivity over time, as well as 
variables related to the  rate of loss in glycaemic control over time, were assessed using a similar random 
coefficient linear mixed effect model as used for the endpoint  ‘rate of loss in glycaemic control in HbA1c 
from Visit  5 (Week 26) to  the end of Period 1’.   
All secondary efficacy variables related to change from baseline to an endpoint were analysed using  an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with  treatment approach, geographic region as  classification 
variables and baseline value as a covariate . In a subgroup of patients,  change in total  retinal micro -
aneurysm count from Baseline to: i) Year 4 (Week 208 visit); ii)  Year 5 (Week 260  visit) was analy sed 
using the same ANCOVA model. The least squares mean (“adjusted mean”) change from Baseline for 
each treatment  approach, the difference in the least squares mean changes between the two treatment 
approaches, and the two-sided adjusted 95% confidence interval along with the  p-value for the difference 
was obtained from this  analysis model and presented. 
No imputation  was used for missing HbA1c measurements. If there was a case where the  HbA1c value 
was missing, then for consecutive scheduled visits only visits with  non -missing HbA1c measurements 
were considered (e.g. if Visit 4 HbA1c  ≥7.0%, Visit 5  HbA1c was missing, and Visit 6  HbA1c ≥7.0%, then 
this was to be considered treatment failure). 
Safety analyses: In order to assess safety and tolerability of vildagliptin as compared to placebo as add -
on to metformin, key safety variables (overall AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to   study drug  discontinuation, 
incidence of hypoglycemia, predefined AE risks, predefined categories of liver enzyme (ALT/AST) and CPK 
and persistent elevations) as well as other predefined safety assessments were summarized by treatment 
approach. 
No interim analyses were planned for this study. 
Changes in  the planned analyses were made during development of the statistical  analysis plan (SAP) 
(final version 3, 7 May 2019)  and led to the last protocol amendment (number 4, 22  Oct 2019). The 
major changes were redefining the  loss of glycaemic control as a secondary endpoint inste ad of a primary 
endpoint as initially planned, and redefining time  to initial treatment  failure to be time to confirmed initial 
treatment failure, measured until the  second of the two HbA1c  measurement ≥7.0% instead of the first 
as initially planned. Sample size section has been updated to  include only the primary endpoint,  with  no 
changes in  the sample size. Time to  first treatment failure and few subgroup analyses of the primary 
endpoint were also added.  
According to the  initial CSP, there were two primary efficacy variables defined: 
1)  time to initial  treatment failure, defined as time from randomization until  the time when the  first 
of the two HbA1c measurement ≥7.0% was determined after at least 13 weeks of treatment 
(Visit 4). 
2)  the rate of loss of glycaemic control over time. It was to be estimated by an annualised slope of 
HbA1c over time from Visit 5 (Week 26)  to the end of Period 1. 
Post-hoc analyses include time  to second treatment failure and few subgroup analyses by age and 
baseline GFR.  
The planned analyses in general were found appropriate. For the primary analysis, patients who 
discontinued the study for any reason during  Period 1 were censored ; however, it  was unclear how 
Assessment report  
EMA/402373/2021

treatment discontinuations  and any rescue medica tions were handled. Sensitivity analyses should be 
performed where also treatment discontinuations  and rescue medication intake (if any) are censored or 
imputed as treatment failures, accompanied by the numbers of observations censored for a specific 
reason. Sensitivity analyses presented as requested confirmed the results of the primary analysis. It 
appeared that the  MAH had censored treatment discontinuations  in the primary analysis and not study 
discontinuations  as was described in the analysis plan. Numbers of study discontinuations  were 187 and 
216 in  Vildagliptin and placebo group, respectively. 
The primary statistical hypothesis of superiority of the combination treatment versus metformin was 
tested on alpha level of 2.5% (1-sided). One-sided superiority tests are not  conventional for confirmatory 
trials but may be acceptable for the assessment of the study results. However, p -values from 2-sided 
tests are expected to  be presented in the SmPC, particularly when the test results are not  statisticall y 
compelling.     
Substantial changes have been made in the planned analyses concerning the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Two primary efficacy variables were initially planned: time to initial  treatment failure and rate of loss of 
glycaemic control over time. Definition of the initial  treatment failure had been changed during the course 
of the study. After study completion (and unclear if prior to  the database lock) the  statistical analysis plan 
was updated to remove the loss of glycaemic control as primary endpoint. These changes have been 
described in the submitted  documentation, but  without  a clear rationale. Considering that  the rate of loss 
of glycaemic control over time is not statistically significant,  it may be suspected that the  change of the 
primary endpoints was data driven and the study integrity  undermined. The MAH is expected to  provide 
rationale for the change of the primary endpoints and comment if the  decision was data driven.  
The MAH considered that  two consecutive value s were more robust than  one due to fluctuation  of HbA1c. 
It was assured by the MAH that  removal of the loss of glycaemic control as primary endpoint  was not 
data driven. The main arguments for the change were to focus on a clinically interpretable and 
predictable measure, and, considering its clinical importance, to enable a full alpha allocation initially.   It 
was further discussed that  the change in  the multiple testing  procedure due to  the change to  one primary 
endpoint does not alter the conclusion of statistical  significance for the primary endpoint,  which has been 
acknowledged. 
Irrespectively of the MAH’s specification of the order of importance of the variables, the judgement of 
what is required for demonstration of efficacy in terms of endpoints, whether it  would be both or one, and 
which one in case of the latter, is in  the end made by the regulator. If significance of both initially  defined 
primary variables is required for a positive efficacy conclusion, then  the study cannot be deeme d as a 
success in respect to the primary efficacy analyses, despite the  change of the primary endpoints. 
However, it  was initially anticipated that  significance of either one of the initially  defined two  primary 
endpoints was deemed sufficient for the study success with  multiplicity  being handled using Hochberg’s 
multiple testing  step-up procedure, according which  the hypothesis relating to the lower of the two 
obtained p-values was to be rejected if p<0.0125  (one-sided). Also, if Bonferroni split is used, then 
significance on alpha level of 2.5% (2-sided)  for any of the  initially defined primary endpoints,  as the case 
here, indeed proves the efficacy. Therefore, positive efficacy result for the  study could statistically  be 
concluded despite the  change of the primary variables. Statistical significance is compelling for the 
primary endpoint time to  confirmed initial treatment  failure and supported by the  results of the time  to 
first treatment failure. Long-term efficacy in terms of rate of loss in  glycaemic control over time 
(estimated annualised slope of HbA1c over time) is, however, not demonstrated. 
Time to second treatment failure has been added as a post-hoc endpoint in the CSR but was not 
mentioned in the final SAP nor in the amended protocol version 4.  However, in the CSR section 9.8.3, 
time to second treatment failure is listed among the changes related to the  protocol amendment made in

2016.  Timing for the  addition of this endpoint needed to  be clarified and a rationale was provided 
together with  a discussion on the importance of this  endpoint for the study conclusions.   
It was also noted that  the primary efficacy analysis presented by HR has been interpreted in  terms of 
relative risk, which is not statistically  correct (see for example Janez Stare &  Delphine Maucort-Boulch 
(2016);  Odds Ratio, Hazard Ratio and Relative Risk. Metodoloski zvezki, Vol. 13, No.  1, 2016, 59 -67). 
The interpretation was thefore requested to be reworded in  the SmPC section 5.1.   
Results 
Participant flow 
It was planned to screen approximately 4000 patients in  order to randomize 2000  patients. As per the 
plan, 2001  patients were randomized, 998 patients into  the vildagliptin 50mg  bid + metformin group and 
1003  into the placebo +  metformin group. 
Table 1. displays the subject disposition over the entire study period by treatment groups. A total  of 811 
(81.3%)  patients in the  early combination group and 787  (78.5%) in  the monotherapy group completed 
the study. The most frequent reason for early discontinuation  was administrativ e problems (9.5% of 
patients overall). There were no major differences between treatment groups for any reason for 
discontinuation.  Of note, the annualized discontinuation rate is about 4% (20.1%/5),  thus  lower than  the 
anticipated 11%  discontinuation rate.

Baseline data 
Demographic and other background characteristics were overall well balanced between both treatment 
groups. The mean age was 54.3  years, and 25.4%  of patients were older than 65 years.  
The ratio of females and males was balanced (53.0%  and 47.0%).  Most subjects were Caucasian 
(60.8%),  followed by Asian (18.6%) and Native American (10.5%).  The mean body m ass index (BMI) 
was 31.1 kg/m2. There were only small, non-significant differences between treatment groups for any 
demographic characteristics. 
Mean HbA1c at randomization (Visit 3) was 6.7%  in both treatment groups. The majority of all patients 
(71.3%)  had a mean HbA1c of <7.0%. Mean fasting  plasma glucose for all patients was 7.1 mmol/L.  The 
mean duration  of diabetes was 6.4 months; the  median duration was shorter (3.3 months); the  higher 
mean value is driven by few patients  (20) with  longer than allowed  disease duration at baseline (≤ 24 
months) which  was defined as protocol deviation. Most  patients had normal renal function at baseline 
(66.0%).

Medical  history 
In both treatment groups a similar pattern  was observed for all system organ classes (SOCs) and 
preferred terms. Most  frequently reported were conditions within  the SOC Vascular disorders (65.0% in 
the early combination and 66.2%  in the monotherapy group); within  this  system organ class, most 
frequently reported was hypertension (59.4%  vs. 61.3%,  respectively). Second frequently rep orted were 
conditions within  the SOC Metabolism and nutrition  disorders (58.6% and 57.7%,  respectively); most 
frequently reported within  this SOC were dyslipidemia (30.7%  vs, 29.0%) and obesity (17.7%  vs. 17.3%, 
respectively). 
Prior and concomitant therapy 
Most  frequently used was metformin or metformin hydrochloride (40.6% and 41.1%   of patients  in the 
early combination group and monotherapy group, respectively). Other  antidiabetic medication was used 
infrequently (<1% for any antidiabetic  medication). 
Concomitant medication was used by the majority of subjects at any time over the entire study  period 
(93.9%  of patients  in the early combination group and 93.4% in  the monotherapy group . Most frequently 
used medication included antihypertensives such as angiotensin II antagonists  either plain (21.5%  vs.  
21.8%  of patients,  respectively) or in combination with  other compounds, and lipid -lowering medication, 
such as statins  (41.6%  vs. 42.5%,  respectively). There was little differenc e between treatment groups for 
any specific concomitant medication. 
In both treatment groups, the mean duration of metformin taken during the screening and run -in  period 
was 9 weeks, and the average daily metformin dose approximately 1.4 g .

In general the baseline characteristics were balanced; however, the  MAH was asked to comment on that 
patients who did  not meet the inclusion criteria on HbA1c (≥6.5%  and ≤7.5%),  BMI (≥22 and ≤40 
kg/m2) and diabetes duration (≤ 24  months) were included in the  study. The MAH  has clarified that 
almost all included patients met the inclusion criteria with  respect to BMI and HbA1c.  
Numbers analysed 
Table 2  provides an overview of the number of patients  in the analysis populations. Almost all patients 
were included in the  Safety set (99.9%)  and in  the Full  analysis set (98.6%).  The  majority of patients 
was also included into  the Per protocol set (92.5%).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint results 
The primary efficacy variable was time to confirmed initial treatment  failure defined as the time from 
randomization until the  time when the second of the two  HbA1c measurement ≥7.0%  was determined  
after at least 13 weeks of treatment (Visit 4), i.e. the  end o f Period 1. The results of the analysis are 
presented in Table  4. 
The initiation  of an early combination regimen of vildagliptin  50 mg bid plus metformin resulted in  a 
statistically significant  reduction in the relative risk for time to confirmed initial treatment  failure vs 
metformin monotherapy in treatment-naïve patient with  T2DM over the 5-year study duration (Full 
analysis set). The incidence of initial  treatment failure was 429  (43.6%)  patients in the combination 
treatment group and 614 (62.1%)  patients in  the monotherapy group (HR [95%CI]: 0.51  [0.45,  0.58]; 
p<0.001).

Table 4 Cox regression analysis of time to initial treatment  failure (FAS and   PPS) 
The results in the per protocol set were consistent  with those from the full analysis set.   
From Month  6, the probability of initial treatment  failure (FAS) was lower in the early combination 
treatment arm compared to the monotherapy treatment group. The median (interquartile range, IQR) 
observed time to treatment failure in the monotherapy group was 36.1 (15.3,  not estimable [NE]) 
months, while  the median treatment  failure time for those receiving early combination therapy could only 
be estimated to be beyond the study duration at 61.9  (29.9, NE)  months (post-hoc analyses, on file). At 
the end of Year 5, the probability of initial treatment  failure was 46.4% in  the early combination therapy 
group and 66.6% in the  monotherapy group.

Subgroup analyses for time to initial treatment failure  
Subgroup analyses for time to initial  treatment failure revealed a consistently significant benefit of early 
combination treatment over monotherapy for the primary outcome (Figure 3). This benefit was 
demonstrated for all of the subgroups of HbA1c, BMI, age, gender, smoking status, race, geographical 
regions, and estimated glomerular filtration  rate (eGFR) categories, with  no evidence of heterogeneity (all 
p-values above 0.05).

The study reached its primary endpoint, but  the clinical relevance of the results needed to  be discussed 
and the MAH  provided further discussion. The mean HbA1c  was similar in both treatment  groups at the 
end of study after 5 years, and therefore the clinical relevance of the observed difference up to this time 
point (“the  legacy effect”) was still an issue of concern considering that  treatment with  two products 
instead of one always increases the risk of adverse events.

It was acknowledged that  the clinical relevance of the results ca nnot be further justified based on data 
from the  VERIFY study.  Instead, relevant previous knowledge is what potentially could serve as support.  
The most relevant study in this  context is probably the follow up of the UKPDS ( Holman RR, Paul SK, 
Bethel MA, Matthews  DR, Neil HA (2008)10-year follow-up of intensive glucose control in type 2 
diabetes.N Engl J Med).  In this study, differences in glycated hemoglobin levels between patients treated 
with  conventional and intensive treatment documented in the origina l study, were lost  after the first  year 
of follow up. In the sulfonylurea–insulin group, relative reductions in risk persisted at 10  years for any 
diabetes-related end point (9%,  P=0.04) and microvascular disease (24%, P=0.001),  and risk reductions 
for myocardial infarction (15%,  P=0.01) and death from any cause (13%,  P=0.007)  emerged over time.  
In the metformin group, significant risk reductions persisted for any diabetes -related end point  (21%, 
P=0.01),  myocardial infarction (33%,  P=0.005),  and death fro m any cause (27%, P=0.002).  This may 
indicate a sustained legacy effect of an initial intensive glucose -control strategy. The Steno-2 Study 
reported a similar outcome during a 5.5-year period after earlier multifactorial risk reduction among 
patients with  type 2 diabetes (Gaede P, Lund-Andersen H, Parving HH, Pedersen O. Effect of a 
multifactorial intervention on mortality in type 2 diabetes. N Engl JMed  2008 ). However, it can be 
questioned if these results also are of relevance for the current scenario con sidering that  the control 
group in the UPKDS was treated with  diet only and may therefore be at a higher risk of later events 
compared to “conventional therapy” in  the VERIFY study  (ie metformin monotherapy). With  respect to the 
Steno-2 trial, multifactorial interventions were used and it  may therefore be difficult to tease out the 
relevance of the legacy effect of reducing glucose. 
The long term importance of optimizing glycaemic control in patients  with type 2 diabetes has been well 
documented with respect to reduction of the risk of microvascular complications. However, the 
importance for the risk of macrovascular complications has been debated. In the ADVANCE trial ( The 
ADVANCE Collaborative Group (2008)  Intensive blood glucose control and vascular outco mes in patients 
with  type 2 diabetes. N  Engl J Med 358:2560–25728)  patients  randomized to intensive glucose control 
had a mean glycated hemoglobin level that  was 0.8% lower than that  in the standard -control group. They 
had a reduction in  major microvascular events of 14%  (95% confidence interval [CI], 3 to 33)  but a 
nonsignificant reduction in major macrovascular events of only 6%  (95% CI, −6 to 16)  after a median of 
5 years of follow-up. Also in the  ACCORD trial (The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes 
Study Group (2008)  Effects of intensive glucose lowering in type 2  diabetes. N  Engl J Med 358:2545 –
2559)  there was a nonsignificant reduction of 10% in the  composite primary outcome of nonfatal 
myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and death from cardiovascular causes among 10,251  patients  with 
type 2 diabetes who were assigned either to a group with a target glycated hemoglobin level of less than 
6.0% or to a group with a target level of 7.0  to 7.9%. In addition,  when the results of more recen t 
(positive) cardiovascular outcome trials have been analysed, it  has often been put  forward that  the 
benefit is not only based on the lowering of blood glucose. 
In conclusion, current knowledge cannot undisputedly support the clinical relevance of reducing blood 
glucose as fast as possible in newly diagnosed patients  with type 2 diabetes.  
Secondary efficacy results 
Key secondary endpoints 
Rate of loss of glycaemic control 
The rate of loss of glycaemic control, assessed by the annualised slope of HbA1c over time  from Week 26 
to end of Period 1, was carried out using a linear mixed effect model including  treatment  approach and 
region as factors, baseline HbA1c and time of HbA1c measurement as covariates and interaction of 
treatment approach by time. The model assesses the rate of loss of function as a mathematical estimate 
of annualised slope of HbA1c.

A reduction in rate of loss of glycaemic control, assessed by the  annualized slope of HbA1c over time from 
Week 26 to  end of Period 1,  was observed in the early combination group compared to the monotherapy 
group (for FAS: adjusted mean rate of change in  HbA1c per year: −0.02,  95% CI [−0.05,  0.00]; one -
sided p=0.042).  Similar results were observed for the  Per Protocol Set (PPS).  
Table 5 Analysis of rate of loss in glycaemic control during Period 1 (FAS and PPS) 
The slope of HbA1c deterioration from week 26  was slightly  lower for those receiving the combination 
therapy versus monotherapy, but the clinical relevance of the  magnitude of the  effect is difficult  to 
understand. In the opinion of the MAH,  the methodology used for the  analyses was not  optimal in a study 
design setting mandating  rescue medication and, therefore, not  applicable for assessment of loss of beta 
cell function. 
Analysis in HbA1c over time 
Graphical displays for HbA1c over time for Period 1 are presented in  Error! Reference source not 
found. (FAS).  Starting from similar baseline values, there was a  faster reduction in HbA1c values in 
patients in  the combination group compared to  patients  in the monotherapy group. Due to the study 
design, any graphical presentation of HbA1c values  per period will  display a ‘survivor population’ pattern 
as those without  a glycaemic response are rescued to  the next period.

EOS=end of study 
A descriptive analysis in HbA1C over time was performed; from baseline to end of period 1, as well as 
data collected during  the entire study (Figure 5). In the analysis on HbA1c data collected during  the 
entire study, HbA1c mean values were in the end of the study increased towards 7% in both  treatment 
groups and were less differentiated. 
Time to second treatment failure 
The time to secondary glycaemic failure (defined as two  consecutive HbA1c readings above or  equal to 
7.0%,  13 weeks apart, after confirmed initial treatment failure ) was assessed in a post-hoc analysis. The 
time to secondary failure defined the time to insulin  initiation  when all patients were receiving vildagliptin 
combination in Period 2. 
The relative risk for time to second treatment  failure by HbA1c threshold during Period 2 was significantly 
reduced by the early treatment combination strategy vs. monotherapy group (HR  [95% CI]: 0.74 [0.63, 
0.86],  p<0.0001).   
Kaplan-Meier estimates of the probability of second treatment failure (i.e. after Period 1 and up  to  end of  
Period 2) over time are graphically displayed in Figure 6.

Figure 6 KM plot for time to second treatment  failure (after  Period 1 and  up to Period 2) (FAS)  
Time to second treatment failure (defined as ≥7.0%  at two consecutive measurements, 13 weeks apart, 
after confirmed initial treatment  failure) was added as a post-hoc analysis and a protocol amendment to 
be included in the CSR. It  was questioned how to interpret data considering that  the study was not 
double-blind in this  part of the  study. The MAH  considered that  the results indicate that the  introduction 
of the early combination therapy provides unique benefits which  cannot be attained  after sequential 
introduction  of combination therapy after initial  metformin therapy failure. This needed to be further 
discussed and justified. Time to insulin  initiation  was analysed as an exploratory endpoint but 
(surprisingly) there was no difference between the combination and the monotherapy groups in time to 
insulin from Baseline (HR [95%CI]:  1.04 [0.81,  1.33]; p=0.759). 
Considering the  timing for the addition of time to second treatment failure as an endpoint, the MAH 
explained that  progression of HbA1c  from 26 weeks after the start of Period 2 to  the end of Period 2 was 
part of the protocol and reported in the CSR among the secondary obj ectives. While this is acknowledged, 
the corresponding variable to be analysed was defined in terms of rate of loss in glyc aemic control in 
HbA1c, i.e. not as a time-to-event endpoint which  was analysed post-hoc. It is therefore understood that 
both the  endpoint and its analysis were defined post-hoc, i.e. after the DBL. The MAH  has clarified that 
70% of patients in  the early combination group who had initial  treatment failure actually failed during 
period 2.  This makes sense since they did not get  any additional treatment in  period 2. The corresponding 
number in monotherapy group was 61%.  These groups are, however, not randomized, and comparison 
not straightforward. The main question is whether this prolongation of loss of glyc aemic control is of 
relevance for the risk of micro-and macro vascular complications.   
Exploratory efficacy results 
Change of β-cell function over time 
The β-cell function  assessed by homeostasis model assessment for the  β-cell (HOMA-B).  The results of 
the analysis of rate of change of ß-cell function over time (slope of AUC of ISR/G) in subjects in the meal-
test subset are summarized in Table 7. Overall, a significant reduction in the slope from Week 13  to end 
of study was observed among those (n=228)  individuals randomized to  receive early combination 
approach vs. those (n=227)  in the initial metformin group (slope difference: -0.58, 95%  CI: -0.99,  -0.17; 
p=0.006).  As expected, there was no difference in the adjusted mean rate of change (slope difference: -
0.08,  95% CI: -0.53, 0.38;  p=0.744)  between groups among patients with  a glycaemic response in 
Period 1. From Week 13  to end of Period 2, a statistically significant difference in the adjusted mean rate 
of change was observed (slope difference: -0.50,  95% CI: -0.91,  -0.09; p=0.017).

Change of insulin  sensitivity over time 
The results of the analysis of rate of change of insulin sensitivity over time (slope of OGIS) in  subjects in 
the meal-test subset are summarized in  Table 8. OGIS is an index of insulin sensitivity in dynamic 
conditions, which  predicts glucose clearance by a model-derived formula from the OGTT glucose and 
insulin concentrations. Statistically significant  differences between  the  combination group over those in 
the monotherapy in  the adjusted mean rate of change were  observed for all 3 treatment  periods: from 
Week 13 to  end of Period 1 (slope difference -5.03,  95% CI: -9.26, -0.79;  p=0.020),  end of Period 2 
(slope difference: -5.08, 95%  CI: -8.46,  -1.69;  p=0.003),  and to end of study (slope difference: -5.38, 
95% CI: -8.61,  -2.16; p=0.001).

Change in  body weight 
ANCOVA results for change from Baseline in body weight  are summarized in  Table 9. Initially, the  mean 
(SE) body weight  were 85.44  (0.57)  kg and 84.82  (0.54)  kg for the  combination and monotherapy 
groups, respectively. From Baseline to the  end of Period 1,  a  trend toward a decrease was observed in 
both treatment  groups; however, mean changes were  small (-0.32  kg in the combination group and -0.74 
kg in the monotherapy group)

There were minor reductions in body weight body in both treatment groups and a slightly larger reduction 
in the metformin monotherapy group compared with  the early treatment group; although not  statistically 
significant. 
Change in  HOMA-B from baseline to endpoint 
ANCOVA results for change in β-cell function assessed by HOMA-B. The mean (SE) baseline index values 
of HOMA-B were indicative of a relatively good basal beta cell functionality  in both treatment approach 
groups: 120.11 (3.49)  and 114.11  (3.20)  for those in the early combination and monotherapy groups, 
respectively. From Baseline to the end of Period 1, independent of the time to initial  treatment failure, an 
increase of 17.21 (9.04)  in HOMA-B value was observed in the combination group while the HOMA -B 
value decreased by 2.02  (9.02) among those receiving metformin monotherapy only. The difference in 
adjusted mean change from Baseline to end of Period 1 between the combination and the monotherapy 
group was statistically significant (difference: 19.23  (5.51),  95% CI: 8.42, 30.03;  p<0.001) .   
The HOMA-B value after a confirmed failure continuing  on the combination therapy from Baseline to end 
of Period 2: a mean increase of 10.66  (9.09) in HOMA-B  value was observed from Baseline until  end of 
Period 2. Similarly, addition of vildagliptin to the failing metformin monotherapy maintained  the  beta cell 
functionality in  Period 2 (mean change in HOMA -B value, 0.84 (8.99),  indicating  no further decline during 
this period). The difference in adjusted mean change from Baseline to end of Period 2 between the two 
treatment approaches was now diluted and did not reach statistical significance (difference: 9.83, 95% 
CI: -0.61, 20.26;  p=0.065).   
Change in β-cell function  was assessed by HOMA-B. The difference in mean change in HOMA -B was 
improved in the early combination group versus the metformin monotherapy group from baseline to end 
of period 1; however, the  difference between the  groups to the  end of period 2  and to  the end of the 
study, respectively, was not statistically significant. 
Change in  HOMA-IR from Baseline to endpoint 
The mean (SE) baseline index values of 6.19 (0.18)  and 5.97 (0.20)  for the early combination and initial 
metformin monotherapy treatment approach groups, respectively, indicated presence of early, clinically 
significant insulin  resistance in both groups at the time of diabetes diagnosis. From Baseline to  the end of 
Period 1, independent of the time to  initial treatment  failure, similar, incremental increases in insulin 
resistance were observed in both  treatment groups (adjusted mean index value change of 1.28 (0.44)  in 
the combination group and 1.23 (0.44)  in the monotherapy group, difference: 0.05,  95% CI: -0.47,  0.58; 
p=0.842).  Among those who initially received metformin monotherapy, the  mean adjusted increase in 
insulin resistance from Baseline to end of Period 2 was higher, HOMA-IR value of 1.84 (0.58)  vs 1.33 
(0.59)  among those in the  early combination treatment group while the difference between the gr oups 
did not reach statistical significance (difference: -0.51, 95%  CI: -1.19,  0.17;  p=0.142).  Overall, despite 
the differences in glycaemic outcomes, the HOMA-IR index values continued to increase in both treatment 
approach groups from Baseline to the  end of study; the mean adjusted change in 5 years was 2.10 (0.80) 
vs 2.17  (0.79)  for the early combination and initial  metformin groups, respectively (difference: -0.07, 
95% CI: -0.99,  0.85; p=0.887). 
Change in insulin resistance was assessed by HOMA-IR. The observed glycaemic durability in patients in 
the early treatment strategy group cannot be explained by any favourable changes in insulin  sensitivity 
as measured by HOMA-IR index. Overall, neither of the  treatment groups seem to be slowing down the 
incrementally progressive insulin resistance . 
Change in  total retinal micro-aneurysm count from Baseline to  selected visits 
In a subgroup of patients (n=162),  change in total  retinal micro -aneurysm count from Baseline to Year 4 
(Week 208  visit) and Year 5 (Week 260  visit) was assessed. ANCOVA results are  presented in Table 10.

Table 10 ANCOVA  results for change  in total  retinal micro -aneurysm count from baseline to 
selected visits by treatment  approach (FAS,  retinal micro-aneurysm count subset) 
Change in total retinal micro-aneurysm was assessed in a subgroup of patients  (n=162).  However, the 
number of patients  dropped and were few at year 4 (n=42)  and year 5 (n=45),  respectively, wherefore 
difficult  to draw any firm conclusions (not  statistically significant). 
Change from Baseline in FPG 
At all post-Baseline visits, decreases in FPGe were observed in the combination  group, whereas either no 
decrease or increases (especially in the later phase of Period 1) were observed in the monotherapy group.  
Consistent differences favoring combination therapy over monotherapy was observed  throughout  the 
entire Period 1. 
Absolute value and change from Baseline in FPG (mmol/L) by treatment approach and visit,  using data 
collected up to the end of Period 2 is graphically presented in Figure 7. The differences in change from 
Baseline during Period 2 when all patients  were now receiving vildagliptin  as well as up to end of study 
(Figure 8) were generally smaller than observed in Period 1.

Figure 8 Mean  FPG  (mmol/L) by treatment  approach and visit, on FPG data  collected up to the

Differences in change from baseline in FPG up to end of study (when comparing metformin and early 
added vildagliptin  versus metformin and later added vildagliptin)  were smaller than observed from 
baseline to end of period 1  (when comparing early combination treatment and metformin monotherapy). 
Overall, the preliminary results of all the exploratory efficacy analyses provide d some indicative support 
of maintained beta-cell function  and delayed loss of insulin sensitivity with  early combination 
intervention; however, the MAH  has clarified that  preliminary results of the exploratory analyses will 
require more refined and sophisticated methodology outside this CSR. As for example, it is claimed that a 
more detailed analysis of clinically relevant changes in beta cell functionality by iHOMA2  model are 
necessitated to  understand in the role of improved beta cell function.  
Health-related  quality of life assessments 
Change in EQ-5D score, a measure of quality of life, from baseline to  endpoint were generally small and 
not consistent  in both treatment groups, and there were no major differences between treatment groups 
in EQ-5D score at any time point.  
For Visual Analog Scale measurement, a trend toward an increase (improvement) was observed in both 
treatment groups; changes were generally small and were similar in both  treatment groups.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The VERIFY study was a double-blind, randomised trial conducted in treatment-naïve patients with  T2DM 
to evaluate the  glycaemic durability of the initiation  of an early combination of metformin and vildagliptin 
Assessment report  
EMA/402373/2021 
Page 35/54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(n=998)  against initial  standard-of-care metformin monotherapy (n=1,103)  followed by sequential 
addition of vildagliptin in  patients losing glycae mic control, during a 5-year treatment period.  
The mean duration of diabetes in the study population was 6.4 months.  Patients were treatment naïve or 
had received anti-diabetic medication cumulatively for not more than 3  months but not  received any 
antidiabetic treatment  within  3 months prior to  Visit 1. However, patients  who had initiated metformin 
within  1 month  prior to Visit 1 and took a total daily  dose of maximum 2000mg  metformin at Visit 1 could 
also be included. Approximately 40% of patients had previously used metformin.  
HbA1c at visit 1 should be ≥6.5%  and ≤7.5%.  It can be questioned if the total study population  was 
treatment naïve, but they still  represented a population for which the full  effect of metformin 
monotherapy had not been exhausted (i.e. a population not covered by the currently approved indication 
for vildagliptin). 
Statistical plan 
The planned analyses in general were found appropriate. For the primary analysis, patients who 
discontinued the study for any reason during  Period 1 were censored; however, it  is unclear how 
treatment discontinuations  and any rescue medications were handled. Sensitivity analyses on request, 
where treatment  discontinuations and rescue medication intake (if any) are censored or imputed as 
treatment failures, were supportive of the primary endpoint  results. 
The primary statistical hypothesis of superiority of the combination treatment versus metformin was 
tested on alpha level of 2.5% (1-sided). One-sided superiority tests are not  conventional for confirmatory 
trials but may be acceptable for the assessment of the study results. However, p -values from 2-sided 
tests are expected to  be presented in the SmPC, particularly when the test results are not  statistically 
compelling.     
Substantial changes have been made in the planned analyses concerning the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Two primary efficacy variables were initially planned: time to initial  treatment failure and rate of loss of 
glycaemic control over time. Definition of the initial  treatment failure had been changed during the course 
of the study. After study completion (and unclear if prior to  the database lock) the  statistical analysis plan 
was updated to remove the loss of glycaemic control as primary endpoint. These changes have been 
described in the submitted  documentation, but  without  a clear rationale. Considering that  the rate of loss 
of glycaemic control over time is not statistically significant,  it may be suspected that the  change of the 
primary endpoints was data driven and the study integrity  undermined. The MAH has assured that 
removal of the  loss of glycaemic control as primary endpoint  was not  data driven. The main arguments 
for the change were to focus on a clinically interpretable and  predictable measure, and, considering its 
clinical importance, to  enable a full alpha allocation initially . 
Time to second treatment failure has been added as a post-hoc endpoint in the CSR but was not 
mentioned in the final SAP nor in the amended protocol vers ion 4. It  is understood that  both the endpoint 
and its analysis were defined post-hoc. 
It was noted that  the primary efficacy analysis presented by HR has been interpreted in terms of relative 
risk, which  is not statistically correct. The interpretation  was reworded in the SmPC section 5.1. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study met its primary objective, to  demonstrate the superiority of early combination of  vildagliptin 
50mg bid and metformin over metformin monotherapy  by testing  the hypothesis that the  risk of 
confirmed initial  treatment failure (defined as HbA1c ≥ 7.0%  at two consecutive measurements) is lower 
with  the combination of vildagliptin and metformin compared to that  with metformin monotherapy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/402373/2021 
Page 36/54 
 
 
 
 
However, the  clinical relevance of this result is not obvious considering that  as soon as a patient  fails on 
metformin monotherapy, several other treatment  options are readily available, and in fact, at th e end of 
study, HbA1c was very similar in  the two study groups. The clinical relevance is also not  fully supported 
by literature data or by the recommendations from learned societies. 
To further assess the benefit of initial  combination compared to sequentially added vildagliptin an analysis 
of a second treatment failure was performed as a post hoc analyses in period 2  of the  study.  The RR for 
time to second treatment failure during  period 2 of the study was significantly reduced in the  combination 
treatment group compared with  the sequential metformin treatment;  HR 0.74  [95% CI 0.63, 0.86; 
p<0.001].  Thus, even if both  groups now were receiving the same treatment, patients  in the initial 
combination group had a longer time to treatment failure.  However, als o in this situation,  additional 
treatments are available which  was also reflected in the study with  the introduction  of insulin treatment  in 
patients with  second treatment  failure.  
Key secondary endpoints were rate of loss of glycaemic control, assessed by the annualized slope of 
HbA1c over time from week 26 to end of period 1, and change from baseline in HbA1c during the study.  
A slight reduction in rate of loss of glycaemic control (−0.02,  95% CI [−0.05,  0.00]; one-sided p=0.042) 
was observed in the  early combination group compared with  the monotherapy group, but  the clinical 
relevance is not  easily understood. The HbA1c values remained consistently lower in the combination 
group compared with the  monotherapy group up  to the end of period 1, but  as menti oned above, at end 
of study the results were rather similar in both  groups. 
The preliminary results of all the exploratory efficacy analyses provide d some indicative support of 
maintained beta-cell function and delayed loss of insulin  sensitivity with early combination intervention; 
however, the MAH  considers that  preliminary results of the exploratory analyses will require more refined 
and sophisticated methodology outside this  CSR.  
There were minor reductions in body weight body in both treatment groups and a slightly larger reduction 
in the metformin monotherapy group compared with  the early treatment group; although not  statistically 
significant. 
Change in total retinal micro-aneurysm count was assessed as an exploratory analysis in a s ubgroup of 
patients (n=162).  However, the number of patients  dropped and were few at year 4 (n=42)  and year 5 
(n=45),  respectively, wherefore difficult to draw any firm conclusions (not statistically significant).   
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The guidelines for management of hyperglycaemia in type II diabetes recommends metformin as first -line 
choice of therapy with sequential addition  of other oral antidiabetic drugs.  The VERIFY study has been 
performed with  the aim to  show that the  risk of initial treatment  failure is lower with  the combination  of 
vildagliptin and metformin compared to that  with  metformin monotherapy  in  a patient  population with 
newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. 
The VERIFY study met its  primary endpoint; the provided data show that  early combination therapy with 
metformin and vildagliptin was superior to metformin monotherapy with  regards to initial  treatment 
failure (defined as HbA1c ≥ 7.0% at  two consecutive analyses) in patients  with recent onset of diabetes 
with  mild hyperglycaemia. Also, the post hoc analyses time to second treatment failure was significantly 
reduced in the  early combination group compared with  metformin and sequentially added vildagliptin.   
Based on the results of this study, the MAH  has proposed to extend  the indication to include “initial 
combination of vildagliptin and metformin, when diabetes is not  adequately controlled by diet and 
exercise alone” in section 4.1. However, the clinical relevance of initial  combination therapy in patients 
with  newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes is not fully supported by literature data or by the recommendations 
Assessment report  
EMA/402373/2021 
Page 37/54 
 
 
 
 
from learned societies. Therefore the CHMP did not  agree to include “include initial  combination therapy” 
in section 4.1. of the SmPC. but agreed to reflect the results of the “VERIFY” in section 5.1. of the SmPC. 
The CHMP proposed wording was agreed by the MAH.  
The MAH also applied to  change the wording in  section 4.1.  of the SmPC with  regards to the use of 
vildagliptin in  combination with other glucose lowering agents i.e. to make a general cross-reference to 
section 5.1. of combination use instead of reflecting specific combinations in section 4.1.  This is in line 
with  the wording of other oral anti-diabetic drugs and has been agreed by the CHMP.   
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Subject exposure 
Mean exposure to study medication was similar in both  treatment groups (53.6  months in the   early 
combination therapy group and 52.4  months in the monotherapy group; median exposure was 59.8 
months for both arms) (Table 11). Also, for exposure categories for the entire study duration a similar 
pattern was observed in both treatment groups. 
The duration of Period 1 was significantly longer in patients  in the early combination therapy group (i.e., 
who remained at their initially  assigned treatment)  compared to patients in the monotherapy group  
(median duration 50.8 vs. 30.1 months,  respectively). Also , the proportion of patients who remained at 
their initial  therapy over the entire 5-year study duration was significantly higher in the early combination 
therapy group compared to the monotherapy group (≥57  months: 46.5%   vs 28.5%). 
About 81.3%  of patients  in the early combination therapy group and 78.5%  patients in the monotherapy 
group have completed the  entire 5-year study period. The median exposure was 59.8 months  in both 
groups. 
Total subject exposure 
For the entire study period, the exposure to study drug was  comparable (4456  subject years in the  early 
combination group and 4376 subject years in the  monotherapy group). For Period 1,  subject year 
exposure to study drug was higher in  the early  combination group than  in the monotherapy group (3453 
vs. 2724 subject years). 
Since patients  in the early combination group received vildagliptin from the start  of the  study, the higher 
subject year exposure over the entire study period for this  group is expected (4457  subject years vs.  
1631  subject years in the monotherapy group).

Adverse events 
Overview of adverse events during period 1-3 
The overall incidence of AEs over the  entire study was similar between the treatment groups  (83.5% in 
the early combination therapy group vs. 83.2%  in the monotherapy group,  respectively, see Table 12). 
All safety outcomes are presented by treatment approach (SAF) and no major differences between 
treatment groups was observed for any primary system organ class (SOC). Most  frequently reported 
preferred terms (PTs) were within  the SOCs Infections and infestations (48.8%  vs. 46.1%), 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (33.0% vs. 34.4%),  Gastrointestinal disorders (31.5% 
vs. 31.4%) and Nervous system disorders (25.6%  vs. 22.1%).

Table 12 Number (%)  of patients with AEs by primary system organ class and  
treatment  approach (SAF) Period: Treatment  period (Periods 1, 2 and 3)  
There were only minor differences between both  treatment groups for any preferred terms. The most 
frequently reported AEs (≥10%  in any group) were back pain, diarrh oea, hypertension, nasopharyngitis 
and arthralgia (Table  13).

Most  events were either assessed as mild or moderate. Severe  events were reported in  10.5% of patients 
in the early combination group and 10.6%  of patients  in the monotherapy group. 
Overall, no major difference between treatment groups was seen for any severe AEs. Severe  AEs within 
the SOC Cardiac disorders were slightly less frequent in  the early combination  group (0.9%, 9 patients) 
than in  the monotherapy group (2.3%, 23  patients); the difference was  not driven by any particular 
events, e.g., the  largest difference in this  SOC was seen for severe  myocardial infarction (0% vs 0.3%, 
corresponding to 0 and 3 patients).  Severe AEs within  the  SOC Nervous system disorders were slightly 
more frequent in the early combination group (1.9%,  19 patients) than  in the monotherapy group (1.2%, 
12 patients)  and severe events within the  SOC Gastrointestinal disorders were slightly  less frequent in the 
early combination group (0.6%, 6 patients)  than in the  monotherapy group (1.3%, 13 patients). 
Overview of adverse events during period 1 
During the study period 1  (when comparing a two-drug combination with  monotherapy); however, the 
incidence of adverse events was slightly increased for the early combination group compared with the 
monotherapy group: AEs 74% vs 68%  and SAEs 14% vs 12%; SOC Infections and infestations (42%  vs. 
34%),  SOC Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (28% vs. 24%), SOC Gastrointestinal 
disorders (23% vs. 20%) and SOC Nervous system disorders (20%  vs. 16%).  The number of 
hypoglycaemic events was 12 (1.2%)  in the combination group and 7 patients (0.7%)  in the 
monotherapy group.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Twenty-two  deaths were reported during this  study (13 in the early combination gr oup vs. 9 in the 
monotherapy group). None of the deaths were considered related to the study drugs. Most of the AEs 
related to  the main reason of death were reported in single or very few patients,  and no noteworthy 
difference between treatment groups were observed for any preferred terms. 
Serious adverse events 
SAEs over the entire study period were numerically less frequently reported in  the early combination 
group (16.6%,  166 patients) compared to the  monotherapy group (18.3%, 183  patients). Differences 
between treatment groups were generally small for any SAEs. The largest difference was observed for 
pneumonia (1.4% of patients in the  early combination therapy group vs. 0.5%  in the monotherapy group, 
corresponding to 14 vs. 5 patients).  Most SAEs were re ported in single patients  only. 
Adverse events  of special interest 
Hypoglycaemic events 
The incidence of hypoglycaemic events during the entire study period was low and similar  between 
treatment groups (13 in the  early combination therapy group vs. 9 in  the monotherapy group, see Table 
14). The events were mostly mild  in nature, and all of them were of grade  1. Most events were not 
suspected to be related to the study drug(s). Also, for other features related to hypoglycaemic events 
(e.g. precipitating events, time of the event in  relation to  last meal, dose and daytime) an overall 
comparable pattern was noted in both treatment  groups. Most  of the  hypoglycaemic events occurred in 
Period 1 (12  in the early combination group and 7 in the monotherapy group). During Period 2, only one 
hypoglycaemic event was reported which occurred in  the monotherapy group and the  remaining events 
occurred during Period 3 when insulin  was introduced. 
Table 14 Number of hypoglycaemic events  during the  treatment  period by event  profile and 
treatment  approach (SAF) Period: Treatment  period (Periods 1, 2 and 3)  
Most  of the  patients reporting hypoglycaemic events during the entire treatment period (11  in the early 
combination therapy group vs. 6 in the monotherapy group) experienced one event only (9  patients in 
the early combination therapy group and 4 patients  in the monotherapy group,  see Table 15).  There 
were no discontinuations  due to hypoglycaemic events, and no grade 2 or suspected grade 2 events were 
reported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/402373/2021 
Page 42/54 
 
 
 
 
 
During Period 1, 12 hypoglycaemic events were reported in 10 patients  in the early combination group 
and 7 events in  4 patients in the monotherapy group. During Period 2, only one patient in the 
monotherapy group experienced a hypoglycaemic event. 
Table 15 Number of patients experiencing  hypoglycaemic events  during the  treatment  period 
by event  profile and treatment  approach (SAF) Period: Treatment  period (Periods 1, 2 and  3) 
Severe hypoglycaemic events in Period 1  were reported in one patient in  the early combination  group. 
In the early combination group 27 asymptomatic low blood glucose occurrences were reported, and 10 in 
the monotherapy group. For most events no action was taken (for 81.5% and 90.0%  of low  blood glucose 
occurrences in the early combination and the monotherapy groups, r espectively) and no relationship to 
study drug was suspected (85.2%  and 100% of low blood glucose occurrences in the early  combination 
and the monotherapy groups, respectively). 
Asymptomatic low  blood glucose occurrences were reported in 6 patients in  the  early combination group 
and in 3 patients in  the monotherapy group during the entire study period,  corresponding to  0.6% and 
0.3% of patients,  respectively. No patients  discontinued study due to low blood glucose occurrences. 
During Period 1, asymptomatic low blood glucose occurrences were reported in 4 patients  in the early 
combination group and in 1 patient in  the monotherapy, and in Period 2 in one patient  in either treatment 
group. 
Microvascular and macrovascular complications 
Any microvascular or macrovascular complications during the treatment  period by treatment approach 
were reported in a comparable proportion of patients in both treatment  groups (30.5%   of patients in the 
early combination group, and 33.1% of patients in  the monotherapy group  Table 16). Most  frequently 
reported (in  ≥ 2% of patients) were hypertension (10.5%  in the early combination and 12.8% of patients 
in the monotherapy group), progression to  renal insufficiency, defined as eGFR<60mL/min/1.73m2  (6.9% 
and 7.3%) and diabetic neuropathy (3.0% and 3.0%,  respectively). 
Over the 5-year study duration,  a numerical reduction in the risk of time to first  adjudicated 
macrovascular event was seen with  the early combination treatment approach vs. initial monotherapy 
(hazard ratio 0.71;  95% CI [0.42,  1.19], statistical  significance at the  one-sided 2.5% level p=0.097) 
(Figure 9. The adjudicated first macrovascular events occurred in 2.4%  vs. 3.3%  of patients  in the early  
combination treatment and monotherapy groups (post-hoc analyses, data on file).

As part of safety surveillance, cardiovascular events were monitored and adjudicated in the VERIFY 
study; however, the study was not  powered to assess differences in cardiovascular events . A reduction in 
the risk of time to  first adjudicated macrovascular event was seen with  the early combination treatment 
approach vs. monotherapy (HR 0.71;  95% CI [0.42, 1.19]).  Adjudicated first macrovascular events was 
numerically lower in the early combination vs the monotherapy group s [2.4% vs. 3.3% of patients]; 
however, the low cumulative number of recurrent events must be considered, and no firm conclusions 
can be made from these results. 
Laboratory findings 
No major or consistent changes or clinically relevant differences between treatment groups were  reported 
for any haematology, clinical chemistry including liver enzymes, urinalysis, vital signs, body weight  and 
ECG findings.

Safety in special populations 
The overall incidence of AEs was comparable between the early combination and the monotherapy gr oup 
for all age subgroups (<48  years: 83.6% vs. 80.5%,  respectively; 48 to <62 years: 82.1%  vs. 84.1%;  ≥ 
62 years: 86.0%  vs. 83.7%). 
AEs within  the SOC Cardiac disorders were more frequently reported in older patients,  as to be  expected, 
and were comparable between the early combination and the monotherapy group within  each age 
category (<48  years: (5.0% vs. 5.9%, respectively; 48 to <62  years: 11.3% vs. 10.8%; ≥  62 years: 
13.6%  vs. 14.7%).  For other SOC or specific PTs no consistent age -related trend was observed, and 
differences between treatment groups were overall comparable within age category. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Also, AEs leading to study drug discontinuation  over the entire study period were slightly  less frequently 
reported in the  early combination group (4.1%,  41 patients)  compared to the monotherapy group (5.3%, 
53 patients).  Differences between treatment groups were small for any preferred terms, and most AEs 
leading to discontinuation  were reported in single patients  only.

(Periods 1, 2 and 3) 
Adverse events leading to  dose adjustment and/or interruption 
The incidence of adverse events requiring dose adjustment or study drug interruption during the  entire 
treatment was balanced between the early combination group (13.9%)  and the  monotherapy group 
(13.1%).  Differences between treatment groups were generally small for any preferred terms, and most 
were reported in single or few patients only. Differences of 0.5%  or more were observed for myocardial 
infarction (0% vs. 0.5% in  the early combination and monotherapy group, 0 and 5  patients, respectively) 
gastritis (0.9%  vs. 0.4%,  9 and 4 patients),  asthenia (0.7%  vs. 0.2%, 7 and 2 patients),  dizziness (0.7% 
vs. 0.1%, 7 and 1 patients). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall (including study period 1-3), the  safety outcome for the early combination group versus the 
monotherapy group was similar with  regards to AEs (84% vs 83%) and SAEs (16%  vs 18%).  Most 
frequently reported AEs were within  the SOC Infections and infestations (4 9%  vs. 46%),  SOC 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (33% vs. 34%), SOC Gastrointestinal disorders (32% vs. 
31%) and SOC Nervous system disorders (26%  vs. 22%)  for the  early combination treatment therapy 
versus the monotherapy group. The number of hypoglycaemic events was 13 (1.3%)  in the early 
Assessment report

combination group and 9 patients (0.9%)  in the monotherapy group. All hypoglycaemic evens were mild 
(grade 1).   
The incidence of subjects experiencing any microvascular or macrovascular complications was 30%  and 
33% for early combination and monotherapy group, respectively. Most frequently reported (in ≥ 2% of 
patients) were hypertension (10.5%  in the early combination and 12.8%  of patients  in the monotherapy 
group), progression to renal insufficiency, defined as eGFR<60mL/min/1.73m2  (6.9%  and 7.3%) and 
diabetic neuropathy (3.0%  and 3.0%, respectively). The study was not powered to assess differences in 
cardiovascular events. Post-hoc analyses of showed a numerical reduction in the risk of time to  first 
adjudicated macrovascular event for the early combination treatment approach vs. initial monotherapy 
(HR 0.71;  95% CI [0.42,  1.19]; however, the  low cumulative number recurrent events must be 
considered, and no firm conclusions can be made from these results . 
During the study period 1  (when comparing a two-drug combination with  monotherapy); however, the 
incidence of adverse events was slightly increased for the early combination group compared with the 
monotherapy group: AEs 74% vs 68%  and SAEs 14% vs 12%; SOC Infections and infestations (42%  vs. 
34%),  SOC Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (28% vs. 24%), SOC Gastrointestinal 
disorders (23% vs. 20%) and SOC Nervous system disorders (20%  vs. 16%).  The number of 
hypoglycaemic events was 12 (1.2%)  in the combination group and 7 patients (0.7%)  in the 
monotherapy group.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile for the entire study period was similar for the  early metformin/vildagliptin combination 
treatment group and for the  metformin monotherapy group (followed by sequential addition  of 
vildagliptin).  No new or unexpected signal was identified.  However, during period 1,  the incidences of 
adverse events were, as expected, slightly increased in the  combination group compared with  the 
metformin monotherapy group since a two-drug combination,  as opposed to  monotherapy, will normally 
result in additional adverse events. The incidence of microvascular or macrovascular complications was 
balanced between the groups.  Most frequently reported were hypertension, progression to renal 
insufficiency (<60mL/min/1.73m2)  and diabetic neuropathy. The study was not  powered to assess 
differences in cardiovascular events. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this med icinal product are set out in 
the list  of Union  reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7)  of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web -portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The WSA did not  submit an updated RMP version with  this application. It was considered based on the 
data submitted in  the application there is no need for an update of the RMP.  
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication  wording, sections 4.1,  4.4, 4.5,  5.1 and 6.6 of the SmPC have 
been updated.  Particularly, VERIFY study data (on initial combination of vildagliptin with  metformin) and a 
warning with  regard to drugs that  inhibit renal transporter (OCT2/MATE  inhibitors) and corresponding 
update in drug interactions has been added. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly , and

changes made to bring the PI it in line with  the QRD v10.1 template. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification  for not  performing a full  user consultation  with target patient  groups on the  package 
leaflet has been submitted by the WSA. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do 
not require user consultation with  target patient  groups . 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Due to  the pathophysiology of the disease, the majority of T2DM  patients require more treatment  as the 
disease progresses and beta-cell function declines over time. The guidelines for management of 
hyperglycaemia in type II diabetes recommends metformin as  first-line choice of therapy with  sequential 
addition of other oral antidiabetic  drugs. The VERIFY study submitted in  the current variation, has been 
performed with  the aim to  show that the  risk of initial treatment  failure is lower with  the combination  of 
vildagliptin and metformin compared to that  with  metformin monotherapy  in  a patient  population with 
newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Based on the  results of this  study, the MAH  has proposed to extend the 
indication for vildagliptin containing  products to  include “initial combination of vildagliptin  and metformin, 
when diabetes is not adequately controlled by diet  and exercise alone”.  
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
The VERIFY study was designed to investigate early combination therapy of  vildagliptin and metformin 
with  metformin monotherapy, and subsequent, sequential addition  of vildagliptin,  in treatment-naïve 
patients with  type 2 diabetes mellitus, aged 18-70  year. The primary objective was to demonstrate the 
superiority of early combination of vildagliptin and metformin over metformin monotherapy in treatment-
naïve patients  with T2DM  by testing  the hypothesis that the  risk of confirme d initial  treatment failure 
(defined as HbA1c ≥  7.0% at two  consecutive measurements) was lower with  the combination of 
vildagliptin and metformin compared to that  with  metformin monotherapy. 
The study was a multi-centre,  double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm, parallel group study with  a run-in 
period and up to  5 years treatment period. The study was split into  3 periods. After a 3-week run-in 
period, patients  were randomised 1:1  to metformin and vildagliptin  (n=998)  or metformin and placebo 
(n=1,003)  and entered the  study period 1. The duration of period 1 could differ between patients 
depending on the time when the second of two  HbA1c measurements, taken at  two consecutive visits 
after randomization, confirmed HbA1c ≥ 7.0%, i.e. when primary goal was met. At that  point, patients 
entered period 2 of the study. In period 2, patients  who were randomized to  placebo and metformin in 
period 1 received vildagliptin and continued with  metformin. Patients who were randomized to the early 
combination vildagliptin and metformin in period 1 continued with  this treatment.  If a second treatment 
failure was documented in period 2,  patients entered period 3, in which  patients were initiated  to open-
label insulin.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
A significant reduction in the RR for time  to initial treatment  failure was observed in the early combination 
treatment group compared with  the monotherapy group (HR 0.51  [95% CI 0.45–0.58];  p<0.001).  The 
median observed time to treatment  failure in the  monotherapy group was 36.1  months, while the median 
treatment failure time for those receiving early combination therapy could only be estimated to be 
beyond the study  duration at 61.9 months.   
The second treatment failure, during the second phase of study, was also significantly reduced in the 
early combination group compared with metformin and sequentially added vildagliptin  (HR  0.74 [95%  CI 
0.63,  0.86; p<0.001). 
Glycaemic control, assessed by the annualized slope of HbA1c over time from week 26 to end of period 1 
deteriorated slightly  more slowly in  the early combination treatment group than in the  monotherapy 
group, although not  statistically significant (−0.02,  95%  CI [−0.05,  0.00];  one-sided p=0.042). 
Descriptive analysis demonstrated that HbA1C, up  to the end of period 1, was consistently lower with  the 
early combination treatment approach versus monotherapy. At end of study, the difference in  HbA1c 
between the groups was small. 
The preliminary results of all the exploratory efficacy analyses provide d some indicative support of 
maintained beta-cell function and delayed loss of insulin  sensitivity with early combination intervention .  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The clinical relevance of reaching glycaemic control faster (ie the results of the primary endpoint)  is not 
fully supported by available data. 
The analysis of time to 2nd treatment  failure, compared the strategy of metformin monotherapy and 
sequentially added vildagliptin with  an early combination therapy strategy. This analysis was added a 
post-hoc analysis a but could still  be to  some extent be considered as supportive.  
The MAH has provided an acceptable rationale for the change of the primary endpoints and has confirmed 
that  the decision was not  data driven. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall (including study period 1-3), the  safety outcome for the early combination group versus the 
monotherapy group was similar with  regards to AEs (84% vs 83%) and SAEs (16%  vs 18%).  Most 
frequently reported AEs were within  the SOC Infections and infestations (4 9%  vs. 46%),  SOC 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (33% vs. 34%),  SOC Gastrointestinal disorders (32% vs. 
31%) and SOC Nervous system disorders (26%  vs. 22%)  for the  early combination treatment therapy 
versus the monotherapy group. The number of hypoglycaemic events was 13 (1.3%)  in the early 
combination group and 9 patients (0.9%)  in the monotherapy group. All hypoglycaemic evens were mild 
(grade 1).   
The incidence of subjects experiencing any microvascular or macrovascular complications was 30%  and 
33% for early combination and monotherapy group, respectively. Most frequently reported (in ≥ 2% of 
patients) were hypertension (10.5%  in the early combination and 12.8%  of patients  in the monotherapy 
group), progression to renal insufficiency, defined as eGFR<60mL/min/1.73m2  (6.9%  and 7.3%) and 
diabetic neuropathy (3.0%  and 3.0%, respectively). The study was not powered to assess differences in 
cardiovascular events. Post-hoc analyses of showed a numerical reduction in the risk of time to  first 
adjudicated macrovascular event for the early combination treatment approach vs. initial monotherapy

(HR 0.71;  95% CI [0.42,  1.19]; however, the  low cumulative number recurrent events must be 
considered, and no firm conclusions can be made from these results . 
During the study period 1  (when comparing a two-drug combination with  monotherapy) the  incidence of 
adverse events was slightly increased for the  early combination group compared with  the monotherapy 
group: AEs 74%  vs 68%  and SAEs 14% vs 12%; SOC Infections and infestations (42%  vs. 34%),  SOC 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (28% vs. 24%), SOC Gastrointestinal disorders (23% vs. 
20%) and SOC Nervous system disorders (20%  vs. 16%).  The number of hypoglycaemic events was 12 
(1.2%)  in the combination group and 7 patients (0.7%)  in the monotherapy group.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The guidelines for management of hyperglycaemia in type II diabetes recommends metformin as first -line 
choice of therapy with sequential addition  of other oral antidia betic drugs.  
In this variation, the results from the  VERIFY study has been submitted.  This study had the aim to 
investigate if there is a benefit of initiating  treatment with  two  drugs simultaneously compared to 
metformin monotherapy in patients with  newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. The study  met its primary 
objective, to demonstrate the superiority of early combination of  vildagliptin 50mg  bid and metformin 
over metformin monotherapy  by testing  the hypothesis that  the risk of confirm ed initial  treatment failure 
(defined as HbA1c ≥  7.0% at two  consecutive measurements) is lower with  the combination of 
vildagliptin and metformin compared to that  with  metformin monotherapy.  
However, the  clinical relevance of this result can be questioned considering that as  soon as a patient fails 
on metformin monotherapy, several other treatment  options are readily available.  The benefit of a longer 
time to failure, as was seen in the combination group is not obvious, and in fact, at  the end of study 
(month  60), HbA1c was very similar in the  two study groups. Even it  its acknowledged that  the study 
may not  have had the power to  show differences in diabetic complications, the incidences of these events 
did not differ between study groups. 
To further assess the benefit of initial  combination compared to sequentially added vildagliptin,  an 
analysis of a second treatment failure was performed in period 2 of the study.  The RR for time to second 
treatment failure during period 2 of the study was significantly reduced in the   combination treatment 
group compared with the  sequential metformin treatment.  Thus, even if both groups now were receiving 
the same treatment,  patients in the  initial combination group had a longer time to treatment  failure.  
However, also in this  situation, additional treatments  are available which was also reflected in  the study 
with  the introduction  of insulin  treatment in patients  with second treatment failure.   
It is acknowledged that  the clinical relevance of the results  of the VERIFY study  cannot be further justified 
based on data from the study itself; potential support must  be derived from published literature. The 
results of the follow up of the UPKDS study are considered as the strongest support for long term benefit 
of early intensive treatment  of patients  with  type 2 diabetes indicating a reduced risk of both  micro -and 
macrovascular complications. It could also be considered that  it makes a lot of sense that  early intensive 
treatment of patients who have not yet developed complications could be of high er benefit compared to 
patients who have already developed e .g. diabetic retinopathy.  
However, the  UKPDS data are rather old and the relevance of the  result in the context of current 
treatment recommendations can be questioned. In addition,  the long term importance of optimizing 
glycaemic control in patients with  type 2 diabetes for the  reduction of risk of macrovascular 
complications has been debated both  in the context of older, large prospective trials (the ADVANCE and 
ACCORD trials) as well as in the context of more recent (positive) cardiovascular outcome trials for which 
it has often been put forward that  the benefit is not  only based the lowering of blood glucose.  
Thus, it  is considered that  current knowledge cannot undisputedly support the  clinical  relevance of 
reducing blood glucose as fast as possible in newly diagnosed patients with  type 2  diabetes, even though 
the hypothesis that  this could reduce at least the risk of microvascular complications seem plausible.  
Current EU regulatory therapeutic indications for products for the  treatment of type 2 diabetes largely 
follow the treatment algorithms recommended by learned societies. The results of the  VERIFY study has 
been acknowledged by the European Association of Study of Diabetes (EASD) (Buse JB, Diabetologia, 
2019)  and it is suggested that “providers should engage in  shared decision making around initial 
Assessment report

combination therapy in  new onset cases of type 2 diabetes”. However, early combination is not 
recommended as first line therapy until more knowledge is available. 
The safety profile for the entire study period was similar for the  early metformin/vildagliptin combination 
treatment group and for the  metformin monotherapy group (followed by sequential addition  of 
vildagliptin).  No new or unexpected signal was identified.  However, during period 1,  the incidences of 
adverse events were, as expected, slightly increased in the  combination group compared with  the 
metformin monotherapy group since a two-drug combination,  as opposed to  monotherapy, will normally 
result in additional adverse events. The incidence of microvascular or macrovascular complications was 
balanced between the groups.  Most frequently reported were hypertension, progression to renal 
insufficiency (<60mL/min/1.73m2)  and diabetic neuropathy. The study was not  powered to assess 
differences in cardiovascular events. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Current knowledge cannot undisputedly support the  clinical relevance of  using initial combination 
treatment and reducing blood glucose as fast as possible in  newly diagnosed patients with  type 2 
diabetes, and initial  combination treatment is currently not recommended in the treatment algorithms 
from learned societies. Therefore, proposed inclusion of study results from the finalised VERIFY study in 
section 5.1 is accepted while  further change proposed in section 4.1 to  extend the indication  to include 
“initial  combination of vildagliptin and metformin, when diabetes is not adequately controlled by diet and 
exercise alone” is not recommended. The MAH agreed.  
The MAH also applied to  change the wording in  section 4.1.  of the SmPC with  regards to the use of 
vildagliptin in  combination with other glucose lowering agents i.e. to make a general cross -reference to 
section 5.1. of combination use instead of reflecting specific combinations in section 4.1.  This is in  line 
with  the wording of other oral anti-diabetic drugs and has been agreed by the CHMP.  The final agreed 
wording for section 4.1.  was as follows; 
Eucreas is indicated as an adjunct  to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults  with type  2 
diabetes mellitus: 
• 
• 
in patients  who are inadequately controlled with  metformin hydrochloride alone.  
in patients  who are already being treated with  the combination of vildagliptin and metformin 
hydrochloride, as separate tablets. 
in combination with  other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes, including insulin,  when these 
do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see sections  4.4,  4.5 and 5.1 for available data on different 
combinations). 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Eucreas, Icandra, Zomarist is positive.

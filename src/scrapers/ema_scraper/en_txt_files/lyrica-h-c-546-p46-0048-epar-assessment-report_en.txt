Introduction 
In the European Union (EU), Lyrica is approved for the treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic 
pain  in  adults,  as  adjunctive  therapy  in  adults  with  partial  seizures  with  or  without  secondary 
generalization,  and  for  the  treatment  of  Generalised  Anxiety  Disorder  in  adults.  Pregabalin  is  not 
approved for the treatment in paediatrics and for the treatment of fibromyalgia in the EU for any age 
category.  In the United States (US), Lyrica  is approved for fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain associated 
with  diabetic  peripheral  neuropathy  and  spinal  cord  injury,  post  herpetic  neuralgia,  and  adjunctive 
therapy for adult patients with partial onset seizures. In Japan, Lyrica is approved for neuropathic pain 
and fibromyalgia. 
The application for the indication fibromyalgia in adults was refused by the CHMP in 2009 due to the 
following reasons: 
 
the short-term efficacy of Lyrica in the claimed indication, treatment of fibromyalgia in adults 
experiencing  moderate  to  severe  pain,  has  not  been  sufficiently  demonstrated  since  no 
consistent  and  clinically  relevant  benefit  for  patients  has  been  shown  in  pain  and  functional 
improvement; 
 
the maintenance of effect has not been convincingly demonstrated;  
 
the efficacy and safety of Lyrica in a representative EU-population with fibromyalgia have not 
been demonstrated. The US population cannot be extrapolated to the EU population taking into 
account the differences in practices, consistency in phenotypes and results;  
 
the  known  adverse  events  and  doubtful  clinical  relevance  of  the  effect  size  observed  renders 
the overall benefit/risk negative;  
On the 17th of June 2015, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Lyrica in adolescents, in 
accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as  amended.  A  short  critical  expert 
overview  has  also  been  provided.  Study  A0081180  is  titled  “A  15  week,  randomized,  double  blind, 
parallel-group, placebo controlled, flexible-dose, safety and efficacy study of pregabalin in adolescents 
(12-17 years old) with fibromyalgia” was provided. This study was conducted to fulfil the US Food and 
Drug  Administration  (FDA)  requirements  for  a  safety  and  efficacy  study  in  adolescent  fibromyalgia 
patients (12-17 years old; NDA 21-  446/S-010) given at the time of approval of  the  management of 
fibromyalgia indication on 21 June 2007. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  stated  that  study  A0081180  titled  “A  15  week,  randomized,  double  blind,  parallel-group, 
placebo  controlled,  flexible-dose,  safety  and  efficacy  study  of  pregabalin  in  adolescents  (12-17  years 
old)  with  fibromyalgia”  is  part  of  the  clinical  post-marketing  development  program.  The  study  was 
conducted to fulfil the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements for a safety and efficacy

study in adolescent fibromyalgia patients. The plasma concentration data obtained in study A0081180 
were used for population PK modelling (report PMAR-EQDD-A008h-DP4-415). 
The MAH does not propose any changes to the product information based on this study. The study is 
briefly described in the sections below, with limited commentary from the Rapporteur. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Lyrica capsules were used, which is a suitable formulation for adolescents. 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
Pregabalin  (Lyrica)  is  an  α2-δ  ligand  that  binds  with  high  affinity  to  the  auxiliary  subunit  of  voltage-
gated calcium channel in central nervous system tissues. Pregabalin has been developed clinically for 
neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, anxiety, and epilepsy. 
Pregabalin  PK  has  been  studied  before  in  healthy  adults  and  in  adult  subjects  with  partial  seizures, 
neuropathic pain,  fibromyalgia, generalized  anxiety  disorder and impaired renal function.  In  addition, 
the PK of pregabalin was evaluated in paediatric subjects 1 month to 16 years of age. The information 
below is included in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
Absorption 
Pregabalin is rapidly absorbed when administered in the fasted state, with peak plasma concentrations 
occurring within 1 hour following both single and multiple dose administration (tmax ranges between 0.5 
to  1.5  hours).  Pregabalin  oral  bioavailability  is  estimated  to  be  90%  and  is  independent  of  dose. 
Administration  of  pregabalin  with  food  has  no  clinically  significant  effect  on  the  extent  of  pregabalin 
absorption.  Following  repeated  administration,  steady  state  is  achieved  within  24  to  48  hours  and 
multiple-dose PK can be predicted from single-dose data. Pregabalin pharmacokinetics are linear over 
the recommended daily dose  range (75 to 900 mg/day). Inter-subject pharmacokinetic variability for 
pregabalin  is  low  (<20%).  Gender  does  not  have  a  clinically  significant  influence  on  the  plasma 
concentrations of pregabalin. 
Distribution 
The  apparent  volume  of  distribution  of  pregabalin  following  oral  administration  is  approximately 
0.56 L/kg.  Pre-clinical  studies  indicate  that  pregabalin  is  able  to  pass  the  blood  brain  barrier. 
Pregabalin is not bound to plasma proteins. 
Biotransformation 
Pregabalin undergoes negligible metabolism in humans. In pre-clinical studies, there was no indication 
of racemisation of pregabalin S-enantiomer to the R-enantiomer. 
Elimination 
Pregabalin is eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal excretion as unchanged drug. 
Pregabalin  mean  elimination  half-life  is  6.3  hours  in  subjects  with  normal  renal  function.  Pregabalin 
elimination is essentially proportional to creatinine clearance (CLcr).

Paediatric population 
The PK, safety, and tolerability of pregabalin were evaluated in paediatric subjects 1 month to 16 years 
of  age  with  partial  onset  seizures  in  the  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  Phase  1  study  A0081074. 
Dose  levels  of  2.5,  5.0,  10.0,  and  15.0  mg/kg/day  (given  in  equally  divided  doses  twice  daily)  were 
administered  for  8  days.  Single  and  multiple  dose  PK  were  evaluated.  Pregabalin  peak  concentration 
and  AUC  increased  linearly  with  increasing  dose  (2.5,  5.0,  10.0  and  15.0  mg/kg/day)  for  each  age 
group  (1  month  to  23  months,  2  to  6  years,  7  to  11  years,  and  12  to  16  years).  The  PK  data  in 
children aged 12 to 16 years from study A0081074 versus adults (study 1008-002) are summarised in

1.3.2.  Clinical study A0081180 
Description 
Clinical study A0081180 is a 15-week, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-
controlled  study  consisted  of  4  phases:  screening/baseline  (1  week),  dose  optimization  (3  weeks), 
fixed dose (12 weeks) and follow-up/taper (1 week). 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The  primary  objective  of  study  A0081180  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  pregabalin  (75-
450 mg/day) compared with placebo in an adolescent fibromyalgia population. The secondary objective 
was  to  evaluate  the  pharmacokinetics  of  pregabalin  in  an  adolescent  fibromyalgia  population.  The 
pharmacokinetics  obtained  in  study  A0081180  were  used  for  population  pharmacokinetics  of 
pregabalin in adolescent patients with fibromyalgia an provided in report PMAR-EQDD-A008h-DP4-415.

Other objectives were to collect data that will help characterize the adolescent fibromyalgia population 
and facilitate future clinical studies. 
Pregabalin  300  to  450  mg/day  (~5  to  7.5  mg/kg  bw/day  based  on  a  body  weight  of  60  kg)  is  the 
recommended  daily  dose  range  for  fibromyalgia  in  adults.  These  daily  doses  were  planned  as  the 
maximum doses for this adolescent study population. In addition, doses of 75 mg/day and 150 mg/day 
were also included to allow for smaller, low-weight adolescents, who may have enrolled in the study. 
GCP 
During  study  conduct,  Pfizer  or  its  representative  conducted  periodic  monitoring  visits  to  ensure  that 
the  protocol  and  GCPs  were  followed.  The  monitors  reviewed  source  documents  to  confirm  that  the 
data recorded on the CRFs were accurate. The investigator and institution allowed Pfizer monitors or its 
representative  and  appropriate  regulatory  authorities  direct  access  to  source  documents  in  order  to 
perform these verifications. 
No  centre  inspections  were  conducted  by  the  FDA  or  any  IRB\IEC.  Centre  audits  were  performed  by 
Pfizer  at  Centres  1002,  1003,  1007,  1017,  1022,  1033,  1037,  1047,  1058  and  1064.  There  were  no 
audit certificates issued. Two centre terminations (USA centre 1016 and Indian centre 1037) occurred 
due to noncompliance issues and per recommendation of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee 
(IDMC). 
Study population 
The  study  population  consisted  of  male  and  female  subjects  of  any  race  and  12-17  years  of  age, 
inclusive.  Subjects  must  have  met  the  Yunus  and  Masi  criteria  for  fibromyalgia:  generalized 
musculoskeletal aching at  ≥3 sites for  ≥3 months,  ≥5  tender  points, and  ≥3  of the  following 10  minor 
criteria  had  to  be  present:  chronic  anxiety  or  tension,  fatigue,  non-restorative  sleep,  chronic 
headaches,  irritable  bowel  syndrome,  subjective  soft  tissue  swelling,  numbness,  pain  modulation  by 
physical activities, pain modulation by weather factors, and pain modulation by anxiety or stress. 
Study design 
Study  consisted  of  4  phases:  screening/baseline  (1  week),  dose  optimization  (3  weeks),  fixed  dose 
(12 weeks) and follow-up/taper (1 week) (see Figure below). The first subject was enrolled on 07 May 
2010, and the last subject’s last visit was on 08 December 2014.

At Visit 1, subjects were to sign informed consent and be screened for eligibility. In addition, subjects 
were to be given a pain and quality of  sleep diary  which they were instructed to complete on a daily 
basis in the afternoon or evening. At Visit 2, at least 4 pain diaries were to be completed satisfactorily 
within the last 7 days and the average pain score had to be ≥4. In addition, laboratory and ECG results 
from Visit 1 were to be assessed for eligibility. Subjects were to initiate dosing at 75 mg/day and have 
their dose optimized (75-450 mg) over a 3 week period. The doses were administered as follows: 
 
 
 
 
Pregabalin 75 mg/day (25 mg morning and 50 mg evening) or placebo 
Pregabalin 150 mg/day (75 mg BID) or placebo 
Pregabalin 300 mg/day (150 mg BID) or placebo 
Pregabalin 450 mg/day (225 mg BID) or placebo 
After this 3 week optimization period, subjects were to remain at the optimized dose for 12 weeks with 
no  further  dose  adjustment  allowed.  At  the  end  of  the  12  week  period,  subjects  were  to  taper  their 
study  medication  over  a  1-week  period  and  given  the  option  to  enter  into  an  open-label  extension 
study. 
Concomitant pain medications that might have affected the pain or sleep disturbance associated with 
fibromyalgia  were  to  be  discontinued  within  1  to  30  days  (or  possibly  longer  if  needed  for  tapering) 
prior to Visit 1

Pharmacokinetic design 
Two PK samples were to be collected at Visit 6 (Week 3). The first sample was to be collected as soon 
as possible upon arrival at the clinic, and the second sample was to be collected just prior to leaving 
the  clinic.  Subjects  with  a  clinic  visit  scheduled  in  the  morning  should  not  have  taken  their  morning 
dose until immediately after the first PK sample was drawn. Subjects with a clinic visit scheduled in the 
afternoon should have taken their morning dose at the usual time, collect the PK samples upon arrival 
and departure, and no dose  was to be administered during  the clinic visit.  Subjects with a clinic visit 
scheduled in the evening should not have taken their evening dose until immediately after the first PK 
sample was drawn. 
Information  concerning  the  times  when  the  two  blood  samples  were  drawn,  the  times  when  the  last 
two  doses  were  administered  (the  two  doses  prior  to  the  2nd  PK  blood  sample),  and  the  time  of  last 
meal prior to the PK samples was to be recorded. Blood samples were collected into tubes containing 
sodium heparin. To obtain plasma, samples were centrifuged at 1700 g for about 10 minutes at 4°C. 
The plasma samples were stored at -20°C within 1 hour of collection. 
Analytical method 
Analysis of pregabalin was performed using the anlytical method 08BASM037V3. The analytical method 
was developed and validated at the concerned laboratory. A copy of the validation report is presented 
in Validation Report 08BAS0048. Pregabalin and internal standard (PD-403609) were measured by LC-
MS/MS. 
Plasma samples were stored at approximately  -20 ±5 °C until analysis. The LLOQ was 0.0250 μg/mL 
and  the  ULOQ  was  10.00 μg/mL.  Samples  with  concentrations  above  ULOQ  were  adequately  diluted 
into  calibration  range.  The  inter-day  precision  and  accuracy  ranged  from  to  ≤4%  and  from  101.6  to 
109.5%, respectively. The storage stability was stated as 371 days at -20°C and -70°C. A total of 32 
samples  of  the  total  of  97  plasma  samples  were  assayed  for  pregabalin  later  than  the  established 
stability of 371 days. No information on the storage stability under other conditions (e.g. autosampler), 
dilution integrity and intra-day accuracy and precision were provided. 
A total of 21 samples (21.6% of the total 97 study samples analysed) were selected, re-assayed and 
evaluated  for  the  Incurred  Samples  Reproducibility.  The  percentage  of  the  incurred  samples  meeting 
the acceptance criteria was 100%. 
Chromatograms  of  28  out  of  48  subjects  (58%)  used  in  PK  analysis,  including  plasma  blank,  QC 
samples and calibration standards were submitted with the report. 
PK analysis 
The PK analysis data set consisted of all subjects who took at least 1 dose of pregabalin and who had 
at  least  1  post-dose  PK  measurement.  A  previously  developed  population  PK  model  was  used  to 
evaluate pregabalin PK in adolescent subjects with fibromyalgia. 
The  population  PK  model  was  developed  using  serial  sampling  data  from  60  paediatric  subjects  (3 
months  to  16  years)  and  103  healthy  and  20  renally  impaired  adults.  Pregabalin  pharmacokinetics 
were adequately characterized using a one compartment open model with first order elimination, first 
order absorption rate constant describing pregabalin absorption when given in the fasted state and a 
Weibull  input  function  describing  pregabalin  absorption  when  given  in  the  fed  state.  Pregabalin  oral 
clearance was directly related to creatinine clearance and was unaffected by race, age, gender or body 
weight. Pregabalin apparent distribution volume was directly related to body weight to power of 0.955.

A typical female has approximately 14% lower V/F relative to males. However, this gender difference 
was  considered  not  to  be  of  clinical  importance.  The  inverse  relationship  between  weight  normalized 
V/F  and  patient  age  reduced  V/F  by  ~13%  over  the  age  range  of  3  months  to  1  years  and  another 
25% over the age range of 4 to 80 years. This decrease in V/F with increasing age is consistent with 
age-related decrease in total body water across both  paediatrics and adults. In infants and paediatric 
subjects, total body water per kg of body  weight  decreases with age and in adults, the ratio of total 
body water to body weight declines with age as a result of increasing body fat with increasing age. The 
covariate, race, did not have a significant impact on pregabalin V/F parameter. 
This  population  PK  model  was  adapted  to  be  used  to  predict  plasma  pregabalin  concentrations  for 
adolescent  subjects  with  fibromyalgia  in  study  A0081180.  For  simplicity,  the  Weibull  function  was 
replaced  with  first  order  (ka)  to  describe  pregabalin  absorption  in  the  fed  state.  Additionally,  a 
creatinine  clearance  breakpoint  was  evaluated  given  the  artificially  inflated  calculated  creatinine 
clearance observed in overweight patients. 
Statistical Methods 
NONMEM version 7.2 (ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD) analysis was used for generating 
the  PK/PD  data  files.  Prediction-corrected  visual  predictive  checks  (pcVPC)  were  conducted  by  PsN 
version  3.5.4.  Pre-processing  of  input  data  was  conducted  with  Splus  8.0  (see  Table  below).  Post-
processing  of  output  tables  was  conducted  using  R  version  2.12.2  with  the  package  Xpose4.  The 
analysis  data  files  contain  sparse  concentration  data,  dosing  and  demographic  information.  The 
variables  age,  sex,  race,  body  weight,  height,  and  serum  creatinine  (used  to  calculate  creatinine 
clearance)  were  recorded  based  on  the  value  at  the  time  of  the  first  visit.  The  datasets  include 
information on whether the dose was given fed or after fasting. Only the time of last meal prior to the 
first PK sample was collected. This information was used to populate fed/fasted status for the two most 
recent doses. All other doses within the dataset were assigned as food unknown. 
Clinical outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  of  the  study  was  the  change  from  baseline  to  week  15  in  mean  pain  score 
derived  from  daily  pain  numeric  rating  scale  (24-hour  recall)  ranging  from  0  (no  pain)  to  10  (worst 
possible pain). 
The secondary endpoints were: 
  Weekly mean pain score at each week - derived from daily pain NRS (24-hour recall). 
  30% and 50% pain responders. 
  Weekly pain NRS at Week 15 (1-week recall). 
  Weekly mean sleep quality score  at endpoint, from  the daily  sleep  diary. Endpoint is defined 
as the mean of the last 7 diary entries prior to Week 15 while the subject is on study drug. 
  Weekly mean sleep quality score at each week, from the daily sleep diary.

 
Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) at Week 15. 
Exploratory  endpoints  were  Parent  Global  Impression  of  Change  (Parent-GIC)  at  Week  15  and 
Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire for children (FIQ-C) at Week 15. 
Safety  endpoints  were  incidence  and  severity  of  AEs,  physical  and  neurological  examinations,  vital 
signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), laboratory assessment, Tanner staging and suicidality assessment. 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
The endpoints PGIC and FIQ-C are considered the most important secondary endpoints as these reflect 
the functional improvement of the patient.  
As  fibromyalgia  is  a  condition  with  many  dimensions,  it  is  considered  important  that  endpoints  other 
than  pain  (sleep,  function)  show  consistent  effects  with  the  primary  endpoint  change  in  mean  pain 
score. 
Statistical Methods 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) population consisted of all randomized subjects who received at least one 
dose of study drug (either pregabalin or placebo). The FAS population was the primary population for 
efficacy analyses. The primary analysis of the primary endpoint (change from baseline to endpoint in 
weekly  mean  pain  scores)  was  carried  out  based  on  the  FAS  population  with  multiple  imputation 
applied  to  the  weekly  data  and  using  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  techniques,  with  terms  for 
baseline  mean  pain  score,  center  and  treatment  in  the  model.  The  multiple  imputation  method 
assigned to missing pain scores a value similar to those of the baseline distribution of pain scores if the 
subject  discontinued  for  adverse  events  or  lack  of  efficacy.  All  other  missing  scores  were  assigned 
according  the  distribution  of  those  for  completer  subjects.  For  sensitivity  analyses  of  the  primary 
endpoint, a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis was used. Additional sensitivity analyses 
were based on imputation rules described below: 
  Baseline  observation  carried  forward  (BOCF)  for  subjects  with  missing  Week  15  mean  pain 
score. 
 
Last observation carried forward (LOCF) for subjects with missing Week 15 mean pain score. 
  Modified  baseline  observation  carried  forward  (mBOCF)  for  subjects  with  missing  Week  15 
mean pain score, which will apply the BOCF rule for subjects discontinued due to AEs and the 
LOCF rule for subjects discontinued due to any other reason. 
Secondary  endpoints  based  on  the  daily  diary  were  analyzed  in  the  FAS  population  using  a  MMRM 
model with terms of treatment, center, baseline value, visit week, and treatment-by-visit interaction. 
This  model  was  used  to  estimate  treatment  difference  and  the  associated  95%  2-sided  confidence 
intervals  (CIs).  Unadjusted  and  adjusted  weekly  means  and  95%  CIs  were  presented  for  each 
treatment group at each week. 
Statistical significance was defined at the level of p<0.05 (2-sided test).

Results 
A  total  of  147  subjects  were  screened  and  107  subjects  at  23  study  centres  (US  17  centres  with  in 
total  67 subjects;  India  4  centres  with  in  total  35  subjects,  Czech  Republic  1  centre  with  4  subjects, 
and Taiwan 1 centre with 1 subject) were randomized to treatment. Of the 107 randomized subjects, 
107  (100%)  took  at  least  one  dose  of  study  drug.  A  total  of  44  (81.5%)  subjects  in  the  pregabalin 
group and 36 (67.9%) subjects in the placebo group completed the study, and 10 (18.5%) subjects in 
the pregabalin group and 17 (32.1%) subjects in the placebo group discontinued the study. 
The  majority  of  subjects  (92  of  107)  were  female.  All  but  2  of  the  female  subjects  (2.2%)  were  in 
menarche.  Mean  (range)  age  of  all  subjects  was  14.7  (12-17)  years.  The  majority  of  subjects  were 
White  (57.0%)  or  Asian  (33.6%).  Demographic  characteristics  were  similar  between  the  treatment 
groups (Table 2). 
Table 2. Demographic characteristics – safety population 
The  107  randomized  subjects  had  been  experiencing  FM  symptoms  for  a  mean  of  1.9  years  (range: 
0.3-11.7  years)  and  were  diagnosed  with  fibromyalgia  for  a  mean  of  5.7  months  (range:  0-45.1 
months)  prior  to  study  start.  Of  the  107  randomized  subjects,  95  (88.8%)  subjects  met  the  ACR 
fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria in addition to the Yunus and Masi criteria, which were a study eligibility 
requirement.

Rapporteur’s comment: 
As expected based on the prevalence of fibromyalgia, the majority of patients were female. Only four 
patients  from  the  EU  were  included.  Due  to  the  geographical  differences  in  the  way  in  which 
fibromyalgia  is  perceived,  diagnosed  and  managed,  the  results  of  this  study  can  not  be  readily 
extrapolated to the EU population. As mentioned in the introduction of this report, the outcomes were 
inconclusive for European subgroup in the adult fibromyalgia studies. 
Analytical results 
There were no subjects with missing covariate data. Some plasma samples were excluded, because of 
plasma  samples  with  missing  values,  plasma  samples  having  incomplete  or  a  high  likelihood  of 
inaccurate  sample  collection,  plasma  samples  obtained  ≥ 36  hours  after  the  last  recorded  dose 
(concentration  most  likely  below  LLOQ)  and  plasma  samples  collected  <36  hours  after  last  dose  but 
with a value below the LLOQ. In the Table below the excluded data are summarised.

PK results 
The  prediction-corrected  observed  and  predicted  values  using  the  population  PK  model  with  and 
without  a  creatinine  clearance  breakpoint  are  shown  in  Figure  1.  The  model  adequately  predicted 
pregabalin  concentrations  in  adolescent  patients  with  fibromyalgia.  Addition  of  a  creatinine  clearance 
breakpoint,  in  order  to  account  for  artificially  inflated  creatinine  clearance  in  overweight  patients, 
improved  the  model  fit.  This  model  had  similar  predictive  value  for  PK  samples  assayed  within  and 
outside established long term stability indicating that storage for >371 days did not have any impact 
on  results  of  the  PK  analyses.  There  was  no  obvious  difference  in  model  performance  based  on 
subject’s age, creatinine clearance (Figure 2), or baseline body weight.

In conclusion, the pregabalin concentration values observed for adolescent subjects with fibromyalgia 
were adequately described by the population  PK one compartment model with  first order absorption, 
first  order  elimination,  and  a  direct  relationship  between  individual’s  creatinine  clearance  and 
pregabalin clearance. 
Assessor’s comments 
Since pregabalin is rapidly absorbed (F = ~90%), undergoes negligible metabolism, is primarily renally 
eliminated  and  dose  is  based  on  body  weight,  no  differences  in  kinetics  are  expected  between 
adolescents  with  fibromyalgia  and  adolescents  and  adults  without  fibromyalgia.  The  similar 
pharmacokinetics  are  confirmed  by  the  limited  PK  data  provided  by  the  Applicant  from  study 
A0081180. 
Efficacy results 
The mean and median doses during the fixed dose period (maintenance dose) in the pregabalin group 
were  244.5  mg/day  and  262.3  mg/day,  respectively.  Mean  and  median  doses  were  higher  for  male 
subjects and for subjects weighing at least 50 kg. The highest number of subjects (40.4%) was treated 
with 450 mg/day; another 15.4% of subjects were treated with 300 mg/day, 19.2% with 150 mg/day, 
and 25.0% with 75 mg/day.  
Primary endpoint 
The  results  of  the  primary  endpoint  analysis  a  presented  in  table  3.  A  placebo-adjusted  treatment 
difference  of  -0.66  favouring  pregabalin  was  observed,  which  was  not  a  statistically  significant 
difference  (p=0.121).  Pregabalin-treated  subjects  experienced  an  improvement  of  1.60  points  from 
baseline on the 0-10 scale, while placebo-treated subjects experienced a 0.94 point improvement from 
baseline (LS mean changes).

Table  3.  Change  from  Baseline  to  Week  15  in  Weekly  Mean  Pain  Score  -  Daily  Pain  NRS  (24-Hour 
Recall) – FAS Population (MI) 
Sensitivity  analyses  (BOCF,  mBOCF,  LOCF,  MMRM  at  Week  15)  were  in  the  same  direction  as  the 
primary  efficacy  result  and  showed  greater  numerical  improvements  for  pregabalin-treated  subjects 
compared to placebo but these were not statistically significant. 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
The mean difference of -0.66 in pain score between pregabalin and placebo is considered very modest 
magnitude of effect and its clinical relevance is doubtful. 
Secondary endpoints 
Weekly mean pain scores derived from the daily pain diary were determined using the MMRM analysis 
with no imputation. Weekly mean pain scores  demonstrated statistically significant improvements with 
pregabalin compared to placebo starting at Week 3 (-0.83, p=0.019), and for most of the fixed dose 
period (11 of 13 weeks), with treatment differences between -0.68 and -1.06. 
More pregabalin-treated than placebo-treated subjects were 30% or 50% pain responders, regardless 
of  imputation.  The  observed  30%  responder  rate  was  51.4%  for  pregabalin  and  50.0%  for  placebo. 
The  observed  50%  responder  rate  was  25.7%  from  pregabalin  and  12.5%  for  placebo.  These 
treatment differences were not statistically significant. 
Statistically  significant  improvements  at  Week  15  with  pregabalin  (compared  to  placebo)  were 
observed  for  some  secondary  and  exploratory  endpoints,  including  the  pain  NRS  with  1-week  recall 
administered at clinic visits (treatment difference -0.87; p=0.037), PGIC (53.1% vs 29.5% very much 
or much improved; p=0.013 across all 7 categories), and the Parent-GIC (51.0% vs 25.0% very much 
or  much  improved;  p=0.011  across  all  7  categories).  Improvements  were  not  statistically  significant 
for pregabalin vs placebo on the FIQ-C total score and subscales and sleep quality as assessed by daily 
sleep diaries.

Rapporteur’s comment: 
The  secondary  endpoints  show  inconsistent  results.  Although  the  weekly  mean  pain  scores 
demonstrated  statistically  significant  improvements  with  pregabalin  compared  to  placebo  starting  at 
Week 3, the magnitude of effect is again modest. Further the differences in 30% and 50% responder 
rates are not statistically significant. 
Although  the  PGIG  and  Parent-GIC  indicate  improvements  in  patients’  overall status  with  pregabalin, 
these improvements are not reflected in functionality (FIQ-C) or effects on sleep. 
Safety results 
A total of 54 subjects in the pregabalin group and 53  subjects in the placebo group were included in 
the analysis of adverse events (AEs). 
The  most  common  AEs  were  dizziness,  nausea,  headache,  weight  gain,  and  fatigue  (Table  4).  No 
deaths occurred in this study. One pregabalin-treated subject experienced 2 serious AEs (cholelithiasis, 
major  depression).  Similar  numbers  of  severe  AEs  (n=3  per  group)  and  discontinuations  due  to  AEs 
(n=4 per group) occurred in each treatment group. No suicidal behaviour was reported. Three subjects 
(5.6%) treated with pregabalin and 2 subjects (3.8%) treated with placebo reported suicidal ideation. 
More subjects experienced weight gain in the pregabalin group, with 11 subjects reporting weight gain 
of  at  least  7%  and  none  in  the  placebo  group.  There  were  no  clinically  relevant  findings  in  Tanner 
stage development (breast and pubic hair) during the study; the majority of subjects were at stage 4 
or  5  at  screening  and  at  the  end  of  the  study.  There  were  no  other  clinically  significant  findings  for 
other  safety  assessments  including  physical  examinations,  neurological  examinations,  laboratory  test 
results, and ECG

Table  4. Analysis of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by Preferred Term (All Causality): Events in 
≥4 Subjects in Either Treatment Group. 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
The  most  common  adverse  events  dizziness,  nausea,  headache  and  increased  weight  are  typical  for 
pregabalin.  In  overall  the  safety  profile  is  consistent  to  what  is  known  based  on  the  prior  adult  and 
paediatric studies. 
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH has presented data from a clinical study performed in adolescent patients with fibromyalgia. 
Study  A0081180  was  conducted  to  fulfil  the  US  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  requirements. 
Lyrica is not registered in the EU for the treatment of fibromyalgia.  
Thus far, beyond this fibromyalgia study in adolescents. paediatric data were available from a PK and 
tolerability study in epileptic children. No posology recommendations for paediatric patients are given 
in the approved indications neuropathic pain, partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation 
and generalized anxiety disorder, paediatric data are however presented in SmPC sections 4.8, 5.1 and 
5.2.  
The pharmacokinetics in adolescent with fibromyalgia are similar to previously obtained PK parameters 
in adolescents without fibromyalgia. Pregabalin is rapidly absorbed (F = ~90%), undergoes negligible 
metabolism,  is  primarily  renally  eliminated  and  the  dose  is  based  on  body  weight,  therefore,  no 
differences in kinetics are expected between adolescents with fibromyalgia and adolescents and adults 
without fibromyalgia. 
The submitted study shows a very modest decrease in mean pain score from baseline to 15 weeks with 
pregabalin  in  adolescent  patients  with  fibromyalgia,  the  treatment  difference  relative  to  placebo  was 
not  statistically  significant.  The  results  on  secondary  and  exploratory  endpoints  showed  inconsistent 
results. The modest changes in pain are not reflected in other relevant endpoints such as functionality 
or sleep. 
The observed safety profile was comparable to the safety profile of adult fibromyalgia patients, apart 
from  mild  nausea  which  was  reported  more  frequently  in  adolescent  patients.  The  safety  profile  is 
comparable to previous safety data on children obtained from prior paediatric studies.

Page 20/21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH does not propose any changes to the product information, as Lyrica is not approved for the 
treatment  of  fibromyalgia  in  the  EU.  The  MAH  further  states  that  the  safety  results  in  adolescent 
studies  do  not  warrant  changes  or  limitations  to  the  ongoing  paediatric  fibromyalgia  and  epilepsy 
studies. The information provided in this submission does not change the favourable benefit-risk profile 
of pregabalin. 
2.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The conclusion drawn by the MAH is accepted. Fibromyalgia is not an approved indication for adults in 
the EU. The provided clinical study in adolescents did not demonstrate a clinically meaningful effect of 
pregabalin in fibromyalgia symptoms. Therefore no amendments in indications are warranted. 
The  plasma  concentrations  in  adolescents  with  fibromyalgia  were  comparable  to  concentrations 
observed  in  adolescents  and  adults  without  fibromyalgia.  Therefore  no  amendments  to  the 
pharmacokinetic data already presented in the SmPC are warranted. 
The  observed  safety  profile  in  the  provided  study  was  comparable  to  the  one  observed  in  previous 
paediatric  studies.  Therefore  no  amendments  to  product  information  or  protocols  for  the  planned  or 
ongoing paediatric studies are warranted.

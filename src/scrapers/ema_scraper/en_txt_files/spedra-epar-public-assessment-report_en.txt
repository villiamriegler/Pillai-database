Executive summary 
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the consistent or recurrent inability to achieve and/or maintain an 
erection  sufficient  to  permit  satisfactory  sexual  performance.  Normal  erectile  function  requires  the 
coordination of psychological, hormonal, neurological, vascular and anatomic factors. Alteration of any of 
these is sufficient to cause ED. The main causes of ED are chronic systemic illnesses (diabetes mellitus, 
heart  disease,  hypertension  and  peripheral  vascular  disease),  neurological  disorders  (post-traumatic 
spinal-cord injuries, multiple sclerosis) or post-surgical lesions (after radical prostatectomy). 
There  are  several  approaches  to  the  management  of  erectile  dysfunction:  psychosexual  counselling, 
hormonal  therapy,  mechanical  devices,  vascular  surgery  and  pharmacological  treatment  (including 
intracavernosal  pharmacotherapy  and  intra-urethral  prostaglandin  as  well  as  oral  treatments).  The 
currently available oral pharmacological treatments for ED are based on inhibitors of the cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) that increase penile blood flow and erection in 
response to sexual stimulation.  
PDE type 5 (PDE5) is the predominant form of the enzyme in the smooth muscle of the corpora cavernosa. 
In men, sexual stimulation causes nitric oxide to be released from nerves and endothelial cells, which 
diffuses into smooth muscle cells in the walls of penile arteries and spongy erectile tissue. Nitric oxide 
stimulates the enzyme guanylate cyclase to synthesise cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), leading 
in turn to decreased Ca2+ concentrations in smooth muscle cells. This causes smooth muscle relaxation 
and increased blood flow, thus producing penile erection. In erectile tissues, cGMP is degraded by PDE5. 
Administration  of  a  PDE5  inhibitor  leads  to  higher  cGMP  levels  and  thus  enhanced  smooth  muscle 
relaxation and penile blood flow. 
Avanafil (also referred to as TA-1790), is a new PDE5 inhibitor for oral administration that was developed 
for  its  high  selectivity  for  the  PDE5  isoenzyme  relative  to  other  PDE5  inhibitors.  In  April  2013,  the 
European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended 
the  authorisation  of  Spedra  (avanafil),  for  the  treatment  of  erectile  dysfunction  in  adult  men.  The 
recommended dose is 100 mg taken as needed approximately 30 minutes before sexual activity. Based 
on  individual  efficacy  and  tolerability,  the  dose  may  be  increased  to  a  maximum  dose  of  200  mg  or 
decreased to 50 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once a day.  In order for avanafil 
to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. If avanafil is taken with food, the onset of activity may be 
delayed compared to the fasting state.  
Clinical  efficacy  of  avanafil  in  males  with  ED  is  supported  by  three  phase  III  pivotal  studies  and  an 
open-label  extension  study.  The  study  design  of  the  pivotal  trials  was  performed  in  line  with  other 
available  PDE5  inhibitors  on  the  market.  Unfortunately,  no  comparison  was  made  with  other  PDE5 
inhibitors to allow a better understanding of the efficacy results in the context of the current standard of 
care for treatment of ED.   
In the general population of patients with ED, avanafil, at both the 100 mg and 200 mg doses, resulted in 
a roughly 30% gain over placebo in the percentage of successful intercourses and 20% increase in vaginal 
penetration;  the  change  in  the  assessment  score  for  erectile  function  (delta  in  International  Index  of 
Erectile  Function  (IIEF)  questionnaire)  was  greater  than  5  points  (p<0.001  for  all  comparisons).  A 
comparison between the 100-mg and 200-mg doses showed no statistically significant difference. 
Reduced efficacy of avanafil was seen in ED subjects with diabetes mellitus. This was expected and is in 
line with the generally observed lower efficacy of PDE5 inhibitors in this patient population. In subjects 
with ED following a nerve-sparing prostatectomy, a statistically significant improvement over baseline for 
all three primary efficacy endpoints was observed for avanafil in subjects.

Although the avanafil clinical development program allowed inclusion of males with no upper age limit, 
due to the low number of elderly subjects enrolled, it is uncertain whether efficacy and safety have been 
well characterised in this subgroup of subjects, especially the elderly (≥70 years old). 
The most common side effects are headache, flushing, nasal and sinus congestion, dyspepsia and back 
pain. 
To rule out any effect of avanafil on QTc, the Applicant has been requested to present data from a study 
evaluating QTc prolongation with avanafil. Furthermore the Applicant is conducting a study evaluating the 
effect on spermatogenesis in healthy adult male subjects, and the report will be submitted as defined in 
the risk management plan. 
So far, available data do not allow a definite conclusion on the potential risk of avanafil to the environment. 
The Applicant will update the interim ERA report incorporating the additional test results required and 
submit it to the EMA in February 2014. 
Overall,  the  efficacy  of  avanafil  over  placebo  has  been  demonstrated.  The  adverse  effect  profile  of 
avanafil is concordant with those known for other PDE5 inhibitors already authorised and no new safety 
signals have been observed with avanafil.  
The benefit/risk balance of avanafil in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males is positive, for 
the intended indication “treatment of ED in adult males”. 
A pharmacovigilance plan for Spedra will be implemented as part of the marketing authorisation.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the consistent or recurrent inability to achieve and/or maintain an 
erection sufficient to permit satisfactory sexual performance.  
Assessment report 
EMA/299432/2013 
Page 9/112 
 
 
 
 
Normal  erectile  function  requires  the  coordination  of  psychological,  hormonal,  neurological,  vascular 
and anatomic factors. Alteration of any of these is sufficient to cause ED. Main causes of ED are chronic 
systemic  illnesses  (diabetes  mellitus,  heart  disease,  hypertension  and  peripheral  vascular  disease), 
neurological disorders (post-traumatic spinal-cord injuries, multiple sclerosis) or post-surgical lesions 
(after radical prostatectomy). 
There are several approaches to the management of erectile dysfunction: psychosexual counselling, 
hormonal 
therapy,  mechanical  devices,  vascular  surgery  and  pharmacological 
treatment 
(intracavernosal pharmacotherapy and intraurethral prostaglandin).  
The current available pharmacological treatment of ED are based on inhibitors of the cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) that increase penile blood flow and erection 
in response to sexual stimulation.  
About the product 
Avanafil, the active substance of Spedra (also referred to as TA-1790), is a new PDE5 inhibitor for oral 
administration, which was developed for its high selectivity for the PDE5 isoenzyme relative to other 
PDE5  inhibitors.  PDE  type  5  (PDE5)  is  the  predominant  enzyme  in  the  corpus  cavernosum  smooth 
muscle. In men, sexual stimulation causes nitric oxide to be released from nerves and endothelial cell, 
which diffuses into smooth muscle cells in the walls of penile arteries and spongy erectile tissue. Nitric 
oxide stimulates the guanylate cyclase enzyme to synthesise cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) 
leading to decreased Ca2+ concentrations in smooth muscle cells causing smooth muscle relaxation and 
increased blood flow, thus causing penile erection to occur. In erectile tissues, cGMP is degraded by 
PDE5. Administration of a PDE5 inhibitor leads to higher cGMP levels and thus enhanced smooth muscle 
relaxation and penile blood flow. 
The product is formulated as immediate release (IR) tablet in strengths of 50, 100 and 200 mg for oral 
use. 
The applicant initially applied for the following indication:  “Treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult 
males". 
The finally approved indication is as follows: “Treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult men. In order for 
Spedra to be effective, sexual stimulation is required”.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The chemical name of avanafil is 
(S)-4-(3-Chloro-4-methoxybenzylamino)-2-(2-hydroxymethylpyrrolidin-1-yl)-N-pyrimidin-2-ylmethyl-
5-pyrimidinecarboxamide and has the following structural formula: 
Avanafil  is  a  white  crystal  or  white  crystalline  powder,  slightly  soluble  in  methanol  and  ethanol  and 
practically  insoluble  in  water.  Avanafil  has  only  one  crystalline  form,  therefore  no  polymorphism  was 
observed.  
The structure of Avanafil was supported by elemental analysis, IR, UV, 1H and 13C NMR, MS and XRD.  
Avanafil exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 1 chiral center and exists as S conformer. The 
stereochemical configuration was determined by XRD.  
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Manufacture 
Avanafil is synthesized using commercially available starting materials.  
The active substance is manufactured by one manufacturer. Detailed information on the manufacturing 
of  the  active  substance  has  been  provided  in  the  restricted  part  of  the  ASMF  and  it  was  considered 
satisfactory. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin 
and characterised.  
The  levels  of  the  impurities  were  supported  by  the  results  of  toxicological  studies  and  appropriate 
specification limits have been set.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description, identification (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), 
purity  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  heavy  metals  (Ph  Eur),  palladium  (ICP-MS),  optical  isomer 
(HPLC),reagent (GC) and residual ignition. 
Assessment report 
EMA/299432/2013 
Page 11/112 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The analytical methods used have been sufficiently described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data of 9 commercial scale batches of the active substance were provided. The results 
were within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. However, a complete description and 
validation data of the analytical methods used to control each of a specified solvent, reagent and catalyst 
in  the  active  substance  specifications  should  be  submitted.  In  addition,  additional  batch  results, 
confirming that the level of a residual solvent is lower than specified, should be provided. 
Stability 
3 production scale batches of the active substance packed in the intended commercial package (double 
polyethylene bags which are individually sealed with plastic ties and placed into fibre drums closed with 
metal lids with security pegs) from the proposed manufacturer were put on stability testing as per ICH 
conditions: under long term (25°C/60%RH) for 18 months, and accelerated (40°C/75%RH) for up 6 
months for three batches. Photostability test following ICH guidelines Q1B was performed on one batch. 
Results  on  stress  conditions  50+2ºC/75+5%RH  during  3  months  were  also  provided  on  one  batch. 
Avanafil  was  investigated  under  conditions  prepared  with  water,  acidic  and  basis  reagents,  and 
hydrogen peroxide. 
Other  supportive  stabilities  studies  were  conducted  on  other  batches  with  some  differences  on  the 
manufacturing process, manufacturing site and container closure system. 
The following parameters were tested: description, purity, optical isomer, loss of drying and assay.  
The stability studies have proven that avanafil is mostly sensitive to oxidative conditions and to light 
exposure when it is in the liquid state.  
Stability results showed that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is very stable. 
The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product was developed as an immediate-release, oral tablet formulation because a rapid 
onset of efficacy was desired.  
Although the solubility of avanafil is high under acidic conditions, it is very low in the neutral to alkali pH. 
Thus, a highly water soluble organic acid was desired as a solubilizing agent to improve the solubility of 
the active substance. Fumaric acid was specifically chosen because it exhibited the best compatibility 
with the active substance of the agents tested. The optimal ratio of fumaric acid to avanafil resulting in 
tablets  with  acceptable  properties  (weight,  thickness,  hardness)  and  dissolution  characteristics  was 
determined in a  formulation study.   Active granules (avanafil/mannitol/hydroxypropylcellulose) were 
prepared with different particle sizes of the active substance.  
Using the aforementioned active granules, the method for addition of the fumaric acid was determined 
in a study as a part of manufacturing process development.  
In order to accelerate the disintegration and dissolution of the tablets in an acidic environment (e.g., the 
stomach)  the  effect  of  adding  precipitated  calcium  carbonate  was  studied.  The  formulation  with 
precipitated calcium carbonate disintegrated faster than that without precipitated calcium carbonate in 
all test medium because of the bubbling effect between acid and base. From this study, the optimal 
Assessment report

Page 12/112 
 
 
 
 
amount of calcium carbonate that resulted in rapid disintegration of Avanafil tablets without significantly 
raising the pH was determined. Therefore, precipitated calcium carbonate was included in the Avanafil 
tablet formulation. 
Compatibility with conventional immediate release excipients were evaluated by preliminary stability 
studies. All of the chosen excipients were compatible with the active substance under the tested storage 
conditions.  Compatibility  has  also  been  confirmed  by  the  results  of  stability  studies  of  the  finished 
product. 
The Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) of the immediate-release Avanafil tablets are dissolution rate and 
dose uniformity. A set of experiments was conducted to elucidate the Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) 
for  the  Avanafil  tablet  manufacturing  process.  Control  ranges  have  been  established  for  these 
parameters to assure reproducibility of the CQAs of the product. 
Two  formulations  (Formulation  I  and  II)  were  used  in  clinical  studies  during  the  Avanafil  Tablet 
development program. Both formulations have identical excipients (with the exception of the colorant 
added  to  Formulation  II).  The  formulation  used  in  Phase  3  clinical  studies  (Formulation  II)  is  the 
proposed  formulation  for  the  commercial  product.  A  clinical  bioequivalence  study  was  performed  to 
compare  Formulation  I  and  Formulation  II,  and  bioequivalence  between  the  two  formulations  were 
demonstrated. 
The primary packaging proposed is PVC/PCTFE/Aluminium foil blisters. The material complies with PhEur 
requirements and it is adequate to support the stability and use of the product.  
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of 6 main steps: milling, preparation of binder solutions, formation 
of active granules, formation of fumaric acid granules, blending and tableting. 
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. Therefore, the absence of process 
validation  data  on  commercial  scale  batches  in  the  dossier  is  considered  acceptable.  The  applicant 
submitted the validation scheme and the commitment to perform process validation at commercial scale 
(3 consecutive batches) prior to placing the medicinal product on the market for two strengths (100 mg 
and 200 mg). With regard to the 50 mg strength a concurrent validation was applied for. The Annex 15 
to the EU Guide to Good Manufacturing Practice states that in particular circumstances it may be possible 
to validate a process during routine production (concurrent validation). In this case, considering that the 
granule is the same for the different strengths (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg), and that only one batch of 
the 50 mg strength will be manufactured per year, the proposal was considered acceptable. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  description,  identification 
(HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  purity  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  unit  (Ph  Eur),  dissolution  (Ph  Eur),  Total 
Aerobic Microbial Count (Ph Eur), Total Combined Yeast and Mold Count (Ph Eur), and Escherichia coli 
(Ph Eur). 
Batch analysis results in 3 pilot scale batches per strength used in clinical trials confirm consistency and 
uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is capable and under control.

Stability of the product 
Stability data of 9 pilot scale batches, three of each dose strength (50 mg, 100 mg and 
200  mg),  packaged  in  the  proposed  commercial  packaging  configuration  stored  under  long  term 
conditions  for  18-24  months  at  25ºC/60%RH  and  for  up  to  12  months  under  both  intermediate 
conditions at 30°C/65% RH and accelerate conditions at 40ºC/75%RH according to ICH guidelines were 
provided. The pilot batches used are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the 
same primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for description (appearance), identification (HPLC), assay (HPLC), purity (HPLC), 
dissolution (Ph Eur), total aerobic microbial count (Ph Eur), total combined yeast and mold count (Ph 
Eur).   The analytical procedures used were stability indicating. 
In addition, three batches (one of each dose strength) were exposed to stress conditions (50°C and 
40°C/75%  RH,  open  container)  and  were  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products.assess the stability of the product when 
exposed directly to conditions of high temperature. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. A complete description and validation data of the analytical methods 
used to control each of a specified solvent, reagent and catalyst in the active substance specifications 
should be submitted. In addition, additional batch results, confirming that the level of a residual solvent 
is lower than specified, should be provided. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
A complete description and validation data of the analytical methods used to control each of a specified 
solvent, reagent and catalystin the active substance specifications should be submitted. In addition, 
additional batch results, confirming that the level of a residual solvent is lower than specified, should be

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The design of the non-clinical testing program for avanafil was based on the guidance provided by ICH 
M3  (R2):  Non-clinical  Safety  Studies  for  the  Conduct  of  Human  Clinical  Trials  and  Marketing 
Authorisation  for  Pharmaceuticals.  The  non-clinical  testing  strategy  included  pharmacology  studies, 
general  toxicity  studies,  toxicokinetic  and  nonclinical  pharmacokinetic  studies,  reproduction  toxicity 
studies,  genotoxicity  studies,  an  assessment  of  carcinogenic  potential  and  in  vitro  biochemical 
evaluation.  
The  drug  substance  used  in  the  toxicology  studies  was  produced  using  the  same  process  used  to 
manufacture avanafil for the clinical trials. 
GLP 
The primary pharmacology studies were non-Good Laboratory Practices (GLP). The Applicant refers that 
many  of  the  safety  pharmacology  studies  (cardiovascular,  respiratory,  central  nervous  and 
gastrointestinal  systems,  as  well  as  studies  of  ocular  and  retinal  function)  were  conducted  under 
non-GLP  conditions,  however,  the  core  cardiovascular,  respiratory,  CNS  and  ocular  Safety 
Pharmacology studies were conducted under GLP conditions.  
All the toxicology studies were performed in accordance with GLP with the exception of a single oral dose 
(capsule) study in dogs (10 AVANAFIL-TOX 14), an one week repeat dose oral toxicity study in rats (10 
AVANAFIL TOX-07), and a one week repeat dose oral toxicity study in dogs (10 AVANAFIL TOX-15).  
Nevertheless, the applicant confirms that the toxicology studies were conducted in accordance with the 
study  protocols  and  laboratory  standard  operating  procedures,  and  met  the  requirements  of  the 
International  Conference  on  Harmonization  (ICH)  guidelines  for  the  conduct  of  these  studies.  Any 
deviations that occurred during the performance of the non-clinical studies were minor and did not affect 
the integrity of the study or the interpretation of the data. 
In addition, two toxicokinetic studies in male rats and pregnant rats (Study 1060 048) and pregnant 
rabbits  (1060  049),  performed  to  provide  supportive  exposure  information,  were  not  conducted  in 
compliance with GLPs. However, the Applicant provided acceptable justification of the quality of these 
studies. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Results  of  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies  indicated  that  avanafil  is  an  inhibitor  of  the  cyclic  guanosine 
monophosphate  (cGMP)-specific  phosphodiesterase5  (PDE5)  enzyme,  and  is  highly  selective  for  the 
PDE5 isoenzyme relative to other phosphodiesterases (>100-fold for PDE6; >1,000-fold for PDE4, PDE8 
and PDE10; >5,000-fold for PDE2 and PDE7; and >10,000-fold for PDE1, PDE3, PDE9, and PDE11) and 
a  wide  variety  of  cellular  targets.  Avanafil  showed  a  more  favourable  profile  against  other  enzymes 
known to be affected by this class of drugs, especially PDE6, where avanafil was more than 100-fold less 
potent  than  at  the  PDE5.  Therefore,  avanafil  had  a  low  propensity  for  visual  disturbances.  Avanafil 
displayed higher selectivity for PDE5 versus PDE6 (121-fold) as compared with sildenafil (16-fold) and 
Assessment report

vardenafil (21- fold) but much lower selective compared to tadalafil (550-fold). Its selectivity for PDE5 
with respect to PDE1, PDE3 was similar to that showed by tadalafil, and much lower respect to PDE4 
compared with tadalafil. 
In  canine  lung  tissue,  avanafil  exhibited  a  potent  PDE5  inhibition  (IC50  =  4.2-5.2  nM)  with  high 
selectivity  versus  other  PDE  isoforms  as  expressed  in  native  animal  tissues  or  recombinant  human 
enzyme expressed in cell lines. Avanafil inhibited PDE5 isolated from human platelets with an IC50 of 8.9 
nM. For PDE5, the isozyme of primary interest, avanafil showed an in vitro potency (IC50=5.2nM) on 
PDE5 particularly much lower than vardenafil (IC50=0.084 nM) and sildenafil (IC50=1.6nM), and lower 
to a lesser extent to tadalafil (IC50=4.0 nM). Thus, the high potency of avanafil claimed by the Applicant 
seems not supported.  
Three avanafil metabolites (M4, M16 and M27) observed in both rats and humans were selected for in 
vitro profiling against PDE isoforms. The plasma concentrations of the major circulating metabolites, M4 
and  M16,  were  approximately  23%  and  29%  that  of  the  parent  compound,  respectively.  A  third 
circulating metabolite, M27, accounted for about 3.8% of total radioactivity in humans. Since avanafil 
undergoes  significant  and  rapid  metabolism,  M27  is  not  considered  a  major  circulating  human 
metabolite (<10% radioactive dose). The M4 metabolite showed an in vitro inhibitory potency for PDE5 
that is 18% of that of avanafil, and a phosphodiesterase selectivity profile similar to that of avanafil. 
Therefore, M4 may produce at most a minor contribution to the therapeutic activity of avanafil (4% of 
total pharmacologic activity). The Applicant states that remaining findings with avanafil metabolites are 
unlikely to be of physiological significance due to their higher IC50 values (4,100 and 4,500nM for M16 
and  M27,  respectively)  and  lower  exposures  relative  to  parent  drug.  Testing  of  the  metabolites  for 
activity against PDE isoforms other than PDE5 yielded no findings of clinical significance. 
The dose-dependent potentiating of penile tumescence in rabbits administered single dose IV of both 
avanafil  and  sildenafil  was  no  indicative  of  any  treatment  effect;  statistical  significance  was  only 
registered  for  doses  ranging  100-1000  ug/kg  of  both  treatments  vs.  vehicle.  At  plasma  levels 
comparable to human free Cmax (18.3 ng/ml) reached with doses ranging from approx. 10 and 30 ug/kg 
for  avanafil  and  30  ug/kg  for  sildenafil,  no  statistical  difference  was  observed  between  placebo  and 
treatments. 
The potentiating of penile tumescence induced by avanafil 1000 μg/kg in dogs administered ID, was 
statistically significant only 10 minutes after administration versus vehicle; its effect rapidly decreased. 
The efficacy peak reached by sildenafil after 10 minutes from administration, although lower than the 
effect reached after the same time point with avanafil, was maintained almost constantly in 90 minutes 
except for 300 ug/kg for which the response less clear. The same trend applies when considering the 
plasma concentrations. This datum has not as much relevance as the Applicant stressed for supporting 
the  clinical  rapid  onset  for  avanafil;  considering  the  plasma  concentration  of  18.3  ng/ml  as  the  one 
reached in the human plasma following administration of the maximum tolerated dose of avanafil 200 
mg, the lowest dose of avanafil 100 ug/kg and sildenafil 100 ug/kg exerted the same effect in terms of 
extent. 
The potentiating of the stimulation induced tumescence induced by avanafil and sildenafil in monkey 
administered IV, was similar and both compounds at 1000 ug/kg were statistically significant only vs. 
vehicle. This dose correspond to 3.2–6.2 µM that is higher than the free human Cmax (0.038 uM). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies were performed. This was considered not necessary due to 
the high selectivity of avanafil for PDE5. Avanafil shows selectivity for the PDE5 isozyme as compared 
to other PDEs (from 121-fold to >19000-fold) and displays low activity against a variety of cellular 
Assessment report

targets. The off-target activity of avanafil compares favourably with sildenafil, particularly at the PDE6 
isozyme  and  at  adenosine  and  α1  adrenergic  receptors  (Please  refer  to  Receptor  Binding  in  Safety 
Pharmacology Section).  
Safety pharmacology programme 
As it is required in the guidelines currently in force, the core safety pharmacology studies included an 
assessment of potential effects of avanafil on cardiac function, respiratory system, and central nervous 
system and were conducted under GLP conditions. Besides the core safety pharmacology evaluation, 
supportive studies on specific drug class effects like ocular and retinal function, the receptor binding and 
selectivity of avanafil versus a number of target tissues other than corpus cavernosum, like smooth 
muscle  (vas  deferens  tissue),  platelet,  and  urine  volume  and  electrolyte  excretion,  were  performed. 
Many of these studies were supportive and were conducted under non-GLP conditions.  
Cardiovascular effect  
A battery of in vitro assays for cardiovascular safety tests was performed. In the hERG assay, a test to 
predict  the  potential  for  lengthening  of  the  QT  Interval,  avanafil  was  positive  in  blocking  hERG  at 
concentrations  tested  (1,  10,  30  and  100  µM).  Avanafil  had  an  IC50  of  15.8  µM  which  represents  a 
concentration approximately 416-fold above the unbound Cmax in human at the MRHD. The IC50 could 
not be calculated in the studies examining the function of L-type calcium channels and sodium channels. 
Thus,  avanafil  appeared  not  to  cause  conduction  delays  associated  with  re-entrant  arrhythmias  nor 
action potential shortening in atrial fibrillation. 
Further tests of avanafil at concentrations up to a 100 µM in isolated Beagle dog (male and female) 
Purkinje fibres showed a slight decrease in the duration of cardiac action potentials. This is consistent 
with effects of Ca2+ channel block but at concentrations unlikely to be clinically relevant (>2600-fold the 
free  concentration  at  MRHD).  Avanafil  showed  no  decreased  effect  in  the  duration  of  cardiac  action 
potentials at concentrations up to up to 10 µM in isolated guinea pig cardiac papillary muscle.  
The calcium antagonist-like effect was studied on isolated, K+ depolarized denuded rat aorta models. 
Avanafil  showed  to  be  less  potent  than  sildenafil  in  inducing  vasorelaxation  (higher  EC50  values  for 
CaCl 2).  The  vasorelaxation  effect  of  sildenafil  was  shown  to  be  concentration  dependent,  while  for 
avanafil it is not dose-dependently antagonized. This difference might be explained by the hypothesis 
that the vasorelaxant effect of higher levels of sildenafil is mediated by mechanisms other than the PDE5 
inhibition effect (i.e. a direct blocking action on the L-type Ca2+ channel), in contrast with a specific PDE5 
inhibitor effect of avanafil. 
The haemodynamic effects of avanafil at concentrations of 10 and 100 ug/kg/min were similar to those 
of  sildenafil  and  reduced  the  mean  arterial  pressure  in  anesthetized  dog.  In  open  chest  dogs,  both 
avanafil and sildenafil significantly decreased mean arterial pressure while at 300 ug/kg/min avanafil 
significantly  reduced  the  pulmonary  arterial  pressure  vs.  sildenafil.  Sildenafil,  but  not  avanafil, 
significantly increased HR at 1 ug/kg/min vs. vehicle and at 300 ug/kg/min also vs. avanafil. When orally 
administered to Beagle dogs avanafil decreased the blood pressure and increased the heart rate at the 
30 mg/kg (corresponding to a Cmax of 3.67 ug/mL or 7.58 μM that is higher than the free human Cmax= 
0.038 uM); there were no other consistent effects on haemodynamic or electrocardiographic parameters 
(no  potential  for  delaying  ventricular  repolarisation  (QT  interval  prolongation).  The  lack  of  QT 
prolongation in dog is in line with the high IC50 value (15.8 uM) of avanafil in the hERG channel assay. 
Collectively, these results suggest a low risk of electrocardiographic abnormalities in human. A clinical 
QT study (TA-140) was conducted and no evident effect on electrocardiography at the recommended 
therapeutic dose of 100 mg nor at higher dose of 800 mg was observed.

Central Nervous system effect 
In studies examining effects on the CNS, avanafil produced effects only at relatively high doses. Avanafil 
decreased  spontaneous  locomotor  activity  in  the  mouse  and  rat  a  1000mg/kg  p.o.  and  increased 
pentobarbital-induced sleeping time in the mouse (300mg/kg p.o). Otherwise, avanafil had no effect on 
spontaneous locomotor activity, no anti-convulsant effects after the maximal electroshock, no effects on 
pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced convulsions and deaths, no proconvulsant activity in following both the 
subliminal  electroshock  and  subliminal  PTZ  procedures,  and  no  analgesic  activities  in  the  acetic 
acid-induced writhing test in mice at doses up to 300 mg/kg p.o. 
Gastrointestinal System effect 
Overall, no relevant effects on gastrointestinal system were highlighted for avanafil following in vitro 
and in vivo studies performed. No effect on the spontaneous contraction of isolated rabbit jejunum or of 
guinea pig ileum. Avanafil decreased gastric excretion in rat, after single intraduodenal administration of 
300 mg/kg, the free C max associated with this doe is 10-fold above the human free Cmax. 
Ocular effect 
A series of studies were undertaken to evaluate the effects of avanafil on retinal function in isolated 
rabbit retinas and on in vivo retinal/ocular function in dogs. The  weak effects  of avanafil on in vitro 
electroretinogram are likely due to the less potent inhibitory activity of avanafil on PDE6 (higher IC50 
than that of sildenafil, but lower than that of tadalafil). In the only in vivo GLP study carried out on dogs, 
avanafil did not exert any ocular event up to 100 mg/kg which corresponded to a mean Cmax of 11 ug/ml 
much higher than the human effective free Cmax (18.3 ng/ml). 
Platelet Aggregation Effect 
Avanafil (10 μM) was  found to potentiate the anti-aggregation of sodium nitroprussiate (nitric oxide 
donor)  on  human  collagen-induced  platelet  aggregation;  this  effect  was  similar  to  the  one  when 
sildenafil was used. Avanafil has no effect on blood coagulation and fibrinolysis parameters in rats. 
Receptor selectivity 
Besides the selectivity of avanafil in inhibiting PDE5 relative to other PDE isozymes, the specificity of 
avanafil to PDE5 over other enzymes, receptors, and ion channels has been elucidated in radio-ligand 
binding studies. 
Concentrations tested (1 and 10 uM) were much higher than the IC50 vs. PDE5 for avanafil calculated in 
canine lung (5.2 or 4.2 nM) or in human platelets (8.9 nM). They were even higher than IC50 values for 
sildenafil (1.6 nM calculated both in canine lung and human platelets); thus the ability of sildenafil to 
compete on adenosine A1, A2A, A2B and α1 adrenergic receptors is of limited interests. Avanafil had no 
clinical  significant  affinity  for  adrenergic,  dopaminergic,  histaminergic,  muscarinic,  serotonergic  and 
calcium channel binding sites, and does not inhibit constitutive or inducible nitric oxide synthase.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
PDE5 inhibitors have been shown to interact with nitrates, and are therefore contraindicated in patients 
receiving organic nitrates due to the risk of a potentiation of their hypotensive effect. 
The  effect  of  co-administration  of  avanafil  with  nitroglycerin  on  mean  arterial  blood  pressure  was 
evaluated. Avanafil potentiated the effects of nitroglycerin in dogs (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg, intraduodenally). 
In addition, steps have been taken to address the risk for to augment the hypotensive effects of nitrates 
in the section 4.3 and 4.4 of the SmPC.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Evaluation of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of avanafil was performed in 
pharmacokinetic studies both in vitro and in vivo in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and monkeys after single 
and repeat oral administrations. The species used for analyses of pharmacokinetics were also used in 
the safety pharmacology and toxicology studies. 
Methods of analysis 
PK  evaluation  for  avanafil  and  metabolites  M4  and  M16  was  carried  out  according  to  the  general 
principles of ICH topic M3 (R2) “Non-clinical guidance including test species and in vitro biochemical 
evaluation”. Since M4 and M16 are those metabolites whose exposure in humans is greater than 10% 
respect to the parent compound exposure, they were also characterised from the PK point of view. 
Absorption 
To characterize the absorption profile of avanafil the applicant has conducted studies in several animal 
models (mice, rats, dogs,  rabbit and monkeys). Plasma pharmacokinetic properties of avanafil were 
shown to be consistent across these non-clinical species. Following oral administration of avanafil, the 
intended  clinical  route  of  administration,  avanafil  was  rapidly  and  relatively  well  absorbed  from  the 
gastrointestinal tract in the toxicology species and humans, with low to moderate oral bioavailability 
(1.5% in rats, 30-40% in dogs, and 15% in monkeys), short t max (0.5-2h), short t 1/2  (0.82-2.5h) and 
high systemic clearance. Low to moderate oral bioavailability suggests that avanafil appears to undergo 
a first-pass effect in the absorption process from the digestive tract and/ or liver. Avanafil was rapidly 
absorbed  and  rapidly  metabolized  to  M4  and  M16;  the  pharmacokinetics  of  the  2  major  human 
metabolites was evaluated in rats and rabbits. 
In toxicology studies with mice, rats and dogs, mean Cmax and AUC values for avanafil, M4 and M16 
generally increased in a dose-related manner up to 2000 mg/kg (mouse, rat) and 100 mg/kg (dog). In 
repeat dose studies using oral administration, avanafil showed a short half-life of 0.7–2.5 h in all animal 
models, thus no accumulation phenomena were observed, except for dogs. The exposure to avanafil 
was higher in female rats than for male rats, while no marked gender-related differences were observed 
in the mouse and dog. Avanafil exposure was slightly lower in pregnant female rats than non-pregnant 
females; a 23% reduction in Cmax and 36–18% reduction in AUC. 
Distribution 
Distribution was assessed in rat following oral or IV administration of the single dose of 3 mg/kg; since 
avanafil  has  a  short  half-life  in  all  animal  species,  an  almost  complete  elimination  (rat  99.8%,  dog 
97.5%, monkey 93.5%, human 84.5%) and no unanticipated organ toxicity, no repeated dose tissue 
distribution  assays  were  considered  necessary.  Moreover,  in  repeated  dose  PK  or  TK  studies  the 
steady-state levels of Avanafil or metabolites was not higher than levels predicted from single dose PK 
studies (ICH Topic S3B PK: repeated dose tissue distribution studies). 
Following oral administration, the highest concentrations of avanafil seen at 0.5 h post-dose were in the 
gastrointestinal  contents  and  excretory  organs  (liver  and  kidney);  the  passage  through  blood-brain 
barrier  and  blood-testis  barrier  was  minimal  (<  20%  as  seen  in  blood).  Most  of  the  compound  was 
excreted after 24 h. 
The  pattern  of  distribution  following  IV  administration  was  similar  to  those  observed  following  oral 
administration  also  in  pigmented  rats;  in  this  latter  animal  model,  the  amount  of  avanafil  in 
melanin-containing tissues (uveal tract of the eyes and hair follicles) was higher and lasting up to 18 h. 
No determination of melanin affinity for metabolites M4 and M16 was assessed.

Avanafil (0.3–3.0 μg/mL), M4 and M16 exhibited high (concentration-independent) protein binding in 
the plasma of rat, dog and rabbit. In humans the avanafil was bound for 99% independently from age 
of the subjects. In humans, M4 was bound for 97% and M16 for 84%. Metabolites M4 and M16 were 
approximately less bound to plasma protein in animal models than in human; M16 was less bound than 
M4  and  avanafil  in  both  animal  and  clinical  species;  they  were  less  potent  (higher  IC50  values)  in 
inhibiting the PDE5 than the parent compound, thus resulting practically inactive. 
Metabolism 
Avanafil is mainly metabolised by liver enzymes via CYP3A4 with a minor contribution from CYP32C: in 
vitro metabolism of avanafil (TA-1790) is consistent across animal species and humans, and in vivo, the 
metabolic profile was qualitatively similar among rat, dog, and human. There was no human unique 
metabolite identified. The conversion of avanafil to M4 and M16, were rapid in the toxicology species and 
humans. In male rats, exposure to M4 was 2-3 fold greater than that of avanafil, while high exposure to 
M16  was  seen  in  the  pregnant  female  rabbits.  In  humans,  avanafil  still  represented  the  major 
component in plasma and accounted for 37% of total radioactive dose within 12 hours post-dosing. The 
plasma concentrations of the major circulating metabolites, M4 and M16, were approximately 23% and 
29% that of the parent compound, respectively. The third circulating metabolite, M27, accounted for 
about  10%  of  unchanged  avanafil  in  humans,  not  being  considered  a  major  circulating  human 
metabolite.  Hence, the PK profile of avanafil and M4 and M16 metabolites were similar, characterized by 
early t max and short t½. Although the amount of each metabolite varied among animal species (rat and 
dog), the metabolite profiles were similar, and that there was no human unique metabolite identified. 
Since M4 and M16 are those metabolites whose exposure in humans is greater than 10% respect to the 
parent compound exposure, they were the only one characterised from the PK point of view. 
Excretion 
After oral administration in male rats, dogs, monkeys and human, avanafil was mainly eliminated via 
faecal/biliary route as the primary elimination pathway.   
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
According to CYP450 induction/inhibition data, it is likely that avanafil cause drug-drug interaction with 
moderate  to  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitors,  resulting  in  an  increase  in  avanafil  Cmax  and  AUC.  Therefore, 
contraindications for patients taking CYP3A4 inhibitors have been included.  
In vitro studies on human liver microsomes demonstrated low potential of avanafil to inhibit activities of 
CYP1A1/2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2B6,  and  CYP2E1,  likely  potential  to  inhibit  CYP2C19  activity;  and  possible 
potential  to  inhibit  CYP3A4,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9  and  2D6  activities.  The  metabolites,  M4  and  M16  also 
demonstrated a low potential to inhibit the activities of CYPs 1A, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 
and 3A4. At clinically relevant concentrations, avanafil is not expected to induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and 
CYP3A4 activities in vivo. 
In  vitro  results  showed  high  membrane  permeability  for  avanafil,  a  modest  potential  for  acting  as 
P-glycoprotein substrate and a relatively modest effect regarding the potential to act as a P-gp inhibitor 
with Digoxin as a substrate. The in vitro study suggests an inhibitory effect on avanafil on P-gp and 
based  on  intestinal  concentrations  (maximum  dose/250 ml),  a  clinically  relevant  inhibitory  effect  on 
P-gp may not be excluded. Therefore, in the absence of data on humans, the potential of avanafil to 
interfere with the transport of other medicinal products mediated by P-glycoprotein is reported in SmPC 
section 4.5 and reflected in the RMP section 1.8. 
The  CHMP  agreed  that  avanafil  should  be  evaluated  in  vitro  to  determine  whether  it  is  a  potential 
substrate of Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP), which is expressed in the gastrointestinal tract,

liver, and kidney, and have a role in limiting oral bioavailability. In addition, given that hepatic pathway 
is  significant,  in  vitro  study  to  determine  whether  it  is  a  substrate  of  hepatic  uptake  transporters 
OATP1B1/OATP1B3 should be provided as  well as renal uptake transporters OAT1, OAT3 and  OCT2. 
Additionally, evaluation of avanafil as inhibitors of BCRP, OATP1B1/OATP1B3,  OAT1/OAT3 and OCT2 
should  be  considered  according  to  the  draft  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of  Drug  Interactions 
[CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 – Corr.*].  
However, at 10 μM, avanafil was shown to be a highly permeable compound; a mean absorptive, apical 
to basolateral, Papp value of 44.6•10-6 cm/s and a mean, secretory, basolateral to apical, Papp value of 
73.4•10-6 cm/s were determined from 3 studies with a total of nine replicates (10-AVANAFIL-BCS-01). 
The mean efflux ratio was 1.8, which is less than the efflux transporter cut-off value of 2, suggesting 
that  avanafil  is  unlikely  a  substrate  of  efflux  transporters  (i.e.,  P-gp  and  BCRP).  In  addition,  high 
permeability drugs in this class do not give transporters sufficient access to the drug and the extensive 
metabolism of avanafil facilitates the creation of a concentration gradient that favours drug entry from 
basolateral  side  of  hepatocytes  with  the  likelihood  of  being  minimally  impacted  by  hepatic  uptake 
transporters  such  as  OATP1B1  and  OATP1B3,  which  are  located  on  the  basolateral  side  of  the 
hepatocytes.  Therefore,  the  issue  regarding  the  evaluation  of  avanafil  as  a  substrate  for  drug 
transporters is considered solved. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The nonclinical toxicology programme has been conducted in mouse, rat, rabbit and dog species. The 
rationale  for  the  selection  of  these  species  for  toxicity  studies  is  considered  adequately  justified. 
Characterization of avanafil toxic effects with respect to target organs, dose-dependence, relation to 
exposure and potential reversibility, were assessed with a battery of toxicity studies. No new toxicity 
sign for this new PDE inhibitor emerged. 
Single dose toxicity 
The acute toxicity information has been obtained from three mammalian species (mouse, rat and dog) 
using both the clinical and intravenous route of administration in the mouse and rat and oral route of 
administration in dogs, which is considered adequate. The proposed maximum tolerated single oral dose 
of 2000 mg/kg and single intravenous dose of 40 mg/kg are considered adequate taking into account the 
results from the single toxicity study in mice, rats and dogs did not produce toxicologically significant 
effects.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
The Applicant has performed 10 repeat-dose studies in animal models to characterize the toxicology 
profile of avanafil: 1 in mice, 5 in rats and 4 in dogs. The studies included adequate number of animals. 
The dosing regimen employed in these studies provided constant tissue exposures and administered 
doses were more than 9-fold the intended dose in humans and provide an acceptable safety margin to 
the proposed maximum recommended human dose of avanafil (200mg). In addition the duration of the 
toxicology  studies  are  in  accordance  with  the  current  requirements  and  the  route  of  administration 
covers  the  oral  administration  intended  for  clinical  use.  During  the  development  of  avanafil, 
cardiovascular (blood pressure and QT prolongation) and ocular issues already identified with approved 
PDE5 inhibitors were addressed in safety pharmacology studies and in repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
Following repeated administration, avanafil at high doses primarily produced a decrease in body weight 
or body weight gain, increased liver weight, and histopathological changes in the liver consistent with 
induction of increased drug metabolizing enzyme activities. Significant adverse toxicity (measured by 
Assessment report 
EMA/299432/2013 
Page 21/112 
 
 
 
 
clinical  signs  as  convulsions,  hunched  posture,  thin  appearance,  audible,  irregular,  and  laboured 
respiration,  rough  hair  coat,  tremors,  hypoactivity,  yellow  hair  coat  (perineal  area),  cold  to  touch, 
and/or blue skin in mice; and inanimation, shivering, decreased activity, deep sedation, hypothermia, 
ptosis,  and  miosis  in  dogs)  was  only  observed  following  the  administration  of  high  doses  (2000 
mg/kg/day in mice and 100 mg/Kg/day in dogs). Therefore, the NOAEL doses were 200,300, and 30 
mg/kg/day  in  the  13-week  mouse  study,  the  26-week  rat  study,  and  the  9-month  dog  study, 
respectively. The avanafil margin at NOAEL was 9x in rats and 36x in dogs. 
In rats, as for mice, the liver was the primary target organ. In this organ as well as the thyroid (which 
exhibited  microscopic  changes  following  chronic  dosing),  the  Applicant  declares  that  the  effects  are 
considered  to  be  adaptive  or  compensatory  and  not  adverse.  It  is  accepted  that  centrilobular 
hepatocellular  hypertrophy  (related  to  liver  enzyme  induction)  is  not  an  adverse  change  and  that 
extramedullary haematopoiesis is a compensatory response to decreases in red blood cell parameters. 
The thyroid changes are likely a compensatory response to increased metabolism of thyroid hormones 
by the liver. 
The findings in the heart were unique to mice, but the other changes were consistent with the toxicity 
profile  in  the  other  nonclinical  species  following  repeated  dosing.  The  changes  in  electroretinograms 
were isolated (one-week rat study and one-week dog study) and not replicated in the chronic toxicity 
study. Further support for the low propensity of avanafil to produce visual disturbances comes from the 
excellent selectivity versus PDE6, where avanafil is more than 100-fold less potent than at PDE5, and 
the  relatively  superior  results  compared  with  sildenafil  observed  in  safety  pharmacology  studies 
examining retinal and ocular function. 
Dogs  exhibited  cardiovascular  effects  (increased  heart  rate  and  decreased  blood  pressure)  following 
administration of high doses of avanafil (100mg/kg/day) as  well as effects on body weight, as were 
noted in the rodent species. Microscopic changes were only noted in the one-week and 28-day studies, 
and  the  organs  and  findings  noted  were  not  consistent  and  were  not  observed  at  the  same  doses 
administered for longer durations (9-month study). The heart rate and blood pressure effects in animals 
likely  represent  an  exaggerated  pharmacological  response  to  avanafil,  since  the  drug  acts  via  a 
mechanism  of  vasodilatation,  and  that  similar  changes  were  also  noted  with  other  PDE5  inhibitors 
(tadalafil, vardenafil, sildenafil). 
As  regards  testicular  toxicity,  potential  target  organ  for  PDE-inhibitors,  there  was  no  indication  that 
avanafil adversely affects the testes in rats and dogs. Only in dog, coronary artery and arterioles of the 
epididymis at 100 mg/kg/day, was observed. 
Exposure  information  for  avanafil  was  obtained  from  single-dose  and  shorter-term  repeat  dose 
studies for rodent species, from pregnant rats and rabbits, and following chronic exposure in dogs. With 
repeated dosing, prolonged absorption was noted at high doses in most species. Cmax and AUC values 
increased with increasing dose; AUC tended to increase in a greater than dose proportional manner. 
Overall, repeated dosing did not affect the kinetic parameters in mice, rats, pregnant rabbits, and dogs 
for short-term treatment, but chronic dosing in dogs resulted in a slight decrease in exposure. The only 
indications of parent drug accumulation occurred in male rats and pregnant female rats at high doses in 
a toxicokinetic study.  
Genotoxicity 
Avanafil has been evaluated in a range of in vitro and in vivo tests to detect genotoxic activity, which is 
considered  appropriate.  Avanafil  was  not  mutagenic  in  Ames  assay;  it  was  not  clastogenic  in 
chromosome  aberration  assays  using  Chinese  hamster  ovary  and  lung  cells.  Although  avanafil  was 
positive  with  metabolic  activation  in  vitro  Mouse  Lymphoma  Cell  Gene  Mutation  Assay,  avanafil  was 
Assessment report 
EMA/299432/2013 
Page 22/112 
 
 
 
 
negative in the micronucleus test using male and female ICR mice and did not affect DNA repair when 
tested  in  the  rat  unscheduled  DNA  synthesis  assay.  Thus,  no  indication  for  a  genotoxic  hazard  was 
observed. 
Carcinogenicity 
Two long-term carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. Neither a 2-year study in rats 
nor a 2-year study in mice revealed a carcinogenic potential of avanafil up to and including the highest 
dose  tested.  Although  there  are  no  TK  data  in  the 2-year  carcinogenicity  studies  and  the  exposures 
estimations  calculated  by  the  Applicant  are  not  considered  appropriate,  considering  the  lack  of 
carcinogenicity in the two studies and that there are no concerns regarding this issue in other similar 
pharmaceuticals, this issue is considered solved. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Oral reproductive studies were performed in rat and rabbits including a fertility and general reproductive 
performance study in rats, embryofoetal development in rats and rabbits and prenatal and postnatal 
development, including maternal toxicity in rats.  
In  a  male  and  female  rat  fertility  study,  effects  on  sperm  (decreased  motility,  increased  abnormal 
sperm), a non-statistically significant decrease in fertility, and changes in oestrous cycling (increased 
length  of  cycle,  decreased  number  of  cycles),  were  observed  at  the  highest  dose  tested, 
1000 mg/kg/day. Based on the effects at 1000 mg/kg/day in both males and females, the NOAEL for 
both  parenteral  toxicity  as  well  as  fertility  and  reproductive  affects  was  determined  to  be  300 
mg/kg/day. The margin for avanafil was 9x and 190x over the human exposure in male and female rats, 
respectively, at the NOAEL dose. 
In a second fertility study in which only males were treated, there was no decrease in fertility, and after 
9-week of treatment a decrease in sperm motility and an increase in the percentage of abnormal sperm 
were observed at 1000 mg/kg/day. However, following the recovery period, there were no effects on 
sperm parameters demonstrating a complete reversibility of the sign. The section 4.6 of the SmPC was 
updated to include the lack of data on the effect on spermatogenesis in humans, the non-clinical data is 
referenced in section 5.3. Furthermore a study evaluating the effect on spermatogenesis in Humans will 
be performed as described in the risk management plan. 
An  embryofoetal  development  study  in  rats  produced  maternal  toxicity  at  1000  mg/kg/day  with  no 
increase in foetal malformations or variations, and a decrease in foetal body weight at 1000 mg/kg/day. 
One  high-dose  female  that  was  found  dead  had  total  litter  resorption  and  one  surviving  high-dose 
female  was  pregnant  by  stain  (total  litter  resorption).  Therefore,  the  NOEL  for  maternal  and 
developmental  toxicity  was  300  mg/kg/day.  In  pregnant  rabbits,  maternal  toxicity  was  evident  at 
240 mg/kg/day  due  to  mean  body  weight  gains  and  food  consumption  were  lower.  There  was  no 
developmental  toxicity  and  no  increase  in  the  incidence  of  foetal  malformations  or  variations  as 
compared  to  both  the  current  controls  and  the  historical  controls.  The  maternal  toxicity  NOEL  was 
120 mg/kg/day and the developmental toxicity NOEL was 240 mg/kg/day in pregnant female rabbits. 
Thus, for embryo-foetal development including teratogenicity, the avanafil margin at the NOAEL was 
121x in rats and 39x in rabbits. 
Finally,  in  a  pre-/post-natal  development  study  in  rats,  maternal  toxicity  was  observed  at 
600mg/kg/day  and  decreases  in  offspring  body  weight  and  weight  gain  were  reported  at  300  and 
600mg/kg/day with corresponding slight delays in markers of sexual maturation at 600mg/kg/day. The 
NOEL  for  growth  of  the  F1  generation  was  100mg/kg/day,  while  the  NOAEL  for  behaviour  and 
Assessment report 
EMA/299432/2013 
Page 23/112 
 
 
 
 
reproduction  in  the  F1  generation  was  600mg/kg/day.  Thus,  for  offspring  growth  and  maturation 
following maternal exposure to avanafil, the margin was 27x at the NOAEL dose. 
As  a  conclusion,  administration  of  avanafil  in  pregnant  rats  decreased  foetal  and  pup  body  weight 
occurred (with a concurrent delay in sexual maturation) at maternally toxic doses. But avanafil was not 
shown to be teratogenic in either rats or rabbits. As the therapeutic indication is directed to adult males 
only, the observed high dose effects on female reproduction and embryo-foetal development are not 
considered applicable in this case.  
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic data indicate that the safety margins in terms of unbound avanafil plasma exposure (AUC) 
in male rats were 9x for avanafil, 56x for M4, and 1x for M16. For dogs, the margin at the NOAEL was 36x 
for  avanafil.  Because  the  parent  drug  is  not  significantly  metabolized  in  dogs,  margins  were  not 
calculated for M4 and M16.  
In the first in man study  (Study HP-01) oral doses of 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, or 800 mg 
avanafil or placebo tablets under the fasted condition were tested. To determine the exposure margins 
between animal models and humans, a comparison was made between the AUC values at the NOAEL 
doses  in  non-clinical  chronic  toxicity  studies,  and  the  AUC  value  in  humans  at  the  maximum 
recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg. It should be noted that as reported in the SmPC, MRHD 
can be 400 mg (200 mg twice a day). 
Local Tolerance  
A local tolerance study was not conducted which was accepted by the CHMP. 
Other toxicity studies 
Juvenile animal toxicity studies are not deemed necessary given the intended therapeutic indication 
is for adult males only. 
Signs  of  immunotoxicity  were  observed  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies.  In  these  studies, 
immune-related organs (i.e., thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow) were weighed and evaluated 
microscopically and relevant haematology and clinical chemistry parameters (e.g., total and absolute 
differential  white  blood  cell  counts,  serum  globulins)  were  assessed.  No  avanafil-induced  effects 
suggestive of immunotoxic potential were observed in mice, rats or dogs given avanafil. 
The impurity I-C is specified at 0.30%, above the ICH threshold. In vitro genetic toxicity studies were 
conducted on Impurity I-C. This impurity was not genotoxic in the Ames and in vitro cytogenetic assay 
and this impurity is considered qualified in the general toxicology studies in rats and dogs. 
In the phototoxicity study, avanafil did not caused any change in the skin or eyes following the oral 
administration of single doses up to and including 1000 mg/kg as compared to positive control. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An interim environmental risk assessment (ERA) has been submitted by the Applicant. This interim ERA 
evaluates environmental fate and exposure concentrations that are a direct result of post-use consumer 
avanafil  (TA-1790)  releases  to  wastewater  treatment  plants  and  subsequent  release  to  the  aquatic 
environment. 
Due to the Phase I PEC surfacewater  estimate for avanafil was greater than 0.01 μg/L, a Phase II Tier A 
evaluation was performed. Assessment of the environmental impact showed that preliminary PEC/PNEC 
Assessment report 
EMA/299432/2013 
Page 24/112 
 
 
 
 
ratios for avanafil were much less than 1. Thus, the Applicant states that based on this interim ERA, the 
drug product is unlikely to cause adverse environmental effects. During the procedure the Applicant has 
changed the maximum recommended dose to 200 mg once per day instead of twice a day; therefore the 
PECsurfacewater estimate is 1 μg/L.  
The available data is summarised in Table 1. Adsorption-Desorption Test (OECD Method 121) has been 
performed by the Applicant. According to the guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), it is acknowledged 
that OECD 121 Method is not a batch equilibrium method and hence it cannot replace batch equilibrium 
experiments (OECD 106 or OPPTS 835.1110) and is only suitable for indicative purposes. The Applicant 
will need to provide an OECD 106 study, an OECD 305 study as well as the complete analytical report for 
the Daphnia sp. reproduction study.  
So  far,  available  data  do  not  allow  concluding  definitively  on  the  potential  risk  of  avanafil  to  the 
environment. According to the Applicant, all required laboratory testing and reporting will be completed 
by the end of 2013. The interim ERA report will be updated to incorporate all additional test results, and 
the final ERA report is expected to be submitted to EMA in February 2014.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The pharmacology development carried out with avanafil by the Applicant is considered appropriate since 
thorough information about pharmacology activity of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor as well as its 
effects on cardiovascular, respiratory, central nervous, ocular, gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems 
have been provided. The doses studied resulted in free plasma concentrations generally exceeding by the 
10-fold or more those associated with the MRHD.  
Results  of  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies  indicated  that  avanafil  is  an  inhibitor  of  the  cyclic  guanosine 
monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase5 (PDE5) enzyme, and is highly selective for the PDE5 
isoenzyme relative to other phosphodiesterases. Avanafil showed a more favourable profile against other 
enzymes known to be affected by this class of medicinal products, especially PDE6, where avanafil was 
more  than  100-fold less  potent  than  at  the  PDE5.  Therefore,  avanafil  had  a  low  propensity  for  visual 
disturbances. Avanafil displayed higher selectivity for PDE5 versus PDE6 (121-fold) as compared with 
sildenafil (16-fold) and vardenafil (21- fold) but much lower selective compared to tadalafil (550-fold). Its 
selectivity for PDE5 with respect to PDE1, PDE3 was similar to that showed by tadalafil, and much lower 
respect to PDE4 compared with tadalafil. 
For PDE5, the isozyme of primary interest, avanafil showed an in vitro potency (IC50=5.2nM) on PDE5 
particularly much lower than vardenafil (IC50=0.084 nM) and then sildenafil (IC 50=1.6nM), and lower to 
a lesser extent to tadalafil (IC50=4.0 nM). Thus, the high potency of avanafil claimed by the Applicant 
seems not supported. 
Avanafil  showed  to  be  less  potent  than  sildenafil  in  inducing  vasorelaxation  (higher  EC50  values  for 
CaCl 2).  The  vasorelaxation  effect  of  sildenafil  was  shown  to  be  concentration  dependent,  while  for 
avanafil it is not dose-dependently antagonized. This difference might be explained by the hypothesis that 
the  vasorelaxant  effect  of  higher  levels  of  sildenafil  is  mediated  by  mechanisms  other  than  the  PDE5 
inhibition effect (i.e. a direct blocking action on the L-type Ca2+ channel), in contrast with a specific PDE5 
inhibitor effect of avanafil. The Applicant carried out three in vivo studies examining the effects of avanafil 
and  a  positive  control  sildenafil  for  their  efficacy  in  increasing  penile  tumescence  in  rabbit,  dog  and 
monkey. Both avanafil and sildenafil produced a dose-dependent potentiation of penile tumescence.  
Pharmacokinetics 
The  ADME  properties  of  avanafil  have  been  evaluated  in  both  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies  and  are 
consistent  across  multiple  species  including  the  mouse,  rat  rabbit,  dog  and  monkey.  The  observed 
non-clinical pharmacokinetic properties of avanafil support the proposed dosing regimen for therapeutic 
use.  Avanafil  was  rapidly  and  relatively  well  absorbed  from  the  gastrointestinal  tract  after  oral 
administration in toxicology species and humans. Avanafil distributed rapidly to systemic tissues, with 
high  concentrations  mainly  in  liver.  The  conversion  of  avanafil  to  the  two  major  circulating  human 
metabolites, M4 and M16 was rapid and extensive in nonclinical species and humans (early t max and short 
t½); although in humans, avanafil still represented the major component in plasma. Although the amount 
of each metabolite varied among animal species (rat and dog), the metabolite profiles were similar and 
Assessment report 
EMA/299432/2013 
Page 27/112 
 
 
 
 
there  was  no  human  unique  metabolite  identified.  Since  M4  and  M16  are  those  metabolites  whose 
exposure in humans is greater than 10% respect to the parent compound exposure, they were the only 
one characterised from the PK point of view. 
CYP3A4 showed to catalyse the metabolism of avanafil, with a minor contribution by 2C. Avanafil was 
excreted primary into faeces mostly likely via bile. Avanafil and major metabolites had a low potential for 
causing pharmacokinetic drug interaction via CYP inhibition.  
In  vitro  results  showed  for  avanafil  high  membrane  permeability,  a  modest  potential  for  acting  as 
P-glycoprotein substrate and a relatively modest effect regarding the potential to act as a P-gp inhibitor 
with Digoxin as a substrate. The in vitro study suggests an inhibitory effect on avanafil on P-gp and based 
on intestinal concentrations (maximum dose/250 ml), a clinically relevant inhibitory effect on P-gp may 
not be excluded. Therefore, in the absence of data on humans, the potential of avanafil to interfere with 
the transport of other medicinal products mediated by P-glycoprotein is reported in SmPC section 4.5 and 
reflected in the RMP section 1.8. 
Toxicology 
The  non-clinical  toxicology  development  conducted  with  avanafil  provides  a  thorough  profile  of  the 
product in compliance with GLPs The dosing regimen employed in these studies provided constant tissue 
exposures and administered doses were more than 9-fold the intended dose in humans and provide an 
acceptable safety margin to the proposed maximum recommended human dose of avanafil (200mg). In 
addition, the duration of the toxicology studies are in accordance with the current requirements and the 
route of administration covers the oral administration intended for clinical use. 
Toxicity studies identify the liver as the primary target organ of avanafil. In this organ as well as the 
thyroid (which exhibited microscopic changes following chronic dosing), the main effects included body 
weight  decreases,  increased  liver  weight,  and  histopathological  changes  in  the  liver  consistent  with 
increased drug metabolizing enzyme activities are considered to be adaptive or compensatory and not 
adverse. It is accepted that centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy (related to liver enzyme induction) is 
not an adverse change and that extramedullary haematopoiesis is a compensatory response to decreases 
in  red  blood  cell  parameters.  The  thyroid  changes  are  likely  a  compensatory  response  to  increased 
metabolism of thyroid hormones by the liver. Significant adverse toxicity was only observed following the 
administration  of  high  doses  (2000  mg/kg/day  in  mice  and  100  mg/Kg/day  in  dogs).  Therefore,  the 
NOAEL doses were 200,300, and 30 mg/kg/day in the 13-week mouse study, the 26-week rat study, and 
the 9-month dog study, respectively. The safety margins in terms of unbound avanafil plasma exposure 
(AUC) in male rats were 9x for avanafil, 56x for M4, and 1x for M16; and in dogs were 36x for avanafil. 
During  the  development  of  avanafil,  cardiovascular  (blood  pressure  and  QT  prolongation)  and  ocular 
issues already identified with approved PDE5 inhibitors were addressed in safety pharmacology studies 
and in repeat-dose toxicity studies. Regarding ocular issues identified with the currently approved PDE5 
inhibitors, avanafil showed low propensity to produce visual disturbances due to the selectivity versus 
PDE6 (100-fold less potent than at PDE5). Furthermore, no changes in electroretinograms were observed 
in the chronic toxicity studies at doses up to 1000mg/kg/day (26-week study in rats and 9-month study 
in dogs). With regards to cardiovascular issues, dogs exhibited cardiovascular effects (increased heart 
rate and decreased blood pressure) following administration of high doses of avanafil (100mg/kg/day). 
Microscopic changes were only noted in the one-week and 28-day studies, and the organs and findings 
noted were not consistent and were not observed at the same doses administered for longer durations 
(9-month study). The heart rate and blood pressure effects in animals likely represent an exaggerated 
pharmacological response to avanafil since the drug acts via a mechanism of vasodilatation, and that 
similar changes were also noted with other PDE5 inhibitors (tadalafil, vardenafil, sildenafil).

Neither a 2-year study in rats nor a 2-year study in mice revealed a carcinogenic potential of avanafil up 
to and including the highest dose tested.  
A  decrease  in  fertility,  decreased  sperm  motility  and  an  increased  percentage  of  abnormal  sperm 
(primarily detached sperm tails) occurred at the highest dose tested in male rats (1000 mg/kg/day). The 
effects on sperm parameters, including sperm motility and morphology were completely reversible after 
the recovery period. Effects of avanafil on female reproduction included increased oestrous cycle length 
and reduced fertility in female rats at 1000 mg/kg/day. The margin for avanafil was 9x and 190x over the 
human exposure in male and female rats, respectively. In pregnant animals, decreased foetal and pup 
body weight occurred in rats (with a concurrent delay in sexual maturation) at maternally toxic doses, but 
avanafil was not teratogenic in either rats or rabbits. Given the indication for avanafil in males only, the 
high dose effects on female reproduction and embryofoetal development are not relevant to intended 
human  use.  The  section  4.6  of  the  SmPC  was  updated  to  include  the  lack  of  data  on  the  effect  on 
spermatogenesis  in  humans,  the  non-clinical  data  is  referenced  in  section  5.3.  Furthermore  a  study 
evaluating the effect on spermatogenesis in Humans will be performed as defined in the risk management 
plan. 
The impurity I-C is specified at 0.30%, above the ICH threshold. In vitro genetic toxicity studies were 
conducted on Impurity I-C. This impurity was not genotoxic in the Ames and in vitro cytogenetic assay 
and is considered qualified in the general toxicology studies in rats and dogs. 
An interim ERA presents a Phase II environmental fate and effects analysis, because the default predicted 
environmental concentration (PEC) of avanafil in surface water is greater than the Phase I screening level. 
According to the Guideline, the Phase II assessment should be conducted by evaluating the ratio of the 
predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) to the PEC. For this interim ERA, measured fate and effects data 
for avanafil are available from several screening studies recommended by EMA (2006). So far, available 
data  do  not  allow  concluding  definitively  on  the  potential  risk  of  avanafil  to  the  environment.  Certain 
aquatic fate and effects studies are in progress; the results from these studies will be assessed in the final 
ERA that will be submitted by the Applicant, although a schedule has not been provided yet. The ERA 
schedule  will  be  updated  upon  resolution  of  the  testing  requirements.  The  Applicant  will  update  the 
interim ERA report incorporating the additional test results required and submit it to the EMA in February 
2014. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A  nonclinical  testing  programme  was  performed,  generating  data  on  non-clinical  pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology of avanafil and was considered appropriate to support the granting of a 
marketing authorisation. 
Overall, the primary pharmacodynamics studies provided adequate evidence that avanafil is a selective 
PDE-inhibitor, less potent in terms of IC50 to the ones already approved and with higher selectivity for 
PDE5 versus PDE6 as compared with sildenafil, but lower as compared to tadalafil. Its selectivity for PDE5 
respect to PDE1, PDE3 was similar to that showed by tadalafil, and much lower respect to PDE4 compared 
with tadalafil. 
The  general  pharmacology  studies  showed  that  at  concentrations  comparable  to  the  free  plasma 
concentrations associated with the maximum tolerated dose of 200 mg, the ability to potentiate penile 
tumescence was demonstrated on different animal models (rabbit, dog, and monkey) but no conclusion 
on the faster onset respect to sildenafil can be drawn.

From the pharmacokinetic point of view, the avanafil was characterized by rapid and high oral absorption 
(53-69%), low to moderate oral bioavailability (1.5-30%), a t max 0.5–2hr, a t½ 0.82–2.5 h, and high 
systemic clearance in the rat, dog, and monkey. No accumulation effect was noted. 
Overall,  the  toxicology  program  revealed  no  new  toxicity  sign  for  this  new  PDE  inhibitor.  The  slight 
decreased motility and increased abnormal sperm observed in rat after 9 week administration of 1000 
mg/kg/day  was  completely  resolved  during  the  recovery  period.  Exposures  to  avanafil  in  pivotal 
toxicology  studies  were  ≥9-fold  over  the  human  exposure.  However,  since  the  duration  of  the 
spermatogenesis cycle in humans is about 90 days, chronic dosing is more appropriate to investigate the 
effects of avanafil on spermatogenesis. The Applicant is conducting a study in healthy adult male subjects 
as detailed in the RMP. 
So  far,  available  data  do  not  allow  concluding  definitively  on  the  potential  risk  of  avanafil  to  the 
environment. According to the Applicant, the ERA schedule will be updated upon resolution of the testing 
requirements, and potential risk to the environment of avanafil will be assessed with the full knowledge of 
the ERA. The final environmental risk assessment will be submitted to EMA in February 2014. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical development program to assess the efficacy and safety of avanafil in men with ED included 18 
Phase 1 studies, 3 Phase 2 studies, and 4 Phase 3 studies. These studies evaluated the pharmacokinetics, 
efficacy,  and  safety  of  avanafil  at  doses  ranging  from  12.5  mg  to  800  mg.  The  doses  for  which  the 
applicant  is  seeking  approval  are  50  mg,  100  mg,  and  200  mg.  All  of  the  studies  of  the  clinical 
development  program  were  conducted  in  various  centres  in  the  United  States,  with  exception  of  one 
phase 1 PK study (HP-01), which included  65 young (ages 18-35 years) healthy volunteers and it was 
conducted in France. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Eighteen  clinical  pharmacology  studies  have  been  completed  for  the  avanafil  development  program. 
These  studies 
investigated 
the  safety, 
tolerability,  pharmacokinetics,  pharmacodynamics, 
bioequivalence,  dose  equivalence,  effect  of  food  and  drug-drug  interactions  of  avanafil  in  healthy 
subjects, as well as pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of avanafil in special populations. 
A total of 680 subjects participated in the clinical pharmacology program with a total of 644 being exposed 
to at least one dose of avanafil. Doses of avanafil used ranged from 12.5 to 800 mg for single oral dose 
studies,  50  to  200  mg  for  once  daily  dosing  studies,  and  200  mg  for  twice  daily  dosing  studies.  For 
drug-drug interactions studies, 50 mg or 200 mg doses were used alongside usual therapeutic doses of 
the co-administered drug of interest. 
Absorption  
•  Bioavailability 
After oral administration of 14 C avanafil, the radioactivity was excreted faster in urine than in faeces. The 
highest mean concentration of total radioactivity was observed in urine within 4 hours after dosing and in 
faeces, for each 24-hour interval, between 48 and 120 hours after dosing. Mean recovery of administered 
radioactivity was approximately 62% in faeces and 21% in urine. Faecal excretion was the major route of 
elimination of radioactivity. Mean recovery of the radioactive dose through 216 hours after dosing was 
approximately 62% in faeces and 21% in urine. The recovery of total radioactivity in urine and faeces 
ranged from 85% to 94%, with the exception of one subject. The data indicated that avanafil is almost 
completely absorbed and eliminated. 
•  Bioequivalence  
The  study  of  bioequivalence  was  the  study  TA-020.  It  was  an  open-label,  randomized,  four-period 
crossover  study  were  designed  to  assess  to  determine  the  bioequivalence  of  two  avanafil  tablet 
formulations (2x100 mg Formulation I versus 2x100 mg Formulation II tablets) in the fasted state; and 
investigate the dose-proportionality of Formulation II avanafil tablets (1x50 mg versus 2x100 mg) in the 
fasted state.  
Bioequivalence  was  concluded  if  the  corresponding  90%  CIs  for  the  ratios  of  geometric  LS  Means  of 
Treatment A to Treatment C were contained within the range of 80% to 125% for each of the parameters. 
Assessment report 
EMA/299432/2013 
Page 32/112 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The statistical comparisons of avanafil Cmax and AUC0-inf between Treatment A (Formulation II) versus 
Treatment C (Formulation I) showed the 90% CIs of the geometric mean ratios of both Cmax and AUC0-inf 
were completely within the 90% CIs of 80% to 125%. Comparable systemic exposure to M4 and M16 
were also obtained between Formulations I and II under the fasted conditions. These results indicate that 
Formulation I is bioequivalent to Formulation II.  
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution was 47 to 83 l. (HP-01). The in vitro protein binding of avanafil to 
plasma proteins was determined by ultrafiltration method in human plasma over a concentration range of 
0.3  –  3.0  μg/mL.  The  plasma  protein  binding  was  consistent  over  the  avanafil  concentration  ranges 
investigated. Using equilibrium dialysis, avanafil, its two major circulating metabolites M4 and M16 were 
shown to have plasma protein binding of ~99%, ~97% and ~81%, respectively. 
The plasma protein binding was high for avanafil (≥99%) and M4 (>96%) and moderate for M16 (>80%) 
in these subjects, and the plasma protein binding for avanafil and its major circulating metabolites was 
independent of their total concentrations in plasma, age, renal and hepatic impairment. 
The amount of avanafil and its metabolites in seminal fluid of healthy subjects were determined in two 
clinical  pharmacology  studies  following  a  200  mg  avanafil  dose  (TA-014  and  TA-021).  The  mean 
amount of M16 found seminal fluid was comparable to that of M4, which was more than three times that 
of avanafil. The mean avanafil, M4 and M16 semen/plasma concentration ratios were fairly consistent 
between the two studies (approximately 0.07, 0.83, and 0.74, respectively for Study TA-014 and 0.06, 
0.70, and 0.37, respectively for Study TA-021). A very small fraction of the administered avanafil dose 
(≤0.0002%) was detected as unchanged avanafil in seminal fluid 45-90 minutes after dosing.

Elimination 
Excretion  
The excretion of avanafil were investigated in a 14C-labelled mass balance study (TA-010), in which a 
single  dose  of  600  mg  14C-avanafil  was  given  to  6  healthy  subjects.  Mean  recovery  of  administered 
radioactivity was approximately 62% in faeces and 21% in urine. Faecal excretion was the major route of 
elimination of radioactivity, with renal elimination playing a minimal role. Little or no total radioactivity 
was detected in blood and plasma after 10 hours. Maximal mean concentrations of radioactivity were 
observed at 1.2 hours after dosing, suggesting rapid absorption of [14C] - avanafil-related radioactivity. 
The mean terminal elimination t½ of unchanged avanafil in plasma was 12.7 hours, which contributed 
little to the total systemic exposure of avanafil. 
The shorter mean t½ of total radioactivity observed in blood and plasma (between 1 and 2 hours) likely 
represented a distribution phase rather than a true elimination phase. 
As shown in Studies HP-01 and TA-010, the mean terminal elimination t½ estimates were reported from 
6  to  17  hours.  The  large  variation  in  t1/2  across  studies  was  mostly  due  to  the  duration  of 
pharmacokinetic sampling in that plasma samples were collected out to 24 hours post dose in HP-01, 
while plasma samples collection was extended out to 168 hours post dose in TA-010. In Study TA-020, 
the plasma samples were collected up to 24 hours post dose in 23 subjects following oral administration 
of  the  proposed  commercial  formulation  (Formulation  II,  2x100  mg  tablets);  avanafil  t½  was 
approximately 3 to 5 hours. The avanafil T½ of 3 to 5 hours was verified by the fact that multiple-dose 
(QD or BID) administration of avanafil did not result in significant accumulation of avanafil (TA-02 and 
TA-07). 
•  Metabolism 
In  vitro  metabolism  studies  indicated  that  avanafil  was  extensively  metabolized  by  P450  isoforms, 
predominantly by CYP3A4, with a minor contribution by CYP2C.  
In vivo, following single oral dose of 200 mg, avanafil was extensively metabolized and formed the major 
circulating metabolites, M4 and M16. Both M4 and M16 reached their maximum plasma levels at a median 
tmax of approximately 0.8 hours (TA-014). The time course of the metabolites approximately paralleled 
avanafil.  The  metabolite/  parent  ratios  for  M4  (22  to37%)  and  M16  (about  32%)  across  clinical 
pharmacology  studies  generally  remained  comparable  and  were  not  dose-dependent  or  affected  by 
Assessment report 
EMA/299432/2013

hepatic impairment, renal impairment or age (M4 only). The ratios of M16/avanafil were slightly lower in 
young subject (32%) compared to elderly subjects (50 to 56%) (TA-014). 
The  M4  metabolite  showed  a  phosphodiesterase  selectivity  profile  similar  to  avanafil  and  an  in  vitro 
inhibitory potency for PDE5 at 18% of that for avanafil. Given its low plasma concentrations and lower 
potency  against  PDE5  compared  to  the  parent  compound,  the  contribution  of  M4  to  the  overall 
pharmacological activity against PDE5 after a single dose of avanafil was fairly limited, approximately 4% 
of total pharmacologic activity of the parent. The M16 metabolite was inactive against PDE5. 
In the TA-010 avanafil was extensively metabolized in humans; however, avanafil still represented the 
major radioactive component in plasma and accounted for approximately 37% of the total radioactive 
dose  within  the  0  to  12  hour  interval  after  dosing.  In  pooled  plasma  samples,  the  major  circulating 
metabolites  identified  were  an  open  pyrrolidine  ring  carboxylic  acid  avanafil  (M16)  and  monohydroxy 
avanafil (M4) which accounted for about 10.6% and 8.4%of the total radioactivity or 29% and 23% of the 
circulating  concentration  of  unchanged  avanafil,  respectively.  A  third  circulating  metabolite,  M27 
(despyrrolidine  avanafil),  accounted  for  about  3.8%  of  the  total  radioactivity,  or  10%  of  unchanged 
avanafil in humans. 
Since  avanafil  undergoes  significant  and  rapid  metabolism,  M27  is  not  considered  a  major  circulating 
human  metabolite  (<10%  radioactive  dose).  Plasma  concentration-time  profiles  of  the  metabolites 
appeared to be similar to avanafil. The M10 and M16 metabolites were the major metabolites in faeces; 
and M16 was the major metabolite excreted in urine. About6% of the radioactive dose was excreted as 
unchanged avanafil in faecal samples. Unchanged avanafil  was  not detected in pooled urine samples, 
indicating that renal impairment might have little effect on systemic exposure to avanafil. 
The  chromatographic  profile  of  the  radioactivity  in  human  plasma,  urine,  and  faeces  for  this  study 
revealed a metabolic pattern of primarily phase I metabolism, with only minor phase II metabolic species 
observed  in  the  3  matrices  examined.  The  pyrrolidine  ring  appeared  to  be  the  active  metabolic  site 
because  most  biotransformation/structural  modifications  occurred  on  that  ring.  The  major  routes  of 
biotransformation  were  proposed  as  the  following:  hydroxylation,  oxidation,  multiple  N-dealkylation 
reactions, demethylation, and glucuronide conjugation. 
Terminal  elimination  half  live  of  avanafil  could  be  estimated  to  be  around  6  hours  although  different 
studies show a high variability, ranging from very short half-lives to up to 17 hours, with some subjects 
showing very long terminal half-lives (more than 50 hours).

Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism 
Avanafil  is  mainly  metabolised  through  CYP3A4,  with  a  minor  contribution  of  CYP2C.  Its  limited 
contribution and the possibility to compensate lower metabolic rate via CYP3A4 make unlikely a relevant 
influence of genetic polymorphism on the elimination of avanafil and metabolites. 
Data from food-interaction studies  
A  formal  absolute  oral  bioavailability  study  has  not  been  performed.  The  influence  of  food  on  the 
absorption of avanafil was studied in two studies. The TA -020 was a Phase I, single-centre, open-label, 
Assessment report 
EMA/299432/2013 
Page 35/112 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
randomized,  and  four-period  crossover  study  to  assess  the  effect  of  food  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
avanafil. Subjects receiving treatment with food began eating a standardized high-fat breakfast 30 ± 5 
minutes prior to dosing. Standard meals were provided uniformly to all subjects at approximately 4 and 
9 hours after dosing, and an evening snack was provided approximately 12 – 13 hours after dosing. Blood 
samples for the determination of plasma avanafil and its metabolite concentrations were obtained from 
each subject at 0 (30 minutes predose), 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 hours 
postdose in each treatment period. 
The absence of a food effect was concluded if the corresponding 90% CIs for the ratios of the geometric 
LS Means of Treatment B to Treatment A were contained within the equivalence range of 80% to 125% for 
each of the parameters. 
The statistical comparison of avanafil Cmax for Treatment B (fed) versus Treatment A (fasted) showed 
that the 90% CIs of the geometric LS Means ratio was outside the 80% to 125% range. The % mean ratio 
of avanafil untransformed Cmax of 61.00% suggested that mean maximum avanafil exposure was lower 
following avanafil administered under fed versus fasted conditions. The difference of Tmax between the 
treatment A (0, 75 (0, 47-2, 0)) and the treatment B (2, 0 (1, 2-4, 0)) is significantly different. 
The other study for investigates the food effect on the pharmacokinetic of avanafil, after a high fat meal 
was the HP-01. Avanafil was given to the 6 volunteers who received 100 mg avanafil under fasting 
condition. 
Absorption of avanafil was delayed in the presence of food with T max observed between 1.25 and 4 hours 
compared to 0.25 in the fasting state. The difference was not statically significant Cmax decreased by 24 
%. This effect is supported by the 90 % confidence intervals (0.56-0.97) which are outside the 
(0.80-1.25) range. Conversely, food increased the mean AUC 0-t and AUC 0- inf, by the 25 % and 14 % 
respectively. This increase is supported by the 90 % confidence intervals, which are respectively 
(1.10-1.39) and (0.90-1.45). Mean terminal half-life of avanafil is lower after food intake (about 9 h) than 
in the fasted state (about 17 h). However, high mean value of T ½ in the fasted state can be mostly 
attributed to the high t ½ (49h) of one subject. When comparing the corresponding median values, which 
Assessment report

are more suitable for the comparison between two treatments, it turns that the observed differences are 
weak (12h versus 10h). 
In conclusion, the Cmax values were approximately 39% lower under fed conditions and the median tmax 
was delayed from less than 1 hour in fasted conditions to 2 hours (range 1.2 - 4h) after food intake.  
Given  the  type  of  medicinal  product,  route  of  administration,  and  target  population  the  section  4.2 
Posology in the PI was modified to advice of the delay on the onset of the effect if avanafil is taken with 
food, this was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies in special populations 
• 
Impaired renal function 
The impaired renal function was studied in the TA-013. The study compared the PK of avanafil in subjects 
with mild and moderate renal impairment (24 in total) to subjects with normal renal function and the 
secondary  objective  was  to  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  avanafil  in  subjects  with  mild  and 
moderate  renal  impairment.  The  design  was  open-label,  parallel-group,  single  dose,  nonrandomized 
study. The study population consisted of adult male subjects, 52 – 78 years of age, who were medically 
healthy with no clinically significant screening results (except for renal insufficiency in subjects in Cohorts 
2 and 3). Subjects with normal renal function (Cohort 1) were to have estimated CLcr of ≥ 80 mL/min. 
Subjects with renal impairment (Cohorts 2 and 3) met the following additional criteria: a) stable renal

impairment; b) subjects with mild renal impairment (Cohort 2) had a CLcr of ≥ 50 to < 80 mL/min; and 
c) subjects with moderate renal impairment (Cohort 3) had a CLcr of ≥ 30 to < 50 mL/min. 
Assessment report

There was no apparent effect of renal function on the pharmacokinetic parameters of avanafil and M4 
metabolite, while Cmax and AUC0-inf  of M16 were approximately 33% and 48% higher, respectively, in 
subjects with mild renal impairment compared to normal renal function. The M16 mean Cmax and AUC0-inf 
were approximately 25% and 135% higher, respectively, in subjects with moderate renal impairment 
compared to normal renal function. The plasma concentration ratios of M4/avanafil or M16/avanafil were 
fairly similar among the subjects with or without renal impairment, suggesting that the mild or moderate 
renal  impairment  had  little  impact  on  the  metabolite/avanafil  ratios  following  a  single  oral  dose  of 
avanafil. 
In  conclusion,  in  mild  renal  impairment  there  was  no  apparent  effect  on  avanafil  pharmacokinetic 
parameters while Cmax and AUC0-inf of M16 were approximately 33% and 48% higher, respectively, in 
subjects with mild renal impairment compared to normal renal function. The M16 mean Cmax and AUC0-inf 
were approximately 25% and 135% higher, respectively, in subjects with moderate renal impairment 
compared to normal renal function. These results should be interpreted in light of the limited or absent 
activity of metabolites M4 and M16 respectively. The pharmacokinetics of avanafil in patients with severe 
renal disease has not been studied, and therefore the product is contraindicated to patients with severe 
renal impairment in the SmPC.

Impaired hepatic function 
The  study  TA-012  was  the  primarily  aimed  to  assess  the  single  dose  PK  of  avanafil  in  subjects  with 
hepatic impairment and in healthy control subjects. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety

and  tolerability  of  avanafil  in  subjects  with  hepatic  impairment.  The  study  design  was  an  open  label, 
nonrandomized,  single-dose,  parallel-cohort,  matched-control  study.  In  this  study  participated  27 
subjects (nine subjects per cohort) were to be enrolled and dosed to achieve a total of 24 completed 
subjects (eight subjects per cohort). 
The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of avanafil was investigated in patients with 
mild (Childs-Pugh Class A) and moderate (Childs-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to healthy 
subjects following a 200 mg dose of avanafil.

The Cmax and AUC0-inf of avanafil and M4 were similar between subjects with mild hepatic impairment

respectively; in mild hepatic impairment subjects compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. 
Mean avanafil, M4, and M16 Cmax was approximately 57%, 54% and 28%, respectively, lower in patients 
with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, while AUC0-inf was 
mostly similar between the two groups of  subjects.  High protein binding for avanafil (>99%) and M4 
(>96%) and moderate protein binding for M16 (81% to 84%) was observed in subjects with normal, mild 
and moderately impaired hepatic function, indicating that mild or moderate hepatic impairment did not 
affect the plasma protein binding of avanafil, M4 or M16.

In the study TA-012 the exposure to plasma avanafil and M4  was similar between subjects with mild 
hepatic impairment and those with normal hepatic function. Moreover, the time to reach Cmax (i.e. tmax) 
and t1/2 values were not statistically different between the two groups of subjects. Exposure to plasma 
M16 was approximately 30 to 50% higher in subjects with mild hepatic impairment compared to those 
with normal hepatic function.  
The exposure to plasma avanafil, M4, and M16 as measured by Cmax was approximately 28 to 57% lower 
in  moderate  hepatic  impairment  subjects  compared  to  those  with  normal  hepatic  function.  However, 
mean AUC0-inf values were similar between the two groups of subjects and the differences in median 
tmax and t1/2 values for Avanafil between the two groups of subjects were not statistically significant. 
Plasma protein binding was independent of hepatic function.  
Therefore, dose adjustments are not required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  
Avanafil has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and therefore the product is 
contraindicated to patients with severe hepatic impairment in the SmPC.

Study  TA-014  was  a  single-center,  open-label,  non-randomized,  two-cohort,  single-dose  PK  study. 
Healthy young (18 - 45 years, inclusive) non-vasectomised male subjects (Cohort A, 18 enrolled to have 
at least 14 complete) and healthy elderly (65 year or older) male subjects (Cohort B, 14 enrolled to have 
at least 12 complete) were enrolled and given a single oral dose of 200 mg avanafil tablets following an 
overnight fast. Seminal fluid and plasma were collected from Cohort A, whereas only plasma samples 
were collected from Cohort B. All subjects were confined at the Clinical Research Unit approximately 12 - 
16 hours prior to the avanafil administration and remained confined for approximately 24 hours following 
oral dosing (Day 1). 
The primary objectives of this study were to determine avanafil semen exposure; to determine the acute 
effect of avanafil on sperm motility, count, density, morphology, vitality, ejaculate volume and viscosity; 
and to assess the effects of age on the PK of avanafil and its metabolites following a single oral dose of 
avanafil 200 mg.

Systemic exposures to avanafil, M4 and M16 were generally comparable in elderly (65 years or over) and 
young (18-45 years) subjects. The absorption and metabolism of avanafil to M4 and M16 was not greatly 
affected by age, as the median tmax and mean t½ values for avanafil, M4 and M16 were comparable 
between elderly and young subjects. The plasma Cmax and AUC0-inf ratios of M4/avanafil were fairly 
similar among young and elderly subjects, while the ratios of M16/avanafil were slightly lower in young 
subject (32%) compared to elderly subjects (50 to 56%). Plasma protein binding of avanafil for the two 
age  groups  was  high  (~99%),  and  it  was  independent  of  age  and  avanafil  plasma  concentrations. 
Collectively,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  avanafil  in  healthy  elderly  subjects  (65  years  or  over)  were 
comparable to those of younger males (18-45 years of age). No dose adjustment is needed for avanafil 
based on age.

A single oral 200 mg dose of avanafil appeared to be similarly tolerated by the young male subjects (18 
- 45 years, inclusive) and elderly male subjects (≥ 65 years) in this study.  
The pharmacokinetics of avanafil and its metabolites were generally comparable in elderly and young 
subjects, but the studies were conducted with a few patients older than 75 or very old.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
Caco-2 and P-glycoprotein transporter (Pgp) 
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the bidirectional Caco-2 permeability for avanafil, in the context 
of  the  Biopharmaceutics  Classification  System  (BCS).  For  this  purpose,  BCS  high  permeability 
(Metoprolol) and low permeability (Ranitidine) were included, and results compared to those for avanafil. 
Digoxin was included as a positive P-glycoprotein substrate control. 
In  Caco-2  cell  monolayers,  avanafil  was  observed  to  have  high  passive  permeability  with  a  mean 
absorptive, apical to basolateral apparent permeability (Papp) value of 44.6 × 10-6 cm/sec. The mean, 
secretory, basolateral to apical, Papp value of 73.4 × 10-6 cm/sec and an efflux ratio (RE) <2.0 suggests 
that avanafil is a weak substrate of P-glycoprotein. 
Additional studies conducted in multi-drug resistance gene (MDR1) and Madin-Darby canine kidney wild 
type  (MDCK-WT)  cells  showed  avanafil  to  be  a  weak  PGP  substrate.  The  efflux  ratio  of  ratios  (RE 
(MDR1)/RE (MDCK-WT), for avanafil was estimated to be 1.8, which is below the significance value of 2 
suggested by the FDA to definitively declare it a human PGP substrate. 
With regards to the potential for avanafil to act as a PGP inhibitor with digoxin as a substrate, the effect 
was relatively modest and there was no clear indication that avanafil is an inhibitor of PGP. With regards 
to the potential for drug-drug interactions in vivo, the possibility of interaction of avanafil with digoxin 
appeared to be remote. 
Based on these in vitro results, in vivo clinical pharmacology studies of the effect of PGP inhibition on 
avanafil pharmacokinetics or the effect of avanafil on PGP substrates such as digoxin were not considered 
necessary, the observed effect was relatively modest and there is no clear indication that avanafil is an 
inhibitor of PGP. While the PGP activity precludes its definitive designation in the context of the BCS, its 
overall BCS classification is likely Class I or Class II, depending on dose administered compared to its 
solubility value at pH 7. 
Human Cytochrome P450 isoforms 
Two different in vitro methods (immunoinhibition and metabolism by recombinant human cytochrome 
P450)  were  used  to  assess  metabolism  of  avanafil  by  P450  isoforms.  The  formation  of  the  major 
metabolites of avanafil was catalysed primarily by CYP3A4, with a minor contribution by CYP2C. 
For  CYP1A1/2-,  CYP2A6-,  CYP2B6-,  and  CYP2E1-catalyzed  reactions,  no  half  maximal  inhibitory 
concentration (IC50) could be determined for up to 100 μM avanafil. Based on the inhibition constants 
(Ki) and avanafil maximum observed plasma drug concentrations (Cmax) at 200 mg(2030 ng/mL or 4.2

μM),  there  is  a  low  potential  for  drug  interactions  with  substrates  ofCYP1A1/2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2E1,  and 
CYP2B6;  likely  interaction  with  substrates  of  CYP2C19;  and  possible  interaction  with  substrates  of 
CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C8/9. 
The metabolites of avanafil (M4, M16 and M27), also demonstrated a low potential to inhibit the activities 
of CYPs 1A, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. 
Based  on  these  in  vitro  findings,  clinical  pharmacology  studies  of  the  effect  of  CYP3A4inhibitors  on 
avanafil  pharmacokinetics  and  the  inhibitory  effect  of  avanafil  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  CYP2C9, 
CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 substrates were therefore evaluated in the clinical pharmacology 
program. 
In vivo 
Studies of drug interactions  
The study TA-011 was a single-center, open-label, randomized, one sequence crossover, three parallel 
group  study  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  the  moderate  (erythromycin)  and  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitors 
(ketoconazole and ritonavir) on the safety and pharmacokinetics of avanafil in healthy male subjects. A 
total  of  44  subjects  (mean  age  27.9  years;  range  21.0  -  43.0  years)  were  enrolled  and  41  subjects 
completed the study. 
Avanafil plus Ketoconazole 
Ketoconazole (400 mg daily), a selective and highly potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased avanafil 50 mg 
single dose exposure (AUC) and Cmax equal to 14-fold and 3-fold, respectively and prolonged the half-life 
of avanafil to approximately 9 hours. 
Avanafil plus Erythromycin 
Erythromycin  (500  mg  twice  daily)  increased  avanafil  200  mg  single-dose  Cmax  and  AUC  equal  to 
approximately 2 fold and 3-fold, respectively, and prolonged the half-life of avanafil to approximately 8 
hours. 
Avanafil plus ritonavir 
Ritonavir (600 mg twice daily), a highly potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, which also inhibits CYP2C9, increased 
avanafil 50 mg single-dose Cmax and AUC equal to approximately 2-fold and 13-fold, and prolonged the 
half-life of avanafil to approximately 9 hours.  
Avanafil is a substrate metabolised by CYP3A4.  Therefore, a formal contraindication is included in the 
case of concomitant use of avanafil and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in the SmPC. Precaution to patients 
taking  moderate  inhibitors  of  interaction  between  avanafil  and  moderate  CYP3A4  inhibitors  has  been 
included in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
Study  TA-04  was  a  double-blind,  randomized,  3-way  crossover  study  to  assess  the  hemodynamic 
response  to  sublingual  glyceryltrinitrate  in  subjects  receiving  avanafil,  sildenafil  citrate,  or  placebo. 
Following  a  single  oral  dose  of  100  mg  sildenafil  citrate,  200  mg  avanafil,  or  placebo,  subjects  were 
challenged  with  1  Nitrostat  (glyceryltrinitrate  tablet,  USP)  0.4  mg  (1/150  grain)  administered 
sublingually.

Avanafil with glyceryltrinitrate 
The conclusions of this study were avanafil and sildenafil were shown to potentiate the hypotensive effect 
of nitrates. Overall, 11 (12%) subjects with placebo, 15 (15%) subjects with  avanafil, and 28 (29%) 
subjects with sildenafil had clinically significant drops in standing SBP (30 mmHg) after glyceryltrinitrate 
administration. Clinically significant drops of blood pressure (>30 mmHg) after a 0,4 mg glyceryltrinitrate 
tablet were more frequent if avanafil or sildenafil had been taken before. The number (%) of subjects with 
symptomatic  hypotension  AEs  after  administration  of  glyceryltrinitrate  was  11  (11%)  for  placebo,  24 
(24%) for avanafil, and 26 (27%) for sildenafil. Thus, the occurrence of symptomatic hypotension AEs in 
male subjects administered avanafil coadministered with a sublingual dose of glyceryltrinitrate appears 
comparable to that of sildenafil with glyceryltrinitrate. 
The  SmPC  has  in  section  4.4  a  special  warning  on  the  hypotensive  effect  of  nitrates,  furthermore  in 
section 4.5 includes recommendation on the possible use of nitrates in case of a cardiovascular urgency 
patients  that  have  taken  a  dose  of  avanafil.  This  advice  also  includes  the  possible  duration  of  the 
hypotensive additive effect. 
The study TA-016 was a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover 
study to assess the potential interaction between avanafil and warfarin in  healthy male subjects. The 
primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  investigate  the  effect  of  avanafil  on  the  pharmacokinetics  and

pharmacodynamics (prothrombin time [PT] and international normalized ratio [INR]) of warfarin. The 
secondary objectives were to assess the effect of avanafil on platelet aggregation and to assess the safety 
and tolerability of co-administration of avanafil and warfarin. In addition, the effect of avanafil on colour 
discrimination was assessed. In total, 24 subjects were enrolled and 23 subjects completed the study. 
Avanafil and warfarin 
The Coax and AUC0-inf of R- and S-warfarin were not altered by co-administration with avanafil, as the 
90% CI of the geometric LS mean ratios of warfarin + avanafil and warfarin + placebo were inside the 
80% to 125% range. R- and S-warfarin tmax were not altered in the presence of avanafil. 
The EMA and AUEC0-168 of PT and INR changes from baseline were not altered by co administration with 
avanafil, as the 90% CI of the geometric LS mean ratios of warfarin + avanafil and warfarin + placebo 
were inside the 80% to 125% range. 
The  geometric  LS  mean  ratios  of  platelet  aggregation  parameters  Mein  and  EMA  between  warfarin  + 
avanafil and warfarin + placebo were completely within the 80 to 125% range. Moreover, mean changes 
from baseline platelet aggregation, ranging from 2.6 to 11.8% following warfarin + avanafil and ranging 
from 2.3 to 14.4% following warfarin + placebo, were similar. 
The analytical parameters of the Farnsworth-Mussel 100-Hue Test included total error score (a measure 
of the gross errors), square root transformed total error score, the C index (Confusion index, a measure 
of severity of a color loss), the S-index (Scatter index, a measure of degree of randomness or selectivity 
in  observers’  arrangement),  and  the  Angle  score  (a  measure  of  type  of  a  color  loss).  There  was  no 
statistically significant result in comparisons of post-dose (0.67 hour) values between the two treatments. 
Comparisons on changes from baseline between the two treatments in untransformed total error score, 
C- and S-indices, and the Angle, did not reach statistical significance either. One marginally significant 
p-value  was  observed  in  mean  change  in  square  root  transformed  total  error  score  in  the  analysis 
excluding  an  outlier.  The  overall  results  are  well  below  any  area  of  clinical  concern.  There  were  no 
suggestions  of  any  subtle  color  deficiencies  of  any  type  following  the  warfarin+avanafil  treatment 
compared to warfarin+placebo. 
Co-administration  of  avanafil  with  warfarin  had  no  effect  on  pharmacokinetics  of  R-  or  S  warfarin  or 
pharmacodynamics (PT, INR, and platelet aggregation) of warfarin. No impairment of color discrimination 
(blue/green), using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue Test was observed in this study. Once daily 200 mg 
oral dose of avanafil co-administered with a single 25 mg dose of warfarin was generally well tolerated by 
the healthy male subjects. In the TA-016, there was no significant effect of avanafil on the PK of R- or 
S-warfarin after a single dose of warfarin  
The anticoagulation therapy has recently changed, and new drugs have been approved for the same or 
similar use, e.g. dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban. Its metabolism is determined by the CYP3A4. A 
concern was raised regarding the possible interaction of avanafil with new anticoagulants and its clinical 
relevance. The Applicant discussed clopidogrel (an anti-platelet agent) and dabigatran (a direct thrombin 
inhibitor), concluding that currently there is no evidence to support any interaction of clinical relevance 
between  either  clopidogrel  or  dabigatran  and  any  PDE5  inhibitor.    Although  specific  interactions  of 
avanafil with rivaroxaban and apixaban (both CYP3A4 substrates) have not been studied, an interaction 
is not expected. This was considered is acceptable by the CHMP. 
The  Study  TA-017  was  a  single-center,  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  two-cohort, 
two-period  crossover  study  to  assess  the  hemodynamic  interactions  between  avanafil  and  two

α-adrenergic blockers (doxazosin and tamsulosin) in 48 (24 in each cohort) healthy male subjects (age 
46.5 years; range 40 – 61 years). 
Avanafil and doxazosin 
Subjects who entered into Cohort A received oral doses of doxazosin QD in the morning:1 mg for 1 day 
(Day 1), 2 mg for 2 days (Days 2 to 3), 4 mg for 4 days (Days 4 to 7), and 8 mg for 11 days (Days 8 to 
18). On Days 15 and 18, subjects also received a single oral dose of either avanafil 200 mg or placebo, 
according to the treatment randomization code. The avanafil or placebo doses were administered 1.3 
hours  after  the  doxazosin  administration  on  Days  15  and  18,  which  would  allow  doxazosin  (tmax  ~2 
hours) and avanafil(tmax ~0.7 hours) to reach their peak plasma concentrations at approximately the 
same time. 
The largest mean standing SBP decreases following co-administration of doxazosin with avanafil occurred 
from  Hours  0.5  to  1.75,  ranging  from  -3.6  to  0.3  mmHg.  Mean  standing  SBP  changes  from  baseline 
following placebo ranged from -4.5 to +1.6 mmHg over the same period. The largest mean standing DBP 
changes following avanafil occurred from Hours 0.5 to 1.25, and ranged from -8.5 to -5.2 mmHg. Mean 
DBP changes from baseline following placebo ranged from -0.5 to +1.9 mmHg over the same period. The 
largest  mean  changes  in  standing  pulse  rate  in  the  immediate  post-dose  period  following  avanafil 
occurred  from  hours  0.25  to  1.0,  ranging  from  +6.4  to  +10.2  bpm.  Mean  pulse  rate  changes  from 
baseline following placebo ranged from -5.0 to -3.2 bpm over the same period. 
No statistically significant differences were observed in the maximum change from baseline in standing 
SBP (p = 0.2114) or in the AUEC0-12 for standing SBP (p = 0.9737) following avanafil + doxazosin versus 
placebo  +  doxazosin.  Statistically  significant  differences  in  the  maximum  change  from  baseline  in 
standing DBP (p = 0.0003) and the AUEC0-12 for standing DBP (p = 0.0137) were observed following 
avanafil versus placebo. The differences in the LSM for maximum change in standing DBP and AUEC0-12 
for standing DBP were -6.42 mmHg and -32.17 mmHg•h, respectively. Likewise, statistically significant 
differences  in  the  maximum  change  from  baseline  in  pulse  rate  (p  =  0.0002)  and  the  AUEC0-12  for 
standing pulse rate (p = 0.0006) were observed following avanafil versus placebo. The differences in the 
LSM  for  maximum  change  in  standing  pulse  rate  and  AUEC0-12  for  pulse  rate  were  +7.21  bpm  and 
+44.54 bpm•h, respectively. 
A  highly  statistically  significant  difference  in  the  maximum  change  from  baseline  in  supine  SBP  (p  = 
0.0005) was observed following avanafil+doxazosin versus placebo+doxazosin. The difference in the LSM 
was -6.00 mmHg. No statistically significant difference was observed in the AUEC0-12 for supine SBP (p 
=  0.0968)  following  avanafil  versus  placebo;  the  95%  CI  of  the  difference  contained  zero  for  this 
comparison. Highly statistically significant differences in the maximum change from baseline in supine 
DBP (p = 0.0015) and the AUEC0-12 for supine DBP (p = 0.0034) were observed following avanafil versus 
placebo. The differences in the LSM for maximum change in supine DBP and AUEC0-12 for supine DBP 
were -3.58 mmHg and -31.40 mmHg•h, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed 
in maximum change from baseline in supine pulse rate (p = 0.2564) following avanafil versus placebo; 
the 95% CI of the difference contained zero for this comparison. However, a highly statistically significant 
difference in the AUEC0-12 for supine pulse rate (p <0.0001) was observed. The difference in the LSM for 
supine pulse rate AUEC0-12 was +45.84 bpm•h. 
A total of seven subjects in cohort experienced potentially clinically important absolute values or changes 
from baseline in standing SBP or DBP. Three subjects experienced standing SBP values <85 mmHg. One 
subject  experienced  a  decrease  from  baseline  in  standing  SBP  >30  mmHg  following  avanafil.  Two 
subjects  experienced  standing  DBP  values  <45  mmHg  following  avanafil.  Four  subjects  experienced 
decreases from baseline in standing DBP >20 mmHg following avanafil. One subject experienced such

decreases following placebo. There were no severe adverse events related to hypotension reported during 
the study. There were no cases of syncope. 
Avanafil and tamsulosin 
Subjects who entered into cohort B received oral doses of tamsulosin (0.4 mg daily) in the morning for 11 
consecutive days (Days 1 to 11). On Days 8 and 11, subjects also received a single oral dose of either 
avanafil  200  mg  or  placebo,  according  to  the  treatment  randomization  code.  The  avanafil  or  placebo 
doses were administered 3.3 hours after the tamsulosin administration on Days 8 and 11, which would 
allow  tamsulosin  (tmax  ~4  hours)  and  avanafil  (tmax  ~0.7  hours)  to  reach  their  peak  plasma 
concentrations at approximately the same time. 
On the α-adrenergic blocker plus avanafil/placebo treatment days (Cohort A, Days 15 and 18; Cohort B, 
Days 8 and 11), supine and sitting blood pressure and pulse rate measurements were recorded before 
avanafil or placebo dosing (the baseline value was the mean of three consecutive measurements 30, 20, 
and 10 minutes before dosing), then every 15 minutes for the first 2 hours, every 30 minutes for the next 
2 hours, hourly for the next 4 hours, and again at 10, 12, 18, and 24 hours after the avanafil or placebo 
dosing. Measurements were taken after subjects had been supine for at least 5 minutes. Subjects then sat 
for 1 minute and stood for 2 minutes before measurement of standing blood pressure and heart rate. 
The largest mean standing SBP changes following co-administration of tamsulosin with avanafil occurred 
from Hours 0.5 to 1.75, ranging from -6.3 to -2.3  mmHg. Mean standing SBP changes from baseline 
following placebo ranged from -2.6 to +1.2 mmHg over the same period. The largest mean standing DBP 
changes following avanafil occurred from Hours 0.75 to 1.25, ranging from -7.1 to -5.1 mmHg. Mean 
standing DBP changes from baseline following placebo ranged from -0.9 to +2.5 mmHg over the same 
period. The largest mean  changes in standing pulse rate in the immediate post-dose period following 
avanafil occurred from Hours 0.25 to 1.25, ranging from +5.0 to +8.0 bpm. Mean pulse rate changes 
from baseline following placebo ranged from -2.9 to +1.8 bpm over the same period. 
No statistically significant differences were observed in the maximum change from baseline in standing 
SBP (p = 0.1101) or DBP (p = 0.0835), the AUEC0-12 for standing SBP (p = 0.8047) or DBP (p = 0.1094), 
or  the  maximum  change  from  baseline  in  standing  pulse  rate  (p  =  0.1913)  following  avanafil  versus 
placebo.  The  95%  CIs  of  differences  contained  zero  for  all  of  these  comparisons.  Differences  in  the

AUEC0-12  for  standing  pulse  rate  following  avanafil  versus  placebo  were  marginally  statistically 
significant (p = 0.0471). The difference in the LSM for this parameter was +31.56 bpm•h, with a 95% CI 
of 0.44 - 62.68 bpm•h. 
The largest mean supine SBP changes following avanafil occurred from hours 0.25 to 1.5, ranging from 
-4.9 to -3.3 mmHg. Mean supine SBP changes from baseline following placebo ranged from -0.2 to +1.8 
mmHg over the same period. The largest mean supine DBP changes following avanafil occurred from 
hours 0.25 to 1.5, ranging from -4.5 to -3.2 mmHg. Mean supine DBP changes from baseline following 
placebo ranged from 0 to +1.9 mmHg over the same period. The largest mean changes in supine pulse 
rate in the immediate post-dose period following avanafil occurred from hours 0.25 to 1.0, ranging from 
+4.9 to +8.4 bpm. Mean pulse rate changes from baseline following placebo ranged from -1.8 to -0.2 
bpm over the same period. 
No statistically significant differences were observed in the maximum change from baseline in supine SBP 
(p = 0.0580), AUEC0-12 for supine SBP (p = 0.6023), or AUEC0-12 for supine DBP (p = 0.3439). The 
95% CIs of differences contained zero for all of these comparisons. A statistically significant difference in 
the maximum change from baseline in supine DBP (p = 0.0392) was observed following avanafil versus 
placebo. The difference in the LSM was -3.33 mmHg. Statistically significant differences in the maximum 
change from baseline in supine pulse rate (p = 0.0344) and AUEC0-12 for supine pulse rate (p = 0.0013) 
were observed following avanafil versus placebo. The differences in the LSMs for these parameters were 
+4.67 bpm and +40.76 bpm•h, respectively. 
A total of five subjects in Cohort B experienced potentially clinically important absolute values or changes 
from  baseline  in  standing  SBP  or  DBP.  Two  subjects  experienced  standing  SBP  values  <85  mmHg 
following avanafil dosing. One subject experienced a decrease from baseline in standing SBP >30 mmHg 
following avanafil dosing. Two subjects experienced standing DBP values <45 mmHg following avanafil 
dosing. Four subjects experienced decreases from baseline in standing DBP >20 mmHg following avanafil 
dosing; one subject experienced such decreases following placebo. There were no severe adverse events 
related to hypotension reported during the study. There were no cases of syncope.

Interaction study of avanafil with tamsulosin and doxazosine (study TA-017) did not show statistically 
significant effect on standing SBP but an effect was seen on decreasing DBP (supine and standing) and 
supine SBP, with increase in heart rate. Return to baseline was observed by 3 -5 hours post-avanafil. 
A  number  of  subjects  in  both  cohorts  (tamsulosin  and  doxazosine)  experienced  potentially  clinically 
important absolute changes from baseline or low BP values in standing SBP or DBP (e.g. Decrease of  > 
30 mm Hg in SBP or DBP values <45 mm) 
There is a warning in the SPC about avanafil co-administration with alpha-blockers. Patients should be 
stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating treatment with avanafil, avanafil should be initiated at 
the 50 mg dose and observation is needed because some patients could experience decreases of blood 
pressure clinically relevant. 
Study TA-018 was a single-center, three-cohort, open-label, crossover study to determine the effect of 
avanafil on the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole (a 2C19 substrate), desipramine (a 2D6 substrate), and 
rosiglitazone (a 2C8 substrate) in healthy male subjects. In total, 60 subjects (20 per cohort, mean age 
30.8 years; range 20 – 44 years) entered and 57 subjects completed the study. The potential effect of 
CYP inducers on the pharmacokinetics of avanafil was not evaluated. The concomitant use of avanafil and 
a CYP inducer is not recommended as it may decrease the efficacy of avanafil. 
Based on in-vitro studies, avanafil is a potential inhibitor of CYP 2C19, 2C8, 2C9 and 2D6. Interaction 
studies  have  been  performed  evaluating  the  effect  of  avanafil  on  specific  substrates  (e.g.  omeprazol, 
rosiglitazone,  desipramine)  as  well  as  with  digoxine  to  explore  effect  through  pGp  transporter.  The 
studies evaluated the effect of single doses of avanafil 200 mg on other medicines pharmacokinetics, 
which is well in accordance with the expected use of avanafil but could have explored the full potential for 
interaction. 
Avanafil and omeprazole 
Subjects received oral doses of omeprazole 40 mg QD for 8 days (Days 1 to 8) plus a single oral dose of 
avanafil 200 mg on Day 8. 
Co-administration of avanafil and omeprazole did not alter the omeprazole pharmacokinetic parameters 
AUC0-tau, as the 90% CI of the geometric LS mean ratios of omeprazole + avanafil versus omeprazole 
were inside the 80% to 125% range. A slight higher Cmax (16.7%; 90% CI 99.68-136.70) of omeprazole 
was observed in the presence of avanafil. Avanafil had no effect on omeprazole tmax or t1⁄2.

Study TA-018 showed that a single avanafil 200 mg dose did not affect the AUC of omeprazole (40 mg 
daily),  a  CYP2C19  substrate.  A  17%  increase  in  omeprazole  Cmax  was  observed  in  the  presence  of 
avanafil. This slight change in omeprazole Cmax is not considered clinically significant. 
Avanafil and rosiglitazone 
Subjects were randomized to receive a single oral dose of rosiglitazone 8 mg or a single oral dose of 
rosiglitazone  8  mg  plus  a  single  oral  dose  of  avanafil  200  mg.  The  two  treatments  in  Cohort  B  were 
separated by a washout period of at least 7 days. 
The Cmax and AUC0-inf of rosiglitazone were not altered by co-administration with avanafil, as the 90% 
CI of the geometric LS mean ratios of rosiglitazone + avanafil versus rosiglitazone were inside the 80% to 
125% range. Rosiglitazone tmax or t1⁄2 was not altered in the presence of avanafil.

Avanafil and desipramine  
Subjects were randomized to receive a single oral dose of desipramine 50 mg or a single oral dose of 
desipramine 50 mg plus a single oral dose of avanafil 200 mg. The two treatments in  Cohort C were 
separated by a washout period of at least 10 days. 
The Cmax and AUC0-inf of desipramine were not altered by co-administration with avanafil, as the 90% 
CI of the geometric LS means ratios of desipramine+avanafil versus desipramine were inside the 80% to 
125% range. Desipramine t max or t1⁄2 was not altered in the presence of avanafil. 
Study  TA-019  was  a  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  two-period,  two-cohort  crossover 
study  to  investigate  the  pharmacokinetic  and  hemodynamic  interactions  between  avanafil  and  two 
common  blood  pressure  medications,  enalapril  and  amlodipine,  in  healthy  male  subjects.  The  study 
consisted of two independent cohorts. In total, 48 subjects (mean age 48.9 years; range 40 – 63 years) 
enrolled (24 subjects in each cohort) and 47 completed the study. 
Avanafil and enalapril 
Subjects received oral doses of enalapril 10 mg every 12 hours for 11 days. On Days 8 and 11, subjects 
also received a single oral dose of either avanafil 200 mg or matching placebo 2 hours after the morning 
dose of enalapril according to the randomization scheme. 
A  single  dose  of  200  mg  avanafil  co-administered  with  enalapril  caused  a  mean  maximum  change  in 
supine blood pressure of -1.75/-3.46 mmHg (compared to placebo), accompanied by a mean maximum 
change in pulse rate of +0.96 bpm. 
Assessment report 
EMA/299432/2013

Single doses of 200 mg avanafil co-administered with enalapril caused a mean maximum decrease in 
supine blood pressure of 2/3 mmHg (compared to placebo). A statistically significant difference in the 
maximum  decrease  from  baseline  in  supine  DBP  (a  secondary  endpoint)  was  observed  following 
co-administration of avanafil with enalapril versus placebo with enalapril. Supine DBP returned to baseline 
by 4 hours post-avanafil dosing. A syncope episode and a few potentially clinically important changes 
were observed in healthy volunteers who participated in this study. 
Avanafil and amlodipine 
Subjects received a single oral dose of avanafil 200 mg on Day 1. Beginning on Day 3, subjects received 
oral doses of amlodipine 5 mg QD in the morning for 18 days (Days 3 to 20). On Days 12 and 19, subjects 
also received either a single oral dose of avanafil 200 mg or matching placebo 2 hours after the dose of 
amlodipine according to the randomization scheme. 
A single dose of 200 mg avanafil co-administered with amlodipine caused a mean maximum change in 
supine systolic blood pressure of -1.18 mmHg (compared to placebo), accompanied by a mean maximum 
change in pulse rate of +1.00 bpm; the mean maximum change in diastolic blood pressure was less than 
that observed in the placebo group. 
Co-administration  of  avanafil  with  amlodipine  did  not  alter  the  pharmacokinetics  of  amlodipine. 
Concomitant  amlodipine  was  associated  with  28%  and  60%  increases  in  Cmax  and  AUC0-inf, 
respectively, of avanafil. These increases in avanafil exposure in the presence of amlodipine at the 5 mg 
dose are considered of minimal clinical significance.

Administration  of  avanafil  200  mg  in  healthy  volunteers  treated  with  amlodipine    show  a  very  little 
augmentation of the blood pressure decrease (-1,18 mmHg as compared to avanafil + placebo) with no 
symptomatic or relevant decreases of BP.  
No pharmacokinetic interaction on amlodipine was seen after a single dose of avanafil, which could not be 
expected anyway. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
The results from in vitro information from human biomaterial studies established the basis of the clinical 
pharmacology studies of avanafil.  
Avanafil  and  its  major  metabolites,  M4  and  M16,  are  highly  and  reversibly  bound  to  plasma  proteins 
(10-AVANAFIL-PK-12). Binding of avanafil is predominantly to albumin (99%), and less so to γ-globulin 
(43%) or α1-acid glycoprotein (66%).  
Accordingly, drug-drug interactions via displacement of protein bound drugs are likely with avanafil and 
this was explored in specific human in vivo studies.  
In vitro studies showed that avanafil is a weak substrate of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) (10-AVANAFIL-BCS-01) 
(10-AVANAFIL-PGP-01). In a study to examine the potential for avanafil to act as a Pgp inhibitor with 
digoxin as a substrate, there was no clear indication of an effect (10-AVANAFIL-PGP-01). Accordingly, 
interactions  at  the  level  of  Pgp  are  not  expected  with  avanafil  and  no  specific  in  vivo  studies  were 
performed this was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
In vitro studies using pooled human liver microsomes demonstrated that avanafil has potential to inhibit 
CYP2C19 activity and possible potential to inhibit CYP3A4, CYP2C8, 300 mg) in the treatment of mild to 
moderate ED. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary pharmacology 
The primary pharmacodynamics of avanafil was evaluated in a single-blind, randomized, crossover study 
in subjects with ED using  the RigiScan device and visual sexual  stimulation (VSS) (TA-01).  This is a 
validated method to evaluate the effect of avanafil on penile erection and allows the measurement of time 
to rigidity, duration, frequency, and degree of rigidity and tumescence of the penis. A cut-off of at least 
60% rigidity was used for the efficacy endpoints as this is considered the minimum rigidity necessary for 
successful vaginal penetration and sexual intercourse. 
Avanafil was superior to placebo on all measures, this reaching statistical significance for most efficacy 
endpoints.  The  results  of  this  Phase  2  study  demonstrated  that  avanafil  is  superior  to  placebo  in  the 
endpoints  of  time  to  ≥   60%  rigidity,  duration  of  ≥   60%  rigidity,  maximum  rigidity,  TAU,  RAU,  and 
responses to the 5-point EAS. 
Statistical  superiority  of  avanafil  treatments  compared  to  placebo  was  in  general  associated  most 
frequently with the earliest time interval, 20–40 minutes after dosing. During this 20-40 minute interval 
the  majority  of  efficacy  endpoints  for  the  50  mg,  100  mg,  and  200  mg  avanafil  treatments  were 
statistically superior to placebo (p < 0.05). While all avanafil treatments showed some degree of efficacy 
during the middle (60–80 minute) interval, avanafil 200 mg continued to show superiority vs. placebo 
during the latest (100–120 minute) interval. There is a good concurrence among results for variables of 
effect. 
Assessment report 
EMA/299432/2013 
Page 55/112 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sildenafil arm showed also superiority to placebo and similar magnitude of effect than avanafil. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Visual Function 
As a class, PDE5 inhibitors may have an effect on visual function, probably due to the fact that PDE6, 
which is involved in photo transduction in the retina, may be inhibited to a certain degree, particularly 
with less selective PDE5 inhibitors. 
Non-clinical studies with avanafil showed weaker effects on photo transduction in isolated rabbit retina 
than those of sildenafil, no drug-induced changes in ERG waves in dogs, and no effect on flicker –induced 
ERG in anaesthetized dogs. 
The TA-016was a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover drug 
interaction study with at least a 21-day washout period. 
One of the secondary objectives was to evaluate the effect of avanafil on color discrimination. The color 
vision test (Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue Test) was performed and the results are reported. The analytical 
parameters  of  Farnsworth-Munsell  100-Hue  Test  included  total  error  score  (a  measure  of  the  gross 
errors), square root transformed total error score, the C index (Confusion index, a measure of severity of 
a color loss), the S-index (Scatter index, a measure of degree of randomness or selectivity in observers’ 
arrangement),  and  the  Angle  score  (a  measure  of  type  of  a  color  loss).  There  was  no  statistically 
significant  result  in  comparisons  of  post  dose  (0.67  hour)  values  between  the  two  treatments. 
Comparisons on changes from baseline between the two treatments in untransformed total error score, 
C- and S-indices, and the Angle, did not reach statistical significance either. One marginally significant 
p-value  was  observed  in  mean  change  in  square  root  transformed  total  error  score  in  the  analysis 
excluding an outlier. The overall results do not lead to a clinical concern. Suitable cautionary statements 
in the SmPC regarding contraindication in patients with known hereditary retinal degenerative disorders, 
including  those  with  disturbance  in  PDE,  such  as  retinitis  pigmentosa  has  been  included  in  SmPC. 
Although the results of the trial demonstrated no impairment of colour discrimination this effect should be 
further investigated as described in the risk management plan. 
Sperm Function 
Some PDE5 inhibitors may have the potential to affect spermatogenesis. In non-clinical reproductive and 
developmental toxicity studies, a statistically significant decrease in sperm motility and an increase in 
percentage of abnormal sperm (primarily detached sperm tails) were observed. The sperm function was 
assessed in two studies in healthy adult male subjects (TA-014) (TA-021).  
The study TA-014 was a single-center, open-label, non-randomized, two-cohort, single-dose PK study. 
Healthy young (18 - 45 years, inclusive) non-vasectomized male subjects (Cohort A, 18 enrolled to have 
at least 14 complete) and healthy elderly (65 year or older) male subjects (Cohort B, 14 enrolled to have 
at least 12 complete) were enrolled and given a single oral dose of 200 mg avanafil tablets following an 
overnight fast. Seminal fluid and plasma were collected from Cohort A, whereas only plasma samples 
were collected from Cohort B. 
The primary objectives of this study were 1) to determine avanafil semen exposure; 2) to determine the 
acute  effect  of  avanafil  on  sperm  motility,  count,  density,  morphology,  vitality,  ejaculate  volume  and 
viscosity. 
The mean sperm motility did not change by ≥ 20% from baseline (Day -4) and there was no acute effect 
on morphological normal forms, sperm count, sperm concentrations and forward progress. Within the

context of this study design, no significant changes regarding sperm function in the majority of subjects 
were observed. 
The TA-021 was a single-center, double blind, two-period, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover, 
and single-dose study. Eighteen (18) healthy (18 - 45 years, inclusive) non-vasectomized male subjects 
were planned to be enrolled. The objectives of this study were 1) to determine the acute effect of avanafil 
on sperm motility, count, density, morphology, vitality, ejaculate volume, and viscosity following a single 
oral dose of 200 mg avanafil in healthy male subjects and 2) to determine avanafil and metabolites semen 
and  plasma  exposure.  Mean  values  for  all  semen  parameters  (sperm  concentration,  sperm  motility, 
forward progression, total sperm count, sperm morphology, and total motile sperm count) were within 
normal limits at the Day 1 postdose assessment for both treatment groups. There were no subjects in 
either  treatment  group  who  experienced  a  ≥  50%  decrease  from  baseline  in  total  motility,  forward 
progression, or WHO calculated forward progression. Additionally, there was no statistically significant 
difference (p > 0.05) in the LS Means in change from baseline for total motility, forward progression, or 
WHO calculated forward progression percentages, comparing the avanafil and placebo treatments.

No relevant effects on sperm motility, morphology, count or WHO calculated forward progression were 
observed after a single oral dose of 200 mg avanafil.  
Effects on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate 
The  hypotensive  effect  of  avanafil  has  been  very  modest  in  studies  in  healthy  volunteers,  with  mean 
maximal decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 0.6mmHg and 2.4 mmHg, respectively. 
Nevertheless attention should be paid on this hypotensive effect in special populations (e.g. elderly) and 
to possible relevant interactions with other hypotensive medicines or substances (see 2.2.6) 
Effects on INR and Platelet Aggregation

Effect  on  platelet  aggregation  was  studied  as  secondary  objective  in  a  sildenafil-warfarin  interaction 
study, comparing the collagen-induced platelet aggregation after 3 days of avanafil 200 mg daily or after 
placebo. In both days this was assessed after a single dose of warfarin. 
There was no apparent effect on platelet aggregation.  
QT Prolongation 
A thorough QT/QTc study was performed that conformed to the requirements of ICH E14 –“The Clinical 
Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs” 
(TA-140). 
The TA-140  was performed in a double-blind (except for the use of moxifloxacin), randomized, single 
site,  and  four-arm  crossover  design  in  healthy  male  subjects.  The  central  electrocardiogram  (ECG) 
laboratory (eResearchTechnology, Inc. [eRT], Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA) was blinded to treatment. 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  whether  treatment  with  a  therapeutic  (100  mg)  or 
supratherapeutic (800 mg) dose of avanafil had the potential to cause QT/QTc prolongation in healthy 
volunteers. 
In the pharmacodynamics analysis, the primary QT to QTc correction formula was determined for each 
subject  by  iterating  the  QT-RR  relationship  using  the  48  pre-treatment  baseline  ECGs  and  all  of  the 
posttreatment placebo period ECGs in order to find an estimate for the exponent such that the slope of 
this relationship was closest to zero. 
QTcI is the individually determined QT correction, and the goal is to find β such that QTcI is a constant, 
where  QTcI  =  QT  /  (RR)  β.  This  implies  log  (QTcI)  =  log  (QT)  -  β×log  (RR).  Because  log  (QTcI)  is  a 
constant, one can re-write this equation as log QT = α +β×log (RR). Therefore, the exponent estimate can 
be  obtained  by  numerical  iteration  such  that  slope  for  QT-RR  relationship  is  closest  to  zero  or  using 
regression analysis on log-transformed data based on the least squares approach. 
Additional correction formulae included but considered secondary are QTcF and QTcB. 
The  results  pharmacodynamics  were  that  the  placebo  baseline  adjusted  change  for  HR  using  a 
time-averaged basis showed a +0.6 bpm increase for moxifloxacin and a +0.5 bpm change for the clinical 
dose  of  avanafil,  all  clinically  not  significant.  For  the  supratherapeutic  dose  of  avanafil  there  was  an 
average +5.3 bpm increase with a marked increase in the first 1 to 3 hours exceeding 10 bpm, which is 
clinically  important.  There  were  also  3  (5%)  tachycardic  outliers  demonstrated  only  for  the 
supratherapeutic  avanafil  dose  again  highlighting  this  effect.  This  change  can  affect  the  QTc 
determination. The mean change from baseline placebo corrected for the 2 avanafil doses demonstrated 
a -0.4 msec and -1.9 msec decrease in PR duration and +0.1 msec and +0.2 ms for QRS duration. No 
outliers were identified. These changes are of no clinical relevance. 
Avanafil with alcohol 
The concomitant use of alcohol (0,5g/Kg of weight) with avanafil produces in healthy volunteers a small 
additive effect on the hypotensive effect of avanafil (around 3mm Hg more decrease with the combination 
than with avanafil alone). It appears reasonable to advice in the SPC and the PIL about the increase of 
potential for symptomatic hypotension if avanafil is taken with alcohol.

Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
The  hypotensive  effect  of  avanafil  has  been  very  modest  in  studies  in  healthy  volunteers,  with  mean 
maximal  decreases  in  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  of  0.6mmHg  and  2.4  mmHg,  respectively. 
Nevertheless attention should be paid on this hypotensive effect in special populations (eg. elderly) and 
to  possible  relevant  interactions  with  other  hypotensive  medicines  or  substances.  For  specific 
considerations on nitrates, doxazosin, tamsulosin, enalapril and amlodipine refer to the above section on 
drug interactions. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Avanafil has a good oral bioavailability and after oral administration, avanafil Tmax is around 30- 45 min.  
Avanafil  is  extensively  metabolized  by  P450  isoforms,  predominantly  by  CYP3A4,  with  a  minor 
contribution by CYP2C. Mean terminal half-life is around 6 hours, although different studies show a high 
variability, ranging from very short half-lives to up to 17 hours. There is influence of the food intake in the 
absorption of avanafil in the sense of delaying absorption, this information is included in the SPC and PIL 
as  it  could  modify  the  time  to  reach  the  effect  after  dosing.  The  pharmacokinetics  of  avanafil  and  its 
metabolites were generally comparable in elderly and young subjects, but the studies were conducted 
with few patients older than 75 or very old patients. 
Based on the data from the dedicated hepatic study (TA-012), which included subjects with mild (n=8) 
and  moderate  (n=8)  hepatic  impairment,  PK  in  subjects  with  mild-moderate  hepatic  impairment  was 
comparable to those with normal liver function, with the exception of a 28-57% lower Cmax for subjects 
with moderate impairment. No significant differences in AE profile were noted.  
The applicant provided as well a discussion on the observed decreased efficacy in subjects with mild renal 
impairment.  The  Applicant  hypothesized  that  the  observed  differences  are  likely  related  to  greater 
impairment  of  vascular  or  nerve  function  in  this  subset  of  patients  compared  to  the  general  study 
population, in a manner similar to diabetics or prostatectomized subjects, making them less responsive to 
pharmacological treatment for ED. This explanation seemed reasonable.  
The applicant performed thorough QT/QTc study accordingly with the ICH topic E14 ”Note for guidance on 
the clinical evaluation of QT/QTc interval prolongation and proarrythmic potential for non antiarrhytmic 
drugs (CHMP/ICH/2/04)” in order to determine whether the drug has a threshold pharmacologic effect on 
cardiac repolarization, as detected by QT/QTc prolongation. The threshold level of regulatory concern, 
discussed further below, is around 5 ms as evidenced by an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval 
around the mean effect on QTc of 10 ms.  
As the QT interval has an inverse relationship to heart rate, the measured QT intervals are generally 
corrected for heart rate in order to determine whether they are prolonged relative to baseline. Various 
correction  formulae  have  been  suggested,  of  which  Bazett’s  and  Fridericia’s  corrections  are  the  most 
widely used and the preferred method.  
A single dose of 100 mg, or a supratherapeutic dose of 800 mg avanafil, were investigated for their ability 
to cause QT/QTc prolongation. No adverse effects were observed for 100 mg avanafil. There were marked 
increases  in  heart  rate  over  10  bpm  in  subjects  receiving  800  mg  for  1-3  hours  after  dosing  that 
confounded interpretation of the effects of this dose due to invalidation of QTcB as well as individual QTc 
correction during this time. Nevertheless, there was no specific evidence for an effect of this high dose of 
avanafil on cardiac repolarisation except at the 3 hour time point which had an upper CI of 10.2 msec.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of avanafil and its metabolites were generally comparable in elderly and young 
subjects, but the studies were conducted with few patients older than 75 or very old patients. 
Based on the limited data available, it is recommended to start with the minimum efficacious dose and 
adjusting posology based on tolerance and this is reflected in the SPC.   
Furthermore, the observed decrease in efficacy in subjects with renal impairment is reflected in the SPC. 
The Applicant presented data using QTcI. To rule out any effect of Avanafil on QTc, the Applicant has been 
recommended at post-authorisation to present data for each quartile of QTc values. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Introduction 
The Phase 3 clinical studies included one study in the general population with ED (TA-301), one study in 
diabetic men with ED (TA-302), one study in males with ED following nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy 
(TA-303) and one open label extension study to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of avanafil 
(TA-314). Collectively, these studies randomized a total of 1334 subjects. 
Dose-response study  
The TA-05 study was a multicentre, double-blind, randomized, parallel-design phase 2 study designed to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of various doses of avanafil in the treatment of mild to moderate ED. 
Subjects were eligible for inclusion if they had a history of mild to moderate ED with duration of at least 
6 months and who were in a monogamous heterosexual relationship for at least 3 months. Subjects with 
diabetes and subjects with ED caused by spinal cord injury or radical prostatectomy were excluded from 
participation.  
The study consisted of a 4-week (non-treatment) run-in period, followed by a 12-week treatment period. 
Eligible subjects were assigned randomly in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the following treatments: placebo, 
avanafil 50 mg, avanafil 100 mg, avanafil 200 mg,  or avanafil 300 mg. During the treatment period, 
subjects were instructed to take 1 dose (2 capsules) of study drug with water approximately 30 minutes 
prior  to  initiation  of  sexual  activity.  Subjects  were  instructed  to  refrain  from  large  meals,  alcohol,  or 
grapefruit juice consumption from 2 hours before study drug until 2 hours after dosing.  
Subjects were instructed to complete a diary entry for each attempt at sexual activity during both the 
run-in and active treatment periods. Subject in the pivotal phase III studies were to complete the same 
diary questions, which included the following 7 items: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Date and time of study drug administration; 
2. Date and time of sexual activity initiation; 
3. Were you able to achieve some erection (some enlargement of the penis)? (yes or no); 
4. Were you able to insert your penis into your partner’s vagina? (yes or no) (Sexual  
Encounter Profile [SEP] question 2); 
5. Did your erection last long enough for you to have successful intercourse? (yes or no) 
(SEP3); 
6. Were you satisfied with your erection? (yes or no);

 
7. Were you satisfied overall with your sexual experience? (Yes or no). 
Subjects also completed the IIEF questionnaire at baseline (prior to randomization) and at each follow-up 
visit during treatment. 
The  main  objective  of  study  TA-05  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  various  dose  levels  of 
avanafil in subjects with mild to moderate ED. 
The three primary efficacy endpoints were: 
  Success rate of subject’s responses to SEP2: “Were you able to insert your penis into your 
partner’s vagina?” 
  Success rate of subject’s responses to SEP3: “Did your erection last long enough for you to have 
successful intercourse?” 
 
EFS of the IIEF Questionnaire. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints included assessments of the following: responses to secondary Subject 
Diary questions, responses to individual questions from the IIEF questionnaire, responses to the GAQ. 
The safety assessments included AEs, vital sign changes, laboratory results, and physical examination 
findings. 
Efficacy analyses were performed on the ITT (subjects who attempted and reported at least one sexual 
encounter  with  study  medication)  and  PPP  (all  subjects  who  reported  using  at  least  6  doses  of  study 
medication  during  treatment)  populations.  The  efficacy  analyses  based  on  the  ITT  population  were 
considered the primary analysis. Safety analyses were performed on the ITT population. 
The  statistical  analyses  were  reported  using  summary  tables  and  data  listings.  Statistical  testing 
(including testing of statistical assumptions) other than interaction testing were two-sided and performed 
at the 0.05 alpha level. Interaction testing was performed at the 0.10 alpha level. Tests were declared 
statistically significant if the calculated p-value was ≤ 0.10 for interaction testing and ≤ 0.05 for all other 
tests. All analyses and tabulations were performed using SAS® Version 8.2 on a PC platform. Continuous 
variables were summarized with means, standard deviations (SD), medians, minimums, and maximums. 
Categorical  variables  were  summarized  by  counts  and  by  percentage  of  subjects  in  corresponding 
categories.  All  raw  data  obtained  from  the  CRFs,  as  well  as  any  derived  data,  were  included  in  data 
listings.  
For Subject Diary-based endpoints, the desired sample size of at least 50 subjects in each of the 5 dose 
groups  would  provide  90%  power  for  detecting  a  difference  between  proportions  characterized  by  a 
variance of 0.154 and an average proportion of 0.5 among the dose groups using the Chi-square test at 
a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. For EFS, a one-way analysis of variance would have 90% power to detect 
an effect size across the 5 dose groups. It was estimated that approximately 17% of subjects might have 
some  degree  of  incomplete  data.  Therefore,  the  total  sample  size  was  determined  to  be  250  to  300 
subjects. 
Results 
A total of 460 subjects were screened for study TA-05. Two hundred ninety-five (n=295) subjects were 
randomized, including 59, 57, 61, 59, and 59 subjects in the placebo, and 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 
300 mg avanafil treatment groups, respectively. A total of 284 (96.3%) subjects attempted and reported 
at  least  one  sexual  encounter  with  study  medication  and  were  included  in  the  ITT  population.  This

population included 55 (93.2%), 56 (98.2%), 60 (98.4%), 56 (94.9%), and 57 (96.6%) subjects in the 
placebo, and 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg avanafil treatment groups, respectively. A total of 263 
(89.2%) subjects used at least 6 doses of study medication during treatment and were included in the PPP 
population.  
Prior to randomization, 165 subjects were considered screen failures. Of the 295 subjects randomized, 
249  (84.4%)  completed  the  treatment  protocol.  Forty-six  (15.6%)  subjects  did  not  complete  the 
protocol.  The  reasons  for  discontinuation  included  withdrawal  by  subject  (26,  8.8%  subjects),  AE  (5, 
1.7%  subjects),  protocol  violation  (1,  <1%  of  subjects),  non-compliance  (2,  0.7%  subjects),  lost  to 
follow-up (10, 3.4% subjects), and lack of efficacy (2, 0.7% subjects). There were no deaths. 
In  regards  to  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics,  subjects  in  the  ITT  population  were 
predominantly Caucasian (85.6%) with a mean age of 56.1 years (range 32 to 70 years). Demographic 
profile was similar across treatment groups, with exception of a higher percentage of Caucasians in the 
placebo  group  compared  with  the  avanafil  200  mg  group  (94.5%  Caucasians  vs.76.8%  Caucasians, 
respectively).  The  mean  weight  and  height  for  the  ITT  population  were  93.7  kg  and  178.5  cm, 
respectively,  and  were  similar  across  treatment  groups.  The  mean  duration  of  ED  was  66.7  months 
(range = 6 months to 30 years) and was similar across treatment groups. The aetiology of ED for most 
subjects was organic (57.7%), with 5.3% due to a psychological aetiology and 36.6% having ED of a 
mixed aetiology. The majority of subjects experienced ED of moderate severity (84.9% subjects) with a 
gradual onset (94.0% subjects).  
At least 40% of subjects in the ITT population had  a medical history for the  following body systems: 
urogenital  (76.1%);  head,  ears,  eyes,  nose,  and  throat  (55.6%),  musculoskeletal  (54.2%),  and 
gastrointestinal system (47.9%). The majority of subjects (251 subjects, 88.4%) in the ITT population 
had previously been treated for ED; these treatments included oral medication (87.3%), intracavernosal 
injections (12.3%), vacuum pump/band (4.9%), and Muse® (4.6%).  
The demographic and Baseline (Screening) characteristics of the PPP population were similar to those of 
the  ITT  population  and  no  statistically  significant  differences  in  Baseline  characteristics  between 
treatment groups were identified. 
Co-primary endpoints results 
The percentage level of attempts where subjects achieved erections enabling vaginal penetration (SEP2) 
during the Treatment Period was: 76.1% for avanafil 50 mg, 79.2% for 100 mg, 79.8% for 200 mg, and 
83.7% for 300 mg, versus 60.5% for placebo. For each avanafil dose, penetration success rates during 
treatment were statistically significant when compared to placebo. Change from Baseline in penetration 
success rates were 8.4% for avanafil 50 mg, 17.5% for 100 mg, 13.0% for 200 mg, and 20.9% for 300 
mg, versus 4.2% for placebo. Only the 100 mg and 300 mg avanafil doses had statistically significant 
changes from baseline in penetration success rates compared to placebo.

The  percentage  level  of  attempts  resulting  in  erections  lasting  long  enough  for  successful  intercourse 
(SEP3) during the treatment period was: 53.4% for avanafil 50 mg, 58.6% for 100 mg, 62.1% for 200 
mg, and 64.3% for 300 mg, versus 28.9% for placebo. For each dose of avanafil, intercourse success 
rates  were  statistically  significant  when  compared  to  placebo.  Change  from  Baseline  in  intercourse 
success rates were 32.2% for avanafil 50 mg, 39.6% for 100 mg, 41.7% for 200 mg, and 46.1% for 300 
mg, versus 12.1% for placebo. For each dose of avanafil, the change from baseline in intercourse success 
rate during treatment was statistically significant when compared to placebo.

Table 7 Overall Erectile Function Domain Score (ITT Population) 
EFS scores at the end of treatment were 19.4 for avanafil 50 mg, 22.3 for 100 mg, 22.4 for 200 mg, and 
22.5 for 300 mg, versus 16.9 for placebo. Change from baseline in EFS scores were 3.2 for avanafil 50 
mg, 6.1 for 100 mg, 5.9 for 200 mg, and 6.0 for 300 mg versus 1.1 for placebo. For each dose of avanafil, 
the change from Baseline in EFS score was statistically significant when compared to placebo. 
Results of the secondary endpoints generally supported the co-primary endpoints results. 
In  regards  to  safety,  the  observed  AE  profile  was  generally  consistent  with  results  noted  in  previous 
studies. The AE most frequently reported by each avanafil group was headache. Headache and flushing 
occurred more frequently in avanafil groups than in placebo and tended to increase in frequency with 
increasing  dose.  Headache  (the  most  frequently  reported  treatment-related  AE)  was  considered 
treatment related for 2 (3.6%) subjects in the placebo group and 4 (7.1%), 7 (11.7%), 7 (12.5%), and 
15 (26.3%) subjects in the avanafil 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg groups, respectively. 
Main studies 
Methods 
The efficacy and safety of avanafil on an as needed basis in men with ED has been evaluated in three 
pivotal randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week, parallel-design studies (studies TA-301, 
TA-302 and TA-303). Of the 3 pivotal studies, 2 of them were performed in specific populations: study 
TA-302 enrolled diabetic subjects (T1DM or T2DM) with mild to severe ED; study TA-303 enrolled subjects 
with mild to severe ED following bilateral nerve sparing radical prostatectomy. The designs of the three 
studies are similar hence they will be described together.

Study Design Schematic (TA-301) 
Study Design Schematic (Studies TA-302 and TA-303) 
In all studies, there was a 4-week baseline period without ED therapy, followed by a 12-week treatment 
period. Subjects who met the initial eligibility criteria entered the 4-week, non-treatment run-in period 
and were instructed to record information on each of their attempts at sexual intercourse. At the end of 
the run-in period, subjects were eligible for randomization to treatment if they met the following criteria: 
documented  at  least  4  attempts  at  sexual  intercourse  during  the  run-in  period;  failed  to  maintain  an

erection of sufficient duration to have successful intercourse (as documented in the subject diary during 
the run-in period) for at least 50% of their attempts; and had an IIEF erectile function domain score of 5 
to 25, inclusive. Subjects that met eligibility criteria were randomized to placebo or different doses of 
avanafil (100mg or 200mg in TA-302 and TA-303; 50mg or 100mg or 200mg in TA-301). 
Study participants  
Inclusion Criteria 
The pivotal studies enrolled males 18-70 years of age at the time of screening; with mild to severe ED of 
at least 6 months duration, defined as the inability to achieve vaginal penetration on at least 50% of 
attempts  at  sexual  intercourse  without  the  use  of  medical  therapy;  in  a  monogamous,  heterosexual 
relationship for at least 3 months; with willingness and ability to provide informed consent; willingness 
and ability to comply with all study requirements; agreement to make at least 4 attempts at intercourse 
per  month;  and  agreement  not  to  use  any  other  treatments  for  ED  during  the  study.  Because  the 
response to treatments for ED in patients with diabetes or prostatectomy may differ from those in the 
general ED population, diabetics and the post-prostatectomy population were studied separately (Studies 
TA-302 and TA-303, respectively). 
In the post-prostatectomy study (TA-303), additional inclusion criteria were: patients with a history of ED 
of  at  least  6  months  following  bilateral  nerve-sparing  radical  prostatectomy;  history  of  bilateral 
nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy for localized carcinoma of the prostate at least 6 months prior to 
screening;  prostate  carcinoma  stage  ≤pT2  and  Gleason  score  ≤7  (4  +  3);  PSA  level  at  screening 
consistent with the absence of residual prostate cancer; and history of sexual potency prior to radical 
prostatectomy (not needing treatment/product or device for ED).  
Exclusion criteria 
General  exclusion  criteria  common  to  the  3  phase  III  pivotal  studies  included:  patients  with 
cardiovascular illnesses within the preceding 6 months (such as myocardial infarction, stroke, high-risk 
arrhythmia  or  ECG  judged  by  the  investigator  to  be  clinically  significant,  coronary  revascularization, 
unstable  angina,  angina  with  sexual  intercourse,  congestive  heart  failure,  clinically  significant 
cardiomyopathy, moderate or severe cardiac valvular disease) were excluded from the studies. Other key 
exclusion  criteria  included:  retinitis  pigmentosa  or  non-arteritic  anterior  ischemic  optic  neuropathy; 
advanced neurologic degenerative disease;  ED after spinal cord injury, penile anatomic abnormalities; 
uncontrolled hypertension, hypotension, orthostatic hypotension or evidence of cerebral hypoperfusion 
upon standing from a seated position; treatment with nitrates, CYP3A4 inhibitors, antiandrogen therapy, 
androgen  replacement  therapy  not  stable  for  at  least  3  months,  or  initiation  or  dose  change  of  an 
alpha-adrenergic antagonist within 14 days prior to randomization; patients with abnormal liver function 
test (AST, ALT >2 × ULN), or severe renal failure (serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dl, estimated creatinine 
clearance <60 mL/min [Cockcroft-Gault]) were also excluded. Patients with history of hypersensitivity to 
avanafil or other PDE5 inhibitors; dose-limiting AEs with a PDE5 inhibitor or history of treatment failure 
with other PDE5 inhibitors were not eligible for inclusion in the 3 main efficacy studies. 
In  protocol  TA-302,  which  included  diabetics,  patients  with  a  history  of  3  or  more  episodes  of 
hypoglycaemia  requiring  assistance  within  the  last  2  years;  uncontrolled  diabetes  (haemoglobin  A1c 
[HbA1c] >9%); fasting blood glucose >270 mg/dL were excluded. Patients with diabetic complications, 
such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy and/or diabetic autonomic neuropathy with clinically significant 
gastroparesis were not excluded from participation.

In  protocol  TA-303  (patients  with  history  of  radical  prostatectomy)  additional  exclusion  criteria  were: 
history  of  severe  ED  requiring  routine  medical  therapy  prior  to  bilateral  nerve-sparing  radical 
prostatectomy; history of previous pelvic surgery, brachytherapy, or cryotherapy of the prostate. 
Treatments 
Different doses of avanafil or placebo were to be taken on demand, approximately 30 minutes before 
sexual activity. No restrictions were placed on the timing of avanafil dosing relative to the consumption of 
food or alcohol. Subjects were permitted to take up to two doses of study drug in a 24-hour period at least 
12 hours apart. Subjects were not to take more than two doses of study drug in a 24-hour period. 
Antidepressants,  other  than  trazodone,  were  permitted  during  the  study.  Subjects  on  hormone 
replacement therapy or alpha-adrenergic antagonists were required to be on a stable regimen for at least 
3 months and 14 days prior to entry into the study, respectively. However, if alpha blocker therapy was 
initiated during the study, treatment was to begin with the lowest available dose. 
During the course of the study, subjects were not allowed to take the following medications: nitrates; 
trazodone; any drugs known to interfere with metabolism by the CYP3A4 enzyme (such as Ketoconazole, 
Erythromycin, protease inhibitors, Cimetidine); Spironolactone; Phentolamine; Papaverine; Alprostadil; 
other PD5 inhibitors; and any prescription, over-the-counter, herbal, or naturopathic products for “male 
enhancement” or the treatment of ED. 
In the post-prostatectomy study, subjects may have been previously treated with alprostadil and/or PDE5 
inhibitors following prostatectomy but such treatments must have been discontinued prior to beginning 
the 4-week run-in period of the study. The use, duration, and end date of any such treatments were to be 
recorded in the subject’s medical history.  
Objectives 
The objectives of the pivotal studies were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of avanafil in subjects with 
mild  to  severe  ED  in  the  general  population  (TA-301),  diabetics  (TA-302)  or  post-prostatectomy 
(TA-303). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
 
Primary endpoints 
Three co-Primary efficacy parameters were used in the pivotal studies: 
Change  in  the  percentage  of  sexual  attempts  between  the  run-in  period  and  the  12-week  treatment 
period  in  which  subjects  were  able  to  maintain  an  erection  of  sufficient  duration  to  have  successful 
intercourse (question 3 of the Sexual Encounter Profile [SEP3]: “Did your erection last long enough for 
you to have successful intercourse?”); 
Change  in  the  percentage  of  sexual  attempts  between  the  run-in  period  and  the  12-week  treatment 
period in which subjects were able to insert the penis into the partner’s vagina (question 2 of the Sexual 
Encounter Profile [SEP2]: “Were you able to insert your penis into your partner’s vagina?”); 
Assessment report 
EMA/299432/2013 
Page 68/112 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Change in International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) erectile function domain score from baseline to 
the end of the 12-week treatment period. 
The IIEF is a 15-item questionnaire, self-administered measure of erectile function. The 15 items cover 
five domains: erectile function (6 items), orgasmic function (2 items), sexual desire (2 items), intercourse 
satisfaction (3 items), and overall sexual satisfaction (2 items). This questionnaire was completed at each 
study visit and subjects were to self-evaluate their erectile function over the previous 4-week period. 
Depending on the responses, each question could be scored from 0 to 5, or 1 to 5, with 0 for no attempt 
at sexual intercourse.  
 
Secondary endpoints 
The main secondary efficacy variables were the same in the pivotal studies: 
•    Changes in IIEF domain scores and individual responses from baseline to Week 4, Week 8, Week 
12, and end of the 12-week treatment period; 
•    Changes  in  the  percentages  of  successful  or  satisfied  responses  to  secondary  subject  diary 
questions between the run-in period and the 12-week treatment period;  
•    Subjects  assessed  their  overall  response  to  treatment  by  answering  Global  Assessment  and 
Future  Use  questions  at  the  end  of  treatment  (Visit  5,  Week  12  or  Early  Termination).  The 
questions pertained to effectiveness of treatment (“Has the treatment you have been taking 
over the past study interval improved your erections?”) and future product use (“If the study 
treatment were available today, would you buy it?”). 
Sample size 
The sample size estimation was based on the three co-primary efficacy endpoints for the Phase 3 pivot 
studies. Estimates from the results of study TA-05 were used for sample size calculation. In study TA-05, 
the average standard deviation for the change in the percentage of subjects able to insert their penis into 
their partner’s vagina was approximately 32. It was calculated that with 125 (in TA-302) or 150 subjects 
(in TA-301) in each treatment group, the studies had more than 90% power to detect a mean difference 
of 13% by a two-tailed t-test with a 5% type I error. In study TA-05, the average standard deviation in 
the  change  in  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  an  erection  of  sufficient  duration  to  have  successful 
intercourse was approximately 33. With 125 (in TA-302) and 150 subjects (in TA-301) in each treatment 
group, it was estimated that the studies had more than 90% power to detect a 13% difference in response 
rate  between  two  treatment  groups.  In  TA-05,  the  average  standard  deviation  in  the  change  in  IIEF 
erectile  function  domain  score  was  approximately  7.0  points.  With  125  (in  TA-302)  150  subjects  (in 
TA-301) in each treatment group, the studies had more than 90% power to detect a mean difference of 
3 (TA-301) to 5 (TA-302) points in ED domain score between two treatment groups. 
In  study  TA-303  (post-prostatectomy  study),  the  sample  size  estimation  was  also  based  on  all  three 
primary efficacy endpoints for the study, and conservative estimates from the results of a previous study  
with vardenafil in patients with either bilateral or unilateral nerve-sparing prostatectomy were used for 
sample  size  calculation.  Due  to  difference  between the  two  studies,  the  standard  deviations  from  the 
vardenafil study results were increased (by 40%) in the sample size calculation for study TA-303, and the 
calculations  were  based  on  a  two-sided  test  with  a  5%  type  I  error.  In  the  vardenafil  study,  a  mean 
difference of 25.7% in the percentage of successful insertions during the 12-week treatment period was 
observed, with a standard deviation of 41. For study TA-303, a sample size of 100 subjects per group 
should have more than 86% power to detect a mean difference of 25.7% for the change in the percentage 
of successful insertions between the run-in period and the 12-week treatment period, given a standard 
Assessment report

deviation of 57.4 (41×1.4). In the vardenafil study, a mean difference of 24.3% in the percentage of 
successful  intercourse  attempts  during  the  12-week  treatment  period  was  observed,  with  a  standard 
deviation of 40. For study TA-303, a sample size of 100 subjects per group, should have more than 86% 
power to detect a mean difference of 24.3% for the change in the percentage of successful intercourse 
attempts between the run-in period and the 12-week treatment period, given a standard deviation of 56.0 
(40×1.4). In the vardenafil study, a mean difference of 6.1 in the IIEF erectile function domain score at 
Week 12 was observed, with a standard deviation of 8.4. For study TA-303, a sample size of 100 subjects 
per  group  should  have  more  than  86%  power  to  detect  a  mean  difference  of  6.1  in  the  change  from 
baseline to the end of treatment in the erectile function domain score, given a standard deviation of 11.8 
(8.4×1.4). 
Randomisation 
In the general population study (TA-301), eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of 
the following treatments: placebo, avanafil 50 mg, avanafil 100 mg, or avanafil 200 mg. In the other 2 
pivotal studies (TA-302 and TA-303), eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the 
following treatments: placebo, avanafil 100 mg, or avanafil 200 mg.  
In  the  3  pivotal  studies,  randomization  was  stratified  using  a  centralized,  computer-generated 
randomization system by disease severity as determined by IIEF erectile function domain scores at the 
randomization visit. 
Blinding (masking) 
The  3  pivotal  studies  were  double-blind  studies,  in  which  investigators  and  subjects  were  blinded  to 
treatment assignment. Blinding was not to be broken during the study unless considered necessary by the 
investigator or medical monitor for management of an adverse event or other medical emergency. 
Statistical methods 
The  analysis  population  for  all  efficacy  evaluations  is  the  Intent-to-Treat  (ITT)  Population.  The  ITT 
Population included all randomized subjects who took at least 1 dose of study drug (as reported in the 
subject diary) and had at least one post-dosing efficacy assessment.  
The evaluable Population (per-protocol population) was defined as all subjects in the ITT Population who 
reported using at least 6 doses of study drug during the treatment period and had at least 4 attempts at 
sexual intercourse during the non-treatment run-in period. 
The Safety Population was defined as all subjects who took at least one dose of study drug and had safety 
data available. The Safety Population was used for all safety analyses.  
Analysis  of  each  primary  efficacy  variable  was  performed  using  an  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA) 
model with treatment, baseline erectile dysfunction severity category, and study as factors and baseline 
value as the covariate. For each treatment group, the least-squares (LS) mean, corresponding standard 
error, and two-sided p-value for the change in each primary efficacy variable were obtained. For each 
treatment comparison of interest, the difference in LS mean, corresponding standard error, two-sided 
95% confidence interval, and two-sided p-value were derived from the ANCOVA model. 
Assessment report 
EMA/299432/2013

A  step-down,  multiple-comparison  procedure  was  used  to  compare  the  efficacy  of  each  avanafil  dose 
group with placebo. In the 3 pivotal studies, comparison started with the high-dose group (avanafil 200 
mg). If the statistical comparison of the high-dose treatment with placebo was statistically significant at 
the  5%  significance  level  using  a  two-tailed  test  for  all  three  co-primary  efficacy  variables,  then  the 
efficacy of the lower dose(s) was tested. If more than one avanafil dose was significantly better than 
placebo, then those avanafil doses were compared. 
The same methodology used for the analyses of the primary efficacy variables was used for the analyses 
of  secondary  efficacy  variables  derived  from  subject  diaries  and  IIEF  responses.  The  number  and 
percentage of subjects in each treatment group with an improvement in IIEF erectile function domain 
score were summarized. 
Regarding  the  handling  of  dropouts  or  missing  data,  in  the  analysis  of  primary  endpoints  the  last 
observation  carried  forward  convention  was  used.  No  adjustments  were  made  for  missing  data  in 
secondary efficacy analyses or safety analyses.

A total of 1509 subjects were enrolled in the study and 646 of them were randomized to treatment (162 
to  placebo,  161  to  avanafil  50mg,  161  to  avanafil  100mg,  and  162  to  avanafil  200mg).  Of  the  646 
randomized subjects, 550 (85.1%) completed the study and 96 (14.9%) subjects discontinued from the 
study.  The  percentage  of  subjects  who  discontinued  from  the  study  was  similar  across  the  treatment 
groups (25 [15.4%] in the placebo group, 30 [18.6%] in the 50 mg avanafil, 20 [12.4%] in the avanafil 
100mg, and 21 [13.0%] in the avanafil 200mg). The most common reasons for discontinuation from the 
study were protocol non-compliance (which also includes subjects who withdrew consent) (n=53, 8.2%), 
loss to follow-up (n= 22,  3.4%), and adverse event (n= 17, 2.6%). The  ITT  population included 622 
subjects, 155 in the placebo group, 154 in the 50mg avanafil, 157 in the 100mg avanafil, and 156 in the 
200mg avanafil groups.  No information on previous PD5E inhibitors usage has been provided. 
Baseline data 
With regards to demographic and baseline characteristics, the majority of subjects were white (85.6%), 
with a mean age of 55.7 years. Similar proportions of subjects with mild, moderate, and severe ED were 
randomized to treatment. At baseline, mean duration of ED was 77.4 months and the majority of subjects 
had a duration of ED ≥24 months. With the exception of race, the treatment groups were comparable with 
respect to demographic and baseline characteristics. 
Overall, 233 (36.2%) subjects reported a history of hypertension, 73 (11.3%) subjects reported a history 
of depression, and 61 (9.5%) subjects reported a history of coronary artery disease. With the exception 
of depression (reported in a lower proportion of subjects in the avanafil 100mg group), the treatment 
groups were comparable with respect to medical history of special interest.  
In  total,  187  (29.0%)  subjects  took  antihypertensive  medications,  49  (7.6%)  subjects  took 
antidepressants,  and  38  (5.9%)  subjects  took  alpha  blockers.  A  lower  proportion  of  subjects  in  the 
avanafil 50 mg group took antihypertensive medications than in the other treatment groups. A higher

proportion  of  subjects  in  the  avanafil  50  mg  group  took  antidepressants  than  in  the  other  treatment 
groups. The proportion of subjects who took alpha blockers was similar in each treatment group. 
Mean treatment duration in placebo group was 10.41 weeks versus 10.20 to 10.93 weeks in the avanafil 
groups. The mean number of total doses taken in the placebo group was 16.84 vs. 18.52-19.96 in the 
avanafil groups.  
Based on the patient’s diary responses, mean time from drug intake until the start of sexual activity was 
53.38 min for the placebo group, and 63.05 min, 56.89 min and 58.62 min in the avanafil 50mg, 100mg 
and 200 mg groups, respectively. Mean time from drug intake to the start of sexual activity was 59.50 min 
for all avanafil groups and 57.97 min for all treatment groups. 
From across various time periods after taking the study drug, all avanafil doses had higher success rates 
than the placebo group. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The  result  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoints  (changes  from  baseline  to  the  end  of  treatment  in  the 
percentage of sexual attempts in which the subject was able to maintain an erection, in the percentage of 
sexual attempts in which the subject  was able to achieve  successfully penetration and in the IIEF erectile 
function domain) are presented in tables 9-11 below:

Differences between avanafil groups and placebo increased with dose, especially for changes in SEP3 and 
SEP2.  At  end  of  treatment,  for  each  of  the  primary  endpoints,  there  was  a  statistically  significant 
difference over placebo for all three avanafil dosing groups. In addition, the treatment comparisons of 
avanafil 200 mg and avanafil 100 mg with avanafil 50 mg were statistically significant for all primary 
endpoints. However, there was no statistically significant difference between avanafil 200 and 100 mg.  
Results  of  the  per-protocol  analyses  (not  shown  in  this  AR)  for  all  3  primary  efficacy  endpoints  were 
similar to those for the ITT population.  
Analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints in the ITT population were statistically significant for the 
Change in IIEF Questionnaire Scores and Change in Secondary Subject Diary Responses for all avanafil 
doses. The treatment comparisons of each avanafil dose with placebo were statistically significant as well. 
No  the  treatment  comparisons  between  avanafil  doses  for  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  has  been 
provided.

The responses to the Global Assessment (subjects that answer that the study treatment improved their 
erections) for the ITT population at the end of treatment were affirmative in 26.6% of subjects in the 
placebo group, in 52.1% of subjects in the avanafil 50 mg group, 61.2% of subjects in the avanafil 100 
mg group, and in 72.5% of subjects in the avanafil 200 mg group. The treatment comparisons of each 
avanafil dose with placebo were statistically significant.  
The responses to the Future Use Questions (they would buy the study treatment if it were available today) 
for the ITT population at the end of treatment were affirmative in 26.6% of subjects in the placebo group, 
in 45.1% of subjects in the avanafil 50 mg group, 58.5% of subjects in the avanafil 100 mg group, and 
67.1% of subjects in the avanafil 200 mg group. The treatment comparisons of each avanafil dose with 
placebo were statistically significant.  
Other Efficacy Analyses 
Regarding successful or satisfied subject diary responses (question SEP 3 and SEP 2) by time interval, the 
proportion of attempts resulting in successful intercourse was higher  for all three avanafil doses than 
placebo at any time of assessment (Tables 20 and 21), with very similar percentage of success across all 
time intervals. After 4 hours, the number of attempts reported was too low to reach any conclusion.  
Overall,  all  avanafil  doses  were  better  than  placebo  for  the  rest  of  efficacy  analyses,  including: 
Improvement in IIEF Erectile Function Domain Score, Normalized IIEF Erectile Function Domain Score at 
End of Treatment, Number of Successful Sexual Attempts, and Mean  Number of Sexual Attempts Per

 
Study TA-302 
Participant flow 
A total of 1378 subjects were enrolled in the study and 390 of them were randomized to treatment (130 
to  placebo,  129  to  avanafil  100mg,  and  131  to  avanafil  200mg).  Of  the  randomized  subjects,  330 
(85.4%) completed the study and 57 (14.6%) subjects discontinued from the study. The percentage of 
subjects who discontinued from the study was similar across the treatment groups (15.4% in the placebo 
group, 15.5% in the avanafil 100mg, and 13% in the avanafil 200mg). The most common reasons for 
discontinuation from the study were protocol non-compliance (which also includes subjects who withdrew 
consent) (n=36, 9.2%), loss to follow-up (n= 15, 3.8%), and adverse event (n= 4, 1.0%).   
Baseline data 
The majority of subjects were white (80.5%) with a mean age of 58.0 years. Overall, the ED severity was 
mild  for  21.8%  of  subjects,  moderate  for  31.3%  of  subjects,  and  severe  for  46.9%  of  subjects.  At 
baseline,  the  mean  duration  of  ED  was  72.3  months,  with  a  longer  mean  duration  of  ED  was  for  the 
placebo and avanafil 100 mg groups than for the avanafil 200 mg group. Overall, 89.5% of subjects had 
type II diabetes and 10.5% of subjects had type I diabetes and the mean duration of diabetes was 11.3 
years.

Overall, 260 (67.0%) subjects reported a history of hypertension, 54 (13.9%) subjects reported a history 
of coronary artery disease, and 34 (8.8%) subjects reported a history of depression (a  higher proportion 
of them in the avanafil 100 mg group). 
In  total,  239  (61.6%)  subjects  took  antihypertensive  medications,  24  (6.2%)  subjects  took  alpha 
blockers, and 23 (5.9%) subjects took antidepressants. A higher proportion of subjects in the avanafil 
100 mg group took antihypertensive medications and alpha blockers than in the other treatment groups.  
Approximately 40% of the patients (n=154) reported treatment with insulin analogs.  
Mean treatment duration in placebo group was 10.64 weeks versus 10.33 to 10.91 weeks in the avanafil 
groups. The mean number of total doses taken in the placebo group was 17.29 vs. 18.12-19.06 in the 
avanafil groups.  
Based on the patient’s diary responses, mean time from drug intake until the start of sexual activity for 
successful attempts was 49.89 min for the placebo group, and 54.57 min and 68.96 min in the avanafil 
100mg and 200 mg groups, respectively. Mean time from drug intake to the start of sexual activity for 
unsuccessful attempts was 60.74 min for the placebo group and 54.19 min and 58.83 min. for the 100mg 
and 200mg avanafil groups respectively.   
Numbers analysed 
The ITT population included 379 subjects, 127 in the placebo group, 126 in the 100mg avanafil, and 126 
in the 200mg avanafil groups.   
Outcomes and estimation 
The  result  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoints  (changes  from  baseline  to  the  end  of  treatment  in  the 
percentage of sexual attempts in which the subject was able to maintain an erection, in the percentage of 
sexual attempts in which the subject  was able to achieve  penetration successfully and in the IIEF erectile

Differences between avanafil groups and placebo increased with dose, especially for changes in SEP3 and 
SEP2. At end of treatment, for each of the primary endpoints, there was a statistically significant 
difference over placebo for all the avanafil dosing groups. However, there was no statistically significant 
difference between avanafil 200 and 100 mg.  
Results of the per-protocol analyses (not shown in this AR) for all 3 primary efficacy endpoints were 
similar to those for the ITT population.  
Analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints in the ITT population were statistically significant for the 
Change in IIEF Questionnaire Scores and Change in Secondary Subject Diary Responses for all avanafil 
doses. The treatment comparisons of each avanafil dose with placebo were statistically significant as well. 
No the treatment comparisons between avanafil doses for secondary efficacy endpoints has been 
provided. 
The responses to the Global Assessment (subjects that answer that the study treatment improved their 
erections) for the ITT population at the end of treatment were affirmative in 20.8% of subjects in the 
placebo group, 45.7% of subjects in the avanafil 100 mg group, and in 55% of subjects in the avanafil 200 
mg group. The treatment comparisons of each avanafil dose with placebo were statistically significant.  
The responses to the Future Use Questions (they would buy the study treatment if it were available today) 
for the ITT population at the end of treatment were affirmative in 22.5% of subjects in the placebo group,

Other Efficacy Analyses 
Regarding successful or satisfied subject diary responses (question SEP 3 and SEP 2) by time interval, the 
proportion of attempts resulting in successful intercourse was higher for all three avanafil doses than 
placebo across all time intervals. The percentage of success was very similar across different time periods 
of taking avanafil as shown in the tables below (Tables 20 and 21). This puts into question the sensibility 
of the tool to identify an optimum window for successful attempts. After 3 hours, the number of attempts 
reported was too low to reach any conclusion. Overall, all avanafil doses were better than placebo for the 
rest of efficacy analyses, including: Improvement in IIEF Erectile Function Domain Score, Normalized IIEF 
Erectile Function Domain Score at End of Treatment, Number of Successful Sexual Attempts, and Mean 
Number of Sexual Attempts Per Week.

Participant flow 
A total of 528 subjects were enrolled in the study and 298 of them were randomized to treatment (100 to 
placebo, 99 to avanafil 100mg, and 99 to avanafil 200mg). Of the randomized subjects, 252 (7684.6%) 
completed the study and 46(15.4%) subjects discontinued from the study. The percentage of subjects 
who discontinued from the study was higher in the placebo group (24 subjects, 24%) than the avanafil 
groups (14 subjects [14.1%] in the avanafil 100mg, and 8 subjects [8.1%] in the avanafil 200mg). The 
most common reasons for discontinuation from the study were withdrawal of consent (n=23, 7.7%), loss 
to follow-up (n= 10, 3.4%), protocol non-compliance (n=7, 2.3%), and adverse event (n= 5, 1.7%). The 
ITT population included 286 subjects, 196 in the placebo group, 194 in the 100mg avanafil, and 96 in the 
200mg avanafil groups.   
Baseline data 
The majority of subjects were White (81.5%) with a mean age of 58.4 years. Across all treatment groups, 
the ED severity at baseline was mild for 9.1% of subjects, moderate for 19.5% of subjects, and severe for 
71.5% of subjects. At baseline, the mean duration of post-surgery ED for all subjects was 18.7 months, 
with a mean duration of ED similar between the treatment groups. The majority of subjects had robotic

penile rehabilitation treatment within 3 months of their prostatectomy (78.2%).  
In total, 125 (41.9%) subjects reported a history of hypertension, 38 (12.8%) subjects reported a history 
of  other  cardiovascular  disease,  and  35  (11.7%)  subjects  reported  a  history  of  depression.  With  the 
exception of hypertension (lower proportion of subjects in the avanafil 100mg group reported a history of 
it), the treatment groups were comparable with respect to medical history category. 
In  total,  118  (39.6%)  subjects  took  antihypertensive  medications,  28  (9.4%)  subjects  took 
antidepressants,  and  4  (1.3%)  subjects  took  alpha  blockers.  Overall,  the  usage  of  concomitant 
medications was similar between the treatment groups. No information on previous PD5E inhibitors usage 
has been provided. 
All subjects included in this study had undergone bilateral nerve sparing; no subjects with unilateral nerve 
sparing were included in the study. Mean treatment duration in placebo group was 10.24 weeks versus 
10.72 to 11.35 weeks in the avanafil groups. The mean number of total doses taken in the placebo group 
was 15.35 vs. 15.54 -17.58 in the avanafil groups.

Regarding successful or satisfied subject diary responses (question SEP 3 and SEP 2) by time interval, the

Summary of main studies 
The  following  tables  summarise  the  efficacy  results  from  the  main  studies  supporting  the  present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections). 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
An integrated analysis of efficacy data from 2 of the Phase 3 pivotal studies (TA-301 and TA-302) and 
study TA-05 (phase 2 dose-finding study) has been provided. The other phase III pivotal study (TA-303) 
has not been included in the integrated analysis set and its results have been analysed separately. This 
can be acceptable, since from an efficacy point of view, the population from that study (subjects with ED 
post bilateral nerve sparing radical prostatectomy) can be considered different.  
The majority of subjects in the integrated analysis population were white (84%), 56.6 years of age on 
average and with  a mean IIEF erectile function domain score of 12.9 (moderate severity). Regarding 
weight, height and BMI, the mean measurements in the integrated population were 94.3 Kg, 178.1 cms 
and 29.7 kg/m2, respectively. Those measurements are not in line with those expected to be the average 
measurements in multiple zones of the EU. Adding the fact that all the clinical phase III trials for avanafil 
have  been  carried  out in  the  USA,  extrapolation  of  the  observed  results  to the  EU  population  needed 
further  discussion  from  the  Applicant.  Additional  data  provided  indicated  an  increase  in  exposure  (by 
means of Cmax and AUC) in subjects with lower body weight, which is in line with the increase in AEs 
frequency  observed  in  subjects  with  normal  BMI  (≥ 18.5-<25kg/m2),  when  compared  to  overweight 
and/or obese subjects.. 
Prior use of PDE5 inhibitors in the pivotal studies, ranged from 71.9% (study TA-301) to 75.3% (in the 
diabetic study, TA-302), with similar percentages across all treatment arms. This percentage is similar to 
those observed with other PDE5 inhibitors. Taking into consideration that these data were not provided 
originally  and  that  patients  with  a  prior  history  of  treatment  failure  with  other  PD5E  inhibitors  were 
excluded  from  the  pivotal trials,    it  was  questioned whether  the  population  included  was  an  enriched 
population,  favouring  the  observed  efficacy  results.  The  Applicant  argued  that  by  defining  treatment 
failure  as  “the  failure  to  respond  to  two  or  more  specific  PDE5  inhibitors,  with  each  used  on  multiple 
attempts”,  the  Applicant  tried  to  identify  subjects  unresponsive  to  PDE5  inhibitor  therapy  as  a  class, 
rather than to a single agent. It is noted that the implementation of this criterion resulted in the exclusion 
of  only  4  subjects  in  study  TA.301  (general  population  with  ED).  Therefore,  based  on  the  data  and 
arguments provided by the Applicant, the possible impact of the enrichment  of the population on the 
observed efficacy can be considered not relevant.

In  general,  results  from  the  integrated  analyses  are  in  line  with  those  observed  in  the  individual 
studies, with a slightly lower magnitude of the effect for all 3 co-primary endpoints in the integrated 
analyses.  Differences  between  avanafil  100mg  and  200mg  with  avanafil  50mg  and  placebo  were 
statistically significant, while comparison between avanafil 100mg and 200mg did not reach statistical 
significance, as previously seen in the individual studies.  
In the integrated population as well as the individual studies TA-302 and TA-303, the magnitude of 
changes for all 3 co-primary endpoints observed among prostatectomisedsubjects was similar to those 
reported  for  diabetics;  when  compared  with  those  observed  among  general  population  subjects 
(TA-301)  the  magnitude  observed  in  both  subpopulations  was  smaller  than  those  observed  in  the 
general  population  subjects.  These  findings  were  the  grounds  for  a  MO.  New  analysis  of  the  data 
confirms  these  findings.  The  applicant  stated  that  the  smaller  improvements  in  diabetics  and 
prostatectomised subjects was also observed in other marketed PDE5 inhibitors and concluded that the 
SPC should set appropriate expectations for obtaining a satisfactory response. 
Overall,  discontinuations  were  higher  in  the  avanafil  50mg  group  (31  subjects,  14.8%)  then  the 
placebo group (47 subjects, 13.9%), and the other two avanafil treatment groups (38 subjects, 11.1% 
in  the  100mg  dose  and  31  subjects,    9.2%  in  the  200mg  dose).  A  substantial  percentage  of 
discontinuations were due to "withdrawn consent/protocol non-compliance" and "lost for follow-up. 
Mean EF domain scores at baseline was in the moderate ED range (12.6-13.6) for all subjects. At the 
end of treatment, mean EF domain scores for patients in placebo group stayed in the same category 
(14.8) of ED severity, while patients in avanafil groups showed mean values of about 18.4-20.4. 
 With regards to time from dose to start of action, findings are in line with those previously mentioned 
for the individual studies, with very small differences on the percentage of success at the different time 
periods. 
With regards to time from dose to start of action, based on data collected by the subjects on their 
diaries (after the sexual encounter) in all 3 pivotal studies, all avanafil doses had higher success rates 
than the placebo group. However, the percentage of success was very similar across the different time 
periods. This finding questions the sensibility of this tool to identify an optimum window for success and 
precludes from reaching sound conclusions about the start of action.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
Diabetic subjects or subjects with ED as a result of a bilateral nerve sparing radical prostatectomy have 
been included in the clinical avanafil studies (TA-302 and TA-303, respectively).  With regards to age, 
the studies allowed inclusion of males with no upper age limit in 2 of the pivotal studies. Due to the low 
number of very elderly subjects (≥75 years old) enrolled, the efficacy and safety profiles have not been 
described in depth. Adequate post-marketing pharmacovigilance measures have been proposed to allow 
more a better characterization.  
Certain subpopulations have not been included in the avanafil clinical development program; therefore 
the efficacy of avanafil has not been demonstrated. These populations include: patients with ED due to 
spinal cord injury or other neurological disorders and subjects with severe renal or hepatic impairment. 
The lack of data in these subpopulations has been adequately reflected in the SPC.  
Data  from  subjects  with  mild-moderate  renal  impairment  included  in  the  phase  III  pivotal  studies 
showed dose-related improvements and an unexpected decrease in efficacy (in subjects with mild renal 
impairment)  when  compared  to  subjects  with  normal  function.  The  Applicant  hypothesizes  that  the 
observed differences are likely related to greater impairment of vascular or nerve function in this subset 
of  patients  compared  to  the  general  study  population,  in  a  manner  similar  to  diabetics  or

prostatectomized  subjects,  making  them  less  responsive  to  pharmacological  treatment  for  ED.  The 
observed decrease in efficacy in this population is reflected in the SPC.  
Supportive study 
•  TA-314 
In order to assess long term efficacy, the Applicant chose an open-label design study (phase III open label 
extension study TA-314) with a 52-week treatment period.  
All  eligible  subjects  were initially  assigned  to  treatment  with  avanafil 100  mg (regardless of  the  dose 
taken during the qualifying trial). Subjects who has tolerance issues with avanafil 100 mg could request 
a dose reduction to 50 mg. Subjects who tolerated treatment with avanafil 100 mg could request a dose 
increase to 200 mg, based on self-determined need. Like in the pivotal studies, subjects were instructed 
to  take  1  dose  of  study  drug  approximately  30  minutes  prior  to  initiation  of  sexual  activity,  without 
restrictions on the timing consumption of food or alcohol. Subjects were requested to make at least 4 
attempts  per  month  at  sexual  intercourse  and  for  each  attempt,  they  were  instructed  to  record 
information regarding the administration of study drug and sexual experience in a subject diary. 
Allowed and prohibited medications were similar to those in the phase III pivotal studies. 
Methods 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of avanafil in 
men with mild to severe ED. 
The  3  co-primary  efficacy  endpoints  were  the  following:  percentage  of  sexual  attempts  during  the 
52-week treatment period in which subjects were able to maintain an erection of sufficient duration to 
have successful intercourse (SEP3); percentage of sexual attempts during the 52-week treatment period 
in which subjects were able to insert the penis into their partner’s vagina (SEP2); and mean IIEF erectile 
function domain score at the end of the 52-week treatment period. 
Other efficacy endpoints included: changes in the three co-primary efficacy variables from the end of the 
qualifying study (TA-301 or TA-302) to the end of the extension study; percentages of sexual attempts 
resulting in successful intercourse (SEP3) and successful vaginal penetration (SEP2) by dose for subjects 
who  took  at  least  4  doses  of  avanafil  100  mg  consecutively  and  at  least  4  doses  of  avanafil  200  mg 
consecutively in study TA-301, TA-302, and/or TA-314; mean IIEF domain scores at the end of treatment 
and  changes  from  baseline  to  end  of  treatment;  percentage  of  subjects  with  an  improvement  in  IIEF 
erectile function domain score from baseline to end of treatment; percentage of subjects with an IIEF 
erectile function domain score in the normal range at the end of treatment; and counts and percentages 
of positive responses to diary questions by time interval between dose administration and attempt.  
The primary population for efficacy analyses was the ITT Population (subjects who took at least 1 dose of 
study drug and had at least one post-dose efficacy assessment). The last observation carried forward 
convention was used to adjust for missing data.  
An “a priori” definition of success was established study 314 as a positive change from baseline for diary 
question  5  (SEP3)  between  the  run-in  period  and  the  first  30  days  of  the  TA-314  treatment  period. 
Additionally, “responders” were defined as subjects who were on active treatment and were successful in 
the  qualifying  study  or  subjects  who  were  successful  during  the  first  month  of  TA-314.  However,  the 
applied  definition  had  limitations,  since  the  magnitude  of  that  “positive”  change  considered  clinically 
relevant was not defined.

Results 
Overall,  536  (75.3%)  subjects  voluntarily  increased  their  dose  from  100  mg  to  200  mg  during  study 
TA-314; 171 (24.0%) subjects remained at 100 mg; 3 (0.4%) subjects voluntarily decreased their dose 
from 100 mg to 50 mg; 1 (0.1%) subject was dispensed all three doses of avanafil; and 1 (0.1%) subject 
was not dispensed study drug during this study.  
The majority of subjects were white (85.7%) with an average age of 56.4 years. Overall, the ED severity 
was mild for 29.1% of subjects, moderate for 33.4% of subjects, and severe for 37.5% of subjects. The 
mean baseline IIEF erectile function domain score was 12.2 and at baseline of the qualifying study, the 
mean duration of ED was 75.9 months. Subjects who received avanafil 100 mg and 200 mg had lower 
mean IIEF erectile function domain scores at baseline, indicating a greater degree of ED, and a longer 
mean duration of erectile dysfunction than subjects who received avanafil 100 mg only. 
Of  the  712  enrolled  subjects,  492  (69.1%)  subjects  completed  the  study  and  220  (30.9%)  subjects 
discontinued from the study. After achievement of planed enrolment numbers that ensured retention of at 
least 300 subjects through 6 months and 100 subjects through 12 months, the Sponsor decided to close 
enrolment. The primary reasons for discontinuation from the study were subject withdrawal of consent 
(13.8%), lost to follow-up (9.4%), protocol non-compliance (4.2%), and adverse event (2.8%). For the 
overall discontinuations and discontinuations due to AEs, the percentages of discontinuations were lower 
in the avanafil 100 mg-200 mg group (25.9% and 1.5%, respectively) than the avanafil 100 mg only 
group (46.2% and 6.4%, respectively). 
Overall, the mean percentage of sexual attempts resulting in successful intercourse (SEP3) was 66.6% 
during the 52-week treatment period and the mean change from baseline was 54.8%. For subjects who 
received  avanafil  100  mg  only,  the  mean  percentage  of  sexual  attempts  resulting  in  successful 
intercourse was 67.7% during the 52-week treatment period and the mean change from baseline was 
54.4%. For subjects who received avanafil 100 mg and 200 mg, the mean percentage of sexual attempts 
resulting in successful intercourse was 66.3% during the 52-week treatment period and the mean change 
from baseline was 54.9%. 
Overall, the mean percentage of sexual attempts resulting in successful vaginal penetration (SEP2) was 
80.2% during the 52-week treatment period and the mean change from baseline 36.9%. For subjects 
who  received  avanafil  100  mg  only,  the  mean  percentage  of  sexual  attempts  resulting  in  successful 
vaginal penetration was 83.3% during the 52-week treatment period and the mean change from baseline 
was  39.2%.  For  subjects who  received  avanafil  100  mg  and  200  mg,  the  mean  percentage  of  sexual 
attempts resulting in successful vaginal penetration was 79.4% during the 52-week treatment period and 
the mean change from baseline was 36.4%. 
Overall,  the  mean  IIEF  erectile  function  domain  score  was  12.3  at  baseline  and  22.6  at  the  end  of 
treatment; the mean change in IIEF erectile function domain score from baseline to end of treatment was 
10.3. For subjects who received avanafil 100 mg only, the mean IIEF erectile function domain score was 
22.2 at the end of treatment and the mean change in IIEF erectile function domain score from baseline 
was 8.7. For subjects who received avanafil 100 mg and 200 mg, the mean IIEF erectile function domain 
score was 22.7 at the end of treatment and the mean change in IIEF erectile function domain score from 
baseline 10.8. 
Dose-response relationship 
Across all pivotal studies, there was a superiority trend of avanafil 100mg and 200mg over avanafil 50mg, 
with statistically significant differences of all 3 avanafil doses over placebo. However, differences between 
100mg  and  200mg  were  minimal,  not  reaching  statistical  significance  or  clinical  relevance  in  the 
double-blind controlled studies. The Applicant supports the superiority of the avanafil 200mg mostly in 
the open label extension study and the benefits observed in patients who voluntarily elected to increase 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/321885/2013 
Page 87/112 
 
 
  
their avanafil dose from 100mg to 200mg. Due to the nature of its design, its results are methodologically 
more difficult to interpret, especially taking into account that the decision to increase the dose was made 
(subjectively) by the own subjects. Additionally, the Applicant states that it could be reasonable to allow 
patients with an unsatisfactory response to the 100 mg dose to try the 200 mg dose and that certain 
subpopulations  of  patients  could  benefit  from  the  higher  avanafil  dose.  However,  the  population 
subgroup(s) candidate for the avanafil 200mg still remain to be clearly identified and safety data should 
also  have  to  be  taken  into  consideration.  Of  note,  the  comparison  of  avanfil  200mg  and  100mg  in 
diabetics  and  prostatectomized  subjects,  subpopulations  with  possible  poor  response,  was  not 
statistically significant or clinically relevant. The avanafil 200mg dose has not shown statistical or clinical 
superiority over the 100mg and it has not been study enough in certain subpopulations, such as very 
elderly patients (≥75 years old), or patients with low BMI.  
Responder Analysis 
A responder analysis (based on the definition provided by the Applicant) was performed for subjects in 
study TA-314. The mean age of responders was 55.5 years and the mean age of non-responders was 61.0 
years. The responder group had a lower proportion of subjects with diabetes than the non-responder 
group (26.7% vs. 56.3%). Responders had a shorter mean duration of ED than non-responders (73.6 
months  vs.  88.9  months)  and  a  lower  proportion  of  subjects  with  severe  ED  at  baseline  than  the 
non-responder group (32.3% vs. 63.0%). Of the subjects who were non-responders to 100 mg (n=172), 
112 (65.1%) subjects were responders to 200 mg.  
Maintenance of the effect 
Mean percentage of sexual attempts resulting in successful intercourse was 42.1% during the final month 
of  the  qualifying  study  and  66.6%  during  the  52-week  treatment  period;  the  mean  change  in  the 
percentage of attempts resulting in successful intercourse was 24.5%. For subjects who received avanafil 
100  mg  only  during  study  TA-314,  the  mean  percentage  of  sexual  attempts  resulting  in  successful 
intercourse was 54.5% during the final month of the qualifying study and 67.7% during the 52-week 
treatment period; the mean change in the percentage of attempts resulting in successful intercourse was 
13.2%.  For  subjects  who  received  avanafil  100  mg  and  200  mg  during  study  TA-314,  the  mean 
percentage of sexual attempts resulting in successful intercourse was 38.7% during the final month of the 
qualifying study and 66.3% during the 52-week treatment period; the mean change in the percentage of 
attempts resulting in successful intercourse was 27.6%. 
Overall, the mean percentage of sexual attempts resulting in successful vaginal penetration was 63.5% 
during the final month of the qualifying study and 80.2% during the 52-week treatment period; the mean 
change in the percentage of attempts resulting in successful vaginal penetration was 16.7%. 
For subjects who received avanafil 100 mg only during study TA-314, the mean percentage of sexual 
attempts resulting in successful vaginal penetration was 74.5% during the final month of the qualifying 
study and 83.3% during the 52-week treatment period; the mean change in the percentage of attempts 
resulting in successful vaginal penetration was 8.8%. For subjects who received avanafil 100 mg and 200 
mg  during  study  TA-314,  the  mean  percentage  of  sexual  attempts  resulting  in  successful  vaginal 
penetration was 60.5% during the final month of the qualifying period and 79.4% during the 52-week 
treatment  period;  the  mean  change  in  the  percentage  of  attempts  resulting  in  successful  vaginal 
penetration was 18.9%. 
Mean IIEF erectile function domain score was 18.2 at endpoint of the qualifying study and 22.6 at the end 
of  treatment  of  the  open-label  study;  the  mean  change  in  IIEF  erectile  function  domain  score  from 
endpoint of the qualifying study was 4.3. For subjects who received avanafil 100 mg only during study 
TA-314, the mean IIEF erectile function domain score was 20.9 at endpoint of the qualifying study and 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/321885/2013 
Page 88/112 
 
 
  
 
22.2 at the end of treatment of the open-label study; the mean change in IIEF erectile function domain 
score from endpoint of the qualifying study was 1.4. For subjects who received avanafil 100 mg and 200 
mg  during  study  TA-314,  the  mean  IIEF  erectile  function  domain  score  was  17.5  at  endpoint  of  the 
qualifying  study  and  22.7  at  the  end  of  treatment  of  the  open-label  study;  the  mean  change  in  IIEF 
erectile function domain score from endpoint of the qualifying study was 5.2. 
Overall, efficacy was maintained during the 52-week observation period, with increasing efficacy results 
as time passed, which is expected.   
•  TA-03 
Study TA-03 was a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, crossover study in 51 adult male subjects who 
were  in  a  monogamous,  heterosexual  relationship  for  at  least  3  months  and  who  had  a  subjective 
complaint of erectile dysfunction and had been experiencing unsatisfactory sexual intercourse during 
the past 3 months. Subjects were treated with avanafil 200mg or sildenafil 100mg in random order 
during various treatment periods and were instructed to initiate sexual activity at defined intervals after 
dosing. Each treatment period was 3 to 4 weeks in duration. Subjects were to maintain a diary of all 
treatments  and  to  record  the  time  between  treatment  and  initiation  of  sexual  activity  and  the 
effectiveness of treatment in a diary. Subjects completed the IIEF questionnaire and global evaluation 
questions at the end of each treatment period. Avanafil 200 mg treatment improved primary endpoints 
of erectile function and was similar to sildenafil 100 mg treatment for SEP2 and time from dosing to 
achieve  an  erection  sufficient  for  intercourse.  The  mean  percentages of  sexual  attempts  resulting  in 
successful  intercourse  for  avanafil  5-  to  10-minute,  sildenafil  5-  to  10-minute,  and  avanafil  2-hour 
treatment were 56%, 69%, and 75%, respectively. The mean percentages of sexual attempts resulting 
in successful vaginal penetration for avanafil 5- to 10-minute, sildenafil 5- to 10-minute, and avanafil 
2-hour treatment were 79%, 85%, and 88%, respectively.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical development program to assess the efficacy and safety of avanafil in men with ED included 
18  Phase  1  studies,  3  Phase  2  studies,  and  4  Phase  3  studies.  These  studies  evaluated  the 
pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of avanafil at doses ranging from 12.5 mg to 800 mg. The doses 
for which the applicant is seeking approval are 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg. All of the studies of the 
clinical development program were conducted in various centres in the United States, with exception of 
one phase 1 PK study (HP-01), which included  65 young (ages 18-35 years) healthy volunteers and it 
was conducted in France. 
A total of 460 subjects were screened for study TA-05, and 295 of them were randomized. A total of 
284 (96.3%) subjects attempted and reported at least one sexual encounter with study medication and 
were  included  in  the  ITT  population.  Of  the  295  subjects  randomized,  249  (84.4%)  completed  the 
treatment  protocol.  The  reasons  for  discontinuation  included  withdrawal  by  subject  (26,  8.8% 
subjects), AE (5, 1.7% subjects), protocol violation (1, <1% of subjects), non-compliance (2, 0.7% 
subjects), lost to follow-up (10, 3.4% subjects), and lack of efficacy (2, 0.7% subjects).  
At  the  end  of  the  treatment  period  (12  weeks),  for  each  of  the  co-primary  endpoints,  there  was  a 
statistically significant difference from placebo for all avanafil dose groups. In the study, the superiority 
of avanafil 200mg over 100mg did not reach statistical significant or clinical relevance. This finding is 
in line with the results observed across the pivotal studies.  
Based on results from study TA-05, the Applicant chose avanafil 50mg, 100mg and 200mg to be used 
in the phase III pivotal studies. There were minimal differences in efficacy between avanafil 200mg and 
300mg with a less favourable safety profile for the higher avanafil dose; the Applicant concluded that 
no additional benefit was obtained from the avanafil 300mg and did not include the higher dose in the 
phase III clinical program .   
The Phase 3 clinical studies included one study in the general population with ED (TA-301), one study 
in  diabetic  men  with  ED  (TA-302),  one  study  in  males  with  ED  following  nerve-sparing  radical 
prostatectomy  (TA-303)  and  one  open  label  extension  study  to  assess  the  long-term  safety  and 
tolerability of avanafil (TA-314). Collectively, these studies randomized a total of 1334 subjects. 
Prior to the start of the phase III clinical program, the selection of doses to be used in the clinical trials 
was  defined  in  a  dose-finding  phase  II  study.  Based  on  its  results,  the  avanafil  50mg,  100mg  and 
200mg doses were chosen.  
The overall design of the phase III pivotal studies (parallel, double blind placebo controlled studies, 
with  measurement  of  efficacy  at  12  weeks  and  the  chosen  efficacy  parameters)  is  considered 
appropriate. In fact, the clinical development performed for avanafil is similar to those performed with 
previous  PDE5  inhibitors  already  authorized  for  ED.  The  CHMP  noted  that  no  active  comparison  of 
avanafil  with  other  PDE5  inhibitors  has  been  done,  which  would  have  allowed  contextualizing  the 
efficacy  results  in  the  current  clinical  setting  of  ED  treatment.  However,  although  this  information 
would have been useful, the study design of the pivotal trials is considered acceptable to demonstrate 
the efficacy of this medicinal product.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The majority of subjects included in the pivotal studies were white (84%), an average age around 56 
years and a mean IIEF erectile function domain score in the moderate severity range.  
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/321885/2013 
Page 90/112 
 
 
  
 
Prior use of PDE5 inhibitors in the pivotal studies, ranged from 71.9% (study TA-301) to 75.3% (in the 
diabetic study, TA-302), with similar percentages across all treatment arms. This percentage is similar 
to  those  observed  with  other  PDE5  inhibitors.  Based  on  the  data  and  arguments  provided  by  the 
Applicant, the possible impact of the enrichment of the population on the observed efficacy can be 
considered not relevant. 
With regards to weight, height and BMI, it was noted that the mean measurements in the integrated 
population  (94.3  Kg,  178.1  cms  and  29.7  kg/m2,  respectively)  are  not  the  expected  average 
measurements in multiple zones of the EU.  A subgroup analysis based on the subjects´ BMI was not 
originally performed. The Applicant was requested to further discuss the extrapolation of the observed 
results to the EU population. With regards to weight, additional data provided indicated an increase in 
exposure (by means of Cmax and AUC) in subjects with lower body weight, which is in line with the 
increase in AEs frequency observed in subjects with normal BMI (≥18.5-<25kg/m2), when compared 
to overweight and/or obese subjects.  
In  the  pivotal  studies,  for  each  of  the  co-primary  endpoints  at  the  end  of  treatment,  there  was  a 
statistically significant difference from placebo for all three avanafil doses. Additionally, comparisons of 
both avanafil 100 mg and 200 mg with avanafil 50mg (TA-301) were statistically significant for all 3 
co-primary endpoints. However, when a comparison was done between avanafil 100 mg and 200mg 
doses, there was no statistically significant difference. The Applicant argued that this finding could be 
due to several factors, such as an insufficient sample size or inter-subject variability. While this can be 
agreed on, the superiority of the avanafil 200mg over 100mg rests on an open label extension study 
(TA-314) in which the decision to increase the dose was made by the own subjects and not based on 
a more objective basis. However, it can be argued that both doses (100mg and 200mg) have proven 
superiority over placebo and it can be left open for the healthy young subject and their doctor to decide 
on the need to increase the dose.  
Results in special populations such as diabetics and subjects with nerve sparing prostatectomy were 
smaller than those in the general population study and further justification about the clinical relevance 
of  the  observed  effects  was  requested.    The  applicant  stated  that  the  smaller  improvements  in 
diabetics and prostatectomised subjects were also observed in other marketed PDE5 inhibitors. This 
information is reflected in the SPC.   
The lack of a pre-planned definition of “responders” and “clinically significant” change from baseline for 
the 3 co-primary endpoints was raised by the Committee during the assessment. In response to this, 
the  Applicant  provided  a  post-hoc  analysis  defining  the  minimum  threshold  for  a  clinically  relevant 
change  from  baseline  for  SEP  3,  SEP2  and  IIEF  as  an  improvement  of    23%,  21%  and  >4  points, 
respectively. These values were adopted from data recently published in scientific literature (Rosen et 
al). Responder data from this post-filing analysis showed that all doses of avanafil were statistically 
superior  to  placebo  for  all  three  co-primary  endpoints  (p≤0.0343)  and  across  all  three  individual 
pivotal  studies.  Clinically  relevant  improvements,  as  defined  above,  were  observed  for  the  general 
population  as  well  as  the  diabetic  and  post-prostatectomy  populations.  Findings  also  confirmed  a 
smaller effect in diabetics and prostatectomized patients, as previously observed. These data has been 
reflected in the relevant section of the SmPC in order to give to the prescriber a correct appraisal of the 
drug effectiveness in populations with these co-morbidities. 
To assess the maintenance of the effect beyond 12 weeks, the Applicant has chosen an open-label 
design study (phase III open label extension study TA-314) with a 52-week treatment period. Although 
the chosen design is not the most robust to demonstrate long term efficacy, the uncontrolled open 
extension with active treatment suggests the maintenance of the effect.  
Overall, the mean percentage of sexual attempts resulting in successful intercourse was 42.1% during 
the final month of the qualifying study and 66.6% during the 52-week treatment period; the mean 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/321885/2013 
Page 91/112 
 
 
  
change in the percentage of attempts resulting in successful intercourse was 24.5%.  
There were little differences of results for the avanafil 100mg only group and 100-200mg group. These 
data seems to suggest that subjects who respond successfully with avanafil treatment are likely to 
continue responding over time. 
Across all pivotal studies, there was a superiority trend of avanafil 100mg and 200mg over avanafil 
50mg,  with  statistically  significant  differences  of  all  3  avanafil  doses  over  placebo.  However, 
differences between 100mg and 200mg were minimal, not reaching statistical significance or clinical 
relevance in the double-blind controlled studies. In  addition, the avanafil 50mg dose showed small 
improvement for all 3 co-primary endpoints.  
The time from drug intake to the start of the sexual activity  was not well defined during the clinical 
trials. Based on the patient’s diary responses, the percentage of success at different time periods are 
very similar (from earliest times up to 4-6 hours post-dose), which questions the sensibility of this tool 
to identify an optimum window for success and precludes from reaching sound conclusions about the 
start of action.  
Overall, the change from  baseline for all 3 co-primary endpoints seemed larger in the subgroup of 
younger subjects (<50 years), for all avanafil doses. In older patients, due to the low number of them 
enrolled in the pivotal studies and the lack of robust PK data, the efficacy (and safety) profile (s) have 
not  been  described  in  depth,  especially  for  the  elderly  subjects  ( ≥ 70  years  old).  Adequate 
post-marketing pharmacovigilance measures have been proposed to allow a better characterization. 
In diabetic subjects, the magnitude of changes observed for all 3 co-primary endpoints was smaller in 
all treatment groups, when compared with those observed among general population subjects. The 
same  trend  is  observed  in  the  subjects  with  a  radical  prostatectomy,  which  showed  even  smaller 
improvements.  No  comparison  between  both  avanafil  doses  has  been  performed  for  these  2 
populations. 
Based  on  ED  severity  and  duration  at  baseline,  the  end-of-treatment  measurements  generally 
decreased as severity of ED increased. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Clinical efficacy of avanafil in males with ED is supported by three phase III pivotal studies and an 
open-label  extension  study.  All  avanafil  doses  showed  superiority  over  placebo  with  statistical 
significance and clinically relevant improvements from baseline.  
As insufficient data was available to support a maximum daily administration frequency of twice a day, 
the maximum daily administration frequency was restricted to once daily, which has been reflected in 
section the SmPC. 
The number and percentage of subjects ≥ 70 years of age across the clinical studies is rather small. 
Ideally,  a  larger  dataset  in  patients  ≥  70  years  old  would  have  been  preferred  in  order  to  better 
characterize  the  clinical  profile  of  avanafil  in  this  population.  The  SmPC  reflects  the  limited  data 
available in elderly patients.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Two analysis cohorts were defined for the safety analyses: the Double-Blind Cohort (the primary safety 
population  for  analysis),  which  included  subjects  from  the  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  studies

(TA-05, TA-301 and TA-302) who received avanafil 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, or placebo; and the phase 
3  Double-Blind  Cohort,  which  consists  of  all  subjects  from  two  of  the  phase  III,  double-blind, 
placebo-controlled studies (TA-301 and TA-302). Safety data from the other phase III study TA-303 are 
presented separately.   
The long-term safety analysis set is based on the safety data from the 52 week open-label extension 
study TA-314.  
Patient exposure 
Overall, 2144 subjects were exposed to avanafil: 644 subjects in Phase 1 studies, 360 subjects in Phase 
2 studies and 1140 subjects in Phase 3 studies. The number of subjects exposed to a dose of ≤50 mg, 
100 mg, and 200 mg, was 326, 547, and 1010, respectively. A total of 137 subjects were exposed to 
higher doses than those proposed for marketing (300-800 mg). 
In the phase 1 studies, 644 subjects were exposed to avanafil: 83 subjects received a dose of avanafil 
≤50 mg, 73 subjects received avanafil 100 mg, 485 subjects received avanafil 200 mg and 80 subjects 
received a dose of avanafil >200 mg. 
In the Double-Blind Cohort, the mean duration of exposure was 12.1 weeks with an overall mean time 
on treatment of 10.6 weeks and an overall median time on treatment of 11.3 weeks. The mean total 
number of doses taken was 17.8 (16.7 doses for the placebo group, 17.5 doses for the avanafil 50 mg 
group, 18.5 doses for the avanafil 100 mg group and 18.4 doses for the avanafil 200 mg group). In this 
cohort, 629 of the 1267 subjects (49.6%) took two doses of study drug within 24 hours (171 of the 349 
[49.0%] subjects in the placebo group, 113 of the 217 [52.1%] subjects in the avanafil 50 mg group, 
179 of the 349 [51.3%] subjects in the avanafil 100 mg group and 166 of the 352 [47.2%] subjects in 
the avanafil 200 mg group). For subjects who took two doses of study drug within 24 hours (n=629), the 
mean number of times during the study that two doses were taken within 24 hours was 3.2.  
In the Phase III Double-Blind Cohort, the exposure to the study drug was similar to that seen for the 
Double-Blind Cohort. The  mean duration of exposure was 12.2  weeks  with an overall mean time on 
treatment  of  10.6  weeks  and  an  overall  median  time  on  treatment  of  11.3  weeks.  The  mean  total 
number of doses taken was 18.6 (17.5 doses for the placebo group, 18.6 doses for the avanafil 50 mg 
group, 19.3 doses for the avanafil 100 mg group and 19.2 doses for the avanafil 200 mg group). In this 
cohort, 549 of the 1032 (53.2%) took two doses of study drug within 24 hours (158 of the 291 [54.3%] 
subjects in the placebo group, 88 of the 160 [55.0%] subjects in the avanafil 50 mg group, 151 of the 
288 [52.4%] subjects in the avanafil 100 mg group and 152 of the 293 [51.9%] subjects in the avanafil 
200 mg group). For subjects who took two doses of study drug within 24 hours (n=549), the mean 
number of times during the study that two doses were taken within 24 hours was 3.4. 
In  the  long-term  safety  analysis  set  (TA-314),  the  mean  duration  of  exposure  to  avanafil  was  35.3 
weeks and the median duration of exposure was 38.1 weeks. Overall, 493 subjects were exposed to 
avanafil  for ≥6  months  (26  weeks)  and  153  subjects  were  exposed  to  avanafil  for  ≥12  months  (52 
weeks). Mean and median duration of exposure were longer for subjects who received avanafil 100 mg 
and 200 mg than for those who received avanafil 100 mg only. In total, 536 (75.3%) subjects were 
dispensed avanafil 100 mg and 200 mg during the study; 171 (24.0%) subjects were dispensed avanafil 
100 mg only; 3 (0.4%) subjects were dispensed avanafil 100 mg and 50 mg; 1 (0.1%) subject was 
dispensed all three doses of avanafil; and 1 (0.1%) subject was not dispensed study drug during this 
study. 
Overall, the mean total number of doses taken was 68.6: 47.5 doses for subjects who received avanafil 
100 mg only during this study; 75.4 doses for subjects who received avanafil 100 mg and 200 mg during 
this study; and 58.2 doses for subjects in the “other” doses group.

Demographic and baseline characteristics in both of the safety cohorts are comparable to those from the 
integrated  analysis  efficacy  population,  which  has  already  been  assessed  previously  in  the  efficacy 
section, along with data from individual studies TA-303 and TA-314.  
Adverse events 
The  overall  safety  profile  for  avanafil  seems  to  be  in  line  with  that  known  for  other  PDE5  inhibitors 
already authorised and no new safety signals have been observed. In the largest safety cohort provided 
by the Applicant (double-blind cohort), approximately a third (n=425 [33.5%]) of the subjects reported 
a TEAE, with a higher incidence in the avanafil treatment groups, although a clear dose-related trend 
could  not  be  identified.  With  regards  to  severity,  the  majority  of  the  events  were  mild-moderate  in 
severity, including the drug-related TEAEs.  
In the  Integrated Double-Blind Cohort (Table 18), 425 (33.5%) subjects reported at least one TEAE 
during the study. The incidence of TEAEs was higher in the avanafil groups (31.3% to 40.1%) than in the 
placebo  group  (25.5%).  Overall,  149  (11.8%)  subjects  had  a  TEAE  that  was  considered  by  the 
investigators to be related to study drug. The incidence of drug-related TEAEs was higher in the avanafil 
groups (10.6% to 17.3%) than in the placebo group (4.3%). Most of the TEAEs were mild or moderate 
in severity. The distribution of TEAEs by maximum severity was similar across treatment groups. The 
percentage  of  subjects  who  discontinued  study  drug  due  to  an  adverse  event  was  similar  across  all 
treatment groups. In total, 22 (1.7%) subjects discontinued study drug due to an  AE and 6 (0.5%) 
subjects due to a drug-related TEAE. 
The  most  common  system  organ  classes  of  TEAEs  were  infections  and  infestations  (9.2%),  nervous 
system disorders (7.8%) and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (5.1%). 
The incidences of TEAEs were higher in the avanafil groups than in the placebo group in the following 
system  organ:  nervous  system  disorders  (placebo,  3.4%;  avanafil  50  mg,  6.9%;  avanafil  100  mg, 
8.9%; and avanafil 200 mg, 11.6%); vascular disorders (placebo, 0.6%; avanafil 50 mg, 3.7%; avanafil 
100 mg, 6.3%; and avanafil 200 mg, 4.0%); and gastrointestinal disorders (placebo, 2.6%; avanafil 50 
mg, 4.1%; avanafil 100 mg, 4.3%; and avanafil 200 mg, 5.4%). 
The incidences of the following TEAEs were higher in the avanafil groups than in the placebo group: 
upper respiratory tract infection (placebo, 0.3%; avanafil 50 mg, 1.8%; avanafil 100 mg, 1.1%; and 
avanafil 200 mg, 1.4%); influenza: (placebo, 0.0%; avanafil 50 mg, 0.5%; avanafil 100 mg, 1.7%; and 
avanafil 200 mg, 0.3%); headache (placebo, 1.7%; avanafil 50 mg, 5.1%; avanafil 100 mg, 6.9%; and 
avanafil 200 mg, 10.5%); nasal congestion (placebo, 1.1%; avanafil 50 mg, 1.8%; avanafil 100 mg, 
2.9%; and avanafil 200 mg, 2.0%); sinus congestion (placebo, 0.3%; avanafil 50 mg, 0.5%; avanafil 
100 mg, 0.9%; and avanafil 200 mg, 1.7%); flushing (placebo, 0.0%; avanafil 50 mg, 3.2%; avanafil 
100 mg, 4.3%; and avanafil 200 mg, 4.0%); and dyspepsia (placebo, 0.0%; avanafil 50 mg, 0.5%; 
avanafil 100 mg, 0.6%; and avanafil 200 mg, 1.4%). 
In study TA-05, the incidence of headache was higher in the avanafil 300 mg group (26.3%) than the 
other treatment groups (placebo [3.6%], avanafil 50 mg [7.1%], avanafil 100 mg (11.7%), and avanafil 
200 mg [12.5%]). No major differences in the incidences of other specific TEAEs were observed between 
avanafil 300 mg and the other treatment groups.  
In the Phase III double-blind cohort, 343 (33.2%) subjects had a TEAE, being the incidence of TEAEs 
higher  in  the  avanafil  groups  (32.5%  to  39.2%)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (25.1%).  Overall,  103 
(10.0%) subjects had a TEAE that was considered related to study drug. The incidence of drug-related 
TEAEs was higher in the avanafil groups (8.8% to 15.7%) than in the placebo group (3.1%). 
Most of the TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. The distribution of TEAEs by maximum severity 
was similar across treatment groups. Overall, 22 (2.1%) subjects discontinued study drug due to an AE.

The percentage of subjects who discontinued study drug was similar for the treatment groups. In total, 
6 (0.6%) subjects discontinued study drug due to a drug-related TEAE. 
The incidences of TEAEs in the following system organ classes were higher in the avanafil groups than in 
the placebo group: infections and infestations (placebo, 6.5%; avanafil 50 mg, 8.1%; avanafil 100 mg, 
10.1%; and avanafil 200 mg, 9.6%); nervous system disorders (placebo, 3.1%; avanafil 50 mg, 5.6%; 
avanafil  100  mg,  7.6%;  and  avanafil  200  mg,  11.6%);  gastrointestinal  disorders  (placebo,  2.4%; 
avanafil  50  mg,  5.6%;  avanafil  100  mg,  4.2%;  and  avanafil  200  mg,  5.1%);  vascular  disorders 
(placebo,  0.3%;  avanafil  50  mg,  4.4%;  avanafil  100  mg,  6.3%;  and  avanafil  200  mg,  3.8%);  and 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (placebo, 1.7%; avanafil 50 mg, 2.5%; avanafil 100 mg, 
4.9%; and avanafil 200 mg, 5.1%). 
The incidences of the following TEAEs were higher in the avanafil groups than in the placebo group: 
influenza (placebo, 0.0%; avanafil 50 mg, 0.6%; avanafil 100 mg, 1.7%; and avanafil 200 mg, 0.3%); 
headache  (placebo,  1.4%;  avanafil  50  mg,  4.4%;  avanafil  100  mg,  5.9%;  and  avanafil  200  mg, 
10.2%); dyspepsia (placebo, 0.0%; avanafil 50 mg, 0.6%; avanafil 100 mg, 0.3%; and avanafil 200 
mg, 1.4%); and flushing (placebo, 0.0%; avanafil 50 mg, 3.8%; avanafil 100 mg, 4.2%; and avanafil 
200 mg, 3.8%). 
In  study  TA-303,  106  (35.6%)  subjects  had  a  TEAE:  23  (23.0%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group,  38 
(38.4%) subjects in the avanafil 100 mg group and 45 (45.5%) subjects in the avanafil 200 mg group. 
Forty (13.4%) subjects had a TEAE that was considered related to study drug: 4 (4.0%) subjects in the 
placebo  group,  13  (13.1%)  subjects  in  the  avanafil  100  mg  group  and  23  (23.2%)  subjects  in  the 
avanafil 200 mg group. Most of the TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. The distributions of TEAEs 
by maximum severity were similar for the treatment groups. Six (2.0%) subjects discontinued study 
drug due to an AE: 1 (1.0%) subject in the placebo group, 3 (3.0%) subjects in the avanafil 100 mg 
group and 2 (2.0%) subjects in the avanafil 200 mg group. For 2 (2.0%) subjects in the avanafil 100 mg 
group  and  1  (1.0%)  subject  in  the  avanafil  200  mg  group,  the  AE  that  led  to  discontinuation  was 
considered to be related to study drug.  
For the placebo group in study TA 303, the most common system organ classes of TEAEs were infections 
and  infestations  (7.0%),  investigations  (4.0%)  and  injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications 
(4.0%).  For  the  avanafil  100  mg  group,  the  most  common  system  organ  classes  of  TEAEs  were 
infections and infestations (10.1%), nervous system disorders (10.1%) and vascular disorders (7.1%). 
For the avanafil 200 mg group, the most common system organ classes of TEAEs were investigations 
(14.1%), nervous system disorders (13.1%), and vascular disorders (11.1%). 
The incidences of TEAEs in the following system organ classes were higher in both of the avanafil groups 
than in the placebo group: infections and infestations (placebo, 7.0%; avanafil 100 mg, 10.1%; and 
avanafil  200  mg,  9.1%);  nervous  system  disorders  (placebo,  2.0%;  avanafil  100  mg,  10.1%;  and 
avanafil 200 mg, 13.1%); investigations (placebo, 4.0%; avanafil 100 mg, 6.1%; and avanafil 200 mg, 
14.1%);  vascular  disorders  (placebo,  0.0%;  avanafil  100  mg,  7.1%;  and  avanafil  200  mg,  11.1%); 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (placebo, 2.0%; avanafil 100 mg, 3.0%; and avanafil 
200  mg,  6.1%);  and  eye  disorders  (placebo,  0.0%;  avanafil  100  mg,  1.0%;  and  avanafil  200  mg, 
2.0%). 
For the placebo group, the most frequently reported TEAE (preferred term) was bronchitis (4.0%), while 
for the avanafil 100 mg group, the most frequently reported TEAEs were headache (8.1%), flushing 
(5.1%), nasopharyngitis (3.0%), back pain (3.0%) and nasal congestion (3.0%). For the avanafil 200 
mg  group,  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were  headache  (12.1%),  flushing  (10.1%),

nasopharyngitis  (5.1%),  electrocardiogram  abnormal  (3.0%)  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection 
(3.0%).  
The incidences of the following TEAEs were higher in both avanafil groups than in the placebo group and 
increased with dose: headache (placebo, 1.0%; avanafil 100 mg, 8.1%; and avanafil 200 mg, 12.1%); 
flushing  (placebo,  0.0%;  avanafil  100  mg,  5.1%;  and  avanafil  200  mg,  10.1%);  nasopharyngitis 
(placebo,  0.0%;  avanafil  100  mg,  3.0%;  and  avanafil  200  mg,  5.1%);  electrocardiogram  abnormal 
(placebo, 0.0%; avanafil 100 mg, 1.0%; and avanafil 200 mg, 3.0%); upper respiratory tract infection 
(placebo, 0.0%; avanafil 100 mg, 2.0%; and avanafil 200 mg, 3.0%); and dizziness (placebo, 0.0%; 
avanafil 100 mg, 1.0%; and avanafil 200 mg, 2.0%). 
In the long-term safety analysis set (study TA-314), 275 (38.7%) subjects had a TEAE and 79 (11.1%) 
subjects had a TEAE that was considered to be related to study drug. Most of the TEAEs were mild or 
moderate in severity, 21 (3.0%) subjects had a TEAE that was considered severe in severity. Twenty 
(2.8%) subjects discontinued study drug due to a TEAE, and for 10 (1.4%) of these subjects, the AE that 
led  to  discontinuation  was  considered  to  be  related  to  study  drug.  The  most  common  system  organ 
classes  of  TEAEs  were  infections  and  infestations  (12.2%),  nervous  system  disorders  (7.9%), 
musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (5.5%),  vascular  disorders  (5.3%),  gastrointestinal 
disorders  (5.1%)  and  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (4.2%).  The  most  frequently 
reported  TEAEs  (preferred  terms)  were  headache  (5.6%),  flushing  (3.5%),  nasopharyngitis  (3.4%), 
nasal  congestion  (2.1%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (1.5%),  influenza  (1.5%)  and  back  pain 
(1.5%). The incidence of these events was higher in the avanafil 200 mg group than in the avanafil 100 
mg group.  
Drug-Related Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
In the double-blind cohort (Table 20), the incidences of TEAEs were higher in the avanafil groups than in 
the placebo group in the following system organ classes: nervous system disorders (placebo, 1.1%; 
avanafil  50  mg,  4.6%;  avanafil  100  mg,  6.3%;  and  avanafil  200  mg,  9.1%);  vascular  disorders 
(placebo,  0.3%;  avanafil  50  mg,  2.8%;  avanafil  100  mg,  4.6%;  and  avanafil  200  mg,  4.0%);  and 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (placebo, 1.1%; avanafil 50 mg, 1.8%; avanafil 100 mg, 
2.9%; and avanafil 200 mg, 3.7%). 
The  incidences  of  the  following  drug-related  TEAEs  were  higher  in  the  avanafil  groups  than  in  the 
placebo group: headache (placebo, 1.1%; avanafil 50 mg, 4.6%; avanafil 100 mg, 5.7%; and avanafil 
200 mg, 8.8%); flushing (placebo, 0.0%; avanafil 50 mg, 2.8%; avanafil 100 mg, 4.3%; and avanafil 
200 mg, 4.0%); and nasal congestion (placebo, 0.9%; avanafil 50 mg, 1.8%; avanafil 100 mg, 2.0%; 
and avanafil 200 mg, 1.7%). 
In the Phase III double-blind cohort, the incidences of drug-related TEAEs were similar to those in the 
double-blind cohort.  
In study TA 303, for the avanafil 100 mg group, the most frequently reported drug-related TEAEs were 
flushing (5.1%), headache (5.1%), nasal congestion (3.0%) and hot flush (2.0%). For the avanafil 200 
mg group, the most frequently reported drug-related TEAEs were flushing (10.1%), headache (8.1%) 
and electrocardiogram abnormal (2.0%). All other drug-related TEAEs were reported by only 1 subject 
in a treatment group.  
The incidences of the following drug-related TEAEs were higher in one or both avanafil groups than in the 
placebo group and increased with dose: headache (placebo, 1.0%; avanafil 100 mg, 5.1%; and avanafil 
200 mg, 8.1%) and flushing (placebo, 0.0%; avanafil 100 mg, 5.1%; and avanafil 200 mg, 10.1%).

In the long-term safety analysis set (study TA-314), the most frequently reported drug-related TEAEs 
were headache (4.4%), flushing (3.4%), nasal congestion (1.5%), dizziness (0.7%), dyspepsia (0.6%) 
and nausea (0.4%). 
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by Severity 
Overall,  most  of  the  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity  and  showed  a  similar  distribution  by 
maximum  severity  across  treatment  groups.  In  the  double-blind  cohort,  19  (1.5%)  subjects  had  a 
severe TEAE: 4 (1.1%) subjects in the placebo group, 2 (0.9%) subjects in the avanafil 50 mg group, 9 
(2.6%) subjects in the avanafil 100 mg group and 4 (1.1%) subjects in the avanafil 200 mg group. The 
most frequently reported severe TEAE was headache (2 subjects). 
Distributions of TEAEs by maximum severity in the Phase III double-blind cohort were similar to those in 
the double-blind cohort.  
In study TA-303, 3 (1.0%) subjects had a severe TEAE: 1 (1.0%) subject in the placebo group with 
gastroesophageal reflux disease, 1 (1.0%) subject in the avanafil 100 mg group with dyspepsia and 1 
(1.0%) subjects in the8 avanafil 200 mg group with cataract and epistaxis. One subject taking avanafil 
100 mg had 3 TEAEs (dyspepsia) that were considered to be severe and related to study drug. The 
events resolved after the subject was permanently discontinued from study drug.  
In  the  long-term  safety  analysis  set  (study  TA-314),  most  of  the  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in 
severity, and 21 (2.9%) subjects had a severe TEAE. Two (0.3%) of these subjects had 1 or more severe 
drug-related TEAEs. Of these 2 subjects, one of them discontinued the study drug. The TEAEs for both 
subjects resolved. 
Regarding targeted medical events, the reporting of cardiovascular events was low and similar across 
treatment groups. Special sensory (vision or hearing) events were reported with low frequency, which is 
expected, since the known incidence of these events is low and with other PDE5 inhibitors has been 
mostly reported in the post-marketing setting.  
In the double-blind cohort, the incidence of upper respiratory TEAEs was higher in the avanafil 100 mg 
(12.6%) and avanafil 200 mg (12.2%) groups than in the avanafil 50 mg (6.6%) and placebo (6.6%) 
groups. The incidences hemodynamic changes TEAEs, major cardiac events and special sensory effects 
were  low  and  similar  across  treatments.  One  subject  (in  study  TA-301)  had  an  acute  myocardial 
infarction 4 days after the last dose of study drug (avanafil 50mg). The subject recovered from the event 
and was discontinued from the study. The investigator considered the event of myocardial infarction as 
severe  and  not  related  to  study  drug  (the  subject  had  a  long  history  of  non-compliance  with 
hypertension treatment and severe multi-vessel coronary artery disease). No TEAE of hypotension or 
priapism were reported.  
In the Phase III double-blind cohort, the incidence of upper respiratory events (6.2% placebo, 8.1% 
avanafil 50 mg, 11.1% avanafil 100 mg and 10.9% avanafil 200 mg) was similar to those seen in the 
double blind cohort. The incidences of reported hemodynamic changes TEAEs, major cardiac events and 
special sensory effects were low and similar for the treatments. No TEAE of hypotension or priapism was 
reported in this cohort. 
In study TA-303, the incidence of upper respiratory events was higher in the avanafil 100 mg and 200 
mg  groups  (10.1%  and  11.1%,  respectively)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (7.0%).  The  most  common 
upper respiratory event was nasopharyngitis, which appeared to be a dose-related TEAE (0.0% in the 
placebo group, 3.0% in the avanafil 100 mg group and 5.1% in the avanafil 200 mg group), as well as 
upper respiratory tract infections (0.0% in the placebo group, 2.0% in the avanafil 100 mg group and 
3.0% in the avanafil 200 mg group).

Four subjects had a TEAE categorized as hemodynamic changes (dizziness for 3 avanafil subjects [one 
in the 100mg group, 2 in the 200mg group] and syncope for one placebo subject). Three subjects had 
TEAEs categorized as special sensory effects (vision blurred for one subject on avanafil 100 mg and 
cataracts for 2 subjects on avanafil 200 mg). No subject had a TEAE categorized as priapism or major 
cardiac events. 
In study TA-314, 80 (11.3%) subjects had 1 or more upper respiratory TEAEs, with higher incidence in 
the avanafil 200 mg group (11.5%) than in the avanafil 100 mg group (4.1%), most of the, of mild or 
moderate in severity, with the exception of  4 of subjects who had severe TEAEs. The most common 
upper respiratory TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (3.4%) and nasal congestion (2.1%).  
Ten (1.4%) subjects had a haemodynamic change TEAE (9 subjects with dizziness and 1 subject with 
syncope vasovagal). No differences were observed between the avanafil 100 mg group and the avanafil 
200 mg group in the incidence of these events. All of the TEAEs of dizziness were mild or moderate in 
severity and the TEAE of syncope vasovagal was a SAE moderate in severity (the subject developed 
symptoms  after  administration  of  mepivacaine  local  anesthesia  at  the  dentist’s  office,  the  events 
resolved within 1 hour; the investigator considered the event not related to study drug and the subject 
continued in the study).   
Four (0.6%) subjects had a special hearing sensory TEAE (2 subjects with vertigo, 1 subject with motion 
sickness and 1 subject with tinnitus). The TEAEs of vertigo and tinnitus were mild in severity and the 
TEAE of motion sickness was moderate in severity. Three (0.4%) subjects had a TEAE categorized as 
special vision sensory effects (1 subject with photophobia, 1 subject with blurred vision and 1 subject 
with cyanopsia). The TEAEs of photophobia, blurred vision and cyanopsia were mild in severity. 
Three (0.4%) subjects had a TEAE categorized as “priapism” while taking avanafil 200 mg (2 subjects 
with increased erection of mild severity and 1 subject with spontaneous penile erection). One of the 
TEAEs of increased erection was mild in severity and the other was moderate in severity; the TEAE of 
spontaneous penile erection was mild in severity. These events did not meet the clinical definition of 
priapism (i.e., an erection lasting longer than 4 hours). 
No subject had a TEAE of hypotension or a major cardiac event in study TA-314.  
Subgroup safety analyses based on certain special groups (age and race) and situations (diabetic status, 
hypertension status, alpha-blocker usage and coronary artery disease status) have been performed. No 
subgroup  analysis  based  on  weight/BMI  was  provided  with  the  initial  submission.  Taking  into 
consideration  that  the  average  anthropometric  measures  were  not  those  expected  for  European 
subjects, the Applicant was asked to provide safety data based on the several BMI subgroups. It is noted 
that  the  overall  AEs  and  drug-related  AEs  for  the  avanafil-treated  subjects  were  more  frequent  in 
subjects with a BMI<25 (normal BMI subjects), and a dose-related increase was observed. Adequate 
wording should be included in the SPC regarding the expected increase in AE frequency in subjects with 
a BMI below 25.  
In  the  age-based  subgroup  analysis,  AE  incidences  per  dose  are  similar  across  all  age  groups,  with 
exception of avanafil 200mg in ≥65 years old subjects. In this age group, an increase in AE frequency 
was observed.   
In  the  race-based  subgroup  analysis,  incidence  of  TEAE  seemed  to  be  higher  in  non-black  subjects 
incidence of targeted medical events were similar for both race subgroups. 
With regards to diabetic status at baseline, the incidence of reported AEs was higher in the non-diabetics 
for all treatment groups (including placebo), then in the diabetics. A similar trend was observed based 
on hypertension status at baseline.

EMA/321885/2013 
Page 98/112 
 
 
  
Based on coronary artery disease history at baseline, more subjects with coronary artery disease treated 
with avanafil 200 mg reported an SAE than those without a history of coronary disease.  
Among subjects with concomitant alpha-blocker use, the subjects assigned to avanafil 200mg reported 
a higher incidence of TEAEs, drug-related TEAEs and SAEs, as it would be expected due to the additive 
hypotensive effects of both drugs. 
Serious adverse event and deaths 
One death was reported in the entire avanafil clinical program (subject was assigned to avanafil100 mg 
group  of  study  TA-301);  the  event  was  considered  not  related  to  study  drug  (self-inflicted  gunshot 
wound). In total, in the double-blind cohort, 18 (1.4%) subjects had a SAE. The incidence of SAEs was 
similar across all treatment groups, none of the SAEs were considered by the investigators to be related 
to study drug. In total, 22 (1.7%) subjects discontinued study drug due to an AE. 
Laboratory findings 
With regards to laboratory values and vital signs abnormalities, no new or unexpected signals have been 
identified.  
Vital Signs 
In  the  Double-Blind  Cohort,  the  incidences  of  abnormal  increases/decreases  in  SBP  or  DBP  in  the 
double-blind cohort were low and similar across treatment groups. Similar incidences were observed in 
the Phase 3 double-blind cohort. In study TA-303, one subject in the avanafil 200 mg group (Subject 
337-005) had an adverse event of hypertension that led to discontinuation of study drug. The event was 
moderate in severity and was not considered to be related to study drug. The outcome of the event was 
not resolved.  
Electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters and physical examination findings were not summarized for the 
integrated cohorts. 
Safety in special populations 
Subjects with severe renal or hepatic failure were excluded from the clinical studies; therefore no safety 
data is available for this subpopulation of patients. Further safety (as well as efficacy) data from patients 
with impaired hepatic/renal function included in the pivotal studies or the open label extension study 
TA-314 was provided and did not show any new safety signals. However, no clinical data are available 
from subjects with mild-moderate hepatic impairment. 
With regards to age, the number and percentage of subjects ≥ 70 years of age across the clinical studies 
is rather small. The small number of subjects precludes from making a specific recommendation at this 
time. 
Immunological events 
This was regarded as not applicable and accepted by the CHMP.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Avanafil  metabolism  is  principally  mediated  by  the  CYP  isoforms  3A4  (major  route)  and  2C9  (minor 
route). In vivo studies have shown a relevant decrease of avanafil metabolism with up to 13-14 fold 
increase in AUC and 3 fold increase in Cmax of avanafil  in presence of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as 
ketoconazol or ritonavir. Therefore, the use of avanafil is contraindicated with the concomitant use of 
potent  CYP3A4  inhibitors  (including  ketoconazole,  ritonavir,  atazanavir,  clarithromycin,  indinavir, 
itraconazole,  nefazodone,  nelfinavir,  saquinavir  and  telithromycin).  With  regards  to  less  moderate 
CYP3A4  inhibitors  inhibitors  (including  erythromycin,  amprenavir,  aprepitant,  diltiazem,  fluconazole, 
fosamprenavir, and verapamil), the maximum recommended dose of avanafil should not exceed 100 mg 
as advised in the SPC on a minimum interval interdoses (e.g. 48 hours).  
After in vitro studies, avanafil is a potential inhibitor of CYP 2C19, 2C8, 2C9 and 2D6. Interaction studies 
have  been  performed  evaluating  the  effect  of  avanafil  on  specific  substrates  (e.g.  omeprazol, 
rosiglitazone, and desipramine) as well as with digoxine to explore effect through pGp transporter. The 
studies evaluated the effect of single doses of avanafil 200 mg on other medicines pharmacokinetics, 
which  is  well  in  accordance  with  the  expected  use  of  avanafil  but  could  have  not  explored  the  full 
potential for interaction. Nevertheless, no safety concerns are expected from avanafil affecting other 
medicinal products of possible common use in this population through those mechanisms. 
With regard to pharmacodynamic interactions, there is a safety concern due to the potential addition of 
hypotensive effects when avanafil is taken concomitantly with nitrates or hypotensive medicines, as well 
as  acute  intake  of  alcohol.  Interaction  studies  in  healthy  volunteers  with  nitrates,  alpha-blockers, 
amlodipine  and  enalapril  have  shown  different  magnitudes  of  effect,  in  general  of  little  relevance. 
Nevertheless attention should be paid on this hypotensive effect in real cardiovascular patients, elderly 
or  with  polimedication.  A  contraindication  has  been  established  for  concomitant  use  of  nitrates  and 
several precautions are also set with regards to concomitant use of hypotensive medicines and alcohol. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No important differences in the incidence of adverse events that resulted in study drug discontinuation 
were observed between the following subgroups: age, race, diabetic status, baseline hypertension, 
concomitant alpha-blocker use. 
Four  (8.0%)  subjects  with  coronary  artery  disease  at  baseline  treated  with  avanafil  200  mg 
experienced adverse events resulting in study drug discontinuation compared to 2 (0.7%) subjects 
without coronary artery disease at baseline treated with avanafil 200 mg. No other differences in the 
incidences  of  adverse  events  resulting  in  study  drug  discontinuation  were  observed  between  the 
baseline coronary artery disease status subgroups. 
Post marketing experience 
Avanafil is not yet marketed in any country and no post-marketing data are available. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
For  the  safety  analysis,  the  Applicant  has  defined  two  analysis  cohorts  for  safety  analyses: 
the Double-Blind Cohort (subjects from the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies TA-05, TA-301 
and TA-302) and the phase III Double-Blind Cohort (subjects from two of the phase III, double-blind, 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/321885/2013 
Page 100/112 
 
 
  
 
 
 
placebo-controlled studies TA-301 and TA-302). Safety data from the other phase III pivotal study 
(TA-303) and the open-label extension study (TA-314) were presented separately. The most relevant 
target population for safety analysis should be the cohort consisting of subjects who were included in 
all three phase III placebo-controlled pivotal studies, which consists of the largest placebo-controlled 
pool and comprises the primary population for safety analysis considered to be representative of the 
main target population. Therefore, the Applicant was requested to provide a new safety analysis based 
on this new double-blind cohort (including all three phase III trials and the dose-finding phase II study 
TA-05), which is considered to be the primary population for safety analysis. On the basis of the new 
double-bling  cohort  analysis,  the  incidence  of  TEAEs  was  higher  in  the  avanafil  groups  (31.3%  to 
39.7%) than in the placebo group (24.9%). In total in the Avanafil-treated groups, 15.2% of patients 
had a TEAE that was considered related to study drug compared to 4.2% in the placebo group; the 
distribution of TEAE related to study drug showed a dose-dependent trend (from 10.6% to 18.6%). 
Most of drug-related TEAEs were mild to moderate and severity tended to increase with the dose. The 
incidence of SAEs in the new double-blind cohort was low (from 0.9% to 1,6% in the avanafil groups). 
There was no SAE considered related to study drug. In total, 28 (1.8%) subjects discontinued study 
drug due to an adverse event. Discontinuation due to drug-related TEAEs was less than 1%.  
The  most  common  system  organ  classes  of  TEAEs  in  the  avanafil  groups  were  infections  and 
infestations  (9.1%),  nervous  system  disorders  (7.9%),  vascular  disorders  (5.6%),  musculoskeletal 
and connective tissue disorders (4.8%), and gastrointestinal (4.7%), all AEs known to be associated 
with the drug class of PDE inhibitors. The incidences of TEAEs in each of these system organ classes 
was  higher  in  the  avanafil  groups  than  in  the  placebo  group,  with  the  exception  of  infections  and 
infestations where similar incidences were observed for the placebo and the 50 mg avanafil dose. The 
most commonly reported TEAEs were: Headache (8.2%), Flushing (4.6%), Nasal congestion (2.2%) 
and Back pain (2.1%).  
The most common AEs, headache, flushing, nasal congestion, and dyspepsia occurred more than once 
in roughly half of the patients who experienced them. Discontinuation due to AEs was low (2% in the 
avanafil  group  vs.  1.3  %  in  the  placebo  group),  for  drug-related  TEAE  the  percentage  of 
discontinuation  was  less  0.8%  in  the  avanafil  group  vs.  0%  in  the  placebo  group.  There  were  7 
withdrawals due to headache considered related to avanafil: 1 in the 50 mg dose group, 3 in the 100 
mg  group,  4  in  the  200  mg  group,  and  1  in  the  300  mg  group.  Two  withdrawals  were  caused  by 
cardiovascular AEs (angina pectoris and decreased energy and shortness of breath).  
The percentage of severe TEAEs increased in the group of patients with Hypertension, Diabetes, or 
Benign  Prostatic  Hypertrophy  treated  with  avanafil    compared  with  the  general  patient  population 
(3.1% vs. 1.7), whereas no change was observed in the placebo group (2.0 general population vs. 2.1 
co-morbidity population).  From the data submitted by the applicant it is not possible to evaluate which 
severe TEAE increased in frequency compared to the general population. The specific TEAEs showing a 
trend towards increased frequency, independently of severity, were upper respiratory tract infections 
(2.9 % avanafil vs. 1.6% placebo), sinus congestion (1.6 vs. 0.9%), and nasopharyngitis (3.3% vs. 
2.8%). 
In conclusion, no relevant differences were observed between the safety profile derived from the new 
double-blind  cohort  and  that  identified  on  the  basis  of  the  original  safety  cohort  proposed  by  the 
applicant. However, an increased frequency of severe TEAEs was observed in the group of patients with 
Hypertension,  Diabetes,  or  Benign  Prostatic  Hypertrophy  treated  with  avanafil  compared  with  the 
general patient population. Based on additional analyses provided by the Applicant, which showed that 
the  frequencies  of  severe  events  were  low  and  not  dose  related,  it  is  not  expected  that  this 
sub-population would be at greater risk with use of avanafil. 
Demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  in  both  of  the  safety  cohorts  and  the  individual  studies 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/321885/2013 
Page 101/112 
 
 
  
(TA-303 and TA-314) are comparable to those from the integrated analysis efficacy population, which 
have already been assessed in the efficacy section. No subgroup analysis based on weight/BMI was 
provided  with  the  initial  submission.  Taking  into  consideration  that  the  average  anthropometric 
measures were not those expected for European subjects, the Applicant was asked to provide safety 
data based on the several BMI subgroups. It is noted that the overall AEs and drug-related AEs for the 
avanafil-treated subjects were more frequent in subjects with a BMI<25 (normal BMI subjects), and a 
dose-related increase was observed. The expected increase in AE frequency in subjects with a BMI 
below 25 has been included in section 4.8 of the SPC.  
The overall safety profile for avanafil seems to be in line with that known for other PDE5 inhibitors 
already  authorised  and  no  new  safety  signals  have  been  observed.  In  the  largest  safety  cohort 
provided by the Applicant (double-blind cohort), approximately a third of the subjects reported a TEAE, 
with a higher incidence in the avanafil treatment groups, although a clear dose-related trend could not 
be  identified.  With  regards  to  severity,  the  majority  of  the  events  were  mild-moderate  in  severity, 
including the drug-related TEAEs.  
Regarding targeted medical events, the reporting of cardiovascular events was low and similar across 
treatment groups. Special sensory (vision or hearing) events were reported with low frequency, which 
is expected, since the known incidence of these events is low and with other PDE5 inhibitors has been 
mostly reported in the post-marketing setting.  
No  subjects  reported  hypotension  TEAEs.  Events  possibly  related  to  hypotension  (dizziness, 
hypotension,  syncope  or  orthostatic  hypotension)  were  also  reported  with  low  frequency  across  all 
treatment groups, including placebo. Taking into account that hypotension is a known class effect for 
PDE5 inhibitors, it is uncertain whether the population included would be a “lower cardiovascular” risk 
population.  Therefore,  special  attention  should  be  paid  to  cardiovascular  events  (hemodynamic 
changes, major cardiovascular events and other relevant cardiovascular events), as described in the 
RMP. 
Incidence of SAEs reported across the individual studies and in the integrated safety cohorts was low 
and generally considered by the investigators not related with the study drug. 
Subgroup  analyses  based  on  certain  special  groups  (age  and  race)  and  situations  (diabetic  status, 
hypertension status, alpha-blocker usage and coronary artery disease status) have been performed. 
Safety profile in the different age subgroups has been characterized. However, further assessment of 
the safety in the older population was requested. The small number in certain age subgroups (such as 
subjects older than 75 years) do not allow for making a specific recommendation. The wording of the 
SPC reflects the limited number of very elderly subjects included in the clinical studies. Furthermore, 
elderly males of >70 years of age have been included as missing information and will be specifically 
monitored. 
In the race-based subgroup analysis, incidence of TEAE seemed to be higher in non-black subjects, 
while the incidence of targeted medical events was similar for both race subgroups. 
Furthermore  a  higher  incidence  reporting  of  AEs  was  found  in  the  diabetic  subgroup  (at  baseline) 
compared  to  the  non-diabetics  for  all  treatment  groups  (including  placebo).  A  similar  trend  was 
observed based on hypertension status at baseline.  
An increased amount of subjects with coronary artery disease history (at baseline) and treated with 
avanafil 200 mg reported an SAE compared with those without a history of coronary disease. In that 
same subpopulation, more subjects with coronary artery disease at baseline treated with avanafil 200 
mg experienced AE resulting in study drug discontinuation compared with subjects without coronary 
artery disease at baseline treated with avanafil 200 mg. This concludes that the 200mg avanafil dose 
is not well tolerated by this subgroup of patients and caution should be exercised when avanafil doses 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/321885/2013 
Page 102/112 
 
 
  
over  100mg  are  used.  In  addition,  information  on  the  interaction  with  medicinal  products  reducing 
systemic blood pressure has been included in the SmPC. 
Among subjects with concomitant alpha-blocker use, the subjects assigned to avanafil 200mg reported 
a higher incidence of TEAEs, drug-related TEAEs and SAEs, as it would be expected due to the additive 
hypotensive effects of both drugs. The number of subjects with concomitant alpha-blocker and avanafil 
use  was  low  (n=22)  to  reach  a  robust  conclusion.  The  SmPC  indicates  that  concomitant  use  of 
alpha-blockers treatment with avanafil should be started at the lowest dose. 
With regards to laboratory values and vital signs abnormalities, no new or unexpected signals have 
been  identified.  A  specific  assessment  of  avanafil  effect  on  vital  signs  was  done  in  the  clinical 
pharmacology trials. 
Mild-moderate renal or hepatic impairments were not exclusion criteria for the pivotal studies, Further 
safety  (as  well  as  efficacy)  data  from  patients  with  impaired  hepatic/renal  function  included  in  the 
pivotal studies or the open label extension study TA-314 was requested. Additionally provided data on 
renally impaired subjects did not show any new safety signals. However, no additional clinical data are 
available from subjects with mild-moderate hepatic impairment. 
Concomitant use of avanafil and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors produces a marked increase in the plasma 
levels  of  avanfil.  That  drug-drug  interaction  was  also  observed  with  moderate  CYP3A4,  with  a  less 
pronounced increase in the plasma levels of avanafil. A significant interaction between avanafil and 
nitrates has been reported. When compared to the interaction seen between nitrates and sildenafil, the 
magnitude of the effect seems to be slightly smaller, although the clinical relevance of this difference 
is  uncertain.  The  SmPC  contraindicates  avanafil  administration  to  patients  who  are  under  chronic 
nitrate treatment.  
The Applicant has also assessed the concomitant use of avanafil with alpha-blockers and avanafil with 
antihypertensives.  As  it  would  be  expected,  those  combinations  present  additive  effects  in  blood 
pressure.  
Since avanafil can be used on a daily basis, induction of the metabolism of concomitantly administered 
drugs may be of relevance, the CHMP recommends the Applicant to post-authorisation conduct In vitro 
studies evaluating the potential of avanafil as an inducer of drug-metabolizing enzymes and submit the 
report.  Furthermore,  the  CHMP  recommends  the  Applicant  to  post-authorisation  conduct  a  study 
evaluating the potential of avanafil as inhibitor of drug transporters and submit the report as well. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The  overall  safety  profile  for  avanafil  seems  to  be  in  line  with  that  known  for  other  PDE5  inhibitors 
already authorised and no new safety signals have been observed.  
The CHMP considered that the safety profile acceptable and the SmPC has been adequately worded and 
appropriate measures are described in the risk management plan.

2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  (DDPS, 
version1.0 dated on 03-October-2012) fulfils the legislative requirements.    
The Applicant has not provided the summary of their Pharmacovigilance System Master File during the 
course of the evaluation of this procedure. Therefore, the CHMP considered that the applicant should 
provide  it  according  to  the  rules  established  by  the  new  legislation  on  pharmacovigilance  after  the 
marketing authorization has been granted. 
Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 3, the PRAC considered by consensus 
that the risk management system for avanafil (Spedra) in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) in 
adult men could be acceptable provided an updated risk management plan and satisfactory responses to 
the questions detailed in below were submitted: 
• 
The MAA is requested to complete table 4.2. (Summary of safety concerns from the non-clinical 
part of the safety specification) classifying the safety concerns into the following categories: important 
identified risks, important potential risks, important missing information. 
• 
The MAA is required to consider that patients above 70 years of age have not been adequately 
studied in the clinical trial programme instead of patients above 75 years and modify it in the different 
corresponding sections of the RMP. 
• 
 Regarding  the  lack  of  information  in  elderly  patients  the  MAA  should  include  in  each  PSUR  a 
description of the use of the drug according to the age of patients (elderly versus non-elderly) and a 
comparison  of  the  pattern  and  severity  of  reported  ADRs  between  elderly  and  non-elderly  patients 
including a discussion on whether there is a need of additional pharmacovigilance activities (i.e. a PASS) 
in order to characterize the risks in this population. 
• 
Considering that risk minimization on the safety concerns in the RMP will be addressed through 
labelling in the SmPC and PIL, it should be ensured that the final SmPC and PIL contain appropriate 
wordings.  
a. 
In particular, the MAA is requested to change the following paragraphs in the SPC of Spedra as 
follows (wording underlined), as a risk minimisation measure for the important missing information in 
elderly males > 70 years of age: 
o 
4.2 Special populations. Elderly men (≥  65 years old) 
Dose adjustments are not required in elderly patients. Data on men ≥  70 years old are limited. 
o 
5.2 subparagraph “Special populations. Geriatric” 
Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had comparable exposure to that seen in healthy younger 
volunteers (18-45 years). However, data on subjects older than 70 years are limited. 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/321885/2013 
Page 104/112 
 
 
  
b. 
Regarding  the  important  potential  risk  of  Hypotension/increased  hypotensive  effect  the  MAA 
should to add a sentence at the end of section 4.8.of the SmPC, in order to reflect that as a class effect, 
hypotension has been reported in clinical trials and post-marketing with other PDE5 inhibitors. 
• 
The  identified  risk  “Pre-existing  cardiovascular  disease  (in  men  for  who  sexual  activity  is 
inadvisable)” should be formulated as “pre-existing cardiovascular disease” also in section 1.6.3 of the 
RMP. 
• 
The MAA is requested to provide in the RMP detailed milestones for the on-going studies (Human 
study TA-401 and Human study TA-402) included in the Pharmacovigilance Plan. 
• 
The  Summary  of  the  RMP  should  be  updated  including  the  requirements  contained  in  this 
assessment report. 
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Overall the pooled efficacy data showed that the avanafil doses tested in the main efficacy trials (50 mg, 
100mg and 200mg), elicited a statistical significant improvement (p< 0.001 vs. baseline for the three 
co-primary efficacy endpoints (percentage of successful vaginal penetrations, percentage of successful 
intercourses  and  changes  in  the  IIEF  score),  although  the  magnitude  of  the  observed  effect  for  the 
avanafil 50mg dose was smaller.  
In the general population of patients with ED, avanafil, at both the 100 mg and 200 mg doses, resulted 
in a roughly 30% gain over placebo in the percentage of successful intercourses and 20% increase in 
vaginal penetration; while the delta in IIEF was greater than 5 points (p<0.001 for all comparisons). No 
statistical difference was observed between the 100 mg and 200 mg doses for any primary endpoint. 
Similar results were obtained for the secondary endpoints. Roughly 60-70 % of subjects treated with 
100 mg or 200 mg gave a positive global assessment questionnaire (GAQ) evaluation of the received 
treatment  compared  to  27%  of  subjects  on  placebo.  Future  interest  in  receiving  treatment  was 
expressed in 58-67 % of subjects treated with 100 mg and 200 mg doses, respectively, compared to 
27%  of  subjects  who  received  placebo.  Slightly  lower  percentages  of  subjects  declared  themselves 
interested  in  future  use  of  avanafil,  compared  to  those  who  declared  to  have  experienced  erection 
improvement. These findings appear consistent with the indication of the medicinal product in a general 
population of subjects with ED. 
In subjects with ED and diabetes mellitus, avanafil, at 100 mg and 200 mg doses, resulted in a roughly 
15% (100 mg) -20% (200 mg) gain over placebo in the percentage of successful intercourses, and in 
14-18% increase in vaginal penetration (p<0.001 vs. baseline for each endpoint); while the delta in IIEF 
with  placebo  was  smaller  than  the  previously  planned  difference  of  3  points  (2.8;  C.I.1.0-4.5).  The 
reduced efficacy of avanafil in the ED subjects with diabetes mellitus was expected and is in line with the 
generally observed lower efficacy of PDE5 inhibitors in this patient population.  
In  subjects  with  ED  following  a  nerve-sparing  prostatectomy,  a  statistically  significant  improvement 
over baseline for all three primary efficacy endpoints was observed for Avanafil in subjects. Comparison 
between the two doses (100 vs. 200 mg) was not performed. The overall rates of achieving an erection

sufficient for penetration were 32% in patients receiving avanafil 100 mg and 41% in those receiving 
200 mg, compared to the 20% rate observed with placebo. The overall rate of maintenance of erection 
to complete a successful intercourse were 23% in patients receiving avanafil 100 mg and 27% in those 
receiving  200  mg,  compared  to  the  9%  achieved  with  placebo.  These  findings  were  statistically 
significant.  
The maintenance of the effect beyond 12 weeks was assessed in an open label extension study with a 
52-week treatment period (TA-314). Patients from two of the three double blind pivotal studies were 
recruited in this study. All patients started with a 100 mg dose regardless of the treatment that they had 
received on the double blind study. They could escalate to 200 mg or decrease to 50 mg depending on 
response  and  tolerance.  Overall,  the  mean  percentage  of  sexual  attempts  resulting  in  successful 
intercourse was 42.1% during the final month of the qualifying study and 66.6% during the 52-week 
treatment period; the mean change in the percentage of attempts resulting in successful intercourse 
was 24.5%. There were little differences of results for the avanafil 100mg only group and 100-200mg 
group. These data seem to suggest that subjects who respond successfully with avanafil treatment are 
likely to continue responding over time. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Avanafil is the fourth PDE5 inhibitor to be authorised in the EU. The study design of the pivotal trials was 
performed in line with other available PDE5 inhibitors on the market. Unfortunately, no comparison was 
made with other PDE5 inhibitors to allow a better understanding of the efficacy results in the context of 
the current standard of care for treatment of ED.  
Although the avanafil clinical development program allowed inclusion of males with no upper age limit, 
due to the low number of elderly subjects enrolled, it is uncertain whether the efficacy and safety profiles 
have  been  well  characterized  in  this  subgroup  of  subjects,  especially  the  very  elderly  subjects  (≥75 
years old). This has been adequately addressed in the SmPC and the risk management plan. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The  overall  safety  profile  for  avanafil  seems  to  be  in  line  with  that  known  for  other  PDE5  inhibitors 
already  authorised  and  no  new  safety  signals  have  been  observed.  In  the  largest  safety  cohort, 
approximately a third of the subjects reported a TEAE, with a higher incidence in the avanafil treatment 
groups compared to placebo, although a clear dose-related trend could not be identified. With regards to 
severity, the majority of the events were mild-moderate in severity, including the drug-related TEAEs. 
The incidences of the following TEAEs were higher in the avanafil groups than in the placebo group: 
upper respiratory tract infection (placebo, 0.3%; avanafil 1.1-1.8%) influenza (placebo, 0.0%; avanafil 
0.3-1.7%), headache (placebo, 1.7%; avanafil 5.1-10.5%), nasal congestion (placebo, 1.1%; avanafil 
1.8-2.9%),  sinus  congestion  (placebo,  0.3%;  avanafil  50  mg,  0.5-1.7%),  flushing  (placebo,  0.0%; 
avanafil 3.2-4.3%), and dyspepsia (placebo, 0.0%; avanafil 0.5-1.4%). 
The most frequent drug-related TEAEs were headaches, with an incidence ranging between 4.1% (for 
placebo)  and  4.6%-9.1%  (for  the  avanafil  groups),  and  an  increasing  trend,  as  the  avanafil  dose 
increases. Other frequent drug-related TEAEs were: flushing (placebo, 0.0%; avanafil 2.8-4.3%) and 
nasal congestion (placebo, 0.9%; avanafil 50 mg, 1.7-2.0%).   
Regarding  targeted  medical  events  (symptomatic  events  related  to  hemodynamic  changes,  special 
sensory effects (vision or hearing), major cardiac events, upper respiratory events and priapism), the 
CHMP assessment report

reporting of events was low, and similar across avanafil treatment groups. The rate of events was not 
higher than the rate of events observed in similar trials with PDE5 inhibitors for ED. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Due  to  the  low  number  of  elderly  subjects  enrolled,  it  is  uncertain  whether  the  efficacy  and  safety 
profiles have been well characterized in this subgroup of subjects, especially the elderly subjects (≥70 
years  old).  The  limited  data  in  elderly  subjects  precludes  from  making  a  recommendation  in  this 
subpopulation at this time and hence section 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC has been amended to reflect this. 
In addition this has been addressed as missing information in the RMP.  
A study evaluating the avanafil effects (therapeutic and supratherapeutic dosing) on QTc prolongation in 
healthy male subjects did not highlight clinical relevant effects on cardiac repolarisation, although the 
upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval for the largest time-matched mean effect of the 
drug on the QTc interval exceeded 10 msec (10.2 msec) thus raising the potential issue that the mean 
effect of avanafil on QT/QTc interval may be greater than the threshold of 5 msec. To rule out any effect 
of Avanafil on QTc, the Applicant has been recommended at post-authorisation to present data from the 
study  evaluating  the  QTc  prolongation  of  avanafil  by  quartiles  of  QTc  duration  for  each  of  the  four 
different algorithms (QTcb, QTcf, QTcI, QTbb). 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Treatment with all three doses of avanafil showed superiority over placebo in the intended indication. 
The lack of a pre-planned definition of responders and clinically significant change from baseline for all 
three co-primary endpoints hampers the interpretation of the magnitude of the effect. Also, the absence 
of a direct comparison with other PDE5 inhibitors poses a limitation to understand the efficacy results in 
the current clinical setting of ED treatment. 
The reported safety profile for avanafil seems to be in line with that known for other PDE5 inhibitors 
already authorised and no new safety signals or concerns have been observed. TEAEs were generally 
mild or moderate in severity and resulted in infrequent discontinuations. Based on available safety data 
a maximum dosing frequency of once a day has been recommended, based on the current available 
evidence. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is becoming more prominent as a result of the aging of EU population and 
prolonged exposure to some therapies negatively impacting erectile function. Successful treatment of 
ED is aimed at improving sexual activity, as well as sexual aspects of quality of life, and may indirectly 
relieve symptoms of depression. The authorization of PDE5 inhibitors in the last decade has significantly 
improved the medical management of ED. Currently marketed PDE-5 inhibitors share similar beneficial 
effects and similar safety profile and they have been authorised on the basis of the results from clinical 
trials with similar designs and endpoints.  
Avanafil’s clinical developmental program is similar to the other PDE5 inhibitors both in terms of efficacy 
endpoints, as well as in terms of the baseline characteristics of the target patient population. Clinical 
efficacy of avanafil in males with ED is supported by three phase III pivotal studies and an open-label 
extension study. In the general population of patients with ED, avanafil, at both the 100 mg and 200 mg 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/321885/2013 
Page 110/112 
 
 
  
 
 
 
doses, resulted in a roughly 30% gain over placebo in the percentage of successful intercourses and 
20% increase in vaginal penetration; the change in the assessment score for erectile function (delta in 
International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire) was greater than 5 points (p<0.001 for all 
comparisons). A comparison between the 100-mg and 200-mg doses showed no statistically significant 
difference. 
Overall, the efficacy of avanafil over placebo has been demonstrated. The AE profile of avanafil is within 
the expected with those known for other PDE5 inhibitors already authorised and no new safety signals 
have been observed with avanafil.  
The benefit/risk balance of avanafil in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males is positive, for 
the intended indication “treatment of ED in adult males”.

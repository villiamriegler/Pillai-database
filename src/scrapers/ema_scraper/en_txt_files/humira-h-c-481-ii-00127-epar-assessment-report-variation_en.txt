2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Adalimumab  is  a  recombinant,  fully  human  immunoglobulin  (IgG1)  monoclonal  antibody  that  binds 
specifically to the soluble and transmembrane forms of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and inhibits the 
binding of TNF-α to its receptors. 
Adalimumab is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, active and progressive psoriatic arthritis, severe ankylosing spondylitis, moderate 
to severe chronic plaque psoriasis, moderate to severe Crohn's disease, and moderate to severe 
ulcerative colitis (UC). 
The  currently  approved  JIA  indication  is  for  the  reduction  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  moderately  to 
severely active polyarticular JIA in children 4 years of age and older in the US, for children 2 years and 
older in the EU, and for children 4 to 17 years of age in Japan. 
The MAH is applying for an extension of the indication for Humira as a treatment of “enthesitis-related 
arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are 
intolerant of, conventional therapy“. 
Targeted disease 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is defined as arthritis of unknown etiology beginning before the age of 
16 years, lasting more than 6 weeks and excluding other known conditions. Enthesitis-related arthritis 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/562197/2014

(ERA)  is  one  of  seven  categories  according  to  the  classification  made  by  the  International  League  of 
Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR). The other categories are systemic JIA,  oligoarthritis (persisted 
and  extended),  polyarthritis  (RF  positive  and  RF  negative),  psoriatic  arthritis  and  undifferentiated 
arthritis. Approximately 3% to 11% of all JIA cases present as ERA, although the estimates are wide 
ranging (1.2% to 27.9%). A study in Canada showed that the mean age at diagnosis of JIA (all types) 
was 6.9 years and the mean age at diagnosis of enthesitis-related JIA was 11.7 years with a difference 
of 4.8 years. 
ERA is defined by the  ILAR as, arthritis and enthesitis, or arthritis or enthesitis with at least 2 of the 
following:   
1) the presence of or a history of sacroiliac joint tenderness and/or inflammatory lumbosacral pain;  
2) the presence of human leukocyte antigen-B27 (HLA-B27);  
3) onset of arthritis in a male over 6 years of age;  
4) acute (symptomatic) anterior uveitis;  
5)  history  of  ankylosing  spondylitis  (AS),  ERA,  sacroiliitis  with  inflammatory  bowel  disease,  Reiter's 
syndrome, or acute anterior uveitis in a first-degree relative.   
In addition, the following conditions must not be present in order for a diagnosis of ERA to be made:   
1) psoriasis (Ps) or a history of Ps in the patient or first-degree relative;  
2) the presence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) RF on at least 2 occasions at least 3 months apart; and  
3) the presence of systemic JIA in the patient.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In the Phase 3 Study M11-328, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of adalimumab were evaluated 
through  Week  52  in  paediatric  subjects  at  least  6  to  <18  years  old  with  active  ERA.  The  influence  of 
concomitant treatment with MTX was also evaluated. 
A comparison with previous polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis data was also made. 
Analytical methods 
Serum  concentrations  of  adalimumab  and  AAA  were  determined  using  a  validated  enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Only serum samples that had adalimumab levels <2.0 µg/mL 
were selected for AAA concentration measurement. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Pharmacokinetic  data  were  analysed  using  population  modelling  in  NONMEM.  Observed  plasma 
concentration data were also described with summary statistics. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
There  were  46  subjects  enrolled  in  Study  M11-328.  A  total  of  31  subjects  were  randomized  to 
adalimumab  and  15  subjects  were  randomized  to  placebo  treatment  group  during  the  Blinded  period 
(Week 0 to Week 12). Three subjects discontinued early from the study before Week 52.  
A summary of demographic characteristics is given below (table 1).

Table 3: 
Serum  adalimumab  concentrations  at  steady-state  appeared  to  be  slightly  higher  in  subjects  who 
received concomitant MTX compared to those who did not. 
Study  DE038  supported  the  use  of  adalimumab  in  JIA  patients  aged  4-17  years.  DE038  was  a 
multicenter,  Phase  3,  randomized,  double-blind,  stratified,  parallel-group  study  in  children  (ages  of  4 
to 17 years) with polyarticular JIA. Comparison of serum trough adalimumab concentration by MTX in 
AAA negative subjects in Study M11-328 and Study DE038 is presented below (Figure 2). 
Figure 2 
Mean serum adalimumab concentrations observed in Study M11-328 appeared to be similar to those in 
Study DE038 in AAA negative subjects.

Influence of anti-adalimumab antibodies (AAA) on serum concentration of adalimumab 
Among 46 subjects who had samples for pharmacokinetic analysis, 5 subjects were AAA+ during the 
52-week of the study. Among the 5 subjects classified as AAA+, two received placebo for the first 12 
weeks and then adalimumab treatment (one with MTX and one without), three received adalimumab 
treatment for 52 weeks (one with MTX and two without). The overall AAA+ rate was 10.9% (5/46) in 
patients treated with adalimumab. In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 
13.6% (3/22), compared to 8.3% (2/24) when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. 
None of the subjects with an AAA+ sample escaped or terminated early from the study. Adalimumab 
trough concentrations were below LLOQ in all 5 AAA+ subject when they became AAA+. Two AAA– 
subjects had at least one adalimumab trough concentration below LLOQ between Week 24 and Week 
52. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Adalimumab is a recombinant, fully human immunoglobulin (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that binds 
specifically to the soluble and transmembrane forms of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and inhibits the 
binding of TNF-α to its receptors. 
Paediatric dosing is supported by a single-use, 40 mg/0.8 mL vial for subcutaneous (SC) 
administration (for paediatric use only), which is already approved in the EU. The recommended dose 
of adalimumab in subjects with ERA is 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) up to a maximum of 40 mg 
every other week (eow). This dose was shown t be safe and efficacious in paediatric subjects in 
previous studies in children with pJIA and it is the dose used in Study M11-328, the first randomized, 
placebo-controlled study of adalimumab in the treatment of paediatric ERA. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The aim of study M11-328 was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ADA given subcutaneously (sc) 
every other week (eow) as compared to placebo in paediatric subjects with ERA, and to examine the 
pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of ADA following sc administration in this population. There 
were 46 subjects enrolled (31 subjects randomized to ADA and 15 subjects were randomized to 
placebo treatment group during the BD (Week 0 to Week 12).   
Following the administration of 24 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other 
week to patients with enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, the mean trough steady-
state (values measured at Week 24) serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.8 ± 6.6 μg/mL for 
adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 11.8 ± 4.3 μg/mL with concomitant methotrexate. 
The development of anti-adalimumab antibodies was associated with trough serum concentration 
falling below the lower limit of quantitation. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Serum concentration of adalimumab was seen to increase over the first 12 weeks of dosing and steady 
state was reached between 12 and 24 weeks consistent with the half-life of adalimumab. At week 24, 
36  and  52  the  serum  concentrations  were  comparable.  The  overall  steady  state  concentration  of 
adalimumab  following  eow  dosing  with  24  mg/m2  of  adalimumab  was  approximately  10  µg/mL.  In 
subjects receiving MTX the serum trough concentration of adalimumab was slightly higher, about 30%. 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  adalimumab  in  paediatric  subjects  with  Enthesitis  Related  Arthritis  (ERA)  is 
comparable to that of paediatric subjects with polyarticular JIA (i.e. the dose (4 mg/m² body surface

area  up  to  a  maximum  single  dose  of  40  mg  adalimumab  administered  every  other  week  via 
subcutaneous injection) is considered appropriate from a PK point of view).

count (AJC) ≥ 30% with a minimum of at least 2 additional active joints compared to Baseline. Failure 
to improve at Week 8 is defined as <30% improvement in AJC compared to Baseline.

Figure 3. Study Design Schematic 
* Subjects fulfilling protocol defined criteria for worsening of ERA could early escape into OL period. 
** Subjects who failed to demonstrate improvement in ERA could early escape into the OL period. 
*** Each subject was planned to receive a maximum of 144 weeks of OL adalimumab. The OL period is to continue 
until  Week  156  or  until  a  subject  has  completed  108  weeks  of  treatment  (from  Baseline)  or  adalimumab  has 
received country and local (if applicable) regulatory approval for ERA, whichever occurs first. 
For subjects who completed the blinded period, the OL period began at the Week 12 visit. For subjects 
who met the criteria for early escape, the OL period began at the Week 4 or Week 8 visit (depending 
on when the criteria were met). During the OL period, each subject received OL adalimumab eow for a 
maximum of 144 weeks. Each subject in the study was to have a minimum of 108 weeks of treatment 
(Baseline to Final Visit) and a maximum of 156 weeks of treatment. If at the time of a subject's Week 
108  visit  or  any  subsequent  study  visit  prior  to  Week  156,  adalimumab  received  country  and  local 
regulatory approval for ERA, that visit was the termination visit for that subject.   
Objectives 
The  objectives  of  this  study  were  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  adalimumab  given 
subcutaneously  (SC)  every  other  week  (eow)  as  compared  with  placebo  in  paediatric  subjects  with 
enthesitis-related  arthritis  (ERA)  and  to  examine  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and  immunogenicity  of 
adalimumab following SC administration in this subject population. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  percent  change  from  Baseline  to  Week  12  in  the  number  of 
active joints with arthritis (swelling not due to deformity or joints with loss of passive motion [LOM] + 
pain and/or tenderness) 
Ranked secondary efficacy variables analyzed at Week 12 were: 
1.  Number of sites of enthesitis 
2.  Tender joint count (TJC) for 72 joints 
3.  Swollen joint count (SJC) for 68 joints 
4.  American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Pediatric (Pedi)30 response 
5.  ACR Pedi50 response 
6.  ACR Pedi70 response 
Other supportive efficacy variables that represent the effect of adalimumab on multiple components of 
active ERA were assessed during the DB and OL periods of the study

Sample size 
Approximately 45 paediatric patients with ERA were planned to be enrolled. With a total sample size of 
45  subjects  (2:1  randomization:  adalimumab  30  subjects,  placebo  15  subjects)  and  an  expected 
percent change of 70% for adalimumab versus 35% for placebo, assuming common standard deviation 
(SD) of 33%, the study provided 90% power to detect the treatment difference using a 2-sided 1-way 
ANOVA with type 1 error level alpha = 5%. 
Randomisation 
An  IVRS/IWRS  was  used  to  determine  the  randomization  of  subjects.  Eligible  subjects  were 
randomized  in  a  2:1  DB  fashion  to  adalimumab  or placebo.  Randomization  was  not  stratified  by  site, 
because of the small expected number of subjects per site, or by any other stratification factor.

Blinding (masking) 
The  investigator,  study  site  personnel,  and  the  subject  remained  blinded  to  each  subject's  treatment 
throughout the blinded period of the study.  The IVRS/IWRS  was to provide access to blinded subject 
treatment information in the case of medical emergency. 
Statistical methods 
The  primary  and  secondary  variables  were  to  be  analysed  for  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population, 
defined  as  all  randomized  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  drug.  A  Per  Protocol  (PP) 
Analysis of the primary and secondary variables was added by Amendment 1 to the Statistical Analysis 
Plan  (dated  20  November  2012)  in  order  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  major  protocol  violations  on  the 
results of the study. The identification of major protocol deviations was done before unblinding. 
In  the  efficacy  analyses,  missing  or  incomplete  data  were  handled  using  last  observation  carried 
forward (LOCF) as the primary method for continuous variables, nonresponder imputation (NRI) as the 
primary method for dichotomous variables, and as observed cases and LOCF as sensitivity analyses. 
The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  percent  change  from  Baseline  to  Week  12  in  the  number  of 
active joints with arthritis (swelling not due to deformity or joints with LOM + pain and/or tenderness). 
The  primary  confirmatory  analysis  was  done  using  an  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  model 
adjusting  for  the  number  of  active  joints  at  Baseline  at  alpha  level  of  0.05.  For  subjects  who  did  not 
have an active joint count at Week 12 or who had escaped early to OL treatment, their last available 
joint count from the DB period was used. 
For the comparison of secondary endpoints between the 2 treatment groups, Fisher's exact test was 
used for discrete variables, and 1-way ANOVA was used for continuous endpoints. Results in the OL 
period were reported stratified by the treatment the subject was randomized to in the DB period and 
overall.

Recruitment 
46 subjects were recruited at 16 study sites in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Spain, 
Sweden, and Switzerland. 
Conduct of the study 
Five  subjects  were  judged  to  have  had  major  protocol  deviations,  i.e.,  protocol  deviations  with  a 
potential impact on the primary variable of the study, and were excluded from the PP analysis set: 
•  One  subject  (adalimumab)  violated  exclusion  criterion  11:    If  entering  the  study  on 
concomitant  MTX  or  SSZ  at  Screening/Baseline,  subject  not  on  stable  dose  of  MTX  (≤  15 
mg/m2 with a maximum of 25 mg/week) or SSZ (≤50 mg/kg/day with a maximum of 3 g/day) 
for 28 days prior to Baseline.  (Subject 17302 was on MTX 20 mg weekly from Day –16 to Day 
28, when the dose was decreased to 17.5 mg.) 
•  One  subject  (adalimumab)  received  prohibited  concomitant  medication  (opioid  analgesic) 
during the DB period. 
• 
Two  subject  (both  adalimumab)  violated  inclusion  criterion  4:    Inadequate  response  or 
intolerance  to  at  least  1  NSAID,  either  SSZ  or  MTX;  subjects  who  have  a  contraindication  to 
SSZ or MTX use may be enrolled. 
•  One subject (placebo) violated inclusion criterion 3:  At least 3 active joints (swelling not due 
to  deformity  or  joints  with  LOM  plus  pain  and/or  tenderness  AND  evidence  of  enthesitis  in  at 
least 1 location [either documented in past or present at Baseline]).  (Subject had only 2 active 
joints at Baseline.)

testing  for  HLA-B27  and  were  found  to  be  HLA-B27  positive.  Subjects  who  had  prior  results  for  HLA-
B27 testing were not required to repeat this genetic test; of the 3 subjects who did not have centrally 
performed HLA-B27 testing, 2 subjects were positive and 1 subject was negative on local testing. Most 
subjects were ANA negative at Baseline with the majority of those who were positive demonstrating a 
low-titer. All ANA positive subjects were anti–ds-DNA negative.

Numbers analysed 
Total number of analysed patients was 46 in the DB phase (15 patients randomized to PLB arm and 31 
to ADA arm) whereas it was 43 in the OL phase (discontinuation of 1 patients in the PLB arm and of 
two patients in the ADA arm). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
In  the  ITT  analysis  set  (last  observation  carried  forward  [LOCF]),  a  statistically  significantly  larger 
decrease  in  mean  percent  change  from  Baseline  to  Week  12  in  the  number  of  active  joints  with 
arthritis (swelling not due to deformity or joints with LOM + pain and/or tenderness) was observed in 
subjects in the adalimumab group (–62.6) compared with the placebo group (–11.6, P = 0.039)  
A sensitivity analysis using the observed case analysis method, which included only those subjects with 
an active joint count at Week 12 (excludes early escapers), produced larger decreases in mean percent 
change  from  Baseline  compared  to  the  ITT  (LOCF)  analysis  in  both  treatment  groups  (–32.1  with 
placebo versus –83.3 with adalimumab). These changes were also statistically significantly different. 
Numerically  superior,  but  not  statistically  significant  results  were  demonstrated  for  the  adalimumab 
group  compared  to  the  placebo  group  using  the  PP  analysis  set  (LOCF),  which  excluded  significant 
protocol  violators.  In  this  analysis  the  placebo  group  response  was  higher  compared  to  the  primary 
analysis (ITT [LOCF]) (mean percent change from Baseline –30.2 versus –11.6, respectively), but the 
response  in  the  adalimumab  group  was  similar  in  both  analyses  (and  –66.0  versus  –62.6, 
respectively).

While  results  for  number  of  sites  of  enthesitis,  TJC,  SJC,  ACR  Pedi50  response,  and  ACR Pedi70 
response  were  numerically  superior  in  favor  of  adalimumab,  none  of  the  ranked  secondary  efficacy 
variables  reached  statistical  significance  at  Week  12.    Given  the  small  sample  size  in  this  study,  the 
positive trends observed support the efficacy of adalimumab in the ERA patient population.

Other efficacy variables 
Other supportive efficacy variables that represent the effect of adalimumab on multiple components of 
active  ERA  were  assessed  during  the  12-week  DB  period,  as  well  as  additional  OL  data  available 
through Week 52. While few of these variables achieved statistical significance in favor of adalimumab 
at Week 12, the majority demonstrated trends in favor of adalimumab with results being sustained or 
improving further during the OL period.

Parent's Assessment of Subject's Eye Disease 
Parent's  assessment  of  subject's  eye  disease  was  only  done  for  those  subjects  who  reported  eye 
disease  in  connection  with  their  ERA  at  a  given  visit.  Three  subjects  (all  randomized  to  placebo) 
reported  a  past  history  of  uveitis  at  Baseline  and  during  the  study,  2  of  these  subjects  reported  eye 
disease in connection with their ERA; one at Week 2 and both from Week 8 to Week 52. As very few 
subjects  experienced  uveitis  through  Week  52,  no  conclusions  can  be  made  from  this  data  regarding 
the  effect  of  adalimumab  on  improvement  in  uveitis  symptoms.  However,  at  Week  52  clinically 
significant  improvement in  the  parent's  assessment of  subject's  eye  disease in  terms  of the  subject's 
ability to function normally as measured on a VAS was observed for these 2 subjects. 
Parent's Assessment of Subject's School Attendance 
No  statistically  significant  differences  were  observed  between  groups  at  any  timepoint  during  the  DB 
period for any analysis of parent's assessment of subject's school attendance. 
When looking at days lost since Baseline to Week 12, both groups missed the same mean number of 
days  from  school  (3.4  days).  When  missing  values  were  included  as  0,  results  were  similar.  When 
missing  values  were  not  included,  subjects  in  the  adalimumab  group  missed  fewer  days  than  did 
subjects in the placebo group (3.3 versus 5.4, respectively). An average of 5 days missed from school 
per  year  is  reported  in  healthy  children  and  a  United  Kingdom  study  reported  that  children  with  JIA 
miss  approximately  15  days  a  year  from  school,  which  was  similar  to  other  chronic  diseases  such  as 
asthma. During the OL period, subjects with any exposure to adalimumab lost an average of 7.8 days 
from school (days lost since Baseline visit) by Week 52 which is approximately half of that reported for 
children with JIA overall. Results were similar without missing values and with missing values set to 0. 
Data were similar using as observed analysis (ITT). 
Ancillary analyses 
Comparison of results in subpopulations 
Subgroup analysis of the primary efficacy variable was done by age, sex, race, HLA-B27 status, hs-CRP 
status,  concomitant  DMARD  or  NSAID  use  at  Baseline,  and  BMI.  Statistically  significant  differences 
were observed within subgroups as follows: 
•  Male subjects in the adalimumab group had a greater percent decrease in the number of active 
joints with arthritis than males in the placebo group. 
•  White  subjects  in  the  adalimumab  group  had  a  greater  percent  decrease  in  the  number  of 
active joints with arthritis than white subjects in the placebo group. 
•  HLA-B27  positive  subjects  in  the  adalimumab  group  had  a  greater  percent  decrease  in  the 
number of active joints with arthritis than HLA-B27 positive subjects in the placebo group.  The 
3 subjects who did not have centrally performed HLA-B27 were excluded from this analysis. 
•  Subjects  with  concomitant  NSAID  use  at  Baseline  in  the  adalimumab  group  had  a  greater 
percent  decrease  in  the  number  of  active  joints  with  arthritis  than  subjects  with  concomitant 
NSAID use at Baseline in the placebo group. 
•  Subjects in the adalimumab group who had a healthy weight at Baseline had a greater percent 
decrease than subjects with a healthy weight at Baseline in the placebo group. 
Overall,  sample  sizes  were  too  small  to  provide  definitive  conclusions  regarding  differences  in  benefit 
between  subgroup  categories.  However,  the  following  trends  were  noted  when  comparing  mean 
percent  change  from  Baseline  to  Week  12  in  the  number  of  active  joints  with  arthritis  for  subgroups 
within the adalimumab group:

•  Subjects who were 6 to < 9 years old (N = 2) had a higher response (mean percent change –
84.9) than older subgroups (–58.9 to –63.4, N = 5 – 12 per subgroup). 
•  A  higher  response  was  observed  with  adalimumab  among  males  (N  =  22,  mean  percent 
change –70.4) than females (N = 9, mean percent change –43.7). 
•  Healthy  weight  (N  =  22)  and  overweight  (N  =  2)  subjects  had  a  higher  response  (mean 
percent change –68.0 and –71.9, respectively) than underweight subjects (N  = 2)  and obese 
subjects (N = 5) (mean percent change –31.9 and –47.3, respectively).

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  MAH  provided  1  clinical  study  (M11-328)  to  support  this  application  for  paediatric  ERA.  It  is  a 
double-blind placebo controlled study, including patients 6-17 years old with ERA and at least 3 active 
joints, and with an inadequate response to NSAID and MTX/SSZ. After randomisation 2:1 the subjects 
were  followed  for  12  weeks,  thereafter  all  subjects  received  OL  adalimumab.  There  was  an  early 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

escape  option  at  week  4  if  worsening  of  disease,  and  at  week  8  if  failure  to  improve.  There  were  in 
total 3 early escapes in the placebo group and 4 early escapes in the adalimumab group. 
The  study  design  was  acceptable  to  the  CHMP.  It  is  noted  that  the  chosen  primary  endpoint  is  not 
consistent  with  the  recommendation  in  the  current  JIA  guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal 
products for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, namely JRA 30 (very similar to PEDI30). ACR 
PEDI 30 response was a secondary endpoint in this study. During the procedure, the MAH clarified that 
the percent change in the number of active joints with arthritis was chosen as the primary measure to 
assess  efficacy  in  Study  M11-328  due  to  the  fairly  limited  paediatric  ERA  population,  and  allowed  for 
appropriate  powering  of  the  study  for  the  primary  endpoint.  More  than  twice  the  sample  size  would 
have  been  required  if  the  study  was  powered  for  ACR  Pedi30  as  the  primary  endpoint.  The  CHMP 
agreed that the choice of this primary endpoint is understandable due to the fairly limited pediatric ERA 
population.  
Five  subjects  (4 in  the  adalimumab  group) turned  out  to  be  protocol  violations.  Two  of  these  did  not 
fulfill  inclusion  criterion  4,  inadequate  response  to  NSAID  and  MTX/SSZ.  The  MAH  clarified  that  all 
included  subjects  had  prior  NSAID  use,  and  that  2  of  the  4  subjects  without  prior  DMARD  use  had 
contraindications for this.  This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
The  adalimumab  treated  group  is  older,  24  subjects  out  of  31  were  12-18  years,  as  compared  to  7 
subjects out of 15 in the  placebo group. The MAH sufficiently addressed the raised concern of scarce 
representation  of  patients  aged  6  to  <9  years  reporting  a  literature  review  by  conducting  a 
retrospective  analysis  using  UK  CPRD.  Although  data  on  ERA  patients  were  extracted  by  JIA  studied 
population and numbers were limited using specific terms, overall results support a lower distribution 
of incidence of ERA patients in age categories 6 to 11 years.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary endpoint was the percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in the number of active joints 
with arthritis (swelling not due to deformity or joints with loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), 
which was achieved with mean percent decrease of -62.6% (median percent change -88.9%) in 
patients in the Humira group compared to -11.6% (median percent change -50.0%) in patients in the 
placebo group. Improvement in number of active joints with arthritis was maintained during the OL 
period through Week 52 of the study. Although not statistically significant, the majority of patients 
demonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of sites of enthesitis, 
tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), Paediatric ACR 50 response, and Paediatric ACR 70 
response. 
In  the  primary  ITT  analysis,  a  clinically  relevant  statistically  significant  difference  was  demonstrated, 
but when 1 subject was excluded from the placebo group, the results for this group improved from -11 
to -30.2%, and the difference between the treated and untreated group diminished from 51 to 36%, 
which  is  not  statistically  significant.  However,  due  to  the  limited  number  of  patients  the  sensitivity 
analyses  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  Exclusion  of  very  few  or  single  patients  might  have  a 
conspicuous  impact  on  magnitude  of  effect  and  statistical  significance,  and  the  interpretation  should 
base  on  the  overall  pattern  rather  than  individual  analyses.  With  this  in  mind  there  is  no  reason  to 
question  the  consistency  between  primary  and  sensitivity  results  because  of  the  differences  in 
magnitude of effect as well as in p-values. 
Although the primary end point was met, there was no difference in response at all between groups in 
the  dichotomous  secondary  endpoint  ACR  PEDI  30%,  which  is  the  recommended  primary  endpoint in 
the draft guideline for clinical investigations of JIA. This seems to be caused by an unexpectedly good 
response in the placebo group, 66.7% versus 67.7% in the adalimumab group. This may be considered 
problematic,  but  on  the  other  hand,  the  PEDI70  result  appeared  consistent  with  primary  endpoint

results,  51%  and  26.7%  responders  in  the  adalimumab  and  placebo  groups,  respectively.  The  MAH 
clarified that the greatest difference towards placebo was seen in number of joints with loss of motion, 
function  (CHAQ),  and  number  of  arthritis.  Although  not  reaching  statistical  significance,  a  substantial 
number  of  subjects  achieved  at  least  30%  improvement  in  these  parameters.  More  subjective 
parameters,  such  as  parent´s  and  physician´s  global  assessments,  showed  less  degree  of 
improvement.  The  CHMP  also  acknowledged  that  the  higher  difference  between  the  treated  and 
placebo group observed for ACR Pedi50 and 70, which is due to lower response in the placebo groups, 
points towards a true treatment effect with adalimumab compared to placebo.  
For  the  other  supportive  efficacy  variables,  all  supportive  efficacy  variables  showed  numerical 
improvement in the adalimumab group, however, none reached statistical significance. 
During the procedure, the MAH clarified that the efficacy of adalimumab for the clinical features, such 
as  arthritis  and  enthesitis,  observed  in  ERA  has  been  demonstrated  in  studies  of  polyarticular  JIA  in 
children  and  in  axial  spondyloarthritis  (SpA)  (ankylosing  spondylitis  [AS]  and  non-radiographic  axial 
SpA [nr-axSpA]), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and non-PsA peripheral SpA in adults. Studies in all of these 
indications have demonstrated either statistically significant improvements, or trends for improvement, 
in favor of adalimumab therapy for clinical signs and symptoms of inflammatory arthritis (i.e., swollen 
and  tender  joints),  enthesitis,  physician  assessment  of  disease  activity,  health-related  quality  of  life 
(HRQoL), and laboratory evidence of inflammation. 
PK data in the paediatric ERA population were comparable to that observed in paediatric subjects with 
polyarticular JIA and in adults with AS. Mean serum adalimumab trough concentrations at steady state 
for  paediatric  subjects  (age  ≥6  to  <18  years)  with  ERA  in  Study  M11-328  were  7.5  –  11.8  μg/mL 
between Weeks 12 to 24 following doses of 24 mg/m2 (up to 40 mg) eow. Subjects with polyarticular 
JIA  had  similar  mean  steady-state  serum  adalimumab  trough  concentrations  of  4.5  –  10.5  μg/mL 
[Study DE038; age ≥ 4 to < 18 years old; following doses of 24 mg/m2 (up to 40 mg) eow] and 6.1 – 
8.5  μg/mL  [Study  M10-444;  age  ≥  2  to  <  4  years  old;  following  doses  of  24  mg/m2  (up  to  20  mg) 
eow]. Additionally, adult subjects with AS in Study M03-607 had mean trough concentrations of 6.4 – 
8.6 μg/mL between Weeks 12 and 24 following administration of adalimumab 40 mg eow. 
Mean serum adalimumab trough concentrations were slightly higher in Study M11-328 for subjects on 
adalimumab  in  combination  with  MTX  (9.7  –  11.8  μg/mL,  n  =  16)  compared  to  adalimumab  without 
MTX  (7.5  –  9.4  μg/mL,  n  =  15).  This  was  consistent  with  previous  adalimumab  studies,  including 
polyarticular  JIA  and  adult  AS.  Additionally,  the  rate  of  anti-adalimumab  antibody  positive  (AAA+) 
subjects was similar across paediatric ERA, polyarticular JIA, and adult AS indications. 
In  order  to  demonstrate  a  consistent  relationship  between  serum  adalimumab  trough  concentrations 
and clinical response in paediatric subjects with JIA, an exposure-response analysis was conducted by 
the MAH to compare the percent change from Baseline in the number of active joints with arthritis, to 
that  in  Study  DE038  (paediatric  subjects  with  polyarticular  JIA).  For  each  study,  all  subjects  with 
available  data  for  adalimumab  trough  concentrations  and  efficacy  were  included  in  the  analysis.  The 
time point selected for comparison was the end of the placebo-controlled, DB period in Study M11-328 
(Week  12),  and  the  end  of  the  open-label  lead-in  (OL-LI)  phase  in  Study  DE038  (Week  16,  with  PK 
sampling  at  either  Week  12  or  Week  16).  The  results  showed  that  improvement  in  percent  change 
from  Baseline  in  the  number  of  active  joints  with  arthritis  was  similar  in  paediatric  ERA  and 
polyarticular JIA subjects categorized into comparable trough concentration categories. 
The  CHMP  was  also  of  the  opinion  that  the  baseline  disease  activity  characteristics  highlight  that  the 
enrolled subjects had moderately active disease and that the sought indication should include the word 
"active".  The  MAH  therefore  agreed  to  update  the  indication  as  follows:  “Humira  is  indicated  for  the 
treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and older, who have had an 
inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy (see section 5.1)”.

2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  applicant  has  demonstrated  a  clinically  relevant  effect  on  the  percent  change  of  active  joints  in 
patients  with  ERA.  In  the  primary  ITT  analysis,  a  statistically  significant  effect  difference  between 
treated  and  untreated  patients  was  demonstrated  (-62.6  vs  11.6  %,  p=0.039).  PK  data  in  children 
with ERA was similar to children with polyarticular juvenile arthritis (approved indication). 
The paediatric disease enthesitis related arthritis (ERA) has many similarities to ankylosing spondylitis 
(AS), afflicting the adult population. In fact, one of the classification criteria is history of this disease in 
adult first degree relatives. Humira has demonstrated effect in AS and has been used in this indication 
since  2006.  An  important  feature  of  both  AS  and  ERA  is  enthesitis,  and  it  is  noted  that  adalimumab 
showed  effect  on  enthesitis  and  MASES  enthesitis  index  toward  12  weeks  in  studies  on  these 
indications. 
Extrapolation  from  approved  indications  was  discussed  and  the  MAH  pointed  to  the  similar  clinical 
features  and  common  manifestations  of  other  indications  such  as  AS,  non-radiographic  axial 
Spondyloarthritis and Psoriatic arthritis, of  which AS is the most important, where adalimumab has a 
well-documented effect.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The mechanism of action of TNF antagonists, including adalimumab, is inhibition of an immunologically 
active cytokine, episodes of infections, malignancies, central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating 
disease, immunologic reactions and lupus-like illness were specifically evaluated as AEs of special 
interest. Congestive heart failure (CHF) has also been an event specifically examined in studies with 
TNF antagonists and was also evaluated as an AE of special interest. 
Patient exposure 
In  the  study  M11-328  interim  CSR  (R&D/12/735)  a  total  of  46  paediatric  subjects  with  ERA  were 
randomized  and  all  subjects  received  ≥1  dose  of  study  drug.  Of  the  46  patients  treated  with  study 
drug, 7 subjects early escaped during the DB period and continued in the OL period (3 subjects from 
the  placebo  treatment  arm  and  4  subjects  from  the  adalimumab  treatment  arm).  In  total  3  subjects 
early escaped at week 4, 4 subjects early escaped at week 8, and 39 subjects completed the DB period 
through  week12.  43  subjects  completed  week  52  of  the  OL  period,  and  3  subjects  discontinued  from 
the study prior to week 52, all the OL period.  
Adverse events 
 Study period Double blind period 
The overview of TEAEs during the DB period and at any time after the first injection of adalimumab is 
presented in Table 33. 
No  deaths  or  fatal  AEs  occurred  through  Week  52  of  the  study.  During  the  DB  period,  most  subjects 
(63.0%)  reported  ≥  1  TEAE;  of  these,  a  greater  percentage  of  subjects  who  received  adalimumab 
reported  at  least  1  AE  (67.7%)  compared  with  subjects  who  received  placebo  (53.3%).  The 
proportions  of  subjects  who  reported  at  least  1  AE  that  was  considered  related  to  study  drug  by  the 
Investigator were similar. 
During the DB period, 1 subject in the adalimumab treatment group reported 2 SAEs (abdominal pain 
upper and headache) which were considered possibly related to study drug by the Investigator. Among

subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  adalimumab  at  any  time  during  the  study,  the  majority 
(93.5%) experienced at least 1 AE and 47.8% reported an AE that was considered by the Investigator 
to be at least possibly related to study drug from the first dose of adalimumab onwards. 
During  the  DB  period,  a  greater  percentage  of  subjects  who  received  adalimumab  (21/31,  67.7%) 
reported  at  least  1  AE  compared  with  subjects  who  received  placebo  (8/15,  53.3%).  The  most 
frequently reported AEs (reported by ≥2 subjects in any treatment group) included upper respiratory 
tract  infection,  headache,  gastroenteritis,  injection  site  pain,  nausea,  ALT  increased,  abdominal  pain 
upper, and syncope.  
Nine subjects in the adalimumab treatment group reported possibly or probably related AEs compared 
to 4 subjects in the placebo group. 
All AEs were considered mild or moderate in severity by the Investigator and most subjects (n = 16) 
reported  AEs  that  were  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be  not  related  or  probably  not  related  to 
study drug.

Entire study including open label period 
Among subjects who received at least 1 dose of adalimumab at any time during the study including the 
open label period, the majority experienced at least 1 AE (43/46, 93.5%). 
Of  the  most  frequently  reported  AEs  (reported  by  ≥  3  subjects),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection, 
headache, nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis, and pharyngitis were reported in > 10% of subjects.  
Three subjects who had received only adalimumab throughout the study reported at least 1 severe AE 
(blood pressure increased and weight increased [in the same subject] and juvenile arthritis [worsening 
of  ERA,  2  subjects]).  Twenty-two  subjects  reported  AEs  that  were  considered  possibly  or  probably 
related to study drug by the Investigator. 
Three  subjects  prematurely  discontinued  due  to  AEs,  all  during  the  OL  period  (Ps;  juvenile  arthritis 
[worsening of ERA] and pain; and injection site pain and injection site pruritus).  
Other Adverse events reported in the study: 
- Infections: During the DB period, a greater proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group reported 
at  least  1  treatment-emergent  infection  (9/31,  29.0%)  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (3/15, 
20.0%).  
Infections  reported  in  2  or  more  subjects  included  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  gastroenteritis, 
cystitis,  and  paronychia.  All  other  infections  during  the  DB  period  were  reported  by  no  more  than  1 
subject  each.  Among  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  adalimumab  at  any  time  during  the 
study,  37  out  of  46  subjects  (80.4%)  reported  at  least  1  treatment-emergent  infection.  The  most 
frequently  reported  infections  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  nasopharyngitis,  gastroenteritis, 
and pharyngitis with all other infections being reported by no more than 3 subjects each. All infections 
were considered by the Investigator to be mild or moderate in severity and all were nonserious events 
with the exception of 1 subject (appendicitis requiring hospitalization, OL period). Among subjects who 
received at least1 dose of adalimumab at any time during the study, 23 infections were considered by 
the Investigator to be possibly (20 events) or probably related (3 events) to study drug. One subject 
reported  a  parasitic  infection  (acarodermatitis,  placebo  group,  DB  period)  considered  by  the 
Investigator to be not related to study drug.

- Vasculitis: One subject experienced a non-serious event of treatment-emergent cutaneous vasculitis 
(OL period), which was considered possibly related to study drug by the Investigator. 
- Worsening or new onset psoriasis (Ps): One subject experienced a non-serious event of new onset Ps 
(OL period), which was considered possibly related to study drug by the Investigator. 
- Liver event: One subject experienced a non-serious liver event (hepatocoellular injury, adalimumab 
group, DB period). The event was considered not related to study drug by the Investigator. 
-  Injection  site  reaction:  During  the  DB  period,  3  subjects  in  the  adalimumab  group  reported  an 
injection  site  reaction  compared  to  1  subject  in  the  placebo  group.  Among  subjects  who  received  at 
least  1  dose  of  adalimumab,  5  subjects  (10.9%)  reported  an  injection  site  reaction.  All  injection  site 
reactions  were  considered  by  the  Investigator  as  mild  in  severity  and  all  were  probably  or  possibly 
related to study drug with the exception of 1 event. 
While 3 subjects had CTCAE toxicity grade ≥3 hematology or clinical chemistry value during the study, 
all resolved by Week 52 and were considered not clinically meaningful. Mean changes from Baseline to 
final vital signs values were overall small and not clinically significant and shifts from normal to high or 
low final vital signs values were infrequent and not clinically meaningful.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths were reported during the study 
Five subjects reported a total of 8 SAEs. 
Two subjects had events that were considered by the Investigator to be possibly related to study drug 
(abdominal pain upper and headache in 1 subject in the DB period and appendicitis in 1 subject in the 
OL  period).  The  subject  who  experienced  abdominal  pain  upper  and  headache  in  the  DB  period  also 
experienced juvenile arthritis (worsening of ERA) and pain (OL period), both of which were considered 
not related by the Investigator.  
The remaining 3 subjects had events that were considered probably not or not related to study drug by 
the  Investigator  (musculoskeletal  chest  pain  and  concussion  [OL  period]  and  juvenile  arthritis 
[worsening of ERA; posttreatment from OL period]).  
One  SAE  was  considered  severe  by  the  Investigator  (juvenile  arthritis  [worsening  of  ERA];  post 
treatment from OL period); all other SAEs were considered mild or moderate in severity.  
One  subject,  a  13-year-old  white  male  who  was  randomized  to  the  adalimumab  group,  was 
hospitalized due to abdominal pain upper and headache on Day 67 (DB period), both intermittent but 
lasting  20  days.  Both  events  were  considered  mild  and  possibly  related  to  study  drug  by  the 
Investigator. The Investigator reported "psychosomatic, gastroenteritis" as an alternative cause of the 
events.  On Day 220 (Day 138 of the OL period), the subject reported juvenile arthritis (worsening of 
ERA) and pain, requiring hospitalization. Both events were considered moderate in intensity and not 
related to study drug by the Investigator. Both events were ongoing as of Day 317. The  Investigator 
reported  "natural  progression  of  disease"  as  an  alternative  cause  of  the  events.  The  subject 
prematurely  discontinued  from  the  study  as  a  result  of  the  juvenile  arthritis  (worsening  of  ERA)  and 
pain. 
One  subject,  a  13-year-old  white  male  who  was  randomized  to  the  adalimumab  group,  experienced 
appendicitis  on  Day  242  (Day  158  of  the  OL  period).  He  was  hospitalized  and  underwent  an 
appendectomy.  The  event  lasted  10  days,  and  was  considered  by  the  Investigator  as  moderate  in 
severity and to be possibly related to study drug. The Investigator reported "possibly related infection, 
histology  floride  ulcerous-phlegmonous  appendicitis  and  periappendicitis,  purulent  serositis"  as  an 
alternative cause of the event. 
One  subject,  a  14-year-old  white  female  randomized  to  the  placebo  group  who  early  escaped  to  OL 
adalimumab at Week 8, was hospitalized due to musculoskeletal chest pain on Day 77 (Day 23 of the

OL period). The event lasted 15 days, was considered by the Investigator as moderate in severity and 
probably  not  related  to  study  drug.  The  Investigator  reported  "probable  enthesitis"  as  an  alternative 
cause of the event 
One subject, a 13-year-old white female randomized to the placebo group, sustained a concussion on 
Day 309 (Day 250 of the OL period) and was hospitalized. The event lasted 4 days, was considered by 
the  Investigator  as  moderate  in  severity  and  not  related  to  study  drug.  The  Investigator  reported 
"accident" as an alternative cause of the event. 
One  subject,  a  15-year-old  white  female  randomized  to  the  adalimumab  group,  was  hospitalized  for 
juvenile arthritis (worsening of ERA) on Day 299 (32 days post-treatment). The event was intermittent 
over  8  days  and  was  considered  by  the  Investigator  as  severe  and  not  related  to  study  drug.  The 
Investigator reported "worsening of ERA" as an alternative cause of the event.

For subjects who received at least 1 dose of adalimumab at any time during the study, the majority of 
haematology and chemistry parameters demonstrated infrequent shifts from Baseline to the Week 52 
visit.  
Shifts in haematocrit (normal to high in 9 subjects) and platelets (high to normal in 12 subjects) most 
likely represent normalization of systemic inflammation in study subjects.  
Shifts  from  abnormal  normal  in  8  subjects)  and  BUN  (high  to  normal  in  9  subjects)  and  shifts  in 
albumin  from  normal  to  high  in  9  subjects  and  from  high  to  normal  in  7  subjects  were  not  clinically 
meaningful. 
Review  of  the  specific  laboratory  values  for  these  parameters  revealed  all  values  were  Common 
Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade <3 throughout the study without clinically significant abnormalities. 
Three  subjects  had  at  least  1  clinically  significant  (CTC  for  AEs  [CTCAE]  toxicity  grade  ≥3) 
haematology  or  clinical  chemistry  value  (white  blood  cell  count  [WBC],  lymphocyte,  ALT  and 
triglyceride  values  in  adalimumab  subjects,  and  neutrophil  counts  in  a  placebo  subject).  All  of  these 
abnormalities returned to grade <3 while continuing treatment with study drug. 
Ten subjects had at least 1 potentially clinically significant liver function test (LFT) value. One of these 
subjects (in the adalimumab group) experienced an elevation in ALT >5 × ULN (upper limit of normal), 
which  returned  to  <3  ×  ULN  at  the  next  visit.  All  other  subjects  had  mildly  elevated  LFT  values 
(generally maximum values ≤ 3 × ULN) that were mostly transient.  
Mean changes from Baseline to final vital sign values were overall small and not statistically significant 
between treatment groups. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Three  subjects  prematurely  discontinued  due  to  AEs,  all  during  the  OL  period  (Ps;  juvenile  arthritis 
[worsening of ERA] and pain; and injection site pain and injection site pruritus). The events reported 
were consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab. 
Post marketing experience 
Humira  is  approved  since  2003  and  is  currently  approved  in  the  EU  for  active  polyarticular  juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis. The safety profile in children is well characterised and the main adverse events in 
children are infections.  
A total of 42,630 patients have been treated with adalimumab in AbbVie sponsored clinical studies and 
registries with an estimated subject exposure of 43,225.9 patient years (PYs AE rates across approved 
indications for events of special interest to those that were reported in Study M11-328 are compared in

Table 33.   
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
All subjects received at least 143 days of ADA treatment, with a maximum exposure to ADA of 385 
days. 
The most common AEs are those frequently observed with ADA treatment, the majority (86.9%) of 
reported AEs were mild-moderate in severity and only a minority was severe (6.5%).  
The AEs by SOC most commonly reported according to severity grade and clinical interest are: 
gastrointestinal disorders (mild 28.3%, moderate 2.2%); general disorders and administration site 
conditions (mild 28.3, moderate 4.3%); infections and infestations (mild 58.7, moderate 21.7%); 
nervous system disorders (mild 23.9; moderate 4.3%); investigations (mild 13.0, severe 2.2). 
In particular, infections and infestations were reported in 80.4% of patients with the most common 
being gastroenteritis, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection. All infections 
during DB as well as OL phases were moderate or mild in severity, with the exception of 1 serious 
event of appendicitis requiring hospitalization during the OL phase.  
There are no deaths reported during the study. 2/5 subjects reported in all 3 SAEs, possibly related to 
study  drug.  In  one  case  two  SAE  (abdominal  pain  upper  and  headache)  as  possibly  related  to  study 
drug, and in another case report appendicitis was regarded as possibly related to study drug. 
Changes in laboratory findings were not clinically significant and overall reflect ADA safety profile.  
Few patients prematurely discontinued study drugs, the majority complete the treatment period.

A total of 42,630 patients have been treated with adalimumab in the MAH’s sponsored clinical studies 
and registries with an estimated subject exposure of 43,225.9 patient years (PYs). Safety data for 
Study M11-328 were comparable to already approved indications and no new safety signals were 
identified in the paediatric ERA population with the rate of overall adverse events (AEs), serious 
adverse events (SAEs), and severe AEs similar to rates observed in clinical trials for other indications. 
The rate of overall infections was higher in the paediatric ERA population compared to other indications 
with the most frequently reported infections those commonly observed in the general population 
including upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis, and pharyngitis. In 
addition, the rate of serious infections is within the range observed in approved indications. There were 
no deaths or AEs of malignancy, opportunistic infection, tuberculosis (TB), lupus-like syndrome, 
hematological disorders (including pancytopenia), or demyelinating disease reported through Week 52.  
In controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who 
were 4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN 
occurred in 6.1% of Humira-treated patients and 1.3% of control-treated patients. Most ALT elevations 
occurred with concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the Phase 3 
trial of Humira in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 2 to <4 years. 
Long -term data for the adalimumab-treated ERA population will be available through the OL extension 
of Study M11-328 (as described in the RMP).  
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Adalimumab was generally well tolerated during the study M11-328. The most reported common AEs 
were upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis, and pharyngitis. 
The safety profile observed was consistent with previous clinical trials for adalimumab. 
During the procedure, the MAH has provided data supporting safety of adalimumab in other related 
indications, such as Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), non-radiographic axial Spondyloarthritis and Psoriatic 
arthritis. This approach is considered acceptable, since it is acknowledged that there are significant 
clinical similarities between these diseases and ERA. In fact, one of the classification criteria is history 
of AS in adult first degree relatives. 
Long -term data for the adalimumab-treated ERA population will be available through the OL extension 
of Study M11-328 (as described in the RMP).  
2.5.4.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
2.6.1.  PRAC advice 
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan. 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 10.3, the PRAC considers by 
consensus that the risk management system for adalimumab (Humira) in the treatment of enthesitis-
related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who 
are intolerant of, conventional therapy is acceptable.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed post-
authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product. 
The PRAC also considered that routine PhV is sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk 
minimisation measures.

updated (addition, deletion). The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Section 4.1 Therapeutic indications 
[…] 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Humira in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, in children and adolescentspatients from the age of 2 years who have had an 
inadequate response to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Humira can 
be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with 
methotrexate is inappropriate. (for the efficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Humira has not been 
studied in children patients aged less than 2 years. 
Enthesitis-related arthritis 
Humira is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 
years of age and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant 
of, conventional therapy (see section 5.1). 
Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration 
Enthesitis-related arthritis 
The recommended dose of Humira for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis 6 years of 
age and older is 24 mg/m² body surface area up to a maximum single dose of 40 mg 
adalimumab administered every other week via subcutaneous injection. The volume for 
injection is selected based on the patients' height and weight (Table 1). 
Humira has not been studied in patients with enthesitis-related arthritis aged less than 6 
years. 
Section 4.8 Undesirable effects 
Humira was studied in 8,1528,198 patients in pivotal controlled and open label trials for up to 60 
months or more. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing 
disease, polyarticular  juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and 
enthesitis-related arthritis) as well as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and, axial 
spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative

colitis and psoriasis patients. The data in Table 2 is based on tThe pivotal controlled studies 
involveding 5,312 343 patients receiving Humira and 3,1333,148 patients receiving placebo or active 
comparator during the controlled period and spontaneous reporting. 
The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-
blind, controlled portion of pivotal studies was 6.1% for patients taking Humira and 5.85.7% for 
control 
treated patients. 
Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders 
No malignancies were observed in 203 249 paediatric patients  aged 2 to 17 years with an exposure of 
605.3655.6 patient years during Humira trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
(polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis) patients. In 
addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 paediatric patients with an exposure of 258.9 patient 
years during 
a Humira trial in paediatric patients with Crohn’s disease. 
Hepato-biliary events 
In controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis with 
a control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 3.7% 
of Humira-treated patients and 1.6% of control-treated patients. 
In controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with  plaque Psoriasis with a control period duration 
ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of Humira-treated patients 
and 1.8% of control-treated patients. 
In the JIA trial the few transaminase elevations were small and similar in the placebo and 
adalimumab exposed patients, and mostly occurred in combination with methotrexate. 
In controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis who were 4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, 
ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 6.1% of Humira-treated patients and 1.3% of 
control-treated patients. Most ALT elevations occurred with concomitant methotrexate 
use. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of Humira in patients with 
polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 2 to <4 years.

body surface area (BSA) of 
Enthesitis-related arthritis 
The safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in a multicenter, randomised, double-blind 
study in 46 paediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) with moderate enthesitis-related 
arthritis. Patients were randomised to receive either 24 mg/m
Humira up to a maximum of 40 mg, or placebo every other week for 12 weeks. The double-
blind period is followed by an open-label (OL) period during which patients received 24 
mg/m
BSA of Humira up to a maximum of 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up 
to an additional 192 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percent change from Baseline to 
Week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis (swelling not due to deformity or 
joints with loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was achieved with mean 
percent decrease of -62.6% (median percent change -88.9%) in patients in the Humira 
group compared to -11.6% (median percent change -50.0%) in patients in the placebo 
group. Improvement in number of active joints with arthritis was maintained during the OL 
period through Week 52 of the study. Although not statistically significant, the majority of 
patients demonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of sites 
of enthesitis, tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), Pediatric ACR 50 response, 
and Pediatric ACR 70 response. 
Immunogenicity 
Formation of anti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy 
of adalimumab. There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies 
and the occurrence of adverse events. 
Patients in rheumatoid arthritis studiesRA Studies I, II and III were tested at multiple time points 
for anti-adalimumab antibodies during the 6 to 12 month period. In the pivotal trials, anti-

adalimumab antibodies were identified in 5.5% (58/1053) of (5.5%) patients treated with 
adalimumab, compared to 0.5% (2/370)  (0.5%)  on placebo.  In patients not given concomitant 
methotrexate, the incidence was 12.4%, compared to 0.6% when adalimumab was used as add-on 
to methotrexate. 
In patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 4 to 17 years, anti-
, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 15.8% (27/171) of patients subjects (15.8%)  treated 
with adalimumab. In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 25.6% 
(22/86)  (25.6%), compared to 5.9% (5/85)  (5.9%)  when adalimumab was used as add-on to 
methotrexate. 
In patients with enthesitis-related arthritis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 10.9% 
(5/46) of patients treated with adalimumab. In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, 
the incidence was 13.6% (3/22), compared to 8.3% (2/24) when adalimumab was used as add-
on to 
methotrexate.

The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Editorial changes have also been made to section 4.1, 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC. 
No user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet (PL) has been performed. As the 
changes proposed in this variation are deemed not to be substantial, further readability testing is not 
considered to be required. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The  applicant  has  demonstrated  a  clinically  relevant  effect  on  the  percent  change  of  active  joints  in 
patients  with  ERA.  In  the  primary  ITT  analysis,  a  statistically  significant  effect  difference  between 
treated  and  untreated  patients  was  demonstrated  (-62.6  vs  11.6  %,  p=0.039).  PK  data  in  children 
with ERA was similar to children with polyarticular juvenile arthritis (approved indication). 
The paediatric disease enthesitis related arthritis (ERA) has many similarities to ankylosing spondylitis 
(AS), afflicting the adult population. In fact, one of the classification criteria is history of this disease in 
adult first degree relatives. Humira has demonstrated effect in AS and has been used in this indication 
since 2006. Extrapolation from approved indications was discussed and the MAH pointed to the similar 
clinical  features  and  common  manifestations  of  other  indications  such  as  AS,  non-radiographic  axial 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Spondyloarthritis and Psoriatic arthritis, of  which AS is the most important, where adalimumab has a 
well-documented effect.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The key secondary endpoints did not reach statistical significance, however the CHMP noted that in 
most cases the adalimumab group showed a slight improvement in response of variable size. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Adalimumab was generally well tolerated during the study M11-328. The most reported common AEs 
were upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis, and pharyngitis. 
The safety profile observed was consistent with previous clinical trials for adalimumab. 
The  MAH  has  provided  data  supporting  safety  of  adalimumab  in  other  related  indications,  such  as 
Ankylosing  spondylitis  (AS),  non-radiographic  axial  Spondyloarthritis  and  Psoriatic  arthritis.  This 
approach  is  considered  acceptable,  since  it  is  acknowledged  that  there  are  significant  clinical 
similarities between these diseases and ERA. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
No  new  safety  concerns  were  observed  in  the  pivotal  study.  Long  term  safety  data  for  the 
adalimumab-treated ERA  population is limited, but will become available through the OL extension of 
Study M11-328 (as described in the RMP).  
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The  current  therapeutic  arsenal  for  the  targeted  population  is  limited,  among  TNF-blockers  only 
etanercept is approved for this condition in children aged 12 years and older. The importance of having 
access  to  adalimumab  for  the  treatment  of  children  with  ERA  is  acknowledged.  No  signals  have 
emerged that would raise suspicion of particular risks in the ERA population. It is recognized that data 
is limited due to the low number of subjects, but the safety profile of Humira is well characterized both 
in the adult and the paediatric population. Humira is approved for the use in children aged 2 years and 
older  and  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  ERA  and  the  pJIA  populations  are  comparable  from  a  safety 
perspective. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
In one pivotal study a clinically relevant effect, difference in terms of per cent change in the number of 
active joints has been demonstrated. Although secondary endpoints were not met slight differences in 
response  favouring  Adalimumab  over  placebo  were  observed  at  week  12.    Moreover,  the  difference 
between  Adalimumab  and  placebo  group  in  terms  of  PEDI  70  at  week  12  consistently  support  the 
clinical  relevant  effect  of  the  primary  endpoint.  Importantly,  the  efficacy  is  further  supported  by  the 
fact  that  Humira  has  a  well-documented  effect  in  AS,  which  can  be  regarded  as  the  corresponding 
disease in adults.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

No  signals  have  emerged  that  would  raise  suspicion  of  particular  risks  in  the  ERA  population.  It  is 
recognized that data is limited due to the low number of subjects, but the safety profile of Humira is 
well  characterized  both  in  the  adult  and  the  paediatric  population  and  long  term  safety  data  for  the 
adalimumab-treated ERA population will become available through the OL extension of Study M11-328 
(as described in the RMP).  
In  summary,  a  clinically  relevant  effect  of  Adalimumab  has  been  demonstrated  for  the  primary 
endpoint  in  the  dedicated  ERA  pivotal  study  which  is  further  supported  by  the  corresponding  well 
documented effect in AS. No safety issues have emerged, and the safety profile of Humira in paediatric 
use  is  well  characterized  through  trials,  registry  data  and  post  marketing  experience  from  the  pJIA 
indication.  
The benefit-risk balance of adalimumab for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in 
patients, 6 years of age and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, 
conventional therapy, is considered positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
 The application for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and 
older is approvable since other concerns and major objections have all been resolved. 
Final  Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted

Page 64/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached. 
When the submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they should be submitted at the 
same time. 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
• 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
The MAH shall ensure that the Educational programme is implemented for currently authorised 
indications. This programme shall ensure that physicians who intend to prescribe Humira are aware 
of: 
-         the risk of serious infections, sepsis, tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections 
-         the risk of heart failure 
-         the risk of central nervous system demyelination 
-         the risk of malignancies 
-         the Patient Alert Card is to be given to patients using Humira 
  Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0259/2012 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
5.  EPAR changes

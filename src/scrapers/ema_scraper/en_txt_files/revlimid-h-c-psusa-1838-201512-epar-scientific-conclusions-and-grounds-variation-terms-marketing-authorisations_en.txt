Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for lenalidomide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
During the assessment of the previous PSUR, 1 of the 4 cumulative cases of acquired haemophilia was 
of concern, and close monitoring remained requested. During the period of this PSUR, 1 further new 
case of acquired haemophilia, well documented, was reported, with a total of 5 cases cumulatively. 
Considering cases with events chronology highly suggestive for causal relationship between 
lenalidomide and acquired haemophilia, and positive dechallenge and rechallenge, a causal relationship 
between acquired haemophilia and lenalidomide is strongly suggested and consequent update of the 
product information is required.  
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information of medicinal products containing lenalidomide were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for lenalidomide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing lenalidomide is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

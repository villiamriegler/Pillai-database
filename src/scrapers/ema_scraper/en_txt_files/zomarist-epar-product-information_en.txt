CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Zomarist is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus: 
• 
• 
in patients who are inadequately controlled with metformin hydrochloride alone. 
in patients who are already being treated with the combination of vildagliptin and metformin 
hydrochloride, as separate tablets. 
in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes, including insulin, 
when these do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for 
available data on different combinations).

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Adults with normal renal function (GFR ≥ 90 ml/min) 
The dose of antihyperglycaemic therapy with Zomarist should be individualised on the basis of the 
patient’s current regimen, effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum 
recommended daily dose of 100 mg vildagliptin. Zomarist may be initiated at either the 50 mg/850 mg 
or 50 mg/1000 mg tablet strength twice daily, one tablet in the morning and the other in the evening. 
For patients inadequately controlled at their maximal tolerated dose of metformin monotherapy: 
- 
The starting dose of Zomarist should provide vildagliptin as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily 
dose) plus the dose of metformin already being taken. 
For patients switching from co-administration of vildagliptin and metformin as separate tablets: 
- 
Zomarist should be initiated at the dose of vildagliptin and metformin already being taken. 
For patients inadequately controlled on dual combination with metformin and a sulphonylurea: 
- 
The doses of Zomarist should provide vildagliptin as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and 
a dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken. When Zomarist is used in combination 
with a sulphonylurea, a lower dose of the sulphonylurea may be considered to reduce the risk of 
hypoglycaemia. 
- 
For patients inadequately controlled on dual combination therapy with insulin and the maximal 
tolerated dose of metformin 
The dose of Zomarist should provide vildagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) 
and a dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken. 
The safety and efficacy of vildagliptin and metformin as triple oral therapy in combination with a 
thiazolidinedione have not been established. 
Special populations 
Elderly (≥ 65 years) 
As metformin is excreted via the kidney, and elderly patients have a tendency to decreased renal 
function, elderly patients taking Zomarist should have their renal function monitored regularly (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
A GFR should be assessed before initiation of treatment with metformin-containing products and at 
least annually thereafter. In patients at increased risk of further progression of renal impairment and in 
the elderly, renal function should be assessed more frequently, e.g. every 3-6 months. 
The maximum daily dose of metformin should preferably be divided into 2-3 daily doses. Factors that 
may increase the risk of lactic acidosis (see section 4.4) should be reviewed before considering 
initiation of metformin in patients with GFR<60 ml/min. 
If no adequate strength of Zomarist is available, individual monocomponents should be used instead of 
the fixed dose combination.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
General 
Zomarist is not a substitute for insulin in insulin-requiring patients and should not be used in patients 
with type 1 diabetes. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lactic acidosis 
Lactic acidosis, a very rare but serious metabolic complication, most often occurs at acute worsening 
of renal function or cardiorespiratory illness or sepsis. Metformin accumulation occurs at acute 
worsening of renal function and increases the risk of lactic acidosis. 
In case of dehydration (severe diarrhoea or vomiting, fever, or reduced fluid intake), metformin should 
be temporarily discontinued and contact with a healthcare professional is recommended. 
Medicinal products that can acutely impair renal function (such as antihypertensives, diuretics and 
NSAIDs) should be initiated with caution in metformin-treated patients. Other risk factors for lactic 
acidosis are excessive alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency, inadequately controlled diabetes, ketosis, 
prolonged fasting and any conditions associated with hypoxia, as well as concomitant use of medicinal 
products that may cause lactic acidosis (see also sections 4.3 and 4.5). 
Patients and/or care-givers should be informed of the risk of lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is 
characterised by acidotic dyspnoea, abdominal pain, muscle cramps, asthenia and hypothermia 
followed by coma. In case of suspected symptoms, the patient should stop taking metformin and seek 
immediate medical attention. Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH (< 7.35), 
increased plasma lactate levels (> 5 mmol/l) and an increased anion gap and lactate/pyruvate ratio. 
Administration of iodinated contrast agents 
Intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to contrast-induced nephropathy, 
resulting in metformin accumulation and increased risk of lactic acidosis. Metformin should be 
discontinued prior to or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until at least 48 hours 
after, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable (see sections 4.2 and 
4.5). 
Renal function 
GFR should be assessed before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter (see section 4.2). 
Metformin is contraindicated in patients with GFR <30 ml/min and should be temporarily 
discontinued in the presence of conditions that alter renal function (see section 4.3). 
Concomitant medicinal products that may affect renal function, result in significant haemodynamic 
change, or inhibit renal transport and increase metformin systemic exposure, should be used with 
caution (see section 4.5). 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with hepatic impairment, including those with pre-treatment ALT or AST > 3x ULN, should 
not be treated with Zomarist (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.8). 
Liver enzyme monitoring 
Rare cases of hepatic dysfunction (including hepatitis) have been reported with vildagliptin. In these 
cases, the patients were generally asymptomatic without clinical sequelae and liver function tests 
(LFTs) returned to normal after discontinuation of treatment. LFTs should be performed prior to the 
initiation of treatment with Zomarist in order to know the patient’s baseline value. Liver function 
should be monitored during treatment with Zomarist at three-month intervals during the first year and 
periodically thereafter. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be monitored with a 
second liver function evaluation to confirm the finding and be followed thereafter with frequent LFTs 
until the abnormality(ies) return(s) to normal. Should an increase in AST or in ALT of 3x ULN or 
greater persist, withdrawal of Zomarist therapy is recommended. Patients who develop jaundice or 
other signs suggestive of liver dysfunction should discontinue Zomarist. 
Following withdrawal of treatment with Zomarist and LFT normalisation, treatment with Zomarist 
should not be re-initiated. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Skin disorders 
Skin lesions, including blistering and ulceration have been reported with vildagliptin in extremities of 
monkeys in non-clinical toxicology studies (see section 5.3). Although skin lesions were not observed 
at an increased incidence in clinical trials, there was limited experience in patients with diabetic skin 
complications. Furthermore, there have been post-marketing reports of bullous and exfoliative skin 
lesions. Therefore, in keeping with routine care of the diabetic patient, monitoring for skin disorders, 
such as blistering or ulceration, is recommended. 
Acute pancreatitis 
Use of vildagliptin has beenassociated with a risk of developing of acute pancreatitis. Patients should 
be informed of the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis. 
If pancreatitis is suspected, vildagliptin should be discontinued if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, 
vildagliptin should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with history of acute 
pancreatitis. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Sulphonylureas are known to cause hypoglycaemia. Patients receiving vildagliptin in combination 
with a sulphonylurea may be at risk for hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of sulphonylurea may 
be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Surgery 
Metformin must be discontinuedat the time of surgery under general, spinal or epidural anaesthesia. 
Therapy may be restarted no earlier than 48 hours following surgery or resumption of oral nutrition 
and provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
There have been no formal interaction studies for Zomarist. The following statements reflect the 
information available on the individual active substances. 
Vildagliptin 
Vildagliptin has a low potential for interactions with co-administered medicinal products. Since 
vildagliptin is not a cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzyme substrate and does not inhibit or induce CYP 
450 enzymes, it is not likely to interact with active substances that are substrates, inhibitors or inducers 
of these enzymes. 
Results from clinical trials conducted with the oral antidiabetics pioglitazone, metformin and 
glyburide in combination with vildagliptin have shown no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic 
interactions in the target population. 
Drug-drug interaction studies with digoxin (P-glycoprotein substrate) and warfarin (CYP2C9 
substrate) in healthy subjects have shown no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions after co-
administration with vildagliptin. 
Drug-drug interaction studies in healthy subjects were conducted with amlodipine, ramipril, valsartan 
and simvastatin. In these studies, no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed 
after co-administration with vildagliptin. However, this has not been established in the target 
population. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Combination with ACE inhibitors 
There may be an increased risk of angioedema in patients concomitantly taking ACE inhibitors.(see 
section 4.8). 
As with other oral antidiabetic medicinal products the hypoglycaemic effect of vildagliptin may be 
reduced by certain active substances, including thiazides, corticosteroids, thyroid products and 
sympathomimetics. 
Metformin 
Combinations not recommended 
Alcohol 
Alcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in cases of 
fasting, malnutrition or hepatic impairment. 
Iodinated contrast agents 
Metformin must be discontinued prior to or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until 
at least 48 hours after, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Combinations requiring precautions for use 
Some medicinal products can adversely affect renal function which may increase the risk of lactic 
acidosis, e.g. NSAIDs, including selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) II inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, 
angiotensin II receptor antagonists and diuretics, especially loop diuretics. When starting or using such 
products in combination with metformin, close monitoring of renal function is necessary. 
Glucocorticoids, beta-2-agonists, and diuretics have intrinsic hyperglycaemic activity. The patient 
should be informed and more frequent blood glucose monitoring performed, especially at the 
beginning of treatment. If necessary, the dosage of Zomarist may need to be adjusted during 
concomitant therapy and on its discontinuation. 
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may decrease the blood glucose levels. If necessary, 
the dosage of the antihyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the 
other medicinal product and on its discontinuation. 
Concomitant use of medicinal products that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems 
involved in the renal elimination of metformin (e.g. organic cationic transporter-2 [OCT2] / multidrug 
and toxin extrusion [MATE] inhibitors such as ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir and cimetidine) 
could increase systemic exposure to metformin. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of Zomarist in pregnant women. For vildagliptin studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity at high doses. For metformin, studies in animals have not 
shown reproductive toxicity. Studies in animals performed with vildagliptin and metformin have not 
shown evidence of teratogenicity, but foetotoxic effects at maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). The 
potential risk for humans is unknown. Zomarist should not be used during pregnancy. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
Studies in animals have shown excretion of both metformin and vildagliptin in milk. It is unknown 
whether vildagliptin is excreted in human milk, but metformin is excreted in human milk in low 
amounts. Due to both the potential risk of neonate hypoglycaemia related to metformin and the lack of 
human data with vildagliptin, Zomarist should not be used during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
No studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted for Zomarist (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Patients who 
may experience dizziness as an adverse reaction should avoid driving vehicles or using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Safety data were obtained from a total of 6 197 patients exposed to vildagliptin/metformin in 
randomised placebo-controlled trials. Of these patients, 3 698 patients received vildagliptin/metformin 
and 2 499 patients received placebo/metformin. 
There have been no therapeutic clinical trials conducted with Zomarist. However, bioequivalence of 
Zomarist with co-administered vildagliptin and metformin has been demonstrated (see section 5.2). 
The majority of adverse reactions were mild and transient, not requiring treatment discontinuations. 
No association was found between adverse reactions and age, ethnicity, duration of exposure or daily 
dose. Vildagliptin use is associated with the risk of development of pancreatitis. Lactic acidosis has 
been reported following the use of metformin, especially in patients with underlying renal impairment 
(see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Vildagliptin 
Hepatic impairment 
Rare cases of hepatic dysfunction (including hepatitis) have been reported with vildagliptin. In these 
cases, the patients were generally asymptomatic without clinical sequelae and liver function returned 
to normal after discontinuation of treatment. In data from controlled monotherapy and add-on therapy 
trials of up to 24 weeks in duration, the incidence of ALT or AST elevations ≥ 3x ULN (classified as 
present on at least 2 consecutive measurements or at the final on-treatment visit) was 0.2%, 0.3% and 
0.2% for vildagliptin 50 mg once daily, vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily and all comparators, 
respectively. These elevations in transaminases were generally asymptomatic, non-progressive in 
nature and not associated with cholestasis or jaundice. 
Angioedema 
Rare cases of angioedema have been reported on vildagliptin at a similar rate to controls. A greater 
proportion of cases were reported when vildagliptin was administered in combination with an ACE 
inhibitor. The majority of events were mild in severity and resolved with ongoing vildagliptin 
treatment. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia was uncommon when vildagliptin (0.4%) was used as monotherapy in comparative 
controlled monotherapy studies with an active comparator or placebo (0.2%). No severe or serious 
events of hypoglycaemia were reported. When used as add-on to metformin, hypoglycaemia occurred 
in 1% of vildagliptin-treated patients and in 0.4% of placebo-treated patients. When pioglitazone was 
added, hypoglycaemia occurred in 0.6% of vildagliptin-treated patients and in 1.9% of placebo-treated 
patients. When sulphonylurea was added, hypoglycaemia occurred in 1.2% of vildagliptin treated 
patients and in 0.6% of placebo-treated patients. When sulphonylurea and metformin were added, 
hypoglycaemia occurred in 5.1% of vildagliptin-treated patients and in 1.9% of placebo-treated 
patients. In patients taking vildagliptin in combination with insulin, the incidence of hypoglycaemia 
was 14% for vildagliptin and 16% for placebo. 
Metformin 
Decrease of vitamin B12 absorption 
A decrease in vitamin B12 absorption with decrease in serum levels has been observed very rarely in 
patients who have been treated with metformin over a long period. Consideration of such aetiology is 
recommended if a patient presents with megaloblastic anaemia. 
Liver function 
Isolated cases of liver function test abnormalities or hepatitis resolving upon metformin 
discontinuation have been reported. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions occur most frequently during initiation of therapy and resolve 
spontaneously in most cases. To prevent them, it is recommended that metformin be taken in 2 daily 
doses during or after meals. A slow increase in the dose may also improve gastrointestinal tolerability. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
No data are available with regard to overdose of Zomarist. 
Vildagliptin 
Information regarding overdose with vildagliptin is limited. 
Symptoms 
Information on the likely symptoms of overdose with vildagliptin was taken from a rising dose 
tolerability study in healthy subjects given vildagliptin for 10 days. At 400 mg, there were three cases 
of muscle pain, and individual cases of mild and transient paraesthesia, fever, oedema and a transient 
increase in lipase levels. At 600 mg, one subject experienced oedema of the feet and hands, and 
increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK), AST, C-reactive protein (CRP) and myoglobin levels. 
Three other subjects experienced oedema of the feet, with paraesthesia in two cases. All symptoms 
and laboratory abnormalities resolved without treatment after discontinuation of the study medicinal 
product. 
Metformin 
A large overdose of metformin (or co-existing risk of lactic acidosis) may lead to lactic acidosis, 
which is a medical emergency and must be treated in hospital. 
Management 
The most effective method of removing metformin is haemodialysis. However, vildagliptin cannot be 
removed by haemodialysis, although the major hydrolysis metabolite (LAY 151) can. Supportive 
management is recommended. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, combinations of oral blood glucose lowering 
drugs, ATC code: A10BD08 
Mechanism of action 
Zomarist combines two antihyperglycaemic agents with complimentary mechanisms of action to 
improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: vildagliptin, a member of the islet 
enhancer class, and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class. 
Vildagliptin, a member of the islet enhancer class, is a potent and selective dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 
(DPP-4) inhibitor. Metformin acts primarily by decreasing endogenous hepatic glucose production. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Vildagliptin 
Vildagliptin acts primarily by inhibiting DPP-4, the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the 
incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic 
polypeptide). 
The administration of vildagliptin results in a rapid and complete inhibition of DPP-4 activity resulting 
in increased fasting and postprandial endogenous levels of the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
By increasing the endogenous levels of these incretin hormones, vildagliptin enhances the sensitivity 
of beta cells to glucose, resulting in improved glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Treatment with 
vildagliptin 50-100 mg daily in patients with type 2 diabetes significantly improved markers of beta 
cell function including HOMA- (Homeostasis Model Assessment–), proinsulin to insulin ratio and 
measures of beta cell responsiveness from the frequently-sampled meal tolerance test. In non-diabetic 
(normal glycaemic) individuals, vildagliptin does not stimulate insulin secretion or reduce glucose 
levels. 
By increasing endogenous GLP-1 levels, vildagliptin also enhances the sensitivity of alpha cells to 
glucose, resulting in more glucose-appropriate glucagon secretion. 
The enhanced increase in the insulin/glucagon ratio during hyperglycaemia due to increased incretin 
hormone levels results in a decrease in fasting and postprandial hepatic glucose production, leading to 
reduced glycaemia. 
The known effect of increased GLP-1 levels delaying gastric emptying is not observed with 
vildagliptin treatment. 
Metformin 
Metformin is a biguanide with antihyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and postprandial 
plasma glucose. It does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore does not produce hypoglycaemia 
or increased weight gain. 
- 
Metformin may exert its glucose-lowering effect via three mechanisms: 
- 
by reduction of hepatic glucose production through inhibition of gluconeogenesis and 
glycogenolysis; 
in muscle, by modestly increasing insulin sensitivity, improving peripheral glucose uptake and 
utilisation; 
by delaying intestinal glucose absorption. 
- 
Metformin stimulates intracellular glycogen synthesis by acting on glycogen synthase and increases 
the transport capacity of specific types of membrane glucose transporters (GLUT-1 and GLUT-4). 
In humans, independently of its action on glycaemia, metformin has favourable effects on lipid 
metabolism. This has been shown at therapeutic doses in controlled, medium-term or long-term 
clinical studies: metformin reduces serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and 
triglycerides. 
The prospective randomised UKPDS (UK Prospective Diabetes Study) study has established the long-
term benefit of intensive blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes. Analysis of the results for 
overweight patients treated with metformin after failure of diet alone showed: 
- 
a significant reduction in the absolute risk of any diabetes-related complication in the metformin 
group (29.8 events/1 000 patient-years) versus diet alone (43.3 events/1 000 patient-years), 
p=0.0023, and versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups 
(40.1 events/1 000 patient-years), p=0.0034; 
a significant reduction in the absolute risk of diabetes-related mortality: metformin 
7.5 events/1 000 patient-years, diet alone 12.7 events/1 000 patient-years, p=0.017; 
a significant reduction in the absolute risk of overall mortality: metformin 
13.5 events/1 000 patient-years versus diet alone 20.6 events/1 000 patient-years (p=0.011), and 
versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups 18.9 events/1,000 patient-
years (p=0.021); 
a significant reduction in the absolute risk of myocardial infarction: metformin 
11 events/1 000 patient-years, diet alone 18 events/1 000 patient-years (p=0.01).

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Vildagliptin added to patients whose glycaemic control was not satisfactory despite treatment with 
metformin monotherapy resulted after 6-month treatment in additional statistically significant mean 
reductions in HbA1c compared to placebo (between group differences of -0.7% to -1.1% for 
vildagliptin 50 mg and 100 mg, respectively). The proportion of patients who achieved a decrease in 
HbA1c of ≥ 0.7% from baseline was statistically significantly higher in both vildagliptin plus 
metformin groups (46% and 60%, respectively) versus the metformin plus placebo group (20%). 
In a 24-week trial, vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was compared to pioglitazone (30 mg once daily) 
in patients inadequately controlled with metformin (mean daily dose: 2020 mg). Mean reductions from 
baseline HbA1c of 8.4% were -0.9% with vildagliptin added to metformin and -1.0% with pioglitazone 
added to metformin. A mean weight gain of +1.9 kg was observed in patients receiving pioglitazone 
added to metformin compared to +0.3 kg in those receiving vildagliptin added to metformin. 
In a clinical trial of 2 years’ duration, vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was compared to glimepiride 
(up to 6 mg/day – mean dose at 2 years: 4.6 mg) in patients treated with metformin (mean daily dose: 
1894 mg). After 1 year mean reductions in HbA1c were -0.4% with vildagliptin added to metformin 
and -0.5% with glimepiride added to metformin, from a mean baseline HbA1c of 7.3%. Body weight 
change with vildagliptin was -0.2 kg vs +1.6 kg with glimepiride. The incidence of hypoglycaemia 
was significantly lower in the vildagliptin group (1.7%) than in the glimepiride group (16.2%). At 
study endpoint (2 years), the HbA1c was similar to baseline values in both treatment groups and the 
body weight changes and hypoglycaemia differences were maintained. 
In a 52-week trial, vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was compared to gliclazide (mean daily dose: 
229.5 mg) in patients inadequately controlled with metformin (metformin dose at baseline 
1928 mg/day). After 1 year, mean reductions in HbA1c were -0.81% with vildagliptin added to 
metformin (mean baseline HbA1c 8.4%) and -0.85% with gliclazide added to metformin (mean 
baseline HbA1c 8.5%); statistical non-inferiority was achieved (95% CI -0.11 – 0.20). Body weight 
change with vildagliptin was +0.1 kg compared to a weight gain of +1.4 kg with gliclazide. 
In a 24-week trial the efficacy of the fixed dose combination of vildagliptin and metformin (gradually 
titrated to a dose of 50 mg/500 mg twice daily or 50 mg/1000 mg twice daily) as initial therapy in 
drug-naïve patients was evaluated. Vildagliptin/metformin 50 mg/1000 mg twice daily reduced HbA1c 
by -1.82%, vildagliptin/metformin 50 mg/500 mg twice daily by -1.61%, metformin 1000 mg twice 
daily by -1.36% and vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily by -1.09% from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.6%. 
The decrease in HbA1c observed in patients with a baseline ≥10.0% was greater. 
A 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 318 patients to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) in combination with metformin 
(≥1500 mg daily) and glimepiride (≥4 mg daily). Vildagliptin in combination with metformin and 
glimepiride significantly decreased HbA1c compared with placebo. The placebo-adjusted mean 
reduction from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.8% was -0.76%. 
A five-year multi-centre, randomised, double-blind study (VERIFY) was conducted in patients with 
type 2 diabetes to evaluate the effect of an early combination therapy with vildagliptin and metformin 
(N = 998) against standard-of-care initial metformin monotherapy followed by combination with 
vildagliptin (sequential treatment group) (N = 1 003) in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes. 
The combination regimen of vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily plus metformin resulted in a statistically 
and clinically significant relative reduction in hazard for “time to confirmed initial treatment failure” 
(HbA1c value ≥7%) vs metformin monotherapy in treatment-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes over 
the 5-year study duration (HR [95%CI]: 0.51 [0.45, 0.58]; p<0.001). The incidence of initial treatment 
failure (HbA1c value ≥7%) was 429 (43.6%) patients in the combination treatment group and 
614 (62.1%) patients in the sequential treatment group. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 449 patients to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) in combination with a stable dose 
of basal or premixed insulin (mean daily dose 41 units), with concomitant use of metformin (N=276) 
or without concomitant metformin (N=173). Vildagliptin in combination with insulin significantly 
decreased HbA1c compared with placebo. In the overall population, the placebo-adjusted mean 
reduction from a mean baseline HbA1c 8.8% was -0.72%. In the subgroups treated with insulin with or 
without concomitant metformin the placebo-adjusted mean reduction in HbA1c was -0.63% 
and -0.84%, respectively. The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the overall population was 8.4% and 
7.2% in the vildagliptin and placebo groups, respectively. Patients receiving vildagliptin experienced 
no weight gain (+0.2 kg) while those receiving placebo experienced weight reduction (-0.7 kg). 
In another 24-week study in patients with more advanced type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on 
insulin (short and longer acting, average insulin dose 80 IU/day), the mean reduction in HbA1c when 
vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was added to insulin was statistically significantly greater than with 
placebo plus insulin (0.5% vs. 0.2%). The incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower in the vildagliptin 
group than in the placebo group (22.9% vs. 29.6%). 
Cardiovascular risk 
A meta-analysis of independently and prospectively adjudicated cardiovascular events from 37 phase 
III and IV monotherapy and combination therapy clinical studies of up to more than 2 years duration 
(mean exposure 50 weeks for vildagliptin and 49 weeks for comparators) was performed and showed 
that vildagliptin treatment was not associated witha n increase in cardiovascular risk versus 
comparators. The composite endpoint of adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) 
including acute myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death was similar for vildagliptin 
versus combined active and placebo comparators [Mantel–Haenszel risk ratio (M-H RR) 0.82 (95% CI 
0.61-1.11)]. A MACE occurred in 83 out of 9 599 (0.86%) vildagliptin-treated patients and in 85 out 
of 7 102 (1.20%) comparator-treated patients. Assessment of each individual MACE component 
showed no increased risk (similar M-H RR). Confirmed heart failure (HF) events defined as HF 
requiring hospitalisation or new onset of HF were reported in 41 (0.43%) vildagliptin-treated patients 
and 32 (0.45%) comparator-treated patients with M-H RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.68-1.70). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
vildagliptin in combination with metformin in all subsets of the paediatric population with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Zomarist 
Absorption 
Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between Zomarist at three dose strengths (50 mg/500 mg, 
50 mg/850 mg and 50 mg/1000 mg) versus free combination of vildagliptin and metformin 
hydrochloride tablets at the corresponding doses. 
Food does not affect the extent and rate of absorption of vildagliptin from Zomarist. The rate and 
extent of absorption of metformin from Zomarist 50 mg/1000 mg were decreased when given with 
food as reflected by the decrease in Cmax by 26%, AUC by 7% and delayed Tmax (2.0 to 4.0 h). 
The following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual active substances of 
Zomarist. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vildagliptin 
Absorption 
Following oral administration in the fasting state, vildagliptin is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma 
concentrations observed at 1.7 hours. Food slightly delays the time to peak plasma concentration to 
2.5 hours, but does not alter the overall exposure (AUC). Administration of vildagliptin with food 
resulted in a decreased Cmax (19%) compared to dosing in the fasting state. However, the magnitude of 
change is not clinically significant, so that vildagliptin can be given with or without food. The absolute 
bioavailability is 85%. 
Distribution 
The plasma protein binding of vildagliptin is low (9.3%) and vildagliptin distributes equally between 
plasma and red blood cells. The mean volume of distribution of vildagliptin at steady-state after 
intravenous administration (Vss) is 71 litres, suggesting extravascular distribution. 
Biotransformation 
Metabolism is the major elimination pathway for vildagliptin in humans, accounting for 69% of the 
dose. The major metabolite (LAY 151) is pharmacologically inactive and is the hydrolysis product of 
the cyano moiety, accounting for 57% of the dose, followed by the amide hydrolysis product (4% of 
dose). DPP-4 contributes partially to the hydrolysis of vildagliptin based on an in vivo study using 
DPP-4 deficient rats. Vildagliptin is not metabolised by CYP 450 enzymes to any quantifiable extent, 
and accordingly the metabolic clearance of vildagliptin is not anticipated to be affected by co-
medications that are CYP 450 inhibitors and/or inducers. In vitro studies demonstrated that 
vildagliptin does not inhibit/induce CYP 450 enzymes. Therefore, vildagliptin is not likely to affect 
metabolic clearance of co-medications metabolised by CYP 1A2, CYP 2C8, CYP 2C9, CYP 2C19, 
CYP 2D6, CYP 2E1 or CYP 3A4/5. 
Elimination 
Following oral administration of [14C] vildagliptin, approximately 85% of the dose was excreted into 
the urine and 15% of the dose was recovered in the faeces. Renal excretion of the unchanged 
vildagliptin accounted for 23% of the dose after oral administration. After intravenous administration 
to healthy subjects, the total plasma and renal clearances of vildagliptin are 41 and 13 l/h, respectively. 
The mean elimination half-life after intravenous administration is approximately 2 hours. The 
elimination half-life after oral administration is approximately 3 hours. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The Cmax for vildagliptin and the area under the plasma concentrations versus time curves (AUC) 
increased in an approximately dose proportional manner over the therapeutic dose range. 
Characteristics in patients 
Gender: No clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of vildagliptin were observed 
between male and female healthy subjects within a wide range of age and body mass index (BMI). 
DPP-4 inhibition by vildagliptin is not affected by gender. 
Age: In healthy elderly subjects (≥ 70 years), the overall exposure of vildagliptin (100 mg once daily) 
was increased by 32%, with an 18% increase in peak plasma concentration as compared to young 
healthy subjects (18-40 years). These changes are not considered to be clinically relevant, however. 
DPP-4 inhibition by vildagliptin is not affected by age. 
Hepatic impairment: In subjects with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A-C) 
there were no clinically significant changes (maximum ~30%) in exposure to vildagliptin. 
Renal impairment: In subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, systemic exposure to 
vildagliptin was increased (Cmax 8-66%; AUC 32-134%) and total body clearance was reduced 
compared to subjects with normal renal function. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ethnic group: Limited data suggest that race does not have any major influence on vildagliptin 
pharmacokinetics. 
Metformin 
Absorption 
After an oral dose of metformin, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) is achieved after about 
2.5 h. Absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg metformin tablet is approximately 50-60% in healthy 
subjects. After an oral dose, the non-absorbed fraction recovered in faeces was 20-30%. 
After oral administration, metformin absorption is saturable and incomplete. It is assumed that the 
pharmacokinetics of metformin absorption are non-linear. At the usual metformin doses and dosing 
schedules, steady state plasma concentrations are reached within 24-48 h and are generally less than 
1 µg/ml. In controlled clinical trials, maximum metformin plasma levels (Cmax) did not exceed 
4 µg/ml, even at maximum doses. 
Food slightly delays and decreases the extent of the absorption of metformin. Following 
administration of a dose of 850 mg, the plasma peak concentration was 40% lower, AUC was 
decreased by 25% and time to peak plasma concentration was prolonged by 35 minutes. The clinical 
relevance of this decrease is unknown. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding is negligible. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes. The mean volume of 
distribution (Vd) ranged between 63-276 litres. 
Biotransformation 
Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine. No metabolites have been identified in humans. 
Elimination 
Metformin is eliminated by renal excretion. Renal clearance of metformin is > 400 ml/min, indicating 
that metformin is eliminated by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Following an oral dose, the 
apparent terminal elimination half-life is approximately 6.5 h. When renal function is impaired, renal 
clearance is decreased in proportion to that of creatinine and thus the elimination half-life is 
prolonged, leading to increased levels of metformin in plasma. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Animal studies of up to 13-week duration have been conducted with the combined substances in 
Zomarist. No new toxicities associated with the combination were identified. The following data are 
findings from studies performed with vildagliptin or metformin individually. 
Vildagliptin 
Intra-cardiac impulse conduction delays were observed in dogs with a no-effect dose of 15 mg/kg (7-
fold human exposure based on Cmax). 
Accumulation of foamy alveolar macrophages in the lung was observed in rats and mice. The no-
effect dose in rats was 25 mg/kg (5-fold human exposure based on AUC) and in mice 750 mg/kg (142-
fold human exposure). 
Gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly soft faeces, mucoid faeces, diarrhoea and, at higher doses, 
faecal blood were observed in dogs. A no-effect level was not established. 
Vildagliptin was not mutagenic in conventional in vitro and in vivo tests for genotoxicity. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A fertility and early embryonic development study in rats revealed no evidence of impaired fertility, 
reproductive performance or early embryonic development due to vildagliptin. Embryofoetal toxicity 
was evaluated in rats and rabbits. An increased incidence of wavy ribs was observed in rats in 
association with reduced maternal body weight parameters, with a no-effect dose of 75 mg/kg (10-fold 
human exposure). In rabbits, decreased foetal weight and skeletal variations indicative of 
developmental delays were noted only in the presence of severe maternal toxicity, with a no-effect 
dose of 50 mg/kg (9-fold human exposure). A pre- and postnatal development study was performed in 
rats. Findings were only observed in association with maternal toxicity at ≥ 150 mg/kg and included a 
transient decrease in body weight and reduced motor activity in the F1 generation. 
A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats at oral doses up to 900 mg/kg (approximately 
200 times human exposure at the maximum recommended dose). No increases in tumour incidence 
attributable to vildagliptin were observed. Another two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in 
mice at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas and 
haemangiosarcomas was observed with a no-effect dose of 500 mg/kg (59-fold human exposure) and 
100 mg/kg (16-fold human exposure), respectively. The increased incidence of these tumours in mice 
is considered not to represent a significant risk to humans based on the lack of genotoxicity of 
vildagliptin and its principal metabolite, the occurrence of tumours only in one species, and the high 
systemic exposure ratios at which tumours were observed. 
In a 13-week toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys, skin lesions have been recorded at doses 
≥ 5 mg/kg/day. These were consistently located on the extremities (hands, feet, ears and tail). At 
5 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to human AUC exposure at the 100 mg dose), only blisters 
were observed. They were reversible despite continued treatment and were not associated with 
histopathological abnormalities. Flaking skin, peeling skin, scabs and tail sores with correlating 
histopathological changes were noted at doses ≥ 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times human AUC 
exposure at the 100 mg dose). Necrotic lesions of the tail were observed at ≥ 80 mg/kg/day. Skin 
lesions were not reversible in the monkeys treated at 160 mg/kg/day during a 4-week recovery period. 
Metformin 
Non-clinical data on metformin reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of 
safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to 
reproduction.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Zomarist is and what it is used for 
The active substances of Zomarist, vildagliptin and metformin, belong to a group of medicines called 
“oral antidiabetics”. 
Zomarist is used to treat adult patients with type 2 diabetes. This type of diabetes is also known as 
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Zomarist is used when diabetes cannot be controlled by diet 
and exercise alone and/or with other medicines used to treat diabetes (insulin or sulphonylureas). 
Type 2 diabetes develops if the body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin that the body 
makes does not work as well as it should. It can also develop if the body produces too much glucagon. 
Both insulin and glucagon are made in the pancreas. Insulin helps to lower the level of sugar in the 
blood, especially after meals. Glucagon triggers the liver to make sugar, causing the blood sugar level 
to rise. 
How Zomarist works 
Both active substances, vildagliptin and metformin, help to control the level of sugar in the blood. The 
substance vildagliptin works by making the pancreas produce more insulin and less glucagon. The 
substance metformin works by helping the body to make better use of insulin. This medicine has been 
shown to reduce blood sugar, which may help to prevent complications from your diabetes. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you take Zomarist 
Do not take Zomarist 
- 
if you are allergic to vildagliptin, metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). If you think you may be allergic to any of these, talk to your doctor before 
taking Zomarist. 
if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with, for example, severe hyperglycaemia (high blood 
glucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see “Risk of lactic 
acidosis” below) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called ketone 
bodies accumulate in the blood and which can lead to diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include 
stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity 
smell. 
if you have recently had a heart attack or if you have heart failure or serious problems with your 
blood circulation or difficulties in breathing which could be a sign of heart problems. 
if you have severely reduced kidney function. 
if you have a severe infection or are seriously dehydrated (have lost a lot of water from your 
body). 
if you are going to have a contrast x-ray (a specific type of x-ray involving an injectable dye). 
Please also see information about this in section “Warnings and precautions”. 
if you have liver problems. 
if you drink alcohol excessively (whether every day or only from time to time). 
if you are breast-feeding (see also “Pregnancy and breast-feeding”).

Warnings and precautions 
Risk of lactic acidosis 
Zomarist may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if your 
kidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with 
uncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further 
information below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a 
reduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease). 
If any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions. 
Stop taking Zomarist for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with 
dehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to 
heat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further instructions. 
Stop taking Zomarist and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you experience 
some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma. 
Symptoms of lactic acidosis include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
vomiting 
stomach ache (abdominal pain) 
muscle cramps 
a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness 
difficulty in breathing 
reduced body temperature and heartbeat 
Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital. 
Zomarist is not a substitute for insulin. Therefore, you should not receive Zomarist for the treatment of 
type 1 diabetes. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Zomarist if you have or have had a disease of 
the pancreas. 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Zomarist if you are taking an anti-diabetic 
medicine known as a sulphonylurea. Your doctor may want to reduce your dose of the sulphonylurea 
when you take it together with Zomarist in order to avoid low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have previously taken vildagliptin but had to stop taking it because of liver disease, you should 
not take this medicine. 
Diabetic skin lesions are a common complication of diabetes. You are advised to follow the 
recommendations for skin and foot care that you are given by your doctor or nurse. You are also 
advised to pay particular attention to new onset of blisters or ulcers while taking Zomarist. Should 
these occur, you should promptly consult your doctor. 
If you need to have major surgery you must stop taking Zomarist during and for some time after the 
procedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with 
Zomarist. 
A test to determine your liver function will be performed before the start of Zomarist treatment, at 
three-month intervals for the first year and periodically thereafter. This is so that signs of increased 
liver enzymes can be detected as early as possible. 
During treatment with Zomarist, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year or 
more frequently if you are elderly and/or have worsening renal function. 
Your doctor will test your blood and urine for sugar regularly. 
Children and adolescents 
The use of Zomarist in children and adolescents up to 18 years of age is not recommended. 
Other medicines and Zomarist 
If you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for 
example in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Zomarist before or at the time of the 
injection. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with 
Zomarist. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. You may 
need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests or your doctor may need to adjust the 
dosage of Zomarist. It is especially important to mention the following: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
glucocorticoids generally used to treat inflammation 
beta-2 agonists generally used to treat respiratory disorders 
other medicines used to treat diabetes

your blood sugar. Do not stop taking Zomarist unless your doctor tells you to. If you have any 
questions about how long to take this medicine, talk to your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

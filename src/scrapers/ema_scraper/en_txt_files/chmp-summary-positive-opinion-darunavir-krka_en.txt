Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Darunavir Krka 
darunavir 
On 9 November 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Darunavir 
Krka, intended for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection. The applicant for 
this medicinal product is Krka, d.d., Novo mesto. 
Darunavir Krka will be available as film-coated tablets (400 mg, 600 mg and 800 mg). The active 
substance of Darunavir Krka is darunavir, a protease inhibitor (ATC code: J05AE10). It acts by inhibiting 
the HIV enzyme protease, thus preventing formation of mature virus.  
Darunavir KrKa must be given with a small dose of ritonavir (as a booster), which decreases the 
breakdown of darunavir in the liver, resulting in higher levels of darunavir in the blood.  
Darunavir Krka is a generic of Prezista, which has been authorised in the EU since 12 February 2007. 
Studies have demonstrated the satisfactory quality of Darunavir Krka, and its bioequivalence to the 
reference product Prezista. A question and answer document on generic medicines can be found here. 
The full indication for the 400 mg and 800 mg tablets is: 
“Darunavir Krka, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is indicated in combination with other 
antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV-1) infection. 
Darunavir Krka 400 mg and 800 mg tablets may be used to provide suitable dose regimens for the 
treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult and paediatric patients from the age of 3 years and at least 
40 kg body weight who are: 
• 
antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve (see section 4.2). 
•  ART-experienced with no darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs) and who have 
plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l. In deciding to 
initiate treatment with darunavir in such ART-experienced patients, genotypic testing should 
guide the use of darunavir (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).”

days from adoption of the opinion

The full indication for the 600 mg tablets is: 
“Darunavir Krka, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is indicated in combination with other 
antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV-1) infection. 
Darunavir Krka 600 mg tablets may be used to provide suitable dose regimens (see section 4.2): 
• 
• 
For the treatment of HIV-1 infection in antiretroviral treatment (ART)-experienced adult patients, 
including those that have been highly pre-treated. 
For the treatment of HIV-1 infection in paediatric patients from the age of 3 years and at least 
15 kg body weight. 
In deciding to initiate treatment with darunavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir, careful 
consideration should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns of 
mutations associated with different agents. Genotypic or phenotypic testing (when available) and 
treatment history should guide the use of darunavir.” 
It is proposed that Darunavir Krka be initiated by physicians experienced in the management of HIV 
infection.  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

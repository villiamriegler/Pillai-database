  Description 
  Methods 
•  Objective(s) 
Primary objective: 
To demonstrate that the immunogenicity of at least one DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib formulation is non-
inferior  to  the  licensed  formulation  in  terms  of  seroprotection  rates  to  diphtheria,  tetanus, 
hepatitis B and PRP antigens and in terms of antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) 
for pertussis antigens one month after the third dose of the primary vaccination. 
Criteria for non-inferiority: 
-  Non-inferiority  in  terms  of  immune  response  to  diphtheria,  tetanus,  hepatitis  B  and  PRP 
antigens  was  demonstrated  if  the  upper  limit  of  the  97.5%  confidence  interval  (CI)  on  the 
group difference [Control minus investigational] in the percentage of seroprotected subjects 
for each antigen was ≤ 10% and, 
-  Non-inferiority  in  terms  of  immune  response  to  pertussis  antigens  was  demonstrated  if,  for 
each of the three antigens, the upper limit of the 97.5% CI on the GMC ratio [Control divided 
by investigational] was ≤ 1.5. 
Secondary objective: 
-  To  assess  the  immunological  response  to  the  study  vaccines  in  terms  of  seroprotection 
status,  seropositivity  status  and  antibody  concentrations  or  titres,  one  month  after  the  third 
dose of the primary vaccination. 
-  To assess the immunological status towards diphtheria, tetanus pertussis and polio antigens 
in  terms  of  seroprotection  status,  seropositivity  status  and  antibody  concentrations,  before 
the first dose of the primary vaccination. 
-  To assess the immunological response to pertussis antigens in terms of vaccine response, 
one month after the third dose of the primary vaccination. 
-  To  assess  the  safety  and  reactogenicity  of  the  study  vaccines  in  terms  of  solicited  and 
unsolicited, local and general symptoms and serious adverse events. 
Only the objective related to licensed vaccine is presented.

in 
*A seroprotected subject  was defined as a subject whose antibody concentrations were above 
or equal to the following cut-off values: 
•  Anti-PRP antibody concentration ≥ 0.15 μg/mL 
•  Anti-HBs antibody concentration ≥ 10 mIU/mL 
•  Anti-diphtheria (anti-D) antibody concentration ≥ 0.1 IU/mL 
•  Anti-tetanus (anti-T) antibody concentration ≥ 0.1 IU/mL 
•  Study design 
This was a double-blind, randomised, multicentre study with three parallel groups, conducted in 
the Dominican Republic and Finland. Two blood samples were drawn from all subjects: 3.5 mL 
of blood was collected before the first vaccine dose and 5 mL of blood was collected one month 
after the third vaccine dose. Subjects were allocated to one of the two sub-cohorts depending on 
the country of recruitment. Sub-cohort 1 included all subjects in Finland (pneumococcal assays 
were performed only for this sub-cohort of subjects) and sub-cohort 2 included all subjects from 
the Dominican Republic.

The three study groups were as follows: 
-  Form  A  Group:  received  three  doses  of  GSK  Biologicals’  investigational  DATAPa-
HBVIPV/Hib vaccine and Pfizer’s 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine (Prevenar13) at 2, 3 and 
4 months of age. 
-  Form  B  Group:  received  three  doses  of  GSK  Biologicals’  investigational  DBTBPa-
HBVIPV/Hib vaccine and Pfizer’s 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine (Prevenar13) at 2, 3 and 
4 months of age. 
-  Control  Group:  received  three  doses  of  GSK  Biologicals’  licensed  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib 
vaccine  (Infanrix  hexa)  and  Pfizer’s  13-valent  pneumococcal  vaccine  (Prevenar13)  at  2,  3 
and 4 months of age. 
•  Study population /Sample size 
Study Population: Healthy male or female subjects between and including, 60 and 90 days of 
age at the time of the first vaccination. The subject should not have had previous or intercurrent 
diphtheria,  tetanus,  pertussis,  polio,  hepatitis  B,  Hib  and/or  pneumococcal  vaccination  or 
disease,  with  the  exception  of  hepatitis  B  vaccination  at  birth.  Written  informed  consent  was 
obtained  from  the  parents/legally  acceptable  representative(s)  [LAR(s)]  of  the  subject  before 
entry into the study.

•  Efficacy results 
Immunogenicity: 
The immunogenicity analysis was performed on the ATP cohort and Total vaccination cohort.  
Primary objectives: non-inferiority in terms of immune response to diphtheria, tetanus, 
hepatitis B, pertussis and PRP:  
Analysis was performed one month post-primary vaccination, for each investigational group: 
-  The  upper  limits  of  the  standardized  asymptotic  97.5%  CI  on  the  difference  between  the 
groups (Control minus each investigational group) in terms of diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B 
and PRP seroprotection rates were all below 10%. 
-  The upper limits of the 97.5% CI on the anti-PT and anti-FHA GMC ratio (Control divided by 
each investigational group) were all below 1.5, but, the upper limit of the 97.5% CI on the 
anti-PRN GMC ratio (Control divided by each investigational group) exceeded 1.5. 
-  Thus,  the  non-inferiority  of  the  investigational  DATAPa-HBV-IPV/HibGD  and  DBTBPa-
HBVIPV/HibGD  vaccines  co-administered  with  Prevenar  13  to  the  licensed  Infanrix  hexa 
vaccine coadministered with Prevenar 13 was not demonstrated. 
Secondary objectives (descriptive analysis):  
One month post-primary vaccination (ATP cohort for immunogenicity) 
-  Seroprotective concentrations of antibodies against diphtheria and tetanus were observed in 
100% of subjects in the three groups. 
-  At  least  97.5%  subjects  in  all  groups  had  seroprotective  levels  of  anti-HBs  antibody 
concentrations. 
-  Seropositive antibody levels against PT, FHA and PRN were observed in 100% subjects in 
the three groups. Across groups, vaccine response to PT, FHA and PRN was mounted by at 
least 97.1%, 96.9% and 91% of subjects, respectively.

-  The percentage of subjects with anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥ 0.15 µg/ml was 92.1% 
in Form A group, 87.9% in Form B group and 88.5% in the Control Group. 
-  Seroprotective titres of antibodies against poliovirus types 1 and 3 were observed in at least 
97.4%  and  97.9%  of  subjects,  respectively.  Seroprotective  titres  against  poliovirus  type  2 
ranged from 90.5% to 94.8% across the three groups. 
-  Across  groups,  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  pneumococcal  antibody  concentrations  ≥ 
0.15  µg/mL  was  at  least  96.5%  except for  serotypes  6B  (90.3%)  and 23F  (92.9%)  and  the 
percentage  of  subjects  with  pneumococcal  antibody  concentrations  ≥  0.35  µg/mL  was  at 
least 90.1% except for serotypes 6B (70.5%) and 23F (78.1%).

•  Safety results 
Safety /reactogenicity: 
The safety analysis was performed on the Total vaccinated cohort. 
Any  symptom:  The  percentage  of  doses  followed  by  a  report  of  any  symptom  (solicited  and 
unsolicited, local and general) ranged from 87.8% to 91.2% in the three groups. The majority of 
the symptoms were reported during the first 4 (Days 0-3) days following vaccination. 
Solicited  local  symptoms:  Injection  site  pain  was  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  local 
symptom in the three groups, reported following 52.9%, 52.2% and 41.8% doses in the Form A, 
Form B and Control groups, respectively. The most common grade 3 solicited local symptom in 
the three groups was swelling, reported following 7.4% doses in Form A group and 8.1% doses 
in the Form B and Control groups. 
Solicited  general  symptoms:  Irritability  (any  and  grade  3)  was  the  most  frequently  reported 
solicited  general  symptom  in  the  three  groups.  Grade  3  fever  (>  39.0  °C  axillary  temperature)

was  reported  for  0.7%  of  subjects  in  Form  A  and  Form  B  groups  and  0.6%  of  subjects  in  the 
Control group. 
Unsolicited  symptoms:  During  the  31-day  follow-up  period,  according  to  the  overall/subject 
analysis,  grade  3  unsolicited  symptoms  were  reported for  7.1%,  8.7%  and  6.7%  of  subjects  in 
the  Form  A,  Form  B  and  Control  groups,  respectively.  Unsolicited  symptoms  with  a  causal 
relationship to vaccination were reported for 21.7%, 21.1% and 23% of subjects in the Form A, 
Form B and Control groups, respectively. 
Concomitant  medication:  The  percentage  of  doses  followed  by  at  least  one  concomitant 
medication  during  the  31-day  follow  up  period  following  vaccination  was  60.1%,  59.2%  and 
52.2%  in  the  Form  A,  Form  B  and  Control  groups,  respectively.  Prophylactic  antipyretics  were 
given after not more than 4.6% of doses in the three groups. 
Serious adverse events: SAEs were reported for 9 (3.8%), 5 (2.1%) and 4 (1.7%) subjects in 
the  Form  A,  Form  B  and  Control  groups,  respectively.  One  fatal  SAE  was  reported  during  the 
entire study period: This fatal case was described for a 2-month-old female (subject 1929) who 
died 17 days after Dose 1 of the Form A vaccine due to asphyxia and interstitial lung disease. 
The  subject  was  co-sleeping  with  her  parents.  The  majority  of  the  SAEs  reported  across  the 
groups  were  lower  respiratory  illnesses  (i.e.  bronchiolitis,  pneumonia,  etc).  None  of  the  SAEs 
were considered to be potentially related to vaccination by the investigator. 
Withdrawals due to adverse events /serious adverse events: One death was reported during 
the study for a subject from the Form A group. Subject number 1929 died 17 days after receiving 
the first dose of the study vaccine due to asphyxia and interstitial lung disease. This event was 
considered by the investigator not to be related to vaccination. 
Important safety information received after the data lock point (database freeze date): No 
safety information was received after the data lock point (database freeze date) for this study. 
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
Inferential  immunogenicity  objectives  (One  month  post  primary  vaccination,  for  each 
investigational group) 
The primary objective of the study was not met: non-inferiority of the immunogenicity respons  to 
Formulation A versus Infanrix hexa and to Formulation B versus Infanrix hexa was not met: 
-  Non-inferiority  in  terms  of  immune  response  to  diphtheria,  tetanus  and  hepatitis  B  was 
demonstrated  since  the  upper  limits  of  the  standardised  asymptotic  97.5%  CI  on  the 
between  groupdifference  (Control  group  minus  each  investigational  group)  in  terms  of 
seroprotection  rates  to  D,  T  and  HBs  were  below  the  pre-defined  non-inferiority  margin  of 
10%. 
-  For  each  formulation,  the  upper  limits  of  the  97.5%  CI  on  the  GMC  ratio  (Control  group 
divided by each investigational group) were below 1.5, the pre-defined clinical limit for non-
inferiority, in terms of immune response to PT and FHA. The upper limits of the 97.5% CI on 
the  GMC  ratio  for  anti-PRN  was  1.54  (Control  group  divided  by  Form  A  group)  and  1.84 
(Control  group  divided  by  Form  B  group),  and  exceeded  the  pre-defined  non-inferiority 
margin of 1.5. 
-  For PRP, the upper limits of the standardised asymptotic 97.5% CI on the group difference 
(Control  group  minus  each  investigational  group)  for  the  percentage  of  seroprotected 
subjects was below 10%, the pre-defined clinical limit for non-inferiority. However, in view of 
the  sequential  nature  of  analysis  non-inferiority  for  PRP  could  not  be  concluded  for  both 
formulations.

Descriptive immunogenicity objectives: 
-  One month post primary vaccination, between 97.5% and 100% subjects had seroprotective 
antibodies  against  diphtheria,  tetanus  and  hepatitis  B.  Between  90.5%  to  97.9%  subjects 
had  seroprotective  antibodies  against  the  three  poliovirus  types.  Anti-PRP  seroprotection 
rates  ranged  from  87.9%  to  92.1%.  Seropositive  antibody  levels  against  pertussis  were 
observed in 100% of the subjects in the three groups. 
Safety and reactogenicity objectives: 
-  The observed incidence of solicited adverse events tended to be higher in the investigational 
groups than in the Control group. Overall solicited incidence of fever >38 °C per subject was 
higher in Form A (33.8%) and Form B (30.8) compared to the control group (18.1%). 
-  At  least  one  unsolicited  AE  was  reported  for  153  (63.8%),  165  (68.2%),  and  159  (66.5%) 
subjects in the Form A, Form B and Control groups, respectively. SAEs were reported for 9 
(3.8%),  5  (2.1%)  and  4  (1.7%)  subjects  in  the  Form  A,  Form  B  and  Control  groups, 
respectively. One fatal SAE was reported during the entire study period: Subject 1929 from 
Form A group died 17 days after Dose 1 of the study vaccine due to asphyxia and interstitial 
lung disease. None of the SAEs were considered to be potentially related to vaccination by 
the investigator. 
V. 
RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND 
RECOMMENDATION 
  Overall conclusion 
The MAH submitted the results of a double-blind, randomised, multicentre study to assess safety 
and immunogenicity of 2 new formulations of the MAH's DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine compared 
to the licensed Infanrix Hexa vaccine when co-administered with Prevenar 13 to healthy infants 
as a primary vaccination course at 2, 3 and 4 months of age.  
The  primary  objective,  i.e.  non-inferiority  of  the  immunogenicity  of  at  least  one  of  the  novel 
DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  vaccine  formulations  compared  to  the  licensed  Infanrix  Hexa  vaccine,  was 
not met according to the criteria set for non-inferiority, as the immune response to the pertactin 
component of both novel formulations was not non-inferior to Infanrix Hexa. No divergent safety 
signals were detected in the comparison of the new formulation with the licensed Infanrix Hexa. 
The  MAH  should  continue  to  investigate  in  pertussis  vaccines  that  offer  prolonged  protection 
compared  to  the  currently  authorised  vaccines  in  view  of  the  resurgence  of  pertussis  in  fully 
vaccinated  individuals  which  appears  to  be  at  least  partly  due  to  waning  vaccine-induced 
immunity (Cherry, 2012).

Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Lacosamide Accord 
lacosamide 
On 20 July 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Lacosamide 
Accord, intended for the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in 
patients with epilepsy. The applicant for this medicinal product is Accord Healthcare Ltd. 
Lacosamide Accord will be available as 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg film-coated tablets. The 
active substance of Lacosamide Accord is lacosamide, an antiepileptic (ATC code: N03AX18) which 
selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilisation of 
hyper-excitable neuronal membranes. 
Lacosamide Accord is a generic of Vimpat, which has been authorised in the EU since 29 August 2008. No 
bioequivalence studies have been conducted since a BCS-based biowaiver was granted,2 in which 
assumption of equivalence in in vivo performance was justified by in vitro data. A question and answer 
document on generic medicines can be found here. 
The approved indication is: “Lacosamide Accord is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in 
the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adult and adolescent 
(16-18 years) patients with epilepsy.” It is proposed that Lacosamide Accord is prescribed by physicians 
experienced in the treatment of epilepsy. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

days from adoption of the opinion 
2 In accordance with Appendix III of the Guideline on investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr

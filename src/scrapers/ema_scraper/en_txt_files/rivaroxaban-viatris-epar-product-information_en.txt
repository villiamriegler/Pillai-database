CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Rivaroxaban Viatris  co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus 
clopidogrel or ticlopidine, is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients 
after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with elevated cardiac biomarkers (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 
5.1). 
Rivaroxaban Viatris co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the prevention of 
atherothrombotic events in adult patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or symptomatic 
peripheral artery disease (PAD) at high risk of ischaemic events. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily. 
 
ACS 
Patients taking Rivaroxaban Viatris 2.5 mg twice daily should also take a daily dose of 75 – 100 mg 
ASA or a daily dose of 75 – 100 mg ASA in addition to either a daily dose of 75 mg clopidogrel or a 
standard daily dose of ticlopidine. 
Treatment should be regularly evaluated in the individual patient weighing the risk for ischaemic 
events against the bleeding risks. Extension of treatment beyond 12 months should be done on an 
individual patient basis as experience up to 24 months is limited (see section 5.1). 
Treatment with Rivaroxaban Viatris should be started as soon as possible after stabilisation of the 
ACS event (including revascularisation procedures); at the earliest 24 hours after admission to hospital 
and at the time when parenteral anticoagulation therapy would normally be discontinued.  
 
CAD/PAD 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients taking Rivaroxaban Viatris 2.5 mg twice daily should also take a daily dose of 75 – 100 mg 
ASA. 
In patients after a successful revascularisation procedure of the lower limb (surgical or endovascular 
including hybrid procedures) due to symptomatic PAD, treatment should not be started until 
haemostasis is achieved (see section 5.1). 
Duration of treatment should be determined for each individual patient based on regular evaluations 
and should consider the risk for thrombotic events versus the bleeding risks.  
 
ACS, CAD/PAD 
Co-administration with antiplatelet therapy  
In patients with an acute thrombotic event or vascular procedure and a need for dual antiplatelet 
therapy, the continuation of Rivaroxaban Viatris 2.5 mg twice daily should be evaluated depending on 
the type of event or procedure and antiplatelet regimen. 
Safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris 2.5 mg twice daily in combination with dual antiplatelet 
therapy have been studied in patients 
• 
• 
with recent ACS in combination with ASA plus clopidogrel/ticlopidine (see section 4.1), and  
after recent revascularisation procedure of the lower limb due to symptomatic PAD in 
combination with ASA and, if applicable, short-term clopidogrel use (see sections 4.4 and 5.1) 
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed the patient should continue with the regular dose as recommended at the next 
scheduled time. The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose.  
Converting from Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) to Rivaroxaban Viatris  
When converting patients from VKAs to Rivaroxaban Viatris, International Normalised Ratio (INR) 
values could be falsely elevated after the intake of Rivaroxaban Viatris. The INR is not valid to 
measure the anticoagulant activity of Rivaroxaban Viatris, and therefore should not be used (see 
section 4.5).  
Converting from Rivaroxaban Viatris to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA)  
There is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from Rivaroxaban Viatris to 
VKA. Continuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate 
anticoagulant. It should be noted that Rivaroxaban Viatris can contribute to an elevated INR.  
In patients converting from Rivaroxaban Viatris to VKA, VKA should be given concurrently until the 
INR is ≥ 2.0. For the first two days of the conversion period, standard initial dosing of VKA should be 
used followed by VKA dosing, as guided by INR testing. While patients are on both Rivaroxaban 
Viatris and VKA the INR should not be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to 
the next dose of Rivaroxaban Viatris. Once Rivaroxaban Viatris is discontinued INR testing may be 
done reliably at least 24 hours after the last dose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).  
Converting from parenteral anticoagulants to Rivaroxaban Viatris  
For patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, discontinue the parenteral anticoagulant 
and start Rivaroxaban Viatris 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of the 
parenteral medicinal product (e.g. low molecular weight heparins) would be due or at the time of 
discontinuation of a continuously administered parenteral medicinal product (e.g. intravenous 
unfractionated heparin). 
Converting from Rivaroxaban Viatris to parenteral anticoagulants  
Give the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next Rivaroxaban Viatris dose would be 
taken. 
Special populations  
Renal impairment  
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Limited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 – 29 ml/min) 
indicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased. Therefore, Rivaroxaban 
Viatris is to be used with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine 
clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 – 
80 ml/min) or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 – 49 ml/min) (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment  
Rivaroxaban Viatris is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy 
and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see 
sections 4.3 and 5.2).  
Elderly population  
No dose adjustment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2)  
The risk of bleeding increases with increasing age (see section 4.4).  
Body weight  
No dose adjustment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2)  
Gender  
No dose adjustment (see section 5.2)  
Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris 2.5 mg tablets in children aged 0 to 18 years have not 
been established. No data are available. Therefore, Rivaroxaban Viatris 2.5 mg tablets are not 
recommended for use in children below 18 years of age. 
Method of administration  
Rivaroxaban Viatris is for oral use. 
The tablets can be taken with or without food (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Crushing of tablets 
For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Rivaroxaban Viatris tablets may be crushed and 
mixed with water or apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally.  
The crushed Rivaroxaban Viatris tablets may also be given through gastric tubes (see sections 5.2 and 
6.6). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Active clinically significant bleeding.  
Lesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current 
or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent 
brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, 
known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major 
intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities.  
Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low 
molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral 
anticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of 
switching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain 
an open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5).  
Concomitant treatment of ACS with antiplatelet therapy in patients with a prior stroke or a transient 
ischaemic attack (TIA) (see section 4.4).  
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concomitant treatment of CAD/PAD with ASA in patients with previous haemorrhagic or lacunar 
stroke, or any stroke within a month (see section 4.4). 
Hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic 
patients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2).  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
In ACS patients, efficacy and safety of Rivaroxaban Viatris 2.5 mg twice daily have been investigated 
in combination with the antiplatelet agents ASA alone or ASA plus clopidogrel/ticlopidine. In patients 
at high risk of ischaemic events with CAD/PAD, efficacy and safety of Rivaroxaban Viatris 2.5 mg 
twice daily have been investigated in combination with ASA. 
In patients after recent revascularisation procedure of the lower limb due to symptomatic PAD, 
efficacy and safety of Rivaroxaban Viatris 2.5 mg twice daily have been investigated in combination 
with the antiplatelet agent ASA alone or ASA plus short-term clopidogrel. If required, dual antiplatelet 
therapy with clopidogrel should be short-term; long-term dual antiplatelet therapy should be avoided 
(see section 5.1). 
Treatment in combination with other antiplatelet agents, e.g. prasugrel or ticagrelor, has not been 
studied and is not recommended. 
Clinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment 
period. 
Haemorrhagic risk  
As with other anticoagulants, patients taking Rivaroxaban Viatris are to be carefully observed for 
signs of bleeding. It is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of 
haemorrhage. Rivaroxaban Viatris administration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage 
occurs (see section 4.9).  
In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary 
including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently 
during long term rivaroxaban treatment on top of single or dual anti-platelet therapy. Thus, in addition 
to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to 
detect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be 
appropriate.  
Several sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. Therefore, the use 
of Rivaroxaban Viatris in combination with dual antiplatelet therapy in patients at known increased 
risk for bleeding should be balanced against the benefit in terms of prevention of atherothrombotic 
events. In addition these patients are to be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding 
complications and anaemia after initiation of treatment (see section 4.8).  
Any unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site.  
Although treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban 
levels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional 
situations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. 
overdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Renal impairment  
In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) rivaroxaban plasma levels 
may be significantly increased (1.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. 
Rivaroxaban Viatris is to be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 – 29 ml/min. 
Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 – 49 ml/min) concomitantly 
receiving other medicinal products which increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations Rivaroxaban 
Viatris is to be used with caution (see section 4.5). 
Interaction with other medicinal products  
The use of Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic 
treatment with azole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and 
posaconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors 
of both CYP3A4 and P-gp and therefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a 
clinically relevant degree (2.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk (see 
section 4.5). 
Care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis 
such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and 
platelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease 
an appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  
Patients treated with Rivaroxaban Viatris and antiplatelet agents should only receive concomitant 
treatment with NSAIDs if the benefit outweighs the bleeding risk. 
Other haemorrhagic risk factors  
As with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding 
risk such as:  
• 
• 
• 
congenital or acquired bleeding disorders  
uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension  
other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding 
complications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal 
reflux disease)  
vascular retinopathy  
bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding  
• 
• 
It should be used with caution in ACS and CAD/PAD patients:  
• 
≥ 75 years of age if co-administered with ASA alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine. 
The benefit-risk of the treatment should be individually assessed on a regular basis.  
•  with lower body weight (< 60 kg) if co-administered with ASA alone or with ASA plus 
clopidogrel or ticlopidine.  
•  CAD patients with severe symptomatic heart failure. Study data indicate that such patients may 
benefit less from treatment with rivaroxaban (see section 5.1).  
Patients with cancer 
Patients with malignant disease may simultaneously be at higher risk of bleeding and thrombosis. The 
individual benefit of antithrombotic treatment should be weighed against risk for bleeding in patients 
with active cancer dependent on tumour location, antineoplastic therapy and stage of disease. Tumours 
located in the gastrointestinal or genito urinary tract have been associated with an increased risk of 
bleeding during rivaroxaban therapy. 
In patients with malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, the use of rivaroxaban is contraindicated 
(see section 4.3). 
Patients with prosthetic valves  
Rivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone 
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris have not 
been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that 
Rivaroxaban Viatris provides adequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with 
Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended for these patients.  
Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome  
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Direct acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients 
with a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for 
patients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-
glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of 
recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.  
Patients with prior stroke and/or TIA  
Patients with ACS  
Rivaroxaban Viatris 2.5 mg is contraindicated for the treatment of ACS in patients with a prior stroke 
or TIA (see section 4.3). Few ACS patients with a prior stroke or TIA have been studied but the 
limited efficacy data available indicate that these patients do not benefit from treatment.  
Patients with CAD/PAD  
CAD/PAD patients with previous haemorrhagic or lacunar stroke, or an ischaemic, non-lacunar stroke 
with in the previous month were not studied (see section 4.3).  
Patients after recent revascularisation procedures of the lower limb due to symptomatic PAD with a 
previous stroke or TIA were not studied. Treatment with Rivaroxaban Viatris 2.5 mg should be 
avoided in these patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy. 
Spinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture   
When neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, 
patients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk 
of developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. 
The risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or 
the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by 
traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and 
symptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder 
dysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior 
to neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in 
anticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. There is no clinical 
experience with the use of Rivaroxaban Viatris 2.5 mg and antiplatelet agents in these situations. 
Platelet aggregation inhibitors should be discontinued as suggested by the manufacturer’s prescribing 
information. 
To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and 
neuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of 
rivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when 
the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low (see section 5.2). However, the exact 
timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known.  
Dosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention  
If an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Rivaroxaban Viatris 2.5 mg should be 
stopped at least 12 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the 
physician. If a patient is to undergo elective surgery and anti-platelet effect is not desired, platelet 
aggregation inhibitors should be discontinued as directed by the manufacturer’s prescribing 
information. If the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed 
against the urgency of the intervention.  
Rivaroxaban Viatris should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical 
intervention provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as 
determined by the treating physician (see section 5.2). 
Elderly population  
Increasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Dermatological reactions  
Serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS 
syndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of 
rivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
course of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of 
treatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. 
spreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal 
lesions.  
Information about excipients 
Rivaroxaban Viatris contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, 
total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors  
Co-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a 
day) led to a 2.6 fold / 2.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7 fold / 1.6 fold increase in 
mean rivaroxaban Cmax, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an 
increased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended in patients 
receiving concomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
voriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong 
inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4). 
Active substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either 
CYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. 
Clarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and 
moderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4 fold increase in 
Cmax. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be 
potentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4).  
Erythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a 1.3 
fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and Cmax. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not 
clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients.  
In subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8 fold 
increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in Cmax when compared to subjects with 
normal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0 fold 
increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in Cmax when compared to subjects with 
normal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see 
section 4.4).  
Fluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4 fold 
increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3 fold increase in mean Cmax. The interaction with 
fluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-
risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). 
Given the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should 
be avoided. 
Anticoagulants  
After combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single 
dose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on 
clotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban.  
Due to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any 
other anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
NSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors  
No clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of 
rivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more 
pronounced pharmacodynamic response.  
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when 
rivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid.  
Clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a 
pharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was 
observed in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or 
GPIIb/IIIa receptor levels.  
Care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) 
and platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding 
risk (see section 4.4). 
SSRIs/SNRIs  
As with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in 
case of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When 
concomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or non-
major clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. 
Warfarin  
Converting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or 
from rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) 
more than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, 
inhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive.  
If it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, anti-
factor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On the 
fourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa activity 
and ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban.  
If it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR 
measurement can be used at the Ctrough of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of 
rivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point.  
No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. 
CYP3A4 inducers  
Co-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate 
50% decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The 
concomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital or St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban 
plasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be 
avoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis.  
Other concomitant therapies  
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when 
rivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), 
atorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban 
neither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4.  
No clinically relevant interaction with food was observed (see section 4.2). 
Laboratory parameters  
Clotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, Hep test) are affected as expected by the mode of action of 
rivaroxaban (see section 5.1). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy  
Safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, 
the intrinsic risk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, Rivaroxaban 
Viatris is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3).  
Women of child-bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with rivaroxaban.  
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding  
Safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data 
from animals indicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore Rivaroxaban Viatris is 
contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to 
discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from therapy.  
Fertility  
No specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In 
a study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Rivaroxaban Viatris has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions 
like syncope (frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see 
section 4.8). Patients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
The safety of rivaroxaban has been evaluated in thirteen pivotal phase III studies (see Table 1).  
Overall, 69,608 adult patients in nineteen phase III studies and 488 paediatric patients in two phase II 
and two phase III studies were exposed to rivaroxaban.

A pre-specified selective approach to adverse event collection was applied in selected phase III 
studies. The incidence of adverse reactions did not increase and no new adverse drug reaction 
was identified after analysis of these studies. 
Description of selected adverse reactions  
Due to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of Rivaroxaban Viatris may be associated with an 
increased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post 
haemorrhagic anaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary 
according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 
“Management of bleeding”). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, 
gastrointestinal, genito urinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and 
anaemia were seen more frequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA 
treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of 
haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical 
relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in 
certain patient groups, e.g. those patients with uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on 
concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4 “Haemorrhagic risk”). Menstrual 
bleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. Haemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, 
paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some 
cases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of cardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris 
have been observed. 
Known complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure 
due to hypoperfusion, or anticoagulant-related nephropathy have been reported for Rivaroxaban 
Viatris. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to be considered in evaluating the condition in 
any anticoagulated patient.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Rare cases of overdose up to 1,960 mg have been reported. In case of overdose, the patient should be 
observed carefully for bleeding complications or other adverse reactions (see section “Management of 
bleeding”). Due to limited absorption a ceiling effect with no further increase in average plasma 
exposure is expected at supratherapeutic doses of 50 mg rivaroxaban or above.  
A specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is 
available (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of andexanet alfa).  
The use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered. 
Management of bleeding  
Should a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban 
administration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has 
a half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours (see section 5.2). Management should be individualised 
according to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate symptomatic treatment could 
be used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe epistaxis), surgical haemostasis 
with bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and haemodynamic support, blood products 
(packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on associated anaemia or coagulopathy) or 
platelets.  
If bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, either the administration of a specific factor 
Xa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet alfa), which antagonises the pharmacodynamic effect of 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rivaroxaban, or a specific procoagulant agent, such as prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), 
activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa), should be 
considered. However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of these 
medicinal products in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. The recommendation is also based on limited 
non-clinical data. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa shall be considered and titrated depending on 
improvement of bleeding. Depending on local availability, a consultation with a coagulation expert 
should be considered in case of major bleedings (see section 5.1).  
Protamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. 
There is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and 
aprotinin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor 
experience with the use of the systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving 
rivaroxaban. Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01 
Mechanism of action  
Rivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of 
factor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting 
both thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin 
(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Dose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is 
influenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations 
(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. 
The readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR is only calibrated and validated for 
coumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant.  
In a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult 
subjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC 
(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC 
reduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to 
reductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC 
had a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation 
than the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9).  
The activated partial thomboplastin time (aPTT) and Hep test are also prolonged dose-dependently; 
however, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no 
need for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical routine. 
However, if clinically indicated, rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated quantitative anti-
factor-Xa tests (see section 5.2). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
ACS  
The rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban for the 
prevention of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke in subjects with a recent 
ACS (ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI], non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction 
[NSTEMI] or unstable angina [UA]). In the pivotal double-blind ATLAS ACS 2 TIMI 51 study, 
15,526 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 fashion to one of three treatment groups: 
rivaroxaban 2.5 mg orally twice daily, 5 mg orally twice daily or to placebo twice daily co-
administered with ASA alone or with ASA plus a thienopyridine (clopidogrel or ticlopidine). Patients 
with an ACS under the age of 55 had to have either diabetes mellitus or a previous MI. The median 
time on treatment was 13 months and overall treatment duration was up to almost 3 years. 93.2% of 
patients received ASA concomitantly plus thienopyridine treatment and 6.8% ASA only. Among 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients receiving dual anti-platelets therapy 98.8% received clopidogrel, 0.9% received ticlopidine 
and 0.3% received prasugrel. Patients received the first dose of rivaroxaban at a minimum of 24 hours 
and up to 7 days (mean 4.7 days) after admission to the hospital, but as soon as possible after 
stabilisation of the ACS event, including revascularisation procedures and when parenteral 
anticoagulation therapy would normally be discontinued. 
Both the 2.5 mg twice daily and the 5 mg twice daily regimens of rivaroxaban were effective in further 
reducing the incidence of CV events on a background of standard antiplatelet care. The 2.5 mg twice 
daily regimen reduced mortality, and there is evidence that the lower dose had lower bleeding risks, 
therefore rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid alone or with ASA 
plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine is recommended for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult 
patients after an ACS with elevated cardiac biomarkers.  
Relative to placebo, rivaroxaban significantly reduced the primary composite endpoint of CV death, 
MI or stroke. The benefit was driven by a reduction in CV death and MI and appeared early with a 
constant treatment effect over the entire treatment period (see Table 4 and Figure 1). Also the first 
secondary endpoint (all-cause death, MI or stroke) was reduced significantly. An additional 
retrospective analysis showed a nominally significant reduction in the incidence rates of stent 
thrombosis compared with placebo (see Table 4). The incidence rates for the principal safety outcome 
(non-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) TIMI major bleeding events) were higher in patients 
treated with rivaroxaban than in patients who received placebo (see Table 6). However, the incidence 
rates were balanced between rivaroxaban and placebo for the components of fatal bleeding events, 
hypotension requiring treatment with intravenous inotropic agents and surgical intervention for 
ongoing bleeding. 
In Table 5 the efficacy results of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are 
presented. The safety results in this subgroup of patients undergoing PCI were comparable to the 
overall safety results.  
Patients with elevated biomarkers (troponin or CK-MB) and without a prior stroke/TIA constituted 
80% of the study population. The results of this patient population were also consistent with the 
overall efficacy and safety results.

CAD/PAD  
The phase III COMPASS study (27,395 patients, 78.0% male, 22.0% female) demonstrated the 
efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban for the prevention of a composite of CV death, MI, stroke in 
patients with CAD or symptomatic PAD at high risk of ischaemic events. Patients were followed for a 
median of 23 months and maximum of 3.9 years.  
Subjects without a continuous need for treatment with a proton pump inhibitor were randomised to 
pantoprazole or placebo. All patients were then randomised 1:1:1 to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice 
daily/ASA 100 mg once daily, to rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily, or ASA 100 mg once daily alone, and 
their matching placebos.  
CAD patients had multivessel CAD and/or prior MI. For patients < 65 years of age atherosclerosis 
involving at least two vascular beds or at least two additional cardiovascular risk factors were 
required.  
PAD patients had previous interventions such as bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal 
angioplasty or limb or foot amputation for arterial vascular disease or intermittent claudication with 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ankle/arm blood pressure ratio < 0.90 and/ or significant peripheral artery stenosis or previous carotid 
revascularisation or asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis ≥ 50%. 
Exclusion criteria included the need for dual antiplatelet or other non-ASA antiplatelet or oral 
anticoagulant therapy and patients with high bleeding risk, or heart failure with ejection fraction < 
30% or New York Heart Association class III or IV, or any ischaemic, non-lacunar stroke within 1 
month or any history of haemorrhagic or lacunar stroke.  
Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily in combination with ASA 100 mg once daily was superior to ASA 
100 mg, in the reduction of the primary composite outcome of CV death, MI, stroke (see Table 7 and 
Figure 2).  
There was a significant increase of the primary safety outcome (modified ISTH major bleeding events) 
in patients treated with rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily in combination with ASA 100 mg once daily 
compared to patients who received ASA 100 mg (see Table 8). 
For the primary efficacy outcome, the observed benefit of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus ASA 
100 mg once daily compared with ASA 100 mg once daily was HR=0.89 (95% CI 0.7-1.1) in patients 
≥75 years (incidence: 6.3% vs 7.0%) and HR=0.70 (95% CI 0.6-0.8) in patients <75 years (3.6% vs 
5.0%). For modified ISTH major bleeding, the observed risk increase was HR=2.12 (95% CI 1.5-3.0) 
in patients ≥75 years (5.2% vs 2.5%) and HR=1.53 (95% CI 1.2-1.9) in patients <75 years (2.6% vs 
1.7%).  
The use of pantoprazole 40 mg once daily in addition to antithrombotic study medication in patients 
with no clinical need for a proton pump inhibitor showed no benefit in the prevention of upper 
gastrointestinal events (i.e. composite of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, upper gastrointestinal 
ulceration, or upper gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation); the incidence rate of upper 
gastrointestinal events was 0.39/100 patient-years in the pantoprazole 40 mg once daily group and 
0.44/100 patient-years in the placebo once daily group.

Patients after recent revascularisation procedure of the lower limb due to symptomatic PAD 
In the pivotal phase III double-blind VOYAGER PAD trial, 6,564 patients after recent successful 
revascularisation procedure of the lower limb (surgical or endovascular including hybrid procedures) 
due to symptomatic PAD were randomly assigned to one of two antithrombotic treatment groups: 
rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily in combination with ASA 100 mg once daily, or to ASA 100 mg once 
daily, in a 1:1 fashion. Patients were allowed to additionally receive standard dose of clopidogrel once 
daily for up to 6 months. The objective of the study was to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of 
rivaroxaban plus ASA for the prevention of myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, CV death, acute 
limb ischaemia, or major amputation of a vascular etiology in patients after recent successful lower  
limb revascularisation procedures due to symptomatic PAD. Patients aged ≥ 50 years with 
documented moderate to severe symptomatic lower extremity atherosclerotic PAD evidenced by all of 
the following: clinically (i.e. functional limitations), anatomically (i.e. imaging evidence of PAD distal 
to external iliac artery) and haemodynamically (ankle-brachial-index [ABI] ≤ 0.80 or toe-brachial-
index [TBI] ≤ 0.60 for patients without a prior history of limb revascularisation or ABI ≤ 0.85 or TBI 
≤ 0.65 for patients with a prior history of limb revascularisation) were included. Patients in need of 
dual antiplatelet therapy for > 6 months, or any additional antiplatelet therapy other than ASA and 
clopidogrel, or oral anticoagulant therapy, as well as patients with a history of intracranial 
haemorrhage, stroke, or TIA, or patients with eGFR < 15 mL/min were excluded. 
The mean duration of follow-up was 24 months and the maximum follow-up was 4.1 years. The mean 
age of the enrolled patients was 67 years and 17% of the patient population were > 75 years. The 
median time from index revascularisation procedure to start of study treatment was 5 days in the 
overall population (6 days after surgical and 4 days after endovascular revascularisation including 
hybrid procedures). Overall, 53.0% of patients received short term background clopidogrel therapy 
with a median duration of 31 days. According to study protocol study treatment could be commenced 
as soon as possible but no later than 10 days after a successful qualifying revascularisation procedure 
and once haemostasis had been assured. 
Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily in combination with ASA 100 mg once daily was superior in the 
reduction of the primary composite outcome of myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, CV death, 
acute limb ischaemia and major amputation of vascular etiology compared to ASA alone (see Table 
21 
 
 
 
 
9). The primary safety outcome of TIMI major bleeding events was increased in patients treated with 
rivaroxaban and ASA, with no increase in fatal or intracranial bleeding (see Table 10). The secondary 
efficacy outcomes were tested in a prespecified, hierarchical order (see Table 9).

CAD with heart failure  
The COMMANDER HF study included 5,022 patients with heart failure and significant coronary 
artery disease (CAD) following a hospitalisation of decompensated heart failure (HF) which were 
randomly assigned into one of the two treatment groups: rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily (N=2,507) or 
matching placebo (N=2,515), respectively. The overall median study treatment duration was 504 days. 
Patients must have had symptomatic HF for at least 3 months and left ventricular ejection fraction 
(LVEF) of ≤40% within one year of enrolment. At baseline, the median ejection fraction was 34% 
(IQR: 28%-38%) and 53% of subjects were NYHA Class III or IV.  
The primary efficacy analysis (i.e. composite of all-cause mortality, MI, or stroke) showed no 
statistically significant difference between the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily group and the placebo 
group with a HR=0.94 (95% CI 0.84 - 1.05), p=0.270. For all-cause mortality, there was no difference 
between rivaroxaban and placebo in the number of events (event rate per 100 patient-years; 11.41 vs 
11.63, HR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.10; p=0.743). The event rates for MI per 100 patient-years 
(rivaroxaban vs placebo) were 2.08 vs 2.52 (HR 0.83; 95% CI: 0.63 to 1.08; p=0.165) and for stroke 
the event rates per 100 patient-years were 1.08 vs 1.62 (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.95; p=0.023). The 
principal safety outcome (i.e. composite of fatal bleeding or bleeding into a critical space with a 
potential for permanent disability), occurred in 18 (0.7%) patients in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice 
daily treatment group and in 23 (0.9%) patients in the placebo group, respectively (HR=0.80; 95% CI 
0.43 - 1.49; p=0.484). There was a statistically significant increase in ISTH major bleeding in the 
rivaroxaban group compared with placebo (event rate per 100 patient-years: 2.04 vs 1.21, HR 1.68; 
95% CI: 1.18 to 2.39; p=0.003).  
In patients with mild and moderate heart failure the treatment effects for the COMPASS study 
subgroup were similar to those of the entire study population (see section CAD/PAD). 
Patients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome  
In an investigator sponsored, randomised open-label multicentre study with blinded endpoint 
adjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, 
23 
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for all 
3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I 
antibodies). The study was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of 120 patients due to an excess 
of events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was 569 days. 59 patients were 
randomised to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <50 mL/min) 
and 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in 12% of patients randomised to 
rivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No events were reported in patients 
randomised to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) of the rivaroxaban group and 2 
patients (3%) of the warfarin group. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
rivaroxaban in all subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of thromboembolic events (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Rivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 2 - 4 hours after 
tablet intake.  
Oral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80 - 100%) for the 
2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions. Intake with food does not affect 
rivaroxaban AUC or Cmax at the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose. Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg and 10 mg tablets can be 
taken with or without food. 
Rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg once daily. At higher doses 
rivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased bioavailability and decreased 
absorption rate with increased dose. This is more marked in fasting state than in fed state. Variability 
in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual variability (CV%) ranging from 
30% to 40%.  
Absorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29% 
and 56% decrease in AUC and Cmax compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is 
released in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in 
the distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the 
stomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban 
exposure.  
Bioavailability (AUC and Cmax) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a 
crushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube 
followed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional 
pharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable 
to lower rivaroxaban doses. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding in humans is high at approximately 92% to 95%, with serum albumin being 
the main binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with Vss being approximately 
50 litres. 
Biotransformation and elimination 
Of the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, with half 
then being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 of the 
administered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, mainly 
via active renal secretion.  
Rivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative 
degradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of 
biotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter 
proteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein).  
Unchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active 
circulating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
classified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the 
elimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption 
rate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in 
young individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly. 
Special populations  
Gender  
There were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between 
male and female patients.  
Elderly population  
Elderly patients exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with mean AUC values 
being approximately 1.5 fold higher, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total and renal clearance. No 
dose adjustment is necessary.  
Different weight categories  
Extremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban plasma 
concentrations (less than 25%). No dose adjustment is necessary.  
Inter-ethnic differences  
No clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, 
Japanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics. 
Hepatic impairment  
Cirrhotic patients with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only minor 
changes in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics (1.2 fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), nearly 
comparable to their matched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (classified as Child Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by 2.3 
fold compared to healthy volunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6 fold. These patients also had 
reduced renal elimination of rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. There 
are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  
The inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor 
of 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a 
steeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT.  
Rivaroxaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and 
clinically relevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see 
section 4.3). 
Renal impairment  
There was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via 
creatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 50 – 80 ml/min), 
moderate (creatinine clearance 30 – 49 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15 – 29 ml/min) renal 
impairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 fold 
respectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced. In 
individuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of factor Xa 
activity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy volunteers; 
prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. There are no 
data in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min.  
Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable.  
Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. Rivaroxaban is to be used 
with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 – 29 ml/min (see section 4.4).  
Pharmacokinetic data in patients  
In patients receiving rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in 
patients with ACS the geometric mean concentration (90% prediction interval) 2 – 4 h and about 12 h 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
after dose (roughly representing maximum and minimum concentrations during the dose interval) was 
47 (13 - 123) and 9.2 (4.4 - 18) mcg/l, respectively. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship  
The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between rivaroxaban plasma 
concentration and several PD endpoints (factor-Xa inhibition, PT, aPTT, Heptest) has been evaluated 
after administration of a wide range of doses (5 – 30 mg twice a day). The relationship between 
rivaroxaban concentration and factor-Xa activity was best described by an Emax model. For PT, the 
linear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents 
used, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and 
the slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcg/l). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were 
consistent with the data established in healthy subjects.  
Paediatric population  
Safety and efficacy have not been established in the indications ACS and CAD/PAD for children and 
adolescents up to 18 years. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile 
toxicity. 
Effects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic 
activity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant 
exposure levels.  
In rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive 
toxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic 
complications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, 
hepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as 
placental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre- and post-
natal study in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams.

Crushing of tablets 
Rivaroxaban Viatris tablets may be crushed and suspended in 50 mL of water and administered via a 
nasogastric tube or gastric feeding tube after confirming gastric placement of the tube. Afterwards, the 
tube should be flushed with water. Since rivaroxaban absorption is dependent on the site of active 
substance release, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the stomach should be avoided, as this can 
result in reduced absorption and thereby, reduced active substance exposure. Enteral feeding is not 
required immediately after administration of the 2.5 mg tablets.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee 
replacement surgery.  
Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE in adults. (See section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients.) 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Prevention of VTE in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery  
The recommended dose is 10 mg rivaroxaban taken orally once daily. The initial dose should be taken 
6 to 10 hours after surgery, provided that haemostasis has been established.  
The duration of treatment depends on the individual risk of the patient for VTE which is determined 
by the type of orthopaedic surgery.  
• 
• 
For patients undergoing major hip surgery, a treatment duration of 5 weeks is recommended.  
For patients undergoing major knee surgery, a treatment duration of 2 weeks is recommended.  
If a dose is missed the patient should take Rivaroxaban Viatris immediately and then continue the 
following day with once daily intake as before. 
Treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE  
The recommended dose for the initial treatment of acute DVT or PE is 15 mg twice daily for the first 
three weeks followed by 20 mg once daily for the continued treatment and prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE.  
Short duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be considered in patients with DVT or PE 
provoked by major transient risk factors (i.e. recent major surgery or trauma). Longer duration of 
therapy should be considered in patients with provoked DVT or PE not related to major transient risk 
factors, unprovoked DVT or PE, or a history of recurrent DVT or PE.  
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When extended prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated (following completion of at least 
6 months therapy for DVT or PE), the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily. In patients in whom 
the risk of recurrent DVT or PE is considered high, such as those with complicated comorbidities, or 
who have developed recurrent DVT or PE on extended prevention with Rivaroxaban Viatris 10 mg 
once daily, a dose of Rivaroxaban Viatris 20 mg once daily should be considered.  
The duration of therapy and dose selection should be individualised after careful assessment of the 
treatment benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4).

To support the dose switch from 15 mg to 20 mg after Day 21 a first 4 weeks treatment initiation pack 
of Rivaroxaban Viatris for treatment of DVT/PE is available.  
If a dose is missed during the 15 mg twice daily treatment phase (day 1 - 21), the patient should take 
Rivaroxaban Viatris immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg Rivaroxaban Viatris per day. In this case 
two 15 mg tablets may be taken at once. The patient should continue with the regular 15 mg twice 
daily intake as recommended on the following day.  
If a dose is missed during the once daily treatment phase, the patient should take Rivaroxaban Viatris 
immediately, and continue on the following day with the once daily intake as recommended. The dose 
should not be doubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose.  
Converting from Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) to Rivaroxaban Viatris  
For patients treated for DVT, PE and prevention of recurrence, VKA treatment should be stopped and 
rivaroxaban therapy should be initiated once the INR is ≤ 2.5. 
When converting patients from VKAs to Rivaroxaban Viatris, International Normalised Ratio (INR) 
values will be falsely elevated after the intake of Rivaroxaban Viatris. The INR is not valid to measure 
the anticoagulant activity of Rivaroxaban Viatris, and therefore should not be used (see section 4.5).  
Converting from Rivaroxaban Viatris to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA)  
There is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from Rivaroxaban Viatris to 
VKA. Continuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate 
anticoagulant. It should be noted that Rivaroxaban Viatris can contribute to an elevated INR.  
In patients converting from Rivaroxaban Viatris to VKA, VKA should be given concurrently until the 
INR is ≥ 2.0. For the first two days of the conversion period, standard initial dosing of VKA should be 
used followed by VKA dosing, as guided by INR testing. While patients are on both Rivaroxaban 
Viatris and VKA the INR should not be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to 
the next dose of Rivaroxaban Viatris. Once Rivaroxaban Viatris is discontinued INR testing may be 
done reliably at least 24 hours after the last dose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Converting from parenteral anticoagulants to Rivaroxaban Viatris  
For patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, discontinue the parenteral anticoagulant 
and start Rivaroxaban Viatris 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of the 
parenteral medicinal product (e.g. low molecular weight heparins) would be due or at the time of 
discontinuation of a continuously administered parenteral medicinal product (e.g. intravenous 
unfractionated heparin).  
Converting from Rivaroxaban Viatris to parenteral anticoagulants  
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Give the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next Rivaroxaban Viatris dose would be 
taken.  
Special populations  
Renal impairment  
Limited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 – 29 ml/min) 
indicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased. Therefore, Rivaroxaban 
Viatris is to be used with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine 
clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  
-  
-  
For the prevention of VTE in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement 
surgery, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance 50 – 80 ml/min) or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30- 49 ml/min) 
(see section 5.2).  
For the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE, no dose 
adjustment from the recommended dose is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance 50 – 80 ml/min) (see section 5.2).  
In patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30 – 49 ml/min) or severe (creatinine clearance 
15 – 29 ml/min) renal impairment: patients should be treated with 15 mg twice daily for the first 
3 weeks. Thereafter, when the recommended dose is 20 mg once daily, a reduction of the dose 
from 20 mg once daily to 15 mg once daily should be considered if the patient’s assessed risk 
for bleeding outweighs the risk for recurrent DVT and PE. The recommendation for the use of 
15 mg is based on PK modelling and has not been studied in this clinical setting (see 
sections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).  
When the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily, no dose adjustment from the recommended 
dose is necessary.  
Hepatic impairment 
Rivaroxaban Viatris is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy 
and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see sections 
4.3 and 5.2).  
Elderly population  
No dose adjustment (see section 5.2)  
Body weight  
No dose adjustment (see section 5.2)  
Gender  
No dose adjustment (see section 5.2)  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris 10 mg tablets in children aged 0 to 18 years have not 
been established. No data are available. Therefore, Rivaroxaban Viatris 10 mg tablets are not 
recommended for use in children below 18 years of age. 
Method of administration  
Rivaroxaban Viatris is for oral use. 
The tablets can be taken with or without food (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Crushing of tablets 
For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Rivaroxaban Viatris tablets may be crushed and 
mixed with water or apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally.  
The crushed Rivaroxaban Viatris tablets may also be given through gastric tubes (see sections 5.2 and 
6.6).

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Active clinically significant bleeding.  
Lesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current 
or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent 
brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, 
known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major 
intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities.  
Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low 
molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral 
anticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of 
switching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain 
an open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5).  
Hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic 
patients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2).  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Clinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment 
period. 
Haemorrhagic risk  
As with other anticoagulants, patients taking Rivaroxaban Viatris are to be carefully observed for signs 
of bleeding. It is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of 
haemorrhage. Rivaroxaban Viatris administration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage 
occurs (see section 4.9).  
In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary 
including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently 
during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate 
clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult 
bleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate.  
Several sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. These patients are 
to be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications and anaemia after 
initiation of treatment (see section 4.8). In patients receiving Rivaroxaban Viatris for VTE prevention 
following elective hip or knee replacement surgery, this may be done by regular physical examination 
of the patients, close observation of the surgical wound drainage and periodic measurements of 
haemoglobin. Any unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should lead to a search for a 
bleeding site.  
Although treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban 
levels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional 
situations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. 
overdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Renal impairment  
In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) rivaroxaban plasma levels 
may be significantly increased (1.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rivaroxaban Viatris is to be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 – 29 ml/min. 
Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  
In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 – 49 ml/min) concomitantly 
receiving other medicinal products which increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations Rivaroxaban 
Viatris is to be used with caution (see section 4.5). 
Interaction with other medicinal products  
The use of Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic 
treatment with azole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and 
posaconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors 
of both CYP3A4 and P-gp and therefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a 
clinically relevant degree (2.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk (see 
section 4.5). 
Care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis 
such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicyclic acid (ASA) 
and platelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease 
an appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see section 4.5).  
Other haemorrhagic risk factors  
As with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding 
risk such as:  
• 
• 
• 
congenital or acquired bleeding disorders  
uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension  
other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding 
complications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal 
reflux disease)  
vascular retinopathy  
bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding  
• 
• 
Patients with cancer 
Patients with malignant disease may simultaneously be at higher risk of bleeding and thrombosis. The 
individual benefit of antithrombotic treatment should be weighed against risk for bleeding in patients 
with active cancer dependent on tumour location, antineoplastic therapy and stage of disease. Tumours 
located in the gastrointestinal or genito urinary tract have been associated with an increased risk of 
bleeding during rivaroxaban therapy. 
In patients with malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, the use of rivaroxaban is contraindicated 
(see section 4.3). 
Patients with prosthetic valves  
Rivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone 
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris have not 
been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that 
Rivaroxaban Viatris provides adequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with 
Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended for these patients.  
Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome  
Direct acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients 
with a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for 
patients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-
glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of 
recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.  
Hip fracture surgery  
Rivaroxaban has not been studied in interventional clinical studies in patients undergoing hip fracture 
surgery to evaluate efficacy and safety. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Haemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary 
embolectomy  
Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with 
pulmonary embolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary 
embolectomy since the safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris have not been established in these 
clinical situations.  
Spinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture   
When neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, 
patients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk 
of developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. 
The risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or 
the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by 
traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and 
symptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder 
dysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior 
to neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in 
anticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis.  
To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and 
neuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of 
rivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when 
the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low (see section 5.2).  
At least 18 hours should elapse after the last administration of rivaroxaban before removal of an 
epidural catheter. Following removal of the catheter, at least 6 hours should elapse before the next 
rivaroxaban dose is administered.  
If traumatic puncture occurs the administration of rivaroxaban is to be delayed for 24 hours. 
Dosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention other than 
elective hip or knee replacement surgery 
If an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Rivaroxaban Viatris 10 mg should be 
stopped at least 24 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the 
physician. If the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed against 
the urgency of the intervention.  
Rivaroxaban Viatris should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical 
intervention provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as 
determined by the treating physician (see section 5.2). 
Elderly population  
Increasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). 
Dermatological reactions  
Serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS 
syndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of 
rivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the 
course of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of 
treatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. 
spreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal 
lesions.  
Information about excipients 
Rivaroxaban Viatris contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, 
total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors  
Co-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a 
day) led to a 2.6 fold / 2.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7 fold / 1.6 fold increase in 
mean rivaroxaban Cmax, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an 
increased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended in patients 
receiving concomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
voriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong 
inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4). 
Active substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either 
CYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. 
Clarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and 
moderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4 fold increase in 
Cmax. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be 
potentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4).  
Erythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a 1.3 
fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and Cmax. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not 
clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients.  
In subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8 fold 
increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in Cmax when compared to subjects with 
normal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0 fold 
increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in Cmax when compared to subjects with 
normal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see 
section 4.4).  
Fluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4 fold 
increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3 fold increase in mean Cmax. The interaction with 
fluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-
risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). 
Given the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should 
be avoided. 
Anticoagulants  
After combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single 
dose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on 
clotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban.  
Due to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any 
other anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
NSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors  
No clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of 
rivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more 
pronounced pharmacodynamic response.  
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when 
rivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid.  
Clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a 
pharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was 
observed in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or 
GPIIb/IIIa receptor levels.  
Care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) 
and platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding 
risk (see section 4.4). 
SSRIs/SNRIs  
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in 
case of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When 
concomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or non-
major clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. 
Warfarin  
Converting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or 
from rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) 
more than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, 
inhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive.  
If it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, anti-
factor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On the 
fourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa activity 
and ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban.  
If it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR 
measurement can be used at the Ctrough of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of 
rivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point.  
No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. 
CYP3A4 inducers  
Co-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate 
50% decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The 
concomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital or St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban 
plasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be 
avoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis.  
Other concomitant therapies  
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when 
rivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), 
atorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban 
neither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4.  
No clinically relevant interaction with food was observed (see section 4.2). 
Laboratory parameters  
Clotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, Hep test) are affected as expected by the mode of action of 
rivaroxaban (see section 5.1). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy  
Safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, 
the intrinsic risk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, Rivaroxaban 
Viatris is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3).  
Women of child-bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with rivaroxaban.  
Breast-feeding  
Safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data 
from animals indicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore Rivaroxaban Viatris is 
contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to 
discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from therapy.  
Fertility  
No specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In 
a study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3).

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Rivaroxaban Viatris has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions 
like syncope (frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see 
section 4.8). Patients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
The safety of rivaroxaban has been evaluated in thirteen pivotal phase III studies (see Table 1). 
Overall, 69,608 adult patients in nineteen phase III studies and 488 paediatric patients in two phase II 
and two phase III studies were exposed to rivaroxaban.

From the VOYAGER PAD study 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients receiving rivaroxaban were bleedings (see 
section 4.4. and ‘Description of selected adverse reactions’ below) (Table 2). The most commonly 
reported bleedings were epistaxis (4.5%) and gastrointestinal tract haemorrhage (3.8%).

A pre-specified selective approach to adverse event collection was applied.in selected phase III 
studies. The incidence of adverse reactions did not increase and no new adverse drug reaction 
was identified after analysis of these studies. 
Description of selected adverse reactions  
Due to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of Rivaroxaban Viatris may be associated with an 
increased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post 
haemorrhagic anaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary 
according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“Management of bleeding”). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, 
gastrointestinal, genito urinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and 
anaemia were seen more frequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA 
treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of 
haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical 
relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in 
certain patient groups, e.g. those patients with uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on 
concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4 “Haemorrhagic risk”). Menstrual 
bleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. Haemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, 
paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some 
cases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of cardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris 
have been observed. 
Known complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure 
due to hypoperfusion, or anticoagulant-related nephropathy have been reported forRivaroxaban 
Viatris. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to be considered in evaluating the condition in any 
anticoagulated patient.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Rare cases of overdose up to 1,960 mg have been reported. In case of overdose, the patient should be 
observed carefully for  bleeding complications or other adverse reactions (see section “Management of 
bleeding”). Due to limited absorption a ceiling effect with no further increase in average plasma 
exposure is expected at supratherapeutic doses of 50 mg rivaroxaban or above.  
A specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is 
available (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of andexanet alfa).  
The use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered. 
Management of bleeding  
Should a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban 
administration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has 
a half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours (see section 5.2). Management should be individualised 
according to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate symptomatic treatment could 
be used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe epistaxis), surgical haemostasis 
with bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and haemodynamic support, blood products 
(packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on associated anaemia or coagulopathy) or 
platelets.  
If bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, either the administration of a specific factor 
Xa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet alfa), which antagonises the pharmacodynamic effect of 
rivaroxaban, or a specific procoagulant agent, such as prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), 
activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa), should be 
considered. However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of these 
medicinal products in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. The recommendation is also based on limited 
non-clinical data. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa shall be considered and titrated depending on 
improvement of bleeding. Depending on local availability, a consultation with a coagulation expert 
should be considered in case of major bleedings (see section 5.1).  
Protamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. 
There is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and 
aprotinin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor 
experience with the use of the systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving 
rivaroxaban. Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01  
Mechanism of action  
Rivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of 
factor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting 
both thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin 
(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated.   
Pharmacodynamic effects  
Dose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is 
influenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations 
(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. 
The readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR is only calibrated and validated for 
coumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant. In patients undergoing major orthopaedic 
surgery, the 5/95 percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 2 – 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the time of 
maximum effect) ranged from 13 to 25 s (baseline values before surgery 12 to 15 s).  
In a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult 
subjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC 
(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC 
reduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to 
reductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC 
had a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation 
than the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9).  
The activated partial thomboplastin time (aPTT) and Hep test are also prolonged dose-dependently; 
however, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no 
need for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical routine. 
However, if clinically indicated rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated quantitative anti-
factor Xa tests (see section 5.2).  
Clinical efficacy and safety  
Prevention of VTE in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery  
The rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban for the 
prevention of VTE, i.e. proximal and distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism 
(PE) in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery of the lower limbs. Over 9,500 patients (7,050 
in total hip replacement surgery and 2,531 in total knee replacement surgery) were studied in 
controlled randomised double-blind phase III clinical studies, the RECORD-programme.  
Rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily (od) started no sooner than 6 hours post-operatively was compared with 
enoxaparin 40 mg once daily started 12 hours pre-operatively.  
In all three phase III studies (see table 4), rivaroxaban significantly reduced the rate of total VTE (any 
venographically detected or symptomatic DVT, non-fatal PE and death) and major VTE (proximal 
DVT, non-fatal PE and VTE-related death), the pre-specified primary and major secondary efficacy 
endpoints. Furthermore, in all three studies the rate of symptomatic VTE (symptomatic DVT, non-
fatal PE, VTE-related death) was lower in rivaroxaban treated patients compared to patients treated 
with enoxaparin.  
The main safety endpoint, major bleeding, showed comparable rates for patients treated with 
rivaroxaban 10 mg compared to enoxaparin 40 mg.

The analysis of the pooled results of the phase III studies corroborated the data obtained in the 
individual studies regarding reduction of total VTE, major VTE and symptomatic VTE with 
rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily compared to enoxaparin 40 mg once daily.  
In addition to the phase III RECORD programme, a post-authorisation, non-interventional, open-label 
cohort study (XAMOS) has been conducted in 17,413 patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery 
of the hip or knee, to compare rivaroxaban with other pharmacological thromboprophylaxis (standard-
of-care) under real-life setting. Symptomatic VTE occurred in 57 (0.6%) patients in the rivaroxaban 
group (n=8,778) and 88 (1.0%) of patients in the standard-of-care group (n=8,635; HR 0.63; 95% 
CI0.43-0.91); safety population). Major bleeding occurred in 35 (0.4%) and 29 (0.3%) of patients in 
the rivaroxaban and standard-of-care groups (HR 1.10; 95% CI 0.67-1.80). Thus, the results were 
consistent with the results of the pivotal randomised studies.  
Treatment of DVT, PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE  
The rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban in the 
initial and continued treatment of acute DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence. 
Over 12,800 patients were studied in four randomised controlled phase III clinical studies (Einstein 
DVT, Einstein PE, Einstein Extension and Einstein Choice). and additionally a predefined pooled 
analysis of the Einstein DVT and Einstein PE studies was conducted. The overall combined treatment 
duration in all studies was up to 21 months. 
In Einstein DVT 3,449 patients with acute DVT were studied for the treatment of DVT and the 
prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (patients who presented with symptomatic PE were excluded 
from this study). The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical 
judgement of the investigator.  
For the initial 3 week treatment of acute DVT 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily. This 
was followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  
In Einstein PE, 4,832 patients with acute PE were studied for the treatment of PE and the prevention of 
recurrent DVT and PE. The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical 
judgement of the investigator.  
For the initial treatment of acute PE 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily for three weeks. 
This was followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  
In both the Einstein DVT and the Einstein PE study, the comparator treatment regimen consisted of 
enoxaparin administered for at least 5 days in combination with vitamin K antagonist treatment until 
the PT/INR was in therapeutic range (≥ 2.0). Treatment was continued with a vitamin K antagonist 
dose-adjusted to maintain the PT/INR values within the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0.  
In Einstein Extension 1,197 patients with DVT or PE were studied for the prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE. The treatment duration was for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
completed 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism depending on the clinical 
judgment of the investigator. Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily was compared with placebo.  
Einstein DVT, PE and Extension used the same pre-defined primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. 
The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent 
DVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. The secondary efficacy outcome was defined as the composite of 
recurrent DVT, non-fatal PE and all-cause mortality.  
In Einstein Choice, 3,396 patients with confirmed symptomatic DVT and/or PE who completed 6-12 
months of anticoagulant treatment were studied for the prevention of fatal PE or non-fatal 
symptomatic recurrent DVT or PE. Patients with an indication for continued therapeutic-dosed 
anticoagulation were excluded from the study. The treatment duration was up to 12 months depending 
on the individual randomisation date (median: 351 days). Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily and 
rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily were compared with 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid once daily.  
The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent 
DVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. 
In the Einstein DVT study (see Table 5) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to 
enoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p < 0.0001 (test for non-inferiority); Hazard Ratio 
(HR): 0.680 (0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 (test for superiority)). The prespecified net clinical benefit 
(primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding events) was reported with a HR of 0.67 ((95% CI: 
0.47 - 0.95), nominal p-value p=0.027) in favour of rivaroxaban. INR values were within the 
therapeutic range a mean of 60.3% of the time for the mean treatment duration of 189 days, and 
55.4%, 60.1%, and 62.8% of the time in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended treatment duration groups, 
respectively. In the enoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation between the level of mean 
centre TTR (Time in Target INR Range of 2.0 – 3.0) in the equally sized tertiles and the incidence of 
the recurrent VTE (P=0.932 for interaction). Within the highest tertile according to centre, the HR 
with rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.35 - 1.35).  
The incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding 
events) as well as the secondary safety outcome (major bleeding events) were similar for both 
treatment groups.

In the Einstein PE study (see Table 6) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to 
enoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p=0.0026 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 1.123 
(0.749 – 1.684)). The prespecified net clinical benefit (primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding 
events) was reported with a HR of 0.849 ((95% CI: 0.633 - 1.139), nominal p-value p=0.275). INR 
values were within the therapeutic range a mean of 63% of the time for the mean treatment duration of 
215 days, and 57%, 62%, and 65% of the time in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended treatment duration 
groups, respectively. In the enoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation between the level of 
mean centre TTR (Time in Target INR Range of 2.0 – 3.0) in the equally sized tertiles and the 
incidence of the recurrent VTE (p=0.082 for interaction). Within the highest tertile according to 
centre, the HR with rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.642 (95% CI: 0.277 - 1.484). 
The incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding 
events) were slightly lower in the rivaroxaban treatment group (10.3% (249/2412)) than in the 
enoxaparin/VKA treatment group (11.4% (274/2405)). The incidence of the secondary safety outcome 
(major bleeding events) was lower in the rivaroxaban group (1.1% (26/2412)) than in the 
enoxaparin/VKA group (2.2% (52/2405)) with a HR 0.493 (95% CI: 0.308 - 0.789).

In the Einstein Extension study (see Table 8) rivaroxaban was superior to placebo for the primary and 
secondary efficacy outcomes. For the primary safety outcome (major bleeding events) there was a 
non-significant numerically higher incidence rate for patients treated with rivaroxaban 20 mg once 
daily compared to placebo. The secondary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major 
bleeding events) showed higher rates for patients treated with rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily compared 
to placebo.

In addition to the phase III EINSTEIN programme, a prospective, non-interventional, open-label 
cohort study (XALIA) with central outcome adjudication including recurrent VTE, major bleeding and 
death has been conducted. 5,142 patients with acute DVT were enrolled to investigate the long-term 
safety of rivaroxaban compared with standard-of-care anticoagulation therapy in clinical practice. 
Rates of major bleeding, recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality for rivaroxaban were 0.7%, 1.4% and 
0.5%, respectively. There were differences in patient baseline characteristics including age, cancer and 
renal impairment. A pre-specified propensity score stratified analysis was used to adjust for measured 
baseline differences but residual confounding may, in spite of this, influence the results. Adjusted HRs 
comparing rivaroxaban and standard-of-care for major bleeding, recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality 
were 0.77 (95% CI 0.40 - 1.50), 0.91 (95% CI 0.54 - 1.54) and 0.51 (95% CI 0.24 - 1.07), respectively. 
These results in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this indication. 
Patients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome 
In an investigator sponsored, randomised open-label multicentre study with blinded endpoint 
adjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, 
diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for all 
3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I 
antibodies). The study was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of 120 patients due to an excess 
of events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was 569 days. 59 patients were 
randomised to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <50 mL/min) 
and 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in 12% of patients randomised to 
rivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No events were reported in patients 
randomised to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) of the rivaroxaban group and 2 
patients (3%) of the warfarin group. 
47 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
rivaroxaban in all subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of thromboembolic events (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Rivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 2 - 4 hours after 
tablet intake. 
Oral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80 - 100%) for the 
2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions. Intake with food does not affect 
rivaroxaban AUC or Cmax at the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose. Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg and 10 mg tablets can be 
taken with or without food. Rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg 
once daily. At higher doses rivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased 
bioavailability and decreased absorption rate with increased dose. This is more marked in fasting state 
than in fed state. Variability in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual 
variability (CV%) ranging from 30% to 40%, apart from on the day of surgery and the following day 
when variability in exposure is high (70%). 
Absorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29% 
and 56% decrease in AUC and Cmax compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is 
released in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in 
the distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the 
stomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban 
exposure. 
Bioavailability (AUC and Cmax) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a 
crushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube 
followed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional 
pharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable 
to lower rivaroxaban doses. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding in humans is high at approximately 92% to 95%, with serum albumin being 
the main binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with Vss being approximately 
50 litres. 
Biotransformation and elimination 
Of the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, with half 
then being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 of the 
administered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, mainly 
via active renal secretion. 
Rivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative 
degradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of 
biotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter 
proteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein). 
Unchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active 
circulating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be 
classified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the 
elimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption 
rate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in 
young individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly. 
Special populations 
Gender 
There were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between 
male and female patients. 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly population 
Elderly patients exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with mean AUC values 
being approximately 1.5 fold higher, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total and renal clearance. No 
dose adjustment is necessary. 
Different weight categories 
Extremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban plasma 
concentrations (less than 25%). No dose adjustment is necessary. 
Inter-ethnic differences 
No clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, 
Japanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics. 
Hepatic impairment 
Cirrhotic patients with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only minor 
changes in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics (1.2 fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), nearly 
comparable to their matched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (classified as Child Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by 2.3 
fold compared to healthy volunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6 fold. These patients also had 
reduced renal elimination of rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. There 
are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
The inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor 
of 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a 
steeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT. 
Rivaroxaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and 
clinically relevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 
4.3). 
Renal impairment  
There was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via 
creatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 50 – 80 ml/min), 
moderate (creatinine clearance 30 – 49 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15 – 29 ml/min) renal 
impairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 fold 
respectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced. In 
individuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of factor Xa 
activity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy volunteers; 
prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. There are no 
data in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min.  
Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable.  
Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. Rivaroxaban Viatris is to 
be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 – 29 ml/min (see section 4.4). 
Pharmacokinetic data in patients  
In patients receiving rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily for prevention of VTE the geometric mean 
concentration (90% prediction interval) 2 - 4 h and about 24 h after dose (roughly representing 
maximum and minimum concentrations during the dose interval) was 101 (7 - 273) and 14 
(4 - 51) mcg/l, respectively. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship  
The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between rivaroxaban plasma 
concentration and several PD endpoints (factor Xa inhibition, PT, aPTT, Heptest) has been evaluated 
after administration of a wide range of doses (5 – 30 mg twice a day). The relationship between 
rivaroxaban concentration and factor Xa activity was best described by an Emax model. For PT, the 
linear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
used, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and 
the slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcg/l). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were 
consistent with the data established in healthy subjects. In patients, baseline factor Xa and PT were 
influenced by the surgery resulting in a difference in the concentration-PT slope between the day post-
surgery and steady state.  
Paediatric population  
Safety and efficacy have not been established in the indication primary prevention of VTE for children 
and adolescents up to 18 years. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile 
toxicity.  
Effects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic 
activity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant 
exposure levels.  
In rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive 
toxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic 
complications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, 
hepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as 
placental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre- and post-
natal study in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams.

Crushing of tablets 
Rivaroxaban Viatris tablets may be crushed and suspended in 50 mL of water and administered via a 
nasogastric tube or gastric feeding tube after confirming gastric placement of the tube. Afterwards, the 
tube should be flushed with water. Since rivaroxaban absorption is dependent on the site of active 
substance release, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the stomach should be avoided, as this can 
result in reduced absorption and thereby, reduced active substance exposure. Enteral feeding is not 
required immediately after administration of the 10 mg tablets.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Adults 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation with 
one or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes 
mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack. 
Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE in adults. (See section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients.) 
Paediatric population 
Treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and prevention of VTE recurrence in children and 
adolescents aged less than 18 years and weighing from 30 kg to 50 kg after at least 5 days of initial 
parenteral anticoagulation treatment.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adults 
The recommended dose is 20 mg once daily, which is also the recommended maximum dose.  
Therapy with Rivaroxaban Viatris should be continued long term provided the benefit of prevention of 
stroke and systemic embolism outweighs the risk of bleeding (see section 4.4).  
If a dose is missed the patient should take Rivaroxaban Viatris immediately and continue on the 
following day with the once daily intake as recommended. The dose should not be doubled within the 
same day to make up for a missed dose.

The recommended dose for the initial treatment of acute DVT or PE is 15 mg twice daily for the first 
three weeks followed by 20 mg once daily for the continued treatment and prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE. 
Short duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be considered in patients with DVT or PE 
provoked by major transient risk factors (i.e. recent major surgery or trauma). Longer duration of 
therapy should be considered in patients with provoked DVT or PE not related to major transient risk 
factors, unprovoked DVT or PE, or a history of recurrent DVT or PE.  
When extended prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated (following completion of at least 6 
months therapy for DVT or PE), the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily. In patients in whom the 
risk of recurrent DVT or PE is considered high, such as those with complicated comorbidities, or who 
have developed recurrent DVT or PE on extended prevention with Rivaroxaban Viatris 10 mg once 
daily, a dose of Rivaroxaban Viatris 20 mg once daily should be considered.  
The duration of therapy and dose selection should be individualised after careful assessment of the 
treatment benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4).

To support the dose switch from 15 mg to 20 mg after Day 21 a first 4 weeks treatment initiation pack 
of Rivaroxaban Viatris for treatment of DVT/PE is available.  
If a dose is missed during the 15 mg twice daily treatment phase (day 1 - 21), the patient should take 
Rivaroxaban Viatris immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg Rivaroxaban Viatris per day. In this case 
two 15 mg tablets may be taken at once. The patient should continue with the regular 15 mg twice 
daily intake as recommended on the following day.  
If a dose is missed during the once daily treatment phase, the patient should take Rivaroxaban Viatris 
immediately, and continue on the following day with the once daily intake as recommended. The dose 
should not be doubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose.  
Treatment of VTE and prevention of VTE recurrence in children and adolescents  
Rivaroxaban Viatris treatment in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years should be initiated 
following at least 5 days of initial parenteral anticoagulation treatment (see section 5.1). 
The dose for children and adolescent is calculated based on body weight. 
- 
Body weight from 30 to 50 kg: 
a once daily dose of 15 mg rivaroxaban is recommended. This is the maximum daily dose. 
Body weight of 50 kg or more: 
a once daily dose of 20 mg rivaroxaban is recommended. This is the maximum daily dose. 
For patients with body weight less 30 kg refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of 
more suitable forms of rivaroxaban. 
- 
- 
The weight of a child should be monitored and the dose reviewed regularly. This is to ensure a 
therapeutic dose is maintained. Dose adjustments should be made based on changes in body weight 
only.  
Treatment should be continued for at least 3 months in children and adolescents. Treatment can be 
extended up to 12 months when clinically necessary. There is no data available in children to support a 
dose reduction after 6 months treatment. The benefit-risk of continued therapy after 3 months should 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be assessed on an individual basis taking into account the risk for recurrent thrombosis versus the 
potential bleeding risk. 
If a dose is missed, the missed dose should be taken as soon as possible after it is noticed, but only on 
the same day. If this is not possible, the patient should skip the dose and continue with the next dose as 
prescribed. The patient should not take two doses to make up for a missed dose. 
Converting from Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) to Rivaroxaban Viatris  
- 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism: 
VKA treatment should be stopped and Rivaroxaban Viatris therapy should be initiated when the 
International Normalised Ratio (INR) is ≤ 3.0. 
Treatment of DVT, PE and prevention of recurrence in adults and treatment of VTE and 
- 
prevention of recurrence in paediatric patients: 
VKA treatment should be stopped and rivaroxaban therapy should be initiated once the INR is 
≤ 2.5. 
When converting patients from VKAs to Rivaroxaban Viatris, INR values will be falsely elevated after 
the intake of Rivaroxaban Viatris. The INR is not valid to measure the anticoagulant activity of 
Rivaroxaban Viatris, and therefore should not be used (see section 4.5).  
Converting from Rivaroxaban Viatris to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA)  
There is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from Rivaroxaban Viatris to 
VKA. Continuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate 
anticoagulant. It should be noted that Rivaroxaban Viatris can contribute to an elevated INR.  
In patients converting from Rivaroxaban Viatris to VKA, VKA should be given concurrently until the 
INR is ≥ 2.0. For the first two days of the conversion period, standard initial dosing of VKA should be 
used followed by VKA dosing, as guided by INR testing. While patients are on both Rivaroxaban 
Viatris and VKA the INR should not be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to 
the next dose of Rivaroxaban Viatris. Once Rivaroxaban Viatris is discontinued INR testing may be 
done reliably at least 24 hours after the last dose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Paediatric patients: 
Children who convert from Rivaroxaban Viatris to VKA need to continue Rivaroxaban Viatris for 
48 hours after the first dose of VKA. After 2 days of co-administration an INR should be obtained 
prior to the next scheduled dose of Rivaroxaban Viatris. Co-administration of Rivaroxaban Viatris and 
VKA is advised to continue until the INR is ≥ 2.0. Once Rivaroxaban Viatris is discontinued INR 
testing may be done reliably 24 hours after the last dose (see above and section 4.5).  
Converting from parenteral anticoagulants to Rivaroxaban Viatris  
For adult and paediatric patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, discontinue the 
parenteral anticoagulant and start Rivaroxaban Viatris 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next 
scheduled administration of the parenteral medicinal product (e.g. low molecular weight heparins) 
would be due or at the time of discontinuation of a continuously administered parenteral medicinal 
product (e.g. intravenous unfractionated heparin).  
Converting from Rivaroxaban Viatris to parenteral anticoagulants  
Discontinue Rivaroxaban Viatris and give the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next 
Rivaroxaban Viatris dose would be taken.  
Special populations  
Renal impairment  
Adults:  
Limited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 – 29 ml/min) 
indicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased. Therefore, Rivaroxaban 
Viatris is to be used with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine 
clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  
55 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30 – 49 ml/min) or severe (creatinine clearance 
15-29 ml/min) renal impairment the following dose recommendations apply:  
-  
-  
For the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial 
fibrillation, the recommended dose is 15 mg once daily (see section 5.2).  
For the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE: patients 
should be treated with 15 mg twice daily for the first 3 weeks. Thereafter, when the 
recommended dose is 20 mg once daily, a reduction of the dose from 20 mg once daily to 15 mg 
once daily should be considered if the patient’s assessed risk for bleeding outweighs the risk for 
recurrent DVT and PE. The recommendation for the use of 15 mg is based on PK modelling and 
has not been studied in this clinical setting (see sections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).  
When the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily, no dose adjustment from the recommended 
dose is necessary.  
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
50-80 ml/min) (see section 5.2).  
Paediatric population: 
- 
Children and adolescents with mild renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate 
50 - 80 mL/min/1.73 m2): no dose adjustment is required, based on data in adults and limited 
data in paediatric patients (see section 5.2).  
Children and adolescents with moderate or severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate 
< 50 mL/min/1.73 m2): Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended as no clinical data is 
available (see section 4.4).  
- 
Hepatic impairment  
Rivaroxaban Viatris is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy 
and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see sections 
4.3 and 5.2). No clinical data is available in children with hepatic impairment. 
Elderly population  
No dose adjustment (see section 5.2)  
Body weight  
No dose adjustment for adults (see section 5.2)  
For paediatric patients the dose is determined based on body weight. 
Gender  
No dose adjustment (see section 5.2)  
Rivaroxaban Viatris  
Patients undergoing cardioversion  
Rivaroxaban Viatris can be initiated or continued in patients who may require cardioversion. For 
transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) guided cardioversion in patients not previously treated with 
anticoagulants, Rivaroxaban Viatris treatment should be started at least 4 hours before cardioversion to 
ensure adequate anticoagulation (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). For all patients, confirmation should be 
sought prior to cardioversion that the patient has taken Rivaroxaban Viatris as prescribed. Decisions 
on initiation and duration of treatment should take established guideline recommendations for 
anticoagulant treatment in patients undergoing cardioversion into account.  
Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) 
with stent placement  
There is limited experience of a reduced dose of 15 mg Rivaroxaban Viatris once daily (or 10 mg 
Rivaroxaban Viatris once daily for patients with moderate renal impairment [creatinine clearance 
30-49 ml/min]) in addition to a P2Y12 inhibitor for a maximum of 12 months in patients with non-
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
valvular atrial fibrillation who require oral anticoagulation and undergo PCI with stent placement 
(see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  
Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris in children aged 0 to < 18 years have not been 
established in the indication prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular 
atrial fibrillation. No data are available. Therefore, it is not recommended for use in children below 
18 years of age in indications other than the treatment of VTE and prevention of VTE recurrence. 
Method of administration  
Adults 
Rivaroxaban Viatris is for oral use. 
The tablets are to be taken with food (see section 5.2). 
Crushing of tablets 
For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Rivaroxaban Viatris tablets may be crushed and 
mixed with water or apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally. After the 
administration of crushed Rivaroxaban Viatris 15 mg or 20 mg film-coated tablets, the dose should be 
immediately followed by food. 
The crushed Rivaroxaban Viatris tablets may also be given through gastric tubes (see sections 5.2 and 
6.6).  
Children and adolescents weighing 30 kg to 50 kg 
Rivaroxaban Viatris is for oral use. 
The patient should be advised to swallow the tablet with liquid. It should also be taken with food 
(see section 5.2). The tablets should be taken approximately 24 hours apart.  
In case the patient immediately spits up the dose or vomits within 30 minutes after receiving the 
dose, a new dose should be given. However, if the patient vomits more than 30 minutes after the 
dose, the dose should not be re-administered and the next dose should be taken as scheduled.  
The tablet must not be split in an attempt to provide a fraction of a tablet dose. 
Crushing of tablets 
For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, other pharmaceutical forms such as granules 
for oral suspension should be used. 
If the oral suspension is not immediately available, when doses of 15 mg or 20 mg rivaroxaban are 
prescribed, these could be provided by crushing the 15 mg or 20 mg tablet and mixing it with water 
or apple puree immediately prior to use and administering orally.  
The crushed tablet may be given through a nasogastric or gastric feeding tube (see sections 5.2 
and 6.6). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Active clinically significant bleeding.  
Lesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current 
or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent 
brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, 
known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major 
intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities.  
Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low 
molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral 
anticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
switching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain 
an open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5).  
Hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic 
patients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2).  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Clinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment 
period. 
Haemorrhagic risk  
As with other anticoagulants, patients taking Rivaroxaban Viatris are to be carefully observed for signs 
of bleeding. It is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of 
haemorrhage. Rivaroxaban Viatris administration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage 
occurs (see section 4.9).  
In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary 
including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently 
during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate 
clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult 
bleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate.  
Several sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. These patients are 
to be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications and anaemia after 
initiation of treatment (see section 4.8). Any unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should 
lead to a search for a bleeding site.  
Although treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban 
levels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional 
situations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. 
overdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population  
There is limited data in children with cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis who have a CNS infection 
(see section 5.1). The risk of bleeding should be carefully evaluated before and during therapy with 
rivaroxaban.  
Renal impairment  
In adult patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) rivaroxaban plasma 
levels may be significantly increased (1.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding 
risk. Rivaroxaban Viatris is to be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 – 
29 ml/min. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.2 
and 5.2).  
Rivaroxaban Viatris should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment concomitantly 
receiving other medicinal products which increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (see 
section 4.5). 
Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended in children and adolescents with moderate or severe renal 
impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2), as no clinical data is available. 
Interaction with other medicinal products  
The use of Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic 
treatment with azole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and 
posaconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors 
of both CYP3A4 and P-gp and therefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clinically relevant degree (2.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk No 
clinical data is available in children receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inhibitors of 
both CYP 3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.5). 
Care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis 
such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and 
platelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease 
an appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see section 4.5).  
Other haemorrhagic risk factors  
As with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding 
risk such as:  
• 
• 
• 
congenital or acquired bleeding disorders  
uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension  
other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding 
complications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal 
reflux disease)  
vascular retinopathy  
bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding  
• 
• 
Patients with cancer 
Patients with malignant disease may simultaneously be at higher risk of bleeding and thrombosis. The 
individual benefit of antithrombotic treatment should be weighed against risk for bleeding in patients 
with active cancer dependent on tumour location, antineoplastic therapy and stage of disease. Tumours 
located in the gastrointestinal or genito urinary tract have been associated with an increased risk of 
bleeding during rivaroxaban therapy. 
In patients with malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, the use of rivaroxaban is contraindicated 
(see section 4.3). 
Patients with prosthetic valves  
Rivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone 
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris have not 
been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that 
Rivaroxaban Viatris provides adequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with 
Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended for these patients.  
Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome  
Direct acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients 
with a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for 
patients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-
glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of 
recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.  
Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement  
Clinical data are available from an interventional study with the primary objective to assess safety in 
patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement. Data on efficacy 
in this population are limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). No data are available for such patients with a 
history of stroke/transient ischaemic attack. 
Haemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary 
embolectomy  
Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with 
pulmonary embolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary 
embolectomy since the safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris have not been established in these 
clinical situations.  
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Spinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture   
When neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, 
patients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk 
of developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. 
The risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or 
the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by 
traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and 
symptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder 
dysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior 
to neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in 
anticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. There is no clinical 
experience with the use of 15 mg rivaroxaban in these situations.  
To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and 
neuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of 
rivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when 
the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low. However, the exact timing to reach a 
sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known and should be weighed against the 
urgency of a diagnostic procedure.  
For the removal of an epidural catheter and based on the general PK characteristics at least 2× half-
life, i.e. at least 18 hours in young adult patients and 26 hours in elderly patients should elapse after 
the last administration of rivaroxaban (see section 5.2). Following removal of the catheter, at least 
6 hours should elapse before the next rivaroxaban dose is administered.  
If traumatic puncture occurs the administration of rivaroxaban is to be delayed for 24 hours. 
No data is available on the timing of the placement or removal of neuraxial catheter in children while 
on Rivaroxaban Viatris. In such cases, discontinue rivaroxaban and consider a short acting parenteral 
anticoagulant. 
Dosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention  
If an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Rivaroxaban Viatris 15 mg should be 
stopped at least 24 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the 
physician. If the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed against 
the urgency of the intervention.  
Rivaroxaban Viatris should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical 
intervention provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as 
determined by the treating physician (see section 5.2). 
Elderly population  
Increasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). 
Dermatological reactions  
Serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS 
syndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of 
rivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the 
course of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of 
treatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. 
spreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal 
lesions.  
Information about excipients 
Rivaroxaban Viatris contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, 
total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The extent of interactions in the paediatric population is not known. The below mentioned interaction 
data was obtained in adults and the warnings in section 4.4 should be taken into account for the 
paediatric population. 
CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors  
Co-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a 
day) led to a 2.6 fold / 2.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7 fold / 1.6 fold increase in 
mean rivaroxaban Cmax, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an 
increased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended in patients 
receiving concomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
voriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong 
inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4). 
Active substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either 
CYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. 
Clarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and 
moderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4 fold increase in 
Cmax. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be 
potentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4)  
Erythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a 1.3 
fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and Cmax. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not 
clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients.  
In subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8 fold 
increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in Cmax when compared to subjects with 
normal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0 fold 
increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in Cmax when compared to subjects with 
normal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see 
section 4.4).  
Fluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4 fold 
increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3 fold increase in mean Cmax. The interaction with 
fluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-
risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). 
Given the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should 
be avoided. 
Anticoagulants  
After combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single 
dose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on 
clotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban.  
Due to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any 
other anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
NSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors  
No clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of 
rivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more 
pronounced pharmacodynamic response.  
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when 
rivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid.  
Clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a 
pharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was 
observed in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or 
GPIIb/IIIa receptor levels.  
61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) 
and platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding 
risk (see section 4.4). 
SSRIs/SNRIs  
As with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in 
case of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When 
concomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or non-
major clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. 
Warfarin  
Converting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or 
from rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) 
more than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, 
inhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive.  
If it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, anti-
factor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On the 
fourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa activity 
and ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban.  
If it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR 
measurement can be used at the Ctrough of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of 
rivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point.  
No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. 
CYP3A4 inducers  
Co-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate 
50% decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The 
concomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital or St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban 
plasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be 
avoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis.  
Other concomitant therapies  
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when 
rivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), 
atorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban 
neither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4.  
Laboratory parameters  
Clotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, Hep test) are affected as expected by the mode of action of 
rivaroxaban (see section 5.1). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy  
Safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, 
the intrinsic risk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, Rivaroxaban 
Viatris is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3).  
Women of child-bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with rivaroxaban.  
Breast-feeding  
Safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data 
from animals indicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore Rivaroxaban Viatris is 
contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to 
discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from therapy.  
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility  
No specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In 
a study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Rivaroxaban Viatris has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions 
like syncope (frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see 
section 4.8). Patients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
The safety of rivaroxaban has been evaluated in thirteen pivotal phase III studies (see Table 1). 
Overall, 69,608 adult patients in nineteen phase III studies and 488 paediatric patients in two phase II 
and two phase III studies were exposed to rivaroxaban.

A pre-specified selective approach to adverse event collection was applied in selected phase III 
studies. The incidence of adverse reactions did not increase and no new adverse drug reaction 
was identified after analysis of these studies. 
Description of selected adverse reactions  
Due to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of Rivaroxaban Viatris may be associated with an 
increased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post 
haemorrhagic anaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary 
according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 
“Management of bleeding”). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, 
gastrointestinal, genito urinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and 
anaemia were seen more frequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA 
treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of 
haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical 
relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in 
certain patient groups, e.g. those patients with uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on 
concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4 “Haemorrhagic risk”). Menstrual 
bleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. Haemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, 
paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some 
cases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of cardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris 
have been observed. 
Known complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure 
due to hypoperfusion, or anticoagulant-related nephropathy have been reported for Rivaroxaban 
Viatris. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to be considered in evaluating the condition in any 
anticoagulated patient.  
Paediatric population   
Treatment of VTE and prevention of VTE recurrence 
The safety assessment in children and adolescents is based on the safety data from two phase II and 
one phase III open-label active controlled studies in paediatric patients aged birth to less than 18 years. 
The safety findings were generally similar between rivaroxaban and comparator in the various 
paediatric age groups. Overall, the safety profile in the 412 children and adolescents treated with 
rivaroxaban was similar to that observed in the adult population and consistent across age subgroups, 
although assessment is limited by the small number of patients.  
In paediatric patients, headache (very common, 16.7%), fever (very common, 11.7%), epistaxis (very 
common, 11.2%), vomiting (very common, 10.7%), tachycardia (common, 1.5%), increase in bilirubin 
(common, 1.5%) and bilirubin conjugated increased (uncommon, 0.7%) were reported more frequently 
as compared to adults. Consistent with adult population, menorrhagia was observed in 6.6% (common) 
of female adolescents after menarche. Thrombocytopenia as observed in the post-marketing 
experience in adult population was common (4.6%) in paediatric clinical studies. The adverse drug 
reactions in paediatric patients were primarily mild to moderate in severity.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In adults, rare cases of overdose up to 1,960 mg have been reported. In case of overdose, the patient 
should be observed carefully for bleeding complications or other adverse reactions (see section 
“Management of bleeding”). There is limited data available in children. Due to limited absorption a 
ceiling effect with no further increase in average plasma exposure is expected at supratherapeutic 
doses of 50 mg rivaroxaban or above in adults, however, no data is available at supratherapeutic doses 
in children. 
67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is 
available for adults, but not established in children (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of 
andexanet alfa).  
The use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered. 
Management of bleeding  
Should a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban 
administration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has 
a half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours in adults. The half life in children estimated using population 
pharmacokinetic (popPK) modelling approaches is shorter (see section 5.2). Management should be 
individualised according to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate symptomatic 
treatment could be used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe epistaxis), surgical 
haemostasis with bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and haemodynamic support, blood 
products (packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on associated anaemia or coagulopathy) 
or platelets.  
If bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, either the administration of a specific factor 
Xa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet alfa), which antagonises the pharmacodynamic effect of 
rivaroxaban, or a specific procoagulant agent, such as prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), 
activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa), should be 
considered. However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of these 
medicinal products in adults and in children  receiving rivaroxaban. The recommendation is also based 
on limited non-clinical data. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa shall be considered and titrated 
depending on improvement of bleeding. Depending on local availability, a consultation with a 
coagulation expert should be considered in case of major bleedings (see section 5.1).  
Protamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. 
There is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and 
aprotinin in adults receiving rivaroxaban. There is no experience on the use of these agents in children 
receiving rivaroxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor experience with the use of 
the systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. Due to the high plasma 
protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01  
Mechanism of action  
Rivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of 
factor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting 
both thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin 
(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. 
Pharmacodynamic effects  
Dose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is 
influenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations 
(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. 
The readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR is only calibrated and validated for 
coumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant.  
In patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence, the 5/95 
percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 2 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the time of maximum effect) for 
15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily ranged from 17 to 32 s and for 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily from 15 
to 30 s. At trough (8 - 16 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles for 15 mg twice daily ranged from 
14 to 24 s and for 20 mg once daily (18 - 30 h after tablet intake) from 13 to 20 s.  
68 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
In patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation receiving rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and 
systemic embolism, the 5/95 percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 1 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the 
time of maximum effect) in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged from 14 to 40 s and in 
patients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 10 to 50 s. At trough (16 
- 36 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged from 12 
to 26 s and in patients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 12 to 26 s.  
In a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult 
subjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC 
(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC 
reduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to 
reductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC 
had a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation 
than the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9).  
The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and Hep test are also prolonged dose-dependently; 
however, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no 
need for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical routine. 
However, if clinically indicated rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated quantitative anti-
factor Xa tests (see section 5.2).  
Paediatric population  
PT (neoplastin reagent), aPTT, and anti-Xa assay (with a calibrated quantitative test) display a close 
correlation to plasma concentrations in children. The correlation between anti-Xa to plasma 
concentrations is linear with a slope close to 1. Individual discrepancies with higher or lower anti-Xa 
values as compared to the corresponding plasma concentrations may occur. There is no need for 
routine monitoring of coagulation parameters during clinical treatment with rivaroxaban. However, if 
clinically indicated, rivaroxaban concentrations can be measured by calibrated quantitative antiFactor 
Xa tests in mcg/L (see table 13 in section 5.2 for ranges of observed rivaroxaban plasma 
concentrations in children). The lower limit of quantifications must be considered when the anti-Xa 
test is used to quantify plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban in children. No threshold for efficacy or 
safety events has been established.  
Clinical efficacy and safety  
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation   
The rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban for the 
prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.  
In the pivotal double-blind ROCKET AF study, 14,264 patients were assigned either to rivaroxaban 
20 mg once daily (15 mg once daily in patients with creatinine clearance 30 – 49 ml/min) or to 
warfarin titrated to a target INR of 2.5 (therapeutic range 2.0 to 3.0). The median time on treatment 
was 19 months and overall treatment duration was up to 41 months.  
34.9% of patients were treated with acetylsalicylic acid and 11.4% were treated with class III 
antiarrhythmic including amiodarone.  
Rivaroxaban was non-inferior to warfarin for the primary composite endpoint of stroke and non-CNS 
systemic embolism. In the per-protocol population on treatment, stroke or systemic embolism occurred 
in 188 patients on rivaroxaban (1.71% per year) and 241 on warfarin (2.16% per year) (HR 0.79; 
95% CI, 0.66 - 0.96; p<0.001 for non-inferiority). Among all randomised patients analysed according 
to ITT, primary events occurred in 269 on rivaroxaban (2.12% per year) and 306 on warfarin (2.42% 
per year) (HR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.74 - 1.03; p<0.001 for non-inferiority; p=0.117 for superiority). Results 
for secondary endpoints as tested in hierarchical order in the ITT analysis are displayed in Table 4.  
Among patients in the warfarin group, INR values were within the therapeutic range (2.0 to 3.0) a 
mean of 55% of the time (median, 58%; interquartile range, 43 to 71). The effect of rivaroxaban did 
not differ across the level of centre TTR (Time in Target INR Range of 2.0 - 3.0) in the equally sized  
quartiles (p=0.74 for interaction). Within the highest quartile according to centre, the Hazard Ratio 
(HR) with rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.49 - 1.12).  
The incidence rates for the principal safety outcome (major and non-major clinically relevant bleeding 
events) were similar for both treatment groups (see Table 5).

In addition to the phase III ROCKET AF study, a prospective, single-arm, post-authorisation, non-
interventional, open-label cohort study (XANTUS) with central outcome adjudication including 
thromboembolic events and major bleeding has been conducted. 6,785 patients with non-valvular 
atrial fibrillation were enrolled for prevention of stroke and non-central nervous system (CNS) 
systemic embolism in clinical practice. The mean CHADS2 and HAS-BLED scores were both 2.0 in 
XANTUS, compared to a mean CHADS2 and HAS-BLED score of 3.5 and 2.8 in ROCKET AF, 
respectively. Major bleeding occurred in 2.1 per 100 patient years. Fatal haemorrhage was reported in 
0.2 per 100 patient years and intracranial haemorrhage in 0.4 per 100 patient years. Stroke or non-CNS 
systemic embolism was recorded in 0.8 per 100 patient years.  
These observations in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this 
indication.  
Patients undergoing cardioversion  
A prospective, randomised, open-label, multicentre, exploratory study with blinded endpoint 
evaluation (X-VERT) was conducted in 1504 patients (oral anticoagulant naive and pre-treated) with 
non-valvular atrial fibrillation scheduled for cardioversion to compare rivaroxaban with dose-adjusted 
VKA (randomised 2:1), for the prevention of cardiovascular events. TEE- guided (1 - 5 days of pre-
treatment) or conventional cardioversion (at least three weeks of pre-treatment) strategies were 
employed. The primary efficacy outcome (all stroke, transient ischaemic attack, non-CNS systemic 
embolism, myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiovascular death) occurred in 5 (0.5%) patients in the 
rivaroxaban group (n = 978) and 5 (1.0%) patients in the VKA group (n = 492; RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.15- 
1.73; modified ITT population). The principal safety outcome (major bleeding) occurred in 6 (0.6%) 
and 4 (0.8%) patients in the rivaroxaban (n = 988) and VKA (n = 499) groups, respectively (RR 0.76; 
95% CI 0.21-2.67; safety population). This exploratory study showed comparable efficacy and safety 
between rivaroxaban and VKA treatment groups in the setting of cardioversion. 
Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement  
A randomised, open-label, multicentre study (PIONEER AF-PCI) was conducted in 2,124 patients 
with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who underwent PCI with stent placement for primary 
atherosclerotic disease to compare safety of two rivaroxaban regimens and one VKA regimen. Patients 
were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 fashion for an overall 12-month-therapy. Patients with a history of 
stroke or transient ischaemic attack were excluded.  
Group 1 received rivaroxaban 15 mg once daily (10 mg once daily in patients with creatinine 
clearance 30 – 49 ml/min) plus P2Y12 inhibitor. Group 2 received rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus 
DAPT (dual antiplatelet therapy i.e. clopidogrel 75 mg [or alternate P2Y12 inhibitor] plus low-dose 
acetylsalicylic acidASA) for 1, 6 or 12 months followed by rivaroxaban 15 mg (or 10 mg for subjects 
with creatinine clearance 30 – 49 ml/min) once daily plus low-dose acetylsalicylic acid. Group 3 
received dose-adjusted VKA plus DAPT for 1, 6 or 12 months followed by dose-adjusted VKA plus 
low-dose acetylsalicylic acid.  
The primary safety endpoint, clinically significant bleeding events, occurred in 109 (15.7%), 117 
(16.6%), and 167 (24.0%) subjects in group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively (HR 0.59; 95% CI 
0.47-0.76; p<0.001, and HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.50-0.80; p<0.001, respectively). The secondary endpoint 
(composite of cardiovascular events CV death, MI, or stroke) occurred in 41 (5.9%), 36 (5.1%), and 
36 (5.2%) subjects in the group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively. Each of the rivaroxaban regimens 
71 
 
 
 
 
showed a significant reduction in clinically significant bleeding events compared to the VKA regimen 
in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who underwent a PCI with stent placement. 
The primary objective of PIONEER AF-PCI was to assess safety. Data on efficacy (including 
thromboembolic events) in this population are limited.  
Treatment of DVT, PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE  
The rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban in the 
initial and continued treatment of acute DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence.  
Over 12,800 patients were studied in four randomised controlled phase III clinical studies (Einstein 
DVT, Einstein PE, Einstein Extension and Einstein Choice) and additionally a predefined pooled 
analysis of the Einstein DVT and Einstein PE studies was conducted. The overall combined treatment 
duration in all studies was up to 21 months. 
In Einstein DVT 3,449 patients with acute DVT were studied for the treatment of DVT and the 
prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (patients who presented with symptomatic PE were excluded 
from this study). The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical 
judgement of the investigator.  
For the initial 3 week treatment of acute DVT 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily. This 
was followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  
In Einstein PE, 4,832 patients with acute PE were studied for the treatment of PE and the prevention of 
recurrent DVT and PE. The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical 
judgement of the investigator.  
For the initial treatment of acute PE 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily for three weeks. 
This was followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  
In both the Einstein DVT and the Einstein PE study, the comparator treatment regimen consisted of 
enoxaparin administered for at least 5 days in combination with vitamin K antagonist treatment until 
the PT/INR was in therapeutic range (≥ 2.0). Treatment was continued with a vitamin K antagonist 
dose-adjusted to maintain the PT/INR values within the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0. 
In Einstein Extension 1,197 patients with DVT or PE were studied for the prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE. The treatment duration was for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had 
completed 6 to 12 months of treatment for VTE depending on the clinical judgment of the investigator. 
Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily was compared with placebo.  
Einstein DVT, PE and Extension used the same pre-defined primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. 
The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent 
DVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. The secondary efficacy outcome was defined as the composite of 
recurrent DVT, non-fatal PE and all-cause mortality.  
In Einstein Choice, 3,396 patients with confirmed symptomatic DVT and/or PE who completed 6-12 
months of anticoagulant treatment were studied for the prevention of fatal PE or non-fatal 
symptomatic recurrent DVT or PE. Patients with an indication for continued therapeutic-dosed 
anticoagulation were excluded from the study. The treatment duration was up to 12 months depending 
on the individual randomisation date (median: 351 days). Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily and 
rivaroxaban10 mg once daily were compared with 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid once daily. The primary 
efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent DVT or fatal 
or non-fatal PE. 
In the Einstein DVT study (see Table 6) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to 
enoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p < 0.0001 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 0.680 
(0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 (test for superiority)). The prespecified net clinical benefit (primary efficacy 
outcome plus major bleeding events) was reported with a HR of 0.67 ((95% CI: 0.47 - 0.95), nominal 
p value p=0.027) in favour of rivaroxaban. INR values were within the therapeutic range a mean of 
60.3% of the time for the mean treatment duration of 189 days, and 55.4%, 60.1%, and 62.8% of the 
time in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended treatment duration groups, respectively. In the 
72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation between the level of mean centre TTR (Time in 
Target INR Range of 2.0 - 3.0) in the equally sized tertiles and the incidence of the recurrent VTE 
(p=0.932 for interaction). Within the highest tertile according to centre, the HR with rivaroxaban 
versus warfarin was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.35 - 1.35).  
The incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding 
events) as well as the secondary safety outcome (major bleeding events) were similar for both 
treatment groups.

In the Einstein PE study (see Table 7) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to 
enoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p=0.0026 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 1.123 
(0.749 - 1.684)). The prespecified net clinical benefit (primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding 
events) was reported with a HR of 0.849 ((95% CI: 0.633 - 1.139), nominal p-value p=0.275). INR 
values were within the therapeutic range a mean of 63% of the time for the mean treatment duration of 
215 days, and 57%, 62%, and 65% of the time in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended treatment duration 
groups, respectively. In the enoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation between the level of 
mean centre TTR (Time in Target INR Range of 2.0 - 3.0) in the equally sized tertiles and the

centre, the HR with rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.642 (95% CI: 0.277 - 1.484). 
The incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding 
events) were slightly lower in the rivaroxaban treatment group (10.3% (249/2412)) than in the 
enoxaparin/VKA treatment group (11.4% (274/2405)). The incidence of the secondary safety outcome 
(major bleeding events) was lower in the rivaroxaban group (1.1% (26/2412)) than in the

In addition to the phase III EINSTEIN programme, a prospective, non-interventional, open-label 
cohort study (XALIA) with central outcome adjudication including recurrent VTE, major bleeding and 
death has been conducted. 5,142 patients with acute DVT were enrolled to investigate the long-term 
safety of rivaroxaban compared with standard-of-care anticoagulation therapy in clinical practice. 
Rates of major bleeding, recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality for rivaroxaban were 0.7%, 1.4% and 
0.5%, respectively. There were differences in patient baseline characteristics including age, cancer and 
renal impairment. A pre-specified propensity score stratified analysis was used to adjust for measured 
baseline differences but residual confounding may, in spite of this, influence the results. Adjusted HRs 
comparing rivaroxaban and standard-of-care for major bleeding, recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality 
were 0.77 (95% CI 0.40 - 1.50), 0.91 (95% CI 0.54 - 1.54) and 0.51 (95% CI 0.24 - 1.07), respectively.  
These results in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this indication. 
Paediatric population  
Treatment of VTE and prevention of VTE recurrence in paediatric patients 
A total of 727 children with confirmed acute VTE, of whom 528 received rivaroxaban, were studied in 
6 open-label, multicentre paediatric studies. Body weight-adjusted dosing in patients from birth to less 
than 18 years resulted in rivaroxaban exposure similar to that observed in adult DVT patients treated 
with rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily as confirmed in the phase III study (see section 5.2). 
The EINSTEIN Junior phase III study was a randomised, active-controlled, open-label multicentre 
clinical study in 500 paediatric patients (aged from birth to < 18 years) with confirmed acute VTE.  
There were 276 children aged 12 to < 18 years, 101 children aged 6 to < 12 years, 69 children aged 2 
to < 6 years, and 54 children aged < 2 years. 
Index VTE was classified as either central venous catheter-related VTE (CVC-VTE; 90/335 patients 
in the rivaroxaban group, 37/165 patients in the comparator group), cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis 
(CVST; 74/335 patients in the rivaroxaban group, 43/165 patients in the comparator group), and all 
others including DVT and PE (non-CVC-VTE; 171/335 patients in the rivaroxaban group, 85/165 
patients in the comparator group). The most common presentation of index thrombosis in children 
aged 12 to < 18 years was non-CVC-VTE in 211 (76.4%); in children aged 6 to < 12 years and aged 
2 to < 6 years was CVST in 48 (47.5%) and 35 (50.7%), respectively; and in children aged < 2 years 
was CVC-VTE in 37 (68.5%). There were no children < 6 months with CVST in the rivaroxaban 
group. 22 of the patients with CVST had a CNS infection (13 patients in the rivaroxaban group and 9 
patients in comparator group).  
VTE was provoked by persistent, transient, or both persistent and transient risk factors in 438 (87.6%) 
children. 
Patients received initial treatment with therapeutic doses of UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux for at least 
5 days, and were randomised 2:1 to receive either body weight-adjusted doses of rivaroxaban or 
comparator group (heparins, VKA) for a main study treatment period of 3 months (1 month for 
children < 2 years with CVC-VTE). At the end of the main study treatment period, the diagnostic 
imaging test, which was obtained at baseline, was repeated, if clinically feasible. The study treatment 
could be stopped at this point, or at the discretion of the Investigator continued for up to 12 months 
(for children < 2 years with CVC-VTE up to 3 months) in total.  
The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE. The primary safety outcome was the 
composite of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB). All efficacy and 
safety outcomes were centrally adjudicated by an independent committee blinded for treatment 
allocation. The efficacy and safety results are shown in Tables 11 and 12 below.  
Recurrent VTEs occurred in the rivaroxaban group in 4 of 335 patients and in the comparator group in  
5 of 165 patients. The composite of major bleeding and CRNMB was reported in 10 of 329 patients 
(3%) treated with rivaroxaban and in 3 of 162 patients (1.9%) treated with comparator. Net clinical 
76 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
benefit (symptomatic recurrent VTE plus major bleeding events) was reported in the rivaroxaban 
group in 4 of 335 patients and in the comparator group in 7 of 165 patients. Normalisation of the 
thrombus burden on repeat imaging occurred in 128 of 335 patients with rivaroxaban treatment and in 
43 of 165 patients in the comparator group. These findings were generally similar among age groups. 
There were 119 (36.2%) children with any treatment-emergent bleeding in the rivaroxaban group and 
45 (27.8%) children in the comparator group.

The efficacy and safety profile of rivaroxaban was largely similar between the paediatric VTE 
population and the DVT/PE adult population, however, the proportion of subjects with any bleeding 
was higher in the paediatric VTE population as compared to the DVT/PE adult population.  
Patients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome  
In an investigator sponsored, randomised open-label multicentre study with blinded endpoint 
adjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, 
diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for all 
77 
 
  
 
  
 
  
  
  
 
3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I 
antibodies). The study was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of 120 patients due to an excess 
of events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was 569 days. 59 patients were 
randomised to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <50 mL/min) 
and 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in 12% of patients randomised to 
rivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No events were reported in patients 
randomised to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) of the rivaroxaban group and 2 
patients (3%) of the warfarin group.  
Paediatric population  
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
rivaroxabanin all subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of thromboembolic events (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption  
The following information is based on the data obtained in adults. 
Rivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 2 - 4 hours after 
tablet intake.  
Oral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80 - 100%) for the 
2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions. Intake with food does not affect 
rivaroxaban AUC or Cmax at the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose.  
Due to a reduced extent of absorption an oral bioavailability of 66% was determined for the 20 mg 
tablet under fasting conditions. When  rivaroxaban 20 mg tablets are taken together with food 
increases in mean AUC by 39% were observed when compared to tablet intake under fasting 
conditions, indicating almost complete absorption and high oral bioavailability. Rivaroxaban 15 mg 
and 20 mg are to be taken with food (see section 4.2).  
Rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg once daily in fasting state. 
Under fed conditions rivaroxaban 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg tablets demonstrated dose-proportionality. 
At higher doses rivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased bioavailability and 
decreased absorption rate with increased dose.  
Variability in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual variability (CV%) 
ranging from 30% to 40%.  
Absorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29% 
and 56% decrease in AUC and Cmax compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is 
released in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in 
the distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the 
stomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban 
exposure.  
Bioavailability (AUC and Cmax) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a 
crushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube 
followed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional 
pharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable 
to lower rivaroxaban doses.  
Paediatric population  
Children received rivaroxaban tablet or oral suspension during or closely after feeding or food intake 
and with a typical serving of liquid to ensure reliable dosing in children. As in adults, rivaroxaban is 
readily absorbed after oral administration as tablet or granules for oral suspension formulation in 
children. No difference in the absorption rate nor in the extent of absorption between the tablet and 
granules for oral suspension formulation was observed. No PK data following intravenous 
administration to children are available so that the absolute bioavailability of rivaroxaban in children is 
unknown. A decrease in the relative bioavailability for increasing doses (in mg/kg bodyweight) was 
found, suggesting absorption limitations for higher doses, even when taken together with food. 
Rivaroxaban 15 mg tablets should be taken with feeding or with food (see section 4.2). 
78 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution  
Plasma protein binding in adults is high at approximately 92% to 95%, with serum albumin being the 
main binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with Vss being approximately 
50 litres.  
Paediatric population  
No data on rivaroxaban plasma protein binding specific to children is available. No PK data following 
intravenous administration of rivaroxaban to children is available. Vss estimated via population PK 
modelling in children (age range 0 to < 18 years) following oral administration of rivaroxaban is 
dependent on body weight and can be described with an allometric function, with an average of 113 L 
for a subject with a body weight of 82.8 kg.  
Biotransformation and elimination  
In adults, of the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, 
with half then being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 
of the administered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, 
mainly via active renal secretion.  
Rivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative 
degradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of 
biotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter 
proteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein).  
Unchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active 
circulating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be 
classified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the 
elimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption 
rate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in 
young individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly.  
Paediatric population  
No metabolism data specific to children is available. No PK data following intravenous administration 
of rivaroxaban to children is available. CL estimated via population PK modelling in children (age 
range 0 to < 18 years) following oral administration of rivaroxaban is dependent on body weight and 
can be described with an allometric function, with an average of 8 L/h for a subject with body weight 
of 82.8 kg. The geometric mean values for disposition half-lives (t1/2) estimated via population PK 
modelling decrease with decreasing age and ranged from 4.2 h in adolescents to approximately 3 h in 
children aged 2-12 years down to 1.9 and 1.6 h in children aged 0.5-< 2 years and less than 0.5 years, 
respectively.  
Special populations 
Gender  
In adults, there were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
between male and female patients. An exploratory analysis did not reveal relevant differences in 
rivaroxaban exposure between male and female children. 
Elderly population  
Elderly patients exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with mean AUC values 
being approximately 1.5 fold higher, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total and renal clearance. No 
dose adjustment is necessary.  
Different weight categories  
In adults, extremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban 
plasma concentrations (less than 25%). No dose adjustment is necessary. 
In children, rivaroxaban is dosed based on body weight. An exploratory analysis did not reveal a 
relevant impact of underweight or obesity on rivaroxaban exposure in children. 
Inter-ethnic differences  
79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In adults, no clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, 
Hispanic, Japanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics.  
An exploratory analysis did not reveal relevant inter-ethnic differences in rivaroxaban exposure among 
Japanese, Chinese or Asian children outside Japan and China compared to the respective overall 
paediatric population.  
Hepatic impairment  
Cirrhotic adult patients with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only 
minor changes in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics (1.2 fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), 
nearly comparable to their matched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (classified as Child Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by 2.3 
fold compared to healthy volunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6 fold. These patients also had 
reduced renal elimination of rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. There 
are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  
The inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor 
of 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a 
steeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT.  
Rivaroxaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and 
clinically relevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 
4.3).  
No clinical data is available in children with hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment 
In adults, there was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as 
assessed via creatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 50 – 
80 ml/min), moderate (creatinine clearance 30 – 49 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15 – 
29 ml/min) renal impairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 and 
1.6 fold respectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced. In 
individuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of factor Xa 
activity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy volunteers; 
prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. There are no 
data in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min.  
Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable.  
Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. Rivaroxaban is to be used 
with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 – 29 ml/min (see section 4.4). 
No clinical data is available in children 1 year or older with moderate or severe renal impairment 
(glomerular filtration rate < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2).  
Pharmacokinetic data in patients  
In patients receiving rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily for treatment of acute DVT the geometric mean 
concentration (90% prediction interval) 2 – 4 h and about 24 h after dose (roughly representing 
maximum and minimum concentrations during the dose interval) was 215 (22 - 535) and 32 (6 - 239) 
mcg/l, respectively.  
In paediatric patients with acute VTE receiving body weight-adjusted rivaroxaban leading to an 
exposure similar to that in adult DVT patients receiving a 20 mg once daily dose, the geometric mean 
concentrations (90% interval) at sampling time intervals roughly representing maximum and minimum 
concentrations during the dose interval are summarised in Table 13.

Values below lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were substituted by 1/2 LLOQ for the calculation 
of statistics (LLOQ = 0.5 mcg/L).  
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship  
The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between rivaroxaban plasma 
concentration and several PD endpoints (factor Xa inhibition, PT, aPTT, Heptest) has been evaluated 
after administration of a wide range of doses (5 – 30 mg twice a day). The relationship between 
rivaroxaban concentration and factor Xa activity was best described by an Emax model. For PT, the 
linear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents 
used, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and 
the slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcg/l). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were 
consistent with the data established in healthy subjects.  
Paediatric population  
Safety and efficacy have not been established in the indication prevention of stroke and systemic 
embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation for children and adolescents up to 18 years. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile 
toxicity.  
Effects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic 
activity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant 
exposure levels.  
In rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive 
toxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic 
complications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, 
hepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as 
placental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre- and post-
natal study in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams. 
Rivaroxaban was tested in juvenile rats up to 3 - month treatment duration starting at postnatal day 4 
showing a non dose-related increase in periinsular haemorrhage. No evidence of target organ-specific 
toxicity was seen.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Adults 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation with 
one or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes 
mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack. 
Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE in adults. (See section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients.) 
Paediatric population  
Treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and prevention of VTE recurrence in children and 
adolescents aged less than 18 years and weighing more than 50 kg after at least 5 days of initial 
parenteral anticoagulation treatment.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adults 
The recommended dose is 20 mg once daily, which is also the recommended maximum dose.  
Therapy with Rivaroxaban Viatris should be continued long term provided the benefit of prevention of 
stroke and systemic embolism outweighs the risk of bleeding (see section 4.4).  
If a dose is missed the patient should take Rivaroxaban Viatris immediately and continue on the 
following day with the once daily intake as recommended. The dose should not be doubled within the 
same day to make up for a missed dose.

Treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults  
The recommended dose for the initial treatment of acute DVT or PE is 15 mg twice daily for the first 
three weeks followed by 20 mg once daily for the continued treatment and prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE. 
Short duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be considered in patients with DVT or PE 
provoked by major transient risk factors (i.e. recent major surgery or trauma). Longer duration of 
therapy should be considered in patients with provoked DVT or PE not related to major transient risk 
factors, unprovoked DVT or PE, or a history of recurrent DVT or PE.  
When extended prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated (following completion of at least 6 
months therapy for DVT or PE), the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily. In patients in whom the 
risk of recurrent DVT or PE is considered high, such as those with complicated comorbidities, or who 
have developed recurrent DVT or PE on extended prevention with Rivaroxaban Viatris 10 mg once 
daily, a dose of Rivaroxaban Viatris 20 mg once daily should be considered.  
The duration of therapy and dose selection should be individualised after careful assessment of the 
treatment benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4).

or 20 mg 
To support the dose switch from 15 mg to 20 mg after Day 21 a first 4 weeks treatment initiation pack 
of Rivaroxaban Viatris for treatment of DVT/PE is available.  
If a dose is missed during the 15 mg twice daily treatment phase (day 1 - 21), the patient should take 
Rivaroxaban Viatris immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg Rivaroxaban Viatris per day. In this case 
two 15 mg tablets may be taken at once. The patient should continue with the regular 15 mg twice 
daily intake as recommended on the following day.  
If a dose is missed during the once daily treatment phase, the patient should take Rivaroxaban Viatris 
immediately, and continue on the following day with the once daily intake as recommended. The dose 
should not be doubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose.  
Treatment of VTE and prevention of VTE recurrence in children and adolescents  
Rivaroxaban Viatris treatment in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years should be initiated 
following at least 5 days of initial parenteral anticoagulation treatment (see section 5.1). 
The dose for children and adolescent is calculated based on body weight. 
-  Body weight of 50 kg or more:  
- 
- 
a once daily dose of 20 mg rivaroxaban is recommended. This is the maximum daily dose. 
Body weight from 30 to 50 kg: 
a once daily dose of 15 mg rivaroxaban is recommended. This is the maximum daily dose. 
For patients with body weight less 30 kg refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of 
more suitable forms of rivaroxaban. 
The weight of a child should be monitored and the dose reviewed regularly. This is to ensure a 
therapeutic dose is maintained. Dose adjustments should be made based on changes in body weight 
only.  
Treatment should be continued for at least 3 months in children and adolescents. Treatment can be 
extended up to 12 months when clinically necessary. There is no data available in children to support a 
85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dose reduction after 6 months treatment. The benefit-risk of continued therapy after 3 months should 
be assessed on an individual basis taking into account the risk for recurrent thrombosis versus the 
potential bleeding risk. 
If a dose is missed, the missed dose should be taken as soon as possible after it is noticed, but only on 
the same day. If this is not possible, the patient should skip the dose and continue with the next dose as 
prescribed. The patient should not take two doses to make up for a missed dose. 
Converting from Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) to Rivaroxaban Viatris  
- 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism: 
VKA treatment should be stopped and Rivaroxaban Viatris therapy should be initiated when the 
International Normalised Ratio (INR) is ≤ 3.0. 
Treatment of DVT, PE and prevention of recurrence in adults and treatment of VTE and 
prevention of recurrence in paediatric patients: 
VKA treatment should be stopped and rivaroxaban therapy should be initiated once the INR is ≤ 
2.5. 
- 
When converting patients from VKAs to Rivaroxaban Viatris, INR values will be falsely elevated 
after the intake ofRivaroxaban Viatris. The INR is not valid to measure the anticoagulant activity of 
Rivaroxaban Viatris, and therefore should not be used (see section 4.5).  
Converting from Rivaroxaban Viatris to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA)  
There is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from Rivaroxaban Viatris to 
VKA. Continuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate 
anticoagulant. It should be noted that Rivaroxaban Viatris can contribute to an elevated INR.  
In patients converting from Rivaroxaban Viatris to VKA, VKA should be given concurrently until the 
INR is ≥ 2.0. For the first two days of the conversion period, standard initial dosing of VKA should be 
used followed by VKA dosing, as guided by INR testing. While patients are on both Rivaroxaban 
Viatris and VKA the INR should not be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to 
the next dose of Rivaroxaban Viatris. Once Rivaroxaban Viatris is discontinued INR testing may be 
done reliably at least 24 hours after the last dose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Paediatric patients: 
Children who convert from Rivaroxaban Viatris to VKA need to continue Rivaroxaban Viatris for 
48 hours after the first dose of VKA. After 2 days of co-administration an INR should be obtained 
prior to the next scheduled dose of Rivaroxaban Viatris. Co-administration of Rivaroxaban Viatris and 
VKA is advised to continue until the INR is ≥ 2.0. Once Rivaroxaban Viatris is discontinued INR 
testing may be done reliably 24 hours after the last dose (see above and section 4.5).  
Converting from parenteral anticoagulants to Rivaroxaban Viatris 
For adult and paediatric patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, discontinue the 
parenteral anticoagulant and start Rivaroxaban Viatris 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next 
scheduled administration of the parenteral medicinal product (e.g. low molecular weight heparins) 
would be due or at the time of discontinuation of a continuously administered parenteral medicinal 
product (e.g. intravenous unfractionated heparin).  
Converting from Rivaroxaban Viatris to parenteral anticoagulants  
Discontinue Rivaroxaban Viatris and give the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next 
Rivaroxaban Viatris dose would be taken.  
Special populations  
Renal impairment 
Adults:  
Limited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 – 29 ml/min) 
indicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased. Therefore, Rivaroxaban 
Viatris is to be used with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine 
clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  
86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30 – 49 ml/min) or severe (creatinine clearance 
15-29 ml/min) renal impairment the following dose recommendations apply:  
-  
-  
For the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial 
fibrillation, the recommended dose is 15 mg once daily (see section 5.2).  
For the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE: patients 
should be treated with 15 mg twice daily for the first 3 weeks. Thereafter, when the 
recommended dose is 20 mg once daily, a reduction of the dose from 20 mg once daily to 15 mg 
once daily should be considered if the patient’s assessed risk for bleeding outweighs the risk for 
recurrent DVT and PE. The recommendation for the use of 15 mg is based on PK modelling and 
has not been studied in this clinical setting (see sections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).  
When the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily, no dose adjustment from the recommended 
dose is necessary.  
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
50-80 ml/min) (see section 5.2).  
Paediatric population: 
- 
Children and adolescents with mild renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate 
50 - 80 mL/min/1.73 m2): no dose adjustment is required, based on data in adults and limited 
data in paediatric patients (see section 5.2).  
Children and adolescents with moderate or severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate 
< 50 mL/min/1.73 m2): Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended as no clinical data is 
available (see section 4.4).  
- 
Hepatic impairment  
Rivaroxaban Viatris is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy 
and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see sections 
4.3 and 5.2). No clinical data is available in children with hepatic impairment. 
Elderly population  
No dose adjustment (see section 5.2)  
Body weight  
No dose adjustment for adults (see section 5.2)  
For paediatric patients the dose is determined based on body weight. 
Gender  
No dose adjustment (see section 5.2)  
Patients undergoing cardioversion  
Rivaroxaban Viatris can be initiated or continued in patients who may require cardioversion. For 
transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) guided cardioversion in patients not previously treated with 
anticoagulants, Rivaroxaban Viatris treatment should be started at least 4 hours before cardioversion to 
ensure adequate anticoagulation (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). For all patients, confirmation should be 
sought prior to cardioversion that the patient has taken Rivaroxaban Viatris as prescribed. Decisions 
on initiation and duration of treatment should take established guideline recommendations for 
anticoagulant treatment in patients undergoing cardioversion into account.  
Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) 
with stent placement  
There is limited experience of a reduced dose of 15 mg Rivaroxaban Viatris once daily (or 10 mg 
Rivaroxaban Viatris once daily for patients with moderate renal impairment [creatinine clearance 
30-49 ml/min]) in addition to a P2Y12 inhibitor for a maximum of 12 months in patients with non-
valvular atrial fibrillation who require oral anticoagulation and undergo PCI with stent placement 
(see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  
87 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris in children aged 0 to < 18 years have not been 
established in the indication prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular 
atrial fibrillation. No data are available. Therefore, it is not recommended for use in children below 
18 years of age in indications other than the treatment of VTE and prevention of VTE recurrence. 
Method of administration  
Adults 
Rivaroxaban Viatris is for oral use. 
The tablets are to be taken with food (see section 5.2). 
Crushing of tablets 
For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Rivaroxaban Viatris tablets may be crushed and 
mixed with water or apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally. After the 
administration of crushed Rivaroxaban Viatris 15 mg or 20 mg film-coated tablets, the dose should be 
immediately followed by food. 
The crushed Rivaroxaban Viatris tablets may also be given through gastric tubes (see sections 5.2 and 
6.6).  
Children and adolescents weighing more than 50 kg  
Rivaroxaban Viatris is for oral use. 
The patient should be advised to swallow the tablet with liquid. It should also be taken with food (see 
section 5.2). The tablets should be taken approximately 24 hours apart.   
In case the patient immediately spits up the dose or vomits within 30 minutes after receiving the dose, 
a new dose should be given. However, if the patient vomits more than 30 minutes after the dose, the 
dose should not be re-administered and the next dose should be taken as scheduled.  
The tablet must not be split in an attempt to provide a fraction of a tablet dose.   
Crushing of tablets  
For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, other pharmaceutical forms such as granules for 
oral suspension should be used. If the oral suspension is not immediately available, when doses of 
15 mg or 20 mg rivaroxaban are prescribed, these could be provided by crushing the 15 mg or 20 mg 
tablet and mixing it with water or apple puree immediately prior to use and administering orally. 
The crushed tablet may be given through a nasogastric or gastric feeding tube (see sections 5.2 and 
6.6)  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Active clinically significant bleeding.  
Lesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current 
or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent 
brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, 
known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major 
intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities.  
Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low 
molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral 
anticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of 
switching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain 
an open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5).  
88 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic 
patients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2).  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Clinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment 
period. 
Haemorrhagic risk  
As with other anticoagulants, patients taking Rivaroxaban Viatris are to be carefully observed for 
signs of bleeding. It is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of 
haemorrhage. Rivaroxaban Viatris administration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage 
occurs (see section 4.9).  
In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary 
including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently 
during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate 
clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult 
bleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate.  
Several sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. These patients are 
to be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications and anaemia after 
initiation of treatment (see section 4.8). Any unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should 
lead to a search for a bleeding site.  
Although treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban 
levels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional 
situations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. 
overdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population  
There is limited data in children with cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis who have a CNS infection 
(see section 5.1). The risk of bleeding should be carefully evaluated before and during therapy with 
rivaroxaban.  
Renal impairment  
In adult patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) rivaroxaban plasma 
levels may be significantly increased (1.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding 
risk. Rivaroxaban Viatris is to be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 – 
29 ml/min. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.2 
and 5.2).  
Rivaroxaban Viatris should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment concomitantly 
receiving other medicinal products which increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (see 
section 4.5). 
Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended in children and adolescents with moderate or severe renal 
impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2), as no clinical data is available. 
Interaction with other medicinal products  
The use of Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic 
treatment with azole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and 
posaconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors 
of both CYP3A4 and P-gp and therefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a 
clinically relevant degree (2.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk No 
89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clinical data is available in children receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inhibitors of 
both CYP 3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.5). 
Care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis 
such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and 
platelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease 
an appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see section 4.5).  
Other haemorrhagic risk factors  
As with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding 
risk such as:  
• 
• 
• 
congenital or acquired bleeding disorders  
uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension  
other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding 
complications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal 
reflux disease)  
vascular retinopathy  
bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding  
• 
• 
Patients with cancer 
Patients with malignant disease may simultaneously be at higher risk of bleeding and thrombosis. The 
individual benefit of antithrombotic treatment should be weighed against risk for bleeding in patients 
with active cancer dependent on tumour location, antineoplastic therapy and stage of disease. Tumours 
located in the gastrointestinal or genito urinary tract have been associated with an increased risk of 
bleeding during rivaroxaban therapy. 
In patients with malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, the use of rivaroxaban is contraindicated 
(see section 4.3). 
Patients with prosthetic valves  
Rivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone 
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris have not 
been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that 
Rivaroxaban Viatris provides adequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with 
Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended for these patients.  
Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome  
Direct acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients 
with a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for 
patients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-
glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of 
recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.  
Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement  
Clinical data are available from an interventional study with the primary objective to assess safety in 
patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement. Data on efficacy 
in this population are limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). No data are available for such patients with a 
history of stroke/ transient ischaemic attack. 
Haemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary 
embolectomy  
Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with 
pulmonary embolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary 
embolectomy since the safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris have not been established in these 
clinical situations.  
Spinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture   
90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, 
patients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk 
of developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. 
The risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or 
the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by 
traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and 
symptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder 
dysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior 
to neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in 
anticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. There is no clinical 
experience with the use of 20 mg rivaroxaban in these situations.  
To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and 
neuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of 
rivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when 
the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low. However, the exact timing to reach a 
sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known and should be weighed against the 
urgency of a diagnostic procedure.  
For the removal of an epidural catheter and based on the general PK characteristics at least 2x half-
life, i.e. at least 18 hours in young adult patients and 26 hours in elderly patients should elapse after 
the last administration of rivaroxaban (see section 5.2). Following removal of the catheter, at least 
6 hours should elapse before the next rivaroxaban dose is administered.  
If traumatic puncture occurs the administration of rivaroxaban is to be delayed for 24 hours. 
No data is available on the timing of the placement or removal of neuraxial catheter in children while 
on Rivaroxaban Viatris. In such cases, discontinue rivaroxaban and consider a short acting parenteral 
anticoagulant. 
Dosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention  
If an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Rivaroxaban Viatris 20 mg should be 
stopped at least 24 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the 
physician. If the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed against 
the urgency of the intervention.  
Rivaroxaban Viatris should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical 
intervention provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as 
determined by the treating physician (see section 5.2). 
Elderly population  
Increasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). 
Dermatological reactions  
Serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS 
syndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of 
rivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the 
course of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of 
treatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. 
spreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal 
lesions.  
Information about excipients 
Rivaroxaban Viatris contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, 
total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The extent of interactions in the paediatric population is not known. The below mentioned interaction 
data was obtained in adults and the warnings in section 4.4 should be taken into account for the 
paediatric population. 
CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors  
Co-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a 
day) led to a 2.6 fold / 2.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7 fold / 1.6 fold increase in 
mean rivaroxaban Cmax, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an 
increased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended in patients 
receiving concomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
voriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong 
inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4). 
Active substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either 
CYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. 
Clarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and 
moderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4 fold increase in 
Cmax. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be 
potentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4)  
Erythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a 1.3 
fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and Cmax. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not 
clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients.  
In subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8 fold 
increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in Cmax when compared to subjects with 
normal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0 fold 
increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in Cmax when compared to subjects with 
normal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see 
section 4.4).  
Fluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4 fold 
increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3 fold increase in mean Cmax. The interaction with 
fluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-
risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). 
Given the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should 
be avoided. 
Anticoagulants  
After combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single 
dose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on 
clotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban.  
Due to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any 
other anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
NSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors  
No clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of 
rivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more 
pronounced pharmacodynamic response.  
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when 
rivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid.  
Clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a 
pharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was 
observed in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or 
GPIIb/IIIa receptor levels.  
92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) 
and platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding 
risk (see section 4.4). 
SSRIs/SNRIs  
As with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in 
case of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When 
concomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or non-
major clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. 
Warfarin  
Converting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or 
from rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) 
more than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, 
inhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive.  
If it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, anti-
factor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On the 
fourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa activity 
and ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban.  
If it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR 
measurement can be used at the Ctrough of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of 
rivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point.  
No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. 
CYP3A4 inducers  
Co-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate 
50% decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The 
concomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital or St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban 
plasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be 
avoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis.  
Other concomitant therapies  
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when 
rivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), 
atorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban 
neither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4.  
Laboratory parameters  
Clotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, Hep test) are affected as expected by the mode of action of 
rivaroxaban (see section 5.1). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy  
Safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, 
the intrinsic risk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, Rivaroxaban 
Viatris is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3).  
Women of child-bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with rivaroxaban.  
Breast-feeding  
Safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data 
from animals indicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore Rivaroxaban Viatris is 
contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to 
discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from therapy.

Fertility  
No specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In 
a study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Rivaroxaban Viatris has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions 
like syncope (frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see 
section 4.8). Patients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
The safety of rivaroxaban has been evaluated in thirteen pivotal phase III studies (see Table 1). 
Overall, 69,608 adult patients in nineteen phase III studies and 488 paediatric patients in two phase II 
and two phase III studies were exposed to rivaroxaban.

A pre-specified selective approach to adverse event collection was applied in selected phase III 
studies. The incidence of adverse reactions did not increase and no new adverse drug reaction 
was identified after analysis of these studies. 
Description of selected adverse reactions  
Due to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of Rivaroxaban Viatris may be associated with an 
increased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post 
haemorrhagic anaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary 
according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 
“Management of bleeding”). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, 
gastrointestinal, genito urinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and 
anaemia were seen more frequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA 
treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of 
haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical 
relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in 
certain patient groups, e.g. those patients with uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on 
concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4 “Haemorrhagic risk”). Menstrual 
bleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. Haemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, 
paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some 
cases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of cardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris 
have been observed. 
Known complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure 
due to hypoperfusion, or anticoagulant-related nephropathy have been reported for Rivaroxaban 
Viatris. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to be considered in evaluating the condition in 
any anticoagulated patient.  
Paediatric population   
Treatment of VTE and prevention of VTE recurrence 
The safety assessment in children and adolescents is based on the safety data from two phase II and 
one phase III open-label active controlled studies in paediatric patients aged birth to less than 18 years. 
The safety findings were generally similar between rivaroxaban and comparator in the various 
paediatric age groups. Overall, the safety profile in the 412 children and adolescents treated with 
rivaroxaban was similar to that observed in the adult population and consistent across age subgroups, 
although assessment is limited by the small number of patients.  
In paediatric patients, headache (very common, 16.7%), fever (very common, 11.7%), epistaxis (very 
common, 11.2%), vomiting (very common, 10.7%), tachycardia (common, 1.5%), increase in bilirubin 
(common, 1.5%) and bilirubin conjugated increased (uncommon, 0.7%) were reported more frequently 
as compared to adults. Consistent with adult population, menorrhagia was observed in 6.6% (common) 
of female adolescents after menarche. Thrombocytopenia as observed in the post-marketing 
experience in adult population was common (4.6%) in paediatric clinical studies. The adverse drug 
reactions in paediatric patients were primarily mild to moderate in severity.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In adults, rare cases of overdose up to 1,960 mg have been reported. In case of overdose, the patient 
should be observed carefully for bleeding complications or other adverse reactions (see section 
“Management of bleeding”). There is limited data available in children. Due to limited absorption a 
ceiling effect with no further increase in average plasma exposure is expected at supratherapeutic 
doses of 50 mg rivaroxaban or above in adults, however, no data is available at supratherapeutic doses 
in children.  
98 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is 
available for adults, but not established in children (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of 
andexanet alfa).  
The use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered. 
Management of bleeding  
Should a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban 
administration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has 
a half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours in adults. The half-life in children estimated using 
population pharmacokinetic (popPK) modelling approaches is shorter (see section 5.2). Management 
should be individualised according to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate 
symptomatic treatment could be used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe 
epistaxis), surgical haemostasis with bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and 
haemodynamic support, blood products (packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on 
associated anaemia or coagulopathy) or platelets.  
If bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, either the administration of a specific factor 
Xa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet alfa), which antagonises the pharmacodynamic effect of 
rivaroxaban, or a specific procoagulant agent, such as prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), 
activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa), should be 
considered. However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of these 
medicinal products in adults and children receiving rivaroxaban. The recommendation is also based on 
limited non-clinical data. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa shall be considered and titrated 
depending on improvement of bleeding. Depending on local availability, a consultation with a 
coagulation expert should be considered in case of major bleedings (see section 5.1).  
Protamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. 
There is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and 
aprotinin in adults and children receiving rivaroxaban. There is no experience on the use of these 
agents in children. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor experience with the use of the 
systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. Due to the high plasma 
protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01  
Mechanism of action  
Rivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of 
factor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting 
both thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin 
(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. 
Pharmacodynamic effects  
Dose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is 
influenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations 
(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. 
The readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR is only calibrated and validated for 
coumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant.  
In patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence, the 5/95 
percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 2 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the time of maximum effect) for 
15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily ranged from 17 to 32 s and for 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily from 15 
to 30 s. At trough (8 - 16 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles for 15 mg twice daily ranged from 
14 to 24 s and for 20 mg once daily (18 - 30 h after tablet intake) from 13 to 20 s.  
99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
In patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation receiving rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and 
systemic embolism, the 5/95 percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 1 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the 
time of maximum effect) in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged from 14 to 40 s and in 
patients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 10 to 50 s. At trough (16 
- 36 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged from 12 
to 26 s and in patients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 12 to 26 s.  
In a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult 
subjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC 
(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC 
reduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to 
reductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC 
had a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation 
than the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9).  
The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and Hep test are also prolonged dose-dependently; 
however, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no 
need for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical routine. 
However, if clinically indicated rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated quantitative anti-
factor Xa tests (see section 5.2).  
Paediatric population  
PT (neoplastin reagent), aPTT, and anti-Xa assay (with a calibrated quantitative test) display a close 
correlation to plasma concentrations in children. The correlation between anti-Xa to plasma 
concentrations is linear with a slope close to 1. Individual discrepancies with higher or lower anti-Xa 
values as compared to the corresponding plasma concentrations may occur. There is no need for 
routine monitoring of coagulation parameters during clinical treatment with rivaroxaban. However, if 
clinically indicated, rivaroxaban concentrations can be measured by calibrated quantitative antiFactor 
Xa tests in mcg/L (see table 13 in section 5.2 for ranges of observed rivaroxaban plasma 
concentrations in children). The lower limit of quantifications must be considered when the anti-Xa 
test is used to quantify plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban in children. No threshold for efficacy or 
safety events has been established.  
Clinical efficacy and safety  
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation 
The rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban for the 
prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.  
In the pivotal double-blind ROCKET AF study, 14,264 patients were assigned either to rivaroxaban 
20 mg once daily (15 mg once daily in patients with creatinine clearance 30 – 49 ml/min) or to 
warfarin titrated to a target INR of 2.5 (therapeutic range 2.0 to 3.0). The median time on treatment 
was 19 months and overall treatment duration was up to 41 months.  
34.9% of patients were treated with acetylsalicylic acid and 11.4% were treated with class III 
antiarrhythmic including amiodarone.  
Rivaroxaban was non-inferior to warfarin for the primary composite endpoint of stroke and non-CNS 
systemic embolism. In the per-protocol population on treatment, stroke or systemic embolism occurred 
in 188 patients on rivaroxaban (1.71% per year) and 241 on warfarin (2.16% per year) (HR 0.79; 
95% CI, 0.66 - 0.96; p<0.001 for non-inferiority). Among all randomised patients analysed according 
to ITT, primary events occurred in 269 on rivaroxaban (2.12% per year) and 306 on warfarin (2.42% 
per year) (HR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.74 - 1.03; p<0.001 for non-inferiority; p=0.117 for superiority). Results 
for secondary endpoints as tested in hierarchical order in the ITT analysis are displayed in Table 4.  
Among patients in the warfarin group, INR values were within the therapeutic range (2.0 to 3.0) a 
mean of 55% of the time (median, 58%; interquartile range, 43 to 71). The effect of rivaroxaban did 
not differ across the level of centre TTR (Time in Target INR Range of 2.0 - 3.0) in the equally sized  
quartiles (p=0.74 for interaction). Within the highest quartile according to centre, the Hazard Ratio 
(HR) with rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.49 - 1.12).  
The incidence rates for the principal safety outcome (major and non-major clinically relevant bleeding 
events) were similar for both treatment groups (see Table 5).

In addition to the phase III ROCKET AF study, a prospective, single-arm, post-authorisation, non-
interventional, open-label cohort study (XANTUS) with central outcome adjudication including 
thromboembolic events and major bleeding has been conducted. 6,785 patients with non-valvular 
atrial fibrillation were enrolled for prevention of stroke and non-central nervous system (CNS) 
systemic embolism in clinical practice. The mean CHADS2 and HAS-BLED scores were both 2.0 in 
XANTUS, compared to a mean CHADS2 and HAS-BLED score of 3.5 and 2.8 in ROCKET AF, 
respectively. Major bleeding occurred in 2.1 per 100 patient years. Fatal haemorrhage was reported in 
0.2 per 100 patient years and intracranial haemorrhage in 0.4 per 100 patient years. Stroke or non-CNS 
systemic embolism was recorded in 0.8 per 100 patient years.  
These observations in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this 
indication.  
Patients undergoing cardioversion  
A prospective, randomised, open-label, multicentre, exploratory study with blinded endpoint 
evaluation (X-VERT) was conducted in 1504 patients (oral anticoagulant naive and pre-treated) with 
non-valvular atrial fibrillation scheduled for cardioversion to compare rivaroxaban with dose-adjusted 
VKA (randomised 2:1), for the prevention of cardiovascular events. TEE- guided (1 - 5 days of pre-
treatment) or conventional cardioversion (at least three weeks of pre-treatment) strategies were 
employed. The primary efficacy outcome (all stroke, transient ischaemic attack, non-CNS systemic 
embolism, myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiovascular death) occurred in 5 (0.5%) patients in the 
rivaroxaban group (n = 978) and 5 (1.0%) patients in the VKA group (n = 492; RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.15- 
1.73; modified ITT population). The principal safety outcome (major bleeding) occurred in 6 (0.6%) 
and 4 (0.8%) patients in the rivaroxaban (n = 988) and VKA (n = 499) groups, respectively (RR 0.76; 
95% CI 0.21-2.67; safety population). This exploratory study showed comparable efficacy and safety 
between rivaroxaban and VKA treatment groups in the setting of cardioversion. 
Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement  
A randomised, open-label, multicentre study (PIONEER AF-PCI) was conducted in 2,124 patients 
with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who underwent PCI with stent placement for primary 
atherosclerotic disease to compare safety of two rivaroxaban regimens and one VKA regimen. Patients 
were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 fashion for an overall 12-month-therapy. Patients with a history of 
stroke or transient ischaemic attack were excluded.  
Group 1 received rivaroxaban 15 mg once daily (10 mg once daily in patients with creatinine 
clearance 30 – 49 ml/min) plus P2Y12 inhibitor. Group 2 received rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus 
DAPT (dual antiplatelet therapy i.e. clopidogrel 75 mg [or alternate P2Y12 inhibitor] plus low-dose 
ASA) for 1, 6 or 12 months followed by rivaroxaban 15 mg (or 10 mg for subjects with creatinine 
clearance 30 – 49 ml/min) once daily plus low-dose ASA. Group 3 received dose-adjusted VKA plus 
DAPT for 1, 6 or 12 months followed by dose-adjusted VKA plus low-dose acetylsalicylic acid.  
The primary safety endpoint, clinically significant bleeding events, occurred in 109 (15.7%), 117 
(16.6%), and 167 (24.0%) subjects in group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively (HR 0.59; 95% CI 
0.47-0.76; p<0.001, and HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.50-0.80; p<0.001, respectively). The secondary endpoint 
(composite of cardiovascular events CV death, MI, or stroke) occurred in 41 (5.9%), 36 (5.1%), and 
36 (5.2%) subjects in the group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively. Each of the rivaroxaban 
regimens showed a significant reduction in clinically significant bleeding events compared to the 
102 
 
 
 
 
VKA regimen in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who underwent a PCI with stent 
placement. 
The primary objective of PIONEER AF-PCI was to assess safety. Data on efficacy (including 
thromboembolic events) in this population are limited.  
Treatment of DVT, PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE  
The rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban in the 
initial and continued treatment of acute DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence.  
Over 12,800 patients were studied in four randomised controlled phase III clinical studies (Einstein 
DVT, Einstein PE, Einstein Extension and Einstein Choice) and additionally a predefined pooled 
analysis of the Einstein DVT and Einstein PE studies was conducted. The overall combined treatment 
duration in all studies was up to 21 months. 
In Einstein DVT 3,449 patients with acute DVT were studied for the treatment of DVT and the 
prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (patients who presented with symptomatic PE were excluded 
from this study). The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical 
judgement of the investigator.  
For the initial 3 week treatment of acute DVT 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily. This 
was followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  
In Einstein PE, 4,832 patients with acute PE were studied for the treatment of PE and the prevention of 
recurrent DVT and PE. The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical 
judgement of the investigator.  
For the initial treatment of acute PE 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily for three weeks. 
This was followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  
In both the Einstein DVT and the Einstein PE study, the comparator treatment regimen consisted of 
enoxaparin administered for at least 5 days in combination with vitamin K antagonist treatment until 
the PT/INR was in therapeutic range (≥ 2.0). Treatment was continued with a vitamin K antagonist 
dose-adjusted to maintain the PT/INR values within the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0. 
In Einstein Extension 1,197 patients with DVT or PE were studied for the prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE. The treatment duration was for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had 
completed 6 to 12 months of treatment for VTE depending on the clinical judgment of the 
investigator. Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily was compared with placebo.  
Einstein DVT, PE and Extension used the same pre-defined primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. 
The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent 
DVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. The secondary efficacy outcome was defined as the composite of 
recurrent DVT, non-fatal PE and all-cause mortality.  
In Einstein Choice, 3,396 patients with confirmed symptomatic DVT and/or PE who completed 6-12 
months of anticoagulant treatment were studied for the prevention of fatal PE or non-fatal 
symptomatic recurrent DVT or PE. Patients with an indication for continued therapeutic-dosed 
anticoagulation were excluded from the study. The treatment duration was up to 12 months depending 
on the individual randomisation date (median: 351 days). Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily and 
rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily were compared with 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid once daily.  
The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent 
DVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. 
In the Einstein DVT study (see Table 6) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to 
enoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p < 0.0001 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 0.680 
(0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 (test for superiority)). The prespecified net clinical benefit (primary efficacy 
outcome plus major bleeding events) was reported with a HR of 0.67 ((95% CI: 0.47 - 0.95), nominal 
p -value p=0.027) in favour of rivaroxaban. INR values were within the therapeutic range a mean of 
60.3% of the time for the mean treatment duration of 189 days, and 55.4%, 60.1%, and 62.8% of the 
time in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended treatment duration groups, respectively. In the 
103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation between the level of mean centre TTR (Time in 
Target INR Range of 2.0 - 3.0) in the equally sized tertiles and the incidence of the recurrent VTE 
(p=0.932 for interaction). Within the highest tertile according to centre, the HR with rivaroxaban 
versus warfarin was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.35 - 1.35).  
The incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding 
events) as well as the secondary safety outcome (major bleeding events) were similar for both 
treatment groups.

In the Einstein PE study (see Table 7) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to 
enoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p=0.0026 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 1.123 
(0.749 - 1.684)). The prespecified net clinical benefit (primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding 
events) was reported with a HR of 0.849 ((95% CI: 0.633 - 1.139), nominal p -value p=0.275). INR 
values were within the therapeutic range a mean of 63% of the time for the mean treatment duration of 
215 days, and 57%, 62%, and 65% of the time in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended treatment duration 
groups, respectively. In the enoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation between the level of 
mean centre TTR (Time in Target INR Range of 2.0 - 3.0) in the equally sized tertiles and the

centre, the HR with rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.642 (95% CI: 0.277 - 1.484). 
The incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding 
events) were slightly lower in the rivaroxaban treatment group (10.3% (249/2412)) than in the 
enoxaparin/VKA treatment group (11.4% (274/2405)). The incidence of the secondary safety outcome 
(major bleeding events) was lower in the rivaroxaban group (1.1% (26/2412)) than in the 
enoxaparin/VKA group (2.2% (52/2405)) with a HR 0.493 (95% CI: 0.308 - 0.789).

In the Einstein Extension study (see Table 9) rivaroxaban was superior to placebo for the primary and 
secondary efficacy outcomes. For the primary safety outcome (major bleeding events) there was a 
non-significant numerically higher incidence rate for patients treated with rivaroxaban 20 mg once

In addition to the phase III EINSTEIN programme, a prospective, non-interventional, open-label 
cohort study (XALIA) with central outcome adjudication including recurrent VTE, major bleeding and 
death has been conducted. 5,142 patients with acute DVT were enrolled to investigate the long-term 
safety of rivaroxaban compared with standard-of-care anticoagulation therapy in clinical practice. 
Rates of major bleeding, recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality for rivaroxaban were 0.7%, 1.4% and 
0.5%, respectively. There were differences in patient baseline characteristics including age, cancer and 
renal impairment. A pre-specified propensity score stratified analysis was used to adjust for measured 
baseline differences but residual confounding may, in spite of this, influence the results. Adjusted HRs 
comparing rivaroxaban and standard-of-care for major bleeding, recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality 
were 0.77 (95% CI 0.40 - 1.50), 0.91 (95% CI 0.54 - 1.54) and 0.51 (95% CI 0.24 - 1.07), respectively.  
These results in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this indication. 
Paediatric population  
Treatment of VTE and prevention of VTE recurrence in paediatric patients 
A total of 727 children with confirmed acute VTE, of whom 528 received rivaroxaban, were studied in 
6 open-label, multicentre paediatric studies. Body weight-adjusted dosing in patients from birth to less 
than 18 years resulted in rivaroxaban exposure similar to that observed in adult DVT patients treated 
with rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily as confirmed in the phase III study (see section 5.2). 
The EINSTEIN Junior phase III study was a randomised, active-controlled, open-label multicentre 
clinical study in 500 paediatric patients (aged from birth to < 18 years) with confirmed acute VTE.  
There were 276 children aged 12 to < 18 years, 101 children aged 6 to < 12 years, 69 children aged 2 
to < 6 years, and 54 children aged < 2 years. 
Index VTE was classified as either central venous catheter-related VTE (CVC-VTE; 90/335 patients 
in the rivaroxaban group, 37/165 patients in the comparator group), cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis 
(CVST; 74/335 patients in the rivaroxaban group, 43/165 patients in the comparator group), and all 
others including DVT and PE (non-CVC-VTE; 171/335 patients in the rivaroxaban group, 85/165 
patients in the comparator group). The most common presentation of index thrombosis in children 
aged 12 to < 18 years was non-CVC-VTE in 211 (76.4%); in children aged 6 to < 12 years and aged 
2 to < 6 years was CVST in 48 (47.5%) and 35 (50.7%), respectively; and in children aged < 2 years 
was CVC-VTE in 37 (68.5%). There were no children < 6 months with CVST in the rivaroxaban 
group. 22 of the patients with CVST had a CNS infection (13 patients in the rivaroxaban group and 9 
patients in comparator group).  
VTE was provoked by persistent, transient, or both persistent and transient risk factors in 438 (87.6%) 
children. 
Patients received initial treatment with therapeutic doses of UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux for at least 
5 days, and were randomised 2:1 to receive either body weight-adjusted doses of rivaroxaban or 
comparator group (heparins, VKA) for a main study treatment period of 3 months (1 month for 
children < 2 years with CVC-VTE). At the end of the main study treatment period, the diagnostic 
imaging test, which was obtained at baseline, was repeated, if clinically feasible. The study treatment 
could be stopped at this point, or at the discretion of the Investigator continued for up to 12 months 
(for children < 2 years with CVC-VTE up to 3 months) in total.  
The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE. The primary safety outcome was the 
composite of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB). All efficacy and 
safety outcomes were centrally adjudicated by an independent committee blinded for treatment 
allocation. The efficacy and safety results are shown in Tables 11 and 12 below.  
Recurrent VTEs occurred in the rivaroxaban group in 4 of 335 patients and in the comparator group in  
107 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
5 of 165 patients. The composite of major bleeding and CRNMB was reported in 10 of 329 patients 
(3%) treated with rivaroxaban and in 3 of 162 patients (1.9%) treated with comparator. Net clinical 
benefit (symptomatic recurrent VTE plus major bleeding events) was reported in the rivaroxaban 
group in 4 of 335 patients and in the comparator group in 7 of 165 patients. Normalisation of the 
thrombus burden on repeat imaging occurred in 128 of 335 patients with rivaroxaban treatment and in 
43 of 165 patients in the comparator group. These findings were generally similar among age groups. 
There were 119 (36.2%) children with any treatment-emergent bleeding in the rivaroxaban group and 
45 (27.8%) children in the comparator group.

study medicinal product.   
The efficacy and safety profile of rivaroxaban was largely similar between the paediatric VTE 
population and the DVT/PE adult population, however, the proportion of subjects with any bleeding 
was higher in the paediatric VTE population as compared to the DVT/PE adult population.  
Patients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome  
In an investigator sponsored, randomised open-label multicentre study with blinded endpoint 
adjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, 
108 
 
  
 
  
 
  
  
 
diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for all 
3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I 
antibodies). The study was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of 120 patients due to an excess 
of events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was 569 days. 59 patients were 
randomised to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <50 mL/min) 
and 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in 12% of patients randomised to 
rivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No events were reported in patients 
randomised to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) of the rivaroxaban group and 2 
patients (3%) of the warfarin group.  
Paediatric population  
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
rivaroxaban in all subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of thromboembolic events (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption  
The following information is based on the data obtained in adults. 
Rivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 2 – 4 hours after 
tablet intake.  
Oral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80 - 100%) for the 
2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions. Intake with food does not affect 
rivaroxaban AUC or Cmax at the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose.  
Due to a reduced extent of absorption an oral bioavailability of 66% was determined for the 20 mg 
tablet under fasting conditions. When rivaroxaban 20 mg tablets are taken together with food increases 
in mean AUC by 39% were observed when compared to tablet intake under fasting conditions, 
indicating almost complete absorption and high oral bioavailability. Rivaroxaban 15 mg and 20 mg are 
to be taken with food (see section 4.2).  
Rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg once daily in fasting state. 
Under fed conditions rivaroxaban 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg tablets demonstrated dose-proportionality. 
At higher doses rivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased bioavailability and 
decreased absorption rate with increased dose.  
Variability in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual variability (CV%) 
ranging from 30% to 40%.  
Absorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29% 
and 56% decrease in AUC and Cmax compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is 
released in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in 
the distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the 
stomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban 
exposure.  
Bioavailability (AUC and Cmax) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a 
crushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube 
followed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional 
pharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable 
to lower rivaroxaban doses.  
Paediatric population  
Children received rivaroxaban tablet or oral suspension during or closely after feeding or food intake 
and with a typical serving of liquid to ensure reliable dosing in children. As in adults, rivaroxaban is 
readily absorbed after oral administration as tablet or granules for oral suspension formulation in 
children. No difference in the absorption rate nor in the extent of absorption between the tablet and 
granules for oral suspension formulation was observed. No PK data following intravenous 
administration to children are available so that the absolute bioavailability of rivaroxaban in children is 
unknown. A decrease in the relative bioavailability for increasing doses (in mg/kg bodyweight) was 
found, suggesting absorption limitations for higher doses, even when taken together with food. 
Rivaroxaban 20 mg tablets should be taken with feeding or with food (see section 4.2). 
109 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution  
Plasma protein binding in adults is high at approximately 92% to 95%, with serum albumin being the 
main binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with Vss being approximately 
50 litres.  
Paediatric population  
No data on rivaroxaban plasma protein binding specific to children is available. No PK data following 
intravenous administration of rivaroxaban to children is available. Vss estimated via population PK 
modelling in children (age range 0 to < 18 years) following oral administration of rivaroxaban is 
dependent on body weight and can be described with an allometric function, with an average of 113 L 
for a subject with a body weight of 82.8 kg.  
Biotransformation and elimination  
In adults, of the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, 
with half then being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 
of the administered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, 
mainly via active renal secretion.  
Rivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative 
degradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of 
biotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter 
proteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein).  
Unchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active 
circulating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be 
classified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the 
elimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption 
rate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in 
young individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly.  
Paediatric population  
No metabolism data specific to children is available. No PK data following intravenous administration 
of rivaroxaban to children is available. CL estimated via population PK modelling in children (age 
range 0 to < 18 years) following oral administration of rivaroxaban is dependent on body weight and 
can be described with an allometric function, with an average of 8 L/h for a subject with body weight 
of 82.8 kg. The geometric mean values for disposition half-lives (t1/2) estimated via population PK 
modelling decrease with decreasing age and ranged from 4.2 h in adolescents to approximately 3 h in 
children aged 2-12 years down to 1.9 and 1.6 h in children aged 0.5-< 2 years and less than 0.5 years, 
respectively.  
Special populations 
Gender  
In adults, there were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
between male and female patients. An exploratory analysis did not reveal relevant differences in 
rivaroxaban exposure between male and female children. 
Elderly population  
Elderly patients exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with mean AUC values 
being approximately 1.5 fold higher, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total and renal clearance. No 
dose adjustment is necessary.  
Different weight categories  
In adults, extremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban 
plasma concentrations (less than 25%). No dose adjustment is necessary. 
In children, rivaroxaban is dosed based on body weight. An exploratory analysis did not reveal a 
relevant impact of underweight or obesity on rivaroxaban exposure in children. 
110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inter-ethnic differences  
In adults, no clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, 
Hispanic, Japanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics.  
An exploratory analysis did not reveal relevant inter-ethnic differences in rivaroxaban exposure among 
Japanese, Chinese or Asian children outside Japan and China compared to the respective overall 
paediatric population.  
Hepatic impairment  
Cirrhotic adult patients with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only 
minor changes in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics (1.2 fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), 
nearly comparable to their matched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (classified as Child Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by 2.3 
fold compared to healthy volunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6 fold. These patients also had 
reduced renal elimination of rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. There 
are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  
The inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor 
of 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a 
steeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT.  
Rivaroxaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and 
clinically relevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 
4.3).  
No clinical data is available in children with hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment 
In adults, there was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as 
assessed via creatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 50 – 
80 ml/min), moderate (creatinine clearance 30 – 49 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15 – 
29 ml/min) renal impairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 and 
1.6 fold respectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced. In 
individuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of factor Xa 
activity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy volunteers; 
prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. There are no 
data in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min.  
Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable.  
Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. Rivaroxaban is to be used 
with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 – 29 ml/min (see section 4.4). 
No clinical data is available in children 1 year or older with moderate or severe renal impairment 
(glomerular filtration rate < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2).  
Pharmacokinetic data in patients  
In patients receiving rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily for treatment of acute DVT the geometric mean 
concentration (90% prediction interval) 2 – 4 h and about 24 h after dose (roughly representing 
maximum and minimum concentrations during the dose interval) was 215 (22 - 535) and 32 (6 - 239) 
mcg/l, respectively.  
In paediatric patients with acute VTE receiving body weight-adjusted rivaroxaban leading to an 
exposure similar to that in adult DVT patients receiving a 20 mg once daily dose, the geometric mean 
concentrations (90% interval) at sampling time intervals roughly representing maximum and minimum 
concentrations during the dose interval are summarised in Table 13.

Values below lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were substituted by 1/2 LLOQ for the calculation 
of statistics (LLOQ = 0.5 mcg/L).  
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship  
The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between rivaroxaban plasma 
concentration and several PD endpoints (factor Xa inhibition, PT, aPTT, Heptest) has been evaluated 
after administration of a wide range of doses (5 – 30 mg twice a day). The relationship between 
rivaroxaban concentration and factor Xa activity was best described by an Emax model. For PT, the 
linear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents 
used, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and 
the slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcg/l). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were 
consistent with the data established in healthy subjects.  
Paediatric population  
Safety and efficacy have not been established in the indication prevention of stroke and systemic 
embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation for children and adolescents up to 18 years. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile 
toxicity.  
Effects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic 
activity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant 
exposure levels.  
In rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive 
toxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic 
complications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, 
hepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as 
placental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre- and post-
natal study in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams. 
Rivaroxaban was tested in juvenile rats up to 3 - month treatment duration starting at postnatal day 4 
showing a non dose-related increase in periinsular haemorrhage. No evidence of target organ-specific 
toxicity was seen.

Crushing of tablets 
Rivaroxaban Viatris tablets may be crushed and suspended in 50 mL of water and administered via a 
nasogastric tube or gastric feeding tube after confirming gastric placement of the tube. Afterwards, the 
tube should be flushed with water. Since rivaroxaban absorption is dependent on the site of active 
substance release, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the stomach should be avoided, as this can 
result in reduced absorption and thereby, reduced active substance exposure. Enteral feeding is 
required immediately after administration of the 15 mg or 20 mg tablets.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE in adults. (See section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients.) 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE  
The recommended dose for the initial treatment of acute DVT or PE is 15 mg twice daily for the first 
three weeks followed by 20 mg once daily for the continued treatment and prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE. 
Short duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be considered in patients with DVT or PE 
provoked by major transient risk factors (i.e. recent major surgery or trauma). Longer duration of 
therapy should be considered in patients with provoked DVT or PE not related to major transient risk 
factors, unprovoked DVT or PE, or a history of recurrent DVT or PE.  
When extended prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated (following completion of at least 6 
months therapy for DVT or PE), the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily. In patients in whom the 
risk of recurrent DVT or PE is considered high, such as those with complicated comorbidities, or who 
115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have developed recurrent DVT or PE on extended prevention with Rivaroxaban Viatris 10 mg once 
daily, a dose of Rivaroxaban Viatris 20 mg once daily should be considered.  
The duration of therapy and dose selection should be individualised after careful assessment of the 
treatment benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4).

The 4-week treatment initiation pack of Rivaroxaban Viatris is dedicated to patients who will 
transition from 15 mg twice daily to 20 mg once daily from Day 22 onwards (see section 6.5).  
For patients with moderate or severe renal impairment where the decision has been taken for 15 mg 
once daily from Day 22 onwards, other pack sizes only containing 15 mg film-coated tablets are 
available (see dosing instructions in section “Special populations” below). 
If a dose is missed during the 15 mg twice daily treatment phase (day 1 - 21), the patient should take 
Rivaroxaban Viatris immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg Rivaroxaban Viatris per day. In this case 
two 15 mg tablets may be taken at once. The patient should continue with the regular 15 mg twice 
daily intake as recommended on the following day.  
If a dose is missed during the once daily treatment phase, the patient should take Rivaroxaban Viatris 
immediately, and continue on the following day with the once daily intake as recommended. The dose 
should not be doubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose.  
Converting from Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) to Rivaroxaban Viatris  
For patients treated for DVT, PE and prevention of recurrence, VKA treatment should be stopped and 
rivaroxaban therapy should be initiated once the International Normalised Ratio (INR) is ≤ 2.5. 
When converting patients from VKAs to Rivaroxaban Viatris, INR values will be falsely elevated 
after the intake of Rivaroxaban Viatris. The INR is not valid to measure the anticoagulant activity of 
Rivaroxaban Viatris, and therefore should not be used (see section 4.5).  
Converting from Rivaroxaban Viatris to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA)  
There is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from Rivaroxaban Viatris to 
VKA. Continuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate 
anticoagulant. It should be noted that Rivaroxaban Viatris can contribute to an elevated INR.  
In patients converting from Rivaroxaban Viatris to VKA, VKA should be given concurrently until the 
INR is ≥ 2.0. For the first two days of the conversion period, standard initial dosing of VKA should be 
used followed by VKA dosing, as guided by INR testing. While patients are on both Rivaroxaban 
Viatris and VKA the INR should not be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to 
the next dose of Rivaroxaban Viatris. Once Rivaroxaban Viatris is discontinued INR testing may be 
done reliably at least 24 hours after the last dose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Converting from parenteral anticoagulants to Rivaroxaban Viatris  
For patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, discontinue the parenteral anticoagulant 
and start Rivaroxaban Viatris 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of the 
parenteral medicinal product (e.g. low molecular weight heparins) would be due or at the time of 
discontinuation of a continuously administered parenteral medicinal product (e.g. intravenous 
unfractionated heparin).  
Converting from Rivaroxaban Viatris to parenteral anticoagulants  
Give the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next Rivaroxaban Viatris dose would be 
taken.

Special populations  
Renal impairment  
Limited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 – 29 ml/min) 
indicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased. Therefore, Rivaroxaban 
Viatris is to be used with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine 
clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  
In patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30 – 49 ml/min) or severe (creatinine clearance 15-29 
ml/min) renal impairment the following dose recommendations apply:  
-  
For the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE: patients 
should be treated with 15 mg twice daily for the first 3 weeks. Thereafter, when the 
recommended dose is 20 mg once daily, a reduction of the dose from 20 mg once daily to 15 mg 
once daily should be considered if the patient’s assessed risk for bleeding outweighs the risk for 
recurrent DVT and PE. The recommendation for the use of 15 mg is based on PK modelling and 
has not been studied in this clinical setting (see sections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).  
When the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily, no dose adjustment from the recommended 
dose is necessary.  
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
50-80 ml/min) (see section 5.2).  
Hepatic impairment  
Rivaroxaban Viatris is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy 
and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see sections 
4.3 and 5.2). 
Elderly population  
No dose adjustment (see section 5.2)  
Body weight  
No dose adjustment (see section 5.2)  
Gender  
No dose adjustment (see section 5.2)  
Paediatric population 
Rivaroxaban Viatris treatment initiation pack should not be used in children aged 0 to 18 years 
because it is specifically designed for treatment of adult patients and is not appropriate for use in 
paediatric patients.  
Method of administration  
Rivaroxaban Viatris is for oral use. 
The tablets are to be taken with food (see section 5.2). 
Crushing of tablets 
For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Rivaroxaban Viatris tablets may be crushed and 
mixed with water or apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally. After the 
administration of crushed Rivaroxaban Viatris 15 mg or 20 mg film-coated tablets, the dose should be 
immediately followed by food. 
The crushed Rivaroxaban Viatris tablets may also be given through gastric tubes (see sections 5.2 and 
6.6).  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
117 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Active clinically significant bleeding.  
Lesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current 
or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent 
brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, 
known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major 
intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities.  
Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low 
molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral 
anticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of 
switching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain 
an open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5).  
Hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic 
patients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2).  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Clinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment 
period. 
Haemorrhagic risk  
As with other anticoagulants, patients taking Rivaroxaban Viatris are to be carefully observed for 
signs of bleeding. It is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of 
haemorrhage. Rivaroxaban Viatris administration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage 
occurs (see section 4.9).  
In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary 
including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently 
during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate 
clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult 
bleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate.  
Several sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. These patients are 
to be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications and anaemia after 
initiation of treatment (see section 4.8). Any unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should 
lead to a search for a bleeding site.  
Although treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban 
levels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional 
situations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. 
overdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Renal impairment  
In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) rivaroxaban plasma levels 
may be significantly increased (1.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. 
Rivaroxaban Viatris is to be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 – 29 ml/min. 
Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  
Rivaroxaban Viatris should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment concomitantly 
receiving other medicinal products which increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (see 
section 4.5). 
Interaction with other medicinal products  
118 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The use of Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic 
treatment with azole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and 
posaconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors 
of both CYP3A4 and P-gp and therefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a 
clinically relevant degree (2.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk (see 
section 4.5). 
Care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis 
such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and 
platelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease 
an appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see section 4.5).  
Other haemorrhagic risk factors  
As with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding 
risk such as:  
• 
• 
• 
congenital or acquired bleeding disorders  
uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension  
other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding 
complications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal 
reflux disease)  
vascular retinopathy  
bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding  
• 
• 
Patients with cancer 
Patients with malignant disease may simultaneously be at higher risk of bleeding and thrombosis. The 
individual benefit of antithrombotic treatment should be weighed against risk for bleeding in patients 
with active cancer dependent on tumour location, antineoplastic therapy and stage of disease. Tumours 
located in the gastrointestinal or genito urinary tract have been associated with an increased risk of 
bleeding during rivaroxaban therapy. 
In patients with malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, the use of rivaroxaban is contraindicated 
(see section 4.3). 
Patients with prosthetic valves  
Rivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone 
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris have not 
been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that 
Rivaroxaban Viatris provides adequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with 
Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended for these patients.  
Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome  
Direct acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients 
with a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for 
patients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-
glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of 
recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.  
Haemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary 
embolectomy  
Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with 
pulmonary embolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary 
embolectomy since the safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris have not been established in these 
clinical situations.  
Spinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture   
When neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, 
patients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk 
119 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. 
The risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or 
the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by 
traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and 
symptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder 
dysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior 
to neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in 
anticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. There is no clinical 
experience with the use of 15 mg or 20 mg rivaroxaban in these situations.  
To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and 
neuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of 
rivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when 
the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low. However, the exact timing to reach a 
sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known.  
For the removal of an epidural catheter and based on the general PK characteristics at least 2x half-
life, i.e. at least 18 hours in young patients and 26 hours in elderly patients should elapse after the last 
administration of rivaroxaban (see section 5.2). Following removal of the catheter, at least 6 hours 
should elapse before the next rivaroxaban dose is administered.  
If traumatic puncture occurs the administration of rivaroxaban is to be delayed for 24 hours. 
Dosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention  
If an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Rivaroxaban Viatris 15 mg/20 mg should 
be stopped at least 24 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of 
the physician. If the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed 
against the urgency of the intervention.  
Rivaroxaban Viatris should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical 
intervention provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as 
determined by the treating physician (see section 5.2). 
Elderly population  
Increasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). 
Dermatological reactions  
Serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS 
syndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of 
rivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the 
course of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of 
treatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. 
spreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal 
lesions.  
Information about excipients 
Rivaroxaban Viatris contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, 
total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors  
Co-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a 
day) led to a 2.6 fold / 2.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7 fold / 1.6 fold increase in 
mean rivaroxaban Cmax, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an 
increased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of Rivaroxaban Viatris is not recommended in patients 
receiving concomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
voriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong 
inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4). 
120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Active substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either 
CYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. 
Clarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and 
moderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4 fold increase in 
Cmax. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be 
potentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4)  
Erythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a 1.3 
fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and Cmax. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not 
clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients.  
In subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8 fold 
increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in Cmax when compared to subjects with 
normal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0 fold 
increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in Cmax when compared to subjects with 
normal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see section 
4.4).  
Fluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4 fold 
increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3 fold increase in mean Cmax. The interaction with 
fluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-
risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4) 
Given the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should 
be avoided. 
Anticoagulants  
After combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single 
dose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on 
clotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban.  
Due to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any 
other anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
NSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors  
No clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of 
rivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more 
pronounced pharmacodynamic response.  
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when 
rivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid.  
Clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a 
pharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was 
observed in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or 
GPIIb/IIIa receptor levels.  
Care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) 
and platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding 
risk (see section 4.4). 
SSRIs/SNRIs  
As with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in 
case of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When 
concomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or non-
major clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. 
Warfarin  
Converting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or 
from rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) 
121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
more than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, 
inhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive.  
If it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, anti-
factor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On the 
fourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa activity 
and ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban.  
If it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR 
measurement can be used at the Ctrough of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of 
rivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point.  
No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. 
CYP3A4 inducers  
Co-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate 
50% decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The 
concomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital or St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban 
plasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be 
avoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis.  
Other concomitant therapies  
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when 
rivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), 
atorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban 
neither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4.  
Laboratory parameters  
Clotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, Hep test) are affected as expected by the mode of action of 
rivaroxaban (see section 5.1). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy  
Safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, 
the intrinsic risk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, Rivaroxaban 
Viatris is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3).  
Women of child-bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with rivaroxaban.  
Breast-feeding  
Safety and efficacy of Rivaroxaban Viatris have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data 
from animals indicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore Rivaroxaban Viatris is 
contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to 
discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from therapy.  
Fertility  
No specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In 
a study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Rivaroxaban Viatris has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions 
like syncope (frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see 
section 4.8). Patients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines.

A pre-specified selective approach to adverse event collection was applied in selected phase III 
studies. The incidence of adverse reactions did not increase and no new adverse drug reaction 
was identified after analysis of these studies. 
Description of selected adverse reactions  
Due to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of Rivaroxaban Viatris may be associated with an 
increased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post 
haemorrhagic anaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary 
according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 
“Management of bleeding”). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, 
gastrointestinal, genito urinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and 
anaemia were seen more frequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA 
treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of 
126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical 
relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in 
certain patient groups, e.g. those patients with uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on 
concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4 “Haemorrhagic risk”). Menstrual 
bleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. Haemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, 
paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some 
cases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of cardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris 
have been observed. 
Known complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure 
due to hypoperfusion, or anticoagulant-related nephropathy have been reported for Rivaroxaban 
Viatris. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to be considered in evaluating the condition in 
any anticoagulated patient.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Rare cases of overdose up to 1,960 mg have been reported. In case of overdose, the patient should be 
observed carefully for bleeding complications or other adverse reactions (see section “Management of 
bleeding”). Due to limited absorption a ceiling effect with no further increase in average plasma 
exposure is expected at supratherapeutic doses of 50 mg rivaroxaban or above.  
A specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is 
available (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of andexanet alfa).  
The use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered. 
Management of bleeding  
Should a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban 
administration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has 
a half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours (see section 5.2). Management should be individualised 
according to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate symptomatic treatment could 
be used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe epistaxis), surgical haemostasis 
with bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and haemodynamic support, blood products 
(packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on associated anaemia or coagulopathy) or 
platelets.  
If bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, either the administration of a specific factor 
Xa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet alfa), which antagonises the pharmacodynamic effect of 
rivaroxaban, or a specific procoagulant agent, such as prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), 
activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa), should be 
considered. However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of these 
medicinal products in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. The recommendation is also based on limited 
non-clinical data. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa shall be considered and titrated depending on 
improvement of bleeding. Depending on local availability, a consultation with a coagulation expert 
should be considered in case of major bleedings (see section 5.1).  
Protamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. 
There is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and 
aprotinin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor 
experience with the use of the systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving 
rivaroxaban. Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01  
Mechanism of action  
Rivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of 
factor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting 
both thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin 
(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. 
Pharmacodynamic effects  
Dose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is 
influenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations 
(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. 
The readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR is only calibrated and validated for 
coumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant.  
In patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence, the 5/95 
percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 2 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the time of maximum effect) for 
15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily ranged from 17 to 32 s and for 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily from 15 
to 30 s. At trough (8 - 16 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles for 15 mg twice daily ranged from 
14 to 24 s and for 20 mg once daily (18 - 30 h after tablet intake) from 13 to 20 s.  
In patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation receiving rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and 
systemic embolism, the 5/95 percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 1 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the 
time of maximum effect) in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged from 14 to 40 s and in 
patients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 10 to 50 s. At trough (16 
- 36 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged from 12 
to 26 s and in patients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 12 to 26 s.  
In a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult 
subjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC 
(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC 
reduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to 
reductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC 
had a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation 
than the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9).  
The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and Hep test are also prolonged dose-dependently; 
however, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no 
need for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical routine. 
However, if clinically indicated rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated quantitative anti-
factor Xa tests (see section 5.2).  
Clinical efficacy and safety  
Treatment of DVT, PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE  
The rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban in the 
initial and continued treatment of acute DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence.  
Over 12,800 patients were studied in four randomised controlled phase III clinical studies (Einstein 
DVT, Einstein PE, Einstein Extension and Einstein Choice) and additionally a predefined pooled 
analysis of the Einstein DVT and Einstein PE studies was conducted. The overall combined treatment 
duration in all studies was up to 21 months. 
In Einstein DVT 3,449 patients with acute DVT were studied for the treatment of DVT and the 
prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (patients who presented with symptomatic PE were excluded 
from this study). The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical 
judgement of the investigator.  
For the initial 3 week treatment of acute DVT 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily. This 
was followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  
128 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
In Einstein PE, 4,832 patients with acute PE were studied for the treatment of PE and the prevention of 
recurrent DVT and PE. The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical 
judgement of the investigator.  
For the initial treatment of acute PE 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily for three weeks. 
This was followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  
In both the Einstein DVT and the Einstein PE study, the comparator treatment regimen consisted of 
enoxaparin administered for at least 5 days in combination with vitamin K antagonist treatment until 
the PT/INR was in therapeutic range (≥ 2.0). Treatment was continued with a vitamin K antagonist 
dose-adjusted to maintain the PT/INR values within the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0. 
In Einstein Extension 1,197 patients with DVT or PE were studied for the prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE. The treatment duration was for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had 
completed 6 to 12 months of treatment for VTE depending on the clinical judgment of the 
investigator. Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily was compared with placebo.  
Einstein DVT, PE and Extension used the same pre-defined primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. 
The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent 
DVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. The secondary efficacy outcome was defined as the composite of 
recurrent DVT, non-fatal PE and all-cause mortality.  
In Einstein Choice, 3,396 patients with confirmed symptomatic DVT and/or PE who completed 6-12 
months of anticoagulant treatment were studied for the prevention of fatal PE or non-fatal 
symptomatic recurrent DVT or PE. Patients with an indication for continued therapeutic-dosed 
anticoagulation were excluded from the study. The treatment duration was up to 12 months depending 
on the individual randomisation date (median: 351 days). Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily and 
rivaroxaban 10 mg  once daily were compared with 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid once daily.  
The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent 
DVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. 
In the Einstein DVT study (see Table 4) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to 
enoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p < 0.0001 (test for non-inferiority); Hazard Ratio 
(HR): 0.680 (0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 (test for superiority)). The prespecified net clinical benefit 
(primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding events) was reported with a HR of 0.67 ((95% CI: 0.47 
- 0.95), nominal p-value p=0.027) in favour of rivaroxaban. INR values were within the therapeutic 
range a mean of 60.3% of the time for the mean treatment duration of 189 days, and 55.4%, 60.1%, 
and 62.8% of the time in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended treatment duration groups, respectively. In 
the enoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation between the level of mean centre TTR (Time 
in Target INR Range of 2.0 - 3.0) in the equally sized tertiles and the incidence of the recurrent VTE 
(P=0.932 for interaction). Within the highest tertile according to centre, the HR with rivaroxaban 
versus warfarin was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.35 - 1.35).  
The incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding 
events) as well as the secondary safety outcome (major bleeding events) were similar for both 
treatment groups.

In the Einstein PE study (see Table 5) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to 
enoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p=0.0026 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 1.123 
(0.749 - 1.684)). The prespecified net clinical benefit (primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding 
events) was reported with a HR of 0.849 ((95% CI: 0.633 - 1.139), nominal p-value p=0.275). INR 
values were within the therapeutic range a mean of 63% of the time for the mean treatment duration of 
215 days, and 57%, 62%, and 65% of the time in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended treatment duration 
groups, respectively. In the enoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation between the level of

centre, the HR with rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.642 (95% CI: 0.277 - 1.484). 
The incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding 
events) were slightly lower in the rivaroxaban treatment group (10.3% (249/2412)) than in the 
enoxaparin/VKA treatment group (11.4% (274/2405)). The incidence of the secondary safety outcome 
(major bleeding events) was lower in the rivaroxaban group (1.1% (26/2412)) than in the

In addition to the phase III EINSTEIN programme, a prospective, non-interventional, open-label 
cohort study (XALIA) with central outcome adjudication including recurrent VTE, major bleeding and 
death has been conducted. 5,142 patients with acute DVT were enrolled to investigate the long-term 
safety of rivaroxaban compared with standard-of-care anticoagulation therapy in clinical practice. 
Rates of major bleeding, recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality for rivaroxaban were 0.7%, 1.4% and 
0.5%, respectively. There were differences in patient baseline characteristics including age, cancer and 
renal impairment. A pre-specified propensity score stratified analysis was used to adjust for measured 
baseline differences but residual confounding may, in spite of this, influence the results. Adjusted HRs 
comparing rivaroxaban and standard-of-care for major bleeding, recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality 
were 0.77 (95% CI 0.40 - 1.50), 0.91 (95% CI 0.54 - 1.54) and 0.51 (95% CI 0.24 - 1.07), respectively.  
These results in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this indication. 
Patients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome  
In an investigator sponsored, randomised open-label multicentre study with blinded endpoint 
adjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, 
diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for all 
3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I 
antibodies). The study was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of 120 patients due to an excess 
132 
 
 
 
 
of events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was 569 days. 59 patients were 
randomised to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <50 mL/min) 
and 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in 12% of patients randomised to 
rivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No events were reported in patients 
randomised to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) of the rivaroxaban group and 2 
patients (3%) of the warfarin group.  
Paediatric population  
Rivaroxaban Viatris treatment initiation pack is specifically designed for treatment of adult patients 
and is not appropriate for use in paediatric patients. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption  
Rivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 2 - 4 hours after 
tablet intake.  
Oral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80 - 100%) for the 
2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions. Intake with food does not affect 
rivaroxaban AUC or Cmax at the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose.  
Due to a reduced extent of absorption an oral bioavailability of 66% was determined for the 20 mg 
tablet under fasting conditions. When rivaroxaban 20 mg tablets are taken together with food increases 
in mean AUC by 39% were observed when compared to tablet intake under fasting conditions, 
indicating almost complete absorption and high oral bioavailability. Rivaroxaban 15 mg and 20 mg are 
to be taken with food (see section 4.2).  
Rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg once daily in fasting state. 
Under fed conditions rivaroxaban 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg tablets demonstrated dose-proportionality. 
At higher doses rivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased bioavailability and 
decreased absorption rate with increased dose.  
Variability in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual variability (CV%) 
ranging from 30% to 40%.  
Absorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29% 
and 56% decrease in AUC and Cmax compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is 
released in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in 
the distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the 
stomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban 
exposure.  
Bioavailability (AUC and Cmax) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a 
crushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube 
followed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional 
pharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable 
to lower rivaroxaban doses.  
Distribution  
Plasma protein binding in humans is high at approximately 92% to 95%, with serum albumin being 
the main binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with Vss being approximately 
50 litres.  
Biotransformation and elimination  
Of the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, with half 
then being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 of the 
administered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, mainly 
via active renal secretion.  
Rivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative 
degradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of 
biotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter 
proteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein).  
133 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Unchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active 
circulating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be 
classified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the 
elimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption 
rate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in 
young individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly.  
Special populations 
Gender  
There were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between 
male and female patients.  
Elderly population  
Elderly patients exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with mean AUC values 
being approximately 1.5 fold higher, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total and renal clearance. No 
dose adjustment is necessary.  
Different weight categories  
Extremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban plasma 
concentrations (less than 25%). No dose adjustment is necessary. 
Inter-ethnic differences  
No clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, 
Japanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics.  
Hepatic impairment  
Cirrhotic patients with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only minor 
changes in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics (1.2 fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), nearly 
comparable to their matched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (classified as Child Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by 2.3 
fold compared to healthy volunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6 fold. These patients also had 
reduced renal elimination of rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. There 
are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  
The inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor 
of 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a 
steeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT.  
Rivaroxaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and 
clinically relevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 
4.3).  
Renal impairment 
There was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via 
creatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 50 – 80 ml/min), 
moderate (creatinine clearance 30 – 49 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min) renal 
impairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 fold 
respectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced. In 
individuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of factor Xa 
activity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy volunteers; 
prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. There are no 
data in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min.  
Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable.  
Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. Rivaroxaban is to be used 
with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 – 29 ml/min (see section 4.4). 
Pharmacokinetic data in patients  
134 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients receiving rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily for treatment of acute DVT the geometric mean 
concentration (90% prediction interval) 2 – 4 h and about 24 h after dose (roughly representing 
maximum and minimum concentrations during the dose interval) was 215 (22 - 535) and 32 (6 - 
239) mcg/l, respectively.  
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship  
The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between rivaroxaban plasma 
concentration and several PD endpoints (factor Xa inhibition, PT, aPTT, Heptest) has been evaluated 
after administration of a wide range of doses (5 – 30 mg twice a day). The relationship between 
rivaroxaban concentration and factor Xa activity was best described by an Emax model. For PT, the 
linear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents 
used, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and 
the slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcg/l). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were 
consistent with the data established in healthy subjects.  
Paediatric population  
Rivaroxaban Viatris treatment initiation pack is specifically designed for treatment of adult patients 
and is not appropriate for use in paediatric patients.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile 
toxicity.  
Effects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic 
activity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant 
exposure levels.  
In rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive 
toxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic 
complications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, 
hepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as 
placental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre- and post-
natal study in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams.

Crushing of tablets 
Rivaroxaban Viatris tablets may be crushed and suspended in 50 mL of water and administered via a 
nasogastric tube or gastric feeding tube after confirming gastric placement of the tube. Afterwards, the 
tube should be flushed with water. Since rivaroxaban absorption is dependent on the site of active 
substance release, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the stomach should be avoided, as this can 
result in reduced absorption and thereby, reduced active substance exposure. Enteral feeding is 
required immediately after administration of the 15 mg or 20 mg tablets.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Rivaroxaban Viatris is and what it is used for 
You have been given Rivaroxaban Viatris because  
- 
you have been diagnosed with an acute coronary syndrome (a group of conditions that includes 
heart attack and unstable angina, a severe type of chest pain) and have been shown to have had 
an increase in certain cardiac blood tests. Rivaroxaban Viatris reduces the risk in adults of 
having another heart attack or reduces the risk of dying from a disease related to your heart or 
your blood vessels. Rivaroxaban Viatris will not be given to you on its own. Your doctor will 
also tell you to take either:  
• 
• 
acetylsalicylic acid or  
acetylsalicylic acid plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine.  
or  
- 
you have been diagnosed with a high risk of getting a blood clot due to a coronary artery disease 
or peripheral artery disease which causes symptoms.  
Rivaroxaban Viatris reduces the risk in adults of getting blot clots (atherothrombotic events). 
Rivaroxaban Viatris will not be given to you on its own. Your doctor will also tell you to take 
acetylsalicylic acid. 
In some cases, if you get Rivaroxaban Viatris after a procedure to open a narrowed or closed 
artery of your leg to restore blood flow, your doctor may also prescribe clopidogrel for you to 
take in addition to acetylsalicylic acid for a short while. 
Rivaroxaban Viatris contains the active substance rivaroxaban and belongs to a group of medicines 
called antithrombotic agents. It works by blocking a blood clotting factor (factor Xa) and thus 
reducing the tendency of the blood to form clots.

if you are allergic to rivaroxaban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6)  
if you are bleeding excessively  
if you have a disease or condition in an organ of the body that increases the risk of serious 
bleeding (e.g. stomach ulcer, injury or bleeding in the brain, recent surgery of the brain or eyes)  
if you are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban or 
heparin), except when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin through a 
venous or arterial line to keep it open  
if you have an acute coronary syndrome and previously had a bleeding or a blood clot in your 
brain (stroke)  
if you have coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease and previously had a bleeding in 
your brain (stroke) or where there was a blockage of the small arteries providing blood to the 
brain’s deep tissues (lacunar stroke) or if you had a blood clot in your brain (ischaemic, non-
lacunar stroke) in the previous month  
if you have a liver disease which leads to an increased risk of bleeding  
if you are pregnant or breast-feeding  
Do not take Rivaroxaban Viatris and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rivaroxaban Viatris. 
Rivaroxaban Viatris should not be used in combination with certain other medicines which reduce 
blood clotting such as prasugrel or ticagrelor other than acetylsalicylic acid and 
clopidogrel/ticlopidine.

3. 
How to take Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure.  
How much to take  
The recommended dose is one 2.5 mg tablet twice a day. Take Rivaroxaban Viatris around the same 
time every day (for example, one tablet in the morning and one in the evening). This medicine can be 
taken with or without food.  
If you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take 
Rivaroxaban Viatris. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or apple puree immediately 
before you take it.  
If necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed Rivaroxaban Viatris tablet through a stomach 
tube.  
Rivaroxaban Viatris will not be given to you on its own.  
Your doctor will also tell you to take acetylsalicylic acid. If you get Rivaroxaban Viatris after an acute 
coronary syndrome, your doctor may tell you to also take clopidogrel or ticlopidine.  
If you get Rivaroxaban Viatris after a procedure to open a narrowed or closed artery of your leg to 
restore blood flow, your doctor may also prescribe clopidogrel for you to take in addition to 
acetylsalicylic acid for a short while. 
Your doctor will tell you how much of these to take (usually between 75 to 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid 
daily or a daily dose of 75 to 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid plus a daily dose of either 75 mg clopidogrel 
or a standard daily dose of ticlopidine). 
When to start Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Treatment with Rivaroxaban Viatris after an acute coronary syndrome should be started as soon as 
possible after stabilisation of the acute coronary syndrome, at the earliest 24 hours after admission to 
hospital and at the time when parenteral (via injection) anticoagulation therapy would normally be 
stopped.  
Your doctor will tell you when to start treatment with Rivaroxaban Viatris if you have been diagnosed 
with coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease.  
Your doctor will decide how long you must continue treatment.  
If you take more Rivaroxaban Viatris than you should 
Contact your doctor immediately if you have taken too many Rivaroxaban Viatris tablets. Taking too 
much Rivaroxaban Viatris increases the risk of bleeding. 
If you forget to take Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. If you miss a dose, take your next dose at the 
usual time. 
If you stop taking Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Take Rivaroxaban Viatris on a regular basis and for as long as your doctor keeps prescribing it.  
190 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not stop taking Rivaroxaban Viatris without talking to your doctor first. If you stop taking this 
medicine, it may increase your risk of having another heart attack or stroke or dying from a disease 
related to your heart or your blood vessels.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Rivaroxaban Viatris is and what it is used for 
Rivaroxaban Viatris contains the active substance rivaroxaban and is used in adults to  
- 
prevent blood clots in the veins after a hip or knee replacement operation. Your doctor has 
prescribed this medicine for you because after an operation you are at an increased risk of 
getting blood clots. 
treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) and in the blood vessels of 
your lungs (pulmonary embolism), and to prevent blood clots from re-occurring in the blood 
vessels of your legs and/or lungs. 
- 
Rivaroxaban Viatris belongs to a group of medicines called antithrombotic agents. It works by 
blocking a blood clotting factor (factor Xa) and thus reducing the tendency of the blood to form clots. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Do not take Rivaroxaban Viatris 
- 
if you are allergic to rivaroxaban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6)  
if you are bleeding excessively  
if you have a disease or condition in an organ of the body that increases the risk of serious 
bleeding (e.g. stomach ulcer, injury or bleeding in the brain, recent surgery of the brain or eyes)  
if you are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban or 
heparin), except when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin through a 
venous or arterial line to keep it open  
if you have a liver disease which leads to an increased risk of bleeding  
if you are pregnant or breast-feeding  
-  
-  
-  
-  
- 
Do not take Rivaroxaban Viatris and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.

Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rivaroxaban Viatris. 
Rivaroxaban Viatris  
Take special care with Rivaroxaban Viatris  
- 
if you have an increased risk of bleeding, as could be the case in situations such as:  
 
moderate or severe kidney disease, since your kidney function may affect the amount of 
medicine that works in your body  
if you are taking other medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, 
apixaban or heparin), when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin 
through a venous or arterial line to keep it open (see section “Other medicines and 
Rivaroxaban Viatris”)  
bleeding disorders  
very high blood pressure, not controlled by medical treatment  
diseases of your stomach or bowel that might result in bleeding, e.g. inflammation of the 
bowels or stomach, or inflammation of the oesophagus (gullet), e.g. due to 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (disease where stomach acid goes upwards into the 
oesophagus) or tumours located in the stomach or bowels or genital tract or urinary tract 
a problem with the blood vessels in the back of your eyes (retinopathy)  
a lung disease where your bronchi are widened and filled with pus (bronchiectasis), or 
previous bleeding from your lung  
if you have a prosthetic heart valve  
 
 
 
 
 
 
if you know that you have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the 
immune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if 
the treatment may need to be changed.  
if your doctor determines that your blood pressure is unstable or another treatment or surgical 
procedure to remove the blood clot from your lungs is planned.  
If any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before you take Rivaroxaban Viatris. Your doctor 
will decide, if you should be treated with this medicine and if you should be kept under closer 
observation. 
If you need to have an operation  
- 
it is very important to take Rivaroxaban Viatris before and after the operation exactly at the 
times you have been told by your doctor.  
If your operation involves a catheter or injection into your spinal column (e.g. for epidural or 
spinal anaesthesia or pain reduction):  
 
it is very important to take Rivaroxaban Viatris exactly at the times you have been told by 
your doctor  
tell your doctor immediately if you get numbness or weakness of your legs or problems 
with your bowel or bladder after the end of anaesthesia, because urgent care is necessary.  
 
Children and adolescents 
Rivaroxaban Viatris 10 mg tablets are not recommended for people under 18 years of age. There 
is not enough information on their use in children and adolescents. 
Other medicines and Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take  any other 
medicines including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
- 
If you are taking  
 
some medicines for fungal infections (e.g. fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole,

anti-inflammatory and pain relieving medicines (e.g. naproxen or acetylsalicylic acid)  
dronedarone, a medicine to treat abnormal heart beat  
some medicines to treat depression (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or 
serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs))  
If any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Rivaroxaban Viatris, 
because the effect of Rivaroxaban Viatris may be increased. Your doctor will decide, if you 
should be treated with this medicine and if you should be kept under closer observation.

may also use a preventative ulcer treatment.

Rivaroxaban Viatris and if you should be kept under closer observation. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not take Rivaroxaban Viatris if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If there is a chance that you 
could become pregnant, use a reliable contraceptive while you are taking Rivaroxaban Viatris. If you 
become pregnant while you are taking this medicine, tell your doctor immediately, who will decide

before taking this medicine.  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-

3. 
How to take Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure.  
How much to take  
-  
-  
To prevent blood clots in the veins after a hip or knee replacement operation  
The recommended dose is one tablet Rivaroxaban Viatris 10 mg once a day.  
To treat blood clots in the veins of your legs and blood clots in the blood vessels of your lungs, 
and for preventing blood clots from re-occurring  
After at least 6 months blood clot treatment, the recommended dose is either one 10 mg tablet 
once a day or one 20 mg tablet once a day. Your doctor has prescribed you Rivaroxaban Viatris 
10 mg once a day.  
Swallow the tablet preferably with water.  
Rivaroxaban Viatris can be taken with or without food. 
198 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take 
Rivaroxaban Viatris. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or apple puree immediately 
before you take it.  
If necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed Rivaroxaban Viatris tablet through a stomach 
tube.  
When to take Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Take the tablet every day until your doctor tells you to stop.  
Try to take the tablet at the same time every day to help you to remember it.  
Your doctor will decide how long you must continue treatment.  
To prevent blood clots in the veins after a hip or knee replacement operation:  
Take the first tablet 6 – 10 hours after your operation.  
If you have had a major hip operation you will usually take the tablets for 5 weeks.  
If you have had a major knee operation you will usually take the tablets for 2 weeks. 
If you take more Rivaroxaban Viatris than you should 
Contact your doctor immediately if you have taken too many Rivaroxaban Viatris tablets. Taking too 
much Rivaroxaban Viatris increases the risk of bleeding. 
If you forget to take Rivaroxaban Viatris 
If you have missed a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Take the next tablet on the following day 
and then carry on taking a tablet once a day as normal.  
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. 
If you stop taking Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Do not stop taking Rivaroxaban Viatris without talking to your doctor first, because Rivaroxaban 
Viatris prevents the development of a serious condition.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Rivaroxaban Viatris is and what it is used for 
Rivaroxaban Viatris contains the active substance rivaroxaban and is used in adults to  
- 
prevent blood clots in brain (stroke) and other blood vessels in your body if you have a form of 
irregular heart rhythm called non-valvular atrial fibrillation. 
treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) and in the blood vessels of 
your lungs (pulmonary embolism), and to prevent blood clots from re-occurring in the blood 
vessels of your legs and/or lungs. 
- 
Rivaroxaban Viatris is used in children and adolescents below 18 years and with a body weight of 
30 kg or more to: 
- 
treat blood clots and prevent re-occurrence of blood clots in the veins or in the blood vessels of 
the lungs, following initial treatment of at least 5 days with injectable medicines used to treat 
blood clots. 
Rivaroxaban Viatris belongs to a group of medicines called antithrombotic agents. It works by 
blocking a blood clotting factor (factor Xa) and thus reducing the tendency of the blood to form clots.

severe kidney disease, for adults, and moderate or severe kidney disease for children and 
adolescents since your kidney function may affect the amount of medicine that works in 
your body  
if you are taking other medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, 
apixaban or heparin), when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin 
through a venous or arterial line to keep it open (see section “Other medicines and 
Rivaroxaban Viatris”)  
bleeding disorders  
very high blood pressure, not controlled by medical treatment  
diseases of your stomach or bowel that might result in bleeding, e.g. inflammation of the 
bowels or stomach, or inflammation of the oesophagus (gullet), e.g. due to 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (disease where stomach acid goes upwards into the 
oesophagus) or tumours located in the stomach or bowels or genital tract or urinary tract 
a problem with the blood vessels in the back of your eyes (retinopathy)

- 
- 
it is very important to take Rivaroxaban Viatris before and after the operation exactly at the 
times you have been told by your doctor.  
If your operation involves a catheter or injection into your spinal column (e.g. for epidural or 
spinal anaesthesia or pain reduction):  
 
it is very important to take Rivaroxaban Viatris before and after the injection or removal 
of the catheter exactly at the times you have been told by your doctor

3. 
How to take Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure.  
You must take Rivaroxaban Viatris together with a meal.  
Swallow the tablet(s) preferably with water.  
If you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take 
Rivaroxaban Viatris. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or apple puree immediately 
before you take it. This mixture should be immediately followed by food.  
206 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed Rivaroxaban Viatris tablet through a stomach 
tube. 
How much to take  
Adults 
- 
To prevent blood clots in brain (stroke) and other blood vessels in your body  
The recommended dose is one tablet Rivaroxaban Viatris 20 mg once a day.  
If you have kidney problems, the dose may be reduced to one tablet Rivaroxaban Viatris 15 mg 
once a day.  
If you need a procedure to treat blocked blood vessels in your heart (called a percutaneous 
coronary intervention - PCI with an insertion of a stent), there is limited evidence to reduce the 
dose to one tablet Rivaroxaban Viatris 15 mg once a day (or to one tablet Rivaroxaban Viatris 
10 mg once a day in case your kidneys are not working properly) in addition to an antiplatelet 
medicine such as clopidogrel.  
- 
To treat blood clots in the veins of your legs and blood clots in the blood vessels of your lungs, 
and for preventing blood clots from re-occurring  
The recommended dose is one tablet Rivaroxaban Viatris 15 mg twice a day for the first 3 
weeks. For treatment after 3 weeks, the recommended dose is one tablet Rivaroxaban Viatris 
20 mg once a day.  
After at least 6 months blood clot treatment your doctor may decide to continue treatment with 
either one 10 mg tablet once a day or one 20 mg tablet once a day.  
If you have kidney problems and take one tablet Rivaroxaban Viatris 20 mg once a day, your 
doctor may decide to reduce the dose for the treatment after 3 weeks to one tablet Rivaroxaban 
Viatris 15 mg once a day if the risk for bleeding is greater than the risk for having another blood 
clot. 
Children and adolescents   
The dose of Rivaroxaban Viatris depends on the body weight, and will be calculated by the doctor.   
 
The recommended dose for children and adolescents with a body weight between 30 kg and 
less than 50 kg is one Rivaroxaban Viatris 15 mg tablet once a day.  
The recommended dose for children and adolescents with a body weight of 50 kg or more is 
one Rivaroxaban Viatris 20 mg tablet once a day.   
 
Take each Rivaroxaban Viatris dose with a drink (e.g. water or juice) during a meal. Take the tablets 
every day at approximately the same time. Consider setting an alarm to remind you. For parents or 
caregivers: please observe the child to ensure the full dose is taken. 
As the Rivaroxaban Viatris dose is based on body weight it is important to keep scheduled doctor’s 
visits because the dose may need to be adjusted as the weight changes.  
Never adjust the dose of Rivaroxaban Viatris by yourself. The doctor will adjust the dose if 
necessary.  
Do not split the tablet in an attempt to provide a fraction of a tablet dose. If a lower dose is required 
please use alternative presentations such as granules for oral suspension. For children and adolescents 
who are unable to swallow tablets whole, please use other suitable pharmaceutical forms such as 
granules for oral suspension.   
If the oral suspension is not available, you may crush the Rivaroxaban Viatris tablet and mix with 
water or apple puree immediately before taking. Take some food after taking this mixture. If 
necessary, your doctor may also give the crushed Rivaroxaban Viatris tablet through a stomach tube.  
If you spit up the dose or vomit  
• 
• 
less than 30 minutes after you have taken Rivaroxaban Viatris, take a new dose.   
more than 30 minutes after you have taken Rivaroxaban Viatris, do not take a new dose. In this 
case, take the next Rivaroxaban Viatris dose at the usual time.  
Contact the doctor if you repeatedly spit up the dose or vomit after taking Rivaroxaban Viatris.  
207 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
When to take Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Take the tablet every day until your doctor tells you to stop.  
Try to take the tablet at the same time every day to help you to remember it.  
Your doctor will decide how long you must continue treatment.  
To prevent blood clots in the brain (stroke) and other blood vessels in your body:  
If your heart beat needs to be restored to normal by a procedure called cardioversion, take 
Rivaroxaban Viatris at the times your doctor tells you. 
- 
If you forget to take Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Adults, children and adolescents: 
If you are taking one 20 mg tablet or one 15 mg tablet once a day and have missed a dose, take 
it as soon as you remember. Do not take more than one tablet in a single day to make up for a 
forgotten dose. Take the next tablet on the following day and then carry on taking one tablet 
once a day.  
- 
Adults 
If you are taking one 15 mg tablet twice a day and have missed a dose, take it as soon as you 
remember. Do not take more than two 15 mg tablets in a single day. If you forget to take a dose 
you can take two 15 mg tablets at the same time to get a total of two tablets (30 mg) on one day. 
On the following day you should carry on taking one 15 mg tablet twice a day. 
If you take more Rivaroxaban Viatris than you should  
Contact your doctor immediately if you have taken too many Rivaroxaban Viatris tablets. Taking too 
much Rivaroxaban Viatris increases the risk of bleeding.   
If you stop taking Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Do not stop taking Rivaroxaban Viatris without talking to your doctor first, because Rivaroxaban 
Viatris treats and prevents serious conditions.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Rivaroxaban Viatris is and what it is used for 
Rivaroxaban Viatris contains the active substance rivaroxaban and is used in adults to  
- 
treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) and in the blood vessels of 
your lungs (pulmonary embolism), and to prevent blood clots from re-occurring in the blood 
vessels of your legs and/or lungs. 
Rivaroxaban Viatris belongs to a group of medicines called antithrombotic agents. It works by 
blocking a blood clotting factor (factor Xa) and thus reducing the tendency of the blood to form clots. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Do not take Rivaroxaban Viatris 
- 
if you are allergic to rivaroxaban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6)  
if you are bleeding excessively  
if you have a disease or condition in an organ of the body that increases the risk of serious 
bleeding (e.g. stomach ulcer, injury or bleeding in the brain, recent surgery of the brain or eyes)  
if you are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban or 
heparin), except when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin through a 
venous or arterial line to keep it open  
if you have a liver disease which leads to an increased risk of bleeding  
if you are pregnant or breast-feeding

Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rivaroxaban Viatris. 
Take special care with Rivaroxaban Viatris  
-  
if you have an increased risk of bleeding, as could be the case in situations such as:  
 
severe kidney disease, since your kidney function may affect the amount of medicine that 
works in your body  
if you are taking other medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, 
apixaban or heparin), when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin 
through a venous or arterial line to keep it open (see section “Other medicines and 
Rivaroxaban Viatris”)  
bleeding disorders  
very high blood pressure, not controlled by medical treatment  
diseases of your stomach or bowel that might result in bleeding, e.g. inflammation of the 
bowels or stomach, or inflammation of the oesophagus (gullet), e.g. due to 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (disease where stomach acid goes upwards into the 
oesophagus) or tumours located in the stomach or bowels or genital tract or urinary tract 
a problem with the blood vessels in the back of your eyes (retinopathy)  
a lung disease where your bronchi are widened and filled with pus (bronchiectasis), or 
previous bleeding from your lung  
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
if you have a prosthetic heart valve  
if you know that you have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the 
immune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if 
the treatment may need to be changed.  
if your doctor determines that your blood pressure is unstable or another treatment or surgical 
procedure to remove the blood clot from your lungs is planned.  
If any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before you take Rivaroxaban Viatris. Your doctor 
will decide, if you should be treated with this medicine and if you should be kept under closer 
observation. 
If you need to have an operation  
- 
- 
it is very important to take Rivaroxaban Viatris before and after the operation exactly at the 
times you have been told by your doctor.  
If your operation involves a catheter or injection into your spinal column (e.g. for epidural or 
spinal anaesthesia or pain reduction):  
 
it is very important to take Rivaroxaban Viatris before and after the injection or removal of 
the catheter exactly at the times you have been told by your doctor  
tell your doctor immediately if you get numbness or weakness of your legs or problems 
with your bowel or bladder after the end of anaesthesia, because urgent care is necessary.  
 
Children and adolescents 
Rivaroxaban Viatris treatment initiation pack is not recommended for people under 18 years of 
age as it is specifically designed for initiation of treatment in adult patients and is  not appropriate for 
use in children and adolescents. 
Other medicines and Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines 
including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
- 
If you are taking  
 
some medicines for fungal infections (e.g. fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, 
posaconazole), unless they are only applied to the skin  
ketoconazole tablets (used to treat Cushing’s syndrome - when the body produces an 
excess of cortisol)

dronedarone, a medicine to treat abnormal heart beat  
some medicines to treat depression (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or 
serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs))  
If any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Rivaroxaban Viatris, 
because the effect of Rivaroxaban Viatris may be increased. Your doctor will decide, if you 
should be treated with this medicine and if you should be kept under closer observation.

 
 
some medicines for treatment of epilepsy (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital)  
St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal product used for depression  
rifampicin, an antibiotic  
If any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Rivaroxaban Viatris, because 
the effect of Rivaroxaban Viatris may be reduced. Your doctor will decide, if you should be 
treated with Rivaroxaban Viatris and if you should be kept under closer observation. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not take Rivaroxaban Viatris if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If there is a chance that you 
could become pregnant, use a reliable contraceptive while you are taking Rivaroxaban Viatris. If you 
become pregnant while you are taking this medicine, tell your doctor immediately, who will decide 
how you should be treated.

before taking this medicine.  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-

3. 
How to take Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure.  
You must take Rivaroxaban Viatris together with a meal.  
Swallow the tablet(s) preferably with water.  
If you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take 
Rivaroxaban Viatris. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or apple puree immediately 
before you take it. This mixture should be immediately followed by food.  
If necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed Rivaroxaban Viatris tablet through a stomach 
tube. 
How much to take  
216 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The recommended dose is one tablet Rivaroxaban Viatris 15 mg twice a day for the first 3 weeks. For 
treatment after 3 weeks, the recommended dose is one tablet Rivaroxaban Viatris 20 mg once a day.  
This Rivaroxaban Viatris 15 mg and 20 mg treatment initiation pack is only for the first 4 weeks of 
treatment.  
Upon completion of this pack, treatment will continue on Rivaroxaban Viatris 20 mg once daily as 
your doctor has told you.  
If you have kidney problems, your doctor may decide to reduce the dose for the treatment after 
3 weeks to one tablet Rivaroxaban Viatris 15 mg once a day if the risk for bleeding is greater than the 
risk for having another blood clot. 
When to take Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Take the tablet every day until your doctor tells you to stop.  
Try to take the tablet at the same time every day to help you to remember it.  
Your doctor will decide how long you must continue treatment.  
If you take more Rivaroxaban Viatris than you should 
Contact your doctor immediately if you have taken too many Rivaroxaban Viatris tablets. Taking too 
much Rivaroxaban Viatris increases the risk of bleeding. 
If you forget to take Rivaroxaban Viatris 
- 
- 
If you are taking one 15 mg tablet twice a day and have missed a dose, take it as soon as you 
remember. Do not take more than two 15 mg tablets in a single day. If you forget to take a dose 
you can take two 15 mg tablets at the same time to get a total of two tablets (30 mg) on one day. 
On the following day you should carry on taking one 15 mg tablet twice a day.  
If you are taking one 20 mg tablet once a day and have missed a dose, take it as soon as you 
remember. Do not take more than one tablet in a single day to make up for a forgotten dose. 
Take the next tablet on the following day and then carry on taking one tablet once a day.  
If you stop taking Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Do not stop taking Rivaroxaban Viatris without talking to your doctor first, because Rivaroxaban 
Viatris treats and prevents serious conditions.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

2.  Scientific discussion 
The concept of spondyloarthropathies (SpA) comprises a group of diseases which share common clinical 
and  genetic  features.  These  clinical  features  include  inflammation  of  the  axial  skeleton  (spine  and 
sacroiliac  joints),  peripheral  arthritis,  enthesitis,  dactylitis,  uveitis,  psoriatic  arthritis,  arthritis  associated 
with inflammatory bowel disease and reactive arthritis. The most common genetic feature is the presence 
of HLA-B27 antigen. 
SpA  can  be  classified  as  axial  SpA  or  peripheral  SpA,  depending  on  the  predominant  clinical 
manifestations. The typical clinical symptom for axial SpA is chronic inflammatory back pain. 
Ankylosing  spondylitis  (AS)  is  the  prototype  of  axial  SpA.  The  estimated  prevalence  of  AS  in  the 
Caucasian  population  is  0.5%.  AS  is  more  common  in  males  (male  to  female  ratio  2-3:1).  Clinical 
manifestations of AS usually begin in late adolescence or early childhood, rarely after the age of 45 years. 
Classical symptoms of AS include lower back or gluteal pain and stiffness which are worse in the morning 
or after long period of inactivity. The symptoms are eased by exercise. Functional limitations in the early

phase of the AS are mostly related to inflammation, but may be also related to structural changes in bone 
during  the  later  course  of  the  disease.  The  most  widely  used  diagnosis  criteria  for  AS  are  the  modified 
New  York  Classification  criteria  which  have  also  been  used  in  most  of  the  registration  studies  for 
medicinal product indicated for AS. According to these criteria, the definite AS is diagnosed if in addition 
to the radiologic criteria (bilateral sacroilitis grade > II or unilateral sacroilitis grade III to IV) at least two 
of  the  three  clinical  criteria  (low  back  pain  and  stiffness  of  at  least  3  months  duration  improved  by 
exercise and not relieved by rest; limitation of motion of lumbar spine in both the sagittal and the frontal 
planes; limitation of chest expansion relative to value normal for age and sex) are present. 
As  suggested  by  Assessment  of  SpondyloArthritis  International  Society  (ASAS)  in  2009,  the  term  axial 
SpA includes the patients with at least 3 months of back pain (onset > 45 years) and either 1) sacroilitis 
on imaging (radiographs or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and at least one clinical feature of SpA or 
2) the presence of HLA-B27-antigen and at least two clinical features of AS (“non-radiological axial SpA”). 
These  ASAS  classification  criteria  presenting  expanding  the  criteria  for  axial  SpA  have  also  changed  the 
regulatory situation of the medicinal products intended for axial SpA.  
According to the clinical guidelines, physical therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) 
(intermittent or continuous use) comprise the first-line treatment in AS. In contrast, clinical guidelines do 
not support the use of traditional non-biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug in the treatment of 
AS,  with  the  exception  of  consideration  of  sulphasalazine  in  AS  with  peripheral  arthritis.  The  treatment 
with  tumour  necrosis  factor  alpha  inhibitors  (TNFαi)  is  recommended  for  the  patients  with  persistently 
high  disease  activity  despite  conventional  treatment  with  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drug  (NSAID) 
and physiotherapy. 
To  date,  there  are  five  TNFαis  which  have  been  approved  for  treatment  of  AS  in  Europe.  Two  of  these 
(infliximab  and  golimumab)  are  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  severe  active  ankylosing  spondylitis  in 
adults  who  have  responded  inadequately  to  conventional  therapy.  In  contrast,  etanercept,  adalimumab, 
and certolizumab-pegol are indicated also for non-radiolographic axial SpA. 
Secukinumab is a first-in-class selective high-affinity human monoclonal anti-human interleukin-17A (IL-
17A) antibody of the IgG1/k isotype, designed to bind to and neutralize the activity of human IL-17A, a 
pro-inflammatory  cytokine,  leading  to  abrogation  of  IL-17A  pathway-related  inflammatory  cascade.  This 
cascade  promoted  by  the  IL-17A  result  in  the  activation  of  neutrophils  and  macrophages,  as  well  as 
epithelial  cells  and  fibroblasts,  and  is  believed  to  play  an  important  role  in  the  pathophysiology 
ofautoimmune  diseases,  including  psoriasis  and  AS.  Cosentyx  was  authorised  for  the  treatment  of 
moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis  in  adults  who  are  candidates  for  systemic  therapy  in  the  European 
Union  on  15  January  2015.  The  same  indication  has  also  to  date  been  approved  in  the  United  States, 
Chile,  Australia  and  in  Japan  (psoriasis  vulgaris).  This  medicinal  product  is  currently  approved  in  Japan 
also for treatment of psoriatic arthritis.  
The development of new products for treatment of AS is covered in the Guideline on clinical investigation 
of medicinal product for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (CPMP/EWP/4891/03). Recommendations 
of  this  guideline  were  taken  into  account  in  the  clinical  development  programme  (selection  of  patients, 
efficacy  endpoints).  A  paediatric  investigation  plan  (PIP)  in  the  treatment  of  chronic  idiopathic  arthritis 
has been accepted by the paediatric committee (PDCO, EMEA-000380-PIP01-09-M02). All measures have 
been  deferred  and  the  agreed  date  of  completion  of  the  PIP  is  by  December  2018,  i.e.,  after  the 
submission date.  
CHMP scientific advice or protocol assistance was not sought in the current indication.

2.1.  Non-clinical aspects 
Comparative pharmacokinetic analyses as well as comparative systemic exposure in cynomolgus 
monkeys and AS patients were provided in support of the use of secukinumab in ankylosing spondylitis. 
2.1.1.  Introduction 
Secukinumab  is  a  high-affinity  monoclonal  antibody  targeting  specifically  IL-17A  cytokine.  It  also  binds 
the  IL-17AF  heterodimer  and  to  a  lesser  extent  the  IL-17F  homodimer.  The  binding  data  showed  that 
secukinumab had high affinity to the intended target in the cynomolgus monkey. 
A  comprehensive  non-clinical  data  package  was  submitted  with  the  initial  marketing  authorisation 
application which adequately provides evidence on target specificity and mode of action i.e. neutralising 
the IL-17A related cellular events.  
Secukinumab  was  well  tolerated  in  a  full  set  of  toxicology  studies.  The  main  findings  from  the  toxicity 
studies  were  slight  decreases  in  lymphocyte  subsets  and  neutrophils  which  are  likely  related  to  the 
pharmacological activity of secukinumab. T cell dependent antibody response was slightly reduced which 
may  have  an  impact  on  the  vaccination.  Exposure  multiples  for  safety  in  humans  at  dose  levels  that 
produce maximal neutralising effect of IL-17A were significant; for the AUC 48-108 fold and for the Cmax 
53-100 fold. 
No  signs  of  teratogenicity,  embryo  toxicity,  or  effects  on  fertility  were  observed  in  the  reproductive 
toxicology studies. 
IL-17A neutralization may impair host resistance to certain infectious agents, and therefore, there may be 
an increased risk of infection to patients treated with secukinumab. 
Based  on  literature  evidence  IL-17A  has  both  pro-tumour  and  antitumor  activity  in  animal  models.  The 
available  data  do  not  give  a  clear  answer  on  the  effects  of  neutralizing  IL-17A  or  other  IL-17  family 
members on tumour growth in humans. Therefore, secukinumab may carry a potential risk for cancer. 
The risks of infection and tumour promotion for patients treated with secukinumab are addressed in the 
Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
2.1.2.  Pharmacology 
No new pharmacology data were included with this application. 
2.1.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A comparison of PK parameters in cynomolgus monkeys and humans after intravenous administration is 
presented in Table 1. The similar PK characteristics observed in the cynomolgus monkey and PsA and AS 
patients  are  in  line  with  the  comparable  binding  activities  of  secukinumab  to  cynomolgus  monkey  and 
human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn).

Human exposure multiples 
Using a population PK model based on pharmacokinetic data from several i.v. and s.c. studies in PsA and 
AS patients, mean concentration-time profiles resulting from the dose regimens in the phase III program 
were  simulated.  This  allowed  the  calculation  of  human  exposure  multiples  for  the  300  or  150  mg  s.c. 
dosing  regimens  in  PsA  patients  with  loading  doses  at  Weeks  0,  1,  2,  and  3,  followed  by  maintenance 
doses every four weeks (q4w) starting at Week 4 until week 48. 
For  the  calculation  of  human  exposure  multiples,  use  was  made  of  i)  the  experimental  maximum 
concentration  at  steady-state,  Cmax,ss,  (5455  μg/mL)  and  ii)  the  experimental  AUCtau  at  steady-state 
divided by the dosing interval tau to obtain the average steady-state concentration Cav,ss (4824 μg/mL) 
for  the  13  week  toxicology  study  in  cynomolgus  monkey  with  single  weekly  s.c.  administration  at  the 
NOAEL of 150 mg/kg. Exposure data and exposure multiples for the loading and maintenance phases are 
given in Table 2. 
The average serum concentrations at steady-state observed in monkeys after 13 weekly s.c. doses are 
192- and 96-fold higher than the predicted average serum concentrations expected in PsA patients 
treated with monthly maintenance s.c. doses of 150 mg and 300 mg respectively. At the end of the 
loading phase, human exposure is approximately 2-fold higher than during the maintenance phase. 
Therefore, exposure multiples are approximately half of those described above during the maintenance 
phase. In AS patients very similar mean Cav,ss, Cmax,ind and Cmax,ss values at the 150 mg dose level, 
25.8, 64.3, and 34.1 μg/mL, respectively were observed. Thus, for AS, human exposure multiples were 
very similar to the values calculated in PsA patients. 
For assessment of non-target related toxicity the species difference in binding affinity to the IL-17A 
receptor is not important, therefore human exposure multiple calculations on the basis of the exposure in 
man and animals were considered valid in this respect.

accordance  with  the  CHMP  guideline  on  the  environmental  risk  assessment  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) 
is exempted from testing because of its chemical structure. 
2.1.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Comparison  of  PK  characteristics  and  systemic  exposure  to  humans  demonstrated  significant  exposure 
margin  to  AS  patients  and  that  the  nonclinical  safety  data  generated  to  support  the  initial  marketing 
authorisation  of  secukinumab  treatment  in  patients  with  psoriasis  patients  were  adequate  and  sufficient 
to support the application in AS. 
2.1.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The data submitted in this application support the use of secukinumab in ankylosing spondylitis.

2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  MAH  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community  were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Secukinumab  (AIN457)  is  a  high-affinity,  fully  human  monoclonal  anti-human  IL-17  antibody  of  the 
immunoglobulin  G  (IgG1)/k  isotype.  It  displays  PK  properties  typical  of  a  human  IgG1-type 
immunoglobulin  interacting  with  a  soluble  target,  i.e.,  a  low  clearance  and  a  low  total  volume  of 
distribution.  
This  dossier  contained  one  phase  II  and  two  phase  III  clinical  studies,  which  included  pharmacokinetic 
(PK)  data  (Table  3).  The  administration  routes  in  the  clinical  studies  of  secukinumab  were  iv 
(CAIN457A2209) or sc (CAIN457F2305 & CAIN457F2310). An intravenous (iv) loading dose was used in 
one phase II (CAIN457A2209) and in one phase III (CAIN457F2305) study. In study CAIN457F2310 a sc 
loading dose was used.

CAIN457A2209, CAIN457F2305, CAIN457F2310. 
The  analytical  method  used  for  the  measurement  of  secukinumab  concentrations  was  an  enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  with  a  lower  limit  of  quantification  (LLOQ)  of  80  ng/ml  in  all  clinical 
studies.  The  descriptive  statistics  for  PK  parameters  included  mean,  standard  deviation  (SD)  and 
coefficient of variation (CV). When geometric mean was presented it was stated as such. 
Pharmacokinetic studies of secukinumab in ankylosing spondylitis 
Study CAIN457A2209 
The  study  was  a  randomised,  placebo  controlled  double  blind,  multi-centre,  phase  II,  proof-of-concept 
study. The secondary objective was to assess the pharmacokinetics of secukinumab. 
The study consisted of two parts. In part 1 of the study 30 patients were recruited and the patients were 
randomized to either secukinumab or placebo in ratio 4:1. The patients received two doses of either 10 
mg/kg of secukinumab or placebo (2 iv infusions 3  weeks apart). All subjects were analysed for PK and 
safety although for pharmacodynamics (PD) analysis one patient was excluded due to protocol violation. 
In  part  2  also  30  patients  were  recruited.  The  patients  were  randomized  to  receive  either  secukinumab 
0.1  mg/kg  or  1.0  mg/kg  or  10  mg/kg  of  secukinumab  as  iv  in  ratio  2:2:1.  Part  2  of  the  study  included 
two doses of secukinumab 3 weeks apart. All subjects were analysed for PK and safety. One patient was 
excluded from PD analysis due to non-availability of the PD measurements post baseline. 
Blood samples (2 ml) for determination of secukinumab concentrations in serum were taken pre-dose, 2, 
3, 4,  and 24 hours after initiation of the infusion (Days 1 and 22), Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 
and  end  of  the  study/Week  28.  PK  parameters  of  secukinumab  were  determined  using  non-

compartmental  methods  with  WinNonlin,  version  5.2.  The  calculated  parameters  were  AUCinf,  AUClast, 
T1/2,  λz,  Cmax,  Tmax,  CL  and  Vz.  Descriptive  statistics  of  plasma  concentrations  and  PK  parameters  were 
presented. 
Main findings related to the PK of secukinumab 
The pK parameters of secukinumab after two infusions of 10 mg/kg with a three-week dosing interval are 
shown in Table 4. Due to several discontinuations, the full set of pK parameters could not be obtained in 
all treated patients.

*Median (range) is given for Tmax 
The  pK  of  secukinumab  after  two  infusions  of  10  mg/kg,  two  infusions  of  1  mg/kg  and  two  infusions  of 
0.1 mg/ml with a three week dosing interval are summarized in Table 5. 
Table 5. Summary table of PK parameters of secukinumab from Part 1 and 2 combined 
With  secukinumab  10  mg/kg  infusions,  the  mean  clearance  (CL)  was  0.157  L/day.  The  mean  apparent 
distribution volume (Vz) was 6.06 L, which is close to the blood volume. The mean apparent elimination 
half-life was 28.1± 6.0 days. 
Mean arithmetic concentration-time profiles on a linear and semi-logarithmic concentration scale over the 
complete sampling time period are seen in Figure 1.

Study CAIN457F2305 
A  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel-group,  placebo-controlled,  multi-centre,  phase  III  study  of 
secukinumab was performed to demonstrate the efficacy of secukinumab at 16 weeks and to assess the 
long term safety, tolerability and efficacy up to 2 years in patients with active AS. One of the exploratory 
objectives was to explore the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pK/PD) relationship of secukinumab. 
A  screening  period  running  4  weeks  before  randomization  was  used  to  assess  eligibility,  followed  by  a 
treatment period of 2 years. 
•  At  baseline,  patients  whose  eligibility  was  confirmed  were  randomized  by  the  Interactive 
Response Technology to one of three treatment groups: 
•  Group  1  (iv-75  mg):  Secukinumab  10  mg/kg  iv  at  baseline,  Week  2  and  Week  4,  and  then 
secukinumab 75 mg sc starting at Week 8 and injected every 4 weeks (124 patients) 
•  Group  2  (iv-150  mg):  Secukinumab  10  mg/kg  iv  at  baseline,  Week  2  and  Week  4,  and  then 
secukinumab 150 mg sc starting at Week 8 and injected every 4 weeks (125 patients) 
•  Group  3  (Placebo):  Placebo  iv  at  baseline,  Week  2 and  Week  4,  and  then  placebo  sc  at  Week  8 
and Week 12 (122 patients) 
Patients were stratified according to being TNFαi inadequate responders (TNF-IR) or TNFαi naïve patients. 
At Week 16, the efficacy of secukinumab treatment was assessed based on ASAS 20 improvement criteria 
and all patients were classified as responders or non-responders. Patients initially randomized to placebo 
(Group 3) at baseline were re-randomized to receive double-blind treatment up to 2 years, as follows: 
• 
• 
Placebo  non-responders  were  re-randomized  to  receive  secukinumab  75  mg  or  150  mg  sc  (1:1) 
injected every 4 weeks. 
Placebo  responders  remained  on  placebo  sc  at  Weeks  16  and  20.  At  Week  24,  these  patients 
received  secukinumab  75  mg  sc  or  150  mg  sc  (1:1)  injected  every  4  weeks,  regardless  of 
responder status, as dictated by the re-randomization. 
Venous blood samples were collected pre-dose at baseline, Weeks 4, 16, 24, and 52 for p analyses.

Main findings related to the pK of secukinumab 
Serum  secukinumab  concentrations  were  in  the  expected  ranges  over  the  iv  and  sc  treatment  courses. 
Patients  initially  treated  with  placebo  and  then  re-randomized  to  sc  secukinumab  attained  a  similar 
steady-state mean concentration as patients who received secukinumab from the beginning of the study. 
There was evidence of dose-proportionality in exposure between the two dose levels during sc treatment. 
Secukinumab concentrations in Group 1 and 2 
At  Week  4,  mean  concentrations  were  similar  in  the  two  groups  (132  and  131  μg/mL,  respectively), 
reflecting  the  rise  in  concentrations  during  the  iv  dosing  phase  which  used  identical  doses  in  both 
treatment groups. At Weeks 16, 24, and 52, concentrations diverged and serially declined as steady state 
was  approached  during  every-4-week  administration  at  the  two  sc  dose  levels.  The  lower  mean 
concentrations at these visits compared with the values at Week 4 were due to the lower milligram doses 
and the less frequent administration during sc dosing. At Week 52, inter-subject variability was 44.6% in 
the  iv-75  mg  group  and  39.7%  in  the  iv-150  mg  group.  One  patient  in  both  groups  had  a  quantifiable 
secukinumab serum concentration before randomization. 
Secukinumab concentrations in placebo non-responders starting at week 16 
Two patients in the 150 mg group had quantifiable serum concentrations before randomization. The first 
s.c  dose  in  these  groups  was  at  Week  16.  Mean  concentrations  at  the  two  pharmacokinetic  visits  in 
Weeks 24 and 52 increased over time as exposure approached steady-state. By Week 52 after 9 months 
of  every-4-week  dosing,  the  mean  concentrations  were  11.4  μg/mL  (75  mg) and  17.2  μg/mL  (150  mg) 
yielding  a  150  mg  /  75  mg  concentration  ratio  of  1.51,  less  than  the  expected  ratio  of  2.0  for  dose-
proportionality, perhaps due to the small sample size of these treatment groups. At Week 52, the inter-
subject variability was 43.9% in the placebo non-responder 75 mg group and 38.6% in the placebo non-
responder  150  mg  group.  The  Week  52  mean  concentrations  in  the  placebo  non-responder  75  mg  and 
150  mg  groups  were  similar  to  those  in  the  iv-75  mg  and  iv-150  mg  groups  (10.9  and  20.0  μg/mL, 
respectively). 
Secukinumab concentrations in placebo-responders starting at week 16 
Before  re-randomization,  three  patients  had  quantifiable  secukinumab  concentrations  in  their  serum 
sample. The first sc dose in these groups was at Week 24. By Week 52 after 7 months of every-4-week 
dosing, the mean concentration was at steady-state with values of 11.7 μg/mL (75 mg) and 18.2 μg/mL 
(150 mg). The 150 mg / 75 mg concentration ratio was 1.56, less than the expected ratio of 2.0 for dose-
proportionality perhaps due to the small sample size. At Week 52, the inter-subject variability was 44.7% 
in the placebo responder 75 mg group and 34.1% in the placebo responder 150 mg group. 
These results are summarised in Table 6.

Study CAIN457F2310 
A  randomised,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  parallel-group,  placebo-controlled  phase  III  multicentre 
study  was  performed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  secukinumab  in  pre-filled  syringes  at  16  weeks  and  to 
evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety and tolerability up to 5 years in patients with AS. 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that the efficacy of secukinumab 75 mg sc or 150 
mg sc at Week 16 was superior to placebo in subjects with active AS based on the proportion of subjects 
achieving an ASAS 20 response. One of the exploratory objectives was assessment of pK/PD relationship 
of secukinumab. 
A screening period running 4-10 weeks before randomization was used to assess eligibility, followed by a 
treatment period of 52 weeks of blinded treatment. At BSL, patients whose eligibility was confirmed were 
randomized by the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) to one of three treatment groups: 
•  Group 1: secukinumab 75 mg plus placebo 150 mg sc once weekly at BSL, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4, 
followed by dosing every 4 weeks starting at Week 4 (n=73) 
•  Group 2: secukinumab 150 mg plus placebo 75 mg sc once weekly at BSL, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4, 
followed by dosing every 4 weeks starting at Week 4 (n=72) 
•  Group  3:  placebo  75  mg  and  placebo  150  mg  sc  once  weekly  at  BSL,  Weeks  1,  2,  3  and  4, 
followed by dosing every 4 weeks starting at Week 4 (n=74) 
Patients  were  stratified  according  to  being  TNFα  inhibitor  inadequate  responders  (TNF-IR)  or  TNFα 
inhibitor naïve patients. 
At Week 16, subjects who had been randomized to placebo at baseline were re-randomized by the IRT to 
receive secukinumab 75 mg plus placebo 150 mg sc or secukinumab 150 mg plus placebo 75 mg sc (1:1) 
every 4 weeks up to 256 weeks. The study is ongoing. 
Venous blood samples were collected pre-dose at baseline, Weeks 4, 16, 24, and 52 for PK analyses.  
Main findings related to the PK of secukinumab 
Secukinumab 75 mg and 150 mg groups 
In the 75 mg sc group (before randomisation) 2 patients had a quantifiable secukinumab concentration. 
As  these  concentrations  were  near  the  analytical  limit  of  quantification,  they  may  represent  analytical 
noise.    At  Week  4  near  the  end  of  the  weekly  dose  administration  phase,  the  mean  concentration  was 
Assessment report

approximately  2-fold  higher  in  the  150  sc  mg  arm  (52.9  μg/mL)  compared  to  the  75  mg  sc  arm  (25.4 
μg/mL) consistent with dose-proportionality. At Weeks 16 to 52, concentrations approached and attained 
steady-state  during  every-4-week  administration.  The  lower  mean  concentrations  at  these  visits 
compared with the values at Week 4 were due to the less frequent administration during the maintenance 
phase. 
Placebo group patients re-randomized to secukinumab starting at Week 16 
Three  patients  had  quantifiable  serum  concentrations  before  the  first  secukinumab  administration.  Two 
concentrations  may  have  been  analytical  noise  as  they  were  close  to  the  assay  quantification  limit  and 
one  concentration  may  have  been  from  a  blood  sample  taken  post-dose  although  not  documented  as 
such. 
The  first  dose  in  these  arms  was  at  Week  16  followed  by  every-4-week  dosing.  In  placebo  group  mean 
concentrations at Weeks 24 and 52 (that is, 8 and 36 weeks after starting treatment) increased as drug 
accumulated  to  steady-state.  At  the  Week  52  visit  when  exposure  was  at  steady  state,  mean 
concentrations  were  consistent  with  dose-proportionality.  These  concentrations  were  similar  to  those  in 
the respective 75 mg sc and 150 mg sc regimen arms at Week 52. 
The results from this study are summarised in Table 7.

Secukinumab population pK modelling report 
Population  pharmacokinetic  (PPK)  analysis  of  secukinumab  in  patients  with  AS  was  performed  using 
pooled  concentration  data  from  studies  CAIN457A2209,  CAIN457F2305  and  CAIN457F2310.  The  effects 
of  potentially  important  covariates  such  as  bodyweight,  gender,  race  (non-Asian  vs.  Asian  and  disease 
characteristics  assessed  by  the  BASDAI  score  and  CRP  level  at  baseline,  previous  use  of  biologics, 
response status to anti-TNFα therapy, concomitant use of methotrexate and time since first diagnosis of 
ankylosing spondylitis were estimated. The studies covered a mix of dosing regimens with either iv (2 x 
0.1  mg/kg  to  2  x  10  mg/kg  iv)  or  sc  (75  mg  to  150  mg  sc)  administration.  The  population  model  was 
built based on 2138 secukinumab concentrations from 484 patients. 
A  linear  two-compartmental  distribution  model  with  first-order  absorption  (for  sc)  administration  and 
first-order elimination was used as basis. The disposition kinetics were modeled using a parameterization 
involving  clearance  (CL),  central  volume  (Vc),  inter-compartmental  clearance  (Q1),  and  peripheral 
volume  (Vp1).  A  first-order  absorption  rate  constant  (ka)  and  bioavailability  term  (Fabs1)  were  used  to 
characterize the rate and extent of the absorption process of the sc administration. 
Covariates included in the PK analysis are summarised in Tables 8 and 9.

There  were  no  relevant  correlations  between  bodyweight,  age,  or  BASDAI  at  baseline,  but  there  was  a 
correlation  between  AGE  at  baseline  and  TDIAG  (time  since  first  diagnosis  of  AS).  Female  and  Asian 
patients  had  lower  bodyweight.  Asian  patient  subpopulation  was  slightly  younger  than  non-Asian,  and 
females were slightly older than males. 
The effect of different covariates on clearance (CL) was estimated (Table 10). Changes to typical subject 
parameter of more than 20 % are considered potentially of clinical relevance. Therefore only body weight 
was retained in the PPK model as potentially relevant covariate and it was included in the PPK.

Absorption 
Pharmacokinetics  of  secukinumab  was  described  by  first  order  absorption  and  linear  pharmacokinetics. 
Based  on  two  compartment  PK  model  of  secukinumab  in  AS  patients  using  data  from  studies 
CAIN457A2209,  CAIN457F2305  and  CAIN457F2310  minimum  concentration  of  secukinumab  at  steady-
state (Cmin,ss) was estimated to be 20.8 µg/mL after s.c loading and s.c maintenance dose of 150 mg of 
secukinumab. The average concentration at steady state (Cav,ss) was estimated to be 25.8 µg/mL and the 
mean  peak  concentration  at  steady  state  (Cmax)  to  be  34.1  µg/mL  and  to  occur  approximately  6  days 
after dosing. Cmax after the first dose was estimated to be 16.1 µg/mL, which is about a half of the Cmax 
at steady-state. 
Based on the PPK modeling report bioavailability secukinumab was estimated to be 79 % in patients with 
AS which is similar to the absolute availability in plaque psoriasis patients. 
Distribution 
Based  on  PPK  analysis  the  volume  of  distribution  was  low  being  3.09  L  (CV%  30.7)  for  central 
compartment  volume  and  2.38  L  (CV%  30.7)  for  peripheral  compartment  volume  in  typical  AS  patient 
weighting  77  kg.  The  estimated  values  for  volume  of  distribution  are  low  and  similar  to  the  value  in 
patients with plaque psoriasis patients. 
Metabolism 
The  majority  of  IgG  elimination  occurs  via  intracellular  catabolism,  following  fluid-phase  or  receptor 
mediated endocytosis. 
Elimination 
Based  on  PPK  analysis  terminal  half-life  (t 1/2)  of  secukinumab  is  estimated  to  be  25.7  days  in  patients 
with AS with inter-patient variability 27 %. Serum CL is estimated to be low (CL=0.16 L/day with 32.8 % 
CV  inter-patient  variability  in  an  allometric  relationship).  For  CL  and  central  volume  of  distribution  (Vc) 
the  allometric  exponents  were  estimated  to  be  0.83  and  1.24,  respectively.  CRP  at  baseline  and  anti-
TNFα  response  status  did  not  have  a  clinically  relevant  influence  on  clearance  (after  adjusting  for 
bodyweight). 
Excretion 
Since  secukinumab  is  a  human  IgG1  immunoglobulin  with  large  molecular  size  (about  150  kDa)  little 
intact  immunoglobulin  can  be  filtered  by  the  kidneys.  Secukinumab  is  not  expected  to  be  excreted  in 
urine or secreted into the bile. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Approximately 2-fold higher secukinumab concentrations were observed with the 150 mg dosing regimen 
compared to values with the 75 mg sc dosing regimen (Study CAIN457F2310). PPK analysis revealed no 
time-dependent or dose-dependence change in CL indicating that the PK of secukinumab is linear. 
The  exploratory  E-R  evaluation  suggested  a  significant  association  between  secukinumab  exposure  and 
clinical  end-points.  While  the  median  patient  treated  with  the  proposed  150  mg  dose  (including  loading 
regimen)  appeared  to  have  an  adequate  Cmin  to  attain  Emax,  patients  with  an  increased  body  weight 
might  have  a  significantly  lower  exposure.  Therefore  the  CHMP  requested  the  MAH  to  discuss  the 
potential  clinical  benefit  of  a  weight  based  dosing  of  secukinumab.  From  the  simulation  of  expected 
efficacy  outcomes  based  on  study  [CAIN457F2310]  and  the  observed  clinical  data  from  the  pivotal  trial 
[CAIN457F2305]  with  higher  initial  (weight-adjusted)  exposures  due  to  intravenous  loading  there  is 
insufficient evidence to recommend a weight-based posology for secukinumab in patients with AS. A dose

of 300 mg for heavier patients is unlikely to result in consistent clinically meaningful advantage over the 
150 mg dose. 
Special populations 
No paediatric studies were conducted. 
No formal PK studies have been performed in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function. As majority 
of  IgG  elimination  occurs  via  intracellular  catabolism  following  fluid-phase  or  receptor-mediated 
endocytosis,  impaired  renal  or  hepatic  function  is  not  expected  to  influence  neither  metabolism  nor 
excretion of secukinumab. 
Based on PPK analysis gender or race has no effect on clearance of secukinumab in patients with AS.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Drug-drug  interactions  between  monoclonal  antibodies  and  low  molecular  weight  drugs  were  not 
investigated  in  vitro  or  in  formal  interaction  clinical  studies.  The  CHMP  noted  that  methotrexate  and 
corticosteroids were used as categorical covariates in the PPK analysis. However, data and conclusions of 
the  concomitant  use  of  methotrexate  and  corticosteroids  with  secukinumab  were  lacking  from  the  PPK 
report.  The  MAH  was  therefore  requested  to  perform  additional  analyses  to  that  effect.  These  analyses 
showed  that  secukinumab  concentration  profiles  in  two  Phase  III  studies  [studies  CAIN457F2305  and 
CAIN457F2310] in patients with and without concomitant methotrexate were similar at weeks 16 and 52. 
There  were  also  no  systematic  trends  either  downward  or  upward  in  secukinumab  concentrations  from 
patients using concomitant glucocorticoids compared to those who did no at weeks 16 and 52.  
2.2.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The pharmacodynamic effect of secukinumab in binding to IL-17A, and therefore inhibiting IL-17A 
signalling, is in the reduction of the inflammatory processes of AS. Based on the data provided within the 
initial marketing authorisation application, the engagement of IL-17A was seen as an increase in serum 
total IL-17A levels after secukinumab treatment, followed by a slow release of the IL-17A-secukinumab 
complex. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
A meta-analysis entitled Total Interleukin 17A analysis report (report date: 06-Feb-2015) was provided. 
The scope of the report was to assess the total IL-17A levels from eight phase I, IIb and phase III clinical 
trials which were either not part of the clinical study reports or only partly summarized in the clinical 
study reports (CSR, Studies A1101, A2206, A2209, A2212, A2220, A2309, F2201 and F2208). 
Blood samples for quantification of total IL-17A (i.e., the sum of free and secukinumab bound IL-17 in 
serum) were taken at the same time points as for pharmacokinetic. The Meso Scale Discovery 
electrochemoluminescence assay was used. 
The median total IL-17A concentration-time profiles after doses of 0.1 mg/kg iv and 10 mg/kg iv on Days 
0 and 22 from Study A2209, is shown in Figure 3. The highest median concentrations were observed a 
week after the second dose, followed by slowly declining concentrations. 
Figure 3. Median total IL-17A concentration – time profiles in AS patients (Study A2209) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/665405/2015 
Page 21/109 
 
  
  
 
 
Based on the meta-analysis, the increase in total IL-17A concentrations at post dose time points was due 
to binding to secukinumab to form an IL-17A-secukinumab complex which has slower clearance than that 
of unbound IL-17A. The decrease after treatment reflects the decrease in secukinumab concentrations.  
The following observations were made: 
During  a  time  span  of  one  to  two  weeks  after  the  first  dose  of  secukinumab,  total  IL-17A  levels  raised 
until  a  plateau  was  reached  in  both  healthy  subjects  and  patient  populations,  indicating  fast  target 
engagement (IL-17A) of secukinumab in all studies analysed. 
Plateau levels of median total IL-17A were approximately 100 pg/mL with a high inter-subject variability. 
This  was  confirmed  in  the  phase  III  regimen  in  Pso  in  which  after  the  initial  4  once-weekly  injections, 
median concentrations at Week 4 were about 130 pg/mL in both secukinumab groups. 
Median  Cmax  levels  of  total  IL-17A  were  higher  with  secukinumab  doses  of  3  x  10  mg/kg iv  in  psoriasis 
patients and single 10 mg/kg iv in Japanese healthy subjects, compared to single 3 mg/kg iv in psoriasis, 
2 x 10 mg/kg iv in psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis patients and single 150 mg sc in Japanese 
healthy subjects. 
With increasing doses of secukinumab or multiple doses, total IL-17A concentrations were sustained for a 
longer duration. 
In the elimination phase, the total IL-17A concentration-time profiles showed similarity to the elimination 
behaviour  of  secukinumab  itself  (similar  half-lives  for  bound  IL-17A  and  secukinumab).  This  indicated  a 
joint clearance of secukinumab with (bound) IL-17A. 
In  summary,  total  IL-17A  profiles  across  studies  in  both  healthy  subjects  and  patient  populations 
(psoriasis,  psoriatic  arthritis,  ankylosing  spondylitis,  rheumatoid  arthritis)  showed  concentration-time 
patterns that were consistent with target engagement of secukinumab. 
2.2.1.  PK/PD modeling 
A  graphical  exploratory  analysis  of  secukinumab  exposure-response  (E-R)  relationships  for  efficacy  and 
adverse events in study CAIN457F2310 was performed. The focus was on describing E-R trend at a fixed 
time point, rather than through longitudinal PKPD modeling. 
The  following  efficacy  endpoints,  evaluated  at  Week  16,  were  considered:  ASAS  (20/40/5-6)  response, 
BASDAI,  and  SF36-PCS.  Full  analysis  sets  were  used.  Crude  incidence  rates  for  the  following  treatment 
emergent  adverse  events  (up  to  Week  16)  were  considered:  “Any  adverse  event”  (AE),  “Any  serious 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/665405/2015 
Page 22/109 
 
  
  
 
 
 
adverse event” (SAE), “Any infections and infestations” (primary system organ class), “Upper respiratory 
tract infections” (preferred term), “Nasopharyngitis” (preferred term) and “Oral Herpes” (preferred term). 
The secukinumab exposure metric was trough concentration (Cmin) at Week 16. Concentrations were set 
to zero for all patients randomised to the placebo group. All concentrations reported in the database were 
used  in  the  analysis,  including  those  flagged  for  being  out  of  sampling  window.  A  total  of  216  patients 
contributed to the exposure-response analyses. 
ASAS20 response rate 
Figure  4  illustrates  the  E-R  relationship  for  ASAS20  response  rates  at  Week  16.  The  E-R  correlation 
appeared similar across ASAS response. The black line and the blue shaded area represent the mean and 
95  %  (pointwise)  confidence  limits  from  the  logistic  regression  model.  The  black  diamonds  and  the 
whiskers  represent  the  mean  and  95%  confidence  interval  of  the  observed  response  rates  for  the 
exposure  subgroups.  The  model  fit  showed  a  trend  for  an  increased  probability  of  achieving  ASAS 
response  with  higher  Cmin  levels.  The  exposure  response  curve  flattens  at  Cmin  levels  that  are  higher 
than  ca.  25  mcg/mL.  This  approximately  corresponds  to  the  mean  concentration  achieved  with  the  150 
mg dosing regimen tested in the study, as illustrated by the boxplots of observed Cmin concentrations at 
Week 16 in the different arms. 
Figure 4. ASAS20 response rate versus Cmin at week 16. 
Similar conclusions were reached for BASDAI and SF36-PCS. 
An  increasing  trend  with  exposure  was  seen  for  infections  and  infestations,  nasopharyngitis  and  oral 
herpes. 
The  results  of  this  exploratory  analysis  are  limited  to  the  subcutaneous  loading  regimen  tested  in  study 
CAIN457F2310 (loading dose on weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, followed by Q4W dosing). It was not possible to infer 
from this analysis the exposure-response relationship following a subcutaneous no-load regiment or other 
loading  regimen  (such  as  iv  loading).  In  consequence,  results  presented  here  are  only  indicative  of 
potential trends in the data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/665405/2015 
Page 23/109 
 
  
  
 
 
Exposure-response  relationships  were  observed  in  all  efficacy  parameters  (ASAS,  BASDAI,  and  SF36-
PCS),  with  a  trend  for  increased  response  with  higher  Cmin  concentrations.  The  exposure-response 
appeared  to  flattenen  at  Cmin  levels  higher  than  ca.  25  mcg/mL.  This  was  approximately  the  mean 
concentration  of  the  studied  regimen  of  150  mg,  suggesting  a  small  benefit  from  further  increasing  the 
dose.  However,  in  some of  the  patients  receiving  a 150  mg  dose,  Cmin  will be  below  25  mcg/mL.  These 
patients, with lower exposure, may experience a decreased clinical response. 
It  can  be  noted  that  the  value  of  25  mcg/mL  is  slightly  higher  than  the  value  referenced  in  the 
corresponding analyses in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients, i.e. 20 mcg/mL; this is because the effect of 
loading  is  more  prominent  at  Week  16,  resulting  in  higher  trough  concentrations  than  at  Week  24 
(reference visit in PsA). 
No evidence of an effect of Cmin was observed on AE rates for the following categories: any AE, any SAE, 
and  upper  respiratory  tract  infections.  A  trend  for  increased  rates  of  for  infections  and  infestations, 
nasopharyngitis  and  oral  herpes  with  higher  Cmin  was  observed.  However,  uncertainty  around  the 
predicted curves is considerably greater as Cmin increases. These results could be suggestive of possible 
signals  and  infections  are  included  in  the  RMP  as  an  important  identified  risk  which  will  be  closely 
monitored in PSURs. 
2.2.1.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Secukinumab PK in AS patients after sc administration was studied in three clinical studies in patients. In 
addition,  simulated  PK  data  from  the  PPK  model  and  a  graphical  exploratory  analysis  of  exposure-
response of efficacy, AEs and radiographic assessments were presented.  
In  clinical  study  A2209,  the  studied  secukinumab  dose  in  Part  1  was  10  mg/kg  as  an  iv  infusion 
administered  twice  by  3  weeks  interval  (also  placebo  group).  In  Part  2  two  doses  of  0.1  mg/kg,  1.0 
mg/kg  and  10  mg/kg  or  placebo  3  weeks  apart  were  administered.  The  reported  PK  parameters  for 
secukinumab  were  quite  similar  as  earlier  seen  in  the  study  with  similar  dosing  regimen  and  route  with 
psoriasis patients. The low CL and Vz and quite long t1/2 are typical for secukinumab. 
In study CAIN457F2305, the studied loading dose of secukinumab was 10 mg/kg iv at baseline, at weeks 
2 and 4 and thereafter the studied secukinumab doses were 75 mg and 150 mg sc monthly (starting at 
week 8). At week 16, mean concentrations declined due to the less-frequent sc dosing as the iv dosing. 
The  mean  secukinumab  concentrations  declined  still  at  weeks  24  and  52.  The  mean  secukinumab 
concentrations with 75 mg sc dose were 17.2 µg/ml and 10.9 µg/ml at weeks 24 and 52 and with 150 mg 
sc  dose  25.5  µg/ml  and  20.0  µg/ml,  respectively.  In  this  study,  there  were  also  patients  who  received 
placebo  as  the  loading  dose  and  at  week  16  were  classified  as  responder  or  non-responders.  The  non-
responders received secukinumab 75 mg or 150 mg sc monthly and the responders remained on placebo 
until week 24 and thereafter received either secukinumab 75 mg or 150 mg sc. Patients initially treated 
with placebo and re-randomized to sc secukinumab attained similar steady state concentrations at week 
52 as patients who received secukinumab from the beginning of the study. 
In clinical study CAIN457F2310 the studied secukinumab doses were 75 mg or 150 mg sc weekly up to 4 
week and thereafter monthly starting at week 4. In this study, there were also patients receiving placebo 
in  the  same  study  design  as  in  the  study  F2305.  The  dose-proportionality  in  the  secukinumab 
concentrations  was  found  at  week  4  and  also  at  steady-state  (weeks  16  and  24  and  52).  The  mean 
secukinumab concentrations were in the expected range. 
Based on PPK analysis, gender, age, race, concomitant use of methotrexate, baseline BASDAI score and 
time  since  first  diagnosis  of  AS  were  not  identified  as  covariates  with  a  nominal  p-value  of  <0.05.  An 
allometric relationship between bodyweight and clearance and volume has been observed in the PPK. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/665405/2015 
Page 24/109 
 
  
  
 
On  the  basis  of  the  PPK  model,  the  PK  of  secukinumab  is  linear  with  no  evidence  of  a  time  dependent 
change in the CL or dose-dependence of CL, and the bioavailability after sc administration was 79% in AS 
patients being slightly higher than in psoriasis patients (66-77%). 
On the basis of the PPK model and graphical analysis increased body weight correlated with lower Cmin 
concentrations.  There  was  also  a  trend  that  the  higher  Cmin  concentrations,  the  better  response  in 
efficacy.  Nevertheless, the available data suggest that the 150 mg dose appears to be effective even in 
patients  with  an  increased  body  weight.  The  Cmin,ss  of  secukinumab  needed  for  the  therapeutic  effect 
was estimated to be about 20 µg/ml. This steady-state concentration is achieved for most patients with 
the  proposed  dosing  regimen  with  150  mg  sc.  The  75  mg  sc  was  demonstrated  to  be  not  sufficiently 
effective. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  PPK  model  was  able  to  predict  the  observed  data  sufficiently.  The 
estimated  PK  parameters  (e.g.,  Cmin,ss,  AUCss,  Cmax,ss,  tmax  and  t1/2)  for  secukinumab  150  mg 
obtained  with  the  PPK  model  were  in  line  with  the  PK  parameters  obtained  in  the  clinical  studies  with 
secukinumab. 
In  all  clinical  studies  with  AS  patients,  there  were  pre-dose  samples  with  quantifiable  concentrations  of 
secukinumab.  The  number  of  these  samples  however,  was  relatively  small  and  did  not  impact  on 
interpretation of PK results. 
In  conclusion,  the  PK  data  of  secukinumab  in  AS  patients  was  very  similar  to  the  PK  data  obtained  in 
psoriasis  patients.  This  was  reflected  in  Section  5.2  of  the  SmPC,  which  also  contains  a  statement  that 
secukinumab clearance and volume of distribution increase as body weight increases.  
2.2.2.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The results indicate that the PK of secukinumab in AS patients is similar to other indications both after iv 
and after sc administration and blood serum concentrations increased dose-proportionally between doses 
of 75 mg to 150 mg sc in patients with AS. 
2.3.  Clinical efficacy 
2.3.1.  Dose response studies 
Study A2209 
This was a randomized, placebo controlled double blind, multi-centre phase II proof-of-concept study to 
assess the efficacy of AIN457 in patients with moderate to severe ankylosing spondylitis (Report date 28 
February  2012).  Secukinumab  was  administered  iv  from  50  mg/ml  LYO  formulation.  A  total  of  60 
participants were randomized. 
The  primary  objective  of  the  first  part  of  the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  secukinumab  at  6 
weeks based on the proportion of patients achieving ASAS20 response. The subjects were randomized to 
either secukinumab 10 mg/kg iv or placebo in a ratio of 4:1. Each patient received the study drug dose 
on Day 1 and Day 22. 
Conversely,  the  primary  objective  of  second  part  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  three  different  doses  of 
secukinumab  at  6  weeks  based  on  the  change  in  Bath  Ankylosing  spondylitis  disease  activity  index 
(BASDAI)  score.  The  subjects  were  randomized  to  either  secukinumab  0.1  mg/kg  iv,  secukinumab  1 
mg/kg iv or secukinumab 10 mg/kg iv in a ratio of 2:2:1. Each patient received the study drug dose on 
Day 1 and Day 22. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/665405/2015 
Page 25/109 
 
  
  
 
In  the  first  part  of  the  Study,  the  proportion  of  ASAS20  responders  at  week  6  was  59.2%  in  the 
secukinumab  group  versus  24.5%  of  the  placebo  group  (95%  CI  for  the  difference  11.5%  to  56.4%). 
There  were  no  significant  differences  in  ASAS20  response  between  the  randomized  groups  in  patients 
with previous TNFαi use.  
In  the  second  part  of  the  Study,  the  differences  in  change  of  BASDAI  score  at  week  6  from  baseline 
between  the  secukinumab  groups  were  not  statistically  significant.  The  numerical  reductions  in  BASDAI 
score were of equal magnitude in the secukinumab 1.0 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg groups: -2.02 versus -1.87, 
respectively (95% CI: -1.85, 1.56; p=0.57). The reductions in BASDAI score in the 0.1 mg/Kg group was 
-1.20 versus -1.87 of the 10 mg/kg group (95% CI: -1.09, 2.43; p=0.22).  
Study A2209E1 
This was an open label non-randomized extension study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AIN457 
(secukinumab)  in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  ankylosing  spondylitis  (Report  date  2  July  2013). 
From  the  core  study  A2209,  39  patients  were  recruited  to  the  extension  study.  Secukinumab  LYO 
formulation 3 mg/kg iv was administered to all participants every 4 weeks up to 6 months (7 doses, part 
I of the study) with a possible extension of further 7 doses, one very 4 weeks up to 6 months (part II of 
the  study).  The  first  dose of  the  study  drug  was  given  within  3  weeks  after  completion  visit  of the  core 
study A2209 (Visit 17 at Week 28).  
ASAS20  response  had  been  maintained  by  23%  of  the  participants  of  the  core  study  A2209  at  the 
screening visit of this extension study. The proportion of patients with the ASAS20 response increased to 
50-59%  during  the  whole  56-week  period  of  study  drug  administration.  This  increased  response  was 
achieved already from Week 4 onwards. Similar improvements were also detected in terms of responses 
for ASAS40 (26-49%) and ASAS 5/6 (28-50%). The mean BASDAI decreased from 6.1 to 3.9 during the 
whole treatment period. Conversely, the median CRP levels decreased from 8.0 mg/l to around 3.0 mg/l 
during the follow-up indicating the effect of treatment on chronic inflammation. These positive effects of 
on efficacy outcomes were reversed at post-treatment study visits. 
Study F2201 
This  was  a  16-week  multicentre,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel  group,  dose-
finding  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy,  safety  and  tolerability  of  subcutaneous  secukinumab  (AIN457) 
followed  by  an  extension  phase  up  to  a  total  of  60  weeks  in  patients  with  active  rheumatoid  arthritis 
despite stable treatment with methotrexate (Report date 23 May 2012). 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of various doses of secukinumab 
compared to placebo as add-on therapy at Week 16. 237 patients were randomized with 1:1:1:1:1 ratio 
to  1  of  5  treatment  groups:  secukinumab  300  mg  sc  q4wk,  150mg  sc  q4wk,  75  mg  sc  q4wk,  25mg  sc 
q4wk, or placebo sc q4wk for 48 weeks. At Week 20, patients who were randomized to placebo at Week 0 
or to secukinumab but did not achieve an ACR20 response at Week 16 were re-assigned by the IVRS to 
receive  double-blind  treatment  (150  mg  or  300  mg  sc  q4w)  up  to  Week  48.  American  college  for 
rheumatology (ACR)20/50/70 score and disease activity score (DAS)28 response/remission were used as 
efficacy criteria. 
Higher proportions of patients treated with 75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg sc q4wk achieved ACR20, ACR50 or 
ACR70  response  compared  with  patients  treated  with  placebo  sc  q4wk,  as  early  as  Week  2  and  up  to 
Week 16. However, the placebo group had an unexplained increase in the proportion of patients with an 
ACR20  response  from  24%  at  Week  12  to  36%  at  Week  16.  Consequently,  none  of  the  differences 
reached statistical significance and therefore the primary efficacy endpoint was not achieved (see Table 
12 and Figure 5). Nonetheless, the 75-300 mg dose groups showed consistently greater improvements

in secondary efficacy variables including ACR50 response, ACR70 response, DAS28 scores and individual 
ACR  components  over  the  16  weeks.  In  contrast,  the  25  mg  dose  provided  a  non-effective  or  minimal 
therapeutic  benefit  over  placebo.  Efficacy  responses  from  Week  20  reaffirmed  the  efficacy  observed  for 
secukinumab 75-300 mg.

Treatment 
The study design is presented in Figure 6. 
A  4-week  screening  period  before  randomization  was  followed  by  a  treatment  period  of  two  years.  At 
baseline, patients were randomized (1:1:1) to one of the three treatment groups: 
•  Group  1:  Secukinumab  iv  (10  mg/kg)  at  baseline,  Weeks  2  and  4,  then  secukinumab  75  mg  sc 
starting at Week 8 and injected every 4 weeks 
•  Group 2: Secukinumab iv (10 mg/kg) at baseline, Weeks 2 and 4, then secukinumab 150 mg sc 
starting at Week 8 and injected every 4 weeks 
•  Group 3: Placebo iv at baseline, Weeks 2 and 4, then placebo sc at Week 8 and Week 12. 
•  At Week 16 (Visit 8), all patients were classified as ASAS20 responders (>20% improvement from 
baseline in main ASAS response measures) or non-responders. Placebo non-responders were re-
randomized to receive secukinumab 75 mg sc or 150 mg sc. The placebo responders remained at 
placebo until Week 24, when also these patients were randomized to either of the sc-doses. 
•  Rescue treatment was not allowed until Week 16. Patients who completed the 2 year study might 
be eligible to enter a planned extension trial.

Objectives 
The primary objective was to demonstrate the efficacy of at least one dose of secukinumab (IV-75 mg or 
IV-150  mg)  at  Week  16  was  superior  compared  to  placebo  in  patients  with  active  AS  based  on  the 
proportion of patients achieving an ASAS 20 response. 
The secondary objectives were:

patients achieving an ASAS 40 response. 
•  To  demonstrate  that  the  efficacy  of  at  least  one  dose  of  secukinumab  (IV-75  mg  or  IV-150 
mg) at Week 16 was superior to placebo in patients with active AS based on the change from 
baseline of hsCRP. 
•  To  demonstrate  that  the  efficacy  of  at  least  one  dose  of  secukinumab  (IV-75  mg  or  IV-150

monitoring 
The exploratory objectives of the study were to evaluate the above-mentioned outcomes of treatment in 
other  time  points  than  Week  16.  In  addition,  the  efficacy  was  evaluated  by  assessing  the  change  from 
baseline in other outcomes than mentioned above, e.g., different ASAS components, BASFI, BASMI, bone 
oedema measured by MRI in patients with active AS.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  ASAS  20  at  week  16,  defined  as  an  improvement  of  ≥20%  and  ≥1 
unit on a scale of 0-10 in at least three of the four main domains and no worsening of ≥20% and ≥1 unit 
on  a  scale  of  10  in  the  remaining  domain.  The  ASAS  (Assessment  of  SpondyloArthritis  International 
Society Criteria) response measures consist of the following core assessment domains: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Patient’s global assessment of disease activity measured on a VAS scale (0-100 mm) 
Patient’s assessment of spinal pain, represented by either total or nocturnal back pain scores, 
both measured on a VAS scale (0-100 mm) 
Function represented by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), the average of 
10 questions regarding ability to perform specific tasks as measured by VAS scale (0-10 cm) 
Inflammation represented by mean duration and severity of morning stiffness, represented by the 
average of the last 2 questions on the 6-question BASDAI as measured by VAS scale (0-10 cm) 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included ASAS40 (defined as an improvement of ≥40% and ≥2 units on a 
scale of 10 in at least three of the four main domains and no worsening at all in the remaining domain), 
ASAS 5/6 (improvement of ≥ 20% in at least five domains), ASAS partial remission (defined as a value 
of ≤ 2 units in each of the 4 core domains on a scale of 10), BASDAI (0 through 10 scale pertaining to 
the  5  major  symptoms  of  AS:  Fatigue,  Spinal  pain,  Joint  pain/  swelling,  enthesitis,  Morning  stiffness 
duration  and  severity),  hsCRP  (change  from  baseline  in  high-sensitivity  C-reactive  protein),  ASQoL 
(change  from  baseline  in  Ankylosing  Spondylitis  Quality  of  Life)  and  SF-36  version  2  (Medical  Outcome 
Short  Form  Health  Survey:  Physical  Functioning,  Role-Physical,  Bodily  Pain,  General  Health,  Vitality, 
Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and Mental Health). The exploratory endpoints included BASFI (Bath 
Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index), BASMI (spinal mobility evaluation), 44-tender and swollen joint 
count  assessment,  ESR  (Erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate),  MASES  (Maastricht  Ankylosing  Spondylitis 
Enthesitis Score), X-Ray of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine assessed by modified Stoke Ankylosing 
Spondylitis Spinal Score (mSASSS) at 2 years, MRI of spine and sacroiliac joints in a subgroup of TNF-αi 
naïve  patients  at  selected  clinical  sites  only  (Berlin  total  sacroiliac  joint  oedema  score,  total  Ankylosing 
Spondylitis  spinal  MRI-active  score,  and  Berlin  spine  score),  DXA  of  the  lumbar  spine,  total  hip  and 
femoral  neck,  FACIT-Fatigue,  EuroQol  5D  (EQ-5D)  and  Work  Productivity  and  Activity  Impairment  - 
General Health (WPAI-GH).

Sample size 
An overall type I error (2-sided) 5% was used to control type I error. Since two secukinumab doses were 
tested versus placebo with respect to the primary endpoint (ASAS 20 response at Week 16), the type-I-
error was split to 2.5% two-sided for each comparison. For 90% power and assuming a response rate of 
20%  in  the  placebo  group,  at  least  39  patients  per  group  would  be  needed  to  show  a  response  rate  of 
60%  in  the  secukinumab  groups  based  on  Fisher’s  exact  test.  In  this  study  population,  a  placebo 
response rate of about 20% after 14 weeks has been reported. 
In  order  to  collect  additional  safety  information  on  the  use  of  secukinumab  in  this  population,  348 
patients  were  planned  to  be  equally  allocated  to  3  treatment  groups  (116  patients  in  each  treatment 
group),  stratifying  for  prior  treatment  or  not  with  TNF-αi.  The  study  was  planned  to  have  at  least  70% 
TNF-αi naïve patients.  
Randomisation 
At baseline (Visit 2), all eligible patients were randomized to one of the treatment arms (ratio 1:1:1). The 
patients  were  stratified  according  to  being  either  TNF-IR  or  TNF-αi  naïve  status.  Approximately  30%  of 
the patients had to be TNF-IR to ensure a representative patient population for the assessment of efficacy 
and safety.  
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. 
Statistical methods 
The  analysis  of  the  primary  variable  was  based  on  the  “full  analysis  set”  (FAS).  The  statistical  null 
hypotheses  for  ASAS  20  (primary  endpoint)  being  tested  was  that  there  was  no  difference  in  the 
proportion  of  patients  fulfilling  the  ASAS  20  criteria  at  Week  16  in  any  of  the  secukinumab  regimens 
versus placebo regimen. 
The primary analysis was conducted via logistic regression with treatment and TNFαi status as factors and 
weight as a covariate. Odds ratios and 95% CI were presented comparing each secukinumab regimen to 
placebo. 
Sensitivity analyses and supportive analyses were conducted in order to provide evidence that the results 
seen from the primary analysis are robust. 
Interactions  between  treatment  and  selected  baseline  demographics  and  disease  characteristics  were 
explored for ASAS 20 response at Week 16. 
In order to determine the robustness of the logistic regression model used for the primary analysis, ASAS 
20  response  at  Week  16  was  also  evaluated  using  a  non-parametric  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA) 
model) with the same independent variables as the logistic regression model. 
The  impact  of  missing  data  on  the  analysis  results  of  ASAS  20  response  was  assessed  as  well  by 
repeating  the  logistic  regression  model  using  different  ways  to  handle  missing  data,  including,  but  not 
limited to, multiple imputation or observed data analysis. 
Missing data for ASAS20/40 response and other binary efficacy variables (e.g., ASAS5/6, etc.) for data up 
to  1-year  (Week  52)  were  handled  as  follows:  patients  who  drop  out  of  the  trial  for  any  reason  were 
considered non-responders from the time they drop out through Week 52; patients who do not have the 
Assessment report

required  data  to  compute  response  (e.g.,  ASAS  components)  at  baseline  and  at  the  specific  time  point 
were classified as non-responders. 
Patients who were un-blinded prior to the scheduled time point were considered non-responders from the 
time  of  un-blinding  up  to  placebo-controlled  period  (Week  24).  The  primary  analysis  used  the  non-
responder imputation. 
Continuous  variables  (e.g.,  ASAS  components)  were  analysed  using  a  mixed  effect  model  repeat 
measurement  (MMRM)  which  is  valid  under  the  missing  at  random  (MAR)  assumption.  As  such,  single-
point  imputation  of  missing  data  was  not  performed  (e.g.,  last  observation  carried  forward,  LOCF).  For 
analyses of these parameters, if all post-baseline values were missing then these missing values were not 
imputed  and this  patient was  removed  from the  analysis  of  the  corresponding  variable, i.e., it  might be 
that  the  number  of  patients  providing  data  to  an  analysis  is  smaller  than  the  number  of  patients  in  the 
FAS. 
In general, the handling of data for patients who were rescued at Week 16 were handled in the following 
fashion (up to Week 24): for binary endpoints, patients were considered non-responders. This was done 
for all treatment regimens in order to minimize bias. 
The  family-wise  error  was  set  to  α=5%  and  it  was  controlled  with  the  proposed  hierarchical  testing 
strategy. Each of the hypotheses (H1 and H2) for the primary objective (ASAS 20 at Week 16) for each 
secukinumab regimen versus placebo was tested simultaneously at α/2. 
Then based on the rejection of one or both (of H1 and H2), the ASAS 40 at Week 16 endpoint was tested 
hierarchically for each dose (through H3 and/or H4). This procedure was continued (pending rejection of 
the null hypotheses) until H15 and/or H16 were/was rejected, then the respective α/2 could be passed on 
to the other secukinumab regimen’s hierarchy of hypotheses, if they were not already rejected at α/2. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 448 patients were screened, and 371 of these patients completed the screening phase and were 
randomized to study treatment. The most common reasons for not completing the screening phase were 
screen failure (13.6%) and subject/guardian decision (2.0%). All other reasons were reported for 0.2% to 
0.4% (1-2 patients) each. 
There  were  371  patients  randomized  equally  to  one  of  three  treatment  groups,  patient  disposition  is 
shown in Table 13. 
Of the 122 patients in the original placebo group, 11 discontinued while on placebo (10 before Week 16 
and 1 at Week 20) and 9 non-responders discontinued after switching to secukinumab treatment.  
Of a total of 112 placebo patients who were re-randomized to secukinumab treatment, 77 were placebo 
non-responders and 35 were placebo responders. Amongst placebo non-responders, discontinuation rates 
were  12.8%  (5  patients)  for  the  75  mg  and  10.5%  (4  patients)  for  the  150  mg  group.  For  the  placebo 
responders,  one patient  discontinued  and  did  so  while on  placebo  at Week  20  due  to  lack of  efficacy  as 
per eCRF reported by the patient and/or investigator.

Recruitment 
Study initiation date: 19 October 2011 (first patient, first visit). 
Study  completion  date:  Not  applicable.  All  patients  had  completed  the  Visit  17  on  Week  52  before  the 
conduct of the current interim analysis (data cut-off date 10 December 2013). 
There were 65 study centres in 14 countries: Belgium (4 centres), Bulgaria (5), Canada (3), France (3), 
Germany  (9),  Italy  (6),  Mexico  (4),  the  Netherlands  (2),  Peru  (5),  Russian  Federation  (6),  Taiwan  (2), 
Turkey (3), United Kingdom (4) and United States (9). 
Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended 3 times (04 August 2011, 10 December 2012 and 22 November 2013). 
The following changes were made to the planned analysis: 
•  The update of handling of missing values  
•  To expand the statistical hierarchy (primary plus ranked secondary variables) to include more 
endpoints which are relevant to determining the overall therapeutic value of a therapy for AS  
•  To align the primary and secondary assessments with the ASAS Handbook 
Comparable proportions of patients across the secukinumab and placebo groups had at least one protocol 
deviation  up  to  Week  16  (27.4%  vs.  22.4%  vs.  21.3%  in  the  secukinumab  10  mg/kg-75  mg, 
secukinumab 10 mg/kg-150 mg and placebo groups, respectively) or up to Week 52 (32.3% vs. 25.6% 
vs.  25.4%  in  the  secukinumab  10  mg/kg-75  mg,  secukinumab  10  mg/kg-150  mg  and  placebo  groups, 
respectively). The most common categories of protocol deviations in both analysis periods were ‘Selection 
criteria  not  met’  and  “Key  procedures  not  performed  as  per  protocol”.  There  were  no  meaningful 
differences in the categories of protocol deviations among the treatment groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/665405/2015 
Page 34/109 
 
  
  
 
 
Approximately half (24/42) of the protocol deviations in the category of “Selection criteria not met” were 
reported in patients who were randomized despite not meeting inclusion criteria with respect to either a 
baseline BASDAI score > 4 or spinal pain > 4 cm (moderate to severe AS) as measured by VAS according 
to BASDAI question 2. These deviations were distributed equally across the 3 treatment groups. Of the 24 
patients  who  did  not  meet  the  BASDAI  entry  criteria,  10  had  a  baseline  total  back  pain  score  >  40.0 
based on two ASAS  core set questions on back pain. Prohibited concomitant medications were taken by 
17 patients across the 3 treatment groups, with no clinically meaningful differences among the groups. 
Baseline data 
The  majority  of  the  patients  (95.4%)  were  <  65  years  of  age,  with  a  median  ranging  from  39.0  years 
(secukinumab  10  mg/kg-150  mg  group)  to  41.0  years  (both  other  treatment  groups.  More  than  two 
thirds  (69.3%)  of  the  patients  were  male.  Most  of  the  patients  (60.9%)  were  of  Caucasian  origin  and 
17.0%  of  Asian  origin,  respectively.  The  prevalence  of  current  smokers  was  23.7%  and  the  mean  BMI 
26.5 kg/m2, with no significant differences between the randomised groups. The prevalence of HLA-B27 
positivity varied between 68.8% and 79.8% in the study groups. 
Baseline disease characteristics are reported in Table 14.

Numbers analysed 
The analysis sets were defined as follows: 
•  Randomized set comprised randomized patients 
• 
FAS  comprised  all  patients  who  were  randomized  and  to  whom  study  treatment  had  been 
assigned. The efficacy analyses are based on the FAS. 
•  Safety  set  comprised  all  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  treatment  during 
the treatment period. The safety analyses are based on the Safety set. 
•  Per-protocol  set  included  all  patients  who  completed  the  study  without  a  major  protocol 
deviation leading to exclusion from the Per-protocol set. 
The analysis sets by treatment sequence are presented in Table 15.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The results of the primary efficacy variable ASAS20 response using non-responder imputation for the FAS 
at Week 16 are shown in Table 16.  
Table 16. ASAS 20 response using non-responder imputation – up to Week 24 (Full analysis 
set, Study F2305) 
Secukinumab  at  both  doses  (10  mg/kg-75  mg  and  10  mg/kg-150  mg)  was  statistically  significantly 
superior to placebo for ASAS20 response at Week 16 (p<0.0001) regardless of TNFαi status: the ASAS20 
Assessment report

response rate was 59.7% for secukinumab 10 mg/kg-75 mg, 60.8% for secukinumab 10 mg/kg-150 mg 
and 28.7% for placebo.  
The ASAS 20 response at Week 16 in the per-protocol analysis set was consistent with that observed in 
the FAS, with the response rate of 61.9% for secukinumab 10 mg/kg-75 mg, 64.8% for secukinumab 10 
mg/kg-150 mg and 30.5% for placebo, respectively (both comparisons, p<0.0001).  
Interactions  between  treatment  and  selected  baseline  demographic  and  disease  characteristics  were 
explored for ASAS 20 response at Week 16. Of the baseline covariates tested, only body weight showed a 
significant  interaction  with  treatment  on  the  ASAS  20  response  at  Week  16  (p=0.0122).  Randomization 
was not stratified by body weight. The difference in ASAS 20 response in favour of IV-75 mg vs. placebo 
was consistent across the weight groups (<70 kg, 70-90 kg, >90 kg), but the efficacy of IV-150 mg vs. 
placebo decreased with increasing body weight. 
TNFαi  naïve  patients  showed  numerically  higher  ASAS  20  response  rates  at  Week  16  (60.0%  for  IV-75 
mg  and  66.3%  for  IV-150  mg  vs.  32.6%  for  placebo)  compared  with  the  patients  with  previous 
insufficient  response  for  TNFαi  (TNF-IR)  (58.8%  for  IV-75  mg  and  45.5%  for  IV-150  mg  vs.  18.2%  for 
placebo).  Consistent  with  the  differences  seen  in  the  overall  response  rates,  treatment  differences  for 
each secukinumab dose vs. placebo were also statistically significant (p<0.05) for both TNFαi naïve and 
TNF-IR patients. 
Secondary endpoints 
Results in terms of secondary efficacy endpoints at week 16 are reported in Table 17.

The  ASAS  40  response  varied  over  time  among  the  TNF-IR  patients:  both  doses  were  associated  with 
higher rates than placebo at Weeks 8 and 20 (both time-points, p<0.05), while only the IV-75 mg dose 
was higher than placebo at Weeks 12 and 16 (both time-points, p<0.05). 
Similar  results  favouring  secukinumab  vs.  placebo  were  observed  up  to  Week  24  for  the  secondary 
endpoints. 
Selected exploratory efficacy analyses 
The  rates  of  ASAS  20  response  observed  for  both  secukinumab  dose  groups  at  the  Week  16  primary 
endpoint  analysis  visit  were  sustained  through  Week  52  and  ASAS  20  responses  were  comparable 
between the two secukinumab dose groups at all analysis visits through Week 52 (Figure 8).

The ASAS 40 response rates achieved in both secukinumab dose groups at the Week 16 primary endpoint 
analysis visit were sustained through Week 52 (see Figure 9) and the two secukinumab dose groups 
showed comparable ASAS 40 response rates at all time-points through Week 52. 
Figure 9. ASAS 40 response using non-responder imputation – up to Week 52 (Full analysis 
set, Study F2305) 
Among the placebo non-responders, the ASAS 20 and ASAS 40 responses increased after switch to active 
treatment  at  Week  16:  at  Week  32  the  ASAS  20  response  rates  were  56.4%  for  the  placebo  non-
responders on 75 mg secukinumab and 50.0% for the placebo non-responders on 150 mg secukinumab, 
respectively. At Week 52, the corresponding response rates were 61.5% (24/39) and 47.4% (18/38). 
There  were  no  treatment  differences  between  the  secukinumab  dose  groups  through  Week  52  in  other 
secondary  efficacy  variables,  including  ASAS  5/6  response,  ASAS  partial  remission,  and  changes  from 
baseline  in  hsCRP,  total  BASDAI,  SF-36  PCS  and  ASQoL.  Comparable levels  of  response  were  sustained 
from Weeks 24 to 52 in both secukinumab groups. 
Secukinumab  was  superior  to  placebo  in  the  change  from  baseline  in  BASMI  linear  score  at  most  time-
points  up  to  Week  24.  At  Week  16,  the  LS  mean  change  from  baseline  was  −0.34  for  IV-75  mg 
(p=0.0502) and −0.40 for IV-150 mg (p=0.0114) vs. −0.12 for placebo. 
At  Week  16,  the  change  from  baseline  in  lateral  spinal  flexion  component  (score),  one  of  the  six  ASAS 
domains used to determine the ASAS 5/6 response, was −0.529 for IV-75 mg and −0.462 for IV-150 mg 
vs. −0.312 for placebo. MRI of the spine and sacroiliac joints was performed on a subset of TNF-αi naïve 
patients at selected study sites (34 patients in the IV-75 mg group; 38 patients in the IV-150 mg group; 
and  33  patients  in  the  placebo  group),  with  analysis  of  the  following  3  MRI  variables:  Berlin  sacroiliac 
joint  total  edema  score,  total  ASspi-MRI-a  score,  and  Berlin  spine  score.  The  change  from  baseline  at 
Week 16 is reported in Table 18.

Study F2310 
Study  F2310  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  phase  III  multicentre  study  of 
subcutaneous  secukinumab  in  prefilled  syringes  to  demonstrate  the  efficacy  at  16  weeks  and  to  assess 
the long-term efficacy, safety and tolerability up to 5 years in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis 
(Report date 26 November 2014) 
Methods 
Study participants 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical to Study F2305. 
Treatment 
The study design is presented in Figure 10. 
A screening period of 4-10 weeks before randomization was followed by a blinded treatment period of 52 
weeks and an additional long-term treatment of 4 years. At baseline, patients were randomized (1:1:1) 
to one of the three treatment groups: 
•  Group 1: secukinumab 75 mg plus placebo 150 mg once weekly at baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4, 
followed by dosing every four weeks starting at Week 4. 
•  Group  2:  secukinumab  150  mg  plus  placebo  75  mg  once  weekly  at  BSL,  Weeks  1,  2,  3  and  4, 
followed by dosing every four weeks starting at Week 4. 
•  Group 3: placebo 75 mg and placebo 150 mg once weekly at BSL, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed 
by dosing every four weeks starting at Week 4.

Page 44/109 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
At  Week  16  (Visit  8),  all  patients  on  placebo  were  re-randomized  to  receive  secukinumab  75  mg  plus 
placebo  150  mg  sc  or  150  mg  secukinumab  plus  75  mg  placebo  sc.  After  Week  52  analyses  were 
conducted,  the  study  personnel  and  patients  were  un-blinded  to  treatment,  i.e.,  the  placebo  injections 
were discontinued. Rescue treatment was not allowed until Week 20. 
Objectives 
The  primary,  secondary,  and  exploratory  objectives  were  identical  with  those  of  Study  F2305,  with 
exception  of  the  assessment  of  treatment  on  radiographic  findings  and  bone  mineral  density,  not 
investigated in Study F2310. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary and the secondary efficacy variables as well as safety and other assessments were identical 
to those of Study F2305, except that assessment of joint/bone structural damage was not performed. 
Sample size 
An overall type I error (2-sided) 5% was used to control type I error. Since two secukinumab doses were 
tested versus placebo with respect to the primary endpoint (ASAS20 response at Week 16), the type-I-
error was split to 2.5% two-sided for each comparison. For 90% power and assuming a response rate of 
20% in the placebo group, at least 39 subjects per group were needed to show a response rate of 60% in 
the secukinumab groups based on Fisher’s exact test. In this study population, a placebo response rate of 
about 20% after 14 weeks has been reported. 
In  order  to  collect  additional  safety  information  on  the  use  of  secukinumab  in  this  population,  222 
subjects  were  equally  allocated  to  three  treatment  groups  (74  subjects  in  each  treatment  group), 
stratifying for prior treatment or not with TNFai treatment. The study had at least 60% TNFai treatment 
naive subjects. The power of the test for the primary endpoint based on 74 subjects per group was over 
99%.

Randomisation 
At  baseline  (Visit  2),  all  eligible  patients  were  randomized  in  a  ratio  to  1:1:1  to  one  of  the  treatment 
arms. The patients were stratified according to being either TNF-IR or TNF-αi naïve status. Approximately 
40% of the patients had to be TNF-IR to ensure a representative patient population for the assessment of 
efficacy and safety. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. 
Statistical methods 
Refer to evaluation of study F2305. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 253 patients were screened, and 219 of these patients completed the screening phase and were 
randomized to study treatment. The most common reasons for not completing the screening phase were 
screen failure (10.3%) and subject/guardian decision (2.4%). 
The patient disposition up to Week 16 and Week 52 is reported in Table 19 and Table 20, respectively.

Recruitment 
Study initiation date: 18 October 2012 (first patient first visit). 
Study  completion  date:  Not  applicable.  All  patients  had  completed  the  Visit  17  on  Week  52  before  the 
conduct of the current interim analysis (data cut-off date 4 August 2014). 
There  were  54  study  centres  in  13  countries:  Austria  (2),  Canada  (4),  Czech  Rep  (4),  Finland  (5), 
Germany  (3),  Italy  (3),  Netherlands  (2),  Russian  Federation  (7),  Singapore  (2),  Spain  (4),  Switzerland 
(3), United Kingdom (4) and United States (11). 
Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended once (22 November 2013). 
The following changes were made to the planned analysis: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To limit the blinded period of study medication for patients to 52 weeks. 
To  expand  the  statistical  hierarchy  (primary  plus  ranked  secondary  variables)  to  include  more 
endpoints which are relevant to determining the overall therapeutic value of a therapy for AS and 
to include also the TNF-IR patients in the FAS population. 
To align the primary and secondary assessments with the ASAS Handbook. 
To limit the blinding for study medication for sponsor to 16 weeks (the time point for assessment 
of primary efficacy endpoint). 
Comparable proportions of patients across the secukinumab and placebo groups had at least one protocol 
deviation up to Week 16 (28.8% vs. 26.4% vs. 29.7% in the secukinumab  75 mg, secukinumab 150 mg 
and placebo groups, respectively) or up to Week 52 (34.2% vs. 29.2% vs. 33.8% in the secukinumab 75 
mg,  secukinumab  150  mg  and  placebo  groups,  respectively).  The  most  common  category  of  protocol 
deviations  in  both  analysis  periods  (n=40  and  n=45,  respectively)  with  no  difference  in  the  occurrence 
between the groups was “Treatment deviation”. Vast majority of these cases were related with premature

administration  of  study  during  the  first  4  weeks  of  the  Study  i.e.,  less  than  7  days  after  the  previous 
administration.  No  patient  had  a  protocol  deviation  that  led  to  exclusion  from  the  FAS  or  Safety  set.  A 
small proportion of patients in all treatment groups had a protocol deviation that led to exclusion from the 
Per-protocol  set,  most  of  these  protocol  deviations  were  in  the  categories  of  ‘Selection  criteria  not  met’ 
(n=6)(i.e.,,  patient  did  not  meet  BASDAI  criteria  at  baseline)  and  “Treatment  deviation”  (n=4)  (I.e., 
incorrect study medication given). 
Baseline data 
The  majority  of  the  patients  (96.8%)  were  <  65  years  of  age,  with  a  median  ranging  from  41.0  years 
(secukinumab  150  mg  group)  to  46.0  years  (secukinumab  75  mg  group).  Approximately  two  thirds 
(69.9%) of the patients were male. The vast majority of the patients (95.4%) were of Caucasian origin. 
The  prevalence  of  current  smoking  was  32.9%  and  the  mean  BMI  27.5  kg/m2,  with  no  significant 
differences between the randomized groups. The prevalence of verified HLA-B27 positivity varied between 
72.6% and 79.2% in the randomized groups.

Numbers analysed 
The analysis sets were defined as follows: 
•  Randomised set comprised randomized patients 
• 
FAS  comprised  all  patients  who  were  randomized  and  to  whom  study  treatment  had  been 
assigned. The efficacy analyses are based on the FAS. 
•  Safety  set  comprised  all  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  treatment  during  the 
treatment period. The safety analyses are based on the Safety set. 
• 
Per-protocol set included all patients who completed the study without a major protocol deviation 
leading to exclusion from the FAS. 
The analysis sets by treatment sequence are presented in Table 22. 
Table 22. Analysis sets by treatment sequence (Randomised set, Study F2310) 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The results of the primary efficacy variable ASAS20 response using non-responder imputation for the FAS 
at Week 16 are shown in Table 23.  
Table 23. ASAS 20 response using non-responder imputation – up to Week 16 (Full analysis

The ASAS 20 response at Week 16 in the Per-protocol Set analysis was consistent with that observed in 
the FAS, with the response rates of 40.8%, 61.2% and 26.8% for secukinumab 75 mg, secukinumab 150 
mg  and      placebo  groups,  respectively  (for  comparison  between  secukinumab  150  mg  and  placebo, 
p<0.0001).  
TNFαi  naïve  patients  showed  numerically  higher  ASAS  20  response  rates  at  Week  16  (51.1%  for 
secukinumab  75  mg,  68.2%  for  secukinumab  150  mg  and  31.1%  for  placebo,  respectively)  compared 
with the TNF-IR patients (25.0% for secukinumab 75 mg, 50.0% for secukinumab 150 mg and 24.1% for 
placebo, respectively). 
Secondary endpoints 
Results in terms of secondary efficacy endpoints are shown in Table 24 and Figure 11.

Figure 11. ASAS 40 response using non-responder imputation – up to Week 16 (Full analysis 
set, Study F2310) 
The profile of ASAS 40 response over the 16 weeks for the TNFαi naïve patients was similar to the overall 
population:  both  secukinumab  dose  groups  achieved  at  least  numerically  higher  response  rates  than 
placebo  at  all  analysis  visits,  but  the  difference  in  response  rate  at  Week  16 was  statistically  significant 
only with the secukinumab 150 mg group (odds ratio 3.46, 95% CI 1.22 to 10.67). The response varied 
over time among the TNF-IR patients (n=85). Both doses of secukinumab were however associated with 
higher  response  rates  than  placebo  at  Week  16  (p=0.0469  and  p=0.009  for  secukinumab  75  mg  and 
secukinumab 150 mg group, respectively). 
Selected exploratory efficacy analyses 
The rates of ASAS 20 and ASAS 40 response up to Week 52 are presented in Figure 12 and Figure 13, 
respectively.

There  were  no  treatment  differences  between  the  secukinumab  dose  groups  through  Week  52  in  other 
secondary  efficacy  variables,  including  ASAS  5/6  response,  ASAS  partial  remission,  and  changes  from 
baseline  in  hsCRP,  total  BASDAI,  SF-36  PCS  and  ASQoL.  Comparable  levels  of  response  were  sustained 
from  Weeks  24  to  52  in  both  secukinumab  groups.  Both  secukinumab  dose  groups  had  numerically 
greater improvements from baseline compared with the placebo group in the patient’s global assessment 
of disease activity (VAS), total spinal pain, inflammation assessed by BASDAI questions 5 and 6, BASFI, 
BASDAI  50  and  in  nocturnal  back  pain  at  Week  16.  These  differences  were  statistically  significant 
compared to placebo with all above-mentioned variables, with the exception of secukinumab 75 mg group 
in  the  patient’s  global  assessment  of  disease  activity  (VAS)  variable  (p=0.0506).  The  improvements 
observed in all of these variables with both secukinumab groups were sustained up to Week 52.

The  change  in  BASMI  linear  score  was  numerically  greater  in  the  secukinumab  150  mg  group  (the  LS 
mean  change  -0.51)  compared  to  secukinumab  75  mg  (-0.29)  and  placebo  groups  (-0.22),  with  no 
statistical  difference  compared  to  placebo  (p=0.0533).  At  Week  16,  the  change  from  baseline  in  lateral 
spinal flexion component (score), one of the six ASAS domains used to determine the ASAS 5/6 response, 
was  −0.617  for  secukinumab  75  mg,  −0.344  for  secukinumab  150  mg  and  −0.334  for  placebo, 
respectively.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The pooled efficacy analyses are based on FAS of the pivotal studies F2305 and F2310. The total number 
of  randomized  AS  patients  was  altogether  590.  The  patient  population  analysed  for  combined  efficacy 
data consisted only of patients on secukinumab with a dose having shown efficacy in the pivotal studies 
(secukinumab 10 mg/kg-75 mg, secukinumab 10 mg/kg-150 mg and secukinumab 150 mg sc; n=321). 
Demographics of the patients in the Studies F2305 and F2310 were broadly similar, with the exception of 
slightly heavier patients in the Study F2310 (median weight 80 kg vs. 74 kg). The median time since the 
diagnosis  of  AS  was  somewhat  longer  in  the  patients  of  Study  F2305  (5.0  years  vs.  2.9  years).  27.0% 
and  38.8%  of  the  patients  had  a  history  of  previous  use  of  TNFαi  in  the  Studies  F2305  and  F2310, 
respectively.  The  variables  reflecting  activity of  AS  (e.g.,  BASDAI,  hCRP)  were  very  similar  between  the 
Studies. 
The vast majority of patients in both studies completed Week 52 (pooled secukinumab group: 86.6%). In 
both  studies,  the  most  common  reason  for  premature  discontinuation  was  the  occurrence  of  AEs,  which 
was  reported  with  similar  frequency  in  pooled  placebo  (5.6%)  and  pooled  secukinumab  (5.9%)  groups. 
Discontinuations  due  to  the  lack  of  efficacy  also  occurred  at  comparable  rates  between  pooled 
secukinumab (3.4%) and pooled placebo groups (5.6%). 
The primary efficacy endpoint of superiority compared to placebo in ASAS 20 response rate at Week 16 
was  reached  with  comparable  rates  in  secukinumab  10  mg/kg-75  mg,  secukinumab  10  mg/kg-150  mg 
and secukinumab 150 mg sc groups (59.7%, 60.8% and 61.1%, respectively vs. 28.4-28.7% in placebo 
groups). The ASAS 20 responses were achieved rapidly from Week 1 onwards  (Figure 14).

Both secukinumab groups showed better efficacy in all secondary endpoints compared to placebo at Week 
16  in  Study  F2305.  In  Study  F2310,  the  secukinumab  150  mg  s.c  was  superior  to  placebo  with  all 
secondary  efficacy  endpoints  except  with  ASAS  partial  remission.  Of  note,  although  not  reaching 
statistical  significance  the  secukinumab  75  mg  sc  group  showed  also  numerically  greater  response 
compared to placebo in all primary and secondary endpoints, including the changes in hCRP and in total 
BASDAI  (see  Figure  15).  The  proportion  of  patients  reaching  ASAS  partial  remission  was  numerically 
very  similar  in  all  secukinumab  groups  of  both  studies,  although  these  changes  were  statistically 
significant only in the larger Study F2305 (see Figure 16). 
Numerically  (not  statistically  tested)  somewhat  greater  improvements  were  reported  for  both 
secukinumab groups in Study F2305, but not for secukinumab 150 mg sc group in Study F2310 compared 
to placebo in lateral lumbar flexion score of the BASMI components at Week 16.

The ASAS 20 and ASAS 40 response rates achieved in all secukinumab groups of both studies at Week 16 
were  sustained  through  Week  52  (see  Figures  17  and  18).  Interestingly,  the  ASAS  20  and  ASAS  40 
response rates at Week 52 were very similar between the secukinumab groups in the Study F2305. The 
corresponding  response  rates  in  Study  F2310  were  somewhat  greater  in  the  secukinumab  150  mg  sc 
group compared to the secukinumab 75 mg sc group in the Study F2310 ( 73.8% vs. 63.9% and 57.4% 
vs.  41.0%,  respectively).  Among  the  patients  randomized  from  placebo  to  secukinumab  at  Week  16  in 
Study F2310, the ASAS 20 response rates at Week 52 were somewhat greater in patients randomized to 
secukinumab  150  mg  than  in  the  lower  dose  group  (75.0%  vs.  59.3%).  Correspondingly,  the  ASAS  20 
response rates at Week 52 in the patients randomized to placebo at baseline in Study F2305 were 61.5% 
and 47.4% in the patients receiving 75 mg and 150 mg secukinumab sc, respectively. 
In  both  studies,  the  improvements  achieved  at  Week  16  in  all  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were 
sustained through Week 52. There were no statistically significant differences in the treatment responses 
in respect of these variables between the secukinumab groups in either of the pivotal studies. 
In pre-specified sub-group analysis, the effect of secukinumab on ASAS 20 response at Week 16 was not 
dependent of baseline age, gender, race or region of the patients (see Figure 19). In subgroup analysis 
stratified  by  body  weight  (<70  kg,  70-90  kg,  >90  kg),  the  response  rates  with  secukinumab  were 
numerically  declining  along  with  the  increasing  weight.  The  treatment  response  in  favour  of  pooled 
secukinumab  group  was  significant  in  all  weight  groups.  However,  the  difference  in  treatment  response 
between secukinumab 150 mg sc and placebo was not statistically significant in patients weighing>90 kg. 
The  effect  of  secukinumab  on  primary  efficacy  outcome  did  not  significantly  vary  according  to  disease 
activity (e.g., hCRP, BASDAI) at baseline. 
The analysis of ASAS 20 response at Week 16 stratified by the baseline TNFαi status and the reason for 
stopping  previous  TNFαi  treatment  is  presented  in Figure  20.  According  to  this  analysis,  the  treatment 
response  with  secukinumab  was  irrespective  of  the  TNFαi  status  (TNFαi  naïve  or  TNF-IR),  but  the 
treatment  benefit  was  not  statistically  significant  in  patients  who  had  stopped  previous  TNFαi  treatment 
due to tolerability problems. However, the latter analysis is restricted by a limited number of patients in 
this TNF-IR subgroup.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The AS clinical development program included two phase II studies (A2209 in AS patients and F2201 in a 
related arthritic indication with RA patients) and two pivotal phase III studies in AS (F2305 and F2310). 
Efficacy data up to Week 52 in both pivotal studies were provided. 
Recommendations  of  the  EMA  clinical  guidance  for  AS  (Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal 
product for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, CPMP/EWP/4891/03) were mostly taken into account 
in the clinical development programme. Missing elements included the lack of active comparator and the 
lack of dedicated assessment of spinal mobility as a secondary endpoint. The lack of these elements was 
adequately justified by the MAH and considered acceptable by the CHMP. No CHMP Scientific advice had 
been sought in the current indication. All studies were conducted in compliance with GCP. 
The initial doses and the dosing regimen in phase II studies were based on preclinical in vivo efficacy data 
in  animal  models  which  were  evaluated  during  the  initial  MAA  and  pharmacokinetic  modeling  from  the 
psoriasis studies. The two phase II studies A2209 and F2201 provided preliminary evidence of efficacy in 
two  arthritic  disease  models,  AS  and  RA.  The  posology  carried  forward  to  the  phase  III  studies  was 
mainly  based  on  PK/PD  modeling  and  simulation  of  different  treatment  regimens  as  well  as  data  in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/665405/2015 
Page 72/109 
 
  
  
 
 
psoriasis.  
The  study  population  in  phase  III  studies  consisted  of  adults  with  active  moderate  to  severe  AS.  They 
fulfilled  the  modified  New  York  criteria  for  diagnosis  of  AS.  The  disease  activity  was  based  on 
measurements of BASDAI (> 4) and spinal pain VAS (> 4 cm). The CHMP noted however that given the 
characteristics of the patients studied in the pivotal studies (with respect to BASDAI score and degree of 
spinal  pain)  “active  AS”  may  be  a  more  relevant  definition  comparted  to  “active,  severe  AS”  as  was 
initially proposed by the MAH.  
Study  F2305  was  a  double-blind,  randomized,  parallel-group,  placebo-controlled  study.  52-week  interim 
analyses of the 2-year study were provided, with the assessment of the primary efficacy variable of ASAS 
20 response at Week 16. Loading regimen was secukinumab 10 mg/kg iv at baseline and at Weeks 2 and 
4,  followed  by  maintenance  treatment  with  75  mg  or  150  mg  sc  q4w.  The  efficacy  variables  chosen 
covered  relevant  aspects  of  the  disease  except  for  the  lack  of  dedicated  assessment  of  spinal  mobility. 
MRI  of  spine  and  sacroiliac  joints  was  assessed  only  in  a  subgroup  of  TNFαi  naïve  patients  at  selected 
study sites. BMD of the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck was assessed in all patients. With regard 
to  statistical  methods,  the  missing  at  random  (MAR)  assumption  for  missing  data  in  MMRM  analyses 
without any sensitive analyses for continuous endpoints is questionable. However, appropriate sensitivity 
analyses were provided by the Applicant afterwards. 
The  design  of  Study  F2310  was  otherwise  identical  to  that  of  Study  F2305,  but  the  iv  loading  regimen 
was  replaced  by  sc  loading  regimen  that  is  similar  to  that  approved  for  the  treatment  of  psoriasis  (sc 
dosing  at  baseline,  Weeks  1,  2,  3  and  4  and  then  q4w).  No  assessment  of  progression  of  structural 
damage was performed in this study.  
The  percentage  of  subjects  with  treatment  deviation  in  study  F2310  was  around  one  third,  which  was 
considered high. The MAH was asked to display what types of errors occurred, and the possible impact on 
the  study  results  and  clarified  what  types  of  treatment  deviations  occurred.  The  CHMP  agreed  that  it 
would have been unlikely that, the by far, most common deviation, short visit window during sc loading 
period,  would  have  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  result.  In  study  F2305  there  was  a  remarkably  high 
number  of  selection  criteria  not  met,  and  key  procedures  not  performed  as  per  protocol.  The  MAH 
provided  acceptable  explanations  on  how  the  most  frequent  deviations,  (low  VAS  pain  at  BL  and  study 
treatment  administered  by  unblinded  personnel)  occurred,  and  what  corrective  action  was  taken.  A 
sensitivity analysis was performed and the results were consistent with the full analysis set. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In  Study  F2305,  371  patients  were  randomized  to  each  of  the  3  treatment  groups  (secukinumab  10 
mg/kg-75 mg, secukinumab 10 mg/kg-150 mg group and the placebo group. Demographics and baseline 
disease  activity  were  generally  comparable  across  the  treatment  groups.  The  placebo  patients  were 
randomized  either  at  Week  16  (placebo  non-responders)  or  at  Week  24  (placebo  responders)  to 
secukinumab 75 mg or 150 mg. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of ASAS 20 response was achieved as secukinumab at both 10 mg/kg-75 
mg  and  10  mg/kg-150  mg  doses  was  statistically  significantly  superior  to  placebo  at  Week  16 
(p<0.0001).  The  ASAS  20  response  rates  at  Week  16  were  59.7%  for  secukinumab  10  mg/kg-75  mg, 
60.8% for secukinumab 10 mg/kg-150 mg and 28.7% for placebo. Superior response rates compared to 
placebo were seen as early as from Week 1 onwards. 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  (responses of  ASAS  40,  ASAS  5/6  and  ASAS  partial  remission;  changes  in 
BASDAI,  hCRP,  SF-36  and  ASQoL)  were  met  for  both  secukinumab  doses  without  any  apparent  dose-
response. 
For  Study  F2310,  a  total of  219  patients  were  randomized to  3 treatment  groups:  secukinumab  75  mg, 
150 mg and placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was achieved with secukinumab dose 150 mg, which 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/665405/2015 
Page 73/109 
 
  
  
 
was  statistically  significantly  superior  to  placebo  for  ASAS20  response  at  Week  16  (p<0.0001).  The 
difference in response rate between secukinumab 75 mg dose and placebo was not statistically significant 
(p=0.0967).  The  ASAS  20  response  rates  at  Week  16  were  41.1%  for  secukinumab  75  mg,  61.1%  for 
secukinumab 150 mg and 28.4% for placebo. For the 150 mg dose, statistically superior response rates 
compared to placebo were seen already from Week 1 onwards. 
All  secondary  endpoints  except  for  ASAS  partial  remission  at  Week  16  were  met  with  the  150  mg  dose 
group compared with placebo. 
Within analyses performed across trials, similar efficacy at Week 16 based on assessment of primary and 
secondary  outcomes  was  seen  for  both  secukinumab  dose  groups  in  Study  F2305  and  for  the 
secukinumab 150 mg dose group in Study F2310. According to the results of the both pivotal studies, the 
loading regimen is an efficient method to achieve rapid relief of AS symptoms. 
Although the ASAS 20 response at Week 16 was numerically somewhat more pronounced in TNFαi naïve 
patients, a significant treatment effect was seen also with TNF-IR patients as early as Week 1. The small 
number  of  patients  in  the  TNF-IR  subgroups  (reason  for  stopping  TNFαi)  limited  the  conclusions  of  the 
further analyses in this subgroup. 
The  improvements  in  ASAS  20  response,  ASAS  40  response  and  also  in  other  secondary  efficacy 
endpoints achieved in all secukinumab groups of both studies at Week 16 were sustained through Week 
52. Interestingly, the ASAS 20 and ASAS 40 response rates between the secukinumab groups at Week 52 
were very similar in the Study F2305. The corresponding response rates at Week 52 in Study F2310 were 
numerically somewhat greater in the secukinumab 150 mg sc group compared to the secukinumab 75 mg 
sc  group  in  the  Study  F2310,  but  with  no  statistical  significance.  Among  the  patients  randomized  from 
placebo  to  secukinumab  at  Week  16  in  Study  F2310,  the  ASAS  20  response  rates  at  Week  52  were 
somewhat greater in patients randomized to secukinumab 150 mg than in the 75 mg dose group, but in 
Study  F2305  the  patients  re-randomized  to  secukinumab  75  mg  showed  numerically  greater  ASAS 
response  compared  to  secukinumab  150  mg  group.  In  addition,  there  were  no  statistically  significant 
differences  in  the  treatment  responses  in  respect  of  all  secondary  endpoints  between  the  secukinumab 
groups in either of the pivotal studies.  
Data from Study F2305 and Study F2310 were pooled for subgroup analyses. ”AIN457 pooled” consisted 
of  the  regimens  that  demonstrated  statistical  significance  across  the  primary  and  key  secondary 
endpoints  from  Study  F2310  (150  mg  sc  only)  and  Study  F2305  (both  iv-75  mg  and  iv-  150  mg 
regimens) and were evaluated by subgroup in comparison to a pooled placebo (F2310 and F2305) group. 
Considering  however  the  use  of  different  induction  regimens  in  the  two  studies,  the  same  subgroup 
analyses which were performed on the pooled dataset, was requested for each study separately and was 
provided  by  the  MAH.  Although  small  subgroups  limited  conclusions,  compared  to  the  outcomes  in 
primary  analyses  of  ASAS  20  and  ASAS  40,  similar  trends  were  shown  supporting  consistent  outcomes 
across subgroups also within each study respectively. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Both phase III studies met the primary endpoint of superiority over placebo in ASAS 20 response rate at 
Week 16. Three induction + maintenance dose regimens were shown to induce a clinically significant and 
durable response. Based on subgroup analyses, secukinumab was considered as an efficacious treatment 
alternative for AS patients with previous use of TNFαi. 
Other  endpoints  related  to  joint  and  skin  disease,  physical  function  and  health-related  quality  of  life 
consistently showed clinically relevant efficacy of secukinumab in the treatment of AS.

2.4.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The  secukinumab  development  program  studied  7048  patients,  including  6200  patients  exposed  to  at 
least  one  dose of  secukinumab  in  any  indication,  and  6267  patient-years  of secukinumab  exposure,  are 
included  in  the  safety  pooling.  The  safety  data  in  the  present  submission  provided  an  additional  2679 
patient-years  of  secukinumab  exposure  (75%  increase),  including  955  patient-years  of  exposure  in  PsA 
patients  and  691  patient-years  of  exposure  in  AS  patients,  beyond  the  3588  patient-years  of  exposure 
reported previously for the psoriasis development program. 
Patient exposure 
Table 27. Exposure to secukinumab across Pools A and C in the entire treatment period 
The first data pool (A) consisted of the 2 pivotal placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials in AS (CAIN457F2305 
and CAIN457F2310) that allowed risks to be evaluated in the AS population during the first 16 weeks of 
treatment  and  during  the  entire  treatment  period  (median  66  weeks  of  exposure  to  secukinumab).  The 
baseline characteristics of the patients included in this pool are summarised in Table 28. 
In order to keep a consistent naming convention across indications within the secukinumab program, the 
naming convention of Pool A, Pool B (where required) and Pool C was maintained in the analysis provided 
by the MAH. However, as there were no additional studies in AS evaluating the same treatment regimen 
as in the pivotal Phase 3 AS studies, there was no designated Pool B data pool for AS. 
The largest data pool (C), which includes all patients treated with secukinumab in 42 studies for which an 
interim  or  final  CSR  is  currently  available,  maximized  the  chances  of  observing  rare  events  of  MACE 
(major adverse cardiovascular events) and malignancy in patients receiving secukinumab. Excluded from 
Pool  C  were  very  small  studies  enrolling  primarily  healthy  volunteers.  The  current  submission  added  8 
additional  studies  to  Pool  C  reported  as  part  of  the  psoriasis  application:  2  in  the  target  AS  indication 
Study CAIN457F2305 and Study CAIN457F2310 and 6 in other indications, Study CAIN457A2302E1 and 
Study  CAIN457A2304E1  in  psoriasis;  Study  CAIN457F2306  and  Study  CAIN457F2312  in  psoriatic 
arthritis,  Study  CAIN457B2203  in  multiple  sclerosis;  and  Study  CPJMR0012201  in  polymyalgia 
rheumatica.  This  provided  an  additional  1702  secukinumab-treated  patients  with  2679  patient-years  of 
exposure compared to the psoriasis program.

Adverse events 
Induction and placebo controlled study period of Pool A  
During the short-term (16-week) period of the pivotal, placebo-controlled AS studies in Pool A, the most 
frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) in the “Any secukinumab dose group” were 
nasopharyngitis, dyslipidemia, headache, nausea, and oropharyngeal pain. The absolute incidence of AEs 
was  slightly  higher  in  the  “Any  secukinumab  group”  compared  with  placebo,  mainly  due  to  increased 
rates  of  nasopharyngitis  and  dyslipidemia  in  the  secukinumab-treated  group. During  the  first  16  weeks, 
infections  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  “Any  secukinumab  group”  compared  with  the  placebo  group, 
mainly  due  to  increased  rates  of  mild  to  moderate  upper  respiratory  tract  infections  (high  level  term, 
HLT)  such  as  nasopharyngitis  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (preferred  terms,  PTs).  No  case  of 
upper respiratory tract infection was serious or led to study drug discontinuation. 
The most frequent AEs in this data set are presented in Table 29.

Most  dyslipidemia  events  occurred  in  the  iv  loading  dose  groups.  When  compared  to  the  individual 
laboratory values over time, these dyslipidemia AEs as reported by the investigators were not indicative 
of clinically meaningful changes in cholesterol since in the Any secukinumab group, the majority of shifts 
in  cholesterol  that  occurred  were  from  normal  range  to  Grade  1,  and  the  incidence  of  these  shifts  was 
comparable to that observed in the placebo group. 
Entire studies 
Over  the  entire  treatment  period,  the  most  frequently  affected  SOCs  in  the  “Any  secukinumab  group” 
were  infections  and  infestations  (mainly  nasopharyngitis  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection), 
gastrointestinal  disorders  (mainly  diarrhea),  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (mainly 
arthralgia, back pain, and musculoskeletal pain), and nervous system disorders (mainly headache). 
The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was comparable between the “Any 150 mg group”(84.0%) and 
the “Any 75 mg group (79.2%). SOCs that had a > 3% higher incidence in the “Any 150 mg group” vs. 
the “Any 75 mg group were skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and investigations. The PTs within the 
skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders SOC that had a > 1% higher incidence in the “Any 150 mg group” 
vs  the  “Any  75  mg  group”  were  pruritis  (2.4%  vs  1.4%,  respectively),  dermatitis  (1.7%  vs  0.7%, 
respectively),  and  dermatosis  (1.0%  vs  0.0%,  respectively).  The  PTs  within  the  investigations  SOC  that 
had a > 1% higher incidence in the “Any 150 mg group” vs. the “Any 75 mg group” were osteoprotegerin 
decreased  (2.4%  vs  0.4%,  respectively)  and  blood  cholesterol  increased  (1.7%  vs  0.7%,  respectively). 
Osteoprotegerin is a bone biomarker whose levels were assessed in patients in Study CAIN457F2305.  
Clinically  meaningful  differences  where  the  absolute  incidence  of  individual  PTs  was  >  2%  higher  in  the 
“Any 150 mg group” vs the “Any 75 mg group” were not observed (Table 30). PTs that were reported in 
>  5  additional  patients  in  the  “Any  150  mg  group”  vs.  the  “Any  75  mg  group”  were  nasopharyngitis, 
headache,  influenza,  back  pain,  pain  in  extremity,  dizziness,  spinal  pain,  osteoprotegerin  decreased, 
tonsillitis,  non-cardiac  chest  pain,  and  osteoporosis.  None  of  these  PTs  showed  a  dose-dependent 
difference  in  frequency  during  the  short-term  16-week  period  and  none  of  these  differences  were 
considered to be clinically meaningful. 
Adverse drug reactions 
Up to Week 16 (Pool A), the overall profile of AEs related to study treatment was similar to that observed 
for  all  treatment-emergent  AEs  (Tables  31  and  32).  AEs  related  to  study  treatment  were  comparable 
between the “Any secukinumab group” (25.9%) and the placebo group (26.5%). Patients in the 150 mg 
sc  group  reported  AEs  related  to  study  treatment  more  frequently  than  the  75  mg  sc  group  (26.4%  vs 
17.8%,  respectively).  This  difference  was  driven  mainly  by  the  AEs  injection  site  pain  (5.6%  vs  0%, 
respectively),  nasopharyngitis  (4.2%  vs.  1.4%,  respectively),  headache  (4.2%  vs  1.4%,  respectively), 
oral  herpes  (2.8%  vs  0%,  respectively)  and  pain  in  extremity  (2.8%  vs  0%,  respectively).  Overall,  the 
frequency of AEs related to study treatment was higher in the iv loading groups (secukinumab iv-75 mg 
and  iv-150  mg)  compared  with  the  sc  loading  groups  (secukinumab  75  mg  and  150  mg).  The  largest 
differences  between  the  iv  loading  groups  and  the  sc  loading  groups  were  in  the  incidences  of  the  PTs 
leukopenia, fatigue, dyslipidaemia, and headache. Infections and infestations (mainly nasopharyngitis and 
upper  respiratory  tract  infection)  were  the  AEs  that  most  frequently  required  concomitant  medication 
(39.8%)  in  the  “Any  secukinumab  group”.  The  crude  incidence  of  AEs  requiring  concomitant  medication 
was  71.2%  for  the  75  mg  sc  group,  68.1%  for  the  150  mg  150  mg  sc  group,  62.9%  for  the  iv-75  mg 
group, 71.2% for the iv-150 mg group, 56.3% for the 75 mg no-load group, and 57.8% for the 150 mg 
no-load group. In general, the profile of AEs requiring concomitant medication was similar to that for all 
treatment-emergent AEs across all treatment groups.

Median  follow  up  in  Pool A  was  66  weeks.  Similarly  to  weeks  0  to  16,  in  the entire  study  period the  AE 
profile  closely  resembles  that  seen  in  the  psoriasis-studies,  where  nasopharyngitis,  URTIs,  arthralgia, 
hypertension,  diarrhoea,  back  pain,  pruritus,  cough,  psoriasis,  and  oropharyngeal pain  were the  top ten 
preferred terms for AEs. 
Exposure  adjusted  incidences  for  dyslipidaemia  were  4.8%  in  any  secukinumab  group  vs  11.4%  in 
placebo patients. Hypercholesterolemia 1.8% vs 8.1%, and hyperlipidaemia 1.3% vs 6.4% respectively. 
Leukopenia was observed in 3.6% in any 75 mg secukinumab group 3.0% in 150 mg group and 1.6% in 
placebo group, notably the most cases were evident in the iv-loaded patients.. 
Treatment  emergent  adverse  events  (TAEs)  from  study  F2305  occurring  more  frequently  in  the 
secukinumab  group  were  nasopharyngitis,  diarrhoea,  URTI,  dyslipidaemia,  pharyngitis,  influenza, 
leukopenia, back pain, nausea, and neutropenia. And similarly from study F2310, nasopharyngitis, URTI, 
hypertension, influenza, bronchitis, oral herpes, pharyngitis and tonsillitis.

The overall profile of AEs related to study treatment during the entire treatment period was comparable 
to  that  observed  up  to  Week  16.  A  higher  rate  of  AEs  related  to  study  treatment  was  observed  in  the 
“Any  150  mg  group”  (44.9%)  vs  the  “Any  75  mg  group”  (34.9%).  The  AEs  that  showed  an  increased 
incidence  of  >  2%  in  the “Any  150  mg  group”  vs  the  “Any  75  mg  group”  were  nausea  (2.4%  vs  0.4%, 
respectively),  nasopharyngitis  (7.3%  vs  3.5%,  respectively),  pharyngitis  (3.8%  vs  0.7%,  respectively), 
headache  (5.2%  vs  1.8%,  respectively)  and  oral  herpes  (2.8%  vs.  0.7%,  respectively).  The  crude 
incidence of AEs possibly related to study treatment was 31.5% in the 75 mg sc group, 41.7% in the 150 
mg sc group, 38.7% in the iv-75 mg group, 52.0% in the iv-150 mg group, 32.2% in the 75 mg no-load 
group, and 37.8% in the 150 mg no-load group. 
AEs causing dose interruption or adjustment  
In  study  F2305  and  F2310,  study  treatment  dose  adjustments  were  not  permitted.  Study  treatment 
interruption was permitted only if, in the opinion of the investigator, a patient’s safety was deemed to be 
at risk unless dosing was interrupted. 
The incidence of AEs causing dose interruption in the “Any secukinumab group” was 13.3%. Overall, the 
rate  of  AEs  was  comparable  between  the  Any  75  mg  and  Any  150  mg  groups  (12.3%  and  14.3%, 
respectively). The most common AEs causing dose interruption were infections and infestations (7.7% in 
the  “Any  75  mg  group”  and  9.8%  in  the  “Any  150  mg  group”).  The  most  common  infections  and 
infestations  in  the  “Any  secukinumab  group”  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (1.6%),  bronchitis 
(0.9%),  and  influenza,  nasopharyngitis,  and  urinary  tract  infection  (each  0.7%).  The  crude  incidence  of 
AEs causing dose interruption was 17.8% for the 75 mg sc group, 18.1% for the 150 mg sc group, 10.5% 
for the iv-75 mg group, 10.4% for the iv-150 mg group, 10.3% for the 75 mg no-load group, and 16.7% 
for the 150 mg no-load group. 
Crohn´s disease 
Over  the  entire  treatment  period,  5  cases  of  Crohn’s  disease  were  reported  in  the  “Any  secukinumab 
group”  (Table  33),  4  of  which  occurred  in  patients  with  a  prior  history  or  suspected  history  of  Crohn’s 
disease. The remaining case had a prior history of intestine polyps/adenoma, was treated with infliximab 
for  over  2  years  which  was  stopped  6  months  prior  to  the  event.  No  cases  of  Crohn’s  disease  were 
reported in the placebo group. Of note, when comparing secukinumab-treated AS patients with placebo-
treated AS patients, the number of patients being treated and patient-years of exposure are 2.9-fold and 
10.9-fold  higher,  respectively,  in  the  secukinumab-treated  group,  which  may  have  led  to  the  observed 
differences in the number of reported AEs of IBD or Crohn’s disease. 
Table 33. Exposure-adjusted incidence of inflammatory bowel disease – Entire treatment 
period (Pool A: Phase 3 AS trials – Safety set) 
In total, the search yielded 4 events of IBD in 3 patients during the first 16-week period, with 1 SAE of 
Crohn’s disease (PT) in the 75 mg group and 1 SAE of colitis ulcerative in the 75 mg group. The patient in

the  75  mg  sc  group  who  experienced  the  SAE  of  Crohn’s  disease  on  Day  45  had  experienced  rectal 
bleeding  prior  to  randomization.  The  investigator  therefore  considered  the  patient  to  have  had  an 
exacerbation  of  a  pre-existing  condition  of  Crohn’s  disease.  In  addition,  the  patient  was  treated  with 
adalimumab for 8 months which was stopped 4 months prior to the event. A second patient with a 6-year 
history of Crohn’s disease and a colectomy in the iv-75 mg group reported a flare on Days 42 and 89. 
The SAE of ulcerative colitis that occurred in the first 16 weeks was reported in a patient in the 75 mg sc 
group, did not lead to study treatment discontinuation, and was not suspected by the investigator to be 
related to study medication. 
For the cases of Crohn’s disease after 16 weeks in study, 2 occurred in patients in the iv-75 mg group. 
One  was  an  exacerbation  in  a  patient  with  a  7-year  history  of  Crohn’s  disease,  which  was  ongoing  at 
baseline.  This  exacerbation  was  reported  on  Day  162,  was  moderate  in  severity,  not  a  SAE,  was 
suspected  to  be  related  to  study  medication,  and  led  to  the  discontinuation  of  study  treatment.  The 
outcome of the event was unknown at the time of reporting. The other case occurred in a patient with a 
history  of  large  intestinal  polyps  and  colon  adenoma  who  developed  Crohn’s  disease  on  Day  141.  The 
patient was treated with infliximab for over 2 years which was stopped 8 months prior to the event. This 
event was moderate in severity, not a SAE, considered unrelated to study treatment, and did not lead to 
discontinuation. 
The third case of Crohn’s  disease (exacerbation of Crohn’s disease) occurred on Day 428 in a patient in 
the 150 mg no-load group who had no reported pre-existing gastrointestinal disorders prior to the study. 
The  event  occurred  after  the  patient  had  stopped  study  treatment,  was  a  serious  adverse  event  (SAE), 
and was not considered to be related to study treatment. Prior to the SAE, on Day 263, the patient was 
diagnosed  with  Crohn's  disease  (non-serious)  and  was  treated  with  prednisone,  pinaverium  and 
proctosedyl. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone sodium succinate and the event resolved. 
For  the  2  additional  cases  of  colitis  ulcerative  that  occurred  in  the  entire  treatment  period,  one  was  an 
SAE that was an exacerbation of pre-existing disease in a patient in the 150 mg sc group reported as a 
complete recovery. This patient had a 1-year history of ulcerative colitis, was taking concomitant NSAIDs, 
and was treated with mesalazine at baseline. The other case occurred in a patient in the 150 mg sc group 
with  no  history  of  IBD.  This  patient  had  a  3-year  history  of  chronic  diarrhoea.  Prior  medications  include 
adalimumab (for 2 years) and NSAIDs (long term), and the patient was a current smoker. The event of 
colitis  ulcerative  was  not  a  SAE,  did  not  lead  to  study  treatment  discontinuation,  and  resolved  with 
mesalazine treatment. 
Infections and infestations 
The  profile  of  infections  and  infestations  among  AS  patients  was  consistent  with  that  observed  in  the 
extensive  psoriasis  safety  database.  The  rate  of  non-serious  infections,  mainly  of  the  upper  respiratory 
tract,  was  higher  than  placebo  in  the  short-term  period  (16  weeks)  and  similar  across  secukinumab 
doses. During the entire treatment period, exposure adjusted incidence rates (EAIRs) for infections across 
all secukinumab dose groups were comparable to placebo with no evidence of a dose effect (Table 34). 
A total of 6 cases of Candida infections were reported for secukinumab patients, with 2 cases occurring in 
the  first  16  weeks  and  the  remaining  4  thereafter.  No  cases  were  reported  for  placebo  patients  in  the 
entire  treatment  period.  The  absolute  incidence  of  Candida  infections  was  comparable  between  the 
secukinumab dose groups (1.4% and 0.7%, respectively, for the Any 75 mg group and the Any 150 mg 
group). The most common event was oral candidiasis with 3 (0.5%) total cases. All Candida cases were 
mild  in  severity,  non-serious,  resolved  with  standard  treatment  when  provided,  and  did  not  necessitate 
treatment discontinuation. 
Herpes  viral  infections  (HLT)  occurred  in  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the  Any  secukinumab  group 
compared with placebo (2.0% vs 0%). Oral herpes comprised the majority of events (1.3%). No herpes 
Assessment report

viral  infection  was  a  SAE  or  led  to  permanent  discontinuation.  No  cases  of  herpes  viral  infections  were 
seen in the 75 mg group. 
A  search  for  opportunistic  infections  by  NMQ  was  performed  and  yielded  1  case  of  herpes  zoster 
cutaneous  disseminated  in  patient.  This  event  occurred  in  a  patient  in  the  iv-75  mg  group,  was 
considered moderate in severity and limited only to the skin, was non-serious, and did not lead to study 
treatment interruption or discontinuation. 
There were no serious opportunistic infections, and no cases of reactivation of tuberculosis. There was 1 
event of hepatitis viral (PT) (verbatim term: probably viral hepatitis) reported in a patient in the iv-75 mg 
group  that  was  moderate  in  severity,  non-serious,  and  did  not  lead  to  study  treatment  interruption  or 
discontinuation. This patient did not have a history of hepatitis; this event was therefore not considered 
to be hepatitis reactivation. 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  infections  of  skin  structures  (NMQ)  was  comparable  between  the 
secukinumab dose groups (9.2% and 10.8%, respectively, for “Any 75 mg” and “Any 150 mg”). Overall, 
the rate of skin structure infections was higher in the “Any secukinumab group” (10.0%) compared with 
the  placebo  group  (1.5%).  The  most  common  infections  of  skin  structures  in  the  “Any  secukinumab 
group” were folliculitis and tinea pedis (each occurring in 4 patients, 0.7%) with similar rates between the 
dose groups. 
Table 34. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates for infections and opportunistic infections – Entire 
treatment period (Pool A: Phase 3 AS trials – Safety set) 
Malignancies and skin tumours 
Over the entire treatment period in the AS Phase 3 studies, the incidence of malignancies was low, with 
an  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rate  per  100  patient-years  of  0.6  in  the  “Any  secukinumab  group”  and 
comparable  across  the  secukinumab  dose  groups  and  placebo  (Table  35).  There  was  no  imbalance  in 
malignancy  AEs  between  secukinumab  and  placebo  in  Pool  C  of  all  secukinumab  studies  across  multiple 
indications. 
One case of malignant melanoma (PT) was reported in a patient in the 150 mg secukinumab group. This 
event was a SAE and led to study treatment discontinuation. One case of lymphoma (PT) was reported in 
a  patient  in  the  placebo  group.  This  event  was  a  SAE  and  led  to  study  treatment  discontinuation.  In 
addition to the malignancies that occurred during the first 16 weeks, there was a case of B-cell lymphoma 
in the iv-75 mg group, a case of breast cancer in the iv-150 mg group and a case of bladder transitional 
cell  carcinoma  in  the  iv-150  mg  group.  Each  of  these  events  was  a  SAE  that  led  to  study  treatment 
discontinuation.  During  the  follow-up  period,  a  case  of  malignant  melanoma  was  reported  in  a  placebo 
patient.

Table 35. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates for malignancies and skin tumors – Entire 
treatment period (Pool A: Phase 3 AS trials – Safety set) 
New malignancies from the psoriasis studies are from the ongoing studies A2308 and A2309, reported in 
the Week 52 study reports provided in the present submission, and include the following: 
• 
Two uncomplicated cases of basal cell carcinoma (in the upper lip taken care by an excision, not 
related  to  study  medication  according  to  investigator)  and  (with  a  history  of  actinic  keratosis,  3 
incidents in different body parts earlier and one more during 300 mg sc secukinumab treatment 
on day 280). 
•  One case of adenosquamous cell carcinoma (in the lung in a patient with COPD and after 23 pack 
years of smoking during 150 mg sc secukinumab treatment on day 81. 
•  One case of B-cell lymphoma in a patient which was originally randomized to receive placebo and 
was  then  re-randomized  to  receive  Placebo-300  mg  secukinumab.  Patient  medical  history 
included  left  shoulder  lipoma,  periodontal  disease  and  genital  herpes.  Past  medications  taken 
prior to study entry included calcipotriene, cyclosporine, ustekinumab (Jul 2006 to Sep 2006) and 
tofacitinib  (Feb  2012  to  May  2012).  All  past  medications  were  taken  for  psoriasis.  The  patient 
started  receiving  study  medication  on  12-Jul-2012.  On  23-Dec-2013,  the  patient  presented  with 
abnormal  laboratory  tests  and  differential  pathology  showed  atypical  haematopoietic  forms.  The 
last  dose  of  study  medication  was  taken  on  23-Dec-2013  and  study  treatment  was  officially 
discontinued on 11-Jan-2014. Bone marrow biopsy on 13-Feb-2014 revealed the final diagnosis of 
low  grade  B-cell  lymphoproliferative  disorder  in  line  with  marginal  zone  lymphoma.  The 
investigator reported the event as suspected to be related to study treatment and also suspected 
to be related to past treatment of tofacitinib and ustekinumab. 
There was no imbalance in malignancy AEs between secukinumab and placebo over the entire treatment 
period in Pool C of all secukinumab studies across multiple indications. The exposure-adjusted incidence 
per  100  patient-years  of  malignant  or  unspecified  tumours  (SMQ)  based  on  all  AEs  was  comparable 
between  the  “Any  secukinumab  dose”  group  and  placebo  over  the  entire  treatment  period  of  all 
secukinumab  trials  (IR=0.95  for  “Any  secukinumab  dose”  vs.  1.55  for  placebo).  For  malignant  or 
unspecific skin tumours (broad NMQ), the incidence per 100 patient-years was also comparable between 
the  “Any  secukinumab  dose”  group  and  placebo  (0.59  vs.  0.97).  For  malignant  or  unspecific  tumours 
reported as SAEs, the exposure-adjusted rate was nearly identical between the “Any secukinumab dose” 
group vs. placebo (IR=0.54 vs. 0.58)

Skin  malignancies  as  well  as  other  malignancies  were  rare,  and  were  not  considered  related  to  study 
medications in Pool A.  
Major adverse cardiovascular events 
Eligibility  criteria  permitted  patients  with  stable  cardiovascular  risk  factors or  a  history  of  cardiovascular 
disease  to  enrol  in  the  Phase  3  studies  in  AS.  All  confirmed  MACE  cases  (n=3)  had  prior  cardiovascular 
disease  or  pre-existing  risk  factors  at  baseline.  No  cases  of  MACE  were  reported  in  the  placebo  group. 
There was no evidence of a dose-dependency with 2 of 3 cases reported at a dose of 75 mg. Despite all 3 
confirmed  MACE  cases  occurring  on  secukinumab,  a  comparison  of  crude  incidence  rates  between 
secukinumab  and  placebo  is  complicated  by  significant  differences  in  the  average  length  of  follow-up 
which  for  patients  in  the  secukinumab  treatment  groups  was  10  times  that  of  patients  in  the  placebo 
group (Table 36). 
There was no evidence of an increased risk of MACE relative to the expected rate in AS patients. Further, 
there  was  no  direct  evidence  of  a  causal  relationship  between  the  incidence  of  MACE  and  the  loading 
period.  The  overall  EAIR  of  adjudicated  and  confirmed  MACE  over  the  entire  treatment  period  in  the 
Phase 3 AS studies was 0.43 per 100 patient-years (95% CI: 0.09-1.27) (Table 36). The point estimates 
in the two AS studies ranged between 0.41 (95% CI=0.01 to 2.27) for F2310 and 0.45 (95% CI=0.05 to 
1.63) for F2305 with overlapping 95% CIs. 
Table 36. MACE adjudication results in AS patients – Entire treatment period (Pool A: Phase 3 
AS trials – Safety set) 
In the present submission, the rate of MACE on secukinumab across multiple indications was stable with 
increased exposure. Pooling across 42 studies including 8 new studies reported here for the first time, the 
exposure-adjusted  incidence  of  potential  MACE  AEs  over  the  entire  treatment period  of  all  secukinumab 
trials  (Pool  C)  was  0.40  (n=30,  95%  CI:  0.26  -  0.59)  for  the  Any  secukinumab  dose  group  and  0.39 
(n=2, 95% CI: 0.05 - 1.40) for placebo, Figure 21.

Hepatotoxicity 
Consistent with the conclusions from the psoriasis program, the safety data in the AS population did not 
suggest an increased risk for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) from secukinumab treatment. Despite small 
imbalances in the incidence of mild transaminase elevations versus placebo, the overall incidence was low 
and  comparable  across  the  secukinumab  treatment  groups  showing  no  dose-response  relationships. 
Discontinuations due to hepatotoxicity were rare in secukinumab treated patients and 4 of 5 cases (liver 
function analysis HLT) were confounded by either a previously reported medical condition or concomitant 
treatment with isoniazid or methotrexate. 
A case of severe hepatic enzyme increased in a patient in the 150 mg sc group, which was reported as a 
SAE  also  led  to  treatment  discontinuation.  The  patient  had  normal  baseline  hepatic  enzyme  levels.  On 
Day  57,  ALT  was  >5×ULN,  and  AST  was  >6×ULN;  both  remained  elevated  at  these  levels  for  >2  wks. 
The patient’s GGT and ALP levels were also elevated starting on the same day. An SAE of hepatic enzyme 
increased was reported. The event was suspected to be related to the study medication.

One patient in the iv-75 mg group had a history of hyperbilirubinemia and normal liver function tests at 
baseline.  From  Day  366,  the  ALT  began  to  rise  and  the  patient  was  diagnosed  with  increased  alanine 
aminotransferase. The patient developed elevated ALT >8-10×ULN (424 U/L), AST >3-5×ULN (194 U/L) 
and  TBL  >2-3×ULN  (44  μmol/L)  at  Day  440  (Week  60).  Prior  to  this  event,  ALT  elevations  were  also 
reported  at  Day  373  (180  U/L)  and  Day  394  (161  U/L).  A  non-serious  AE  of  alanine  aminotransferase 
increased was reported earlier at Day 366 which did not lead to discontinuation. 
One  patient  in  the  iv-75  mg  group  with  baseline  normal  AST  (19  U/L)  developed  AST  >8-10×ULN  (338 
U/L) at Day 169 (Week 24) with elevations in ALT to >3-5×ULN (146 U/L) and ALP to >2-3 ×ULN (282 
U/L).  A  non-serious  AE  of  viral  hepatitis  with  an  onset  at  Day  165  was  reported  at  the  time  of  these 
elevations. 
One patient in the iv-150 mg group, with active medical conditions of hypertension and hepatic steatosis 
reported  increased  ALT  levels  (non-serious  event)  on  Day  15  and  was  treated  with  ademetionine.  The 
event  (ALT  increased)  was  considered  resolved  on  Day  31.  On  Day  123,  the  patient’s  hepatic  enzymes 
were  reported  to  be  increased  (moderate  severity)  (laboratory  values  not  reported).  Treatment  for 
increased  hepatic  enzymes  included  ademetionine  and  ursodeoxycholic  acid.  Treatment  with  the  study 
medication was permanently discontinued due to increased hepatic enzymes. The event (hepatic enzyme 
increased) was ongoing at the time of last reporting. The event was not suspected to be related the study 
medication. 
One  patient  in  the iv-75 mg  group entered  the  study  with  normal  hepatic  enzymes  at  screening.  At  the 
time  of  study  entry,  the  patient  was  receiving  etoricoxib  for  AS  and  isoniazid  (Day  -24  to  Day  9)  for 
positive PPD test. Laboratory tests showed increased transaminase levels on Day 8. At baseline (Day 1), 
the patient’s ALT and AST levels were elevated (79 U/L [RR: 0 to 45 U/L] and 58 U/L [RR: 0 to 41 U/L], 
respectively).  No  treatment  was  reported  for  this  event.  Treatment  with  the  study  medication  was 
permanently  discontinued  due  to  this  event.  The  event  was  suspected  to  be  related  to  the  study 
medication. 
One patient in the iv-150 mg group, with baseline elevated ALT of 77 U/L (RR: 0 to 45 U/L) and AST of 
58  U/L  (RR:  0  to  41  U/L),  reported  increased  transaminases  (moderate  severity)  on  Day  114.  ALT  was 
157 U/L and AST was 71 U/L. Treatment with the study medication was permanently discontinued due to 
increased transaminases. The event was suspected to be related to the study medication. 
One patient on placebo discontinued due to an AE of “toxic hepatitis”. 
QTC-prolongation 
A search for cases of QT prolongation yielded 1 AE of QTcB prolonged (>480 msec) in the AS population 
in  the  Any  150  mg  group.  The  event  was  non-serious,  mild  in  severity  and  considered  unrelated  to  the 
study  medication.  This  patient  did  not  discontinue  study  medication  due  to  this  event.  There  were  no 
patients  in  the  secukinumab  treatment  groups  with  QTcB  and  QTcF  changes  from  baseline  >60  msec. 
Two patients on placebo were noted with QTcB changes from baseline >60 msec, while only 1 patient on 
placebo had this change based on the Fridericia correction (QTcF). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
A total of 3 deaths,1 in the placebo group (suicide) on Day 80, 1 in the iv-75 mg group due to respiratory 
failure  on  Day  706,  and  1  in  the  75  mg  sc  group  due  to  an  acute  myocardial  infarction  on  Day  29 
occurred in the 2 AS studies. None of these deaths were considered to be related to study treatment. The 
case  of  fatal  respiratory  failure  was  attributed  to  a  relevant  medical  history  of  pulmonary  fibrosis  and

cardiac  failure.  This  patient  had  multiple  cardiopulmonary  risk  factors  at  baseline.  The  case  of  fatal 
myocardial infarction also occurred in a patient with multiple baseline cardiovascular risk factors. 
Four deaths were reported across data pools A, B1 and B in studies F2306, A2302 and A2308 (psoriatic 
arthritis,  psoriasis):  one  death  was  reported  for  the  PsA  trials  due  to  an  intracranial  haemorrhage  in  a 
patient  receiving  iv-75  mg.  One  further  death  occurred  in  Pool  B1  of  unknown  cause  (300  mg 
secukinumab).  Two  additional  deaths  occurred  in  psoriasis  patients  contributing  to  Pool  B  as  a  result  of 
cardiopulmonary arrest (150 mg secukinumab), and of alcohol poisoning (placebo-secukinumab 300 mg), 
respectively. None of these deaths was considered to be related to study treatment. 
For Pool A studies CAIN457F2306 and CAIN457F2312, one further death was reported between the data 
cut-off  for  Pool  A  (9-Oct-2013  for  study  F2306  and  12-May-2014  for  study  F2312)  and  the  data  cut-off 
used for the submission (10-Oct-2014). 
Serious adverse events 
The overall rate of SAEs in the first 16 weeks was low (< 5.6% of patients in any treatment group) and 
comparable  for  the  “Any  secukinumab”  group”  and  the  placebo  group.  While  the  incidence  of  serious 
gastrointestinal  disorders  was  higher  in  the  “Any  secukinumab”  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group, 
this  was  based  on  a  small  number  of  patients  affected  (n  =  4,  1.0%  vs  n  =  0).  No  dose-dependent 
increase  in  SAEs  was  observed  across  the  studies  in  comparing  between  the  75  mg  sc  and  150  mg  sc 
(5.5% and 5.6%, respectively) groups and further supported by the numerically lower SAE rate observed 
in the iv dose groups (iv-75 mg: 1.6% and iv-150 mg: 2.4%). 
Over  the  entire  treatment  period,  the  incidence  of  SAEs  within  any  SOC  was  low  and  no  individual  SAE 
occurred in > 2 patients (0.4%) in the “Any secukinumab group”. The most frequently affected SOCs in 
the  “Any  secukinumab  group”  were  gastrointestinal  disorders  and  injury,  poisoning,  and  procedural 
complications. The incidence of serious infections in the “Any secukinumab group” (0.9%) was low and no 
dose  response  was  observed.  Comparable  frequencies  of  SAEs  were  reported in  the “Any  75  mg  group” 
(9.5%)  and  the  “Any  150  mg  group”  (8.7%).  No  dose  effect  was  apparent  in  any  individual  SOC  or 
preferred term. 
Four Phase 3 studies in AS (F2305, F2305E1, F2310, F2314) were ongoing at time of review. For Pool A, 
treatment blinded SAEs reported between the data cut-off dates for Pool A studies (F2305: 10-Dec-2013 
and F2310: 04-Aug-2014, respectively) and 10-Oct-2014 included: 
•  15 SAEs for 14 patients in Study F2305. Notable events included 2 cases of myocardial infarction: 
(myocardial  infarction  in  a  patient  with  medical  history  of  angioplasty,  stent  placement  and 
current  tobacco  use  and  concomitant  etoricoxib  use  and  myocardial  infarction  in  a  patient  with 
current  conditions  of  obesity,  metabolic  syndrome, Type  2  diabetes  mellitus  and  medical  history 
of coronary angioplasty and stent placement), and  1 case of bilateral pulmonary fibrosis leading 
to death. 
•  3  SAEs  in  3  patients  in  Study  F2310.  These  included  a  case  each  of  pneumonia,  nephrotic 
syndrome  and  acute  coronary  syndrome  (unstable  angina,  ischemic  cardiopathy,Non  ST 
elevation) in a patient with current conditions of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus and  
history of myocardial infarction. 
Other significant events 
The  AEs  leading  to discontinuation  that  occurred  more  than  once  in  the  “Any  secukinumab  group”  were 
Crohn’s  disease,  dyspnoea,  hemoglobin  decreased,  hepatic  enzyme  increased,  pregnancy,  and 
Assessment report

transaminases increased (Table 37). Of two patients who discontinued due to hepatic enzyme increased, 
one  patient  was  in  the  150  mg  secukinumab  group  and  one  patient  was  in  the  iv-150  mg  group. 
Additional  information  regarding  the  two  patients  who  discontinued  due  to  transaminases  increased  is 
described  above.  The  crude  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  study  treatment  discontinuation  at  any  time 
during  the  entire  treatment  period  was  5.5%  for  the  75  mg  sc  group,  8.3%  for  the  150  mg  sc  group, 
4.8%  for  the  iv-75  mg  group,  9.6%  for  the  iv-150  mg  group,  1.1%  for  the  75  mg  no-load  group,  and 
2.2% for the 150 mg no-load group.

Phase 3 AS trials - Safety set) 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Although a higher incidence of neutropenia was observed in secukinumab-treated AS patients vs placebo-
treated  AS  patients,  no  secukinumab  dose-relationship  was  observed  (Table 38).  A  small  proportion  of 
patients across the secukinumab treatment groups reported neutrophil abnormalities. No CTCAE Grade 3 
(n=4) or Grade 4 (n=1) neutropenia events were associated with a serious infection. Neutropenia related 
AEs were non-serious in nature and the majority of these (21 out of 27) were reported in the iv loading 
groups. 
Among the 4 patients overall with CTCAE Grade 3 neutropenia, 1 patient experienced a non-serious mild 
upper  respiratory  tract  infection  at  the  time  of  the  neutrophil  abnormality.  Rates  of  AEs  in  the 
Assessment report

neutropenia narrow NMQ (absolute and exposure-adjusted) showed an increased rate with secukinumab 
relative to placebo but none of the events were reported as SAEs or led to discontinuation. 
In  the  submission  for  psoriasis,  the  incidence  of  neutropenia  for  secukinumab  was  higher  than  placebo. 
No  dose  effect  for  secukinumab  was  observed  in  laboratory  results  or  in  AEs.  As  of  10-Oct-2014  (data 
cut-off for the submission), no Grade 4 neutropenia event was reported. 
Table 38. Neutropenia events – Entire treatment period (Pool A: Phase 3 AS trials – Safety set) 
Clinical chemistry 
Shifts  in  CTCAE  grades  for  clinical  chemistry  parameters  during  the  first  16  weeks:  The  majority  of 
patients  had  values  within  the  normal  range  at  baseline  and  continued  to  show  normal  values  post-
baseline during the initial treatment period. A proportion of patients in all treatment groups shifted from 
normal  range  to  Grades  1-2  for  most  clinical  chemistry  parameters,  but  there  were  no  clinically 
meaningful differences across the treatment groups. 
Shifts  from  normal  values  or  Grade  1  to  Grade  3  were  noted  for  ALT,  AST,  fasting  glucose,  increased 
fasting  glucose,  and  triglycerides  in  a  small  number  of  patients,  with the  ALT  and  fasting  glucose  shifts 
reported  in  the  “Any  secukinumab  dose  group”  only.  A  shift  from  normal  range  to  Grade  4  in  ALT  was 
observed in 1 patient on placebo. 
Similar  to  the  initial  16-week  treatment  period,  the  majority  of  patients  had  values  within  the  normal 
range at baseline and post-baseline for the entire treatment period. Two patients experienced a shift from 
normal  values  at  baseline  to  abnormal  values  of  Grade  4  over  the  entire  treatment  period:  1  patient  in 
the “Any AIN457 75 mg group” for neutrophils and 1 patient in the placebo group for ALT values. For the 
Grade 4 values in cholesterol and triglycerides, all affected secukinumab patients had abnormal values at 
baseline. 
Safety in special populations 
10-year CHD risk category 
The incidence rates of AEs by SOC in each CHD risk category were similar to that of the overall population 
of Pool A over the entire treatment period. The EAIR for cardiac disorders increased with increasing CHD 
risk in the Any secukinumab group (3.8 in the low risk group, 6.8 in the medium risk group) and in the 
placebo group (7.9 in the low risk group, 9.8 in the medium risk group). There were too few patients to 
draw meaningful conclusions in the high CHD risk group (N = 18 in the Any secukinumab group and N = 
3 in the placebo group). 
The  incidence  of  SAEs  in  the  overall  population  was  low,  and  the  trends  in  the  concomitant  CHD  use 
subgroups were similar to those in the overall population of Pool A.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Prior TNF-ai exposure 
AS patients enrolled in the Phase 3 Pool A studies were categorized as either TNFai naïve (no prior TNFαi 
treatment) or TNF-IR (prior TNFαi treatment). Most patients in Pool A were naïve to TNFai (68.8% in the 
Any  secukinumab  group)  and  the  AE  profiles  by  SOC  and  PT  by  prior  TNFai  exposure  were  generally 
similar to that seen in the overall population of Pool A over the first 16 weeks. In the Any secukinumab 
group,  the  absolute  AE  incidence  was  65.0%  in  TNF-IR  patients  and  66.1%  in  TNFai-naïve  patients.  In 
TNF-IR  patients,  the  incidence  of  infections  and  infestations  was  28.5%  and  the  incidence  of 
gastrointestinal  disorders  was  23.6%  in  the  Any  secukinumab  group.  In  TNFai-naïve  patients,  the 
incidence  of  infections  and  infestations  was  31.4%  and  the  incidence  of  gastrointestinal  disorders  was 
14.0%  in  the  Any  secukinumab  group.  A  similar  difference  between  TNF-IR  and  TNFai-naïve  patients  in 
the incidence of gastrointestinal disorders was observed in the placebo group. 
The profiles of EAIRs of AEs by SOC in TNF-IR and TNFai-naïve patients were similar to that of the overall 
population  of  Pool  A  over  the  entire  treatment  period.  The  EAIR  for  any  SOC  was  higher  in  TNF-IR 
patients vs TNFai-naïve patients in the Any 75 mg group, the Any 150 mg group, the Any secukinumab 
group, and the placebo group 
The  incidence  of  SAEs  in  the  overall  population  was  low  and  the  trends  in  the  TNFai  subgroups  were 
similar to those in the overall Pool A population. The EAIR for infections and infestations was not higher in 
patients taking concomitant methotrexate. 
Concomitant methotrexate use 
Few  patients  in  Pool  A  were  taking  concomitant  corticosteroids  (11.4% in  the  Any  secukinumab  group), 
and  the  AE  profiles  by  SOC  and  PT  grouped  by  concomitant  corticosteroid  use  (yes/no)  was  generally 
similar to that seen in the overall population of Pool A over the first 16 weeks. In the Any secukinumab 
group, the absolute AE incidence was 66.7% in patients taking concomitant corticosteroids and 65.6% in 
patients  not  taking  concomitant  corticosteroids.  The  incidence  of  infections  and  infestations  in  the  Any 
secukinumab  group  was  similar  between  patients  taking  concomitant  corticosteroids  (31.1%)  and  those 
not taking concomitant corticosteroids (30.4%). 
The EAIRs of AEs by SOC in each MTX use category were similar to that of the overall population of Pool A 
over the entire treatment period. 
The incidence of SAEs in the overall population was low, and the trends in the MTX use subgroups were 
similar to those in the overall Pool A population. 
Concomitant corticosteroid use 
Few  patients  in  Pool  A  were  taking  concomitant  corticosteroids  (11.4%  in  the  Any  secukinumab  group, 
and  the  AE  profiles  by  SOC  and  PT  grouped  by  concomitant  corticosteroid  use  (yes/no)  was  generally 
similar to that seen in the overall population of Pool A over the first 16 weeks. In the Any secukinumab 
group, the absolute AE incidence was 66.7% in patients taking concomitant corticosteroids and 65.6% in 
patients  not  taking  concomitant  corticosteroids.  The  incidence  of  infections  and  infestations  in  the  Any 
secukinumab  group  was  similar  between  patients  taking  concomitant  corticosteroids  (31.1%)  and  those 
not taking concomitant corticosteroids (30.4%). 
The incidence rates of AEs by SOC in each corticosteroid use category were similar to that of the overall 
population of Pool A over the entire treatment period. 
The  incidence  of  SAEs  in  the  overall  population  was  low,  and  the  trends  in  the  corticosteroid  use 
subgroups were similar to those in the overall Pool A population.

Immunological events 
Over  the  first  16  weeks,  the  crude  IR  of  immune/administration  reactions  was  18.9%  for  the  placebo 
group, 6.8% and 16.7% for 75 mg sc and 150 mg sc, respectively, and 10.5% for iv- 75 mg and 15.2% 
for  iv-150  mg,  respectively.  Mouth  ulceration  (2.5%),  cough  (1.8%),  rash  (1.5%),  pruritus  (1.0%), 
injection  site  pain  (1.0%),  and  worsening  ankylosing  spondylitis  (1.0%)  were  the  most  frequently 
reported  preferred  terms  in  the  “Any  secukinumab  group”.  Mouth  ulceration  was  reported  with  a  higher 
incidence  compared  to  placebo  (2.5%  and  1.5%,  respectively)  but  was  not  considered  to  be  clinically 
significant  as  all  cases  were  mild  in  severity,  did  not  lead  to  discontinuation  and  resolved  without 
treatment.  The  majority  of  AEs  for  immune/administration  reactions  were  of  mild  or  moderate  severity. 
The  severe  immune/administration  reactions  were  Crohn’s  disease  (1  patient  in  the  75  mg  group), 
dyspnoea (1 patient in the 150 mg group), and iritis (1 patient in the placebo group). 
The  exposure  adjusted  incidence  of  the  most  frequent  immunological  AEs  over  the  entire  treatment 
period, are presented in Table 39. 
Table 39. Exposure-adjusted incidence of most frequent AEs (>= 1.0% crude incidence in Any 
secukinumab dose group) of immune/administration reactions – Entire treatment period (Pool 
A: Phase 3 AS trials – Safety set) 
The  incidence  of  hypersensitivity  events  was  higher  in  the  “Any  secukinumab  group”  (7.5%)  compared 
with  placebo  (4.1%),  in  contrast  to  what  was  observed  in  the  16-week  period,  where  secukinumab  and 
placebo  rates  were  comparable.  The  most  common  hypersensitivity  events  in  the  “Any  secukinumab 
group” were rash (1.8%), eczema (1.4%) and dermatitis (1.2%). 
No  cases  of  angioedema  or  anaphylactic  reaction  were  reported  during  the  entire  treatment  period.  All 
hypersensitivity  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  There  were  no  SAEs  or  events  that  required 
study  treatment  discontinuation/interruption  in  the  hypersensitivity  narrow  SMQ  during  the  entire 
treatment period. 
There was no apparent difference between iv and sc load on hypersensitivity events. In the first 8 weeks, 
the  absolute  incidence  of  hypersensitivity  AEs  was  low  and  generally  comparable  for  the  sc  loading 
regimens (4.1% for 75 mg sc and 2.8% for 150 mg sc) and the iv loading regimens (1.6% for iv-75 mg 
and  3.2%  for  iv-150  mg).  Hypersensitivity  AEs  did  not  occur  more  frequently  in  the  Any  secukinumab 
group  (1.9%)  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (3.1%).  In  the  first  16  weeks,  the  hypersensitivity  AE 
rates showed a similar profile as that observed for the first 8 weeks.

Treatment-emergent ADAs are defined as ADAs that developed post-treatment in patients with negative 
ADA  screens  at  baseline  (i.e.,  seroconversion  to  ADA  positivity  from  a  seronegative  state).  Across  both 
Phase  3  AS  trials,  treatment-emergent  ADAs  were  detected  in  2  patients  (2/584,  0.3%)  from  study 
F2305,  both  of  whom    were  receiving  150  mg  secukinumab  at  the  time  of  ADA  detection  at  Week  52. 
Neutralizing  antibodies  to  secukinumab  were  detected  in  one  of  these  patients.  There  was  no  loss  of 
efficacy, no IG-related AEs and no altered PK profile in both cases of treatment-emergent ADAs. 
Non-treatment emergent ADA were observed in both Phase 3 AS trials. A total of 8/584 (1.4%) patients 
were  ADA  positive  at  baseline.  These  included  7  patients  who  were  ADA  positive  at  baseline  only  and 
reverted to  a  seronegative  state  while  on  secukinumab  treatment,  and  1 patient  who  had  both  baseline 
and  post-baseline  ADA  positive  samples.  Of  the  7  patients  who  were  ADA  positive  at  baseline  only  one 
patient reported an AE (seasonal allergy) which could be possibly IG-related. PK normality for this patient 
could not be established as only one PK result was  available. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 4 
out of these 7 patients. Neutralizing antibodies were also detected in the 1 patient with both baseline and 
post-baseline  ADA  positive  samples:  a  placebo  non-responder  patient  with  ADAs  detected  prior  to 
receiving secukinumab at Week 16. No explanation can be provided for the presence of ADAs at baseline 
or while on placebo treatment. Non-specific binding to pre-existing antibodies may have occurred in some 
samples. Overall, the non-treatment emergent positive ADA responses were mostly transient and of low 
titer.  The  MSD-based  assay  is  highly  sensitive  and  therefore  capable  of  detecting  very  low  levels  of 
antibodies  which  can  bind  to  secukinumab.  Consequently,  non-treatment  related,  naturally  occurring 
ADAs  may  lead  to  a  confirmed  positive  response  in  this  assay  in  either  pre-dose  samples  or  samples 
derived  from  patients  not  exposed  to  secukinumab.  These  observations  were  not  considered  to  be 
clinically relevant, as the ADAs were not associated with secukinumab treatment. 
ADAs  were  not  associated  with  injection  site  reactions  or  serious  or  severe  AEs  mapping  to  the 
hypersensitivity SMQ. Across the 2 AS Phase 3 studies, 1 patient with baseline ADAs also experienced a 
mild non-serious AE of seasonal allergy which did not lead to discontinuation. 
Loss of efficacy was defined as failure to achieve ASAS 20 while on treatment after previously achieving 
ASAS 20 for at least 2 consecutive visits at any time prior to first detection of ADA. Loss of efficacy was 
not  detected  in  either  of  the  2  patients  who  developed  treatment  emergent  ADAs  or  the  1  patient  with 
baseline and post baseline ADA. There were no discontinuations due to ADAs. 
ADAs  were  also  not  associated  with  altered  PK  profiles.  Secukinumab  concentrations  in  all  patients  with 
ADAs and more than one evaluable PK sample fit into the observed range for all patients without ADA at 
Weeks 4, 16, 24 and 52. There was also no correlation between ADA titers and alteration in PK profile in 
phase 3 patients. 
Across  all  patients  (584  patients)  evaluated  for  ADAs  in  the  Phase  3  trials,  6/584  (1%)  patients  tested 
positive for both ADAs and neutralizing antibodies. PK profiles were normal and therapeutic efficacy was 
maintained in these patients with neutralizing antibodies, although one of these patients  had only one PK 
time point during treatment to assess. 
2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The secukinumab development program studied 7048 patients, including 6200 patients exposed to at 
least one dose of secukinumab in any indication, and 6267 patient-years of secukinumab exposure, are 
included in the safety pooling. The safety data in the present submission provide an additional 2679 
patient-years of secukinumab exposure (75% increase), including 955 patient-years of exposure in PsA 
patients, beyond the 3588 patient-years of exposure reported previously for the psoriasis development 
program.

The first data pool (A) consisted of 2 pivotal placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials in AS (CAIN457F2305 and 
CAIN457F2310) with placebo and dose comparisons that allow risks to be evaluated in the AS population 
during  the  first  16  weeks  of  treatment  and  during  the  entire  treatment  period  (median  66  weeks  of 
exposure to secukinumab). 
The largest data pool (C), which includes all patients treated with secukinumab in 42 studies for which an 
interim or final CSR is currently available, maximized the chances of observing rare events of MACE and 
malignancy in patients receiving secukinumab.  
Pooling was conducted in a rational manner in order to 1) investigate the specific safety concerns during 
the induction period in the AS studies (related to either iv or sc loading regimen), 2) enable comparisons 
against  placebo  during  the  initial  16  weeks  of  AS  studies,  3)  find  out  about  long  term  tolerability  in  AS 
indication, and 4) investigate the overall critical safety features of secukinumab pooled from all exposed 
patients (longest follow-up to date of reporting over 212 weeks in 1 subject and over 132 weeks in 108 
subjects). 
The AE profile of induction and placebo controlled study phases in AS patients resembles closely the AE 
profile observed in the initial submission of psoriasis-indication, where up to week 12, the most common 
AE:s  were  nasopharyngitis  (placebo  8.6%  vs.  secukinumab  11.9%),  headache  (5.2%  vs.  6.0%), 
diarrhoea (1.4% vs. 3.3%), pruritus (2.6% vs 3.2%), URTI (0.7% vs. 2.82%), oropharyngeal pain (1.7% 
vs. 2.3%), and arthralgia (2.4% vs. 2.1%). There appeared to be no differences or dose-dependence in 
the AE profiles between patients receiving 75 mg and 150 mg sc loading doses. 
Similarly  to  weeks  0  to  16,  in  the  entire  study  period  the  AE  profile  closely  resembles  that  seen  in  the 
psoriasis-studies, where nasopharyngitis, URTIs, arthralgia, hypertension, diarrhoea, back pain, pruritus, 
cough, psoriasis, and oropharyngeal pain were the top ten preferred terms for AEs. 
There appeared to be no dose-dependence during maintenance treatment for most of the reported AEs. 
However,  some  trends  of  dose-dependence  can  be  observed  in  the  incidences  of  influenza,  pharyngitis, 
hypertension, oral herpes, paraesthesia, and neutropenia – more strongly associated with iv-loading. 
Treatment  emergent  adverse  events  from  study  F2305  with  iv  loading  occurring  more  frequently  in  the 
secukinumab  group  were  nasopharyngitis,  diarrhoea,  URTI,  dyslipidaemia,  pharyngitis,  influenza, 
leukopenia, back pain, nausea, and neutropenia. And from study F2310 with sc loading, nasopharyngitis, 
URTI, hypertension, influenza, bronchitis, oral herpes, pharyngitis and tonsillitis. 
Regarding  current  Pool  A,  it  appeared  that  nasopharyngitis  was  slightly  more  common  in  patients 
receiving the iv-loading. Oral herpes was observed more in patients receiving 150 mg sc-doses (n=2) or 
iv-loading  (n=3).  However,  none  of  the  herpes  cases  were  severe  or  led  to  discontinuation  from  the 
study. Headache, nausea, and diarrhoea were also more common in iv-loaded patients. 10 cases of mild 
leukopenia  were  reported  in  iv-loaded  patients  and  only  1  in  placebo  group.  Also  dyslipidaemias  were 
reported  more  from  secukinumab  patients  and  especially  those  receiving  iv  loading.  These  observations 
gave support to use of the sc-loading method. 
Upper  respiratory  tract  infections,  candida  infections,  and  mainly  oral  herpes  infections  are  adequately 
addressed in the current Cosentyx product information. With regards to opportunistic infections, no cases 
of  tuberculosis  and  only  one  case  of  suspected  viral  hepatitis  were  reported.  One  case  of  herpes  zoster 
activation  was  reported.  Therefore  the  CHMP  considered  that  there  were  no  new  findings  regarding  the 
risk of infections from the AS studies. 
Deaths  in  patients  receiving  secukinumab  were  associated  with  severe  cardiovascular  risks  and  co-
morbidity and seem not related to the study medications in the AS studies. The same conclusion could be

SAEs  of  interest  in  Pool  A  first  16  weeks  consisted  of  one  occurrence  each  of  ischaemic  colitis, 
“microscopic”  colitis,  ulcerative  colitis,  Crohn´s  disease,  increased  hepatic  enzymes,  malignant 
melanoma,  and  myocardial  infarction.  There  was  also  one  lymphoma  reported  in  patient  receiving 
placebo.  However,  as  these  are  all  single  cases  of  SAEs  occurring  to  patients  receiving  either 
secukinumab or placebo, they do not raise concerns about the safety profile of secukinumab. 
It  appeared  that  Crohn´s  disease  at  baseline  was  more  common  in  AS  patients  than  in  PsA  patients 
addressed  in  another  extension  of  indication  (3/752  vs  1/1274,  respectively).  Only  two  new  diagnoses 
were made during or after secukinumab exposure in AS patients and one new diagnosis similarly in PsA 
patients.  Following a request from the CHMP the MAH discussed the possibility of adding Crohn´s disease 
or  exacerbation of  Crohn´s  disease  to  section  4.8 of  the  SmPC.  Three  out of  five  cases of  Crohn  in  AS-
studies  reported  a  medical  history  including  Crohn´s  disease.  One  of  the  cases  lacked  information  on 
medical  history,  and  one  reported  history  of  polyps.  The  MAH  therefore  concluded,  that  an  update  of 
section  4.8  was  currently  not  warranted,  and  this  was  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP.  The  current 
warnings in the SmPC include a warning in section 4.4 that caution should be exercised when prescribing 
secukinumab  to  patients  with  Crohn’s  disease,  as  exacerbations  of  Crohn’s  disease,  in  some  cases 
serious,  were  observed  in  clinical  studies  and  this  was  considered  sufficient  to  minimise  this  risk.  In 
addition Crohn’s disease is included in the RMP as an important potential risk. 
Skin malignancies as well as other malignancies were reported rarely and not regarded related to study 
medications  in  Pool  A.  Three  cases  of  lymphomas  in  psoriasis  and  ankylosing  spondylitis  studies  were 
observed  and  were  evaluated  more  closely.  In  two  of  the  cases,  lymphoma  was  observed  after  many 
months  of  exposure  to  the  IMP.  The  two  cases  had  quite  different  characteristics  suggesting  a  different 
underlying  etiopathogenesis.  Some  common  features  in  these  2  lymphoma  cases  might  have  been 
expected if they were related to the mechanism of action of secukinumab. Finally, in the last case, which 
was reported as marginal cell lymphoma, previous exposure to cyclosporine, ustekinumab and tofacitinib 
may have contributed to the event. Malignancies are included in the RMP as an important potential risk. 
In  the  original  psoriasis  submission,  the  cardiovascular  co-morbidity  was  over-presented  at  baseline  in 
the secukinumab groups. During the induction period in Pool B, there were 10 cardiac disorders reported 
as SAEs in the “Any secukinumab dose” group, compared to none in the placebo- and etanercept-groups. 
Number of patients experiencing a serious cardiovascular adverse event (and the incidence rate per 100 
patient years) for placebo 0 (0.00), secukinumab 150 mg 13 (1.14), secukinumab 300 mg 7 (0.60), and 
etanercept  3  (1.03)  would  suggest  a  slightly  increased  risk  for  users  of  secukinumab.  However,  taking 
into account the larger and - in particular - longer exposure to secukinumab and that most of the SAEs 
occurred  weeks  or  months  after  continuous  secukinumab  use  in  patients  with  predisposing  factors  and 
cardiovascular morbidity, there was no implication that secukinumab would predispose patients to serious 
cardiovascular complications. The same conclusions can be drawn from the analyses of the AS studies. 
There  was  a  significant  decrease  in  total  leukocytes  and  neutrophils  in  the  pooled  secukinumab  group 
during  all  pivotal  studies  in  the  psoriasis  submission.  This  decrease  was  probably  due  to  the 
pharmacodynamic  effects  of  the  drug  (and  it  was  somewhat  more  prominent  in  the  etanercept  group 
compared to secukinumab patients). In general, the neutropenia cases were not associated with SAEs or 
treatment  discontinuation.  There  are  no  new  findings  in  the  AS  studies  in  this  respect.  There  were  no 
observed  effects  attributable  to  use  of  study  medications  in  haemoglobin,  lymphocyte,  and  platelet 
parameters. Neutropenia is included in the RMP as an important identified risk with appropriate warnings 
in the SmPC. 
Mild  elevations  of  ALT  observed  during  induction  period,  with  only  slight  differences  between  different 
induction regimens, appear not to be a relevant safety issue. Increased incidence of ALT elevations during 
iv-loading will not be an issue in the clinical use with sc-loading. Similarly, the mild grade I elevations of 
total  cholesterol  and  triglycerides  appear  more  commonly  in  iv-loaded  patients.  Grade  II  elevations  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/665405/2015 
Page 95/109 
 
  
  
 
cholesterol were scarce (only 1 case during iv-loading). Grade II elevation on triglycerides were observed 
in  3/139  (2.16%)  in  patients  receiving  sc  loading  and  7/231  (3.03%)  in  patients  receiving  iv  loading 
(during  the  first  16  weeks).  However  the  incidence  of  the  events  observed  with  the  iv  loading  will  not 
apply in the clinical setting. 
Two  patients  experienced  significant  hepatic  enzyme  elevations  without  any  baseline  morbidity  or 
concomitant  medication,  cases  that  could  be  attributed  to  use  of  secukinumab.  Three  further  hepatic 
enzyme elevations were observed in patients with previous hyperbilirubinemia or hepatic steatosis, and in 
conjunction with viral hepatitis. Hepatitis B reactivation is included in the RMP as an important potential 
risk. 
There  did  not  appear  to  be  any  other  clinically  meaningful  differences  evident  in  either  haematology  or 
blood chemistry parameters attributable to use of secukinumab in the AS studies. 
There  were  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  the  AE  profile  stratified  by  the  body  weight  (<90  kg, 
>90 kg) or gender. The incidence of SAEs in the overall population was low and the trends in the TNFai 
subgroups were similar to those in the overall Pool A population. The EAIR for infections and infestations 
was not higher in patients taking concomitant methotrexate. 
All immune reactions were non-serious. No cases of angioedema or anaphylaxis were reported. 
Milder  forms  of  hypersensitivity  reactions  were  rare.  Urticaria  was  seen  here  less  frequently  (<1.0%) 
compared  to  original  psoriasis-submission  (1.85%).  Rash  was  slightly  less  common  here  (1.5%) 
compared  to  earlier  submission  (2.45%).  Overall  incidence  of  hypersensitivity  reaction  in  Pool  A  was 
6.5% and 11.17% in the original submission in the secukinumab patients. 
The  presence  of  anti-secukinumab  antibodies  was  scarce,  suggesting  that  the  potential  risk  of 
immunogenicity  is  low.  Based  on  the  clinical  trial  data,  the  immunogenicity  to  secukinumab  did  not 
appear to have a negative impact on the overall safety profile, efficacy, or pharmacokinetic parameters of 
secukinumab. This did not change in the current AS submission either. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of secukinumab in treatment of AS in both the induction and maintenance phases of the 
studies resembles closely the safety profile observed in the psoriasis-indication of the initial submission. 
Treatment emergent adverse event occurring more frequently in the secukinumab group included 
nasopharyngitis, URTI, hypertension, influenza, bronchitis, oral herpes, pharyngitis and tonsillitis. And 
mainly observed in patients receiving iv loading, also mild manifestations dyslipidaemia, leukopenia, and 
neutropenia. Some trends of dose dependence during maintenance treatment could be seen in the 
incidences of influenza, pharyngitis, hypertension, oral herpes, paraesthesia, and neutropenia. There 
were no new findings regarding Crohn´s disease or MACEs. Otherwise there were no new concerns about 
malignancies. Hypersensitivity and immunological reactions remain rare and immunogenic potential of 
secukinumab appeared very low, with no clinical implications. 
2.4.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The PSUR cycle for the medicinal product should follow a half-yearly cycle until otherwise agreed by the 
CHMP. 
The next data lock point will be 25 December 2015. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Short-term and long-term efficacy of secukinumab has been robustly shown in comparison to placebo. In 
the  pivotal  study  F2305  secukinumab  150  mg  administered  subcutaneously  after  an  initial  one-month 
intravenous loading period was superior to placebo with respect to the primary endpoint of ASAS 20 and 
also  with  respect  of  all  secondary  endpoints  (ASAS  40,  hsCRP,  ASAS  5/6,  BASDAI,  SF-36,  ASQoL  and 
ASAS partial remission) at Week 16. Conversely, in Study F2310 the subcutaneous secukinumab dose of 
150  mg,  used  both  during  the  loading  and  maintenance  periods  was  superior  to  placebo  in  ASAS  20 
response  and  also  with  all  other  secondary  endpoints  except  for  ASAS  partial  remission  at  Week  16.  In 
the analysis across the studies, the magnitude of ASAS 20 response was not dependent on the method of 
administration  (iv  or  sc).  Despite  the  numerically  greater  improvements  in  TNFαi  naïve  subjects,  the 
ASAS 20 response was significantly superior to placebo also in TNF-IR patients. The onset of efficacy of 
secukinumab  was  rapid  as  the  difference  in  ASAS  20  response  rate  over  placebo  was  evident  already 
from Week 1 onwards. In both studies, the response rates in primary and secondary endpoints achieved 
at Week 16 were sustained through Week 52.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Infections  were  more  commonly  reported  in  secukinumab-patients  compared  to  placebo.  The  imbalance 
with  secukinumab  vs.  placebo  was  mainly  due  to  upper  respiratory  tract  infections.  Also  candida 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/665405/2015 
Page 99/109 
 
  
  
 
 
infections and oral herpes infections were more commonly reported compared to placebo. Infections are 
included in the RMP as an important identified risk with appropriate warnings also included in the SmPC. 
The  increased  incidence  of  candida  infections  was  mainly  due  to  oral  candidiasis  and  vulvovaginal 
candidiasis  and  consistent  with  the  mechanism  of  action  of  secukinumab  and  knowledge  on  the  IL-17 
biology.  All  candida  infections  were  mild  to  moderate  in  severity  and  none  led  to  treatment 
discontinuation. 
Neutropenia  was  more  common  in  secukinumab-treated  patients  compare  to  placebo.  In  general,  the 
neutropenia  cases  were  not  associated  with  SAEs  or  discontinuations.  Majority  of  the  neutropenia  cases 
were  associated  with  iv-loading  regimen,  which  will  not  be  used  in  the  clinical  practice.  Neutropenia  is 
included in the RMP as an important identified risk with appropriate warnings in the SmPC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Exposure to secukinumab is still limited only to the clinical trial setting. Therefore the safety profile of 
secukinumab whilst considered acceptable at this time point will be further characterised following post-
marketing experience which will be monitored as described in the RMP and will be reported in PSURs.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Statistically significant and clinically highly relevant short-term and long-term efficacy of secukinumab in 
treatment  of  AS  has  been  shown.  There  is  a  need  for  additional  therapies  in  moderate  to  severe  AS, 
particularly for those with inadequate response to TNFαis. 
The  most  relevant  safety  concerns  of  secukinumab  identified  so  far  are  related  to  mild  infections. 
Appropriate measures to minimise this risk are included in the SmPC and further information on this issue 
will be collected as described in the RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Efficacy  of  secukinumab  in  the  treatment  of  AS  has  been  demonstrated.  The  safety  profile  appears 
favourable based on the data currently available. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Robust  and  clinically  relevant  efficacy  has  been  shown  for  secukinumab  in  the  treatment  of  ankylosing 
spondylitis. The overall safety profile of secukinumab appears favourable. Unfavourable effects typical for 
biologic  ankylosing  spondylitis therapies  have  been  observed,  including  infections  and  mild  neutropenia, 
but no increase was observed in the rate of mycobacterial or serious opportunistic infections. 
Based on the data available, secukinumab is approvable for the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis 
in adults who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy.

Extension of indication to add new indication for Cosentyx in the treatment of active ankylosing 
spondylitis in adults who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy; consequently, SmPC 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 have been revised to include new efficacy and safety 
information. The Package Leaflet and RMP have been updated accordingly. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication brings 
significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 1). 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

1.  Introduction 
In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Article  14(11)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004,  the  Marketing 
Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  has  applied  for  an  additional  one  year  marketing  protection  period  in  the 
framework of the variation procedure EMEA/H/C/003729/II/0002 (extension of indication). 
The request was based on the MAH’s position that Cosentyx represents a significant clinical benefit in the 
treatment of ankylosing spondylitis in adults who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy, 
in comparison with existing therapies.   
2.  Justification  of  significant  clinical  benefit  as  presented  by 
the MAH 
2.1.  Demonstration of new therapeutic indication 
Secukinumab  (AIN457)  is  a  recombinant  high-affinity  fully  human  monoclonal  anti-human  Interleukin-
17A  (IL-17A)  antibody  of  the  IgG1/kappa  isotype  that  selectively  binds  with  high  affinity  to  interleukin-
17A  (IL-17A),  a  downstream  product  of  the  Th17  cells,  thus  neutralizes  its  bioactivity.  Secukinumab 
targets  IL-17A,  regardless  of  its  source.  IL-17A  has  been  associated  with  inflammation,  neutrophil 
infiltration, and destruction of cartilage and bone via osteoclastic activity. 
Novartis  submitted  a  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  (MAA)  for  secukinumab  lyophilisate  in  vial 
(LYO), pre-filled syringe (PFS) and autoinjector/pen (AI) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque-
type  psoriasis  in  October  2013.  The  Committee  for  Medicinal  product  for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  positive 
opinion was adopted on 20-Nov-2014 and the European Commission issued a marketing authorisation for 
the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis  on  15-Jan-2015.  In  addition,  secukinumab  was 
recently  approved  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis  in  Australia,  Chile  and  the 
United States (US), as well as for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis vulgaris in Japan. 
Secukinumab is registered under the tradename Cosentyx. 
Secukinumab  is  also  being  developed  by  Novartis  for  the  treatment  of  psoriatic  arthritis  (PsA)  and 
ankylosing  spondylitis  (AS).  In  the  current  dossier  the  proposed  indication  is  “ankylosing  spondylitis  in 
adults who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy”. 
Ankylosing  spondylitis  (AS)  is  an  immune-mediated  chronic  inflammatory  disease  which  belongs  to  a 
group of conditions known as spondyloarthritides (SpA). It is mainly characterized by involvement of the 
axial  skeletons  and  the  sacroiliac  joints,  but  also  affects  peripheral  joints  and  extra-articular  organs.  A 
significant  proportion  of  patients  may  present  with  associated  extra-articular  manifestations  such  as 
uveitis,  psoriasis,  inflammatory  bowel  disease  (IBD),  cardiovascular  and  pulmonary  abnormalities. 
Generalized osteoporosis as well as regional osteopenia are common in AS patients and predispose them 
to non-traumatic fractures in spite of young age and gender (male). The presence of the HLA-B27 antigen 
is  strongly  associated  with  AS:  90–95%  of  patients  with  AS  who  have  European  ancestry  carry  this 
marker.  AS  affects  up  to  1.1%  of  the  population,  is  associated  with  significant  morbidity  and  disability 
and thus constitutes a major socioeconomic burden. 
2.2.  Details of existing therapies 
The  first-line  drug  treatment  of  mild  AS  consists  of  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs). 
Treatment  of  NSAIDs-refractory  AS  is  hampered  by  the  lack  of  efficacy  of  virtually  all  standard  disease

modifying  anti-rheumatic  drugs  (DMARDs)  including  methotrexate  (MTX),  although  peripheral  arthritis 
associated with AS may respond to sulfasalazine. 
TNFα-blocking  agents  were  successfully  added  to  the  armamentarium  to  treat  AS  and  subsequently 
demonstrated  prolonged  efficacy  with  up  to  eight  years  of  follow-up.  However,  upon  discontinuation  of 
TNFα-blockers  the  disease  relapses  quickly,  indicating  that  the  inflammatory  process  is  only  suppressed 
and not completely abolished. Results reported in the ASSERT study, the largest study ever conducted on 
Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging  (MRI)  evaluation  of  spinal  lesions  in  AS,  demonstrated  a  near  complete 
resolution of inflammatory lesions at the 24- week time point with anti-TNFα therapy. However, in other 
reports  AS  inflammatory  bone  lesions  detected  by  MRI  did  not  completely  disappear  under  TNFα 
antagonist  therapy  over  a  six-month  study  period.  These  bone  lesions  persisted  despite  full  clinical 
remission, which suggests that the inflammatory process was still smoldering. 
Treatment options for patients with intolerance or an inadequate response to anti-TNFα agents are limited 
and switching patients to a second or third anti-TNFα agent may not be effective choices. Antagonism of 
IL-17 by secukinumab represents a novel approach to interfere with the chronic inflammatory process by 
selectively targeting the predominant cytokine of the unique subset of helper Th17 cells, as well as other 
cells  that  play  a  predominant  role  in  the  inflammation  associated  with  AS.  Thus,  there  is  a  high  unmet 
medical  need  for  up  to  40%  of  the  AS  population  which  experienced  an  inadequate  response  or  is 
intolerant to anti-TNFα agents. 
2.3.  Significant clinical benefit based on improved efficacy 
The  significant  clinical  benefit  of  secukinumab  in  comparison  to  existing  therapies  is  based  on  its 
mechanism  of  action  which  makes  it  a  targeted  treatment,  on  its  pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics 
properties  and  on  the  efficacy  and  safety  data  in  the  target  indication  and  population,  thus  addressing 
unmet  needs.  The  efficacy  and  safety  data  in  the  target  indication  and  population  come  from  two 
adequate  (n=590  in  total)  and  placebo-controlled  confirmatory  phase  III  trials  (CAIN457F2305  and 
CAIN457F2310). The purpose of these studies was to demonstrate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 
secukinumab versus placebo in patients with active AS with a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity 
Index  (BASDAI)  ≥4  despite  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drug  (NSAID),  corticosteroid  or  disease 
modifying  anti-rheumatic  drug  (DMARD)  therapy.  In  addition,  in  CAIN457F2305  and  CAIN457F2310, 
respectively,  27%  and  38.4%  of  patients  were  previously  treated  with  an  anti-TNF  agent  and 
discontinued the anti-TNF agent for either lack of efficacy or intolerance 
As  a  targeted  therapy,  secukinumab  selectively  binds  with  high  affinity  to  IL-17  which  is  a  downstream 
product  of  the  Th17  cells  involved  in  the  pathogenesis  of  AS.  Secukinumab  150  mg  s.c.  showed 
substantial  efficacy  benefits  in  the  treatment  of  AS.  Treatment  with  secukinumab  resulted  in  significant 
improvements in signs and symptoms, physical function and health related quality of life, spinal mobility 
and inhibition of inflammation compared to placebo at Week 16. These improvements were all sustained 
up to week 52. The magnitude of response on signs and symptoms at week 16 was similar in TNF-naïve 
and  TNF-inadequate  responder  (TNF-IR)  patients  in  both  studies.  Efficacy  was  maintained  in  the  TNF-
naïve and TNF-IR patients up to week 52. Based upon cross-study comparisons to other phase 3 biologics 
development programs in AS, the efficacy response of secukinumab 150 mg administered subcutaneously 
is comparable to anti-TNF agents for ASAS 20 and 40. 
2.4.  Significant clinical benefit based on improved safety 
The  safety  profile  of  secukinumab  in  AS  patients  is  comparable  to  the  safety  profile  of  secukinumab  in 
psoriasis patients.

Regulation (EC) No 726/2004

Page 105/109 
 
  
  
 
2.5.  Significant clinical benefit based on major contribution to patient care 
The following is presented by the MAH under the Section "Unmet medical need": 
There is a well-known unmet medical need in AS patients for additional therapeutic options, especially for 
the AS patients who are intolerant to or who have inadequate response to anti-TNF agents as there is no 
other treatment option currently on the market. These patients represent 40% of the AS population. This 
population  includes  patients  who  experience  primary  treatment  failure  with  no  response  to  treatment 
after  initially  starting  an  anti-TNF  agent,  secondary  treatment  failure  who  experience  recurrence  of 
disease  manifestations  after  an  initial  period  of  improvement,  and  intolerance  or  contraindication  to  the 
use of anti-TNF agents. 
Most  previous  AS  trials  with  TNFα-targeted  biologics  did  not  include  patients  who  had  failed  previously 
therapy with an anti-TNFα biologic. Notably, the current secukinumab studies include 25-40% of patients 
with the highest unmet medical need who have failed anti- TNFα therapy. Secukinumab has proven to be 
efficacious  in  all  components  of  AS  disease  in  both  anti-TNF  naïve  and  TNF-inadequate  responder 
patients. With its novel mechanism of action targeting interleukin-17A (IL-17A), secukinumab will be the 
first  non-anti-TNF  biologic  treatment  registered  for  the  treatment  of  AS,  thus  bringing  new  treatment 
opportunities for AS patients. The anti-IL-17 Mechanism of Action (MOA) of secukinumab is the only other 
class  of  biologics  now  proven  to  be  effective  in  ankylosing  spondylitis.  In  contrast  to  other  types  of 
arthritis, non-TNFα biologics such as rituximab, tocilizumab, and abatacept are not effective in ankylosing 
spondylitis. 
In conclusion, secukinumab has a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies for AS 
patients, as it was shown to be efficacious in all components of the disease with a rapid onset of action, 
thus  reducing  all  burdens  caused  by  the  disease,  without  showing  any  tolerability  or  unexpected  safety 
issues.  In  addition,  secukinumab  will  address  unmet  needs  as  it  will  be  the  first  biologic  non-anti-TNF 
treatment that will be registered for the treatment of AS. 
3.  Assessment of the MAH’s justification of significant clinical 
benefit1 
3.1.  Demonstration of new therapeutic indication 
Article  14(11)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  refers  to  significant  clinical  benefit  in  comparison  with 
existing therapies. The European Commission´s guidance (Guidance on elements required to support the 
registration  of  a  new  therapeutic  indication  in  order  to  benefit  from  an  extended  (11-year)  marketing 
protection  period,  European  Commission,  Brussels,  November  2007)  outlines  the  level  of  evidence 
required to support the application. 
Cosentyx has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in January 2015. It 
is agreed that AS represents a new therapeutic indication.

3.2.  Details of existing therapies 
According  to  the  clinical  guidelines,  physical  therapy  and  NSAIDs  (intermittent  or  continuous  use) 
comprise the first-line treatment in AS. In contrast, the clinical data do not support the use of traditional 
non-biological  disease-modifying  antirheumatic  drug  in  the  treatment  of  AS,  with  the  exception  of 
consideration  of  sulphasalazine  in  AS  with  peripheral  arthritis.  The  treatment  with  TNFα-blockers  is 
recommended for the patients with persistently high disease activity despite conventional treatment with 
NSAID and physiotherapy. 
To date, there are five TNFα-inhibitors which have been approved for treatment of AS in Europe. Two of 
these (infliximab and golimumab) are indicated for the treatment of severe active ankylosing spondylitis 
in adults who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy. In contrast, etanercept, adalimumab 
and certolizumab-pegol are indicated also for non-radiological axial SpA. 
According  to  the  just  recently  published  Cochrane  analysis,  there  are  no  evident  differences  in  efficacy 
between  the  registered  TNFα-blockers.  In  the  registration  studies  for  AS,  the  Assessment  of 
SpondyloArthritis  International  Society  (ASAS)  20  response  (the  primary  efficacy  variable  used  in  the 
Cosentyx  AS  studies)  varied  between  51.6%  (adalimumab)  and  63.6%  (certolizumab-pegol).  Therefore, 
it  can  be  estimated  that  40-50%  of  the  AS  patients  experience  an  inadequate  response  for  TNFα-
blockers. 
According  to  the  experience  derived  from  a  few  small  observational  studies,  around  50%  of  the  AS 
patients intolerant or unresponsive to the first TNFα-blocker respond to the second TNFα-blocker. These 
preliminary findings have however not been verified in randomized clinical trials. 
The  conclusions  of  the  MAH  are  endorsed,  i.e.,  that  an  unmet  need  still  exists  and  secukinumab 
represents a novel therapeutic option based on antagonism of IL-17. 
3.3.  Significant clinical benefit based on improved efficacy 
Justification  for  significant  clinical  benefit  in  comparison  with  existing  therapies  should  generally  be 
supported  by  results  of  comparative  clinical  studies.  As  stated  in  the  European  Commission´s  guidance, 
the  choice  of  the  comparator  (existing  therapy)  in  clinical  trials  should  be  justified  by  relevant  scientific 
literature,  CHMP  guidelines,  or  scientific  advice.  Placebo  controlled  studies  or  even  uncontrolled  studies 
may be sufficient only in the unusual event of exceptional benefit which could not be due to chance or a 
confounding factor. 
A  clinically  relevant  level  of  efficacy  has  been  demonstrated  for  secukinumab  in  comparison  to  placebo. 
However,  no  active  control  (i.e.,  TNFα-blocker)  was  included  in  the  AS  studies,  although  this  is 
recommended  in  the  EMA  AS  guideline.  The  efficacy  of  secukinumab  dose  of  150  mg  in  achieving  the 
ASAS  20  response  in  Study  F2310  (61.1%)  was  at  least  comparable  to  the  efficacy  of  previously 
approved TNFα-blockers for treatment of AS. The ASAS 20 response rate was numerically greater in TNFα 
naïve  population  (68.2%) compared  to  TNF-IR  population  (50.0%),  but  the difference  over  placebo  was 
significant in both sub-populations. 
Finally, it is not possible to make any robust comparisons of efficacy with other existing therapies without 
a  direct  comparative  trial.  The  MAH  has  also  not  provided  any  detailed  comprehensive  discussion  and 
comparison  of  efficacy  parameters  between  secukinumab  and  existing  therapies  hence  the  one  year 
additional marketing protection period cannot be granted based on improved efficacy 
The MAH has been asked to justify the lack of a dedicated actively controlled study in AS.

Regulation (EC) No 726/2004

Page 107/109 
 
  
  
 
3.4.  Significant clinical benefit based on improved safety 
According to the MAH, the safety profile of secukinumab in AS patients is comparable to the safety profile 
of  secukinumab  in  psoriasis.  This  is  generally  agreed  on,  although  there  are  some  safety-related  issues 
that  need  clarification  during  the  current  procedure.  Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  secukinumab  was 
considered favourable in the psoriasis population, also in relation to other products available. However, it 
is  not  possible  to  make  any  robust  comparisons  of  safety  with  other  existing  therapies  without  a  direct 
comparative trial. The MAH has also not provided any detailed comprehensive discussion and comparison 
of  safety  parameters  between  secukinumab  and  existing  therapies  and  hence  the  one  year  additional 
marketing protection period cannot be granted based on improved safety. 
3.5.  Significant clinical benefit based on major contribution to patient care 
The discussion of the issues related to "significant clinical benefit based on major contribution to patient 
care" has been in principle provided by the MAH under the section "Unmet medical need". 
The  mode  of  administration  and  the  dosing  frequency  of  secukinumab  are  similar  to  other  products 
available  (sc  injection  q4w  during  the  maintenance  treatment)  and  therefore  do  not  provide  any 
additional benefit. 
According  to  the  European  Commission´s  guidance,  medicinal  product  having  shown  a  benefit  risk 
balance  at  least  similar  to  existing  therapies  could  be  considered  of  significant  clinical  benefit  if  it  acts 
through  a  different  principal  mechanism  of  action  and  thus  provides  a  treatment  alternative. 
Secukinumab  interrupts  the  signalling  pathway  of  IL-17-induced  inflammation  in  AS.  Compared  to  the 
other  products  in  the  market,  it  can  be  considered  a  more  specific  and  selective  drug  in  targeting  the 
specific downstream cytokine IL-17. This could result in the quite favourable safety profile observed thus 
far. 
In addition, according to the above-mentioned guidance, a claim for the significant clinical benefit could 
be  considered  if  the  medicinal  product  produces  a  response  different  from  other  treatments  in  a 
substantial part of the targeted population. To date, there is no trial evidence of the efficacy of switching 
a  TNF-IR  patient  to  another  TNFα-blocker/biologic.  Since  the  secukinumab  trials  in  the  treatment  of  AS 
included  a  considerable  proportion  of  patients  (27-39%)  with  previous  use  and  inadequate  response  to 
TNFα-blocker  who  also  experienced  a  favourable  treatment  effect,  secukinumab  treatment  could  be 
considered a major contribution to patient care based on these findings. 
4.  Conclusion 
Secukinumab  is  a  novel  recombinant  monoclonal  anti-human  Interleukin-17A  (IL-17A)  antibody  for  the 
treatment  of  psoriasis.  The  MAH  is  now  seeking  for  AS-indication  together  with  additional  one  year 
marketing protection. 
40% of AS patients are intolerant to or have inadequate response to anti-TNF agents; there is no other 
treatment  option  currently  available  on  the  market  for  these  patients.  Secukinumab  phase  3  trials 
included also a substantial amount of TNF-IR patients, in whom efficacy was demonstrated. 
Due  to  the  novel  mechanism  of  action,  and  benefit-risk  profile  at  least  similar  to  existing  therapies, 
secukinumab  could  be  considered  to  offer  a  significant  clinical  benefit  in  comparison  with  existing 
therapies based on major contribution to patient care, as it provides a treatment alternative and produces 
a response different from other treatments in a substantial part of the targeted population.

5.  Recommendation 
The CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of Article 14(11) 
of  Regulation  (EC)  No.  726/2004  and  the  “Guidance  on  elements  required  to  support  the  significant 
clinical  benefit  in  comparison  with  existing  therapies  of  a  new  therapeutic  indication  in  order  to  benefit 
from  an  extended  (11-year)  marketing  protection  period”,  and  considers,  that  the  new  therapeutic 
indication brings a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Santen Oy submitted on 16 December 2016 an application for marketing authorisation to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Verkazia, through the centralised procedure falling within 
the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 25 February 2016. 
Verkazia was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/06/360 on 6 April 2006 in the following 
condition: treatment of vernal keratoconjunctivitis. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: treatment of severe vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) 
in children and adolescents from 4 to 18 years old.  
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Verkazia as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. The outcome of the COMP review can be found on the Agency's website: 
ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Rare disease designations. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that ciclosporin was considered to be a known active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
This application is submitted as a multiple of Ikervis authorised on 19 March 2015 in accordance with 
Article 82.1 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0142/2015 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0142/2015. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a rare form of ocular allergy characterised by an inflammation of 
the conjunctivitis with corneal involvement and tissue remodelling including papillae formation. It was 
first described by Arlt in 1846 who reported 3 cases of perilimbal swelling in young patients. The 
association with springtime (vernal) reflects the seasonal increase in signs and symptoms of the 
condition, particularly the high prevalence in hot, arid environments. Affected individuals have disease 
flares frequently during spring months, but can have signs and symptoms year round (perennially). 
Disease severity is defined based on clinical signs and symptoms of ocular surface inflammation. 
Chronic and severe forms of VKC bear an increased risk of sight threatening complications. 
Verkazia is proposed for use as treatment of severe vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) in children and 
adolescents from 4 to 18 years old. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
VKC is a disease with great racial and geographical variation. It is most common and most severe in 
hot, arid environments such as the Mediterranean basin, West Africa, and the Indian subcontinent. In 
these areas, up to 3% of eye clinic patients present with VKC and 10% of outpatient appointments are 
made for signs and symptoms related to VKC. In Western Europe, VKC is less frequent. An 
epidemiologic survey of 6 countries in the European Union (Italy, France, the Netherlands, Norway, 
Finland, and Sweden) reported that while VKC can be found in both northern and southern Europe, a 
higher prevalence is in the southern countries (Bremond-Gignac 2008). Differences in prevalence could 
be due to the diversity of the gene pool, the environment (climate, socioeconomic status, and living 
styles), and to gene-environment interaction. Overall, the prevalence is estimated at 1 to 3 in 10,000 
people in the European Union (EU). 
The condition is more common in males, although this gender difference is less absolute in tropical 
climates. Signs and symptoms usually occur first before the age of 10 with a typical onset between 5 
and 12 years of age (Leonardi 2002, Pucci 2002, Bonini 2004). The disease usually lasts 4 to 10 years 
and resolves after puberty, although in some cases it can continue into early adulthood. The gender 
discrepancy and the improvement seen during puberty have suggested a role for a hormonal influence 
on the disease burden. 
A family history of allergic diseases occurs in around one third of VKC cases, and many patients have a 
history of atopy (more frequent in temperate regions) and/or other associated allergic conditions such 
as asthma, eczema, and rhinitis. A positive skin prick test is present in only half of the patients. 
Climate and geography also correlate with the associated concurrence of asthma, eczema and atopy. 
Limbal VKC is more often seen in patients of African or Asian descent, a racial susceptibility that 
appears also among those who have migrated to more temperate locations.

2.1.3.   Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The pathogenesis of VKC has not been completely elucidated and the aetiology may involve a variety 
of factors, including environmental allergens, climate, and genetic predisposition. VKC is an 
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) and T cell-mediated allergic reaction with additional, ill-defined, non-specific, 
hypersensitivity responses. Cytological, biohumoral, immunohistological and molecular biological 
studies indicate a key role of Type 2 T helper cells. Mast cells, eosinophils and their mediators play 
major roles in the clinical manifestation of VKC. In addition to typical Th2-derived cytokines, 
interleukins IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, other cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and enzymes are over-
expressed in the conjunctiva of VKC patients (Leonardi et al., 2009). Furthermore, structural cells, 
such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts, are involved both in the inflammatory process and in the tissue 
remodelling phase. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
VKC is differentiated from other ocular allergic conditions, such as seasonal or perennial allergic 
conjunctivitis, infectious conjunctivitis or ocular rosacea in children. Clinically, VKC is characterised by 
both conjunctival (hyperaemia, oedema, discharge) and corneal signs (superficial keratitis, corneal 
ulcerations, plaques, scars). Patients have a characteristic ropey, stringy mucous and/or serous 
discharge. Typical symptoms include photophobia, burning, pruritus, and blepharospasm. Intense 
ocular itching, followed by tearing and ropey, stringy mucous and/or serous discharge, and foreign 
body sensation are the predominant disease signs and symptoms.  
VKC appears mainly seasonally but can also be perennial, chronic and/or with acute exacerbations. It 
usually occurs bilaterally. Unilateral cases are less frequent and more often observed at the time of 
disease onset. 
VKC may present in three distinct phenotypes: palpebral (tarsal), limbal, and mixed forms. The 
hallmark sign of palpebral VKC is the presence of papillary hyperplasia of the upper tarsal conjunctiva, 
ranging from papillae of 1 mm of diameter to giant papillae. The tarsal conjunctiva typically develops a 
cobblestone appearance and, in active disease, can have mucus accumulation between the papillae. 
During exacerbations of palpebral VKC, punctate epithelial keratopathy may develop, which may 
progress to macro-erosion and sight threatening shield ulcers. Limbal VKC is characterised by the 
infiltration of limbal subconjunctival tissues forming nodules, sometimes accompanied by pannus of 
superficial neovascularisation of the peripheral cornea, making the limbus to appear thickened and 
opaque. They often are topped by chalky white excrescences, known as Horner–Trantas dots or 
Tantras dots consisting of degenerated epithelial cells and eosinophils. Limbal disease can induce stem 
cell deficiency that leads to compromised corneal surface, characterised by corneal vascularisation, 
chronic stromal inflammation, persistent epithelial defects and ingrowth of conjunctival epithelium onto 
the corneal surface. Palpebral forms are more prevalent in Europe and the Americas, whereas mixed 
and limbal forms are more seen in Asia and Africa respectively, with some geographic 
variation.Disease severity seems generally milder in limbal VKC compared to tarsal forms, leading 
some to suspect that it is the early presentation with the spectrum of the disease. At the same time, 
the high variability in the prevalence of certain VKC types, based on geography and atopic history, 
suggests that the pathogenesis of the two phenotypes may be different.  
The diagnosis of VKC involves a comprehensive clinical history and ophthalmic examination and is 
based on the clinical symptoms of the disease as well as the findings of Trantas’ dots and large 
cobblestone papillae that differentiate VKC from seasonal allergic conjunctivitis or perennial allergic 
conjunctivitis. Determination of total or specific IgE and skin test are no useful diagnostic tools being 
negative in 50% of patients.

Page 9/77 
 
 
 
A simple clinical grading system has been proposed by Bonini (2007). However, given that the clinical 
presentation of VKC can differ significantly depending on geographic area and genetic background, 
there is no consensus on the definition of severity in the scientific literature. 
Table 1 Clinical grading of VKC (Bonini, 2007) 
Generally, VKC is a benign and self-limiting condition with spontaneous resolution after puberty. 
However, both severe forms and chronic disease course, and sometimes unsupervised corticosteroid 
use (see section 2.1.5. ) have been found to increase the odds for complications which can be sight 
threatening. Visual loss may occur due to corneal complications such as ulcers, scarring, corneal 
opacities, limbal stem cell deficiency, astigmatism and keratoconus.  
2.1.5.  Management 
The management of VKC is based on a step-wise approach. The use of one and/or another treatment 
depends mainly on disease severity, e.g. the duration and frequency of symptoms and the severity of 
corneal involvement, and may vary for a given patient throughout the years. 
Symptoms of itching, burning, and irritation can be managed with cool compresses and saline rinses. 
Preservative-free artificial tears can also be used at liberty to alleviate symptoms. These simple 
measures can be used irrespective of disease severity and have been reported by patients to provide 
significant symptomatic relief. 
Among topical medications, antihistamines (levocabastine 0.05%, emedastine 0.05%) and mast cell 
stabilisers (sodium cromoglycate 2%-4%, lodoxamide 0.1%) are commonly used. Surprisingly, despite 
the major role of histamine in VKC, antihistamines alone have not proven entirely successful. Dual-
acting agents with activity against H1 receptors and mast cell degranulation (olopatadine 0.1%) have 
been shown to be effective in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis and are also used in cases of VKC. 
Topical acetylcysteine 5% to 10% has been used to reduce mucus adherence to the cornea during 
exacerbations. Other agents that have been tried with varying degrees of efficacy in a limited number 
Assessment report  
EMA/505143/2017  
Page 10/77 
 
 
 
 
 
of studies include mitomycin-C and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including ketorolac 
and diclofenac. 
Corticosteroids as potent anti-inflammatories and immunosuppressant are often used in moderate to 
severe disease with persistent symptoms and particularly to quiet disease exacerbations. However, 
their side-effect profile in particular with long-term use, including formation of cataracts, increase of 
intraocular pressure (IOP), induction and exacerbation of glaucoma, impaired wound healing, and 
increased susceptibility to infection including herpetic infection, is a major limitation of this treatment 
choice. Use of antihistamine/mast cell stabilisers as maintenance therapy and then pulse therapy with 
topical steroids during disease exacerbations is a common practice.  
With their ability to inhibit T-cell activation, hospital-compounded preparations of 0.5% to 2% 
ciclosporin A (CsA) ophthalmic emulsion in olive or castor oil have been used for decades as an 
alternative to steroids in moderate to severe forms of VKC. Adverse reactions have been reported to 
be primarily limited to stinging at the time of instillation.   
Finally, surgical treatment may be needed in rare cases. Surgical removal of corneal plaque is 
recommended only in severe, persistent cases to allow corneal re-epithelialisation. Giant papillae 
excision with intraoperative mitomycin-C may be considered with severe mechanical ptosis and large, 
coarse papillae with corneal changes. 
2.1.6.  About the product 
Verkazia 1 mg/ml (0.1%) eye drops, emulsion is a sterile, ophthalmic emulsion that contains 
ciclosporin (CsA) as active ingredient. CsA is a lipophilic cyclic polypeptide that has been used for 
several decades as systemic immunosuppressant for the prevention of graft rejection following 
organ/tissue transplantation and the treatment of various immune diseases. It has anti-inflammatory 
properties due to its ability to inhibit the development of cell-mediated reactions and has been shown 
to inhibit the production and/or release of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as to upregulate the 
release of anti-inflammatory cytokines.  
Verkazia includes the same formulation as Ikervis, which has been approved via the centralised 
procedure by the European Commission (EC) Decision on 19 March 2015 for the treatment of severe 
keratitis in adult patients with dry eye disease, which has not improved despite treatment with tear 
substitutes.  
Verkazia is proposed to be used for the treatment of severe VKC in children and adolescents from 4 to 
18 years old. 
2.1.7.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
This was a complete and independent application in accordance with Article 8.3 of Directive 
2001/83/EC submitted as a multiple of Ikervis in accordance with Article 82.1 of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on an unmet medical need in the 
absence of authorised CsA treatments for VKC in the EU and the possible irreversible sight-threatening 
character of the condition in particular in case of severe disease with persistent symptoms where it 
could be a beneficial alternative to topical steroid treatment.

emulsion, EU/1/15/990/001-002. IKERVIS was granted the Marketing Authorisation (MA) on 19 March 
2015. 
The emulsion is milky-white in appearance. The finished product is packed in conventional low density 
polyethylene (LDPE) single dose containers containing 0.3 ml of the emulsion. The single dose 
containers are provided in strips of five, which are packaged in a conventional sealed laminate pouch. 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to obtain a formulation of ciclosporin for topical ocular 
delivery. Due to the poor aqueous solubility of the active substance the development of an emulsion 
was pursued. A positively charged emulsion was designed to extend the residence time on the eye 
(due to electrostatic attraction with the negative charge of the ocular surface) in contrast with 
conventional eye drop solutions, where washout of the formulation occurs rapidly after instillation.  
In addition, eye drops are easy to administer and the resulting level of systemic exposure to the active 
substance is reduced compared to systemic delivery.  
Therefore, the development program was designed to develop an ophthalmic oil-in-water emulsion 
formulation that was suitable for conventional ocular instillation, easy to manufacture as a sterile 
product, isotonic to human tears and physically and chemically stable at room temperature. 
The following key factors were considered: choice of oil solvent for drug solubilisation, choice of 
surfactant to stabilise the emulsion, choice of other excipients to optimise ocular tolerability, droplet 
size, physical and chemical stability of the formulation, impact of heat sterilisation, impact of pH drop 
over shelf life. 
A solubility study of ciclosporin in different oily media was conducted to select the solubilising agent. 
The results from this study indicated that maximum solubility was achieved in medium-chain 
triglycerides (MCT) followed by castor oil and soybean oil.  As a result, MCT, a fully saturated 
triglyceride was chosen.  Moreover, as MCT is stable to oxidation compared to unsaturated oils, the 
risk of rancidity is eliminated, the use of an antioxidant is avoided and a longer shelf life can be 
guaranteed.  MCT also has a very low viscosity, ensuring easy spreading on the eye’s surface following 
administration.  
In order to facilitate the emulsification process and to stabilise the product by decreasing the interfacial 
tension between oil and water the addition of a surfactant was required. Two surfactants 
complimentary to each other in their hydrophilic–lipophilic balance were chosen: Tyloxapol (HLB of 
12.5) and Poloxamer 188 (HLB of 29) to ensure physical stability of the dispersed oil phase within the 
aqueous phase.  
In addition, a cationic surfactant was chosen for use in the drug product based upon positive results in 
literature  indicating  that  positively  charged  emulsions  can  optimise  spreading  and  exposure  of  the

ocular surface to the drug product. Several cationic agents were considered. During initial development 
benzalkonium  chloride  (BAK)  was  selected  because  of  its  extensive  use  in  approved  ophthalmic 
formulations, usually as a preservative. However, in this formulation it is used only as a cationic agent. 
This  formulation  was  used  in  the  initial  pharmaceutical,  nonclinical  and  clinical  development. 
Subsequently,  the  applicant  decided  to  replace  BAK  with  cetalkonium  chloride  (CKC)  since  this  is  the 
most  lipophilic  of  the  three  homologues  to  BAK.  The  selection  of  CKC  instead  of  BAK  resulted  in  a 
reduction  of  the  amount  of  quaternary  ammonium  used  by  a  factor  of  4.  To  determine  the  optimal 
concentration of CKC, a series of emulsions containing different concentrations of CKC were evaluated 
for  zeta  potential  and  droplet  size  distribution  at  the  initial  time  point  and  after  stress  conditions  (15 
days at 80°C) and freeze-thaw cycles. 
Moreover, the applicant conducted a number of studies to compare the BAK and CKC formulations to 
identify any potential changes in the product performance or quality specifications. The comparisons 
consisted of physicochemical comparison (appearance, zeta potential, droplet size, pH, osmolality, 
viscosity), ciclosporin assay and degradation products comparison over 36 months storage at long 
term conditions (25°C / 40% RH) or 6 months storage at accelerated conditions (40°C / ≤ 25% RH) 
and droplet size analysis. The obtained results demonstrated that the replacement of BAK by CKC does 
not impact the formulation. 
In order to control the osmolality of the formulation, two excipients were considered sodium chloride 
and glycerol. The latter was chosen as sodium chloride affected emulsion stability.   
Finally, sodium hydroxide was selected as ophthalmic pH adjuster, and water for injections as the 
aqueous diluent for the emulsion. 
Well-known pharmaceutical excipients were selected to ensure good ocular tolerability of the 
formulation, as described above. The excipients used are compliant with Ph. Eur. standards, except 
CKC which is controlled through an in-house specification which includes some of the Ph. Eur. 
parameters applied to BAK, since CKC is a constituent of the mixture of homologues making up BAK. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included 
in section 6.1 of the SmPC.  
The compatibility of the active substance with all the excipients used in the finished product 
formulation has been demonstrated through development, accelerated and long term stability studies. 
The finished product is a white milky emulsion intended to be applied topically to the eye and is 
presented in single-dose containers over-wrapped with an aluminium pouch to prevent moisture loss 
and protect from light. 
The emulsion has been characterised in terms of type of emulsion, impact of droplet size and structure 
of the droplet. 
Stability studies indicated that the formulation undergoes a decrease in pH over time and quickly 
reaches a threshold value. Since the water used in the preparation is of high quality and no ionic 
species are added to the formulation, a small amount of a pH decreasing substance (e.g. carbon 
dioxide in the atmosphere) can cause a significant fall in pH. A pharmaceutical study was conducted to 
evaluate the impact of the administration of an acidic drop of the drug product onto the surface of the 
eye. This study concluded that the pH of the tear film would remain unchanged after the administration 
of one drop of the proposed formulation.  Therefore, the low apparent pH of the formulation is not 
considered as an issue regarding the quality and product attributes since no degradation of ciclosporin 
or physical instability have been reported along with the pH decrease over time.  
The choice of the manufacturing process has been adequately justified; the critical process steps and 
parameters were identified. The sterility of the final product is ensured by combining a moist heat bulk

sterilisation with an aseptic filling into blow-fill-seal single dose containers, since the primary packaging 
made of semi permeable LDPE does not allow a terminal sterilisation by heat. The method of 
sterilisation was selected accordingly to the Annex to the Note for Guidance on Development 
Pharmaceutics detailing the Decision Trees for the selection of Sterilisation Method 
(CPMP/QWP/054/098 Corr).  
The primary packaging is 0.3 ml single-dose, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) containers presented in 
a sealed laminate aluminium pouch. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirement. The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  six  main  steps:  preparation  of  oily  and  aqueous  phases,  high 
shearing  mixing,  high  pressure  homogenization,  sterilisation  of  the  bulk  emulsion  by  heat,  aseptic 
filling utilizing the blow-fill-seal (BFS) technique and packaging.  
The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  non-standard  manufacturing  process  since  the  emulsion  is  a 
specialised  pharmaceutical  dosage  form  and  aseptic  filling  is  applied.  The  process  is  generally  well-
described, the critical process parameters and in-process controls are specified. Process validation has 
been performed on nine commercial scale batches. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing 
process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The 
in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The finished product specifications described in the table below include appropriate tests for this kind 
of dosage form appearance, identification (HPLC, HPLC/UV, TLC), pH (Ph. Eur.), osmolality  (Ph. Eur.), 
zeta potential (electrophoretic mobility), mean droplets size (dynamic light scattering), uniformity of 
dosage units (content uniformity) (Ph. Eur.), assay (Ph. Eur.), related substances (Ph. Eur.), sterility 
(Ph. Eur.).  
The proposed specifications are in line with ICHQ6A and general Ph. Eur requirements. However, there 
is scope for further tightening of the pH limits. Due to the limited batch analysis data at the time of 
opinion, the applicant is recommended to re-evaluate the pH specification limit in light of new stability 
data from the next 10 new commercial scale batches.  
Beside compendial methods, in-house analytical methods are used for identification and assay of the 
active substance and determination of degradation products by HPLC/UV as well as for zeta potential, 
and mean droplets size. The in-house methods have been adequately validated. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 pilot scale and 3 commercial scale batches confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.

Stability of the product 
Stability data on three pilot scale batches and three full scale batches stored under long term 
conditions (25 °C / 40% RH) and under intermediate conditions (30 °C / 65% RH) for up to 36 months 
(pilot batches), and up to 6 months (full scale batches), as well as at accelerated conditions (40 
°C/≤25%RH) for 6 months according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches are identical to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, pH, osmolality, zeta potential, mean droplet size, assay, related 
substances and sterility.  
The applicant performed forced degradation studies as a part of the validation of the HPLC method for 
related substances. The studies confirmed that isociclosporin A is the main degradation product under 
acidic, oxidative, heat and light conditions. It can also be concluded that the related substances 
analytical method is stability indicating. 
In addition, one batch exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug Substances and Products. Significant drop in pH is noted in photostability studies. Hence the 
product is to be protected from light.  
A freeze-thaw cycle testing (24-hour freezing cycle at -18 °C, followed by thawing for 4 hours at 
60 °C) and shipment stability testing (at 50 °C during 2 weeks, 5 °C during 2 and 4 weeks and -20 °C 
during 2 weeks (with one freeze-thaw cycling after 1 week) was performed.  The results from these 
studies confirm that the product quality is not affected by temperature excursions that might occur 
during transportation. 
The product was stable over the time-period of the studies. All results remained well within the 
proposed shelf life specifications and no trend was noted in any of the parameters tested apart from a 
drop of pH during photo-stability testing. This led to the conclusion that the product has to be 
protected from light as described in the SmPC. 
Based on available stability data, the 3 years shelf-life and storage conditions “Do not freeze. Store 
below 30°C. Keep single-dose containers in the pouch in order to protect from light and avoid 
evaporation” as stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. A positively charged oil-in-water emulsion has been designed 
to extend the residence time of ciclosporin on the eye allowing a once-daily dosing. The choice of 
excipients used in the formulation has been well justified and it has been demonstrated by a number of 
studies that a physically and chemically stable emulsion with good ocular tolerability was produced. 
The manufacturing process has been well described and adequately validated. The results of tests 
carried out indicated consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these 
in turn led to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in 
clinical use.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
The applicant is recommended to re-evaluate the pH specification limit post-approval, based on new 
stability data from the next 10 new commercial scale batches. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical development programme for Verkazia was abridged and focused on the investigation 
of the disposition of CsA after single and repeated administration, in order to quantify the local and 
systemic exposure following ocular administration, and the examination of the topical effects in 
safety/local tolerance studies. The non-clinical development program was furthermore supplemented 
by reports in the scientific literature. Apart from 3 single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in rabbits 
and 2 mechanistic studies, all non-clinical studies were conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory 
Practice.  
No non-clinical pharmacology studies were performed as no adequate model of VKC existed and given 
that  CsA  is  a  known  active  substance  that  has  been  used  for  several  decades  in  the  prophylaxis  of 
organ  rejection  following  transplantation  as  well  as  in  the  treatment  of  immune  and  inflammatory 
disorders,  and  the  pharmacodynamic  effect  is  well described  in the  scientific literature  both  based on 
animal models and studies in men. 
No studies in juvenile animals (PK or toxicology studies) were performed since the external parts of the 
eye are already fully developed in the proposed target population of children from 4 years of age and 
adolescents.   
Furthermore,  as  the  systemic  exposure  after  ocular  instillation  of  Verkazia  was  considered  negligible, 
no  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity  or  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies  were  performed. 
Instead,  the  applicant  made  reference  to  published  studies  in  the  scientific  literature  concerning 
administration of CsA via other routes of administration. 
Some of the non-clinical studies were performed with a former formulation containing benzalkonium 
chloride (BAK) at a concentration of 0.02% w/w, which was replaced in the final formulation proposed 
for approval by cetalkonium chloride (CKC) at a concentration of 0.005% w/w. This was considered in 
principle acceptable, given that BAK is a mixture of quaternary ammonium compounds including CKC 
and at a concentration of 0.02% w/w contains more CKC than the final formulation, thus representing 
a worst case scenario in the safety assessment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The mechanism of action of CsA is well known and has been described in numerous publications in the 
scientific literature (see section 2.4.3. ).  
Animal  models  exactly  reflecting  the  human  pathology  of  VKC  were  not  available  at  the  time  of  this 
report and therefore no non-clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted by the applicant.  
The use of topically administered CsA for the treatment of local immune and inflammatory disorders of 
the eye has been documented by means of several publications in the scientific literature for both the 
non-clinical  and  clinical  setting.  This 
includes 
the  use 
for 
the 
treatment  of  dry  eye 
disease/keratoconjunctivitis  sicca  in  dogs  (Kaswan et  al.,  1989,  Olivero  et  al.,  1991,  Kaswan  et  al., 
1994,  and  Gao  et  al.,  1998).  Further  data  showed  that  CsA  exerts  its  therapeutic  effect  on 
keratoconjunctivitis  sicca  not  only  by  inhibiting  T-cells  and  increasing  goblet  cells,  but  also  by 
increasing  Aquaporin  3  expression  in  the  conjunctiva  (Sun  et  al.,  2005),  and  through  an  antagonist 
effect on prolactin. The inhibition of apoptosis appears also to be a key mechanism for the therapeutic 
effect  of  CsA  for  keratoconjunctivtis  sicca  (Strong  et  al.,  2005).  Similar  targets  of  the  anti-
inflammatory  therapy  with  CsA  in  VKC,  i.e.  T-cell  infiltration,  apoptosis,  and  cytokines,  have  been 
postulated also for allergic inflammation of the eye surface such as VKC. Furthermore, the efficacy and 
safety  of  CsA  in  VKC  patients  has  already  been  investigated  and  discussed  in  the  literature  (Gupta 
2001, Pucci 2002, Pucci 2010, Tesse 2010, Labcharoenwongs 2012, Leonardi 2013, and Yucel 2015). 
According  to  ICH  S7A  guideline  ‘safety  pharmacology  studies  may  not  be  needed  for  locally  applied 
agents  (e.g.,  dermal  or  ocular)  where  the  pharmacology  of  the  test  substance  is  well  characterized, 
and where systemic exposure or distribution to other organs or tissues is demonstrated to be low’. As 
these  conditions  were  met  for  Verkazia  (see  summary  of  systemic  absorption  of  CsA  after  ocular 
administration  in  the  following  sections),  no  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  conducted.  This  was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  goal  of  the  non-clinical  PK  programme  was  to  characterise  the  ocular  bio-disposition  of  CsA 
following  single  and  multiple  ocular  administrations  of  Verkazia,  and  to  compare  it  with  Restasis 
(0.05%), which is authorised in the United States of America for the treatment of KCS and was used as 
a  reference  product  because  it  was  the  only  other  CsA-containing  eye  drop  formulation  available  for 
human use at the time of the non-clinical development. To this end, the applicant performed single and 
multiple dose studies in rabbits.  
Validated  high-pressure  liquid  chromatography  (HPLC)  mass  spectrometry  (MS),  ultra-performance 
liquid  chromatography-MS/MS  and  liquid  chromatography-MS/MS  methods  were  used  for  the 
determination  of  CsA  concentrations  in  rabbit  whole  blood  and  various  ocular  tissues  (cornea, 
conjunctivae).  The  limits  of  quantification  ranged  from  0.1 ng/ml  in  whole  blood  to  50  ng/g  in  the 
cornea. 
Absorption 
The formulation used for the non-clinical PK studies included BAK (0.02% w/w), which was later 
replaced by CKC (0.005% w/w) in the final formulation proposed for commercial use. Furthermore, the 
old formulation included vitamin E (dl-α-tocopherol), which was no longer present in the new 
formulation. In order to confirm that the ocular PK profile of the two formulations was comparable, the 
applicant performed a single dose study in rabbits. The study showed that the exchange of BAK for 
CKC and removal of dl-α-tocopherol had no effect on the overall ocular PK parameters in the 
Assessment report

conjunctiva and cornea. Both maximum concentrations (cmax) and areas under the curve (AUCs) 
measured for the two formulations in ocular tissues were comparable.   
•  Ocular tissue 
CsA concentrations increased in a dose proportional manner in the cornea and conjunctiva after both 
single and multiple instillation of 50 μl of 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/ml CsA eye drops and displayed half-lives 
of 3.19-6.68 hours and 26.21-53.25 hours in the conjunctiva and cornea, respectively. Maximum 
concentration (cmax) was attained generally at 0.33 hours. No (conjunctiva) or slight (cornea) 
accumulation of CsA in ocular tissues was observed following multiple administrations. CsA AUC levels 
in the cornea were found to be doubled after a single instillation of CsA eye drops (0.5 mg/ml) 
compared to single installation of Restasis 0.5 mg/ml. Conjunctival AUC levels were similar for both 
formulations. Following repeated administrations (for 10 days) of CsA 0.1% once daily, tissue CsA 
concentrations (cmin) were observed in the cornea at steady state similar to those observed following a 
10-day treatment with Restasis (0.05%) twice daily (BID). 
•  Systemic exposure 
Whole blood CsA exposure as measured in rabbits following single or multiple instillations of 50 μl of 
CsA eye drops up to a strength of 1 mg/ml was shown to be negligible with all values below the limit of 
detection (LOD) of 0.1 ng/ml.   
Distribution and metabolism 
Radioactivity levels were measured in ocular (including cornea and conjunctiva) and non-ocular tissues 
of rabbits treated with 3H-CsA formulations (both Verkazia and Restasis) for 7 days, at 1 hour and 24 
hours after the last administration. No significant difference was found between both formulations. The 
highest  radioactivity  levels  were  found  in  external  ocular  structures,  and  low  levels  were  observed  in 
deep  ocular  tissues.  Some  levels  of  radioactivity  were  found  in  systemic  organs  which  the  applicant 
considered to be likely due to the presence of radiolabelled CsA metabolites considering that the higher 
count levels were found in the major elimination organs, liver and kidney.  
Another  study  was  performed  to  investigate  CsA  penetration  in  the  cornea  and  conjunctiva  of 
pigmented  rabbits  after  4  daily  (QID)  20 μl  instillations  over  10  days  of  Verkazia  (CsA  0.1%  cationic 
emulsion)  compared  to  an  oily  1%  CsA  solution.  This  study  suggested  that  the  cationic  emulsion  of 
Verkazia has a slower penetration compared to the oil solution (although penetration lasted longer due 
to the longer residence time of the cationic vehicle on the ocular surface) and avoids successive peaks 
and lows following each instillation due to a slower rate of elimination. 
No  additional  drug  metabolism  or  drug  interaction  studies  have  been  performed  by  the  applicant  as 
ophthalmic ciclosporin metabolism could not be demonstrated in dogs and rabbits (Acheampong 1999, 
Wiederholt 1986). This was considered acceptable. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single and repeat dose toxicity 
The  applicant  did  not  perform  any  single  or  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  due  to  the  low  systemic 
exposure after ocular use of Verkazia. However, repeated doses of Verkazia were tested in rabbits to 
investigate local tolerance (see below).  
The applicant furthermore provided literature data including both non-clinical and clinical long term use 
(up to 3 years) of eye drops containing CsA. This included a 6-months study in dogs being treated with 
Assessment report  
EMA/505143/2017  
Page 19/77 
 
 
 
veterinary  oil-based  CsA-containing  ointment  (0.2%),  showing  that  BID  administration  was  well 
tolerated with no safety concerns, either locally or at the systemic level.  
Genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproduction toxicity 
As  the  systemic  exposure  after  ocular  instillation  of  Verkazia  was  negligible,  the  applicant  did  not 
perform  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity  or  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies,  and  instead 
summarised  relevant  information  from  the  scientific  literature.  This  approach  was  considered 
acceptable. 
CsA  is  referred  to  in  the  literature  as  a  non-genotoxic  human  carcinogen  (McClain  2001,  Hernandez 
2009).  The  carcinogenic  potential  has  been  previously  investigated  (Ryffel  1992,  Durnian  2007), 
however  excessive  immunosuppression  allowing  for  uncontrolled  cellular  growth  was  not  expected  at 
the doses used with an ocular topical application of CsA 1 mg/ml, even in eye tissues. 
No  adequate  and  well-controlled  studies  in  pregnant  or  breast-feeding  women  were  available  with 
either oral CsA or ophthalmic dosage forms, however Ryffel (1983) reported no teratogenic effects of 
CsA  in  rats  and  rabbits  up  to  maternal  toxic  doses  of  30mg/kg,  but  there  was  some  evidence  for 
reproductive toxicity at high (>maternal toxic) doses, at which foetal death and growth retardation of 
the off-spring occurred.  
Local tolerance 
Local  tolerance  was  investigated  in  four  28-day  studies  in  rabbits  with  instillations  in  the  eyes  four 
times  a  day  in  line  with  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  non-clinical  local  tolerance  testing  on  medicinal 
products  (CPMP/SWP/2145/00).  Two  of these  studies  used  a  CsA  formulation  with  BAK  and  two  used 
the CKC formulation.  
Briefly,  0.25,  0.5  and  1  mg/ml  CsA  eye  drops  were  well  tolerated  in  rabbits  receiving  multiple  daily 
instillations (50 µL) at 4-hour and 90-minute intervals for 28 days.  Slight signs of irritation mainly in 
nictitans membrane and eyelids were noted in all treated animals, as well as in animals administered 
the  vehicle  alone.  Slight  conjunctival  redness  was  observed  at  a  concentration  of  1  mg/ml  but  no 
histopathological  findings  were  reported.  Moreover,  slight  transient  conjunctivae  irritation  reactions 
accompanied  with  slight  focal  unilateral  and  chronic  conjunctivitis  on  the  bulbar  conjunctiva 
histopathology findings were also noted in a study with CsA 0.1% 0.005% w/w CKC.  However, these 
findings  were  also  seen  in  an  untreated  eye  and  were  considered  attributable  to  the  daily  repeated 
instillations. The minor epithelial ulcerations or linear marks of the cornea also seen in this study were 
considered attributable to slight traumatisms and not treatment related.  
Removal of dl-α-tocopherol had no impact on the ocular tolerance of the formulation and the change of 
the excipient from 0.02% w/w BAK to 0.005% w/w CKC did not elicit any ocular intolerance and was 
considered safe and well tolerated.  
Corneal sensitivity following repeated instillation was examined in a study with rabbits. Verkazia (CsA 
0.1%) and its vehicle did not cause any anaesthesia of the cornea in rabbits.  
Other toxicity studies 
The applicant furthermore performed a Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA) assay in mice to evaluate the 
skin sensitisation potential of the vehicle as well as a murine UV-LLNA assay and a study in guinea pigs 
to assess the phototoxic and photoallergic potential. The LLNA assay showed that neither the BAK nor 
Assessment report

CKC  containing  formulations  induced  delayed  contact  hypersensitivity.  Furthermore,  Verkazia  was 
devoid of phototoxic and photoallergic potentials.  
The applicant also presented the results of three non-GLP studies examining different safety attributes 
of  the  cationic  emulsion  in  rabbits.  In  the  first  of  the  three  studies  (Liang  2008),  both  BAK  and  CKC 
containing cationic emulsions proved safer and well tolerated by ocular surface tissue when compared 
to  their  equivalent  aqueous  solutions.  The  second  study  (Liang  2012b)  demonstrated  that  CsA  0.5 
mg/ml  containing  0.005% CKC  was  well  tolerated  and  was  comparable  to  other  BAK  free  CsA 
formulations  (i.e.  Restasis  and  ciclosporin  oil  solution)  as  assessed  by  both  Draize  test  and  in  vivo 
confocal  microscopy 
irritation 
scores.  Finally, 
to  assess 
the  effects  of 
the 
cationic 
emulsion/formulations  on  corneal  wound  healing,  the  applicant  examined  the  effects  of  the  cationic 
emulsion containing 0.005% w/w CKC onto damaged cornea (Liang 2012a). Results indicated that the 
cationic 0.005% w/w CKC emulsion was well tolerated by altered corneal epithelium and had a positive 
effect on cell survival and migration compared to 0.02% w/w BAK aqueous solution. 
The absence of studies in juvenile animals was considered acceptable given that the systemic exposure 
after ocular instillation of Verkazia was negligible and considering that the external parts of the eye are 
fully developed in the target population. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
CsA is not considered to be an endocrine disrupting compound (Daughton 2001). Furthermore, CsA is 
not  a  persistent,  bioaccumulative  and  toxic  (PBT)  substance  as  the  octanol/water  partition  coefficient 
(log Kow) does not exceed 4.5.  
Using the default value for the market penetration factor (Fpen) of 1% and assuming a maximum dose 
of  4 drops  of  CsA  0.1%  per  eye  and  day,  the  predicted  environmental  concentration  in  the 
surfacewater (PECsurfacewater) of CsA was calculated to be 0.001 μg/L, which is below the action limit of 
0.01  µg/L.  The  applicant  furthermore  reflected  on  the  fact  that  CsA  is  already  used  in  existing 
marketed  products  used  for  the  prevention  of  transplant  organ  rejection,  and  for  the  treatment  of 
psoriasis,  severe  rheumatoid  arthritis  and  ulcerative  colitis.  No  significant  increase  in  environmental 
exposure is anticipated given the rarity of VKC and the low topical doses required for treatment.  
Therefore Verkazia is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
Animal  models  for  VKC  were  not  available  at  the  time  of  this  report.  Furthermore,  the 
pharmacodynamic  effects  of  CsA  are  well  described  in  the  scientific  literature  and  the  safety  and 
efficacy  of  ophthalmic  preparations  of  CsA  has  already  been  investigated  in  the  clinical  setting. 
Therefore, the CHMP considered the absence of primary pharmacodynamic studies acceptable.  
The lack of secondary pharmacodynamic and specific safety pharmacology studies was also considered 
acceptable by the CHMP in view of the negligible systemic passage of CsA after ocular treatment with 
Verkazia (see also PK discussion below).  
Pharmacokinetics 
The exchange of BAK for CKC and removal of vitamin E in the final Verkazia formulation was shown not 
to have an effect on the overall ocular PK parameters measured in the conjunctiva and cornea, which 
was considered reassuring by the CHMP considering that several non-clinical studies had been 
conducted with the old BAK (and vitamin E) containing formulation only.  
No (conjunctiva) or slight (cornea) accumulation of CsA in ocular tissues of rabbits was observed 
following multiple administrations, reflecting the highly vascularised conjunctiva environment where 
clearance is significantly greater compared to the cornea.  
Systemic exposure after ocular administration of Verkazia up to a strength of 1 mg/ml was found to be 
negligible. However, in an ocular autoradiographic study in rabbits, some levels of radioactivity were 
found in systemic organs, which was attributed by the applicant to the presence of radiolabelled CsA 
metabolites. The CHMP considered this explanation difficult to follow given that data in the scientific 
literature suggest that CsA is not metabolised in the eye (at least in dogs and rabbits; Acheampong 
1999, Wiederholt 1986), which was also the reason why no drug metabolism studies were conducted in 
support of this application. Overall, as CsA is a well-known active substance, the significance of this 
finding was considered limited.  
The  CHMP  also  accepted  that  no  in-vitro  or  in-vivo  drug  interaction  and  metabolism  studies  were 
carried out. While, CsA is known to be a strong inhibitor of several transporters such as P-glycoprotein, 
breast  cancer  resistance  protein  (BCRP),  multidrug  resistance  protein  (MRP)  and  organic  anion-
transporting  polypeptide  B1,  only  transporters  of  the  MRP  family  and  BCRP  are  expressed  and 
functional  in  human  cornea.  The  clinical  relevance  of  CsA’s  possible  interference  with  these  efflux 
transporters  within  the  eye  was  not  entirely  clear  at  the  time  of  this  report.  To  avoid  absorption 
interference  and  partial  wash  out  of  the  product  due  to  the  excess  instilled  volume,  the  SmPC 
recommends  that  Verkazia  should  not  be  administered  at  the  same  time  with  other  eye  drops,  but 
rather  15  minutes  apart, which  was  considered  adequate  by  the  CHMP.  Furthermore,  the  applicant  is 
already conducting a drug-drug interaction study as recommended by the CHMP to be conducted after 
Assessment report  
EMA/505143/2017  
Page 22/77 
 
 
 
the  approval  of  Ikervis  for  the  treatment  of  dry  eye  disease.  The  study  aims  at  obtaining  additional 
information on the interaction potential at the transporter level (two year study program), as well as at 
the  cellular  level  (one  year  study  program).  The  applicant  should  consider  the  impact  of  the  study 
results, once available, for Verkazia including the need for an update of the product information. 
Toxicology 
Systemic exposure to CsA after ocular use was found to be negligible and thus the risk of systemic side 
effects due to circulating CsA levels was considered to be low, justifying the lack of certain toxicological 
tests,  including  any  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity  or  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies. 
However,  since  CsA  has  been  shown  to  have  a  carcinogenic  potential,  peri-ocular  skin  cancer, 
conjunctival  or  corneal  neoplasia  was  included  in  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  as  an  important 
potential  risk  (see  also  discussion  on  clinical  safety  in  section  2.6.1.  ).  Furthermore,  evidence  for 
reproductive toxicity at high systemic doses has been observed in rats and rabbits. Therefore, despite 
the  low  systemic  exposure  at  therapeutic  doses  and  absence  of  any  adverse  pregnancy  outcome 
having  been  observed  in  the  clinical  setting  (see  also  section 2.6.),  Verkazia  is  not  recommended  in 
women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using  effective  contraception  and  use  during  pregnancy  and  in 
lactating women is only recommended if the benefits outweigh the risks. Use in pregnant or lactating 
women is furthermore considered missing information in the RMP and will be monitored post-approval.  
No overt adverse effects attributable to Verkazia were identified in the local tolerance toxicity studies, 
nor in the other toxicology studies conducted. The CHMP considered that the conduct of these studies 
was  in  line  with  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  non-clinical  local  tolerance  testing  on  medicinal  products 
(CPMP/SWP/2145/00).  Although  VKC  is  a  chronic  disease  requiring  regular  administration  of  Verkazia 
over  prolonged periods of  time,  the  application  period  for  local  tolerance  testing  should  generally  not 
exceed  four  weeks,  and  therefore  28 days  was  considered  by  the  CHMP  to  be  an  acceptable 
observation  time.  Furthermore,  a  6  months  study  has  previously  been  performed  in  dogs  with  a 
veterinary 0.2% CsA ointment showing that BID application was well tolerated with no safety concerns, 
either locally or at the systemic level.  
The absence of studies in juvenile animals was considered acceptable given that the systemic exposure 
after ocular instillation of Verkazia was negligible and considering that the external parts of the eye are 
fully  developed  in  the  proposed  target  population  which  includes  children  from  4  years  of  age  and 
adolescents. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the CHMP was of the view that the non-clinical data were sufficient to support the application 
for a marketing authorisation of Verkazia in the treatment of severe VKC in children from 4 years of 
age and adolescents. The CHMP furthermore concluded that Verkazia was not expected to pose a risk 
to the environment 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
The applicant confirmed that the clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/505143/2017  
Page 23/77 
 
 
 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
Table 3 Tabular overview of clinical studies 
Furthermore, the applicant presented the reports of 4 clinical trials (2 Phase II and 2 Phase III studies) 
which investigated CsA 0.1% eye drops in patients with dry eye disease: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Phase IIa (N09F0502) in 53 Sjögren patients with moderate to severe dry eye disease; 
Phase IIb ORA (NVG08B112) in 132 patients with mild to moderate dry eye disease; 
Phase III SICCANOVE (NVG06C103) in 495 patients with moderate to severe dry eye disease; 
Phase III SANSIKA (NVG10E117) in 246 patients with severe dry eye disease. 
The data from these studies were considered supportive in particular with a view to the safety 
evaluation (see section 2.6. ). 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Due  to  the  ophthalmic  route  of  administration  and  the  local  site  of  action,  no  specific  clinical  PK  or 
metabolism  studies  were  conducted  in  support  of  this  application.  However,  in  order  to  evaluate  a 
possible systemic exposure to Verkazia, blood samples were collected in patients included in the Phase 
II/III  NOVATIVE  study  and  in  the  Phase  III  VEKTIS  study  (see  sections  2.5.2.  and  2.5.3.  for  a 
description of the study designs and main results) 
In VEKTIS ciclosporinaemia was measured using a specific HPLC-MS assay. The quantification method 
used was a validated bioanalytical method with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 0.1 ng/mL, a 
low limit of detection (LLOD) of 0.05 ng/mL, and an upper limit of quantification of 5 ng/mL. The other 
method used in the NOVATIVE study was an HPLC-MS assay with a LLOQ of 2 ng/mL. 
Assessment report  
EMA/505143/2017  
Page 24/77 
 
 
 
 
In  NOVATIVE,  a  blood  sample  was  collected  at  selected  centres  before  morning  instillation  of  the 
investigational  medicinal  product  at  the  Week  4  (Month1)  visit.  CsA  blood  levels  were  detectable  in 
very few treated patients: 1/10 patients treated with CsA 0.05% QID (CsA blood level of 0.13 ng/mL) 
and 4/6 patients treated with CsA 0.1% QID. The highest detectable CsA blood level was 0.33 ng/ml in 
1 patient treated with CsA 0.1% QID. 
In the VEKTIS study, blood samples for CsA levels were taken from 166 patients at baseline, Month 2, 
Month 4 and Month 12. CsA concentration data were summarised by visit using frequency distribution 
of values below the lower limit of detection and values at least equal to the LLOQ.  
For  most  of  the  VEKTIS  patients  (33/50  in  the  high  dose  group,  and  41/47  in  the  low  dose  group), 
after  4-month  treatment  no  (<LLOD)  or  negligible  (<LLOQ)  systemic  exposure  to  CsA  was  detected. 
Some patients showed quantifiable CsA at the same time point: 14/48 (29.2%) in the high dose group 
and  5/41  (12.2%) in  the  low  dose  group,  with  some  values  as  high  as  0.670  ng/ml  in  the  high  dose 
group and 0.336 ng/ml in the low dose group showing that systemic absorption of CsA did occur (LLOQ 
=  0.10  ng/ml)  although  to  a  greater  extent  in  the  high  dose  group.  The  same  pattern  was  observed 
when analysing the data separately for children and adolescents (4-11 years; and >11 years) showing 
a systemic passage of CsA in some patients and more specifically for those receiving the high dose. 
At  Month  12,  there  was  still  a  number  of  patients  (12/68  in  the  high  dose  group  vs.  5/61  in  the  low 
dose group) with quantifiable CsA in the blood, although to a lesser extent when compared to Month 4, 
suggesting that there is no accumulation with chronic administration even if a limited systemic passage 
exists. Measurable values up to a maximum of 0.291 ng/mL and 0.300 ng/mL for the high and the low 
dose group, respectively, were observed. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No  specific  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  conducted  with  Verkazia  since  an  adequate  model  of  VKC 
did  not  exist  and in  light of  the  ophthalmic  route of  administration  as  well  as  the  local  site  of  action. 
Furthermore,  CsA 
is  a  well-known  active  substance 
for  which 
the  mechanism  of 
the 
immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory actions has been well-described in the scientific literature. 
In  patients  with  VKC,  CsA,  following  ocular  administration,  is  passively  absorbed  into  T-lymphocyte 
infiltrates  in  the  cornea  and  conjunctiva  where  its  binding  to  cyclophilin  A  inactivates  calcineurin 
phosphatase.  CsA-induced 
inactivation  of  calcineurin 
inhibits  the  de-phosphorylation  of  the 
transcription  factor  NF-AT  (nuclear  factor  of  activated  T-cells)  and  prevents  NF-AT  translocation  into 
the nucleus, thus blocking the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-2 (as well as 
of other cytokines) and subsequent T-lymphocytes activation. Blocking NF-AT further interferes in the 
allergic process. 
CsA is also known to inhibit histamine release from mast cells and basophils through a reduction in IL-
5 production, and may reduce eosinophil recruitment and effects on the conjunctiva and cornea. It 
furthermore up-regulates the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. All available evidence suggests 
that CsA acts specifically and reversibly on lymphocytes. It does not depress haemopoiesis and has no 
effect on the function of phagocytic cells. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Given that there was no adequate model of VKC and since Verkazia is used locally whereby there was 
no evidence of significant systemic absorption (see below), the CHMP considered it acceptable that no 
specific clinical pharmacology studies were conducted in support of this application. The CHMP also 
took into account that CsA is a well-known immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory agent which’s 
Assessment report  
EMA/505143/2017  
Page 25/77 
 
 
 
mechanism of action has been extensively documented in the scientific literature. 
Ciclosporinaemia occurred in nearly 30% of the patients receiving CsA 0.1% QID. Quantifiable levels 
were found in 29.2% of the high dose group, and in 12.2% of the low dose group by Month 4, with 
some values as high as 0.670 ng/ml in the high dose group and 0.336ng/ml in the low dose group. 
Overall, systemic exposure was considered negligible as the observed blood levels were substantially 
lower compared to systemic CsA used for prevention of graft rejection (e.g. cmax of 750-1000 ng/ml in 
paediatric renal transplant recipients [Wigger 2003; Rodriguez 2005]). Notably, ciclosporinaemia was 
still present at Month 12 although to a lesser extent when compared to Month 4, suggesting that there 
was no accumulation with chronic administration even if a limited systemic passage through the nasal 
mucosa as a result of the eye drops being cleared from the ocular surface through the lachrymal 
draining system occurred. This information had been adequately reflected in SmPC section 5.2. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In light of the local route of administration of Verkazia and since no significant systemic exposure 
occurred, the CHMP considered that the lack of specific pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetic studies 
was acceptable. Available data from the scientific literature and blood samples collected during the 
clinical trials program were considered sufficient in order to support the application for Verkazia in the 
treatment of severe VKC in children from 4 years of age and adolescents form a clinical pharmacology 
point of view. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical programme for Verkazia included 2 Phase 3 studies: the confirmatory pivotal Phase 3 
VEKTIS study (NVG09B113) performed in severe VKC patients and the supportive Phase 2/3 
NOVATIVE study (NVG05L101) in moderate to severe VKC. 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
According to the applicant, the chosen dose regimen in NOVATIVE (one eye drop four times daily [QID] 
of CsA 0.05% and 0.1%) was derived from the literature, multiple reports and current medical 
practices using off-label, hospital-made topical CsA. 
The dose regimen of one eye drop QID and twice daily (BID) of CsA 0.1% investigated in VEKTIS was 
selected based on preclinical data, on results of previously conducted studies and on clinical practice. 
In the clinical studies published up to now, CsA up to 2% (in castor or olive oil) administered 4 times 
daily up to 6 months has shown efficacy on both signs and symptoms of VKC. At the same time, while 
no dose response relationship can be derived from the available non-clinical data, long corneal 
elimination half-life (26.21-53.25h) in rabbits suggests the need of less frequent instillations, e.g. BID. 
In addition, 4 times daily administration might be difficult in practice, e.g. for children if attending 
school despite disease severity, and might be associated with greater systemic and local safety 
concerns. Finally, results of post-hoc analyses of NOVATIVE in patients with active VKC with severe 
keratitis suggested the potential for a greater benefit of the 0.1% CsA dose over the 0.05% dose. 
Therefore, it was decided to test CsA 0.1 % BID and to compare it to 0.1 % QID in VEKTIS. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
VEKTIS (NVG09B113): Multicenter, randomized, double-masked, 3 parallel arms, placebo 
controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of NOVA22007 1 mg/mL

(ciclosporin/cyclosporine) eye drops, emulsion administered in paediatric patients with 
active severe vernal keratoconjunctivitis with severe keratitis 
Methods 
The study was divided in 2 parts: a 4-month efficacy evaluation treatment period and an 8-month 
safety follow-up period. Both study periods tested NOVA22007 (CsA 1 mg/mL) administered 2 or 4 
times daily in children or adolescents with severe VKC. The first 4-month randomized, double masked 
study treatment period was designed as a superiority study using vehicle emulsion as control. During 
the subsequent 8-month safety follow-up period, patients were allowed to continue on 1 of the 2 active 
regimens. Patients enrolled early in the study for whom the VKC allergy season was ongoing at the end 
of the 4-month efficacy evaluation period and patients who did still presented signs and symptoms of 
VKC according to the investigator judgment were allowed to continue on study treatment. Also, 
patients who experienced a recurrence of active VKC or a worsening in VKC symptoms following the 
discontinuation of study treatment outside of the VKC allergy season during the remaining months of 
their 8-month safety follow-up period were allowed to resume treatment with NOVA22007 in a masked 
fashion according to the investigator judgment.

Treatments 
Patients were instructed to instil 1 drop of study treatment into the lower conjunctival sac of each eye 
4 times daily: in the morning, at noon, in the afternoon and in the evening (with approximately 4 
hours between each instillation) and to reduce the systemic absorption a nasolacrimal occlusion 
compression of lacrimal ducts had to be applied. Study medication was provided in single-unit 
container yielding 2 drops of study medication (1 drop for instillation in each eye). Patients in the BID 
treatment arm received active treatment in the morning and evening and vehicle at noon and in the 
afternoon.  
The formulation of the vehicle control was exactly the same formulation as NOVA22007 but excluded 
the active substance. 
Patients involved in VEKTIS were allowed to use unpreserved tear substitutes up to 4 times a day only 
in case of worsening of the VKC symptoms and inability to have a visit for rescue corticosteroid 
therapy prescription.  
Rescue Therapy 
Rescue treatment consisted of dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops provided by the sponsor, 1 drop 4 
times daily for 5 days. A maximum of 2 courses of rescue between 2 scheduled visits during the 4-
month treatment period and a maximum of 4 courses of rescue between 2 scheduled visits during the 
follow-up period were allowed.  
The need for rescue medication was assessed by the investigator during a visit (or phone call for a 
second course) and rescue medication was given if the patient satisfied the following conditions: 
•  Keratitis worsening of at least one grade on the modified Oxford scale or maintained during 2 
months at the entry level, and/or 
•  Symptom worsening of at least 1 centimetre on at least 1 of the 4 symptoms along with the 
worsening of the mean of the 4 symptoms or maintenance at the entry level. 
Patients receiving rescue medication had their intraocular pressure assessed at each study visit as for 
any patient and were carefully monitored because of the risks of glaucoma as well as the occurrence of 
adverse events (AEs) with an increased risk of infections. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of 2 different dosing regimens of 
NOVA22007 versus vehicle on both the evolution of severe keratitis and the need for rescue 
medication. 
The secondary objectives were to assess the safety and tolerability including ocular tolerance of 2 
dosing regimens of NOVA22007 versus vehicle and to assess the efficacy of 2 dosing regimens of 
NOVA22007versus vehicle on other signs and symptoms of VKC not covered in the primary objective. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the penalty adjusted CFS score at 4 months, defined as the mean of 
the 4 efficacy scores taken at each monthly visit, based on: 
•  Keratitis assessed by corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) using the modified Oxford scale [7-
point ordinal scale (0, 0.5, and 1 to 5)]. 
•  Need for rescue medication. 
Assessment report  
EMA/505143/2017  
Page 29/77 
 
 
 
•  Occurrence of corneal ulceration. 
The efficacy score was calculated as follows: 
Patient’s score at month X = CFS (Baseline) – CFS (Month X) + penalty(ies). 
Penalty for rescue medication: -1 (per course, with a maximum of 2 courses between 2 scheduled 
visits). 
Penalty for corneal ulceration: -1 (per occurrence). 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
•  CFS score assessed with the modified Oxford scale at Baseline, Month 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
•  Use of rescue therapy at Month 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
•  Occurrence of ulcer Month 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
Other Efficacy Endpoints 
•  Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score at Month 1, 2, 3 and 4. The 4 main symptoms (photophobia, 
tearing, itching and mucous discharge) assessed using a 100 mm VAS, individually and globally 
(average of the 4 measures) at each visit during the 4- month efficacy evaluation treatment period. 
•  CFS Responder rate at Month 2, 3 and 4. A responder was defined as a patient (1) with a CFS score 
at Month 4 equal or smaller than 50% of the baseline CFS, (2) who did not withdraw from the study 
for a reason possibly due to treatment, (3) free from occurrence of ulceration and (4) free from use 
of rescue medication in the last 3 months of treatment. 
•  Artificial tears use at Month 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
•  Quick questionnaire at Month 1, 2, 3 and 4 (as well as Month 12). 
The QUICK questionnaire is a simple instrument, which was developed to measure health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) in children with VKC (Sacchetti 2007). It contains 16 items allocated into 2 
domains: symptoms (12 items) and impact of VKC on daily activities (4 items). Each item which 
relates to what the patient experienced in the past 2 weeks, is scored according to a 3 point scale 
where 1=never, 2=sometimes and 3=always. QUICK scores range from 0 to 100, the highest score 
indicating worse HRQoL.  
• 
Investigator Global Evaluation of Efficacy at Month 4 using the following rating scale: 3 = Very 
satisfactory, 2 = Satisfactory, 1 = Not very satisfactory, and 0 = Unsatisfactory. 
Furthermore, because some patients continued active study medication during the 8-month follow-up 
period and although not vehicle controlled, some exploratory efficacy assessments were performed 
during this period.  
Sample size 
Assuming a 1.25 grade difference in primary endpoints between active group and vehicle control and a 
standard deviation of 2 based on observations in the NOVATIVE study, and setting the two-sided alpha 
risk at 2.5% to take into account a multiplicity adjustment for the 2 tested dose regimens, a sample 
size of 50 patients per group was required to have 80% chance (power) and to show a significant 
difference between the most efficacious dose and vehicle. A provision of 12% was arbitrarily added to 
the sample size (56 patients per group) for the decrease of power linked to an early end of VKC season 
in some regions and possibly early withdrawals.

Randomisation 
A 1:1:1 allocation ratio based on a (centralised) computerized randomization scheme was used for the 
treatment assignment. Patients enrolling into the 8-month treatment follow-up period and initially 
assigned to vehicle, were switched to one of the two active study treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-masked study. Masking was achieved by providing the study medication 
(NOVA22007 and vehicle) in identical masked treatment units and by identifying each study 
medication by a treatment number. Investigators were allowed to unmask a patient in emergency 
cases only (e.g. serious adverse event). The Data Safety Monitoring Board remained masked 
throughout the study. 
Statistical methods 
The following analysis populations were considered: 
The Safety Set (SS) consisted of all patients randomized in the study for whom there was any evidence 
that they used study medication and for whom any follow-up information was available. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of randomized patients, potentially excluding few patients 
corresponding to the failure to take at least 1 dose of study medication and very early withdrawal (first 
week after randomization) definitely not related to study medication and leading to the lack of any post 
randomization data. 
The Per Protocol set (PPS) excluded FAS patients with any major protocol deviations that may have 
impacted the efficacy analysis.  
The main efficacy population was the FAS. 
Descriptive statistics are presented per treatment group. Mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, 
maximum and number of observations were used for quantitative variables, and frequencies and 
percentages for categorical variables. Regarding the efficacy variables concerning both eyes, 
descriptive statistics and statistical analyses were only done for the worst eye at inclusion. Safety 
variables recorded in both eyes were analysed for both the worst eye and the other eye separately. 
The worst eye was defined as the eligible eye with the highest Oxford score for corneal staining at 
Baseline. In case both eyes had the same score at Baseline the right eye was considered. 
Primary Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Superiority of each dosing regimen of NOVA22007 compared to vehicle was tested using a linear model 
(analysis of covariance [ANCOVA]) with 2 covariates: the treatment and the proportion of time spent in 
being exposed to the randomized treatment within the VKC season. The model was applied separately 
to the CFS, the rescue medication and ulcer components of the composite endpoint. 
The type I error was adjusted through the Hochberg’s procedure for comparing each dose versus 
vehicle. The procedure started with the largest p value compared to 0.05 followed by the smallest p-
value compared to 0.025 if the largest p-value was not significant (ascending procedure). 
The robustness of the primary result (on the FAS) was assessed using the PP population and the set of 
all randomized patients (sensu stricto). Another sensitivity analysis was based on the FAS and 
observed cases without any imputation of missing data (mean per month of available data).

Secondary Analyses of the Primary Endpoint: 
A secondary analysis of the primary endpoint was performed using a repeated measures analysis of 
variance (general linear mixed model) in order to estimate the magnitude of the treatment effect at 
each month. 
Other Secondary Efficacy Analysis: 
The change from Baseline in the modified Oxford scale value as well as in each symptom (photophobia, 
tearing, itching and mucous discharge assessed using a 100 mm VAS) was fitted by a general linear 
mixed model for repeated measurements (LMMRM). 
The rate of responders was compared with a logistic regression using the treatment and the proportion 
of time spent under treatment during the VKC season as covariates. 
The frequency distribution of the number of courses of rescue medication for each group was provided 
and each dose was compared to vehicle through a non-parametric Savage test. 
The QUICK questionnaire was analysed by a general LMMRM. The 2 domains of the scale (the 
Symptoms domain and the Daily Activities domain) were analysed separately. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 169 patients were randomized into the study. These patients were recruited in 11 countries 
and a total of 101 patients were included in Europe. 
Overall, 26 patients (15.4%) withdrew from the study. The most frequent primary reasons for 
withdrawal were lack of efficacy in 11 patients (6.5%) and patient decision unrelated to an AE in 7 
patients (4.1%). For both, the low dose group (n=5 [9.3%]) and the vehicle group (n=5 [8.6%]), 
more patients withdrew due to lack of efficacy compared to the high dose group (n=1 [1.8%]).

Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended twice. Only the second amendment was after recruitment of the first 
patient. It was a country specific amendment for Croatia to reflect national requirements for 
contraception. The statistical analysis plan was also changed including the addition of the randomised 
set (RS) for sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint, addition of a Follow-up Total Set for the 8-
month follow-up analyses. 
Baseline data 
The FAS comprised 127 children (75.6%) and 41 adolescents (24.4%). Mean age was 9.2 years 
(standard deviation [SD]: 3.3). There were more male (n=132 [78.6%]) than female patients (n=36

[21.4%]) and the majority was of Caucasian origin (n=119 [70.8%]). The characteristics of the 
individual treatment groups were comparable. 
Table 4 Demographic Characteristics (VEKTIS, FAS) 
The majority of patients (n=110 [65.5%]) had both forms of VKC (see Table 7), i.e. limbal and tarsal 
VKC. The number of patients with limbal and/or tarsal VKC was comparable in all groups except in the 
low dose active group where patients with both forms were more numerous (39/54; 72.2%) and those 
with limbal VKC less numerous (2/54; 3.7%). Seasonal VKC was found in 75 patients (44.6%) and 
perennial VKC in 93 patients (55.4%). Mean time since diagnosis was 3.4 years (SD: 2.6). Most 
patients have used previous treatment for VKC (n=133 [79.2%]). The VKC history of the individual 
treatment groups was principally comparable. 
Table 8 shows that the majority of patients had VKC Grade 3 (n=104 [61.9%]) and a CFS score of 
Grade 4 at baseline (n=145 [86.3%]). In 97 patients (57.7%), both eyes were eligible for analysis 
(see Table 8); the number of patients where only one eye was eligible was 34 patients (20.2%) with 
an eligible right eye and 35 patients (20.8%) with an eligible left eye, resulting in the analysis eye 
being the right eye in a total of 126 patients (75.0%). Baseline disease characteristics were 
comparable between the individual treatment groups except for the CFS score: with 14 patients 
(25.0%), the high dose group included more patients with CFS Grade 5 at baseline than the low dose 
or vehicle group with 5 (9.3%) and 4 patients (6.9%), respectively. Notably, 2 patients (3.4%) in the 
vehicle group did not meet the definition of eligible eye, since their mean values for the symptoms 
were below 60 (56.8 and 58.8, 51.5 and 50.8, respectively).

Table 5 History of VKC (VEKTIS, FAS) 
Table 6 Disease Severity and Eligible/Analysis Eye (VEKTIS, FAS) 
Overall, the most frequent ocular histories were corneal opacity, hypermetropia, hordeolum and 
keratoconus, all in 3 patients (1.8%). 
Prior to enrolment, most of the patients (149/169; 88.2%) had a specific treatment, and half of them 
(n=87) were having tear substitutes, corticosteroids (n=87) or other anti-allergic eye drops (n=97). 
Most frequent prior medication was olopatadine hydrochloride (34/169; 20.1%), fluorometholone 
(26/169; 15.4%) and ketotifen fumarate (25/169; 14.8%). Most frequently taken concomitant 
medications were desloratadine in 18 patients (10.7%) and salbutamol in 13 patients (7.7%). A total 
of 39.0% of the patients received concomitant treatment with antihistaminic agents. 
In all treatment groups, the majority of patients had a compliance of 80 to 100% of treatment days, 
with 51 patients (89.4%) in the high dose group, 46 patients (85.3%) in the low dose group and 54

patients (93%) in the vehicle group. Accordingly, most patients were 80 to 100% compliant calculated 
on the intake of study medication drops, with 55 patients (96.5%) in the high dose group, 54 patients 
(96.4%) in the low dose group and 56 patients (96.6%) in the vehicle group. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 169 patients were randomized into the study and were thus part of the RS; the same number 
of patients was included in the SS. The FAS consisted of 168 patients and the PPS of 159 patients. 
Notably, there was one patient initially assigned to the high dose regimen, who actually received initial 
treatment with vehicle because of incorrect study drug allocation. 
Overall, 10 patients (5.9%) had a major protocol deviation, with 5 patients (8.8%) in the high dose 
group, 3 patients (5.5%) in the low dose group and 2 patients (3.5%) in the vehicle group. The overall 
most frequent protocol deviation was poor study drug compliance reported for 4 patients (2.4%). One 
patient initially assigned to the low dose group was excluded from the FAS due to violation of a main 
inclusion criterion, i.e. CFS score of 2 instead of 4 or 5.

Outcomes and estimation 
•  Primary composite endpoint: Penalty-adjusted CFS score at Month 4 
The primary composite endpoint was the average penalties adjusted CFS score over Period I (Month 
4).  
Monthly results are displayed by treatment groups, together with the mean penalty adjusted CFS score 
over Period I (Table 10). In all treatment groups, there was over time an increase of the penalty 
adjusted CFS score. There was a greater improvement over the 4 months in the high dose group 
(2.06; SD: 1.44) as compared to the 2 other groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/505143/2017  
Page 36/77 
 
 
 
 
The difference in the least square (LS) mean versus vehicle was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.26, 1.27) for the 
high dose group and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.16, 1.18) for the low dose group. This translates into an 
improvement of the penalty adjusted CFS score by 54% in the high dose group than in vehicle and 
44% larger in the low dose group compared to vehicle. Both differences were statistically significant 
with p=0.007 for the high dose and p=0.010 for the low dose group. All sensitivity analyses for the 
comparison of active treatment vs. vehicle, included analyses for RS and PPS as well as using observed 
data for the FAS and analyses without taking unscheduled visits into account, confirmed these findings.   
Table 8 Primary efficacy endpoint – VEKTIS (FAS) 
Time course of the response  
Primary endpoint results are supported further by the analysis of the time course of the response 
during Period I (Figure 3). The time course of the response to the high dose regimen was ascending 
and parallel to that of vehicle. This suggest that the onset of action is very fast and significant, i.e. as 
early as Month 1 (p< 0.05) and the benefit over the vehicle remains quite constant over time.

Contribution of the three components of the composite endpoint to the magnitude of the treatment 
effect (secondary endpoints) 
To evaluate the contribution of the three components of the composite endpoint to the magnitude of 
the treatment effect, the primary model was applied separately to the three components: mean 
change from baseline in CFS, rescue medication and corneal ulceration. Absolute and relative 
contributions were both considered, and were expressed in percentage of the overall effect size (see 
Table 11). 
CFS score was the main driver of the magnitude of the treatment effect, together with the need for 
rescue medication, the latter to a lesser extent. However, for the mean number of ulcer occurrences 
per month, there was no statistical difference between the active groups and the control group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/505143/2017  
Page 38/77 
 
 
 
 
 
Rescue medication was used nearly two times more frequent in the vehicle group than in the active 
arms: 32.1% (18/56) of the patients in the high dose group and 31.5% (17/54) in the low dose group 
received at least one course of rescue medication compared to 53.4% (31/58) in the vehicle group. For 
all treatment groups at all time points, a large proportion of patients did not use rescue medication: 
≥67.9% in the high dose group, ≥68.5% in the low dose group and ≥46.6% in the control group. The 
proportion of months during which at least one course of rescue medication was used was comparable 
in the 2 active treatment groups, and higher in the vehicle group. Differences in the number of courses 
compared to vehicle were statistically significant in favour of the high dose group at Month 1 
(p=0.019) and Month 3 (p=0.044) and of the low dose group at Month 3 (p=0.044).

treatment effect - Observed Data - 4-Month Randomised Period (FAS) 
Note: Mean change from baseline of the mean CFS score per month = CFS score at baseline - mean of CFS score 
over 4 month, mean number of rescue medication courses per month = total number of rescue courses over 4 
month / number of visits, Mean number of ulcer occurrences per month = total number of ulcer occurrences during 
the 4 months / number of visits.

Primary treatment effect across subgroups 
Subgroup analyses were performed to check homogeneity of effect across subgroups. This was purely 
descriptive. The analysis was done on pre-specified subgroups according to baseline disease status 
(seasonal or perennial VKC) and form (limbal and/or tarsal), baseline symptoms (less or more than 80 
on VAS), sex and age (4-11; and 12-less than 18) and disease severity status (CFS grade 4 and 5). It 
was shown that both high and low dose regimens were generally favoured over vehicle in all subgroups 
and this effect was significant in at least one of the subgroups of each breakdown criterion. The Forest 
plot for the high dose regimen is shown in Figure 4.

CFS responder rate 
The highest response rate was observed in the low dose group (33/54, 61.1%), followed by the high 
dose group (32/56, 57.1%) and vehicle (20/58, 34.5%). When compared to vehicle the odds ratios 
(95% CI) were 3.486 (1.576, 7.713) and 2.583 (1.207, 5.531) for the low and the high dose group, 
respectively. The difference was statistically significant in both cases (p=0.003 and p=0.013, 
respectively).  
In line with a recommendation during a CHMP Scientific Advice, a more stringent definition of CFS 
responders was also explored to more specifically appreciate the impact of the treatment on corneal 
clearing, i.e. CFS graded 0 on the modified Oxford scale (instead of a reduction by 50% or more 
compared to baseline as per the original analysis). In this situation, a patient was defined as a 
responder if (1) he had a CFS graded 0 at Month 4, (2) he did not experience any ocular ulceration, (3) 
did not use any rescue medication in the last three months of treatment. Based on this definition, the 
greatest response rate was observed in the high dose group (19.6%) whereas the response rate was 
comparable in the low dose and control group (9.3% and 8.6%, respectively). The differences between 
active treatment and vehicle were not statistically significant with an odds ratio (95% CI) of 2.613 
(0.842, 8.100) for the comparison of the high dose group versus vehicle and an odds ratio (95% CI) of 
1.177 (0.319, 4.336) for the comparison of the low dose group versus vehicle (p=0.170 and 0.807, 
respectively). 
Data for the responder rates were later re-analysed. The original analyses only took into account 
Month 2, 3 and 4 results. The re-analysis also included Month 1. Table 12 shows the results for the 
original responder definition (i.e. reduction of the CFS score by 50% or more compared to baseline).

Symptoms assessed using VAS 
Throughout Period I, from baseline to Month 4, all VKC symptoms (i.e. photophobia, itching, tearing 
and mucous discharge) assessed based on a 100 mm VAS, improved in all 3 treatment groups. As 
shown by the LS mean values for the average of the 4 symptoms (Table 13 and Figure 5), the overall 
improvement was greatest in the high dose group (at baseline: 75.7 [SD: 11.2]; at Month 4: 26.0 
[SD: 29.8]), followed by the low dose group (baseline: 72.6 [SD: 9.3], Month 4: 36.0 [SD: 32.4]) and 
the vehicle group (baseline: 72.7 [SD: 9.5]; at Month 4: 43.4 [SD: 27.3]).

Figure 5 - VAS Average of the 4 Symptom Scores – Difference in LS Mean versus Vehicle 
(FAS) 
The average difference over vehicle across all 4 time points was 17.2 mm for the high dose group and 
13.8 mm for the low dose group. 
When comparing the 2 active treatments with vehicle, there was a statistically significant difference in 
the LS mean for the high dose group at all time points, whereas a statistically significant difference 
was only observed at Month 2 in the low dose group (p=0.006). At Month 4, the difference over 
vehicle in the high dose regimen was 2.3 higher than for the low dose regimen. For all symptoms and 
in all groups, the greatest improvement took place from baseline to Month 1. 
When considering the evolution of each of the four symptoms (photophobia, tearing, mucous discharge 
and itching), a similar pattern was observed, and with a decrease over time (see Figure 6). 
To complement the results for symptoms, the applicant performed post-hoc responder analyses as 
follows: 
•  Patients with an improvement from baseline by 50% of symptoms (average of the last three 
months), and  
•  Patients free from symptoms at Month 4. 
The responder rates for improvement of symptoms (average of the findings for the 4 symptoms) by 
50% were 27/56 (48.2%), 22/54 (40.7%), and 12/58 (20.7%) for the high dose, the low dose and 
vehicle, respectively. The odds ratios for the high and low dose compared to vehicle were 3.575 (95% 
CI: 1.569, 8.148; p=0.003) and 2.683 (95% CI: 1.151, 6.254; p=0.020).  
The responder rates for freedom of symptoms (average of the findings for the 4 symptoms) at Month 4 
were 8/56 (14.3%), 4/54 (7.4%), and 1/58 (1.7%) for the high dose, the low dose and vehicle, 
respectively. The odds ratios for the high and low dose compared to vehicle were 9.564 (95% CI: 
1.152, 79.367; p=0.017) and 5.029 (95% CI: 0.542, 46.663; p=0.110).

Use of artificial tears 
Overall, monthly usage of artificial tears, which was capped at up to 4 times a day, remained low 
throughout Period I. Highest percentages of patients with tear usage were found at Month 1 with 
4/56 patients (7.1%) in the high dose group, 5/54 patients (9.3%) in the low dose group and 11/58 
patients (19.0%) in the control group. 
Health related quality of life (Quick questionnaire) 
A decrease from baseline to Month 4 in the scores of both domains (symptoms and daily activities) of 
the Quick questionnaire was found in all treatment groups, thus indicating an improvement in patient 
quality of life (Table 14).  
During the 4-month double-masked period (Period I), a statistically significant difference over vehicle 
was found at all time points for the high dose group for both domains (symptoms and activities of daily 
life), except for daily activities at Month 1. For the low dose group, significant differences were only 
found at Month 2 (p=0.003).

Global assessment by the Investigator 
In all treatment groups, the investigator assessed the treatment as satisfactory or very satisfactory for 
the majority of patients. At Month 4, 42/49 (85.7%) patients in the high dose group, 37/43 (86.0%) 
patients in the low dose group and 33/48 (68.8%) patients in the vehicle group had a positive global 
assessment by the Investigator. Though numerical advantages for the active treatment groups exist, 
the frequency distributions did not differ statistically significant from vehicle (p=0.080 for both high 
and low dose regimens). 
Longer Term Use (exploratory efficacy assessment) 
Patients involved in Period II were divided in three different subgroups: 
•  Subgroup A: patients who stopped the treatment at Month 4 and never used it again until 
Month 12. 
•  Subgroup B: patients who did not stop their treatment at Month 4 and continued it up to Month 
12. 
•  Subgroup C: patients who used active treatment in an intermittent manner during the “on 
demand” period. 
Description of the 8-month efficacy data was limited to analyses of subgroups B and C (with Month 4 
measurements as baseline).  
During Period II, 72 patients in the high dose total group (including 22 patients originally assigned to 
vehicle) and 70 patients in the low dose total group (including 26 patients originally assigned to 
vehicle) were allowed to use treatment, as required, until the next allergic season. Only few 
withdrawals occurred: one in the high dose total group (1.4%); and 5 in the low dose total group 
(7.1%). 
Subgroup B consisted of 42 patients in the high dose group (including 13 patients originally assigned 
to vehicle) and 42 patients in the low dose group (including 17 patients originally assigned to vehicle). 
Subgroup C consisted of 26 patients in the high dose group (including 6 patients originally assigned to 
vehicle) and 23 patients in the low dose group (including 8 patients originally assigned to vehicle). 
Overall, CFS scores remained stable during Period II for subgroup B patients. Patients who switched 
from vehicle to active treatment showed an improvement after Month 4. In the high dose group, the 
mean change from baseline was -0.81 (SD: 0.90) at Month 6 and - 1.27 (SD: 1.36) at Month 12/Early 
termination for this subset of patients. In the low dose group, the trend for improvement of the CFS 
score was found as well. The change from baseline at Month 6 was greater compared to the high dose 
group with -1.17 (SD: 1.47). At Month 12/Early termination, it was smaller with -0.93 (SD: 1.71). In 
subgroup C, a slight increase of CFS score was noted after Month 8 suggesting a worsening of the 
disease. 
VAS symptom scores remained overall stable during Period II. In subgroup B, additional improvement 
was seen after Month 4, especially in patients switching from vehicle to active treatment. Overall, the 
high dose total group had an average mean change of the symptom score from baseline of -9.3 (SD: 
30.4). In the low dose total group, the symptoms showed an improvement from Month 4 to Month 6 
with a mean change of the VAS score from baseline of -10.6 (SD: 20.4), remaining stable at 
subsequent visits. 
For the group of patients who switched from vehicle in the randomized period to active treatment in 
the follow-up period, the changes from baseline indicate an improvement of the symptoms in both

follow-up treatment groups. In the high dose group, the symptoms continuously improved, with 
greatest mean change from baseline of -17.3 (SD: 28.7) at Month 12/Early termination. In the low 
dose group, a trend for improvement was found as well up to Month 8 with a mean change from 
baseline of -17.9 (SD: 20.1). 
In subgroup C, there was no improvement of symptoms for the total groups. VAS scores increased till 
the end of Period II. 
Overall use of rescue medication was low; the majority of patients (usually more than 80%) did not 
take rescue medication at all at any time point. The same trend was seen in subgroups B and C.  
The Quick questionnaire showed stable results in patients’ quality of life from baseline during the 
course of Period II for both symptoms and daily activities, overall and in subgroup B. In subgroup C, 
changes from baseline suggest a worsening in symptoms and daily activities. 
In the Investigator’s global assessment, treatment was reported being either ‘very satisfactory’ or 
‘satisfactory’ for the majority of patients, and the same trend was seen in subgroups B and C. 
Percentages of positive global assessments were high (>78%) in both treatment groups. In subgroup 
B, patients who switched from vehicle to active treatment had a higher percentage of positive 
assessments with 100% in the high dose and 85.7% (12/14) in the low dose group. Subgroup C 
showed the same trends.

Rescue treatment consisted of dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops provided by 
the sponsor, 1 drop 4 times daily for 5 days. A maximum of 2 courses of 
rescue between 2 scheduled visits during the 4-month treatment period and 
a maximum of 4 courses of rescue between 2 scheduled visits during the 
follow-up period were allowed. 
Patients involved in VEKTIS were allowed to use unpreserved tear 
substitutes up to 4 times a day only in case of worsening of the VKC 
symptoms and inability to have a visit for rescue corticosteroid therapy 
prescription. 
The analysis eye was the worst eye at inclusion. The worst eye was defined 
as the eligible eye with the highest Oxford score for corneal staining at 
Baseline. In case both eyes had the same score at Baseline the right eye 
was considered. 
Notes 
2.5.3.  Supportive study(ies) 
Study NVG05L101 (NOVATIVE): A Phase II/III, multicenter, randomised, parallel group, 
dose ranging, controlled trial of efficacy and tolerance of NOVA22007 (ciclosporin A) 0.05% 
and 0.1% ophthalmic cationic emulsion versus vehicle in patients with vernal 
keratoconjunctivitis 
The NOVATIVE study compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 2 dose regimen, NOVA22007 
0.05% QID and NOVA22007 0.1% QID with vehicle in patients with active VKC. Moderate to severe 
VKC patients were recruited into this study. To be included into the study, patients had to be at least 4 
years of age and needed to have at least in at least one (the same) eye two signs (giant papillae with 
a diameter ≥ 1 mm on the upper tarsal conjunctiva and a superficial keratitis), and two ocular 
symptoms (burning/stinging, tearing, itching, pain, sticky eyelids, foreign body sensation, mucus 
discharge, and/or photophobia, scored from 0 to 3) with at least one score >2, and an hyperaemia 
score ≥ 2. 
The study duration was 4 months overall, divided into two treatment periods: 
• 
• 
Period I was a 4-week three parallel-groups, vehicle-controlled treatment period. Patients were 
randomised on a 1:1:1 basis to one of the three treatment groups: NOVA22007 0.05%, 
NOVA22007 0.1% or vehicle one drop in both eyes four times daily.  
Period II, which followed Period I was a 3-month, two parallel group treatment period. 
Following completion of Period I all patients received NOVA22007 0.05% or 0.1%, four times 
or twice daily (depending on tolerance) in both eyes.  
Assessment report  
EMA/505143/2017  
Page 48/77 
 
 
 
 
One hundred and eighteen (118) patients were randomised. Forty (40) patients were randomised to 
receive vehicle, 39 to receive NOVA22007 0.05% and 39 to receive NOVA22007 0.1% QID. All patients 
were treated, and included in the safety analysis and in the FAS. Overall, more males (96/118; 81.4%) 
than females were recruited. The mean age was 8.5 years (range 4 to 21 years). In total, 37.3% of 
patients had clinically significant non-ophthalmic history. Of these, 16.9% had respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders, including 12.7% of patients who had asthma. In total, 14.4% of patients had an 
immune system disorder and 15.3% had skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (the NOVA22007 
0.05% group had nearly double the number of patients with allergy and skin disease compared to the 
other groups). 
At the end of Period I, 111 patients (94.1%) were still in the study and all entered Period II of the 
trial: 36 patients who received vehicle during Period I (of which 19 received NOVA22007 0.05% in 
Period II and 17 NOVA22007 0.1%), 39 patients who remained in the NOVA22007 0.05% group and 
36 remaining in the NOVA22007 0.1% group. 
The primary objective was to demonstrate superiority of NOVA22007 1 mg/mL over vehicle based on 
the effect on symptoms using a semi-quantitative scale, the BenEzra scale (BenEzra 1986). Change 
from baseline at Month 1 in the overall rating of ocular symptoms, which would have indicated an 
improvement, was used as the primary endpoint. The study did not meet its primary objective with no 
statistically significant difference being shown for either of the active arms compared to vehicle 
(p=0.2450 and p=0.2664).  
However, a significant benefit in favour of NOVA22007 was shown in secondary endpoints evaluating 
objective ocular signs of VKC under the slit lamp. At Month 1, a statistically significant improvement in 
the overall rating of objective signs of VKC for patients in the 2 active groups (p=0.04 and p=0.02 with 
NOVA22007 low dose and NOVA22007 high dose, respectively) was observed. Furthermore, both 
NOVA22007 doses provided a statistically significant improvement in CFS (p=0.003 and 0.014 for 
NOVA22007 low dose and NOVA22007 high dose, respectively) assessed using the Oxford scale. 
Results of a post-hoc analysis of the NOVATIVE study in 45 patients with active VKC and severe 
keratitis (CFS ≥ 4 on the modified Oxford scale) suggested a potential for a greater benefit with the 
0.1% dose of NOVA22007 over the 0.05% dose. At Month 1, mean improvement in CFS was greater 
with the high dose with a reduction of 2.14 compared to a reduction of 1.94 with the low dose and a 
reduction of 1.14 with the vehicle (p=0.009 and p=0.031 vs. vehicle, respectively). The effect size was 
greater for both high dose and low dose regimens compared to the entire study population (with 
moderate to severe VKC). Greater improvements over vehicle was also shown for both the 0.1% and 
the 0.05% dose for the primary efficacy endpoint, the overall rating of objective symptoms and for the 
secondary endpoints improvement in CFS and the overall rating of objective VKC signs at Month 1. 
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The assessment of the clinical efficacy of Verkazia in the treatment of VKC was mainly based on the 
results of the VEKTIS study, a randomised, double-blind, vehicle controlled trial investigating the 
efficacy and safety of CsA 0.1% eye drops BID and QID in patients with active, severe disease. 
Supportive data were available from NOVATIVE, a phase 2/3 trial in moderate to severe VKC patients. 
During the clinical development, the eye drops formulation was optimised, and the excipient 
benzalkonium chloride (BAK) was changed to cetalkonium chloride (CKC). Given that the new CKC 
containing formulation, which is proposed for commercial use, is identical to that of Ikervis (approved 
in the EU since 2015 for the treatment of severe keratitis in dry eye disease) and was used in the 
pivotal Phase 3 VEKTIS study, the change in formulations did not raise any particular concern.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Both VEKTIS and NOVATIVE studies recruited children and adolescents with VKC, whereby patients in 
VEKTIS had severe disease defined as grade 3 or 4 of Bonini scale as well as a compromised cornea 
(grade 4 or 5 on the modified Oxford scale). The choice of the patient population in the pivotal VEKTIS 
trial was based on a post-hoc subgroup analysis in NOVATIVE, which had shown more promising 
results in the subset of patients with severe keratitis compared to the entire moderate to severely 
affected NOVATIVE study population. VEKTIS was designed as a confirmatory trial to support use of 
CsA 0.1% in patients with severe disease and is therefore the focus of this section. 
Overall, the study population in VEKTIS was considered well defined and representative of the intended 
target population of Verkazia. The age range applied for was in line with the age range (4 to less than 
18 years) studied in VEKTIS. However, the CHMP noted that there are cases where the disease 
continues into adulthood. The fact that no data were available from (young) adults has been reflected 
in the SmPC of Verkazia. Furthermore, given that VKC patients with severe disease and corneal 
involvement have the highest risk for sight threatening complications and ultimately vision loss, the 
target population was agreed to be an adequate choice for treatment with an immunomodulator and in 
line with the current use of CsA eye drops in clinical practice. 
The limited study sizes with 169 patients and 118 patients in VEKTIS and NOVATIVE, respectively, 
were considered justified given the rarity of the disease. However, the small number of patients made 
the interpretation of the results difficult at times (see efficacy data below). 
Two CsA strength/doses were tested in either study. NOVATIVE compared CsA 0.1% QID and 0.05% 
QID, whereas VEKTIS included CsA 0.1% QID and 0.1% BID. The choice of the 0.1% strength in 
VEKTIS was largely based on post-hoc analyses of the NOVATIVE study data, suggesting a potential for 
a greater benefit with the 0.1% dose over the 0.05% dose in the subset of patients with severe 
disease. Vehicle was used as comparator. The use of an active comparator had been ruled out by the 
applicant since no appropriate one existed for this condition. Similarly, artificial tears, which do not 
have any pharmacological properties and are usually a background treatment in VKC, were not 
considered suitable. Rather, use of artificial tears was assessed as a secondary endpoint. 
Corticosteroids were also excluded due to their local side effects in particular when used long-term. 
Overall, the choice of CsA doses/strengths and of the control was considered acceptable; it had 
previously been discussed in a CHMP scientific advice. 
The design and conduct of the pivotal VEKTIS study was also considered acceptable, although some 
questions were raised in relation to the efficacy endpoints. In VEKTIS, efficacy was primarily assessed 
based on a composite score with a focus on signs, based on the change from baseline in 
keratitis/ocular surface damage measured as CFS and adjusted by penalties for the use of rescue 
medication and the occurrence of corneal ulcers. The lack of validation of this endpoint was ultimately 
accepted given the absence of any validated endpoints in this disease setting. However, while all 
subcomponents were agreed to be clinically relevant, progression to corneal ulcers could be expected 
to be rare given that use of rescue treatment was allowed in case of progression. In this context, the 
analyses evaluating the relative contribution of each of the subcomponents and to show consistency of 
the effect across the components were considered important. Furthermore, the choice of the penalty 
score of 1 was rather arbitrary and has not been adequately justified by the applicant. Sensitivity 
analyses modifying the weighting of the penalty were therefore requested by the CHMP during the 
course of the procedure.  
Other endpoints including responder analyses, improvement of symptoms and need for corticosteroid 
rescue treatment were generally considered useful to complete the picture of the treatment effect.

Patient characteristics were generally well balanced across the study groups in VEKTIS. As would be 
expected considering the condition, there was a preponderance of male Caucasians. The majority of 
VKC patients were children aged 4-11 years (75.6%) compared to 24.4% of adolescents, which is in 
line with the clinical presentation of the disease which usually resolves after puberty. The majority of 
patients (65.5%) had both forms of VKC, i.e. limbal and tarsal VKC. The number of patients with limbal 
disease only was somewhat lower in the low dose active group with 3.7% compared to 14.3% and 
12.1% in the high dose group and the vehicle group, respectively. However, at the same time, 
combined limbal and tarsal forms were more frequent in the high dose (72.2%) and the vehicle group 
(65.5%) compared to the low dose group (58.9%). 
VEKTIS met its primary endpoint with both the high dose CsA group (0.1% QID) and the low dose CsA 
group (0.1% BID) being superior to vehicle. Penalty adjusted CFS scores increased over the first 4 
months in both active groups to a larger extent than for vehicle (difference in the LS mean vs. vehicle 
was 0.76 and 0.67 for the high and the low dose group, respectively) and the difference was 
statistically significant (p=0.007 and p=0.010). Sensitivity analyses modifying the weighting of the 
penalty were conducted post-hoc assigning a penalty of 2 to the use of rescue medication and 1 for 
ulceration and the other way round (i.e. score of 1 assigned to rescue medication and 2 to ulceration). 
The outcome of these analyses remained in favour of CsA with a statistically significant difference to 
vehicle for both low and high dose groups. However, there were doubts on how to interpret the results 
of the primary endpoint in terms of clinical relevance. 
The CFS score was the main driver of the magnitude of the treatment effect, together with the need 
for rescue medication to a lesser extent. The CFS score accounted for 70.3% of the effect size of the 
high dose and 77.6% of the effect size of the low dose. The contribution of the number of rescue 
medication courses to the magnitude of effect was between 20% and 30% for the two active arms. For 
these two components, the treatment effect was toward the expected directions, i.e. an improvement 
in corneal health and less need of corticosteroid rescue medication with the active treatment groups 
compared to vehicle. However, no effect for the third subcomponent of the primary endpoint, corneal 
ulceration, was seen due to the rare occurrence of ulcers within the 4 months evaluation period. As 
previously mentioned, this was not unexpected given the possibility to use recue treatment in case of 
disease progression. At the same time, no conclusion on the efficacy of Vekarzia in the prevention of 
disease progression to corneal ulceration was possible. 
Subgroup analyses on the primary endpoint by gender, age (children versus adolescents), VKC 
form/type and VAS at baseline all showed at least a trend in favour of Verkazia compared to vehicle. 
However, a smaller effect size was observed for adolescents compared to children, for seasonal disease 
compared to perennial disease and for limbal disease/both forms compared to tarsal disease. However, 
the interactions were not found to be statistically significant for any of the aforementioned 
comparisons and given that generally the point estimates were in favour of active treatment and that 
some of the subgroups were small in size, which may have contributed to a chance finding, the issue 
was not further pursued. 
A benefit of Verkazia with regards to corneal health was further supported by CFS responder analyses 
showing a greater response rate in the high and low dose groups (57.1% and 61.1%) compared to 
vehicle (34.5%) at Month 4. The difference to vehicle was statistically significant for both active groups 
(p=0.013 and p=0.003). When including Month 1 into the analysis (originally omitted as it was 
hypothesised that many patients would take rescue medication during the first days of treatment and 
therefore would have been considered non-responders), the difference between active treatment and 
vehicle remained with a responder rate of 55.4%, 50.0% and 27.6% in the high dose group, low dose 
group and vehicle, respectively (p=0.005 and 0.010).  
Assessment report  
EMA/505143/2017  
Page 51/77 
 
 
 
Given the difficulties in interpreting the clinical relevance of the primary composite endpoint, the CFS 
responder analyses, in particular the one incorporating response rates at Month 1, were considered 
more relevant in order to understand the actual benefits of treatment with Verkazia. An improvement 
of the CFS score by 50% or more from baseline without the need for rescue treatment or occurrence of 
ulceration, as used for the responder definition, was considered by the CHMP to be clinically 
meaningful in the proposed target population of patients with severe VKC. The observed increase in 
the response rates with both high and low CsA dose compared to vehicle (odds ratio of 3.279 and 
2.798 for the high and low dose group, respectively) thus supported a clinically relevant treatment 
benefit of Verkazia. 
The analysis of the use of rescue medication also supported a beneficial effect of CsA 0.1% QID and 
BID. Rescue medication was used nearly twice as often by patients in the vehicle group compared to 
patients in the active arms. Overall, 32.1% (18/56) of the patients in the high dose group and 31.5% 
(17/54) in the low dose group received least one course of rescue medication compared to 53.4% 
(31/58) in the vehicle group. The difference versus vehicle in the mean number of rescue medication 
courses per months was statistically significant for the high dose group (p=0.010) and close to 
significance for the low dose group (p=0.055). 
The study also showed an improvement in subjective symptoms, as measured using a 100mm VAS 
score including 4 VKC symptoms, photophobia, tearing, itching and mucous discharge. Throughout the 
4 months evaluation period, all VKC symptoms improved from baseline irrespective of the treatment 
received. For all symptoms and in all groups, the greatest improvement took place from baseline to 
Month 1. The overall improvement was greatest in the high dose group. When comparing the 2 active 
treatments with vehicle, the difference in the LS mean change of the average symptom score was -
19.4mm (p<0.001) and -8.4mm (p=0.103) for the high dose and the low dose regimen. The results by 
symptom were consistent with the overall symptom score showing a greater improvement for each of 
the individual symptom scores with active treatment compared to vehicle. The effect size at Month 4 
for each of the symptoms and overall was generally within the range of 8-10mm for the low dose and 
14-20mm for the high dose, which was accepted by the CHMP as clinically relevant. Post-hoc symptom 
responder analysis (improvement from baseline by 50% or total freedom of symptoms) provided 
consistent findings supportive of a beneficial effect of Verkazia. 
An at least numerically favourable effect of CsA over vehicle was also observed with regards to the use 
of artificial tears (although the use of these was capped at up to 4 times a day and remained low 
throughout the study), as well as for the global assessment by the investigator, albeit most of the 
between-group comparisons were not statistically significant.  
Quality of life improved from baseline in all treatment groups both with regards to symptoms and daily 
activities and a greater improvement was observed for active treatment compared to vehicle with the 
largest effect achieved in the high dose group (statistically significant at almost all time points for both 
domains).  
Long-term data gathered during the 8 months follow-up period of the study suggested maintenance of 
the treatment effect in patients who continued active treatment after the initial 4 months evaluation 
period. Of the 169 patients randomized into VEKTIS, 142 continued into the follow-up period. These 
were patients who enrolled early in the study and for whom the VKC allergy season was still ongoing 
as well as patients who still presented signs and symptoms of VKC according to the investigator’s 
judgment. Furthermore, patients who experienced a recurrence of active VKC or a worsening in VKC 
symptoms following the discontinuation of study treatment outside of the VKC allergy season during 
the remaining time in the 8-month follow-up period were allowed to resume active treatment. Overall, 
82/142 patients did not stop their treatment at Month 4 and continued it up to Month 12.  
Assessment report  
EMA/505143/2017  
Page 52/77 
 
 
 
Based on the data from the long-term follow-up period, it was agreed that Verkazia could be taken 
during the VKC season and that treatment may be continued if signs and symptoms of VKC persist 
after the end of the season. Further clarification was provided that if signs and symptoms resolve, 
treatment can be discontinued and reinitiated upon reoccurrence.  The fact that there was no 
experience with continuous use of Verkazia for a period longer than 12 months was also reflected in 
the SmPC. 
Overall, the results of VEKTIS were consistently in favour of CsA 0.1% across the various efficacy 
endpoints (the only exception being progress to corneal ulcers), although statistical significance was 
not always reached. Therefore, the study results in their totality were considered supportive of a 
clinically meaningful beneficial effect of Verkazia in the target population of patients with severe VKC. 
Beneficial effects were seen with both the high dose (4 drops a day) and the low dose (2 drops a day) 
CsA treatment regimen. When comparing the two regimens, QID dosing had a numerically better 
outcome with regards to symptomatic improvement, whereas a slightly greater effect in terms of CFS 
responder rate (excluding Month 1) and need for rescue treatment was observed for BID dosing. In 
this context, the CHMP noted that QID administration may be difficult to realise, in particular for 
children going to the nursery or school. In VEKTIS, noon and afternoon administrations were 
performed by parents who went to school or by a school nurse, and compliance was high. However, in 
real-life this may constitute a challenge for many parents/schools and may be difficult to maintain over 
prolonged periods. A less frequent instillation (morning and evening only) would be expected to be 
more convenient and increase compliance.  
Altogether, given the seasonal increase in signs and symptoms of the condition a recommendation for 
QID dosing during VKC season was considered acceptable. Thereafter (at the end of the season), 
patients will have the option to continue treatment at a reduced (BID) dose, once adequate control of 
signs and symptoms is achieved. This is in line with the expectation of a reduction in disease severity 
when the hot season is declining. It is furthermore recommended that Verkazia should be discontinued 
after signs and symptoms are resolved, and reinitiated upon their recurrence. 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the CHMP was of the view that the available clinical efficacy data were adequate to support the 
present application. In light of the consistent improvements observed with CsA 0.1% in VEKTIS across 
a number of outcome measures including both VKC signs (most notable CFS responders) and 
symptoms, the CHMP considered that a clinically relevant benefit of Verkazia had been demonstrated 
in the treatment of severe VKC in children from 4 years of age and adolescents.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The review of the safety of Verkazia includes data from two clinical trials performed in patients with 
VKC. The pivotal Phase 3 VEKTIS study included patients with severe VKC and investigated 2 doses of 
CsA 0.1% (QID and BID). The Phase 2/3 NOVATIVE study included patients with generally milder 
disease although some of them (45/118) also had severe VKC. This study investigated CsA 0.05% and 
0.1%, both QID. 
For a summary of the study design and methods, see sections 2.5.2. and 2.5.3.  
Safety  data  were  pooled  based  on  the  safety  populations  of  each  of  the  individual  studies;  i.e. 
randomised patients who took at least one dose (2 or 4 drop per day) of CsA. Data were pooled into 
two different analysis cohorts. 
Assessment report

• 
• 
The ‘Double masked study cohort’ (n=287) including patients from the double masked period 
of the VEKTIS study (4-month period) and NOVATIVE study (1-month period) in order to allow 
a comparison of the safety of Verkazia versus vehicle.  
The ‘All Periods cohort’ (n=273) including all patients who received NOVA22007 in VEKTIS or 
NOVATIVE at any point in time during the study including both evaluation and follow-up 
periods. 
Therefore the safety database includes all patients who received at least one dose of CsA at any time 
during the 2 studies, and provides for the assessment of long-term safety. 
In addition, two dose groups were identified: 
- The high dose group includes patients from NOVATIVE and VEKTIS who received CsA 0.1% QID; 
- The low dose group includes NOVATIVE patients who received CsA 0.05% QID and VEKTIS patients 
who received CsA 0.1% BID. 
Safety evaluations consisted of reports of (ocular and systemic) adverse events (AEs), serious adverse 
events (SAEs), deaths, laboratory data including ciclosporinaemia, vital signs and ocular and external 
ocular examination (Best Corrected Distance Visual Acuity [BCDVA], IOP). Special safety topics 
included safety events possibly related to Verkazia, CsA systemic absorption and off label use. 
Causality, intensity, seriousness, and outcome assessment were performed by the investigator for all 
AEs. AEs judged as possibly or probably related to the study drug were considered related to the 
treatment. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were considered any AEs that occurred or 
worsened after treatment had started. TEAEs were summarised by system organ class (SOC), and 
Preferred term (PT) based on Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 19.0. 
In addition, the applicant made reference to Ikervis which consists of the same eye drop formulation 
and is approved for the treatment of severe keratitis in adult patients with dry eye disease. Clinical 
data from studies in patients with dry eye disease as well as the available post-marketing experience 
were provided, including the clinical trials (mainly the 2 Phase III studies SICCANOVE and SANSIKA) 
which formed the basis for approval of Ikervis in the EU in 2015 and comprised more than 
700 patients. Notably, while Verkazia is a duplicate of Ikervis, the proposed dose regimen differs (2-4 
times a day with Verkazia versus once a day with Ikervis) and the target populations deviate in age 
and diagnosis.   
Patient exposure  
In the combined VEKTIS and NOVATIVE studies, a total of 189 patients with VKC were treated with 
CsA of which 84 patients were treated with CsA 0.1% 4 drops/eye/day (QID) for at least 4 months. Of 
these, 49 patients completed the follow up period in VEKTIS (i.e. 12 months study period). A total of 
44 patients received CsA 0.1% 2 drops/eye/day (BID) and completed the 4 months study period 
(Table 16).

Table 14 Safety Database for Verkazia (all doses) 
Notably, Table 16 does not reflect the 48 patients in VEKTIS initially assigned to vehicle who, after 
completion of the 4-months evaluation phase, received either CsA 0.1% QID (22) or BID (26). In 
addition, in NOVATIVE, all vehicle patients who completed the 1-month evlauation period were 
assigned to one of the active treatment groups including 19 patients receiving CsA 0.05% QID and 17 
patients receiving CsA 0.1% QID. 
The mean exposure to Verkazia 0.1% QID and vehicle during the Double-Masked period (up to 4 
months) was 76.0 days ± 43.3 and 74.1± 43.9 days, respectively. The mean exposure to Verkazia 
0.1% QID in the All Periods cohort was 195.8 ± 116.6 days. Around 31% (n= 42/135) of patients were 
exposed to Verkazia 0.1% QID for more than 44 weeks (see Table 17 and Table 18).

Adverse events 
In the Double Masked Cohort 
A total of 105 (36.9%) patients reported TEAEs. Across the treatment groups, the percentages of 
patients with a TEAE were similar with 37.5% (36/96) for the high dose group, 34.4% (32/93) for the 
low dose group and 37.8% (37/98) for the vehicle group. The percentage of patients with a drug 
related TEAE was 21.9% (21/96) for the high dose regimen, 17.2% (16/93) for the low dose regimen 
and 17.3% (17/98) for the vehicle group (see Table 19). 
Table 17 Overview of AEs (Double-Masked Cohort) 
The most common TEAEs occurred mainly in the two following MedDRA SOCs: ‘Eye disorders’ and 
‘General disorders and administration site conditions’. The observed proportion of ‘Eye disorders’ TEAEs 
was higher in the high dose group (17/96; 17.7%) and in the vehicle group (18/98; 18.4%) as

compared to the low dose group (6/93; 6.5%). The proportion of ‘General disorders and administration 
site conditions’ TEAEs was higher in the low dose group (18/93; 19.4%) and in the high dose group 
(14/96; 14.6%) as compared to the vehicle group (8/98; 8.2%).

Ocular TEAEs were reported in similar proportions of patients in the 3 treatment groups, with 29.2% in 
the high dose group, 24.7% in the low dose group and 26.5% with vehicle. Ocular TEAEs were 
considered to be treatment related in a higher proportion of patients (20.8%) treated with the high 
dose regimen, than in those receiving the low dose (17.2%) or vehicle (14.3%).  
Systemic TEAEs were reported in a similar proportion in the 3 treatment groups (14.6% [14/96], 
15.1% [14/93] and 15.3% [15/98], for the CsA high dose regimen, low dose regimen and vehicle, 
respectively). Of these, only 2.1% (n=2/96) were considered drug related in the high dose group and 
3.1% (n=3/98) with vehicle. No systemic drug-related TEAEs were reported in the low dose group. In 
the high dose group, the AEs considered related to treatment were headache and cough in 1 patient 
and rhinorrhoea in 1 patient (1% each). No serious drug related systemic TEAE was reported. 
The most frequent AEs observed were instillation site pain [9 (9.4%) cases in the high dose group, 7 
(7.5%) cases in the low dose group, and 4 (4.1%) cases in the vehicle group], instillation site pruritus 
[6 (6.3%) cases in the high dose group, 7 (7.5%) cases in the low dose group, and 3 (3.1%) cases in 
the vehicle group] and ulcerative keratitis [4 (4.2%) cases in the high dose group, 3 (3.2%) cases in 
the low dose group, and 6 (6.1%) cases in the vehicle group]. 
Drug related TEAEs were mainly ocular AEs. The most frequently reported TEAEs assessed by the 
investigator as having at least a possible relationship to treatment were instillation site pain (9 [9.4%], 
7 [7.5%] and 4 [4.1%] in the high dose, in the low dose and in the vehicle groups, respectively) and 
instillation site pruritus (5 [5.2%], 7 [7.5%] and 3 [3.1%] in the high dose, in the low dose and in the 
vehicle groups, respectively). Ulcerative keratitis was considered drug-related in 2 cases (3.0%) in the 
vehicle group.

In the All Periods Cohort 
A total of 122 (44.7%) patients had a TEAE. Across the treatment group, the percentage of patients 
with a drug related TEAE was 23.0% (31/135) with the high dose regimen and 21.7% (30/138) with 
the low dose regimen.  
The most common TEAEs experienced by patients occurred mainly in the two following MedDRA SOCs: 
‘Eye disorders’ and ‘General disorders and administration site conditions’. The observed proportion of 
‘Eye disorders’ was higher in the high dose group (26/135; 19.3%) as compared to the low dose group 
(16/138; 11.6%). The proportion of ‘General disorders and administration site conditions’ was higher 
in the low dose group (29/138; 21.0%) as compared to the high dose group (24/135; 17.8%). 
Ocular TEAEs were reported in a similar proportion of patients treated with the high dose (44/135; 
32.6%) and the low dose (43/138; 31.2%). Ocular TEAEs were considered to be treatment related in 
22.2% (30/135) of patients treated with the high dose and 21.7% (30/138) in the low dose group. The 
most frequently reported ocular TEAEs assessed by the investigator as having at least a possible 
relationship to treatment were instillation site pain [15 (11.1%) cases in the high dose group, and 11 
(8.0%) cases in the low dose group], instillation site pruritus [7 (5.2%) cases in the high dose group, 
and 11 (8.0%) cases in the low dose group], ocular hyperaemia [3 (2.2%) cases in the high dose 
group, and 2 (1.4%) cases in the low dose group] and visual acuity decreased [3 (2.2%) cases in the 
high dose group, and 1 (0.7%) cases in the low dose group]. Ulcerative keratitis was reported for 4 
(3.0%) and 5 (3.6%) patients in the high dose and the low dose groups, respectively, but was only 
considered drug-related in 1 case (0.7%) in the low dose group. Furthermore, the following TEAEs 
were considered drug-related in at least one case in an active treatment arm: eye irritation (1 case 
each in the active groups), Instillation site foreign body sensation (1 case in the low dosed group) and 
Instillation site lacrimation (1 case each in the active groups). 
Ocular infections were reported in 3 cases. Two cases (one of conjunctivitis viral and one of folliculitis) 
occurred with the high dose regimen, which were moderate in intensity, and one mild case of 
hordeolum with the low dose regimen was reported. They were all considered not related to study 
medication by the investigators. 
Systemic TEAEs were reported in a similar proportion in the treatment groups (23.0% [31/135] and 
18.8% [26/138] for the high dose and the low dose groups, respectively). Only 2 cases, all in the high 
dose regimen (1.5%), were considered drug related. There were only 2 drug related systemic TEAEs: 
One case of headache (0.7%) and one case of rhinorrhoea (0.7%), both reported in the high dose 
group. No serious drug related systemic TEAE was reported. 
Studies in adult patients with dry eye disease 
The safety for of CsA eye drops in the treatment of adult patients with dry eye disease has previously 
been  reviewed during  the initial  marketing  authorisation  application  for  Ikervis,  including  pooled  data 
analysis  such  as  the  All  Studies  Cohort  (n=  520)  combining  data  from  the  2 phase  III  studies  (396 
patients)  including  (i)  the  6 month  open  label  safety  follow  up,  where  all  patients  from  the  vehicle 
group (79 patients) received CsA 0.1%, 1 drop once daily and (ii) a Phase IIb study(ORA), taking into 
account only patients (45 patients) exposed to CsA 0.1%, 1 drop once daily.  
Assessment report  
EMA/505143/2017  
Page 61/77 
 
 
 
The most frequently reported ocular TEAEs assessed by the investigator as having at least a possible 
relationship to CsA treatment in the All Study Cohort were instillation site pain (16%), instillation site 
irritation (9%), eye irritation (8.8%), eye pain (3.5%), instillation site lacrimation (2.9%), lacrimation 
increased  (2.1%),  instillation  site  erythema  (1.9%),  ocular  hyperaemia  (1.9%),  conjunctival 
hyperaemia  (1.7%),  erythema  of  eyelid  (1.7%),  eyelid  oedema  (1.3%),  and  vision  blurred  (1.2%). 
Uncommon  ocular  TEAEs  for  which  a  relationship  to  Ikervis  could  not  be  excluded  were  keratitis 
bacterial,  herpes  zoster  ophthalmic,  conjunctival  oedema,  lacrimal  disorder,  eye  discharge,  eye 
pruritus,  conjunctival  irritation,  conjunctivitis,  foreign  body  sensation  in  eyes,  deposit  eye,  keratitis, 
blepharitis,  corneal  decompensation,  chalazion,  corneal  infiltrates,  corneal  scar,  eyelid  pruritus,  and 
iridocyclitis  as  well  as  instillation  site  reaction, instillation  site  discomfort, instillation  site  pruritus  and 
instillation site foreign body sensation. 
Of these, the following adverse reactions which did not occur in VKC paediatric patients were judged to 
potentially also be relevant for the latter population: 
- vision blurred, erythema of eyelid, and eyelid oedema (common); 
- conjunctival oedema, keratitis bacterial, herpes zoster ophthalmic (uncommon). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No death was reported during the development programme for Verkazia. 
In the Double Masked Cohort, 2 patients (2.1%) reported a SAE in high dose group (ulcerative keratitis 
and tibia fracture), 1 in the low dose group (head injury), and none in the vehicle group. All these 
SAEs were judged not drug related. 
In the All Periods Cohort, 3 patients (2.2%) reported a SAE in the high dose group (ulcerative keratitis, 
tibia fracture and phimosis), and 2 (2.9%) in low dose group (head injury and asthma). These SAEs 
were judged not drug related. 
Laboratory findings 
Ciclosporinaemia 
CsA blood concentrations were measures in both the NOVATIVE and the VEKTIS study (see section 
2.4.2. for details). For most patients, no or negligible systemic exposure was detected. In VEKTIS 
(which provided the largest blood sampling) 14/48 (29.2%) patients in the high dose group (CsA 0.1 
QID) and 5/41 (12.2%) patients in the low dose group (CsA 0.1% BID) had quantifiable CsA blood 
levels at Month 4 with values up to 0.670 ng/ml in the high dose group and 0.336 ng/ml in the low 
dose group. The same pattern was observed when analysing the data separately for children and 
adolescents (from 4-11; and above 11) showing a systemic passage of CsA in some patients and more 
specifically for those receiving the high dose. At Month 12, there was still a number of patients (12/68 
in the high dose group vs. 5/61 in the low dose group) with quantifiable CsA in the blood, although to 
a lesser extent when compared to Month 4, but no accumulation occurred.  
Transaminases (ALT, AST) and Creatinine 
In VEKTIS, overall, there were no clinically relevant changes in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate 
aminotransferase or creatinine over the 4-month randomised period or the 8-month follow-up period in 
either treatment group. There was no difference between children and adolescents. 
Assessment report  
EMA/505143/2017  
Page 62/77 
 
 
 
In NOVATIVE, the majority of laboratory values were within the normal ranges. In very few instances, 
out of range values were recorded in all treatment groups. However, none of these values were judged 
clinically relevant. No trends were observed. 
Vital signs 
Vital signs were only recorded in VEKTIS. Overall, there were no clinically relevant changes in blood 
pressure (systolic, diastolic), pulse rate or respiratory rate over the 4-month randomised period or the 
8-month follow-up period in either treatment group. There was no difference between the child and 
adolescent age group. 
Best Corrected Distance Visual Acuity (BCDVA) 
In VEKTIS, during the 4-Month Randomised Period measurement of BCDVA showed an improvement 
over the 4-month randomised period in all treatment groups, most prominent in the high dose group 
with a mean change from baseline to Month 4/Early termination of -0.135 (SD: 0.220), followed by the 
low dose (-0.091 [SD: 0.257]) and vehicle group (-0.097 [SD: 0.210]). 
In NOVATIVE, mean BCDVA values were similar for all treatment groups at Baseline and at all 
subsequent time points. 
Measurement of IOP 
In VEKTIS, during the 4-Month randomised period stable IOP was noted for all treatment groups with a 
mean change from baseline to Month 4/Early termination of -0.4 mmHg (SD: 2.7) in the high dose 
group, -0.2 mmHg (SD: 2.4) in the low dose group, and 0.1 mmHg (SD: 2.4) in the vehicle group. 
Similarly during the follow-up period, IOP remained overall stable with mean changes from baseline 
(Month 4) to Month 12/Early termination of 0.3 mmHg (SD: 2.1) in the high dose total group and 0.0 
mmHg (SD: 2.5) in the low dose total group. 
Safety in special populations 
Based on the available clinical data, there was no evidence of any intrinsic factor e.g. age, sex, race 
affecting the safety of Verkazia.  
Comparative safety analyses by age groups (4-7 years, 8-11 years, 12-17 years) showed a trend for 
an increase in the incidence rate of TEAEs in the youngest age group compared to older paediatric 
patients. However, no firm conclusions could be drawn for the impact of age on the occurrence of 
TEAEs (ocular and/or non-ocular), nor their severity of impact on treatment (dis-)continuation due to 
the size of the study. 
No specific evaluation of extrinsic factors was conducted in the development program for Verkazia. 
Studies in animals conducted with systemic CsA have shown reproductive toxicity at high dosages. The 
potential risk for humans is unknown. No clinical study has been conducted in pregnant or lactating 
women in support of this application. The clinical studies conducted with Verkazia excluded patients at 
risk of pregnancy, and patients who were pregnant or breast-feeding and there were no known 
pregnancies in the clinical studies. One pregnancy case was reported during the compassionate use of 
Ikervis in France, with no safety issue reported during the follow up of the pregnancy or at the 
delivery. The new-born did not experience any AE. Also, one breastfeeding case was reported since the 
authorisation of Ikervis in March 2015, and the child did not experience any adverse event.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific studies of potential drug interactions were performed given the local route of administration 
and low systemic exposure to CsA observed. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. The CHMP 
furthermore welcomed that the applicant is already conducting a non-clinical drug-drug interaction 
study to further explore the interaction potential of CsA eye drops at the transporter level as well as at 
the cellular level.  
Co administration of CsA 0.1% with corticosteroids occurred during the VEKTIS study [high dose 
(32.1%) and low dose (31.5%)] with no safety issues arising. 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
In the Double Masked Cohort, in total 15 (5.2%) patients discontinued from the study during the 
double masked period due to an AE and 8 (2.8%) of these patients discontinued for a drug related 
TEAE. Of these 8 patients, 3 (3.1%) patients discontinued due to a drug related AE in the high dose 
group. The incidence was slightly higher in the vehicle group (5; 5.1%). Most of these AEs were ocular 
AEs (ulcerative keratitis, allergic keratitis, eye irritation, eye pain, lacrimation, visual acuity reduced). 
In the All Periods Cohort, 11/371 (4.0%) patients discontinued due to a TEAE and seven (2.5%) 
patients discontinued due to a drug related TEAE. Most of these AEs were ocular AE. 
Post marketing experience 
Post-marketing  data  were  presented  for  Ikervis,  which  was  authorised  in  the  EU  via  Commission 
Decision  in  March  2015.  Since  the  beginning  of  the  marketing  of  Ikervis  (i.e.,  8  June  2015)  until  30 
September  2016,  a  total  of  73,322  monthly  doses  have  been  sold.  The  cumulative  patient  exposure 
from post-marketing experience was estimated at 6,110 patient years. One hundred and seven (107) 
non-serious  Adverse  Drug  Reactions  (ADRs)  related  to  Ikervis  were  derived  from  spontaneous 
reporting sources. Seventy (70) ADRs were under the SOC of  Eye disorders, eye irritation (16) being 
the most frequent event followed by eye pain (12) and ocular hypaeremia (10). A total of 24 serious 
ADRs  occurred  (aspergillus  infection,  atypical  mycobacterial  infection,  cytomegalovirus  infection, 
pneumonia,  malignant  neoplasm  of  conjunctiva  (2),  condition  aggravated  (2),  basal  cell  carcinoma, 
dizziness (2), headache, eye irritation, vision blurred, photophobia, ulcerative keratitis, cardiac flutter, 
hypertensive  crisis,  peripheral  coldness,  obliterative  bronchiolitis,  pneumothorax,  lip  swelling,  renal 
impairment and chest pain). 
Since Ikervis launch in France, two valid and two invalid cases with MedDRA PTs ‘malignant neoplasm 
of  conjunctiva’  and  ‘condition  aggravated’  relating  to  squamous  carcinoma  conjunctival  have  been 
spontaneously  reported.  All  reports  were  received  from  a  single  source  and  are  related.  The  reports 
were lacking sufficient information for a full medical assessment.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The main basis for the safety evaluation of Verkazia was the pooled data from the 2 Phase 3 trials 
VEKTIS and NOVATIVE. Together, these 2 studies contributed data from 189 VKC patients who 
received treatment with CsA 0.1%. Two safety cohorts were used, the ‘Double masked study cohort’ 
including all patients from the double masked period of the VEKTIS and NOVATIVE study (i.e. up to 4 
months) and the ‘All Periods cohort’ including all patients who received CsA 0.1% in VEKTIS or 
NOVATIVE at any point in time including the follow-up periods (i.e up to 12 months). These two 
cohorts included data from 84 and 49 patients, respectively, who received CsA 0.1% QID for at least 
4 and 12 months. Furthermore, supportive data were available from previous experience of the use of 
CsA 0.1% (Ikervis) in adult patients with dry eye disease.  
Overall, the applicant’s approach for the safety evaluation was considered acceptable.  
Due to the rarity of the disease, the safety database in the target population was limited in size. The 
small number of exposed VKC patients, in particular those receiving CsA at the strength and dose 
intended for commercial use (0.1% QID) precluded realistic frequency estimations and the detection of 
rare events. Nevertheless, the data from VEKTIS and NOVATIVE suggested that Verkazia has generally 
been well tolerated. Only very few SAEs were reported (5 cases) in patients receiving CsA eye drops 
and all cases were judged unrelated to treatment. Only 3 patients receiving CsA discontinued due to a 
drug related AE (all in the 0.1% QID group). In fact, more patients in the vehicle arm (5) discontinued 
for this reason. 
The most common TEAEs reported were ocular and belonged to the MedDRA SOCs General disorders 
and administration site conditions and Eye disorders. Within these SOCs, reports for instillation site 
reactions were considered synonymous to eye reactions. When grouping related terms together, the 
most common adverse reactions observed in the clinical development program were eye pain (11%) 
and eye pruritus (9%) which were usually transitory and occurred during instillation.  
Similarly, TEAEs judged to be at least possibly related to treatment were mainly ocular AEs. In the 
Double masked cohort, ocular TEAEs were considered to be treatment related in a higher proportion of 
patients (20.8%) treated with the high dose regimen, than in those receiving the low dose (17.2%) or 
vehicle (14.3%). In the All Periods cohort, which included data up to 12 months, ocular TEAEs were 
considered to be treatment related in 22.2% of patients treated with CsA 0.1% QID and 21.7% in the 
CsA 0.1% BID group. The most frequently reported ocular TEAEs assessed by the investigator as 
having at least a possible relationship to treatment were instillation site pain with 15 (11.1%) cases in 
the high dose group, and 11 (8.0%) cases in the low dose group, instillation site pruritus  with 7 
(5.2%) cases in the high dose group, and 11 (8.0%) cases in the low dose group, and ocular 
hyperaemia with 3 (2.2%) cases in the high dose group, and 2 (1.4%) cases in the low dose group. 
Furthermore, the following TEAEs were considered drug-related in at least one case in an active 
treatment arm: eye irritation (1 case each in the active groups), instillation site foreign body sensation 
(1 case in the low dosed group) and instillation site lacrimation (1 case each in the active groups). 
For eye/instillation site pain and eye/instillation site pruritus, reporting rates were higher with active 
treatment compared to vehicle (Double Blind Cohort): 9/96 (9.4%), 7/93 (7.5%), and 4/98 (4.1%) of 
the patients in the CsA 0.1% high dose regimen, CsA 0.1% low dose regimen and vehicle group, 
respectively, reported instillation site pain and 6/96 (6.3%), 7/93 (7.5%), and 3/98 (3.1%) of the 
patients in the CsA 0.1% high dose regimen, CsA 0.1% low dose regimen and vehicle group, 
respectively, reported instillation site pruritus. 
Furthermore, blepharitis was reported in 2 cases in the high dose group and ocular discomfort was 
observed in 4 cases with CsA treatment (3 cases in the high dose group and 1 case in the low dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/505143/2017

group) in the All Exposed cohort. No such cases were reported with vehicle. While both types of events 
may be related to the underlying disease, the CHMP was of the view that a causal relation to CsA could 
not be excluded. 
No relevant differences were apparent between the high and the low dose groups with regards to 
safety. In the All Periods cohort, in both groups, a similar percentage of patients reported drug related 
TEAEs (23.0% in the high dose group and 21.7% in the low dose group) and ocular TEAEs (32.6% in 
the high dose group and 31.2% in the low dose group). 
Given the immunosuppressive properties of CsA, there is a risk of local adverse effects such as 
infections or malignancies in particular when using CsA eye drops over prolonged periods of time as 
could be the case in VKC patients. Overall, 3 cases of ocular infections were observed during the 
clinical trials programme of Verkazia. Two moderate cases (one of conjunctivitis viral and one of 
folliculitis) occurred with the high dose regimen, and one mild case of hordeolum with the low dose 
regimen was reported. All of these cases were considered unrelated to treatment. No cases of peri-
ocular skin cancer, conjunctival or corneal neoplasia were observed in VEKTIS or NOVATIVE. However, 
few cases of malignancies (conjunctival carcinoma) have been reported for Ikervis in the post-
marketing setting, although they lacked sufficient information to allow a full medical assessment. 
Peri-ocular skin cancer, conjunctival or corneal neoplasia as well as development and exacerbation of 
ocular and peri-ocular infections are considered important potential risks in the RMP of Verkazia. A 
warning statement was included in SmPC section 4.4 advising regular monitoring of the eye when 
Verkazia is used long term. The SmPC also advises that Verkazia should not be used in patients with 
active or suspected ocular or peri-ocular infection and that concomitant use of corticosteroid eye drops 
may potentiate the immunosuppressive effect. Together, these measures were considered sufficient to 
mitigate the potential risks related to a reduced local immune response. Finally, to further evaluate the 
potential risk of periocular skin cancer, conjunctival or corneal neoplasia in the paediatric population, a 
case control study linked to existing cancer registries is foreseen (category 3 in the RMP) depending on 
the outcome of a feasibility study to understand the data sources and analytic methods available to 
quantify these risks in the target population. Furthermore, a targeted follow-up questionnaire will be 
used to collect data systemically on all reports of cases of periocular skin cancer, conjunctival or 
corneal neoplasia. 
Ocular AEs identified during the clinical development of Verkazia were broadly consistent with the 
safety profile of Ikervis which consists of the same eye drop formulation and is approved for use in 
adult patients with dry eye disease and severe keratitis, 1 drop a day in the evening. The safety 
database for patients with dry eye disease was much larger compared to the one of Verkazia in VKC 
patients and some of the adverse reactions identified herein were considered to be also relevant for 
VKC including vision blurred, erythema of eyelid, and eyelid oedema (common) as well as conjunctival 
oedema, keratitis bacterial, and herpes zoster ophthalmic (uncommon). 
Systemic TEAEs were reported in a similar proportion in the 3 treatment groups. Two patients 
receiving CsA 0.1% QID has systemic TEAEs considered treatment related, including one patient 
reporting headache and cough. Overall, both of these TEAEs were reported more frequently with active 
treatment than with vehicle.

Furthermore, reports of upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, 
laryngitis, rhinitis, oropharyngeal pain and rhinorrhoea were received. When summarising these events 
under a joint term of upper respiratory tract infection, the incidence rate was slightly higher in the CsA 
groups (5.8%) compared to the vehicle group (3.1%) at Month 4. A causal relation to CsA could not be 
ruled out based on its immunosuppressive action and the fact that it is absorbed after instillation 
through the nasolacrimal duct (albeit without resulting in significant systemic exposure). Therefore, 
upper respiratory tract infection was included as a common adverse reaction in SmPC section 4.8. 
Ciclosporinaemia occurred in nearly 30% of the patients receiving CsA 0.1% QID (see 2.4.2. for 
details). This was however not considered to represent a safety concern as the observed blood levels 
were substantially lower compared to CsA levels reached in case of systemic immunosuppression. 
No interaction studies have been performed with Verkazia. Co administration of CsA 0.1% with 
corticosteroids occurred during the VEKTIS study [high dose (32.1%) and low dose (31.5%)] with no 
specific safety issues arising. 
Furthermore, use in pregnant and breast-feeding women was not studied. Reports on one pregnancy 
case and one case of use of Ikervis during breastfeeding revealed no adverse effects. However, studies 
in animals with systemic CsA have shown reproductive toxicity at high dosages. Therefore, despite the 
low systemic exposure at therapeutic doses, Verkazia is not recommended in women of childbearing 
potential not using effective contraception and use during pregnancy and in lactating women is only 
recommended if the benefits outweigh the risks. Use in pregnant or lactating women is furthermore 
considered missing information in the RMP and will be monitored post-approval.  
Since younger children could be more sensitive to adverse effects of CsA eye drops compared to older 
ones, the applicant presented comparative safety data for different age groups (4-7, 8-11, 12-17 years 
old). While there was a trend toward an increase of patients experiencing TEAEs in the youngest age 
group for the high dose regimen, the small sample size did not allow drawing form conclusions on the 
impact of age on TEAE occurrence, severity, frequency and treatment discontinuation. 
The CHMP also noted that patients wearing contact lenses have not been studied. Therefore, the use of 
Verkazia with contact lenses is not recommended.  
Finally, given that only few patient data were available for an exposure to CsA 0.1% QID up to 12 
months, long-term safety was considered missing information in the RMP. Further data are expected to 
be collected by means of routine Pharmacovigilance including periodic safety update reports and a 
targeted follow-up questionnaire to collect data systemically on all cases of periocular skin cancer, 
conjunctival or corneal neoplasia. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the CHMP was of the view that the available safety data were sufficient to support the 
application for Verkazia in the treatment of severe VKC in children from 4 years of age and 
adolescents. In general, Verkazia was well tolerated with mostly ocular AEs such as eye pain and eye 
pruritus which usually occurred during instillation and resolved shortly after. Uncertainties remained in 
relation to the risk of infections and malignancies as a result of a local suppression of the immune 
response in particular when Verkazia is used over prolonged periods of time and because of the limited 
amount of (long-term) safety data with the dose regimen proposed for clinical practice (CsA 0.1%, 
QID). The feasibility to perform a case-control study to generate additional data post-marketing will be 
explored by the applicant as a requirement in the RMP.

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling has been submitted by the applicant and has 
been found acceptable by the QRD Group. 
The applicant has requested to omit the pharmaceutical form, the route of administration and the 
contents from the immediate labelling (single-dose container).  
The following information will be displayed: Invented name, strength, INN (English only), EXP and Lot.   
The Group agreed that all mandatory information is not written on the primary packaging, due to its 
very small size, and also due to the fact that these primary packaging should be kept out of light and 
in a secondary packaging (which has the required labelling).The particulars to be omitted as per the 
QRD Group decision described above will however be included in the Annexes published with the EPAR 
on EMA website, and translated in all languages but will appear in grey-shaded to show that they will 
not be included on the printed materials.  
A request of translation exemption of the INN on the immediate labelling (single-dose container) has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group. Therefore, by 
requesting an exemption to translate the INN, the label of this immediate single-dose container will be 
in English only. As per the ‘Compilation of QRD decisions on stylistic matters in product information’ 
document, the QRD Group has accepted the request to use English INN on the immediate labelling 
because of space constraints issues.  The national language version of the INN must be used 
throughout the SmPC and package leaflet together with the English name in brackets after the 
description of the actual substance in section 2 of the SmPC and at the beginning (top introductory 
part) of the package leaflet.  The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group 
decision above will however be translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on 
EMA website, but the printed materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD 
Group.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Verkazia  is  intended  for  the  treatment  of  severe  vernal  keratoconjunctivitis  (VKC)  in  children  from  4 
years of age and adolescents. 
VKC is a rare ocular allergic disease characterised by an inflammation of the conjunctivitis with corneal 
involvement, mainly affecting boys from the age of 5 to 12 years and commonly resolving at puberty. 
It  usually  affects  both  eyes  and  appears  mainly  seasonally  but  can  also  be  perennial,  chronic  and/or 
with  acute  exacerbations.  Two  phenotypes  exist;  the  palpebral/tarsal  form,  which  is  characterised  by 
papillae  at  the  upper  tarsal  conjunctiva,  and  the  limbal  form  with  thickening  and  opacification  of  the 
limbal  conjunctiva  and  possibly  corneal  neovascularisation,  but  there  are  also  mixed  forms.  Disease 
severity  is  defined  based  on  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of  ocular  surface  inflammation.  Typical 
symptoms  include  photophobia,  burning,  pruritus,  mucous  discharge,  irritation  and  foreign  body 
sensation.  
The  aim  of  therapy  is  to  alleviate  symptoms  and  in  severe  cases,  to  prevent  sight  threatening 
complications including corneal ulceration, scarring, opacities, and keratoconus. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The  management  of  VKC  involves  a  stepwise  approach  based  on  disease  severity.  Cool  compresses, 
saline  rinses  and  preservative-free  artificial  tears  can  be  used  at  all  stages  to  improve  symptoms. 
Among  topical  medications,  antihistamines  and  mast  cell  stabilisers,  as  well  as  other  agent  such  as 
acetylcysteine,  mitomycin-C  and  ketorolac  are  used.  In  more  severe  disease, corticosteroids  are  very 
effective,  particularly  in  quieting  disease  exacerbations.  However,  long-term  administration  of 
corticosteroids  is  associated  with  a  high  risk  of  adverse  reaction  such  as  cataract,  glaucoma,  and 
infection, which limits their use in particular in the paediatric population. Use of antihistamine/mast cell 
stabilisers  as  maintenance  therapy  and  then  pulse  therapy  with  topical  steroids  during  disease 
exacerbations  is  a  common  practice.  Finally,  hospital-compounded  preparations  of  0.5%  to  2%  CsA 
ophthalmic emulsion in olive or castor oil have been used for decades in moderate to severe forms of 
VKC.  
Given  the  possible  irreversible  sight-threatening  character  of  severe  forms  of  VKC  in  the  paediatric 
population, and in light of the safety concerns with long-term use of corticosteroids, there is a need for 
treatment options with demonstrated efficacy in this setting and an acceptable safety profile. 
3.1.3.   Main clinical studies 
The  pivotal  study  supporting  this  application  was  a  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind,  double-
masked,  vehicle  controlled  Phase  III  trial  (VEKTIS)  investigating  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  CsA  0.1% 
eye  drops  given  either  2  times  (BID)  or  4  times  daily  (QID)  to  children  and  adolescents  with  severe 
VKC (grade 3 or 4 of Bonini scale) including corneal involvement (grade 4 or 5 on the modified Oxford 
scale).  A  total  of  168  patients  were  included  in  the  efficacy  analyses  including  127  children  (75.6%) 
and  41  adolescents  (24.4%).  The  double-blind  evaluation  phase  was  4  months  followed  by  an  8-
months extension period in which patients were allowed to receive active treatment, resulting in a total 
observation period of 12 months.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
After  4  months  of  treatment,  the  penalty-adjusted  corneal  fluorescence  staining  (CFS)  score,  which 
was  the  primary  endpoint  in  VEKTIS,  increased  in  both  active  groups  to  a  larger  extent  than  with 
vehicle (difference in the LS mean vs. vehicle was 0.76 [95% CI: 0.26, 1.27] and 0.67 [95% CI: 0.16, 
1.18] for the high and the low dose group, respectively) and the difference was statistically significant 
(p=0.007 and p=0.010). Furthermore, a larger proportion of patients in the high and low dose groups 
(57.1% and 61.1%) compared to vehicle (34.5%) fulfilled the criteria of CFS responders at Month 2, 3, 
and 4, defined as patients with a CFS score ≤ 50% of the baseline CFS, who did not withdraw from the 
study  for  a  reason  possibly  due  to  treatment,  not  requiring  rescue  medication  and  having  no  ulcers. 
When including Month 1 into the analysis (originally omitted as it was hypothesised that many patients 
would  take  rescue  medication  during  the  first  days  of  treatment  and  therefore  would  have  been 
considered  non-responders),  the  difference  between  active  treatment  and  vehicle  remained  with  a 
responder  rate  of  55.4%,  50.0%  and  27.6%  in  the  high  dose  group,  low  dose  group  and  vehicle, 
respectively (p=0.005 and 0.010). The corresponding odds ratios (95% CI) were 3.279 (1.501, 7.163) 
and 2.798 (1.260, 6.211) for the high and the low dose group, respectively. 
Furthermore,  an  improvement  in  subjective  symptoms,  including  photophobia,  tearing,  itching  and 
mucous discharge, as measured using a 100mm visual analogue scale (VAS) score was observed over 
time in all treatment groups. Compared to vehicle, a greater change in the VAS score was observed for 
both  active  treatment  groups  at  Month  4;  the  difference  in  the  LS  mean  change  of  the  average 
symptom  score  was  -19.4mm  (p<0.001)  and  -8.4mm  (p=0.103)  for  the  high  dose  and  the  low  dose 
regimen,  respectively.  The  results  by  symptom  were  consistent  with  the  overall  symptom  score 
showing  a  greater  improvement  for  each  of  the  individual  symptom  scores  with  active  treatment 
compared  to  vehicle.  The  effect  size  at  Month  4  for  each  of  the  symptoms  and  the  overall  symptom 
score was generally within the range of 8-10mm for the low dose and 14-20mm for the high dose. 
The  analysis  of  the  use  of  rescue  medication  (dexamethasone  0.1%  eye  drops)  also  supported 
superiority of CsA 0.1% QID and BID over vehicle. Rescue medication was used by 32.1% (18/56) of 
the patients in the high dose group, 31.5% (17/54) in the low dose group, and 53.4% (31/58) in the 
vehicle  group.  The  difference  versus  vehicle  in  the  mean  number  of  rescue  medication  courses  per 
months was statistically significant for the high dose group (p=0.010) and close to significance for the 
low dose group (p=0.055).  
Finally, data gathered during the 8 months follow-up period of the study suggested maintenance of the 
treatment  effect  in  patients  who  continued  active  treatment  after  the  initial  4  months  evaluation 
period. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The  main  evidence  for  efficacy  of  Verkazia  in  the  treatment  of  severe  VKC  was  based  on  a  small 
number of patients including 56 and 54 patients being treated in VEKTIS with CsA 0.1% QID and BID, 
respectively.  While  justified  due  to  the  rarity  of  the  disease,  the  small  study  size  made  the 
interpretation of the results difficult at times, e.g. in case of subgroup analyses. Furthermore, efficacy 
and safety of Verkazia have not been studied beyond 12 months. 
The distribution of patients (75% children aged 4 to ≤11 years and 25% adolescents) was generally in 
line with the clinical presentation of the disease which usually resolves after puberty. However, there 
are  cases  where  the  disease  continues  into  adulthood.  The  lack  of  data  in  adult  patients  has  been 
reflected in the SmPC of Verkazia. 
Assessment report  
EMA/505143/2017  
Page 72/77 
 
 
 
In VEKTIS, the primary efficacy endpoint was a composite score based on the change from baseline in 
keratitis/ocular  surface  damage  measured  as  CFS  adjusted  by  penalties  for  the  use  of  rescue 
medication and the occurrence of corneal ulcers. Analyses evaluating the relative contribution of each 
of the subcomponents of the composite endpoint showed that the CFS score was the main driver of the 
magnitude  of  the  observed  treatment  effect,  with  rescue  medication  contributing  to  a  lesser  degree. 
Corneal  ulcers  hardly  occurred  within  the  4 months  evaluation  period  of  the  study  and  no  difference 
between  active  and  vehicle  groups  was  seen.  Thus,  no  conclusion  on  the  efficacy  of  Vekarzia  in  the 
prevention  of  disease  progression  to  corneal  ulceration  was  possible.  Furthermore,  the  choice  of  the 
penalty  score  of  1  for  rescue  treatment  and  ulceration  was  considered  arbitrary.  Reassuringly,  when 
modifying  the  weighting  of  the  penalty,  the  outcome  remained  in  favour  of  CsA  with  a  statistically 
significant  difference  to  vehicle  for  both  low  and  high  dose  groups.  Nevertheless,  the  results  of  the 
primary  endpoint  were  difficult  to  interpret  in  terms  of  clinical  relevance.  In  that  sense,  the  CFS 
responder  analyses,  in  particular  those  including  Month  1  (although  performed  post-hoc)  were 
considered more relevant. 
Verkazia  is  recommended  to  be  used  4  times  a  day  including  administrations  at  lunch  and  in  the 
afternoon.  Although  treatment  compliance  was  good  throughout  the  study,  this  regimen  may  prove 
difficult in real-life, in particular for children going to the nursery or school. A less frequent instillation 
(morning and evening only) would be expected to be more convenient and increase compliance. Given 
the seasonal increase in signs and symptoms of the condition, whereby a reduction in disease severity 
is expected in most of the cases when the hot season is declining, a recommendation for QID dosing 
during VKC season, with the option to subsequently (at the end of the season) continue treatment at a 
reduced  (BID)  dose,  once  adequate  control  of  signs  and  symptoms  is  achieved,  was  considered 
acceptable. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The  most  common  treatment-emergent  adverse  event  (TEAEs)  observed  in  the  clinical  development 
program were ocular and included eye pain (11%) and eye pruritus (9%) which were usually transitory 
and  occurred  during  instillation.  Up  to  12  months,  ocular  TEAEs  were  considered  to  be  treatment 
related  in  22.2%  (30/135)  of  patients  treated  with  CsA  0.1%  QID  and  21.7%  (30/138)  in  the  CsA 
0.1% BID group.  
Only 5 serious adverse events were reported in patients receiving CsA eye drops and all events were 
judged  unrelated  to  treatment.  Only  3  patients  receiving  CsA  discontinued  due  to  a  drug  related  AE 
compared to 5 patients in the vehicle arm. 
Systemic TEAEs were reported in a similar proportion in the 3 treatment groups (14.6%, 15.1% and 
15.3%, for the high dose group, low dose group and vehicle, respectively) including reports of upper 
respiratory tract infections. Given the immunosuppressive activity of CsA and since CsA is absorbed 
through the nasolacrimal duct after ocular instillation, although systemic exposure to CsA was overall 
negligible, a causal relation of these events to CsA could not be ruled out. 
3.5.    Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The small number of VKC patients exposed to CsA eye drops (in total 189 patients) in the clinical 
development program, precluded realistic frequency estimations and the detection of rare events.  In 
particular, only 84 and 49 patients received CsA at the strength and dose intended for commercial use 
(0.1% QID) for at least 4 and 12 months, respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/505143/2017  
Page 73/77 
 
 
 
Given the immunosuppressive properties of CsA, there is a risk of related local adverse effects such as 
ocular infection or long latency events including corneal and conjunctival neoplasia and peri-ocular 
malignancy in particular when using CsA eye drops over prolonged periods of time. Toxicity related to 
accumulation of CsA in the ocular surface epithelium and peri-ocular tissues, and potentially deeper 
ocular structures also, is a theoretical consideration. Given that ciclosporin is known to be cytotoxic to 
some tissues, the possibility of penetration into deeper structures and toxicity to the lens epithelium 
should be considered. However, non-clinical studies showed neither accumulation nor significant 
penetration of deeper ocular tissues. 
Overall, 3 cases of ocular infections were observed during the clinical trials program of Verkazia, none 
of which was considered related to treatment, and no cases of malignancies. In the absence of 
conclusive evidence of an increased risk, peri-ocular skin cancer, conjunctival or corneal neoplasia as 
well as development and exacerbation of ocular and peri-ocular infections were considered important 
potential risks. Linked to these concerns is the fact that only few patient data were available with an 
exposure to CsA 0.1% QID up to 12 months, whereas no data were available beyond 1 year of 
treatment. Long-term safety was therefore considered missing information in the RMP.  
Use in patients with active or suspected ocular or peri-ocular infection is contraindicated and regular 
monitoring of the eye is advised when Verkazia is used for prolonged periods (more than 12 months). 
The product information furthermore informs that concomitant use of corticosteroid eye drops may 
potentiate the immunosuppressive effect. Together, these measures were considered sufficient to 
mitigate the potential risks related to a reduced local immune response. Finally, to further evaluate the 
potential risk of periocular skin cancer, conjunctival or corneal neoplasia in the paediatric population, a 
case control study linked to existing cancer registries is foreseen depending on the outcome of a 
feasibility study. Further long-term data are expected to be collected by means of routine 
Pharmacovigilance including periodic safety update reports and a follow-up questionnaire for reports of 
cases of periocular skin cancer, conjunctival or corneal neoplasia. 
Use in pregnant and breast-feeding women was not studied. Given that studies in animals with 
systemic CsA have shown reproductive toxicity at high dosages and despite the low systemic exposure 
at therapeutic doses, Verkazia is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using 
effective contraception and use during pregnancy and in lactating women is only recommended if the 
benefits outweigh the risks. Use in pregnant or lactating women is furthermore considered missing 
information in the RMP and will be monitored post-approval.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A beneficial effect of Verkazia in the treatment of severe VKC has been demonstrated in terms of 
improvement in corneal health. A significantly larger proportion of patients met the CFS responder 
criteria during the first 4 months of treatment with CsA 0.1% than with vehicle [55.4%, 50.0% and

27.6% in the high dose group, low dose group and vehicle, respectively (p=0.005 and 0.010)]. 
Responders were defined as patients with an improvement of the CFS score by 50% or more from 
baseline without the need for rescue treatment or occurrence of ulceration, which was regarded 
clinically meaningful in the proposed target population. The observed increase in the response rates 
with both high and low CsA dose compared to vehicle (odds ratio of 3.279 and 2.798, respectively) 
represents a clinically relevant treatment benefit of Verkazia. This was further supported by consistent 
results for the primary composite efficacy endpoint, with a greater improvement of the penalty-
adjusted CFS for CsA 0.1% compared to vehicle [difference in the LS mean vs. vehicle was 0.76 
(p=0.007) and 0.67 (p=0.010)]. In addition, treatment with Verkazia helped alleviate symptoms with 
an improvement of the average symptom VAS score of -19.4mm (p<0.001) and -8.4mm (p=0.103) 
for the high dose and the low dose regimen, respectively, compared to vehicle. Given a minimum 
clinically significant difference of 10mm, these results supported a clinically relevant effect. Overall, 
consistent and clinically relevant results in favour of CsA 0.1% across the efficacy variables and 
subgroups were observed.  
The safety assessment was limited by the small size of the safety database with only 49 patients being 
exposed to CsA 0.1% QID for 12 months and without any data beyond 1 year. The small samples size 
did not allow for accurate frequency estimations and rare adverse reactions may not have been 
detected. Despite this drawback, the available data showed that Verkazia was generally well tolerated. 
Adverse reactions were predominantly ocular and transient in nature occurring mainly during 
instillation of the eye drops. They included eye pain (11%) and eye pruritus (9%). Due to the 
immunosuppressive properties of CsA, uncertainties remained in relation to the risk of peri-ocular skin 
cancer, conjunctival or corneal neoplasia as well as the development and exacerbation of ocular and 
peri-ocular infections, in particular in patients using Verkazia over prolonged periods of time. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Both the improvement in corneal surface defects and in symptoms observed with Verkazia in patients 
with severe VKC were considered clinically relevant. At the same time, treatment up to 12 months was 
well tolerated with mainly transient ocular adverse reactions including eye pain and itching in about 
10% of patients. Overall, the CHMP was of the view that the benefits of Verkazia in the treatment of 
severe VKC in children from 4 years of age and adolescents outweighed its risks.

Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk balance of Verkazia is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Verkazia is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment of severe vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) in children from 4 years of age and adolescents.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Univar BV submitted on 8 February 2018 an application for marketing authorisation to the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Cufence, through the centralised procedure falling within the 
Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 20 November 2014. 
Cufence was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/03/172 on 24 October 2003 in the 
following condition: treatment of Wilson’s disease. Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing 
authorisation and at the time of the review of the orphan designation by the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP), this product was withdrawn from the Community Register of designated 
orphan medicinal products on 6 June 2019 on request of the sponsor. The relevant orphan designation 
withdrawal assessment report can be found under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website 
ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/cufence.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Cufence is indicated for the treatment of Wilson’s disease in patients intolerant to D-Penicillamine 
therapy, in adults and children aged 5 - ≤17 years. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The Applicant applied for the following indication: 
‘Cufence is indicated for the treatment of Wilson’s disease in patients intolerant to D-penicillamine 
therapy, in adults, adolescents and children aged 5 years or older’ 
Wilson’s disease (WD), also known as hepatolenticular degeneration, is an autosomal recessive disorder 
that results in pathological copper accumulation. A mutation in the ATP7B gene, located on chromosome 
13, is responsible for WD. The mutations lead to a defective ATP7B protein that normally mediates the 
binding of copper molecules to apoceruloplasmin in hepatocytes, forming ceruloplasmin, which can then 
safely transport the bound copper to its intended sites. In addition, the ATP7B protein serves to transport 
excess copper from hepatocytes into the bile for subsequent excretion, thus permitting safe elimination of 
excess copper. Such copper transport systems are required as, although copper is essential for cellular 
function, free copper is toxic and causes cell damage. In WD, copper homeostasis is impaired such that a 
large excess of copper accumulates initially in the liver. When the storage capacity of the liver is 
eventually exceeded, hepatocyte necrosis follows and the copper is released and subsequently stored in 
the brain and other organs and tissues. 
Normal dietary consumption and absorption of copper (1 to 5 mg per day) exceeds the metabolic need of 
approximately 0.75 to 0.9 mg per day. Homeostasis of copper is maintained exclusively by biliary 
excretion. Therefore, if the excretory capacity is exceeded, copper progressively accumulates in the liver 
and other tissues such as the brain, kidney, and cornea leading to the clinical manifestations of WD. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Wilson disease is found worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1:30,000. This 
estimation may vary by population with Japan/Asia having a higher prevalence compared with an 
estimated prevalence in Europe of approximately 5.84 per 100,000 population.  
Information entered into the EuroWilson database between 2005 and 2008 indicated that the average 
yearly incidence of new cases in Europe per million population ranged from 0.11 in Sweden to 4.23 in 
Croatia (median of 0.60 [EuroWilson, 2011]). The apparent incidence is higher in central Europe (e.g., 
Poland, Austria, Croatia) than in Western European countries. In an epidemiological study, prevalence in 
France was estimated to be 1.5/100,000 (Poujois, 2016).

WD presents symptomatically at any age, with the majority between 5 and 35 years (EASL 2012); 
asymptomatic patients are most often detected by family screening. Symptoms at the time of the initial 
presentation, and those that subsequently develop are most commonly categorised as hepatic or 
neurologic/neuropsychiatric.  
Untreated, Wilson disease is universally fatal. Copper accumulation in the liver eventually leads to the 
development of cirrhosis. Among patients with neurologic Wilson disease, neurologic disease may 
progress until the patient becomes severely dystonic, akinetic and mute. Progression is usually gradual, 
but sudden deterioration may also occur. The majority of patients will die from liver disease (cirrhosis or 
acute liver failure), while the remainder die due to complications due to progressive neurologic disease.  
Though data regarding life expectancy among untreated patients with Wilson disease are lacking, one 
study found that the median survival following the development of neurologic symptoms was 
approximately five years (Dening 1988). Patients who develop acute liver failure due to WD have an acute 
mortality rate of at least 95 percent in the absence of a liver transplantation, with death occurring in days 
to weeks (EASL 2012). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis  
Wilson disease is due to a genetic abnormality inherited in an autosomal recessive manner that leads to 
impairment of cellular copper transport. It is characterised by defective incorporation of copper into 
ceruloplasmin leading to copper accumulation in the liver, brain and kidneys as well as decreased biliary 
copper excretion.  
See also section 2.1.1. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Clinical presentation can vary widely. Symptoms at the time of the initial presentation, and those that 
subsequently develop are most commonly categorized as hepatic/ neurologic or psychiatric. Hepatic 
symptoms are the initial clinical manifestation in about 40-50% of WD patients and may precede 
neurologic manifestations by as much as 10 years. Most patients with neurologic symptoms have some 
degree of liver disease at presentation. The hepatic dysfunction symptoms are highly variable, ranging 
from enlargement of the liver or asymptomatic biochemical abnormalities, to overt cirrhosis or acute 
hepatic failure (Pfeiffer 2007). 
Neurologic or neuropsychiatric manifestations of WD typically present later than liver disease, most 
commonly in the third decade of life, but can also be present in childhood. There is a range of presenting 
neurologic abnormalities which are initially present in 40–50% of patients (Yarze, Martin et al. 1992). 
They include Parkinson-like akinetic-rigid syndrome, pseudosclerosis with tremor, ataxia, and dystonic 
syndrome. Neuropsychiatric abnormalities can also develop. These most commonly include personality 
changes and mood disturbances, particularly depression, but may also manifest as impulsiveness, 
disinhibition, paranoia or poor school performance. 
Other manifestations of WD include an ophthalmological marker, namely the presence of Kayser–
Fleischer rings, which are caused by deposition of copper in Descemets membrane of the cornea. These 
are present in 95% of patients with neurologic symptoms and over 50% of those without neurologic 
symptoms.  
Diagnosis 
According to EASL clinical practice guidelines in the European Union (EU) (EASL 2012), “for routine 
monitoring, serum copper and ceruloplasmine, liver enzymes and international normalised ratio (INR), 
functional parameters, complete blood count and urine analysis as well as physical and neurological 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 10/96 
 
 
examinations should be performed regularly, at least twice annually (Grade II-2, B, 1, AASLD Class I, 
Level C)”. 
The diagnosis of Wilson’s disease is based on a combination of clinical, biochemical, and genetic tests. 
Genetic testing is feasible but currently of limited use since many mutations occur; the majority of cases 
are compound heterozygotes and a sizeable proportion of definite cases have no detectable mutation. 
Family screening of Wilson’s disease patients is an appropriate method for early diagnosis, the chance of 
a sibling being a homozygote and developing clinical disease is around 25%.  
For many patients, a combination of tests reflecting disturbed copper metabolism may be needed; any 
single test may result in a false ‘positive’ or false ‘negative’ (EASL, 2012). Therefore diagnosis of Wilson’s 
disease is based on a combination of clinical, biochemical, and genetic tests. A scoring system, the 
‘Ferenci score’ was developed at an international meeting in Leipzig (Ferenci 2003) for helping to 
determine the need to continue with diagnostic testing for Wilson disease and determine the certainty of 
diagnosis. This scoring system includes clinical and laboratory testing, and results yield in three 
categories of patients: those in whom other diagnoses should be considered (0-1 points), those in whom 
further diagnostic testing is needed (2-3 points), and those in whom there is certainty as to diagnosis (4 
or more points). 
Untreated WD is universally fatal. Prognosis for survival depends on the severity of liver and neurological 
disease, and, of upmost importance, compliance with drug treatment (Ala, Walker et al. 2007). The 
prognosis for patients who receive and are adherent to treatment for Wilson disease is excellent, even in 
some who already have advanced liver disease. In patients without advanced liver disease, life 
expectancy is normal, though treatment may lead to worsening of neurologic symptoms in a fraction of 
patients (Stremmel et al. 1991, Bruha et al. 2011).

2.1.5.  Management 
Wilson’s disease is a rare condition for which there are limited treatment choices available. If left 
untreated, it is a fatal condition.  
Treatment of patients with Wilson’s disease may take many forms including drug therapy, diet 
management and liver transplantation. Dietary control of copper intake is not sufficient in most patients, 
and pharmacological treatments are therefore needed. The disease can be successfully managed with 
pharmacologic intervention.  
Chelating agents (D-penicillamine or trientine) are recommended to be used as the first line treatment of 
symptomatic patients by both the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 
European Association for Study of Liver (EASL). Wilson’s disease patients receiving adequate and timely 
treatment with chelation therapy have a good prognosis for survival. With adherence to treatment, liver 
function can remain stable without progression of liver disease. Treatment is life-long and is aimed at 
removing excess accumulated copper and preventing its accumulation. It should not be discontinued, 
unless liver transplantation is performed. 
There are two currently approved types of copper chelating agents, D-penicillamine (DPA) and trientine. 
Due to its better efficacy, D-penicillamine is usually the first choice for patients with WD. However, about 
20 to 30% of the WD patients using D-penicillamine will experience adverse reactions (Merle, Schaefer et 
al. 2007; EASL 2012; D-penicillamine SmPC 2014) in the first 1–3 weeks of the treatment, which often 
result in discontinuation of treatment. Long-term use of D-penicillamine carries further risks of side 
effects. According to EASL clinical practice guidelines and many other literature references, trientine may 
be better tolerated than D-penicillamine. 
The trientine salt TETA 2HCl was introduced in 1969 as a copper chelator alternative to D-penicillamine 
(Walshe 1969). TETA 2HCl is registered nationally in the UK and in the US and mostly used for treatment 
of WD in patients intolerant to D-penicillamine (Schilsky 2001; Ferenci 2004; Ala, Walker et al. 2007). In 
2017, Cuprior (trientine as TETA 4HCl) was approved as second line treatment in WD for patients aged 5 
years and older in the EU via the centralised procedure. 
Zinc salts are also used for the treatment of WD. Zinc salts are usually not recommended for the initial 
therapy of symptomatic patients because of the slow onset of action, but may be used as monotherapy in 
asymptomatic patients or for maintenance therapy when copper levels are below toxic thresholds and 
patients are clinically stable. Zinc is centrally approved for the treatment of Wilson’s disease since 2004 
(Wilzin, MAH: Orphan Europe S.A.R.L.). 
Pharmacological therapy remains the primary treatment in WD, although its efficaciousness may diminish 
in more advanced disease states. If patients are already presenting with decompensated cirrhosis, they 
may be treated intensively with chelators, however if patients are unresponsive to this approach a liver 
transplant would be required. Some other agents (e.g. tetrathiomolybdate and dimercaprol) are 
mentioned in clinical guidelines but these are (still) investigational products. 
For patients who develop acute liver failure, liver transplantation is the only option for survival, with 
survival rates reported up to 59- 76% at 5-10 years (Medici, Mirante et al. 2005), with poorer outcomes 
observed in those patients with neurologic or neuropsychiatric symptoms. The use of liver transplantation 
has also been reported to be used in patients with severe neurological disease (Schumacher, Platz et al. 
1997); however its use as a primary treatment is not recommended (Roberts and Schilsky 2008). 
About the product 
Cufence contains the active substance trientine dihydrochloride (TETA 2HCl) and is presented as 300-mg 
hard capsules equivalent to 200 mg trientine base. 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 12/96 
 
 
The proposed dosing regimen is 2-8 capsules of Cufence, administered 2 to 4 times a day in adults and 
1-4 capsules administered 1 to 4 times a day in children. The product is titrated to target according to 
clinical response and different copper parameters.  
The indication applied for is ‘Cufence is indicated for the treatment of Wilson’s disease in patients 
intolerant to D-penicillamine therapy, in adults, adolescents and children aged 5 years and older.’ 
The pharmacotherapeutic group is “various alimentary tract and metabolism products”; ATC code: 
A16AX12. 
Trientine is a chelating agent that acts due to a dual mechanism of action: primarily by promoting urinary 
copper excretion and to a lesser extent by reducing copper absorption from the gastrointestinal tract (and 
thus promoting faecal copper excretion). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This marketing authorisation application (MAA) for Cufence 300 mg tablets is in accordance to Article 8(3) 
of the Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, a  “Full-mixed Marketing Authorisation” application. Thus, this 
MAA relies on studies conducted by the Applicant with trientine dihydrochloride and on relevant 
bibliographic references to support non-clinical and clinical aspects.  
There is no specific CHMP guidance for studies in Wilson’s disease.  
The Applicant obtained CHMP protocol assistance in 2007 and 2012, where CHMP stated that a 
retrospective study and review of clinical experience together with PK and PK/PD data may be sufficient 
for a second-line indication. In a clarification letter issued 2012, the CHMP recommended the following: 
• 
PK/PD data in special populations, especially in children, will be required. There are currently no PK or 
PD data in children to support the proposed dose. Thus, regarding the planned studies in children, PD 
data should be collected in addition to any PK data. Regarding the planned PK studies in adults, it is 
also strongly recommended to include PD assessments. 
A PK study was conducted in 16 adults and 4 children ≥12 years, but no meaningful PD parameters were 
evaluated. Study TR-001 PK reveals shortcomings in trial design and conduct affecting the interpretation 
of the results.  
• 
The Applicant should develop lower capsule strengths for use in children and for purposes of dose 
titration when initiating treatment. 
This request was not followed by the Applicant.  
• 
In vitro studies to assess the potential of trientine to inhibit and induce CYP450 isoenzymes will be 
required. In addition, in vitro studies to exclude a significant involvement of CYP450 isoenzymes in 
the metabolism of trientine are strongly recommended. 
Respective non-clinical tests were conducted.  
• 
It is recommended that the Applicant evaluate the effect of food and zinc on trientine absorption. 
The effect of food and zinc on trientine/Cufence absorption was not fully investigated in this application. 
•  Additional studies to investigate relationships between dose/titration schemes and serum 
copper/urinary copper excretion levels in patients may provide further useful information. This would 
be valuable to support appropriate dosing recommendations, such as for patients with neurological 
symptoms. 
The relationship between dose, plasma concentration and clinical effect of Cufence was not

comprehensively investigated.  
Deficiencies observed in the non-clinical data as previously pointed out in the CHMP comments would be 
expected to be addressed at the time of MAA, for either first or second line indication. 
The applicant conducted own studies and provided relevant bibliographic references to support both 
nonclinical aspects. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as white opaque size 0 gelatine capsules, containing 300 mg of trientine 
dihydrochloride equivalent to 200 mg of trientine base as active substance.  
Other ingredients are capsule content: magnesium stearate, colloidal anhydrous silica; capsule shell: 
gelatine, titanium dioxide (E171); printing ink: shellac glaze, titanium dioxide (E171), iron oxide black 
(E172), propylene glycol, iron oxide yellow (E172). 
The product is available in amber glass bottle with a polypropylene cap and induction heat seal liner with 
a sachet of dried silica gel as desiccant. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of trientine dihydrochloride is triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (TETA 2HCl) 
corresponding to the molecular formula C6H18N4.2HCl. It has a relative molecular mass of 219.20 g/mol 
and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The active substance is a white to pale yellow crystalline hygroscopic powder, freely soluble in water and 
dilute acid and alkali, soluble in methanol, slightly soluble in ethanol, insoluble in chloroform, ether.  
The chemical structure of trientine dihydrochloride was elucidated by a combination of 13C and 1H-NMR 
spectroscopy, elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and MS analysis together with characteristic chemical 
reactions and x-ray crystallography. There are no chiral centres in the molecule. 
Trientine dihydrochloride is known to exhibit polymorphism. Three crystalline forms of trientine 
dihydrochloride have been identified in the literature, two anhydrous forms, Form I and Form II, which are 
both monoclinic, and a dihydrate. Form I and the hydrate form appear to exist in equilibria, with an 
increase in relative humidity increasing the dihydrate form, and an increase in temperature resulting in an 
equilibrium shift in favour of the anhydrate. The applicant showed that this polymorph form (Form I) is 
manufactured and stable over the proposed retest period.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Trientine dihydrochloride is synthesized in in a three-stage process (purification, salt formation and 
recrystallization) using commercially available well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. A detailed description of the manufacturing process and a flow scheme have been 
provided.  
The starting material, triethylene tetramine (TETA), is acceptable in line with ICH Q11 and Q&A on Q11 as 
commercially available chemicals can be considered to be acceptable as starting materials without further 
justification. This is applicable for TETA, as it is well known that it is a commodity used also in 
non-pharmaceutical market. Schematic details, including catalysts or other materials used, of both 
suppliers have been provided.  
The description of the simple manufacturing process of TETA 2HCl from the starting material TETA was 
considered acceptable. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications 
and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The manufacturing process is well established and was developed over 30 years ago. More recently, an 
evaluation of critical quality attributes (CQAs) and critical process parameters (CPPs) were performed 
based on the definitions provided in ICH Q11. CPPs have been identified and controls are in place to 
ensure that CQAs meet the required standard. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) drums, collecting into double 
low-density polyethylene (LDPE) liners which comply with the Ph. Eur. chapter 3.1.4 and EC directive EC 
10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), clarity of solution in water (Ph. 
Eur.), solubility, identification (IR, chemical), melting point (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), assay (titrimetry), 
hydrogen chloride content, loss on drying (USP), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), 
purity (GC), impurities (GC), related substances (IC), residual solvents (GC, GC-MS), a starting material 
process impurity(LC-MS), particle size distribution (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.). 
The maximum daily dose of trientine is 1600 mg. The corresponding reporting (RT), identification (IT) and 
qualification (QT) thresholds defined in ICH Q3A are RT: 0.05%, IT and QT: 0.06%. The impurities are 
specified according to ICH Q3A. Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to 
ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies. The limit for “other individual impurities” is 
also set to the identification limit (0.06%). Elemental impurities are controlled in line with ICH Q3D 
Guideline for Elemental Impurities. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from a significant number of historical batches (including 22 within the proposed 
commercial production scale range) of the active substance are provided. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019

Stability 
Stability data from three production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 18 months under long term (5°C ± 3°C) and 
intermediate (25°C ± 2°C 60% RH ± 5% RH) conditions and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40°C± 2°C/75% RH ± 5% RH), according to the ICH guidelines, were provided. The 
parameters tested are the same as for release. The analytical methods used were the same as for release 
and were stability indicating. Additional supportive stability data was provided from five historic batches 
(3x2005, 2009, 2014) which were tested to previous, more limited, specifications and supplemented by 
testing of retained samples. All tested parameters were within the specifications. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. No differences in the 
impurity profiles were observed between the samples that were exposed and the samples that were not 
exposed to light. Results showed that the active substance is not sensitive to light.  
Results from forced degradation studies performed on samples under stress conditions (thermal, humid, 
acidic pH, alkaline pH, oxidising) and analysed using the GC, LC-MS and IC impurity analytical methods 
were provided. Some increases in impurities were observed. The results demonstrated the active 
substance susceptibility to heat degradation and the stability indicating nature of the analytical methods. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Cufence finished product is presented as white opaque size 0 gelatine capsules, containing 300 mg of 
trientine dihydrochloride equivalent to 200 mg of trientine base, for oral administration.  
The capsules are imprinted with “Cufence 200” in grey ink and are packed in quantities of 100 in 175 ml 
amber wide-necked glass bottles (Type III), fitted with a white polypropylene cap with a heat induction 
foil inner-seal. A sachet of dried silica gel is included in the bottle. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards, where applicable. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The 
list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. The influence 
of functionally related characteristics of excipients has been assessed in sufficient detail. 
This product (with the same formulation and method of manufacture) was granted a marketing 
authorization in the UK in 1985. The formulation development has been adequately described. A risk 
assessment of the manufacturing process was performed and critical parameters were investigated. The 
discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated.  
Proposed bulk holding times have been investigated. The primary packing material for bulk capsules 
conform to Ph.Eur. standards. The Applicant is performing a hold time study on recent batches to confirm 
the holding times. 
The primary packaging for the finished is amber wide-necked glass bottles (Type III), fitted with a white 
polypropylene cap with a heat induction foil inner-seal. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. Compliance of containers used for storage and transport of 
the bulk product to relevant guidance has been shown.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: blending, sieving, blending, encapsulation and 
packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications    include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form; 
appearance  (visual),  loss  on  drying  (gravimetric),  identification  (IR),  assay  (UV/Vis),  dissolution  (Ph. 
Eur.), pH of 1% solution (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), degradation products (LC-MS, 
IC) and microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.). 
The finished product is released on the market based on the release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Impurity limits have been set in line with 
the ICH Q3B guideline.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Elemental impurities are controlled 
in the active substance specification. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be 
concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product 
specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been 
presented. 
Batch analysis results from four batches produced in 2012 and 2013 and four full scale batches produced 
in 2017 are presented. All parameters are in compliance to the specification current at the time of 
production. The results confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three production scale batches of finished product (manufactured in 2017) stored for 
up to 18 months under long term (5°C ± 3°C) and intermediate (25 ºC / 60% RH± 5% RH) conditions and 
for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40°C±  2°C/75%  RH  ±  5%)  according  to  the  ICH 
guidelines were provided. The batches of Cufence are identical to those proposed for marketing and were 
packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested in line with the proposed shelf life specifications for appearance, loss on drying, 
assay, dissolution, pH of aqueous solution, related substances / degradation products, microbiological 
purity.    The  analytical  procedures  used  are  stability  indicating.  No  significant  changes  have  been 
observed. 
Additional  supportive  stability  data  from  studies  of  three  production  scale  batches  of  finished  product 
(manufactured in 2013) and stored up to 36 months at 2-8°C, were also provided. Samples were tested 
in line with the shelf life specifications in place at the time for appearance, disintegration, assay, HCl 
content, acidity/alkalinity of solution, loss on drying, related substances. The analytical procedures used 
were stability indicating. All tested parameters were mostly within set specifications, without any obvious 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 17/96 
 
 
trends  (loss  on  drying,  content,  HCl,  disintegration  and  pH).  Dissolution  and  related  substances  were 
either not tested or based on an old method. Additional testing of 39 months old samples revealed low 
levels of related substances, far below the specified levels. 
Results from forced degradation studies are presented. The samples were exposed to the stress 
conditions (humidity, acid hydrolysis, base hydrolysis, oxidation and tested after one day (20-23 hours), 
three days and 14 days. A photostability study has not been conducted, because photostability testing on 
the active substance demonstrated that the active substance is not sensitive to light. Only one 
degradation product was identified using LC-MS. The degradant levels were increased under oxidising and 
thermal conditions. The IC method indicated an increase of a degradation product under thermal, acid 
and high humidity conditions. 
Data from in-use stability studies confirmed the stability of the product up to 3 months at 2-8°C. An 
additional batch should be tested at the end of shelf-life, as committed by the Applicant, to confirm 
generated data. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months when stored at 2-8°C in the 
proposed container closure system as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the 
gelatine used in the manufacture is provided. No other materials of animal and/or human origin are used 
either in the synthesis of the drug substance or in the manufacture of the drug product. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Trientine is a well-established active substance and was licensed in the United Kingdom (UK) in 1985. This 
full, mixed application is made to the European Medicines Agency in accordance with Article 8(3) of 
Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. Thus, this MAA relies on studies conducted by the applicant and 
relevant bibliographic references to support both nonclinical and clinical aspects. 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 18/96 
 
 
Protocol assistance was provided by EMA (EMEA/H/SA/840/1/2006/PA/II) in 2007 on the need to conduct 
new nonclinical studies for the purpose of MAA, and follow-up protocol assistance 
(EMEA/H/SA/840/1/FU/1/2012/PA/III) on the same aspect was sought in 2011. 
In line with the EMA response the applicant conducted GLP compliant validation studies to assay PKs in rat 
and human sera, an in vitro CYP450 interaction study, a GLP-compliant AMES test in a single strain (w and 
w/o copper supplementation) with trientine dihydrochloride, a non-GLP compliant dose range finding 
study in pregnant rats, in silico evaluations of the genotoxic potential of the five main impurities using 
DEREK and Leadscope assays.    
The majority of data provided for nonclinical assessment rely on literature. Search terms for literature 
search together with databases and publisher websites used as sources are provided with the dossier. 
Details on GLP concordance for published data cannot be provided, but the peer-reviewed nature provides 
at least a minimum level of scientific integrity. 
The AMES test as well as validation of PK analysis were compliant with applicable GLP standards. The 
claim of GLP compliance is in accordance with the OECD Test Guidelines and Principles of GLP. 
The absence of GLP compliance for the dose-range finding EFD study in rabbits is acceptable, facing that 
it was conducted according to the SOPs of the test facility (which are in accordance with OECD GLP 
regulations) and facing that this study is only one element for evaluating developmental risk.   
It is recognized that in silico evaluations used for evaluation of genotoxic potential of impurities cannot be 
performed in GLP compliance, but it was confirmed that the report has been generated from output from 
the respective program versions. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The Applicant provides evidence from literature for non-clinical proof of concept in several animal models: 
LEC rat model mimics to some degree WD, with elevated hepatic copper levels, hepatitis and jaundice. 
Trientine is able to increase urinary excretion, reduce hepatic copper levels in LEC rats and showed a 
dose-related reduction in liver concentrations of copper in beagles. Results of trientine tested in other 
non-clinical models of WD (toxic-milk mouse, Atp7b knockout mouse, Labrador retriever) were not 
provided, but likely would not add value. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamic effects published for trientine at the non-clinical level relate to anti-cancer 
activity, Alzheimer´s disease, diabetic kidney- and cardiovascular disease, together with a potential 
chelating effect of other divalent cations, i.e. zinc and iron, but also magnesium and calcium addressing 
aspects of potential pharmacodynamic drug interactions. Possible interaction with these ions and the 
separation of their administration is reflected in the SmPC. The Applicant clarified that the therapeutic 
potential of trientine in animal models of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes-induced kidney and 
cardiovascular disease, is – from a general perspective – most likely driven by its copper-chelating 
properties and not a consequence of off-target secondary effects. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No formal safety pharmacology studies have been undertaken by the applicant. Neurological 
examinations, electrocardiography and blood pressure measurements were included in the repeated dose 
toxicity studies in dogs (Maemura et al, 1998). No treatment-related changes in blood pressure or 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 19/96 
 
 
electrocardiogram measurements were observed. Neurological changes were observed at high dose 
levels, which recovered on cessation of treatment and were considered to be consistent with the effects 
of copper deficiency. 
Regarding safety pharmacology, published evidence from repeated dose toxicity studies in dogs of 4- and 
26-weeks duration indicates no safety concerns. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Based on bibliographic data trientine has been shown to chelate iron and zinc in vitro. Iron deficiency is a 
recognised side effect of trientine treatment, and trientine has been shown to increase zinc excreted in 
the urine of patients. Therefore an interaction with iron and zinc, particularly if given at the same time, 
cannot be excluded. As patients treated with trientine may develop symptoms of iron deficiency, 
precautionary statements were included into the SmPC that iron supplementation may be needed and 
should be administered at a different time than trientine. The concomitant use with zinc is not 
recommended in the SmPC as interactions with trientine are likely. No pharmacodynamic drug interaction 
studies have been undertaken this was considered acceptable by the CHMP.. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Oral bioavailability of trientine shows strong variability in the range of 5-25%, with relatively short 
half-life, as reported from literature. Autoradiographic data shows a maximum around 1 hour after 
administration, with high radioactivity mainly in the liver and kidney, with no evidence of retention in 
tissues after IV or oral administration. Plasma protein binding was confirmed to be low, with data 
generated by the Applicant (Study APT-REP-01).  
Trientine is mainly absorbed by the plasma membrane of intestinal epithelial cells, with low contribution 
of tight junction permeation. Several non-clinical studies show that oral bioavailability is strongly 
impaired by food intake. In this regard, reference is made to the clinical assessment report. 
The uptake characteristics by rat intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles indicate similarity to 
spermine and spermidine, as well as dose-dependent inhibition by these physiological polyamines; as 
such, their presence in the GI tract likely contributes to the high variability in oral bioavailability. 
Toxicokinetic data derived from 4- and 26-week studies in dogs do not indicate accumulation or sex 
differences. 
The Applicant´s own data are derived from TK analysis conducted in the frame of a dose-range finding 
embryo-foetal development study in pregnant female rats. Oral dosing results in plasma AUC0-t values 
increasing in a slightly greater than dose-proportional manner.  
In vitro CYP450 interaction studies showed no inhibition of CYP450-mediated metabolism as tested in 
studies conducted by the Applicant with human liver microsomes and singly expressed human CYP450 
isoforms. These results are consistent with literature-derived data showing metabolisation primarily via 
acetylation, a non-CYP450 mediated reaction.  
The predominant metabolite in rat was N1-acetyltriethylenetetramine (MAT), which was also found in the 
urine of treated subjects, besides trientine, N1, N10-diacetyltriethylenetetramine (DAT) and three minor 
metabolites. SSAT2 (thialysine acetyltransferase) was shown to be the main metabolizing enzyme 
responsible for low oral bioavailability. The SmPC accordingly mentions under section 5.2 that “Trientine 
is metabolised by acetylation via spermidine/spermine N-acetyltransferase and not via N 
acetyltransferase 2.” 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 20/96 
 
 
Urinary excretion presents the central route of excretion for trientine, mainly as acetylated metabolites 
(MAT and DAT). Comparison of urinary excretion in intact animals after intravenous and oral dosing and 
in bile duct-cannulated rats dosed orally suggests that at least 40% of the trientine dose is absorbed after 
oral administration.  
There is no interaction between trientine and the substrate of the H+/organic cation antiporter or 
aminoglycoside antibiotics. A specific transport system (Na+/spermine antiporter on the renal 
brush-border membrane) is responsible for renal excretion of trientine (but does not recognize the 
trientine-copper complex). Drugs that change the concentration of sodium ions in renal proximal tubules, 
such as diuretics, can increase the trientine excretion since the increase in the luminal concentration of 
sodium ions accelerates the Na+/spermine antiporter. The low protein binding properties of trientine 
make drug interactions as a consequence of displacement of trientine from plasma protein binding 
unlikely. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Based on submitted literature trientine is considered to have moderate acute toxicity after oral 
administration (LD50 rat > 2000 mg/kg bw) and moderate toxicity after dermal application (LD50 rabbit 
550-805 mg/kg bw). No formal single dose studies have been conducted by the applicant this was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The NOAEL of trientine following oral administration for 26 weeks in rats was considered to be 50 
mg/kg/day for females and less than 50 mg/kg/day for males, without measuring systemic exposure. 
NOAEL in dogs was established to be 50 mg/kg/day in a 26 week (oral administration) study, associated 
with a mean Cmax and AUC of approximately 22 μg/mL and 73 μg.h/mL, respectively – presenting an 
adequate margin of exposure. 
Main toxicological findings are consistent across different species and manifested in reduced body weight 
gain, altered urinary electrolytes, low plasma copper levels (except mice), liver findings and various 
histopathological changes in the lungs (mainly interstitial pneumonitis). Exclusively the latter 
observations were not reversible, and are of doubtful importance, as those were also seen in the control 
animals.  In dogs, ataxia, tremors, abnormal gait and underactivity were observed following 
administration of very high levels of trientine.   
Genotoxicity 
The OECD SIDS triethylenetetramine 2002 classifies the genotoxic profile of trientine as low 
priority/concern.  Trientine shows mutagenicity in bacterial cells with and without S9 fraction in a broad 
range of bacterial strains, which could indicate that this is not caused solely by oxidative stress (triggered 
as a consequence of copper depletion). Supplementation with CuCl2 showed reduction or elimination of 
mutagenic effects, but is confounded by the bactericidal effects of copper. Oxidative stress also has an 
impact on tests in cultured mammalian cells, where contradictory results were observed with trientine. 
Published results of mouse micronucleus tests after oral or intra-peritoneal administration examining the 
bone marrow or peripheral blood were negative, but had some deficiencies in the protocol. According to 
Option 2 of ICH S2(R1) a second in vivo assay would be required, but any outcome would need to be 
discussed against the confounding issue of oxidative stress caused by copper depletion. However, as it is 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 21/96 
 
 
evident that the copper chelating property of trientine reduces the oxidative stress associated with the 
disease such study can be waived.  
Carcinogenicity 
Only dermal, but no oral carcinogenicity studies with trientine in rodents are reported. Standard 2-year 
rodent bioassays in healthy rodents would anyhow have limited impact on the overall carcinogenicity risk 
assessment, based on confounding primary pharmacology of the compound. Importantly, LEC rats 
showed reduced levels of single strand breaks after treatment with trientine, indicating a reduction of 
endogenous DNA damage in a WD model. Thus it can be agreed, that separate carcinogenicity studies are 
not needed for trientine.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
No teratogenic effects were observed in rabbits, while rats showed foetal abnormalities in the high dose 
group, significantly reduced after copper supplementation. In a dose-range finding study in pregnant rats 
conducted by the Applicant at lower doses, despite a dose dependent reduction in serum copper levels, 
there was no evidence of teratogenicity and the NOAEL was considered to be 750 mg/kg/day. 
Nevertheless, there was evidence of an early effect of treatment on embryo survival, which is not 
surprising as the impact of copper deficiency on the developing foetus is well established: different 
newborn copper-deficient species show similar abnormalities as known with swayback (enzootic ataxia) 
in lambs. Positive teratogenicity signals observed after prenatal exposure of mice, for instance, still leave 
it open if this represents an intrinsic property of the compound or a consequence of copper deficiency. 
Published experience with the use of trientine in pregnant women does not indicate major birth defects - 
but is too limited to make final conclusions. But clear evidence is given for the increased clinical risk of 
spontaneous abortions in untreated WD. 
Trientine is also intended for treatment of children, but no juvenile toxicity studies were performed or 
results of PPND studies are available – which is acceptable from a non-clinical perspective. 
Impurities identified for trientine have been sufficiently qualified through DEREK and LEADSCOPE 
analysis. 
No fertility data are available but oestrous cyclicity was unaffected and reproductive organs were not 
identified as target organs in general repeat dose toxicity studies; hence, the absence of data on fertility 
is acceptable.  
Toxicokinetic data 
Please refer to chapter 2.3.3. 
Local Tolerance  
No data were presented. However according to OECD SIDS triethylenetetramine 2002 exposition to 
saturated vapour was tolerated without impairment whereas the exposition to aerosol leads to reversible 
irritations of the mucous membranes in the respiratory tract. The aspect of irritation is appropriately 
mentioned in the SmPC under 5.3. The same document reports that triethylene tetramine induces skin 
sensitization in guinea pigs, mice and man. This information is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 22/96 
 
 
Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity is not anticipated with trientine. The predominant metabolites of trientine are the 
acetylated metabolites MAT and DAT. They are discussed and assessed in the PK section of this report 
with data provided from literature. This is considered adequate for this application. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity assessment is based on data from OECD SIDS publication for 
triethylene tetramine on the octanol/water partition coefficient, concluding that no bioaccumulation is 
expected. This seems justified, also recognizing the chemistry of the compound.   
Referring to the respective guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 21*), the highest recommended 
dose (and not the mean daily dose of 670 mg trientine base) should be used to calculate the predicted 
environmental concentration PEC surfacewater, which then (applying 1600 mg according to SmPC based 
on trientine base) would equate to a refined value of 0.0144 µg/L. Additional data in order to refine the 
Fpen were provided by the Applicant. Due to a reprocessed correction factor for Fpen, based on a 
prevalence estimation by Orphanet published in June 2018, and considering more recent annual 
prevalence data from France (Poujois et al., 2017 replacing older data referred by Rodriguez-Castro et al., 
2015), a new PECsurfacewater of 0.0037 µg/L was calculated, clearly below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L.  
The requirements for not conducting a Phase II environmental fate study with the drug substance are 
thus met.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Trientine is able to increase urinary copper excretion and reduce hepatic copper levels in the LEC rat, a 
model mimicking to some degree WD in humans. The compound also showed a dose-related reduction in 
liver copper concentrations in Beagles.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic effects are basically explained by the chelating effect of trientine for 
divalent cations. Thus, besides copper, zinc, iron, magnesium and calcium are considered, also 
concerning potential pharmacodynamic drug interactions.  
Safety pharmacology is covered by published results from repeated dose toxicity studies in dogs of 4- and 
26- weeks study duration, indicating no safety concerns.

Non-clinical PK after oral administration shows highly variable (5-25%) bioavailability, relatively short 
half-life (maximum at around 1 hour post administration), no indication for retention in tissues and low 
plasma protein binding. Several non-clinical studies consistently show that oral bioavailability is impaired 
by food intake.  
The applicant conducted TK analysis in the frame of a dose-range finding embryo-foetal development 
study in pregnant female rats, largely supporting conclusions derived from published data.  
The absence of CYP450-mediated metabolism was confirmed by studies conducted by the Applicant.  
Literature data provides sufficient evidence that there is no interaction between trientine and the 
substrate of the H+/organic cation antiporter or aminoglycoside antibiotics. The Na+/spermine antiporter 
on the renal brush-border membrane is responsible for renal excretion of trientine, but does not recognize 
the trientine-copper complex. The low protein binding nature of trientine makes a drug interaction as a 
consequence of displacement of trientine from plasma protein binding unlikely. 
The NOAEL of orally administered trientine (derived from 26-week studies from literature) was 
established at 50 mg/kg/day for dogs and female rats, and less than 50 mg/kg/day for male rats. The 
main toxicological findings were consistent across different species with reduced body weight gain, 
altered urinary electrolytes, low plasma copper levels (except in mice), liver findings and various 
histopathological changes in the lungs. 
Mutagenicity for trientine was shown in bacterial cells with and without S9 fraction; it was reduced after 
supplementation with CuCl2, but also confounded by the bactericidal effects of copper. A mouse 
micronucleus test showed negative results. The Applicant did not conduct a second in vivo assay (in line 
with Option 2 of ICH S2(R1) as any result would be confounded by increased oxidative stress as a 
consequence of copper depletion (as published, for instance, for cattle showing increased chromosomal 
aberrations and comet induction as a consequence of copper depletion). This primary PD effect of copper 
depletion would also have an impact on standard 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies, as such agreed to 
be not relevant for this MAA. Importantly, in LEC rats as a model for WD, reduced levels of endogenous 
DNA damage (single strand breaks) were shown for trientine.  
Copper deficiency presents also a well-known teratogenic mechanism in animals (i.e. enzootic ataxia in 
lambs), and is also suspected causative for the positive teratogenicity signals in mice – while other effects 
of trientine on organogenesis cannot be completely excluded. 
Absence of genotoxic risk was shown for impurities identified for trientine and qualified through QSAR 
analysis. 
In regard of the ERA, the requirements for not conducting a Phase II environmental fate study with the 
drug substance were met and further ERA-studies are not needed. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The review of non-clinical data available for trientine indicates no issues for concern.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Little is known about the pharmacokinetics of trientine. While some PK data exist for trientine in healthy 
volunteers, mainly from two publications (Cho et al. 2009; Lu et al. 2010a), there are only limited data 
available on trientine PK in WD patients, obtained from two small studies (Miyazaki et al., 1990; Tanabe 
1996a). 
As the relevant literature data is scant, the CHMP (EMA protocol assistance obtained in 2007 and 2012) 
recommended that the Applicant conduct a pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) study to 
support the Cufence dossier. Collection of additional PK data in special populations and especially in 
children was highly recommended. 
The Applicant conducted a Phase I PK profiling study (Study TR-001 PK) in adult and paediatric WD 
patients treated with trientine dihydrochloride. The study medication is commercially available in the UK 
for the treatment of Wilson’s disease in patients intolerant of D-penicillamine therapy.

Study TR-001 PK 
The objectives of this Phase I, open-label and single-centre study were to evaluate the PK of a single dose 
application of trientine in children ≥ 6 years and adult patients with WD whilst also evaluating the safety 
and tolerability of a single dose of trientine.  
According to the clinical study report, the single dose of trientine administered in the study was the dose 
routinely taken by the individual patient. Since all patients had been on treatment with trientine 
dihydrochloride prior to the study, they were assumed to be in steady state. The study was initiated 04 
June 2013 (first patient enrolled) and completed (last patient completed) 06 March 2014. 
The batch of trientine dihydrochloride (batch number 005428) used in the PK study was manufactured by 
a previous manufacturer of Univar´s trientine capsules.  
Blood samples were taken from all subjects pre-dose and at 10 time-points (at 30 min, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
6, 8, and 12 hours) post-dose to investigate the PK profile of trientine up to 12 hours post-dose. 
20 patients (9 males and 11 females) were planned and finally included in the study; 4 of them were 
children aged 12 - 16 years and 16 were adults aged 19 - 61 years. All 20 patients completed the study 
and included in the analyses of PK variables and safety. 
Study conduct 
No inclusion or exclusion criteria were violated and no patients were excluded from either the safety or the 
PK analyses.  
Prior and concomitant medications were reported: 18 (90%) out of the 20 patients were treated with 
D-penicillamine or similar agents prior to treatment with trientine (thus compiling the target population). 
The time lag between D-penicillamine discontinuation and trientine initiation is not known for the 
individual patient; all enrolled patients have been treated with trientine for several months or several 
years. 14 patients (70%) patients reported intake of concomitant medication other than trientine.  
Results 
Trientine absorption was found to be low and variable in WD patients, with tmax occurring between approx. 
0.5 and 4 hours post-dose. These values are similar to those published for healthy volunteers and WD 
patients. Trientine exposure was highly variable between subjects, as also reported in the literature. The 
plasma elimination t1/2 of trientine was rather short (approx. 3.6 h in median) and comparable to that 
reported for healthy subjects. 
Study TR-001 PK exhibits several major deficiencies and inconsistencies with regard to the planning, 
conduct and reporting of the study: 
- 
Timing of last trientine dose: 
Information on when patients received their last trientine dose before the start of the PK study is not 
available, as patients were not instructed to record their last trientine intake before study initiation. The 
possible influence of different administration time points on study outcomes was not discussed by the 
Applicant, but seems very likely. The high variability in pre-dose levels of trientine could have resulted 
from these variances.  
-  Dose regimen: 
Originally, only sparse information was provided in the study report about the usual dose regimen for 
each patient. According to Pfeiffenberger et al. 2018, who published the results from PK study TR-001 PK: 
‘Twenty patients with Wilson disease were enrolled in the study. Patients had a confirmed diagnosis of 
Wilson disease and were receiving a stable regimen of twice daily trientine, as well as their other 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 26/96 
 
 
prescribed medication.’ Based on the information in the study report and the publication, it was assumed 
that all 20 WD patients were on a twice-daily dosing regimen. It was later clarified by the Applicant that 
this was the case for only 11 out of the 20 patients; the other patients received trientine either three times 
daily (n=5), four times daily 3 (n=3) or once daily (n=1). Hence, the 20 patients were in fact on four 
different dosing regimens.  
Calculation of the steady state:  
The Applicant states that for the calculation of the steady state as described in study report TR-001PK a 
twice-daily dosing regimen and a 12-hour time interval from the last trientine dose before the PK study 
was assumed. However, as these assumptions do not obviously correspond to the facts and the 
respective conclusions are rejected. 
-  Origin/sourcing of trientine: 
All 20 patients took Univar´s Trientine capsules prior to study initiation, however it remains unclear if they 
were manufactured by the previous manufacturer of Univar’s trientine capsules or Aesica (both products 
significantly differ with regard to their dissolution characteristics). As there was no wash out period, 
differences between the products could have further influenced trientine concentrations measured in the 
studies and contributed to the variable pre-dose levels of trientine.  
- 
Food administration: 
The patients received no standardized meals nor were there any explicit restrictions with respect to food 
intake during the study. Hence, food as a root cause for the observed high variability of PK results cannot 
be excluded.  
The Applicant has also not discussed possible influences of concomitant medications on the PK results. 
-  Additional data – in vitro Dissolution 
The batch of trientine dihydrochloride used in the PK study (batch #005428) was manufactured by the 
previous manufacturer of Univar´s trientine capsules. Since September 2013, Cufence capsules have 
been manufactured by Aesica. Relevant differences in the manufacturing process (the qualitative and 
quantitative composition of the Univar capsules remained the same) and in the in vitro dissolution 
behavior between the batches of the previous manufacturer and the batches of Aesica were observed. 
The batches made by Aesica exhibit a much slower dissolution (mean ± SD 61.47±5.12 % after 45 
minutes) than the batches of the previous manufacturer (mean ± SD: 97.25±7.91 % after 45 minutes). 
In the Applicant´s point of view, in vitro dissolution is not considered a critical factor for the 
pharmacokinetics of trientine. The Applicant states that “the physicochemical properties of trientine, 
whilst being responsible for the very tight binding of copper making this an effective treatment for 
Wilson’s disease, are also responsible for the mechanism of absorption and extensive metabolism 
resulting in low and variable bioavailability. With this being inevitably linked to the chemical structure, the 
additional impact of slightly less than optimal dissolution for an immediate release product is unlikely to 
have any meaningful impact on bioavailability or on clinical safety and efficacy”.  
Taking what is known about trientine pharmacology into account, there is reason to assume that the 
formulation of the product can have significant influence on the exposure. From the EPAR of the centrally 
approved trientine product, ‘Cuprior’ (published 03/10/2017), it is evident that markedly faster in vitro 
dissolution resulted in a much higher exposure.  
The impact of the formulation changes on the reliability of the PK results is unknown and applicability of 
the results of the PK study for the Aesica product is thus questioned.  No reliable bridging between the two 
formulations can be made. The Applicant subsequently identified the root cause for the slow dissolution of 
the Aesica product and developed a new rapidly dissolving formulation (intended for future submission). 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 27/96 
 
 
Keeping this in mind, and also in light of the deficiencies of study TR-001 PK described above and its 
limited value, no further questions on the applicability of the TR-001 PK results for either the Aesica 
product were raised. 
Absorption of trientine following oral administration is known to be low (8-30%, according to Lu et al. 
2010a) and potentially influenced by intake of food or certain liquids containing binding partners/metal 
ions. There is a certain risk of inactivation of the drug by metal binding in the gastrointestinal tract. 
Prolonged dissolution times increase the potential for local interactions in the upper digestive tract and 
consequently could influence trientine absorption. However these potential interactions with zinc, other 
anti-copper agents or metal ions as well as food are adequately addressed in the product information.

The descriptive statistics for individual trientine PK parameters are summarised in Table 1 .

Levels of trientine pre-dose and post-dose and several PK parameters were assessed over a period of 12 
hours and 12 hours was the assumed dosing interval for all patients. In Table 1 PK endpoints are 
summarized. It is noted that some parameters were reported only for 14 patients instead of 20 for 
unknown reasons. 
According to the Applicant, levels of trientine in pre-dose samples were generally similar to those 
measured at 12 hours post-dose, thus confirming that PK parameters are representative of steady state.  
Differences between pre-dose and 12 hours post-dose levels for trientine were observed in a number of 
subjects. Plasma levels were lower at 12 hours post dose in the larger share of patients (which could be 
comprehensible if the patient´s usual time between doses was < 12 hours), but also some patients with 
higher post-dose values compared to baseline are included.  
Applicability of single dose PK results to picture steady state condition in study TR-001 PK 
A bid dosing regimen with a 12 hour time interval was assumed for all included patients. A 12-hour time 
interval was also assumed between last trientine dose before the PK study and intake of study medication. 
However,  in  the  course  of  the  assessment  it  has  emerged,  that  the  20  patients  were  in  fact  on  four 
different dosing regimens (bid (N=11/20), tid (N=5/20), qid (N=3/20) or qd (N=1/20). Therefore, the 
12- hour time point used for assessment of steady state may have impaired the correct assessment of the 
steady state, since last drug intake on the day preceding the PK assessments may have been more or less 
than 12 hours, especially for subjects using a different treatment schedule than bid. The actual intake 
time of the last dose before study conduct has not been recorded. 
The  Applicant  provided  a  re-evaluation  of  the  results  taking  into  account  the  assumed  actual  dose 
regimen of individuals (this was not pre-specified in the study protocol).

Table 2 Overview of steady state concentrations per patient 
Results of this analysis indicate that the mean plasma concentration at the time-point for steady state 
assessment (122.18 ng/mL) is comparable to the mean pre-dose value (128.17 ng/mL), which would be 
expected in steady state conditions. Both, Cthrough levels and the new ‘concentration at steady state’ levels 
seem to rather be values measured during the study TR-001 PK, than calculated variables (see table 14).  
The baseline variabilities render comparisons of PK results between patients extremely difficult. The 
possible causes for the high variability of trientine exposure data are manifold and the most likely cause 
might not even be the high inter- and intra-patient variability of trientine PK per se; due to its poor design 
and absence of standardization during the study (see also discussion of the study above) the experiment 
was unlikely to suitably and sensitively evaluate possible inter- and intra- patient variability. This 
significantly hampers the interpretation of this data source as primary evidence for Cufence 
pharmacokinetics. 
Overall, the design of Study TR-001 PK is not considered appropriate to robustly reveal or exclude any 
influences of demographic factors.  
Bibliographical data 
So far, only a few studies have been conducted investigating the PK of trientine in healthy volunteers as 
well as in patients. Thus, knowledge about the PK of trientine is rather limited and mainly based on the 
results of the two studies performed in 
a) Healthy volunteers (Cho et al. 2009, Lu et al. 2010a)

Cho et al. (2009):  
The population PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of triethylenetetramine (TETA) dihydrochloride (trientine, 
GC811007) were determined in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
group-sequential, dose-escalating study in 40 healthy adult male and female volunteers (8 active 
subjects and 2 placebo subjects in each dose group). Trientine was administered orally as 100, 300, 600, 
or 1800 mg twice daily (daily doses of 200, 600, 1200 and 3600 mg) for 14 consecutive days. The PK 
profile, PD effects, PK/PD relationship, tolerability and safety of trientine was evaluated. 
Non-compartmental serum pharmacokinetic parameters were determined on Day 1 and Day 14, and the 
urinary excretion of copper was measured on Days 1, 7 and 14. The accumulation index is calculated as 
the AUC0-12 ratio for Day 14/Day 1. A two-compartment model was used for the PK analysis and a linear 
direct effect model for drug-induced copper excretion (PD). The population PK/PD model was applied 
using the NONMEM software. Covariates tested were glomerular filtration rate (GFR), body weight, and 
gender.  
Results indicated that tmax was reached quickly (0.33-2 h after dosing) and there was subsequent 
bi-exponential decline in serum levels. Mean T1/2 varied between days 1 (1.9 h), 7 (3.4 h) and 14 (5.1, 
5.4, 10.4 and 14.2 h for the 200-, 600-, 1200- and 3600-mg daily doses, respectively). 
Despite the longer half-life observed at higher doses there was no evidence of non-linearity of serum 
exposure over the dose range based on Cmax or AUC. There was no notable accumulation of exposure 
upon repeated dosing. An increase in cupruresis occurred in all groups compared to baseline and placebo 
and was higher in the 0 to 12h interval compared to the 12 to 24-h interval suggesting a role of the 
circadian variation in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and of dietary intake. For the pooled trientine 
doses, cupruresis increased by 4- to 11- fold. The authors noticed a linear relationship between serum 
trientine concentrations and urine copper excretion rates.  
The population PK absorption rate constant was estimated at 3.99 h-1 confirming that trientine is rapidly 
absorbed after a short lag time. Gender and body weight did not appear to influence any of the 
pharmacokinetic parameters. On the other hand, a sequential population PK/PD model which was 
developed with GFR, body weight and gender tested as covariates suggested that both GFR and gender 
may be helpful clinical covariates for individualizing trientine doses during chronic administration, 
although it was noted that additional long-term analysis in patients would be warranted. 
Lu et al. (2010a):  
These authors investigated whether the N-acetyltransferase (NAT) 2 phenotype has any effects on the 
pharmacological properties and safety profile of TETA. Twelve fast and 12 slow NAT2-phenotype healthy 
participants were recruited. Trientine was administered orally as a single 600 mg dose on Day 0, followed 
by twice daily doses of 600 mg on Days 2 to 6 and a single 600 mg dose on Day 7. 
Non-compartmental analysis was used to determine the 24-hour plasma concentration-time profiles for 
trientine and two acetylated metabolites, N1-acetyltriethylenetetramine (MAT) and N1, 
N10-diacetyltriethylenetetramine (DAT) on Day 0 and Day 7. The PK parameters for fast and slow 
acetylators were compared using a 2-way analysis of variance to determine if there were any differences, 
and copper excretion in the same groups was compared by analysis of covariance. Comparison of 
drug/metabolite plasma concentrations with cupruresis was performed using a linear mixed effects 
model. 
Since trientine was still detectable in plasma after 15 to 18 hours, the authors suggested that a 
non-compartmental approach did not provide the best estimates for half-life. No significant overall effect 
of acetylation status was found for the PK profiles of TETA, MAT, or DAT, and it was postulated that the 
trientine-metabolizing enzyme is spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase. Moderate accumulation of 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 32/96 
 
 
trientine, MAT and DAT were apparent upon twice-daily dosing – the effect was more evident for the 
metabolites due to their longer half-lives. 
Increased cupruresis was evident during the first 12 hours post-dose, with the highest rates occurring 
between 0 and 4 hours. There was no significant difference in cupruresis based on NAT2 acetylator 
phenotype. Comparison of drug/metabolite plasma concentrations with cupruresis indicated that the 
change in urinary copper excretion was more closely rated to trientine + MAT than to either trientine or 
MAT alone. 
No differences were found in the safety and tolerability of trientine by acetylation status. 
Detailed information of the test products (such as e.g. composition or dissolution properties) is not 
available for both studies and it is also not known if analytical analyses were adequate. However, both 
authors also studied trientine as dihydrochloride salt which is in accordance with the active moiety of 
Cufence. 
b) 
Wilson’s disease patients  
Miyazaki et al. (1990): A sensitive and simple fluorometric method for the determination of trientine in 
human plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography is described. Plasma levels of trientine in 8 
Wilson´s disease patients (4 male and 4 female patients) receiving treatment for excess copper were 
measured. The 8 patients received oral doses of approximately 8.3 mg/kg. Absorption rates of trientine 
were relatively slow and the peak levels were significantly different among patients. However, blood 
collection in that study was within the first 8 hours after dosing, and as PK parameters only Cmax and tmax 
values were measured.          
PK results were not tabulated but were plotted for individual subjects. These plots indicate that peak 
concentration occurred at 3 hours in 3 males and at 2 hours in the fourth, with Cmax concentrations of 
approximately 0.35, 0.8, 1.4 and 16 μg/mL. In females, tmax was at 3 hours in 3 females and at 5 hours 
in the fourth with a Cmax range of about 1.2 to 3 μg/mL. Free trientine - trientine that does not take part 
in chelation with metal ions - was not detected at any peak time in the 8 patients; the greatest part of 
trientine in plasma is thus probably chelated with metal ions (especially copper).  
Tanabe (1996a): In this study the disposition behaviour of trientine and its metabolites in patients with 
Wilson’s disease was studied. A high concentration of metabolites appeared in blood samples of patients 
soon after administration of trientine. Furthermore, large amounts of trientine metabolites were excreted 
into the urine of patients. These results suggest that trientine is subjected to a first-pass effect. The 
absorption process was determined an important factor for the behaviour of the substance. However, the 
metabolite(s) measured in that study were not identified or characterized; thus, it was unclear which 
metabolite(s) had been measured. Again, blood collection was within 8 hours following dosing, and most 
PK parameters were not reported, except for AUC0-6 values.  
The mean ± SD AUCs of unchanged, metabolised and total trientine in 8 patients with Wilson’s disease 
were 6.39 ± 3.07, 12.64 ± 4.02 and 19.03 ± 4.99 μg·h/mL, respectively. The AUC of the unchanged and 
metabolized trientine did not appear dependent on the administered dosage. However total trientine 
levels shown were consistent with dose proportionality. The mean ± SD urinary excretion of unchanged 
trientine expressed as a % of dose in patients with Wilson’s disease was 2.11 ± 2.04 (n = 83) at 1 day and 
1.64 ± 1.03 at 6 hours (n = 7) The corresponding percentages for total trientine were 27.08 ± 14.90 and 
8.80 ± 3.34, respectively. 
PK data from WD patients is particularly sparse. The studies of Miyazaki and Tanabe involved only very 
few subjects and reported few PK parameters. Interpretation of the results of these studies is difficult

administration/ influence of food etc.) In addition, in both studies blood was only collected within the first 
8 hours after dosing. Due to the outlined limitations, comparison of results with TR-001 PK is not feasible. 
Comparison and Analyses of Results across Studies 
Due to the limitations described above comparison of the results of Study TR-001 PK with the results of 
the four cited studies is difficult. The PK parameters measured in Study TR 001-PK could be considered 
comparable to those obtained in the two PK studies conducted in healthy volunteers with regard to their 
absolute values and variability. Also, the trientine AUC0-t and Cmax values in Wilson’s disease patients were 
similar to those observed in healthy subjects, and the variability between subjects was also comparable. 
If dose-normalised, the mean exposure in healthy subjects upon repeat dosing was 6.93 (ng·h/mL)/(mg) 
[CV: 57.2%] compared with 7.62 (ng·h/mL)/(mg) [CV: 62.0%] in Wilson’s disease patients. 
For Cmax, the mean dose-normalised values were 1.58 (ng/mL)/(mg) [CV: 69.4%] on Day 7 of repeat 
dosing in healthy subjects, and 1.94 (ng/mL)/(mg) [CV: 55.8%] at pharmacokinetic steady state in 
Wilson’s disease patients. Other investigators have also noted variability of exposure to trientine, but 
without analysis of the variability due to the smaller number of subjects (Miyazaki et al, 1990; Cho et al, 
2009). The mean half-life of trientine after repeat dosing was also found to similar between healthy 
subjects (3.28 ± 1.15 hours) (CV: 35.1%) and Wilson’s disease patients (3.77 ± 1.28 hours) (CV: 
33.9%). Thus, the Applicant concluded that the results obtained in the present PK study showed that the 
PK parameters (and their variability) for trientine observed in Wilson’s disease patients were similar to 
those described in healthy subjects. 
• 
Influence of food 
TR-001 PK 
In Study TR-001-PK, 17 patients were submitted to overnight fasting before dosing, 3 patients (all in the 
0.6 g dose group) received their last meals in the morning 1.5 to 3 hours before dosing, whereas all other 
patients had previously eaten during the day before dosing. The Cmax/D range in the recently-fed 
patients (1.27 to 1.60 [ng/mL]/[mg]) was contained within the range for other patients of 0.843 to 5.63 
(ng/mL)/(mg); the range of AUC0-t/D values (6.09 to 7.77 [ng/mL.h]/[mg]) was contained within the 
range in non-fed patients of 2.06 to 23.9 (ng/mL.h)/(mg). Thus, the Applicant concluded that there was 
no evident influence of food intake on trientine PK parameters based on data from these 3 patients. 
This view is not fully supported. Food intake in this trial does not seem to have been standardised in terms 
of quality or quantity or timing of administration. Only limited information is given when patients received 
food after dosing (“approximately 30 min after dosing”), but basically food intake (or a critical beverage, 
like milk) was not restricted or sufficiently controlled after dosing during the study. This is not in line with 
available guidance for the evaluation of food effects.  
Bibliographical Data 
Available literature on trientine indicates that there is an interaction with food in animals and healthy 
volunteers. When taken together with food, the bioavailability of trientine was decreased by 1/8 in dogs 
compared to a fasted control group (Tanno et al. 2008). Following oral administration of 1500 mg TETA 
2HCl in a fed healthy volunteer reduced Cmax (from 3.8 to 1.5 mg/L), delayed tmax (from 2 to 4 h) and 
prolonged  t1/2  (from 4  to 8  h)  (Nakano  et  al.  2009).  This  stands  in  contrast  to  the  Applicant’  results, 
however, the way the food effect was investigated in Study TR-001 PK was not state of the art. 
Inclusion of information on a probable food effect in the PI is endorsed despite the lack of own clinical data 
(see above). As outlined in the section above (“Additional data – Dissolution profile”) the conducted 
changes in dissolution could potentially increase the consequences of a food effect. Data from literature 
suggest that trientine will be absorbed throughout the length of the gastro-intestinal tract, with the rate 
of absorption linked to gut wall surface area (Kobayashi et al. 1990, Sakuma et al. 2007, Tanno et al. 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 34/96 
 
 
2008). However, it remains  unknown if these pre-clinical data can be extrapolated to Cufence capsules 
as different formulations of trientine were used in these studies and trientine was either administered 
already dissolved in water or in form of tablets.  
Distribution 
TR-001 PK  
Distribution of trientine was not investigated. 
Bibliographical data  
Following oral administration and absorption in the gut, trientine is widely distributed in the human body 
with accumulation mainly in the liver and the kidney. Central and peripheral volumes of distribution were 
reported to be 393 L and 252 L, respectively (Cho et al. 2009; Lu 2010). This indicates wide distribution 
in the body and high tissue binding. While exhibiting a low distribution to brain, a high distribution of 
trientine to kidneys and liver was also reported in studies with rats (Tanabe 1996). An accumulation of 
trientine mainly in the liver and kidney as reported in the literature is likely to occur for Cufence as well. 
Elimination 
• 
Excretion 
TR-001 PK 
The terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of trientine ranged between 2.33 to 6.99 hours (the mean t1/2 was 
3.772 hours) and was calculated for 14 (out of 20) patients. There was no marked difference for t1/2 
between the child and adult patients. Interestingly, the highest t1/2 of 6.99 hours was noticed for subject 
05 receiving 0.6 g of trientine. This was the only Black or African American WD patient in the Study. As 
this patient also differed concerning the pre-dose and post-dose levels of trientine, influence of ethnicity 
could be possible but no conclusions can be drawn. 
The terminal elimination half-life was found to be rather short which is in accordance with the literature 
which means that the drug is being rapidly removed from the body and therefore it may need to be 
administered several times a day to be effective. Dosing recommendations (2-4 doses/day) are therefore 
supported with this regard.  
No relationship between dose administered and t1/2 could be observed in the present study. 
Bibliographical Data 
The plasma elimination t1/2 of TETA in healthy volunteers and Wilson's disease patients has been reported 
to range from 1.3 to 4 hours (Lu 2010), indicating fast elimination of the parent compound. The t1/2 
increases to approximately 3 to 5 hours after repeated dosing at 200 and 600 mg/ d (Cho et al. 2009; Lu 
et al. 2010a), and reaches 10 to 14 hours after repeated dosing at 1,200 and 3,600 mg/d (Cho et al. 
2009).  
Most oral TETA is not absorbed, but excreted unchanged in the feces (Gibbs and Walshe, 1986). Trientine 
that is systemically absorbed is said to be extensively metabolized, with the majority being excreted in 
urine as metabolite(s) (Lu 2010). 
The urinary excretion of unchanged drug is approximately 1% of the administered dose and mostly occurs 
within the first 6 hours. Approximately 8% of such doses are excreted as two acetyl metabolites, 
monoacetyl-TETA (MAT) and diacetyl- TETA (DAT); their excretion occurs later than TETA excretion and 
continues for 26 hours or longer (Cho et al. 2009). 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 35/96 
 
 
Little information was provided by the Applicant about the t1/2 of trientine´s two major metabolites, MAT 
and DAT (see section “Metabolism” below for further details). Lu et al. 2010a reported that both 
metabolites have much longer T1/2 than that of TETA itself. The MAT T1/2 is around 5.3 hours and DAT 
T1/2 is around 10.8 hours. After 7 days of repeated dosing at 600 mg/d, MAT T1/2 reached 9 hours and 
DAT T1/2 reached 14 hours. 
•  Metabolism 
TR-001 PK 
The metabolites of trientine were not measured in the present PK Study. 
Bibliographical Data 
Trientine is extensively metabolised in humans, as a number of metabolites have been found in urine in 
addition to the unchanged parent compound. Two major trientine metabolites have been identified from 
human urine, both of which are acetylation products of trientine: MAT and DAT (Lu 2010).   
In plasma, the exposure to the monoacetylated metabolite is approximately twice that of unchanged 
trientine, which, in turn, is approximately three times that of the diacetylated metabolite (Lu et al. 
2010a). Whereas DAT is most probably inactive, available studies (e.g. Lu et al. 2007) suggest that MAT 
is an active metabolite in humans with a contribution to overall urinary copper excretion. Lu et al. (2007) 
reported that most of the TETA excreted in urine was present as metabolites, and unchanged TETA only 
accounted for 22.8 ± 0.6% and 7.1 ± 0.8% of total excreted drug in healthy and diabetic subjects, 
respectively. The percentage of metabolites excreted via urine was much higher in diabetic subjects (92.9 
± 0.1%) than in healthy controls (77.2 ± 0.2%). This is in accordance with previous findings that more 
metabolite than parent compound is excreted in urine of humans and rats (Kobayashi et al., 1990; 
Kodama et al., 1993, 1997; Takeda et al., 1995).  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Study TR-001 PK and bibliographical data 
There is evidence from the literature (Cho et al. 2009) that trientine is dose proportional within the 
proposed dose range. There are no data available from the present study regarding dose proportionality 
of trientine. No dedicated single and multiple dose AUCs are available from Study TR-001 PK to elaborate 
on time-independency/dependency of the compound.  
INTRA- AND INTER-INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY 
Study TR-001 PK and bibliographical data 
Intra-individual variability:  
Data regarding intra-subject variability of trientine PK/PD are sparse in literature and have only 
beengenerated in healthy volunteers so far. Cho et al. 2009 estimated in their PK/PD model the 
intra-individual variability for healthy volunteers to be 42.9 % (SE%:5.98) for PK sigma and to be 49.7 % 
(SE%: 10.6) for PD sigma. No data concerning intra-subject variability are available from Study TR-001 
PK as the study was not designed to collect such data (single dose). 
Inter-individual variability:  
In Study TR-001 PK a high inter-individual variability of the different PK parameters between the 20 
patients was noticed. This finding concurs with what is reported in the literature. There seems to be a 
large variablity of Cmax and AUC among different individuals, in healthy volunteers and WD patients as 
well. Cho et al. 2009 suggested that Cmax variance seems to be less profound in healthy volunteers and 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 36/96 
 
 
that inter-subject variability could be even higher in the WD patients compared to healthy volunteers. The 
Applicant reported that if dose-normalised, the mean exposure in healthy subjects upon repeat dosing 
was 6.93 (ng·h/mL)/(mg) [CV: 57.2%] compared with 7.62 (ng·h/mL)/(mg) [CV: 62.0%] in the present 
study with Wilson’s disease patients. For Cmax, the mean dose-normalised values were 1.58 
(ng/mL)/(mg) [CV: 69.4%] on Day 7 of repeat dosing in healthy subjects, and 1.94 (ng/mL)/(mg) [CV: 
55.8%] at pharmacokinetic steady state in Wilson’s disease patients. According to these results the 
inter-subject variability Cmax was found to be lower in WD patients than in healthy volunteers, which is in 
contrast to the hypothesis of Cho et al. 2009. 
Other investigators have also noted variability of exposure to trientine, but without analysis of the 
variability due to the smaller number of subjects (Miyazaki et al, 1990; Cho et al, 2009). 
In clinical practice, high inter-individual variability might be compensated by titration to target. As 
exposure can vary between subjects, the starting dose should be selected conservatively so that all 
patients remain within a safe window of exposure.  
Special populations 
Influence of age, renal (or hepatic) impairment was not investigated in the present Study TR-001 PK. 
Information from bibliographical references is sparse. As regards PK results in children, please refer to 
previous sections of this report. No PK or PD data are available from literature in children. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
• 
In vitro 
See safety section of this report.  
Bibliographical Data 
Trientine has been shown to chelate iron and zinc in vitro (Kodama et al. 1997). An interaction with iron 
and zinc, particularly if given at the same time, cannot be excluded. Appropriate recommendations to 
avoid interactions are given in the SmPC. 
• 
In vivo 
TR-001 PK 
3 out of the 20 subjects in Study TR-001 PK concomitantly used zinc. One subject took iron as 
concomitant medication. A number of subjects concomitantly used calcium or magnesium containing 
medicines. Substance with presumed interactions with trientine could well have been discontinued for the 
time of treatment (including an appropriate wash out period) as long as patients were closely monitored. 
However, this was not done in Study TR-001PK. 
The Applicant claims that concomitant medication did not influence the PK parameters based on the 
results of six patients, who were taking no medication at the time of PK sampling. The Cmax/D range in the 
trientine-only patients (1.03 to 2.00 ng/mL]/[mg]) was contained within the range for other patients of 
0.843 to 5.63 (ng/mL)/(mg); the range of AUC0-t/D values (4.91 to 7.77 [ng/mL.h]/[mg]) was contained 
within the range in patients receiving other medications of 2.06 to 23.9 (ng/mL.h)/(mg). However, no 
thorough analysis to investigate the potential influence of concomitant medications was conducted, and 
the meaningfulness of such an analysis would have been questionable anyway, considering the small size 
of the trial and its other limitations. 
No proper investigation regarding interactions of trientine with zinc was conducted by the Applicant.  
Cufence - Assessment Report

Bibliographical Data 
There is limited information on the use of trientine in combination with D-penicillamine to treat Wilson’s 
disease patients. 
Trientine as a chelating agent may reduce calcium and magnesium antacid effect. There is no evidence 
that calcium and magnesium antacids alter the efficacy of trientine but, as this cannot be excluded, it is 
recommended to separate administration of trientine and calcium and magnesium antacids by at least 
two hours (antacids should be taken after meals). This recommendation is made in the summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC). 
Trientine also chelates iron, and co-administration of trientine and iron should be avoided because the 
complex with iron is toxic (Roberts and Schilsky, 2008, EASL, 2012, Trientine UK SmPC). Iron 
supplementation may be necessary in some cases and should be administered at a different time of the 
day to trientine. Trientine should not be taken concurrently with iron or other heavy metals with which it 
may form complexes. This recommendation is also made in the SmPC. 
The combination of trientine with zinc is not recommended. There are only limited data on concomitant 
use available and no specific dose recommendations can be made. This recommendation is also made in 
the SmPC. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Trientine is a copper-selective chelator that enhances systemic elimination of divalent copper by forming 
a stable complex that is readily excreted by the kidneys. Trientine is a chelator with a polyamine-like 
structure and copper is chelated by forming a stable complex with the four constituent nitrogens in a 
planar ring. Thus, the pharmacodynamic action of trientine is dependent on its chemical property of 
chelating copper and not on its interaction with receptors, enzyme systems or any other biological system 
that might differ between species. Trientine may also chelate copper in the intestinal tract and so inhibit 
copper absorption. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Information on PD is derived from the literature and some pharmacodynamic parameters were collected 
as secondary objectives/endpoints in both of the submitted studies, study TR-001 PK and study 
UNV-TRI-002, respectively.  
Primary pharmacology 
Trientine is a copper-chelating agent which forms a stable complex with copper that is then eliminated 
through urinary excretion. Data from literature suggest that trientine may also inhibit absorption of 
copper from the intestinal tract (e.g. Hill et al. 1986, Fox 2008, Crisponi 2010, Siegemund et al. 1991).  
Study TR-001 PK 
The Applicant did not define PD objectives to describe PD dose response. Serum copper and serum 
ceruloplasmin levels were determined in Study TR-001 PK for evaluating the safety of Cufence after a 
single dose administration. According to the Applicant there were no clinically significant observations for 
any patient at any time point for either serum copper or ceruloplasmin. These results contributed to the 
Applicant´s overall conclusion that the single dose administration of Cufence was safe. Both parameters 
were only measured over a period of 8 hours.  
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 38/96 
 
 
 
Study UNV-TRI-002 
Measurement of copper storage metabolism at each time point after initiation of trientine treatment was 
defined as an objective.  
The change in 24-hour urine copper (24h-UCE) excretion over the course of trientine treatment (two 
measuring time points) was evaluated in 10 patients during a treatment-free period. 7 patients showed a 
decrease in copper excretion over time and 3 showed an increase, which the Applicant suggested to be 
linked to mobilisation of copper.  
As patients were not under treatment at the time of measurement, it remains unknown what caused 
copper mobilisation. Both, an increase and a decrease of 24-hour urine copper excretion, are interpreted 
as beneficial trientine effects by the Applicant. During a treatment free period, patients would not be 
expected to have increased urinary copper excretion, however.   
Secondary pharmacology 
Studies investigating secondary pharmacological effects of trientine are listed below in Table 3.

Trientine has complex interactions with dietary metals other than copper such as iron and zinc and they 
may inhibit one another’s absorption and even cause deficiency states. Such interactions are difficult to 
explore and the literature is sparse. In practice, the problem represented by these interactions should be 
dealt with by careful timing of medications in relation to one another.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
For the description of Cufence´s PK this application relies partly on bibliographical data (predominately 
from healthy volunteers) and partly on data generated by the Applicant from a single dose, PK profiling 
study in 20 WD patients (TR-001 PK). In principle, this is considered an acceptable approach for a full 
mixed application.  
Study TR-001 PK was conducted to fulfil requirements outlined in the EMA protocol assistance (2007 and 
2012) in order to fulfil gaps on trientine PK documentation identified in the available literature. The aim 
was to establish a dose-exposure-response relationship and thereby support dosing recommendations in 
the PI, especially (but not exclusively) in special populations.  
This study shows several deficiencies with regard to overall planning, conduct and reporting of the study 
hampering interpretation of the results (please refer to the above sections for details).  
The patient population was inhomogeneous and no measures to take the differences into account were 
taken in the statistical plan and the evaluation of study results. The impact of age or food intake on the PK 
of Cufence cannot be properly assessed. Due to the lack of clinical data with regard to a possible food 
effect of Cufence, the Applicant proposes to bring the instructions on food effect in the SmPC in line with 
the current European guideline (to take Cufence on an empty stomach, at least one hour before meals or 
two hours after meals, and at least one hour apart from any other medicinal product, food or milk). These 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 41/96 
 
 
 
 
seem to be conservative and are considered acceptable. Thus, it is proposed that trientine should be 
taken 1 hour prior or two hours after meals.  
It is however, noted that e.g. for a four times daily regimen these recommendations result in a very strict 
timetables for the patients concerning food intake and trientine dosing which may have an impact on 
compliance. A conclusion which can be drawn on the pharmacokinetic properties of Cufence is that, as 
previously reported in the literature, absorption seems to be low and variable in WD patients and healthy 
volunteers, with tmax occurring between 0.5 to 4 hours post-dose. Exposure is variable between subjects 
and elimination of trientine occurs rather fast (t1/2 median 3.6 hours).  
Available exposure data revealed also high variability across all age cohorts with a less pronounced inter- 
individual variability in the paediatric cohort. Large difference between the adult and paediatric patients 
were observed even for the dose normalized parameters. Thus, the Cmax /D ranged from 1.03 to 2.16 
(ng/mL)/(mg) (2.10-fold range) in the paediatric patients and from 0.843 to 5.63 (ng/mL)/(mg) (6.7-fold 
range) in the adult patients. The dose-normalised AUC0-t ranged from 5.01 to 8.96 (ng/mL.h)/(mg) 
(1.8-fold range) in the paediatric patients and from 2.06 to 23.9 (ng/mL.h)/(mg) (11.6-fold range) in the 
adult patients. However, the CHMP acknowledged that the study design and the conduct of the study limit 
the assessment of this issue. Concerning tmax no marked difference between the paediatric and adult 
patients (but also high variability) was found: tmax ranged from 0.5 to 4.08 hours for children compared 
to 0.48 to 3 hours in adults (this is adequately reflected in the product information).  
In conclusion, study TR-001 PK was not adequately designed to evaluate a dose response (as no relevant 
PD parameters were measured) and hence, results do not allow a thorough characterisation of the PK/PD 
profile of trientine/Cufence. Considering the limitations of the study, the Applicant has committed to 
further evaluate the dose response post marketing with a PK/PD (sub)-study in the planned PAES (see 
Section 4). 
The absolute bioavailability of trientine is unknown and there is no mass balance study in humans to 
confirm that there are no other metabolism pathways or metabolites of importance formed. The Applicant 
summarized the available literature with this respect and adequately discussed the clinical context of the 
non-clinical oxidative metabolism pathway study APT-REP-01. The lack of a formal mass balance study in 
humans is still unaccounted for, yet is unlikely to have a clinical impact on the benefit/risk balance of the 
product. 
It is expected that due to lack of interferences between trientine and biological processes, inhibition and 
induction of CYP450 isoenzymes will not occur. However, there is no literature data regarding the 
potential of trientine to inhibit or induce CYP450 isoenzymes. To partially address this issue, the Applicant 
submitted in vitro data in order to investigate the trientine´s potential to inhibit or induce CYP450 
enzymes and cause potential drug-drug interactions (APT-REP-01 study). Trientine showed no in vitro 
inhibition or induction, which is consistent with it not being a substrate for CYP450.  Given the absence of 
any evidence for the involvement of CYP450 in trientine metabolism from in vitro metabolism, inhibition 
and induction studies or from in vivo metabolite profiling, no further investigation is considered 
necessary, in accordance with the EMA Guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interactions.  
The Applicant’s claims based on literature data that MAT and DAT are both inactive metabolites which is 
not entirely supported. The statement is also not in line with information of another approved trientine 
product where it is stated that “MAT may also participate to the overall clinical activity of Cuprior, however 
the extent of MAT to the overall effect of Cuprior on copper levels remains to be determined.” Thus, to 
further understand more the pharmacological properties of the drug, the pharmacokinetic profile of 
trientine (incl. N(1)-acetyltriethylenetetramine (MAT) and N(1),N(10)-diacetyltriethylenetetramine 
(DAT)) and the direct response of copper parameters after trientine exposure will be investigated in the 
PAES. 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 42/96 
 
 
Bibliographical data 
The overall extent and quality of available literature on trientine PK is limited.  
Available literature on trientine indicates an interaction with food in animals and healthy volunteers. 
When taken together with food, bioavailability of trientine was decreased by 1/8 in dogs compared to a 
fasted control group (Tanno et al. 2008). Oral administration of 1500 mg TETA 2HCl in a fed healthy 
volunteer reduced the Cmax (from 3.8 to 1.5 mg/L), delayed tmax (from 2 to 4 h) and prolonged t1/2 (from 
4 to 8 h) (Nakano et al. 2009) vs the fasted state.  
This stands in contrast to the Applicant’ own results (no influence of food was detected); however, the 
food effect was not investigated in Study TR-001 PK according to state of the art. 
Some other reports that investigated trientine in healthy subjects and WD patients reported that the 
absorption rate in the gut after oral trientine administration is relatively low (8-30% according to Lu et al. 
2010a). The reported tmax values range from 0.8 to 4 hours. A large variance of Cmax has been seen among 
different individuals with Wilson's disease. Cmax variability seems to be less profound in healthy volunteers 
(on the same dose of 600 mg trientine) (EASL 2012).  
None of the historical investigations seems sensitive enough to reliably investigate the impact of intrinsic- 
or extrinsic factors on trientine PK. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Information on trientine’s primary pharmacology is sparse. Available literature (e.g. Hill et al. 1986, Fox 
2008, Crisponi 2010, Siegemund et al. 1991) indicates that trientine may have a dual mechanism of 
action; (i) by promoting urinary copper excretion and (ii) by reducing copper absorption from the 
gastrointestinal tract (and thus promoting faecal copper excretion). Based on the available data a precise 
quantification of the role of intestinal luminal chelation to the efficacy of trientine is not possible, but its 
contribution is considered rather low. 
Non-clinical data indicates the existence of secondary pharmacological effects of trientine. The literature 
data on secondary pharmacodynamics was adequately discussed and summarized.  
In both submitted clinical studies, only limited PD data was collected:  
Study TR-001 PK:  
The only PD parameters evaluated were serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels (measured for 8 hours 
primarily to support Cufence safety). Results do not allow evaluating trientine dose-proportionality and 
serum concentration-proportional effects on enhancing copper excretion and adequately describing the 
dose response relationship. Thus, available data from this study are not appropriate to support dose 
recommendations in the PI or adequately describe the dose response relationship for Cufence. 
Study UNV-TRI-002:  
Measurement of copper storage metabolism at each time point after initiation of trientine treatment was 
defined as an objective. An increase of urinary copper as a result of treatment with trientine would be a 
good indicator of effect and allow making assumptions on dose response relationship. Change in 24-hour 
urine copper excretion over the course of trientine treatment was evaluated in some selected patients, 
but did not show good correspondence with target ranges as outlined in relevant guidelines.   
Trientine has complex interactions with dietary metals other than copper such as iron and zinc and they 
may inhibit one another’s absorption and even cause deficiency states. The drug-interactions of trientine 
with zinc may cause adverse events in addition to altering its pharmacokinetics. Such interactions are 
difficult to explore and the literature is sparse with this regard. In practice, the problem is dealt with by 
careful timing of medications in relation to one another. Due to the limited data on concomitant use with 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 43/96 
 
 
Zinc no specific dose recommendations can be made and the combination of trientine with zinc is not 
recommended. Concomitant oral iron or other heavy metals should be administered at a different time 
than trientine to prevent the formation of complexes as mentioned in the SmPC.  
Trientine as a chelating agent may reduce calcium and magnesium antacid effect. There is no evidence 
that calcium and magnesium antacids alter the efficacy of trientine but, as this cannot be excluded, it is 
recommended to separate administration of trientine and calcium and magnesium antacids by at least 
two hours (antacids should be taken after meals). This recommendation is made in the summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC). 
The effectiveness of trientine in removing excessive Cu from the body in WD patients is not questioned as 
it is substantiated by decades of experience in clinical practice.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Dedicated studies to investigate the relationships between dose/titration schemes and relevant PD 
markers in patients (adult and paediatric) were not conducted. Cufence posology as proposed in the PI is 
therefore mainly based on the well-established use of the substance since more than 30 years and 
supported by recommendations in clinical treatment guidelines.  
Clinical pharmacology data for trientine in the literature is sparse and Study TR-001 PK was not 
adequately designed to establish a dose-exposure-response relationship and thereby gaps in knowledge 
remain on dosing recommendations, especially (but not exclusively) in special populations. Therefore 
available data does not allow a thorough characterisation of the PK/PD profile of trientine/Cufence. 
Titration to target and expert prescription setting in this rare life threatening disease is taken into account 
for this marketing authorisation application and further PK/PD data needs to be provided post 
authorisation in particular on patients in the up-titration phase and in children where the current data is 
particularly limited in order to confirm or improve the dosing and titration recommendations in the PI. It 
is also noted that differences between the adult and paediatric patients were observed even for the dose 
normalized parameters and treatment in children might require lower (starting) doses or more 
conservative titration. There could be different requirements of copper (and thus trientine) in different 
age cohorts due to developmental status that might also require a relative adaption of doses for juvenile 
individuals. Therefore, also children from 5 years onwards should be included in the proposed PAES to 
further investigate the dose-exposure-response relationship in children. This study is imposed in line with 
Article 1(2)c of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 357/2014. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
Post-Authorisation Efficacy Study (PAES): In order to further characterise the efficacy of trientine 
dihydrochloride in the treatment of Wilson’s disease in patients with predominantly hepatic, neurologic or 
psychiatric symptoms as well as in paediatric patients, the MAH should conduct and submit the results of 
an open label, prospective study to investigate the clinical course of hepatic, neurological and psychiatric 
disease from the time of initiation of treatment with trientine dihydrochloride up to 24 months of therapy. 
The study will also contain a PK/PD sub-study to evaluate the dose-response relationship especially 
during the up-titration phase. The study should be conducted according to an agreed protocol.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
There are no dedicated dose response studies available for trientine in Wilsons’s disease.  
The dosing regimen is 4-8 capsules; 1200 to 2400 mg (equivalent to 800-1600mg trientine base) daily 
divided in two to four doses. For children, a lower dose of 2-5 capsules; 0.6-1.5 grams (0.4-1 gram 
trientine base) was proposed for initiation of therapy. Adapted dosing according to the patient’s clinical 
response is advised for patients and no separate proposal for maintenance therapy in children is made. 
This regimen is in line with  the SmPC of the nationally licensed Trientine dihydrochloride 300 mg capsules 
(200 mg trientine base) in UK since more than 30 years.  
It is stated that trientine is titrated to target albeit the dose recommendations are mainly based on clinical 
experience. The dose/exposure relationship was not thoroughly investigated in study TR-001 PK. Only 
one (individual) dose was applied under study conditions and no PD parameters useful to evaluate dose 
response were collected. The study has significant shortcomings in trial design and conduct and 
consequently provides little relevant information on pharmacokinetics. No Pop-PK was carried out, 
although this was recommended in the CHMP protocol assistance procedures.  
The AASLD and EASL guidelines slightly differ in their dose recommendations; they are aligned with the 
posology of the product available in the respective area. In the EU, guidelines usually refer to titration in 
300 mg TETA steps according to the UK-licensed Univar’s trientine (a 300 mg TETA capsule), which has 
been the only available trientine product in the EU for many years. Cufence was developed in line with the 
UK product (i.e. 300 mg TETA per capsule corresponding to 200 mg trientine base). Treatment in 
children, who might require lower (starting) doses or more conservative titration steps, would benefit 
from lower capsule strengths/ appropriate formulation as outlined in previous CHMP protocol assistance. 
The Applicant claims that trientine exposure is highly variable and thus dosing is highly individual. They 
also claim that respective PD parameters such as 24-h UCE or NCC are highly variable within patients. The 
possible causes for the observed high variabilities are however unknown and could also be due to the lack 
of applying standardisation measures for copper intake, food & beverages, concomitant zinc, measuring 
time points, etc., in the respective studies. It is however agreed that urinary copper excretion rates (UCE) 
and serum copper concentrations are not ideal parameters by which to monitor the benefit of trientine 
therapy alone, and that clinical parameters need to be taken into account.  
However, some conclusions on the relationship of trientine and these PD parameters could be made based 
on the information provided in the dossier: 
-  Under trientine (and also D-PA) therapy, the 24-h urinary copper excretion (UCE) rates are higher 
when measured during treatment than after a 48-h dose interruption. This allows the conclusion that 
trientine promotes urinary copper excretion. 
- 
Trientine is used in patients intolerant to D-Penicillamine. These patients are not necessarily fully 
de-coppered and this process can take many years. The behaviour of laboratory copper parameters 
such as 24-UCE or non-ceruloplasmin bound copper (NCC) in relation to trientine treatment seems 
influenced by the de-coppering status/total copper load of the patient. After long-term therapy, in 
patients that are thought to be de-coppered, copper excretion in urine is lower compared to earlier 
measuring time points.  
-  Availability of free copper in the serum and also the rate of copper excretion can significantly increase 
at initiation of therapy in patients with high copper loads (especially when receiving high trientine 
doses), which can result in negative clinical effects such as neurological deterioration and be reflected 
in worsening of laboratory parameters. According to the Applicant, in clinical practice patients with 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 45/96 
 
 
higher copper loads are initially prescribed higher doses of trientine. Therefore, clear and precise 
titration rules for such cases would be desirable. For patients with neurological symptoms ‘up-titration 
with moderation’ and ‘close monitoring’ are recommended in the SmPC as these patients are at risk 
of neurological deterioration at treatment initiation, especially when the starting dose is high.  
- 
To characterise the relationship between dose and PD-response, the 24-h UCE and NCC values 
measured in study UNV-TRI-002 (retrospective and prospective part) were analysed and put into 
context with the respective doses. These analyses reveal overall, that the 24-h UCE and NCC levels 
collected in UNV-TRI-002 did not show good correspondence with the proposed target ranges from 
the literature in the retrospective dataset; for reasons unknown, a slightly better correspondence was 
seen over a shorter time frame in the prospective dataset for reasons unknown. The 24-h UCE values 
were often below the lower proposed limit of 3 µmol per 24-h (and even more often below 3.2 µmol). 
The AASLD guideline states that values of UCE below 200 mg/day (3.2 mmol/day) may indicate either 
non-adherence to therapy or overtreatment and excess copper removal. NCC levels in the 
retrospective datasets are also rather low, which could also be interpreted as indicating 
overtreatment. Overall, the data on 24-h UCE and NCC from the retrospective dataset suggests that 
many patients might have been treated with too high doses.  
Overall, it seems that 24-h UCE in study UNV-TRI-002 was not meant as a parameter for titration 
guidance and its meaningfulness for dose titration in clinical practice remains unclear. The same holds 
true for NCC measures. It seems that the clinical picture was more important for the treating 
practitioners. Taken together, these observations emphasize that the dose-exposure-response is not well 
understood and that there is a need for better data.  
A prospective study under controlled circumstances (i.e. ensuring treatment compliance and copper 
intake) in patients at different levels of de-coppering (different copper loads), and investigation of 
parameters sensitive to depict treatment success (or failure) would be necessary to fully elucidate the 
exposure-response relationship of trientine in WD. The Applicant agreed to generate these data 
post-marketing within a PAES; an open label, multicentre, prospective study investigating efficacy and 
safety outcomes as well as PK and PD parameters in the first 24 months after initiation of treatment with 
trientine in 30-50 Wilson’s Disease patients 5 years and older who have previously been treated with 
D-Penicillamine. 
Currently the guidance on therapeutic monitoring as stated in the proposed Cufence PI reflects the 
recommendations from available treatment guidelines.  It is emphasized that treatment should only be 
initiated by specialist physicians with experience in the management of Wilson’s disease, and in clinical 
practice, these patients are usually closely monitored and followed in specialised centres.

Page 46/96 
 
 
3. Documented treatment with D-penicillamine, withdrawal of treatment with D-penicillamine, followed 
by treatment with trientine for at least 6 months at date of informed consent 
4. Able/willing to provide written informed consent. 
Exclusion Criteria: 
1. Incomplete history of medication use for trientine from initial diagnosis to last follow-up 
2. Unavailable outcome data for hepatic and neurological course of disease at initiation of treatment with 
trientine and at least 1 time point post-initiation of treatment with trientine 
Treatments 
This was a retrospective study based on information obtained from the medical records of patients 
already attending major tertiary care centres for the treatment of Wilson disease. As such, no 
investigative products were managed or dispensed solely for the purpose of this part of the study. All 
patients have been prescribed treatment with trientine 300 mg capsules commercially available from 
Univar, UK (PL 41626/0001). 
The approved daily dose of trientine, according to the current Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC; UK SmPC, 2016), is 1,200 – 2,400 mg/day in 2-4 divided doses for adults, and a lower dose, 
typically 600 – 1500 mg/day, depending on age and body weight, for children.  
The study medication was oral treatment with trientine (for at least 6 months as second line treatment 
after receiving D-penicillamine as first line). The given dose is highly patient-specific, variable and subject 
to constant review and change according to the patients’ signs, symptoms and copper levels and was 
selected at the investigator’s discretion according to the patient’s needs. 
Objectives 
The objectives were to: 
• Assess the clinical course of copper (Cu) stores, neurological disease, and hepatic disease following 
initiation of treatment with trientine following withdrawal of D-penicillamine. Retrospective data were 
collected from visits at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months after initiation of treatment, and at the last available 
follow-up visit. Assessments were based on the Investigator’s score (unchanged, improved but not 
normal, improved to normal, asymptomatic over duration of therapy, and worsened) 
• Assess the safety of trientine treatment based on reported adverse events (AEs), including AEs leading 
to discontinuation of treatment with trientine 
• Determine duration of treatment with second line therapy trientine, defined as time to discontinuation 
of treatment due to AEs and/or inadequate response.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: 
Clinical outcome for each time point after initiation of trientine treatment based on clinical course of 
neurological and hepatic disease 
The clinical course of neurological and hepatic disease for each available time point after initiation of 
treatment (6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months, and at the last available time point while taking second line 
trientine) was scored (Investigator’s score) based on the status at the time of initiating trientine as: 
1 = Unchanged 
2 = Improved but not normal 
3 = Improved to normal 
4 = Asymptomatic over duration of therapy 
5 = Worsened. 
The following efficacy endpoints were assessed: 
• The clinical course of hepatic disease at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months, and at the last available time point 
while taking second line trientine, based on the Investigator’s scores outlined above and based on hepatic 
status at the time of initiating trientine 
• The clinical course of neurological disease at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months, and at the last available time 
point while taking second line trientine, based on the Investigator’s scores outlined above and based on 
neurological status at the time of initiating trientine  
Cu storage and metabolism measurement at each time point after initiation of trientine treatment (see 
section on “Pharmacodynamics” of this report) 
• Cu storage and metabolism measured at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months and at the last available time point 
after initiation of trientine, by available tests, e.g. 24-hour urinary Cu excretion, serum ceruloplasmin 
(CPN), serum Cu, were compared to Cu storage values at the time of initiating trientine. 
Time to discontinuation of treatment due to AE and/or inadequate response 
The time to discontinuation of trientine due to AE and/or inadequate response was assessed as follows: 
• Time to discontinuation of trientine due to AEs 
• Time to discontinuation of trientine due to inadequate response measured by poor clinical outcome 
(failure to stabilise or reverse signs and symptoms) where: 
 
Inadequate hepatic response was defined by: 
- 
- 
Progression to liver transplant 
Increase of at least 2 of 3 liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], 
alanine aminotransferase [ALT], gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase [GGT]) ≥ 2 x 
normal or ≥ 2 x baseline 
- 
Increase of 24-hour urinary Cu excretion when collected in 2 consecutive 
measurements 
 
Inadequate neurological response was defined by neurological deterioration (physician’s 
decision) 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019

• Time to discontinuation of trientine due to AEs and/or inadequate response measured by poor clinical 
outcome 
Patient treatment status at the last available time point 
  Treatment status 
 
If trientine stopped: 
- 
Reason for discontinuing 
-  When trientine discontinued 
 
Initiation of any new treatments for Wilson disease 
Safety: 
Adverse events related to trientine treatment and AEs leading to discontinuation of trientine were 
assessed at each available study time point. 
Sample size 
Number of Patients (Planned and Analysed): 
The sample size was planned to comprise approximately 90 patients in total. The number of patients was 
dictated by the estimated size of the patient population to be studied and was an approximation based on 
the number of eligible patients in participating European Union centres. 
A retrospective study examining the medical records on physician-confirmed Wilson disease cases from 
large tertiary care centres throughout Europe was expected to provide sufficient numbers of patients for 
analysis. The study is designed as a single group cohort study to include approximately 90 patients. The 
number of patients is dictated by the estimated size of the patient population to be studied and is an 
approximation based on the number of eligible patients in participating European Union (EU) centres. 
Inclusion criteria are in alignment with the proposed indication, defining the underlying population as 
D-penicillamine-intolerant patients. Due to the low disease incidence, adequate statistical power cannot 
be obtained, therefore only descriptive analysis will be performed on the safety and efficacy measures 
and changes will be compared with baseline values. The before/after single group cohort design is applied 
due to the lack of adequate comparison group. 
Univar and investigators had the right to close a site at any time, although only after consultation between 
the involved parties. In case of site closure, the IEC and the competent regulatory authority were to be 
informed and all study materials were to be returned to Univar. 
Univar had the right to terminate the entire study prematurely at any time. 
It was allowed to stop recruitment at an individual site for reasons of particularly low recruitment, 
protocol non-compliance, non-compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) according to the ICH-GCP, or 
inadequate data recording. 
Randomisation 
There was no comparator/control group and no randomisation carried out. 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 50/96 
 
 
 
Blinding (masking) 
No blinding was foreseen in this uncontrolled trial and neither patients nor treating physicians or other 
staff members were blinded and no central reading of findings/results from treatment visits is available. 
Statistical methods 
This was a non-randomised study. One single population was used for all data summaries and analysis 
presentations, corresponding to all patients who met the criteria for inclusion and exclusion. 
No interim analysis was planned. 
No primary endpoint was identified; conclusions from this study were based on the full extent of efficacy 
and safety results. 
Analysis presentations in terms of summary statistics were focused on illustrating the efficacy, safety and 
tolerability of trientine chelator therapy in patients withdrawn from D-penicillamine treatment due to 
efficacy, safety, tolerability, or other reasons.  
No formal statistical comparisons were performed and only descriptive methods were applied. 
Continuous variables were summarised using n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and 
maximum values. Categorical variables were summarised using counts and percentages. Time to event 
variables were based on Kaplan-Meier estimation. The baseline value for each patient to be presented in 
summary tables was defined to be the last non-missing assessment value for a patient for that particular 
parameter that was recorded prior to the initiation of trientine treatment. 
All collected information as a minimum was included in patient listings. Any unscheduled visit results were 
included in patient listings only, noting that scheduled visit results corresponded to data collecting falling 
within the ± 2-month visit window. 
For the time to discontinuation endpoints only, data was presented (summaries only, no statistical 
testing) for those patients who were symptomatic, as defined at baseline. Only treatment-emergent AEs 
(TEAEs) were considered for the safety endpoints of this study. All TEAEs were summarised and listed for 
this study. In addition, related TEAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment with trientine were 
summarised. 
All other safety data were presented in patient listings only. With the listings of biochemistry, 
haematology, urinalysis and pathology data, any clinically significant abnormal laboratory values were 
identified within the listings against the parameter values. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 81 patients were enrolled into the retrospective part of the study. However, four patients were 
excluded from the intention to treat (ITT) population, as according to the dosage documented in the 
patient’s medical record they had received non-Univar trientine at initiation of trientine instead of Univar’s 
trientine. 
Recruitment 
Data were collected from dates between 15 Jul 2016 and 10 Apr 2017 in 4 centres in Germany, Greece, 
Italy and UK.

Conduct of the study 
Data Management/ Data Collection 
Data collection in the retrospective part of the study covered a historical time period of approximately 48 
months. Data was collected at time points of 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months after initiation of treatment, as 
available. Data from the last available time point were also assessed. 
Patient data were collected on CRFs (paper) and were substantiated by patient medical records and 
source documents at the clinical site. Where source documents (such as laboratory reports and medical 
records) or laboratory databases existed, all relevant data were transcribed into the CRF and transferred 
electronically with independent double entry to the study database by data entry personnel. 
Completed CRFs were reviewed to ensure data accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Any 
discrepancies found during the CRF review were to be clarified by a corresponding query to the 
Investigator (or his/her designated staff). This included CRF reviews at the site by the Sponsor or its 
designee, or during quality assurance review of the data. 
Case Report Form Completion 
A CRF was completed for each patient from available source documents (e.g., laboratory reports and 
medical records). The CRF documented the laboratory tests and clinical features used to confirm 
diagnosis, summarised the history of treatment for Wilson disease, and listed the AEs as well as clinical 
laboratory and examination findings reported during treatment with trientine. 
Data Processing 
A database constructed from the CRFs was validated both manually and electronically. Clarification of 
data was requested from the study sites as required. The database was quality-assured and was available 
for statistical analysis. 
Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analyses 
The calculation of patient age differed from the planned analyses. Age was recorded based on the date of 
informed consent rather than at the start of treatment with trientine. 
The following additional analyses were defined by the final SAP: 
1) The following laboratory efficacy parameters were added: 
• Proportion of patients with all transaminases (ALT, AST, GGT) within the normal range at each available 
time point 
• Proportion of patients with all transaminases (ALT, AST, GGT) and all additional liver values (total 
bilirubin, albumin, INR) within the normal range at each available time point 
• Proportion of patients with anaemia, defined as haemoglobin value below the lower limit of normal, at 
each available time point 
2) Subgroup analyses by the following criteria were added for some of the analyses: 
• Sex (male, female) 
• Presentation at diagnosis (hepatic, neurologic, hepatic and neurologic, asymptomatic) 
• Presentation at initiation of trientine (hepatic, neurologic, hepatic and neurologic, asymptomatic) 
• Age group (age < 18 years, age ≥ 18 years) 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 52/96 
 
 
• Presence of liver cirrhosis (present, absent) in patients with hepatic or mixed presentation at initiation 
of trientine. 
3) The parameter non-CPN bound Cu (NCC) was added to the analysis of the Cu storage and metabolism. 
4) For the clinical laboratory parameters of haematology and biochemistry, standard descriptive 
summary statistics were calculated at each scheduled measuring time point and for the change from 
baseline to each scheduled measuring time point after baseline. 
5) Physical examination findings that were potentially related to Wilson disease were summarised by visit. 
Baseline data 
Descriptive statistics of demographics (age, sex, weight, height, ethnic origin) and baseline 
characteristics (relating to diagnosis) are presented. 
The mean age (standard deviation [SD]) was 35.6 years (17.74 [range: 8 to 67 years]) and the majority 
(90.9%) of patients were Caucasian. There were more female patients than male patients (59.7% vs 
40.3%). Of the 77 patients included in the ITT population, 16 (20.8%) patients were paediatric patients 
(aged <18 years). It should be noted that based on the year of birth provided there were 6 patients that 
were under the age of 8 at the start of trientine. Of these 6 patients, 3 patients were either 4 or 5 years 
of age. 
The diagnosis of Wilson disease was supported by the results of the family screening in 18 (23.4%) 
patients. A total Ferenci Score of >3 confirmed Wilson disease diagnosis for this study. A Ferenci Score at 
baseline was available for 77 patients. All of these patients had a Ferenci Score of >3. Duration of 
Treatment with D-penicillamine was reported in 20 patients of the ITT population; mean duration was 
10.3 (± 25.41) months. The most common reasons for withdrawal of D-penicillamine was due to AEs (58 
[75.3%] patients) and no clinical improvement (12 [15.6%] patients).

Medical History 
Seventy-three (73 [94.8%]) patients had at least 1 disease/event reported in their medical history. 
Splenomegaly was the disease recorded most often, i.e. in 19 (24.7%) patients. Osteopenia was recorded 
with second highest frequency, i.e. in 14 (18.2%) patients.

Concomitant medication: 
Seventy-three (73 [94.8%]) patients reported intake of medication other than trientine. Drugs from the 
class of mineral supplements were named as concomitant medication most frequently (in 40 [51.9%] 
patients). The second highest frequency was found for the class of vitamins (in 35 [45.5%] patients). 
Intake of zinc acetate, zinc sulphate and zinc was reported by 17 (22.1%), 16 (20.8%) and 7 (9.1%) 
patients, respectively. In table below, drugs are listed by anatomical therapeutical chemical (ATC) Level 
2 Classification and preferred term if they were used by at least 4 patients.

Ferenci Score 
A total Ferenci Score of >3 confirmed Wilson disease diagnosis for this study. A Ferenci Score at baseline

Numbers analysed 
A total of 81 patients were enrolled into the study, however 4 patients (4.9%) did not meet the inclusion 
criteria. Therefore, a total of 77 (95.1%) patients were included in the ITT population.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Clinical course of hepatic disease  
Over the course of trientine treatment, hepatic symptoms ‘improved to normal’ in 17 (22.1%) patients 
and were ‘improved but not normal’ in 21 (27.3%) patients, leading to a total of 38 (49.4%) patients 
showing improved hepatic symptoms, with 27 (35.1%) patients ‘asymptomatic’, 8 (10.4%) patients 
‘unchanged’ and 4 (5.2%) patients with ‘worsened symptoms’. Hepatic outcome was generally similar 
after 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months of treatment.

with 36 (46.8%) patients ‘asymptomatic’, 28 (36.4%) patients ‘unchanged’ and 2 (2.6%) patients with 
‘worsened symptoms’. Overall, neurological outcome was similar after 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months of 
treatment.

Figure 4 Neurological outcome Over Time (ITT) 
General laboratory parameters 
Although the majority of patients did not have ALT, AST, GGT or all transaminases (ALT, AST, GGT) and 
total bilirubin, albumin and INR within normal range at the 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 month and follow up visits; 
the majority of values outside of the normal range were not considered clinically relevant by the 
Applicant. These values were considered to reflect acceptable findings in patients with chronic liver 
disease. There were no observable trends over time in biochemistry and haematology.  
Values are available from a fraction of patients at each time point and no reference values are stated. 
Observed reduction in alanine aminotransferase (and to a lesser degree aspartate aminotransferase) 
could be considered a treatment success. , No relevant changes were observed on other laboratory 
parameters.  
Copper storage and metabolism  
A change in 24-hour urine Cu excretion over the course of trientine treatment could only be determined 
for 10 patients, with 7 showing a decrease, indicating efficacy, and 3 showing an increase, which could be 
linked to mobilisation of Cu.  Although the method used in derivation of the non-ceruloplasmin bound Cu 
(NCC) concentration limits the value of this parameter in interpretation of efficacy, overall the median 
NCC concentration showed a decrease from baseline on each testing time point, with the exception of 48 
months.  
A patient’s Cu burden can be evaluated by 24-hour urine Cu excretion during a treatment-free period, 
whereas urine Cu excretion measured whilst patients are receiving trientine treatment will reflect the 
trientine dose. Much of the retrospective urine Cu data was collected whilst patients were receiving 
trientine treatment and in many cases dose levels changed over the duration of treatment. 
Treatment-free urine Cu data are available on more than one time point for only 10 patients. Of these

patients, 7 showed a decrease in 24-hour urine Cu excretion between the 2 time points, indicating 
efficacy, whereas 3 showed an increase, which could be linked to mobilisation of Cu. 
Serum ceruloplasmin and total serum Cu are not, in themselves, indicative of efficacy, although both are 
likely to be below normal levels in Wilson disease patients. Concentrations of serum ceruloplasmin and 
total serum Cu are used to derive the concentration of NCC using the following equation:  
NCC (μmol/L) = Serum Copper (μmol/L) – [47.2 x Serum Ceruloplasmin (g/L)]. 
As a derived parameter, NCC has limitations, particularly with the low serum ceruloplasmin 
concentrations in Wilson disease patients being close to the limit of quantification of the assay method. As 
a result, it is acknowledged that approximately 20% of NCC results will be theoretically impossible 
negative values [Twomey et al. 2005]. Although the limitations of the derived NCC concentration mean 
this parameter should be treated with caution, the median NCC concentration showed a decrease from 
baseline on each testing time point, with the exception of 48 months. Subgroup analyses of the results 
from parameters of Cu storage and metabolism by gender, diagnosis, initiation of trientine, age group and 
presence of liver cirrhosis for patients with hepatic or mixed presentation at initiation of trientine are 
provided.  No clear trend was seen in the subgroup analyses. 
Table 12 
Bibliographical data 
Detailed PD data is sparse, but in the study by Cho et al. (2009), increased cupruresis compared to 
baseline and placebo was observed following single and multiple doses of 200, 600, 1200 and 3600 
mg/day of TETA 2HCl (Protemix). Doses of 1200 mg/day (salt) or above produce a marked and consistent 
increase in urine copper excretion. Copper was excreted at the highest rate in the 0- to 2-hour interval 
following dosing, and the excretion decreased in each subsequent 2-hour interval. The mean 0- to 4-hour 
Cufence - Assessment Report

Page 60/96 
 
 
 
 
  
cumulative urine copper excretion accounted for approximately 72% of the mean total 24-hour urine 
copper excretion. Urinary copper excretion showed a similar pattern on days 1, 7, and 14. Following the 
first dose of TETA on day 1, total urinary copper excretion increased in a dose-proportional manner. 
It also increases urinary excretion of zinc and iron. Urinary copper excretion is proportional to the dose of 
Trientine taken and varies significantly depending on glomerular filtration rate and sex (EASL 2012).  
Dosing/Titration curve over time and Treatment compliance 
Complete data sets from all predefined time points (6, 12, 24, 26, 48 months) are available only from a 
minority of the patients. The Applicant states that ‘Due to the nature of this retrospective study, 
treatment compliance could not be determined in detail’. All available data on trientine dose were used to 
generate an overview of the trientine dose per time point, which is presented in figure below. 
Figure 5 Trientine dose over time 
Figure 5 indicates the following: 
1. Mean starting doses were in general lower than mean maintenance doses and up-titration to 
maintenance doses occurred within the first 6 months.  
2. Maintenance doses are relatively stable over time  
3. Doses between 300mg TETA and 2700mg TETA were used in the study, but it is unknown how many 
patients received each dose (e.g. 300mg TETA doses and 2700mg TETA doses), why especially low or 
high doses were used (these doses were outside of the range of the SmPC of the UK product) or why the 
dose was not up-titrated in some patients initially receiving 300mg TETA.  
4. Mean starting doses are below 20mg/kg indicating that the proposed paediatric dose/kg is higher than 
what is used for starting doses in adults. 
It was noticed that the maximum doses reported in figure 3 were not in line with what was reported as 
maximum doses in this study in the initial submission. The Applicant clarified that the maximum dose of 
2100 mg presented in Table 14.1.3.1 of the CSR of Study UNV-TRI-002 was the maximum dose used at 
the beginning of trientine treatment. The dose of 2700 mg, as displayed in figure 3 was the maximum 
dose observed during the 48 months period.  
EASL GL states that typical doses of trientine are 900–2700 mg day in two or three divided doses, with 
900–1500 mg/day used for maintenance therapy. This seems to indicate that higher doses of trientine 
can be used at treatment initiation, and would somewhat contradict the findings from study UNV-TRI- 002

discussed above and the Applicant’s postulated: ‘start low and go slow’ approach. It remains unknown in 
what situations doses on the upper end of the proposed dose range (Cufence SmPC or EASL) are 
indicated. The current dosing proposal is in line with what is approved in the SmPC for the nationally 
approved Trientine dihydrochloride 300mg capsules (200mg trientine base) in UK since more than 30 
years, however.  
Analyses of temporary treatment discontinuation for all included patients were not provided. This is 
because no exposure data are available from the study participants to inform on treatment compliance. 
Treatment compliance is a known issue for trientine therapy (patients have to take up to 4 doses a day 
and the product should be stored in a refrigerator) appropriate precautionary statements were included in 
the product information.

Efficacy was estimated based on a non-validated 5-category scoring system 
(improved  to  normal,  improved  but  not  normal,  asymptomatic,  unchanged 
and worsened), the underlying source data are unknown and so is the way the 
clinical  data  were  translated  into  the  score.  The  analysis  indicate  a 
‘comparison  to  baseline’  but  no  baseline  data  are  reported.  Efficacy  results 
based on this analysis are not considered reliable.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No dedicated studies in special populations are available. Of the 77 patients included in UNV-TRI-002, 16 
(20.8%) patients were paediatric patients (aged <18 years). There were 6 patients under the age of 8 at 
the start of trientine. Of these 6 patients, 3 patients were either 4 or 5 years of age. The oldest included 
patient was 67. The proposed lower age limit for Cufence is 5 years. 
The majority of WD patients are suffering from impaired hepatic function. No information on patients with 
renal impairment is available. There is only very limited data for elderly patients. According to the SmPC 
no specific dose adjustment is required in these patients.

Supportive studies 
Prospective part of study UNV-TRI-002  
The study report of the prospective part of the study was submitted during the course of the procedure. 
This investigation is a continuation of the retrospective part of UNV-TRI-002; the objectives and designs 
are similar in both parts, apart from an additional QoL objective included in the prospective part.  
Enrolment in the prospective part of the study was for 12 months, with data collection at ‘baseline’ and at 
6 and 12 months. ‘Baseline’ was defined as the last non-missing assessment value from the retrospective 
trial, and was thus variable for individual patients.  
All 52 included patients had also been enrolled in the retrospective part of the study, and were continued 
to be observed in a prospective fashion. The prospective part of the study was conducted in 1 centre in 
Germany in patients that gave consent. The total amount of patients studied in UNV-TRI-002 does not 
increase.  
Figure 6 (made by the assessor): Study UNV-TRI-002 observation scheme 
The clinical results were described by the same 5-point score as was applied in the retrospective part   
(see Discussion of efficacy below). 
PD parameters of interest measured in the prospective part are assessed in depth in the D180 JRAR and 
also discussed together with PD results from the retrospective part in the section ‘Dose-response studies 
and main clinical studies’ in this report.  
The only additional measure in this prospective part of the study was collection of QoL data; Index values 
for the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire and their changes from baseline were measured at baseline, month 6 and 
month 12.  
Clinical course of neurological disease 
Of the 51 patients included in the prospective analysis, the neurological symptoms improved but not to 
normal in eight patients (15.7 %), and improved to normal in one patient (2.0%). In 12 patients (23.5%) 
symptoms remained unchanged and there was one patient (2.0%) with worsening of neurological 
symptoms. A total of 29 (56.9%) patients were asymptomatic over the duration of therapy. 
The patient with the worsening neurological symptoms used a stable dose of 1200 mg/day trientine. This 
patient was asymptomatic at baseline, and neurological symptoms were increased at 12 months. 
UWDRS - Neurologic Subscale 
The mean score of the total neurological subscale of the UWDRS was 11.3 at baseline and decreased to 
9.7 in month 6 and 8.8 in month 12. This decrease was mainly due to changes in the subscore II (sum of 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 64/96 
 
 
 
 
 
all items of part III, the neurological part of the UWDRS), which decreased from 9.6 at baseline to 8.0 in 
month 6 and to 7.1 in month 12. The subscore I (sum of all items of parts I on consciousness and part II 
on disability of the UWDRS) remained virtually the same during the study (1.7 at baseline, 1.6 in month 
6 and 1.7 in month 12). 
The results of the neurological subscale of the UWDRS indicates a neurological improvement during 
treatment with trientine. 
Quality of Life – Anxiety/depression question  
Of the 51 patients 34 were not, 15 were moderately and two were extremely anxious or depressed at 
baseline. The number of extremely anxious or depressed patients remained the same during the 12 
month prospective study. The number of patients with moderate anxious or depressed state decreased 
from 15 to 11 at month 6 and to 9 at month 12, while the number of patients without anxiety or 
depression increased from 34 at baseline to 38 at month 6 and to 40 at month 12. These data indicate that 
overall, the anxiety and depression improved during treatment with trientine 
Adverse events  
Four patients (7.7%) reported a psychiatric adverse event; adjustment disorder, aggression, depression 
and drug abuse were each reported by one patient (1.9%). All four adverse events were considered to be 
unrelated to the study treatment. 
Note: The described doses are expressed as mg of trientine dihydrochloride salt (i.e. not in mg of the 
trientine base). 
Literature data 
Literature data on trientine (in WD) is one major cornerstone for this mixed marketing application. 
Therefore, particular attention is given to the provided literature search and identified publications. 
This application includes 133 literature references dated 1958-2017 to support clinical and preclinical 
parts of the dossier. Approximately 12 clinical studies were identified on the use of trientine in Wilson’s 
disease, as well as more than 12 reported case studies and more than 20 reviews on the use of trientine 
in the management of Wilson’s disease. However, no real rating of the relevance of individual publications 
for the present applications was made by the Applicant; identified literature considered relevant for 
clinical aspects was only listed under the heading ‘key studies’. In the course of the assessment of this 
procedure, further (older and also recent) relevant publications on WD were identified. 
Controlled trials with active or placebo comparison or trials testing different doses (apart from one study 
four Japanese patients who received increasing doses from 1.0 to 2.0 g/day to 2.5 to 3.0 g/day, (Saito et 
al., 1991)) or titration schemes are not included within the list of historical trials and such data might not 
be available. Only retrospective, single arm reviews and case reports are included.  
Studies from the Literature – Adults 
Identified literature has shortly been summarized to provide an overview of available data.  
Baseline characteristics for the populations included in the 6 retrospective cohort studies (Weiss et al., 
2013; Weiss et al., 2011a; Hölscher et al., 2010; Merle et al., 2007; Rodrigo Agudo et al., 2008, Sini et 
al., 2013) were described and from the information provided (no Ferenci scores are available) they seem 
to adequately reflect the target population of WD patients, apart from the fact that a part of included 
patients has used trientine as first line treatment. The same holds true for the patients from the case 
reports (five reports: Walshe, 1982: Scheinberg et al., 1987; Dahlman et al., 1995; Dubois et al., 1990; 
Saito et al., 1991). The total number of adult patients (using trientine for WD, first or second line) 
included in the 6 historical reviews is about 231, and 63 such patients were studies in the case reports. 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 65/96 
 
 
Altogether the literature database contains information from around 300 WD patients using trientine. 
Data on trientine second line use compiles around 200 patients. However, significant patient overlap 
between publications is assumed.The Applicant acknowledges the risk that data from some patient 
cohorts or individuals may have been reported more than once. This could be suspected for the following 
references (including, but not limited to): Weiss et al. 2013 and Weiss et al. 2011 and Merle et al., 2007, 
for Hölscher et al. 2010 and another Hölscher et al. 2010 publication as well as for the two publications 
from Scheinberger et al., both published 1987.  
The most significant of the submitted literature references is the publications by Weiss et al., 2013 as it 
included the vast majority of patients and reports the most details. There are suspected overlaps with the 
study population from study UNV-TRI-002.   
In Weiss et al. 2013 data on the effects on hepatic and neurologic symptoms and AEs were collected for 
a median of 13.3 years. Follow-up at 48 months showed that in symptomatic hepatic patients 
approximately 90% of patients improved, regardless of 1st line treatment received; additionally, when 
chelators were given as 2nd line therapy, rates of improvement were not statistically different between 
groups. D-penicillamine was associated with a higher incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation. Both 
drugs were not as effective in treating neurologic symptoms as in treating hepatic symptoms, which is in 
line with other observations on the topic. For evaluation of effect, the same 5 point evaluation score as 
used for assessment of UNV-TRI-002 results was used. The aim of this study was to evaluate safety of 
chelator therapy and respective long term outcomes. No formal objective or endpoint was defined.  
In Weiss et al., 2011a chelator therapy was compared to zinc in WD patients and zinc was found out to be 
less effective when looking at hepatic results and also survival. Effectiveness was mainly evaluated 
according to analyses of nonresponse to therapy and treatment discontinuations (including respective 
reasons). No objective or endpoint was defined. Some literature references indicate that a combination of 
therapies (trientine and zinc) could be beneficial. 
Another rather large cohort was observed by Merle et al., 2007, who also reviewed long term outcomes 
of WD patients. Side effects while under treatment where recorded and compared between 
D-penicillamine, trientine and zinc with trientine and zinc being significantly better tolerable.  For 
evaluation of hepatic and neurological symptoms over time it was not distinguished between the 
respective treatment options, but symptoms improved in the majority of patients. The authors claim that 
results show a similar survival of patients with Wilson’s disease when compared with a control population 
matched for age and sex. 
The number of WD patients treated with trientine as second line option from the other publications is 
small and not many details are available, however, the overall impression is that trientine does improve 
WD symptoms while appearing better tolerable than D-penicillamine.  
The quality of the provided historical investigations is low and often there is no information on the 
trientine product used, no information on applied dose was provided e.g. by Weiss et al. 2013 and 2011). 
Many patients received concomitant medications together with trientine (D-penicillamine or zinc) or used 
trientine as first line treatment. However, it is acknowledged that most of the trientine patients from 
these historical references used trientine for long periods (many years).  
Treatment outcomes, while not investigated by state of the art measures, were overall reported favorably 
for trientine as second line treatment. While the investigations were mostly not suitable to allow exact 
estimation of the treatment effect, they support the assumption that trientine is a recognized treatment 
that is widely used and well tolerated and improves survival. Trientine is mentioned in relevant treatment 
guidelines as state of the art therapy in Wilson’s disease (see table 2.7.3-7 (Table 14) for a summary of 
guideline recommendations).  
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 66/96 
 
 
 
Table 14 Recommendations for Treatment 
Guideline recommendations suggest that trientine may be better tolerated than D-penicillamine. It is 
noted that the two stated guideline documents (EASL and AASLD) discuss trientine primarily as treatment 
alternative to D-penicillamine rather than as second line treatment.  
Studies from the Literature - Children 
As for adults, the amount of data for second line use of trientine in paediatric WD patients is quite small 
and the quality of the publications is limited. The total number of patients (using trientine for WD) 
included in the 7 historical reviews cited above is about 50. It is acknowledged that paediatric patients 
were often included in the publications for adults, and thus, the actual extent of exposure might be a little 
bit larger. However, patient overlap cannot also be excluded for the paediatric references. 
Baseline characteristics for the paediatric populations included in the seven submitted studies (Arnon et 
al., 2007; Taylor et al., 2009; Avinashi and Ling, 2009; Dhawan et al., 2005; Manolaki et al., 2009; Sarles 
et al., 2001; Millard et al., 2015) indicated that from the information provided (no Ferenci scores are 
available) they adequately describe the target population (paediatric WD patients), apart from the fact 
that a part of included patients has used trientine as first line treatment. First line trientine use seems to 
be more common in paediatric patients compared to adults, probably due to the better tolerability 
compared to D-penicillamine. 
The symptoms of the observed children mostly improved under treatment and, if used as second-line 
after discontinuation of D-penicillamine, respective D-penicillamine side effects mostly resolved with 
trientine. Paediatric data confirm what has been seen in adults with this regard. For some children 
observed in these literature references observational periods of decades up to 37 years (Dhawan et al., 
2005)) are available. Considering that untreated WD is universally fatal, these life spans support the 
notion that chelation therapy improves survival in paediatric WD patients. Doses used are not always 
stated in the individual reports but seem to have been applied over a wide dose range.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The evidence base to support Cufence efficacy consists of post-hoc review of available data from various 
primary data sources, Study UNV-TRI-002 with a prospective and retrospective part and a review of 
bibliographical references. This is an acceptable approach in view of the applied legal basis (full mixed 
marketing application). This is also in line with the protocol assistance issued in 2012, where CHMP stated 
that a retrospective study and review of clinical experience, together with PK and PK/PD data, might be 
sufficient for a second-line indication.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
UNV-TRI-002  
The retrospective part of study UNV-TRI-002 was a multicenter review based on information obtained 
from the medical records of 77 patients that were already attending major tertiary care centers for the 
treatment of Wilson’s disease. Assessments were performed for 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48-month time points, 
as available. No control, blinding or randomization measures were introduced in the trial, which makes 
the design susceptible to confounding factors and bias. The number of paediatric patients included (n=16 
(20.8%)) is considered borderline sufficient to assess efficacy of Cufence in children with WD.  
Overlaps with the study population reported by Weiss et al. 2013, who studied WD patients in the same 
geographic area as the applicant cannot be excluded. Information flow between study centers and 
sponsor might have driven center selection, subject selection or time frame selection prior to protocol 
setup and selection of patients for study UNV-TRI-002 might have been data driven No evidence based 
selection of planned sample size (n=90) was performed. While the Applicant argues that all available 
patients that gave consent for participation in the study and met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were 
included for participation, it seems that there were no measures introduced in the data processing steps 
to protect against such bias (e.g. a selection after protocol setup).  
The prospective part of the study was conducted in one single centre in Germany and was a continuation 
of the retrospective part of UNV-TRI-002, including 52 patients that gave consent. The switch from the 
retrospective to the prospective observation part and its impact on the results is difficult to interpret. 
Enrolment in the prospective part of the study was for 12 months, with data collection at ‘baseline’ and at 
6 and 12 months. ‘Baseline’ was defined as the last non-missing assessment value from the retrospective 
trial, and was thus variable for individual patients.  
Treatments 
Patients were treated with trientine according to their usual regimen. While this is not optimal from a 
methodological point of view (as it introduces variability), it is one suitable option for a long-term 
investigation of trientine in WD patients. There was no control group (and no randomisation/blinding) in 
the trial. While placebo control would likely not have been ethically defendable, comparison with other 
treatment options (e.g. zinc or DPA) would have been feasible in principle. As a second line label is 
sought, direct comparison with D-penicillamine as active control was not studied.  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are deemed largely suited to identify the target population. Although 
no validation work seems to have been done (or was submitted) for the Ferenci score, this appears to be 
an established algorithm to diagnose Wilson’s disease in clinical practice. According to Roberts EA, 
Schilsky ML (2008) it has been subjected to preliminary validation in children, but no detailed data are 
available. Patients with a Ferenci score of 4 or higher were included which means that the diagnosis of WD 
is highly likely. It is unknown if a higher Ferenci score indicates a more severe form of disease, however 
some of the criteria included are suited to change in response to effective treatment and could thus also 
be interesting to measure treatment success.  
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019

The female predominance is rather surprising as a male predominance would rather have been expected 
(see Litwin et al. 2012; they observed a male predominance in a large population of WD patients included 
in a registry between 1958 and 2010 (327 males vs. 290 females; p<0.05). The Applicant did not 
comment on this issue, but it seems that more female patients were included in all of the submitted 
literature reviews. Differences in reaction to treatment (efficacy and safety) between genders seem 
however unlikely. 
The youngest children were 4 years of age. Though the majority of patients with Wilson disease are 
diagnosed at an age between 5 and 35 (mean 13) years (Lin et al. 2014), WD may be diagnosed in 
younger patients. In a study of 143 children with WD, 21 children (15 percent) presented with symptoms 
or abnormal liver function tests before the age of five years (Wiernicka et al. 2017). But the age range of 
included patients is considered appropriate for claimed indication.  
Endpoints, objectives 
No primary endpoints were defined for study UNV-TRI-002. In such a situation, all evaluated endpoints 
could be considered exploratory or all measures could be interpreted as one composite endpoint and no 
inferential statistical methodology was applied according to the retrospective protocol. Therefore 
information regarding importance of specific endpoints, or rigor of evidence generated by the 
corresponding data collections is challenging to be interpreted.    
The primary objectives (hepatic and neurological symptom progression under treatment) were assessed 
by applying a score of 5 categories; Unchanged, improved but not normal, improved to normal, 
asymptomatic over duration of therapy and worsening. Due to the not validated status of the score 
methodological concerns will need to be considered in the assessment. The 5-point scale was not applied 
in a standardized and comprehensive way. It is thus not a fully reliable basis to inform on trientine’s 
influence on hepatic- or neurological symptoms in WD.  
Patients were allocated to one of the categories based on the physician’s decision and this decision was 
based on clinical measures from the patients (at a time). The clinical measures available could have been 
diverse and  and the process translating them into the score was not standardized 
It can however be considered as a reliable finding from this study that patients survived for many years 
under trientine treatment which, when comparing to what is known from the natural course of the disease 
indicates a relevant beneficial treatment effect. Taken all the above deficiencies into account, the efficacy 
data based on the applied score can only serve as supportive data.  
Concomitant medications seem to have been unrestricted in the study and included D-penicillamine 
(DPA) and zinc preparations, which could have influenced the outcomes.  
The WD population using trientine 2nd line can be divided in three groups: Patients who show intolerance 
during the 24-h D-penicillamine stress test (patients characteristics are those of a 1st line treatment); 
patients developing side effects early after the start of D-penicillamine treatment switching to trientine 
while they have not yet been fully de-coppered (more comparable to the characteristics of patients on 1st 
line treatment); and ‘real’ 2nd line patients who have developed an intolerance after prolonged treatment 
with D-penicillamine or show insufficient response. It seems likely that the de-coppering status should 
have influence on the determination of (starting) doses and titration schemes. 
The information on how long patients were pre-treated with DPA or another chelating agent allowed CHMP 
to estimate the de-coppering status of the individual patient, as accumulation in the tissues cannot easily 
be estimated from clinical investigations/PD results alone. If patients hadn’t had received chelating 
treatment for an extended period, they would likely be in a status comparable to a treatment naïve WD 
patient as copper accumulates again in tissues over time. The lag time between cessation of

D-Penicillamine and trientine treatment in the retrospective study UNV-TRI-002 was > 1 year in 17 
patients (22% of ITT). The duration of D-Penicillamine treatment before trientine initiation was < 30 days 
in 9 patients (overlaps between the two categories are not reported). A considerable number of patients 
were therefore likely treated with trientine before ‘initial de-coppering’ had been completed. 
While after in depth assessment of the respective data an influence of D-PA on study outcomes seems 
unlikely (both compounds were not used concomitantly, but previous D-PA use has been recorded in the 
concomitant drugs section for some patients) at least 27 patients received zinc in addition to trientine 
during long periods of time which could probably have affected related efficacy (and safety) outcomes as 
well as the trientine dose.  
Impact of dissolution on clinical efficacy (and safety) 
At some time during the study, the manufacturer of the product changed and a new trientine capsule with 
poorer dissolution properties was introduced. That the formulation of the product could have influence on 
the absorption and thus exposure of Cufence (and consequently on the dose) cannot be completely ruled 
out based on the provided data. 
The comparison of patients receiving the one or the other formulation over the majority of time in 
UNV-TRI-002 revealed no obvious differences in observed safety and efficacy parameters. However, 
weaknesses of the applied evaluation measures were evident.  
Time to Discontinuation of Treatment Due to Adverse Event or Inadequate Response 
The time to discontinuation of treatment due to an adverse event or inadequate response is discussed in 
the context of the evaluation of efficacy in this application, as it was defined as efficacy objective. For 
discussion on the extent of exposure please refer to the respective section in the efficacy and safety part 
of this report. 
Within the two years of observation, 12 (15.6%) of patients discontinued trientine and switched to 
another treatment option. At the individual last available observation, treatment with trientine was 
ongoing in 65 (84.4%) patients of the ITT population. Overall study results indicate that patients usually 
stay on trientine treatment for quite a long time (several years) before switching to an alternative.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Patients were assessed for a maximum treatment duration of up to 48 months. The results of the 5-point 
outcome scale indicate a certain beneficial effect of Cufence on WD symptoms (hepatic and – to a lesser 
extent - neurological) can be assumed. Only a minority of patients worsened in disease status according 
to the provided results and no fatalities were reported.  As WD is a chronic, progressive disease, 
stabilisation of symptoms could be considered a treatment success. Described weaknesses of the score 
and the study design need to be taken into consideration in this interpretation.  
There was a constant decrease of analysed patients over time. However, ‘last follow up’- data are 
available for all included patients, or rather only patients with information available from at least two time 
points were included in the trial (‘6- months visit’ and ‘last follow up visit’). It is noted that a comparison 
of two (or three) time points only is considered less meaningful than a continuous analysis including many 
time points, also considering the variability of disease and the many confounding factors that could have 
influenced outcomes.  
The Applicant argues that due to the challenges of evaluating a drug’s performance in WD, patient’s 
general well-being should also be taken into account. This is agreed upon, however, neither ‚QoL’ nor 
‘survival’ have been considered as objectives in the retrospective part of the study. In the prospective 
part of the study QoL data were collected. Index values for the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire (and their 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 70/96 
 
 
changes from baseline) were measured at baseline, month 6 and month 12. Overall, the five dimensions 
of the EQ-5D-3L (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety /depression) were 
relatively stable over the 12 months duration. This is not surprising in treated, stabilised WD patients and 
given the rather short time-period. 
The way trientine was titrated in the study according to clinical parameters or disease symptoms was not 
reported systematically. Therefore  gaps remain in the knowledge on the dose/exposure/response 
relationship of Cufence in WD patients.  
Availability of free copper in the serum and also the rate of copper excretion can significantly increase at 
initiation of therapy in patients with high copper loads (especially when receiving high trientine doses), 
which can result in negative clinical effects such as neurological deterioration and be reflected in 
worsening of laboratory parameters. According to the Applicant, in clinical practice patients with higher 
copper loads are initially prescribed higher doses of trientine. Therefore, clear and precise titration rules 
for such cases would be desirable. For patients with neurological symptoms ‘up-titration with moderation’ 
and ‘close monitoring’ are recommended in the SmPC as these patients are at risk of neurological 
deterioration at treatment initiation, especially when the starting dose is high.  However better 
characterisation of efficacy and PK/PD needs to be generated in a PAES in particular in patients with 
predominantly hepatic, neurologic or psychiatric symptoms as well as in paediatric patients. 
Laboratory values are available only from a fraction of patients at each time point and no reference values 
are stated. Apart from a reduction in alanine aminotransferase (and to a lesser degree aspartate 
aminotransferase), which could be considered a treatment success, no relevant changes were observed. 
It could be assumed that laboratory parameters were investigated rather in patients with clinical 
symptoms than in asymptomatic patients (patients with complaints/deteriorating of symptoms are more 
likely to go into hospital for medical examination), which could have biased the outcome. However, this 
would more likely have resulted in an outcome not favouring trientine.  
Cufence capsules are manufactured in 200 mg (trientine base) capsules only. The proposed lower age 
limit for Cufence (5 years) is justified based on the claimed appropriateness of the 200mg capsule for this 
age and weight category. However, lower strengths may be needed to accommodate a more appropriate 
initial dose and dose titration in children. Therefor the applicant is recommended to develop lower capsule 
strengths. 
Literature data 
Retrospective, single arm reviews and case reports are available. 
The extent of WD patients studied within this bibliographical database is small. The number of WD 
patients referred to in historical studies relevant for this application (trientine second line use) is around 
200 adults and 50 children, not considering patient overlap in different publications. Many patients 
received concomitant medications together with trientine (D-penicillamine or zinc) which may have 
impacted on treatment outcomes.  
However, it is acknowledged that most patients used trientine for long periods (many years/decades). 
Also, treatment outcomes, while not investigated by state of the art measures, were overall reported 
favourable for trientine. Overall survival has not been evaluated in a systematic manner but despite the 
modest quality of the available literature and study data it can be derived with reasonable certainty that 
trientine treatment improves survival in WD patients, if they are compliant to treatment. 
Chelating agents are used for various conditions in adults and also in paediatric patients (e.g. for 
treatment of iron overload). As for chelators in general, also trientine’s mechanism of action is rather 
straightforward and most likely the same in children as in adults. There is no reason to believe that copper 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 71/96 
 
 
binding and promotion of urinary copper excretion would not work similarly in children with WD compared 
to adult patients.  
Bibliographical data on trientine use in children support these assumptions and are considered important 
for this application. The current Cufence SmPC recommends for paediatric patients 400-1000 mg 
trientine base at initiation of therapy and should be subsequently be adapted according to the patient’s 
clinical response and based on free copper levels in plasma and the urinary copper excretion during  
maintenance therapy.  
Identified gaps on the use of trientine in children and adolescents from the clinical study UNV-TRI-002 
pertain to the lack of justification for (starting) dose and titration steps as well as for appropriate target 
parameters. According to the proposed SmPC and available publications, the dose for children should be 
reduced compared to adults, accounting for a lower body weight. However, there are no PK or PD data in 
children to support the proposed dose. There could be different requirements of copper (and thus 
trientine) in different age cohorts due to developmental status that might also require a relative adaption 
of doses for juvenile individuals. Therefore, children from 5 years onwards should be included in the 
proposed PAES to further investigate the dose-exposure-response relationship in children.  
2.5.4.   Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Trientine has the ability to chelate metal ions and eliminate copper from the body. These effects have 
been shown in non-clinical and clinical studies as well as during decades of trientine use in clinical 
practice. 
Study UNV-TRI-002 indicates a beneficial effect of trientine in the majority of patients for hepatic as well 
as neurologic forms of disease (symptoms improved or remained stable in most patients). The benefit 
appears larger in patients with hepatic than neurologic disease. Very few patients deteriorated under 
treatment.  
Results further indicate that patients usually stay on trientine treatment for quite a long time before 
switching to an alternative, which indicates good tolerability, and might support the assumption that 
trientine can be used over long periods of time without its efficacy being compromised. 
The provided bibliographic references support the notion that trientine has been used in the condition 
since decades with success as to life expectancy but lack sufficient quality to fill identified evidence gaps. 
The proposed posology is in line with the posology of the nationally authorised UK trientine product, which 
is on the market for more than 30 years. The therapy is known to be effective and essential for WD 
patients intolerant to D-Penicillamine. Moreover, WD patients are treated by specialised physicians, who 
are familiar with the disease and treatment, as also clearly stated in the product information. Therefore, 
considering the totality of evidence in this rare and life threatening disease the efficacy is considered 
demonstrated.  
However, no dedicated dose-response studies are available for trientine and the quality of the data 
provided with study UNV-TRI-002 is considered limited due to shortcomings in designs, conduct and 
reporting of the submitted investigations (e.g. sample size selection, protection against bias and not 
validated 5-point outcome scale).  
The treatment effect/effect size of Cufence in WD patients with predominantly hepatic, neurologic or 
psychiatric symptoms cannot be determined based on the provided data, very limited data is available for 
patients in the up titration phase and paediatric patients. Uncertainties particularly in these 
sub-populations require further clinical evidence.

Therefore, in order to confirm or improve the dosing and titration recommendations in the PI for relevant 
subgroups of the target population and to characterise the dose-exposure-response relationship of WD 
patients, especially in the up-titration phase (first 6 months of therapy) a PAES is made condition to the 
market authorisation. The applicant is highly recommended to discuss protocol details in a scientific 
advice procedure. This study is imposed in line with Article 1(2)c of Commission Delegated Regulation 
(EU) No 357/2014. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
PAES: In order to further characterise the efficacy of trientine dihydrochloride in the treatment of Wilson’s 
disease in patients with predominantly hepatic, neurologic or psychiatric symptoms as well as in 
paediatric patients, the MAH should conduct and submit the results of an open label, prospective study to 
investigate the clinical course of hepatic, neurological and psychiatric disease from the time of initiation of 
treatment with trientine dihydrochloride up to 24 months of therapy. The study will also contain a PK/PD 
sub-study to evaluate the dose-response relationship especially during the up-titration phase. The study 
should be conducted according to an agreed protocol. 
Due date: Q4 2025 (Milestone for the PK/PD sub-study Q4 2022) 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Trientine is a well-known active substance used since decades for the treatment of WD.   
The data provided to support the safety part of this full mixed application include published references on 
trientine use in WD patients (see Table 15) and one retrospective, observational review conducted by the 
Applicant.

The single dose PK trial TR-001 PK is considered of little value for safety assessment (no AEs were 
recorded although symptomatic patients were included; the applied safety monitoring system seems 
therefore not reliable).  
‘Safety’ was one objective of the main study (UNV-TRI-002), but no hierarchy of endpoints is applied.  
Patient exposure 
Wilson’s disease is a very rare condition. Affected patients require life-long treatment and though, 
although not many patients exist, long-term exposure data are available from most of the 
identified/studied patients from the literature. What can be derived from table 2.7.4-5 (see above) is that 
most of the patients received Cufence for many years/decades. For a MA for a chronic treatment a one 
year treatment exposure would usually be a minimum requirement in a study setting. While patient 
numbers from UNV-TRI-002 alone would not be sufficient to fulfil regulatory requirements; in the light of 
the rarity of the disease and the supportive literature data, the overall extent of exposure could be 
acceptable for the assessment of safety.

UNV-TRI-002 
Mean applied doses/day (1005.7 mg TETA) were on the lower end of the proposed dose range for adults 
(1140 mg TETA) as well as paediatric patients (629.7mg TETA). The maximum doses as recommended in 
the PI (2400 mg TETA for adults and 1500mg TETA for children) were hardly ever reached. One patient 
received 2100mg TETA/day and 5 received 1800 mg TETA/day according to the information in the original 
dossier. All other patients were on lower doses throughout the study duration. Consequently, there are no 
safety data available from patients with high exposure and the safety profile at high doses cannot be 
assessed. Limited data from the literature indicate that some safety events could be dose dependent. 
Table 16 
Complete data sets from all predefined time points (6, 12, 24, 26, 48 months) are available only from a 
minority of the patients. The Applicant states that ‘Due to the nature of this retrospective study, 
treatment compliance could not be determined in detail’. All available data on trientine dose were used to 
generate an overview of the trientine dose per time point. In contrast to the numbers given in table 
2.7.4-4,  new data from these additional analyses reveal that maximum doses were indeed 2700mg 
TETA.  
Literature 
Please also see respective discussion in the efficacy section with this regard. 
The estimated extent of exposure (trientine second line use) in key publications on trientine is difficult to 
assess because of presumed significant patient overlap, but could be around 250 patients, including adult 
and paediatric patients. Studied patients are mostly long-term users, however.  
Many publications restricted the safety analysis to adverse events leading to discontinuation of the 
respective drug or did not report AEs at all. Whether this is due to the deficient collection/reporting 
Cufence - Assessment Report

measures or an actual reflection of a benign safety profile cannot be said with certainty. Weiss et al. 2013 
an 2011 a, b as well as Hölscher et al. 2010 did not state respective applied trientine doses.  
When looking at trientine doses reported. it is noted that the maximum recommended dose according to 
the SmPC was never reached (apart from in 4 patients, Saito et al. 1991, who received increasing doses 
up to 3g/day over 2 months), as was already observed in study UNV-TRI-002. Trientine safety in high 
doses can therefore not be assessed. It is noted that only publications using trientine in a monotherapy 
setting seem to have been included in the safety review.  
Post marketing experience 
Based on the assumption that patients take on average six capsules per day (recommended dose four to 
eight capsules daily) and that trientine is taken continuously, each patient would take 2,190 capsules per 
year. The number of patients can be calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by 100 to obtain the 
number of capsules, and dividing by 2,190 (the estimated number of capsules taken in a year by a 
patient). A fifth periodic benefit-risk evaluation report/PSUR for trientine dihydrochloride is available 
summarising the safety data received by Univar for trientine dihydrochloride from 01 April 2012 to 31 
March 2015 inclusive. During this 3-year reporting period, Univar distributed 53,848 bottles of trientine 
dihydrochloride (300 mg capsules), each containing 100 capsules, were, thus equating to 820 patients 
with Wilson’s disease being treated. Of the 53,848 bottles, 45,108 bottles (84%) were exported and 
8,740 bottles (16%) were distributed in the UK, equating to 686 and 133 patients with Wilson’s disease, 
respectively. Cumulative exposure information using the current method is only available from 2001 
onwards. Until 2014, 117,825 bottles of trientine dihydrochloride capsules were distributed in total. The 
figures for the total number of bottles sold each year during the period 2001 to 2014 and the estimated 
patient exposure are shown in Table 17.  
Table 17 Cumulative Patient Exposure 
The data indicates an overall increase of patients treated with trientine over time. The significant increase 
in the years 2011/2012 is not comprehensively explained. It is assumed that the number of WD patients 
throughout the world remains relatively stable. The data pictured also support that WD is a rare disease; 
the total number of treated WD patients (potential study population) is small. No additional information 
on patient characteristics (such as age, gender, etc.) or on use in special populations or the patterns of 
use is available.

Collection of trientine AEs from the post-marketing setting was provided during the procedure: The 
Applicant carefully reviewed cases of hepatic toxicity and discussed possible relation to trientine 
treatment. While a connection cannot fully be excluded based on the available data, it is very difficult to 
allocate recorded toxicity to (i) either the disease or the lacking treatment compliance or (ii) to the 
treatment itself. The data situation is ambiguous and there is no clear indication that trientine causes 
hepatic toxicity. Therefore, hepatic reactions are currently not included as adverse drug reaction in the PI. 
Liver enzymes are monitored regularly in WD patients and changes in hepatic status are recorded by 
treating physicians. 
Adverse events 
UNV-TRI-002 
According to the data collection schedule, AEs were recorded at trientine initiation, after 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 
months of treatment and at the ‘last follow up’. At each of the visits, patients were asked about ‘AEs since 
the last visit’. This covers a time-period of 6 to 12 months or longer for patients that missed occasional 
visits, which is true for most of included patients. It seems rather unlikely that precise and detailed AE 
records could be obtained in this way since significant recall bias must be assumed. In conclusion, the 
safety monitoring was not sufficiently sensitive to reliably depict the safety profile of chronic trientine use 
in WD patients. 
In addition to the unspecific questioning, a catalogue of physical findings considered related to Wilson’s 
disease was queried at each of these visits, including tremor, drooling, rigid dystonia and other 
symptoms.  These were, however, not considered AEs, but seem to have been used for the evaluation of 
efficacy (see respective section above). Results from this query are available only for a fraction of 
included patients at each time point. No development over time can be assessed based on the 
presentation of these data. 
Table 18 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 78/96 
 
 
 
 
Table 19 
Overall, the amount of reported AEs, TEAEs and trientine related AEs is very low (considering the 
relatively long observational period). Whether this is due to the deficient collection/reporting measures or 
an actual reflection of a benign safety profile cannot be said with certainty. Gastrointestinal disorders 
(26.0% of patients), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (19.5% patients) and nervous 
system disorders (14.3% patients) were the most common reported events attributed to the drug in 
UNV-TRI-002. Observed events more or less match with what would be expected according to literature 
and information from other licensed trientine products (see section on literature below).  
Possible dose dependency of adverse reactions cannot be assessed based on the available data as AEs are 
not discussed in view of respective doses. Moreover, maximum doses (2.4 g/day as stated in the PI) were 
not used in this study. The Applicant provided an overview of reports of high trientine doses from the 
literature, which suggests dose dependency of AEs. Nevertheless, the Applicant concludes that the safety 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 79/96 
 
 
 
 
window for trientine is large and that a dose recommendation up to 2400 mg/day (1600 mg/day active 
moiety) is in line with the recommendations for the nationally licensed trientine product and also 
conservative, regarding the European guidance document on the matter. The risk for over-chelation is not 
discussed in this context, however. 
From the available data it seems that higher doses are used rather for initiation of treatment than for 
maintenance, which contradicts the Applicant’s approach of ‘start low and go slow’. The Applicant argues 
that a slow increase in dose to reach the recommended therapeutic dose should be considered in patients 
with neurological symptoms due to the risk of neurological deterioration at the initiation of treatment; this 
is also stated in the PI. In UNV-TRI-002, at initiation of the trientine treatment the mean dose was 
approximately 800 mg TETA and the dose was up titrated to reach a maintenance dose of around 1200 
mg per day at month 6. 
AEs of paediatric patients were outlined and discussed compared to adult data.  
Table 20 
The data indicate good tolerability also in paediatric patients. For study UNV-TRI-002 a summary of 
height and weight gain over the course of treatment in paediatric patients did not indicate impairment of 
normal development. 
Adverse Events - Literature Data 
From other trientine products licensed in the EU it is known that possible AEs comprise gastrointestinal 
disorders (included in the Cufence PI), iron deficiency anaemia (included) and skin conditions such as 
rash (included), pruritus (not included), erythema (not included) and urticaria (not included).  
The FDA approved ‘Syprine’ in addition mentions systemic lupus erythematosus (included), muscular 
spasm (included) and myasthenia gravis (not included).  
There have been reports of neurological deterioration in Wilson’s disease patients treated with copper 
chelators including trientine, with symptoms of, for example, dystonia, rigidity, tremor and dysarthria (all 
included). Restless leg syndrome (RLS) was identified in the literature as possible trientine AE and one 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 80/96 
 
 
 
 
case of RLS was also recorded in study UNV-TRI-002. The Applicant attributed this event to other causes 
than the use of trientine.  
Copper deficiency as possible adverse reaction comes to mind when thinking about trientine’s mechanism 
of action. ‘Sideroblastic anemia’ was described as possible result of copper deficiency in WD patients 
under treatment (Perry et al., 1996, Roberts and Schilsky, 2008, EASL, 2012) and is included in section 
4.8 of the SmPC.  
The Applicant states that treatment guidelines recommend that treated Wilson’s disease patients should 
be monitored and closely followed for development of new neurologic or hepatic symptoms, and undergo 
regular assessments of liver function and urinary copper excretion to detect signs of inadequate response 
to treatment, possible overtreatment, or even potential long-term toxicity despite the appearance of 
clinical stability. This is adequately covered in the PI. 
It was not discussed how the “known AEs from literature” have been identified, whether a dedicated 
literature search on trientine tolerability has been conducted.  
A comparison of the safety profiles of trientine and D-penicillamine conducted by the Applicant shows that 
trientine seems better tolerable. This is in line with reports from several publications and with statements 
in respective treatment guidelines, even if use of trientine after D-penicillamine withdrawal is not 
specifically considered. It could be assumed that patients intolerant to one chelator (D-penicillamine) 
might be at higher risk of intolerance to another (trientine). The Applicant argues that a cross-sensitivity 
between D-penicilamine and trientine is unlikely; while this is not justified in depth and no clinical data are 
available to support the statement, the rationale can be followed. 
Non-clinical data did not raise any particular concerns from a safety point of view. 
Adults 
Short summary overviews of available safety data from key publications are presented in the clinical AR. 
Safety data from the largest retrospective cohort study to date, of patients with Wilson’s disease in 
European tertiary care centres and patients recorded in the EuroWilson registry (Weiss et al., 2013) 
indicate that trientine is well tolerable, also in comparison to the first line treatment D-penicillamine. 
Other, smaller studies support this conclusion and many authors report that in the majority of patients 
where serious adverse reactions occurred with D-penicillamine therapy symptoms had improved or 
disappeared under trientine (e.g. Scheinberg et al 1987). 
However, possible patient overlap between the population from study UNV-TRI-002 and the population 
studied by Weiss et al. 2013 (and probably Weiss et al. 2011, see efficacy section) renders the 
significance of this publication relative. Deficiencies regarding AE collection and reporting are believed to 
be the same as for UNV-TRI-002. No doses were reported by Weiss et al. 2013 and thus a possible dose 
dependency of adverse reactions could not be assessed. The majority of significant events were 
gastrointestinal complaints, skin- and musculoskeletal issues. One patient withdrew from trientine due to 
nephropathy, a rather unexpected event that was not further discussed by the Applicant. Nephropathy is 
an AE reported in some publications, but mostly in connection with D-penicillamine treatment. 
Children 
The medical records of children diagnosed with Wilson’s disease at a single European centre between 
1981 and 2006 and converted from D-penicillamine to trientine, were retrospectively reviewed (Taylor et 
al., 2009). Trientine was discontinued in three of 13 children due to allergic rash, low copper excretion 
(3.9 years after starting trientine), and one with possible compliance problems resulting in the 
requirement of a liver transplant. Trientine was re-started (after 5.1 years of zinc monotherapy) in the 
patient who discontinued due to a rash when symptoms deteriorated during treatment with zinc, and was 
well tolerated.

A retrospective review of the medical records of children with Wilson’s disease evaluated and treated in a 
paediatric liver/liver transplant program (Arnon et al., 2007) did not show any significant adverse effects 
of treatment with trientine (n=10). One patient stopped trientine after 12 months due to elevated liver 
enzymes which was thought to be due to mild hepatic toxicity as a result of trientine therapy.  
Tolerance and efficacy were investigated in case studies of 10 children with Wilson’s disease, nine of 
whom were prospectively treated with trientine (Sarles et al., 2001). The authors report that four patients 
switched from trientine to D-penicillamine: two because of a high level of transaminases after 5.5 and six 
years of treatment; one for a secondary rise of transaminases after an uneventful pregnancy; and one for 
personal reasons. One patient died following several months of an intentional break in treatment.  
A review of medical records of patients who received a diagnosis of Wilson’s disease between 1983 and 
2004 in a tertiary care unit in Greece has been published (Manolaki et al., 2009). The mean age (± 
standard deviation [SD]) at diagnosis was 9.27 ± 3.6 years (range, four months to 18 years), and the 
median age was nine years. In all, 54 patients initially received D-penicillamine, however, nine patients 
(16%) discontinued D-penicillamine because of adverse effects that occurred within the first 12 months of 
treatment (hepatotoxicity [five patients], neutropenia [two patients], and nephrotoxicity [two patients]). 
Of these, five patients continued treatment with trientine (250 to 750 mg/day), three with zinc and one 
with a combination of trientine and zinc, with no significant adverse effects. Two patients discontinued 
treatment 15 and 12 years after diagnosis and had rapid deterioration of the disease.  
A retrospective review of the medical records of 74 children with Wilson’s disease treated at the Paediatric 
Liver Service, King’s College Hospital between 1967 and 2000 has been reported (Dhawan et al., 2005). 
In total, 57 patients were referred because of liver disease, and a further 17 were asymptomatic siblings 
diagnosed during family screening. Of the 49 symptomatic children treated with long-term chelation, 47 
were alive up to 37 years after commencing treatment. Side effects attributable to D-penicillamine were 
observed in 18 patients, requiring dose reduction in six children, and conversion to trientine in 12 
patients.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study UNV-TRI-002  
In study UNV-TRI-002 serious TEAEs were reported from 17 (22.1%) patients (Table 21). Serious TEAEs 
considered related to trientine were reported from two patients (Anaemia [led to discontinuation of 
trientine] and Intestinal obstruction were reported from one patient, and Hepatic enzyme increased 
[Study medication was reduced from 1800 mg to 1200 mg daily due to this event] was reported from one 
patient). The other recorded serious TEAEs were not considered related to treatment by the Applicant 
which seems acceptable. The SAEs, considered related to trientine, resolved. The majority of SAEs 
resolved, resolved with sequelae or improved.

Table 21 
The reported data on SAEs do not raise particular concern. 
Other sources 
For the majority of cases the primary source of information on adverse safety events are retrospective 
narrative reviews and studies reported in the literature. In these publications, the reported safety events 
are not presented or reported in a predefined and consistent way, which would allow them to be reliably 
categorised as non-serious or serious or integrated and examined for frequency over time. 
Death 
No fatalities were reported in studies UNV-TRI-002 or TR-001PK and no death attributed to trientine use 
was reported in the provided literature. On the contrary, what can be derived with relative good certainty 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 83/96 
 
 
 
 
from available literature data despite their poor quality is an improvement in survival in WD patients 
compliant to treatment. Reported fatalities are usually related to progression of the underlying disease or 
non-compliance to treatment. 
Untreated Wilson´s disease is universally fatal (EASL). Copper accumulation in the liver eventually leads 
to development of cirrhosis, and among patients with neurologic forms of the disease it may progress 
until the patient becomes severely dystonic, akinetic, and mute. Progression is usually gradual, but 
sudden deterioration may also occur. The majority of patients will die from liver disease (cirrhosis or acute 
liver failure), while the remainder die due to complications from progressive neurologic disease.  
The prognosis of WD patients who receive treatment and are adherent is excellent, even in some who 
already have advanced liver disease. In patients without advanced liver disease, life expectancy is 
normal, though treatment may lead to worsening of neurologic symptoms in a fraction of patients 
(Stremmel et al. 1991, Bruha et al. 2011). 
Laboratory findings 
In UNV-TRI-002 no laboratory findings (not even if clinically significant) were reported as AEs, unless 
clinical signs or symptoms were present in addition. It is unknown if samples were taken as part of clinical 
routine measures or if clinicians triggered them based on the clinical appearance of the patient. 
Therefore, laboratory findings are discussed in the efficacy section of this report. Apart from a reduction 
in alanine aminotransferase (and to a lesser extent aspartate aminotransferase) no relevant changes 
were observed.  
No data on laboratory parameters is available from the literature. In Weiss et al. 2013 one case of 
neutropenia was recorded in one patient under trientine treatment.  
Safety in special populations 
The Applicant states that dosing is highly patient-specific, variable and subject to constant review and 
change according to the patients’ signs, symptoms and copper levels. Efforts to provide clear guidance on 
how to monitor patients (including which parameters to monitor and how often) and how to titrate upon 
signs, symptoms and laboratory have proven rather futile in light of the poor data situation. Currently, the 
proposed dosing recommendations need further substantiation by appropriate PK/PD data.  
Currently available data does not allow to conclude that PK/PD or dose/exposure/ response relationship 
between adults and children are similar and if there are different copper requirements (and thus, need for 
different trientine doses) in different age cohorts due to their developmental status. 
No information on patients with hepatic impairment or elderly patients seems available. Large 
inter-individual variability in exposure was observed, but differences between populations could still be 
relevant for defining the appropriate (safe) starting dose and treatment targets. Literature data indicates 
that differences in PK could occur depending on intrinsic patient factors (e.g., trientine bioavailability was 
higher in patients with type II diabetes). However, as trientine is titrated to target, small differences will 
likely not become apparent. 
The difficulty of studying subgroups in a small population is acknowledged, but more PK/PD data 
especially in paediatric patients is needed and should be collected post-marketing in the frame of the 
PAES.

Adverse Events by Age 
Table 22 
A total of 134 patients are available for allocation to age cohorts in the provided table. 
Most AEs are recorded in the largest group of patients aged <65 years. The data does not indicate a 
higher risk of AEs in paediatric patients.  
The amount of patients in the >65 years group is extremely limited and thus reliable comparisons to other 
age groups are difficult. However, there is no indication that the safety profile differs significantly in older 
patients. Close monitoring also in older patients is recommended to allow timely up- or down titration of 
trientine dose in reaction to the patient’s status. The current wording in the PI is acceptable with this 
regard.

Immunological events 
Information from the submitted literature is rare. Immunogenicity was investigated by Weiss et al. 2013. 
Results indicate a good immunogenetic profile of TETA 2HCL as compared to D-penicillamine: 
ANA: antinuclear antibody 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In line with requirements outlined in the protocol assistance 2012, the Applicant conducted in vitro 
CYP450 interaction studies with trientine in human liver microsomes and human hepatocytes. Results do 
not indicate a clinically relevant risk for DDIs: a small dose response in CYP1A2 (with 3.2-fold as the 
highest response) was less than 5% of the fold induction with the positive control omeprazole – as such 
considered unlikely to mediate drug-drug interaction. 
In the study report of UNV-TRI-002, concomitant medication with trientine is listed. Zinc was used quite 
frequently together with trientine, but it is not recommended due to likely interactions. A warning on 
concomitant intake of iron (where interaction with trientine is highly likely) is included in section 4.5 of the 
SmPC.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Assessment of the safety of trientine treatment based on AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment with 
trientine and time to discontinuation of treatment due to AEs and/or inadequate response were two 
objectives of the main trial UNV-TRI-002. The respective results are discussed in the efficacy section of 
this report.  
Overall, results indicate that patients usually stay on trientine treatment for quite a long time (several 
years or even decades) before switching to an alternative. The data supports a benign safety profile, 
especially compared to the first line therapy D-penicillamine. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
For the evaluation of Cufence safety in this “full mixed” application, published references on trientine use 
in WD patients from different sources were submitted as well as a retrospective observational review 
conducted by the Applicant (study UNV-TRI-002). This study also had a prospective part, basically 
observing the same patients as in the retrospective part. 
No prospectively planned and well-designed, controlled trials have been conducted with Cufence (or any 
other trientine product) that would meet scientific standards for high quality evidence.  
Shortcomings in designs, conduct and reporting of the submitted investigations must be balanced against 
the longstanding experience with trientine, which is available on the marked since decades and 
considered state-of-the-art therapy for WD according to relevant guidelines.  
Trientine´s tolerability seems widely recognised. Though patients are not thoroughly documented, the 
exposure periods are very long. Overall, the amount of reported AEs, TEAEs and trientine-related AEs is 
very low. Whether this is due to insufficient collection/reporting measures or is an actual reflection of a 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 86/96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      
 
 
 
benign safety profile cannot be said with certainty. The safety profile of trientine is also considered 
favourable when compared to D-penicillamine. Finally, non-clinical data did not raise any particular 
concerns from a safety point of view. 
It is acknowledged that WD is a very rare disease and that the amount of potential study subjects is 
therefore limited. Data on trientine use from the post-marketing setting using sales numbers was 
provided and supports regular use of the product, even if no details on dose or duration of exposure are 
available.  
Not in all of the included literature was trientine used as a second line option after D-penicillamine. The 
Applicant states in several sections that initial de-coppering can take many months up to years and it 
seems likely that patients (receiving trientine 2nd line) were included in the database also if initial 
de-coppering was not yet completed. Trientine will likely be used in these patients in clinical practice. 
Patients at different stages of the de-coppering process were included in the safety database and thus 
data provides a rather comprehensive picture, likely corresponding to later clinical use. The Applicant 
further argues that a cross-sensitivity between the two compounds (D-penicilamine and trientine) is 
unlikely and that therefore there is no reason to assume that patients intolerant to D-Penicillamine could 
be more at risk of being intolerant to trientine, which can be followed.  
In study UNV-TRI-002 (uncontrolled, unblinded), patients were enrolled if they were previously treated 
with trientine for at least 6 months. Patients that withdrew from treatment within these first six month 
were not included in the study population. Thus, there is an identified lack of information on safety of 
trientine within the first 6 month of treatment, which has to be considered as an uncertainty. No 
statement about the amount of patients with immediate intolerability or non-responsive to treatment can 
be made. However, the proposed PAES will study patients directly after switching from D-Penicillamine 
and will address this gap.  
From the originally submitted data, it is obvious that doses over 2.4 g/day are not used in clinical practice 
and doses of 2100mg are very rarely used. Thus, safety at higher doses cannot be properly assessed but 
the recommended dose is 800 – 1,600 mg (4 – 8 capsules) daily in 2 to 4 divided doses. 
From the available data and information on other licensed trientine products it is known that possible 
trientine AEs compile primarily gastrointestinal disorders, nervous system disorders and skin conditions. 
Results from different sources largely agree in this regard. There is a certain risk for drug-drug 
interactions with iron, zinc and D-penicillamine and appropriate information in this regard is included in 
the SmPC. 
No fatalities attributed to trientine use were reported in the provided literature. Despite the rather poor 
quality of the available literature data, it can be derived with reasonable certainty that trientine treatment 
improves survival in WD patients, if they are compliant to treatment. Reported deaths are usually related 
to progression of the underlying disease or non-compliance to treatment. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
WD is usually diagnosed rather early and the share of paediatric patients included in the documentation 
is relatively large. There are no relevant differences in the quality or quantity of reported AEs of paediatric 
patients compared to adults in study UNV-TRI-002. According to data from other literature sources (e.g. 
Taylor et al., 2009, Arnon et al., 2007, Manolaki et al., 2009), good tolerability can be assumed for 
trientine also in paediatric patients.  
It seems that in paediatric patients, trientine is often used as a first line option (instead of 
D-penicillamine) rather than in second line, probably due to the more favourable safety profile. Results 
are overall in line with results from adult patients; however, the data situation (extent and quality) is poor 
for the paediatric cohorts and concerns with trientine treatment (or in general – chelator treatment) 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019

pertaining to the paediatric population could be a certain risk of copper deficiency with over-treatment 
that could impair juvenile developmental processes. 
In this light the proposed dosing regimen particularly in children is poorly supported by PK/PD data and 
the dose/exposure/response (safety) relationship is not well characterised. Dosing recommendations for 
all age groups are largely based on the SmPC of the long-standing nationally licensed Univar’s trientine 
product and require further substantiation in the imposed PAES. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Amount and quality of the available data is limited. Nonetheless, longstanding experience with the 
substance in clinical practice as well as the data provided support a benign safety profile of trientine in the 
treatment of with Wilson’s disease in patients intolerant to D-penicillamine therapy, in adults, adolescents 
and children aged 5 years or older.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The Applicant applies for the following indication: “Cufence is indicated for the treatment of Wilson’s 
disease in patients intolerant to D-penicillamine therapy, in adults, adolescents and children aged 5 years 
or older.” 
Wilson’s disease, also known as hepatolenticular degeneration, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of 
copper metabolism caused by an autosomal recessive inheritance of ATP7B gene mutations. Wilson’s 
disease is characterised by defective incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin leading to copper 
accumulation in the liver, brain and kidneys as well as decreased biliary copper excretion.  
The clinical manifestations of Wilson disease are predominantly hepatic, neurologic and psychiatric, with 
many patients having a combination of symptoms. Patients may present with a wide variety of symptoms 
(especially those with neurologic symptoms).  
The aim of therapy is reduction of the total amount of copper and treatment of copper overload/ 
accumulation in body tissues. Treatment is considered in two phases: (i) removing the tissue copper that 
has accumulated (‘de-coppering phase’) and (ii) preventing re-accumulation (maintenance phase), which 
is the goal of long-term treatment.  
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 90/96 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment of patients with Wilson’s disease encompasses drug therapy, diet management (i.e. 
alimentary copper restriction) and ultimately liver transplantation in patients who progress to liver failure. 
If untreated, the disease is fatal. 
Chelating agents such as D-penicillamine or trientine are the cornerstone of drug therapy in WD, 
recommended by both the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and European 
Association for Study of Liver (EASL). D-penicillamine is licensed both as first line treatment for the 
de-coppering phase in treatment naïve patients and as maintenance therapy. It is regarded as a more 
potent, but also less tolerable chelator (as compared with trientine). 
Trientine is used as second line treatment after D-penicillamine. Univar is the MAH and commercial 
supplier for trientine dihydrochloride in the UK, also exporting the product widely. In the US, trientine 
hydrochloride 250 mg capsules are approved (Syprine). Trientine in the form of TETA 4 HCL (Cuprior) has 
been approved in the EU via the centralised procedure in 2017 in the same indication as claimed by the 
applicant. 
Zinc is another treatment option, centrally approved for the treatment of Wilson’s disease since 2004 
(Wilzin). 
For WD patients who develop acute liver failure, liver transplantation is the only option for survival. 
Survival rates of 59 - 76% at 5-10 years have been reported (Medici et al. 2005), with poorer outcomes 
in patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main clinical study is a phase IV, multicentre, observational trial, UNV-TRI-002. It is a retrospective 
review of historical WD patient data. A prospective observation following patients included in the 
retrospective study, if they consented, was conducted in one of the centres. In the retrospective part, 77 
WD patients were observed for a maximum duration of 48 month during their regular treatment with 
trientine. The objective was to assess long-term outcomes of treatment with trientine in WD patients, who 
had withdrawn from therapy with D-penicillamine. No primary endpoint was defined, but a 5-point 
assessment score was applied to evaluate neurological and hepatic outcomes (classified as unchanged, 
improved but not normal, improved to normal, asymptomatic over duration of therapy or worsened).  
The bibliographical database consists of reports of patient outcomes recorded over fairly long periods of 
time (years to decades); for some patients (children at initiation of treatment) observational periods 
lasted for up to 37 years (Dhawan et al. 2005). The main literature references are authored by Weiss 
(Weiss et al, 2013, 2011a and b), with study objectives and settings comparable to UNV-TRI-002. The 
Applicant also conducted a Phase I, single dose PK study (Study TR-001 PK) in 20 adult and paediatric WD 
patients treated with trientine dihydrochloride. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Trientine has the ability to chelate metal ions and eliminate copper from the body. These effects have 
been shown in non-clinical and clinical studies as well as during decades of trientine use in clinical 
practice. 
Study UNV-TRI-002 indicates a beneficial effect of trientine in the majority of patients for hepatic as well 
as neurologic forms of disease (symptoms improved or remained stable in most patients). The benefit 
appears larger in patients with hepatic than neurologic disease. Very few patients deteriorated under 
treatment.  
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 91/96 
 
 
Results further indicate that patients usually stay on trientine treatment for quite a long time before 
switching to an alternative, which indicates good tolerability, and might support the assumption that 
trientine can be used over long periods of time without its efficacy being compromised. 
While the quality of the respective literature references is moderate, they serve to support 
recommendations regarding posology, optimal treatment timing and duration, as well as data sources to 
judge upon consistency of results across trials.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No dedicated dose-response studies are available for trientine. Dosing information was mainly obtained 
from clinical experience, outside controlled/ experimental study settings. To date, there is no optimal 
parameter or combination of parameters identified with which to monitor treatment success of chelator 
therapy in WD patients. Characterisation of the relationship between dose and PD-response according to 
PD parameters measured in study UNV-TRI-002 is only possible to a limited degree but management of 
dose titration in adults, paediatric patients, different disease subgroups (hepatic, neurologic, psychiatric) 
or in patients with different de-coppering status lies within the remit of specialised practitioners. 
Study design and conduct of PK study TR-001 were not appropriate to provide meaningful results and the 
batch of trientine dihydrochloride used in study TR-001 PK had demonstrated faster in vitro dissolution 
behaviour than the to-be-marketed capsules, therefore PK and PD characterisation of Cufence in WD 
patients is fragmentary. 
No specific food interaction studies in humans have been performed with trientine. However as trientine 
is poorly absorbed following oral intake, food may inhibit absorption. This uncertainty has been addressed 
in the SmPC advising to take trientine at least 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals and at least one 
hour apart from any other medicinal product, food, or milk to allow for maximum absorption and reduce 
the likelihood of the formation of complexes by metal binding in the gastrointestinal tract.  The most 
relevant PD data (i.e. 24-h UCE and NCC) collected in UNV-TRI-002 in the retrospective study did not 
show good correspondence with the proposed target ranges from the literature (for reasons unknown, a 
slightly better correspondence is seen over the shorter time frame of the prospective dataset). The quality 
of the data provided with study UNV-TRI-002 is considered limited due to shortcomings in designs, 
conduct and reporting of the submitted investigations (e.g. sample size selection, protection against bias 
and not validated 5-point outcome scale).  
Suspected overlaps between the study population included in study UNV-TRI-002 and the study 
population of the main literature reference, Weiss et al. 2013, may render the latter study to be of limited 
value (respective results can only be considered once) and the overall amount of patients studied on 
second line trientine use in WD in the literature is small (it compiles around 200 adults and 50 children 
without considering patient overlaps). 
The influence of trientine on the mental state of WD patients cannot be determined based on the provided 
data and the dossier will need further substantiation from the planned PAES.   
Treatment of patients with renal impairment, hepatic impairment/cirrhosis and potential drug- 
interactions with Zinc have not been fully investigated and precautionary statements were included in the 
SmPC. Whilst concomitant use of zinc is not recommended in the SmPC, it is common in clinical practice 
and regular concomitant intake of zinc was recorded for 27 patients in UNV-TRI-002.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In study UNV-TRI-002 overall, the amount of reported AEs, TEAEs and trientine related AEs was very low 
(considering the relatively long observational period). Nineteen (19) TEAEs that were considered related 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019  
Page 92/96 
 
 
to treatment were reported. Gastrointestinal disorders (26.0% of patients), musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (19.5% patients) and nervous system disorders (14.3% patients) were the 
most common reported events attributed to trientine in UNV-TRI-002. Hepatic symptoms worsened in 
5.2% of patients and neurologic symptoms worsened in 2.6% of patients. Observed events match more 
or less what is expected from trientine use according to available literature and information from other 
licensed trientine products. 
The adverse events listed in the PI include anaemia (as trientine may reduce serum iron levels), nervous 
system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders and skin disorders, all of them mostly mild. Iron 
supplementation might become necessary under trientine therapy. There have been reports of 
neurological deterioration in Wilson’s disease patients treated with copper chelators including trientine, 
which is also stated in the PI.  
One case of ‘hepatic toxicity’, was reported by Arnon et al. 2007 (in a child), and another case of hepatic 
toxicity were reported in study UNV-TRI-002. Nephrosis/nephropathy is described in some publications, 
but mostly in connection with D-penicillamine treatment. The SmPC advises that patients with renal 
and/or hepatic impairment receiving trientine should remain under regular medical supervision for 
appropriate control of symptoms and copper levels. Close monitoring of renal and/or liver function is also 
recommended in these patients. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The overall safety database is small. Seventy seven (77) patients have been studied in study 
UNV-TRI-002 and around 250 WD patients using second line trientine are reported in the literature. 
Altogether, the amount of reported AEs, TEAEs and trientine related AEs is low (considering the relatively 
long observational period). Whether this is due to the deficient collection/reporting measures or an actual 
reflection of a benign safety profile cannot be said with certainty based on this data. The way safety was 
monitored in the historical references is unknown, but will likely not have been done in a systematic 
manner. Some literature references do not report safety findings at all. 
The safety monitoring in study UNV-TRI-002 is not considered sufficiently sensitive to reliably depict the 
safety profile of chronic trientine use in WD patients or to investigate differences between adult and 
paediatric patients. At each visit, patients were asked about the occurrence of ‘AEs since the last visit’. 
This covers a time period of 6 to 12 months (or longer for patients that missed occasional visits). It seems 
rather unlikely that precise and detailed records could be obtained in this way and significant recall bias 
must be assumed.  
However, the committee acknowledges the clinical use of trientine for more than 30 years and that, 
according to the literature, trientine causes fewer side effects than the first line treatment D-penicillamine 
and that D-penicillamine´s side effects mostly resolve during trientine treatment. Also, the fact that the 
nationally approved trientine product has been marketed for decades and went through several PSUR 
assessments and renewals also speaks for an established safety profile. 
Patients withdrawing from treatment within the first six months were not included in study UNV-TRI-002 
and no statement can be made about the proportion of patients with immediate intolerability or 
unresponsive to treatment. The imposed PAES will aim to characterise the dose-exposure-response 
relationship of WD patients, especially in the up-titration phase (first 6 months of therapy) and therefore, 
also complement the safety information.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Trientine is known to decrease blood copper levels in Wilson’s disease patients, its mechanism of action is 
well known; chelation has shown useful in removing toxic metals from the body in many indications. 
Trientine has been in use for this purpose since more than 30 years and is recommended in relevant 
treatment guidelines (EASL and AASL), based on evidence of ‘moderate quality’ (EASL). Notably, its 
efficacy has never been evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. 
Whereas Wilson’s disease is universally fatal if untreated, the prognosis for patients who receive and are 
adherent to treatment is excellent, even in those patients who already have advanced liver disease. In 
patients without advanced liver disease, life expectancy is normal, though treatment may lead to 
worsening of neurologic symptoms in a fraction of patients (Stremmel et al. 1991, Bruha et al. 2011). 
Trientine may have a better safety profile when compared to the first line treatment, D-penicillamine, 
though D-penicillamine could be more effective. Trientine in the form of TETA 4 HCL (Cuprior) has been 
approved in the EU via the centralised procedure in 2017 in the same indication as claimed by the 
applicant. According to literature, trientine causes fewer side effects and D-penicillamine´s side effects 
mostly resolve during trientine treatment. The fact that the nationally approved trientine product has

been marketed for decades and went through several PSUR assessments and renewals also speaks for an 
established safety profile. 
The documentation in the clinical part of the dossier is fragmentary and aspects of trientine’s 
characteristics have not been properly addressed: Dose response has not been characterised and dose 
recommendations and respective titration schemes in the PI (including all subgroups of interest) rely on 
clinical experience as laid down in the EASL and AASL treatment guidelines. Particularly in paediatric WD 
patients the PK data is limited. Thus, there is presently a risk that some patients may not be optimally 
treated.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In the EMA protocol assistance issued in 2012, the CHMP stated that a retrospective study and review of 
clinical experience, together with PK and PK/PD data, might be sufficient to support a second-line 
indication. The Applicant submitted results from a PK study and a retrospective review, but gaps in 
knowledge remain related to food effect and possible interactions (mainly with zinc), the dose- and 
exposure-response relationship or the PK of trientine in the paediatric population mainly due to the 
limited quality of the provided data (both literature and own data). 
The dose and titration regimen for Cufence is based on long-standing clinical experience of expert 
physicians with trientine in this rare disease and based on the submitted data including literature there is 
little doubt that trientine is an effective treatment that may increase the life span of WD patients. The 
remaining uncertainties are considered outweighed taking into consideration that Cufence will be used by 
specialists (as mandated in the SmPC), who are familiar with the disease and chelator treatment, and 
treatment will be titrated mainly according to clinical symptoms, which should minimise the risk of 
inappropriate dosing. 
Whilst there is lack of knowledge about a food effect and interactions of trientine with zinc these issues 
have been addressed with appropriate recommendations and precautionary wordings in the product 
information, Uncertainties on the product’s benefit-risk with regards to the effect size, in particular in 
patients with hepatic, neurological and psychiatric disease, and on the dose exposure response 
relationship particularly in patients in the up-titration phase and in children remain. These uncertainties 
require the generation of further clinical evidence from an imposed PAES based on a protocol agreed by 
the CHMP. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Cufence is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Cufence is favourable in the following indication: 
Cufence is indicated for the treatment of Wilson’s disease in patients intolerant to D-penicillamine 
therapy, in adults and children aged 5 years or older. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Cufence - Assessment Report  
EMA/330602/2019

Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Description 
PAES: In order to further characterise the efficacy of trientine dihydrochloride in the 
treatment of Wilson’s disease in patients with predominantly hepatic, neurologic or 
psychiatric symptoms as well as in paediatric patients, the MAH should conduct and 
submit the results of an open label, prospective study to investigate the clinical course 
of hepatic, neurological and psychiatric disease from the time of initiation of treatment 
with trientine dihydrochloride up to 24 months of therapy. The study will also contain a 
PK/PD sub-study to evaluate the dose-response relationship especially during the 
up-titration phase. The study should be conducted according to an agreed protocol.

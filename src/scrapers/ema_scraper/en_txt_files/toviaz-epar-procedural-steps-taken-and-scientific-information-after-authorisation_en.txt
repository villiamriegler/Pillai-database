SmPC and PL 
Based on cumulative reviews, the warning in section 4.4 of 
existing warning on angioedema and 4.8 of the 
SmPC in order to add hypoaesthesia oral to the list 
of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with a frequency 
rare based on a cumulative review of safety database 
cases and literature. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to bring the PI in line with the QRD 
template v10.3. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
SmPC on angioedema has been updated to reflect that 
'some cases may be associated with upper airway swelling 
and may be life-threatening’.  
In addition, hypoaesthesia oral had been added in section 
4.8 of SmPC with a frequency ‘rare’.

A0221047, a phase 3, randomized, open-label study to 
the results from study A0221047, to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of fesoterodine in subjects aged 6 
to 17 years with neurogenic detrusor overactivity. 
The change was suggested in the outcome of the 
EMEA/H/C/000723/P46/030.1. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the 
list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of fesoterodine on 
paediatric patients aged 6 to 17 with symptoms of detrusor 
overactivity associated with Neurogenic Detrusor 
Overactivity (NDO).  
Treatment with fesoterodine 4 mg or 8 mg tablets resulted 
in improvements from baseline in maximum cystometric 
bladder capacity (MCBC) at Week 12 for paediatric patients 
> 25 kg, with numerically higher changes from baseline for

with neurogenic detrusor overactivity was similar to that 
observed in adults with overactive bladder syndrome. 
These safety and efficacy data from Study A0221047 have 
been described in section 5.1 and 5.2. of the SmPC. No 
recommendation on posology can be made and 
uncertainties on the long-term safety remain. Overall, data 
from this study, although considered positive, remain 
limited. The safety and efficacy of Toviaz in children aged 
less than 6 years has not been established.

moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors.  
Additionally, further to reports included in the 5th PSUR

The MAH has proposed change to section 4.5 of the SmPC 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
with information on interaction with  warfarin from a clinical 
study in healthy volunteers to evaluate the steady-state 
effect of fesoterodine (8 mg once daily) on the PK and PD 
of a single dose of warfarin (25 mg). From this study it was 
concluded that their was a lack of interactive PK effect or 
interactive PD effect when warfarin is co-administered with 
fesoterodine. These results are in line with theoretical

considerations concerning warfarin metabolism, as well as 
the conclusion from the review of the safety database. The

The incidence rate for urinary retention in the pooled

treated patients in clinical trials is 0.9%. The search of the 
safety database confirmed 38 cases of urinary retention 
considered as serious (i.e. associated with catherisation 
and/or hospitalization). Many of these cases were reported 
in elderly male patients, who had a history consistent with 
benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is therefore considered 
appropriate to indicate 'clinically significant prostate 
enlargement due to benign prostatic hyperplasia' as an 
example of a condition with clinically significant bladder 
outflow obstruction at risk of urinary retention. 
Additionally, it was also concluded from the same pooled 
data, that gastroesophageal reflux, whose incidence rate 
was observed to be 0.4%, should be added as an adverse 
drug reaction. The search in the safety database confirmed 
4 cases where 3 of the 4 cases provided very little 
information. The remaining case involved a 70-year-old 
male patient who experienced acid reflux during the first 
week of starting fesoterodine 8 mg daily. The frequency of 
gastroesophageal reflux is considered as 'uncommon'.

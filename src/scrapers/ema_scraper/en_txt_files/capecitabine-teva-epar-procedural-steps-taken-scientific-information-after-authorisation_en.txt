are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Please refer to the assessment report: Capecitabine Teva 
EMEA/H/A-31/1481/C/002362/0031 
France requested on 13 March 2019 the opinion of 
the European Medicines Agency to assess the need 
to take action at EU level regarding the detection of 
DPD deficient patients (especially through 
genotyping and/or phenotyping) in patients treated 
with fluorouracil and related substances 
(capecitabine, tegafur and flucytosine). The Agency 
was requested to assess the impact thereof on the 
benefit-risk balance of fluorouracil and related 
substances containing products and to give its 
opinion on whether the marketing authorisation of 
these products should be maintained, varied, 
suspended or revoked.

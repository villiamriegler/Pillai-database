Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and

marketing authorisation was granted, the CHMP considers 
by consensus  that the risk-benefit balance of Firmagon in 
the treatment of adult male patients with advanced 
hormone-dependent  prostate cancer  remains favourable 
and therefore recommends the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation  with unlimited validity.

trial with subcutaneous  injections of degarelix one-month 
depot or intramuscular injections  of leuprolide one- and 
three-month depot in patients with advanced  prostatic 
carcinoma and with rising serum PSA levels after curative 
intent. Patients were administered Firmagon for seven 
months followed by a seven months monitoring period. In 
this study, the median time to testosterone  >0.5 ng/mL 
(above castrate level) after discontinuation  of treatment 
was 112  days and  the median time to testosterone  >1.5 
ng/mL (above lower limit of normal range) was 168  days. 
Results from two randomised, active controlled studies 
(CS30 and CS31) showed  that three months therapy with 
degarelix (240/80 mg dose regimen) resulted in a 37% 
reduction  in prostate volume as measured  by trans-rectal 
ultrasound  scan (TRUS) in patients requiring hormonal 
therapy prior to radiotherapy and in patients who were 
candidates for medical castration. The prostate volume 
reduction  was similar to that attained with goserelin plus 
anti-androgen  protection. 
Study CS21 provided immunogenicity data for up to 5.5 
years. In this study, anti-degarelix antibody development 
was observed in 29% of patients after treatment with 
Firmagon after up to 5.5 years.  
Data obtained from these studies have been adequately 
reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

data on effect of degarelix on QT/QTc supported  by 
the results of the study CS22 (FUM 030). In addition, 
section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated to delete 
the statement that data available on degarelix is 
limited to one year based on the results of the long 
term studies  CS12A, CS14A and CS21A. 
Furthermore, section 4.8 of the SmPC has been 
updated to include anaphylaxis reactions further to 
the request of the CHMP during the assessment of 
the 4th PSUR. The package leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the list of local representatives  in the Package 
Leaflet. 
Furthermore, the MAH took this opportunity  to bring 
the PI in line with the latest QRD template version

intrinsic effect of degarelix on cardiac  epolarisation (QTcF), 
heart rate, AV conduction, cardiac depolarisation, or T or U 
wave morphology was confirmed in healthy subjects 
(N=80) receiving an i.v. infusion of degarelix over 60 
minutes, reaching  a mean Cmax of 222  ng/mL, 
approximately 3-4-fold the Cmax obtained during  prostate 
cancer  treatment.  
Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC have been updated  to 
reflect these results. 
In addition, section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated  in 
order to include that rare reports of anaphylactic  reactions 
have been received from post-marketing use of firmagon. 
Finally the statement ‘‘the data available on efficacy and 
safety experience with degarelix is limited to a one year 
treatment’’ has been removed from section 4.4 of the 
SmPC since long-term (up to >5 years) efficacy and safety 
data are available based  on the results from studies  CS12A,

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Inovelon is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures associated with 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 1 year of age and older.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment with rufinamide should be initiated by a physician specialised in paediatrics or neurology 
with experience in the treatment of epilepsy.
Inovelon oral suspension and Inovelon film-coated tablets may be interchanged at equal doses. 
Patients should be monitored during the switch over period.

Posology
Use in children from 1 year to less than 4 years of age
Patients not receiving valproate:
Treatment should be initiated at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day administered in two equally divided doses
separated by approximately 12 hours. According to clinical response and tolerability, the dose may be 
increased by up to 10 mg/kg/day every third day to a target dose of 45 mg/kg/day administered in two 
equally divided doses separated by approximately 12 hours. For this patient population, the maximum 
recommended dose is 45 mg/kg/day.
Patients receiving valproate:
As valproate significantly decreases clearance of rufinamide, a lower maximum dose of Inovelon is 
recommended for patients being co-administered valproate. Treatment should be initiated at a dose 
of 10 mg/kg/day administered in two equally divided doses separated by approximately 12 hours. 
According to clinical response and tolerability, the dose may be increased by up to 10 mg/kg/day 
every third day to a target dose of 30 mg/kg/day administered in two equally divided doses separated 
by approximately 12 hours. For this patient population, the maximum recommended dose 
is 30 mg/kg/day.
If the recommended calculated dose of Inovelon is not achievable, the dose should be given to the 
nearest whole 100 mg tablet.
Use in children 4 years of age or older and less than 30 kg
Patients < 30 kg not receiving valproate:
Treatment should be initiated at a daily dose of 200 mg. According to clinical response and 
tolerability, the dose may be increased by 200 mg/day increments, as frequently as every third day, up 
to a maximum recommended dose of 1,000 mg/day.
Doses of up to 3,600 mg/day have been studied in a limited number of patients.
Patients < 30 kg also receiving valproate:
As valproate significantly decreases clearance of rufinamide, a lower maximum dose of Inovelon is 
recommended for patients < 30 kg being co-administered valproate. Treatment should be initiated at a 
daily dose of 200 mg. According to clinical response and tolerability, after a minimum of 2 days the 
dose may be increased by 200 mg/day, to the maximum recommended dose of 600 mg/day.
Use in adults, adolescents and children 4 years of age or older of 30 kg or over
Patients > 30 kg not receiving valproate:
Treatment should be initiated at a daily dose of 400 mg. According to clinical response and 
tolerability, the dose may be increased by 400 mg/day increments, as frequently as every other day, up 
to a maximum recommended dose as indicated in the table below.

Elderly
There is limited information on the use of rufinamide in older people. Since the pharmacokinetics of 
rufinamide are not altered in older people (see section 5.2), dosage adjustment is not required in 
patients over 65 years of age.
Renal impairment
A study in patients with severe renal impairment indicated that no dose adjustments are required for 
these patients (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
Use in patients with hepatic impairment has not been studied. Caution and careful dose titration is 
recommended when treating patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Use in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment is not recommended.
Discontinuation of rufinamide
When rufinamide treatment is to be discontinued, it should be withdrawn gradually. In clinical trials 
rufinamide discontinuation was achieved by reducing the dose by approximately 25% every two days 
(see section 4.4).
In the case of one or more missed doses, individualised clinical judgement is necessary.
Uncontrolled open-label studies suggest sustained long-term efficacy, although no controlled study has 
been conducted for longer than three months.
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of rufinamide in new-born infants or infants and toddlers aged less than 1 year 
have not been established. No data are available (see section 5.2).
Method of administration
Rufinamide is for oral use.
The tablet should be taken twice daily with water in the morning and in the evening, in two equally 
divided doses.
Inovelon should be administered with food (see section 5.2). If the patient has difficulty with 
swallowing, tablets can be crushed and administered in half a glass of water. Alternatively, use the 
score line to break the tablet into two equal halves.

4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, triazole derivatives or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Status epilepticus
Status epilepticus cases have been observed during treatment with rufinamide in clinical development 
studies, whereas no such cases were observed with placebo. These events led to rufinamide 
discontinuation in 20% of the cases. If patients develop new seizure types and/or experience an 
increased frequency of status epilepticus that is different from the patient’s baseline condition, then the 
benefit-risk ratio of the therapy should be reassessed.
Withdrawal of rufinamide
Rufinamide should be withdrawn gradually to reduce the possibility of seizures on withdrawal. In 
clinical studies discontinuation was achieved by reducing the dose by approximately 25% every two 
days. There are insufficient data on the withdrawal of concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products 
once seizure control has been achieved with the addition of rufinamide.
Central Nervous System reactions
Rufinamide treatment has been associated with dizziness, somnolence, ataxia and gait disturbances, 
which could increase the occurrence of accidental falls in this population (see section 4.8). Patients 
and carers should exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of this medicinal 
product.
Hypersensitivity reactions
Serious antiepileptic medicinal product hypersensitivity syndrome including DRESS (Drug Reaction 
with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have occurred in 
association with rufinamide therapy. Signs and symptoms of this disorder were diverse; however, 
patients typically, although not exclusively, presented with fever and rash associated with other organ 
system involvement. Other associated manifestations included lymphadenopathy, liver function tests 
abnormalities, and haematuria. As the disorder is variable in its expression, other organ system signs 
and symptoms not noted here may occur. The antiepileptic drug (AED) hypersensitivity syndrome 
occurred in close temporal association to the initiation of rufinamide therapy and in the paediatric 
population. If this reaction is suspected, rufinamide should be discontinued and alternative treatment 
started. All patients who develop a rash while taking rufinamide must be closely monitored.
QT shortening
In a thorough QT study, rufinamide produced a decrease in QTc interval proportional to concentration. 
Although the underlying mechanism and safety relevance of this finding is not known, clinicians 
should use clinical judgment when assessing whether to prescribe rufinamide to patients at risk from 
further shortening their QTc duration (e.g., Congenital Short QT Syndrome or patients with a family 
history of such a syndrome).
Women of childbearing potential
Women of childbearing potential must use contraceptive measures during treatment with Inovelon. 
Physicians should try to ensure that appropriate contraception is used, and should use clinical 
judgement when assessing whether oral contraceptives, or the doses of the oral contraceptive 
components, are adequate, based on the individual patients clinical situation (see sections 4.5 and 4.6).
5
Lactose
Inovelon contains lactose, therefore patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the 
Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.
Sodium content
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per daily dose, i.e. is essentially ‘sodium-
free’.
Suicidal ideation
Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic agents in 
several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of anti-epileptic 
medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The 
mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an 
increased risk for Inovelon.
Therefore patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate 
treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical 
advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Potential for other medicinal products to affect rufinamide
Other antiepileptic medicinal products
Rufinamide concentrations are not subject to clinically relevant changes on co-administration with 
known enzyme inducing antiepileptic medicinal products.
For patients on Inovelon treatment who have administration of valproate initiated, significant increases 
in rufinamide plasma concentrations may occur. Therefore, consideration should be given to a dose 
reduction of Inovelon in patients who are initiated on valproate therapy (see section 4.2).
The addition or withdrawal of these medicinal products or adjusting of the dose of these medicinal 
products during rufinamide therapy may require an adjustment in dosage of rufinamide (see 
section 4.2).
No significant changes in rufinamide concentration are observed following co-administration with 
lamotrigine, topiramate or benzodiazepines.
Potential for rufinamide to affect other medicinal products
Other antiepileptic medicinal products
The pharmacokinetic interactions between rufinamide and other antiepileptic medicinal products have 
been evaluated in patients with epilepsy, using population pharmacokinetic modelling. Rufinamide
appears not to have a clinically relevant effect on carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, 
topiramate, phenytoin or valproate steady state concentrations.
Oral contraceptives
Co-administration of rufinamide 800 mg twice daily and a combined oral contraceptive
(ethinyloestradiol 35 μg and norethindrone 1 mg) for 14 days resulted in a mean decrease in the 
ethinyl estradiol AUC0-24 of 22% and in norethindrone AUC0-24 of 14%. Studies with other oral or 
implant contraceptives have not been conducted. Women of child-bearing potential using hormonal 
contraceptives are advised to use an additional safe and effective contraceptive method (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.6).
6
Cytochrome P450 enzymes
Rufinamide is metabolised by hydrolysis, and is not metabolised to any notable degree by cytochrome 
P450 enzymes. Furthermore, rufinamide does not inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes 
(see section 5.2). Thus, clinically significant interactions mediated through inhibition of cytochrome 
P450 system by rufinamide are unlikely to occur. Rufinamide has been shown to induce the 
cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 and may therefore reduce the plasma concentrations of substances 
which are metabolised by this enzyme. The effect was modest to moderate. The mean 
CYP3A4 activity, assessed as clearance of triazolam, was increased by 55% after 11 days of treatment 
with rufinamide 400 mg twice daily. The exposure of triazolam was reduced by 36%. Higher 
rufinamide doses may result in a more pronounced induction. It may not be excluded that rufinamide 
may also decrease the exposure of substances metabolised by other enzymes, or transported by 
transport proteins such as P-glycoprotein.
It is recommended that patients treated with substances that are metabolised by the CYP3A4 enzyme 
system are to be carefully monitored for two weeks at the start of, or after the end of treatment with 
rufinamide, or after any marked change in the dose. A dose adjustment of the concomitantly 
administered medicinal product may need to be considered. These recommendations should also be 
considered when rufinamide is used concomitantly with substances with a narrow therapeutic window 
such as warfarin and digoxin.
A specific interaction study in healthy subjects revealed no influence of rufinamide at a dose 
of 400 mg twice daily on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine, a CYP1A2 substrate.
No data on the interaction of rufinamide with alcohol are available.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
Risk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general:
It has been shown that in the offspring of women with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is 
two to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population. In the treated 
population, an increase in malformations has been noted with polytherapy; however, the extent to 
which the treatment and/or the illness is responsible has not been elucidated.
Moreover, effective antiepileptic therapy should not be interrupted abruptly, since the aggravation of 
the illness is detrimental to both the mother and the foetus. AED treatment during pregnancy should be 
carefully discussed with the treating physician.
Risk related to rufinamide:
Studies in animals revealed no teratogenic effect, but foetotoxicity in the presence of maternal toxicity 
was observed (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.
For rufinamide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.
Taking these data into consideration, rufinamide should not be used during pregnancy, or in women of 
childbearing age not using contraceptive measures, unless clearly necessary.
Women of childbearing potential must use contraceptive measures during treatment with rufinamide. 
Physicians should try to ensure that appropriate contraception is used, and should use clinical 
judgement when assessing whether oral contraceptives, or the doses of the oral contraceptive 
components, are adequate based on the individual patients clinical situation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).
If women treated with rufinamide plan to become pregnant, the continued use of this product should 
be carefully weighed. During pregnancy, interruption of an effective antiepileptic can be detrimental 
to both the mother and the foetus if it results in aggravation of the illness.
7
Breast-feeding
It is not known if rufinamide is excreted in human breast milk. Due to the potential harmful effects for 
the breast-fed infant, breast-feeding should be avoided during maternal treatment with rufinamide.
Fertility
No data are available on the effects on fertility following treatment with rufinamide.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Inovelon may cause dizziness, somnolence and blurred vision. Depending on the individual 
sensitivity, rufinamide may have a minor to major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Patients must be advised to exercise caution during activities requiring a high degree of alertness, e.g., 
driving or operating machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The clinical development program has included over 1,900 patients, with different types of epilepsy, 
exposed to rufinamide. The most commonly reported adverse reactions overall were headache, 
dizziness, fatigue, and somnolence. The most common adverse reactions observed at a higher 
incidence than placebo in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were somnolence and vomiting. 
Adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity. The discontinuation rate in 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome due to adverse reactions was 8.2% for patients receiving rufinamide 
and 0% for patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse reactions resulting in 
discontinuation from the rufinamide treatment group were rash and vomiting.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Adverse reactions reported with an incidence greater than placebo, during the Lennox-Gastaut 
syndrome double-blind studies or in the overall rufinamide-exposed population, are listed in the table 
below by MedDRA preferred term, system organ class and by frequency.
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10),

Additional information on special populations
Paediatric Population (age 1 to less than 4 years)
In a multicentre, open-label study comparing the addition of rufinamide to any other AED of the 
investigator’s choice to the existing regimen of 1 to 3 AEDs in paediatric patients, 1 to less 
than 4 years of age with inadequately controlled LGS, 25 patients, of which 10 subjects were 
aged 1 to 2 years, were exposed to rufinamide as adjunctive therapy for 24 weeks at a dose of up 
to 45 mg/kg/day, in 2 divided doses. The most frequently reported TEAEs in the rufinamide treatment 
group (occurring in ≥ 10% of subjects) were upper respiratory tract infection and vomiting (28.0% 
each), pneumonia and somnolence (20.0% each), sinusitis, otitis media, diarrhoea, cough and pyrexia 
(16.0% each), and bronchitis, constipation, nasal congestion, rash, irritability and decreased appetite 
(12.0% each). The frequency, type and severity of these adverse reactions were similar to that in 
children 4 years of age and older, adolescents and adults. Age characterisation in patients less 
than 4 years was not identified in the limited safety database due to small number of patients in the 
study.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
After an acute overdose, the stomach may be emptied by gastric lavage or by induction of emesis. 
There is no specific antidote for rufinamide. Treatment should be supportive and may include 
haemodialysis (see section 5.2).
Multiple dosing of 7,200 mg/day was associated with no major signs or symptoms.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, carboxamide derivatives; ATC code: N03AF03.
Mechanism of action
Rufinamide modulates the activity of sodium channels, prolonging their inactive state. Rufinamide is 
active in a range of animal models of epilepsy.
10
Clinical experience
Inovelon (rufinamide tablets) was administered in a double blind, placebo-controlled study, at doses of 
up to 45 mg/kg/day for 84 days, to 139 patients with inadequately controlled seizures associated with 
Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (including both atypical absence seizures and drop attacks). Male and 
female patients (between 4 and 30 years of age) were eligible if they had a history of multiple seizure 
types, which had to include atypical absence seizures and drop attacks (i.e., tonic–atonic or astatic 
seizures); were being treated with 1 to 3 concomitant fixed dose antiepileptic medicinal products; a 
minimum of 90 seizures in the month before the 28-day baseline period; an EEG within 6 months of 
study entry demonstrating a pattern of slow spike-and-wave complexes (2.5 Hz); a weight of at 
least 18 kg; and a CT scan or MRI study confirming the absence of a progressive lesion. All seizures 
were classified according to the International League Against Epilepsy Revised Classification of 
Seizures. As it is difficult for caregivers to precisely separate tonic and atonic seizures, the 
international expert panel of child neurologists agreed to group these seizure types and call them 
tonic–atonic seizures or “drop attacks”. As such, drop attacks were used as one of the primary end 
points. A significant improvement was observed for all three primary variables: the percentage change 
in total seizure frequency per 28 days during the maintenance phase relative to baseline (-35.8% on 
Inovelon vs. –1.6% on placebo, p=0.0006), the number of tonic-atonic seizures (-42.9% on Inovelon 
vs. 2.2% on placebo, p=0.0002), and the seizure severity rating from the Global Evaluation performed 
by the parent/guardian at the end of the double-blind phase (much or very much improved in 32.2% on 
Inovelon vs. 14.5% on the placebo arm, p=0.0041).
Additionally, Inovelon (rufinamide oral suspension) was administered in a multicentre, open-label 
study comparing the addition of rufinamide to the addition of any other AED of the investigator’s 
choice to the existing regimen of 1 to 3 AEDs in paediatric patients, 1 to less than 4 years of age with 
inadequately controlled LGS. In this study, 25 patients were exposed to rufinamide as adjunctive 
therapy for 24 weeks at a dose of up to 45 mg/kg/day, in 2 divided doses. A total of 12 patients 
received any other AED at the investigator’s discretion in the control arm. The study was mainly 
designed for safety and not adequately powered to show a difference with regards to the seizure 
efficacy variables. The adverse event profile was similar to that in children 4 years of age and older, 
adolescents, and adults. In addition, the study investigated the cognitive development, behaviour and 
language development of subjects treated with rufinamide compared to subjects receiving 
any-other-AED. The Least Square mean change of the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) Total 
Problems score after 2 years of treatment were 53.75 for the any other AED group and 56.35 for the 
rufinamide group (LS mean difference [95% CI] +2.60 [-10.5,15.7]; p=0.6928), and the difference 
between treatments was -2.776 (95% CI: -13.3, 7.8, p=0.5939).
Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling demonstrated that the reduction of total and 
tonic-atonic seizure frequencies, the improvement of the global evaluation of seizure severity and the 
increase in probability of reduction of seizure frequency were dependent on rufinamide 
concentrations.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Maximum plasma levels are reached approximately 6 hours after administration. Peak concentration 
(Cmax) and plasma AUC of rufinamide increase less than proportionally with doses in both fasted and 
fed healthy subjects and in patients, probably due to dose-limited absorption behaviour. After single 
doses, food increases the bioavailability (AUC) of rufinamide by approximately 34% and the peak 
plasma concentration by 56%.
Inovelon oral suspension and Inovelon film-coated tablets have been demonstrated to be 
bioequivalent.
11
Distribution
In in -vitro studies, only a small fraction of rufinamide (34%) was bound to human serum proteins 
with albumin accounting for approximately 80% of this binding. This indicates minimal risk of 
drug-drug interactions by displacement from binding sites during concomitant administration of other 
substances. Rufinamide was evenly distributed between erythrocytes and plasma.
Biotransformation
Rufinamide is almost exclusively eliminated by metabolism. The main pathway of metabolism is 
hydrolysis of the carboxylamide group to the pharmacologically inactive acid derivative CGP 47292. 
Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is very minor. The formation of small amounts of glutathione 
conjugates cannot be completely excluded.
Rufinamide has demonstrated little or no significant capacity in -vitro to act as a competitive or 
mechanism-based inhibitor of the following human P450 enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5 or CYP4A9/11-2.
Elimination
The plasma elimination half-life is approximately 6-10 hours in healthy subjects and patients with 
epilepsy. When given twice daily at 12-hourly intervals, rufinamide accumulates to the extent 
predicted by its terminal half-life, indicating that the pharmacokinetics of rufinamide are 
time-independent (i.e. no autoinduction of metabolism).
In a radiotracer study in three healthy volunteers, the parent compound (rufinamide) was the main 
radioactive component in plasma, representing about 80% of the total radioactivity, and the metabolite 
CGP 47292 constituting only about 15%. Renal excretion was the predominant route of elimination 
for active substance related material, accounting for 84.7% of the dose.
Linearity/non-linearity:
The bioavailability of rufinamide is dependent on dose. As dose increases, the bioavailability 
decreases.
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups
Sex
Population pharmacokinetic modelling has been used to evaluate the influence of sex on the 
pharmacokinetics of rufinamide. Such evaluations indicate that sex does not affect the 
pharmacokinetics of rufinamide to a clinically relevant extent.
Renal impairment
The pharmacokinetics of a single 400 mg dose of rufinamide were not altered in subjects with chronic 
and severe renal failure compared to healthy volunteers. However, plasma levels were reduced by 
approximately 30% when haemodialysis was applied after administration of rufinamide, suggesting 
that this may be a useful procedure in case of overdose (see sections 4.2 and 4.9).
Hepatic impairment
No studies have been performed in patients with hepatic impairment and therefore Inovelon should not 
be administered to patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).
Elderly
A pharmacokinetic study in older healthy volunteers did not show a significant difference in 
pharmacokinetic parameters compared with younger adults.
12
Children (1-12 years)
Children generally have lower clearance of rufinamide than adults, and this difference is related to 
body size with rufinamide clearance increasing with body weight.
A recent population PK analysis of rufinamide on data pooled from 139 subjects (115 LGS patients 
and 24 healthy subjects), including 83 paediatric LGS patients (10 patients 
aged 1 to < 2 years, 14 patients aged 2 to < 4 years, 14 patients aged 4 to < 8 years, 21 patients 
aged 8 to < 12 years and 24 patients aged 12 to < 18 years) indicated that when rufinamide is dosed on 
a mg/kg/day basis in LGS subjects aged 1 to < 4 years, comparable exposure to that in LGS patients 
aged ≥ 4 years, in which efficacy has been demostrated, is achieved.
Studies in new-born infants or infants and toddlers under 1 year of age have not been conducted.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Conventional safety pharmacology studies revealed no special hazards at clinically relevant doses.
Toxicities observed in dogs at levels similar to human exposure at the maximum recommended dose 
were liver changes, including bile thrombi, cholestasis and liver enzyme elevations thought to be 
related to increased bile secretion in this species. No evidence of an associated risk was identified in 
the rat and monkey repeat dose toxicity studies.
In reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, there were reductions in foetal growth and 
survival, and some stillbirths secondary to maternal toxicity. However, no effects on morphology and 
function, including learning or memory, were observed in the offspring. Rufinamide was not 
teratogenic in mice, rats or rabbits.
The toxicity profile of rufinamide in juvenile animals was similar to that in adult animals. Decreased 
body weight gain was observed in both juvenile and adult rats and dogs. Mild toxicity in the liver was 
observed in juvenile as well as in adult animals at exposure levels lower than or similar to those 
reached in patients. Reversibility of all findings was demonstrated after stopping treatment.
Rufinamide was not genotoxic and had no carcinogenic potential. An adverse effect not observed in 
clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with 
possible relevance to human use, was myelofibrosis of the bone marrow in the mouse carcinogenicity 
study. Benign bone neoplasms (osteomas) and hyperostosis seen in mice were considered a result of 
the activation of a mouse specific virus by fluoride ions released during the oxidative metabolism of 
rufinamide.
Regarding the immunotoxic potential, small thymus and thymic involution were observed in dogs in 
a 13-week study with significant response at the high dose in male. In the 13-week study, female bone 
marrow and lymphoid changes are reported at the high dose with a weak incidence. In rats, decreased 
cellularity of the bone marrow and thymic atrophy were observed only in the carcinogenicity study.
Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA):
Environmental risk assessment studies have shown that rufinamide is very persistent in the 
environment (see section 6.6).

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Inovelon is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures associated with 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 1 year of age and older.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment with rufinamide should be initiated by a physician specialised in paediatrics or neurology 
with experience in the treatment of epilepsy.
Inovelon oral suspension and Inovelon film-coated tablets may be interchanged at equal doses. 
Patients should be monitored during the switch over period.
Posology
Use in children from 1 year to less than 4 years of age
Patients not receiving valproate:
Treatment should be initiated at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (0.25 ml/kg/day) administered in two equally 
divided doses separated by approximately 12 hours. According to clinical response and tolerability, 
the dose may be increased by up to 10 mg/kg/day (0.25 ml/kg/day) every third day to a target dose 
of 45 mg/kg/day (1.125 ml/kg/day) administered in two equally divided doses separated by
approximately 12 hours. For this patient population, the maximum recommended dose 
is 45 mg/kg/day (1.125 ml/kg/day).
16
Patients receiving valproate:
As valproate significantly decreases clearance of rufinamide, a lower maximum dose of Inovelon is 
recommended for patients being co-administered valproate. Treatment should be initiated at a dose 
of 10 mg/kg/day (0.25 ml/kg/day) administered in two equally divided doses separated by 
approximately 12 hours. According to clinical response and tolerability, the dose may be increased by 
up to 10 mg/kg/day (0.25 ml/kg/day) every third day to a target dose of 30 mg/kg/day 
(0.75 ml/kg/day) administered in two equally divided doses separated by approximately 12 hours. For 
this patient population, the maximum recommended dose is 30 mg/kg/day (0.75 ml/kg/day).
If the recommended calculated dose of Inovelon is not achievable, the dose should be given to the 
nearest 0.5 ml of rufinamide.
Use in children 4 years of age or older and less than 30 kg
Patients < 30 kg not receiving valproate:
Treatment should be initiated at a daily dose of 200 mg (5 ml dosing suspension given as two 2.5 ml 
doses, one in the morning and one in the evening). According to clinical response and tolerability, the 
dose may be increased by 200 mg/day increments, as frequently as every third day, up to a maximum 
recommended dose of 1,000 mg/day (25 ml/day).
Doses of up to 3,600 mg/day (90 ml/day) have been studied in a limited number of patients.
Patients < 30 kg also receiving valproate:
As valproate significantly decreases clearance of rufinamide, a lower maximum dose of Inovelon is 
recommended for patients < 30 kg being co-administered valproate. Treatment should be initiated at a 
daily dose of 200 mg. According to clinical response and tolerability, after a minimum of 2 days the 
dose may be increased by 200 mg/day, to the maximum recommended dose of 600 mg/day 
(15 ml/day).
Use in adults, adolescents and children 4 years of age or older of 30 kg or over
Patients > 30 kg not receiving valproate:
Treatment should be initiated at a daily dose of 400 mg (10 ml dosing suspension given as two 5 ml 
doses). According to clinical response and tolerability, the dose may be increased by 400 mg/day 
increments, as frequently as every other day, up to a maximum recommended dose as indicated in the
table below.

Elderly
There is limited information on the use of rufinamide in older people. Since the pharmacokinetics of 
rufinamide are not altered in older people (see section 5.2), dosage adjustment is not required in 
patients over 65 years of age.
Renal impairment
A study in patients with severe renal impairment indicated that no dose adjustments are required for 
these patients (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
Use in patients with hepatic impairment has not been studied. Caution and careful dose titration is 
recommended when treating patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Use in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment is not recommended.
Discontinuation of rufinamide
When rufinamide treatment is to be discontinued, it should be withdrawn gradually. In clinical trials 
rufinamide discontinuation was achieved by reducing the dose by approximately 25% every two days
(see section 4.4).
In the case of one or more missed doses, individualised clinical judgement is necessary.
Uncontrolled open-label studies suggest sustained long-term efficacy, although no controlled study has 
been conducted for longer than three months.
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of rufinamide in new-born infants or infants and toddlers aged less than 1 year 
have not been established. No data are available (see section 5.2).
Method of administration
Rufinamide is for oral use.
The suspension should be taken twice daily in the morning and in the evening, in two equally divided 
doses.
Inovelon should be administered with food (see section 5.2).
The oral suspension should be shaken vigorously before every administration. See section 6.6 for 
further details.
The prescribed dose of Inovelon oral suspension can be administered via an enteral feeding tube. 
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the feeding tube to administer the medicine.  To ensure 
adequate dosing, after administration of the oral suspension, the enteral feeding tube must be flushed 
at least once with 1 ml of water.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, triazole derivatives or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Status epilepticus
Status epilepticus cases have been observed during treatment with rufinamide in clinical development 
studies, whereas no such cases were observed with placebo. These events led to rufinamide 
18
discontinuation in 20% of the cases. If patients develop new seizure types and/or experience an 
increased frequency of status epilepticus that is different from the patient’s baseline condition, then the 
benefit-risk ratio of the therapy should be reassessed.
Withdrawal of rufinamide
Rufinamide should be withdrawn gradually to reduce the possibility of seizures on withdrawal. In 
clinical studies discontinuation was achieved by reducing the dose by approximately 25% every two 
days. There are insufficient data on the withdrawal of concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products 
once seizure control has been achieved with the addition of rufinamide.
Central Nervous System reactions
Rufinamide treatment has been associated with dizziness, somnolence, ataxia and gait disturbances, 
which could increase the occurrence of accidental falls in this population (see section 4.8). Patients 
and carers should exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of this medicinal 
product.
Hypersensitivity reactions
Serious antiepileptic medicinal product hypersensitivity syndrome including DRESS (Drug Reaction 
with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have occurred in 
association with rufinamide therapy. Signs and symptoms of this disorder were diverse; however, 
patients typically, although not exclusively, presented with fever and rash associated with other organ 
system involvement. Other associated manifestations included lymphadenopathy, liver function tests 
abnormalities, and haematuria. As the disorder is variable in its expression, other organ system signs 
and symptoms not noted here may occur. The antiepileptic drug (AED) hypersensitivity syndrome 
occurred in close temporal association to the initiation of rufinamide therapy and in the paediatric 
population. If this reaction is suspected, rufinamide should be discontinued and alternative treatment 
started. All patients who develop a rash while taking rufinamide must be closely monitored.
QT shortening
In a thorough QT study, rufinamide produced a decrease in QTc interval proportional to concentration. 
Although the underlying mechanism and safety relevance of this finding is not known, clinicians 
should use clinical judgment when assessing whether to prescribe rufinamide to patients at risk from 
further shortening their QTc duration (e.g., Congenital Short QT Syndrome or patients with a family 
history of such a syndrome).
Women of childbearing potential
Women of childbearing potential must use contraceptive measures during treatment with Inovelon. 
Physicians should try to ensure that appropriate contraception is used, and should use clinical 
judgement when assessing whether oral contraceptives, or the doses of the oral contraceptive 
components, are adequate, based on the individual patients clinical situation (see sections 4.5 and 4.6).
19
Parahydroxybenzoates
Inovelon oral suspension contains parahydroxybenzoates which may cause allergic reactions (possibly 
delayed).
Sorbitol (E420)
Each mL of Inovelon oral suspension contains 175 mg sorbitol (E420).
Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) should not take this medicinal product.
Caution should be exercised when combining Inovelon oral suspension with other antiepileptic 
medications containing sorbitol, since a combined intake of over 1 gram of sorbitol may affect 
absorption of some drugs. 
Benzoic Acid (E210)
Each mL of Inovelon oral suspension contains less than 0.01 mg benzoic acid (E210).
Benzoic acid can displace bilirubin from albumin, leading to increase in bilirubinaemia. This may 
increase neonatal jaundice which may develop into kernicterus (non-conjugated bilirubin deposits in 
the brain tissue).
Sodium content
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per daily dose, i.e. is essentially ‘sodium-
free’.
Suicidal ideation
Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic agents in 
several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of anti-epileptic 
medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The 
mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an 
increased risk for Inovelon.
Therefore patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate 
treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical 
advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Potential for other medicinal products to affect rufinamide
Other antiepileptic medicinal products
Rufinamide concentrations are not subject to clinically relevant changes on co-administration with 
known enzyme inducing antiepileptic medicinal products.
For patients on Inovelon treatment who have administration of valproate initiated, significant increases 
in rufinamide plasma concentrations may occur. Therefore, consideration should be given to a dose 
reduction of Inovelon in patients who are initiated on valproate therapy (see section 4.2).
The addition or withdrawal of these medicinal products or adjusting of the dose of these medicinal 
products during rufinamide therapy may require an adjustment in dosage of rufinamide (see 
section 4.2).
No significant changes in rufinamide concentration are observed following co-administration with 
lamotrigine, topiramate or benzodiazepines.
20
Potential for rufinamide to affect other medicinal products
Other antiepileptic medicinal products
The pharmacokinetic interactions between rufinamide and other antiepileptic medicinal products have 
been evaluated in patients with epilepsy, using population pharmacokinetic modelling. Rufinamide 
appears not to have a clinically relevant effect on carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, 
topiramate, phenytoin or valproate steady state concentrations.
Oral contraceptives
Co-administration of rufinamide 800 mg twice daily and a combined oral contraceptive 
(ethinyloestradiol 35 μg and norethindrone 1 mg) for 14 days resulted in a mean decrease in the 
ethinyl estradiol AUC0-24 of 22% and in norethindrone AUC0-24 of 14%. Studies with other oral or 
implant contraceptives have not been conducted. Women of child-bearing potential using hormonal 
contraceptives are advised to use an additional safe and effective contraceptive method (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.6).
Cytochrome P450 enzymes
Rufinamide is metabolised by hydrolysis, and is not metabolised to any notable degree by cytochrome 
P450 enzymes. Furthermore, rufinamide does not inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes 
(see section 5.2). Thus, clinically significant interactions mediated through inhibition of cytochrome 
P450 system by rufinamide are unlikely to occur. Rufinamide has been shown to induce the 
cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 and may therefore reduce the plasma concentrations of substances 
which are metabolised by this enzyme. The effect was modest to moderate. The mean 
CYP3A4 activity, assessed as clearance of triazolam, was increased by 55% after 11 days of treatment 
with rufinamide 400 mg twice daily. The exposure of triazolam was reduced by 36%. Higher 
rufinamide doses may result in a more pronounced induction. It may not be excluded that rufinamide 
may also decrease the exposure of substances metabolised by other enzymes, or transported by 
transport proteins such as P-glycoprotein.
It is recommended that patients treated with substances that are metabolised by the CYP3A4 enzyme 
system are to be carefully monitored for two weeks at the start of, or after the end of treatment with
rufinamide, or after any marked change in the dose. A dose adjustment of the concomitantly 
administered medicinal product may need to be considered. These recommendations should also be 
considered when rufinamide is used concomitantly with substances with a narrow therapeutic window 
such as warfarin and digoxin.
A specific interaction study in healthy subjects revealed no influence of rufinamide at a dose 
of 400 mg twice daily on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine, a CYP1A2 substrate.
No data on the interaction of rufinamide with alcohol are available.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
Risk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general:
It has been shown that in the offspring of women with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is 
two to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population. In the treated 
population, an increase in malformations has been noted with polytherapy; however, the extent to 
which the treatment and/or the illness is responsible has not been elucidated.
Moreover, effective antiepileptic therapy should not be interrupted abruptly, since the aggravation of 
the illness is detrimental to both the mother and the foetus. AED treatment during pregnancy should be 
carefully discussed with the treating physician.
21
Risk related to rufinamide:
Studies in animals revealed no teratogenic effect, but foetotoxicity in the presence of maternal toxicity 
was observed (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.
For rufinamide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.
Taking these data into consideration, rufinamide should not be used during pregnancy, or in women of 
childbearing age not using contraceptive measures, unless clearly necessary.
Women of childbearing potential must use contraceptive measures during treatment with rufinamide. 
Physicians should try to ensure that appropriate contraception is used, and should use clinical 
judgement when assessing whether oral contraceptives, or the doses of the oral contraceptive 
components, are adequate based on the individual patients clinical situation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).
If women treated with rufinamide plan to become pregnant, the continued use of this product should 
be carefully weighed. During pregnancy, interruption of an effective antiepileptic can be detrimental 
to both the mother and the foetus if it results in aggravation of the illness.
Breast-feeding
It is not known if rufinamide is excreted in human breast milk. Due to the potential harmful effects for 
the breast-fed infant, breast-feeding should be avoided during maternal treatment with rufinamide.
Fertility
No data are available on the effects on fertility following treatment with rufinamide.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Inovelon may cause dizziness, somnolence and blurred vision. Depending on the individual 
sensitivity, rufinamide may have a minor to major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Patients must be advised to exercise caution during activities requiring a high degree of alertness, e.g., 
driving or operating machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The clinical development program has included over 1,900 patients, with different types of epilepsy, 
exposed to rufinamide. The most commonly reported adverse reactions overall were headache, 
dizziness, fatigue, and somnolence. The most common adverse reactions observed at a higher 
incidence than placebo in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were somnolence and vomiting. 
Adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity. The discontinuation rate in 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome due to adverse reactions was 8.2% for patients receiving rufinamide 
and 0% for patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse reactions resulting in 
discontinuation from the rufinamide treatment group were rash and vomiting.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Adverse reactions reported with an incidence greater than placebo, during the Lennox-Gastaut 
syndrome double-blind studies or in the overall rufinamide-exposed population, are listed in the table 
below by MedDRA preferred term, system organ class and by frequency.
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10),

Additional information on special populations
Paediatric Population (age 1 to less than 4 years)
In a multicentre, open-label study comparing the addition of rufinamide to any other AED of the 
investigator’s choice to the existing regimen of 1 to 3 AEDs in paediatric patients, 1 to less 
than 4 years of age with inadequately controlled LGS, 25 patients, of which 10 subjects were 
aged 1 to 2 years, were exposed to rufinamide as adjunctive therapy for 24 weeks at a dose of up 
to 45 mg/kg/day, in 2 divided doses. The most frequently reported TEAEs in the rufinamide treatment 
group (occurring in ≥ 10% of subjects) were upper respiratory tract infection and vomiting (28.0% 
each), pneumonia and somnolence (20.0% each), sinusitis, otitis media, diarrhoea, cough and pyrexia 
(16.0% each), and bronchitis, constipation, nasal congestion, rash, irritability and decreased appetite 
(12.0% each). The frequency, type and severity of these adverse reactions were similar to that in 
children 4 years of age and older, adolescents and adults. Age characterisation in patients less 
than 4 years was not identified in the limited safety database due to small number of patients in the 
study.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
After an acute overdose, the stomach may be emptied by gastric lavage or by induction of emesis. 
There is no specific antidote for rufinamide. Treatment should be supportive and may include 
haemodialysis (see section 5.2).
Multiple dosing of 7,200 mg/day was associated with no major signs or symptoms.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, carboxamide derivatives; ATC code: N03AF03.
Mechanism of action
Rufinamide modulates the activity of sodium channels, prolonging their inactive state. Rufinamide is 
active in a range of animal models of epilepsy.
24
Clinical experience
Inovelon (rufinamide tablets) was administered in a double blind, placebo-controlled study, at doses of 
up to 45 mg/kg/day for 84 days, to 139 patients with inadequately controlled seizures associated with 
Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (including both atypical absence seizures and drop attacks). Male and 
female patients (between 4 and 30 years of age) were eligible if they had a history of multiple seizure 
types, which had to include atypical absence seizures and drop attacks (i.e., tonic–atonic or astatic 
seizures); were being treated with 1 to 3 concomitant fixed dose antiepileptic medicinal products; a 
minimum of 90 seizures in the month before the 28-day baseline period; an EEG within 6 months of 
study entry demonstrating a pattern of slow spike-and-wave complexes (2.5 Hz); a weight of at 
least 18 kg; and a CT scan or MRI study confirming the absence of a progressive lesion. All seizures 
were classified according to the International League Against Epilepsy Revised Classification of 
Seizures. As it is difficult for caregivers to precisely separate tonic and atonic seizures, the 
international expert panel of child neurologists agreed to group these seizure types and call them 
tonic–atonic seizures or “drop attacks”. As such, drop attacks were used as one of the primary end 
points. A significant improvement was observed for all three primary variables: the percentage change 
in total seizure frequency per 28 days during the maintenance phase relative to baseline (-35.8% on 
Inovelon vs. –1.6% on placebo, p=0.0006), the number of tonic-atonic seizures (-42.9% on Inovelon 
vs. 2.2% on placebo, p=0.0002), and the seizure severity rating from the Global Evaluation performed 
by the parent/guardian at the end of the double-blind phase (much or very much improved in 32.2% on 
Inovelon vs. 14.5% on the placebo arm, p=0.0041).
Additionally, Inovelon (rufinamide oral suspension) was administered in a multicentre, open-label 
study comparing the addition of rufinamide to the addition of any other AED of the investigator’s 
choice to the existing regimen of 1 to 3 AEDs in paediatric patients, 1 to less than 4 years of age with 
inadequately controlled LGS. In this study, 25 patients were exposed to rufinamide as adjunctive 
therapy for 24 weeks at a dose of up to 45 mg/kg/day, in 2 divided doses. A total of 12 patients 
received any-other AED at the investigator’s discretion in the control arm. The study was mainly 
designed for safety and not adequately powered to show a difference with regards to the seizure 
efficacy variables. The adverse event profile was similar to that in children 4 years of age and older, 
adolescents, and adults. In addition, the study investigated the cognitive development, behaviour and 
language development of subjects treated with rufinamide compared to subjects receiving
any-other-AED. The Least Square mean change of the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) Total 
Problems score after 2 years of treatment were 53.75 for the any other AED group and 56.35 for the 
rufinamide group (LS mean difference [95% CI] +2.60 [-10.5,15.7]; p=0.6928), and the difference 
between treatments was -2.776 (95% CI: -13.3, 7.8, p=0.5939).
Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling demonstrated that the reduction of total and 
tonic-atonic seizure frequencies, the improvement of the global evaluation of seizure severity and the 
increase in probability of reduction of seizure frequency were dependent on rufinamide
concentrations.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Maximum plasma levels are reached approximately 6 hours after administration. Peak concentration 
(Cmax) and plasma AUC of rufinamide increase less than proportionally with doses in both fasted and 
fed healthy subjects and in patients, probably due to dose-limited absorption behaviour. After single 
doses, food increases the bioavailability (AUC) of rufinamide by approximately 34% and the peak
plasma concentration by 56%.
Inovelon oral suspension and Inovelon film-coated tablets have been demonstrated to be 
bioequivalent.
25
Distribution
In in -vitro studies, only a small fraction of rufinamide (34%) was bound to human serum proteins 
with albumin accounting for approximately 80% of this binding. This indicates minimal risk of 
drug-drug interactions by displacement from binding sites during concomitant administration of other 
substances. Rufinamide was evenly distributed between erythrocytes and plasma.
Biotransformation
Rufinamide is almost exclusively eliminated by metabolism. The main pathway of metabolism is 
hydrolysis of the carboxylamide group to the pharmacologically inactive acid derivative CGP 47292. 
Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is very minor. The formation of small amounts of glutathione 
conjugates cannot be completely excluded.
Rufinamide has demonstrated little or no significant capacity in -vitro to act as a competitive or 
mechanism-based inhibitor of the following human P450 enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5 or CYP4A9/11-2.
Elimination
The plasma elimination half-life is approximately 6-10 hours in healthy subjects and patients with 
epilepsy. When given twice daily at 12-hourly intervals, rufinamide accumulates to the extent 
predicted by its terminal half-life, indicating that the pharmacokinetics of rufinamide are 
time-independent (i.e. no autoinduction of metabolism).
In a radiotracer study in three healthy volunteers, the parent compound (rufinamide) was the main 
radioactive component in plasma, representing about 80% of the total radioactivity, and the metabolite 
CGP 47292 constituting only about 15%. Renal excretion was the predominant route of elimination 
for active substance related material, accounting for 84.7% of the dose.
Linearity/non-linearity
The bioavailability of rufinamide is dependent on dose. As dose increases, the bioavailability 
decreases.
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups
Sex
Population pharmacokinetic modelling has been used to evaluate the influence of sex on the 
pharmacokinetics of rufinamide. Such evaluations indicate that sex does not affect the 
pharmacokinetics of rufinamide to a clinically relevant extent.
Renal impairment
The pharmacokinetics of a single 400 mg dose of rufinamide were not altered in subjects with chronic 
and severe renal failure compared to healthy volunteers. However, plasma levels were reduced by 
approximately 30% when haemodialysis was applied after administration of rufinamide, suggesting 
that this may be a useful procedure in case of overdose (see sections 4.2 and 4.9).
Hepatic impairment
No studies have been performed in patients with hepatic impairment and therefore Inovelon should not 
be administered to patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).
26
Elderly
A pharmacokinetic study in older healthy volunteers did not show a significant difference in 
pharmacokinetic parameters compared with younger adults.
Children (1-12 years)
Children generally have lower clearance of rufinamide than adults, and this difference is related to 
body size with rufinamide clearance increasing with body weight.
A recent population PK analysis of rufinamide on data pooled from 139 subjects (115 LGS patients 
and 24 healthy subjects), including 83 paediatric LGS patients (10 patients 
aged 1 to < 2 years, 14 patients aged 2 to < 4 years, 14 patients aged 4 to < 8 years, 21 patients 
aged 8 to < 12 years and 24 patients aged 12 to < 18 years) indicated that when rufinamide is dosed on 
a mg/kg/day basis in LGS subjects aged 1 to < 4 years, comparable exposure to that in LGS patients 
aged ≥ 4 years, in which efficacy has been demostrated, is achieved.
Studies in new-born infants or infants and toddlers under 1 year of age have not been conducted.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Conventional safety pharmacology studies revealed no special hazards at clinically relevant doses.
Toxicities observed in dogs at levels similar to human exposure at the maximum recommended dose 
were liver changes, including bile thrombi, cholestasis and liver enzyme elevations thought to be 
related to increased bile secretion in this species. No evidence of an associated risk was identified in 
the rat and monkey repeat dose toxicity studies.
In reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, there were reductions in foetal growth and 
survival, and some stillbirths secondary to maternal toxicity. However, no effects on morphology and 
function, including learning or memory, were observed in the offspring. Rufinamide was not 
teratogenic in mice, rats or rabbits.
The toxicity profile of rufinamide in juvenile animals was similar to that in adult animals. Decreased 
body weight gain was observed in both juvenile and adult rats and dogs. Mild toxicity in the liver was 
observed in juvenile as well as in adult animals at exposure levels lower than or similar to those 
reached in patients. Reversibility of all findings was demonstrated after stopping treatment.
Rufinamide was not genotoxic and had no carcinogenic potential. An adverse effect not observed in 
clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with 
possible relevance to human use, was myelofibrosis of the bone marrow in the mouse carcinogenicity 
study. Benign bone neoplasms (osteomas) and hyperostosis seen in mice were considered a result of 
the activation of a mouse specific virus by fluoride ions released during the oxidative metabolism of 
rufinamide.
Regarding the immunotoxic potential, small thymus and thymic involution were observed in dogs in 
a 13-week study with significant response at the high dose in male. In the 13-week study, female bone 
marrow and lymphoid changes are reported at the high dose with a weak incidence. In rats, decreased 
cellularity of the bone marrow and thymic atrophy were observed only in the carcinogenicity study.
Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA):
Environmental risk assessment studies have shown that rufinamide is very persistent in the 
environment (see section 6.6).

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Inovelon is and what it is used for
Inovelon contains a medicine called rufinamide. It belongs to a group of medicines called 
antiepileptics, which are used to treat epilepsy (a condition where someone has seizures or fits).
Inovelon is used with other medicines to treat seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in 
adults, adolescents and children from 1 year of age. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is the name given to a 
group of severe epilepsies in which you may experience repeated seizures of various types.
Inovelon has been given to you by your doctor to reduce the number of your seizures or fits.
2. What you need to know before you take Inovelon
Do not take Inovelon:
-
if you are allergic to rufinamide or triazole derivatives or any of the other ingredients of 
Inovelon (listed in section 6).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if:
-
-
-
you have Congenital Short QT Syndrome or a family history of such a syndrome (electrical
disturbance of the heart), as taking rufinamide could make it worse.
you suffer from liver problems. There is limited information on the use of rufinamide in this 
group, so the dose of your medicine may need to be increased more slowly. If your liver disease 
is severe the doctor may decide Inovelon is not recommended for you.
you get a skin rash or fever. These could be signs of an allergic reaction. See the doctor 
immediately as very occasionally this may become serious.
47
-
-
-
you suffer an increase in the number or severity or duration of your seizures, you should contact 
the doctor immediately if this happens.
you experience difficulty walking, abnormal movement, dizziness or sleepiness inform the 
doctor, if any of these happen.
if you take this medicine and have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact 
your doctor or go to a hospital straight away (see section 4).
Consult the doctor, even if these events occurred at any time in the past.
Children
Inovelon should not be given to children younger than 1 year of age since there is not enough 
information on its use in this age group.
Other medicines and Inovelon
Tell the doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. If you are taking the following medicines: phenobarbital, 
fosphenytoin, phenytoin or primidone, you may need to be carefully monitored for two weeks at the 
start of, or after the end of treatment with rufinamide, or after any marked change in the dose. A 
change in the dose of the other medicines may be needed as they may become slightly less effective 
when given with rufinamide.
Antiepileptic medicines and Inovelon
If the doctor prescribes or recommends an additional treatment for epilepsy (e.g., valproate) you must 
tell the doctor you are taking Inovelon as the dose may need adjusting.
Adults and children taking valproate at the same time as rufinamide will result in high levels of
rufinamide in the blood. Tell your doctor if you are taking valproate as the dose of Inovelon may need 
to be reduced by your doctor.
Tell the doctor if you are taking hormonal/oral contraceptives, e.g., “The pill”. Inovelon may make the 
pill not effective at preventing pregnancy. Therefore, it is recommended that you use an additional 
safe and effective contraceptive method (such as a barrier method, e.g., condoms) when taking 
Inovelon.
Tell the doctor if you are taking the blood thinner – warfarin. The doctor may need to adjust the dose.
Tell the doctor if you are taking digoxin (a medicine used to treat heart conditions). The doctor may 
need to adjust the dose.
Inovelon with food and drink
See section 3 – ‘How to use Inovelon’ for advice on taking Inovelon with food and drink.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant, or think you might be pregnant, or are planning to get pregnant, ask the doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking Inovelon. You must only take Inovelon during your pregnancy if 
the doctor tells you to.
You are advised not to breast-feed while taking Inovelon, as it is not known if rufinamide will be 
present in breast milk.
If you are a woman of childbearing age, you must use contraceptive measures while taking Inovelon.
48
Ask the doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine at the same time as Inovelon.
Driving and using machines
Inovelon may make you feel dizzy, drowsy and affect your vision, particularly at the beginning of 
treatment or after a dose increase. If this happens to you, do not drive or operate machinery.
Inovelon contains lactose
If you have been told by the doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact the doctor 
before taking this medicinal product.
Inovelon contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per daily dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
3.
How to use Inovelon
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with the doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure.
It may take a while to find the best dose of Inovelon for you. The dose will be calculated for you by 
the doctor and will depend on your age, weight and whether you are taking Inovelon with another 
medicine called valproate.
Children aged between 1 and 4 years of age
The recommended starting dose is 10 mg for each kilogram of body weight, each day. Taken in two 
equal doses, half in the morning and the other half in the evening. The dose will be calculated for you 
by the doctor and may be increased by 10 mg for each kilogram of body weight, every third day.
The maximum daily dose will depend on whether or not you are also taking valproate. Maximum daily 
dose not taking valproate is 45 mg for each kilogram of body weight, each day. Maximum daily dose 
taking valproate is 30 mg for each kilogram of body weight, each day.
Children 4 years of age or older weighing less than 30 kg
The recommended starting dose is 200 mg a day. Taken in two equal doses, half in the morning and 
the other half in the evening. The dose will be calculated for you by the doctor and may be increased 
by 200 mg every third day.
The maximum daily dose will depend on whether or not you are also taking valproate. Maximum daily 
dose not taking valproate is 1,000 mg each day. Maximum daily dose taking valproate is 600 mg each
day.
Adults, adolescents and children weighing 30 kg or over
The recommended starting dose is 400 mg a day. Taken in two equal doses, half in the morning and 
the other half in the evening. The dose will be calculated for you by the doctor and may be increased 
by 400 mg every other day.
The maximum daily dose will depend on whether or not you are also taking valproate. Maximum daily
dose not taking valproate is no more than 3,200 mg, depending on body weight. Maximum daily dose 
taking valproate is no more than 2,200 mg, depending on body weight.
49
Some patients may respond to lower doses and your doctor may adjust the dose depending on how you 
respond to the treatment.
If you experience side effects, your doctor may increase the dose more slowly.
Inovelon tablets must be taken twice daily with water, in the morning and in the evening. Inovelon 
should be taken with food. If you have difficulty swallowing, you can crush the tablet, then mix the
powder in about half a glass (100 ml) of water and drink immediately. You can also break the tablets
into two equal halves and swallow with water.
Do not reduce the dose or stop this medicine unless the doctor tells you to.
If you take more Inovelon than you should
If you may have taken more Inovelon than you should, tell the doctor or pharmacist immediately, or 
contact your nearest hospital casualty department, taking the medicine with you.
If you forget to take Inovelon
If you forget to take a dose, continue taking the medicine as normal. Do not take a double dose to 
make up for forgotten dose. If you miss taking more than one dose, seek advice from the doctor.
If you stop taking Inovelon
If the doctor advises stopping treatment, follow their instructions concerning the gradual reduction of 
Inovelon in order to lower the risk of an increase in seizures.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask the doctor or pharmacist.
4.
Possible side effects

The following side effects can be very serious:
Rash and/or fever. These could be signs of an allergic reaction. If they happen to you tell your 
doctor or go to a hospital immediately:
Change in the types of seizures you experience/more frequent seizures which last a long time
(called status epilepticus). Tell your doctor immediately.
A small number of people being treated with antiepileptics such as Inovelon have had thoughts

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Inovelon is and what it is used for
Inovelon contains a medicine called rufinamide. It belongs to a group of medicines called 
antiepileptics, which are used to treat epilepsy (a condition where someone has seizures or fits).
Inovelon is used with other medicines to treat seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in 
adults, adolescents and children from 1 year of age. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is the name given to a 
group of severe epilepsies in which you may experience repeated seizures of various types.
Inovelon has been given to you by your doctor to reduce the number of your seizures or fits.
2. What you need to know before you take Inovelon
Do not take Inovelon:
-
if you are allergic to rufinamide or triazole derivatives or any of the other ingredients of Inovelon 
(listed in section 6).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if:
-
-
-
-
-
you have Congenital Short QT Syndrome or a family history of such a syndrome (electrical 
disturbance of the heart), as taking rufinamide could make it worse.
you suffer from liver problems. There is limited information on the use of rufinamide in this 
group, so the dose of your medicine may need to be increased more slowly. If your liver disease
is severe the doctor may decide Inovelon is not recommended for you.
you get a skin rash or fever. These could be signs of an allergic reaction. See the doctor 
immediately as very occasionally this may become serious.
you suffer an increase in the number or severity or duration of your seizures, you should contact 
the doctor immediately if this happens.
you experience difficulty walking, abnormal movement, dizziness or sleepiness inform the 
doctor, if any of these happen.
54
-
if you take this medicine and have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact 
your doctor or go to a hospital straight away (see section 4).
Consult the doctor, even if these events occurred at any time in the past.
Children
Inovelon should not be given to children younger than 1 year of age since there is not enough 
information on its use in this age group.
Other medicines and Inovelon
Tell the doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. If you are taking the following medicines: phenobarbital, 
fosphenytoin, phenytoin or primidone, you may need to be carefully monitored for two weeks at the 
start of, or after the end of treatment with rufinamide, or after any marked change in the dose. A 
change in the dose of the other medicines may be needed as they may become slightly less effective 
when given with rufinamide.
Antiepileptic medicines and Inovelon
If the doctor prescribes or recommends an additional treatment for epilepsy (e.g., valproate) you must 
tell the doctor you are taking Inovelon as the dose may need adjusting.
Adults and children taking valproate at the same time as rufinamide will result in high levels of 
rufinamide in the blood. Tell your doctor if you are taking valproate as the dose of Inovelon may need 
to be reduced by your doctor.
Tell the doctor if you are taking hormonal/oral contraceptives, e.g., “The pill”. Inovelon may make the 
pill not effective at preventing pregnancy. Therefore, it is recommended that you use an additional 
safe and effective contraceptive method (such as a barrier method, e.g., condoms) when taking
Inovelon.
Tell the doctor if you are taking the blood thinner – warfarin. The doctor may need to adjust the dose.
Tell the doctor if you are taking digoxin (a medicine used to treat heart conditions). The doctor may 
need to adjust the dose.
Inovelon with food and drink
See section 3 – ‘How to use Inovelon’ for advice on taking Inovelon with food and drink.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant, or think you might be pregnant, or are planning to get pregnant, ask the doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking Inovelon. You must only take Inovelon during your pregnancy if 
the doctor tells you to.
You are advised not to breast-feed while taking Inovelon, as it is not known if rufinamide will be 
present in breast milk.
If you are a woman of childbearing age, you must use contraceptive measures while taking Inovelon.
Ask the doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine at the same time as Inovelon.
55
Driving and using machines
Inovelon may make you feel dizzy, drowsy and affect your vision, particularly at the beginning of 
treatment or after a dose increase. If this happens to you, do not drive or operate machinery.
Inovelon contains sorbitol (E420)
Inovelon contains 175 mg sorbitol (E420) in each mL. Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If your doctor
has told you that you (or your child) have an intolerance to some sugars or if you have been diagnosed 
with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder in which a person cannot break 
down fructose, talk to your doctor before you (or your child) take or receive this medicine.
Sorbitol may cause gastrointestinal discomfort and mild laxative effect.
Taking Inovelon with other anti-epileptic medicine which contains sorbitol, may affect how much they 
work. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other anti-epileptic medicine(s) with 
sorbitol.
Inovelon contains benzoic acid (E210)
Inovelon contains less than 0.01 mg benzoic acid (E210) in each mL. Benzoic acid may increase 
jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) in newborn babies up to 4 weeks old.
Inovelon contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per daily dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
Inovelon contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218) and propyl parahydroxybenzoate
These ingredients may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed).

How to use Inovelon
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with the doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure.
It may take a while to find the best dose of Inovelon for you. The dose will be calculated for you by

and the other half in the evening. The dose will be calculated for you by the doctor and may be 
increased by 200 mg (5 ml) every third day.
The maximum daily dose will depend on whether or not you are also taking valproate. Maximum daily 
dose not taking valproate is 1,000 mg (25 ml) each day. Maximum daily dose taking valproate 
is 600 mg (15 ml) each day.
Adults, adolescents and children weighing 30 kg or over
The recommended starting dose is 400 mg (10 ml) a day. Taken in two equal doses, half in the 
morning and the other half in the evening. The dose will be calculated for you by the doctor and may 
be increased by 400 mg (10 ml) every other day.

dose not taking valproate is no more than 3,200 mg (80 ml), depending on body weight.
Maximum daily dose taking valproate is no more than 2,200 mg (55 ml), depending on body weight.
Some patients may respond to lower doses and your doctor may adjust the dose depending on how you

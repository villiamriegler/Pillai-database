1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.   Introduction 
Epilepsies are among the most common neurologic disorders affecting individuals of all ages. Seizures 
and epilepsy affect children more than any other age group (Moshé SL, 2000) and are approximately 
twice as common in children as in adults (about 700 per 100,000 in children < 16 years compared with 
330 per 100,000 in adults). Partial epilepsies (focal or localization related) are frequent, accounting for 
> 60% of all epilepsies (Rauchenzauner M and Luef G, 2010).   
Zonegran (zonisamide) is a sulphonamide with weak carbonic anhydrase activity, chemically unrelated 
to other anti-epileptic medication. The active ingredient is 1,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide.  
Although  the  precise  mechanism  of  action  is  unknown,  Zonegran  is  thought  to  exert  its  actions  by 
blockade  of  the  voltage-sensitive  sodium  and  calcium  channels,  thereby  disrupting  synchronized 
neuronal  firing,  reducing  the  spread  of  seizure  discharges,  and  disturbing  subsequent  epileptic 
activities.  Zonegran  also has  some  effects  on  the synthesis,  release,  and  degradation  of a  number  of 
different neurotransmitters, including glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, dopamine, serotonin, and 
acetylcholine,  which  may  lead  to  enhancement  of  synaptic  inhibition.  Zonisamide  is  a  benzisoxazole 
derivative unrelated to other AEDs.  
Zonisamide  is  currently  indicated  for  the  adjunctive  therapy  of  partial  seizures  with  or  without 
secondary  generalization  in  adult  patients.  This  application  seeks  to  extend  this  indication  to  include 
adjunctive  therapy  of  partial  seizures  with  or  without  secondary  generalization  in  children  and 
adolescents aged 6 years and above. Since July 2012 the indication monotherapy in the treatment of 
partial seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy has 
also been authorized.  
The  proposed  dosing  schedule  for  children  and  adolescents  is  to  initiate  treatment  at  1  mg/kg/day 
(once-daily). Further dose increases in increments of 1 mg/kg are to be made at weekly intervals for 
patients  receiving  concomitant  cytochrome  P450-inducing  agents,  or  at  fortnightly  intervals  for  those 
not  receiving  such  agents.  The  dose  may  be  increased  up  to  a  target  maintenance  dose  of  8 
mg/kg/day (once-daily) for patients weighing 20 to 55 kg or 500 mg day for patients > 55 kg. 
Currently  approved  adjunctive  treatments  for  partial  onset  seizures  in  paediatric  patients  in  the 
European Union (EU) include: gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate. 
Despite  the  availability  of  a  number  of  AEDs  that  are  approved  for  paediatric  use,  not  all  patients 
achieve  satisfactory  seizure  control,  hence  the  need  for  additional  AEDs  that  are  effective  and  well 
tolerated in paediatric patients with partial onset seizures. 
1.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
1.2.1.  Introduction 
The  non-clinical  pharmacologic,  pharmacokinetic,  and  toxicity  profile  of  zonisamide  has  been  well 
characterized. 
To  support  the  paediatric  indication  the  MAH  has  resubmitted  the  juvenile  toxicity  studies  in  rats 
previously  evaluated  as  part  of  a  follow-up  measure  FUM002  (Study  No.901092  and  Study  No. 
901093).

To  support  the  fertility  information  in  section  4.6  and  5.3  of  the  SmPC  the  MAH  also  submitted  two 
fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  studies  conducted  in  rats  submitted  with  the  original 
Marketing  Authorisation  Application  (Study  Nos.  RR  745-00843  and  RR  745-00993)  and  a  recently 
conducted juvenile rat study (Study No. 901093). 
1.2.2.  Juvenile Toxicity  
Dose-range finding juvenile animal toxicity study (3 weeks) – Study No.901092 
In a dose-range finding study, zonisamide was administered orally by gavage to 7-day old rat pups at 
doses  of  100,  200,  and  300  mg/kg  for  up  to  3  consecutive  weeks.  A  dose  of  300  mg/kg  resulted  in 
excessive  toxicity  (mortality  and  adverse  effects  on  clinical  condition  and  lower  body  weight  gain)  in 
juvenile rats. Therefore, treatment at this dose level was terminated on Day 8 or 9 postpartum (pp). A 
decrease  in  body  weight  was  also  evident  at  200  mg/kg.  Based  on  these  results,  200  mg/kg  was 
considered  to  be  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  for  a  subsequent  definitive  toxicity  study  in 
juvenile rats. 
Definitive juvenile animal toxicity study (10 weeks followed by a 4-week recovery period) – 
Study No. 901093 
In a definitive juvenile animal toxicity study, zonisamide (20, 60, and 200 mg/kg) was administered to 
a  total  of  324  male  and  324  female  Sprague-Dawley  (Crl:CD[SD])  rat  pups  by  oral  gavage  for  10 
weeks  (dosing  commencing  on  Day  7  pp,  followed  by  a  4-week  recovery  period).  A  control  group 
received  an  equivalent  volume  of  vehicle  (0.5%  Tragacanth,  10  mL/kg).    Mortality  and  signs  of  ill 
health  or  reaction  to  treatment,  detailed  examination,  body  weight,  food  consumption,  growth 
measurements,  physical  (sexual)  development  assessment,  behavioural  performance  assessments 
(qualitative  and  quantitative  observational  assessments  in  a  functional  observation  battery,  grip 
strength  and  hind  limb  splay)  motor  activity,  auditory  startle  habituation,  learning  and  memory 
(Cincinnati  water  maze),  body  temperature,  ophthalmology,  reproductive  function,  laboratory 
investigations 
(haematology, 
clinical  biochemistry,  urinalysis), 
toxicokinetics,  gross  and 
histopathological  examinations  including  neuropathology,  organ  weights,  and  brain  and  bone 
measurements were recorded and evaluated for the pups during the study. 
There  was  no  treatment-related  mortality  and  no  effects  upon  clinical  signs,  with  the  exception  of 
salivation  observed  during  the  post-weaning  treatment  period  on  occasion  at  60  mg/kg  and  for  the 
majority of animals at 200 mg/kg. Decreases in body weight and food intake were observed at doses ≥
60 mg/kg. In addition, a transient effect on crown-rump length and a delay in male physical (preputial 
separation) development was observed at 200 mg/kg, which was likely related to the decreased body 
weight.    Effects  on  some  behavioural  endpoints  (functional  observation  battery,  grip  strength,  hind 
limb  splay  activity,  auditory  startle  habituation,  learning  and  memory)  observed  at  200  mg/kg  were 
considered related to the exaggerated pharmacologic effects of zonisamide and were in most instances 
reversible.  Changes  in  clinical  pathology  parameters  and  histopathologic  changes  in  the  liver  and/or 
kidneys were noted at ≥ 60 mg/kg, and were considered to be  related to adaptive change by hepatic 
enzyme  induction  and/or  carbonic  anhydrase  inhibition  by  zonisamide.  Increase  incidence  of  cortical 
vacuolation in the adrenal glands was noted in males at 200 mg/kg and prolonged diestrous and lower 
mating and fertility indices were observed in females. 
At  the  end  of  treatment,  increased  white  blood  cell  count  associated  with  increases  in  neutrophil  and 
lymphocyte  counts  were  noted  in  males  and  females  at  200  mg/kg.  Slight  increases  in  alanine 
aminotransferase  (ALT)  and  blood  urea  nitrogen  were  observed  at  ≥  60  mg/kg.  Increases  in  urine 
volume, pH, and excretion of sodium and chloride, and decreased excretion of potassium, were noted 
at  200  mg/kg.  At  the  end  of  the  recovery  period,  changes  in  the  haematology,  blood  chemistry  and 
Zonegran

urinalysis  parameters  were  no  longer  apparent.  The  effects,  where  assessed,  typically  showed 
reversibility over a 4-week period, except for histopathological changes in kidneys at 200 mg/kg, which 
only showed partial reversibility, and some behavioural changes at 200 mg/kg when assessed after 1 
to  2  weeks  of  recovery.  Based  on  the  results,  the  no  observed  adverse  effect  level  (NOAEL)  for 
zonisamide in this study was 20 mg/kg.  
At  the  end  of  the  treatment  period,  the  maximum  drug  concentration  (Cmax)  at  20  mg/kg  was  15.5 
and 17.5 μg/mL in males and females, respectively, and the area under the concentration × time curve 
(AUC(0−24h))  was  205  μg·h/mL  in  both  sexes.  The  mean  Cmax  and  AUC(0−24h)  values  were  16.5 
μg/mL, and 205 μg·h/mL, respectively.  When compared with the human PK data in 12 to 15 year-old 
paediatric  subjects  (Study  AN46046-225),  the  exposure  at  the  NOAEL  was  0.51  (Cmax)  and  0.29 
(AUC) times than the human exposure. 
1.2.3.  Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity  
In  the  reproductive  and  development  toxicity  program  conducted  and  assessed  with  the  initial  MAA, 
two  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  studies  were  conducted  in  rats;  the  first  study  was  a 
dietary study up to 100 mg/kg, and the second study was an oral gavage study conducted at doses up 
to 200 mg/kg. 
In the first fertility study (Study No. RR 745-00843), zonisamide was administered to sexually mature 
male and female rats as a dietary admixture at daily doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg. Treatment began 
in the males at least 60 days prior to mating and continued until sacrifice (on Week 15). For females, 
treatment began 14 days prior to mating and continued until sacrifice. F0 females were mated with a 
male  from  the  same  group.  Up  to  100  mg/kg  of  zonisamide  by  dietary  administration  showed  no 
adverse  effects  on  reproductive  or  litter  parameters.  Pregnancy  rate,  parturition,  and  maternal 
behaviour were not adversely affected by treatment with zonisamide. 
In  the  second  fertility  study  (Study  No.  RR  745-00993),  zonisamide  was  administered  daily  to  male 
and  female  rats  by  oral  gavage  at  dose  levels  of  20,  60,  and  200  mg/kg.  Males  were  treated  for  63 
days prior to mating with treatment continuing throughout cohabitation and until necropsy for a total 
of 100 or 101 days. Treatment of females began 14 days prior to mating and continued up to gestation 
Day 7. At the end of the respective pre-mating treatment periods, females and males were cohabitated 
in a 1:1 ratio within treatment groups for a maximum of 14 days. Major parental toxicity observed was 
dose-related  decrease  in  body  weight  with  decreased  food  consumption  at  60  mg/kg  and  higher.  A 
decrease in the number of live foetuses at 200 mg/kg and decreases in corpora lutea and implantation 
sites  at  ≥  60  mg/kg  were  observed,  and  irregular  estrus  cycles  were  also  noted  in  females  at  200 
mg/kg. No drug-related effects on fertility and early embryonic development were found at any dose. 
In  a  recently  conducted  pivotal  juvenile  rat  study  (Study  No.  901093),  effects  on  reproductive 
performance  were  examined  and  there  was  a  slightly  higher  incidence  of  females  in  prolonged 
diestrous at 200 mg/kg as compared with the control. The mating and fertility indices were also lower 
at  200  mg/kg,  although  the  conception  rate  (number  pregnant/number  mated)  was  not  affected.  At 
200 mg/kg the mean day to mating was also longer than that seen in control animals. 
It is difficult to compare the results of these studies and conclude the effect of zonisamide on fertility 
and  early  embryonic  development  precisely,  since  the  first  and  second  fertility  studies  were  very  old 
and  conducted  in  different  periods,  using  different  study  designs  and  regimens  and  in  different 
facilities. But taking a conservative approach, NOAEL for fertility in rats is considered to be 20 mg/kg 
based  on  the  second  study.  When  the  exposure  at  20  mg/kg  in  the  fertility  and  early  embryonic 
development  study  (Study  No.  RR  745-00993),  which  was  extrapolated  from  a  juvenile  rat  study 
[Study No. 901093], is compared with that at a dose of 8 mg/kg in adolescent subjects in the clinical 
Zonegran

Page 5/64
 
 
 
 
 
study  (Study  AN46046-225),  the  margin  of  safety  is  below  one-fold  for  AUC  or  Cmax.  A  margin  of 
safety  at  60  mg/kg,  although  a  dose  at  which  decreases  in  corpora  lutea  and  implantation  sites  in 
female rats were observed, is one-fold for AUC, or two-fold for Cmax. 
The  CHMP  noted  that  when  Zonegran  was  tested  in  rats  at  systemic  exposure  similar  to  therapeutic 
exposure, reductions in corpora lutea and implantation sites were observed. 
Irregular  estrus  cycles  were  also  noted  in  females  at  200  mg/kg.  Extrapolated  from  the  juvenile 
toxicity study, exposure at this dose was approximately 2-3 fold human therapeutic exposure. 
When adult rats were tested for fertility and early embryonic effects no adverse effects were observed. 
However, when juvenile rats were exposed, even if the mating and fertility indices were lower at 200 
mg/kg, the conception rate (number pregnant/number mated) was not affected. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An  updated  environmental  risk  assessment  was  submitted  with  variation  II/59  (extension  to  the 
indication to monotherapy use, concluded in May 2012), encompassing an update of the environmental 
exposure due to the already authorised indication and the environmental exposure due to the planned 
extensions to the indication to include adjunctive use in paediatric patients (aged 6 years and above) 
and monotherapy in newly diagnosed adult patients. 
The MAH provided a revised ERA including a Phase I with calculation of a PECsurfacewater and additional 
studies  for  a  Phase  II  assessment,  and  the  ERA  concluded  that  the  increase  in  the  overall 
environmental  exposure  was  not  thought  to  impact  on  the  environmental  risk.  However,  a  final 
conclusion  on  the  environmental  risk  cannot  be  drawn  due  to  the  absence  of  a  valid  algae  growth 
inhibition test and a sediment organism toxicity test. The MAH was requested to provide a valid algae 
growth inhibition test and a study on sediment dwelling organisms. Further justification by the MAH as 
to why the provided algae growth inhibition test and sediment organism toxicity test can be considered 
valid  was  not  accepted  by  the  CHMP.  The  alga  test  previously  submitted  for  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/0577/II/59  is  not  valid  due  to  irregular  testing  within  the  first  24  hours.  Within  this  time 
there  was  no  illumination  resulting  in  a  missing  exponential  growth.  This  is  a  formal  aspect  of  the 
OECD 201 guideline which cannot be waived by the argumentation of the applicant. 
Additionally,  the  MAH´s  rationale  for  waiving  a  sediment  dwelling  organism  toxicity  study  cannot  be 
accepted.  The  data  used  to  substantiate  the  rationale  such  as  DT50  values  from  the  water/sediment 
system study, information on human metabolites, the potential for bioaccumulation, and NOEC values 
derived  from  testing  with  other  organisms  are  not  relevant  for  the  assessment  of  the  toxicity  for 
sediment organisms. The CHMP concluded that a sediment dwelling organism toxicity study is required 
if more than 10% of the active ingredient shifted to the sediment at the end of the study thus the MAH 
is asked to submit a sediment organism toxicity test. 
The  wording  of  section  6.6,  Special  precautions  for  disposal,  was  amended  to  “Any  unused  medicinal 
product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements”.  
1.2.4.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Overall,  the  findings  seen  in  the  juvenile  rat  studies  were  consistent  with  and  comparable  to  the 
findings observed in the previously conducted oral repeated-dose studies in adult rats. Thus the MAH 
concludes that no unexpected toxicity is expected in young animals compared to adult animals. 
The  CHMP  noted  that  at  the  NOAEL  of  20  mg/kg  the  systemic  exposure  in  animals  is  lower  than 
systemic exposure in humans.

At 60 mg/kg, exposure was similar to therapeutic exposure and (exaggerated) pharmacological effects 
occur,  consisting  of  decrease  of  body  weight  associated  with  decreased  food  consumption  and 
behavioural  effects,  consisting  of  decreased  incidence  of  rearing.  The  MAH  states  that  similar  effects 
have been observed in adult animals as well. However, a behavioural parameter such as rearing is not 
commonly  observed  in  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies.  Behavioural  effects  such  as  transient  mild 
sedation, reduced muscle tone and slight ataxia were seen in a 9-months rat study (RR745-00467) but 
at higher doses than in the juvenile study.   
At  the  same  dose  (60  mg/kg)  various  effects  in  the  kidney  were  seen.  A  dose  related  increase  in 
incidence and severity of tubular hyaline droplets in treated males was observed. Similar findings were 
noted  in  control  males  with  lower  incidence  and  were  associated  with  early  stages  of  tubular 
degeneration  and  /  or  presence  of  granular  casts  at  >  60  mg/kg.  Medullary  /  papillary  tubular 
mineralization,  calculus  /  basophilic  material  and  transitional  cell  hyperplasia  were  found  at  a  higher 
incidence at 60 and 200 mg/kg. Tubular hyaline droplet accumulation was considered due to male rat 
specific  metabolism  of  alpha2  globulin  and  was  considered  to  be  of  little  toxicological  relevance  to 
humans.  Mineralization,  calculi  formation  and  transitional  cell  hyperplasia  were  considered  possibly 
related to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by zonisamide. Of note, however, the exposure at the LOAEL 
in juvenile rats (60 mg/kg; 1 or 2-fold exposure in humans) is similar to the exposure at the NOAEL in 
adult  rats  (30-100  mg/kg;  1.4-fold  expected  exposure  in  humans,  according  to  the  EPAR  for 
Zonegran).  This  indicates  that  juvenile  rats  are  more  susceptible  to  the  renal  effects  caused  by 
zonisamide.  
At  higher  dosages  (200  mg/kg)  growth  inhibitory  effects  were  more  evident  (decreased  crown-rump 
length,  delay  of  preputial separation)  and  CNS  effects  were  evident  (decreased  performance  in  water 
maze,  increased  startle  response).  In  addition,  effects  on  urinary  system,  liver  and  reproductive 
performance  were  observed.  The  latter  effects  were  also  observed  in  the  adult  rats  in  previous 
repeated-dose toxicity and/or reproductive toxicity studies and were reversible. However, renal effects 
at this higher dose were only partially reversible. 
At the request of CHMP, the MAH presented a comparison of the adverse effects observed in juvenile 
and  adult  rats  on  the  basis  of  systemic  exposure. The  MAH  noted  that  juvenile  animals  are  generally 
more susceptible than adult animals in terms of dose and systemic exposure. The MAH also notes that 
in clinical studies body weight and renal effects were observed consistent with the observations in rats.  
The MAH also provided additional paediatric data (5-11 and 12-15 years) to allow safety margins to be 
considered  for  the  findings  seen  in  the  juvenile  rat  study.    The  systemic  exposure  at  the  no  adverse 
effect level (NOAEL) was lower than the human exposure at the maximum recommended dose in both 
adults (500 mg/day) and paediatric subjects (8 mg/kg/day).  The main findings seen (decreased body 
weights/food  consumption,  clinical  sign  and  behavioural  changes  (due  to  exaggerated  Zonisamide 
pharmacology)  and  effects  in  kidney  and  liver  were  reversible  in  both  adult  and  juvenile  rats  or 
partially reversible in the case of kidney findings in juvenile rats.   
Regarding the kidney findings, the effects in juvenile animals were only partially reversible. At the end 
of the recovery period, the incidence and severity of tubular hyaline droplets in the kidney of males at 
60  and  200  mg/kg  were  reduced  compared  to  the  observations  made  at  the  end  of  the  treatment 
period however, the incidence of minimal or slight mineralization of medullary/papillary tubules seen at 
200 mg/kg remained comparable or had increased. Presence of calculus and/or mineralized basophilic 
material  in  the  renal  pelvis  or  minimal  focal  hyperplasia  of  transitional  epithelium  was  seen  in  a  few 
animals at 200 mg/kg. The lower incidence of tubular hyaline droplets, calculus/basophilic material and 
transitional  cell  hyperplasia  indicates  partial  recovery  whereas  the  comparable  or  higher  incidence  of 
medullary/papillary tubular mineralization did not suggest reversibility at the 200 mg/kg dose level.

Effects on growth, physical development (shorter crown-to-rump length, delay in prepuital separation) 
and  on  learning  and  memory  had  a  2-3  fold  safety  margin  when  compared  with  exposure  levels  in 
paediatric  subjects  at  the  maximum  recommended  therapeutic  dose  (8  mg/kg/day).    No  growth  or 
development  effects  were  seen  in  the  clinical  studies  in  paediatric  studies;  however  the  subject 
numbers were small and therefore cannot be considered as conclusive. As a result adverse effects on 
growth and development in the paediatric population has been added as an important potential risk in 
the RMP. Decreases in body weight and effects on kidney were however observed in paediatric subjects 
but were again consistent with those seen in adults. 
The  juvenile  animal  toxicity  indicates  no  new  safety  concerns  for  Zonisamide  as  compared  to  adult 
animals. 
Overall,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  while  safety  margins  for  toxicity  findings  seen  in  juvenile  studies 
were low and non-existent at the NOAEL, the findings were generally comparable to adult rat data and 
were consistent with that seen clinically (e.g. decrease in body weight and effects on kidney).  Safety 
margins for clinical signs and behavioural changes were lower in juvenile animals compared to adults 
but  these  findings  were  considered  related  to  exaggerated  pharmacology  and  were  reversible  or  at 
least  partially  for  kidney  findings.    The  adverse  effects  on  growth  and  development  in  the  paediatric 
population are being addressed as an important potential risk in the RMP.  A drug utilisation study is 
planned to monitor effects on kidney, most notably kidney stones. 
A  final  conclusion  on  the  environmental  risk  posed  by  Zonisamide  cannot  be  drawn  due  to  missing 
information on the potential effects on sediment dwelling organisms and algae growth. The Applicant is 
recommended to submit a valid algae growth inhibition test and a sediment organism toxicity test.

Population PK analysis 
The objectives of the population PK analysis were to: 
  Describe the PK of zonisamide in subjects with epilepsy aged 5 to 77 years (Studies AN46046-
225, AN46046-302 and E2090-E044-312). 
 
Identify covariates that explain between subject variability in zonisamide PK, including 
demographics, laboratory results and concomitant medication with other anti-epileptic drugs 
(AEDs). 
Results 
PK Data and Demographics 
The final data for population PK analysis consisted of 1524 observations from a total of 310 patients. 
There were 151 (49%) males and 159 (51%) females. Population age and weight ranged from 5 to 77 
years  (median  =  18  years)  and  15.7  kg  to  128  kg  (median  =  61  kg),  respectively.  A  total  of  113 
(36%)  children  between  the  ages  of  6  and  12  years  were  included.  The  AED  PK  populations  for  drug 
interaction  analyses  included:  140  (45%)  subjects  for  carbamazepine  (CBZ),  85  (27%)  subjects  for 
lamotrigine (LT), 34 (11%) subjects with phenytoin (PT), 22 (7%) subjects with phenobarbital (PB), 27 
(9%)  subjects  with  oxcarbazepine  (OXC),  33  (11%)  subjects  with  topiramate  (TOP),  88  (28%) 
subjects  with  valproic  acid  (VPA),  and  6  (2%)  subjects  with  primidone  (PRI).  In  total  212  (68%) 
subjects were on known cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) inducers (PT, PB, CBZ, OXC, TOP and/or PRI). 
Evaluation of Weight and Time Effect on Zonisamide Exposure 
Zonisamide CL/F decreased with time and increased with increasing body weight (Fig 2.4.2.1).

The  increase  of  CL/F  with  body  weight  results  in  lower  exposure  at  higher  body  weight,  if  given  at  a 
fixed dose. Simulations (n=500) were performed to predict Zonisamide steady-state exposure given at 
a  fixed  daily  dose  of  500  mg  per  day,  or  per  body  weight  at  8  mg/kg/day.  Dosing  per  body  weight 
resulted in comparable exposure across a range of body weights. Therefore the Zonisamide PK model 
indicated that in children, dosing based on per unit body weight will result in comparable Zonisamide 
exposure to that in adults. 
Fig.  2.4.2.2.  Predicted  Zonisamide  Steady-State  Concentration  (N  =  500  Simulations)  for 
Subjects Given a Fixed Daily Dose of 500 mg/day and 8mg/kg/day for 8 Weeks. 
Figure 2.4.2.2 is based on the simulation performed using the final PK model for Zonisamide. Weight 
was the only significant covariate in the model. After taking into account body weight differences, age 
had  no  further  effect  on  Zonisamide  PK.  Thus  during  simulations,  age  of  the  subjects  was  not 
considered. The Population PK model was developed based on data from Study 312 in which subjects 
received nominal doses of 8 mg/kg and for which the age range was 6 through 17 years. In Study 302, 
the 500 mg cohort had an age range of 12 through 77 years. 
The  similarity  in  average  exposure  between  children  and  adults  can  be  observed,  when  the  actual 
doses  are  corrected  for  body  weight.  Summary  model-predicted  Cav  (μg/mL)  estimates  for 
approximate  doses  of  4  to  5  and  8  to  9  mg/kg/day  are  presented  in  Table  2.4.2.1.  In  general,  the 
range of exposures between children aged 6 to 12 years and those subjects between 13 and 77 years 
for the same dose level were similar.

Table  2.4.2.1  Summary  Predicted  Zonisamide  Exposure  in  Subjects  aged  6-12  and  13-77 
years following Body Weight-Corrected Doses of 4-5 and 8-9 mg/kg/day. 
The MAH was requested to provide summary predicted exposure data in subjects aged 13 to 18 and 19 
to  77  years  rather  than  13  to  77  years  and  estimations  of  exposure  (Cminss,  Cmaxss  and  AUC)  in 
more  age  groups  instead  of  the  current  two  (6-12  and  13-18)  as  these  are  found  to  be  too  wide  for 
confirming similar exposure in all paediatric groups as compared to adults. Simulations were requested 
to  be  done  in  different  weight  groups  and  dosages.  Further,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  an 
overview of the numbers of patients in different age and weight groups included in the PK/PD model, 
and the administered dosages. 
The MAH stated that Study 312 and 302 had sparse sampling so it was not possible to derive exposure 
parameters  of  C  min,  Cmax  and  AUC.  The  paediatric  PK  study  (Study  225)  showed  that  at  steady 
state, the PK profile of zonisamide during a 12-hour dosing interval was almost flat due to a long half-
life.  Therefore,  at  steady  state,  the  PK  sample  at  any  time  during  the  dosing  interval  gives  a 
reasonably good estimate of the C av concentration. 
The  MAH  presented  box  plots  showing  observed  steady  state  zonisamide  plasma  concentrations  in 
those participating in Study 312 by age-group (8mg/kg) along with box plots for adults at the 300mg 
and 500mg doses. Average zonisamide concentrations in the paediatric age-groups overlap with those 
of  the  300mg  and  500mg  doses  in  adults,  though  they  appear  to  be  closer  to  those  for  the  500mg 
dose. A box plot of concentration versus body weight shows a similar picture with overlap in average 
concentration between paediatric 8mg/kg doses and adult 300mg and 500mg doses. 
A somewhat similar picture is seen for a box plot of the 6mg/kg paediatric dose in different age-groups 
compared to the 300mg and 500mg adult dose with the 6mg/kg dose resulting in an exposure in the 
Zonegran  
EMA/532724/2013  
Page 11/64
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
range  between  the  adult  doses.  There  is  also  overlap  in  exposure  of  the  6mg  and  8mg/kg  paediatric 
doses. 
Overall, the overlap in exposure between the 6mg/kg and 8mg/kg raised the question as to whether a 
dose of 6mg/kg might be equally efficacious or minimally less efficacious as the 8mg/kg dose with the 
additional benefit of a possible lower frequency of adverse events. 
The  MAH  was  also  asked  to  provide  further  evidence  on  zonisamide  exhibiting  time-dependent 
pharmacokinetics  and  on  the  population  PK-PD  models  used  to  draw  conclusions  about  similarity  in 
exposure-response between different age groups. 
In relation to co-administration of AEDs (PT, PB, CBZ, OXC, TOP, PRI, VPA, LT), they did not affect the 
pharmacokinetics  of  Zonisamide,  hence  there  is  no  need  for  dose  adjustment  with  any  of  the  AEDs 
including CYP3A4 inducers (PT, PB, CBZ, OXC, TOP and/or PRI). 
1.3.3.  Conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP noted that the highest dose in the adults study was 500mg/day which would amount, in an 
average weighing adult of 70kg, to 7mg/kg/day, while 300mg/day would amount to 4mg/kg/day. The 
MAH  stated  that  the  available  data  from  previous  paediatric  studies  indicated  that  zonisamide 
exposures in children aged 6 years and above and adolescents were similar to those observed in adults 
when  adjusted  for  body  weight.  These  studies  were  used  to  provide  data  for  the  population 
pharmacokinetic  modelling  and  PK/PD  modelling.  The  MAH  predicted  that  a  dose  of  8mg/kg/day  in 
children and adolescents will produce levels of exposure similar to those in adults produced by a dose 
of  300  to  500mg  zonisamide.  Given  that  the  efficacy  of  zonisamide  is  well  established  in  the  adult 
adjunctive  use  population  at  a  dose  of  300mg  to  500mg,  it  was  anticipated  that  a  dose  of  8mg/kg 
should be efficacious in the paediatric population  
At the request of CHMP the MAH provided an overview of the numbers of patients in different age and 
weight groups included in the PK/PD model, and the administered dosages. 
Based  on  the  achieved  plasma  concentrations,  and  the  results  of  the  PK-pop  simulations,  the  dosage 
based  on  body  weight  was  agreed  with.  However,  the  CHMP  believed  that  based  on  the  average 
plasma  concentrations,  a  lower  dosage  than  8  mg/kg  could  also  result  in  comparable  exposure  to 
adults.  
The MAH provided an overview of responder rate per achieved maintenance dose in the pivotal trial, to 
explore whether a lower target dose than 8 mg/kg was effective.  
Zonegran  
EMA/532724/2013  
Page 12/64
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP noted that there appears to be a more robust response in those treated with a 7 to 9mg/kg 
dose compared to those treated with 4 -<7mg/kg dose. However the numbers treated with the lower 
dose  are  lower  and  it  is  possible  that  the  lower  response  in  this  group  could  have  occurred  through 
chance.  
The MAH acknowledged that the target dose of 8 mg/kg/day was originally proposed instead of a range 
in  order  to  fit  more  closely  the  design  of  the  study.  In  practice,  the  actual  dose  received  by  the 
majority  of  subjects  varied  between  6.3  and  9.5  mg/kg/day  depending  on  a  subject’s  position  within 
each weight grouping. Additionally, subjects who opted for the lower initial target dose of 7 mg/kg/day 
permitted in event of tolerability issues during the titration period would have received doses down to 
5.4 mg/kg/day (see Figure 2). Ten subjects fell outside the permitted range: 6 subjects received doses 
below 5.4 mg/kg/day and 4 subjects above 9.5 mg/kg/day.

Thus the posology section of the product information was amended to include a dosing range.  
The  posology  agreed  was  a  dose  range  of  6  to  8mg/kg  in  those  weighing  less  than  or  equal  to  55kg 
(once a day); the proposed dose range for a paediatric population weighing more than 55 kg is 300 - 
500 mg per day (once a day).   
1.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Study 312 is the pivotal study that substantiates the efficacy of ZNS as adjunctive therapy in paediatric 
subjects (6-7). This Phase 3 study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 
conducted at 41 sites in 11 countries.  
In addition, as supportive data, results are presented from: 
  Study 313, the double-blind extension of Study 312 designed to assess long-term efficacy and 
safety in paediatrics patients.  
  Study  302,  an  add-on  fixed  dose  study,  from  the  initial  submission  for  the  adult  indication 
which  included  adolescents  and  adults  aged  12  years  old  or  older.  Altogether  out  of  294 
patients included in the ITT analysis of this study, 32 were aged 12-17; 17 received one of 3 
doses  of  Zonegran  and  15  placebo.  Due  to  the  small  numbers,  no  conclusions  regarding 
adolescents could be drawn from the results of this study.

1.4.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose finding study reports were submitted.  
The study protocol of the pivotal study 312, provides the rationale for the choice of dose used, based 
on the results of study 302 with adults, which showed that efficacious doses for adults were within the 
dose range of 300 to 500 mg/day (the 100mg/day dose did not separate from placebo). 
The  dosing  rational  also  refers  to  three  previous  studies  conducted  in  paediatric  subjects  with 
zonisamide as add-on treatment (AN46046-225, 226 and 354).  
Based  on  the  limited  pediatric  PK  information  available  prior  to  Study  312  (primarily  Study  225  and 
Study  354),  the  data  indicated  that  the  Zonisamide  exposure  (including  variability)  seen  at  300 
through  500  mg  per  day  in  adults  was  likely  realized  in  children  when  dosing  at  a  target  of  8  mg/kg 
per  day.  Other  information  suggested  that  clearance  was  generally  increased  only  in  children  much 
below  the  lowest  age  range  in  Study  312.  A  literature  review  suggested  little  if  any  systematic  PK 
differences for Zonisamide between adults and children aged  6 years and above. The data suggested 
that  a  body-weight  correction  was  appropriate  and  hence  a  target  dose  of  8  mg/kg  (minimum  of  6 
mg/kg) was selected and used in Study 312. 
Studies 225 and 226 included subjects aged 5 to 15 and 5 to 18 respectively. These studies showed an 
acceptable safety profile with doses of 2-12mg/kg of zonisamide with a starting dose of 1mg/kg. The 
target maintenance dose in these trials was 12mg/kg or 600mg whichever was the lowest dose. Study

225 and 226 used a rapid titration schedule with weekly dose increases, where the maximum dose of 
12 mg/kg was reached in 8 weeks; the drop-out rate due to AEs was 30%. In Study 354, a much 
slower titration rate was used where a dose of 8 mg/kg was reached in week 8, and 12 mg/kg in week 
12. In this study a markedly lower drop-out rate (9%) was observed, suggesting that a slower titration 
was better tolerated. Therefore, dosing regimen in study 312 replicates the initial part of the titration 
Period used in Study 354, with the target dose of 8 mg/kg being reached at the end of Week 8.  
As  previously  highlighted,  the  dose  recommendations  in  the  SmPC  proposes  a  dose  range  of  6  to 
8mg/kg in those weighing less than or equal to 55kg (once a day).   
The proposed dose range for a paediatric population weighing more than 55 kg will be 300 - 500 mg 
per day (once a day).   
Dosing  titration  in  the  SmPC  are  the  same  as  in  the  study  for  patients  with  cytochrome  p450  3a4-
inducing  agents  but  are  twice  as  slow  for  patients  without  cytochrome  p450  3a4-inducing  agents  as 
already recommended in the SmPC for adults.

Study E2090-E044-312 
Methods 
The pivotal study (Study E2090-E044-312) was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-
centre study to assess the efficacy and safety of adjunctive Zonisamide in paediatric partial onset 
seizures. The study was conducted in India and Europe with the largest number of subjects coming 
from Ukraine (70) , Hungary (42), India (35), Latvia (21)and Poland (21). A total of 207 subjects were 
enrolled in the trial across 41 sites in 11 countries

Study participants 
Study  participants  were  aged  between  6  to  17  years  with  a  clinical  diagnosis  of  epilepsy  with  partial 
onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation according to the ILAE classification of epileptic 
seizures (1981). Diagnosis should have been established by clinical history, EEG, and CT/MRI imaging 
of  the  brain  consistent  with  localization-related  epilepsy.  Subjects  had  to  have  had  at  least  4  partial 
seizures per  month over the 8-week baseline period with at least one seizure in each 4-week period, 
and  with  no  21-day  period  being  seizure  free.  Subjects  should  have  been  taking  a  stable  regimen  of 
one or two other AEDs. 
Subjects  were  excluded  if  they  had  a  body  weight  <  20  kg  at  screening,  progressive  neurological 
disease,  a  history  of  generalised  epilepsy,  Lennox-Gastaut  syndrome,  absence,  myoclonic,  clonic 
and/or tonic (other than secondary generalised), and atonic seizures or a history of status epilepticus 
within  one  year  of  screening  whilst  taking  AEDs,  a  history  of  renal  calculi  or  renal  insufficiency,  a 
history of psychiatric illness or suicide attempt. 
The CHMP considered the inclusion and exclusion criteria acceptable. 
Subjects  were  randomised  to  either  a  zonisamide  or  a  placebo  treatment  arm.  Randomization  was 
stratified by site and weight group. Weight bands of 20 – <29 kg, 29 – <42 kg, 42 – <56 kg, and ≥56 
kg were used to stratify dosing.  
The  study  drug  (Zonegran  or  placebo)  was  taken  once  daily  in  the  evening.  The  dose  was  titrated 
upwards  from  1-mg/kg/day  starting  dose,  with  weekly  dose  increases  in  increments  of  1  mg/kg/day, 
until a maximum dose of 8 mg/kg/day was reached at the end of week 8. In the event of dose-limiting 
adverse  events  (AEs)  during  the  8-week  titration  period,  one  down-titration  to  a  lower  dose  was 
permitted;  this  could  happen  at  any  point  in  the  Titration  Period.  For  patients  who  undertook  this 
single  allowable  down-titration,  the  dose  during  the  maintenance  Period  was  less  than  8  mg/kg/day. 
For patients heavier than 55 kg the maximum dose was 500 mg, or 400 mg if the patient received the 
1  down-titration  allowed  during  the  Titration  Period.  During  the  titration  period,  patients  whose  dose 
had been down-titrated had their dose increased again as soon as tolerability improved. Patients who 
required  further  down-titration  steps  were  withdrawn  from  the  study.  No  changes  to  the  dose  were 
allowed during the maintenance period. 
Concomitant Anti-epileptic drug Therapy 
Subjects  had  to  be  taking  a  stable  regimen  of  1  or  2  other  Anti-epileptic  drugs  (AED)  for  at  least  2 
months before the start of the screening period. 
Prohibited medications 
Subjects  who  had  taken  any  antipsychotic  drug,  MAOIs,  TCAs,  benzodiazepine  with  barbiturate  for 
treatment  of  disorders  other  than  epilepsy,  and  stimulants  (amphetamine  derivatives)  had  to  have 
discontinued their use within 3 months prior to Screening.  
Acetazolamide, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (for example topiramate), any drugs with anticholinergic 
activity, feverfew, St John’s Wort, and felbamate were not permitted for use during the study. Subjects 
could  not  take  any  prescription  medications  during  their  participation  in  this  study  without  the  prior 
knowledge and consent of the investigator, unless required for emergency treatment. 
Study Plan 
Subjects underwent a 4 to 8 week Screening period followed by an 8 week titration period which was 
in turn followed by a 12 week Maintenance period (See Figure 3)

The  study  plan,  with  a  screening  titration  and  maintenance  period,  was  considered  acceptable  by 
CHMP. The maintenance period is in line with similar studies of AEDs in adjunctive use. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
To  assess  the  efficacy  of  zonisamide  (Zonisamide)  in  paediatric  epilepsy  with  partial  onset  seizures 
(POS) treated with one or two other AEDs. 
Secondary objectives: 
To further explore the efficacy and safety of Zonisamide. 
To explore the effects of Zonisamide on cognition, growth and development. 
Endpoints 
Primary endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of responders in the Zonisamide group compared to 
placebo  in  the  ITT  population.  A  responder  was  defined  as  a  subject  with  a  decrease  in  seizure 
frequency  of  at  least  50%  during  the  maintenance  period  compared  to  seizure  frequency  during  the 
baseline period (i.e. 28 day seizure frequency during weeks 8 to 20 compared to weeks -8 to 0). 
Seizure count was derived from daily diaries (maintained by the parent or guardian). Seizure frequency 
of simple partial, complex partial, and partial seizures with secondary generalization were counted.  
The  primary  analysis  was  over  the  period  of  fixed  dosing  (the  maintenance  period).  Sensitivity 
analyses  included  the  combined  titration  period  and  maintenance  period.  Baseline  was  the  seizure 
frequency  in  the  8  weeks  before  randomization.  The  primary  analysis  population  was  the  intent-to-
treat (ITT) population with LOCF during the maintenance period.  
Secondary endpoints 
  Median percentage change from baseline in the 28 day seizure frequency during the maintenance 
period only and during the combined maintenance and titration periods 
Zonegran

 
The proportion of subjects with a decrease from baseline in the 28-day seizure frequency of ≥ 
50% to < 75% and ≥ 75% during the maintenance period only and the combined maintenance 
and titration periods 
 
The proportion of subjects with an increase from baseline in 28 day seizure frequency of ≥ 25% 
and > 100% during the maintenance period and during the combined titration and maintenance 
period. 
There were a number of other efficacy variables including percentage change from baseline in 28 day 
seizure frequency by seizure type, proportions of subjects seizure free, the number of seizure free days 
and the relationship between plasma level of Zonisamide and seizure frequency. 
The CHMP noted that the primary and efficacy endpoints are acceptable and are in line with EMA 
guidance. 
Sample size 
A sample size of 91 subjects in each group was estimated to have an 80% power to detect a difference 
in  the  proportion  of  responders  of  20%  in  the  placebo  group  and  40%  for  the  treatment  group. 
Previous adjunctive studies were taken as a reference point for the proportions. A 10% drop out rate 
was expected meaning that each group required a sample of 102 subjects. 
A sample size for a separate sub-sample formed of those with an IQ ≥ 75 to be assessed for cognitive 
outcome  was  calculated.  A  sample  size  of  38  was  estimated  to  be  required  to  detect  a  difference  in 
means of power of attention of 130msec (SD=199msec). Given that there was expected to be a drop-
out  rate  of  10%  it  was  calculated  that  a  sub-sample  size  of  42  subjects  would  be  required  in  each 
group. 
Statistical methods 
The analysis population for the primary efficacy variable was the intention to treat (ITT), defined as all 
randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of double-blind study medication. 
Efficacy analyses were also carried out on the per protocol population defined as all subjects in the ITT 
population who had no major protocol violations. 
Analyses  were  performed  by  comparing  zonisamide  to  placebo. A  5%  significance  level  was  used.  No 
adjustments were made for multiplicity. No interim analyses were planned or conducted. 
The primary comparison of interest was the Zonisamide treatment group versus the placebo group in 
the ITT population on last observation carried forward (ITT-LOCF) data during the maintenance period. 
The secondary comparison of interest was the Zonisamide versus placebo group in the ITT population 
on observed case data (ITT-OC) during the maintenance period and during the combined titration and 
maintenance period. 
Data that was not normally distributed was log transformed or, if this was unsuccessful non-parametric 
methods were used. 
The  percentage  change  from  baseline  was  calculated  and  an  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  was 
performed  on  rank-transformed  data  to  test  for  the  effects  of  treatment  of  seizure  data.  The  median 
percentage  change  from  baseline,  a  non-parametric  Hodges-Lehmann  confidence  interval  and  a  p 
value were presented. 
For non-seizure data evidence of normality was provided if a parametric test was used. 
Zonegran  
EMA/532724/2013  
Page 19/64
 
 
 
 
 
For  the  primary  efficacy  variable  (responder  rate)  the  proportion  of  responders  in  each  group  was 
compared using the Pearson’s chi-square test. P values were presented for the association in treatment 
and  responder  rate.  The  responder  analysis  was  originally  planned  to  be  a  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
(CMH)  test  which  included  the  strata  for  site  and  weight  as  per  randomisation.  After  further 
investigation it was decided that site and weight should be removed from the analysis. Due to the lack 
of  covariates  for  the  primary  analysis  of  responders,  the  analysis  was  changed  to  a  Pearson’s  chi-
squared test. 
The primary endpoint (responder rate) was also analysed by sub-group e.g. subjects who took enzyme 
inducing  AEDs  v  subjects  who  took  non-enzyme  inducing  AEDs  and  subjects  who  took  1  AED  vs. 
subjects who took 2 AEDs. 
The percentage change in 28 day seizure frequency from baseline during the maintenance period and 
during  the  combined  titration  maintenance  period  was  analysed  using  rank  ANCOVA  with  baseline 
seizure frequency included as a covariate. Initially it was planned to conduct the analysis using ANOVA 
however ANCOVA was used because the assumptions of normality were not expected to be satisfied for 
seizure endpoints. 
A plot for percentage change in baseline seizure frequency per 28 day seizure frequency over the 20-
week treatment phase was produced. 
The  proportion  of  subjects  with  decrease  of  28  day  seizure  frequency  of  ≥  50%  to  <  75%  was 
summarised. The proportion of subjects with a 28 day seizure frequency decrease from baseline of at 
least  75%  was  during  the  maintenance  period  was  analysed  using  Pearson’s  chi-square  test  and 
similarly for 28-day seizure frequency reduction during the combined titration maintenance period. 
A similar approach was used to analyse increase in 28 day seizure frequency during the maintenance 
period and during the combined titration maintenance period. 
In  general,  the  CHMP  considered  the  statistical  methods  used  appropriate.  Analysis  of  the  primary 
efficacy variable in the ITT population on last observation carried forward is acceptable as it provides a 
more realistic assessment of efficacy given that those in whom the treatment is not efficacious or who 
experience TEAEs are likely to drop out and would not be included in an ITT OC population.  
Results 
Participant flow 
Patients’  disposition:  The investigators screened 242 patients for entry into the study. Of these, 35 
patients were screen failures and 207 patients were randomized into the study (107 to the Zonegran 
group  and  100  to  the  placebo  group).  The  reasons  for  failing  screening  are  summarized  in  Figure  2 
below.

Protocol amendments 
There  was  one  amendment  specific  to  France  and  four  other  amendments.  The  major  amendments 
included  a  change  in  the  screening  period  from  8  to  4  weeks  with  seizure  frequency  in  the  4  weeks 
prior to the screening period captured in a seizure diary used as part of standard clinical practice. Only 
subjects with a stable baseline phase and good quality of data were randomized. There were changes 
in the statistical analysis plan and a reduction in the sample size with a reduction in power from 90% 
to  80%.  In  addition  the  use  of  benzodiazepines  as  rescue  medication  was  permitted  once  a  week 
whereas previously it has only been allowed once a month. 
The  proportion  of  subjects  recruited  with  a  4  week  screening  period  is  small  (7.2%)  and  unlikely  to 
have had an impact on efficacy results and no subjects in this study required benzodiazepine rescue. 
Baseline data 
Both  treatment  groups  were  largely  similar  in  terms  of  demographic  characteristics.  In  terms  of 
baseline  characteristics  related  to  epilepsy  the  two  groups  were  similar  with  regard  to  median  time 
since diagnosis (54.7 months v 52.4 months for placebo and Zonegran respectively) and the number of 
concomitant AEDs taken. Median number of seizures in the baseline period was 10 for the placebo arm 
and  10.5  for  the  Zonegran  arm.  Baseline  mean  seizure  frequency  was  higher  in  the  placebo  group 
(43.8)  than  the  Zonegran  group  (32.9).  The  higher  mean  value  for  baseline  seizure  frequency  in  the 
placebo group reflects one outlier patient who had 882 seizures.  The proportion of subjects by seizure 
type was similar in both groups.  
Zonegran

In  the  Zonegran  treatment  group  a  lower  proportion  of  subjects  had  unknown  aetiology  compared  to 
the  placebo  group  (Zonegran  56.1%  v  placebo  65%)  and  a  slightly  higher  proportion  had  structural 
brain  abnormalities  (Zonegran  19.6%  v  placebo  13%).  This  was  more  marked  in  the  12  to  17  age-
group (59.6% (Zonegran) v 75.6% (PLB) for unknown aetiology and 21.2% v 6.7% for structural brain 
abnormalities.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of responders in 
the Zonisamide group compared to placebo in the ITT population. A 
responder was defined as a subject with a decrease in seizure 
frequency of at least 50% during the maintenance period compared 
to seizure frequency during the baseline period (i.e. 28 day seizure 
frequency during weeks 8 to 20 compared to weeks -8 to 0.) 
- Median percentage change from baseline in the 28 day seizure 
frequency during the maintenance period only and during the 
combined maintenance and titration periods 
- The proportion of subjects with a decrease from baseline in the 
28-day seizure frequency of ≥ 50% to < 75% and ≥ 75% during 
the maintenance period only and the combined maintenance and 
titration periods 
- The proportion of subjects with an increase from baseline in 28 
day seizure frequency of ≥ 25% and > 100% during the 
maintenance period and during the combined titration and 
maintenance period. 
There were a number of other efficacy variables including 
percentage change from baseline in 28 day seizure frequency by 
seizure type, proportions of subjects seizure free, the number of 
seizure free days and the relationship between plasma level  of 
Zonisamide and seizure frequency.

Primary efficacy variable 
The  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  ITT-LOCF  group  who  experienced  a  decrease  in  28  day  seizure 
frequency of 50% or more relative to baseline in the maintenance period was 50% in the Zonisamide 
group  and  31%  in  the  placebo  group.  This  result  was  statistically  significant.  Responder  rates  were 
similar in the ITT-OC population and in the PP-LOCF population. 
The responder rate in the combined titration and maintenance periods for the ITT-OC population was 
consistent with those for the ITT population in the maintenance period (44% in the Zonisamide group 
and 18% in the placebo group, P < 0.0001. 
Sub-group analysis  
In the maintenance period (LOCF) a higher percentage of Zonisamide subjects taking one AED had a 
response  compared  to  subjects  taking  two  AEDs  (64%  v  41%  respectively)  and  similarly  for  those 
taking placebo (38% v 25% respectively). 
In  the  maintenance  period,  subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  had  a  lower  response  if  they  were 
receiving  enzyme  inducing  AEDs  compared  to  subjects  receiving  non-enzyme  inducing  AEDs 
(Zonisamide 44% v 56%, placebo 24% v 36% LOCF). 
In  order  to  assess  consistency  of  results  across  seizure  types,  MAH  was  requested  to  provide 
responders rate by seizure type.  
A table of response rate by seizure type is presented in Table 8. The response rate for Zonisamide was 
similar  across  seizure  types.  The  treatment  difference  varied  across  seizure  types  with  the  largest 
treatment  difference  being  observed  in  patients  with  secondary  generalized  tonic  clonic  seizures.

However  it  should  be  noted  that  the  subgroups  are  not  large  enough  to  confirm  differences  between 
treatments by seizure type. 
CI = Confidence Interval, ITT = Intent to Treat, LOCF = last observation carried forward. 
Proportion of responders for each treatment = responders/N. 
A responder is defined as a subject with a decrease from baseline in 28-day seizure frequency of ≥50% in the 
Maintenance 
Period. 
Confidence Interval is calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. 
a: Subjects may have had more than one type of seizure. 
It  was  noted  that  a  very  small  difference  in  responder  rates  is  observed  between  the  treatment  and 
placebo arm in simple partial without signs, all simple partial and complex partial subgroups, where a 
high  percentage  of  responders  is  observed  in  the  placebo  group.  Differences  in  responder  rates  are 
observed also in the analysis of results according to aetiology.  
The MAH highlighted that placebo response rates tend to be higher in paediatric populations than adult 
populations with drug-resistant partial epilepsy making reference to a published meta-analysis.  
Although  study  312  was  not  powered  to  detect  efficacy  in  individual  seizure  types,  at  the  request  of 
CHMP the MAH also presented an analysis of the data by seizures type or aetiology.  
Overall it was agreed that the effect of Zonegran does not seem to be driven by one sub-group. 
Secondary efficacy analysis 
The median percentage change in seizure frequency between baseline and the maintenance period was 
assessed in the ITT-LOCF, ITT-OC, PP-LOCF maintenance periods and in the ITT-OC and PP-OC entire 
double blind period. Subjects in the Zonisamide group experienced a reduction of approximately 50% 
in seizure frequency from baseline in the maintenance period compared to  approximately 25% in the 
placebo arm in the ITT – LOCF population. The size of the reduction was similar in the ITT – OC and 
PP-LOCF  populations.  The  difference  between  the  medians  of  –25.2%  (95%  CI:  -38.7,  –12.2)  was 
statistically significant (P < 0.0001; rank ANCOVA).

Sub-group analysis 
Seizure type 
The results of the sub-group analysis, median seizure reduction by seizure type, is difficult to interpret 
given the small numbers in each category. 
Age 
The  percentage  of  responders  (decrease  of  ≥  50%  in  seizure  frequency  relative  to  baseline)  by  age 
group is presented in the table below. A higher percentage of responders in the Zonegran compared to 
placebo  treatment  group  were  observed  both  among  the  6  to  11  years  of  age  (47%  vs.  31%; 
difference=16%, 95% CI: -2 ; 33) and the 12 to 17 age group (54% vs. 31%; difference=23%, 95% 
CI: 3 ; 40).

Enzyme-inducing AEDs and Number of AEDs 
Subjects  taking  two  AEDs  in  combination  with  Zonisamide  appear  to  show  a  smaller  reduction  in 
seizure  frequency  compared  to  subjects  taking  one  AED  in  combination  with  Zonisamide  for  the 
maintenance period relative to baseline, (-60.5% v -38.8% in the Zonisamide group for one and two 
AEDs respectively, and for placebo (-33.3% v -12.4% respectively). 
The Percentage change in median frequency of seizures by seizure type is difficult to interpret as the 
numbers in each sub-type are low. 
The  CHMP  noted  that  although  a  lower  response  was  observed  in  patients  receiving  enzyme-inducing 
AEDs  compared  to  patients  receiving  non-enzyme-inducing  AEDs,  the  difference  between  Zonegran 
and placebo arms is similar in both subgroups of patients and hence there is no concern of less efficacy 
in patients receiving  enzyme-inducing AEDs.  
As  the  current  SPC  of  Zonegran  indicates,  the  only  difference  between  patients  receiving  enzyme 
inducers or non-inducers AEDs is in the titration schedule, while the final dose is the same.  
The effect in the strata of patients with 2 AEDs at baseline is lower (a difference of 16% between the 
treatment  groups)  and  just  not  statistically  significant  compared  to  those  with  1  AED  (a difference  of 
26%). This result may be interpreted as indicating less effect obtained in a more refractory population, 
which is expectable.  
It is reassuring to observe that the effects are in the same direction in all strata that were examined 
(Enzyme-inducing AEDs and Number of AEDs). 
The CHMP concluded that the results remain consistent across different types of patient population.

A cumulative distribution curve was used to display the data on change in median seizure frequency. 
See figure 2.7.3-2 below. The effect on seizure frequency consistently favoured Zonisamide across the 
range of outcomes.  
Twenty seven percent of the subjects in the Zonisamide group compared with 12% of subjects in the 
placebo  group  had  ≥  75%  decrease  in  seizure  frequency  during  the  Maintenance  Period.  Fourteen 
percent of subjects in the Zonisamide group compared with 3% of subjects in the placebo group had a 
decrease in seizure frequency of 100%. 
In contrast 10% of the subjects in the Zonisamide group compared with 21% in the placebo group had 
an  increase  in  seizure  frequency  of  ≥  25%.  Five  percent  of  subjects  in  the  Zonisamide  group 
compared with 9% of subjects in the placebo group had an increase in seizure frequency of ≥ 100%. 
Figure 2.7.3-2 Cumulative Distribution Function of Percent Change in Seizure Frequency: ITT Population 
(Maintenance-LOCF)  
Percentage of subjects who achieved seizure free status 
In the ITT-LOCF Population for the Maintenance Period, 14% of those in the Zonisamide group and 3% 
of those in the placebo group achieved seizure-free status during the whole of the Maintenance Period, 
P value = 0.0049 for the Zonisamide group. For the combined Titration Period and Maintenance Period 
(ITT-OC),  the  percentages  of  subjects  who  achieved  seizure-free  status  were  4%  in  the  Zonisamide 
group and 2% in the placebo group, P value = 0.4563 for the Zonisamide group. 
The CHMP noted the results and agreed that the proportion of patients being seizure free is of limited 
value given the short observation period of 12 weeks. Longer observation would diminish these figures 
even further. 
1.4.3.  Supportive studies 
Study 302 
This  was  a  double-blind,  dose  response,  placebo-controlled,  randomized,  parallel-group  study  of  the 
safety and efficacy of Zonegran as adjunctive therapy in patients with refractory partial epilepsy. 
Design:  Following  screening,  a  12-week  prospective  Baseline  Phase  was  used  to  gather  reliable  pre-
treatment  seizure  frequency  data.  Patients  were  randomized  to  receive  one  of  four  treatments: 
Zonegran  500  mg/day,  300  mg/day,  100  mg/day,  or  placebo,  in  the  ratio  2:1:1:2.  The  treatment 
period  consisted  of  a  Titration  Phase  (6  weeks),  a  Stabilization  Phase  (2  weeks),  and  a  Fixed  Dose 
Zonegran  
EMA/532724/2013  
Page 26/64
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assessment Phase (16 weeks). Patients then entered a controlled Withdrawal (down-titration) Phase (4 
weeks) or participated in an extension study (AN46046-353; initially receiving a Zonegran dose, after 
suitable titration, of 500 mg/day). 
Inclusion  criteria:  Patients  had  to  be  adolescent  and  adult  aged  ≥  12  years  with  a  diagnosis  of 
refractory epilepsy characterized by partial seizures with or without secondary generalization. Patients 
were  required  to  have  an  abnormal EEG  consistent  with  the  diagnosis  of  epilepsy  and a  CT/MRI  scan 
confirming  the  absence  of  a  progressive  neurological  lesion.  They  were  required  to  have  had  ≥  12 
partial seizures during the 12-week Baseline Period with no more than a 3-week seizure-free interval 
during  this  time.  Patients  were  also  required  to  have  unsatisfactory  seizure  control  despite  a  stable 
regimen of one to three licensed AEDs.  
Dose: Study drug was administered orally, twice daily, at an initial dose of 50 mg/day, increasing to 
100 mg/day, 300 mg/day, or 500 mg/day.  
Endpoints:  The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  proportion  of  responders,  defined  as  ≥  50%  from 
baseline  in  seizure  frequency  during  the  maintenance  period.  The  primary  analysis  used  the  ITT 
Population.  Secondary  efficacy  included  the  median  percentage  change  from  baseline  in  complex 
partial seizures during the fixed dose period.   
Results 
Altogether,  39  adolescents  (12-18)  were  included  in  this  study:  7  in  the  100mg/day  group,  8  in  the 
300mg/day group, 9 in the 500mg/day group, and 15 in placebo. Of these patients, 32 were eligible to 
be included in the ITT analysis.  
The  proportion  responders  for  the  entire  study  population  (including  adolescents  and  adults)  was 
52.3%  in  the  500mg/day  group,  36.0%  in  the  300mg/day  group,  22.5%  the  100mg/day  group 
compared to 21.3% in the placebo group. The effect was statistically significant for the 500mg/day and 
300mg/day doses. 
A total of 31 adolescent patients were evaluable for efficacy. This small number means that these data 
are of limited value. Still, the proportion of responders in the treatment groups in this study were: 3 of 
the  5  adolescent  patients  (60.0%)  in  the  500-mg/day  treatment  group,  1  of  1  (100%)  in  the  300-
mg/day  group  and  1  of  5  (20.0%)  in  the  100-mg/day  group  compared  to  2  of  10  (20.0%)  in  the 
placebo group. None of these differences were statistically significant.  
The  difference  between  the  500-mg/day  group  (n=5)  and  placebo  group  (n=10)  in  the  median 
percentage change from baseline in complex partial seizure frequency was -18.7%, with a 95% CI of –
81.28 to 41.57 (P = 0.8366). No statistical comparison was performed for the 100-mg/day and 300-
mg/day treatment groups, but decreases in seizure frequency were observed. 
Altogether, the CHMP was of the opinion that the number of paediatric patients included in study 302 
is too small to allow any inference about efficacy.  
Study 313 
Study  E2090-E044-313  was  an  open-label  extension  study  following  a  double-blind,  randomised, 
placebo-controlled,  multi-centre  study  to  assess  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  adjunctive  zonisamide  in 
paediatric partial onset seizures. 
Primary Objective 
 
To assess the long term safety of zonisamide used as an adjunctive treatment in pediatric subjects 
treated with one or two other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)

Secondary Objectives 
 
 
To explore long-term maintenance of efficacy 
To assess the influence on growth and development 
Methodology 
This was an open-label extension study to assess long-term safety and efficacy, and the influence on 
growth  and  development  in  subjects  following  participation  in  a  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-
controlled, multicentre study (E2090-E044-312 [Study 312]), and to assess the efficacy and safety of 
adjunctive zonisamide in pediatric subjects (aged 6 through 17 years) with partial onset seizures. 
Subjects who completed Study 312 were invited to participate in this extension study, except for those 
enrolled at sites in India, where the Study 313 protocol was not approved in time for subjects to roll-
over.  As  Study  312  was  a  placebo-controlled  study,  subjects  completed  it  on  either  zonisamide  or 
placebo. Therefore, in order to preserve the blind of Study 312, Study 313 started with a double-blind 
Transition  Period  during  which  subjects  already  on  zonisamide  continued  on  the  same  dose  of 
zonisamide for their weight, and those who were taking placebo during Study 312 were up-titrated to 
an appropriate dose of zonisamide. At the end of the Transition Period subjects entered the Open-label 
Period, in which all subjects took zonisamide at a known dose level. At the end of the Open label Period 
subjects either down-titrated or continued taking zonisamide under Eisai’s Compassionate Use policy; 
subjects who down-titrated were permitted to up-titrate a replacement AED at the same time. 
For  those  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  in  Study  312,  dosing  with  zonisamide  started  with  a  dose  of 
approximately  1  mg/kg  and  the  titration  schedule  followed  that  of  Study  312.  The  total  daily  dose  of 
zonisamide was gradually increased until it equalled the maintenance dose of placebo the subject had 
been  receiving  at  the  end  of  Study  312.  When  this  point  was  reached,  the  subject  stopped  receiving 
placebo.  
Those subjects previously in the zonisamide arm of Study 312 continued on zonisamide, supplemented 
with  an  increasing  number  of  placebo  capsules,  thereby  mirroring  the  up-titration  regimen  being 
followed by those subjects previously randomized to placebo in Study 312. 
During  the  Open-label  Period,  subjects  could  be  down-titrated,  if  necessary  (e.g.,  as  a  result  of  an 
adverse event). This could occur as many times as required until the minimum dose at each level was 
reached.  If  a  subject  was  down-titrated  they  could  be  re  up-titrated,  if  required,  to  control  seizures; 
this could be repeated until the maximum dose in that weight group was reached. 
Study 313 is discussed in the safety section. 
1.4.4.  Conclusion on clinical efficacy 
The  MAH  has  submitted  one  pivotal  study  (a  randomised  placebo  controlled  trial)  in  support  of  the 
indication  for  adjunctive  use  of  Zonisamide  in  children  aged  over  6  years  and  in  adolescents  (6-17 
years). 
The  design  of  the  study  was  broadly  in  line  with  the  Guideline  on  Clinical  Investigation  of  Medicinal 
Products  in  the  Treatment  of  Epileptic  Disorders.  Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  considered 
appropriate  and  included  subjects  with  inadequately  controlled  partial  seizures  in  the  age-group  for 
which the indication is sought. 
The  choice  of  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  (responder  rates  and  decrease  in  seizure  frequency) 
was appropriate. 
Zonegran  
EMA/532724/2013  
Page 28/64
 
 
 
 
 
Given that a dose range from 300mg to 500mg is recommended for adjunctive use in adults, the CHMP 
recommended also a dose range for children and adolescents, which was agreed by the MAH.  
The proportion of subjects with a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency in the Zonisamide arm 
was 50% compared to 31% in the placebo arm in the ITT-LOCF analysis. Similar results were seen in 
the  ITT-OC  and  PP-LOCF  population.  A  higher  placebo  response  rate  (31%)  than  that  seen  in  similar 
trials, was noted for the primary endpoint in all populations assessed (ITT-LOCF, ITT-OC and PP-LOCF) 
in  the  maintenance  period.    Zonisamide  was  superior  to  placebo  in  terms  of  the  reduction  of  median 
seizure frequency and seizure freedom. The reduction in median seizure frequency in the maintenance 
period  compared  to  baseline  was  greater  for  Zonisamide  than  placebo  in  the  ITT-LOCF,  ITT-OC,  and 
PP-LOCF populations (median difference approximately 25%). 
The  effect  is  consistent  in  the  younger  and  older  age  groups  (6-11  and  12-17)  as  well  as  in  patients 
receiving different kinds of AEDs and in patients with different types of seizures. 
Efficacy results in the paediatric study are consistent with those in the adults study (study 302) where 
% responders in the 500mg group was 44% compared to 20% in placebo. 
Indirect comparison  to other AED which are already indicated for adjunctive therapy in children with 
partial seizure, showed that the efficacy of Zonegran is in the same order of magnitude. In terms of % 
responders (>50% reduction in seizure frequency) a study in lamotrigine in a similarly defined sample 
(Duchowny  et  al.,  1999) 1  showed  42%  responders  in  the  lamotrigine  arm  compared  to  16%  in 
placebo, and a study in  Topiramate (cited in French et al., 2004)2 showed 39% responders compared 
to 20% in the topiramate and placebo arms, respectively. Another study which is also cited by French 
et al. (2004) of oxcarbazepine achieved 41% response in the active arms compared to 22% in placebo 
and a study of Levetiracepam described in the SPC of this product showed response rates of 45% vs. 
20%  in  the  active  arm  compared  to  placebo,  respectively.  Hence  all  these  studies  achieved  a  20%-
25%  difference  between  active  arm  and  placebo  in  percent  responders,  which  is  consistent  with  the 
difference  that  was  obtained  for  Zonegran,  except  that  in  the  Zonegran  study  the %  responders  was 
slightly higher in both treatment arms (50% compared to 39-45% in the active arm and 31% vs. 20-
25% in the placebo arm). 
Overall, zonisamide has demonstrated efficacy in adjunctive use in the paediatric population. 
1.5.  Clinical safety aspects 
1.5.1.  Introduction 
The  overall  analysis  of  safety  presents  data  from  the  pivotal  Phase  3  study  (Study  312)  and  its 
double-blind extension study (Study 313). 
In addition, a supportive analysis of pooled safety data across 17 Zonisamide studies with paediatric 
subjects  is  also  presented.  The  objective  of  the  pooled  safety  analysis  was  to  assess  the  safety  of 
Zonisamide in the paediatric population from all available completed studies at the time of submission 
which: recruited more than 3 paediatric Zonisamide-treated subjects (aged 3 through 16 years at first 
dose); were conducted to ICH standards; and for which a report compliant with ICH E3 was available. 
A  total  of  398  Zonisamide  and  109  placebo  paediatric  subjects  from  17  studies  were  identified  as 
eligible for the analysis. Results of study 313 are not part of the pooled safety data.

1.5.2.  Patient exposure 
Patient exposure 
Study  312:  A  total  of  107  patients  received  Zonegran  and  100  received  placebo.  The  majority  of 
patients  were  exposed  for  5-6  months,  with  a  median  of  4.5  month.  During  the  maintenance  period 
(12  weeks),  the  majority  of  patients  (93%)  were  treated  with  5-9  mg/kg/day  of  Zonegran.  The 
remaining patients (7%) received 9-12 mg/kg/day.  
Table 25. Exposure (Study 312 Safety Population) 
Number of months completed = Number of months subject received at least one dose of study drug. 
Number of months completed on study was calculated as (Duration of exposure/365.25)*12, rounded up to the next month. 
Time on trial = date of last dose prior to down-titration - date of first dose + 1. 
Duration of exposure = date of last dose prior to down-titration – date of first dose + 1 – any drug holidays or dose interruptions. 
y = years; Zonisamide = zonisamide 
Pooled  data  (this included study 312): A total of 398 patients received Zonegran (191 patients were 
younger than12 years and 207 were 12-16 years old). The median duration of exposure to Zonegran 
was  147  days  in  the  <12  years  old  and  141  days  in  the  12-16  years  old.  Maximum  dose  was 
12mg/kg/day for patients from paediatric studies while higher doses were used in adolescents included 
in adults studies. 
Mean duration of follow-up on Zonegran was 319 days, on placebo 133 days.

Table 24 Study Overview by Age Group (Pooled Safety Population) 
Zonisamide = zonisamide 
a: Some subjects were enrolled in more than one study. 
b: Placebo subjects < 12 years old were only recruited in Study 312. 
c: Placebo subjects 12 through 16 years old were recruited in Studies 312, 302, and 922. 
d: Four subjects in Study 922 were treated with placebo for the first 12 weeks before starting Zonisamide treatment. These subjects are counted in both the placebo and Zonisamide 
arms. 
e: Placebo subjects from Study 302, who entered Study 353, received Zonisamide in Study 353. These subjects were counted in both the placebo and Zonisamide arms. 
There  were  differences  in  exposure  between  placebo  and  Zonisamide  and  differences  in  exposure  to 
Zonisamide across studies included both in terms of study duration and Zonisamide dose.  
In the Zonisamide < 12 years group, the majority of subjects were from Study 354 (55.0%) or Study 
312  (28.8%).  The  maximum  dose  was  12  mg/kg/day  in  Study  354  and  8  mg/kg/day  in  Study  312. 
However, although the maximum dose was 12 mg/kg/day in Study 354, approximately one third had a 
dose up to 6.2 mg/kg/day, 16% to 20% had a dose of 6.2 to 8.8 mg/kg/day, and approximately one 
third had a dose > 11.75 mg/kg/day. The proposed target dose is 8 mg/kg/day. 
Studies  that  recruited  adult  and  paediatric  subjects  were  dosed  on  a  fixed-dose  basis,  rather  than 
adjusted  according  to  weight.  Thus,  the  majority  of  paediatric  subjects  included  in  the  pooled 
summaries were titrated to a higher dose of Zonisamide than is proposed in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics 
In  terms  of  the  Zonisamide  subgroups,  the  Zonisamide  <  12  years  subgroup  included  a  greater 
proportion  of  subjects  from  studies  with  a  faster  titration  than  that  in  the  12  through  16  years  age 
subgroup.  Faster  titration  was  associated  with  a  higher  incidence  of  TEAEs.  The  rate  of  titration  was 
adjusted during the clinical development. 
The mean duration of exposure was substantially longer in the Zonisamide than placebo group (318.7 
days compared with 132.8 days). The mean duration of exposure was similar in the age groups of < 
12 years and 12 to 16 years. The mean duration of exposure was slightly lower in the Zonisamide 6 to 
11 years age group (296.0 days) and higher in the < 6 years group (390.8 days).

The  mean,  modal  and  last  doses  of  Zonisamide  were  lower  in  the  <  12  years  compared  with  the  12 
through  16  years  group.  This  is  likely  to  reflect  the  dosing  schedule  in  the  <  12  years  group  since 
many  of  the  subjects  aged  <  12  years  were  treated  on  a  mg/kg  basis  rather  than  with  a  fixed  dose 
(160/191[ 84%] from Study 312 and Study 354. 
Table 26. Summary of Exposure to Zonisamide (Pooled Safety Population) 
The data initially presented by the MAH with the variation application was not considered sufficient to 
properly  assess  the  safety  of  this  product  in  children  and  adolescents  and  the  number  of  patients 
exposed  for  longer  time  was  not  considered  sufficient.  The  guideline  for  epilepsy  studies  requires  for 
the  assessment  of  safety,  the  inclusion  of  at  least  100  children  for  duration  of  at  least  one  year  to 
better assess long-term safety. 
The  MAH  subsequently  submitted  the  results  of  study  313.  The  total  number  of  subjects  exposed  to 
Zonisamide for over 1 year including Study 313 and the pooled population is 230. 
A total of 144 subjects entered Study 313 and received Zonisamide (72 subjects from the Study 312 
Zonisamide group and 72 subjects from the Study 312 placebo group). Subjects entered an initial 2- to 
11-week double-blind Transition Period during which subjects already on Zonisamide continued on the 
same dose of Zonisamide for their weight, and those who were taking placebo during Study 312 were 
up-titrated to an appropriate dose of Zonisamide. 
Exposure data from Study 312 and Study 313 were combined for subjects who were on Zonisamide in 
Study  312;  i.e.,  for  subjects  from  the  Study  312  Zonisamide  group,  the  exposure  data  included  the 
time on Zonisamide in Study 312. The duration of the treatment period in Study 312 prior to entering 
the extension study was 20 weeks (140 days [4.6 months]). Median exposure for the combined group 
was  444.5  days  (14.6  months;  526  days  [17.3  months]  in  subjects  from  the  Study  312  Zonisamide 
group and 385 days [12.6 months] in subjects from the Study 312 placebo group). 
A total of 108 (75%) subjects in Study 313 (59 [81.9%] from the Study 312 Zonisamide group and 49 
[68.1%]  from  the  Study  312  placebo  group),  were  on  the  study  for  more  than  1  year  and  were 
exposed to Zonisamide treatment for more than 1 year.

1.5.3.  Adverse events 
TEAEs in Study 312 and the pooled analysis were defined as those AEs that started on or after the first 
dose  of  study  drug  until  15  days  after  the  date  of  last  dose  (including  down-titration  where 
appropriate,  i.e.,  within  15  days  of  the  last  dose  of  study  drug  which  was  >  0  mg).  In  the  pooled 
analysis,  AEs  that  occurred  after  a  subject  switched  from  placebo  to  Zonisamide  were  reported  as 
Zonisamide AEs. AEs were also summarized by the following time periods for onset: Study Weeks 0 to 
12 weeks, 13 to 24 weeks, and 25+ weeks. 
In  Study  312  the  overall  rates  of  TEAEs  were  similar  between  the  Zonisamide  and  placebo  groups 
(55.1%  and  50.0%,  respectively).  In  the  age-group  6  –  11,  TEAEs  were  reported  for  49.1%  of 
Zonisamide  subjects  and  54.5%  of  placebo  subjects.  In  the  age-group  12  -  17  years,  TEAEs  were 
reported for 61.5% of the Zonisamide group and 44% of those on placebo. 
Common TEAEs (incidence ≥ 2% in any treatment group) are presented in table 25 below. TEAEs with 
frequency  higher  by  more  than  1%  (1  patient)  in  the  Zonegran  group  compared  to  placebo  were: 
Somnolence (Zonegran: 4.7%; placebo: 2.0%), vomiting (Zonegran: 3.7%; placebo: 2.0%), diarrhoea 
(Zonegran:  3.7%;  placebo:  1.0%),  decreased  weight  (Zonegran:  4.7%;  placebo:  3.0%),  decreased 
appetite (Zonegran: 6.5%; placebo: 4.0%), and cough (Zonegran: 2.8%; placebo: 1.0%). 
Headache,  decreased  appetite,  and  weight  decreased  occurred  in  similar  proportions  of  patients  in 
each  treatment  group  during  the  Titration  Period  and  the  Maintenance  Period.  All  reports  of 
somnolence occurred during the Titration Period. 
All these AEs (i.e. somnolence, vomiting, diarrhoea, decreased weight and decreased appetite) except 
cough  were  also  found  in  the  adults  studies  of  Zonegran  and  are  therefore  not  unexpected. 
Nevertheless,  the  implications  for  children  of  somnolence,  decreased  appetite  and  weight,  and   
vomiting,  diarrhoea  and  dehydration  have  different  implications  in  terms  of  effects  on  growth  and 
maturation and effect of somnolence on education.

Table 27. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events with an Incidence at least 2% in any 
Treatment Group by System Organ Class and Preferred Term (Study 312 Safety Population) 
In the pooled data in contrast to Study 312 TEAEs occurred in 82.9% of those on Zonisamide and 55% 
of those on placebo. 
Common  TEAEs  (≥  5%)  according  to  3  age  categories  (<  6  years,  6-11  years,  12-16  years)  in  the 
pooled safety population are presented in Table 2.5-8 below. 
The mean duration of exposure for the 6-11 years old was similar to that in the 12-17 years old (391 
days and 319 days, respectively). 
The most common TEAEs (≥ 10%) in the 6-11 years group were pyrexia (21.9%), headache (21.2%), 
upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (21.1%),  decreased  appetite  (20.5%),  rash  (12.3%),  somnolence 
(18.5%),  vomiting  (14.4%),  fatigue  (13.7%),  nasopharyngitis  (13.7%),  sinusitis  (11.0%),  viral 
infection  (11.0%),  abdominal  pain  upper  (10.3%),  cough  (10.3%),  insomnia  (10.3%),  and  nasal 
congestion (10.3%). 
The  most  common  TEAEs  (≥  10%)  in  the  12-16  years  group  included  headache  (18.4%),  decreased 
appetite (17.4%), fatigue (12.6%), dizziness (12.1%), and somnolence (11.1%). 
Zonegran  
EMA/532724/2013  
Page 34/64
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Most  of  the  AEs  with  a  frequency  ≥  10%  are  already  described  in  the  SPC  of  Zonegran  (pyrexia, 
decreased appetite, rash, somnolence, vomiting, fatigue, abdominal pain, insomnia, and dizziness) or 
in  study  312  described  above  (headache,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  nasopharyngitis,  and 
cough). Except for cough, the other AEs appeared in study 312 in similar frequencies in the Zonegran 
and  placebo  groups.  Only  sinusitis,  viral  infection,  and  nasal  congestion  are  new  AEs  that  were  not 
found  in  the  short-term  trial  or  the  SPC  of  Zonegran.  However,  these  AEs  are  not  unexpected  in  a 
paediatric population. 
The  CHMP  in  any  case  considered  that  the  events  of  decreased  appetite  and  weight,  vomiting,  and 
somnolence  have  a  different  implication  for  children  and  adolescents  in  terms  of  impact  on  growth, 
cognitive  development,  and  risk  of  dehydration,  respectively.  These  events  are  analysed  in  detail  in 
section 2.5.4. 
TEAEs  observed  at  a  higher  incidence  in  paediatric  subjects  than  adults  subjects  with  adjunctive 
Zonisamide use. 
The following TEAEs were reported at a higher incidence in the pooled paediatric population than in the 
pooled adult population: pneumonia (3.8% v 1.6%); dehydration (2.3% v 0.2%); sweating decreased 
(2.6%  v  0%);  and  liver  function  abnormalities  (0.5%  to  2.3%  v  0.09%  to  0.3%).  In  addition  the 
following  TEAEs  were  reported  at  a  higher  incidence  in  the  paediatric  than  adult  population  (but  are 
Zonegran  
EMA/532724/2013

commonly  observed  in  paediatric  subjects  with  epilepsy  receiving  AEDs):  otitis  media,  pharyngitis, 
sinusitis,  upper  respiratory  tract  infections,  cough,  epistaxis,  rhinitis,  abdominal  pain,  vomiting,  rash, 
eczema and fever. 
The MAH was unable to exclude the possibility that pneumonia, dehydration, sweating decreased and 
liver  function  abnormalities  were  causally  associated  with  Zonisamide  treatment.  Therefore  it  was 
proposed  to  add  warnings  to  section 4.8  of  the  SPC  regarding  a  relatively higher  reporting  frequency 
for these TEAEs in paediatric subjects compared to adult subjects. 
Additional AEs that were added to section 4.8 as they were commonly observed in paediatrics patients 
receiving  other  AEDs  including  levetiracetam,  lamotrigine,  and  topiramate  are:  Otitis  media, 
pharyngitis,  sinusitis  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  cough,  epistaxis  and  rhinitis,  abdominal 
pain, Vomiting, rash and eczema, and fever. 
Additional AE also added to 4.8 with higher frequency in the paediatrics population included amnesia (5 
(1.3%)  vs.  1  (0.9%)),  blood  creatine  phosphokinase  increased  (1  (0.3%)  vs.  1  (0.09%)),  creatinine 
increased  (2  (0.5%  vs.  0),  lymphadenopathy  (4  (1.0%)  vs.  5  (0.4%)),  and  thrombocytopenia  (2 
(0.5%) vs. 1 (0.9%)).  
Treatment related adverse events 
In  Study  312,  a  higher  proportion  of  TEAEs  in  Zonisamide-treated  subjects  were  considered  by  the 
Investigator to be related to study drug compared with placebo-treated subjects (Zonisamide: 33.6%; 
placebo:  24.0%).  However,  the  only  treatment-related  TEAE  reported  at  a  ≥  2%  higher  incidence  in 
the Zonisamide compared with placebo group was somnolence (Zonisamide: five subjects [4.7%] and 
placebo:  two  subjects  [2.0%];  all  TEAEs  of  somnolence  were  reported  as  treatment-related).  Few 
subjects had severe TEAEs that were treatment-related and the incidence was similar between the two 
treatments groups (Zonisamide: 2.8%; placebo: 3.0%). 
Overall, 7 subjects (3.4%) had TEAEs which were considered probably related to study medication, 4 
subjects  (3.7%)  in  the  Zonisamide  group  and  3  subjects  (3.0%)  in  the  placebo  group.  In  the 
Zonisamide  group,  somnolence,  tremor,  altered  state  of  consciousness,  fall,  and  dermatitis  allergic 
were considered probably related to study medication. 
Few  subjects  had  severe  TEAEs  which  were  treatment-related  and  the  incidence  was  similar  between 
the two treatment groups (Zonisamide: 2.8%; placebo: 3.0%). 
In  the  pooled  analysis,  few  subjects  had  serious  TEAEs  that  were  reported  as  treatment-related:  six 
subjects (4.1%) in the 6 through 11 years group and eight subjects (3.9%) in the 12 through 16 years 
group. The only event reported as treatment-related in more than one subject in either age group was 
status epilepticus in the 12 through 16 years group (two subjects, < 1%). There were no SAEs of rash 
reported. 
Serious AEs (SAEs) 
Study 312 
Table  28  below  summarizes  key  features  about  the  SAEs  in  study  312.  Altogether,  3  patients  in  the 
Zonegran  group  had  a  total  of  5  SAEs  (not  including  the  patient  who  died)  and  2  patients  in  the 
placebo group had a total of 3 SAEs. The SAEs were considered treatment related in 2 patients in the 
Zonegran group (with 4 events) and in 1 patient in the placebo group (with 2 events). 
No SAEs required a change in dose or discontinuation, and all of the SAEs other than the SAE leading 
to death resolved without sequelae. 
Zonegran

Although it is noted that in all cases of SAEs in the Zonegran group, the dose was not changed and the 
event was resolved, these findings raised nevertheless a concern. 
Pooled data 
SAEs were reported for 57 patients (14.3%) in the Zonegran group of whom 23 patients (15.8%) were 
aged  6  through  11  years  and  23  patients  (11.1%)  were  aged  12  through  16  years  (the  remaining 
patients  were  aged  <  6  years).  Other  than  those  SAEs  in  the  Zonegran  group  that  were  fatal,  the 
majority  of  serious  TEAEs  resolved.  The  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  overall  were  convulsion 
(4.3%), status epilepticus (2.5%), and dehydration (1.8%). 
The  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  in  the  Zonegran  group  in  the  6  through  11  years  group  were 
convulsion  (10  patients,  6.8%),  status  epilepticus  (five  patients,  3.4%),  dehydration  (four  patients, 
2.7%),  and  pneumonia  (four  patients,  2.7%).  Other  SAEs  reported  in  more  than  one  patient  in  the 
Zonegran group included sepsis (two patients, 1.4%), and overdose (two patients, 1.4%). 
The  most  frequently  reported  serious  SAEs  in  the  Zonegran  group  in  the  12  through  16  years  group 
were  status  epilepticus  (four  patients,  1.9%),  convulsion  (three  patients,  1.4%),  and  unintended 
pregnancy  (three  patients,  1.4%).  Other  SAEs  reported  in  more  than  one  patient  in  the  Zonegran 
group included abdominal pain (two patients, < 1%). 
Zonegran  
EMA/532724/2013  
Page 37/64
 
 
 
 
 
 
Altogether,  the  incidence  of  serious  SAEs  in  the  paediatric  population  of  14.3%  is  slightly  lower  than 
that found in the adult Zonegran add-on studies (19.0%). The majority of these events suggest lack of 
efficacy. The next most common SAE includes dehydration. 
Serious  TEAEs  which  were  not  resolved  included  visual  impairment  (one  subject)  and  aggression  and 
vomiting (in one subject) in the 6 through 11 years group, and nephrolithiasis (one subject) in the 12 
through 16 years group. 
Few subjects had serious TEAEs that were reported as treatment-related: six subjects (4.1%) in the 6 
through 11 years group and eight subjects (3.9%) in the 12 through 16 years group. The only event 
reported  as  treatment-related  in  more  than  one  subject  in  either  age  group  was  status  epilepticus  in 
the 12 through 16 years group (two subjects, < 1%). 
There were no SAEs of rash reported. 
Summary of study 313 
Patients  who  completed  study  312  had  the  option  to  continue  in  study  313.  The  initial  phase  of  this 
study  consisted  of  double-blind  transition  period  in  which  Zonegran  treated  patients  continued  their 
treatment and placebo treated patients were up-titrated to Zonegran during the first 11 weeks. After 
the  transition  period  the  study  became  open  label  for  up  to  72  weeks  (according  to  protocol 
amendment  2)  or  up  to  59  weeks  (according  to  protocol  amendment  3).  Following  the  open-label 
period, patients who discontinued or ended the study entered a down titration period. 
Altogether, 72 patients from the Zonegran group and 72 patients from the placebo group of study 312 
enrolled in this study. 
The safety results were: 
 
The incidence of treatment-emergent  adverse events (TEAEs) during the treatment period in the 
Study  313  extension  study  was  48.6%.  In  Study  313,  TEAEs  were  reported  by  37  (51.4%) 
subjects  previously  treated  with  Zonisamide  in  Study  312,  and  33  (45.8%)  subjects  previously 
treated  with  placebo  in  Study  312.  Differences  in  the  incidence  of  individual  TEAEs  between 
subjects previously on Zonisamide in Study 312 versus subjects newly exposed to Zonisamide in 
Study  313  were  small,  and  did  not  indicate  differences  between  short-term  and  long-term 
Zonisamide  treatment.  There  were  no  new  TEAEs  occurring  during  longer  term  treatment  with 
Zonisamide compared with TEAEs observed during Study 312. 
 
In  the  combined  group,  41  (28.5%)  subjects  reported  at  least one  TEAE in the  Transition  Period 
and 55 (39.9%) subjects reported at least one TEAE in the Open-label Period. In subjects from the 
Study 312 Zonisamide group, 24 (33.3%) reported at least one TEAE in the Transition Period and 
29 (42.0%) in the Open-label Period. In subjects from the Study 312 placebo group, 17 (23.6%) 
subjects  reported  at  least  one  TEAE  in  the  Transition  Period  and  26  (37.7%)  in  the  Open-label 
Period. 
  Overall, most TEAEs were of mild or moderate severity. The most common TEAEs reported were 
nasopharyngitis, weight decreased, and headache. 
  No subjects died during the study. Treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 
10  (6.9%)  subjects;  7  subjects  from  the  Study  312  Zonisamide  group  and  3  subjects  from  the 
Study  312  placebo  group.  The  events  were  considered  treatment-related  for  3  subjects  (renal 
colic, foot fracture, and abdominal pain). 
  A  low  proportion  of  subjects  had  TEAEs  that  resulted  in  discontinuation  of  therapy  (4  [2.8%] 
subjects: 2 subjects from each group in Study 312). 
Zonegran  
EMA/532724/2013  
Page 38/64
 
 
 
 
 
 
The proportions of subjects with TEAEs by age group (age 6 through 11 and 12 through 18 years) 
were similar (34 [50.7%] subjects and 36 [46.8%] subjects, respectively). There were no TEAEs 
that were reported at a notably different frequency by age group. 
  While  serious  rashes  have  been  reported  previously  in  association  with  Zonisamide  therapy, 
including cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, in the current study no subjects had serious rash. 
There were three cases of papular rash in 2 subjects, all of which resolved. These occurred during 
the Transition Period in subjects who had received placebo in Study 312. Two of these cases were 
considered by the Investigator to be related to study drug (the other case was considered related 
to overeating of candy sweets). No subjects had hypersensitivity reactions. 
 
There were no reports of depression, depressive symptoms, or suicidal ideation. 
  No subjects had abnormal vital signs or electrocardiogram parameters of clinical concern. 
 
There were no clinically significant treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities. 
  Decreases  in  bicarbonate  levels  of  at  least  3.5  mmol/L  were  observed  in  64  (44.4%)  subjects 
overall; a bicarbonate value of less than or equal to 16 mmol/L and a decrease from baseline of at 
least  6  mmol/L  was  observed  in  4  (2.8%)  subjects  overall.  No  TEAEs  of  decreased  bicarbonate 
were  reported.  The  decreased  bicarbonate  levels  in  Zonisamide-treated    subjects  (mean  –1.8 
mmol/L  at  Open-label  Visit  4)  were  generally  small  to  moderate,  and  were  similar  to  what  has 
been  described  in  previous  clinical  trials  of  Zonisamide  and  to  the  value  of  mean  -3.5  mmol/L 
documented in the Zonegran SmPC. There were no reports of metabolic acidosis. 
 
Tanner  stages,  time  between  transitions  of  Tanner  stages,  and  skeletal  development  results 
showed no consistent evidence of a detrimental effect on long-term growth or development. 
 
The data from Study 313 on effects on cognitive development were difficult to interpret given the 
lack  of  a  control  arm;  however,  they  could  be  consistent  with  the  effect  observed  for  category 
fluency during Study 312 in Zonisamide-treated subjects. 
Overall,  no  new  or  unexpected  safety  findings  emerged  from  this  study  evaluating  Zonisamide  as 
adjunctive therapy for the treatment of pediatric subjects with partial onset seizures. The overview of 
the safety results confirm the safety concerns identified from the short term exposure. 
However, from the long term exposure data weight decrease, dehydration and decrease in bicarbonate 
levels  were  of  concern  to  CHMP,  since  these  may  lead  to  deterioration  of  general  health  and 
comorbidities. 
1.5.4.  TEAEs of special interest 
There  are  a  number  of  TEAEs  associated  with  zonisamide  which  are  of  special  interest  e.g.  loss  of 
appetite,  weight  loss,  metabolic  acidosis,  disordered  body  temperature,  nephrocalcinosis  and 
nephrolithiasis, skin eruptions, suicidal ideation and behaviour. 
Loss of appetite and weight loss 
In Study 312, a decrease in weight of ≥ 5% was observed in 29.0% of Zonegran patients and 7.0% 
of  the  placebo  patients  and  a  decrease  of  ≥  10%  was  observed  in  4.7%  of  Zonegran  patients  and 
2.0% of placebo patients. 
Weight  decrease  was  reported  as  an  adverse  event  in  five  patients  (4.7%)  in  the  Zonegran  group 
compared to three patients (3.0%) in the placebo group. These events were considered severe in two 
patients (1.9%) and serious in one patient in the Zonegran group. The latter involved > 10% weight 
Zonegran  
EMA/532724/2013  
Page 39/64
 
 
 
 
 
loss  reported  at  follow-up.  The  event  was  severe  and  considered  related  to  treatment  by  the 
investigator. The patient’s dose was unchanged and the event resolved without treatment. 
In study 312, the mean height of patients in the Zonegran group increased at Week 12 and Week 26 
by a similar amount as in the placebo group, although data were limited. The mean height continued to 
increase during study participation. 
In the pooled safety population decrease in weight of ≥ 5% was observed  in 35.0% of the Zonegran 
patients and a decrease of ≥ 10% was observed in 10.7% of Zonegran patients. 
In the pooled population, a total of 31 patients (7.8%) in the Zonegran group reported TEAEs relating 
to  weight  loss.  Two  of  these  events  were  considered  serious.  In  one  patient  the  weight  loss  resolved 
after 22 days, the other patient was lost to follow-up; the events were considered severe and related 
to  treatment.  Weight  decreased  was  considered  to  be  severe  in  five  patients  (1.3%).  None  of  the 
TEAEs relating to weight loss led to discontinuation of Zonegran. 
In Study 313, 24 (16.7%) subjects had a decrease in weight of 10% or more from baseline at any time 
during the study; 14 (19.4%) from the Study 312 Zonisamide group and 10 (13.9%) from the Study 
312  placebo  group.  A  decrease  in  weight  of  20%  or  more  from  baseline  was  reported  in  2  subjects 
(1.4%);  1  (1.4%)  from  the  Study  312  Zonisamide  group  and  1  (1.4%)  from  the  Study  312  placebo 
roup. A decrease in weight of 5% or more from baseline at any time during the study was reported 51 
subjects (35.4%); 29 (40.3%) from the Study 312 Zonisamide group and 22 (30.6%) from the Study 
312 placebo group. Although more subjects (8.3%) from the Study 312 placebo group reported TEAEs 
of  weight  decrease  in  Study  313  compared  with  subjects  from  the  Study  312  Zonisamide  group 
(5.6%),  fewer  of  them  had  weight  decreases  of  10%  or  more  compared  with  subjects  who  were 
already on Zonisamide. This apparent discrepancy may be due to the longer duration of treatment of 
the subjects who were initially assigned to Zonisamide in Study 312, leading to greater overall weight 
loss, while these subjects were less likely to report weight loss as an adverse event (AE) in Study 313 
because it was already present during their participation in Study 312. 
In study 312, seven patients (6.5%) had decreased  appetite in the Zonegran group compared with 
four  patients  (4.0%)  in  the  placebo  group.  The  TEAEs  in  the  Zonegran  group  were  not  considered 
serious, not severe, and did not lead to discontinuation. 
In  the  pooled  population,  a  total  of  78  patients  (19.6%)  in  the  Zonegran  group  reported  TEAEs  of 
decreased appetite. The event was considered serious and related to treatment in one patient (< 1%) 
in the Zonegran group. In three patients (< 1%) the event was considered severe. Decreased appetite 
led  to  discontinuation  in  3  patients  (<  1%).  The  events  leading  to  discontinuation  were  considered 
moderate in two patients (< 1%) and severe in one patient (< 1%). 
The  MAH  presented  a  number  of  scatterplot  analysis  of  bone  age  and  delay  in  maturation  versus 
weight  change.  Analyses  of  the  bone  age,  skeletal  development,  and  sexual  maturation  data  did  not 
indicate  an  association  between  weight  change  and  effects  on  growth  and  maturation;  however  it  is 
acknowledged that data are limited. 
In  addition,  a  scatterplot  analysis  showing  that  nausea,  vomiting,  and  dehydration  tended  to  be 
transient  in  nature,  therefore,  in  their  opinion,  it  was  unlikely  they  would  have  a  long-term  effect  on 
bone  age,  skeletal  development  and  sexual  maturation.  Decreased  appetite  and  weight  loss  were 
generally of an extended  duration (from under 1 month to over 16 months). A markedly low calcium 
level  was  only  reported  in  one  subject  in  Study  313  and  only  3  subjects  had  blood  phosphate  levels 
below  the  LLN  at  any  time  point.  In  all  cases,  the  abnormal  laboratory  values  were  restricted  to  a 
single  time  point.  As  most  subjects  stayed  within  normal  ranges,  long  term  effects  are  likely  to  be 
minimal according to the MAH. 
Zonegran  
EMA/532724/2013

The  MAH  believes  that  Zonisamide  did  not  appear  to  have  any  effects  on  bone  age,  skeletal 
development  and  sexual  maturation.  However,  the  MAH  accepts  that  these  results  are  based  on 
relatively small subject numbers, and that there is a possibility that sustained weight loss could cause 
delays in development and maturation. Therefore, it was proposed to include warnings in the PI about 
the  potential  serious  nature  of  weight  loss  in  children,  and  the  potential  impact  on  growth  and 
development. The MAH will also perform intensive monitoring, and a drug-utilization study, to monitor 
risks of effects on growth, development, pubertal maturity, and bone health. 
The CHMP agreed that the addition of information to the SmPC advising monitoring of weight using 
growth charts and to the PIL advising parents to monitor their children’s weight should mitigate the 
risks of weight loss in the paediatric population. 
The proposed drug utilization study should provide evidence of the effectiveness of the advice on 
monitoring of weight, and the intensive monitoring programme should provide information on long 
term effects on growth, development, pubertal maturity, and bone health. 
Diarrhoea, vomiting and dehydration 
Diarrhoea  
In Study 312, TEAEs of diarrhoea were reported for 4 (3.7%) subjects in the Zonisamide group and 1 
(1.0%) in the placebo group. In Study 313 TEAEs of diarrhoea were reported for 4 (2.8%) subjects. In 
the pooled dataset, 33 subjects reported diarrhoea, and 56 subjects vomiting.  
With regard to diarrhoea it is agreed that the incidence is relatively rare. However the duration of this 
TEAE is variable.  
In Study 312 the longest duration appears to be three days (experienced by 2 out of 4 subjects with 
diarrhoea),  whereas  in  Study  313,  of  the  4  subjects  experiencing  diarrhoea,  two  had  a  duration  of  7 
days,  one  of  6  days  and  one  of  1  day.  In  the  pooled  data  analysis  one  subject  had  a  duration  of  30 
days, one a duration of 27 days, one 16 days, one 11 days and one was reported as having on-going 
diarrhoea. Most of the remainder had a duration ranging from 1 to 3 days. In addition some subjects 
had more than one episode of diarrhoea. 
For  the  MAH,  events  of  vomiting,  and  diarrhoea  do  not  appear  to  be  a  concern  in  paediatric  patients 
given the low incidence and the transient nature 
The CHMP agreed that events of diarrhoea appear to be relatively mild, however a significant minority 
have had prolonged diarrhoea, which might have a negative effect on compliance.  
The PI was therefore amended to highlight the occurrence of these events. 
Vomiting 
In  Study  312,  of  the  five  subjects  reported  as  having  experienced  vomiting  as  a  TEAE,  three  had  a 
duration of 1 day, one of 2 days and one of 6 days. 
In  Study  313  one  of  the  two  subjects  reporting  a  TEAE  of  vomiting  had  duration  of  7  days  and  the 
other of 1 day. The subject with duration of 7 days also had a TEAE of diarrhea. 
In the pooled analysis 7 out of 56 subjects experienced vomiting greater than 7 days duration.  
Some subjects had more than 1 reported TEAE of vomiting.  
The MAH’s notes that for a number of the extended periods of TEAEs of diarrhea and vomiting, these 
were concurrent with infections. All except one event were reported as mild. Thus, for the MAH these 
events are not considered likely to have a long-term effect on weight gain. 
Zonegran  
EMA/532724/2013  
Page 41/64
 
 
 
 
 
Whilst  vomiting  tended  to  be  short  in  duration,  the  CHMP  was  concerned  that  some  subjects 
experienced quite prolonged vomiting, which is of concern not only because it leads to weight loss and 
dehydratation,  but  also  because  it  may  reduce  treatment  compliance.  The  PI  was  therefore  amended 
to highlight the occurrence of these events. 
Dehydration 
Dehydration was one of the TEAEs reported with an outcome of death. 
The MAH provided details of all cases on dehydration, including the effects of vomiting and diarrhoea 
on risk of dehydration.  
In Study 312, 1 (0.9%) subject in the Zonisamide group had a TEAE of dehydration. This was not 
preceded by diarrhoea or vomiting.  
No subjects in Study 313 had a TEAE of dehydration. 
In the pooled dataset 9 (2.3%) subjects had a TEAE of dehydration. For 6 subjects, no prior events of 
diarrhoea or vomiting had occurred. No subjects were discontinued from treatment because of 
dehydration, but dehydration was reported serious for 7 (1.8%) subjects. This is of concern for this 
young and already vulnerable patient population. As mentioned before, for one subject, dehydration 
was one of the TEAEs reported with an outcome of death.  For 2 subjects, there was no apparent 
concurrent infection. For the remaining 6 subjects, the subject had concurrent infections or illnesses 
predisposing to dehydration: 
For the MAH, the majority of TEAEs of dehydration appear unrelated to Zonisamide treatment. 
However, the possibility cannot be excluded and it is proposed to include warnings in the PI related to 
dehydration. In the MAH’s opinion these events are not considered likely to have a long-term effect on 
weight gain. 
The CHMP concluded that there does not seem to be a marked relationship between the adverse 
events of vomiting and diarrhoea and dehydration. Nevertheless, warnings on the risk for 
dehydratation have been highlighted in the product information since it may lead to serious 
consequences.  
Disordered body temperature (oligohydrosis and hyperthermia) 
In  Study  312  four  (3.7%)  Zonisamide  subjects  (one  of  which  was  reported  as  serious)  and  3  (3%) 
placebo subjects had a TEAE relating to the above. No TEAEs led to study discontinuation. 
In  the  pooled  analysis  84  (21.1%)  subjects  reported  a  TEAE  of  disordered  body  temperature.  Most 
reports for disordered body temperature were due to pyrexia (72/84). This event is reported frequently 
in paediatric studies and could be confounded by childhood infections. 
Ten subjects (2.5%) in the Zonisamide group had TEAEs considered to be serious: seven (1.8%) with 
dehydration  (2  moderate  and  5  severe);  two  (<1%)  with  moderate  pyrexia  and  one  with  moderate 
hypohidrosis. One event of moderate dehydration and the event of hypohidrosis were considered to be 
related to Zonisamide treatment. 
In addition, in the PSUR covering the period 1 Apr 2011 to 31 Mar 2012, a fatal case of anhidrosis and 
hyperthermia  in  an  11  year  old  male  was  reported.  The  patient  had  been  camping  and  experienced 
anhidrosis and hyperthermia. Temperature was 40.9 degrees Celsius (outside temperature reported as 
40 degrees Celsius). Four days later, the patient died. 
The  wording  of  the  PI  has  been  strengthened  to  advise  discussion  with  patients  regarding  the  risk  of 
heat  stroke  with  focus  on  the  prevention  and  reduction  of  the  occurrence  of  heat  stroke  associated 
Zonegran  
EMA/532724/2013

with  exposure  to  Zonisamide  and  on  how  to  reduce  the  severity  and  impact  on  the  patient  should 
oligohidrosis/heat stroke arise. 
Effects of kidney function on growth. 
Decreases  in  bicarbonate  were  observed  with  Zonegran  treatment  in  Study  312  and  in  the  pooled 
safety  population.  There  were  no  corresponding  reports  of  respiratory  alkalosis  or  metabolic  acidosis 
with Zonegran treatment. 
In  study  312,  decreases  of  >  3.5  mmol/L  in  the  bicarbonate  value  were  observed  in  54  subjects 
(50.5%)  in  the  Zonisamide  group  and  16  subjects  (16.0%)  in  the  placebo  group.  Six  Zonisamide-
treated  subjects  (5.6%)  and  no  subjects  who  received  placebo  had  a  bicarbonate  value  of  ≤  16 
mmol/L and a decrease from baseline of > 6 mmol/L. Decreased bicarbonate was reported as an AE in 
one  subject  in  the  Zonisamide  group.  The  lowest  value  for  bicarbonate  was  14  mmol/L,  (175  mg 
Zonisamide) who had a 6 mmol/L decrease from baseline at the Final Visit. This was not reported as an 
AE. 
In  the  pooled  data,  29  subjects  (9.4%)  in  the  Zonisamide  group  had  a  bicarbonate  level  below 
16mmol/L and a drop from baseline of ≥ 6mmol/L. This included 21 subjects (11.1%) aged < 12 years 
and  seven  subjects  (6.5%)  aged  12  through  16  years.  In  these  28  patients,  bicarbonate  levels  were 
transiently abnormal in 21 leaving 7 patients with continuously abnormal levels. 
Similarly to the data from study 312, bicarbonate levels below 16 mmol/l were observed also in study 
313,  but  in  a  lower  percentage  (4  subjects,  2.8%).  No  metabolic  acidosis  was  reported,  which  was 
reassuring.  The  MAH  explained  that  these  findings  are  similar  to  what  is  reported  in  the  Zonisamide 
SPC already. 
The MAH provided data on duration of low bicarbonate (i.e., <22mmol/L). A total of 126/179 (70.4%) 
subjects  who  received  Zonisamide  in  either  Study  312  or  Study  313  had  at  least  one  treatment-
emergent  bicarbonate  measurement  below  22  mmol/L.  Duration  was  calculated  from  the  visit  where 
the bicarbonate values was below 22 mmol/L to the day before the next visit where bicarbonate value 
was greater than or equal to 22 mmol/L or up to the last dose date. Based on these data, the median 
duration of low bicarbonate was 188 days (mean: 215 days), with a range of 14 through 654 days. 
Low  bicarbonate  values  are  prolonged  in  some  cases,  consistent  with  the  pharmacological  profile  of 
Zonisamide.  
At the request of CHMP the MAH analysed the implications of phosphate loss on growth by presenting 
data  on  growth  parameters  in  the  individuals  in  which  bicarbonate  decrease  has  been  observed  in 
study  313.  Tanner  Stage  transition  time,  bone  age  and  skeletal  maturation  data  was  analysed  for 
trends  amongst  subjects  who  had  a  decrease  in  bicarbonate  level  of  more  than  3.5  mmol/L  from 
baseline. The MAH concludes that the data do not indicate that reductions in bicarbonate levels have a 
detrimental  effect  on  growth  and  development.  There  were  no  reports  of  metabolic  acidosis  in  these 
subjects  and  no  other  adverse  event  reports  which  could  have  been  linked  to  low  bicarbonate  levels. 
However, it is acknowledged that data are limited. 
The MAH also presented individual data on all subjects in Study 313 who had a blood phosphate level 
below  0.65  IU/L  (the  LLN)  at  any  time  during  the  study.  Only  3  subjects  had  blood  phosphate  levels 
below  the  LLN,  and  in  all  cases,  this  finding  was  restricted  to  a  single  time  point.  The MAH  therefore 
concludes that Zonisamide does not have significant effects on blood phosphate levels. 
In the assessment of Study 313 it was noted that median levels of bicarbonate dropped below baseline 
levels  and  remained  below  baseline levels  throughout  Study  313  especially in  those  who had  been  in 
the Zonegran arm of Study 312. This raises the prospect of prolonged low bicarbonate levels.  
Zonegran

The CHMP noted the information on subjects with a bicarbonate decrease of >3.5mmol/L from baseline 
and  impact  on  skeletal  maturity  and  transition  times  to  Tanner  stages.  It  appears  that  delay  or 
advancement  in  skeletal  maturity  was  similar  in  those  with  decreased  bicarbonate  and  those  with 
normal levels in the population at maturity and those ‘not yet at maturity’. However, data was limited 
and there is no long term data. 
The current SmPC for Zonegran already contains warning on the risk of metabolic acidosis, which may 
be  more  frequent  and  severe  in  younger  patients.  The  SPC  recommends  monitoring  of  serum 
bicarbonate levels in patients at risk and advises to take appropriate measures if elevations persist. An 
additional warning has been introduced to recommend appropriate evaluation and monitoring of serum 
bicarbonate in paediatric subjects. The MAH also committed to a drug-utilization study to monitor that 
physicians follow this advice.  
Kidney stones 
Effects  on  the  kidney  have  been  observed  in  paediatric  studies  that  were  consistent  with  the  effects 
seen in adult subjects. There were no reported events of nephrolithiasis in Study 312 and one reported 
event in Study 313, which led to discontinuation. In the pooled analysis (which does not include Study 
313), 4 (1%) subjects had a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) of nephrolithiasis and 1 (<1%) 
subject  in  the  Zonisamide  group  had  a  TEAE  of  nephrocalcinosis;  none  of  these  events  led  to 
discontinuation. 
Nephrolithiasis  was  reported  as  mild  in  most  subjects.  Nephrolithiasis  was  reported  as  severe  in  one 
subject. 
Adverse event data and laboratory parameters of interest for possible kidney damage (albumin, blood 
urea  nitrogen  [BUN],  calcium,  chloride,  creatinine,  and  bicarbonates)  were  reviewed.  None  of  the 
subjects had TEAEs indicative of chronic kidney damage. 
Nephrolithiasis is a known complication of treatment with Zonegran. The MAH concur with CHMP that 
for  subjects  with  nephrolithiasis,  this  may  lead  to  alteration  of  kidney  function  in  some  cases,  which 
may translate into chronic kidney damage. Thus the current warning in section 4.4 and Section 4.5 of 
the  Zonegran  SmPC  have  been  amended  to  reflect  that  some  patients  may  be  at  increased  risk  for 
renal  stone  formation  and  associated  signs  and  symptoms,  and  that  nephrolithialis  might  lead  to 
chronic kidney damage. The MAH also committed to intensive monitoring for renal effects, including a 
drug-utilization study; therefore, these measures are considered sufficient to address this risk. 
Skin eruptions 
In  Study  312  three  subjects  (2.8%)  in  the  Zonisamide  group  and  one  in  the  placebo  group  had  skin 
eruptions  (dermatitis,  dermatitis  allergic,  eczema,  or  rash  morbilliform),  one  of  which  led  to  study 
discontinuation and none of which were reported as serious. 
In  the  pooled  analysis  54  subjects  (13.6%)  in  the  Zonisamide  group  reported  TEAEs  relating  to  skin 
eruptions. The majority (41) of the events were rash. No serious TEAEs were reported. TEAEs relating 
to skin eruptions led to discontinuation for four subjects (1%) in the Zonisamide group (two with rash 
and one each with drug eruption and urticaria). There were no reports of Stevens Johnson Syndrome 
or toxic epidermal necrolysis. 
A  warning  about  rash  is  already  included  in  the  SPC  of  Zonegran  including  a  warning  about  Stevens 
Johnson Syndrome. 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour 
Study 312 did not report any TEAEs related to suicidal ideation or behaviour. 
Zonegran  
EMA/532724/2013  
Page 44/64
 
 
 
 
 
The  pooled  analysis  reported  1  case  of  suicidal  ideation  (<1%)  and  9  cases  (2.3%)  of  psychiatric 
disorder  (all  depression)  in  the  Zonisamide  group.  All  were  considered  mild  or  moderate  and  one 
patient discontinued from a study. 
The  CHMP  noted  that  the  significance  of  these  findings  on  suicidality  and  depression  difficult  to 
interpret however the MAH should continue to monitor these kinds of events in PSURs. 
An appropriate warning on this issue is already included in section 4.4 of the SPC of Zonegran. 
Pancreatitis and elevated amylase and lipase 
In Study 312, there were no TEAEs of pancreatitis. In the pooled population, one patient (< 1%) aged 
10 years had a serious TEAE of pancreatitis. The pancreatitis was severe, led to discontinuation from 
treatment, and resolved after 6 days. The event was considered to be related to Zonegran treatment. 
The patient had been receiving concomitant valproate treatment prior to this event. 
No events of increased pancreatic enzymes were reported in any of the studies. 
The  CHMP  acknowledged  that  risk  of  pancreatitis  is  already  known  and  is  mentioned  in  the  warning 
section (4.4) of Zonegran.  
Immune system and thyroid hormones 
Immune  system  and  thyroid  hormones  were  evaluated  in  Study  312  as  requested  by  the  EMA.  The 
mean  values  for  immune  system  and  thyroid  hormone  evaluations  were  within  the  normal  range  at 
baseline  and  the  Final  Visit  for  both  treatment  groups.  There  were  no  clinically  important  changes  in 
either mean immune system or thyroid hormone values from baseline to the end of therapy for either 
treatment group. Immune system and thyroid hormones were not evaluated in the pooled data. 
Effects on cognition and behaviour 
A cognitive assessment battery was planned to be performed on the first 84 patients (42 per arm) with 
an  IQ  ≥  75  in  study  312.  The  battery  was  administered  at  Screening,  Randomisation  (Week  0, 
Baseline),  Week  8  (start  of  the  maintenance  period)  and  Final  Study  Visit/Early  Termination  Visit. 
Change  from  baseline  scores  for  cognition  measures  were  assessed  using  Analysis  of  Covariance 
(ANCOVA)  at  Final  Visits  to  compare  treatment  groups.  The  table  below  presents  the  number  of 
patients that were analysed. 
The results of this sub-study show no statistically significant differences between treatment groups for 
the  primary  cognition  safety  variable,  power  of  attention.  However,  several  components  of  the  tests 
showed  evidence  for  an  impairment  with  Zonegran  at  the  final  visit,  i.e.  results  were  statistically 
significantly  worse  for  the  Zonegran  group,  in  some  analysis,  depending  on  whether  baseline  was 
controlled  for  not  and  on  whether  LOCF  or  OC  was  used.  This  included:  Speed  of  Memory  (complex 
information processing speed), colour trail test (CTT), and category fluency. 
Zonegran  
EMA/532724/2013  
Page 45/64
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At  the  request  of  CHMP,  the  MAH  presented  additional  data  on  effects  on  cognitive  aspects. 
Somnolence was reported for 5 (4.7%) subjects in the Zonisamide group and 2 (2.0%) subjects in the 
placebo group in the short term study, and in 2 (1.4%) subjects in the extension study. The effect was 
transient for most subjects similar to what is observed with other antiepileptic treatments. The results 
presented  for  cognition  are  complicated  to  interpret  in  particular  for  the  extension  study  without  a 
control arm and because they were carried out in a relatively small population (i.e. only in those with 
an IQ of 70 or greater (64 out of 144 subjects in Study 313 had baseline tests) and in addition for the 
COWAT  test  in  Study  313  data  appears  to  be  missing  for  a  large  number  of  subjects  for  Open  label 
visit 5).  
The proposal of the MAH to include a warning in 4.4. of the SPC about possible impact on cognition is 
considered acceptable. 
Tanner Stage 
In the two treatment groups there were a similar percentage of subjects in the different Tanner Stages 
at  the  baseline  and  FV  for  all  assessments.  The  P  values  for  the  differences  relative  to  placebo  were 
0.075  for  pubic  hair  growth,  0.497  for  genitals  (males)  and  0.102  for  breasts  (female).  For  each 
Tanner Stage assessment, the percentages of subjects transitioning from baseline to FV were similar in 
each treatment group. 
The  PI  has  been  amended  to  highlight  that  in  some  cases  of  weight  decrease  there  was  a  delay  in 
transition to the next Tanner stage and in bone maturation. 
Skeletal Development 
The change from baseline in bone age at the FV was small in both treatment groups, the means (±SD) 
were 0.5 (1.28) and 0.3 (0.78) for Zonisamide and placebo, respectively. There were similar delays in 
bone  maturation  in  both  treatment  groups.  For  subjects  who  had  reached  bone  maturity  (i.e.,  ≥  15 
years  for  females,  ≥  17  years  for  males),  there  was  little  evidence  in  either  treatment  group  of  any 
changes in bone age or delay in maturation. 
For subjects under the age of bone maturity, ANCOVA showed little evidence of any difference in bone 
age, with a difference in LS means of 0.12 years. The P value for the difference relative to placebo was 
0.453. 
The MAH considered that data from long-term treatment with Zonisamide in Study 313 do not indicate 
any  detrimental  effects  on  growth  or  development.  To  support  this  they  refer  to  data  on  sexual  and 
endocrine maturation and skeletal age. 
Skeletal  development  was  evaluated  through  height  and  bone  age.  The  results  were  as  expected  for 
the population under study and delays in bone maturation were minimal. Of the 5 subjects with a more 
than 10% weight loss in Study 312, 4 subjects continued into Study 313, and data on bone age after 
long-term  treatment  were  available  for  3  subjects.  A  delay  in  maturation  was  not  apparent  for  these 
subjects; bone age was similar to subject age at the last assessment for all subjects. 
The CHMP considered that it was difficult to draw conclusions from the skeletal survey in females with 
a bone age under 15 and males with a bone age under 17 given that a large number of subjects have 
do  not  have  data  for  both  baseline  and  open  visit  5  visits.  To  mitigate  the  problem  of  appetite  and 
weight loss warnings have been included in the SmPC and PIL to monitor for weight loss and appetite 
loss and a drug utilisation study will provide evidence on the effectiveness of these warnings. 
The long term effect is not known due to lack of longer exposure data.

1.5.5.  Other significant events: Death 
In  Study  312,  one  patient  (<  1%)  in  the  Zonegran  group  and  none  in  the  placebo  group  had  TEAEs 
resulting  in  death.  The  patient  was  a  14-yr-old  male  who  died  due  to  severe  status  epilepticus.  It 
appears from the narrative that weight loss and diarrhoea weakened the condition of the patient up to 
a point where the patient was unable to take his anti-epileptic agents which triggered the fatal status.  
In  the  pooled  data,  seven  patients  (1.8%)  in  the  Zonegran  group  had  a  TEAE  resulting  in  death 
(including the patient who died in Study 312).  
There  were  no  deaths  in  Study  313  (the  extension  study  of  Study  312),  which  was  reassuring.  The 
number of deaths observed in paediatric subjects treated with Zonisamide is 7 in 465 (1.5%) subjects. 
This equates to an incidence rate of 14.6/1000 person-years. This incidence is similar to the incidence 
rate of death in paediatric subjects receiving other AEDs: a long term prospective study found a rate of 
15.9/1000 person years in paediatric subjects who were not seizure free (Sillanpaa M, Sinnar S 2010) 
and  a  review  of  lamotrigine  use  in  paediatric  subjects  found  a  rate  of  15.7  per  1000  person-years  in 
9/1096 subjects (0.8%) over a median duration of 27 weeks (Messenheimner JA et al 2000).  
The  MAH  highlighted  that  the  ZNS  database  included  clinical  trials  that  enrolled  patients  with  severe 
seizures  associated  with  other  neurological  deficits.  Literature  data  from  population-based  cohort 
studies  indicate  that  the  presence  of  a  neurological  disorder  sufficient  to  cause  a  functional 
neurological deficit is a recognised risk factor for increased mortality (Camfield et al. 2002, Breningstall 
2001). Children with functional neurological deficit are 22 times more likely to die compared to those 
without deficit (Camfield et al. 2002). 
Four  of 
the  seven  deaths  occurred 
in  subjects  with  pre-existing 
functional  neurological 
conditions/remote symptomatic epilepsy. One of these deaths in a subject who developed pneumonia, 
sepsis, multi-organ failure and raised liver function tests was considered to be related to Zonegran, in 
that  the  raised  LFTs  and  multi-organ  failure  was  considered  to  be  related  but  the  pneumonia  and 
sepsis were not. 
It  is  agreed  that  the  risk  of  death  in  patients  with  epilepsy  is  considerably  higher  in  those  with  pre-
existing functional neurological impairment/remote symptomatic epilepsy and death is often related to 
the  underlying  condition  rather  than  epilepsy  per  se  (Camfield  2002,  Sallinpaa  2010,  Berg  AT  et  al 
2004.). This may explain the high death rates seen. 
In  those  without  pre-existing  functional  neurological  impairment,  there  were  three  deaths,  one  of 
which  was  considered  related  to  Zonegran.  In  this  case,  as  described  above,  the  subject  was 
underweight  and  continued  to  lose  weight  over  a  three  month  period,  stopped  taking  his  AEDs  and 
developed status epilepticus. This subject would not be eligible for treatment with Zonegran according 
to  the  final  agreed  SmPC.  It  is  agreed  that  the  other  two  deaths,  one  due  to  status  epilepticus  in  a 
subject receiving three AEDs and with a vagal stimulator in situ, and one in a female with a head injury 
are unlikely to be related to Zonegran. 
The SmPC has been amended with: 
-warnings in relation to the risk of decreased appetite and weight loss, 
-recommendations not to use zonegran in paediatric patients who are underweight or have a decrease 
apetite,  
-recommendations to monitor weight and to consider a dietary supplement or increased food intake in 
case of weight loss  
-recommendations to discontinue zonegran if substantial undesirable weight loss occurs 
Zonegran  
EMA/532724/2013

Additionally, the PIL has been amended to encourage parents or carers to monitor their child’s weight 
regularly and to return to their doctor in the event of failure to gain weight. 
Body weight is a parameter that can be relatively easily monitored over time and routinely performed 
in  paediatric  patients.  Therefore  parents  or  carers  should  be  able  to  monitor  their  child’s  weight 
regularly and report back to their physician if weight loss occurs.  
Therefore,  The  CHMP  concluded  that  that  the  risk  of  decreased  appetite  and  weight  loss  can  be 
controlled via the risk minimisation measures included in the product information. 
1.5.6.  Other Laboratory findings 
Liver function abnormalities 
No  liver  function  abnormalities  were  reported  in  Study  312.  In  the  pooled  analysis  liver  function 
abnormalities  were  reported  in  15  subjects  (3.8%),  9  subjects  (6.2%)  were  aged  6  through  11,  four 
(1.9%) aged 12 through 16 and two aged under-6 years. 
Five  patients  in  the  pooled  safety  database  had  markedly  abnormal  hepatobiliary  parameters  defined 
as NCI grade change from baseline >=2 on at least 2 consecutive post baseline visits or the last on-
treatment  post  baseline  visit  NCI  change  grade  from  baseline  >=2.  High  GGT  values  (>100;  while 
normal values are 0-33 IU/L) and high bilirubin were recorded in (some) of these patients. Two of the 
events  were  reported  as  AEs,  one  as  mild  and  one  as  moderate.  Some  were  considered  related  to 
study medication and all 5 events were not resolved during the study. 
Hepatocellular  damage  is  mentioned  as  a  risk  in  section  4.8  of  the  SPC  of  Zonegran.  Based  on 
these  results  it  is  recommended  to  add  a  warning  to  the  SPC  about  this  risk  with  a 
recommendation to monitor liver function in children and adolescents. 
Haematological abnormalities 
In  Study  312  three  subjects  (2.8%)  in  the  Zonisamide  arm  reported  had  haematological  TEAEs 
reported.  None  were  deemed  to  be  severe  or  serious  and  none  led  to  study  discontinuation.  In  the 
pooled analysis there were 9 reports (2.3%) of haematological TEAEs. All were considered to be mild 
or moderate and none led to discontinuation. 
1.5.7.  Safety in special populations 
Analysis of pooled data was provided by age-group but not by sex or race. 
No studies were carried out in paediatric subjects with renal or hepatic insufficiency. 
No  subjects  became  pregnant  in  Study  312.  Three  subjects  in  the  pooled  analysis  became  pregnant 
and  were  discontinued  from  the  study  drug.  No  information  was  provided  on  the  outcomes  of 
pregnancy in these subjects. 
1.5.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Concomitant  AEDs  at  baseline  included  carbamazepine,  lamotrigine,  levetiracetam,  topiramate,  and 
valproic acid. The incidence of all TEAEs and a number of specific TEAEs were reported at a higher rate 
in  the  topiramate  group  compared  with  the  other  baseline  AEDs.  The  incidences  of  any  TEAE  with 
topiramate  was  92%  compared  to  83.3%  with  lamotrigine,  78.0%)  with  levetiracetam,  76.7%  with 
valproic  acid,  and  69.3%  with  carbamazepine.  Specific  TEAEs  which  had  higher  incidence  in  the 
Zonegran  
EMA/532724/2013  
Page 48/64
 
 
 
 
 
 
topiramate  group  included  Upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  32.0%  with  topiramate  compared  with 
9.3%  to  16.7%  with  other  baseline  AEDs;  somnolence,  30.0%  compared  with  9.3%  to  18.3%, 
respectively; pyrexia, 30.0% compared with 6.7% to 19.8%, respectively; sinusitis, 20.0% compared 
with  5.3%  to  7.5%,  respectively;  fatigue,  20.0%  compared  with  5.1%  to  14.2%,  respectively;  nasal 
congestion,  18.0%  compared  with  4.0%  to  8.5%,  respectively;  rhinorrhea,  14.0%  compared  with 
1.3%  to  8.5%,  respectively;  and  abdominal  pain  upper,  12.0%  compared  with  1.3%  to  8.3%, 
respectively. 
The  SPC  of  Zonegran  indicates  that  it  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  being  treated 
concomitantly with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate, as there are insufficient data to 
rule out a pharmacodynamic interaction. 
An  additional  warning  that  Zonegran  should  not  be  with  other  carbonic  anhydrase  inhibitors  (e.g. 
topiramate and acetazolamide) in the paediatric population has been added to Section 4.4 and 4.5 of 
the SmPC. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuation  rates  were  low  in  Study  312  (Zonisamide  0.9%  v  3%  placebo  group).  All  events 
occurred  during  the  titration  period.  The  Zonisamide  subject  had  an  allergic  dermatitis  which  led  to 
discontinuation. 
Pooled data 
TEAES  leading  to  discontinuation  were  reported  for  41  patients  (10.3%)  in  the  Zonisamide  group  of 
whom  13  (8.9%)  were  aged  6  through  11  years  and  22  subjects  (10.6%)  were  aged  12  through  16 
years (the remainder were aged under six). 
Zonegran  
EMA/532724/2013  
Page 49/64
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall,  the most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation in  the  Zonisamide  group  were 
lethargy and fatigue (four subjects (1.0%) each), and decreased appetite, gamma-glutamyltransferase 
(GGT)  increased,  irritability,  confusional  state,  and  unintended  pregnancy  (three  subjects  [<1%] 
each). 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  in  the  Zonisamide  group  in  the  6 
through 11 years group were GGT increased (3 subjects [2.1%]), AST increased, fatigue, and lethargy 
(2 subjects [1.4%] each). 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  in  the  Zonisamide  group  in  the  12 
through  16  years  group  were  confusional  state  and  unintended  pregnancy  (three  subjects  [1.4%] 
each), aphasia, aggression, dizziness, decreased appetite, fatigue, insomnia, irritability, and rash (two 
subjects [< 1%] each).  Altogether, the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation in the paediatrics 
population of 10.3% is lower than that found in the adult Zonegran add-on studies (24.6%). 
1.5.9.  Conclusion on clinical safety 
The  safety  issues  that  emerged  with  Zonegran  show  that  although  in  general  the  safety  profile  is 
similar  to  that  in  adults,  there  are  several  important  issues  that  raise  important  concerns  since  they 
may have greater implications in the paediatric population.  
Overall, the number of patients that died during the studies is of concern, though similar to mortality 
rates  in  subjects  receiving  other  anti-epileptic  drugs:  (14.6  per  1000  person-years  vs.  15.7-15.9  per 
1000 person-years) (Messenheimer 2000, Sillanpaa 2010) 
Nevertheless,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  there  should  be  intensive  monitoring  of  mortality  as  well  as  the 
events  that  preceded  mortality  in  the  cases  described  (including  weight  loss,  dehydration  and  loss  of 
efficacy).  
One of the patients whose death was considered related to Zonegran was a subject underweight who 
continued  to  lose  weight  over  a  three  month  period,  stopped  taking  his  AEDs  and  developed  status 
epilepticus.  This  subject  would  not  be  eligible  for  treatment  with  Zonegran  according  to  the  current 
proposed  Product  Information  and  warnings  regarding  weight  loss,  advice  to  monitor  growth  and  to 
discontinue treatment in the event of failure to gain weight should mitigate the risks in the paediatric 
population. Although data is limited, no evidence for a consistent delay in bone maturation in subjects 
with weight loss was seen.  
Cases of decreased sweating and elevated body temperature have been reported mainly in paediatric 
patients.  Heat  stroke  requiring  hospital  treatment  was  diagnosed  in  some  cases  and  heat  stroke 
requiring  hospital  treatment  and  leading  to  death  has  been  reported.  Most  reports  occurred  during 
periods of warm weather. This has been highlighted in the Product Information, requesting physicians 
to discuss with patients and their carers the potential seriousness of heatstroke, situations in which it 
might arise, as well as action to take in the event of any signs or symptoms.  
The  risk  of  induced  metabolic  acidosis,  which  appears  to  be  more  frequent  and  severe  in  paediatric 
patients, has been highlighted in the Product Information with a request to monitor serum bicarbonate 
levels.  
Warnings  regarding  the  unknown  long-term  effects  of  all  these  events  on  growth  and  development 
have also been included. 
The  MAH  will  perform  intensive  monitoring,  and  a  drug-utilization  study,  to  provide  evidence  of  the 
effectiveness  of  SmPC  warnings  on  concomitant  use  of  carbonic  anhydrase  inhibitors  and 
Zonegran

anticholinergic  drugs,  monitoring  of  serum  bicarbonate  levels  as  well  as  weight  and  height  in  the 
paediatric population and use in children below 20 kg.  
1.6.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considers that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements and provides adequate evidence that the applicant has the services of a qualified person 
responsible for pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the notification of any adverse 
reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country. 
1.7.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated Risk Management Plan within this variation procedure which included a 
risk minimisation plan.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1 
Therapeutic indications 
Zonegran is indicated as:  
  monotherapy in the treatment of partial seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in adults with newly 
 
diagnosed epilepsy (see section 5.1); 
adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in adultadults, 
adolescents and children aged 6 years and above. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Paediatric population (aged 6 years and above) 
Dosage escalation and maintenance 
Zonegran must be added to existing therapy for paediatric patients aged 6 years and above. The dose should be 
titrated on the basis of clinical effect. Recommended escalation and maintenance doses are given in Table 2. Some 
patients, especially those not taking CYP3A4-inducing agents, may respond to lower doses. 
Physicians should draw the attention of paediatric patients and their parents/carers to the Patient Alert Box (in the 
package leaflet) on preventing heatstroke (see section 4.4: Paediatric Population).

To ensure a therapeutic dose is maintained the weight of a child should be monitored and the dose reviewed 
as weight changes occur up to a weight of 55kg.  The dose regime is 6-8mg/kg/day up to a maximum dose of 
500 mg/day.  
The safety and efficacy of Zonegran in children aged below 6 years or those below 20 kg have not yet been 
established.  
There are limited data from clinical studies in patients with a body weight of less than 20 kg. Therefore children 
aged 6 years and above and with a body weight less than 20 kg should be treated with caution. 
Withdrawal 
When Zonegran treatment is to be discontinued, it should be withdrawn gradually (see section 4.4). In clinical 
studies of paediatric patients, down-titration was completed by dose reductions at weekly intervals in increments of 
about 2 mg/kg (i.e. in accordance with the schedule in Tablet 3).

4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Kidney stones 
SomeKidney stones have occurred in patients treated, especially those with zonisamide.  Zonegran should be used 
with caution in patients who have risk factors fora predisposition to nephrolithiasis, including prior stone formation, 
a family history of nephrolithiasis and hypercalcuria.  Such patients may be at increased risk for renal stone 
formation and associated signs and symptoms such as renal colic, renal pain or flank pain. Nephrolithiasis may lead 
to chronic kidney damage. Risk factors for nephrolithiasis include prior stone formation, a family history of 
nephrolithiasis and hypercalciuria.  None of these risk factors can reliably predict stone formation during zonisamide 
treatment.  In addition, patients taking other medications associated with nephrolithiasis may be at increased risk.  
Increasing fluid intake and urine output may help reduce the risk of stone formation, particularly in those with 
predisposing risk factors.   
… 
Zonegran should be used with caution in adult patients being treated concomitantly with carbonic anhydrase 
inhibitors such as topiramate or acetazolamide, as there are insufficient data to rule out a pharmacodynamic 
interaction (see also section 4.4 Paediatric Population and section 4.5). 
Heat stroke 
Cases of decreased sweating and elevated body temperature have been reported mainly in paediatric patients (see 
section 4.4 Paediatric Population for full warning).  Caution should be used in adults.  Heat stroke requiring hospital 
treatment was diagnosed in some cases.  Most reports occurred during periods of warm weather.  Patients or their 
carers must be warned to take care to maintain hydration and avoid exposure to excessive temperatures.  Caution 
should be used when Zonegran is prescribed with other medicinal products that predispose patients to heat related 
disorders; these include carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and medicinal products with anticholinergic activity. (see also 
section 4.4 Paediatric Population) 
…. 
Body- weight 
There is limited data from clinical studies in patients with a body weight of less than 40 kg. Therefore these patients 
should be treated with caution. 
Zonegran may cause weight loss.  A dietary supplement or increased food intake may be considered if the patient is 
losing weight or is underweight whilst on this medication. If substantial undesirable weight loss occurs, 
discontinuation of Zonegran should be considered.  Weight loss is potentially more serious in children (see section 
4.4. Paediatric Population). 
Paediatric Population 
The warnings and precautions mentioned above are also applicable to adolescent and paediatric patients.  The 
warnings and precautions mentioned below are more relevant to paediatric and adolescent patients. 
Heat stroke and dehydration 
Preventing overheating and dehydration in children 
Zonegran can cause children to sweat less and overheat and if the child is not treated this can lead to brain 
damage and death. Children are most at risk especially in hot weather.  
When a child is taking Zonegran: 
• 
• 
The child should stay cool especially in hot weather  
The child must avoid  heavy exercise especially when the weather is hot

The child must drink plenty of cold water   
The child must not take any of these medicines: 
• 
• 
carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (like topiramate and acetazolamide), and anticholinergic agents (like 
clomipramine, hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine, haloperidol, imipramine and oxybutynin).   
IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING OCCUR, THE CHILD NEEDS URGENT MEDICAL ATTENTION: 
The skin feels very hot with little or no sweating, or the child becomes confused or has muscle cramps, or the 
child’s heartbeat or breathing become rapid.   
(cid:31) 
(cid:31) 
(cid:31) 
Take the child to a cool, shaded place  
Keep the child's skin cool with water 
Give the child cold water to drink 
Cases of decreased sweating and elevated body temperature have been reported mainly in paediatric patients.  
Heat stroke requiring hospital treatment was diagnosed in some cases.  Heat stroke requiring hospital treatment 
and leading to death has been reported.  Most reports occurred during periods of warm weather.  Physicians should 
discuss with patients and their carers the potential seriousness of heatstroke, situations in which it might arise, as 
well as action to take in the event of any signs or symptoms.  Patients or their carers must be warned to take care 
to maintain hydration and avoid exposure to excessive temperatures and strenuous physical exercise depending on 
the condition of the patient.  Prescribers should draw the attention of paediatric patients and their parent/carers to 
the advice in the Packaging Leaflet on preventingheatstroke and overheating in children as provided.  In the event 
of signs or symptoms of dehydration, oligohydrosis, or elevated body temperature, discontinuation of Zonegran 
should be considered. 
Zonegran should not be used as co-medication in paediatric patients with other medicinal products that predispose 
patients to heat related disorders; these include carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and medicinal products with 
anticholinergic activity. 
Body weight 
Weight loss leading to deterioration of general condition and failure to take anti-epilepsy medication has been 
related to a fatal outcome (see section 4.8).  Zonegran is not recommended for paediatric patients who are 
underweight (definition in accordance with the WHO age adjusted BMI categories) or have a decreased appetite. 
The incidence of decreased body weight is consistent across age groups (see section 4.8); however, given the 
potential seriousness of weight loss in children, weight should be monitored in this population.  A dietary 
supplement or increased food intake should be considered if the patient is failing to gain weight in accordance with 
growth charts, otherwise Zonegran should be discontinued.  
There are limited data from clinical studies in patients with a body weight of less than 20 kg. Therefore children 
aged 6 years and above with a body weight of less than 20 kg should be treated with caution.  The long term effect 
of weight loss in the paediatric population on growth and development is unknown. 
Metabolic acidosis 
The risk of zonisamide induced metabolic acidosis appears to be more frequent and severe in paediatric and 
adolescent patients. Appropriate evaluation and monitoring of serum bicarbonate levels should be carried out in this 
population (see section 4.4 - Metabolic acidosis for full warning; see section 4.8 for incidence of low bicarbonate).  
The long term effect of low bicarbonate levels on growth and development is unknown.  
Zonegran should not be used as co-medication in paediatric patients with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such 
as topiramate and acetazolamide (see section 4.5). 
Kidney stones 
Kidney stones have occurred in paediatric patients (see section 4.4 Kidney stones for full warning).  
Some patients, especially those with a predisposition to nephrolithiasis, may be at increased risk for renal stone 
formation and associated signs and symptoms such as renal colic, renal pain or flank pain. Nephrolithiasis may lead 
to chronic kidney damage.  Risk factors for nephrolithiasis include prior stone formation, a family history of 
nephrolithiasis and hypercalciuria.  None of these risk factors can reliably predict stone formation during zonisamide 
treatment. 
Increasing fluid intake and urine output may help reduce the risk of stone formation, particularly in those with 
predisposing risk factors.  Renal ultrasound should be performed at the discretion of the physician.  In the event 
kidney stones are detected, Zonegran should be discontinued. 
Hepatic dysfunction 
Increased levels of hepatobiliary parameters such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferease 
(AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and bilirubin have occurred in paediatric and adolescent patients, without 
any consistent pattern in the observations of values above the upper limit of normal. Nevertheless, if a hepatic 
event is suspected, liver function should be evaluated and discontinuation of Zonegran should be considered. 
Cognition

Cognitive impairment in patients affected by epilepsy has been associated with the underlying pathology and/or the 
administration of anti-epileptic treatment.  In a zonisamide placebo-controlled study conducted in paediatric and 
adolescent patients, the proportion of patients with impaired cognition was numerically greater in the zonisamide 
group compared with the placebo group.    
Excipients 
Zonegran 100 mg hard capsules contain a yellow colour called sunset yellow FCF (E110), and a red colour called 
allura red AC (E129), which may cause allergic reactions. 
Zonegran orodispersible tablets contain a sweetener called aspartame (E951), which is a source of phenylalanine 
and may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors 
Zonegran should be used with caution in adult patients treated concomitantly with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors 
such as topiramate and acetazolamide, as there are insufficient data to rule out a possible pharmacodynamic 
interaction t (see section 4.4). 
Zonegran should not be used as co-medication in paediatric patients with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such 
as topiramate and acetazolamide (see section 4.4 Paediatric Population). 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6 
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Fertility 
There are no clinical data available on the effects of zonisamide on human fertility. Studies in animals have shown 
changes in fertility parameters (see section 5.3). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Paediatric Population 
The adverse event profile of zonisamide in paediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years in placebo-controlled clinical 
studies was consistent with that of adults.  Among 465 subjects in the paediatric safety database (including a 
further 67 subjects from the extension phase of the controlled clinical trial) there were 7 deaths (1.5%; 14.6/1000 
person-years): 2 cases of status epilepticus, of which one was related to severe weight loss (10% within 3 months) 
in an underweight subject and subsequent failure to take medication; 1 case of head injury/haematoma, and 
4 deaths in subjects with pre-existing functional neurological deficits for various causes (2 cases of pneumonia-
induced sepsis/organ failure, 1 SUDEP and 1 head injury).  A total of 70.4% of paediatric subjects who received 
ZNS in the controlled study or its open label extension had at least one treatment-emergent bicarbonate 
measurement below 22 mmol/L. The duration of low bicarbonate measurements was also long (median 188 days).  
A pooled analysis of safety data on  420  paediatric subjects (183 subjects aged 6 to 11 years, and 237 subjects 
aged 12 to 16 years with a mean duration of exposure of approximately 12 months) has shown a relatively higher 
reporting frequency of pneumonia, dehydration, decreased sweating, abnormal liver function tests, otitis media, 
pharyngitis, sinusitis and upper respiratory tract infection, cough, epistaxis and rhinitis, abdominal pain, vomiting, 
rash and eczema, and fever compared to the adult population (particularly in subjects aged below 12 years) and, at 
a low incidence, amnesia, creatinine increased, lymphadenopathy, and thrombocytopenia.  The incidence of a 
decrease in body weight of 10% or more was 10.7% (see section 4.4). In some cases of weight decrease there was 
a delay in transition to the next Tanner stage and in bone maturation. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued 
monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any 
suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Paediatric Population 
Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in adolescent and 
paediatric patients (aged 6 years and above) 
In paediatric patients (aged 6 years and above), efficacy has been demonstrated with zonisamide in a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study, which included 207 subjects and had a treatment duration of up to 24 weeks.  A 50% or 
Zonegran  
EMA/532724/2013  
Page 58/64
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
greater reduction from baseline in seizure frequency during the 12-week stable dose period was seen in 50% of the 
zonisamide-treated subjects and 31% of the patients on placebo.   
Specific safety issues that were encountered in the paediatric studies were: decreased appetite and weight loss, 
decreased bicarbonate levels, increased risk of kidney stones and dehydration. All these effects and specifically 
weight loss may have deleterious implications for growth and development, and may lead to general deterioration 
of health. Altogether, data on effects on long-term growth and development are limited. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Linearity / non-linearity 
Zonisamide exposure increases with time until steady state is achieved by approximately 8 weeks.  When 
comparing the same dose level, subjects of higher total body weight appear to have lower steady-state serum 
concentrations, but this effect appears to be relatively modest.  Age ( 12 years) and gender, after adjustment for 
body weight effects, have no apparent effect on zonisamide exposure in epileptic patients during steady-state 
dosing.  There is no need for dose adjustment with any of the AEDs including CYP3A4 inducers. 
Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship 
Zonisamide lowers the 28-day average seizure frequency and the decrease is proportional (log-linear) to 
zonisamide average concentration.   
Other characteristics 
No clear Zonegran dose-concentration-response relationship has been defined.  When comparing the same dose 
level, subjects of higher total body weight appear to have lower steady-state serum concentrations, but this effect 
appears to be relatively modest.  Age ( 12 years) and gender, after adjustment for body weight effects, have no 
apparent effect on zonisamide exposure in epileptic patients during steady-state dosing. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In a repeated-dose oral toxicity study in juvenile rats, at exposure levels similar to those observed in paediatric 
patients at the maximum recommended dose, decreases in body weight and changes in renal histopathology and 
clinical pathology parameters and behavioural changes were observed.  Changes in renal histopathology and clinical 
pathology parameters were considered to be related to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by zonisamide.  The effects at 
this dose level were reversible during the recovery period. At a higher dose level (2-3-fold systemic exposure 
compared to therapeutic exposure) renal histopathological effects were more severe and only partially reversible. 
Most adverse effects observed in the juvenile rats were similar to those seen in the repeated-dose toxicity studies of 
zonisamide in adult rats, but renal tubular hyaline droplets and transitional hyperplasia were observed in the 
juvenile study only.  At this higher dose level, juvenile rats showed a decrease in growth, learning, and 
developmental parameters.  These effects were considered likely related to the decreased body weight and 
exaggerated pharmacologic effects of zonisamide at the maximum tolerated dose. 
In rats, decreased numbers of corpora lutea and implantation sites were observed at exposure levels equivalent to 
the maximum therapeutic dose in humans; irregular oestrus cycles and a decreased number of live foetuses were 
observed at exposure levels three times higher. 
6.6 
Special precautions for disposal  
No special requirements for disposal. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template, which 
were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
A  user  consultation  was  not  conducted.  The  PIL  was  last  tested  in  April  2011  and  in  September 
2011.The MAH submitted a justification for not repeating the user consultation, which was considered 
acceptable. In both cases the MAH showed that the package leaflet met the criteria for readability as 
set  out  in  the  Guideline  on  the  readability  of  the  label  and  package  leaflet  of  medicinal  products  for 
human use.

2.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Zonegran  (zonisamide)  is  an  antiepileptic  medication  that is  currently indicated  as  mono  therapy  and 
as adjunctive therapy in partial seizures with or without secondary generalization in adult patients. 
This application seeks to extend this indication to include adjunctive therapy of partial seizures with or 
without secondary generalization in children and adolescents aged 6 years and above.  
In  support  of  this  indication,  the  applicant  submitted  a  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis,  a  PK/PD 
analysis and one pivotal efficacy and safety study in the child and adolescent population (6-17 years) 
with partial onset seizures and its open label 1 year extension study. Evidence on safety is also based 
on additional studies in which children and adolescents were included.  
The  design  of  the  pivotal  study  was  broadly  in  line  with  the  Guideline  on  Clinical  Investigation  of 
Medicinal  Products  in  the  Treatment  of  Epileptic  Disorders.  Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  appear  to 
have  been  appropriate  and  included  subjects  with  inadequately  controlled partial  seizures  in  the  age-
group  for  which  the  indication  is  sought.  The  choice  of  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  (responder 
rates and decrease in seizure frequency) was appropriate. 
The pivotal study consisted of a 4-8 weeks screening period, an 8 week titration period and a 12 weeks 
maintenance  period.  Children  and  adolescents  with  at  least  4  partial  seizures  per  month  and  on  a 
stable regimen of 1 or 2 AEDs for at least 1 month before the start of the study were included. They 
were randomized to receive either Zonegran at a maintenance dose of 8 mg/kg/day or placebo.  The 
primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  defined  as  the  percentage  of  responders,  defined  as  ≥  50%  reduction 
from baseline in seizure frequency during the maintenance period. 
A  total  of  107  patients  were  randomized  to  Zonegran  and  100  to  placebo.  These  patients  were  all 
included  in  the  ITT  analysis.  A  total  of  13%  and  10%  discontinued  from  the  study  in  the  active  and 
placebo arms, respectively.  
Efficacy  results  from  the  pivotal  study  are  supportive  of  short-term  efficacy:  50%  responders  (≥50% 
reduction  in  seizure  frequency  from  baseline)  in  the  Zonegran  arm  compared  to  31%  in  the  placebo 
arm  (p=0.0044),  resulting  in  a  NNT  of  5.  Efficacy  results  in  the  paediatric  study  are  consistent  with 
those in the adult study (study 302) where % responders in the 500mg group was 44% compared to 
20% in placebo. 
This  analysis  was  performed  after  removing  site  and  weight  group  as  stratifying  variables.    Upon 
request  from  CHMP  an  additional  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  analysis  including  these  strata  has  been  
provided.  The  result  from  this  analysis  are  still  statistically  significant,  however  with  a  p  value  of 
0.0360.  . The secondary efficacy endpoint demonstrated a likewise worthwhile treatment effect on the 
median  percentage  reduction  from  baseline  in  seizure  frequency  (50%  in  Zonegran  vs.  25%  in 
placebo). 
The effect was consistent in the younger (6-11) and older age groups (12-17) and in patients receiving 
different  concomitant  AEDs.  The  differences  in  the  effect  size  across  different  types  of  seizures  are 
considered a chance finding and not to be of clinical significance.   
Compared  to  other  AED  which  are  already  indicated  for  adjunctive  therapy  in  children  with  partial 
seizure, the efficacy of Zonegran is in the same order of magnitude. In terms of % responders (>50% 
reduction in seizure frequency) a study in lamotrigine in a similarly defined sample (Duchowny et al., 
1999)3 showed  42%  responders  in  the  lamotrigine  arm  compared  to  16%  in  placebo,  and  a  study  in  
3 Duchowny et al (1999). A placebo controlled trial of lamotrigine add-n therapy for partial seizures in children. Neurology,

Topiramate (cited in French et al., 2004)4 showed 39% responders compared to 20% in the topiramate 
and  placebo  arms,  respectively.  Another  study  which  is  also  cited  by  French  et  al.  (2004)  of 
oxcarbazepine achieved 41% response in the active arms compared to 22% in placebo and a study of 
Levetiracepam  described  in  the  SPC  of  this  product  showed  response  rates  of  45%  vs.  20%  in  the 
active arm compared to placebo, respectively. Hence all these studies achieved a 20%-25% difference 
between active arm and placebo in percent responders, which is consistent with the difference that was 
obtained for Zonegran.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Uncertainties  were  raised  regarding  the  lack  of  a  dose  range  initially  proposed  for  the  paediatric 
population  as  in  the  adult  population.  PK  modelling  suggested  an  overlap  in  exposure  between  the 
8mg/kg  and  6mg/kg  dose  in  the  paediatric  population,  which  raised  the  question  as  to  whether  a 
6mg/kg dose might be as equally efficacious with the additional benefit of a possible lower frequency 
of  adverse  events.  The  applicant  therefore  proposed  a  dose  range  of  6  to  8  mg/kg  for  those  with  a 
weight < 55kg and a dose range of 300 to 500mg for those with a weight above 55kg.  
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile is in general similar to that in adults. However, there are several important identified 
risks that may have greater implications in the paediatric population.   
In  the  pooled  safety  database,  seven  patients  (1.5%)  who  were  treated  with  Zonegran  had  a  TEAE 
resulting in death. The number of deaths in the studies were a reason for concern. Two of these death 
were  attributed  to  Zonegran  by  the  investigator.  In  a  further  case  of  death  attributed  to  SUDEP  a 
relationship  could  neither  be  confirmed  or  excluded.  The  remaining  four  deaths  are  thought  to  be 
unlikely to be related to Zonegran.  
The mortality rates observed in this population were however similar to those observed in a paediatric 
population exposed to lamotrigine (Messenheimer et al). In addition death rates have been noted to be 
higher  in  those  with  functional  neurological  impairment/remote  symptomatic  epilepsy.  This  may  be  a 
partial explanation for the high death rates seen with Zonegran (Camfield). 
Decreased appetite and weight loss are reasons for concern, as this might have an impact on general 
health,  immunity  and  increased  vulnerability  to  infection.  In  addition,  these  AEs  may  have  effects  on 
growth and development and sexual maturation. Likewise, decreases in bicarbonate levels, which were 
observed  very  frequently  and  for  a  long  duration  may  also  have  adverse  effects  on  growth  and 
maturation,  although  a  scarcity  of  data  in  this  respect  did  not  allow  this  conclusion  to  be  drawn  with 
certainty.  Cases  of  delay  in  bone  maturation  and  delay  in  transition  to  next  Tanner  stage  have  been 
observed.  No  data  from  longer  than  one  year  exposure  is  available,  so  the  long  term  impact  of 
Zonegran treatment remains unknown. 
A  clear  correlation  with  time  since  start  of  treatment  and  time  of  onset  of  AEs  has  not  been 
established, but the data showed that some AEs as vomiting, diarrhoea, dehydration can be persistent. 
Persistent  vomiting  and  diarrhoea  is  of  concern  not  only  because  it  leads  to  weight  loss  and 
dehydration, but also because it may reduce treatment compliance. 
Metabolic  acidosis  has  not  been  reported  in  the  safety  database.  Renal  function  does  not  seem  to  be 
affected  in  terms  of  concentration  capacity,  but  proteinuria  and  haematuria  have  been  observed 
indicating vulnerability of the urinary system in these patients. There seemed to be an increased risk of 
kidney stones as well, which is of concern since this may lead to renal damage.   
The  implication  of  somnolence  for  educational  attainment  is  a  concern.  The  additional  results  of  the 
cognitive  assessment  presented  did  not  allow  further  judgement  to  which  extent  the  treatment 
contributed to cognitive and performance impairment in treated subjects. This remains an uncertainty.

Compared  to  other  AEDs  that  are  registered  for  the  same  indication  in  paediatric  patients  (e.g. 
oxcarbazepine,  lamotrigine),  dermatologic  effects  and  sedation  played  less  of  a  role  in  the  safety 
profile of Zonegran.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The effect on renal function is not completely clear since concentration capacity was not affected, but a 
proportion  of  the  subjects  had  haematuria  and  proteinuria,  possibly  indicating  vulnerability  of  the 
urinary system in these patients. In addition the increased risk for kidney stones could lead to chronic 
renal damage in the long term.  
The long term effect of decreases in bicarbonate levels (which were observed very frequently and for a 
long duration) on long term growth and development are not known although this is subject to specific 
risk minimisation measures and it is noted that there were no reports of metabolic acidosis. 
Other concerns regarding long-term safety pertain to the effects of loss of appetite and loss in weight 
on nutritional status and general condition, in addition to effect on growth and maturation.  
In  addition  there  are  uncertainties  regarding  the  impact  of  treatment  with  Zonegran  on  educational 
attainment.  
Balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
Altogether,  the  efficacy  of  Zonegran  has  been  demonstrated  in  a  group  of  children  and  adolescents 
aged 6-17 with % responders of 50% in the Zonegran arm compared to 31% in placebo. The effect in 
the  paediatric  study  is  consistent  with  that  found  in  adults  and  with  that  of  other  AED  in  paediatric 
samples.  
The  sought  indication  extension  is  to  include  adjunctive  therapy  of  partial  seizures  with  or  without 
secondary  generalization  in  children  and  adolescents  aged  6  years  and  above.  In  general  this  is 
considered a treatment resistant patient population which does not respond sufficiently to 1 or 2 other 
AEDs,  hence  adjunctive  therapy  should  provide  additional  efficacy  in  terms  of  further  reduction  of 
seizure frequency.  
The results from the presented evidence in this dossier indicate that adjunctive therapy with Zonegran 
can  induce  a  further  reduction  in  seizures,  as  indicated  by  the  proportion  of  responders  in  the 
Zonegran  arm  (50%)  as  compared  to  placebo  (31%).  This  results  in  a  NNT  of  5.  The    efficacy  of 
Zonegran  is  in  the  same  order  of  magnitude  as    that  of  other  AEDs  which  are  already  indicated  for 
adjunctive  therapy  in  children  with  partial  seizures  (42%  vs  16%  in    lamotrigine;  39%  vs  20%  in 
topiramate;  41%  vs  22%  oxcarbamazepine;    45%  vs.  20%  in  levetiracetam,  for  active  arm  vs. 
placebo,  respectively).  This  difference  of  about  20%-25%  between  active  treatment  and  placebo  in 
percent responders, was also observed for Zonegran, however with a higher placebo response. 
Against  these  efficacy  results,  the  safety  issues  that  emerged  with  Zonegran  show  that  although  the 
safety profile is similar to that in adults, there are important issues that that have different implication 
in children which need to be monitored.  
Mortality rates observed are of concern, although they are similar to those seen in other paediatric 
trials with other AED, and some of the deaths occurred in subjects with functional neurological 
impairment, a group, noted to have a higher risk of death, often related to their underlying condition 
rather than epilepsy. Nevertheless, as part of the routine pharmacovigilance activities there should be 
intensive monitoring of fatalities in the paediatric population as well as the events that preceded such 
events in the cases described (including weight loss, dehydration and loss of efficacy), i.e. these safety 
concerns should be closely followed up and reviewed as adverse events of special interest and should 
be discussed in detail within future PSURs.

The long-term effects of decreased appetite and weight loss and long-term effects of bicarbonate loss 
on  nutritional  status  and  general  condition  apart  from  growth  and  development  need  to  be  closely 
monitored. Furthermore, proteinuria and haematuria as well as an increased risk of kidney stones have 
been observed indicating vulnerability of the urinary system, which is of concern since this may lead to 
renal damage over time.  
The CHMP concluded that the safety issues identified could be minimised through additional warnings 
in the SmPC, highlighting these risks, and requesting physicians, parents and carers to monitor these 
events.  The  MAH  will  perform  a  drug-utilization  study,  to  provide  evidence  of  the  effectiveness  of 
SmPC  warnings  on  concomitant  use  of  carbonic  anhydrase  inhibitors  and  anticholinergic  drugs, 
monitoring  of  serum  bicarbonate  levels  as  well  as  weight  and  height  in  the  paediatric  population  and 
use in children below 20 kg. 
Despite  the  availability  of  a  number  of  AEDs  that  are  approved  for  paediatric  use,  not  all  patients 
achieve  satisfactory  seizure  control.  The  benefit  risk  balance  of  adding  Zonegran  to  the  treatment 
arsenal  for  adjunctive  therapy  to  one  or  two  other  AEDs  in  reducing  seizures  in  the  target  paediatric 
population is deemed to be positive. 
Description of post-authorisation measures 
1.  The applicant is recommended to submit a valid algae growth inhibition test and a sediment 
organism toxicity test 
2.  A drug utilisation study will be performed to measure the effectiveness of risk minimisation 
measures in the paediatric population as described in the RMP. 
3.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable by a 
majority of 25 out of 29 votes and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing 
Authorisation, concerning the following change: 
Variations requested 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Extension of the indication “adjunctive treatment of partial seizures with or without secondary 
generalisation” to include adolescents and children aged 6 years and above. 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 6.6 of the SmPC have

Divergent Positions 
The undersigned members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s opinion recommending the adoption 
of the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the extension of the indication 
“adjunctive  treatment  of  partial  seizures  with  or  without  secondary  generalisation”  to  include 
adolescents and children aged 6 years and above 
The reasons for the divergent opinion were as follows: 
The  Benefit-Risk  balance  of  Zonegran  in  the  treatment  of  paediatric  patients  is  considered 
unfavourable.  The  benefit  of  adding  Zonegran  to  one  or  two  other  antiepileptic  drugs  on  adjunctive 
treatment of partial seizures in the target paediatric population does not outweigh the increased risk of 
mortality,  kidney  damage  and  long  term  effects  of  weight  loss  and  decreased  appetite,  on  the 
nutritional status, growth and development.

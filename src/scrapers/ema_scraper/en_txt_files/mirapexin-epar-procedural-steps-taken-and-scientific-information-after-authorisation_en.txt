dose is missed, Sifrol prolonged-release tablets should be

After 12 hours, the missed dose should be left out and the

EMEA/H/C/133,134/X/51,59, the CHMP requested that the 
MAH should performs an in depth evaluation of hOCT2 
inhibitors which may potentially interfere with the active 
tubular secretion of pramipexole. Following the assessment 
of this evaluation the CHMP recommended that section 4.5 
of the SPC should be amended to include  zidovudine, 
cisplatin, quinine, and procainamide.  
Furthermore, based on the data provided in PSUR No. 13 a 
revision of the Product Information was proposed by the 
MAH, including the identification of new side effects 
(hiccups, diplopia and decreased appetite), an adaptation 
to the revised MedDRA terminology and changes of several 
frequency categories. The CHMP considered the proposed 
changes to be in line with the assessment of PSUR 13 and 
accepted the proposed changes.

Syndrome to evaluate augmentation and rebound, the 
CHMP concluded that augmentation is seen, but is not 
related to treatment with pramipexol. Rebound after abrupt 
discontinuation is seen in about 10% of patients. The CHMP 
also concluded that another important issue with 
pramipexol in RLS is low efficacy (although better then 
placebo). Based on these conclusions the CHMP 
recommended an update of the SPC for the immediate 
release formulations for which RLS is indicated. In addition, 
the details of the local representatives for Bulgaria, 
Romania, Estonia and Lithuania in the package leaflet were 
updated for all presentations.

Based on an analysis of the data provided, 'compulsive

included on the association with somnolence and episodes 
of sudden sleep onset, particularly in patients with 
Parkinson’s disease, that sudden onset of sleep during daily 
activities, in some cases without awareness or warning 
signs, has been reported uncommonly and that patients 
must be informed of this and advised to exercise caution 
while driving or operating machines during treatment with 
Mirapexin. Patients who have experienced somnolence 
and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from 
driving or operating machines and that a reduction of 
dosage or termination of therapy may be considered.  
The CHMP was of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately demonstrated and therefore considered by 
consensus that the benefit/risk profile of Mirapexin 
continues to be favourable for the indication “Mirapexin 
tablets are indicated for treatment of the signs and

Extension of Indication 
26/07/2001 
21/10/2001 
SmPC and PL 
The indication was extended to include treatment of early 
Parkinson's disease. In early PD, pramipexole delays the 
onset of late motor complications compared to levodopa. In 
contrast, the average improvement of motor symptoms is 
smaller with pramipexole than with levodopa. However, in 
47% of pramipexole patients the control of motor 
symptoms is still considered sufficient without 
supplementary levodopa (compared to 61% in the levodopa 
group). The safety profile of pramipexole differed from that 
of levodopa (oedema and somnolence being significantly 
Page 25/27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
more frequent during pramipexole treatment whereas dry 
mouth, sweating, dyskinesia/wearing off and conjunctivitis 
being significantly more frequent during levodopa 
treatment) but it is not evident which safety profile is the 
more favourable one. The section 4.1 of the SPC was 
updated to extend the indication to the following: Mirapexin 
tablets are indicated for treatment of the signs and 
symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, alone (without 
levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i.e. over the 
course of the disease, through to late stages when the 
effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and 
fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or 
"on off" fluctuations). Information was added to section 4.2 
of the SPC regarding tapering off, as a slow tapering off 
would intuitively decrease the risk of NMS. 
In a post marketing interaction study with pramipexole and 
L-dopa reasonable reassurance was provided that 
pramipexole did not have any clinically relevant effect on 
the pharmacokinetics of levodopa in males and females. 
Consequently the respective warnings in section 4.5 of the 
SPC were removed. In section 5.1 of the SPC was updated 
to include information on that in a controlled double blind 
clinical trial of 2-year duration, initial treatment with 
pramipexole significantly delayed the onset of motor 
complications, and reduced their occurrence compared to 
initial treatment with levodopa. Thi

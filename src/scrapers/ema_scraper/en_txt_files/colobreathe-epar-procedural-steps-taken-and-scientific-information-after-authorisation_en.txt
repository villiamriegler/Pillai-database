1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Colistimethate Sodium for Inhalation (Colobreathe 125mg) 
was conducted in Adult, Adolescent and Paediatric Cystic 
Fibrosis Subjects with Chronic Pulmonary Infection with 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  
The primary objective was to assess the magnitude of 
systemic exposure to colistimethate and its active 
breakdown products after repeat dosing with Colobreathe in 
adult, adolescent, and paediatric subjects with cystic 
fibrosis (CF).   
The results of this study showed minimal absorption of 
colistin and colistimethate after inhalation of Colobreathe.  
A validated LC-MS/S method was used to measure the 
concentration of colistin and colistimethate was calculated 
indirectly through colistin measurements.  
The obtained values were lower that what has been

A high concentration of total CMS and total free colistin 
were observed in sputum for all subjects and a minimal 
amount of colistin was found in urine.    
Appropriate statements are introduced in the Product 
Information, also expressing caution with concomitant use 
of other colistimethate formulations agents since data are 
missing on possible additive effects.  Caution has to be 
applied with use of Colobreathe with parenteral or 
nebulised treatment with colistimethate sodium and with 
nephrotoxic or neurotoxic agents.   
The benefit/risk balance of Colobreathe is considered to

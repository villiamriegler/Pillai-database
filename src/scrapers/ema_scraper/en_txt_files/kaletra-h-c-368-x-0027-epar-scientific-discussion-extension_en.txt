INTRODUCTION 
This  is  an  application  for  an  extension  to  the  Marketing  Authorisation  (MA)  for  Kaletra 
(lopinavir/ritonavir) made pursuant to Article 2(a) of Commission Regulation  (EC) No 1085/2003 and 
Annex  II  (point  2  iii).  The  MAH  would  like  to  add  a  new  pharmaceutical  form  and  strength  to  the 
Marketing Authorisation (MA): Kaletra film-coated tablets 200 mg lopinavir/50 mg ritonavir. 
Kaletra is currently the unique fixed boosted PI combination (including lopinavir + low dose ritonavir) 
available on the market. Given its antiviral potency, Kaletra is considered as a “gold standard” in the 
therapeutic  management  of  HIV  infected  patients.  However,  its  current  daily  dosing  regimen  is 
associated  with  particular  constraints:  a  drug  intake  corresponding  to  6  capsules  per  day,  with  food 
only, and requiring a refrigerated storage condition. 
This  new  tablet  formulation  is  aimed  at  simplifying  the  daily  dosing  regimen  of  Kaletra.  The 
development of this new tablet formulation was mainly guided by the MAH’s willingness of reducing 
the pill burden of lopinavir/ritonavir (from 6 (3 BID) soft gelatine capsules (SGC) daily to 4 (2 BID) 
tablets daily) and of avoiding the requirement of refrigerated storage condition. 
Kaletra is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children above the age of 2 years, in 
combination  with  other  antiretroviral  agents.  The  recommended  dosage  in  adults  and  adolescents  is 
two tablets twice daily taken with food. 
Overall, apart from the change in relation to the posology, interaction and pharmaceutical issues, the 
SPC information of the new formulation is comparable to the one of the currently marketed capsule 
formulation of Kaletra. 
The  MAH  utilised  melt-extrusion  technology  to  develop  new  tablet  formulation  with  a  higher  dose 
compared  to  the  capsules  and  with  improved  stability  at  room  temperature.  Critical  steps  in  the 
manufacturing process are identified and controlled. Control for intermediate and finished product is 
state of the art and validated according to relevant guidelines. 
No new preclinical data has been provided with the exception of toxicity data on the main excipient: 
copovidone, a copolymer of vinyl pyrrolidone and vinyl acetate (60% / 40%).  
Pharmacokinetics:  Bioavailability  studies  were  performed  during  formulation  optimisation  and  bio-
equivalency studies were done with the authorised capsules as comparator.  
Pharmacokinetic studies were performed on compliance with GLP and GCP.

QUALITY ASPECTS 
Introduction 
Kaletra film-coated tablets contain 200 mg of lopinavir and 50 mg of ritonavir as active substance. 
The other ingredients include: 
- 
- 
tablet  core:  copovidone,  sorbitan  laurate,  colloidal  anhydrous  silica  and  sodium  stearyl 
fumarate, 
film-coating:  hypromellose,  titanium  dioxide,  polyethylene  glycol  400,  hyroxypropyl 
cellulose, talc, silica colloidal anhydrous, polyethylene glycol 335, yellow ferric oxide (E172), 
polysorbate 80. 
The tablets are packed into HDPE bottles with polypropylene caps or in PVC/fluoropolymer blisters.

No  change  has  been  made  to  the  active  substances  already  authorised  for  Kaletra  presentations 
(EU/1/01/172/01-03).  
Lopinavir and ritonavir have very low water solubility.  
Drug Product  
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
This  new  film-coated  tablet  with  a  higher  drug  load  (200  mg  instead  of  133.3  mg  of  lopinavir  and 
50 mg  instead  of  33.3  mg  of  ritonavir)  has  been  developed  to  reduce  the  daily  pill  burden  of  the 
currently marketed soft capsule formulation (from 6 (3 BID) capsules daily to 4 (2 BID) tablets daily) 
and to avoid the requirement of refrigerated storage conditions.  
The  ratio  of  lopinavir  to  ritonavir  in  the  formulation  remains  unchanged  compared  to  the  currently 
marketed  formulations  for  Kaletra  and  their  compatibility  is  supported  by  the  already  available 
stability  data.    The  choice  of  excipients  was  based  on  physicochemical  properties  of  the  actives, 
processing  consideration  and  results  of  pilot  biostudies.  Compatibility  has  been  confirmed  by 
development studies and by the finished product stability data. A safety assessment has been provided 
with regards to the level of copovidone used in the formulation (see non clinical section).  
Formulation development has shown that lopinavir and ritonavir are uniformly dispersed in the matrix. 
The film coating is applied for taste and cosmetic purposes. The other excipients are added to facilitate 
processing and dissolution of the formulation in aqueous environments. 
All the excipients are commonly used for oral formulations and they are all of PhEur quality except 
the  film  coating,  which  is  satisfactorily  controlled  according  to  a  different  standard.  Regarding  the 
TSE risk, Kaletra does not contain any ingredient of ruminant origin. 
Satisfactory specification has been provided for the HDPE bottles closed with polypropylene caps and 
for the PVC/fluoropolymer blisters. 
The  new  film-coated  tablet  formulation  appears  to  be  suprabioavailable  (around  20%  increase  of 
lopinavir and ritonavir PK exposure) compared to the currently marketed soft capsule formulation (see 
clinical section). 
• 
Product Specification 
The  product  specification  includes  tests  controlled  by  validated  methods  for  appearance,  identity 
(HPLC and TLC), assay lopinavir (HPLC), assay ritonavir (HPLC), degradation products, dissolution, 
uniformity of dosage units lopinavir and ritonavir (PhEur), moisture and microbial limits (PhEur). 
The  related  impurities  of  lopinavir  and  ritonavir  are  the  same  as  the  impurities  for  lopinavir  and 
ritonavir  except  one  specific  degradation  product  of  ritonavir,  which  is  formed  during  the  extrusion 
step  of  the  manufacturing  process.  However,  the  process  development  and  stability  data  along  with 
qualification data support the proposed limits.  
Due to the properties of the actives, correlation of the in vitro characteristics with in vivo performance 
was  not  assured  and  human  pilot  biostudies  were used during development. The dissolution method 
appears capable of detecting the presence of undissolved ritonavir and lopinavir and suitable to ensure 
batch-to-batch consistency.   
Batch analysis data provided for production scale batches comply with the specifications and indicate 
consistent and reproducible manufacture.

•  Stability of the Product 
Stability data have been provided for batches manufactured at the commercial manufacturing site and 
packed in HDPE bottles with polypropylene caps and in PVC/fluoropolymer blisters. 
Under  long  term  conditions  (25°C/40%  RH  -  commercial  packaging)  and  accelerated  conditions 
(40°C/75%  RH  -  commercial  packaging),  respectively  up  to  18-month  data  and  6-month  data  have 
been provided. 
The  parameters  tested  included  appearance,  assay  lopinavir,  assay  ritonavir,  degradation  products 
ritonavir, dissolution, moisture and microbial limits. 
For all packaging and conditions no significant physical or chemical change was observed. 
Photostability  studies  have  shown  that  the  finished  product  is  non-light  sensitive.  Potential  effect of 
moisture  was  tested  at  25°C/40%  RH,  25°C/50%  RH,  25°C/60%  RH  and  showed  no  detectable 
crystallisation of lopinavir and ritonavir. 
The data provided support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
No  change  has  been  made  to  the  active  substances  lopinavir  and  ritonavir  already  authorised  for 
Kaletra presentations (EU/1/01/172/01-03). This new pharmaceutical form allows to reduce the daily 
pill  burden  of  the  currently  marketed  soft  capsule  formulation  and  to  avoid  the  requirement  of 
refrigerated  storage  conditions.  The  excipients  are  commonly  used  for  oral  formulations  and  the 
packaging  material  is  well  documented.  The  manufacturing  process  enhances  reproducibility  of 
finished product batches. Stability tests under ICH conditions indicate that the product is stable for the 
proposed shelf life.

NON-CLINICAL ASPECTS 
Introduction 
Results  of  pharmacological  and  toxicological  studies  of  lopinavir  and  ritonavir  were  submitted  and 
assessed  with  the  original  marketing  authorisation  application  for  Kaletra  soft  capsules  and  oral 
solution.  The  total  adult  daily  dose  for  Kaletra  film  coated  tablets  is  the  same  as  for  Kaletra  soft 
capsules.  No  new  non  clinical  safety  issues  have  been  associated  with  the  tablets  and  therefore  no 
additional preclinical data relating to the active substances has been submitted to support the use of the 
new formulation.  
In regard to excipients and taking into consideration that the level of copovidone (main excipient) is 
higher than previously used according to US FDA Inactive Ingredient Listing, the MAH provided a 
package of toxicity studies performed by BASF Corporations and Knoll Pharmaceuticals.  
Toxicology 
•  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
Repeat dose toxicity studies for copovidone in rats and dogs have not shown specific findings up to 
the highest dosages administered, with sufficient safety margins. On a mg/kg basis, safety margins in 
rats and dogs were 65 and 51 times higher than the human exposure.  
•  Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity 
Copovidone was not mutagenic, nor carcinogenic in the performed studies.

Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Regarding  the  environmental  aspects  of  Kaletra,  for  ritonavir,  the  PEC  surface  water  was  refined  to 
0.198 μg/l.  The  PEC/PNEC  ratio  for  ritonavir  =  0.132,  thus  <1  and  does  not  require  further 
investigations per the phase II Tier B evaluation. Consequently, ritonavir is unlikely to represent a risk 
to the environment.  
However, for lopinavir, the PEC surface water was refined to 1.88 μg/L. The PEC surface water is greater than 
the limit of 0.01  μg/l proposed in the 2005 EMEA draft guidance. Concerning the estimation of the 
refined PEC/PNEC ratio, no data were available for the evaluation of lopinavir. An environmental risk 
assessment has not been adequately addressed by the MAH. Consequently, the MAH had to provide 
an environmental risk assessment for lopinavir according to the Note for Guidance on Environmental 
Risk  Assessments  for  Pharmaceuticals  (Draft  CPMP/SWP/4447/00).  Key  environmental  parameters 
were re-calculated using modelling software. 
In order to model the fate of lopinavir in a sewage treatment plan (STP) with SimpleTreat (EUSES v 
2.0.3) it was necessary to derive some modelled input parameters using the QSAR software EPIWIN 
V 3.01 (Syracuse Research Corporation).   
The  organic  carbon  adsorption  coefficient  (Koc)  values  calculated  for  these  two  molecules  by 
EPIWIN  were  not  used  in  any  further  modelling,  as  they  were  extremely  high  values.  If  an 
experimental  value  is  available  for  the  Kow,  a  more  appropriate  method  of  Koc  estimation  is  by 
regression equations. This correlation method is the basis for the EUSES calculation in the absence of 
a  user-defined  value.  It  was  decided  therefore  to  conduct  a  sensitivity  analysis  with  EUSES  with 
respect to the Koc value. The Koc values used were: the value derived by EUSES based on the Kow 
of  the  compounds  (2290  litre/kg  and  2910  litre/kg  for  lopinavir  and  ritonavir,  respectively);  2500 
litre/kg  (the  highest  Koc  value  for  ritonavir,  expressed  to  2  significant  figures);  5000  litre/kg;  and 
10000 litre/kg (the trigger value for terrestrial fate and effects assessment).    
The PEC  surface  water values calculated for lopinavir after a treatment in a STP are less than 1.0 x 10-5 
mg/litre (0,01 μg/litre).

The results of four short-term ecotoxicity studies were available for ritonavir. All of these studies had 
resulted in no observable effect on the test organism, at the maximum concentration of ritonavir used 
in the studies. The aquatic ecotoxicology of ritonavir was therefore modelled with ECOSAR V 0.99e 
and compared to these experimental results. ECOSAR V 0.99e predicts the ecotoxicity of a compound 
based on regression equations utilising their Kow values. The variability of the modelled data with the 
experimental data was similar to that due to experimental error. Ecotoxicology data for lopinavir were 
modelled with ECOSAR V 0.99e. The ecotoxicology data are shown in Table 4.

Values modelled with Syracuse EPIWIN Ver 3.01 based on SMILES notation 
Risk characterisation ratios (RCR) were calculated for fish, daphnia and green algae based on the short 
term  ecotoxicology  data  that  were  available  for  ritonavir  and  the  equivalent  modelled  data  for 
lopinavir.  A  conservative  assessment  factor  of  1000  was  used  to  calculate  the  predicted  no  effect 
concentrations (PNEC). The RCR values for each trophic level were calculated for each PEC surface water 
calculated by EUSES.

No modelled data for micro-organisms available 
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects  
In response to the CHMP’s request, PEC surface water of lopinavir had been re-calculated using modelling 
software and modelled physico-chemical values.   
Consequentially,  PEC  surface  water  established  using  these  modelled  ecotoxicology  data  are  not  very 
reliable. Only the PEC  surface  water values determined on measured ecotoxicology data can be take into 
consideration  (PEC  surface  water  =  1,88  μg/l).  However,  this  value  exceeds  the  limit  of  0.01  μg/l.  No 
experimental  studies  have  been  performed.  Instead  the  MAH  provided  ecotoxicology  data  modelled 
with a software (ECOSAR V 0.99e ). The lowest value of modelled ecotoxicology data of lopinavir 
could be considered with regard to NOEC of ritonavir. The lowest modelled NOEC is 1.914 mg/litre 
in green algae. If a conservative factor of 1000 is used, the estimated PNEC WATER value is 1.914 μg/l. 
The PEC surface water / PNEC WATER  ratio is below 1 and it could be considered that lopinavir is unlikely 
to represent a risk to the environment.

CLINICAL ASPECTS 
Introduction 
The  clinical  dossier  is  exclusively  composed  of  pharmacokinetic  studies  performed  in  healthy 
volunteers.  
All (M01-306, M01-381, M03-616, M04-703) except one study (M03-580) were performed at single 
dose. 
-  Study M01-306 aimed at determining the relative bioavailability of six pilot formulations of 
lopinavir/ritonavir  tablets  relative  to  the  marketed  soft  gelatine  capsule  under  non-fasting 
conditions, 
-  Study M01-381 aimed at determining the relative bioavailability of three pilot formulations of 
lopinavir/ritonavir  tablets  formulations  chosen  from  study  M01-306  relative  to  soft  capsules 
formulations under fasting and non-fasting conditions. 
-  Study M03-616 (pivotal study) aimed at determining the bioavailability of the to-be-marketed 
tablet  formulation  manufactured  at  production  scale  relative  to  gelatine  capsule.  Fasting, 
moderate-fat and high fat conditions were also tested 
-  Study  M04-703  (pivotal  study)  aimed  at  determining  why  different  bioavailability  results 
were  found  from  studies  M03-580  and  M03-616  so  determining  the  bioavailability  of  three 
different  tablet  lots  (two  were  previously  tested-  lot  1  and  pilot  lot)  compared  to  that  of 
capsules. 
-  Study M03-580 had three main objectives:  
o  To  compare  the  single  dose  bioavailability  of  lopinavir/ritonavir  400/100  mg  (1)  as 
well  as  of  lopinavir  800/200  mg  (2)  from  a  partial  scale  up  lot  of  an  experimental 
tablet formulation to that obtained from the capsule 
o  To  explore  (multiple  dose)  the  co-administration  of  the  tablet  formulation  with  a 
known  CYP3A4  inducer,  efavirenz  (3).  As  a  reminder  the  co-administration  of 
efavirenz and Kaletra Capsule formulation justifying a dose increase from 400/100 to 
533/133 mg daily. 
o  Finally a meta-analysis was performed gathering the results of studies M03-616 and 
M04-703 
GCP 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
Pharmacokinetics 
•  Relative bioavailability between the to be marketed tablet formulation and the capsule 
formulation  
As  detailed  below  for  the  pivotal  studies,  the  results  did  not  strictly  match  the  criteria  of 
bioequivalence across the studies. A supra-bioavailability of the tablet formulation as compared to the 
currently marketed formulation was consistently shown.

When the PK results related to the capsule derived from study M03-616 and M04-703 were compared, 
a  slight  difference  was  observed  (around  10%  in  AUC),  suggesting  a  variability  in  the  PK  of  the 
capsule  formulation  used  as  reference  in  the  bioequivalence  studies  with  the  tablet  formulation. 
According to the MAH “this variability in the performance of the reference SGC alone may account 
for the difference in relative bioavailability assessment of the to-be-marketed tablet across studies”. To 
solve  this  problem,  the  MAH  has  performed  a  meta-analysis  [combining  the  two  pivotal 
bioavailability  studies  (M03-616  and  M04-703)]  to  better  evaluate  the  relative  bioavailability  of  the 
tablet as compared to the capsule formulation. 
Results  of  meta-analysis  combining  data  from  the  pivotal  bioavailability  studies  (regimen  A  and  C 
from study M03-616 and regimen A, B and D in study M04-703 are detailed thereafter:

The  results  derived  from  this  meta-analysis  do  not  strictly  match  the  criteria  for  bioequivalence 
between the tablet and capsule formulations. Again a higher bioavailability is observed with the tablet 
formulation  as  compared  to  the  capsule  formulation  (around  20%  higher  exposure  for  lopinavir  and 
ritonavir). 
•  Food influence on the tablet formulation 
The  food  effect  of  the  tablet  formulation  under  fasting,  moderate-fat  and  high-fat  conditions  was 
explored in the single dose study M03-616 in healthy volunteers.

after a high-fat breakfast. 
A wash out of 7 days separated the 
doses of each five study periods. 
Based on the results of this study M03-616 it appears that the food influence is much more noticeable 
for the capsule (» 40% increase of the exposure) than for the tablet formulation (» 20% increase of the 
exposure).  This  justifies  a  capsule  intake  “with  food  only”,  whereas  the  to-be-marketed  tablet 
formulation could be administered “with or without food”. 
Moreover,  when  considering  the  relative  bioavailability  between  the  tablet  and  capsule  formulation 
under fast and fed conditions:  
-  Under  fed  conditions  (C/A)  a  supra-bioavailability  of  the  tablet  formulation  is  observed  as 
compared to the capsule formulation. 
-  This  supra-bioavailability  is  even  more  noticeable  under  fasting  (D/B)  conditions  (likely  in 
relation  with  the  sub-optimal  conditions  of  drug  intake  for  the  capsule  formulation  which is 
only to be administered with food). 
•  Exploration of the co-administration with a CYP3A4 antiretroviral inducer, efavirenz 
A specific part of study M03-580 was performed at multiple dose and was aimed at exploring the co-
administration of Kaletra tablet formulation with efavirenz, according to the following schema:  
- 
- 
- 
Samples were collected on day 18 and 32 during a 12h-dosing interval. 
From day 8 to day 18: lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg bid.

Given the strength of the to-be-marketed tablet formulation (200/50 mg lopinavir/ritonavir), the MAH 
proposed  a  dose  increase  from  400/100  mg  (2  tablets)  BID  to  600/150  mg  (3  tablets)  BID  with  the 
tablet to mimic the dose increase currently recommended with the capsule [from 400/100 (3 capsules) 
BID to 533/133 mg (4 capsules) BID]. However, such a dose increase for the tablet obviously leads to 
major  increase  of  the  lopinavir  and  ritonavir  PK  exposures  (56  to  92%  higher  than  the  capsule 
exposure). As a second step, based on a modelling program the MAH concludes that a dose increase 
of Kaletra when co-administered with efavirenz is no longer necessary when Kaletra is used as a tablet 
formulation.  This  conclusion  is  even  extended  to  the  co-administration  of  other antiretroviral agents 
that  currently  requires  a  dose  adjustment  (increase)  with  the  capsule  formulation  (nelfinavir, 
amprenavir).  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The result of a study performed in healthy volunteers together with extrapolation, is not sufficient to 
ensure a safe co-administration of efavirenz (as well as nelfinavir and amprenavir) with the new tablet 
formulation  of  Kaletra.  The  co-administration  of  efavirenz  without  any  dose  increases  of  Kaletra 
tablets,  as  currently  proposed  by  the  MAH,  needs  to  be  explored  within  a  specific  pharmacokinetic 
study to validate the MAH’s assumption. Moreover, such a confirmatory study needs to be performed 
in  the  target  population  of  HIV  infected  patients  to  provide  a  reliable  demonstration  of  the 
pharmacokinetics of this new formulation. Therefore, the MAH was requested to provide the results of 
a  pharmacokinetic  interaction  study  in  healthy  volunteers  to  further  assess  the  co-administration  of 
Kaletra tablet and efavirenz.  
New pharmacokinetic interaction study between Kaletra tablet and efavirenz in healthy volunteers 
M05-792  
is  a  Phase  1,  multiple-dose,  non-fasting,  open-label  study  assessing 
Study  M05-792 
the 
pharmacokinetics and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) 400/100 mg dosed twice daily (BID) as the 
tablet  formulation  co-administered  with  efavirenz  (EFV)  600  mg  (tablet)  every  evening  (QHS) 
compared to lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg BID dosed as the soft gelatine capsule (SGC) in healthy 
adults.  
Although  the  ritonavir  pharmacokinetic  parameters  are  not  significantly  influenced  by  the  co-
administration  with  efavirenz,  the  same  does  not  apply  for  lopinavir.  Indeed,  all  pharmacokinetic 
parameters  of  lopinavir  with  efavirenz  are  markedly  below  (up  to  42%  of  the  Cmin  value)  those 
obtained  with  the  capsule  administered  alone.  Exposure  of  lopinavir  tablet  combined  with  efavirenz 
will  be  lower  than  that  obtained  with  lopinavir  capsule  or  lopinavir  capsule  533/133  mg  with 
efavirenz. Co-administration of Kaletra tablet at unchanged dose with efavirenz will expose patients to 
suboptimal exposure to Kaletra with potential risk of emergence of resistance. 
It is noteworthy that when Kaletra capsule is combined with efavirenz, the lopinavir Cmin is decreased 
to  around  45%  and  the  Ctrough  to  around  35%  as  compared  to  the  Kaletra  capsule  recommended 
400/100  mg  BID  dose.  Based  on  these  data  the  MAH  has  recommended  that  the  dose  of  Kaletra 
should  be  increased  from  400/100  mg  BID  to  533/133  mg  BID.  However,  when  Kaletra  tablet  is 
combined with efavirenz, the lopinavir Cmin is decreased to around 40% and the Ctrough to around 30% 
as  compared  to  the  Kaletra  tablet  recommended  400/100  mg  BID  dose.  However,  in  this  case  the 
MAH is confident that there is no need for any Kaletra dose increase and that no clinical consequence 
is expected.  
This  leads  to  serious  doubts  about  the  claimed  lack  of  clinical  consequence  of  decreased  Cmin  and 
Ctrough exposure:  
Given  that  the  Kaletra  tablet  dossier  only  consists  of  pharmacokinetic  data  (i.e.  no  clinical  data  is 
available with the tablet formulation of Kaletra), there is a need to stick to the PK parameters of the 
Kaletra capsule whose MA has been granted on the basis of a valid efficacy/safety demonstration.  
The selected dose of Kaletra capsule corresponds to specific values of PK parameters. This selected 
dose has been clinically validated based on a reliable pivotal study. In spite of this, the MAH claims 
that  due  to  the  supra-bioavailability  of  the  tablet  formulation,  conclusions  on  the  interaction  of  the 
capsule formulation (i.e. the need to administer a higher dosage of Kaletra to patients) with efavirenz 
do  not  apply  to  the  tablet  formulation.  However,  such  reasoning  on  one  issue  could  lead  to  doubts 
about the validity of the recommended dose for the tablet formulation, which in all other instances is 
based upon the dose finding studies for Kaletra capsules. If a lack of clinical consequence associated 
with  a  marked  decrease  in  Cmin/Ctrough  could  indeed  be  assumed  by  the  MAH,  why  then  did  he  not 
propose an overall lowering of the recommended dose for the tablet formulation. 
It has to be emphasised that there is a particular need to stick to the PK parameters corresponding to 
the selected dose that has been substantiated by reliable pivotal studies (M98-863 notably). Otherwise, 
there could be potential consequences in terms of time to virological failure and of risk of emerging 
resistance associated with sub-optimal lopinavir levels.  
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Finally the MAH considers that there is no need to confirm the results of the interaction study derived 
from  healthy  volunteers  in  HIV  infected  patients,  since  the  PK  parameters  are  expected  to  be  quite 
close in both populations.  
In  this  respect,  it  is  important  to  emphasise  that  lopinavir  concentrations  after  administration  of 
capsules  seem  to  be  lower  in  patients  compared  to  healthy  volunteers.  Such  effect  might  also  be 
observed with Kaletra tablets:

Overall,  contrarily  to  the  MAH’s  conclusion  that  there  is  no  need  for  Kaletra  dose  increase  when 
Kaletra  tablet  is  combined  with  efavirenz  (i.e.  different  attitude  as  the  one  recommended  for  the 
capsule:  dose  increase  from  400/100  mg  BID  to  533/133  mg  BID),  the  CHMP  considers  that  the 
interaction  study  results  reinforce  the  CHMP’s  concern  that  this  co-administration  without  dose 
adjustment  will  expose  patients  to  sub-optimal  concentrations  and  potential  risk  of  emergence  of 
resistance.  
Given that the unique dose adjustment explored by the MAH with the tablet (i.e. 600/150 to mimic the 
533/133 mg dose increase recommended with the capsule) was associated with an overexposure (up 
56% for lopinavir and 92% for ritonavir) the MAH is requested to further explore a dose increase of 
Kaletra tablet when combined with efavirenz (e.g. by providing an half-dose tablet of 100/25 mg to be 
added to Kaletra 400/100 mg BID).  
In the meantime the CHMP recommends that this co-administration should be not recommended for 
the lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg BID regimen. However, if judged clinically necessary prescribers 
have the possibility to co-administrate lopinavir/ritonavir 600/150 mg and efavirenz. However, given 
the  overexposure  associated  with  the  co-administration  of  lopinavir/ritonavir  600/150  mg  BID  with 
efavirenz  600  mg  once  daily,  prescribers  will  have  to  closely  monitor  safety  aspects  of  this  co-
administration. 
The  same  should  apply  for  nelfinavir,  amprenavir  and  nevirapine  (since  an  extrapolation  has  been 
made  for  Kaletra  capsule  between  the  recommendation  for  efavirenz  and  these  other  antiretroviral 
agents).  
Pharmacodynamics 
No  new  data  on  pharmacodynamics  of  Kaletra  tablet  formulation  have  been  submitted  within  this 
application. 
Clinical efficacy 
No  new  data  on  clinical  efficacy  of  Kaletra  tablet  formulation  have  been  submitted  within  this 
application. 
Clinical safety 
In response to the CHMP request for providing comparative safety data between the capsule and tablet 
formulation  of  Kaletra  in  the  target  population  of  HIV  infected  patients,  the  MAH  has  proposed  to 
derive such data from a recently initiated study M05-730:  
M05-730  study  is  an  open-label,  randomized,  multiple  centre,  multi-country  study  designed  to 
compare  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  lopinavir/ritonavir  tablets  versus  soft  gel  capsules,  and  to 
compare  the  safety,  tolerability  and  antiviral  activity  of  lopinavir/ritonavir  tablets  when  dosed  QD 
versus  BID  in  combination  with  nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors  in  the  treatment  of 
antiretroviral naïve, HIV-1 infected subjects. This study plans to enrol 600 patients.  
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy variable will be the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA levels below 
50 copies/ml at Week 48 (to compare BID and QD dosing tablet regimens) . 
The primary safety variable will be the proportion of subjects with adverse events of diarrhoea during 
the first 8 weeks of study drug treatment (tablet or SGC formulation). 
It is important to note that this study is also expected to provide useful pharmacokinetic comparative 
data between the capsule and tablet formulations in HIV infected patients. Indeed, approximately 20 
subjects  per  treatment  arm  (80  subjects  total)  will  have  full  12  or  24  hour  (depending  on 
lopinavir/ritonavir  dosing  interval)  pharmacokinetic  analysis  performed  at  Week  2.  In  addition, 
patients  who  initiate  therapy  with  the  SGC  formulation  will  have  repeat  pharmacokinetic  analysis 
performed at Week 10, approximately 2 weeks after switching from the SGC to the tablet formulation. 
The study design is detailed thereafter:  
Even if the main objective of the proposed study M05-730 is to validate a QD regimen of the tablet, 
the first part of the study is of particular interest for providing comparative PK and short term safety 
data (gastrointestinal AEs) between the capsule and the tablet formulations in the target population of 
HIV  infected  patients,  in  line  with  the  CHMP  request.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  this  request  was  not 
considered as a prerequisite for the MA of Kaletra tablets by the CHMP but rather as a post approval 
commitment.  
Nevertheless, it should be stated that without the initiation of this study prior to the approval it would 
have  been  quite  difficult  to  enrol  patients  in  the  capsule  arm  with  the  tablet  formulation  already 
approved.  Therefore,  it  is  very  useful  that  this  study  has  already  started  because  otherwise  the 
possibility  of  obtaining  these  comparative  PK  and  safety  data  would  have  been  significantly 
compromised.  Finally,  it  is  unfortunate  that  this  study  is  not  blinded.  Nevertheless,  this  seems 
acceptable given the pill burden needed for a blinding design. 
Overall, this study represents the most critical aspect of the proposed risk management programme.  
Another  issue  to  consider  is  the  potential  for  medication  errors,  resulting  from  the  temporary  co-
existence  on  the  market  of  the  capsule  (requiring  the  ingestion  of  6  capsules  per  day)  and  tablet 
(allowing  a  reduction  to  4  tablets  per  day,  with  a  different  interaction  profile  and  different  storage 
condition)  formulations.  The  MAH  indeed  considers  that  there  is  a  need  for  transition  period  from 
SGCs to tablets ranging from 6 to 12 months.  
If  the  need  for a transition period is supported its time duration should be minimal. In this field the 
MAH  has  to  justify  the  6-12  months  delay  for  the  substitution.  Moreover,  the  release  of  the  tablet 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
formulation on the market will have to be accompanied by a letter to health care professionals to avoid 
any medication errors. The MAH is requested to provide a proposal in this field.  
These  two  questions  have  been  addressed  to  the  MAH  during  the  assessment  process.  The  MAH 
answered that with the support of the CHMP, he commits that local affiliates in each EU country will 
work  closely  with  the  national  agencies  to  define  a  plan  and  determine  timelines  appropriate  for 
transition from Kaletra soft capsules to the tablet formulation in their local markets. Coordination with 
national agencies will be key to identifying a definitive launch date to initiate advanced planning that 
will  facilitate  an  expedited  transition  timeline.  Furthermore,  the  proposed  Dear  Health  Care 
Professional Letter (see Annex 6) will be revised to more clearly identify the risk for medication errors 
during the transition period. The importance of the local transition plan will also be highlighted in this 
letter.  The final DHCPL will be submitted for CHMP review prior to first product launch in the EU. 
The MAH’s responses could be considered as endorsed. It is admitted that the transition period might 
vary across Member States. . A revised proposal will have to be proposed by the MAH for validation 
before the release. 
•  Paediatric population 
The replacement of the capsule formulation by the tablet formulation will lead to a gap between the 
actual large availability of Kaletra SGC in children (children with 0.4<BSA<1.75 may resort with soft 
capsule)  and  the  limited  availability  of  the  new  Kaletra  tablet  in  children  (the  available  200/50mg 
tablet is only suitable for children with BSA greater than 1.3m2), as reflected in the table below:

Therefore,  the  development  of  a  reduced-strength  paediatric  tablet,  which  would  allow  to  supply 
children with BSA >0.8 m2 with a tablet formulation and reduce the gap between availability of the 
old and new oral solid formulation, is particularly awaited in this field.  
The  MAH  explored  dosing  of  paediatric  patients  with  the  tablet  formulation.  Although  the  MAH 
continues to endorse the use of lopinavir/ritonavir  oral solution as the most appropriate formulation, 
allowing  precise  dosing,  in  paediatric  patients,  the  MAH,  recognising  that  some patients may prefer 
the tablet over the oral solution. The MAH has therefore committed himself to the development of a 
paediatric tablet strength.

PHARMACOVIGILANCE  
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system has deficiencies that should be addressed as 
part of the follow up measures post approval. 
A  detailed  description  of  the  Company’s  pharmacovigilance  system  including  the  responsibilities  of 
the  EU  qualified  person,  the  organisation,  the  system  for  collecting  adverse  events,  the  database  in 
which the adverse events are contained, and the processes surrounding signal detection, co-licensing 
agreements,  quality  management,  quality  assurance,  compliance,  and  training  was  provided  by  the 
MAH.  
•  EU qualified person for pharmacovigilance 
Only the job description of the qualified person is provided by the MAH. 
The following data are lacking and should be provided: 
-  The  name,  address,  contact  details  of  the  Qualified  Person  responsible  for  pharmacovigilance, 
located in the EEA. 
- The Curriculum Vitae of the qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance and a description of 
the  back-up  procedure  to  apply  in  his  absence,  including  the  information  relevant  to  their  role 
(qualifications, training and experience). The qualified person should be able to justify an experience 
in pharmacovigilance. 
•  Organisation 
The  organisation  chart  for  global  pharmacovigilance  is  presented  and  the  relationships  between  the 
pharmacovigilance  units  are 
the 
illustrated.  The  CHMP  welcomes 
pharmacovigilance activities undertaken by each of the units involved. However, pharmacovigilance 
procedures  in  place  are  not  presented  in  this  report.  A  list  of  the  written  policies  and  procedures 
describing  the  pharmacovigilance  activities  of  the  company  should  be  provided.  These  need  not  be 
separate titles but the list should indicate which procedures cover activities. Copies of the procedures 
should  be  available  within  two  working  days  on  request  by  the  Competent  Authorities.  All 
information received by the MAH should be managed in order to respect the confidentiality of patients 
and reporters. 
the  brief  summary  of 
The MAH should provide a flow diagram indicating the flow of safety reports of different origins and 
types  obtained  and  transmitted.  These  should  indicate  how  reports/information  is  processed  and 
reported from the source to the point of receipt by the Competent Authorities and, where appropriate, 
to healthcare providers. 
•  Adverse event database 
The  MAH  is  using  a  global  electronic  system  for  storing  and  reporting  adverse  events.  The  MAH 
should clarify if this database is compliant with ICH E2BM and if the updated version of MedDRA 
9.0 is used (internationally agreed standard for electronic submission of adverse reaction reports). 
•  Co-licensing agreements 
The MAH has a system in place to assure that the EU qualified person is aware of the details of any 
pharmacovigilance safety data exchange agreement for products marketed in the EU. 
The  MAH  should  provide  a  brief  description  of  the  agreements  with  co-marketing  partners  and 
contractors for pharmacovigilance activities, including reporting responsibilities and arrangements for 
literature searches.

QA  management,  provides  an  organisational  structure  that  assures  work  is  conducted  in  accordance 
with the Quality system. GPRD QA maintains the Quality System and conducts quality audits. 
The  CHMP  agrees  with  the  brief  description  of  the  quality  management  system.  The  MAH  also 
presented  the  Quality  Assurance  support  for  the  Abbott  pharmacovigilance  system  provided  by  the 
global audit program. Particular emphasis is placed on organisational roles and responsibilities for the 
activities and documentation and for ensuring corrective and preventive action. 
•  Compliance 
This  information  is  analysed  to  identify  opportunities  to  improve  and  enhance  existing  reporting 
related procedures and processes. Pharmacovigilance compliance metrics are compiled on a monthly 
basis. Metrics are provided related to the EMEA and Affiliate local regulatory reporting requirements. 
Individual case reporting metrics are obtained and analysed. Formal investigations into any instances 
of non-compliance are initiated whenever appropriate. Senior management is informed of compliance 
metrics  at  regular  intervals  and  provides  recommendations  to  continually  improve  the  monitoring 
process. 
•  Training 
The  MAH  is  committed  to  ensuring  staff  are  trained  to  the  highest  standards  therefore  Global 
Pharmacovigilance  has  a  team  dedicated  to  training.  This  active  team  provides  training  through  a 
variety of media and ensures that all training activities are appropriately documented and recorded in 
personal training files. Training matrices have been developed for all roles to ensure that staff receives 
both  initial  and  maintenance  training  in  all  relevant  areas.  Each  year  a  regional  pharmacovigilance 
training meeting is conducted for all affiliates including those within the Europe. 
While the CHMP agrees with the brief description of the training system but the MAH should indicate 
where the training records, CVs and job descriptions can be found. 
In  conclusion,  the  MAH’s  pharmacovigilance  system  is  globally  endorsed.  However,  some  further 
data  should  be  provided  in  the  setting  of  a  follow-up  measure  to  be  provided  as  a  post-approval 
commitment  in  order  to  fully  match  the  pharmacovigilance  regulatory  obligations  (see  2.6  of  this 
assessment report).

Proposed risk minimisation activities 
Revised  Dear  Health  Care  Professional 
Letter  (DHCPL,  see  Annex  6  to  this 
Assessment Report) to be submitted to the 
CHMP  for  endorsement  prior  to  first 
product launch in the EU.  
The  MAH  will  work  closely  with  each 
national  competent  authority  to  ensure 
that prior to launch in each Member State, 
health  care  professionals  are  provided 
with  the  DHCPL  informing  them  about 
the  possibility  of  confusion  and  dosage 
errors  due  to  the  impending  co-existence 
of  both  pharmaceutical  forms  (soft  gel 
capsule and film-coated tablets). 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that the above 
mentioned  risk  minimisation  activities  are  necessary  for  the  safe  and  effective  use  of  the  medicinal 
product. 
The  two  main  concerns  in  regard  to  the  tablet  formulation  are  first  the  potentially  different  safety 
profile  for  the  tablet  formulation  due  to  supra-bioavailability.  Second  the  potential  for  medication 
errors  due  to  temporary  co-existence  of  capsule  and  tablet  formulation  on  the  market,  each  of  them 
following a different posology. 
In  this  regard,  the  MAH  states  that  his  risk  minimisation  efforts  for  the  introduction  and  continued 
surveillance of Kaletra tablets described in this response are comprehensive enough to ensure patient 
safety. Key components of the overall safety surveillance plan include continued pharmacovigilance 
monitoring and reporting of safety findings in PSUR submissions, a return to 6-month periodicity for 
PSURs, additional efforts to minimise the risk of patient confusion and associated medication errors 
during  the  6-12  month  transition  period  (including  product  packaging  and  patient,  prescriber  and 
pharmacist  education),  and  the  conduct  of  a  phase  III  study,  which  will  provide  a  comparative 
assessment of the tablet tolerability profile relative to the SGC in 600 HIV infected patients.  
With regards to the potential for medication errors, this potential risk will be anticipated with several 
steps as already applied in the USA, and will help to minimise the risk of medication errors: 
-  Educational  material  for  patients,  especially  with  description  on  key  differences  between 
capsules and tablets, and guidance on switching to the new formulation 
-  Educational material for pharmacists and doctors 
-  A short transition period from capsules to tablets, ranging from 6 to 12 months 
-  A different colour for tablets compared to capsules (yellow versus orange) 
-  A  different  colour  for  the  product  packaging  (yellow)  with  two  yellow  tablets  displayed  in 
bottom left corner of the label.

The  MAH  presented  again  in  an  extensive  way  the  arguments  advanced  in  the  initial  application, 
including  a  similar  drug  exposure  in  multiple  dose  studies  across  both  formulations  and  between 
healthy and HIV-1 infected subjects, a potential even better safety profile of the tablet compared to the 
capsule. These arguments were judged as not convincing enough to reassure the safety profile of the 
tablet  formulation  (see  consolidated  list  of  questions,  Annex  3).  In  particular,  given  that  the  clinical 
dossier of the Kaletra tablet formulation only consists of pharmacokinetic data performed in a limited 
number  of  healthy  volunteers  almost  exclusively  in  single  dose,  it  is  inappropriate  to  draw  any 
conclusion at this stage on the safety profile of this tablet formulation, especially in comparison to the 
capsule formulation.  
As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  more  valuable  information  with  regard  to  the  safety  profile  of  the  tablet 
formulation  will  be  issued  from  the  ongoing  Phase  III  study,  study  M05-730,  allowing  to  provide 
comparative safety and PK data between tablet and capsule formulations in the targeted population of 
HIV  infected  patients  (see  detailed  design  and  discussion  on  this  study  in  question  11  below).  This 
open-label study, initiated in December 2005, plans to include 600 naïve HIV-infected patients. 
Another  issue  to  consider  is  the  potential  for  medication  errors,  resulting  from  the  temporary  co-
existence  on  the  market  of  the  capsule  (requiring  the  ingestion  of  6  capsules  per  day)  and  tablet 
(allowing  a  reduction  to  4  tablets  per  day,  with  a  different  interaction  profile  and  different  storage 
condition)  formulations.  The  MAH  states  that  there  is  a  need  for  transition  period  from  SGCs  to 
tablets ranging from 6 to 12 months.  
The  CHMP  considers  that  this  transition  period  should  be  minimal  but  it  is  acknowledged  that  this 
duration  might  vary  within  European  Member  States.  This  will  have  to  be  discussed  at  a  national 
level. Moreover, the release of the tablet formulation on the market will have to be accompanied by a 
letter  to  health  care  professionals  to  avoid  any  medication  errors.  This  has  been  added  to  the  post 
approval commitments as laid down in the Letter of Undertaking.

OVERALL CONCLUSIONS, RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT AND 
RECOMMENDATION 
Quality 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
No  new  non-clinical  data  in  regards  to  safety  issues  of  the  active  substances  were  submitted.  The 
submitted  data  for  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  for  copovidone  showed  no  specific  findings  up  to  the 
highest dosage administered and were therefore judged satisfactory. The remaining concern relates to 
conflicting  data  for  the  active  substances  in  regards  to  ecotoxicity  about  discrepancies  between 
modelled values and measured values of water solubility at 25°C needs further clarification. The MAH 
should explain these discrepancies and justify the validity of the data used in the software.  
Pharmacokinetics  
The  clinical  dossier  was  exclusively  composed  of  pharmacokinetic  studies  performed  in  healthy 
volunteers. Results of meta-analysis combining data from the pivotal bioavailability studies (regimen 
A and C from study M03-616 and regimen A, B and D in study M04-703) showed that the criteria for 
bioequivalence were not strictly met. A 20% higher exposure for lopinavir and ritonavir with the tablet 
formulation as compared to the tablet can be observed. As the food effect is more expressed with the 
capsule  formulation,  this  supra-bioavailability  is  even  more  noticeable  under  fasting  conditions  than 
under  fed  conditions.  Exploration  of  the  co-administration  with  a  CYP3A4  antiretroviral  inducer 
(efavirenz)  showed  a  need  to  increase  the  dosage  for  Kaletra  tablet  when  given  concomitantly  with 
these medicinal products. The SPC was updated accordingly.

Safety 
No apparent deterioration of the safety profile is observed with the tablet as compared to the capsule 
formulation  of  Kaletra.  However,  the  safety  analysis  has  important  limitations  since  it  is  based  on 
studies performed in healthy volunteers and at single dose as well as on historical data. Therefore, the 
safety data cannot be regarded as strictly reassuring in regards to the potential alteration of the safety 
profile  associated  with  the  apparent  supra-bioavailability  of  the  tablet  as  compared  to  the  capsule 
formulation of Kaletra (around 20% increase of lopinavir and ritonavir PK exposures). This question 
will  be  addressed  by  the  findings  of  a  study  comparing  the  capsule  formulation  with  the  new  tablet 
formulation in HIV infected patients that has been initiated by the MAH.  
For paediatric patients, the tablet formulation does not provide the optimal flexibility to best support 
accurate  dosing.  The  continued  availability  of  lopinavir/ritonavir  oral  solution,  with  its  inherently 
greater  dosing  flexibility  remains  the  preferred  formulation  for  use  in  the  paediatric  population. 
However, the fact that an available solid oral form will no longer be available for children with BSA 
of less than 1.3 m2 in view of the replacement of the capsule formulation by the tablet formulation will 
create difficulties in clinical practice. Therefore, the MAH is required to explore the development of a 
dosage that will allow a finer dose titration in this population for a solid pharmaceutical form. 
Overall,  provided  that  no  concern  on  the  safety  profile  of  the  tablet  formulation  with  its  supra-
bioavailability  emerges  from  the  ongoing  study  M05-730,  routine  pharmacovigilance  activities, 
including  continued  pharmacovigilance  monitoring  and  reporting  of  safety  findings  in  PSUR 
submissions,  as  well  as  a  return  to  6-month  periodicity  for  PSURs  are  considered  to  be  adequate  to 
detect any new signals associated with the new tablet formulation. Additional efforts to minimise the 
risk  of  patient  confusion  and  associated  medication  errors  during  the  transition  period  (including 
product  packaging  and  patient,  prescriber  and  pharmacist  education)  are  judged  adequate  by  the 
CHMP. 
Risk-benefit assessment 
This  new  tablet  formulation  of  Kaletra  presents  advantages  over  the  currently  marketed  capsule 
formulation that it is ultimately expected to replace: in particular a reduced pill burden (from 3 BID to 
2BID) and no need for refrigerated storage conditions.  
The  MAH  has  submitted  a  limited  dossier  to  support  the  Marketing  Authorisation  of  this  new 
formulation.  
In  effect,  the  clinical  dossier  consists  exclusively  of  pharmacokinetic  studies  performed  in  healthy 
volunteers  at  single  dose  (except  one  study  at  multiple  dose).  No  data  in  HIV  infected  patients  is 
available. This is particularly critical since the demonstration of bioequivalence is quite disputable. As 
a matter of fact, a supra-bioavailability of the new formulation is observed (increase of around 20% of 
the  lopinavir  and  ritonavir  exposures)  with  a  potential  impact  on  the  safety  profile  of  this  fixed 
combination.  It  cannot  be  excluded  that  the  difference  be  more  marked  in  HIV  infected  patients. 
Moreover, given this supra-bioavailability the MAH considers that the recommended dose increase of 
Kaletra when combined with efavirenz, should only apply for the capsule formulation but is no longer 
necessary for the tablet formulation. However, this assumption was only based on modelled data that 
suffered from limitations.  
Therefore, at the D120 list of questions the MAH was requested to address two main issues:  
• 
First, to make a proposal for collecting reassuring comparative PK and safety data between the 
capsule and tablet formulation in the target population of HIV infected patients.  
The  MAH  has  just  initiated  (December  2005)  a  new  open  label  study  (M  05-730)  in  antiretroviral 
naïve patients (n=600) whose main objective of this study is to validate the QD regimen of the tablet 
formulation. Nevertheless this study is de facto expected to provide comparative pharmacokinetic data 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as well as short term (8 weeks) gastrointestinal safety data (diarrhoea) between the capsule and tablet 
formulation.  
• 
Second,  to  provide  the  results  of  an  interaction  study  between  Kaletra  tablet  formulation  and 
efavirenz in healthy volunteers. 
In line with the CHMP request, the MAH has provided the results of a new interaction study (M05-
792)  with  efavirenz.  However,  contrarily  to  the  MAH’s conclusion that there is no need for Kaletra 
dose increase when Kaletra tablet is combined with efavirenz (i.e. different recommendation as the for 
the  SGC:  dose  increase  from  400/100  mg  BID  to  533/133  mg  BID),  the  CHMP  considers  that  the 
interaction study results [reduced Ctrough (27%) and Cmin (42%)] reinforce the CHMP concern that this 
co-administration  without  dose  adjustment  will  expose  patients  to  sub-optimal  concentrations  and 
potential risk of emergence of resistance.  
Given that the unique dose adjustment explored by the MAH with the tablet (i.e. 600/150 to mimic the 
533/133 mg dose increase recommended with the capsule) was associated with an over-exposure (up 
56% for lopinavir and 92% for ritonavir) the MAH is requested to further explore a dose increase of 
Kaletra tablet when combined with efavirenz (e.g. by providing an half-dose tablet of 100/25 mg to be 
added to Kaletra 400/100 mg BID).  
In the meantime, the CHMP considers that this co-administration should be discouraged. As a matter 
of fact, stating that this co-administration is not recommended is not expected to significantly hamper 
the  therapeutic  management  of  patients,  since  the  resort  to  this  co-administration  is  expected  to  be 
marginal  in  clinical  practice  especially  in  antiretroviral  naïve  patients  but  also  in  antiretroviral 
experienced  patients.  Nevertheless,  this  is  not  a  formal  contra-indication,  i.e.  if  judged  necessary 
prescribers  still  have  the  possibility  to  co-administrate  lopinavir/ritonavir  600/150  mg  and  efavirenz 
600 mg QD, while closely monitoring safety aspects of this co-administration. 
The  same  should  apply  for  nelfinavir,  amprenavir  and  nevirapine  (since  an  extrapolation  has  been 
made  for  Kaletra  capsule  between  the  attitude  recommended  with  efavirenz  and  with  these  other 
antiretroviral agents).  
Overall,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  benefit  risk  balance  of  Kaletra  new  tablet  formulation  is 
favourable. This new tablet formulation can be approved with the MAH’s committement to a list of 
follow-up measures. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion  that  pharmacovigilance  activities  in  addition  to  the  use  of  routine  pharmacovigilance  were 
needed  to  investigate  further  some  of  the  safety  concerns  and  additional  risk  minimisation  activities 
were required.

RECOMMENDATION 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Kaletra  film-coated  tablets  in  the  treatment  of  HIV-1 
infected adults and children above the age of 2 years, in combination with other antiretroviral agents 
was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

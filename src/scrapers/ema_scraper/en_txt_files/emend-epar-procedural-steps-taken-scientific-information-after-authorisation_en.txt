1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

MEC-induced nausea and vomiting in a patient population 
with a variety of tumour types who were treated with a 
range of MEC agents).  
In SPC section 4.8 the number of patients in clinical trials 
and the combined data from studies P071 and P130 was 
updated for all strengths. The table presenting the adverse 
reactions observed in either highly emetogenic 
chemotherapy or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy 
studies in patients treated with the aprepitant regimen and 
at a greater incidence than with standard therapy was 
amended with the following adverse reactions with a 
frequency of "uncommon" under the respective System 
Organ Class: palpitation, somnolence and malaise, 
abdominal distension, faeces hard, neutropenic colitis, rash 
pruritic, muscular weakness, chills, gait disturbance, 
neutrophil count decreased and cardiovascular disorder.  
Furthermore, SPC section 5.1 for the 80mg and 125mg 
strengths was updated with efficacy data from clinical study 
P130. 
The package leaflet has been updated accordingly. In 
addition, section 4 of the package leaflet has been revised 
in order to improve the readability following a CHMP 
comment raised with a recently finalised variation 
procedure. Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to 
amend the labelling of the 125/80mg trifold pack as well as

SmPC and PL 
SPC sections 4.4 and 4.5 have been updated based on two 
interaction with tolbutamide and oral contraceptives 
for the 40mg hard capsule based on two clinical 
pharmacology studies.  
In addition, SPC section 4.5 and PL section 2 have 
been revised as requested by CHMP with FUM026 of 
the EMEND renewal in order to simplify the text and 
increase readability. In this context, also in SPC 
section 4.4 an existing warning regarding 
concomitant orally administered active substances 
that are metabolised through CYP3A4 has been 
amended with a list of active substances with a 
narrow therapeutic range for the 80mg and 125mg 
strengths as well as the list of active substances that 
inhibit CYP3A4 activity for all strengths. Moreover, 
additional changes have been implemented in the 
Package Leaflet including an update to the list of 
local representatives. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
new interaction studies evaluating the effect of a 40mg 
single aprepitant oral dose. One study evaluated the effect 
over time on tolbutamide and one study the effect on an 
oral contraceptive.  
In the tolbutamide study the time course and magnitude of 
the induction, when assessed as the change over time from 
baseline, was similar as previously observed for the 3-day 
CINV regimen. However, the parallel placebo group also 
displayed a time dependent change. Hence, the overall 
placebo-corrected change was considerably smaller. 
However, given the unexpected results in the placebo 
group in the new study, it seems more appropriate to 
evaluate the inductive effect of Emend 40mg based on the 
change from baseline in the aprepitant group. Based on 
that, aprepitant 40mg single dose is a moderate inducer of 
CYP2C9 resulting in about 30% reduction in tolbutamide 
exposure. 
Also the oral contraceptive study suggests an inductive 
effect of a single 40mg aprepitant dose. The ethinyl 
estradiol AUC was decreased by 29% on Day 4 after 
aprepitant administration and trough concentrations were 
decreased up to 37%. This is less than the 64% decreased 
in ethinyl estradiol trough concentrations for the 3-day 
CINV regimen, but still suggest clinically relevant induction.

In addition, for all strengths the statement regarding 
concomitant administration with active substances that 
inhibit CYP3A4 activity has been amended in SPC sections 
4.4 and 4.5 with "itraconazol, voriconazol, posaconazol, 
nefazodone"; "ritonavir" was replaced by "protease 
inhibitors". 
Furthermore, for the 80 and 125mg strengths in SPC 
section 4.4 the existing warning regarding active 
substances concomitant orally administered active 
substances that are metabolised primarily through CYP3A4 
has been amended. A list of CYP3A4 substrates with narrow 
therapeutic margin and where caution may be needed in

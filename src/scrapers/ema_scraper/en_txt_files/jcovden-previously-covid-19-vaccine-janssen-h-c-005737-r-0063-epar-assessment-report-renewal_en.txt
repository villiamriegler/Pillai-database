1.  Background information on the annual renewal 
The European Commission issued on 11 March 2021, a conditional marketing authorisation (MA) for 
JCOVDEN. This implied that, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 5 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) has to complete 
ongoing studies, or to conduct new studies, as listed in Annex II.E of the MA, the so-called Specific 
Obligations (SOBs). These data form the basis of the renewal of the conditional MA. 
A conditional MA is valid for one year and may be renewed annually upon request by the MAH. 
Therefore, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 6(2) of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the MAH Janssen-Cilag International N.V., submitted to the Agency on 9 
September 2022 an application for renewal of the conditional MA for JCOVDEN. The expiry date of the 
MA is 11 March 2023. 
The period covered by this annual renewal is 1 August 2021 to 31 July 2022. Final reports addressing 
the remaining quality SOBs were submitted in September and October 2022 and outcome of these 
assessments are considered in this AR (procedures EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0064 and 
MEA/H/C/005737/II/0067).

Converted to a MEA  
Category 3 study in the 
RMP :  
31 December 2023 
Since the granting of the conditional MA (cMA), the MAH has submitted the following SOBs: 
Quality-related SOBs 
The initial SOB included in the conditional marketing authorisation of March 2021, which related to the 
remaining validation and comparability data for the Catalent Bloomington site (US), has already been 
fulfilled previously (21 Oct 2021). 
The following quality-related specific obligations were included in Annex II as part of several variations 
which have been submitted post-approval of the conditional MA to implement additional manufacturing 
sites in the conditional MA: Aspen (South-Africa), IDT Biologika (Germany), Catalent Anagni (Italy), 
Sanofi Pasteur Marcy l’Etoile (France), Merck Sharp & Dohme West Point (US) and Biological E. Limited 
(India) for finished product manufacturing; upgraded facility at Janssen Biologics Leiden (Netherlands) 
and Biological E. Limited (India) for active substance manufacturing. These manufacturing sites were 
also conditionally approved via variation procedures with the specific obligation to provide additional 
validation and comparability data. 
•  SO1: In order to confirm the consistency of the finished product manufacturing process, the 
applicant should provide additional validation and comparability data. 
•  SO2: In order to confirm the consistency of the active substance manufacturing process, the 
applicant should provide additional validation and comparability data. 
For all of the above-mentioned sites, the MAH has provided the remaining validation and comparability 
data as requested in SOB1 and SOB2. The data have been assessed and were found acceptable. 
Accordingly, the specific obligations related to the variations to implement the finished product sites 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/766600/2022  
Page 5/44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Aspen (South-Africa), IDT Biologika (Germany), Catalent Anagni (Italy), Merck Sharp & Dohme West 
Point (US), Sanofi Pasteur Marcy l’Etoile (France) and Biological E. Limited (India) can be considered as 
fulfilled. Also, the specific obligation related to the variation to implement the upgraded active 
substance manufacturing site (upgraded facility) at Janssen Biologics Leiden (Netherlands) can be 
considered as fulfilled, as well as the specific obligation related to the variation to implement the active 
substance manufacturing site Biological E. Limited (India). 
Taken together, whereas SOB1 and SOB2 relate to different manufacturing sites which were either 
proposed in the original conditional MA or post-approval of the conditional MA via variation procedures, 
all data submitted thus far as part of these SOB1 and SOB2 [“In order to confirm the consistency of 
the finished product manufacturing process (SOB1)) or active substance manufacturing process 
(SOB2), the applicant should provide additional validation and comparability data”] were found 
acceptable and confirm that the manufacturing process yields product of adequate and consistent 
quality that complies with its specifications, confirming the validated status of the process.  
In conclusion, all quality-related SOBs have been adequately addressed and can be considered 
resolved. 
Clinical SOB 
The MAH anticipates that the clinical study VAC31518COV3001 can be completed by 31 Dec 2023.  
Considering the vaccination of a large proportion of the control arm and the possibility for all 
participants to be administered with a booster vaccine (JCOVDEN, also referred to as Ad26.COV2.S or 
another approved COVID-19 vaccine) it is considered that the continued follow-up would no longer 
contribute in a significant way to the safety and efficacy profile of JCOVDEN. It is not expected that the 
remaining outstanding data from study VAC31518COV3001 will bring substantial additional 
confirmatory evidence impacting the benefit-risk profile of the vaccine.  The remaining clinical SOB 
may therefore be reclassified as Category 3 study in the RMP, with the final clinical study report (CSR) 
to be submitted at a later stage as supportive data. 
2.2.  Outstanding Specific Obligations – status report for period covered 
All quality-related SOBs have been adequately addressed and can be considered resolved. There are 
no remaining quality-related SOBs.  
The clinical SOB may be reclassified as Category 3 study in the RMP, with the final CSR to be 
submitted at a later stage as supportive data. 
2.3.  Overall conclusion on Specific Obligations 
During the period covered by this annual renewal data on the SOBs have been submitted that overall 
are compliant in terms of adherence to deadlines and are compliant in terms of acceptability of data 
submitted. 
The initial SOB included in the conditional marketing authorisation of March 2021, which related to the 
remaining validation and comparability data for the Catalent Bloomington site (US), has already been 
fulfilled previously. 
The specific obligations related to the variations to implement the finished product sites Aspen (South-
Africa), IDT Biologika (Germany), Catalent Anagni (Italy), Merck Sharp & Dohme West Point (US), 
Sanofi Pasteur Marcy l’Etoile (France) and Biological E. Limited (India) can be considered as fulfilled. 
Also the specific obligation related to the variation to implement the upgraded active substance 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/766600/2022  
Page 6/44 
 
 
 
manufacturing site (upgraded facility) at Janssen Biologics Leiden (Netherlands) can be considered as 
fulfilled, as well as the specific obligation related to the variation to implement the active substance 
manufacturing site Biological E. Limited (India). Thus, all quality-related SOBs have been adequately 
addressed and can be considered resolved.  
The clinical SOB can be reclassified as a Category 3 study in the RMP with a final CSR to be submitted 
at a later stage as supportive data. The SOB can be considered fulfilled and can be deleted from the 
Annex II. 
In conclusion, as part of this annual renewal the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality and clinical SOBs 
can therefore be deleted from Annex II. 
3.  Additional scientific data provided relevant for the 
assessment of the benefit/risk balance 
3.1.  Quality 
At time of approval of the conditional MA, a list of 14 recommendations (REC) (post-authorisation 
measures, PAM) was included. 
Apart from the SOBs, the applicant has also provided additional quality data related to the following 
RECs:  
REC 30: validation data of the third process validation inoculum batch produced at Janssen Biologics 
B.V. (Leiden, NL). 
REC 33: evaluate the sensitivity of Ad26.COV2.S FP when exposed to light stress, a study based on the 
ICH Q1B requirement should be performed. The samples should be tested for potency by QPA, 
turbidity by A350, radius by DLS and aggregation by AF4-MALS. 
REC 37: results of the 6 month time point of the FP container leachables study. 
REC 39: remaining PPQ data and tier 2 comparability data to confirm that the 700L scale process at 
GRAM (US) is appropriately validated and yields DP that is comparable to the DP from the registered 
DP sites. 
All recommendations have been adequately addressed by the MAH, except for two Recommendations 
related to stability test results (to be provided when the stability studies have been finalised in 2024). 
However, based on the currently available stability data, it is deemed acceptable and sufficient if the 
MAH informs the Agency in case any Out-Of Specification (OOS) results are observed for the ongoing 
stability studies. As such, there are no remaining quality PAMs- recommendations. 
3.2.  Non-clinical 
During the reporting period of this annual renewal application, final study results of non-clinical studies 
conducted to characterize the potential mechanism underlying vaccine associated thrombosis with 
thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), Thrombocytopenia, including immune thrombocytipenia (ITP) 
and/or Venous thromboembolism (VTE) have become available. The available nonclinical studies 
provided relevant data that can be used to put published data into perspective and/or possibly 
deprioritize some aspects of the proposed hypotheses or underlying mechanisms but the data do not

allow to conclude on a final pathogenesis mechanism of vaccine-induced TTS. This data was assessed 
in procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/047/G. 
3.3.  Clinical immunogenicity and efficacy 
During the covering period of this annual renewal application, new efficacy and immunogenicity data 
relevant to the initially approved indication have emerged. The indication has also been extended to 
include a posology for the use of JCOVDEN as homologous booster or heterologous booster following 
completion of primary vaccination with a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine or an adenoviral vector-based 
COVID-19 vaccine.  
Regulatory procedures are summarised below. 
Regulatory procedures impacting the Summary of Products Characteristics (SmPC) 
•  EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0033: Addition of a booster posology (homologous and heterologous 
following vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine) based on interim efficacy and 
immunogenicity results from different clinical studies including the two randomized, double 
blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies VAC31518COV3001 and VAC31518COV3009; and 
interim results from the phase 1/2 study DMID 21-0012. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to update the efficacy data for the primary vaccination schedule based on the end of 
the double-blind phase, which corresponds to the final analysis from study VAC31518COV3001.  
•  EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0053 – Procedure was approved outside the annual renewal period: 
Addition of heterologous booster posology following priming with another adenoviral vector-

mRNA as their primary vaccination and a 
booster dose was not foreseen for the 
general population at that time. 
Warnings and Precaution for ITP. 
PRAC request in final assessment report 
August 2021 MSSR (procedure number 
MEA 014.5) to submit label update for 
TM. A minor update to Section 4.4 of the 
SmPC related to TTS was also 
requested. 
HA request: statement/analysis on the 
benefit-risk ratio in younger adults, 
particularly with regards to VTE, 
including risk minimisation measures. 
EMA request as part of ongoing 
procedure II/18 to include 
thrombocytopenia (incl. ITP) as an 
important identified risk in the EU RMP. 
Contraindication for TTS. 
EMA request as part of procedure 
EMEA/H/C/005737/II/33 (update to 
the EUPI to introduce a booster dose) to 
include a contraindication for individuals 
who have experienced TTS following 
Submission of response to EMA 
(EMEA/H/C/005737/SDA/031). Based on data and 
literature review, there was insufficient evidence to 
conclude that MIS is causally associated with the 
use of Ad26.COV2.S. Therefore, no proposed 
revisions to EU RMP and EUPI. 
Procedure number: EMA/H/C/5737/IB/0027. 
Submission of a SmPC update to include VTE in 
Section 4.4 and 4.8. A favourable notification was 
received from EMA on 08 Oct 2021. Submissions to 
other HA’s were made in line with local 
requirements. 
Submission of Type II variation (procedure no 
EMEA/H/C/5737/II/0029) to EMA including an EU 
RMP update reclassifying VTE from an important 
potential risk to an important identified risk. 
Type II variation submitted to Swissmedic to 
update Swiss product information with text in the 
Warnings and Precaution section for CLS and ITP 
and including CLS and dizziness as ADRs. Company 
rationale for not including text in Warnings and 
Precautions for VTE and for not including ITP and 
VTE as ADRs was accepted by Swissmedic. 
Study not conducted in Spain. 
Amendment to the factsheets to propose a warning 
and precaution for ITP 
Type II variation (procedure number 
EMEA/H/C/5737/II/0035) submitted to EMA to 
update Section 4.4 and 4.8 of the EUPI with 
information on TM. An update requested by EMA 
related to TTS was also included: These cases 
occurred within the first 3 weeks following 
vaccination, and mostly in individuals under 60 
years of age. HA submissions in other 
countries/territories were made in line with local 
requirements. 
Submission of response to Swissmedic request. 
Approved indication remained unchanged. 
Updated version of the EU RMP submitted to EMA in 
the context of ongoing procedure II/18. 
US factsheets were updated for contraindications, 
warnings, and precautions for TTS. In addition, the 
overall safety summary including SAEs and other 
EOIs was updated. Relevant updates were made to 
the recipient and caregivers’ factsheet. 
An updated EUPI, including the requested 
contraindication, was submitted to EMA as part of 
procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/33. This variation

ANVISA has requested to add to local 
labelling the following ADRs: TM, facial 
paralysis, photophobia, and eye pain 
after evaluating RMP submitted. 
The following HA Request was received 
on 21 Jan 2022; “All applicants of 
COVID-19 vaccines must submit an 
assessment on menstrual disorders 
reported with the use of their COVID-19 
vaccine.” 
Request accepted by the Company and local 
labelling has been updated accordingly. 
Response was submitted on 04 Feb 2022, referring 
to reviews presented in previous MSSRs, and 
routine PV continued after that as agreed with EMA. 
It was concluded that there is insufficient evidence 
to support an association between menstrual 
disorders or post-menopausal haemorrhage and the 
Ad26.COV2.S. 
Final PRAC assessment report of the Oct 
2021 MSSR (MEA 014.7) contained a 
request to update the EUPI regarding 
‘small vessel vasculitis with cutaneous 
manifestations.’ 
Company position on this request was included in 
the Bimonthly SSR (01 Nov 2021 to 15 Jan 2022) 
submission. The MAH provided justification on not 
adding ‘small vessel vasculitis with cutaneous 
manifestations’ in the EUPI. 
A conditional approval was received by 
the Belgian HA (FAMHP) for protocol 
amendment 15 for the 
VAC31518COV1001 study. The condition 
by FAMHP was to restrict the age for the 
booster doses in the trial according to 
national recommendations. A booster 
can only be administered to participants 
≥65 years of age. 
A country specific protocol amendment is being 
prepared to address the request by FAMHP. The 
request concerns also Study VAC31518COV3009. A 
DIL is prepared to be distributed at the sites to 
raise awareness among the Investigators. For the 
COV1001 the PA15 was submitted to FAGG on 07 
March 2022 and approval received on 18 March 
2022. For the VAC31518COV3009 the DIL was

A pooled analysis of the double-blind 
phase of 5 clinical trials conducted by 
the MAH at the time of the preparation 
of the PBRER (period: 25 Aug 2021 to 
24 Feb 2022), showed a numerical 
imbalance between Ad26.COV2.S and 
placebo for facial paralysis/Bell’s palsy. A 
cumulative assessment of available 
safety data has been carried out as a 
result of this imbalance and is presented 
in this PBRER. Based on the totality of 
the data, the MAH has concluded there 
is a reasonable possibility of a causal 
association between Ad26.COV2.S and 
facial paralysis/Bell’s palsy.

(5×1010 vp, 2.5×1010 vp, or 1×1010 vp) in adults aged 18 years or older, who have previously received 
primary vaccination in Trial VAC31518COV3001 (Cohort 1: homologous booster) or who previously 
received primary vaccination with the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine (Cohort 2: heterologous booster). 
MAH Safety Summary (cut-off date of 15 December 2021) 
The results from the descriptive safety and reactogenicity analyses showed that booster vaccination 
with Ad26.COV2.S at the 5×1010 vp, 2.5×1010 vp, and 1×1010 vp dose levels had an acceptable safety 
and reactogenicity profile, with no safety issues identified. In general, a less reactogenicity was 
observed in the homologous boosting regimen compared to the heterologous boosting. 
Up to the cut-off date, no deaths were reported in the trial. Overall, SAEs were reported in 4 
participants after the homologous booster vaccination (PTs: Myocardial infarction, Systemic 
inflammatory response syndrome, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Multiple fractures, Atrial 
fibrillation, and Giant cell arteritis) and for 5 participants after the heterologous booster vaccination 
(PTs: Asthenia, Headache, Nausea, Fatigue, Myalgia, Bipolar disorder, Pancreatitis, Suicidal ideation, 
and Asthma). There were no related SAEs reported after the homologous booster vaccination, whereas 
1 participant was reported with a related SAEs after the heterologous booster vaccination. 
A total of 6 AEs of thrombocytopenia were reported in 5 participants, with onset within 19 days after 
the homologous booster vaccination. Of these 6 AEs of thrombocytopenia, 5 AEs were reported for 
participants that received a 2.5×1010 vp dose level and 1 event was reported in a participant that 
received the 5×1010 vp dose level (this event was considered to be a laboratory error). Two AEs of 
Grade 3 severity were considered related to the study vaccination. All the AEs of thrombocytopenia 
were resolved or resolving at the time of this report. 
In conclusion, up to the cut-off date, the results from the descriptive safety and reactogenicity 
analyses showed that the booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S at the 5×1010vp, 2.5×1010 vp, and 
1×1010 vp dose levels had an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile with no safety issues 
identified. In general, a less reactogenicity was observed after the homologous booster vaccination 
than the heterologous booster vaccination. Also, a lower reactogenicity was observed in older adults 
(aged ≥60 years) than in younger adults (aged ≥18 to 59 years). 
According to MAH, no new safety concerns have been identified after an Ad26.COV2.S 
homologous/heterologous booster dose.

MAH Safety Summary (cut-off date of 9 July 2021) 
The final analysis of the double-blind phase of Trial VAC31518COV3001 until cut-off date, confirms the 
established safety profile of Ad26.COV2.S. 
The single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5×1010 vp has an acceptable safety and 
reactogenicity profile in adults aged 18 years of age and older, including adults aged 60 years and 
older. No significant safety issues were identified.  
In the double-blind phase, 83 participants with at least 1 fatal AEs were reported: 28 in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group and 55 in the placebo group. During the entire trial, 100 participants with 1 or 
more fatal AEs were reported, of which 40 occurred in participants who received Ad26.COV2.S. Four 
deaths were reported after the open-label vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. One of these events was 
considered related to the study vaccine by the investigator. This participant was reported to have a 
Grade 4 pulmonary embolism 57 days after the open-label vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. 
During the entire trial, 19 participants were reported a total of 21 SAEs which were considered to be 
related to the study vaccine by the investigator: 19 events (reported in 18 participants) in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group (3 cases of ischemic stroke, 2 cases of Bell’s palsy, 2 cases of pulmonary 
embolism, 2 cases of deep vein thrombosis, GBS, venous thrombosis limb, retinal vein thrombosis, 
atrial fibrillation, pericarditis, complex regional pain syndrome, post-vaccination syndrome, 
hypersensitivity, headache, and asthma) and 2 events (reported in 1 participant) in the placebo group 
(Epstein–Barr virus infection and atrial flutter). 
One SAE of thromboembolic event with thrombocytopenia (venous transverse sinus thrombosis and 
cerebral haemorrhage) was reported following the administration of Ad26.COV2.S, and it was 
confirmed as a TTS meeting both the Level 1 criteria using the Brighton Collaboration level of certainty 
and the CDC definition for a tier 1 TTS case and could therefore be confirmed as a TTS according to 
both case definitions. 
The following AEs of interest had a numerical imbalance between the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo group: 
tinnitus, seizures, and embolic and thrombotic events. Tinnitus was considered an adverse reaction. 
Further review of events of seizure and embolic and thrombotic events revealed that the majority had 
predisposing, underlying medical conditions, and these were not considered safety concerns upon the 
further evaluation; the number of events contributing to the imbalance was small, and these 
imbalances were not observed in Trial VAC31518COV3009. A limited number of MAAEs of at least 
Grade 3, none of which were considered as a safety issue, and no events of anaphylaxis were reported 
in the Ad26.COV2.S group. 
According to MAH, no new safety concerns have been identified after an Ad26.COV2.S primary dose. 
• 
Trial VAC31518COV3003 
This is a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind trial to evaluate 6 dose levels of Ad26.COV2.S 
administered as a 2-dose schedule in healthy adults aged 18 to 55 years, inclusive. This trial consists 
of 2 parts: main trial and sub trial. In the main trial, the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of 
1 dose (dose 1 of the 2-dose regimen) and 2 doses of Ad26.COV2.S will be evaluated. In the sub trial, 
additional adult participants aged 18 to 55 years will be enrolled (into study groups 1, 3, 5, and 6) to 
further characterise the innate, pro-inflammatory, and other relevant (e.g., pro-thrombotic) responses 
to Ad26.COV2.S to better understand a possible risk to thrombosis with TTS events. According to MAH 
no significant safety findings were identified from this trial during the renewal reporting period.

Page 18/44 
 
 
 
This is a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel, multicentre trial to evaluate safety, 
reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S co-administered with a seasonal quadrivalent 
(standard-dose or high-dose) influenza vaccine. A standard-dose influenza vaccine administered in 
participants aged between 18 and 64 years and high-dose influenza vaccine administered in 
participants aged 65 years of age and older compared to administration of each vaccine separately to 
explore whether Ad26.COV2.S and the influenza vaccines can be administered concomitantly. 
According to MAH, no significant safety findings were identified from this trial during the renewal 
reporting period. 
• 
Trial VAC31518COV3006 
This is a Phase 2/3, randomised, observer-blind, pivotal, adaptive trial to evaluate the safety, 
reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of different dose levels of Ad26.COV2.S administered as a 1- or 2-
dose regimen (56-day interval) in healthy adolescents aged 12 to 17 years inclusive. According to MAH 
no significant safety findings were identified from this trial during the renewal reporting period. 
• 
Trial VAC31518COV3009 
This is a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, pivotal efficacy and safety 
trial in adults ≥18 years of age. The efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S is being 
evaluated in participants living in, or going to, locations with high risk for acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 
infection after administration of 2 doses of study vaccine. Additionally, participants from the placebo 
arm enrolled during the double-blind phase have been offered to receive a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S 
(open-label vaccination), unless they met certain vaccination discontinuation rules during the 
double-blind phase of the trial. At present time, the open-label phase of the trial is extended to include 
an open-label booster vaccination with a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S to all participants that have 
received only single dose of Ad26COV2.S in the trial. 
MAH Safety Summary (cut-off date of 25 June 2021) 
The final analysis of the double-blind phase of Trial VAC31518COV3009 with a cut-off date, confirms 
the established safety profile of Ad26.COV2.S. 
The 2-dose schedule of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5×1010 vp has an acceptable safety and 
reactogenicity profile in adults aged 18 years and older, including adults aged and 60 years older. No 
significant safety issues were identified. In general, a lower reactogenicity was observed in older adults 
compared to younger adults in this analysis. 
Up to the cut-off date, 17 deaths were reported during the double-blind phase: 4 in the Ad26.COV2.S 
group and 13 in the placebo group. 
Serious AEs were reported in 240 participants (104 [0.7%] participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 
136 [0.9%] participants in the placebo group). No increase in the frequency of SAEs was observed 
post-booster compared with the post-dose 1. A total of 98 (0.6%) participants reported SAEs not 
associated with COVID-19 in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared with 104 (0.7%) participants in the 
placebo group. A total of 8 (0.1%) participants reported SAEs associated with COVID-19 in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group compared with 36 (0.2%) participants in the placebo group. 
Related SAEs were reported in 8 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 3 participants in the 
placebo group. In the Ad26.COV2.S group, after the first dose, the related SAEs were pyrexia, 
pericarditis, allergy to vaccine, and haemoptysis in 1 participant each, and injection-site swelling 
vertigo, and myocardial necrosis marker increased in 1 participant. Related SAEs after the booster 
dose were facial paresis, pulmonary embolism, and cerebrovascular accident in 1 participant each.

Literature 
A search of the scientific literature using various databases MEDLINE® Embase® was performed to 
capture information that had a potential impact on the benefit-risk of Ad26.COV2.S. The MAH informs 
that if they become aware of new safety/efficacy information from unpublished abstracts/manuscripts 
these would also be considered for evaluation and the findings will be discussed. 
The MAH identified a total of 25 publications of interest: 18 product specific and 7 related to class 
effect. Most of these articles provide additional data to further characterise the safety concerns (e.g. 
thrombosis at unusual sites, exacerbation of immune thrombocytopenia, use in pregnancy and while 
breastfeeding,  Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, use in  patients with 
comorbidities ). Other articles provided supportive information for the assessment of safety signals 
that have been discussed in the context of other procedures such as PSUR or SSR (e.g. tinnitus, small 
cell vasculitis, Bell’s palsy, pericarditis and myocarditis). 
Overall, from the literature provided by the MAH, no new safety issues were identified during the 
annual renewal reporting period that had an impact on the benefit-risk balance of Ad26.COV2.S.

3.2.  Discussion  
The  safety  profile  of  the  primary  vaccination  with  Ad26.COV2.S  in  adults  aged  18  years  and  older 
described  in  the  current  SmPC  is  based  on  a  primary  pooled  analysis  of  clinical  safety  data  from  the 
double-blind phase of Phase 3 studies (VAC31518COV3001 and VAC31518COV3009) and of Phase 1 and 
Phase  2  clinical  studies  (VAC31518COV1001,  VAC31518COV1002,  VAC31518COV2001)  with 
Ad26.COV2.S  5×1010  vp  (18  November  2021)  (procedure  EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0060  approved  after 
renewal  reporting  interval),  and  on  post-marketing  data  which  became  available  following  the  initial 
authorization of the vaccine (from launch up to 31 July 2022, it is estimated that over 52 million doses 
of Ad26.COV2.S were administered worldwide). 
The  safety  profile  of  the  booster  dose  has  been  assessed  in  procedure  EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0053/G 
(approved  after  renewal  reporting  interval):  homologous  booster,  and  heterologous  booster  following 
completion of primary vaccination regimen with a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or adenoviral vector-based 
COVID-19 vaccine. 
The most recent clinical AdVac safety database report (V7.0, dated 1 July 2022) has been assessed in 
the  PAM  EMEA/H/C/005737/REC/019.1  (approved  after  renewal  reporting  interval).  A  total  of  48,744 
participants  have  been  vaccinated  with  an  Ad26-based  vaccine  in  42  clinical  studies  that  have  been 
integrated  in  the  AdVac  Safety  Database  V7  (cut-off  date  of  31  December  2021).  They  were  mainly 
adults (47,944 adults) and from COVID-19 vaccine studies (39,623 adults: 21,898 in VAC31518COV3001 
and 15,707 in VAC31518COV3009). 
During the renewal reporting interval, changes in the known safety concerns or newly identified safety 
issues resulting in an update to the EU RMP for Ad26.COV2.S. are summarised in the table below:

Annual Renewal Reporting Period (01 August 2021 to 31 July 2022) 
Overall, review of ongoing clinical trial data and post-marketing experience collected during the annual 
renewal period does not modify the positive benefit-risk profile of Ad26.COV2.S.

4.  Risk management plan 
The MAH has confirmed the current approved RMP (version 4.2 dated 07 July 2022) remains 
unchanged and applicable. 
As described above, based on the data submitted with the renewal application, the CHMP is of the view 
that no changes to the summary of safety concerns listed in the RMP are warranted. The remaining 
clinical SOB may therefore be reclassified as category 3 study in the RMP, with the final CSRs to be 
submitted at a later stage as supportive data. Thus, as an outcome of the renewal procedure, the MAH 
is requested to submit an updated RMP at the next regulatory opportunity. 
5.  Changes to the Product Information 
The Annexes I, II and III were amended to reflect the granting of a marketing authorisation not 
subject to Specific Obligations for JCOVDEN (see Attachment 1). 
Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, JCOVDEN is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in 
any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
6.  Overall conclusions and benefit-risk balance 
6.1.  Specific Obligations (SOBs) 
Compliance of SOB data submitted 
Quality-related SOBs 
During the period covered by this annual renewal data on the SOBs have been submitted that overall 
are compliant in terms of adherence to deadlines and are compliant in terms of acceptability of data 
submitted. 
The initial SOB included in the conditional marketing authorisation of March 2021, which related to the 
remaining validation and comparability data for the Catalent Bloomington site (US), has already been 
fulfilled previously. 
The following quality-related specific obligations were included in Annex II as part of several variations 
which have been submitted post-approval of the conditional MA to implement additional manufacturing 
sites in the conditional MA: Aspen (South-Africa), IDT Biologika (Germany), Catalent Anagni (Italy), 
Sanofi Pasteur Marcy l’Etoile (France), Merck Sharp & Dohme West Point (US) and Biological E. Limited 
(India) for finished product manufacturing; upgraded facility at Janssen Biologics Leiden (Netherlands), 
and Biological E. Limited (India) for active substance manufacturing. These manufacturing sites were 
also conditionally approved via variation procedures with the specific obligation to provide additional

validation and comparability data. 
•  SOB1: In order to confirm the consistency of the finished product manufacturing process, the 
applicant should provide additional validation and comparability data. 
•  SOB2: In order to confirm the consistency of the active substance manufacturing process, the 
applicant should provide additional validation and comparability data. 
For all of the above mentioned sites, the MAH has provided the remaining validation and comparability 
data as requested in SOB1 and SOB2. The data have been assessed and were found acceptable. 
Accordingly, the specific obligations related to the variations to implement the finished product sites 
Aspen (South-Africa), IDT Biologika (Germany), Catalent Anagni (Italy), Merck Sharp & Dohme West 
Point (US), Sanofi Pasteur Marcy l’Etoile (France) and Biological E. Limited (India) can be considered as 
fulfilled. Also the specific obligation related to the variation to implement the upgraded active 
substance manufacturing site (upgraded facility) at Janssen Biologics Leiden (Netherlands) can be 
considered as fulfilled, as well as the specific obligation related to the variation to implement the active 
substance manufacturing site Biological E. Limited (India). 
In conclusion, all quality-related SOBs have been adequately addressed and can be considered 
resolved. 
An overview of the conditions and specific obligations submitted since the granting of marketing 
authorisation to date is presented below. In addition, a type IA to remove the exemption for the EU 
testing activities has been approved on 30 July 2021.

The MAH anticipates that the study VAC31518COV3001 can be completed by 31 Dec 2023. The clinical 
safety profile, as well as the efficacy of this product, is considered comprehensively characterised and 
supports a positive benefit-risk balance. It is not expected that the remaining outstanding data in the 
final CSR of VAC31518COV3001 will bring substantial additional confirmatory evidence impacting the 
benefit-risk profile of JCOVDEN. The clinical SOB may therefore be reclassified as category 3 studies in 
the RMP and deleted from Annex II, with the final CSRs to be submitted at a later stage as supportive 
data. 
Conversion of the Specific Obligations (SOBs) to Category 3 studies in the 
RMP (MEAs) 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the comprehensive existing data package for this vaccine warrants 
conversion of the current conditional approval into a marketing authorisation not subject to specific 
obligations. The clinical SOB 003 is reclassified as category 3 study in the RMP with the final CSR to be 
submitted at a later stage as supportive data.

During the period covered by this annual renewal, new data have emerged. However, these data do 
not have an impact on the benefit-risk of JCOVDEN in the approved indication(s). 
The data collected as part of the specific obligations for JCOVDEN during the period covered by this

Main clinical studies:  
The main evidence of safety, efficacy and immunogenicity for the initial conditional MA originated from 
five studies. These included three Phase 1/2 studies evaluating the immunogenicity and safety of 
Ad26.COV2.S (COV1001, COV1002, and COV2001) and two large Phase 3 trials evaluating the efficacy, 
safety, and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S. The efficacy trials VAC31518COV3001 and 
VAC31518COV3009 assessed respectively a single- and a two-dose schedule (two months apart) vs. 
placebo in adults.  
Only efficacy data from VAC31518COV3001 (single-dose schedule) were available at conditional MA. At 
that time, data from the primary analysis (cut-off date 22 January 2021) have been submitted. Data 
from the final analysis of the double-blind phase (cut-off date 9 July 2021) were submitted in the 
booster EMEA/H/C/005737/II/33. 
Efficacy and immunogenicity data from COV3009 were submitted in procedure 
EMEA/H/C/005737/II/33, and presented up to the end of the double-blind phase, which corresponds to 
the primary/final analysis (cut-off date 25 June 2021).  
In the PAM procedure 053-067 and in EMEA/H/C/005737/II/53/G (which is approved outside the 
period covered by this annual renewal), updated sequencing data were provided for 
VAC31518COV3001 and VAC31518COV3009, as well as updated analyses of efficacy by variant, but 
still not based on complete genome sequencing data. Analyses based on complete genome sequencing 
data are still to be finalized. 
Efficacy data for the Delta period (open label phase) were provided for both efficacy studies (PAM 
procedure 053-067). 
Trial VAC31518COV3001 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study conducted in 
adults 18 years of age and older in the US, several Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, 
Peru, Mexico, Colombia), and South Africa. Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp or placebo intramuscularly. A total of 43,783 randomised 
participants received Ad26.COV2.S (n=21,895) or a placebo (n=21,888).  
Trial VAC31518COV3009 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study conducted in 
adults 18 years of age and older, in Europe, South Africa, the US and Latin America and Asia. A total of 
31,300 participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive Ad26.COV2.S (5x1010 vp, n=15,708) as 
a two-dose schedule given 56 days apart or placebo (n=15,592) intramuscularly.  
In both studies, participants who became eligible to receive an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine 
according to local recommendation could request to be individually unblinded. In addition, shortly 
following EUA in the US (on February 27, 2021), participants were systematically unblinded and those 
who originally received placebo were offered a single dose of the vaccine. A large proportion of the 
participants also received (booster) vaccination with other authorized vaccines. Furthermore, after 
authorization of the use of Ad26.COV2.S as booster (20 October 2021 in the US, 16 December 2021 in 
the EU), a 1-dose booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S was offered to ongoing participants in study 
VAC31518COV3001 and to ongoing participants who received only a single vaccination with 
Ad26.COV2.S in VAC31518COV3009. This resulted in a short follow up time up in the blind phase of 
both studies. In addition, in VAC31518COV3009, a large proportion (about half) of the subjects did not 
receive their second dose yet when unblinding occurred and therefore were not included in the per 
protocol (PP) set. 
Results from academic studies (DMID 21-0012, COV-BOOST) were supportive for the use of 
Ad26.COV2.S as homologous booster or as heterologous booster following completion of primary

by this annual renewal). 
Favourable effects 
Efficacy of a single dose: 
The clinical trial VAC31518COV3001 assessed a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S in multiple countries. 
There was a high diversity of variants amongst cases, without a dominant variant. Efficacy against 
moderate/severe COVID-19 (onset >14 days after vaccination) was 67% (adjusted 95% CI: 59.0; 
73.4) and 56% (95% CI: 51.3; 60.8) respectively over a 2 months (primary analysis, cut-off date 22 
January 2021) and a 4 months (final analysis of the double-blind phase, cut-off date 9 July 2021) 
median follow-up (FU) period, in SARS-COV-2 seronegative individuals. 
In participants 65 years of age and older, efficacy against moderate/severe COVID-19 (onset >14 days 
after vaccination) was 82% (95% CI: 63.9; 92.4) and 64% (95% CI: 48.9; 60.2) respectively over a 2 
months and a 4 months median FU period.  
Number of cases and efficacy estimates were consistent when using the US FDA Harmonized (CDC) 
COVID-19 case definition or when using the endpoint ‘symptomatic COVID-19’ cases which include 
cases classified as either mild, or moderate to severe/critical, supporting an indication against COVID-
19 of any severity. For this reason, ‘COVID-19’ is used in the SmPC section 5.1 to describe the primary 
outcome of the study.  
The cumulative incidence curves of molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 cases 
(Kaplan Meier) suggest that the onset of protection is around Day 14 post-vaccination. 
Efficacy against severe disease was demonstrated. Of the 116 vs. 348 primary endpoint cases with an 
onset at least 14 days after vaccination in the vaccine vs. placebo group respectively, 14 (12%) vs. 60 
(17%) were classified as severe/critical (further referred to as severe, also in the SmPC). The point 
estimate of VE against severe disease was 77% (adjusted 95% CI: 54.6; 89.1) and 73% (95% CI: 
63.9; 80.5), over a median follow up of approximately 2 and 4 months respectively, in SARS-COV-2 
seronegative subjects.  
Of the 14 vs. 60 severe cases with onset at least 14 days after vaccination in the Ad26.COV2.S group 
vs. placebo group, 2 vs. 6 were hospitalised. Three died (all in the placebo group). Most of the 
remaining cases only fulfilled the oxygen saturation (SpO2) criterion for severe disease (SpO2<93%). 
For many cases this was based on self-measured abnormal oxygen saturation episodes (at home). All 
cases were adjudicated by an independent committee of clinical experts.  
In the PP analysis set, 40% of the participants had at least one comorbidity, the most common being 
obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2, 28%), hypertension (10%) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (7.5%). Only 
participants with stable conditions were enrolled. Efficacy against molecularly confirmed moderate to 
severe/critical COVID-19 was observed both in participants with and without comorbidities. 
Efficacy of a single dose by variants: 
In VAC31518COV3001, efficacy against moderate/severe COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days after 
vaccination by variant was estimated based on sequencing data of approximately 90% of the cases. 
Efficacy against moderate/severe COVID-19 against the reference strain and the Alpha variant was 
good (point estimate approx. 70%). The efficacy point estimate was also good for the Zeta/P2 variant 
(point estimate approx. 65%). However, efficacy point estimates suggest very poor or lacking efficacy 
for other variants (Beta, Gamma, Mu, Lambda).  
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/766600/2022  
Page 36/44 
 
 
 
The limited data for the Delta variant also point to a signal of lack of efficacy (point estimate -6%, 
based on 11 vs 10 cases in the Ad26.COV2.S group vs the placebo group), which was confirmed by 
additional analyses for the period when the Delta variant was predominant (01 July to 21 September 
2021, open label phase of VAC31518COV3001).  
Efficacy against severe COVID-19 could be estimated for some variants and data suggest that efficacy 
is maintained with point estimates above 60% (for the variants for which sufficient data were 
available, i.e. reference, Beta, Gamma, Mu).  
Immunogenicity: 
Ad26.COV2.S elicits both humoral and cellular immune responses as early as 14 days after 1 dose of 
Ad26.COV2.S, in both young and older adults.  
A homologous booster dose of Ad26.COV2.S, given at 2, 3 or 6 months post-primary vaccination, 
induces an increase in both neutralizing and binding antibodies (Ab) against the original strain and 
variants of concern, when compared to pre-boost values, both in young and older adults.  
A heterologous boost by Ad26.COV2.S induces an increase in both neutralizing and binding Ab against 
the original strain and the Delta variant (binding Ab), when compared to pre-boost values in subjects 
vaccinated with two doses of an mRNA vaccine approximately 3 months before. 
Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Efficacy of a two-dose schedule: 
The clinical trial VAC31518COV3009 assessed a 2-dose schedule given 56 days apart vs placebo in 
multiple countries. Alpha and Mu were the two dominant variants. Several important limitations have 
been identified in trial VAC31518COV3009. Given the huge discrepancy between the FAS and the PP 
(approximately half of the subjects were excluded from the PP set), the analysis cannot be considered 
as resulting from a randomized comparison. In addition, data from this trial raise concern with respect 
to awareness of treatment allocation. The very short FU period post-dose 2 in trial VAC31518COV3009 
considerably limits the interpretation of the results.  
Efficacy of two doses of Ad26.COV2.S administered two months apart was 75% (95% CI: 54.6; 87.3) 
against moderate/severe COVID-19 (onset >14 days post-dose 2) over a median FU period of 36 days. 
For severe COVID-19 cases, high efficacy (100.0%; 95% CI: 32.62; 100.00) was observed in 
VAC31518COV3009, but the number of events is very limited (0 vs. 8), and the lower limit of the 95% 
CI is very low.  
Large regional differences in terms of efficacy were observed, possibly driven by certain SARS-CoV-2 
variants. In the last analysis submitted (procedure PAM 053-067), analyses post-dose 2 were provided 
and were based on complete sequencing data for the blinded phase. However, post-dose 1 data are 
still incomplete. There are limited data by SARS-CoV-2 variants for the two-dose schedule. VE 
estimates (95% CI) against moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 were 84% (43.8; 97.0) and 54% (-
48.0; 87.6) for the Alpha and for the Mu (B.1.621) variants, respectively. Efficacy could not be 
estimated for other variants in VAC31518COV3009, due to insufficient numbers. No efficacy data are 
available for the Delta (4 and 3 cases in the Ad26.COV2.S and in the placebo group respectively). 
Efficacy as a (homologous or heterologous) booster: 
There are no efficacy/effectiveness data on Ad26.COV2.S when used as a heterologous booster.  
The efficacy of a second (homologous booster) dose was not studied as none of the trials was designed 
to make any direct comparison between a two-dose and a single-dose schedule.  
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/766600/2022  
Page 37/44 
 
 
 
Efficacy data are available for a single and for 2-dose schedule with 2 months interval from separate 
trials. The efficacy point estimate was numerically higher in VAC31518COV3009 assessing a 2-dose 
schedule compared to the point estimate in trial VAC31518COV3001 assessing a single dose, but CIs 
widely overlap. Comparison of data across the Phase 3 trials suggest that a second dose administered 
at 2 months might increase the level of efficacy against COVID-19, including for variants. However, 
due to several sources of uncertainty, no conclusion could be drawn on the clinical added value (and 
magnitude of) a booster (second) dose of Ad26.COV2.S vs. a single dose. Data suggests that the 
increment in terms of protection could be limited.  
Efficacy against the Omicron variant: 
Omicron was not circulating during the double-blind period of both trials, therefore there is no efficacy 
data for this variant. 
Effectiveness data by variant: 
Only limited real world effectiveness (RWE) data are available after the use of JCOVDEN as primary 
vaccination or boost during the Alpha, Delta and Omicron predominant periods. RWE during the 
Omicron period was evaluated in EMEA/H/C/005737/II/53/G, which is approved after the period 
covered by this annual renewal. 
In the period when the Alpha variant was mainly circulating, vaccine effectiveness after one dose of 
Ad26.COV2.S was overall in line with vaccine efficacy against any variant in the pivotal trial 
VAC31518COV3001 at time of conditional MA with a 2 months follow-up period.  
During the Delta period, effectiveness of Ad26.COV2.S against mild to severe COVID-19 was evaluated 
based on RWE data from a Company-sponsored study in the US (COV4002), a collaborative study in 
South-Africa (Sisonke) and published RWE studies throughout the world (US, Puerto Rico, South-
Africa, The Netherlands, Spain, Austria and Germany). One dose of Ad26.COV2.S induces overall good 
protection against severe disease, including COVID-19 related hospitalisation, ICU admissions and 
death, similar to other/previously circulating variants. For asymptomatic infection or mild disease, 
protection of vaccination is overall low, but data of different studies are somewhat inconsistent. 
Important to consider when interpreting the data is that VE against the VOC usually refers to VE during 
a period when that VOC was dominant or emerging, which implies that VE estimates obtained may also 
be affected by other circulating variants. Finally, many limitations related to RWE data are contributing 
to differences between study results, which should therefore be considered cautiously. 
Duration of protection after a single dose: 
Efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 was assessed over a 4 months median FU period (data up to 6 
months post-vaccination) in study VAC31518COV3001. A drop of efficacy was observed rapidly after a 
single dose (a few weeks following vaccination), in parallel with the progressive disappearance of the 
reference strain and emergence of several variants.  
In contrast, no drop of efficacy against severe COVID-19 was observed at least up to 6 months 
following a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S. Efficacy was maintained despite the emergence of diverse 
variants.  
Persistence of efficacy beyond 6 months after a single dose is not known, as efficacy data are not 
available after this timepoint. 
Efficacy of a two-dose schedule was studied over a very short time of FU period of 36 days post-dose 
2. No data will be available thereafter. 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/766600/2022  
Page 38/44 
 
 
 
RWE data are currently insufficient to conclude about the duration of protection and potential waning of 
effectiveness after one or two doses of Ad26.COV2.S, as long-term VE data are lacking. However, RWE 
suggest that waning of protection from hospitalised disease seems to be limited up to approximately 6-
7 months after vaccination with a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S.  
Immunogenicity: 
No immunological correlate of protection has been established.  
Neutralizing and binding Ab levels after one vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S appear to be sustained up to 
at least 6 months. There is no clear decrease over time. A minor, and not systematic, trend for decreased 
Ab levels is observed at the later timepoints (6 or 8-9 months post-vaccination) when compared to earlier 
timepoints (1 or 2 months post-vaccination).  
The humoral immune responses elicited by a booster dose was only investigated before 
immunogenicity started to wane (i.e. ≤6 months post-dose 1). 
Results are from different studies, always with limited sample size. There are no nAb data from study 
VAC31518COV3009.   
Most of the results are for the original Victoria strain. Limited data are available for the VOC. nAb levels 
against the variants are overall lower than for the parental strain. 
There are no Ab data for the Delta variant when the second dose is given at 2 months post-dose 1. 
Data obtained when the second dose is given with a 6 month-interval still should be confirmed.   
Data over a FU period of more than 1 month post-dose 2 are limited. A 2-fold decline of Ab titers is 
observed at 4-6 months post-dose 2 when the booster is given with a 2 or 3 month interval, while 
there is no decline in Ab titers post-dose 1. Whether Ab titers will continue to decline over time is not 
known. There are no long-term data when a boost is given 6 months post-dose 1.  
CMI data are very limited (after 1 or 2 doses). 
The potential impact of natural and of vaccine-induced anti-Ad26 immunity on immunogenicity remains 
unclear and should be further documented. This can have its importance if regular boosters are 
needed. 
Homologous boosting with JCOVDEN induces lower antibody responses compared to heterologous 
boosting with a licensed mRNA vaccine after primary vaccination with JCOVDEN. Neutralising Ab titers 
reached at 1-month post-boost with JCOVDEN after primary vaccination with an mRNA vaccine are 
comparable to after a homologous boost with an mRNA vaccine. 
Elderly and other subgroups: 
Data are limited in the very old participants (aged 75 and older). No efficacy data were obtained in frail 
subjects and long-term health care residents. 
Data are lacking in individuals with uncontrolled underlying disease and multiple comorbidities.  
The subgroup analyses did not raise concern of lack of efficacy for particular subgroups for the two-
dose schedule, but the number of cases (length of follow up) was very limited in some of the 
subgroups. Estimates were very imprecise in the elderly (60 years or more).  
There are no data on immunocompromised persons due to condition or immunosuppressive therapy. 
Efficacy was lower in HIV+ participants, but numbers are small and data difficult to interpret without 
taking account of other characteristics and variants.  
Asymptomatic infections: 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/766600/2022  
Page 39/44 
 
 
 
Efficacy is lacking for asymptomatic cases, either after a single dose or after two doses of 
Ad26.COV2.S.  
Asymptomatic COVID-19 cases were ascertained either based on serologic testing (seroconversion to 
the SARS-COV-2 N protein based on a Nucleoprotein assay) or a positive PCR. In practice most cases 
were identified bases on the Nucleoprotein assay. At the time of the final analysis of the double-blind 
phase of VAC31518COV3001, the estimated VE (adjusted 95% CI) against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 
infection was 29% (20.0; 36.8) as of 28 days after vaccination. In the final analysis of 
VAC31518COV3009, efficacy against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with onset at least 14 days 
after the second vaccination (96 cases reported) was 34% (-6.4; 59.8).  
Viral load in respiratory samples: 
Preliminary data suggest no relevant impact of vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S on SARS-CoV-2 viral 
load levels and duration of virus shedding in upper respiratory tract samples (nasal swabs) of COVID-
19 cases in study VAC31518COV3001 and VAC31518COV3009. 
Efficacy in seropositives: 
In the final analysis of VAC31518COV3001, efficacy against moderate/severe COVID-19 was 76% 
(95% CI: 12.0; 95.7) in participants with serological evidence of past infection with SARS-CoV-2, 
based on only 12 events in the placebo arm and 3 in the active arm. The efficacy is not considered 
demonstrated in the individuals previously infected (lower bound of the CI not meeting the predefined 
success criterion). However, efficacy is anticipated in this group. The immunogenicity data, albeit 
limited, support this assumption. 
Co-administration of other vaccines: 
Concomitant administration with other vaccines has not been studied. A study evaluating the safety 
and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S co-administrated with seasonal influenza vaccine is planned in 
the RMP, and currently ongoing.  
Unfavourable effects 
A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S has an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile in adults 18 years of 
age or older, including adults older than 60 years of age. The safety profile of the primary vaccination 
with  Ad26.COV2.S  in  adults  described  in  the  current  SmPC  is  based  on  a  primary  pooled  analysis  of 
clinical  safety  data  from  the  double-blind  phase  of  Phase  3  studies  (VAC31518COV3001  and 
VAC31518COV3009) and of Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies (COV1001, COV1002, COV2001) with 
Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp (18 November 2021) (procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0060 approved after the 
renewal  reporting  interval)  and  on  post-marketing  data  which  became  available  following  the  initial 
authorization of the vaccine. 
The  safety  of  Ad26.COV2.S  is  mainly  characterised  by  local  and  systemic  reactions.  Reactions  were 
mostly  mild  to  moderate,  transient  and  generally  resolved  within  1  to  2  days  post-vaccination.  The 
reactogenicity was milder and lower in older adults. The overall frequency of SAEs (not associated with 
COVID-19) was low and balanced between placebo and active groups. The safety profile was generally 
consistent across participants with or without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. 
The  administration  of  Ad26.COV2.S  as  an  homologous  booster  dose  after  a  primary  vaccination  with 
Ad26.COV2.S or as an heterologous booster dose (following completion of primary vaccination regimen 
with a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or an adenoviral vector-based COVID-19 vaccine) has also an acceptable 
safety and reactogenicity profile in individuals 18 years of age and older, with no new safety concerns 
identified (procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0053/G approved after the renewal reporting interval).  
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation

Page 40/44 
 
 
 
From  launch  up  to  31  July  2022,  it  is  estimated  that  over  52  million  doses  of  Ad26.COV2.S  were 
administered worldwide. Increasing experience based on spontaneous/solicited post-marketing reporting 
of  adverse  events,  have  led  to  the  identification  of  new,  some  serious  (sometimes  fatal),  adverse 
events/reactions  (including  new  recognized  ADRs  in  currently  published  SmPC:  thrombosis  with 
thrombocytopenia  syndrome  (TTS),  Guillain-Barré  syndrome  (GBS),  Capillary  leak  syndrome, 
lymphadenopathy, paraesthesia and hypoesthesia, dizziness, diarrhoea, vomiting, and tinnitus, VTE, and 
immune thrombocytopenia; and transverse myelitis) for which causality with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine 
has  been  concluded,  based  on  the  available  data.  TTS,  GBS,  thrombocytopenia,  including  immune 
thrombocytopenia, and venous thromboembolism are important identified risks. TTS is in particular of 
concern (with some fatal outcomes) and, as specified in the SmPC, TTS cases occurred within the first 
three weeks following vaccination, and mostly in individuals under 60 years of age. Overall, these risks 
occur  very  rarely,  are  adequately  monitored  and  relevant  risk  minimisation  measures  have  been 
proposed. Potential safety concerns will continue to be monitored. 
The most recent clinical AdVac safety database report (V7.0, dated 1 July 2022) has been assessed in 
the PAM EMEA/H/C/005737/REC/019.1 (approved after the renewal reporting interval). A total of 48,744 
participants  have  been  vaccinated  with  an  Ad26-based  vaccine  in  42  clinical  studies  that  have  been 
integrated  in  the  AdVac  Safety  Database  V7  (cut-off  date  of  31  December  2021).  They  were  mainly 
adults (47,944 adults) and from COVID-19 vaccine studies (39,623 adults: 21,898 in VAC31518COV3001 
and 15,707 in VAC31518COV3009). Overall, Ad26-based vaccines were safe and well tolerated based 
on the data currently available in the clinical database. 
Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The uncertainties and limitations of unfavourable effects have been discussed in other procedures. The 
principal uncertainties are related to long-term effects, interactions with other vaccines and effects in 
specific risk groups. 
As  described  in  the  RMP,  Vaccine-associated  enhanced  disease  (VAED),  including  vaccine-associated 
enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD), remains an important potential risk. It is noted that the current 
dataset gives no indication of vaccine-enhanced disease.  
Finally, the current post authorisation exposure is insufficient to establish differences in the onset and 
severity of the very rare ADRs between primary and booster usage of Ad26.COV2.S. 
Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Efficacy of a single dose of JCOVDEN was assessed in a multi-country trial during a period with a high 
diversity of variants. Efficacy against moderate/severe COVID-19 was 56% (95% CI: 51.3; 60.8) over 
a 4-month median follow-up period. Efficacy against severe COVID-19 was 73% (95% CI: 63.9; 80.5).  
Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point estimates for elderly 
(≥65 years), as well as for participants with medical comorbidities associated with high risk of severe 
COVID-19.  
A drop of efficacy against moderate/severe was observed rapidly after a single dose (a few weeks 
following vaccination), in parallel with the progressive disappearance of the reference strain and 
emergence of several variants. In contrast, efficacy against severe COVID-19 was maintained at least 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/766600/2022  
Page 41/44 
 
 
 
up to 6 months following a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S. Persistence of efficacy beyond 6 months after 
a single dose is not known, as efficacy data are not available after this timepoint. 
Efficacy of a two-dose schedule of JCOVDEN, administered two months apart, was estimated in a 
multi-country trial while Alpha and Mu were the two dominant variants. Efficacy against 
moderate/severe COVID-19 was 75% (95% CI: 54.6; 87.3) over a median FU period of 36 days. There 
were too few severe cases to estimate the efficacy. 
During both efficacy studies, there was limited circulation of the Delta variant, and the Omicron variant 
was not yet circulating. The limited data suggest a lack of efficacy for the Delta variant. There is no 
efficacy data for Omicron.  
Efficacy of JCOVDEN used as homologous or heterologous booster is not known (refer to 
EMEA/H/C/005737/II/33). 
There are limited real-world data for the use of JCOVDEN as primary vaccination or 
homologous/heterologous boost in the context of the Delta wave. Overall, one dose of JCOVDEN 
induces overall good protection against severe disease, similar to other/previously circulating variants.  
One dose of JCOVDEN elicits both humoral and cellular immune responses as early as 14 days, in both 
young and older adults.  
Both an homologous and heterologous boost given at least 2 or 3 months after the primary vaccination 
with JCOVDEN and mRNA vaccine, respectively, induces an increase in both neutralizing and binding 
Ab against the original strain and the Delta variant (binding Ab), when compared to pre-boost values. 
A heterologous boost with JCOVDEN after primary vaccination with an adenoviral vector-based vaccine 
is also immunogenic (approved outside the period covered by this annual renewal). 
The clinical relevance of these findings is not known as there is no established immunological correlate 
of protection. 
The potential impact of natural and of vaccine-induced anti-Ad26 immunity on immunogenicity remains 
unclear and should be further documented. This can have its importance if regular boosters are 
needed. 
A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S, and the administration of Ad26.COV2.S as an homologous booster dose 
after a primary vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S or as an heterologous booster dose (after completion of 
a  2-dose  primary  vaccination  regimen  with  a  mRNA  COVID-19  vaccine  or  with  an  adenoviral  vector-
based COVID-19 vaccine), have an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile in adults ≥18 years of 
age. 
The  safety  of  Ad26.COV2.S  is  mainly  characterised  by  local  and  systemic  reactions.  Reactions  were 
mostly  mild  to  moderate  and  transient.  The  reactogenicity  was  milder  and  lower  in  older  adults.  The 
overall frequency of SAEs (not associated with COVID-19) was low and balanced between placebo and 
active  groups.  The  safety  profile  was  generally  consistent  across  participants  with  or  without  prior 
evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. 
From  launch  up  to  31  July  2022,  it  is  estimated  that  over  52  million  doses  of  Ad26.COV2.S  were 
administered worldwide. Increasing experience based on spontaneous/solicited post-marketing reporting 
of  adverse  events,  have  led  to  the  identification  of  new,  some  serious  (sometimes  fatal),  adverse 
events/reactions.  TTS,  GBS,  thrombocytopenia,  including  immune  thrombocytopenia,  and  venous 
thromboembolism  are  important  identified  risks.  TTS  is  in  particular  of  concern  (with  some  fatal 
outcomes)  and,  as  specified  in  the  SmPC,  TTS  cases  occurred  within  the  first  three  weeks  following 
vaccination, and mostly in individuals under 60 years of age. Overall, these risks occur very rarely, are

adequately monitored and appropriate risk minimisation measures have been proposed. Potential safety 
concerns will continue to be monitored as detailed in the RMP. 
Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the cumulative evidence in terms of favourable and unfavourable effects, the benefit-risk 
balance of JCOVDEN remains positive. 
Scientific grounds for recommending the granting of a marketing 
authorisation not subject to specific obligations 
Several quality-related SOBs have been raised with regards to remaining validation and comparability 
data for the implementation of additional manufacturing sites for both the active substance and the 
finished product. All remaining data have been provided and were found acceptable. Therefore, it can 
be concluded that these quality-related SOBs have been adequately addressed and can be considered 
resolved. 
Considering the vaccination of a large proportion of the control arm and the possibility for all 
participants to be administered with a booster vaccine (Ad26.COV2.S or other approved COVID-19 
vaccine), it is considered that the continued follow-up would no longer contribute in a significant way 
to the safety and efficacy profile substantiate the safety and efficacy profile of JCOVDEN. It is not 
expected that the remaining outstanding data from study VAC31518COV3001 will bring substantial 
additional confirmatory evidence impacting the benefit-risk profile of the vaccine.  
Based on the comprehensive data available from multiple sources, it is agreed that the remaining 
specific obligations regarding VAC31518COV3001 may be reclassified as Category 3 study in the RMP, 
with the final CSRs to be submitted at a later stage as supportive data. There are no remaining 
grounds for the marketing authorisation to remain conditional and the CHMP therefore recommends 
the granting of a standard marketing authorisation not subject to Specific Obligations for of JCOVDEN.

7.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the available information on the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations, 
the benefit-risk balance for JCOVDEN in its approved indication(s) (please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics) continues to be favourable. As all specific obligations have either been fulfilled 
or reclassified as category 3 study in the RMP, there are no remaining grounds for the marketing 
authorisations to remain conditional and the CHMP therefore recommends the granting of a standard 
marketing authorisation not subject to Specific Obligations for JCOVDEN. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the annual renewal, amendments to Annexes I, II and IIIB and to 
the Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the comprehensive existing data package for this vaccine warrants 
conversion of the current conditional approval into a full marketing authorisation not subject to Specific 
Obligations. As a result, it is recommended that the final study report for the ongoing clinical trials are 
reclassified as category 3 study in the RMP and are therefore deleted from the Annex II to this opinion.

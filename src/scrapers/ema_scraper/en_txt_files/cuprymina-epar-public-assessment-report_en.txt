2.   Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Cuprymina contains 64Cu, a radioisotope of copper, as Copper (64Cu) chloride in solution and is 
intended for use as a radiopharmaceutical precursor for radiolabelling of carrier molecules that have 
been specifically developed and authorised for radiolabelling with this radionuclide. Cuprymina is not 
intended for direct administration to patient. 
64Cu has a half-life of 12.7 hours. 64Cu decays by an emission of β+ particles (17.6 %) with a maximum 
energy of 0.66 MeV, an emission of β- particles (38.5 %) with a maximum energy of 0.58 MeV and 
electronic capture (43.9 %), that allows its use both as diagnostic radioisotope (β+) and therapeutic 
radioisotope (β- EC). The β+ and β- emissions (positrons and electrons) have a range of the order of 
1 mm. In its decay, 64Cu also emits 2 gamma rays at 511.0 KeV and 1345.77 KeV (1.35477 ±0.00016 
MeV) with a high penetration power. The process of decay by electron capture is associated with 
emission of 2 high intensity Auger electrons, that release all their energy in a very short range (of the 
order of 6 µm), and have a high level of cytotoxicity on cells. 
64Cu decays in stable 64Ni (61 %) by an emission of β+ particles (18 %) or by an electronic capture (43 
%). 64Cu decays also in stable 64Zn by emission of β- particles (39 %). 
The indication for Cuprymina is the following: 
“Cuprymina is a radiopharmaceutical precursor. It is not intended for direct use in patients. This 
medicinal product must be used only for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, which have been 
specifically developed and authorised for radiolabelling with this radionuclide.” 
Cuprymina is only to be used by specialists experienced with in vitro radiolabelling. 
The quantity of Cuprymina required for radiolabelling and the quantity of 64Cu-labelled medicinal 
product that is subsequently administered will depend on the medicinal product radiolabelled and its 
intended use. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Cuprymina is a radiopharmaceutical precursor solution of Copper (64Cu) chloride, intended for the 
radio-labelling of carrier molecules which have been specifically developed and authorised for radio-
labelling with copper.  As such Cuprymina is not intended for direct administration to patients, but will 
be used to radio-label suitable carrier (ligand) molecules. 
The product is supplied as a sterile and endotoxin-free solution in HCl and is presented in a 10 ml glass 
vial, containing 925 MBq/ml (corresponding to 0.25 micrograms of 64Cu). The quantity of Cuprymina 
required for radiolabelling and the quantity of 64Cu-labelled carrier molecules that is subsequently 
administered depend on the radiolabelled product and its intended use. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Copper (64Cu) chloride is a radiopharmaceutical precursor. The active substance is not isolated during 
the manufacture and is dissolved in a solution of diluted hydrochloric acid. The general properties of 
Cuprymina 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/518790/2012 
Page 7/39
 
 
 
 
the active substance therefore relate to the active substance Copper (64Cu) chloride in diluted 
hydrochloric acid solution. 
The chemical structure of the Copper (64Cu) Chloride is as follows: 
64Cu2+ 
Cl- 
Cl- 
Copper [64Cu] has a characteristic decay scheme, with decay by three schemes: 
  β+ emission of 0.66 MeV (18 %) – diagnostic potential 
  β- emission of 0.58 MeV (38.5 %) – therapeutic potential 
  Electron capture (43.5 %) – therapeutic potential 
64Cu has a half life t1/2 of 12.7 hours.  3 mL of bulk solution contains from 9.25 to 55.55 GBq 64Cu, 
corresponding to 2.5-15 micrograms of 64Cu.  The nominal specific activity is ≥ 3700 MBq 64Cu /μg 
Copper at the expiry date and time (24 h from the End of Synthesis). 
Manufacture 
The copper (64Cu) chloride active substance is prepared in a computer-assisted synthesizer unit. Its 
manufacture is based on a chemical process involving three steps: 
1.  Preparation of the target: electro-deposition of 64Ni onto a gold disk. 
2.  Irradiation of the target: the electroplated 64Ni disk is irradiated using a cyclotron to produce 
the 64Cu. 
3.  Nuclide separation: dissolution of the electro-deposited 64Cu in HCl 6N followed by radionuclidic 
purification through an ion exchange column. This step is carried out in a dedicated synthesis 
module by an automated process. 
Radioactivity values are monitored and recorded throughout the synthesis process and these are 
summarised against time at the end of each synthesis.  These measurements allow the yield at each 
step of the process to be determined and controlled.   
Copper (64Cu) chloride bulk solution is the active substance and it is never isolated in the automated 
process. 
The manufacturing process is well described and appropriate in-process controls are in place. As the 
synthesis is continuous and automated and the radionuclide has a short half life and high radioactivity, 
no intermediates are isolated during the production of the bulk drug substance solution.  Critical steps 
are therefore controlled by means of ensuring that processing parameters are consistent and 
controlled. Description and validation of the ICP-MS method used for testing the starting material 64Ni 
was not considered sufficient and the issue was raised as a major objection in the D120 LoQ. The issue 
was not considered totally resolved at D180 and clarification was requested as a major objection. The 
applicant provided adequate responses to the remaining objection and the ICP-MS method is now 
considered acceptable. The starting materials are sufficiently characterised, with the specifications and 
testing procedures being acceptable.  
Radionuclidic identification measurement using gamma spectroscopy is used to confirm the 
identification of the drug substance as Copper (64Cu) chloride.

Impurities in the active substance are inorganic impurities that may be divided into radioisotopic 
impurities and metallic impurities. The radioisotopic impurities may arise from irradiation of isotopic 
impurities in the target material or from the irradiation of the target 64Ni. These impurities are 
important because they may influence the radionuclidic purity of the drug substance. The metallic 
impurities may derive from the decay of radioactive impurities, of 64Cu and of starting material.  
Radionuclidic impurities and their physical characteristics have been adequately described in this 
section. Metallic impurities that may be present during the process have been described and are 
reported satisfactorily.  
Specification 
Since the bulk active substance cannot be isolated within the synthesis module, the activity control is 
the only check carried out and it is automatically measured at the end of the synthesis. However 
during the process development and characterisation studies carried out using a manual procedure, 
the main characteristics of the active substance were defined and are tested at the drug product level.  
It is accepted that an official active substance specification does not exist for the active substance 
since the manufacturing process from starting material to drug product is continuous and the active 
substance is not isolated at any time.  The in process controls are considered to control the process of 
active substance manufacture adequately. 
The only procedure performed that is specific to the active substance is radioactivity measured at each 
of the three ionisation chamber detectors within the synthesis module.  The radioactivity detector is 
calibrated to appropriate standards. 
Stability 
Although the active substance is not isolated, manual pilot scale batches were manufactured for which 
the following stability studies have been carried out: 
• Testing at 25 °C±2 °C  
• Stress Testing at 40 °C ±2 °C  
• Stress Testing at 0 °C ±2 °C  
These studies have been performed for 24 hours with testing intervals: T0, T8, T12, T16 and T24  
The following parameters have been investigated:  
• Radionuclidic identification  
• Radionuclidic purity  
• Radiochemical Purity  
• Chemical purity  
• Half Life  
Sterility and bacterial endotoxin have not been tested, which is acceptable as the active substance is 
not isolated and the finished product is tested for sterility 
The active substance characteristics remains within the limits for the tested parameters up to the end 
of shelf life of the finished product that is 24 hours with no degradation or trends evident in the data. 
Cuprymina 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/518790/2012 
Page 9/39
 
 
 
 
No post approval stability protocol or commitment was provided for the active substance. Given that 
the active substance is not isolated in routine manufacture, this is acceptable. 
Comparability exercise for Active Substance 
Since Cuprymina is not intended for direct administration without conjugation to carrier molecules, no 
clinical data with the use of Cuprymina alone has been submitted; therefore no comparability exercise 
was necessary. 
2.2.3.   Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The aim was to develop a manufacturing process that allows obtaining a sterile finished product with a 
very low content of metallic impurities, to ensure the intended performance of the product that is its 
radiolabelling capacity. 
Cuprymina is supplied in HCl 0.1N. The performance of the finished product is linked to its capacity to 
label specific carrier molecules.  This capacity can be reduced by the presence of metallic impurities, 
therefore part of manufacturing process development focused on ensuring that the synthesis unit and 
dispensing module are cleaned by a valid procedure after every manufacturing run.   
Adventitious agents 
No starting materials, raw materials or reagents are of human or animal origin. There are no excipients 
of human or animal origin used in the finished product. Therefore, there is no risk of BSE/TSE 
transmission via this product.  
Manufacture of the product 
 The manufacturing process includes four steps:  
 
 
 
 
dilution 
dispensing  
sterilisation  
packaging  
The finished product is prepared in a computer-assisted dispensing unit.  Activity and volume are 
measured as soon as the bulk solution of the active substance is delivered from the synthesis module.  
After measurement of radioactivity and volume, the active substance solution is diluted with 0.1 N HCl 
to a volume between 10-60 mL according to client request and in order to have a concentration of 925 
MBq/mL ± 5% at 01:00 am CET on the date of manufacture.  The dispensing unit is located in a 
radiation shielded enclosure. The product is sterilised by terminal sterilisation according to an 
accelerated cycle shown to be at least equivalent to the standard sterilisation cycle of the Ph.Eur. 
The in process control limits are justified in line with the intended use of the product and with batch 
data where appropriate.  
The manufacturing process has been validated on six industrial scale batches of the product, 
representative of the minimum and maximum batch size, and the process is considered validated.  
Cuprymina 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/518790/2012 
Page 10/39
 
 
 
 
Reassurance is also gained from the fact that the process is monitored remotely for every batch of the 
product, meaning that any deviations may be immediately investigated.  
Product specification 
The specification of the finished product covers appropriate parameters for the dosage form. 
The product is tested: 
 
pre-release for appearance by visual inspection, radioactive concentration (at calibration time and 
date) by ionisation chamber, radionuclidic identification by gamma spectroscopy (Ge dectector), 
radionuclidic purity by gamma spectroscopy (Ge dectector), radiochemical purity and specific 
radioactivity by TLC, chemical purity by polarography, molarity and pH by potentiometry, bacterial 
endotoxin by LAL (Ph. Eur.) and control of sterilisation.  
 
post-release for half-life by gamma spectroscopy (Ge detector), filter integrity by bubble point test 
and sterility (Ph. Eur.) 
Given the short (12.7 h) half life of 64Cu, the product is released before sterility testing has been 
performed. Sterility testing is performed after the release of the product when the product is no longer 
radioactive. Given the control on the sterilisation process demonstrated through process validation 
studies, this is acceptable.   
The analytical methods have been satisfactorily described and validated.   
Batch  analysis  data  were  presented  for  process  validation  batches.  All  results  comply  with  the 
specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability studies were conducted on five batches according to the ICH stability guideline.  
In addition to the stability test that indicates the stability at the recommended storage condition of 
25°C ± 2 °C, an accelerated stability study a 40 °C has been performed to evaluate the effect of short 
term excursion outside the label storage conditions and another study at 0 °C has been performed for 
Cuprymina intended to be shipped by airplane in a condition of 0 °C. Whilst these data are considered 
useful, they are insufficient to support such excursions in routine use. Therefore the shelf life approved 
for the product will not include approval for excursions from the labelled storage conditions. 
The results of stability studies support the shelf-life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The validity of the analytical methodologies used for testing of isotopic impurities and metallic 
impurities of the starting material 64Ni was questioned during the procedure. 64Ni must comply with 
extremely tight specifications, especially regarding purity that relate to isotopic and chemical purity of 
the final drug product. The applicant provided additional data to confirm the validity of these methods. 
This was considered acceptable. 
The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
There were no non-clinical studies submitted in the application except from a biodistribution study in 
nude mice to evaluate dosimetry. The applicant submitted a review of the published literature in non-
clinical studies with 64Cu radiolabelled carrier molecules as support for the clinical utility of 64Cu.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
A review of the available pharmacodynamic data of 64Cu was submitted in the form of literature 
references. This review addressed the mechanics of Cu intracellular transport and the biochemistry of 
64Cu relating to nuclear medicine imaging and therapy. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Nuclear medicine imaging  
Use as a tracer and in preclinical oncology studies 
64CuCl2 is sufficiently labile to permit rapid synthesis of Cu+2 compounds simply by addition of the 
ligand at an appropriate pH at room temperature1 . Simple compounds labelled with 64Cu have also 
been used in preclinical oncology studies. For example, 64CuCl2 has been used as a probe for imaging 
mouse extra-hepatic hepatoma expressing a mouse copper transporter2 . 64Cu dithiosemicarbazone 
(ATSM) was shown to reduce the clonogenic survival rate in vitro of mouse lung carcinoma cells in a 
dose-dependent manner3 . 64Cu–labelled monoclonal antibodies have been used to characterise the 
internalisation properties of radio-immunoconjugates in vitro, to obtain their in vivo distribution profile 
and to calculate mouse xenograft dosimetry when designing preclinical therapy studies4 . 
Systemic administration of hypoxia-selective 64Cu-ATSM has increased significantly the survival time of 
hamsters bearing human GW39 colon cancer tumours, survival being 135 days in treated hamsters vs 
20 days in untreated animals5.  
Preclinical studies on Hypoxia  
Generally shorter-lived isotopes are used to measure blood flow and hypoxia, for example, the 62Cu-
PTSM and 62Cu-ATSM have been evaluated to image hypoxic tissue in myocardium6  and tumours7 
respectively. 64Cu-ATSM in rat tumour shows high uptake in liver and kidney, indicating these as 
clearance organs for 64Cu-ATSM. The early rapid uptake of 64Cu ATSM in the brain may be due to the 
high membrane permeability of 64Cu-ATSM8 . 64Cu-ATSM has exhibited potential as diagnostic modality 
for the detection of tumour ischemia9, 10. In ischemic rat heart tissue, 64Cu-ATSM showed high 
accumulation whereas perfusion marker 11C-acetate showed low accumulation11. 64Cu-PTSM has been 
used in the detection of cerebral and myocardial blood flow perturbations and in fibrosarcoma 
therapy 12.  
Somatostatin and analogues  
Cuprymina 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/518790/2012 
Page 12/39
 
 
 
 
Peptide analogues of somatostatin have been labelled with a variety of radionuclides, including 
isotopes for gamma scintigraphy and PET imaging, as well as β–emitters for peptide receptor 
radionuclide therapy applications. Tracer 64Cu-DOTA-labelled somatostatin analogues have been 
synthesized and evaluated in rats13. Comparison of four 64Cu-TETA-labelled somatostatin analogues in 
vitro and in tumour bearing rats has been performed14, with the goal to optimize the peptide portion of 
the radiopharmaceutical for target tissue uptake and non-target tissue clearance: among octreotide, 
Y3-octreotide, TATE and Y3-TATE, 64Cu-TETA-Y3-TATE showed the best targeting and clearance 
properties. A Y3-TATE-based 64Cu radiopharmaceutical containing a cross-bridged macrocyclic chelator, 
64Cu-CB-TE2A-Y3-TATE, displayed improved target tissue uptake and blood and liver clearance 
compared to 64Cu-TETA-octreotide and 64Cu-TETA-Y3-TATE in vitro and in vivo in tumour bearing 
rats15. 
Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and peptides 
Radiolabeled peptides and monoclonal antibodies are class of molecules for the targeted imaging and 
therapy of tumours. 64Cu-DOTA-cetuximab has been used to image EGFR-positive xenograft tumour 
models16. 
Radiolabeled arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) peptides that are integrin specific can be used for non 
invasive imaging of integrin expression level as well as for integrin-targeted radionuclide cancer 
diagnosis and therapy. The 64Cu-DOTA-E{E[c(RGDfK)]2}2 has been used for peptide receptor 
radionuclide imaging and therapy of integrin-positive tumours17 . The efficacy of the 64Cu-labelled 
streptavidin to detect early or delayed apoptosis has been studied in small animal PET to evaluate 
cancer treatment protocols18. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies were submitted.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were submitted.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No study reports on pharmacokinetics were submitted. A review of the literature on the 
pharmacokinetic behaviour of 64Cu was submitted.  
Bile is the major pathway for the excretion of copper19.  
Dosimetry 
Dosimetry of the labelled radiopharmaceutical will depend on the pharmacokinetics of the carrier to be 
labelled.  
In order to generate data for the evaluation of the internal radiation dosimetry in humans, an 
evaluation of the internal radiation resulting from the free Copper (64Cu) that could be administered 
unconjugated or release from the protein conjugates was carried out in mice. 100 male nude mice 
were administered a single i.v. dose of Copper (64CU) chloride at a nominal dose level of 15 MBq/kg 
bodyweight corresponding to 4 ng/kg of Cu.  Tissues were sampled at 2min, 30min, 60min, 4hr, 6hr, 
12hr, 24hr, 2days, 4 days and 6 days. The results are shown in Tables 3 and 4 for the distribution of 
64CuCl2 in mice and the estimation of the human internal radiation dosimetry, respectively, performed

in accordance with the dosimetry estimates based on a mouse distribution study. The approach used 
was based on OLINDA - Organ Level INternal Dose Assessment Code (copyright Vanderbilt University, 
2003)20 . Most organs contained radiation at the 2 min sample point.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The applicant presented a review of the available literature references of toxicology data of copper 
(Cu) and 64Cu. The majority of information concerns the oral route of administration and copper 
sulphate salt. 
Single dose toxicity 
From the data reported it appears that mice are less susceptible to copper than rats. In the various 
acute studies, as the lethal dose is approached, signs of copper toxicity include excessive salivation, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, gastric haemorrhage, hypotension, haemolytic crisis, convulsions and paralysis.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
In the short-term 15-day feeding studies, there were no deaths in concentrations of Cu in food and/or 
water up to 16,000 ppm, the highest level of dietary inclusion (equivalent to 324 mg Cu/kg bw/day in 
male rats, 285 mg Cu/kg bw/day in female rats, and 717 and 781 mg Cu/kg bw/day in male and 
female mice, respectively). Microscopic findings in rats at 2,000 ppm and above included hyperplasia 
and hyperkeratosis of the squamous mucosa of the limiting ridge separating the forestomach from the 
glandular stomach. A similar finding was observed in mice but the severity was minimal. Rats also 
showed chronic liver inflammation, and effects on haematopoietic cells of the bone marrow and spleen, 
at 8,000 ppm and above, and kidney findings similar to those seen in the drinking water studies, at 
2,000 ppm and above. The lowest NOEL for male and female rat is 1000 ppm equivalent to 23 mg 
Cu/kg bw/day. The lowest NOEL for male and female mice is 1000 ppm equivalent to 43 or 53 mg 
Cu/kg bw/day. The short-term feeding study data were used to set dose levels for the 90-day 
studies21. 
Administration of copper sulphate did not cause any adverse effects on any of the reproductive 
parameters measured (oestrous cycle length, sperm morphology and sperm motility) of either species.

Neurotoxicity 
A few studies report the neurological effects of copper compounds. In rats, oral exposure to copper (II) 
sulphate in two studies did not affect the results of the behavioural tests, but did alter brain 
neurochemistry. Injection of copper (II) chloride altered levels of neurotransmitters in the brain of 
rats. 
Genotoxicity 
There were no genotoxicity studies reported in which copper salts were administered i.v.. Published 
reports on in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies that investigated long term effects of high dose 
levels of copper and a two-year dietary administration of copper were submitted. In vitro studies 
showed that copper was generally not mutagenic in test bacteria TA98, TA100 and TA102 strains of 
Salmonella typhimurium with and without exogenous metabolic activation31,32. However, there was 
evidence of genotoxicity in some studies where copper(II)sulphate caused an increase of unscheduled 
DNA synthesis in cultured rat hepatocytes and copper(II) 8-hydroxyquinolone being weakly mutagenic 
in some strains of Salmonella and E.coli. Dietary dose levels equivalent to 250 mg Cu/kg bw/day for up 
to 52 weeks duration were associated with initial (week 6) liver damage including hypertrophic, 
hyperchromatic parenchymal cells, necrosis and marked inflammatory reaction, and kidney damage to 
the proximal convoluted tubule. Both liver and kidney showed complete recovery between 9 and 15 
weeks of continued copper administration. The two-year dietary study showed that there was no 
increase in incidence of tumours after two years dietary administration of potassium sodium copper 
chlorophyllin or copper sulphate33. 
Carcinogenicity 
The applicant submitted a literature review of carcinogenicity studies. The studies are summarised in 
Table 6:

Reproduction Toxicity 
The applicant submitted a review of the literature on reproduction toxicity. In some studies in rats, 
chronic oral exposure to 27-120 mg/kg bw per day of copper resulted in altered weight and/or 
histology of the testes, seminal vesicles, uterus or ovaries. Other studies have demonstrated that 
exposure to copper compounds during gestation induced embryo/foetotoxic effects at doses of 12 mg 
of copper/kg body weight and above34. 
Local Tolerance  
The applicant did not submit studies on local tolerance.  
Other toxicity studies 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An ERA specifically addressing the effect of Cuprymina on the environment has not been conducted. 
This is acceptable as all radiopharmaceuticals should be handled and disposed in accordance with 
Cuprymina 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/518790/2012 
Page 17/39
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
national regulations. The ERA concentrated on the safe synthesis, transport and handling of the 
radionuclide. 
Radiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in 
designated clinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the 
regulations and/or appropriate licences of the competent official organisation.  Radiopharmaceuticals 
should be prepared in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and pharmaceutical quality 
requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken.  
Any unused medicinal product or waste material must be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No  new  animal  studies  were  conducted  with  Cuprymina  except  for  the  biodistribution  study  in  nude 
mice  which  provides  data  on  internal  radiation  resulting  from  free  64Cu  that  could  be  administered 
unconjugated or released from the conjugates.   
Pharmacokinetics of Cuprymina was investigated in mice. Following intravenous administration, at the 
beginning most organs contained an amount of radioactivity which represented their content of 64Cu-
laden blood. Liver, kidney and the intestinal tract reached their maximal content of 64Cu within the first 
few hours, and then radioactivity steadily diminished. Part of the decrease can be attributed to 
excretion of 64Cu into the bile, urine and faeces. 
Blood radioactivity decreased from 60.3 % to 3.4 % after 1 hour, and then it decreased to 1 % after 6 
hours, and increased to 5.6 % and 4.9 % after 12-24 hours. 
Copper (64Cu) chloride is distributed mainly in the liver and kidney and the pattern of radioactivity in 
the blood parallels the pattern of radioactivity in the liver. Almost the entire 64Cu rapidly leaves the 
blood and enters the liver and kidney. 
Maximum liver uptake was at 4 hours after injection at 57.7 % of the administered dose. 
Subsequently, copper re-emerges in plasma and is distributed to other organs. 
Non-clinical data show that unconjugated 64Cu accumulates in kidney and renal radiation damage, liver 
toxicity and haematotoxicity are likely to be the most important toxicity (and dose limiting factors) to 
be observed in the clinical situation.  
No animal toxicity studies were conducted with Cuprymina. Most of the experimental data on the 
toxicity of copper comes from studies in rats. Its main risk derives from the emission of high energy β 
radiation.  Liver, gastrointestinal tract and kidney are the target organs for copper toxicity after single 
and repeated dose administration. Many international bodies assessed copper genotoxicity and 
carcinogenicity concluding that there is no conclusive evidence that copper may be mutagenic or 
carcinogenic. The Scientific Committee on Food of the European Commission (2003) recommend a 
Dietary Allowances of 0.9 mg copper/day in adult males and females and established a Tolerable Upper 
Uptake level of 5 mg/day, allowing a huge safety margin in comparison to copper amount administered 
by Cuprymina. 
Cuprymina is a precursor to be used for in vitro radiolabelling of carrier molecules and is not directly 
injected in patients. Because of the very low systemic exposure to 64Cu (maximal dose administered is 
2.77 GBq), no primary or secondary pharmacodynamic effect is expected either from the unconjugated 
radionuclide or from the cold copper chloride. 
Cuprymina 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/518790/2012 
Page 18/39
 
 
 
 
The applicant did not submit local tolerance studies. This is acceptable as Cuprymina is not to be 
directly injected in patients. 
Cuprymina is not considered to be associated with unacceptable environmental risks provided current 
regulations related to the handling and disposal of radiopharmaceuticals are adhered to. The SmPC 
provided advice and guidance on how to use the product (section 4.4 special warning and precautions 
of use) and how to handle the radioactive waste (section 6.6 special precautions for disposal and other 
handling). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The mutagenicity, carcinogenicity and radiotoxicity are not a concern for Cuprymina as the amount of 
copper utilised in the diagnostic protocol for Cuprymina (4 ng/kg bw corresponding to 240 ng/60 kg 
person/treatment) is considered negligible. It can be concluded that there is no appreciable additional 
risk deriving from the use of 64Cu in human. 
No supplementary animal studies are needed because safety issues can adequately be evaluated from 
the literature and considering that single and repeated dose toxicity studies will be provided for the 
carrier medicinal products using the 64Cu radiolabel. 
For the purpose of an application for a radiopharmaceutical for radiolabelling, the non-clinical aspects 
of Cuprymina have been adequately addressed. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Cuprymina is a radiopharmaceutical precursor, and is itself not intended for direct administration but 
for radiolabelling of a carrier molecule. The applicant submitted a literature review on the clinical utility 
of Cuprymina. The following Table 7 presents a review of the published literature submitted by the 
applicant, reporting data on some Cu isotopes-conjugated compounds to support the claim for clinical 
utility of 64Cu radiopharmaceutical precursor. 
2.4.2.  Clinical efficacy 
The following Table 7 presents a review of the published literature submitted by the applicant,

2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No clinical pharmacology studies were submitted with this application.  
2.4.4.  Pharmacodynamics 
No clinical pharmacology studies were submitted with this application.  
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The lack of clinical pharmacology studies is considered acceptable. The pharmacokinetics of a 
radiopharmaceutical would be dependent on the carrier molecule labelled with Cuprymina.  The 
pharmacodynamics of a radiopharmaceutical would also be dependent on the carrier molecule and on 
the method of conjugation used to link it to the radioisotope.   
The applicant has provided a discussion to justify the low likelihood of the presence of free Cuprymina 
in the body, following administration of a Cuprymina labelled radiopharmaceutical. This is based on the 
high labelling index observed with molecules that have been labelled with Cuprymina up to now. The 
applicant has also discussed the biological pathway of copper in the body to justify that the normal 
homeostatic mechanisms would prevent an overdosage of copper, which is not expected considering 
the negligible dose of copper that would be administered with the use of Cuprymina.  
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of Cuprymina will be dependent on the carrier molecule used and relevant 
clinical pharmacology data with Cuprymina will have to be submitted separately with the different 
carrier molecules. For the purpose of an application for a radiopharmaceutical for radiolabelling, the 
clinical pharmacology of Cuprymina has been adequately addressed. 
2.4.7.  Clinical Utility 
The applicant has discussed and submitted clinical data to support the clinical utility of Cuprymina or 
64Cu radionuclide in imaging of tissue hypoxia and detection of primary tumour sites and metastases. 
Imaging of tissue hypoxia 
The applicant presented several studies which used dithiosemicarbazone (ATSM) labelled with copper 
radioisotopes as a hypoxia marker for PET scanning, as well as the factors contributing to the trapping

of Cu(II)-ATSM in hypoxic cells. The following studies summarise the data in support of the claim of 
clinical utility in imaging of tissue hypoxia for Cuprymina: 
Study 13: Takahashi N., Fujibayashi Y., Yonekura Y., et al. (Annals of Nuclear Medicine Vol 
14, No 5, 323-328, 2000) The first human report of copper labelled–ATSM, evaluated in 4 normal 
subjects and 6 patients with lung cancer. 62Cu was the isotope used in this study. PET was performed 
with a high-resolution, whole body PET scanner. To compare 62Cu-ATSM images with blood flow and 
glucose metabolism of tumours, 15O-water and FDG-PET was performed within 1 week. 62Cu-ATSM 
rapidly cleared from the blood, reaching a stable activity after the injection. Little uptake was observed 
in the lung; the myocardial uptake was small; but the liver uptake was considerable. There was no 
correlation between 62Cu-ATSM and the blood flow pattern except in one patient. No correlation was 
found between 62Cu-ATSM and FDG. In 3 of 4 patients, a negative correlation was found between blood 
flow and the flow-normalised 62Cu-ATSM uptake ratio. 
Study 2: Dehdashti F., Mintun M.A., Lewis J.S., et al. (European Journal of Nuclear Medicine 
and Molecular Imaging,  Vol 30, No.6, June  2003), assessed the feasibility of clinical imaging 
with 60Cu-ATSM in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, and also assessed whether pre-treatment 
tumour uptake of 60Cu-ATSM predicted tumour responsiveness to therapy. Nineteen patients with 
biopsy-proven non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were studied by positron emission tomography 
(PET) with 60Cu-ATSM and fluorine 18F-FDG before the beginning of therapy. 60Cu-ATSM uptake was 
evaluated semi-quantitatively by determining the tumour-to-muscle activity ratio (T/M). The PET 
results were correlated with follow-up evaluation (2-46 months). The tumour of one patient had no 
discernible 60Cu–ATSM uptake, whereas the tumour uptake in the remaining patients was variable. 
60Cu–ATSM showed high contrast levels between hypoxic and normoxic tissues and yielded clinically 
relevant information about tumour oxygenation that was predictive of response to therapy and tumour 
treatment outcome. A semi-quantitative analysis of the 60Cu–ATSM tumour-to-muscle ratio was able to 
discriminate subject responders to therapy from non-responders. The mean T/M ratio was significantly 
lower in responders (1.5±0.4) than in non-responders (3.4±0.8) (P=0.002). An arbitrarily selected 
T/M threshold of 3.0 discriminated those likely to respond to therapy. Tumour SUV for FDG was not 
significantly different in responders and non-responders (P=0.7) and did not correlate with 60Cu-ATSM 
uptake(r=0.04; P=0.9). 
Study 3: Dehdashti F., Grigsby P.W., Mintun M.A., Lewis J.S., Siegel B.A., Welch M.J. (Int 
Journal of Radiation Oncology Biol. Phys., Vol 55, No.5, pp 1233-1238, 2003), investigated 
whether tumour hypoxia assessed by PET with 60Cu-ATSM could predict the responsiveness to therapy 
in 14 patients with cervical cancer. 60Cu-ATSM uptake was evaluated semi-quantitatively by 
determining the tumour to muscle activity ratio (T/M). All patients also underwent clinical PET with 18F-
FDG before institution of therapy. Tumour uptake of 60Cu-ATSM was inversely related to progression-
free survival and overall survival (log–rank p=0.0005 and p=0.015, respectively). 18F-FDG uptake did 
not correlate with 60Cu–ATSM uptake (r = 0.04; P = 0.80) and had no significant difference between 
patients with hypoxic tumours and those with normoxic tumours. An arbitrarily selected tumour to 
muscle (T/M) activity ratio threshold of 3.5 discriminated those likely to develop recurrence. The 
frequency of locoregional nodal metastasis was greater in hypoxic tumours (p=0.03). PET results were 
correlated with follow-up evaluation (14-24 months). Results are illustrated in Figure 1. Patient 
survival has an inverse relationship with tumour uptake of 60Cu-ATSM assessed by tumour-to-muscle 
activity ratio (p < 0.0005 and p < 0.015 respectively).

Study 6: Grigsby et al, (Mol Imaging Biol 2007, 9:278-283). Fifteen patients with cervical cancer 
were enrolled in a prospective study aimed to determine if hypoxia-related molecular markers were 
associated with 60Cu–ATSM retention. These patients underwent evaluation of tumour hypoxia with PET 
using 60Cu–ATSM. PET imaging data of the patients were compared with the expression of tissue 
molecular markers, which included vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cyclo-oxygenase-2 
(COX-2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), carbonic anyhdrase IX (CA-9), and apoptotic index. 
Six patients had hypoxic tumour determined by 60Cu–ATSM and nine had non-hypoxic tumour. The 4-
year overall survival estimates were 75% for patients with non-hypoxic tumour and 33% for those with 
hypoxic tumours (p = 0.04) (Figure 2). 
Overexpression of VEGF (p = 0.13), EGFR (p = 0.05), CA-9 (p = 0.02), COX-2 (p = 0.08), and the 
presence of apoptosis (p = 0.005) occurred in patients with hypoxic tumours. Cox proportional hazards 
modelling demonstrated hypoxia as determined by 60Cu-ATSM to be a significant independent predictor 
of tumour recurrence (p = 0.0287).

Study 4: Dietz D.W., Dehdashti F., Grigsby PW., et al. (The American Society of Colon and 
Rectal Surgeons; Vol 51: 1641-1648; 2008). 19 patients with locally invasive (T2–4) primary or 
node-positive rectal cancer located <12 cm from the anal verge were evaluated in this pilot study, 
regarding the utility of 62Cu-ATSM in predicting the prognosis and response of rectal cancers to 
neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The primary tumour was imaged by positron emission tomography 
with 60Cu-ATSM, and accumulation of the tracer was measured semi-quantitatively by determining the 
tumour-to-muscle activity ratio. Eleven patients also underwent clinical positron emission tomography 
with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was then administered within 2 weeks of 
60Cu-ATSM-positron emission tomography. Proctectomy was performed six to eight weeks after 
neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and the tumour submitted to pathology for size measurement and 
staging. Tumour-to-muscle activity ratios were compared with tumour 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, 
tumour response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and with patient survival. 2 patients were 
excluded from final analysis. Of the 17 remaining patients, 14 had a reduction in tumour size and 13 
were down-staged. The median tumour-to-muscle activity ratio of 2.6 discriminated those with worse 
prognosis from those with better prognosis. Both overall and progression-free survivals were worse 
with hypoxic tumours (tumour-to-muscle activity ratio >2.6) than with non-hypoxic tumours (tumour-
to-muscle activity ratio ≤2.6; both P<0.05). In addition, 2 of the 3 tumours with no change in size had 
tumour-to-muscle activity ratios >2.6 (positive predictive value 66 percent), whereas 6 of 14 with 
decreased size had tumour-to-muscle activity ratios >2.6 (negative predictive value 57 percent). Three 
of the 4 tumours not down-staged had tumour-to-muscle activity ratios >2.6 (positive predictive value 
75 percent), whereas 5 of 13 down-staged tumours had tumour-to-muscle activity ratios >2.6 
(negative predictive value 62 percent). The mean tumour-to-muscle activity ratio for down-staged 
tumours (2.2) was significantly lower than that of non-down-staged tumours (3.3) (P=0.03). The 
difference in mean tumour-to-muscle activity ratio between downsized (2.3) and non-downsized (2.9) 
tumours did not reach statistical significance (P=0.36). Tumour 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake (n=11) 
did not correlate with 60Cu-ATSMuptake (r=0.4; P=0.9) and there was no significant difference in mean 
tumour 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake between patients with hypoxic tumours and those with 
normoxic tumours (P=0.3). The results of this small pilot study suggest that 60Cu-ATSM-PET may be 
predictive of survival and, possibly, tumour response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients 
with rectal cancer. 
Study 9: Minagawa Y., Shizukuishi K., Koike I., et al (Ann Nucl Med; published online 16 Feb 
2011). This pilot study was conducted to determine whether there was a relationship between the 
uptake of 62Cu-ATSM and response to chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced head and 
neck cancer. In patients with (non CR) and without (CR) residual/recurrent tumours at 2-year post 
irradiation, the statistical significance of the differences in tumour 62Cu-ATSM SUVmax, T/M ratio, 18F-
FDG SUVmax and tumour volume were analyzed using Student’s t test and Welch test. The 
relationship between clinical outcome and 62Cu-ATSM/18F-FDG uptake patterns was analyzed using 
Kruskal–Wallis test. The correlation between SUVmax of 62Cu-ATSM and 18F-FDG was compared by 
Spearman’s rank correlation test. Two of the 17 patients that were enrolled in our study were excluded 
from the final analysis. Of the 15 remaining patients, 9 patients were free of disease and 6 patients 
had residual/recurrent tumours. The SUVmax differed significantly (p\0.05) between patients with or 
without residual/recurrent tumour on 62Cu-ATSM PET/CT. Six of the 10 patients with tumours SUVmax 
[5.00 had residual/recurrent tumour, whereas all of the 5 patients with tumours SUVmax\5.00 were 
free of disease. There was no significant difference in FDG uptake between patients with and without 
residual/recurrent tumour. The results of this pilot study suggested that 62Cu-ATSM uptake may be a 
predictive indicator of tumour response to chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced head 
and neck cancer.

Study 8: Lewis J.S., Laforest R., Dehdashti F., Grigsby P.W., Welch M.J., Siegel B.A. (J Nucl 
Med 2008; 49:1177-1182).The purpose of this study was to obtain the preclinical data for copper-
ATSM, followed by a crossover comparison of PET image quality and tumour uptake with 60Cu-ATSM 
and 64Cu-ATSM in women with cancer of the uterine cervix. The preclinical toxicology and 
pharmacology of a copper-ATSM formulation was examined using standard in vitro and in vivo assays, 
as well as 14-d toxicity studies in both rats and rabbits. For the clinical test–retest imaging study, 10 
patients with cervical carcinoma underwent PET on separate days with 60Cu-ATSM and 64Cu-ATSM. 
Image quality was assessed qualitatively, and the tumour-to-muscle activity ratio was measured for 
each tracer. The toxicology and pharmacology data demonstrated that the formulation has an 
appropriate margin of safety for clinical use. In the patient study, the authors report that the image 
quality with 64Cu-ATSM was better than that with 60Cu-ATSM because of lower noise. In addition, the 
pattern and magnitude of tumour uptake of 60Cu-ATSM and 64Cu-ATSM on studies separated by 1–9 d 
were similar. The authors concluded that 64Cu-ATSM appeared to be a safe radiopharmaceutical that 
can be used to obtain high-quality images of tumour hypoxia in human cancers. 
Study 12 (Wong et al., 2008) deals with the comparison between 62Cu-ATSM and 62Cu-PTSM. The 
use of 62Cu presents the advantage of short half-life (=9.7 minutes) allowing multiple acquisitions with 
different carriers. This is an advantage in terms of radio dosimetry. The study was performed in two 
patients with lung neoplasm. Patients underwent PET with 62Cu -ATSM and 62Cu-PTSM and F18FDG. 
Results suggest that the distribution of 62Cu-ATSM, a marker of hypoxia, and 62Cu-PTSM, a perfusion 
marker, does not change 10 min after injection and that imaging between 10 and 20 min after 
injection reflect the steady-state.  
50Chao K.S.C., et al (Int. Journal of Radiation Oncology Biol. Phys., Vol 49, No.4, pp 1171-
1182, 2001) demonstrated that it was feasible to include information about hypoxia in Intensity 
Modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) planning. In this study, the Authors have examined the feasibility of 
Cu-ATSM-guided IMRT, which may potentially deliver higher dose of radiation to the hypoxic tumour 
sub-volume to overcome inherent hypoxia-induced radio-resistance without compromising normal 
tissue sparing. 
The papers by Deveau et al 51 and Lucignani et al 52, also discuss the potential utility of hypoxic 
tissue imaging by PET in planning delivery of radiotherapy. 
Study 7: Isozaki M., Kiyono Y., Arai Y., et al. (Eur J Nucl Mol Imaging, 2nd Feb 2011). In this 
study 10 patients with major cerebral arterial occlusive disease underwent PET with 62Cu-ATSM and 15 
O tracers. 7 healthy volunteers also underwent 62Cu-ATSM PET as normal controls. Cerebral blood flow 
(CBF), blood volume, metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) were 
measured by 15O-gas and water studies and compared with early- and delayed-phase 62Cu-ATSM 
images and delayed to early (D/E) ratio. Dynamic PET acquisition with 62Cu-ATSM provided information 
on CBF distribution and local elevation of OEF in patients with chronic CVD. The findings of the present 
study showed the feasibility of the non invasive molecular imaging method for diagnosing misery 
perfusion with a single venous tracer injection. 
Detection of primary tumours sites and metastases 
The clinical utility of Cuprymina was discussed with the use of copper-64 labelled TETA-octreotide 
(64Cu-TETA-Octreotide) for imaging in neuroendocrine tumours; and with the use of copper-64 labelled 
monoclonal antibody 1A3 in the imaging of colorectal cancer. 
Study 1: Anderson C.J., et al (J of Nuclear Medicine, 2001; 42:213-221)-Eight patients with a 
history of neuroendocrine tumours were imaged by conventional scintigraphy with 111In-DTPA-

Octreotide and by PET imaging with 64Cu-TETA-Octreotide. Blood and urine samples were collected for 
pharmacokinetic analysis. PET images were collected at times ranging from 0 to 36 h after injection, 
and the absorbed doses to normal organs were determined. 
 In six of the eight patients, cancerous lesions were visible by both 111In-DTPA-Octreotide SPECT and 
64Cu-TETA- Octreotide PET. In one patient, 111In-DTPA-OC showed mild uptake in a lung lesion that 
was not detected by 64Cu-TETA-OC PET. In one patient, either agent detected no tumours; 
significantly, pathologic follow-up indicated that the patient had indeed no tumours. In two patients 
whose tumours were visualized with 111In-DTPA-Octreotide and 64Cu-TETA-Octreotide, 64Cu-TETA-
Octreotide and PET showed more lesions than 111In-DTPA-Octreotide. The study confirmed the 
feasibility of PET imaging of neuroendocrine tumours with the use of 64Cu-TETA-octreotide. In patients 
with multiple metastases, the 64Cu-TETA-octreotide PET scanning revealed some of the smaller lesions, 
especially hepatic metastases. Further the 64Cu-TETA-OC PET was able to detect osseous metastases 
not detected with planar scintigraphy.  
Pharmacokinetic studies showed that 64Cu-TETA-Octreotide was rapidly cleared from the blood and that 
59.2% +/- 17.6% of the injected dose were excreted in the urine. Absorbed dose measurements 
indicated that the bladder wall was the dose-limiting organ. Overall, the normal-organ dosimetry 
suggests that PET imaging with 111 MBq (3 mCi) 64Cu-TETA-OC gave reasonable absorbed doses to 
normal organs. 
Study 11: Philpott G.W., et al (J of Nuclear Medicine, 2001; 42:213-221), investigated 36 
patients with suspected advanced or primary colorectal cancer, by injecting anti-colorectal carcinoma 
monoclonal antibody (MAb 1A3) labelled with copper-64. All patients had CT scans and 18F-FDG-PET 
was performed in 18 patients for routine clinical assessment of tumour status. Tumour was confirmed 
in 21 patients by biopsy and in 8 patients by unequivocal findings on CT, MRI and/or PET with 2-[18F]-
fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG, 10mCi).  
Of the 56 confirmed tumour sites, PET detected 40 with 64Cu-MAb 1A3 as foci of increased activity 
(sensitivity = 71%). The abdominal and pelvic disease detection showed equal sensitivity for both 
MAb-PET and FDG-PET. When the results of the two studies were the same, the presence or absence of 
tumour was confirmed, but the combination of a negative MAb-PET and positive FDG-PET suggested an 
inflammatory lesion or other primary tumour. The positive predictive value of the PET 64Cu-MAb-1A3 
ranged from 89% to 96 %. Furthermore, PET scan detected 11 new occult tumour sites, including 9 
small abdomino-pelvic foci less that 2.0 cm in diameter that were not detected by CT or MRI. The 
study suggested that PET with 64Cu-MAb may have important applications in clinical oncology, 
particularly for detecting smaller colorectal tumour foci in the abdomen or pelvis.

Results are presented for tumours > 3 cm in diameter (diagonally lined bars); for tumours <

There were no complications, but significantly elevated HAMA titres were found in 28% of the 29 
patients tested 1 to 12 months after injection. There was no apparent dose-related effect from 5 to 20 
mg MAb 1A3.  
2.4.8.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The applicant did not submit a clinical study report to support the claimed indication, which is in line 
with the requirements of the Directive 2001/83/EC, Annex I, Part III-2.2 and accepted by the CHMP. 
The applicant provided clinical information from published clinical studies reports using the precursor 
attached to relevant carrier molecules in support for the claim of clinical utility of the radio-
pharmaceutical precursor.  
A potential clinical utility of copper 64 was highlighted in two studies discussed above. These include 
the use of 64Cu-TETA-octreotide in PET scanning of neuroendocrine tumours, which could allow better 
detection of small lesions and better detection of osseous disease, and the use of 64Cu-MAb 1A3 in PET 
scanning in colorectal cancer that could allow better detection of small lesions not detected by CT or 
MRI and enable differentiation of inflammatory lesions from malignant lesions. The differentiation 
between inflammatory and malignant lesions is sometimes difficult with the commonly used fluorine-18 
PET scanning. Therefore these studies do indicate a potential clinical utility for Cuprymina in the 
molecular imaging of tumours when attached to appropriate carrier molecules.  
PET imaging with the use of copper radionuclide-labelled dithiosemicarbazone (ATSM) is of potential 
clinical utility in the detection of hypoxic areas in tumours, which could predict outcomes to treatment 
and help plan better delivery of treatment such as radiotherapy. The majority of the studies discussed 
in support of this application are in relation to hypoxia imaging with copper labelled ATSM. Most of 
these studies have been done with the radioisotopes copper-60 or copper-62. It is reasonable to 
foresee that the same carrier molecules may be labelled with Cuprymina (copper-64). All radioisotopes 
of a chemical element have, by definition, the same chemical properties. Therefore there is theoretical 
support for the utility of copper-64 in the imaging of hypoxic tissue/ tumours. Further, as discussed 
above, in at least one study, superiority in image quality has been reported with the use of 64Cu-ATSM 
compared to 60Cu-ATSM (ref: study 8).

2.4.9.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
It is the view of the CHMP that clinical utility of Cuprymina attached to the relevant molecular carrier 
has been demonstrated for tumour imaging and hypoxia imaging.  According to Directive 2001/83/EC, 
as amended, Annex I Part III, this is considered sufficient for the purposes of this application. Further 
efficacy and safety data in particular indications will be assessed during the marketing authorisation 
application for carrier molecules proposing to use Cuprymina as a radiolabel. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
The applicant did not submit clinical safety study reports. Cuprymina is not intended to be 
administered directly to patients. 
The safety of this product as a radiolabelling agent will be evaluated as part of the application of the 
carrier/linker molecule which proposes to use Cuprymina as a radiolabelling nuclide. 
The  table  below  presents  the  dose  at  different  biological  half-lives,  both  for  the  maximum  activity  of 
the 64Cu and for the standard activity of 18F in 18F-FDG injection (260 MBq).

Comparison of 64Cu and 18F radioactivity dose at different half lives 
Based on these estimates, the exposure from 64Cu in a worst case scenario would be 3-15 times 
greater than a standard injection of 18F.  
Dosimetry 
The  radiation  dose  received  by  the  various  organs  following  intravenous  administration  of  a  64Cu-
labelled medicinal product is dependent on the specific molecule being radiolabelled. 
Information on radiation dosimetry of each different medicinal product following administration of the 
radiolabelled preparation will be available in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of 
the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. 
The dosimetry table below is presented in order to evaluate the contribution of non-conjugated 64Cu to 
the radiation dose following the administration of 64Cu-labelled medicinal product or resulting from an 
accidental intravenous injection of Cuprymina. 
The dosimetry estimates were based on a mouse distribution study and the calculations were effected 
using OLINDA - Organ Level INternal Dose Assessment Code (See Table 9). Time points for 
measurements were 2 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 2 days, 4 
days, 6 days.

Based on a biodistribution study in mice, the impact on male fertility was assessed and showed that 
the testes received a dose of 0.0463 mGy/MBq. Therefore on the basis that 1 GBq of activity is 
administered, a dose of 46.3 mGy would be received by the testes. The literature reference53 states 
350cGy as the threshold for temporary azoospermia and 2Gy for permanent azoospermia. In the worst 
case in which the maximum vial activity is administered (2.77 GBq), 12.7cGy to the testes were 
estimated. 
From the biodistribution table above, it is estimated that ovaries received a dose of 0.00314 mGy/MBq. 
In the worst case in which the maximum vial activity is administered (2.77 GBq), 0.869 cGy to the 
ovaries are estimated, more than 7 times less the dose believed to be safe for female fertility as per 
Ogilvy-Stuart and Shalet (1993)54.       
Disappearance of radioactivity 
Considering that each MBq of 64Cu causes a dose rate of 9 nSv/h (at a distance of 2 meters) and that 
the maximum injected activity is of 2770 MBq, the initial dose rate is 24930 nSv/h. 
Assuming that the environmental background value is 150 nSv/h, and requiring that the dose rate due 
to 64Cu is lower than the environmental background, the condition of negligible radioactivity in the 
patient is reached, in practice, 4 days after injection (dose rate 132 nSV/h) as shown in Table 10.

Safety in hospital personnel exposed to Cuprymina  
The dose to a person in close contact with the patient is largely due to gamma rays which have a high 
penetration. 
Gamma emission can be compared through the Gamma Constant that states the dose equivalent rate, 
in mSv h-1 at one meter from a point isotropic source of 1 MBq (Table 11). A comprehensive listing of 
gamma-dose constants has been published in 1982 by Oak Ridge National Laboratory55.

The gamma-ray constants are summarised, together with the thickness for 95% attenuation with a 
lead shield, for the relevant Cu isotopes and for 18F. In consideration of these data, 64Cu does not 
require significantly more shielding than other isotopes and it has the lowest Gamma Constant of all Cu 
isotopes that can be used for PET imaging and even lower than 18F, due to the low branching of the β+ 
emission (511 keV gamma rays) and the only de-excitation gamma ray emitted (1.346 MeV, 0.47% 
yield). Therefore, for very short exposures (so that decay can be neglected) and comparable activities, 
doses to the public from 64Cu-radiopharmaceuticals are lower than from 18F-radiopharmaceuticals. 
A worst case scenario estimate of the dose to a person in close contact with the patients has been 
provided, considering the 64Cu gamma dose constant of 1.6x10-5mSv.MBq-1.h-1 at a distance of 1 
metre. Assuming that the maximum activity (2770 MBq) is injected to the patient; and that 64Cu is 
labelled in a molecule with infinite biological half-live (i.e., no elimination by the patient); and a person 
in contact with the patient is continuously exposed (24h/24h) at a distance of 2 meter; it is estimated 
that the dose for a person in close contact with the patient is 0.46 mSv.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety of copper 
No clinical safety studies were submitted. This was considered acceptable as Cuprymina is a 
radioprecursor not intended to be injected to humans.  
The doses of Cuprymina expected to be administered are unlikely to be associated with toxicity from a 
copper overload. 
The radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of cancer and 
mutations. Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for 
Cuprymina

development of hereditary defects. In all cases, it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation 
are less than from the disease itself. The radiation dose received by the various organs following 
intravenous administration of a 64Cu-labelled molecule is dependent on the specific pharmaceutical 
being radiolabelled. Information on radiation dosimetry of each different medicinal product following 
administration of the radiolabelled preparation will be available in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. This information 
is included in the Cuprymina SmPC. 
For each patient, exposure to ionising radiation must be justifiable on the basis of likely clinical benefit. 
The activity administered must be such that the resulting radiation dose is as low as reasonably 
achievable bearing in mind the need to obtain the intended result. Cuprymina is contraindicated in the 
following cases:  
  Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
  Established  or  suspected  pregnancy  or  when  pregnancy  has  not  been  excluded  (see  section 
4.6). 
For information on contraindications to particular 64Cu-labelled medicinal products prepared by 
radiolabelling with Cuprymina, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet 
of each particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. 
Radiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in 
designated clinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the 
regulations and/or appropriate licences of the competent official organisation. 
Radiopharmaceuticals should be prepared by the user in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety 
and pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken. 
For information concerning special warnings and special precautions for use of 64Cu–labelled medicinal 
products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to 
be radiolabelled. It must be considered that the radiolabelled medicinal product emits high intensity 
Auger electrons. 
Regarding the dose for a person in close contact with the patient, this is entirely due to the gamma 
rays (Cuprymina emits 2 gamma rays at 511.0 Kev and 1,345.77 Kev), because β+ and β- emissions 
have no role due to their very short range. 
The 64Cu gamma dose constant is 3.6 x 10-5 mSv x MBq-1 x h at a distance of 1 meter. Assuming the 
worst case that the whole maximum activity (2,770 MBq) is injected to the patient and 64Cu is labelled 
to a molecule with infinite biological half-life (no disposal by the patient) the person is continuously 
exposed at a distance of 2 meters. With these assumptions the estimated dose for a person in close 
contact with the patient is 0.46 mSv, which is less than one half of the limit of not exposed people 
(1mSv/year). 
Special precautions for relatives, carers and hospital staff are provided in section 6.6 of the SmPC. 
Effects on ability to drive and to use machines following treatment by 64Cu-labelled medicinal products 
will be specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal 
product to be radiolabelled. 
Information has been provided in the SmPC regarding the use of chelating agents in the event on an 
inadvertent overdosage of Cuprymina (section 4.9 of the SmPC). 
Appropriate instructions for preparation of Cuprymina are provided in section 12 of the SmPC. 
Cuprymina

No interactions studies of Copper (64Cu) chloride with other medicinal products have been submitted. 
The possible use of chelating therapies could interfere with the use of 64Cu-labelled medicinal products. 
For information concerning interactions associated with the use of 64Cu-labelled medicinal products 
refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the radiolabelled medicinal product. 
Women of childbearing potential 
When an administration of radioactive medicinal products to a woman of childbearing potential is 
intended, it is important to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a 
period should be assumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. If in doubt about her potential 
pregnancy (if the woman has missed a period, if the period is very irregular, etc.), alternative 
techniques not using ionising radiation (if there are any) should be offered to the patient. 
Before the use of 64Cu-labelled medicinal products, pregnancy should be excluded using an 
adequate/validated test. 
Pregnancy 
The use of 64Cu-labelled medicinal products is contraindicated during established or suspected 
pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 4.3 of the SmPC). 
Breastfeeding 
Before administering radiopharmaceuticals to a mother who is breastfeeding, consideration should be 
given to the possibility of delaying the administration of radionuclide until the mother has ceased 
breastfeeding, and to the choice of the most appropriate radiopharmaceuticals, bearing in mind the 
secretion of activity in breast milk. If the administration is considered necessary, a breastfeeding 
mother should be advised to stop breastfeeding. 
The duration of stopping will depend on the particular radiolabelled medicinal product. 
Further information concerning the use of 64Cu-labelled medicinal products in pregnancy and 
breastfeeding is specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal product to be 
radiolabelled. 
Fertility 
According to literature reports, it may be considered that both spermatogenetic and genetic damage in 
male testis are unlikely at the dose of 1GBq. 
Further information concerning the effect on fertility of the use of 64Cu-labelled medicinal products is 
specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal product to be radiolabeled. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
For the purpose of an application for a radiopharmaceutical for radiolabelling, the safety of Cuprymina 
has been adequately addressed.

Routine Pharmacovigilance 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that routine pharmacovigilance 
was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.  
No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information. 
2.7.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits-Clinical utility 
Cuprymina is a radio-pharmaceutical precursor intended solely for radio-labelling purposes with other 
medicinal products such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates for radio-nuclide 
therapy. As a precursor, Cuprymina is not to be given directly to patients. 
Published experience of 64Cu showed the therapeutic utility in imaging of hypoxia and of tumours sites 
and metastases. Appropriate information to support an indication as a radio-pharmaceutical precursor 
for radiolabelling has been provided. Relevant non-clinical and clinical information related to the clinical 
Cuprymina 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/518790/2012

use of the carrier molecules, which have been specifically developed and authorised for radio-labelling 
with this radionuclide, are to be included in the SmPC of the carrier molecules. 
Risks 
There are no major safety concerns with regards to free Cuprymina as the doses of Cuprymina 
expected to be administered are unlikely to be associated with toxicity from a copper overload. 
Moreover, and as for all radioactive products, unfavourable effects relating to the radioactivity would 
be expected. These include carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and effects on different tissues. These would 
be dependent on the radiation characteristics of copper-64 in Cuprymina as well as on the carrier 
molecule to which Cuprymina is labelled. In addition to radiation exposure to the patient, the risk of 
radiation exposure to other individuals is also a risk, considering the emission of high energy gamma 
rays from copper-64. Exposure to ionising radiation must be justified on the basis of likely clinical 
benefit. However, the radiation safety of Cuprymina in its use as radiopharmaceutical precursor has 
been demonstrated. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
There are no unresolved quality issues, which would have a negative impact on the benefit/risk 
balance of the product. 
No clinical data relevant for the marketing authorisation application of this radiopharmaceutical 
precursor were submitted. However, sufficient appropriate literature reports on the clinical utility of 
64Cu labelled monoclonal antibodies and other 64Cu labelled substrates (64Cu-TETA-OC, 64Cu MAb-1A3, 
64Cu ATSM) in humans. 
Dosimetry has been calculated from a nude mouse non GLP biodistribution study providing data for the 
evaluation of human internal radiation dosimetry. Overall, for the purpose of an application for a 
radiopharmaceutical for radiolabelling, the safety of Cuprymina has been adequately addressed. 
In conclusion, a positive benefit/risk balance was demonstrated for Cuprymina in the use only for the 
radio-labelling of carrier molecules which have been specifically developed and authorised for radio-
labelling with this radionuclide. No additional pharmacovigilance activities or additional risk 
minimisation measures are required other than the information included in the SmPC. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Cuprymina as a radiopharmaceutical precursor, not intended for direct 
use in patients, and to be used only for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, which have been 
specifically developed and authorised for radiolabelling with this radionuclide, is favourable and 
therefore recommends  the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

marketing authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market. 
The MAH shall perform the pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as 
agreed in version 2 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing 
authorisation and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP. 
As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the 
updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR). 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
  When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, 
Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities 
  Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached  
 
at the request of the EMA

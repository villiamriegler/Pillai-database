Annex II 
Please refer to the assessment report:  
Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC and requested the 
CHMP to assess the impact of nitrosamine impurities 
on the benefit-risk balance of valsartan-containing 
medicinal products and to issue a recommendation 
on whether the relevant marketing authorisations 
should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
During the CHMP plenary meeting in September 
2018, the scope of the referral has been widened to 
include all sartans with a tetrazole group in their 
molecular structure (candesartan, irbesartan, 
losartan, olmesartan and valsartan). The CHMP 
Opinion was issued on 31 January 2019 and the 
Commission Decision was issued on 11 April 2019. 
In a letter dated 29 July 2020, the European 
Commission requested the EMA to assess the impact 
Copalia HCT EMEA/H/A-31/1471/C/1159/0069

of the outcome of the Article 5(3) assessment on 
nitrosamines adopted on 25 June 2020 on the 
CHMP’s opinion of 31 January 2019 for the scientific 
assessment and review under Article 31 of Directive 
2001/83/EC regarding angiotensin-II-receptor 
antagonists (sartans) containing a tetrazole group 
(EMEA/H/A-31/1471). The CHMP was requested to 
give its recommendation whether the conditions of 
the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.

Exforge HCT is a fixed dose combination (FDC) medicinal 
product containing amlodipine, a dihydropyridine 
derivative, valsartan, an angiotensin II antagonist and 
hydrochlorothiazide, a well-known thiazide diuretic. Exforge 
HCT is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension 
as substitution therapy in adult patients whose blood 
pressure is adequately controlled on the combination of 
amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), taken 
either as three single-component formulations or as a dual-
component and a single-component formulation. 
The efficacy data collected since the initial MAA on the 
combination of amlodipine/ valsartan/ HCTZ remain in 
accordance with the previous cumulative experience and 
the efficacy information presented in the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC). The safety data remain in

considered justified to update the list of ADRs in section 4.8 
‘undesirable effects’ of the Exforge SmPC and Exforge HCT 
SmPC and their respective clones based on additional 
information from a small number of post-marketing cases 
reporting bullous rash occurring with valsartan. This

Novartis Safety Database (ARGUS) was searched for all 
cases where both valsartan and lithium were reported as 
co-administered, and a literature search was performed for 
published studies.  
The available data suggest a possible reversible interaction 
between valsartan and lithium, although the exact 
mechanism has not been established. The data identified

are limited and no confirmatory evidence was available 
from the clinical trials performed. 
The SmPC has been updated to inform prescribers of the 
fact that reversible increases in serum lithium 
concentrations and toxicity have been reported during 
concomitant administration of lithium with ACE inhibitors, 
angiotensin II receptor antagonists including valsartan or 
thiazides. Since renal clearance of lithium is reduced by 
thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity may presumably be 
increased further with valsartan. Therefore, careful 
monitoring of serum lithium concentrations is 
recommended during concomitant use.

SmPC and PL 
The safety update of the SmPC and Package Leaflet was 
following a worksharing procedure according to 
Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008. 
WS-0252-G was a group of variations consisting of 
two Type II variations following a worksharing 
procedure according to Article 20 of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 as follows:  
Variation 1: Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to 
add a new warning regarding the risk of 
'angioedema' related to the valsartan compound. 
Further, the MAH took the opportunity to update the 
wording of the existing warnings in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC ('renal artery stenosis', 'heart failure', and 
'aortic and mitral valve stenosis') for increased 
clarity. The Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly; 
based on a review of the MAH’s safety and clinical trial data 
bases, published literature for both the amlodipine and 
valsartan components, a recommendation by the US FDA 
as well as the recent revised and harmonised amlodipine 
monotherapy (Norvasc) product information that was 
agreed by the CHMP as part of the article 30 referral 
procedure EMEA/H/A-30/1288 on 21 July 2011. 
The MAH presented an extensive analysis of both 
‘angioedema requiring intubation’ and ‘previous 
angioedema with or without ACE-inhibitor use’, based on 
data from their safety database and the clinical trial 
database. In addition, the MAH provided the outcome of a 
literature search. From the safety database, 42 patients out 
of 1469 ‘angioedema’ reports (2.86%) required intubation. 
In the clinical trial database there was a small number of 
patients with angioedema who also experienced an AE 
related to ‘respiratory distress’ (e.g. laryngospasm, 
Page 41/59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Variation 2: Update of sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.7, 
4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC to harmonise the 
existing wording related to the amlodipine compound 
in line with the latest SmPC of Norvasc (amlodipine 
monotherapy) approved as part of a recent article 30 
procedure EMEA/H/A-30/1288.  The Package Leaflet 
has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to update the contact details for 
the local representative for Malta in the Package 
Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
enotracheal intubation, laryngeal edema, mechanical 
ventilation, tracheostomy, respiratory distress, wheezing).   
The percentage of patients with a past history of 
angioedema across all studies was small. A total of 86 
patients out of the 1469 reports from the safety database 
had a previous episode of angioedema, in 40 of these the 
previous angioedema episode was associated with the use 
of an ACE-inhibitor and in 46 patients it was not. In 5/40 
and 12/46 cases, respectively, the index event was worse 
than the previous one. This does not indicate that a more 
severe angioedema event than that occurring in association 
with an ACE-inhibitor must necessarily be expected when 
valsartan is given for treatment subsequently.  
According to the literature, the frequency of angioedema 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
associated with ARBs seems lower than that observed with 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
ACE-inhibitors. Although some publications suggest a 
higher risk of angioedema with ARBs in patients who had 
already experienced angioedema with ACE-inhibitors, the 
frequency data reported in the literature are inconsistent. 
However, as angioedema is a potentially life-threatening 
and fatal adverse effect, the reviewed literature highlights 
that ACE-inhibitors or ARBs should be used with caution in 
patients with any history of this condition. 
The safety data provided by the MAH is regarded as 
sufficient in order to justify the proposed warning on 
‘angioedema’ in section 4.4 of the SmPC. It should also be 
noted that a warning regarding ‘angioedema’ is already 
included in the SmPC for Diovan (valsartan monotherapy).  
Additional changes to the wording of warnings already 
included in SmPC section 4.4 (“renal artery stenosis”, 
“heart failure” and “aortic and mitral valve stenosis”) were 
also made as part of this procedure in order to provide

following a worksharing procedure according to 
Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008. 
WS-0250-G was a group of variations consisting of 
two Type II variations following a worksharing 
procedure according to Article 20 of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 as follows:  
Variation 1: Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC to 
add information about the potential drug interaction 
between amlodipine and simvastatin, and update of 
the existing amlodipine information in section 4.5 in 
line with the revised drug interactions section for 
Norvasc (amlodipine monotherapy). The Package 
Leaflet has been updated accordingly; 
Variation 2: Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC to 
add information about the potential drug interaction 
between valsartan and inhibitors of the uptake 
transporter (rifampicin, ciclosporin) or efflux 
transporter (ritonavir). The Package Leaflet has been 
updated accordingly.

of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
juice is not recommended as bioavailability may be 
increased in some patients, resulting in increased blood 
pressure lowering effects. 
Concomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, 
macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil 
or diltiazem) may give rise to significant increase in 
amlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these 
pharmacokinetic variations may be more pronounced in the 
elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may thus 
be required. 
There is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 
inducers on amlodipine. The concomitant use of CYP3A4 
inducers (e.g. rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) may give 
a lower plasma concentration of amlodipine. Amlodipine 
should be used with caution together with CYP3A4 
inducers. 
Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg amlodipine 
with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% increase in 
exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It 
is recommended to limit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg 
daily in patients on amlodipine. 
In animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular 
collapse are observed in association with hyperkalaemia

dantrolene. Due to risk of hyperkalaemia, it is 
recommended that the co-administration of calcium 
channel blockers such as amlodipine be avoided in patients 
susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the 
management of malignant hyperthermia. 
In clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect the 
pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, digoxin, warfarin or 
ciclosporin. 
The results of an in vitro study with human liver tissue 
indicate that valsartan is a substrate of the hepatic uptake 
transporter OATP1B1 and of the hepatic efflux transporter 
MRP2. Co-administration of inhibitors of the uptake 
transporter (rifampicin, ciclosporin) or efflux transporter 
(ritonavir) may increase the systemic exposure to 
valsartan.

The safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been 
following a worksharing procedure according to 
Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008. 
WS-0253-G is a group of two variations (one type II 
& one type IB) following a worksharing procedure as 
follows: 
- Type II variation: Update of section 4.6 of the 
SmPC with wording on fertility in line with the SmPC 
for Diovan (valsartan monotherapy) and 5.3 of the 
SmPC to implement the changes to the SmPC for 
Diovan that was approved as part of a recent Article 
30 (referral) procedure; 
- Type IB variation: Update of sections 4.6 and 5.3 of

established. Reproductive studies in rats and mice have 
shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of 
labour and decreased pup survival at dosages 
approximately 50 times greater than the maximum 
recommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. Use in 
pregnancy is only recommended when there is no safer 
alternative and when the disease itself carries greater risk 
for the mother and foetus. 
Reversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa 
have been reported in some patients treated by calcium 
channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the 
potential effect of amlodipine on fertility. There was no 
effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males 
for 64 days and females 14 days prior to mating) at doses 
up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended 
human dose of 10 mg on a mg/m2 basis). In another rat 
study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine 
besilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human

dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma follicle-stimulating 
hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases 
in sperm density and in the number of mature spermatids 
and Sertoli cells. 
Rats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two 
years, at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage 
levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence 
of carcinogenicity. The highest dose (for mice, similar to, 
and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical 
dose of 10 mg on a mg/m2 basis) was close to the 
maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. 
Mutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at 
either the gene or chromosome levels. 
* Based on patient weight of 50 kg 
Valsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive 
performance of male or female rats at oral doses up to 200 
mg/kg/day. This dose is 6 times the maximum 
recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis (calculations 
assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans 
based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, 
repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential. 
In rats, maternally toxic doses (600 mg/kg/day) during the 
last days of gestation and lactation led to lower survival, 
lower weight gain and delayed development (pinna 
detachment and ear-canal opening) in the offspring (see 
section 4.6). These doses in rats (600 mg/kg/day) are 
approximately 18 times the maximum recommended 
human dose on a mg/m2 basis (calculations assume an 
oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). 
In non-clinical safety studies, high doses of valsartan (200 
to 600 mg/kg body weight) caused in rats a reduction of 
Page 47/59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, 
haematocrit) and evidence of changes in renal 
haemodynamics (slightly raised plasma urea, and renal 
tubular hyperplasia and basophilia in males). These doses 
in rats (200 and 600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 6 and 
18 times the maximum recommended human dose on a 
mg/m2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 320 
mg/day and a 60-kg patient). 
In marmosets at similar doses, the changes were similar 
though more severe, particularly in the kidney where the 
changes developed to a nephropathy which included raised 
urea and creatinine. 
Hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells was also 
seen in both species. All changes were considered to be 
caused by the pharmacological action of valsartan which 
produces prolonged hypotension, particularly in 
marmosets. For therapeutic doses of valsartan in humans, 
the hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not 
seem to have any relevance.

Literature review: Major drug reference books, including 
Martindale (HCTZ) and Meyler’s side effects (thiazide 
diuretics), were reviewed for unlisted adverse reactions, 
and bridging literature searches up to the cut-off date of 13 
Apr 2010 were performed as per PSUR search criteria 
(publication date from the PSUR 6 cut-off date: 31 Dec 
2009).  
As a consequence, sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.2 
of the SmPC have been updated and the Package Leaflet 
has been updated accordingly. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated to include a new 
warning on the potential risk of ‘acute angle-closure 
glaucoma’ associated with the use of hydrochlorothiazide. 
Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated 
with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in acute transient 
myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms 
include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular 
pain and typically occur within hours to a week of 
treatment initiation. Untreated acute-angle closure 
glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. 
The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide 
as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatment 
may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure 
remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute 
angle closure glaucoma may include a history of 
sulphonamide or penicillin allergy. 
Further, the following new ADRs have been added to 
section 4.8 of the SmPC: asthenia, pyrexia, erythema 
multiforme, aplastic anemia, renal disorder, muscle spasm

1.  Information on the procedure 
As part of the assessment of the Art. 31 referral procedure for sartans with a tetrazole ring, the CHMP 
recommended that the conditions for sartans with a tetrazole ring should be reviewed to take into 
account the recommendations from the Art. 5(3) on nitrosamines. On 29 July 2020 the EC sent a letter 
to EMA requesting the assessment of the impact of the outcome of the Article 5(3) assessment on 
nitrosamines adopted on 25 June 2020 on the CHMP opinion of 31 January 2019 for the scientific 
assessment and review under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC regarding angiotensin-II-receptor 
antagonists (sartans) containing a tetrazole group (EMEA/H/A-31/1471). 
The scope of this procedure is limited to medicinal products containing sartans with a tetrazole ring.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
In a letter dated 29 July 2020, the European Commission requested EMA to assess the impact of the 
outcome of the Article 5(3) assessment on nitrosamines adopted on 25 June 2020 on the CHMP 
opinion of 31 January 2019 for the scientific assessment and review under Article 31 of Directive 
2001/83/EC regarding angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists (sartans) containing a tetrazole group 
(EMEA/H/A-31/1471). 
The EC further asked if it is concluded that there is a need to review the recommendation which was 
given in 2019, this should be fully explained in a self-standing detailed opinion, including the scientific 
conclusions and grounds for the updated advice, including an assessment on the need to change the 
conditions to the marketing authorisations of angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists (sartans) medicines 
containing a tetrazole group. 
The CHMP confirmed during its September 2020 plenary meeting that the outcome of the Article 5(3) 
review on nitrosamine is relevant for the aforementioned Art. 31 referral on sartans with a tetrazole 
group and the Rapporteurs of the sartans referral were asked to provide an assessment on the matter. 
2.2.  Article 31 referral procedure on sartans with a tetrazole ring 
EU authorities were notified in June 2018 that an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) manufacturer 
(Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical, China) had detected the presence of a previously undetected 
impurity, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA, also known as dimethylnitrosamine) in the valsartan API 
manufactured at its site in Chuannan. Zhejiang Huahai is one of the API manufacturers that are 
supplying valsartan for medicinal products authorised in the EU.  
NDMA is a genotoxic and carcinogen agent in animals and it is classified as a probable human 
carcinogen by IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer, WHO). 
An initial investigation report on the root cause of the presence of NDMA by the manufacturer indicates 
that NDMA formed at a specific step in the valsartan API manufacturing process, and the level of NDMA 
present may depend on the reaction conditions used.  
The European Commission triggered on 5 July 2018 a referral under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and requested the CHMP to assess the impact of nitrosamine impurities on the benefit-risk balance of 
Assessment report

valsartan-containing medicinal products and to issue a recommendation on whether the relevant 
marketing authorisations should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
During the CHMP plenary meeting in September 2018, the scope of the referral has been widened to 
include all sartans with a tetrazole group in their molecular structure (candesartan, irbesartan, 
losartan, olmesartan and valsartan). 
Taking into account the available data, the CHMP considered in its opinion adopted on 14 February 
2019 that the benefit risk balance of medicines containing a sartan with a tetrazole ring remains 
positive subject to the conditions outlined below. The CHMP opinion was forwarded to the European 
Commission, which issued final legally binding decisions for the medicines concerned between 2 April 
and 17 April 2019 that are applicable in all EU Member States. 
The marketing authorisation holder(s) shall complete the below conditions, within the stated 
timeframe, and competent authorities shall ensure that the following is fulfilled: 
Conditions to the MA 
The MAH must ensure that the manufacturing processes of the drug substances 
used for their drug products are reviewed for the potential risk of formation of N-
nitrosamines and changed as necessary to minimise nitrosamine contamination as 
much as possible. 
For all N-nitrosamines, the MAH must ensure a control strategy is in place in drug 
substance batches used for their drug products.  
For N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), the MAH 
must introduce the following specifications for the drug substance:

Decision. 
Some marketing authorisation holders have already implemented the conditions imposed in 2019 and 
updated the terms of the marketing authorisation to take this into account. 
In June 2020, the European medicines regulatory network published the outcome of a lessons learned 
exercise on the presence of nitrosamines in sartan medicines. This includes recommendations to

help reduce the risk of impurities in medicines and ensure that regulators are better prepared to 
manage cases of unexpected impurities. 
2.3.  Article 5(3) scientific opinion on nitrosamines in medicinal products 
for human use 
Building on the Article 31 referral on sartans with a tetrazole ring and the knowledge acquired on N-
nitrosamines in medicinal products, EMA together with the EU Network and international partners has 
continued the review of medicinal products to identify if there are any risks of nitrosamine presence 
outside the class of sartans.  
Taking into account that N-nitrosamines have been found in sartans with a tetrazole ring but also in 
other API/medicinal products (e.g. in some batches of pioglitazone and ranitidine) on 10 September 
2019 the EMA’s Executive Director initiated a procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004, and requested the CHMP to further investigate the issues at stake and to give a scientific 
opinion on  
• 
• 
considerations for MAHs for medicinal products for human use containing chemically synthesised 
active pharmaceutical ingredients on the identification of the possible presence of N-nitrosamine 
impurities in their medicinal products (“call for review”); and 
all  available  scientific  knowledge  on  N-nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicines  containing 
chemically  synthesised  active  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  impact  on  the  safe  use  of 
medicines.  In  this  exercise  the  CHMP  could  seek  the  support  of  additional  experts  and 
stakeholders as needed. Such evaluation should include the need whether or not to broaden the 
scope,  in  a  next  phase,  to  products  other  than  human  medicines  containing  chemically 
synthesised active pharmaceutical ingredients. 
Based on the assessment of all available data and consultations with external experts, PRAC, and 
Working Parties, the CHMP adopted on 25 June 2020 the following recommendations in its opinion 
under Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) no 726/2004: 
1. 
The presence of N-nitrosamines in human medicinal products shall be mitigated as much as 
possible and shall be at or below a limit based on ICH M7(R1) principles for substances of the 
“cohort of concern” defined in this guideline and calculated considering a lifetime daily exposure. 
This should be achieved by an appropriate control strategy and by the design or adaptation of the 
manufacturing processes aiming to prevent formation of and contamination with nitrosamines 
whenever possible.  
2. 
The risk of presence of nitrosamines must be evaluated by the MAHs/Applicants. In case of risk, 
confirmatory testing must be performed.  
• 
A risk evaluation/risk assessment for the presence of nitrosamines must be submitted for 
new marketing authorization applications at the time of submission, and for already 
authorized medicinal products containing chemically synthesised active pharmaceutical 
ingredients (APIs) as per the ‘call for review’1 and for biological medicinal products in a 
similar exercise as per instructions to be published in a Questions and Answers 
document2.

• 
• 
The approach for risk evaluation/risk assessment should cover manufacturing processes of 
active substance and finished product in consideration of the root-causes, and subsequent 
confirmatory testing in the finished product, in case a risk is identified. 
Although the overall risk of presence of nitrosamines in biological medicinal products is 
considered very low, the following risk factors should be taken into consideration: 
biologicals containing chemically synthesized fragments, where risk factors similar to 
chemically synthesized active substances are present, biologicals using processes where 
nitrosating reagents are deliberately added, or those packaged in certain primary 
packaging material, such as blister packs containing nitrocellulose. 
3.  Where a nitrosamine has been detected, a limit based on the above-mentioned ICH M7(R1) 
principles for “cohort of concern” substances considering a lifetime daily exposure should be 
calculated.  
The following limits have been established for some specific N-nitrosamines and should be 
applied: 
N-Nitrosamine (CAS 
ng/day*** 
number) 
NDMA* (62-75-9) 
NDEA*(55-18-5) 
EIPNA**(16339-04-1) 
DIPNA**(601-77-4) 
NMBA**(61445-55-4) 
MeNP**(16339-07-4) 
NDBA**(924-16-3) 
96.0 
26.5 
26.5 
26.5 
96.0 
26.5 
26.5 
These limits are applicable only if a finished product contains a single N-nitrosamine.  
*  Limit calculated on the basis of harmonic mean TD50 derived from carcinogenic potency 
database (CPDB) 
**Limit derived using SAR/read-across approach 
***The conversion to a specification limit in ppm for a particular medicinal product is 
calculated by dividing the respective above limit (ng) by the maximum daily dose (mg) of a 
given product as reflected in the SmPC. 
• 
• 
• 
The limit as calculated above will usually need to be included in the finished product 
specification.  
Skip testing is only justified if it can be shown that the levels of the respective nitrosamine 
are consistently ≤ 30% of the limit defined above and the root cause is identified and well-
understood. 
Omission from the specification is only justified if it can be shown that the levels of the 
respective nitrosamine are consistently ≤ 10% of the limit defined above and the root 
cause is identified and well-understood. 
4. 
If more than one N-nitrosamine is identified in a given finished product (or its API), it must be

ensured that the total risk level of the sum of all detected N-nitrosamines does not exceed 1 in 
100,000 life-time risk. An alternative approach where the sum of all detected N-nitrosamines 
does not exceed the limit of the most potent N-nitrosamine identified may also be used. The 
approach chosen for a particular case needs to be duly justified by the applicant/MAH. 
5. 
Exceptionally, when a single N-nitrosamine cannot be kept below the limit defined in 3. or the 
total risk level of the sum of more than one detected N-nitrosamine cannot be kept below a 1 in 
100,000 life-time risk, the MAH should submit to the relevant competent authorities forthwith an 
investigation report including the potential/identified root cause(s), preventive/corrective actions 
and a thorough discussion on the impact on the benefit/risk balance including all relevant 
considerations (e.g. medical need, daily dose, duration of administration and treatment 
alternatives, potential patient risk in case of drug shortage). Acceptability of limits higher than 
those defined in 3 and 4. is then decided by the relevant competent authorities on a case-by-
case basis, after having performed a benefit/risk evaluation. In such instances, the “less-than-
lifetime” (LTL) concept in ICH M7(R1) may be considered by the competent authorities for the 
range of a temporarily acceptable exposure until further measures can be implemented to 
reduce the contaminant at or below the limits defined in point 3 and 4. 
6. 
Exceptions to sections 3 and 4 include some products falling outside the scope of the ICH 
M7(R1) guideline, i.e. certain active substances and finished products intended for advanced 
cancer indications or when the active substance is itself genotoxic. For finished products 
intended only for advanced cancer, N-nitrosamine impurities should be controlled according to 
ICH Q3A(R2) and ICH Q3B(R2), as specified in the Q&A document to ICH S9. When the active 
substance itself is genotoxic at therapeutic concentrations, N-nitrosamine impurities could be 
controlled at limits for non-mutagenic impurities according to ICH M7(R1). 
7.  When N-nitrosamines are identified with sufficient substance specific animal carcinogenicity data 
to calculate a reliable TD50 then this should be used to derive a substance specific limit for 
lifetime exposure as recommended in ICH M7(R1). 
8.  When N-nitrosamines are identified with insufficient substance specific data to derive a 
substance specific limit for lifetime exposure as recommended in ICH M7(R1), a class specific 
Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) for nitrosamines of 18 ng/day can be used as default 
option. This TTC has been derived from the Lhasa carcinogenic potency database and is 
considered a conservative and acceptable approach.  If a MAH intends using a higher limit than 
18 ng/day, an approach based on structure-activity-relationship (SAR) considerations is 
acceptable. The approach taken needs to be duly justified by the applicant/MAH. 
9. 
MAHs should implement a control strategy regarding N-nitrosamines for their active substances 
and finished products, which should include current and prospective measures to minimise the 
risk of generation/contamination with any nitrosamine (e.g. change of manufacturing process, 
introduction of appropriate specifications and development of appropriate methods, measures 
related to the premises and equipment e.g. cleaning procedures, environmental monitoring,…) 
and control any future change that may impact on this risk (e.g. change of supplier, change of 
manufacturing process, change of packaging…) 
In order to fulfil their obligations above, MAH/applicants shall: 
• 
carry out risk evaluation/risk assessment of manufacturing processes of API (route of 
synthesis, starting materials, intermediates, raw materials) in view of potential formation 
of or contamination with N-nitrosamines, taking into account potential and confirmed root 
causes for the presence of N-nitrosamines in APIs.  
Assessment report 
EMA/47245/2021 
Page 7/15 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
carry out risk evaluation/risk assessment of finished product (degradation of API, primary 
packaging material, excipients, etc.), taking into account the root-causes for the presence 
of N-nitrosamines in finished products. 
ensure that, in accordance with Article 23 and Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 
16 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, their medicinal products are manufactured and 
controlled by means of processes and methods in compliance with the latest state of 
scientific and technical progress. As a consequence, MAHs/Applicants shall design their 
manufacturing processes and controls to prevent if possible or mitigate as much as 
possible the presence of N-nitrosamines in their API and finished product(s) and shall 
introduce any subsequent changes to their manufacturing process as needed. 
• 
ensure that active substances and excipients used in their finished products are 
manufactured in compliance with good manufacturing practices as laid down in Article 
46(f) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
•  MAHs’/Applicants’ compliance with the above-mentioned obligations is subject to regular 
controls by competent authorities including during inspections. 
10.  With regard to the analytical method(s) employed the following is advised: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) provides the minimum level at which an analyte can be 
quantified with acceptable accuracy and precision and should thus be used to define the 
required analytical sensitivity for impurity testing. 
If quantitative testing is performed as a routine control, the LoQ should be at or below the 
limit for the respective nitrosamine impurity defined in 3.  
If quantitative testing is performed to justify skip testing, the LoQ of the analytical 
procedure employed should be ≤ 30% of the limit defined in 3. 
If quantitative testing is performed to justify omission of specification, the LoQ of the 
analytical method employed should be ≤ 10% of the limit defined in 3. 
•  Higher sensitivity of analytical methods may be needed for medicinal products used at 
high daily doses or in case more than one nitrosamine is anticipated or identified in a 
given medicinal product. Such cases should be discussed with the relevant competent 
authority/ies. 
•  Different analytical methods may be used for determination of multiple nitrosamines. If 
the same analytical method is used for multiple nitrosamines, the selectivity of the method 
should be demonstrated at the LoQ for each nitrosamine.  
11.  Although further epidemiological studies would be useful to better characterize the relationship 
between nitrosamine exposure from medicinal products and cancer risk, critical challenges have 
been identified such as large sample size, long study duration, determination of exposure, 
identification of confounding factors and adequate control group which would be necessary to 
achieve meaningful and interpretable results. Nationwide registries or large healthcare database 
might be the most promising approach but may not contain all important information. In such 
cases, data linkage to other data sources that may contain the missing information should be 
checked prior to study initiation. Furthermore, the possibility of a meta-analytical approach may 
be considered in case of insufficient patient numbers in a given data source.

3.  Assessment of the impact of the outcome of the Article 
5(3) assessment on the CHMPs opinion of 31 January 2019 
for the scientific assessment and review under Article 31 of 
Directive 2001/83/EC regarding angiotensin-II-receptor 
antagonists (sartans) containing a tetrazole group 
(EMEA/H/A-31/1471) 
Based on the knowledge acquired on the presence of nitrosamines in medicinal products since the 
sartans referral and taking into account the data assessed within the Art 5(3) review, in particular 
related to the methodology to calculate the limits in case of (poly)contamination and potential root 
causes, the CHMP considered that the outcome of the sartans referral should be amended to take into 
account the outcome of the Art. 5(3) review. Having considered that the sartan case is well 
characterised and the API processes were identified as the main and often only root-cause, the CHMP 
is of the view that there is no specific aspect that would warrant a general exception for sartans with a 
tetrazole ring.  
In the Art 5(3) review, the CHMP did not support the approach to control nitrosamines based on 
analytical capability (i.e., technical limit applied at active pharmaceutical ingredient level), as this does 
not take into account toxicological data, and limits may be different for different nitrosamines. 
Furthermore, it could lead to different actual exposures depending on the daily dose of the medicinal 
product. Nitrosamines should also be controlled usually at the level of the finished product, as several 
root causes emerged that are related to finished product manufacturing. The control point for 
nitrosamines should be selected in such a way that it will give assurance of presence of the impurity 
below the acceptable limit in the finished product. 
The CHMP considers that those recommendations adopted in the Art 5(3) review are also relevant to 
sartans with tetrazole ring as follows, with the below rationale added. 
3.1.  Limits for nitrosamines applicable if a drug product contains a single 
N-nitrosamine 
The CHMP agrees that the limits for finished products for NDMA, NDEA, N-nitrosoethylisopropylamine 
(EIPNA), N-nitrosodiisopropylamine (DIPNA), N-methyl-4-aminobutyric acid (NMBA), 1-nitroso-4-
methyl piperazine (MeNP) and N-Nitrosodibutylamine (NDBA) mentioned in the Art.5(3) assessment 
report (see table below) and limits for further nitrosamines reflected in the Q&A on nitrosamines 
(EMA/409815/2020) should apply also for the finished products containing sartans with a tetrazole 
ring, in case their formation can be expected based on the risk assessment.

26.5 
In view of the multiple potential sources of contamination with nitrosamines, the CHMP considers that 
these limits should be applied to the finished sartan products in line with the Art. 5(3) recommendation 
instead of the API only, as is currently requested. In addition, the same control strategies and testing 
modalities as described in the Art.5(3) report should apply. 
Consequently, the limits requested as part of the Conditions to the Marketing authorisations need to be 
amended accordingly. 
By analogy, the below recommendations apply for sartans with a tetrazole ring: 
- When N-nitrosamines other than the above are identified with sufficient substance specific animal 
carcinogenicity data to calculate a reliable TD50 this should be used to derive a substance specific AI for 
lifetime exposure as recommended in ICH M7. 
- When N-nitrosamines are identified with insufficient substance specific toxicological data to derive a 
substance specific AI, based on the Art 5(3) assessment, a class specific TTC for nitrosamines of 18 
ng/day can be used, which has been derived from the Lhasa carcinogenic potency database and is 
considered a conservative and acceptable approach. If a MAH intends using a higher limit, an approach 
based on SAR considerations is acceptable. This approach should adhere to the principles also outlined 
in the Art 5(3) assessment report and needs to be duly justified by the applicant/MAH. 
3.2.  Limits in the case of presence of more than one nitrosamine  
While the Art. 31 referral for sartans did not allow simultaneous nitrosamine contaminations in the 
same API, the CHMP considered as part of the Art 5(3) review that two approaches for determining 
limits in the case of presence of more than one nitrosamine are considered acceptable in order not to 
exceed the acceptable 1:100,000 additional risk level as outlined in ICH M7(R1):  
1. The sum of all identified N-nitrosamines not to exceed the AI of the most potent N-
nitrosamine identified, or  
2. Total risk level of the sum of all detected N-nitrosamines not to exceed 1 in 100,000. 
The approach chosen for a particular case needs to be duly justified by the applicant/MAH. 
As the levels in the finished product will be kept below a 1:100,000 excess lifetime risk (as with single 
contaminations), the CHMP considers that the above approach is also considered acceptable for 
sartans. 
Exceptionally, when the presence of a single or more than one N-nitrosamine cannot be kept at or 
below the above limit/an excess lifetime risk of 1:100,000 despite adequate process development and 
an adequate control strategy, a thorough benefit/risk assessment including all relevant considerations 
(e.g. medical need, daily dose, duration of administration and treatment alternatives, potential patient

risk in case of drug shortage) should be submitted to the relevant competent authorities. Acceptability 
of limits higher than the above limits is then decided by the relevant competent authorities on a case-
by-case basis. 
3.3.  Testing modalities 
The CHMP considers that the recommendations on analytical method(s) employed would also be 
applicable to the sartans with a tetrazole ring as with any other medicinal product as with the 
knowledge gained in the Article 5(3) review there is no rational that could justify that these 
recommendations would not apply to sartans with tetrazole ring. The following testing modalities 
should therefore apply, and the conditions need to be revised accordingly: 
o 
If a risk has been identified for the finished product manufacturing or nitrosamines have been 
detected in the finished product but the actual source or the stage at which the contamination 
enters the process is unclear, a routine test of the finished product is expected. 
The limit will usually need to be included in the finished product specification as 
recommended in the Art 5(3) procedure. In the case of sartans, this means that the 
specification will need to be set for the finished product instead of the API, however, if duly 
justified the control point for nitrosamines can be selected in such a way that it will give 
assurance of presence of the impurity below the limit in the finished product. 
o  With regard to the analytical method(s) employed the following is advised: 
 
If quantitative testing is performed as a routine control, the LoQ should be ≤ the relevant 
limit based on the principles of ICH M7 for cohort of concern substances (referred to as 
acceptable intake (AI) in the guideline) for the respective nitrosamine impurity.  
  Different analytical methods may be used for determination of multiple nitrosamines. If the 
same analytical method is used for multiple nitrosamines, the selectivity of the method 
should be demonstrated for each nitrosamine.  
 
 
If quantitative testing is performed to justify skip testing, the LoQ of the analytical 
procedure employed should be ≤ 30% of the limit. 
If quantitative testing is performed to justify omission of testing, the LoQ of the analytical 
method should be ≤ 10% of the limit.  
3.4.  Impact on Sartans Conditions  
Overall, The CHMP considered that there is no specific aspect that would warrant a general exception 
for sartans with a tetrazole ring, and agreed moving the NDMA and NDEA specifications from the active 
substance to the finished product, with a limit according to ICH M7 principles for cohort of concern 
substances for lifelong exposure. In addition, the Art 5(3) recommendations on multiple nitrosamine 
contaminations, omission of testing and the option of skip testing are also applicable. A condition is 
included in order to request MAHs to adapt the current modalities of the NDMA/NDEA testing to the 
modalities defined in the Article 5(3). The MAHs have the opportunity as part of the implementation of 
this condition to request omission of the specification on the finished product or skip testing if justified 
and based on evidence. Should the MAHs not have sufficient evidence at this stage to request omission

Page 11/15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the specification or skip testing, this could be requested at later stage once the necessary evidence 
is available. 
In general, the risk assessment and implementation of the mitigation measures for finished products 
sartans with a tetrazole ring can follow the timelines of the call for review for products containing 
chemically manufactured active substances, considering the effort needed to fully elucidate any 
potential risks and carry out testing, e.g. for other nitrosamines. The deadline for the conduct of the 
risk assessment and implementation of mitigation measures for the active substance is maintained, i.e. 
two years following initial Commission Decision, as it can be expected that MAHs have already 
progressed fulfilling or have already fulfilled this condition. 
Based on the above scientific considerations, the outcome of the Art. 31 sartans referral should be 
aligned with the outcome of the Art. 5(3) review. Thus, the following highlighted changes to the 
current conditions to the MAs for sartans imposed in the context of the Article 31 referral procedure for 
these products, are recommended: 
Conditions to the MA 
The MAH must ensure that the manufacturing processes of the drug active 
substances used for their drug finished products are reviewed for the potential risk 
of formation of N-nitrosamines and changed as necessary to minimise nitrosamine 
contamination as much as possible in line with the recommendations adopted by 
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use on 25 June 2020 in the 
procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 on Nitrosamines 
impurities in human medicinal products (Article 5(3) procedure).

The limit will usually need to be included in the finished product specification. 
Omission from the specification is only justified if it can be shown that the levels 
of the respective N-nitrosamines are consistently ≤ 10% of the limit defined above 
and the root cause is identified and well-understood. 
Skip testing is only justified if it can be shown that the levels of the respective N-
nitrosamines are consistently ≤ 30% of the limits defined above and the root 
cause is identified and well-understood. 
In accordance with the recommendations adopted on N-nitrosamines impurities in 
human medicinal products (Article 5(3) procedure), where the co-presence of the 
above N-nitrosamines has been identified in the same finished product, it must be 
ensured that the cumulative risk of these N-nitrosamines does not exceed a 
lifetime cancer risk (lifelong exposure) of 1:100,000. An alternative approach 
where the sum of these two N-nitrosamines does not exceed the limit of the most 
potent N-nitrosamine identified (NDEA) may also be used. The approach chosen 
for a particular case needs to be duly justified by the MAH.  
The MAH shall ensure that the control strategy for all N-nitrosamines is updated 
accordingly. 
After the transitional period of 2 years, a limit for NDMA and NDEA of maximum 
0.03 ppm should be implemented.

Decision  
4.  Recommendations and next steps 
Based on the review of all available data on safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers that the benefit-
risk balance of medicinal products containing sartans with a tetrazole ring remains favourable and that 
the recommendations adopted in the nitrosamines Art 5(3) procedure are implemented also in the 
sartans with a tetrazole ring MA dossier. 
Without prejudice to the following conditions, MAHs are reminded to follow the instructions of the call 
for review4 for the assessment of the risk of presence of nitrosamines in their medicinal products and 
confirmatory testing if needed.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Ofev is indicated in adults for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
Ofev is also indicated in adults for the treatment of other chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases 
(ILDs) with a progressive phenotype (see section 5.1).
Ofev is indicated in adults for the treatment of systemic sclerosis associated interstitial lung disease 
(SSc-ILD).
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the management of diseases for which 
Ofev is approved.
Posology
Adults
The recommended dose is 150 mg nintedanib twice daily administered approximately 12 hours apart.
The 100 mg twice daily dose is only recommended to be used in patients who do not tolerate the 
150 mg twice daily dose.
2
If a dose is missed, administration should resume at the next scheduled time at the recommended dose.
If a dose is missed the patient should not take an additional dose. The recommended maximum daily 
dose of 300 mg should not be exceeded.
Dose adjustments
In addition to symptomatic treatment if applicable, the management of adverse reactions to Ofev (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.8) could include dose reduction and temporary interruption until the specific 
adverse reaction has resolved to levels that allow continuation of therapy. Ofev treatment may be 
resumed at the full dose (150 mg twice daily in adult patients) or a reduced dose (100 mg twice daily
in adult patients). If an adult patient does not tolerate 100 mg twice daily, treatment with Ofev should 
be discontinued.
If diarrhoea, nausea and/or vomiting persist despite appropriate supportive care (including anti-emetic 
therapy), dose reduction or treatment interruption may be required. The treatment may be resumed at a 
reduced dose (100 mg twice daily in adult patients) or at the full dose (150 mg twice daily in adult 
patients). In case of persisting severe diarrhoea, nausea and/or vomiting despite symptomatic 
treatment, therapy with Ofev should be discontinued (see section 4.4).
In case of interruptions due to aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
elevations > 3× upper limit of normal (ULN), once transaminases have returned to baseline values, 
treatment with Ofev may be reintroduced at a reduced dose (100 mg twice daily in adult patients) 
which subsequently may be increased to the full dose (150 mg twice daily in adult patients) 
(see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
Special populations
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years)
No overall differences in safety and efficacy were observed for elderly patients. No a-priori dose 
adjustment is required in elderly patients. Patients ≥ 75 years may be more likely to require dose 
reduction to manage adverse effects (see section 5.2).
Renal impairment
Adjustment of the starting dose in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment is not required. 
The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of nintedanib have not been studied in patients with severe 
renal impairment (< 30 mL/min creatinine clearance).
Hepatic impairment
In adult patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A), the recommended dose of Ofev is 
100 mg twice daily approximately 12 hours apart. In patients with mild hepatic impairment 
(Child Pugh A), treatment interruption or discontinuation for management of adverse reactions should 
be considered. The safety and efficacy of nintedanib have not been investigated in patients with 
hepatic impairment classified as Child Pugh B and C. Treatment of patients with moderate 
(Child Pugh B) and severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment with Ofev is not recommended (see 
section 5.2).
Paediatric population
Nintedanib should not be used in children (see section 4.8 and 5.1).
Method of administration
Ofev is for oral use. The capsules should be taken with food, swallowed whole with water, and should 
not be chewed. The capsule should not be opened or crushed (see section 6.6).
4.3 Contraindications


Pregnancy (see section 4.6)
Hypersensitivity to nintedanib, to peanut or soya, or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1.

Special warnings and precautions for use
Gastrointestinal disorders
Diarrhoea
In the clinical trials (see section 5.1), diarrhoea was the most frequent gastro-intestinal adverse 
reaction reported (see section 4.8). In most patients, the adverse reaction was of mild to moderate 
intensity and occurred within the first 3 months of treatment.
Serious cases of diarrhoea leading to dehydration and electrolyte disturbances have been reported in 
the post-marketing. Patients should be treated at first signs with adequate hydration and anti-diarrhoeal 
medicinal products, e.g. loperamide, and may require dose reduction or treatment interruption. Ofev 
treatment may be resumed at a reduced dose or at the full dose (see section 4.2 Dose adjustments). In 
case of persisting severe diarrhoea despite symptomatic treatment, therapy with Ofev should be 
discontinued.
Nausea and vomiting
Nausea and vomiting were frequently reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions (see section 4.8). In 
most patients with nausea and vomiting, the event was of mild to moderate intensity. In clinical trials, 
nausea led to discontinuation of Ofev in up to 2.1% of patients and vomiting led to discontinuation of 
Ofev in up to 1.4% of patients.
If symptoms persist despite appropriate supportive care (including anti-emetic therapy), dose reduction 
or treatment interruption may be required. The treatment may be resumed at a reduced dose or at the 
full dose (see section 4.2 Dose adjustments). In case of persisting severe symptoms therapy with Ofev 
should be discontinued.
Hepatic function
The safety and efficacy of Ofev has not been studied in patients with moderate (Child Pugh B) or 
severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment. Therefore, treatment with Ofev is not recommended in 
such patients (see section 4.2). Based on increased exposure, the risk for adverse reactions may be 
increased in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A). Adult patients with mild hepatic 
impairment (Child Pugh A) should be treated with a reduced dose of Ofev (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Cases of drug-induced liver injury have been observed with nintedanib treatment, including severe 
liver injury with fatal outcome. The majority of hepatic events occur within the first three months of 
treatment. Therefore, hepatic transaminase and bilirubin levels should be investigated before treatment
initiation and during the first month of treatment with Ofev. Patients should then be monitored at 
regular intervals during the subsequent two months of treatment and periodically thereafter, e.g. at 
each patient visit or as clinically indicated.
Elevations of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, blood alkaline phosphatase (ALKP), gamma-glutamyl-
transferase (GGT), see section 4.8) and bilirubin were reversible upon dose reduction or interruption in 
the majority of cases. If transaminase (AST or ALT) elevations > 3× ULN are measured, dose 
reduction or interruption of the therapy with Ofev is recommended and the patient should be 
monitored closely. Once transaminases have returned to baseline values, treatment with Ofev may be 
resumed at the full dose or reintroduced at a reduced dose which subsequently may be increased to the 
full dose (see section 4.2 Dose adjustments). If any liver test elevations are associated with clinical 
signs or symptoms of liver injury, e.g. jaundice, treatment with Ofev should be permanently 
discontinued. Alternative causes of the liver enzyme elevations should be investigated.
Adult patients with low body weight (< 65 kg), Asian and female patients have a higher risk of 
elevations of liver enzymes. Nintedanib exposure increased linearly with patient age, which may also 
result in a higher risk of developing liver enzyme elevations (see section 5.2). Close monitoring is 
recommended in patients with these risk factors.
4
Renal function
Cases of renal impairment/failure, in some cases with fatal outcome, have been reported with 
nintedanib use (see section 4.8).
Patients should be monitored during nintedanib therapy, with particular attention to those patients 
exhibiting risk factors for renal impairment/failure. In case of renal impairment/failure, therapy 
adjustment should be considered (see section 4.2 Dose adjustments).
Haemorrhage
Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibition might be associated with an increased 
risk of bleeding.
Patients at known risk for bleeding including patients with inherited predisposition to bleeding or 
patients receiving a full dose of anticoagulative treatment were not included in the clinical trials. Non-
serious and serious bleeding events, some of which were fatal, have been reported in the post-
marketing period (including patients with or without anticoagulant therapy or other medicinal products 
that could cause bleeding). Therefore, these patients should only be treated with Ofev if the anticipated 
benefit outweighs the potential risk.
Arterial thromboembolic events
Patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or stroke were excluded from the clinical trials.
In the clinical trials in adult patients, arterial thromboembolic events were infrequently reported (Ofev 
2.5% versus placebo 0.7% for INPULSIS; Ofev 0.9% versus placebo 0.9% for INBUILD; Ofev 0.7% 
versus placebo 0.7% for SENSCIS). In the INPULSIS trials, a higher percentage of patients 
experienced myocardial infarctions in the Ofev group (1.6%) compared to the placebo group (0.5%), 
while adverse events reflecting ischaemic heart disease were balanced between the Ofev and placebo 
groups. In the INBUILD trial, myocardial infarction was observed with low frequency: Ofev 0.9% 
versus placebo 0.9%. In the SENSCIS trial, myocardial infarction was observed with low frequency in 
the placebo group (0.7%) and not observed in the Ofev group.
Caution should be used when treating patients at higher cardiovascular risk including known coronary 
artery disease. Treatment interruption should be considered in patients who develop signs or 
symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia.
Aneurysms and artery dissections
The use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the 
formation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating Ofev, this risk should be carefully 
considered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm.
Venous thromboembolism
In the clinical trials, no increased risk of venous thromboembolism was observed in nintedanib treated 
patients. Due to the mechanism of action of nintedanib patients might have an increased risk of 
thromboembolic events.
Gastrointestinal perforations and ischaemic colitis
In the clinical trials in adult patients, the frequency of patients with perforation was up to 0.3% in both 
treatment groups. Due to the mechanism of action of nintedanib, patients might have an increased risk 
of gastrointestinal perforations. Cases of gastrointestinal perforations and cases of ischaemic colitis, 
some of which were fatal, have been reported in the post-marketing period. Particular caution should 
be exercised when treating patients with previous abdominal surgery, previous history of peptic 
ulceration, diverticular disease or receiving concomitant corticosteroids or NSAIDs. Ofev should only 
be initiated at least 4 weeks after abdominal surgery. Therapy with Ofev should be permanently 
discontinued in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation or ischaemic colitis. Exceptionally, 
Ofev can be reintroduced after complete resolution of ischaemic colitis and careful assessment of 
patient’s condition and other risk factors.
Nephrotic range proteinuria and thrombotic microangiopathy
Very few cases of nephrotic range proteinuria with or without renal function impairment have been 
reported post-marketing. Histological findings in individual cases were consistent with glomerular 
microangiopathy with or without renal thrombi. Reversal of the symptoms has been observed after  
5
Ofev was discontinued, with residual proteinuria in some cases. Treatment interruption should be 
considered in patients who develop signs or symptoms of nephrotic syndrome.
VEGF pathway inhibitors have been associated with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including 
very few case reports for nintedanib. If laboratory or clinical findings associated with TMA occur in a 
patient receiving nintedanib, treatment with nintedanib should be discontinued and thorough 
evaluation for TMA should be completed.
Hypertension
Administration of Ofev may increase blood pressure. Systemic blood pressure should be measured 
periodically and as clinically indicated.
Pulmonary hypertension
Data on the use of Ofev in patients with pulmonary hypertension is limited.
Patients with significant pulmonary hypertension (cardiac index ≤ 2 L/min/m², or parenteral 
epoprostenol/treprostinil, or significant right heart failure) were excluded from the INBUILD and 
SENSCIS trials.
Ofev should not be used in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension. Close monitoring is 
recommended in patients with mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Wound healing complication
No increased frequency of impaired wound healing was observed in the clinical trials. Based on the 
mechanism of action nintedanib may impair wound healing. No dedicated studies investigating the 
effect of nintedanib on wound healing were performed. Treatment with Ofev should therefore only be 
initiated or – in case of perioperative interruption – resumed based on clinical judgement of adequate 
wound healing.
Co-administration with pirfenidone
In a dedicated pharmacokinetic study, concomitant treatment of nintedanib with pirfenidone was 
investigated in patients with IPF. Based on these results, there is no evidence of a relevant 
pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between nintedanib and pirfenidone when administered in 
combination (see section 5.2). Given the similarity in safety profiles for both medicinal products, 
additive adverse reactions, including gastrointestinal and hepatic adverse events, may be expected. 
The benefit-risk balance of concomitant treatment with pirfenidone has not been established.
Effect on QT interval
No evidence of QT prolongation was observed for nintedanib in the clinical trial programme 
(Section 5.1). As some other tyrosine kinase inhibitors are known to exert an effect on QT, caution 
should be exercised when nintedanib is administered in patients who may develop QTc prolongation.
Allergic reaction
Dietary soya products are known to cause allergic reactions including severe anaphylaxis in persons 
with soya allergy. Patients with known allergy to peanut protein carry an enhanced risk for severe 
reactions to soya preparations.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
P-glycoprotein (P-gp)
Nintedanib is a substrate of P-gp (see section 5.2). Co-administration with the potent P-gp inhibitor 
ketoconazole increased exposure to nintedanib 1.61-fold based on AUC and 1.83-fold based on Cmax in 
a dedicated drug-drug interaction study. In a drug-drug interaction study with the potent P-gp inducer 
rifampicin, exposure to nintedanib decreased to 50.3% based on AUC and to 60.3% based on Cmax
upon co-administration with rifampicin compared to administration of nintedanib alone. If co-
administered with Ofev, potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, erythromycin or cyclosporine) may 
increase exposure to nintedanib. In such cases, patients should be monitored closely for tolerability of 
nintedanib. Management of adverse reactions may require interruption, dose reduction, or 
discontinuation of therapy with Ofev (see section 4.2).
6
Potent P-gp inducers (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John’s Wort) may decrease 
exposure to nintedanib. Selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal 
P-gp induction potential should be considered.
Cytochrome (CYP)-enzymes
Only a minor extent of the biotransformation of nintedanib consisted of CYP pathways. Nintedanib 
and its metabolites, the free acid moiety BIBF 1202 and its glucuronide BIBF 1202 glucuronide, did 
not inhibit or induce CYP enzymes in preclinical studies (see section 5.2). The likelihood of drug-drug 
interactions with nintedanib based on CYP metabolism is therefore considered to be low.
Co-administration with other medicinal products
Co-administration of nintedanib with oral hormonal contraceptives did not alter the pharmacokinetics 
of oral hormonal contraceptives to a relevant extent (see section 5.2).
Co-administration of nintedanib with bosentan did not alter the pharmacokinetics of nintedanib (see 
section 5.2).
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception
Nintedanib may cause foetal harm in humans (see section 5.3). Women of childbearing potential 
should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with Ofev and to use highly 
effective contraceptive methods at initiation of, during and at least 3 months after the last dose of 
Ofev. Nintedanib does not relevantly affect the plasma exposure of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel 
(see section 5.2). The efficacy of oral hormonal contraceptives may be compromised by vomiting 
and/or diarrhoea or other conditions where the absorption may be affected. Women taking oral 
hormonal contraceptives experiencing these conditions should be advised to use an alternative highly 
effective contraceptive measure.
Pregnancy
There is no information on the use of Ofev in pregnant women, but pre-clinical studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity of this active substance (see section 5.3). As nintedanib may cause foetal 
harm also in humans, it must not be used during pregnancy (see section 4.3) and pregnancy testing 
must be conducted prior to treatment with Ofev and during treatment as appropriate.
Female patients should be advised to notify their doctor or pharmacist if they become pregnant during 
therapy with Ofev.
If the patient becomes pregnant while receiving Ofev, treatment must be discontinued and she should 
be apprised of the potential hazard to the foetus.
Breast-feeding
There is no information on the excretion of nintedanib and its metabolites in human milk.
Pre-clinical studies showed that small amounts of nintedanib and its metabolites (≤ 0.5% of the 
administered dose) were secreted into milk of lactating rats. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be 
excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Ofev.
Fertility
Based on preclinical investigations there is no evidence for impairment of male fertility (see 
section 5.3). From subchronic and chronic toxicity studies, there is no evidence that female fertility in 
rats is impaired at a systemic exposure level comparable with that at the maximum recommended 
human dose (MRHD) of 150 mg twice daily (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Ofev has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised to be 
7
cautious when driving or using machines during treatment with Ofev.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
In clinical trials and during the post-marketing experience, the most frequently reported adverse
reactions associated with the use of nintedanib included diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal 
pain, decreased appetite, weight decreased and hepatic enzyme increased.
For the management of selected adverse reactions see section 4.4.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Diarrhoea
In clinical trials (see section 5.1), diarrhoea was the most frequent gastro-intestinal event reported. In 
most patients, the event was of mild to moderate intensity. More than two thirds of patients 
experiencing diarrhoea reported its first onset already during the first three months of treatment. In 
most patients, the events were managed by anti-diarrhoeal therapy, dose reduction or treatment 
interruption (see section 4.4). An overview of the reported diarrhoea events in the clinical trials is 
listed in Table 2:

Hepatic enzyme increased
In the INPULSIS trials, liver enzyme elevations (see section 4.4) were reported in 13.6% versus 2.6%
of patients treated with Ofev and placebo, respectively. In the INBUILD trial, liver enzyme elevations 
were reported in 22.6% versus 5.7% of patients treated with Ofev and placebo, respectively. In the 
SENSCIS trial, liver enzyme elevations were reported in 13.2% versus 3.1% of patients treated with 
Ofev and placebo, respectively. Elevations of liver enzymes were reversible and not associated with 
clinically manifest liver disease.
For further information about special populations, recommended measures and dosing adjustments in 
case of diarrhoea and hepatic enzyme increased, refer additionally to sections 4.4 and 4.2, 
respectively.
Bleeding
In clinical trials, the frequency of patients who experienced bleeding was slightly higher in patients 
9
treated with Ofev or comparable between the treatment arms (Ofev 10.3% versus placebo 7.8% for 
INPULSIS; Ofev 11.1% versus placebo 12.7% for INBUILD; Ofev 11.1% versus placebo 8.3% for 
SENSCIS). Non-serious epistaxis was the most frequent bleeding event reported. Serious bleeding 
events occurred with low frequencies in the 2 treatment groups (Ofev 1.3% versus placebo 1.4% for 
INPULSIS; Ofev 0.9% versus placebo 1.5% for INBUILD; Ofev 1.4% versus placebo 0.7% for 
SENSCIS).
Post-marketing bleeding events include but are not limited to gastrointestinal, respiratory and central 
nervous organ systems, with the most frequent being gastrointestinal (see section 4.4).
Proteinuria
In clinical trials, the frequency of patients who experienced proteinuria was low and comparable 
between the treatment arms (Ofev 0.8% versus placebo 0.5% for INPULSIS; Ofev 1.5% versus 
placebo 1.8% for INBUILD; Ofev 1.0% versus placebo 0.0% for SENSCIS). Nephrotic syndrome has 
not been reported in clinical trials. Very few cases of nephrotic range proteinuria with or without renal 
function impairment have been reported post-marketing. Histological findings in individual cases were 
consistent with glomerular microangiopathy with or without renal thrombi. Reversal of the symptoms 
has been observed after Ofev was discontinued, with residual proteinuria in some cases. Treatment 
interruption should be considered in patients who develop signs or symptoms of nephrotic syndrome 
(see section 4.4).
Paediatric population
There are limited safety data for nintedanib in pediatric patients.
A total of 39 patients aged 6 to 17 years were treated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial of 24 weeks duration, followed by open label treatment with nintedanib of variable 
duration (see section 5.1). Consistent with the safety profile seen in adult patients with IPF, other 
chronic fibrosing ILDs with progressive phenotype and SSc-ILD, the most frequently reported adverse 
reactions with nintedanib during placebo-controlled period were diarrhoea (38.5%), vomiting (26.9%), 
nausea (19.2%), abdominal pain (19.2%), and headache (11.5%). 
Hepatobiliary disorders reported with nintedanib during placebo-controlled period were liver injury 
(3.8 %) and increased liver function test (3.8 %). Due to limited data, it is uncertain if the risk for 
drug-induced liver injury is similar in children as compared to adults (see section 4.4).
Based on preclinical findings, bone, growth and teeth development were monitored as potential risks 
in the paediatric clinical trial (see section 5.3). The potential impact on growth and tooth development 
is unknown (see section 5.1).
Long term safety data in paediatric patients are not available. There are uncertainties on the potential 
impact on growth, tooth development, puberty, and the risk of liver injury.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9
Overdose
There is no specific antidote or treatment for Ofev overdose. Two patients in the oncology programme
had an overdose of maximum 600 mg twice daily up to eight days. Observed adverse reactions were 
consistent with the known safety profile of nintedanib, i.e. increased liver enzymes and gastrointestinal 
symptoms. Both patients recovered from these adverse reactions. In the INPULSIS trials, one patient 
was inadvertently exposed to a dose of 600 mg daily for a total of 21 days. A non-serious adverse 
event (nasopharyngitis) occurred and resolved during the period of incorrect dosing, with no onset of 
other reported events. In case of overdose, treatment should be interrupted and general supportive 
measures initiated as appropriate.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EX09
Mechanism of action
Nintedanib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor including the receptors platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (PDGFR) α and β, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1-3, and 
VEGFR 1-3. In addition, nintedanib inhibits Lck (lymphocyte-specific tyrosine-protein kinase), Lyn 
(tyrosine-protein kinase lyn), Src (proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase src), and CSF1R (colony 
stimulating factor 1 receptor) kinases. Nintedanib binds competitively to the adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP) binding pocket of these kinases and blocks the intracellular signalling cascades, which have 
been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of fibrotic tissue remodelling in interstitial lung 
diseases.
Pharmacodynamic effects
In in vitro studies using human cells nintedanib has been shown to inhibit processes assumed to be 
involved in the initiation of the fibrotic pathogenesis, the release of pro-fibrotic mediators from 
peripheral blood monocytic cells and macrophage polarisation to alternatively activated macrophages. 
Nintedanib has been demonstrated to inhibit fundamental processes in organ fibrosis, proliferation and 
migration of fibroblasts and transformation to the active myofibroblast phenotype and secretion of 
extracellular matrix. In animal studies in multiple models of IPF, SSc/SSc-ILD, rheumatoid arthritis-
associated-(RA-)ILD and other organ fibrosis, nintedanib has shown anti-inflammatory effects and 
anti-fibrotic effects in the lung, skin, heart, kidney, and liver. Nintedanib also exerted vascular activity. 
It reduced dermal microvascular endothelial cell apoptosis and attenuated pulmonary vascular 
remodelling by reducing the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, the thickness of pulmonary 
vessel walls and percentage of occluded pulmonary vessels.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)
The clinical efficacy of nintedanib has been studied in patients with IPF in two phase III, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with identical design (INPULSIS-1 (1 199.32) and 
INPULSIS-2 (1 199.34)). Patients with FVC baseline < 50% predicted or carbon monoxide diffusing 
capacity (DLCO, corrected for haemoglobin) < 30% predicted at baseline were excluded from the 
trials. Patients were randomized in a 3:2 ratio to treatment with Ofev 150 mg or placebo twice daily 
for 52 weeks.
The primary endpoint was the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC). The key 
secondary endpoints were change from baseline in Saint George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) 
total score at 52 weeks and time to first acute IPF exacerbation.
Annual rate of decline in FVC
The annual rate of decline of FVC (in mL) was significantly reduced in patients receiving nintedanib 
compared to patients receiving placebo. The treatment effect was consistent in both trials. See Table 3
for individual and pooled study results.

In a sensitivity analysis which assumed that in patients with missing data at week 52 the FVC decline 
after the last observed value would be the same as in all placebo patients, the adjusted difference in the 
annual rate of decline between nintedanib and placebo was 113.9 mL/year (95% CI 69.2, 158.5) in 
INPULSIS-1 and 83.3 mL/year (95% CI 37.6, 129.0) in INPULSIS-2.

FVC responder analysis
In both INPULSIS trials, the proportion of FVC responders, defined as patients with an absolute 
decline in FVC % predicted no greater than 5% (a threshold indicative of the increasing risk of 
mortality in IPF), was significantly higher in the nintedanib group as compared to placebo. Similar 
results were observed in analyses using a conservative threshold of 10%. See Table 4 for individual 
and pooled study results.

Time to progression (≥ 10% absolute decline of FVC % predicted or death)
In both INPULSIS trials, the risk of progression was statistically significantly reduced for patients 
treated with nintedanib compared with placebo. In the pooled analysis, the HR was 0.60 indicating a 
40% reduction in the risk of progression for patients treated with nintedanib compared with placebo.

Change from baseline in SGRQ total score at week 52
In the pooled analysis of the INPULSIS trials, the baseline SGRQ scores were 39.51 in the nintedanib 
group and 39.58 in the placebo group. The estimated mean change from baseline to week 52 in SGRQ 
total score was smaller in the nintedanib group (3.53) than in the placebo group (4.96), with a 
difference between the treatment groups of -1.43 (95% CI: -3.09, 0.23; p = 0.0923). Overall, the effect 
of nintedanib on health-related quality of life as measured by the SGRQ total score is modest, 
indicating less worsening compared to placebo.
Time to first acute IPF exacerbation
In the pooled analysis of the INPULSIS trials, a numerically lower risk of first acute exacerbation was 
observed in patients receiving nintedanib compared to placebo. See Table 6 for individual and pooled 
study results.

Survival analysis
In the pre-specified pooled analysis of survival data of the INPULSIS trials, overall mortality over 
52 weeks was lower in the nintedanib group (5.5%) compared with the placebo group (7.8%). The 
analysis of time to death resulted in a HR of 0.70 (95% CI 0.43, 1.12; p = 0.1399). The results of all 
survival endpoints (such as on-treatment mortality and respiratory mortality) showed a consistent 
numerical difference in favour of nintedanib.

Long-term treatment with Ofev in patients with IPF (INPULSIS-ON)
An open-label extension trial of Ofev included 734 patients with IPF. Patients who completed the 
52-week treatment period in an INPULSIS trial received open-label Ofev treatment in the extension 
trial INPULSIS-ON. Median exposure time for patients treated with Ofev in both the INPULSIS and 
INPULSIS-ON trials was 44.7 months (range 11.9-68.3). The exploratory efficacy endpoints included 
the annual rate of decline in FVC over 192 weeks which was -135.1 (5.8) mL/year in all patients 
treated and were consistent with the annual rate of FVC decline in patients treated with Ofev in the 
INPULSIS phase III trials (-113.6 mL per year). The adverse event profile of Ofev in INPULSIS-ON 
was consistent to that in the INPULSIS phase III trials.
IPF patients with advanced lung function impairment (INSTAGE)
INSTAGE was a multicentre, multinational, prospective, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group 
clinical trial in IPF patients with advanced lung function impairment (DLCO ≤ 35% predicted) for 
24 weeks. 136 patients were treated with Ofev monotherapy. Primary endpoint result showed a 
reduction of St Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score by -0.77 units at week W12, 
based on adjusted mean change from baseline. A post hoc comparison demonstrated that the decline in 
FVC in these patients was consistent with the decline in FVC in patients with less advanced disease 
and treated with Ofev in the INPULSIS phase III trials.
The safety and tolerability profile of Ofev in IPF patients with advanced lung function impairment was 
consistent with that seen in the INPULSIS phase III trials.
Additional data from the phase IV INJOURNEY trial with Ofev 150 mg twice daily and add-on 
pirfenidone
Concomitant treatment with nintedanib and pirfenidone has been investigated in an exploratory open-
label, randomised trial of nintedanib 150 mg twice daily with add-on pirfenidone (titrated to 801 mg 
three times a day) compared to nintedanib 150 mg twice daily alone in 105 randomised patients for 
12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with gastrointestinal adverse events 
from baseline to week 12. Gastrointestinal adverse events were frequent and in line with the 
established safety profile of each component. Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were the most frequent 
adverse events reported in patients, treated with pirfenidone added to nintedanib versus nintedanib 
alone, respectively.
15
Mean (SE) absolute changes from baseline in FVC at week 12 were -13.3 (17.4) mL in patients treated
with nintedanib with add-on pirfenidone (n = 48) compared to -40.9 (31.4) mL in patients treated with 
nintedanib alone (n = 44).
Other chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with a progressive phenotype
The clinical efficacy of Ofev has been studied in patients with other chronic fibrosing ILDs with a 
progressive phenotype in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase III trial (INBUILD). 
Patients with IPF were excluded. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of a chronic fibrosing ILD were 
selected if they had relevant fibrosis (greater than 10% fibrotic features) on HRCT and presented with 
clinical signs of progression (defined as FVC decline ≥ 10%, FVC decline ≥ 5% and < 10% with 
worsening symptoms or imaging, or worsening symptoms and worsening imaging all in the 24 months 
prior to screening). Patients were required to have an FVC greater than or equal to 45% of predicted 
and a DLCO 30% to less than 80% of predicted. Patients were required to have progressed despite 
management deemed appropriate in clinical practice for the patient’s relevant ILD.
A total of 663 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Ofev 150 mg bid or matching 
placebo for at least 52 weeks. The median Ofev exposure over the whole trial was 17.4 months and the 
mean Ofev exposure over the whole trial was 15.6 months. Randomisation was stratified based on 
HRCT fibrotic pattern as assessed by central readers. 412 patients with HRCT with usual interstitial 
pneumonia (UIP)-like fibrotic pattern and 251 patients with other HRCT fibrotic patterns were 
randomised. There were 2 co-primary populations defined for the analyses in this trial: all patients (the 
overall population) and patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern. Patients with other HRCT 
fibrotic patterns represented the ‘complementary’ population.
The primary endpoint was the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) (in mL) over 
52 weeks. Main secondary endpoints were absolute change from baseline in King’s Brief Interstitial 
Lung Disease Questionnaire (K-BILD) total score at week 52, time to first acute ILD exacerbation or 
death over 52 weeks, and time to death over 52 weeks.
Patients had a mean (standard deviation [SD, Min-Max]) age of 65.8 (9.8, 27-87) years and a mean 
FVC percent predicted of 69.0% (15.6, 42-137). The underlying clinical ILD diagnoses in groups 
represented in the trial were hypersensitivity pneumonitis (26.1%), autoimmune ILDs (25.6%), 
idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (18.9%), unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia 
(17.2%), and other ILDs (12.2%).
The INBUILD trial was not designed or powered to provide evidence for a benefit of nintedanib in 
specific diagnostic subgroups. Consistent effects were demonstrated in subgroups based on the ILD 
diagnoses. The experience with nintedanib in very rare progressive fibrosing ILDs is limited.
Annual rate of decline in FVC
The annual rate of decline in FVC (in mL) over 52 weeks was significantly reduced by 107.0 mL in 
patients receiving Ofev compared to patients receiving placebo (Table 8) corresponding to a relative 
treatment effect of 57.0%.

The results of the effect of Ofev in reducing the annual rate of decline in FVC were confirmed by all 
pre-specified sensitivity analyses and consistent results were observed in the pre-specified efficacy 
subgroups: gender, age group, race, predicted baseline FVC %, and original underlying clinical ILD 
diagnosis in groups.
Figure 3 shows the evolution of change in FVC from baseline over time in the treatment groups.

In addition, favourable effects of Ofev were observed on the adjusted mean absolute change from 
baseline in FVC % predicted at week 52. The adjusted mean absolute change from baseline to week 52 
in FVC % predicted was lower in the nintedanib group (-2.62%) than in the placebo group (-5.86%). 
The adjusted mean difference between the treatment groups was 3.24 (95% CI: 2.09, 4.40, nominal 
p< 0.0001).
FVC responder analysis
The proportion of FVC responders, defined as patients with a relative decline in FVC % predicted no 
greater than 5%, was higher in the Ofev group as compared to placebo. Similar results were observed 
in analyses using a threshold of 10% (Table 9).

receiving Ofev compared to placebo.
Time to progression (≥10% absolute decline of FVC % predicted) or death
In the INBUILD trial, the risk of progression (≥ 10% absolute decline of FVC % predicted) or death 
was reduced for patients treated with Ofev. The proportion of patients with an event was 40.4% in the 
Ofev group and 54.7% in the placebo group. The HR was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.83; p = 0.0003), 
indicating a 34% reduction of the risk of progression (≥ 10% absolute decline of FVC % predicted) 
or death in patients receiving Ofev compared to placebo.
Quality of life
The adjusted mean change from baseline in K-BILD total score at week 52 was -0.79 units in the 
placebo group and 0.55 in the Ofev group. The difference between the treatment groups was 1.34 
(95% CI: -0.31, 2.98; nominal p = 0.1115).
The adjusted mean absolute change from baseline in Living with Pulmonary Fibrosis (L-PF)
symptoms dyspnoea domain score at week 52 was 4.28 in the Ofev group compared with 7.81 in the 
placebo group. The adjusted mean difference between the groups in favour of Ofev was -3.53 (95% 
CI: -6.14, -0.92; nominal p = 0.0081). The adjusted mean absolute change from baseline in L-PF 
Symptoms cough domain score at week 52 was -1.84 in the Ofev group compared with 4.25 in the 
placebo group. The adjusted mean difference between the groups in favour of Ofev was -6.09 (95% 
CI: -9.65, -2.53; nominal p = 0.0008).

Systemic sclerosis associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD)
The clinical efficacy of Ofev has been studied in patients with SSc-ILD in a double-blind, randomised, 
placebo-controlled phase III trial (SENSCIS). Patients were diagnosed with SSc-ILD based upon the 
2013 American College of Rheumatology / European League Against Rheumatism classification 
criteria for SSc and a chest high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan conducted within the 
previous 12 months. A total of 580 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Ofev 
150 mg bid or matching placebo for at least 52 weeks, of which 576 patients were treated. 
Randomisation was stratified by antitopoisomerase antibody status (ATA). Individual patients stayed 
on blinded trial treatment for up to 100 weeks (median Ofev exposure 15.4 months; mean Ofev 
exposure 14.5 months).
The primary endpoint was the annual rate of decline in FVC over 52 weeks. Key secondary endpoints 
were absolute change from baseline in the modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) at week 52 and 
absolute change from baseline in the Saint George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at 
week 52.
In the overall population, 75.2% of the patients were female. The mean (standard deviation [SD, Min-
Max]) age was 54.0 (12.2, 20-79) years. Overall, 51.9% of patients had diffuse cutaneous systemic 
sclerosis (SSc) and 48.1% had limited cutaneous SSc. The mean (SD) time since first onset of a non-
Raynaud symptom was 3.49 (1.7) years. 49.0% of patients were on stable therapy with mycophenolate 
at baseline (46.5% mycophenolate mofetil, 1.9% mycophenolate sodium, 0.5% mycophenolic acid). 
The safety profile in patients with or without mycophenolate at baseline was comparable.
Annual rate of decline in FVC
The annual rate of decline of FVC (mL) over 52 weeks was significantly reduced by 41.0 mL in 
patients receiving Ofev compared to patients receiving placebo (Table 10) corresponding to a relative 
treatment effect of 43.8%.

1 Based on a random coefficient regression with fixed categorical effects of treatment, ATA status, gender, 
fixed continuous effects of time, baseline FVC [mL], age, height, and including treatment-by-time and 
baseline-by-time interactions. Random effect was included for patient specific intercept and time. Within-
patient errors were modelled by an unstructured variance-covariance matrix. Inter-individual variability was 
modelled by a variance-components variance-covariance matrix.
The effect of Ofev in reducing the annual rate of decline in FVC was similar across pre-specified 
sensitivity analyses and no heterogeneity was detected in pre-specified subgroups (e.g. by age, gender, 
and mycophenolate use).
In addition, similar effects were observed on other lung function endpoints, e.g absolute change from 
baseline in FVC in mL at week 52 (Figure 5 and Table 11) and rate of decline in FVC in % predicted 
over 52 weeks (Table 12) providing further substantiation of the effects of Ofev on slowing 
progression of SSc-ILD. Furthermore, fewer patients in the Ofev group had an absolute FVC decline 
> 5% predicted (20.6% in the Ofev group vs. 28.5% in the placebo group, OR = 0.65, p = 0.0287). The 
relative FVC decline in mL > 10% was comparable between both groups (16.7% in the Ofev group vs. 
18.1% in the placebo group, OR = 0.91, p = 0.6842). In these analyses, missing FVC values at 
week 52 were imputed with the patient’s worst value on treatment.

An exploratory analysis of data up to 100 weeks (maximum treatment duration in SENSCIS) 
suggested that the on treatment effect of Ofev on slowing progression of SSc-ILD persisted beyond 
52 weeks.

Change from baseline in Modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) at week 52
The adjusted mean absolute change from baseline in mRSS at week 52 was comparable between the 
Ofev group (-2.17 (95% CI -2.69, -1.65)) and the placebo group (-1.96 (95% CI -2.48, -1.45)). The 
adjusted mean difference between the treatment groups was -0.21 (95% CI -0.94, 0.53; p = 0.5785).
Change from baseline in St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at week 52
The adjusted mean absolute change from baseline in SGRQ total score at week 52 was comparable 
between the Ofev group (0.81 (95% CI -0.92, 2.55)) and the placebo group (-0.88 (95% CI -2.58, 
0.82)). The adjusted mean difference between the treatment groups was 1.69 (95% CI -0.73, 4.12; 
p = 0.1711).
Survival analysis
Mortality over the whole trial was comparable between the Ofev group (N = 10; 3.5%) and the 
placebo group (N = 9; 3.1%). The analysis of time to death over the whole trial resulted in a HR of 
1.16 (95% CI 0.47, 2.84; p = 0.7535).
QT interval
In a dedicated study in renal cell cancer patients, QT/QTc measurements were recorded and showed 
that a single oral dose of 200 mg nintedanib as well as multiple oral doses of 200 mg nintedanib 
administered twice daily for 15 days did not prolong the QTcF interval.
Paediatric population
Fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) in children and adolescents
The clinical safety and efficacy of Ofev in children and adolescents from 6 to 17 years with clinically 
significant fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) was assessed in an exploratory randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial (InPedILD 1199.337) (see section 4.2).
The InPedILD trial enrolled children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years with clinically significant 
fibrosing ILD and FVC of at least 25% predicted. Patients were classified as having fibrosing ILD 
based on evidence of fibrosis on two HRCT scans (with one HRCT scan conducted within the 
previous 12 months) or evidence of fibrosis on lung biopsy and one HRCT scan conducted within the 
previous 12 months.
Clinically significant disease was defined as a Fan score ≥3 or documented evidence of clinical 
progression over any time frame. Evidence of clinical progression was based on a relative decline in 
FVC ≥10% predicted, a relative decline in FVC of 5–10% predicted with worsening symptoms, 
worsening fibrosis on HRCT or other measures of clinical worsening attributed to progressive 
pulmonary fibrosis (e.g. increased oxygen requirement, decreased diffusion capacity) although this 
was not a requirement for enrolment for patients with a Fan score of  ≥3.
23
Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Ofev twice daily (doses adjusted for weight, 
including the use of a 25 mg capsule) or matching placebo for 24 weeks, followed by open label 
treatment with nintedanib of variable duration.The use of standard of care as deemed clinically 
indicated by the treating physician was allowed.
In total, 39 patients were randomised (61.5% female), (6-11 years: 12 patients, 12-17 years: 
27 patients). The mean [standard deviation (SD)] age was 12.6 (3.3) years.
Mean (SD) weight was 42.2 kg (17.8 kg); 6-11 years: 26.6 kg (10.4 kg), 12-17 years: 49.1 kg (16.0 kg). 
Trial 1199-0337 enrolled patients with a broad spectrum of diseases. The most frequent single 
underlying ILD diagnoses were ‘surfactant protein deficiency’ (nintedanib: 26.9%, placebo: 38.5%), 
‘systemic sclerosis’ (nintedanib: 15.4%, placebo: 23.1%), and ‘toxic/radiation/drug-induced 
pneumonitis’ (nintedanib: 11.5%, placebo 7.7%). Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis was reported 
for 2 patients (nintedanib: 7.7%). The remaining underlying ILD diagnoses reported for 1 patient each
were post-HSCT fibrosis, juvenile RA, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Dermatomyositis (DM), 
Desquammative Interstitial Pneumonitis, Influenza H1N1, Unclear (Chronic Diffuse Pulmonary Lung 
Disease), Copa Syndrome, Copa Gene Mutation, Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease, Post-
Infectious Bronchiolitis Obliterans, Unspecified ILD, Idiopathic and Sting-associated Vasculopathy.
All patients were reported with at least 1 concomitant therapy during the double-blind period. Use of 
concomitant therapies (baseline, on-treatment, and post-study drug discontinuation therapies) to treat 
the underlying disease including corticosteroids and immunomodulators was permitted.
The primary endpoints results were:

The exposure to nintedanib described as AUCτ,ss based on sampling at steady state was broadly 
similar in children and adolescents and comparable to the AUCτ,ss observed in adults (see 
section 5.2).
The percentage of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events at week 24 was 84.6% in the 
nintedanib group (6-11 years: 75.0%, 12-17 years: 88.9%) and 84.6% in the placebo group 
(6-11 years: 100%, 12-17 years: 77.8%). 

There was no primary efficacy endpoint in the study.
Secondary endpoint for lung function was the change in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) % predicted 
from baseline at week 24 and week 52. The adjusted mean change from baseline at week 24 in FVC % 
predicted was 0.31 (95% CI -2.36, 2.98) in the nintedanib group, and -0.89 (95% CI -4.61, 2.82) in the 
placebo group, with an adjusted mean (95% CI) difference in FVC % predicted of 1.21 (95% CI -3.40, 
5.81) in favour of nintedanib. At week 52, the adjusted mean of the difference in change from baseline 
in FVC % predicted between treatment groups was 1.77 (95% CI -4.70, 8.25).
For the FVC % predicted endpoint and a number of other exploratory efficacy endpoints, high 
variability in response to treatment with nintedanib was observed amongst paediatric patients.
Safety secondary endpoints included:

Percentage of patients with treatment-emergent pathological findings of epiphyseal growth 
plate, which was similar across the treatment groups at week 24 (7.7% in both treatment 
groups). Up to week 52, the percentage of patients with pathological findings was 
nintedanib/nintedanib: 11.5% and placebo/nintedanib: 15.4%.

Percentage of patients with treatment-emergent pathological findings on dental examination or 
imaging, which was 46.2% in the nintedanib group and 38.5% in the placebo group up to 
week 24. Up to week 52, the percentage of patients with pathological findings was 
nintedanib/nintedanib: 50.0% and placebo/nintedanib: 46.2%.

5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Nintedanib reached maximum plasma concentrations approximately 2-4 h after oral administration as 
soft gelatine capsule under fed conditions (range 0.5-8 h). The absolute bioavailability of a 100 mg 
dose was 4.69% (90% CI: 3.615-6.078) in healthy volunteers. Absorption and bioavailability are 
decreased by transporter effects and substantial first-pass metabolism. Nintedanib exposure increased 
dose-proportionally in the dose range of 50-450 mg once daily and 150-300 mg twice daily. Steady 
state plasma concentrations were achieved within one week of dosing at the latest.
After food intake, nintedanib exposure increased by approximately 20% compared to administration 
under fasted conditions (CI: 95.3-152.5%) and absorption was delayed (median tmax fasted: 2.00 h; fed: 
3.98 h).
In an in vitro study, mixing nintedanib capsules with a small amount of apple sauce or chocolate 
pudding for up to 15 minutes did not have any impact on the pharmaceutical quality. Swelling and 
deformation of the capsules due to the water uptake of the gelatin capsule shell was observed with 
longer exposure time to the soft food. Therefore, taking the capsules with soft food would not be 
expected to alter the clinical effect when taken immediately.
Distribution
Nintedanib follows at least bi-phasic disposition kinetics. After intravenous infusion, a high volume of 
distribution (Vss: 1 050 L, 45.0% gCV) was observed.
The in vitro protein binding of nintedanib in human plasma was high, with a bound fraction of 97.8%. 
Serum albumin is considered to be the major binding protein. Nintedanib is preferentially distributed 
in plasma with a blood to plasma ratio of 0.869.
Biotransformation
The prevalent metabolic reaction for nintedanib is hydrolytic cleavage by esterases resulting in the free 
acid moiety BIBF 1202. BIBF 1202 is subsequently glucuronidated by uridine 5’-diphospho-
glucuronosyltransferase enzymes (UGT) enzymes, namely UGT 1A1, UGT 1A7, UGT 1A8, and 
UGT 1A10 to BIBF 1202 glucuronide.
Only a minor extent of the biotransformation of nintedanib consisted of CYP pathways, with 
CYP 3A4 being the predominant enzyme involved. The major CYP-dependent metabolite could not be 
detected in plasma in the human ADME study. In vitro, CYP-dependent metabolism accounted for 
about 5% compared to about 25% ester cleavage. Nintedanib, BIBF 1202, and BIBF 1202 glucuronide 
did not inhibit or induce CYP enzymes in preclinical studies, either. Drug-drug interactions between 
nintedanib and CYP substrates, CYP inhibitors, or CYP inducers are therefore not expected.
Elimination
Total plasma clearance after intravenous infusion was high (CL: 1 390 mL/min, 28.8% gCV). Urinary 
excretion of the unchanged active substance within 48 h was about 0.05% of the dose (31.5% gCV) 
after oral and about 1.4% of the dose (24.2% gCV) after intravenous administration; the renal 
clearance was 20 mL/min (32.6% gCV). The major route of elimination of drug related radioactivity 
after oral administration of [14C] nintedanib was via faecal/biliary excretion (93.4% of dose, 
2.61% gCV). The contribution of renal excretion to the total clearance was low (0.649% of dose, 
26.3% gCV). The overall recovery was considered complete (above 90%) within 4 days after dosing. 
The terminal half-life of nintedanib was between 10 and 15 h (gCV % approximately 50%).
Linearity/non-linearity
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of nintedanib can be considered linear with respect to time (i.e. single-
dose data can be extrapolated to multiple-dose data). Accumulation upon multiple administrations was 
1.04-fold for Cmax and 1.38-fold for AUCτ. Nintedanib trough concentrations remained stable for more 
than one year.
25
Transport
Nintedanib is a substrate of P-gp. For the interaction potential of nintedanib with this transporter, see 
section 4.5. Nintedanib was shown to be not a substrate or inhibitor of OATP-1B1, OATP-1B3, 
OATP-2B1, OCT-2, or MRP-2 in vitro. Nintedanib was also not a substrate of BCRP. Only a weak 
inhibitory potential on OCT-1, BCRP, and P-gp was observed in vitro which is considered to be of 
low clinical relevance. The same applies for nintedanib being a substrate of OCT-1.
Population pharmocokinetic analysis in special populations
The PK properties of nintedanib were similar in healthy volunteers, patients with IPF, patients with 
other chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype, patients with SSc-ILD, and cancer 
patients. Based on results of a population PK (PopPK) analysis in patients with IPF and non small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) (N = 1 191) and descriptive investigations, exposure to nintedanib was not 
influenced by sex (body weight corrected), mild and moderate renal impairment (estimated by 
creatinine clearance), alcohol consumption, or P-gp genotype.
PopPK analyses indicated moderate effects on exposure to nintedanib depending on age, body weight, 
and race (see below). Based on the high inter-individual variability of exposure observed moderate 
effects are considered not clinically relevant (see section 4.4).
Age
Exposure to nintedanib increased linearly with age. AUCτ,ss decreased by 16% for a 45-year old patient 
and increased by 13% for a 76-year old patient relative to a patient with the median age of 62 years. 
The age range covered by the analysis was 29 to 85 years; approximately 5% of the population were 
older than 75 years. Based on a PopPK model, an increase in nintedanib exposure of approximately 
20-25% was observed in patients ≥ 75 years compared with patients under 65 years.
Paediatric population
Based on the analysis of pharmacokinetic data of study InPedILD (1199.337), oral administration of 
nintedanib according to the weight-based dosing algorithm resulted in exposure within the range 
observed in adult patients. The observed geometric mean AUCτ,ss (geometric coefficient of variation) 
exposures were 175 ng/mL·hr (85.1%) and 167 ng/mL·hr (83.6 %) in 10 patients aged 6 to 11 years 
old and 23 patients aged 12 to 17 years old, respectively.
Body weight
An inverse correlation between body weight and exposure to nintedanib was observed. AUCτ,ss
increased by 25% for a 50 kg patient (5th percentile) and decreased by 19% for a 100 kg patient 
(95th percentile) relative to a patient with the median weight of 71.5 kg.
Race
The population mean exposure to nintedanib was 33-50% higher in Chinese, Taiwanese, and Indian 
patients and 16% higher in Japanese patients while it was 16-22% lower in Koreans compared to 
Caucasians (body weight corrected). Data from Black individuals were very limited but in the same 
range as for Caucasians.
Hepatic impairment
In a dedicated single dose phase I study and compared to healthy subjects, exposure to nintedanib 
based on Cmax and AUC was 2.2-fold higher in volunteers with mild hepatic impairment 
(Child Pugh A; 90% CI 1.3-3.7 for Cmax and 1.2-3.8 for AUC, respectively). In volunteers with 
moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B), exposure was 7.6-fold higher based on Cmax (90% CI 
4.4-13.2) and 8.7-fold higher (90% CI 5.7-13.1) based on AUC, respectively, compared to healthy 
volunteers. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) have not been studied.
Concomitant treatment with pirfenidone
In a dedicated pharmacokinetic study, concomitant treatment of nintedanib with pirfenidone was 
investigated in patients with IPF. Group 1 received a single dose of 150 mg nintedanib before and after 
uptitration to 801 mg pirfenidone three times a day at steady state (N = 20 patients treated). Group 2 
received steady state treatment of 801 mg pirfenidone three times a day and had a PK profiling before 
and after at least 7 days of co-treatment with 150 mg nintedanib twice daily (N = 17 patients treated). 
26
In group 1, the adjusted geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval (CI)) were 93% (57% –
151%) and 96% (70% – 131%) for Cmax and AUC0-tz of nintedanib, respectively (n = 12 for 
intraindividual comparison). In group 2, the adjusted geometric mean ratios (90% CI)) were 97% 
(86% – 110%) and 95% (86% – 106%) for Cmax,ss and AUCτ,ss of pirfenidone, respectively (n = 12 for 
intraindividual comparison).
Based on these results, there is no evidence of a relevant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction 
between nintedanib and pirfenidone when administered in combination (see section 4.4).
Concomitant treatment with bosentan
In a dedicated pharmacokinetic study, concomitant treatment of Ofev with bosentan was investigated 
in healthy volunteers. Subjects received a single dose of 150 mg Ofev before and after multiple dosing 
of 125 mg bosentan twice daily at steady state. The adjusted geometric mean ratios (90% confidence 
interval (CI)) were 103% (86% – 124%) and 99% (91% – 107%) for Cmax and AUC0-tz of nintedanib, 
respectively (n = 13), indicating that co-administration of nintedanib with bosentan did not alter the 
pharmacokinetics of nintedanib.
Concomitant treatment with oral hormonal contraceptives
In a dedicated pharmacokinetic study, female patients with SSc-ILD received a single dose of a 
combination of 30 µg ethinylestradiol and 150 µg levonorgestrel before and after twice daily dosing of 
150 mg nintedanib for at least 10 days. The adjusted geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval 
(CI)) were 117% (108% – 127%; Cmax) and 101% (93% – 111%; AUC0-tz) for ethinylestradiol and 
101% (90% – 113%; Cmax) and 96% (91% – 102%; AUC0-tz) for levonorgestrel, respectively (n = 15), 
indicating that co-administration of nintedanib has no relevant effect on the plasma exposure of 
ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel.
Exposure-response relationship
Exposure-response analyses of patients with IPF and other chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive 
phenotype, indicated a weak relationship between nintedanib plasma exposure and ALT and/or AST 
elevations. Actual administered dose might be the better predictor for the risk of developing diarrhoea 
of any intensity, even if plasma exposure as risk determining factor could not be ruled out (see 
section 4.4).
5.3
Preclinical safety data
General toxicology
Single dose toxicity studies in rats and mice indicated a low acute toxic potential of nintedanib. In 
repeat dose toxicology studies in young rats, irreversible changes of enamel and dentin were observed 
in the continuously fast-growing incisors, but not in premolars or molars. In addition, thickening of 
epiphyseal growth plates during bone growth phases was observed and was reversible after 
discontinuation. These changes are known from other VEGFR-2 inhibitors and can be considered class 
effects.
Diarrhoea and vomiting accompanied by reduced food consumption and loss of body weight were 
observed in toxicity studies in non-rodents.
There was no evidence of liver enzyme increases in rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. Mild liver 
enzyme increases, which were not due to serious adverse effects such as diarrhoea were only observed 
in rhesus monkeys.
Reproduction toxicity
In rats, embryo-foetal lethality and teratogenic effects were observed at exposure levels below human 
exposure at the MRHD of 150 mg twice daily. Effects on the development of the axial skeleton and on 
the development of the great arteries were also noted at subtherapeutic exposure levels.
In rabbits, embryo-foetal lethality and teratogenic effects were observed at an exposure approximately 
3 times higher than at the MRHD but equivocal effects on the embryo-foetal development of the axial 
skeleton and the heart were noted already at an exposure below that at the MRHD of 150 mg twice 
27
daily.
In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, effects on pre- and post-natal development were 
seen at an exposure below the MRHD.
A study of male fertility and early embryonic development up to implantation in rats did not reveal 
effects on the male reproductive tract and male fertility.
In rats, small amounts of radiolabelled nintedanib and/or its metabolites were excreted into the milk 
(≤ 0.5% of the administered dose).
From the 2-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats, there was no evidence for a carcinogenic 
potential of nintedanib.
Genotoxicity studies indicated no mutagenic potential for nintedanib.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Ofev is and what it is used for
Ofev contains the active substance nintedanib, a medicine belonging to the class of so-called tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors, and it is used for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), other chronic 
fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with a progressive phenotype and systemic sclerosis 
associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) in adults.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)
IPF is a condition in which the tissue in your lungs becomes thickened, stiff and scarred over time. As 
a result, scarring reduces the ability to transfer oxygen from the lungs into the bloodstream and it 
becomes difficult to breathe deeply. Ofev helps to reduce further scarring and stiffening of the lungs.
Other chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with a progressive phenotype
Besides IPF, there are other conditions in which the tissue in your lungs becomes thickened, stiff, and 
scarred over time (lung fibrosis) and keeps worsening (progressive phenotype). Examples of these 
conditions are hypersensitivity pneumonitis, autoimmune ILDs (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis associated 
ILD), idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, 
and other ILDs. Ofev helps to reduce further scarring and stiffening of the lungs.
Systemic sclerosis associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD)
Systemic sclerosis (SSc), also known as scleroderma, is a rare chronic autoimmune disease that affects 
connective tissue in many parts of the body. SSc causes fibrosis (scarring and stiffening) of the skin 
and other internal organs such as the lungs. When the lungs are affected by fibrosis, it is called 
interstitial lung disease (ILD), and so the condition is called SSc-ILD. Fibrosis in the lungs reduces the 
ability to transfer oxygen into the bloodstream, and breathing capacity is reduced. Ofev helps to 
reduce further scarring and stiffening of the lungs.
2. What you need to know before you take Ofev
Do not take Ofev
-
-
if you are pregnant,
if you are allergic to nintedanib, peanut or soya, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
41
(listed in section 6).
-
-
-
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ofev,
if you have or have had liver problems,
-
if you have or have had problems with your kidneys, or if an increased amount of protein has 
-
been detected in your urine,
if you have or have had bleeding problems,
if you take blood-thinning medicines (such as warfarin, phenprocoumon or heparin) to prevent 
blood clotting,
if you take pirfenidone as this may increase the risk of having diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and 
liver problems,
if you have or have had problems with your heart (for example a heart attack),
if you have recently had surgery. Nintedanib may affect the way your wounds heal. Therefore,
your treatment with Ofev will usually be stopped for a while if you are having a surgery. Your 
doctor will decide when to resume your treatment with this medicine.
if you have high blood pressure,
if you have abnormally high blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs (pulmonary 
hypertension),
if you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a 
tear in a blood vessel wall.
-
-
-
-
-
Based on this information your doctor may do some blood tests, for example to check your liver 
function. Your doctor will discuss the results of these tests with you and decide whether you may 
receive Ofev.
Inform your doctor immediately while taking this medicine,
-
-
-
if you get diarrhoea. Treating diarrhoea early is important (see section 4);
if you vomit or feel sick (nausea);
if you have unexplained symptoms such as yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes 
(jaundice), dark or brown (tea coloured) urine, pain on the upper right side of your stomach area 
(abdomen), bleeding or bruising more easily than normal, or feeling tired. This could be 
symptoms of serious liver problems;
if you have severe pain in your stomach, fever, chills, sickness, vomiting, or abdominal rigidity 
or bloating, as these could be symptoms of a hole in the wall of your gut (‘gastrointestinal 
perforation’). Also, tell your doctor if you had peptic ulcers or diverticular disease in the past, or 
are concomitantly treated with anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (used to treat pain relief and 
swelling) or steroids (used for inflammation and allergies), as this may increase this risk;
if you have a combination of severe pain or cramping in your stomach, red blood in your stool 
or diarrhea as these could be symptoms of a bowel inflammation from inadequate blood supply;
if you have pain, swelling, reddening, warmth of a limb as this could be symptoms of a blood 
clot in one of your veins (a type of blood vessel);
if you have chest pressure or pain, typically on the left side of the body, pain in the neck, jaw, 
shoulder or arm, a fast heartbeat, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, as this could be 
symptoms of a heart attack;
if you have any major bleeding.
if you experience bruising, bleeding, fever, fatigue and confusion. This may be a sign of damage 
to blood vessels known as thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA).

Children and adolescents
Ofev should not be taken by children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Other medicines and Ofev
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including herbal medicines and medicines obtained without a prescription.
Ofev can interact with certain other medicines. The following medicines are examples that may 
42
increase the levels of nintedanib in your blood, and hence may increase the risk for side effects (see 
section 4):
-
-
-
a medicine used to treat fungal infections (ketoconazole)
a medicine used to treat bacterial infections (erythromycin)
a medicine that affects your immune system (cyclosporine)
The following medicines are examples that may lower the levels of nintedanib in your blood and thus 
may reduce the effectiveness of Ofev:
-
-
-
an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis (rifampicin)
medicines to treat seizures (carbamazepine, phenytoin)
a herbal medicine to treat depression (St. John’s Wort)
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Pregnancy
Do not take this medicine during pregnancy, as it can harm your unborn baby and cause birth defects.
You must have a pregnancy test done to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment with 
Ofev. Please talk to your doctor.
Contraception
-
Women who can become pregnant must use a highly effective method of birth control to 
prevent pregnancy when they start taking Ofev, while they are taking Ofev and for at least 
3 months after stopping treatment.
You should discuss the most appropriate methods of contraception for you with your doctor.
Vomiting and/or diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal conditions can affect the absorption of oral 
hormonal contraceptives, such as birth control pills, and may reduce their effectiveness.
Therefore, if experiencing these, talk to your doctor to discuss an alternative more appropriate 
method of contraception.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you become pregnant or think you may be 
pregnant during treatment with Ofev.
-
-
-
Breast-feeding
Do not breast-feed during the treatment with Ofev since there may be a risk of harm to the breast-fed 
child.
Driving and using machines
Ofev may have minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. You should not drive or use 
machines if you feel sick.
Ofev contains soya lecithin
If you are allergic to soya or peanut, do not take this medicine (see section 2).
3.
How to take Ofev
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Take the capsules twice daily approximately 12 hours apart at about the same time every day, for 
example one capsule in the morning and one capsule in the evening. This ensures that a steady amount 
of nintedanib is maintained in your blood stream. Swallow the whole capsules with water and do not 
chew the capsules. It is recommended that you take the capsules with food, i.e. during or immediately 
before or after a meal. Do not open or crush the capsule (see section 5).
43
Adults
The recommended dose is one capsule of 100 mg twice daily (a total of 200 mg per day).
Do not take more than the recommended dose of two Ofev 100 mg capsules per day.
If you do not tolerate the recommended dose of two Ofev 100 mg capsules per day (see possible side 
effects in section 4) your doctor may advise you to stop taking this medicine. Do not reduce the dose 
or stop the treatment by yourself without consulting your doctor first.
If you take more Ofev than you should
Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.
If you forget to take Ofev
Do not take two capsules together if you have forgotten to take your earlier dose. You should take 
your next dose of Ofev as planned at the next scheduled time recommended by your doctor or 
pharmacist.
If you stop taking Ofev
Do not stop taking Ofev without consulting your doctor first. It is important to take this medicine 
every day, as long as your doctor prescribes it for you.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

-
-
-
a medicine used to treat fungal infections (ketoconazole)
a medicine used to treat bacterial infections (erythromycin)
a medicine that affects your immune system (cyclosporine)
The following medicines are examples that may lower the levels of nintedanib in your blood and thus 
may reduce the effectiveness of Ofev:
-
-
-
an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis (rifampicin)
medicines to treat seizures (carbamazepine, phenytoin)
a herbal medicine to treat depression (St. John’s Wort)
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Pregnancy
Do not take this medicine during pregnancy, as it can harm your unborn baby and cause birth defects.
You must have a pregnancy test done to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment with 
Ofev. Please talk to your doctor.
Contraception
-
Women who can become pregnant must use a highly effective method of birth control to 
prevent pregnancy when they start taking Ofev while they are taking Ofev and for at least 
3 months after stopping treatment.
You should discuss the most appropriate methods of contraception for you with your doctor.
Vomiting and/or diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal conditions can affect the absorption of oral 
hormonal contraceptives, such as birth control pills, and may reduce their effectiveness.
Therefore, if experiencing these, talk to your doctor to discuss an alternative more appropriate 
method of contraception.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you become pregnant or think you may be 
pregnant during treatment with Ofev.
-
-
-
Breast-feeding
Do not breast-feed during the treatment with Ofev since there may be a risk of harm to the breast-fed 
child.
Driving and using machines
Ofev may have minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. You should not drive or use 
machines if you feel sick.
Ofev contains soya lecithin
If you are allergic to soya or peanut, do not take this medicine (see section 2).
3.
How to take Ofev
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Take the capsules twice daily approximately 12 hours apart at about the same time every day, for 
example one capsule in the morning and one capsule in the evening. This ensures that a steady amount 
of nintedanib is maintained in your blood stream. Swallow the whole capsules with water and do not 
chew the capsules. It is recommended that you take the capsules with food, i.e. during or immediately 
before or after a meal. Do not open or crush the capsule (see section 5).
52
Adults
The recommended dose is one capsule of 150 mg twice daily (a total of 300 mg per day).
Do not take more than the recommended dose of two Ofev 150 mg capsules per day.
If you do not tolerate the recommended dose of two Ofev 150 mg capsules per day (see possible side 
effects in section 4) your doctor may reduce the daily dose of Ofev. Do not reduce the dose or stop the 
treatment by yourself without consulting your doctor first.
Your doctor may reduce your recommended dose to two times 100 mg per day (a total of 200 mg per 
day). In this case your doctor will prescribe Ofev 100 mg capsules for your treatment. Do not take 
more than the recommended dose of two Ofev 100 mg capsules per day if your daily dose was reduced 
to 200 mg per day.
If you take more Ofev than you should
Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.
If you forget to take Ofev
Do not take two capsules together if you have forgotten to take your earlier dose. You should take 
your next dose of Ofev as planned at the next scheduled time recommended by your doctor or 
pharmacist.
If you stop taking Ofev
Do not stop taking Ofev without consulting your doctor first. It is important to take this medicine 
every day, as long as your doctor prescribes it for you.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

1.  Introduction 
On 23 July 2015, the MAH submitted the final clinical study report of paediatric study A3L33 for 
Hexaxim/ Hexacima/ Hexyon, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as 
amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study revealed no new information regarding 
seroconversion/vaccine response or the safety profile of Hexaxim™/Hexacima™/Hexyon™ that is not 
yet already included in the CCDS. Therefore, no modification is foreseen for CCDS or other related 
documents, including the SmPC or Package leaflet. 
To simplify matters, this report mentions just Hexaxim as study vaccine. However, the information 
equally applies to Hexacima and Hexyon. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that A3L33 is a standalone study. 
Study A3L33 was designed as a phase 3, open-label, multicentre study to assess the immunogenicity 
and safety of Hexaxim given at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age in infants for the purpose of marketing 
authorization application in India. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The commercially available formulation of Hexaxim was used. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Hexaxim™/Hexacima™/Hexyon™ is indicated for active immunisation (primary and booster 
vaccination) of infants and toddlers from six weeks to 24 months of age against diphtheria (D), tetanus 
(T), pertussis, HepB, poliomyelitis and invasive diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b 
(Hib). 
The MAH submitted the final report for: 
A3L33: ‘Immunogenicity and Safety of Sanofi Pasteur’s DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T Combined 
Vaccine Given at 6, 10 and 14 Weeks of Age in Infants from India Who Previously Received 
a Dose of Hepatitis B Vaccine at Birth.’ 
Note: The infants primed with the study vaccine were to be administered a booster dose during their 
second year of life (at 15-18 months of age) using any commercially available standalone or combined 
DTaP-polio-Hib vaccine(s). The booster vaccination was not given as part of this study.

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
This open-label multicenter study was designed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of Hexaxim 
given at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age in infants in order to meet the regulatory requirements of Drug 
Controller General, India, for registration of Hexaxim in India. 
Methods 
Objectives 
a) Immunogenicity: 
•  Primary - To evaluate the immunogenicity of the study vaccine in terms of seroprotection (D, T, 
poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3, Hib polysaccharide [PRP], Hep B antigens) and vaccine response for 
pertussis antigens (PT and FHA) 1 month after the third dose. 
•  Secondary - To further describe the immunogenicity of the study vaccine, before the 1st dose and 1 
month after the 3rd dose. 
b) Safety:  
•  Secondary only - To describe the safety after each and any dose of the study vaccine. 
Study design 
The study was a phase III, open-label study implemented in 2 centres in India. 
Trial period: 19 Feb 2014 (FVFS) to 14 Oct 2014 (LVLS). 
177 infants aged 6 weeks (up to 8 weeks) were enrolled. The subjects had received a documented dose 
of any commercially available oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and recombinant Hep B monovalent vaccine 
at birth according to the National Immunization Program (NIP) in India. 
Infants were to receive Sanofi Pasteur’s DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T combined vaccine (study vaccine, 
Hexaxim) at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age. 
There were 4 visits (V) scheduled with vaccinations on Day (D) 0 (=V01), D30 (=V02) and D60 
(=V03), and blood samplings on D0 and D90 (=V04; i.e., 30 days [up to 42 days] after the third 
vaccination). 
Parents/legally acceptable representatives were to record information about solicited reactions and 
unsolicited AEs in a DC after each vaccination, from D0 to D7 for solicited reactions and from D0 to D30 
for non-serious unsolicited AEs. SAEs were collected throughout the study. 
The expected participation of each subject in the study was approximately 3 months.

Concomitant Vaccination(s): 
If the subject’s parents/legally acceptable representatives agreed and the Investigator/family doctor 
deemed it necessary, other vaccines licensed in India might have been given during the study, except 
those containing the same antigens as the study vaccine. However, concomitant vaccines were not to 
be administered within the period from 8 days before to 8 days after each study vaccine 
administration. 
According to the immunization program in India, OPV is given at birth and later in infants and children 
during the National Immunization Days (NIDs). This implied that subjects could have received OPV 
during the course of the study while they already received IPV from the study vaccine. Subjects who 
received OPV during the study should receive subsequent study vaccine injections as scheduled.  
However, no NIDs have been conducted during the course of the study; thus, not any subject received 
OPV as part of an NID. 
Study population/ sample size 
Infants,  
•  aged between 42-56 days (6 to 8 weeks), born at full term (≥ 37 gestational weeks) and with a 
birth weight ≥ 2.5 kg,  
•  born to known HBsAg seronegative mother (with documented laboratory result during last trimester 
of pregnancy), 
•  who had received 1 documented dose of Hep B vaccine and OPV at birth as per national 
recommendations  
were included. 
Usual exclusion criteria were applied, e.g., receipt of any vaccine (except BCG) in the 4 weeks before 
1st study vaccination or planned vaccination from 8 days before to 8 days after each study vaccination, 
previous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, Hep B, and/ or Hib (except 
Hep B and OPV at birth).  
The number of subjects was designed to provide supportive immunogenicity and safety data of the 
study vaccine when administered as a primary vaccination in infants with previous hepatitis B and OPV 
vaccination at birth.  
The sample size was arbitrarily chosen to 150 evaluable subjects. Assuming an attrition rate of 
approximately 15%, a total of 177 subjects were to be included in the study. 
Assuming seroprotection/seroconversion rates of 94% or more for each vaccine antigen, a sample size 
of 150 evaluable subjects ensured a 95% confidence interval with a range of no more than 8.3% 
(using the exact binomial method) for all antibody responses. 
In terms of safety, the planned sample size of 150 evaluable subjects allowed, with 95% probability, 
the observation of any given AE occurring with a true frequency of 2% or more, using the rule of 
threes.

c)  Safety (secondary):  
•  Occurrence of any unsolicited systemic adverse events (AEs) reported in the 30 minutes after each 
and any vaccination(s) (=immediate post-vaccination surveillance period) 
•  Occurrence of solicited (prelisted in the subject’s diary card [DC] and electronic Case Report Form 
[CRF]) injection site and systemic reactions occurring through 7 days following each and any 
vaccination 
•  Occurrence of unsolicited AEs through 30 days following each and any vaccination 
•  Occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs) throughout the trial (V01 to V04) 
The definitions of AEs and SAEs, of adverse reactions (AR) and unexpected adverse reactions (UAR) 
and of solicited and unsolicited AEs /ARs were according to ICH E2A and cover essential time periods. 
For convenience and comparability, digital thermometers and flexible rulers were handed out along 
with the Diary Cards. The preferred route for temperature measurement was axillary (at least once per 
day, preferred in the evening time). 
The following Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) were considered by the Sponsor to be 
relevant for the monitoring of the safety profile of Hexaxim: Extensive limb swelling (ELS), hypotonic 
hyporesponsive episodes (HHE) and convulsions (whether febrile or not), anaphylactic reactions, 
apnea, severe neurological conditions (all defined as important identified or potential risks), in addition 
to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), sudden unexpected death (SUD) (defined as other AESIs) 
and apparent life-threatening events (ALTEs).  
Convulsions, HHE, anaphylactic reactions, severe neurological conditions, ALTEs and fatal outcomes 
were by definition to be considered as SAEs. 
Assays 
All immunological analyses were performed at the Sponsor’s Global Clinical Immunology (GCI) 
laboratory (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania, USA).

CHMP comment: 
Established correlates or accepted surrogates of protection were applied to calculate seroprotection 
rates (D, T, IPV, Hep B, PRP) and vaccine response rates (PT, FHA). The serological assays were the 
same as those used in previous studies with Hexaxim/ Hexacima/ Hexyon. 
Furthermore, the safety observations were in accordance to those applied to previous vaccine studies 
conducted in the EU. 
Statistical Methods 
All analyses were descriptive; no hypotheses were tested. 
Primary endpoints were described with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the exact binomial method 
(Clopper-Pearson method) for single proportions. 
Secondary endpoints were described with 95% CI 
• Using the exact binomial method (Clopper-Pearson method) for single proportions and 
• Using the normal approximation of the Log10 concentrations/titers, followed by a back transformation 
for geometric mean concentrations (GMCs)/ geometric mean titers (GMTs). 
The immunogenicity analyses were performed on the Per-Protocol (PP) analysis set and on the full 
analysis set (FAS). The latter comprised the PP analysis set plus subjects representing with at least 
one relevant protocol deviation, e.g., incomplete vaccination schedule or vaccination outside the 
protocol-specified time window, missing blood sample. Thus, all subjects who had received at least one 
vaccine dose were included in the FAS.  
Immunogenicity criteria were described for all valid serological results from sera obtained before the 
1st dose and 1 month after the 3rd dose. Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves (RCDCs) were 
constructed for all antigens. 
Safety was described for all subjects, after each and any vaccine dose (percentage of subjects with a 
given symptom plus 95% CI). The safety analyses were performed on the safety analysis set (SafAS) 
which was defined for each dose. 
Protocol amendments:  none 
Results 
Recruitment / Number analysed 
All subjects (177 infants) planned to be included were vaccinated at V01. Blood samples were taken 
from each of these subjects at V01.  
Out of the 177 subjects included in the FAS, 156 subjects were included in the PP analysis set. Among 
the 21 subjects excluded from the PP analysis set (Table 4),  
•  13 subjects did not provide the 2nd blood sample or did not provide it in the proper time window,  
•  6 subjects did not receive a vaccine dose in the proper time window,  
•  5 subjects (2.8%) did not complete the vaccination schedule and  
for 4 subjects (2.3%), the administration of vaccine was not done as per protocol. In the source 
• 
protocol this deviation was described as:

‘The subject received a vaccine unacceptable for use.’/ ‘The subject received a dose which had a CCB. 
The subject should be excluded from the per-protocol set […]’ (Appendix 16.2, A3L33) 
CHMP comment: 
The sponsor is asked to explain the abbreviated term ‘CCB’ (not included in list of abbreviations). 
Furthermore, it should be clarified whether this vaccine administration might represent a wrong 
medication/ vaccination. In this case, there would be a discrepancy between CSR data (no subject with 
‘prohibited therapy/ medication/ vaccine’) and Appendix 16.2 (4 subjects ‘received a vaccine 
unacceptable for use’).  
Out of the 177 subjects present at V01, 168 subjects (94.9%) completed the study. Among the 
9 subjects with early termination, 7 subjects were lost to follow-up and 2 subjects discontinued due to 
an SAE: 
•  One subject (003-00072) experienced bronchopneumonia that appeared after the second injection. 
The event lasted 23 days and was considered by the Investigator as not related to vaccination. The 
subject recovered but the Investigator decided to withdraw the subject from the study for safety 
concern. 
•  One subject (003-00087) died after the second injection. The death was considered by the 
Investigator as not related to the vaccination. 
Detailed information on SAEs is presented in the Safety section below.

Demography 
Among the subjects with data in their CRF, there were 99 males (55.9%) and 78 females (44.1%). The 
male/female ratio was 1.27. The mean age of the subjects at enrollment was 6.9 weeks (SD 0.6), with 
an age range between 6.1 and 8.1 weeks. The mean weight of the subjects was 4.6 kg (SD 0.6), with 
a weight range between 2.5 and 6.4 kg. 
Baseline demographics were the same in the FAS and SafAS, however, they were somewhat different 
for the PP analysis set which showed a further increased sex ratio of 1.36 (see CSR table 9.15). 
No data were presented with regard to ethnic origin of the subjects.  
Immunogenicity Results 
One month after the 3rd dose of Hexaxim, at least 99% of subjects met the (short-term) seroprotection 
thresholds defined for the various vaccine antigens and at least 93% met the vaccine response criteria 
for pertussis (at least 4 x LLOQ = 8 EU/mL and minimum baseline; Table 6).

Regarding diphtheria, following the 3rd Hexaxim dose 99% of subjects showed short-term protection 
levels of ≥ 0.01 IU/mL. About 50 % reached or exceeded the long-term protection level of 0.1 IU/mL 
(Table 7).  
All subjects reached anti-tetanus Ab concentrations of at least 0.1 IU/mL indicating long-term 
protection. Regarding pertussis, 93% of subjects showed a vaccine response (≥ 8 EU/mL but minimum 
baseline) regarding anti-PT Ab levels and 99% regarding anti-FHA Ab levels. 88 and 90% of subjects, 
respectively, showed a 4-fold increase in anti-PT and anti-FHA Ab concentrations relative to baseline at 
1 month-post dose 3. All subjects reached anti-PRP levels of ≥ 0.15 µg/mL indicating short-term 
protection and approximately 94% reached the long-term threshold of ≥ 1 µg/mL.  
All subjects reached protective Ab titers against polio type 1, 2, and 3 of ≥ 8 (1/dil). Further, all 
subjects showed seroprotection against Hep B with Ab levels of ≥ 10 mIU/mL, and even 99% reached

the more conservative anti-Hep B threshold of ≥ 100 mIU/mL following the 3-dose primary vaccination 
with Hexaxim.  
Relative to baseline, the 3-dose primary vaccination with Hexaxim resulted in a 5.9-fold increase in 
anti-D Ab levels. Anti-PT levels increased 51-fold and anti-FHA levels 37-fold. Furthermore, a 686-fold 
increase in anti-Hep B levels from baseline to post-dose 3 was observed.  
Very similar results were observed for the FAS (data not presented here). 
In summary, following vaccination of infants with 3 doses of Hexaxim given at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of 
age high and satisfactory seroprotection and vaccine response rates, respectively, were achieved.  
CHMP comment: 
The Ab levels generally were in the range or even higher than those found in previous studies with 
Hexaxim, except for PT. Vaccine response rates for PT were lower in the current study (93.8%) 
compared to those in previous studies as summarised in the SmPC (99-100% for both the 2-dose and 
3-dose vaccination schemes). Since the reverse cumulative distribution curve (RCDC) for PT and Table 
9.22 of A3L33 CSR show Ab levels of at least 25 EU/mL for all subjects (i.e. 100% with ≥ 8 EU/mL = 
4xLLOQ) the observed vaccine response rate for PT would indicate that >6% of subjects showed 
protective levels at baseline (i.e., ≥ 4 x LLOQ / ≥8 EU/mL) combined with an (unexpected) decrease in 
Ab levels from baseline to post-dose 3.   
The applicant is asked to provide data (PT and FHA) on subsets of subjects experiencing a decrease in 
aP Ab levels during the course of the study.  
Following the 3-dose primary immunization, almost all subjects showed short-term seroprotection 
against diphtheria (≥ 0.01 IU/mL), and all subjects showed long-term seroprotection against tetanus 
(≥ 0.1 IU/mL) and against polio type 1, 2, and 3 (≥ 8 [1/dil]). 
Seroprotection rates against Hep B and polio are higher than those of previous studies with Hexaxim. 
This could be expected as a consequence of the additional Hep B and OPV vaccine doses at birth. The 
SmPC already mention the higher Hep B seroprotection rates in infants who had received a Hep B dose 
at birth. 
Finally, all subjects showed protection against Hib (PRP) at the short-term threshold of 0.15 µg/mL and 
even 94% were long-term protected at ≥ 1 µg/mL.

Safety Results (Secondary Objective) 
None of the subjects experienced any immediate unsolicited AE in the 30 min after any vaccine 
injection. 
Within 7 days after any vaccine injection, 37.9% of subjects experienced at least one solicited injection 
site reaction. Grade 3 solicited injection site reactions were reported for 2.9% of subjects. The most 
frequently reported injection site reaction was tenderness (30.5% of subjects) 
Within 7 days after any vaccine injection, 54.6% of subjects experienced at least 1 solicited systemic 
reaction. Grade 3 solicited systemic reactions were reported for 2.3% of subjects. The most frequently 
reported systemic reaction was irritability (36.2% of subjects), followed by abnormal crying (24% of 
subjects). Fever was reported for 19.0% of subjects. No Grade 3 fever (>39.5°C) was reported. 
The incidences of solicited reactions and Grade 3 solicited reactions decreased with successive doses. 
After the third vaccine injection no Grade 3 solicited reaction was reported. 
Within 30 days after any vaccine injection, 60 unsolicited AEs were reported for 20.3% of subjects. The 
most frequently reported AE preferred term (PT) was upper respiratory tract infection (24 AEs reported 
for 11.9% of subjects). 
A total of 4 SAEs (including 1 death and 1 case of infantile epilepsy) were reported from 3 subjects 
during the trial. None of these SAEs were considered by the Investigator to be related to the study 
vaccine (see below). 
A total of 2 subjects (1.1%) experienced an SAE leading to discontinuation of the study 
(bronchopneumonia and death). None of them were considered by the Investigator to be related to the 
study vaccine. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were reported for 1 subject who experienced several 
episodes of convulsion. The time to onset of the convulsion episodes (25-26 days) was not suggestive 
of a relationship with the study vaccine. The Investigator and the Sponsor assessed this event as not 
related to study vaccine or study procedure. 
In summary, Hexaxim was well tolerated in infants who had received a first dose of Hep B and oral 
poliovirus vaccines at birth. 
CHMP comment: 
Overall, the incidences of various solicited systemic reactions were in the range of those mentioned in 
the SmPC, except for the AR ‘crying abnormal’ with a higher frequency (24% of subjects vs. <10% in 
the SmPC) and erythema with a lower frequency (8% vs. >10% in SmPC). Since the incidences 
reported in the SmPC result from a pooled analysis from several trials, these differences are considered 
normal inter-trial variations.  
In conclusion, Hexaxim was well tolerated by study subjects. Study data fit to the safety profile of 
Hexaxim as summarized in the SmPC.

Shortened narratives regarding SAEs and AESIs: 
(1) Subject 003-00087, female; severe sepsis with hypovolemic shock accompanied with viral lower 
respiratory tract infection (LRTI) at 2 MoA and death at 3 MoA: 
Hospitalization (paediatric ICU) at 26 days-post 1st dose because of lethargy, dehydration, deep and 
rapid breathing, tachycardia. Subject was diagnosed severe sepsis with hypovolemic shock and viral 
LRTI. The infant fully recovered upon treatment and was discharged after 11 d. The subject continued 
in the trial. A social worker confirmed the subject’s good condition 8 d after 2nd vaccination.  
At 27 d post-2nd dose the subject experienced hiccough during spoon top milk feeding and then did not 
respond. A physician confirmed the subject’s death. No autopsy was performed.  
(2) Subject 003-00072, male, bronchopneumonia at 3 MoA: 
The subject developed mild fever, cough and coryza 22 d after the 2nd vaccination. The subject was 
admitted to hospital (first paediatric ward, then paediatric ICU) and diagnosed respiratory distress and 
bronchopneumonia. The subject finally recovered after prolonged antibiotics therapy and was 
discharged after 25 days of inpatient hospitalisation. The subject was discontinued from the trial due to 
safety concern.  
Subject 003-00081, female, infantile epilepsy at 4 MoA: 
26 days after 3rd vaccine dose the subject with a family history of convulsions experienced a total of 3 
epileptic episodes both lasting a few minutes. She was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of 
infantile epilepsy. She recovered upon antiepileptics therapy, no further episodes of seizure were 
noted. She was discharged 6 d after admission and continued in the trial. 
CHMP comment: 
Because of the long delay (≥ 3 weeks) between vaccination and disease onset, the CHMP agrees that 
there is no causal relationship between the SAEs of sepsis or bronchopneumonia, respectively, and the 
study vaccine.  
The sudden death of one subject is still unclear since no autopsy was performed but might result from 
suffocation in consequence of swallowing up food. - No relationship to vaccination is being seen. 
Further, there is no indication that the AESI/ SAE of afebrile seizures in one subject might be related to 
vaccination since the subject had a family history of convulsions and because of the 1 month-gap 
between last vaccine dose and disease onset.  
In summary, the CHMP concurs with the judgement of the Investigator(s) that the observed SAEs / 
AESIs were not related to study vaccination.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Hexaxim was highly immunogenic in infants who received a 3-dose primary vaccination at 6, 10, and 
14 weeks of age and who had obtained a first dose of recombinant Hep B and oral poliovirus vaccines 
at birth. One month after the 3rd Hexaxim dose, most of the subjects reached the pre-defined short-
term seroprotective Ab levels against D, T, poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3, PRP and HepB. At least 94% of 
the subjects even reached long-term seroprotection levels against these vaccine antigens except for 
diphtheria (50% protected at > 1.0 IU/mL). 
At least 94% of the subjects showed a vaccine response to PT and FHA antigens 1 month after the 3rd 
dose.  
The immunogenicity results were consistent with those obtained in previous trials with Hexaxim/ 
Hexacima/ Hexyon. 
Hexaxim was well tolerated in infants. No new safety signals emerged. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Following vaccination with 3 doses of Hexaxim given at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age, high and 
satisfactory seroprotection/seroconversion and vaccine response rates, respectively, were achieved in 
Indian infants who previously had received a recombinant monovalent Hep B and an OPV vaccine dose 
at birth.  
At one month post-dose 3 all subjects were seroprotected against T, poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, 
Hep B, and PRP antigens at the pre-defined short-term thresholds. 99% of subjects (all but 1) were 
protected against diphtheria at 0.01 IU/mL. At least 94% of subjects were even protected against T, 
Hep B and PRP at long-term protection levels. Additionally, 94% and 99% of subjects showed an anti-
PT and anti-FHA vaccine response, respectively. Overall, the results were consistent with what has 
been observed outside India.  
However, the results obtained for PT vaccine response were somewhat lower compared to those in 
previous studies. These were related to the relatively high Ab levels at pre-vaccination time point that 
resulted from passively transmitted maternal Abs and declined over time. Since satisfactory anti-PT Ab 
levels were achieved at post-primary dose 3, this (lower) anti-PT vaccine response does not provide 
any concern.  
The study vaccine was well tolerated, no new safety signals have arisen. The SAEs and AESIs seen 
were all unrelated to study vaccination.  
There is no need to update the product information including SmPC and PiL.

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide description of the additional clarifications 
requested as part of this procedure (see section below). 
4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
•  The sponsor is asked to explain the abbreviated term ‘CCB’ (not included in list of abbreviations).  
Furthermore, it should be clarified whether the wrong vaccine administration (‘the administration of 
vaccine was not done as per protocol) might represent a wrong medication/ vaccination.  
In this case, there would be a discrepancy between CSR data (no subject with ‘prohibited therapy/ 
medication/ vaccine’) and Appendix 16.2 (4 subjects ‘received a vaccine unacceptable for use’). 
•  Vaccine response rates for PT were lower in the current study (93.8%) compared to those in 
previous studies as summarised in the SmPC (99-100% for both the 2-dose and 3-dose vaccination 
schemes). Since the reverse cumulative distribution curve (RCDC) for PT and Table 9.22 of A3L33 CSR 
show Ab levels of at least 25 EU/mL for all subjects (i.e. 100% with ≥8 EU/mL = 4xLLOQ) the 
observed vaccine response rate for PT would indicate that >6% of subjects showed protective levels at 
baseline (i.e., ≥ 4 x LLOQ / ≥8 EU/mL) combined with an (unexpected) decrease in Ab levels from 
baseline to post-dose 3.   
The applicant is asked to provide data (PT and FHA) on subsets of subjects experiencing a decrease in 
aP Ab levels during the course of the study. 
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable without clock stop.

5.  MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Question 1 
The sponsor is asked to explain the abbreviated term ‘CCB’ (not included in list of abbreviations). 
Furthermore, it should be clarified whether the wrong vaccine administration (‘the administration of 
vaccine was not done as per protocol) might represent a wrong medication/ vaccination. 
In this case, there would be a discrepancy between CSR data (no subject with ‘prohibited therapy/ 
medication/ vaccine’) and Appendix 16.2 (4 subjects ‘received a vaccine unacceptable for use’). 
Response 
The CCB abbreviation means ‘Cold Chain Break’. 
During the trial, four subjects did receive an injection of the investigational product having been 
exposed to too high storage temperature (>8°C). These events were discovered by the investigators 
after the vaccines have been effectively injected, and consequently, these events have been consigned 
in the individual CRFs and later denominated/classified as ‘subject received a vaccine unacceptable for 
use’ by sponsor monitors and data management team. These events do not really represent ‘wrong 
medication/vaccination’ events. As with all similar types of events, these subjects have not been 
considered in the PP population but were, obviously, considered in the ITT population. 
CHMP comment: 
The MAH provided an explanation for the discrepancy between ‘wrong vaccine administration’ and 
‘wrong medication/ vaccination’. Four subjects were vaccinated using a vaccine suspension that had 
been stored at too high storage temperatures. These subjects were excluded from the PP analysis set. 
This is acknowledged. 
Question 2 
Vaccine response rates for PT were lower in the current study (93.8%) compared to those in previous 
studies as summarised in the SmPC (99-100% for both the 2-dose and 3-dose vaccination schemes). 
Since the reverse cumulative distribution curve (RCDC) for PT and Table 9.22 of A3L33 CSR show Ab 
levels of at least 25 EU/mL for all subjects (i.e. 100% with ≥8 EU/mL = 4xLLOQ) the observed vaccine 
response rate for PT would indicate that >6% of subjects showed protective levels at baseline (i.e., ≥ 
4 x LLOQ / ≥8 EU/mL) combined with an (unexpected) decrease in Ab levels from baseline to post-
dose 3.   
The applicant is asked to provide data (PT and FHA) on subsets of subjects experiencing a decrease in 
aP Ab levels during the course of the study. 
Response 
The MAH do not fully concur with reviewer's conclusion that vaccine response rates for PT were lower 
in the current study (93.8%) compared to those observed in previous studies as summarized in the 
SmPC (98.4-100% for both the 2-dose and 3-dose vaccination schemes). The only trial previously 
conducted with this product and which used the exact same infant 3-dose primary series regimen has 
been trial A3L15 from which results have been used to feed some of the data presented in the SmPC 
immunogenicity Table 1; column 3 (anti-PT Ab VR rate of 100%). Due to the known lower overall 
immunogenicity of the 6-10-14 week infant regimen, we consider that the historical observation of a 
100% VR rate in the A3L15 trial might in fact not represent the true performance of the product when

used in such regimen. Trial A3L33 has provided another perspective of the immune performance of this 
vaccine when used with the EPI regimen, and due to inter-trial variability results have been different. 
The reality is probably in the middle. 
In addition, it should be remembered that the definition of the Vaccine Response rate (VRR) used to 
describe responses1 is not taking in consideration the expected decline of the maternally derived Abs 
that might be present on some of the pre-primary series samples and that will decline over time 
between the pre-primary series time point and the post-primary series time point (following generally 
a 3-week half-life period). The use of a VRR based on this method of calculation would have certainly 
provided higher values. In fact, the use of this adjusted VRR should be applied particularly for antigens 
when it is expected high prevalence of maternally transmitted antibodies. 
We have extracted from the A3L33 trial database the subjects who have not presented an increase of 
anti-PT and/or of anti-FHA during the course of the study (either they have maintained equal levels or 
have presented lower levels). This analysis identified 10 subjects (out of 156) for anti-PT Abs and 1 
subject for anti-FHA Abs. No subject presented with an absence of responses against the two pertussis 
antigens. 
The antibody levels against PT in these 10 subjects are listed below:

Their Ab levels at pre-dose 1 time point (6 weeks of age) were high and originated from passively-
transmitted maternal antibodies. Despite this, their individual post-dose 3 Ab levels (18 weeks of age) 
were high and not fundamentally different from the Ab levels achieved in their ‘sero-negative at 
enrollment’ counterparts. 
The antibody levels against FHA in the subject identified was 71 EU/mL and 46 EU/mL before and after 
vaccination, respectively. Again, the same conclusion could be drawn.

Vaccine response was defined as % of subjects with post-Dose 3 anti-PT or anti-FHA Ab concentrations ≥ 4 x 
LLOQ (8 EU/mL) when pre-vaccination concentration was < 4 x LLOQ or ≥ pre-vaccination anti-PT or anti-FHA 
concentrations if pre-vaccination concentrations were ≥ 4 x LLOQ 
In conclusion, the MAH considers that it is not true that the ‘response rates’ for PT were lower in the 
current study. This conclusion is driven by the mode of calculation of the ‘response rates’ used in these 
studies. A criteria taking into consideration the expected decline of the maternally derived Abs would 
provide higher ‘response rates’ values. Finally, as Ab against PT and against FHA are not correlates of 
protection but can only be seen as a surrogate of protection, the full interpretation of these 
observations remains unclear. 
CHMP comment: 
The subjects that presented with a decline in Ab levels from pre-dose 1 to post-primary dose 3 had 
indeed very high Ab levels at baseline that resulted from passively transmitted maternal Abs. Every 
subject showed satisfactory anti-PT and anti-FHA Ab levels following the 3-dose primary vaccination. 
The MAH’s explanation is acknowledged.

3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
Results from N01353, a phase IV study conducted in Korea, show that LEV adjunctive therapy was not 
superior to TPM adjunctive therapy with regard to efficacy measured by retention in subjects with 
refractory partial onset seizures. However, the retention rate is of 59.1% at 52 weeks showing 
effectiveness in these subjects with refractory epilepsy. 
The evaluation of the safety data demonstrated that LEV was well tolerated. No new safety concerns 
were identified in this study. 
The MAH considers that no changes to the approved EU Product Information for Keppra are proposed 
following the completion of this study.  
This study was solely submitted in accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation. 
Recommendation  
The CHMP endorses the submission of this study in accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric 
Regulation and confirms that there is no impact on either the Product Information or on the benefit-
risk balance of the EU authorized formulations. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required

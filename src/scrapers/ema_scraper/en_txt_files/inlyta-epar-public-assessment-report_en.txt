2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Renal cell carcinoma is the third leading urologic cancer.  About 30% of patients with RCC have 
metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, and a significant proportion of patients with localized 
disease treated with curative nephrectomy relapse subsequently with metastatic disease. Metastatic 
RCC is associated with a high quality-of-life burden, based on physical, psychological, and social 
criteria, and drastically reduced survival; only about 8% to 22.5% of mRCC patients survive for five 
years or more as compared to 90% of patients with localized renal cancer. Despite substantial progress 
in the understanding and treatment of mRCC in recent years, its incidence is increasing, and the 
disease is still considered incurable. The most frequent locations of metastases are the lungs, 
mediastinum, bone, liver, and brain.   
Until the development of agents that target tumour angiogenesis and other signaling pathways, 
systemic therapy with the cytokines interleukin 2 (IL-2) or interferon (IFN)-α was the main treatment 
for advanced RCC. Currently, eight drugs are approved for the treatment of advanced RCC, including 
IL-2, IFN-α, sorafenib, sunitinib, everolimus, temsirolimus, bevacizumab in combination with IFN-α, 
and pazopanib. Systemic therapy with the cytokines IFN-α and/or IL-2 was until recently the main 
treatment of advanced RCC, however, the use of both agents has declined substantially since the 
introduction of therapies targeting angiogenic pathways.   
About the product 
Axitinib is tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2 
and VEGFR-3. These receptors are implicated in pathologic angiogenesis, tumour growth, and 
metastatic progression of cancer. Axitinib has been shown to potently inhibit VEGF-mediated 
endothelial cell proliferation and survival. Axitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in 
xenograft tumour vasculature that expressed the target in vivo and produced tumour growth delay, 
regression, and inhibition of metastases in many experimental models of cancer. 
The Applicant applied for the indication: Inlyta is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of prior systemic treatment.  
The CHMP adopted a positive opinion for the following indication: 
Inlyta is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after 
failure of prior treatment with sunitinib or a cytokine. 
Axitinib should be taken orally twice daily approximately 12 hours apart with or without food. Axitinib 
tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. Treatment should continue as long as clinical 
benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs, that cannot be managed by concomitant 
medicines or dose adjustments. If the patient vomits or misses a dose, an additional dose should not 
be taken. The next prescribed dose should be taken at the usual time. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1 
Introduction 
Inlyta is available as 1 mg and 5 mg film-coated tablets containing axitinib as the active substance. 
The 1 mg strength tablets are red, oval, debossed with “Pfizer” on one side and “1 XNB” on the other, 
Inlyta 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 12/92 
 
 
 
whereas the 5 mg film-coated tablets are red, triangular, debossed with “Pfizer” on one side and 
”5XNB” on the other. The drug product is packaged in Al/Al blisters or HDPE bottles with desiccant.  
The full list of ingredients is defined in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2. 
Active Substance 
Axitinib is an indazole derivative obtained by chemical synthesis and is chemically designated as 
Benzamide, N-methyl-2-[[3-[(1E)-2-(2-pyridinyl)ethenyl]-1H-indazol-6-yl]thio] 
Axitinib is a white to light yellow powder, weak base, non-hygrospic, classified as Biopharmaceutics 
Classification System (BCS) class II (low solubility, high permeability), and exhibits polymorphism. Five 
crystalline anhydrous forms have been identified (Form I, Form IV, Form VI, Form XXV and Form XLI). 
A number of crystalline solvates and hydrate forms have been observed and an amorphous form has 
been prepared. The polymorphic form intended for marketing is Form XLI. 
Full information on the active substance axitinib is provided in the dossier. 
Manufacture 
The active substance is manufactured in five synthetic steps followed by recrystallisation. A design 
space has been developed for steps 4, 5 6 and milling and operational boundaries are proposed for all 
process parameters. The development has been widely discussed. An extensive impurity discussion is 
provided on each step of the synthesis including both results of purging and spiking studies. The 
structure of each possible impurity is provided in a flow-chart showing where in the synthesis each 
possible impurity can be formed and the fate of each possible impurity. Flexibility has been granted for 
synthetic routes of starting materials. 
Specification 
The active substance specification is set based on the critical quality attributes (CQA), historical data, 
toxicological and clinical evaluation, validation data and stability data and is considered acceptable. 
Both the polymorphic form and the particle size distribution are critical quality attributes (CQA) for the 
dissolution  of  the  active  substance,  which  is  classified  as  BCS  class  II  drug  (low  solubility,  high 
permeability).  Both  the  polymorphic  form  and  the  particle  size  distribution  are  limited  in  the  active 
substance specification. 
The specification includes tests for appearance, identification by Infrared (IR) and by High Performance 
Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), assay by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), 
polymorphic form by X-Ray diffraction, impurities by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), 
Inlyta 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 13/92 
 
 
 
 
 
residue on ignition, heavy metals, particle size by laser diffraction and residual solvents by Gas 
Chromatography (HPLC/GC). 
Impurities have been evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of view of safety. 
Satisfactory  justification  for  the  chosen  parameters  and  related  limits  in  the  active  substance 
specification  and  analytical  procedures  are  presented  in  the  dossier  according  to  relevant  guidelines 
(ICH Q6a and Q3A) and European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) standards.  
The descriptions of the analytical methods are considered acceptable and their validations are 
performed in accordance with ICH standards and Ph. Eur. requirements.  The concept of Quality by 
Design (QbD) is used in the development of the HPLC method selected for determination of 
identification, assay and purity of axitinib.  As a result of this a Method Operable Design Region 
(MODR) has been proposed defining ranges for certain method parameters which have been found 
acceptable.  
Batch data from three commercial batches of pilot scale synthesised using the proposed route and 
supporting data from a number of development batches is provided. Results confirm batch to batch 
consistency and support uniformity of the quality of the active substance. 
Stability 
Satisfactory stability data on three commercial batches stored at ICH long-term conditions (25ºC/60% 
RH) for 36 months and at accelerated conditions (40ºC/75% RH) for 6 months has been provided.  
The parameters tested were appearance, water content, assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), polymorphic 
form by Powder X-ray diffraction and microbial quality.  
Forced degradation studies exposing the active substance to acid, base, free radical initiator, hydrogen 
peroxide, heat, humidity or high intensity light conditions have also been performed demonstrating 
that the active substance is sensitive to light.   
The photo stability study was performed according to ICH Q1B and also demonstrated that axitinib is 
photolabile.  
The stability data provided support the recommended retest period at the proposed packaging and 
storage conditions.  
2.2.3 
 Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Axitinib is a non-hygroscopic, white to light yellow powder, classified as BCS II (low solubility and high 
permeability). Polymorphic form XLI was chosen as it is the most thermodynamically stable 
polymorphic form. The drug substance has generally low solubility, but is highly soluble in the gastric 
(pH 1.7). The particle size is limited to ensure bioperformance.  
The excipients used in Inlyta are microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, croscarmellose 
sodium, magnesium stearate and film coating Opadry II red  (hypromellose, titanium dioxide, lactose 
monohydrate, triacetin and red iron oxide). All excipients are well-known and commonly used in tablet 
formulations and meet the corresponding requirement of the European Pharmacopoeia, where 
appropriate. 
The compatibility of the active substance with the excipients has been investigated by performing 
stress studies (high temperature and humidity). The tablet core formulation was tested to confirm 
Inlyta

acceptable chemical stability and various film coating systems were also tested. The active substance, 
the excipients and the coating were directly mixed to enhance the possible affect of the coating. The 
hypromellose based coating system is more compatible with axitinib than the PVA/PEG (polyethylene 
glycol) based coating systems. During development, the hypromellose white coating system was 
adjusted to include red iron oxide to improve photo-stability. During this time a switch was made from 
the less photo-stable form IV drug substance to a more stable form, form XLI and changing the colour 
of the coating from white to red gave better protection against light. 
The purposeful degradation test demonstrated that the polymorphic form change and modification in 
coating system resulted in a chemically more stable formulation. 
The tablets used in early clinical trials were manufactured by a wet granulation process and were 
subsequently modified to dry granulation formulation to reduce processing time and material costs. A 
design space was developed for the manufacturing process. The critical quality attributes identified 
were uniformity of dosage units, dissolution and photo-stability.  
Three packaging system were investigated during development. A HDPE bottle with desiccant and 
Al/AL blister were chosen.  
Adventitious agents 
An extensive TSE/BSE assessment was completed on the excipients used to manufacture axitinib 
tablets in accordance with the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal 
Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products” (EMEA/410/01, 
Revision 2). All excipients are of non-animal origin except for the lactose monohydrate used in the core 
tablet and in the coating.  It is certified by the manufacturers that the lactose monohydrate used in 
this formulation is produced in compliance with the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products” 
(EMEA/410/01, Revision 2). 
Manufacture of the product 
Inlyta 1 and 5mg tablets are manufactured by a dry granulation process. The manufacturing process 
consists in blending, milling, dry granulation, tabletting, film-coating and packaging.  
The manufacturing formula, flow chart and description of the manufacturing process are presented.  
A design space was developed for the milling, dry granulation and milling and the film coating steps of 
the manufacturing process and the critical quality attributes identified were uniformity of dosage units, 
dissolution and photo-stability. A process validation scheme is presented and is considered acceptable. 
Product specification 
Satisfactory specification has been presented for the finished product and includes tests for 
appearance, identification (UV & HPLC), pH, assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), uniformity of dosage 
units (HPLC), microbiological control and dissolution.  
The proposed test procedures and acceptance criteria comply with the requirements of the Ph. Eur. 
and current ICH guidelines. Analytical procedures are described and validated.  
The concept of Quality by Design (QbD) is used in the development of the HPLC method selected for 
determination of identification, assay, nurity and uniformity of dosage units. As a result of this a 
Method Operable Design Region (MODR) has been proposed defining ranges for certain method 
parameters which have been found acceptable.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Non-clinical studies were conducted in mice, rats, monkeys, rabbits and dogs. 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicokinetics of axitinib have been 
investigated mainly in mice, dogs and in limited studies in rats and monkeys. 
Inlyta 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 16/92 
 
 
 
The nonclinical safety profile of axitinib has been evaluated in vitro, and in vivo in rodent (mice, rats) 
and non-rodent species (rabbits, dogs). The in vivo safety pharmacology and toxicology studies were 
conducted in mice and dogs.  
All pivotal safety pharmacology and toxicology studies were conducted in compliance with GLP. Non-
pivotal studies were non-GLP. These studies were conducted by laboratories that operate in compliance 
with GLP or in accordance with standard operating procedures at the conducting site. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Axitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against its intended target kinases, the kinase domains 
of VEGFRs. Both the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated FLVK (FGFlikeVEGF kinase) were used in 
the assays. In addition, axitinib was also tested for its potency against a panel of closely related 
kinases in the Type III, IV, and V receptor tyrosine kinase family. These tests showed that axitinib is a 
potent, ATP-competitive inhibitor of the following protein kinases: VEGFR-1, -2 (both the non-
phosphorylated and phosphorylated FLVK), murine VEGFR-2 and PDGFR-β. Ki values ranged from 0.7 
to 22 nM (data not shown). 
Axitinib is more potent against the non-phosphorylated form than against the phosphorylated form of 
VEGFR kinases because it binds to the “DFG-out” conformation, which is more predominant in the 
unphosphorylated structure.  
Further, the selectivity of axitinib was tested in a panel including approximately 100 different kinases. 
Axitinib at 1 µM concentration was reported to inhibit 10 non-PDGFR family kinases by more than 50%. 
The circulating plasma sulfoxide metabolite of axitinib (M12) was evaluated for kinase selectivity 
against a panel of 52 kinases. Two kinases (Aur-2 and AMPK) were inhibited by more than 50% at 1 
µM of M12.  
In endothelial cells, axitinib inhibited VEGF-mediated autophosphorylation of VEGFRs with IC50s of 
0.09-0.12 nM for VEGFR-1, 0.2±0.06 nM for VEGFR-2, and 0.1-0.29 nM for VEGFR-3. Axitinib showed 
weaker inhibitory activity against the autophosphorylation of PDGFR-α, PDGFR-β and KIT, with IC50s 
of 5.0±1.0 nM, 1.6±0.4 nM, and 1.7±0.6 nM, respectively. Furthermore, axitinib inhibited VEGF-
mediated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) survival with an IC50 of 0.24±0.09 nM; in 
the same assay, axitinib demonstrated approximately 1000-fold selectivity for VEGFR-2 versus FGFR-1. 
Axitinib was not potent against the cellular activities of other RTKs tested, including CSF- 1R, Flt-3, 
RET, EGFR and cMet (protein encoding the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor, proto-oncogene).  
Axitinib dose-dependently inhibited 3-D tubule formation of spheroidal endothelial cells embedded in 
the fibrin matrix. Axitinib also blocked VEGF-mediated endothelial cell adhesion and migration on 
extracellular matrix proteins, and it induced endothelial cell apoptosis as early as 6 hours after exposed 
to the compound in cell culture. The treatment of HUVECs with axitinib produced a rapid, potent and 
dose-dependent inhibition of eNOS, Akt, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation with concentrations similar to 
that required for VEGFR inhibition. The inhibition of eNOS and Akt phosphorylation by axitinib was fully 
reversible only 0.5 to 2 hours after the withdrawal of the compound. In contrast, under the same 
experimental conditions, the VEGFR-2 phosphorylation remained partially suppressed for at least 24 
hours.  
Axitinib also has functional effects on tumour cells that express PDGFRs and KIT. For instance, in 
PDGFR-β positive human glioma U87MG cells, axitinib dose-dependently inhibited PDGF-BB-stimulated 
Inlyta 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 17/92 
 
 
 
cell migration (but not proliferation). Axitinib dose dependently inhibited KIT phosphorylation in KIT+ 
human SCLC NCI-H526 cells. 
However, the concentrations required for modulating PDGFR-β and KIT mediated cellular activity were 
greater than that required for modulating VEGFR activity, consistent with the potency and selectivity 
profile of axitinib. Finally, with as high as 1 to 10 μM concentrations, axitinib had little anti-proliferative 
effect on tumour cells that do not express VEGFRs, PDGFRs, and/or KIT. 
The two major human metabolites of axitinib M12 (sulfoxide) and M7 (N-glucuronide) were evaluated 
for VEGFR-2, PDGFR-β, and KIT cell activity. In cells, M12 had minimal effect on VEGF mediated 
HUVEC survival, and PDGFR-β and KIT autophosphorylation until its concentrations were at least 400-, 
470- and 290-fold higher, respectively, than those required by its parent compound axitinib (average 
values). The N-glucuronide metabolite showed approximately 8300-fold less activity against VEGFR-2 
autophosphorylation compared to axitinib. M7 is also expected to have little activity against PDGFR-β 
and KIT based on activity test results using a structurally homologous analog compound. Furthermore, 
the computer modelling of the co-crystal structure of M7 and the kinase domain of VEGFR2 suggested 
that N-glucuronidation at the NH position of axitinib disrupted a key hydrogen bond and significantly 
compromised an appropriate fit in the ATP binding site.  
The in vivo effects of anti-angiogenesis of axitinib were investigated in retinal tissues of rats and 
xenograft tumours in mice.  
Newborn rats were treated with two IP injections of axitinib hydrochloride of 10 or 30 mg/kg before the 
retinal tissues were collected and processed. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot (IP/IB) 
experiments were performed for the determination of rat VEGFR-2 phosphorylation. Compared to 
vehicle-treated tissues in the control group, VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in the axitinib-treated tissues 
was reduced by 80 – 90% one hour after the second injection of the compound of both dose levels. In 
the low-dose group, the signal fully rebounded at 6 hours post-dose, when the unbound plasma drug 
concentration was 0.017±0.02 ng/mL (or 0.04±0.06 nM), much below the value of IC50 for VEGFR-2 
(0.20±0.04 nM). In the high-dose group, a 50 – 60% recovery of phospho-VEGFR-2 signal occurred 6 
– 24 hours postdose. This was associated with an unbound plasma drug concentration of 0.57±0.14 
ng/mL (6 hour) and 0.066 ± 0.008 ng/mL (24 hour), which translated to 1.5±0.36 nM (6 hour) and 
0.17±0.02 nM (24 hour), respectively. The full activity of VEGFR-2 rebounded between 24–32 hours 
postdosing. Overall, the degree of target inhibition correlated to the plasma concentration across the 
time points. A non-linear regression analysis of the 30 mg/kg group in Prizm (Graphpad) using the 
sigmoidal doseresponse model revealed an EC50 for target inhibition of 0.49 (±3.1) nM or 0.19 ng/mL 
In the M24met human melanoma xenograft model it was found that a single oral dose of axitinib (50 
mg/kg) suppressed murine VEGFR- 2 phosphorylation in tumour tissues for up to 7 hours compared to 
the vehicle-treated tumours. In the 30 mg/kg dose group, the level of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in the 
tumours inversely correlated with axitinib plasma concentrations. The same study also measured the 
phosphorylation of tumour ERK (MAPK44/42) by Western blot. The ERK signal was partially inhibited 
by axitinib treatment. The inhibition quickly reached a plateau (30 minutes after the dose) and the 
signal remained partially inhibited for at least 7 hours. 
The effect of axitinib on PDGFR-β phosphorylation was examined in a rat C6 glioma tumour model. 
Mice with large tumours were administered axitinib at 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg (po; 3 doses in 1.5 days). 
At 10 or 30 mg/kg, axitinib produced partial inhibition of PDGFR-β phosphorylation, whereas significant 
(90%) and more sustained inhibition of PDGFR-β activity was observed at 100 mg/kg.  The unbound 
plasma exposure in the 10 mg/kg group did not reach the IC50 for PDGFRs, and axitinib plasma 
exposure in the 30 mg/kg dose levels reached the IC50 for PDGFR-β only transiently. In all dose groups 
the full activity of PDGFR-β did not return within 48 hours, although the drug concentration in the 
plasma was no longer detectable at 24 hours.

Based on chronic treatment studies of MV522 human colon carcinoma xenografts, the 
pharmacologically efficacious concentration, Ceff, was estimated to be 22–66 ng/mL in plasma of 
humans. 
In a TGI study in the MV522 model in mice, the ED50 was 8.7 mg/kg (BID). The ED70 and ED80 doses in 
mice were 30 mg/kg (BID) and 60 mg/kg (BID), respectively. Correlating plasma exposure with length 
of exposure for the 10 mg/kg BID dose level (i.e. approximately ED50) showed that a 50% TGI would 
be achieved if: 1) the unbound plasma concentration was maintained at or above 0.85 nM (or a total 
concentration of 66 ng/mL in humans) for ≥10 hours/day; or 2) the unbound plasma concentration 
was maintained at or above 0.65 nM (or a total concentration of 50 ng/mL in humans) for ≥16 
hours/day; or 3) the unbound plasma concentration was maintained at or above 0.28 nM (or a total 
concentration of 22 ng/mL in humans) for 24 hours.  
Axitinib showed dose-dependent primary TGI (45-87% at 30 mg/kg) in the SC or orthotopically 
implanted human xenograft and rodent tumour models including tumour models of breast, colon, lung, 
pancreas, kidney, brain, skin and liver with marked inhibitory effect on local and distant tumour 
metastasis in the orthotopically grown and spontaneous metastasis models of HCT-116 GFP (human 
colon carcinoma), SN12C-GFP (human renal cell carcinoma) and M24met (human melanoma). 
In the MV522 tumour model, a prolonged dosing break (>1 week) between treatment cycles caused a 
significant compromise in anti-tumour efficacy of axitinib while similar efficacy was obtained with QD 
and BID dosing. 
Axitinib was evaluated for its ability to enhance anti-tumour efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents, 
radiation therapy or targeted therapy. Axitinib was combined with docetaxel in the subcutaneously 
implanted tumours of the human xenograft of breast cancer model MDA-MB-231 and MDAMB-
435\HAL-Luc; and in the murine LLC model; with carboplatin in the human ovarian carcinoma model 
A2780; with gemcitabine in the human pancreatic carcinoma model BxPC-3; with radiation therapy in 
the human prostate carcinoma model DU145, with the MEK inhibitor PD-0325901 in the human 
melanoma model A2058; and with bevacizumab in the human colon carcinoma model MV522 and the 
human melanoma model M24met. The combination therapies resulted in improvement in efficacy 
consistently across models, ranging from efficacy enhancement (less than additive), to an additive 
effect, and to synergism (more than additive effect). Significant anti-tumour effect was also observed 
with axitinib in tumour populations that were insensitive to bevacizumab (data not shown). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Axitinib was evaluated in radioligand displacement assays against the following receptors or ion 
channels at up to 10 µM: adenosine A1 and A2A; adrenergic α1, α2, β1, and β2; bradykinin B2; calcium 
channel type L; dopamine D1 and D2L; estrogen ERα; GABAA (agonist and chloride channel); 
glucocorticoid; glutamate (N-methyl D-aspartate); glutamate (non-selective); glycine (strychnine-
sensitive); histamine H1 and H3; insulin; muscarinic M1, M2, and M3; and neuropeptide Y2, nicotinic 
acetylcholine (central); opiate (δ, κ, μ); phorbol ester; purinergic (P2X, P2Y); serotonin (5-HT1, 5-HT2); 
igma (non-selective); sodium channel (site 2); tachykinin NK1; testosterone. 
Modest binding affinity in the low µM range was observed for the adenosine A2A (Ki of 2.76 µM), 
muscarinic M2 (Ki of 2.23 µM), and neuropeptide Y2 (IC50 of 10 µM) receptors. In secondary functional 
assays, the effect of axitinib on the A2A, M2, or Y2 receptors at concentrations up to 30 µM was less 
than the predefined effect criterium of ≥ 50% agonistic or antagonistic activity. Results were in the 
range 0-19%. The highest response detected was a 19% antagonistic effect on M2 receptors in atria 
from guinea pig.

Safety pharmacology programme 
Axitinib was evaluated for potential effects on the central nervous system, cardiovascular and 
respiratory system and gastrointestinal system in vitro and/or in vivo.  
Axitinib was administered as an oral suspension (0.5% w/v aqueous CMC) in all in vivo studies. Studies 
with repeat-dose administration were conducted with BID dosing, approximately 6 hours apart.  
Plasma protein binding values of 97.0%, 98.1%, and 98.0% were used to calculate the unbound Cmax 
or AUC in mouse, rat, and dog, respectively, in those safety pharmacology studies where exposure 
values were available. 
The results of the safety pharmacology studies are summarised in table 1.

No relevant studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics has been studied in mice, rats, beagle dogs and cynomolgus monkeys following 
IV and PO administration. 
Bioavailability following PO administration was low to moderate in all animal species and humans: 16% 
in mice, 3-31% in rats, 10-59% in dogs, 3% in monkeys and 58% in human patients. 
The peak plasma concentration following PO administration was generally observed within 8 hours in 
mice, 5 hours in rats, 7 hours in dogs, 5 hours in monkeys and 4 hours in human patients. 
The terminal half-life following PO administration was 1-10 hours in mice, 1-4 hours in rats, 0.4-6 
hours in dogs, 10 hours in monkeys and 3 hours in healthy humans.  
Volume of distribution and clearance following PO administration were 0.8 L/kg and 0.7 L/hr/kg in 
mice, 0.8 L/kg and 0.7 L/hr/kg in monkeys and 1 L/kg and 0.4 L/hr/kg in humans. Following IV 
administration, volume of distribution and clearance were 2 L/kg and 2 L/hr/kg in mice, 32 L/kg and 24 
L/hr/kg in rats and 1 L/kg and 0.7 L/hr/kg in dogs.  
Following single dose IV or PO (monkeys and humans) administration, axitinib showed a volume of 
distribution that was comparable to the total body water in all species tested including humans 
(mouse: 3-fold, rat: 48-fold, dog: 1.7-fold, monkey: 1.2-fold and human: 1.7-fold relative to total 
body water of the respective species).

Exposure exceeded dose-proportionality in mice, rats and (possibly) dogs following repeated dosing 
but was not investigated in monkeys. Overall, no accumulation was found in mice and dogs following 
repeated dosing, while it was not investigated in rats and monkeys. In clinical studies, minimal 
accumulation was observed. 
Oral administration of axitinib to fed dogs resulted in higher exposure than when administered to 
fasted dogs, whereas in mice, no apparent effect of food on exposure was observed. In healthy 
humans, a high-fat, high-calorie meal produced a 19% increase in axitinib (Form XLI) exposure (based 
on AUC) compared to an overnight fast. However, a moderate-fat, standard-calorie meal decreased 
axitinib exposure by 10-fold when compared to axitinib exposure in fasted healthy humans (based on 
AUC).  
Axitinib has moderate to high passive permeability with evidence of efflux in Caco-2 cells. In 
transfected cells, axitinib was shown to be a weak substrate for both P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) and 
breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2). 
In OATPs, substrate activity was noted for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. However, the passive permeability 
of axitinib is expected to greatly exceed the active uptake component. 
The tissue distribution of axitinib has been evaluated in male (pigmented) B6C3F1/Crl BR mice 
following single PO administration of [14C]-axitinib (50 mg/kg). Radioactivity was rapidly absorbed and 
well distributed into the tissues. All tissues exhibited maximal tissue concentration at a time point 
before or equal to the time point for Tmax suggesting rapid distribution. The tissues that reached peak 
concentration at the latest time point (4 hours) were preputial gland, uveal tract and mucosae of the 
small intestine, caecum and large intestine.  
The highest levels of radioactivity were associated with the gall bladder, kidney cortex, kidney medulla, 
liver, exorbital lachrymal, intra-orbital lachrymal and Harderian glands, brown fat, bulbo-urethral gland 
myocardium, pancreas, uveal tract and the mucosae of the gastrointestinal tract (excluding the 
mucosa of the rectum). The lowest measured concentrations were in the brain and spinal cord. 
Peak concentrations of radioactivity occurred at 1 hour post-dose in most tissues, after which levels 
declined rapidly such that by 24 hours, most no longer contained quantifiable radioactivity. At 48 hours 
post-dose, quantifiable radioactivity was only present in the liver, gall bladder and uveal tract. Drug-
related material was bound to melanin, substantiated by the high levels of radioactivity present in the 
uveal tract of the eye at all sampling times. 
Axitinib distributed to bone marrow, skin and eyes.  
At concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 20 µg/mL, axitinib was strongly bound to plasma protein (96-
99%) in plasma from mice, dogs and humans.  Plasma protein binding was found not to be entirely 
concentration independent. With a mean binding value of 99%, axitinib was highly bound to human 
serum albumin. A definitive value for the binding to α1-acid glycoprotein could not be determined. 
However, the best estimates suggested only moderate binding of axitinib to this protein. 
The metabolism of axitinib was been studied in vivo in mice, dogs and humans and in vitro in 
microsomes and hepatocytes from mice, rats, dogs, monkeys and humans. The primary metabolic 
pathways of axitinib involve oxidations and direct glucuronidation/ glucosylation followed by secondary 
oxidations and glucuronidation/glucosylation of the primary metabolites. 
Metabolism in man was investigated in a mass balance study, where 5 mg [14C]-axitinib was 
administered PO to healthy males. The N-glucuronide (M7) was the predominant metabolite and 
accounted for approximately 50% of the circulating radioactivity. The sulfoxide metabolite (M12) and 
unchanged parent drug accounted for 16% and 23%, respectively, of the circulating radioactivity. In 
Inlyta 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 23/92 
 
 
 
faeces, the parent drug represented the single most predominant radioactive component (12% of the 
dose). 
The combined in vivo metabolic data indicated some species differences. Nevertheless, all human 
metabolites were found in one or both of the animal species used for toxicological testing except for 
three metabolites (M8a, M12a and UNK). These three metabolites were found in human urine or faeces 
and not in plasma. 
Quantitative differences in axitinib metabolism in liver microsomes were found between mice, dogs and 
humans with regard to the circulating metabolites M7 and M12. While M12 was found at lower-to-
comparable levels in humans as compared to mice and dogs, M7 was found in humans at levels 3-5-
fold higher than in mice while it was not detected in dog plasma.  
In vitro, axitinib was shown to be a substrate for CYP3A4/5 and to a lesser extent for CYP2D6, 
CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2C8 and CYP1A2. At therapeutically relevant concentrations, axitinib did not 
cause significant inhibition or induction of CYP P450 enzymes in human liver microsomes.  
Faecal excretion was the primary route of elimination of [14C]-axitinib, accounting for the majority of 
the administered dose (66-83%) following PO administration to mice and dogs. Faecal excretion was 
relatively rapid, occurring largely within the first 48 hours in both species. Urinary excretion accounted 
for 6-13% of the administered dose in both species. Trace amounts of unchanged parent drug was 
found in mouse and dog urine. No gender differences were observed. 
In bile duct cannulated dogs, 53% of the dose was recovered from the faeces and an additional 8% 
was recovered from bile at 240 hours post-dose. 
In healthy humans, elimination of axitinib with faeces generally accounted for 30-60% of the total dose 
while 14-28% of the dose was detected in the urine with only race amounts of unchanged axitinib in 
the urine.

Local Tolerance  
Axitinib  was  evaluated  for  the  potential  to  cause  local  irritation  when  administered  IV  or  PV  as  a 
parenteral formulation in the ear of New Zealand white rabbits (data not shown).  
Other toxicity studies 
The phototoxicity potential of axitinib was evaluated based on significant absorbance in the ultraviolet 
A  range  with  a  molar  extinction  coefficient  of  32754  L/mol/cm  at  333  nm  when  calculated  at  pH  7.4 
and the potential to reach eye and skin tissue  following systemic administration. Axitinib was studied 
for phototoxic potential in the 3T3 fibroblast Neutral Red Uptake assay and in hairless, albino mice. The 
studies are summarised in table 7.

2.3.6.  Discussion and conclusion on the non-clinical aspects  
In vitro data demonstrate that axitinib is a selective kinase inhibitor that appears to be more potent on 
VEGFR  kinases  and  PDGFR  kinases  (including  KIT)  compared  to  other  RTKs  and  intracellular  kinases. 
Inhibition of VEGF-mediated intracellular signalling has been demonstrated in cells treated with axitinib 
in nM concentrations.  
The  lack  of  formal  interaction  studies  is  acceptable,  considering  that  axitinib  is  intended  used  as 
monotherapy.  
In  safety  pharmacology  studies,  elevated  systolic,  diastolic  and  mean  arterial  blood  pressure  were 
observed  in  mice  and  rats,  and  possibly  in  dogs.  Hypertension  has  been  observed  in  clinical  studies 
with axitinib, and blood pressure is to be monitored before and during treatment with axitinib. 
In studies of biotransformation, the major substances detected in mouse plasma were the parent drug 
and  the  sulfoxide  metabolite  M12,  and  the  glucuronide  conjugate  M7.  In  humans,  M7  was  the  major 
metabolite,  together  with  M12.  In  dogs,  only  the  sulfoxide  metabolite  M12  was  detected  in  plasma. 
Qualitatively,  the  metabolism  in  mouse  is  sufficiently  representative  to  humans.  The  major  human 
metabolite M7 is however not formed in dog. In general, phase II conjugates are less pharmacological 
active  than  the  parent  substance  and  are  not  considered  to  pose  safety  concerns.  Furthermore, 
adequate  exposure  in  one  species  is  considered  sufficient  in  general  toxicity  evaluation.  Taken 
together,  it  is  acceptable that  one  of  the  main  metabolites  in  humans  (M7)  appears  to  be  formed  by 
only  one  of  the  species  chosen  for  non-clinical  testing  of  axitinib.  The  use  of  mouse  and  dog  for  the 
toxicological evaluation of axitinib is therefore considered acceptable. 
The  desmethyl  metabolite  AG-013887  was  found  not  to  be  present  in  human  excreta,  and  was  only 
identified in vitro. Therefore, it is agreed that testing of AG-013887 for CYP-related drug metabolism is 
not relevant. The rationale for not testing the two major circulating metabolites, M7 and M12, for CYP-
related drug metabolism is accepted since the potential for interactions is deemed very low.

Major toxicity findings in mice and dogs following repeated dosing for up to 9 months were the 
gastrointestinal, haematopoietic, reproductive, skeletal and dental systems, with NOAEL approximately 
equivalent to or below expected human exposure at the recommended clinical starting dose (based on 
AUC levels). 
Axitinib was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxicity assays in vitro. A significant 
increase in polyploidy was observed in vitro at concentrations > 0.22 µg/ml, and an elevation in 
micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes was observed in vivo with NOEL 69-fold the expected 
human exposure. Genotoxicity findings are not considered clinically relevant at exposure levels 
observed in humans. 
The  lack  of  carcinogenicity  studies  is  acceptable  considering  the  proposed  patient  population  in 
accordance with the ICH S9 guideline. 
Axitinib-related findings in the testes and epididymis included decreased organ weight, atrophy or 
degeneration, decreased numbers of germinal cells, hypospermia or abnormal sperm forms, and 
reduced sperm density and count. These findings were observed in mice at exposure levels 
approximately 12-fold the expected human exposure, and in dogs at exposure levels below the 
expected human exposure. There was no effect on mating or fertility in male mice at exposure levels 
approximately 57-fold the expected human exposure. Findings in females included signs of delayed 
sexual maturity, reduced or absent corpora lutea, decreased uterine weights and uterine atrophy at 
exposures approximately equivalent to the expected human exposure. Reduced fertility and embryonic 
viability were observed in female mice at all doses tested, with exposure levels at the lowest dose 
approximately 10-fold the expected human exposure. 
Pregnant mice exposed to axitinib showed an increased occurrence of cleft palate malformations and 
skeletal variations, including delayed ossification, at exposure levels below the expected human 
exposure. Reversible physeal dysplasia was observed in mice and dogs given axitinib for at least 1 
month at exposure levels approximately six-fold higher than the expected human exposure. Partially 
reversible dental caries were observed in mice treated for more than 1 month at exposure levels 
similar to the expected human exposure. Other toxicities of potential concern to paediatric patients 
have not been evaluated in juvenile animals. 
In  the  nonclinical  toxicology  program,  considerable  variability  in  exposure  was  documented  in  the 
mouse  and  dog  studies.    Variability  in  clearance  data  after  intravenous  administration  appears  to  be 
limited. Thus, plausible explanations for the high variability in exposure data after oral administration 
could be dissolution of the active substance, GI transit, absorption, and first pass extraction processes. 
Furthermore,  statistical  analyses  have  been  performed  to  test  for  significant  differences  in  Cmax  and 
AUC  between  dose  groups  in  the  pivotal  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  in  mice  and  dogs.  In  mice, 
exposure  levels  were  in  general  significantly  different  between  groups.  However,  in  the  dog  studies, 
statistical  significant  difference  in  exposure  could  not  be  demonstrated  for  all  dose  groups.  Taken 
together, the cause of the high data variability is still unclear, and estimated safety margins must be 
interpreted  cautiously.  Nevertheless,  dogs  have  been  exposed  to  axitinib  levels  higher  than  what  is 
expected  in  humans,  and  for  the  sought  indication  safety  margins  <  1  can  be  accepted.  Further 
investigations are therefore not considered necessary.  
Interspecies  comparison  for  both  total  and  unbound  plasma  levels  of  axitinib  has  been  performed  at 
NOAEL  in  the  pivotal  toxicity  studies,  and  at  expected  human  exposure  at  5  mg  BID,  indicates  no 
margins  of  safety  for  the  toxic  effects.  With  regards  to  potential  for  genotoxic  effects,  there  are 
substantial  safety  margins  to  NOEL  for  the  micronucleus  formation  (127  and  69  for  Cmax  and  AUC, 
respectively,  in  female  mice),  indicating  low  clinical  relevance.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that 
intended maximal human dosing is up to 10 mg BID, and higher human plasma levels would therefore 
Inlyta 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 32/92 
 
 
 
be  expected.  Further,  the  submitted  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicokinetic  data  show  a  high  variability, 
especially in dogs. The interspecies comparison should therefore be interpreted accordingly. 
The clinical relevance of a negative phototoxicity study in albino mice could be questioned, considering 
low  to  non-existing  margins  of  safety  based  on  systemic  exposure,  that  axitinib  is  distributed  to 
pigmented skin and possibly retained in the uveal tract, and that no data has been presented showing 
that axitinib is sufficiently distributed to skin in non-pigmentated mice. It is recognised, however, that 
distribution  studies  in  pigmented  mice  shows  that  the  axitinib-related  radioactivity  in  pigmented  skin 
was comparable with the levels in plasma and skeletal muscle (i.e. non-pigmented tissue) at 1, 4, 8, 
24  and  48  hours  after  administration  (below  LoQ  at  time  points  >  4  hours),  while  the  levels  in  the 
heavily pigmented uveal tract was substantially higher at all time points. It is therefore plausible that 
the axitinib-related radioactivity in pigmented skin would be comparable to the plasma concentration in 
both pigmented and non-pigmented mice, and the in vivo study is therefore considered valid. In view 
of  the  negative  3T3  assay  in  vitro,  negative  phototoxicity  in  vivo  and  the  lack  of  photosensitive 
reactions in clinical safety data, axitinib is not considered to have a phototoxic potential.  
With regard to the environmental risk assessment, axitinib is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A total of 23 phase I and phase II clinical studies with pharmacokinetic data were submitted, with 822 
patients receiving axitinib, including 14 studies in healthy patients (A4061003, A4061004, A4061006, 
A4061007, A4061018, A4061021, A4061026, A 4061033, A4061037, A4061047, A4061050, 
A4061052, A4061053, A4061063), 4 studies in patients with advanced RCC (A4061012, A4061023, 
A4061035, A4061046), 4 studies in patients with various solid tumours (A4060010, A4061019, 
A4061022, A4061044), and 1 study in patients with hepatic impairment which included a control 
healthy volunteer group (A4061036).  
Population pharmacokinetic analysis (PMAR-00075, PMAR-00079,) and PK/PD analysis (PMAR-00080, 
PMAR-00074 including supplementary analysis PMAR-00074S,) were made using data from most of the 
studies with PK data. In addition, PK data from 55 of the 361 patients from the phase III study 
(A4061032) were included in a separate population pharmacokinetics and PK/PD analyses (PMAR-
000140). 
Plasma concentrations versus time data were modelled using a population analysis approach to 
estimate the population pharmacokinetic parameters (mean and inter-subject variability) and to 
identify potential covariates (intrinsic and extrinsic factors) that impact axitinib pharmacokinetics. The 
population analysis full data set contained subject identification, dosing information, time of sample 
collection, plasma axitinib concentrations, demographics, and physiological data for healthy volunteers 
or patients.

The bioanalytical methods used to measure axitinib concentrations in human plasma and urine samples 
included a HPLC coupled with tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) detection. 
Absorption  
After oral administration, maximal plasma concentrations occur within 4 hours (range of median Tmax 
across studies 2.5-4.1 hours). Mean absolute bioavailability was found to be 58% in the fasted state 
and 54% in the fed state. 
Different axitinib formulations have been used in the clinical studies, and several bioequivalence 
studies with different formulations, both in the fasted and fed state, are submitted. The commercial 
form is the crystal polymorph form XLI FCIR, while many studies have used form IV wet or dry 
granulation FCIR formulations. The axitinib form IV dry granulation 5-mg tablets were found 
bioequivalent to the form IV wet granulation 5-mg tablets in the fasted state. Axitinib form IV and form 
XLI 5-mg tablets were bioequivalent when administered in the fed state, but not in the fasted state.  
Five 1-mg tablets and one 5-mg tablet of the commercial tablet (crystal polymorph Form XLI) in the 
fasted state were bioequivalent. 
For the form IV FCIR tablet the average peak Cmax concentration following oral-fed treatment was 
39%-57% lower than the oral-fasted treatment in different studies. The AUC0-∞ the average exposure 
for the oral-fed treatment was 7%-36% lower than the oral-fasted treatment. With this formulation, 
ventricle pH-reduction (by the proton pump inhibitor rabeprazole) reduced by 42% axitinib Cmax( , but 
AUC was only marginally affected.   
For the commercial form XLI FCIR tablet, there were no clinically significant changes in axitinib plasma 
exposure or Cmax in the presence of food. A high-fat, high-calorie meal with this formulation produced a 
mean 19% increase in axitinib exposure compared to an overnight fast (10 hours predose/4 hours post 
dose fast) regimen, while a moderate-fat, standard-calorie meal decreased axitinib exposure by 10% 
compared to axitinib fasted.  
Distribution 
The plasma protein binding of axitinib at therapeutic concentrations was >99%. The average Cmax and 
AUC increased proportionally over an axitinib dosing range of 5 to 10 mg.  
The summary of axitinib PK parameters following administration of multiple doses of axitinib (5 mg BID) 
is presented in table 10.

Metabolism 
Following  a  single  oral  administration  of  14C-labelled  drug  to  healthy  male  volunteers,  axitinib 
underwent  extensive  metabolism  to  a  variety  of  primary  and  secondary  metabolites.  Metabolic 
pathways  included  depyridinylation  followed  by  formation  of  a  carboxylic  acid  (M5),  glucuronidation 
(M7), methyl hydroxylation followed by glucuronidation (M8a), both sulfoxidation and N-oxidation (M9), 
sulfoxidation  (M12),  mono-oxygenation  on  the  pyridine  ring  (M12a  and  M14),  and  sulfonation  (M15). 
In  plasma,  the  glucuronide  M7  represented the  predominant  metabolite  accounting  for  approximately 
50%  of  the  circulating  radioactivity,  while  the  sulfoxide  M12  and  unchanged  parent  drug  exhibited 
comparable levels with each accounting for approximately 20% of the circulating radioactivity.  
Several  studies  that  included  human  biomaterials  were  conducted  to  investigate  the  metabolism  of 
axitinib. These studies showed that axitinib is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP3A4/5, and to a 
lesser extent (<10%) by CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and UGT1A1.  
Elimination 
Hepatobiliary elimination is the major route of elimination for axitinib. About 20% of the administered 
dose is excreted renally as metabolites. 
In  urine,  the  carboxylic  acid  M5  represented  the  predominant  metabolite  (approximately  6%  of  the 
dose),  followed  by  M12  (approximately  4%  of  the  dose),  M7  (approximately  3%  of  the  dose),  M9 
(approximately 2% of the dose), and M8a (approximately 1 % of the dose). In faces, the parent drug 
represented  the  predominant  radioactive  component  accounting  for  12%  of  the  dose.  All  faecal 
metabolites together accounted for approximately 16% of the dose. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Axitinib plasma pharmacokinetics was dose-proportional, linear pharmacokinetics was observed for the 
single  dose  5  mg  to  10  mg  dose  range.  No  conclusive  data  exists  on  doses  higher  than  10  mg.  The 
plasma pharmacokinetics of axitinib at steady state was linear. 
The mean observed accumulation ratio for axitinib plasma AUC0-12 with continuous BID dosing ranged 
from 1.35 to 1.48. The pharmacokinetic properties of axitinib remain constant during chronic dosing. 
Inter-subject  variability  of  axitinib  PK  parameters  is  about  80  CV%  and  intra-subject  variability  is 
about 20-22 CV%. 
Special populations 
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis PMAR-00079, age over 60 years had statistically significant 
influences  on  axitinib  CL.  Age  over  60  years  was  associated  with  a  decrease  in  CL,  resulting  in 
correspondingly higher axitinib exposures. However, this effect did not substantially decreased the high 
variability  associated  with  axitinib  disposition  and  was  not  considered  clinically  significant.  Therefore, 
no dose adjustment for axitinib is required in elderly patients.  
Axitinib has not been tested in patients < 18 years of age. 
In population analysis of axitinib pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers increasing body weight was 
estimated to increase Vc of axitinib. However, this effect was within the range of estimated inter-
individual variability and therefore not considered clinically relevant. 
The pooled population pharmacokinetic dataset included 501 males and 89 females.  Gender was not a 
significant  covariate  for  CL  and  Vc  for  axitinib.    No  dose  adjustments  for  axitinib  are  recommended 
based on gender.

The population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that Japanese ethnicity was associated with reduced 
axitinib clearance (~25%), resulting in correspondingly higher axitinib exposures. In addition, in a 
formal comparison of axitinib pharmacokinetics in 20 Caucasian and 20 Japanese healthy volunteers, 
the geometric mean ratios for axitinib AUC0-∞ and Cmax in Japanese versus Caucasians were 103 % and 
96.2 % respectively. The 25% reduction in axitinib CL in Japanese observed in the population 
pharmacokinetics analysis is less than the corresponding estimated typical inter-individual variance 
(~60%) in axitinib CL. 
The pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of a single 5-mg dose of axitinib has been evaluated in 24 
subjects including patients with mild (Child-Pugh A), patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) impaired 
hepatic function and healthy volunteers with normal hepatic function. Mild hepatic impairment did not 
alter axitinib plasma exposure (AUC0-∞ and Cmax) compared to normal hepatic function. There was a 
~2-fold increase in axitinib AUC0-∞ and a 1.3-fold increase in axitinib Cmax in patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment compared to healthy volunteers with normal hepatic function. Axitinib has not been 
studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 
Axitinib has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Population PK analyses showed that 
axitinib clearance was not altered in patients with renal impairment and no dose adjustment of axitinib 
is required. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The applicant submitted the results of two in vivo drug-drug-interaction studies that were conducted to 
assess the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions of axitinib with a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor 
(ketoconazole) and CYP3A4/5 inducer (rifampin), respectively. 
In study A4061004, ketoconazole,  a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, administered at a dose of 400 mg 
once daily for 7 days increased the mean AUC 2-fold and Cmax 1.5-fold of a single 5-mg oral dose of 
axitinib in healthy volunteers.  
In study A4061026, rifampicin, a strong inducer of CYP3A4/5administered at a dose of 600 mg once 
daily for 9 days reduced the mean AUC by 79% and Cmax by 71% of a single 5 mg dose of axitinib in 
healthy volunteers. 
The effect of the proton pump inhibitor rabeprazole on the steady-state plasma pharmacokinetics of 5 
mg BID axitinib was assessed in 6 patients in study A4060010. In the presence of rabeprazole, the 
axitinib Cmax was decreased 42%, but the AUC was only marginally affected. 
As smoking is known to induce CYP1A2, the effect of smoking on axitinib CL was evaluated in a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis included 434 non-smokers, 19 active smokers and 137 ex-
smokers. The analysis indicated that active smokers had a higher axitinib CL (~102%), resulting in 
lower axitinib exposures, but the smoking effect was not well defined in the model (SE was estimated 
to be high, i.e. 44%).  
The applicant submitted the results of the in vitro studies of CYP and UGT inhibition and induction. 
In vitro studies (AG-013736-PDM-020) with human liver microsomes and specific P450 probe 
substrates were conducted to evaluate the ability of axitinib to inhibit cytochrome P450 isoforms 
(CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4). Axitinib competitively 
inhibited CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 with Ki values of 0.7 and 8.3 µM, respectively. In addition, axitinib 
noncompetitively inhibited CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 with Ki values of 0.5 and 52.2 µM, respectively. In the 
concentration range of 0.3-40 µM, axitinib moderately inhibited CYP2A6 but did not inhibit CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, or CYP2E1.  
Inlyta 
CHMP assessment report

The results of another in vitro study showed that axitinib is an inhibitor of digoxin efflux, with an 
inhibitory potency (IC50) of 3.0 μM indicating that axitinib is a potent inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. 
In AG-013736-PDM-039 study the effect of axitinib on CYP1A2-dependent phenacetin O-deethylation in 
human liver microsomes was evaluated. Axitinib was shown to be a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2-
dependent activity with IC50 values ranging from 0.2-0.3 μM respectively.  
In study 764-05388 axitinib at concentrations of 0.13, 0.65, and 1.29 μM was evaluated for the ability 
to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A1/2 and CYP3A4) in primary human hepatocyte cultures in 
comparison to prototypical inducers (rifampin, dexamethasone, 3-methylcholanthrene  and β-
naphthoflavone). Axitinib exhibited a 0.5- to 2.7-fold change in the levels of CYP1A1/2 activity in 
human hepatocytes, and caused a 0.1- to 1.1-fold change in CYP3A4-catalysed testosterone 6β-
hydroxylation in human hepatocytes.  
In a clinical study (A4061019) in which patients with advanced solid tumours were co-administrated 
axitinib and paclitaxel, a known CYP2C8 substrate, there was no increase in plasma exposures of 
paclitaxel.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Axitinib is an oral, potent and selective, small molecule ATP-competitive inhibitor of VEGFR-1, 2 and 3. 
VEGFR-1, 2 and 3 have been identified as important targets for tumour-associated angiogenesis and 
lymphangiogenesis, key processes that support tumour growth and metastasis (Holopainen et al. 
2011). It has been demonstrated that angiogenesis in RCC is significantly dependent on VEGF and its 
receptors (Albiges et al. 2011).  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Soluble proteins that were assessed in the axitinib clinical development program included plasma 
VEGF, sVEGFR-2, sVEGFR-3 and sKIT. Plasma samples were collected in multiple Phase II studies 
including studies A4061011 (NSCLC), A4061014 (thyroid cancer), A4061015 (melanoma), 4061022 
(advanced solid tumours), A4061035 (cytokine-refractory advanced RCC), and A4061044 (advanced 
solid tumours); in all studies a 5 mg BID starting dose of axitinib was used.  
Significant decreases in sVEGFR-2 (mean % change from baseline ranging from -27% to -42%) and 
sVEGFR-3 (mean % change from baseline ranging from -26% to -55%) and increases in plasma VEGF 
(mean % change from baseline ranging 152% to 460%) concentrations were observed following 
axitinib 5 mg BID dosing in study A4061015. By contrast, axitinib had relatively little or no effect on 
plasma concentrations of sKIT at this clinical dose. Study A4061022 assessed changes in s-VEGFR-2 on 
Cycle 2 Day 1 following administration of axitinib 5 mg BID as a function of axitinib steady-state 
exposure (AUC0-12 on Cycle 1 Day 15).  The results showed rapid decreases in s-VEGFR-2 with 
increasing exposures up to  ~200 ng.hr/mL after which further increases in plasma exposure were 
associated with marginal further decrease in s-VEGFR2. Following administration of a 5 mg BID dose of 
the intended commercial Form XLI axitinib tablets, the mean AUC0-24 was 330-367 ng.hr/mL in the fed 
state (Studies A4061044 and A4061046).   
VEGF promotes vasodilation by mechanisms involving NO and PGI2 production, and VEGF plays an 
important role in maintaining baseline vascular tone by regulation of NO synthesis (Bhargava 2009). 
Increase in blood pressure is a frequent clinical observation associated with inhibition of the VEGF 
pathway (Robinson et al. 2010). The correlation between effects of axitinib on blood pressure and drug

exposure was studied in study A4061022. At the 5 mg axitinib dose, no discernible effects on dBP or 
sBP were observed. 
The correlation of axitinib plasma exposures with elevation of dBP (> 90 mmHg) was assessed in the 
population PK/PD report PMAR-00080. Since dBP is more stable than sBP, changes in dBP were used 
for the analysis. At baseline, approximately 10%, 3%, and 5% of RCC patients in studies A4061012, 
A4061023 and A4061035, respectively, had mild elevation of dBP (90-99 mmHg). By the end of the 
first treatment cycle, approximately 35%, 12%, and 75% of RCC patients in studies A4061012, 
A4061023 and A4061035, respectively, had experienced elevations of dBP. 
To evaluate if the axitinib-related BP increase was simply a surrogate for axitinib plasma exposure 
(PMAR-00080), the relationship between AUCss and BP (maximum absolute dBP, as well as change in 
dBP from baseline) at both the end of the first treatment cycle and any time during the study 
treatment) was explored using linear regression. Results showed a weak correlation between axitinib 
exposure and dBP for patients with cytokine-refractory (studies A4061012 and A4061035) and 
sorafenib-refractory (study A4061023) RCC patients (R2 values <0.10).  Also in the population PK/PD 
analysis PMAR-00140, using data from 55 patients from the Phase 3 study (A4061032) a weak 
correlation between axitinib exposure and dBP for all patients (R2 values <0.10) was found.   
PMAR-00074 and supplementary analysis PMAR-00074S are population PK/PD evaluations for the 
assessment of the effect of axitinib plasma concentration on the heart rate corrected QT interval length 
(QTc) prolongation. The analysis uses data from study A4061004, a randomised, 2-way crossover 
study in 35 healthy subjects. QT intervals were measured following a single dose of axitinib (5 mg) in 
the absence and presence of 400 mg ketoconazole. Absolute QTcF and QTcB values were not greater 
than 450 msec for all males and not greater than 470 msec for all females in the study across all 
treatments. Similarly, the maximum QTcF and QTcB changes from baseline did not exceed the 
clinically significant category of 60 msec or greater for any of the subjects across all treatments.  
2.4.4.  Discussion and conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
For the commercial form XLI FCIR tablet, there were no clinically significant changes in axitinib plasma 
exposure or Cmax in the presence of food. Axitinib may be administered with or without food.  
The effect of increased pH has been investigated for the earlier polymorphic form IV of axitinib, 
yielding a 42% reduced Cmax and no significant effect on AUC. However, the final polymorphic form XLI 
has a 2-3 fold reduced aqueous solubility, and therefore, translation of the pH interaction results 
obtained from polymorphic form IV to the final polymorphic form XLI is uncertain. The CHMP 
recommended the applicant to assess the effect of increased pH in an ongoing study (A4061046, a 
double-blind, Phase II study in patients with metastatic RCC). Patients in this study are allowed the 
use of drugs that can increase gastric pH (proton pump inhibitors [PPI] as well as H2-blockers), and it 
will be feasible to compare axitinib pharmacokinetics in patients taking PPIs and H2-blockers versus 
those who are not.  
In clinical studies with axitinib, the systemic exposure to axitinib was approximately two-fold higher in 
subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) compared to subjects with normal 
hepatic function. A dose decrease is recommended when administering axitinib to patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) (e.g. the starting dose should be reduced from 
5 mg twice daily to 2 mg twice daily). Axitinib has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh class C) and should not be used in this population. No dose adjustment is 
required when administering axitinib to patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A). 
Virtually no data are available regarding patients with a creatinine clearance of <15 ml/min. Therefore 
no dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment.

Co-administration of axitinib with strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
clarithromycin, erythromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and 
telithromycin) may increase axitinib plasma concentrations. Grapefruit may also increase axitinib 
plasma concentrations. Selection of concomitant medicinal products with no or minimal CYP3A4/5 
inhibition potential is recommended. If a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor must be co-administered, a dose 
adjustment of axitinib is recommended. 
CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 constitute minor (< 10%) pathways in axitinib metabolism. The effect of strong 
inhibitors of these isozymes on axitinib pharmacokinetics has not been studied. Caution should be 
exercised due to the risk of increased axitinib plasma concentrations in patients taking strong inhibitors 
of these isozymes. 
Co-administration of axitinib with strong CYP3A4/5 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, dexamethasone, 
phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital, and Hypericum perforatum [St. John’s 
wort]) may decrease axitinib plasma concentrations. Selection of concomitant medicinal products with 
no or minimal CYP3A4/5 induction potential is recommended. If a strong CYP3A4/5 inducer must be 
co-administered, a dose adjustment of axitinib is recommended. 
The effect of smoking-related CYP1A2 induction on axitinib pharmacokinetics has not been fully 
characterised. The risk of decreased axitinib plasma concentrations should be considered when 
administering axitinib to smokers. The CHMP recommended the applicant to submit a pooled PK/PoP-
PK analysis with smoking as a covariate using data from ongoing trials in patients with non small-cell 
lung cancer and already available phase II data.  
In vitro studies indicated that axitinib may have the potential to inhibit CYP2C8, CYP1A2 and P-
glycoprotein. However, in a clinical study no effect of axitinib on the PK of paclitaxel (a CYP2C8-
substrate) was found. Since no drug-drug interaction studies were performed to explore whether 
axitinib could inhibit CYP1A2 or P-glycoprotein a warning included in the section 4.5 of the SmPC, as 
follows: ‘‘In vitro studies indicated that axitinib has a potential to inhibit CYP1A2. Therefore, CYP1A2 
substrates should be used with caution since co-administration of axitinib may result in increased 
plasma concentrations of CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. theophylline)”. 
In vitro studies in human hepatocytes also indicated that axitinib does not induce CYP1A1, CYP1A2, or 
CYP3A4/5. Therefore co-administration of axitinib is not expected to reduce the plasma concentration 
of co-administered CYP1A1, CYP1A2, or CYP3A4/5 substrates in vivo. 
PK/PD analyses indicated that axitinib-related increase in dBP in individual patients is an independent 
pharmacodynamic response that does not simply represent axitinib plasma exposure. 
Axitinib at plasma exposures up to two-fold greater than therapeutic levels expected following a 5 mg 
dose did not produce clinically significant QTc prolongation. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
The applicant conducted one pivotal phase III study A4061032 and three phase II single-arm studies 
A4061012, A4061035 and A4061023. The summary of efficacy studies conducted by the applicant is

a “Completed” signifies that the analysis for primary endpoint has been completed and a clinical study report (CSR) is available; 
however, subjects may still be receiving treatment under the same protocol and are being followed for overall survival and 
safety. 
 The cut-off date for the pivotal Phase 3 RCC study (A4061032) was 31 August 2010. 
b Due to an underestimation of the dropout rate prior to progression, the planned enrollment was increased from the initial 
target enrollment of 540 subjects to 650 subjects (Protocol Amendment 4 dated 16 November 2009).  
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
The axitinib starting dose of 5 mg BID was determined to be the MTD (using standard safety criteria) 
in  the  FIH  study  in  subjects  with  advanced  solid  tumours  (Study  A4060010).  The  primary  DLT  was 
hypertension.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  first  10  subjects,  a  dose  of  20  mg BID  exceeded  the  MTD. 
DLTs also occurred in subjects in the first 2 cohorts who received 10 mg BID (either as a starting dose 
or a dose reduction), and therefore this dose was also considered above the MTD.  
The rationale for the 5 mg BID starting dose selection was further supported by the following data: 
Changes  in  vascular  permeability/blood  flow:  Clinical  evaluation  of  drug-related  changes  in  vascular 
permeability/blood flow in humans was assessed by dce-MRI at an axitinib starting dose of 5 mg BID. 
Axitinib  exposures  observed  at  the  MTD  (5  mg  BID  in  the  fasted  state)  in  the  FIH  study  (Study 
Inlyta 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 40/92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A4060010) and those observed in clinical studies at the recommended starting dose (5 mg BID in the 
fed state; mean steady state AUC0-24 330-367 ng.hr/mL) were within the range of pharmacodynamic 
activity as determined by dce-MRI. This provided evidence that the starting dose in subjects that was 
selected based on safety considerations (5 mg BID) corroborates well with the optimal dose suggested 
by the pharmacodynamic assessment of drug-related changes in vascular permeability and flow. 
Changes in soluble proteins: At the axitinib starting dose of 5 mg BID, drug-related changes in soluble 
proteins  related  to  the  antiangiogenesis  pathway  were  measured.  Overall,  axitinib  preferentially 
modulates sVEGFRs and sVEGF at the clinical starting dose of 5 mg BID. 
Population  pharmacokinetic  modelling  of  clinical  response:  At  the  axitinib  starting  dose  of  5  mg  BID, 
population  PK-PD  modelling  showed  that  the  observed  clinical  response  (tumour  size  reduction)  in 
subjects  with  advanced  RCC  correlated  closely  with  plasma  exposures.  In  addition,  clinical  response 
was observed at 5 mg BID in subjects with advanced RCC. 
2.5.2.  Main study  
A4061032 
This was a phase III, randomised, open-label, multicentre study of axitinib compared with sorafenib in 
patients with advanced RCC after failure of treatment with one prior systemic therapy including 
sunitinib, bevacizumab + IFN-α, temsirolimus, or cytokine(s), or combination of these. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Eligible patients were male or female, 18  years or  older, with histologically or cytologically confirmed 
diagnosis of RCC with a component of clear cell subtype, with evidence of metastatic disease.  Subjects 
were  to  have  at  least  one  measurable  target  lesion  documented  radiographically  (CT  or  MRI),  and 
disease progression according to RECIST v1.0, after one prior systemic first-line regimen for advanced 
RCC.  The prior regimen must have contained one or more of the following: sunitinib, bevacizumab + 
IFN-α,  temsirolimus,  or  cytokine(s).    Prior  systemic  treatment,  radiotherapy,  or  surgical  procedures 
should have ended at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment (4 weeks for bevacizumab + IFN-α treatment) 
with resolution of all treatment-related toxicity to NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 Grade ≤ 1 or back to baseline 
with the exception of alopecia or hypothyroidism.  Subjects were to have adequate organ function, an 
ECOG PS of 0 or 1, and a life expectancy of ≥12 weeks.  
Subjects  were  excluded  from  the  study  if  they  had  prior  treatment  of  advanced  RCC  with  more  than 
one systemic first-line regimen, treatment with any neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic therapy, major 
surgery <4 weeks or radiation therapy <2 weeks prior to starting the study treatment; prior palliative 
radiotherapy to metastatic lesion(s) was permitted, provided there was at least one measurable lesion 
that had not been irradiated.   
Treatments 
Patients  were  randomised  at  a  ratio  of  1:1  to  receive  either  axitinib  (Arm  A)  or  sorafenib  (Arm  B). 
Study treatment was required to begin within seven days of randomisation. 
Treatment was administered continuously in 4-week cycles. In Arm A, the starting dose of axitinib was 
5 mg BID administered orally with food.   In Arm B, sorafenib was administered orally without food at 
a starting dose of 400 mg BID.  In both arms, doses were to be taken as close to 12 hours apart as 
possible  and  at  approximately  the  same  times  each  day.    Subjects  who  tolerated  axitinib  with  no 
Inlyta 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 41/92 
 
 
 
 
related adverse events above CTCAE  Grade 2 for a consecutive 2-week period were recommended to 
have  their  dose  increased  by  one  dose  level  to  7  mg  BID  and  subsequently  to  a  maximum  of  10  mg 
BID  (unless  the  subject’s  BP  was  >150/90  mm  Hg  or  the  subject  was  receiving  antihypertensive 
medication). Except for hypertension and proteinuria, a dose reduction to one lower dose level to 3 mg 
BID and subsequently to a minimum of 2 mg BID was recommended in subjects experiencing axitinib-
related  Grade  3  non-hematologic  toxicity.  For  treatment-related  Grade  4  non-hematologic  or 
hematologic toxicity, the axitinib dose was interrupted and restarted at one lower dose level as soon as 
improvement to CTCAE Grade ≤ 2 occurred.  
In Arm B, when dose reduction was necessary to manage sorafenib-related adverse drug reactions, the 
sorafenib  dose  was  reduced  to  400  mg  QD.  If  additional  dose  reduction  was  required,  sorafenib  was 
reduced to a single 400 mg dose every other day.   
No other chemotherapy or experimental anticancer treatments were permitted during the study period.  
Palliative  and  supportive  care  for  disease-related  symptoms,  including  pain  medications,  was 
permitted.    Palliative  radiotherapy  was  permitted,  but  only  for  pain  control  to  sites  of  bone  disease 
present  at  baseline,  and  only  following  bone  scan  imaging  demonstrating  no  new  sites  on  bone 
metastasis.   
Study treatment continued until subjects experienced PD, occurrence of unacceptable toxicity or death, 
or withdrawal of subject consent.  However, subjects were eligible for continued treatment as assigned 
at randomisation beyond the time of PD, defined according to RECIST v1.0, at the discretion of the 
treating physician. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare the PFS of patients with mRCC receiving axitinib versus 
sorafenib following failure of one prior systemic first-line regimen containing one or more of the 
following: sunitinib, bevacizumab + IFNα, temsirolimus, or cytokine(s). 
The secondary objectives included comparison of OS and ORR of patients in each arm, evaluation of 
safety and tolerability of axitinib, estimation of the DR of patients in each arm and comparison of the 
kidney-specific symptoms and health status of patients in each arm, as measured by the FKSI and 
EuroQol EQ-5D. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  was  PFS  defined  as  the  time  from  randomisation  to  first  documentation  of 
objective tumour progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. 
The key secondary endpoints were the following: 
-Progression-Free Survival (investigator assessment). 
-Overall Survival: OS was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of death due 
to any cause. For patients still alive at the time of the analysis, the OS time was censored on the last 
date  they  were  known  to  be  alive.  Patients  lacking  data  beyond  randomisation  had  their  OS  times 
censored at the date of randomisation. 
-Objective Response Rate: ORR was defined as the percent of patients with confirmed complete CR or 
confirmed  partial  response  (PR)  according  to  RECIST  criteria,  relative  to  all  randomised  patients.  
Confirmed  responses  were  those  that  persisted  on  repeat  imaging  study  at  least  4 weeks  after  initial 
documentation  of  response.  Third-party  blinded  review  and  qualification  were  performed 
retrospectively by the IRC.  Patients who did not have on-study radiographic tumour re-evaluation or 
Inlyta 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 42/92 
 
 
 
who died, progressed, or dropped out for any reason before reaching a CR or PR were counted as non-
responders  in  the  assessment  of  ORR.  A  patient  who  initially  met  the  criteria  for  a  PR  and  then 
subsequently became a confirmed CR was assigned a best response of CR. 
- Duration of response: DR was defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumour 
response  (CR  or  PR),  that  was  subsequently  confirmed,  to  the  first  documentation  of  PD  or  to  death 
due to any cause,  whichever occurred first. If tumour progression data included more than one date, 
the first date was used.   
Patients who achieved a PR and then a CR  had times calculated using the date of the PR as the  first 
day. DR was only calculated for the subgroup of patients with a confirmed objective tumour response. 
Other secondary endpoints were the following: 
-Functional  Assessment  of  Cancer  Therapy-Kidney  Symptom  Index:  The  FKSI  contains  15 questions 
and  includes  a  9-question  subscale  known  as  the  FKSI-DRS  subscale  that  specifically  measures 
symptoms related to advanced kidney cancer disease. This subscale includes the following items: lack 
of energy, pain, losing weight, bone pain, fatigue, short of breath, coughing, bothered by fevers, and 
haematuria. The total FKSI score is the sum of the 15 individual item scores. The total FKSI-DRS score 
is the sum of its 9 individual item scores. 
-EuroQol  Group’s  Self-Reported  Health  Status  Measure:  The  EQ-5D  is  a  self-administered  generic 
health status instrument consisting of two parts. In the first part, respondents were asked to describe 
their  current  health  state  on  five dimensions  (mobility,  self-care,  usual  activities,  pain  or  discomfort, 
and  anxiety  or  depression)  with  each  dimension  having  three levels  of  function  (1=no  problem, 
2=some problem, and 3=extreme problem). The second part is a patient’s self-rating of current health 
state  on  a  visual  analog  scale  (EQ-VAS)  with  endpoints  labelled  ‘best  imaginable  health  state’  and 
‘worst  imaginable  health  state’.  The  EQ-5D  endpoints  are  the  EQ-5D  Index,  which  is  derived  by 
combining one level from each of the  five dimensions and converting it to a single summary index or 
health  utility  value,  and  the  EQ-VAS  score,  which  ranges  from  0  for  worst  imaginable  health  state to 
100 for best imaginable health state. Overall, scores for the EQ-5D index range from -0.594 to 1, with 
low scores representing a higher level of dysfunction. 
Sample size 
A total of 409 patients with PD or death were required for the log-rank test with an overall 1-sided 
significance level of 0.025 to have power of 0.90. This assumed a 40% improvement in median PFS 
from 5 months to 7 months in patients randomised to receive axitinib and non-uniform accrual 
(approximately 40% of patients enrolled at 9 months).  Applying a 1:1 randomisation, a planned 
accrual period of 18 months, and a follow-up period of approximately 5 months, it was estimated that 
approximately 650 patients would need to be enrolled in order to observe 409 patients with PD or 
death by the end of the follow-up period.  The initial target enrolment was 540 patients; however, due 
to an underestimation of the dropout rate in the original protocol, the protocol was amended and the 
planned enrolment was increased.  
The sample size described above also allowed the assessment of differences in the secondary endpoint 
of OS with a high level of significance. A total of 417 events were required for a log-rank test with an 
overall 1-sided significance level of 0.025 to have power of 0.80.  This assumed a 31.67 % 
improvement in median OS from 18 months to 23.7 months in patients randomised to receive axitinib, 
and a follow-up period of approximately 37 months.   
The estimated sample size of 650 patients for PFS would also be sufficient to observe the 417 events 
needed for comparing median OS.

Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the investigational treatment of single-agent axitinib 
(Arm  A)  or  to  the  control treatment  of  single-agent sorafenib  (Arm  B).    Randomisation  was  stratified 
according to ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1) and by prior regimen (sunitinib-containing regimen vs. 
bevacizumab-containing  regimen  vs. 
temsirolimus-containing  regimen  vs.  cytokine-containing 
regimen).   
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open-labelled. However, the independent assessment of the primary endpoint (PFS) 
was done in a blinded manner by the IRC. 
Statistical methods 
A stratified (ECOG performance status and prior therapy) log-rank test with an overall 1-sided 
significance level of 0.025 was used to compare PFS between the two treatment arms.  
The study was designed to have one interim analysis and the final analysis.  The interim analysis and 
the final analysis were based on the primary endpoint of PFS as assessed by the IRC.   
The interim analysis of efficacy and safety was planned to be performed after approximately 204 PFS 
events (approximately 50% of the total number of required events as assessed by the IRC. If exactly 
204 expected events occurred at the time of the interim analysis, then the significance level for futility 
was 0.2293. 
The final analysis was planned to take place when 409 patients had documented PD or death. The 
overall type I error rate was preserved at the nominal 0.025 level. However, due to the futility interim 
analysis occurring after 289 events instead of the originally targeted 204 events, the number of total 
events needed for the final analysis was needed to be increased from 409 to 423 to maintain the same 
power of 0.90.

Recruitment 
First patient was randomised the 15th of September 2008 ; last treatment visit took place the 23rd of 
July  2010  and  the  cut-off  date  of  the  study  was  31st  of  August  2010 ;  last  patient  follow-up  will

Conduct of the study 
The clinical trial protocol was amended 4 times during the conduct of the study.  
The major amendments 3 and 4 are briefly described below: 
• 
Protocol Amendment 3 (dated 10 February 2009) 
-Changed  the  wording  of  prior  systemic  first-line  regimen  strata  to  sunitinib-containing  regimen, 
bevacizumab-containing  regimen,  temsirolimus-containing  regimen,  and  cytokine-containing  regimen 
to stratify prior systemic therapy according to similarity of mechanism of action. 
-Revised inclusion criteria to include patients with RCC subtype of cytologically confirmed clear cell; to 
remove  the  requirement  for  documentation  (using  prestudy  scans)  of  progressive  disease  and  a  4-
month window for progression; to allow enrollment of patients with hypothyroidism and to clarify that 
patients with uncontrolled angina were excluded. 
-Revised  the  timing  of  the  PK  collection  in  Cycle  2  Day  1  and  Cycle  3  Day  1  to  allow  collection  of  a 
predose sample up to 2 hours before the morning axitinib dose.  
• 
Protocol Amendment 4 (dated 16 November 2009) 
-Due to an underestimation of the dropout rate in the original protocol, the planned patient enrollment 
was increased from 540 to 650. The sample estimate was modelled without unblinding of the data and 
in consultation with the DMC. No change was made to the required number of PFS events. 
-Revised population PK sample collection for patients randomised to the axitinib arm to allow collection 
of PK samples from patients who had already completed Cycle 3 without PK sampling; these patients 
could have had PK samples taken at any 1 cycle beyond Cycle 3. 
-Allowed  collection  of  UGT1A1  and  other  pharmacogenomic  samples  at  any  time  during  the  study  if 
they were not collected at Cycle 1 Day 1. 
-Revised and allowed flexibility for the predose thyroid function tests to be performed within 7 days of 
Cycle 1 Day 1. 
-Revised the ‘‘Analysis for Primary Endpoint’’ section of the protocol in line with Protocol Amendment 3 
to  remove  the  requirement  for  pre  study  scans  confirming  disease  progression.  The  guidelines  for 
analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  did  not  include  sensitivity  analysis  for  patients  with  confirmed  prior 
progression compared to those who did not have confirmed prior progression based on pre study scan 
data.

Numbers analysed 
The  study  incorporated  723  patients,  with  361  patients  in  the  axitinib  arm.  Of  those,  361  (100.0%) 
patients  were  included  in  the  FAS  population  (all  patients  who  were  randomised),  and  359 (99.4%) 
patients were included in the SA set (all patients who received at least one dose of study medication).  
Of  the  362 patients  in  the  sorafenib  arm,  362 (100.0%)  patients  were  included  in  the  FAS  and 
355 (98.1%) patients were included in the SA set.

No studies have been conducted in special populations. 
Supportive studies 
The  applicant  has  submitted  three  supportive  Phase  II  studies  (studies  A406012,  A4061023,  and 
A4061035). 
The Phase II studies were open-label, single-arm, multi-centre, clinical studies of single-agent axitinib 
in  patients  with  advanced  RCC.  In  study  A4061012,  a  Simon’s  Minimax  2-stage  design  was  used  to 
test the alternative hypothesis that the true response rate was ≥15% versus the null hypothesis that 
the  true  ORR  was  ≤5%.  In  study  A4061035,  a  single  stage  design  was  used  to  test  the  alternative 
hypothesis  that  the  true  response  rate  was  ≥25%  versus  the  null  hypothesis  that  the  true  ORR  was 
≤10%. A single stage design was used in study A4061023 to test the alternative hypothesis that the 
true response rate was ≥20% versus the null hypothesis that the true ORR was ≤8%.

Subjects  were  to  have  a  histologically-  or  cytologically  proven  diagnosis  of  advanced  RCC.  Study 
A4061035  (N=64)  required  that  these  tumours  had  a  component  of  clear  cell  subtype.  Studies 
A4061012  (N=52)  and  A4061035  enrolled  subjects  whose  disease  had  progressed  on  or  after 
treatment with cytokine-based therapy, while study A4061023 (N=62) enrolled subjects whose disease 
had  progressed  on  or  after  treatment  with  sorafenib-based  therapy.  The  majority  of  subjects  were 
male  in  all  3  studies,  and  the  majority  of  subjects  had  clear  cell  RCC.  In  Studies  A4061012  and 
A4061023, most subjects were white, while in Study A4061035, all subjects were Japanese. A majority 
(>50%) of subjects had an ECOG-PS of 0 except in the sorafenib-refractory study A4061023 where the 
majority of subjects were ECOG performance status 1. Subjects were to have adequate organ functions 
and no evidence of uncontrolled hypertension.  
All  subjects  received  axitinib  administered  at  a  starting  dose of  5  mg  BID  under  fasting  conditions  in 
Study A4061012 and with food in Studies A4061023 and A4061035.  
In  Study  A4061023  and  A4061035,  intra-subject  dose  escalations  (up  to  a  maximum  of  10  mg  BID) 
were  permitted  based  on  tolerability.  Subjects  who  tolerated  axitinib  (no  treatment  related  adverse 
events above Grade 2 for  2 consecutive weeks) could have their dose increased up to 7 mg BID and 
then to a maximum of 10 mg BID (unless the subject’s BP was >150 mm Hg [systolic BP] or >90 mm 
Hg  [diastolic  BP]  or  the  subject  was  receiving  antihypertensive  medication).  Axitinib  could  be 
decreased due to toxicity to as low as 2 mg BID. In Study A4061012, a less aggressive form of dose 
escalation  was  implemented:  patients  who  tolerated  axitinib  could  have  their  dose  increased  by  20% 
after at least 8 weeks of treatment unless the subject was responding to therapy. 
The  primary  endpoint  for  the  studies  was  ORR  according  to  RECIST  based  on  tumour  assessments 
performed every 8 weeks. Evaluation by a blinded IRC (independent review committee) was performed 
in  Study  A4061035.    Secondary  endpoints  included  PFS  (analyzed  post-hoc  in  StudyA4061012);  TTP 
(except  in  Study  A4061023);  DR;  OS  and  PROs  (patient  reported  outcomes)  (except  in  Study 
A4061035).

Figure 11: Comparison of Median PFS in Pivotal Study A4061032 with Supportive Studies 
A4061012, A4061035, and A4061023 
Patient  reported  outcomes  were  assessed  in  supportive  Studies  A4061012  and  A4061023.  In  Study 
A4061012, there was little change from baseline in mean scores on the EORTC-QLQ C30 HRQoL results 
for  up  to  40  weeks  of  treatment.  In  study  A4061023,  axitinib  had  little  effect  on  individual  disease-
related symptoms. In summary, the patients treated with axitinib generally maintain their HRQoL. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Dose-response studies have not been submitted by the applicant. The starting dose of axitinib of 5 mg 
BID  was  well  justified  based  on  determinations  of  tolerability  in  patients  in  early  studies  and  on 
pharmacodynamic effects in clinical studies.  
The  open  label  design  of  the  pivotal  study  was  chosen  due  to  known  toxicity  differences  between 
axitinib  and  sorafenib,  and  also  due  to  differences  in  dosing  regimens  between  the  axitinib  and  the 
sorafenib  arm.  The  open  design  leads  to  an  increased  risk  of  bias.  However,  the  primary  analysis  of 
PFS was based on a blinded IRC assessment. 
The  relevance  of  sorafenib  as  comparator  has  been  questioned.  Sorafenib  has  only  been  studied  in 
patients  who  are  cytokine  refractory  and  should  thus  be  considered  an  experimental  treatment  in 
patients previously treated with a TKI.  In order to assess the efficacy of axitinib, inclusion of a placebo 
arm  would  have  been  informative  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  both  sorafenib  and  axitinib  in  these

patients. However, many clinicians would have considered it unethical to use a placebo control at that 
point in time. Furthermore, it is recognized that sorafenib was the only available active comparator on 
the market at the time that the pivotal study was designed and initiated.  
The overall design of the pivotal study, including the inclusion and exclusion criteria, is adequate.  The 
distribution of demographics and baseline characteristics and also other important factors like previous 
malignancy  and  disease  history  were  well  balanced  between  arms.  A  predominance  of  men  contra 
women, and white contra other races, characterised the study.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Results from the study revealed a median PFS of 6.7 months for the axitinib group and 4.7 months for 
the sorafenib group (HR: 0.665; 95% CI: 0.544, 0.812; p<0.0001).  The benefit in PFS was confirmed 
in an updated analysis (cut-off of 3 June 2011), showing a median PFS of 6.8 months for the axitinib 
group versus 4.7 months for the sorafenib group (HR=0.670; 95% CI: 0.558, 0.805; p<0.0001).   
The updated analysis of PFS according to subgroups of prior treatment based on blinded IRC, revealed 
a much lesser effect in the group with prior sunitinib regimen than in the prior cytokine group of 
patients. The difference in median PFS between the two arms in the prior sunitinib treated patients was 
1.4 months (HR=0.74; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.94; p=0.0063), while in the prior cytokine treated patients 
the difference was much more pronounced with 5.4 months (HR= 0.52; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.72; 
p<0.0001). 
The analysis of OS in the pivotal study gave no indication of any survival benefit of axitinib over 
sorafenib in the prior sunitinib group (HR=0.997; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.27) but a positive trend for OS was 
observed for axitinib over sorafenib in the prior cytokine group (HR= 0.813; 95% CI: 0.56, 1.19) with 
median OS of 29.4 months in the axitinib arm and 27.8 months in the sorafenib arm.  
The analysis of ORR showed a statistically significant improvement of 13.9% for axitinib compared to 
sorafenib  in  patients  pre-treated  with  cytokines.  In  the  prior-sunitinib  group,  the  difference  in  ORR 
between axitinib and sorafenib was 3.6%. 
Duration  of  response  and  patient  reported  outcomes  were  only  analysed  for  the  overall  study 
population.  There  were  no  differences  in  these  endpoints  between  the  axitinib  and  sorafenib  study 
arms.  
The  group  of  patients  previously  treated  with  temsirolimus  and  bevacizumab+IFN-α  are  very  small 
(n=25 and n=59, respectively), and therefore no firm conclusions can be made regarding the efficacy 
in these subgroups. 
However, the inconsistencies in the efficacy results of axitinib across the subpopulations based on prior 
therapy underscores that there is a need for a more precise definition of the patient populations 
benefiting from therapy with axitinib. Multiple agents for mRCC with overlapping mechanisms of action 
are presently being developed, but the rationale for selection of a second TKI is weak, and whether to 
select an mTOR instead of a TKI in second line treatment of RCC has not been thoroughly addressed. 
This further underlines the need of further research on predictive biomarkers. Therefore, the CHMP 
recommended that the applicant should investigate suitable biomarkers in metastatic RCC to allow 
identification and selection of a more targeted population of patients most likely to benefit from 
treatment with axitinib second line. This research is not expected to change the observed benefits but 
will provide further guidance on the treatment choice and will define better the therapeutic regimens. A 
report on the extended research program should be submitted within 3 months of the Commission 
Decision. Progress reports should be submitted on a yearly basis.

Additional expert consultation 
Following  the  CHMP  request,  a  Scientific  Advisory  Group  meeting  was  convened  on  2  March 2012  to 
provide advice on the following list of questions: 
1. Is sorafenib acceptable as comparator in the pivotal trial for axitinib? 
At the time that the pivotal trial was designed and initiated and based on the available knowledge at 
the time, sorafenib must be considered as a reasonable comparator. Although sorafenib was given in 
the  trial  in  a  non-approved  indication  (as  second  line  treatment  after  first  line  sunitinib),  it  was  also 
given in its approved indication (as second line treatment in patients who have failed prior interferon-
alpha or interleukin-2 based therapy). 
2. Is there a place for treatment with another VEGF-targeting TKI in the treatment of mRCC 
patients  previously  treated  with  sunitinib,  e.g.  in  patients  not  suited  for  treatment  with 
everolimus? 
It  is  indeed  welcome  to  have  an  additional  option  in  the  treatment  armamentarium  of  second  line 
mRCC therapy, particularly since axitinib has a distinct toxicity profile compared to available medicines. 
Although the development of agents with overlapping mechanisms of action and hence activities gives 
more choices to the physician and the patient, there is still uncertainty about the therapeutic value of 
second line TKIs in mRCC after failure of first line sunitinib and important questions, such as whether 
TKIs or mTOR inhibitors should be the preferred choice for second line mRCC therapy, have not been 
answered.  It  is  a  major  shortcoming  of  the  concurrent  development  of  multiple  agents  for  mRCC  in 
recent years that biomarkers have not been identified to help define target patient populations for each 
compound,  or  that  comparative  or  combination  trials  have  not  been  conducted  to  guide  treatment 
choice and better define therapeutic regimens. This further underlines the need of further research, e.g. 
biomarker  driven,  as  firmly  underlined  by  the  present,  approved  in  2006,  and  publicly  available 
proposed-upcoming guidelines. 
3. Is  the  observed  PFS  benefit  of  axitinib  compared  to  sorafenib  (+1.4  months  in  mPFS)  in 
patients pre-treated with sunitinib considered clinically relevant given that no positive trend 
was observed for OS in this subpopulation? 
It  is  important  to  note  that  the  comparison  of  axitinib  in  the  pivotal  trial  was  against  an  active 
comparator and that the median PFS in the axitinib arm was 4.8 months, which is considered clinically 
relevant.  With  regard  to  the  1.4  month  difference  in  PFS  compared  to  sorafenib,  it  is  noted  that, 
although small and clinically questionable, the difference was formally statistically significant, that the 
Hazard Ratio for the comparison was 0.74 and that the toxicity profile of axitinib was better than that 
of  sorafenib.  In  absolute  terms,  the  benefit-risk  of  axitinib  in  second  line  RCC  treatment  is  therefore 
considered positive. 
4. What is the relevance of an indication for axitinib restricted to patients previously treated 
with  cytokines,  considering  the  newer  therapies  now  recommended  for  first  line  treatment 
of mRCC? 
Although the use of cytokines as first line RCC treatment may currently be more of a health economic 
issue,  an  indication  for  axitinib  as  second  line  treatment  after  failure  of  such  cytokine  therapy  would 
still be of clinical use and it would serve clinical reality. However, there is no reason not to administer 
axitinib  after  first  line  sunitinib,  as  well,  as  the  pivotal  study  was  positive  even  in  the  subgroup  of 
patients  with  prior  sunitinib  treatment.  Overall,  an  indication  in  second  line  RCC  after  failure  of  prior 
sunitinib  or  cytokine  treatment  could  be  supported.  There  is  not  adequate  information  on  the  use  of 
axitinib after first line bevacizumab or temsirolimus treatment.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, a clinically relevant effect of axitinib has been shown in the patients previously treated 
with sunitinib or a cytokine. Regarding the primary endpoint PFS, the magnitude of the observed effect 
(HR=0.736 in the prior-sunitinib group; HR=0.519 in the prior-cytokine group) is considered clinically 
significant.    The  robustness  of  the  primary  endpoint  was  supported  by  a  positive  trend  on  OS  in  the 
prior-cytokine  group.  In  the  prior-sunitinib  group  there  was  no  indication  of  any  survival  benefit  of 
axitinib  over  sorafenib,  however,  the  PFS  results  were  very  consistent  and  robust  in  all  pre-specified 
and exploratory sensitivity and subgroup analyses to support on overall favourable conclusion. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The clinical program for axitinib included 31 completed studies and 10 ongoing studies at the time of 
the safety data cut-off date, 31 August 2010. The safety analyses presented are based on healthy 
volunteers and subjects with malignant disease who received axitinib in the completed clinical studies 
(including 2617 subjects). Separate analyses of critical safety data (demography, discontinuations, and 
SAEs including deaths) are available from ongoing clinical studies in subjects with solid tumours 
including a continued access study. In addition, SAEs, including deaths, are included from 4 IIR 
studies. There were 1067 subjects in ongoing studies at the date of cut-off.  
A total of 3655 subjects (Phases I-III studies), were evaluated for safety, including 2507 (68.6%) who 
received at least one dose of axitinib, 994 (27.2%) who received a comparator and 154 (4.2%) 
reported as “blinded therapy”. The studies included healthy volunteers (14 studies), subjects with 
hepatic impairment (1 study), subjects with haematological malignancies (1 study) and subjects with 
various solid tumours (15 completed and 10 ongoing studies).  
Of the 2507 subjects who received at least one dose of axitinib, 885 subjects (35.3%) with various 
solid tumours received axitinib as a single agent (699 subjects in completed studies; 186 subjects in 
ongoing studies), and 1059 subjects (42.2%) received axitinib as a component of combination therapy. 
Of the remaining 563 axitinib-treated subjects, 16 subjects with advanced solid tumours received 
axitinib in a dose escalation study (A4060010), 12 subjects in a haematological malignancy study 
(A4061036), 24 received axitinib in the hepatic impairment study (A4061036), and 511 were healthy 
volunteers. As of the safety cut-off date, 154 subjects were being treated in an ongoing single-agent 
pivotal phase III RCC study in treatment-naïve subjects (A4061051), for which the data are provided 
under the heading “blinded therapy”. A total of 699 subjects received single-agent axitinib in 
completed studies, including 537 (76.8%) subjects who received single-agent axitinib in the 4 
completed advanced RCC studies (pivotal phase III Study A4061032, and supportive phase II Studies 
A4061012, A4061023, and A4061035). In addition, 24 subjects received axitinib in IIR studies. 
All subjects receiving at least one dose of study medication with treatment assignments designated 
according to the actual study treatment received were included in the analysis of safety. The pooled 
safety analyses for completed single-agent studies included subjects who received a 5 mg BID starting 
doses of axitinib.  
An updated cumulative safety analysis was provided by the applicant with a cut-off date 1 February 
2011. The new analysis included safety data from 3944 subjects treated in 42 clinical trials. This 
analysis included only the information on the SAEs including deaths; no analysis of all causality AEs or 
treatment-related AEs was performed as of 01-Feb-2011.

In the pivotal study, 95.3% of the patients in the axitinib arm and 97.7% of the patients in the 
sorafenib arm) in both treatment groups reported treatment-emergent AEs; most AEs were of Grade 
1/2 severity, and AEs of Grade ≥3 were reported with lower but at similar rates for the axitinib 
(65.7%) and sorafenib (68.2%) treatment groups. Table 22 summarizes the most commonly reported

c Fatal (Grade 5) cases were reported 
d Adverse reaction is all-causality incidence 
Safety  events  of  special  interest  to  axitinib  included  hypertension,  thyroid  dysfunction,  ATEs,  VTEs, 
elevation  of  haemoglobin/haematocrit,  haemorrhage,  gastrointestinal  perforation,  wound  healing 
complications, PRES, proteinuria, hepatic effects, liver-related AEs, asthenic conditions, rash, PPES and 
diarrhoea.  
Hypertension 
Hypertension was reported in 40.4% of patients receiving axitinib and 29.0% of subjects receiving 
sorafenib. Grade 3 or greater hypertension was reported in 15.6% of subjects receiving axitinib and 
11.0% of subjects receiving sorafenib. The median onset time for hypertension (systolic blood 
pressure > 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg) was within the first month of the start 
of axitinib treatment and blood pressure increases have been observed as early as 4 days after starting 
axitinib.  
Although hypertension was one of the most commonly reported AEs in the pivotal study, hypertensive 
crisis  was  reported  in  <1%  of  patients  receiving  axitinib  and  permanent  discontinuation  of  axitinib 
treatment due to hypertension was infrequent (0.3%).  
Prior to the first dose of study drug, the use of antihypertensive medication was similar for the axitinib 
group (167 patients [46.5%]) and the sorafenib group (171 patients [48.2%]). After the first dose of 
study drug, the initiation  of a new antihypertensive medication or the increase in dose of an existing 
antihypertensive  medication  was  more  common  in  the  axitinib  group  (196 patients  [54.6%])  than  in 
the sorafenib group (141 patients [39.7%]). 
Thyroid Dysfunction 
Hypothyroidism was reported at baseline for 18.4% and 17.1% of patients in the axitinib and sorafenib 
treatment  groups,  respectively  in  the  pivotal  study;  similar  proportions  of  patients  in  each  treatment 
group were receiving thyroid medication. Hypothyroidism was reported in 19.2 % of the patients in the 
axitinib  arm  and  in  8.2  %  of  the  patients  in  the  sorafenib  arm  whereas;  the  incidence  of 
hyperthyroidism was 0.6% in axitinib group and 1.1 in the sorafenib group. There were  no events of 
Grade  5  severity  or  discontinuations  due  to  thyroid  dysfunction  in  either  treatment  group.  Increased 
TSH  was  reported  as  an  adverse  reaction  in  4.5%  of  patients  receiving  axitinib.  Among  the  patients 
who had a normal TSH level (defined as <5 µU/mL before treatment), elevations of TSH to ≥10 µU/mL 
occurred in 32.2% of patients receiving axitinib, and 10.8% of patients receiving sorafenib.

Arterial Thromboembolic Events (ATEs) 
In the pivotal study, Grade 3/4 ATEs were reported in 1.1% of patients receiving axitinib (including 3 
patients with transient ischemic attack [TIA] and 1 patient with retinal artery occlusion, all were grade 
3/4)  and  0.8%  of  patients  receiving  sorafenib  (including  2  patients  with  myocardial  infarction  and 
1 subject  with  ischemic  stroke;  2  of  these  events  were  Grade  3/4).  A  fatal  cerebrovascular  accident 
was reported in one patient (0.3%) receiving axitinib. 
In monotherapy studies of axitinib, ATEs were reported in 1.0% of patients receiving axitinib (including 
transient  ischemic  attack,  myocardial  infarction,  and  cerebrovascular  accident),  7  of  these  patients 
were patients in the completed RCC studies (7/537, 1.3%). 
Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTEs) 
In  the  pivotal  study,  venous  thromboembolic  adverse  reactions  were  reported  in  1.9%  of  patients 
receiving axitinib and 0.6% of patients receiving sorafenib. The most common VTEs in patients treated 
with  axitinib  were  pulmonary  embolism  (PE):  7  patients  (1.9%)  and  deep  vein  thrombosis  (DVT):  2 
patients (0.6%). All other VTEs were reported by 1 subject. Grade 3/4 VTEs were reported by in 1.7% 
of  patients  receiving  axitinib  (including  pulmonary  embolism,  deep  vein  thrombosis,  and  retinal  vein 
occlusion/thrombosis).  One  axitinib-treated  subject  (0.3%)  experienced  a  Grade  5  AE  (pulmonary 
embolism), three weeks after the last axitinib dose and while receiving subsequent everolimus. 
In  the  pooled  data  from  Phase  II  and  III  RCC  studies,  VTEs  were  reported  in  2.8%  of  patients  who 
received  axitinib.  Across  all  the  competed  single-agent  axitinib  (including  RCC)  studies,  3.0% 
experienced  VTEs  and  there  were  two  fatal  PEs  in  patients  who  received  axitinib,  both  pulmonary 
embolisms, and deemed not related to treatment by the investigator. 
Elevation in Haemoglobin/Haematocrit 
Polycythemia  as  an  AE  was  reported  in  0.3%  of  the  patients  receiving  axitinib  and  in  no  patients 
receiving sorafenib in the pivotal study. One of the three patients had Grade 3 polycythemia; the other 
two  patients  had  Grade  1  or  2  polycythemia,  one  of  which  was  considered  related  to  treatment.  The 
polycythemia reported in these three patients was not SAE.  
Routine laboratory assessments detected elevated haemoglobin above the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
in 9.7% of patients receiving axitinib. In four clinical studies with axitinib for the treatment of patients 
with RCC (N=537), elevated haemoglobin above ULN was observed in 13.6% receiving axitinib. 
Haemorrhage 
In  the  pivotal  study  (patients  who  had  evidence  of  untreated  brain  metastasis  or  recent  active 
gastrointestinal  bleeding  were  excluded),  haemorrhagic  events  were  reported  in  10.6%  of  patients 
receiving axitinib and 18.0% of patients receiving sorafenib. The most common haemorrhagic adverse 
reactions  in  patients  treated  with  axitinib  were  epistaxis  (5.3%),  haematuria  (1.4%),  rectal 
haemorrhage (1.1%) and gingival bleeding (1.1%).  
Most events were Grade 1 or 2. Grade 3 or 4 haemorrhagic events was reported in 0.8% of patients 
receiving  axitinib  (including  cerebral  haemorrhage,  gastric  haemorrhage  and  lower  gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage) and 3.1% of patients receiving sorafenib.  
There  was  1  Grade  5  event  (gastric  haemorrhage)  in  axitinib-treated  patients  (0.3%)  and  3  Grade  5 
events  (duodenal  ulcer  haemorrhage,  GI  haemorrhage  and  retroperitoneal  haemorrhage)  in 
sorafenib-treated patients (0.8%) in the pivotal study. The gastric haemorrhage in the axitinib group, 
and  the  GI  haemorrhage  and  retroperitoneal  haemorrhage  in  the  sorafenib  group  were  treatment 
related. 
Inlyta 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 71/92 
 
 
 
In completed RCC studies, 22.9% experienced haemorrhages. Ten patients (1.9%) experienced Grade 
3/4  haemorrhages.  In  completed  single-agent  studies,  26.0%  experienced  haemorrhages. 
Haemoptysis  was  reported  as  an  adverse  reaction  in  1.6%  of  patients,  including  one  case  (0.1%)  of 
Grade  >3  event.  In  study  A4060010,  2  patients  with  adenocarcinoma  of  the  lung  died  with 
haemoptysis; one of these deaths was considered related to axitinib. 
Gastrointestinal Perforation 
In  the  pivotal  study,  based  on  PTs,  gastrointestinal  perforation  was  reported  in  1  (0.3%)  axitinib-
treated  patient  (severity  grade  not  reported)  and  no  sorafenib-treated  patient.  There  were  3  GI 
perforations (0.6% [including the PTs GI perforation and large intestine perforation]) in the completed 
RCC studies and totally 5 GI perforations (0.7% [including the PTs GI perforation, intestinal perforation 
and large intestine perforation]) in completed single-agent studies.  
In monotherapy studies with axitinib (N=699), fistulas were reported in 0.7% of patients (all-causality 
incidence) and fatal gastrointestinal perforation was reported in one patient (0.1%). 
In  the  pancreatic  cancer  studies  (A4061016  and  A4061028),  based  on  PTs,  3  patients  treated  with 
axitinib + gemcitabine had GI perforations, two of which were considered related to treatment. 
Diarrhoea 
In  the  pivotal  study,  diarrhoea  was  reported  in  54.9%  of  patients  receiving  axitinib  and  53.2%  of 
patients receiving sorafenib. Grade 3 or greater diarrhoea was reported in 10.6% of patients receiving 
axitinib  and  7.3%  of  patients  receiving  sorafenib.  Although  diarrhoea  was  frequently  reported,  it  was 
generally  mild  to  moderate  and  did  not  lead  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  axitinib.  There  were 
somewhat  higher  incidences  of  diarrhoea  in  all  supportive  RCC  studies;  the  reported  frequencies  of 
diarrhoea  as  AE  (all-causality)  were;  for  study  A4061012:  all  grades:  63.5%;  grade  3+:  15.4%,  for 
study A4061023 all grades 61.3%; grade 3+: 14.5% and in study A4061035: all grades 67.2%; grade 
3+: 4.7%.  
Wound Healing Complications 
In  the  pivotal  study,  4  patients  (1.1%),  all  of  whom  were  treated  with  axitinib,  experienced  AEs 
involving  wounds,  1  case  was  Grade  3/4  (Wound  decomposition).  All  patients  recovered;  no  cases 
were considered serious. The frequency for all completed RCC studies pooled were 2.0% (11/537), and 
from all completed (including RCC) single-agent axitinib studies 1.9% (13/699). There were no grade 5 
wound healing complications. 
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) 
Three  (0.4%)  of  the  699  axitinib-treated  patients  experienced  PRES  in  the  completed  single-agent 
studies  (2  of  these  were  reported  in  the  completed  RCC  studies,  2/537  [0.4%];  one  in  the  pivotal 
study (0.3%), one in the supportive studies); in 2 (0.3%) of the patients the PRES was Grade 3/4. In 
the pancreatic studies, PRES was reported in 1 patient (1/372, 0.3%) in the axitinib+gemcitabine arm, 
this event was of grade 4. There were no Grade 5 events.  
Proteinuria 
In  the  pivotal  study,  10.9%  of  axitinib-treated  patients  and  7.3%  of  sorafenib-treated  patients 
reported  proteinuria  as  an  AE.  Proteinuria  of  severity  of  Grade  3  was  reported  in  3.1%  of  patients 
receiving axitinib and 1.7% of patients receiving sorafenib. There were no reports of Grade 4 or Grade 
5 proteinuria. There were no discontinuations from axitinib or sorafenib due to proteinuria as an AE in 
Study A4061032.  Based  on  urinalysis  results,  the  incidence  of  proteinuria  was  52.9%  in  patients 
receiving  axitinib  and  50.0%  for  those  receiving  sorafenib.  The  majority  of  the  urine  protein

abnormalities  were  Grade  1  or  2.  Proteinuria  as  an  AE  was  reported  for  15.3%  of  axitinib-treated 
patients in completed RCC studies. 
Hepatic Effects 
An assessment of the impact of axitinib on the liver was undertaken based on a review of nonclinical 
data and data from completed clinical trials. This evaluation consisted of a review of 1) liver function 
test abnormalities, 2) potential Hy’s Law cases identified through eDISH plot, 3) AEs possibly related to 
the  liver,  4)  subject  withdrawals  possibly  related  to  the  liver,  and  5)  deaths  possibly  related  to  the 
liver.  
The  clinical  assessment  is  based  on  2409  patients  from  all  completed  clinical  studies,  including  1838 
patients  receiving  axitinib.  In  the  dose-finding  study  A4060010,  concurrent  elevations  of  ALT  (12  x 
ULN)  and  bilirubin  (2.3  x  ULN),  considered  to  be  drug-related  hepatotoxicity  (adjudicated  to  be 
“probably”  related  to  axitinib  and  met  the  criteria  for  being  a  Hy’s  Law  case),  was  observed  in  one 
patient with colorectal cancer who received axitinib at a starting dose of 20 mg twice daily (4 times the 
recommended starting dose), for 37 days. No severe case of DILI attributable to axitinib at the starting 
dose of 5 mg BID, with selected patients receiving subsequent stepwise titrated doses to a maximum 
of  10 mg  BID,  were  revealed.  In  the  pivotal  study,  no  concurrent  elevations  of  ALT  (>3  x  ULN)  and 
bilirubin (>2 x ULN) were observed for either axitinib or sorafenib. 
There were 25 potential Hy’s Law cases (ie, in Hy’s law quadrant) in patients receiving axitinib and 1 
was adjudicated to be a true probable Hy’s law case (discussed above). The majority of potential Hy’s 
law cases came from pancreatic studies and none from the pivotal study. 
Liver-related Adverse Events 
In the pivotal study there were 24 patients (6.7%) with a total of 31 liver-related AEs (all Grades) in 
the axitinib-treatment. The most frequent AEs (>1%) were ALT increased, AST increased, ascites, and 
hyperbilirubinemia. Most AEs were Grades 1/2. There were 6 patients (1.7%) with 7 Grades 3/4 AEs. 
There were no  Grade 5 liver-related AEs.  In addition, there were  no liver-related SAEs in the axitinib 
arm and 6 in the sorafenib arm. All six required hospitalization. Of the 178 patients with advanced RCC 
in  the  3  Phase  II  RCC  supportive  studies  there  were  4  potential  liver-related  SAEs;  2  cases  of 
hepatorenal  syndrome,  1  case  of  hyperbilirubinemia,  and  1  case  of  jaundice.  All  cases  required 
hospitalization. The 2 hepatorenal syndrome events were associated with fatal outcomes; the other 2 
events had not resolved at the time of the report. Hepatorenal syndrome for 1 subject was listed as an 
SAE  with  a  fatal  outcome  on  the  safety  database;  however,  this  AE  was  not  listed  on  the  clinical 
database. 
In  completed  RCC-studies,  liver-related  AEs  were  observed  in  59/537  patients  (11.0%).  The  most 
frequent  AEs  (>1%)  were  ALT  increased,  AST  increased,  hyperbilirubinemia,  and  ascites.  Most  AEs 
were  mild  (Grade  1/2).  There  were  13  patients  (2.4%)  with  17  Grades  3/4  AEs  and  1  subject  with 
hepatorenal  syndrome  associated  with  a  fatal  outcome.  In  addition,  hepatorenal  syndrome  for  1 
subject was listed as an SAE with a fatal outcome on the safety database. 
Asthenic Conditions 
Asthenic conditions were reported in 57.1% of patients in the axitinib group and in 46.2% of patients 
in  the  sorafenib  group  in  the  pivotal  study,  but  did  not  lead  to  discontinuation  from  treatment. 
Asthenia  and  fatigue  were  reported  in  20.6%  and  39.0  %  of  patients  in  the  axitinib  group  and  in 
14.1%  and  31.5  %  of  patients  in  the  sorafenib  group  respectively.  One  Grade  5  event,  asthenia, 
occurred in the pivotal study and one Grade 5 event (asthenia) in the axitinib+gemcitabine group in a 
study in pancreatic cancer patients, both events were considered related to treatment.

Rash 
Events coding to epidermal and dermal conditions were reported in 60.3% of patients in the sorafenib 
arm and 33.4% of patients in the axitinib arm in the pivotal study. There were more Grade 3/4 events 
in  sorafenib-treated patients  (8.5%)  than  in  axitinib-treated  patients  (1.4%).  There  were  no  Grade  5 
events  in  either  treatment  group.  The  most  common  events  (all-causality)  were  rash,  dry  skin,  and 
pruritus in both treatment groups. 
In completed RCC studies, 197/537 (36.7%) and in completed single-agent studies, 267/699 (38.2%) 
reported events (all-causality) coding to epidermal and dermal conditions. The majority of the events 
were Grade 1 or 2. The most common events (all-causality) in the completed single-agent studies were 
rash (14.4%), dry skin (12.2%), pruritus (6.3%), erythema (4.0%), and skin exfoliation (2.4%). 
Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES, or hand-foot syndrome) 
The incidence of PPES was 51.0% in sorafenib-treated patients and 27.3% in axitinib-treated patients 
in  the  pivotal  study.  The  majority  of  the  cases  in  axitinib-treated  patients  were  Grade  1  or  2.  There 
was  more  Grade  3  or  greater  PPES  in  sorafenib-treated  patients  (16.1%)  than  in  axitinib-treated 
patients (5.0%). Only few discontinued treatment due to this AE (1 on axitinib, 4 on sorafenib). 
The incidence of PPES varied widely across the completed RCC studies from 5.8% in study A4061012 
to  75.0%  in  study  A4061035.  The  incidences  in  studies  A4061032  (27.3%)  and  A4061023  (35.5%) 
were  intermediate.  PPES  was  reported  by  28.9%  of  axitinib-treated  subjects  in  the  completed 
single-agent studies. The majority were Grade 1 or 2. Grade 3 PPES was reported for 6.6% of subjects.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Based  on  the  results  from  the  update  safety  analysis  (cut-off  date  01  February  2011)  there  were  61 
deaths  in  the  pivotal  RCC  study;  36  (10%) in  the  axitinib  arm  and  25  (7%) in  the  sorafenib  arm.  Of 
these fatal outcomes, 5 cases in each arm were considered due to study drug and 2 cases of subjects 
who died of unknown causes (one in each arm). In one of the supportive studies in RCC there was one 
additional fatal event which was not considered related to treatment. 
All fatal SAEs that occurred with axitinib or sorafenib treatment are summarized in table 25.

As  shown  in  Table  26,  the  most  common  SAEs  (all-causality)  in  both  treatment  arms  were  disease 
progression,  and  metastatic  RCC.  The  SAEs  that  were  reported  during  the  safety  update  follow-up 
period  and  now  meet  criteria  (≥4  events  each)  for  inclusion  include  vomiting,  pneumothorax, 
myocardial  infarction,  gastrointestinal  (GI)  hemorrhage,  and  lower  respiratory  tract  infection.  More 
common  (≥2  fold)  events  included  dehydration,  pulmonary  embolism,  vomiting,  pneumothorax, 
infection,  and  fatigue  in  the  axitinib  arm,  and  pain,  general  physical  health  deterioration,  myocardial 
infarction, GI hemorrhage, hypotension, anaemia, and lower respiratory tract infection in the sorafenib 
arm. 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory findings revealed that 52.5% of patients in the sorafenib arm had haemoglobin decreases 
(and  anaemia  reported  as  AE)  and  34.9%  of  patients  in  the  axitinib  arm  whereas  elevated 
haemoglobin above the ULN was reported in 8.6% of patients in the axitinib arm and only in 0.8% of 
patients in the sorafenib arm. Furthermore, creatinine increased (55.1%) and hypercalcaemia (30.1%) 
were  more  common  in  the  axitinib  arm  whereas  hypophosphataemia  (49.5%),  lipase  increased 
(46.0%), amylase increased (32.6%) and hypocalcaemia (28.0%) were more frequent in the sorafenib 
arm. Very similar changes in the liver function tests were observed.  
In general, most laboratory abnormalities were mild in severity apart from grade 3/4 lipase increased 
that occurred in 14.6% of patients in both treatment arms and grade 3/4 hypophosphataemia that was 
reported in 16.2% of sorafenib-treated patients. Proteinuria was very commonly reported in 52.9% of 
patients in the axitinib arm and in 50.0% of patients in the sorafenib arm. 
The results of the updated analysis (cut-off date 1 February 2011) was overall very similar to previous 
findings. The majority of the laboratory test abnormalities were Grade 1 or 2. 
ECGs 
Based  on  the  evaluation  of  ECG  recordings  in  152  patients  in  completed  single  agent  studies,  4 
patients  (all  from  the  pivotal  study)  had  a  postbaseline  absolute  value  >500  msec  and/or  a  change 
from  baseline  >60  msec.  In  all  4  patients,  confounding  factors  were  present  and  3  out  of  4  patients 
Inlyta 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 75/92 
 
 
 
 
had abnormal ECGs at baseline. None of these patients had clinically relevant symptoms. The applicant 
has  also  reviewed  all  AEs  that  potentially  could  be  associated  with  effects  on  the  QTc  interval  in  the 
completed  single  agent  studies.  There  were  no  reports  of  sudden  deaths,  ventricular  arrhythmia  or 
Torsade de pointes. In addition, in study A4061004 (in healthy volunteers) the largest axitinib-related 
mean,  placebo-corrected  time-matched  change  for  axitinib  with  Bazett’s  correction  [QTcB])  was  4.4 
msec  (90%  CI;  1.9,  6.9)  which  is  lower  than  the  level  of  regulatory  concern.  Similarly,  the  PK-PD 
analysis from the same study did not find a correlation between QTc prolongation and axitinib plasma 
concentration. 
Safety in special populations 
In the pivotal study, 34% of patients treated with axitinib were ≥65 years of age. The majority of 
patients were White (77%) or Asian (24%).  
In the axitinib group, 93.6% of subjects <65 years and 98.4% of subjects ≥65 years experienced AEs 
(all-causality).  Higher incidences of diarrhoea (64.2% vs. 50.0%), fatigue (47.2% vs. 34.7%), weight 
decreased  (30.1%  vs.  22.0%),  dysphonia  (36.6%  vs  28.0%),  and  decreased  appetite  (43.9%  vs. 
29.2%)  were  observed  in  axitinib-treated  subjects  ≥65  years  compared  with  subjects  <65 years. 
Hypertension was more frequently reported in subjects <65 years than in subjects ≥65 years (44.9% 
vs 31.7%). 
Grade 3 or greater AEs were more frequent in axitinib-treated subjects ≥65 years. Grade 3 or greater 
asthenia (9.8% vs 3.0%) and decreased appetite (7.3% vs 3.8%) were more frequent in the older age 
group.  Based  on  the  centralized  AEM  database,  the  incidence  of  SAEs  (all-causality)  was  higher  for 
axitinib-treated subjects ≥65 years (36.6% [45/123]) than  for subjects <65 years (25.8% [61/236]). 
The  incidence  of  discontinuation  due  to  AEs  was  higher  in  subjects  ≥65  years  than  in  subjects  <65 
years.  
The  majority  of  patients  in  the  pivotal  study  were  White  (77%)  or  Asian  (24%).  The  incidence  of 
treatment-related  grade  >3  AEs  was  59.7 %  in  Asians  vs.  45.7  %  in  Caucasians.  The  incidence  of 
treatment-related SAEs was 15.6 % in Asians vs. 9.8 % in White patients. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The  results  form  the  drug-drug  interactions  study  were  submitted  and  discussed  under  Clinical 
Pharmacology  section.  No  deaths,  serious  adverse  events  or  adverse  events  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation were reported in these studies. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In  the  pivotal  study,  9.2%  of  patients  in  the  axitinib  arm  and  13%  of  patients  in  the  sorafenib  arm 
discontinued treatment permanently due to adverse events. 
According  to  the  updated  analysis  (cut-off  date  1  February  2011)  treatment-related  AEs  led  to 
discontinuations  in  4.7%  of  axitinib-treated  patients  compared  to  9.3%  in  the  sorafenib  arm.  These 
numbers and the most common events that led to discontinuations are in line with previous findings.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The applicant has given a detailed overview of the study populations included in the safety evaluation. 
The  methods  used  in  the  safety  evaluation  are  considered  adequate.  Overall,  the  size  of  the  safety 
database is considered as satisfactory  
Almost  all  subjects  (95.3%  of  the  patients  in  the  axitinib  arm  and  97.7%  of  the  patients  in  the 
sorafenib  arm)  in  the  pivotal  RCC  study  experienced  at  least  one  adverse  event  during  the  study 
period.  The  most  common  AEs  reported  in  the  axitinib  group  (in  ≥20%  subjects)  were  diarrhoea, 
hypertension, fatigue, dysphonia, nausea, decreased appetite, and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia 
(hand-foot) syndrome. Most of these events occurred with Grade 1 or 2 severities. 
The  incidences  of  many  of  the  most  common  AEs  were  higher  in  axitinib-treated  subjects  who  had 
received  prior  sunitinib  than  in  axitinib-treated  subjects  who  had  received  prior  cytokines,  whereas 
especially the frequency of hypertension was higher for both groups who had received prior cytokines 
than for those who had received prior sunitinib.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
The  most  important  serious  adverse  reactions  reported  in  patients  receiving  axitinib  were  arterial 
thromboembolic  events  (1.1%),  venous  thromboembolic  events  (1.9%),  haemorrhage  (10.6% 
[including  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage,  cerebral  haemorrhage  and  haemoptysis]),  gastrointestinal 
perforation  and  fistula  formation  (0.3%),  hypertensive  crisis  (<1%),  and  posterior  reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome (0.4%).  
In  total,  36  deaths  occurred  in  the  axitinib  arm  vs.  25  in  the  sorafenib  arm.  The  majority  of  these 
events were due to progressive disease (27 and 17 in the two arms, respectively). Five events in each 
arm  were  considered  treatment-related.  This  is  one  additional  event  in  both  arms  compared  to  the 
previous analysis. There is no indication that axitinib promotes disease progression/the development of 
new lesions. 
Other safety events of special interest and concern with regard to axitinib include hypertension, thyroid 
dysfunction,  ATEs,  VTEs,  elevation  of  haemoglobin/haematocrit,  haemorrhage,  gastrointestinal 
perforation, wound healing complications, PRES, proteinuria, hepatic effects, asthenic conditions, rash 
and PPES.   
Axitinib affects the incidence of hypertension and thyroid dysfunction, and sometimes aggravates these 
conditions if pre-existing, however, these AEs are largely manageable. Both blood pressure and thyroid 
function should be monitored before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with axitinib. 
Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC include this information. 
Axitinib should be used with caution  in patients who are at risk for, or who have a history of ATEs and 
VTEs.  
Increases  in  haemoglobin  or  haematocrit,  reflective  of  increases  in  red  blood  cell  mass,  may  occur 
during  treatment  with  axitinib.  An  increase  in  red  blood  cell  mass  may  increase  the  risk  of 
thromboembolic  events.  Haemoglobin  or  haematocrit  should  be  monitored  before  initiation  of,  and 
periodically  throughout,  treatment  with  axitinib.  If  haemoglobin  or  haematocrit  becomes  elevated 
above the normal level, patients should be treated according to standard medical practice to decrease 
haemoglobin or haematocrit to an acceptable level.  
Symptoms  of  gastrointestinal  perforation  or  fistula  should  be  periodically  monitored  for  throughout 
treatment with axitinib.  
Inlyta 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 77/92 
 
 
 
Monitoring  for  proteinuria  before  initiation  of,  and  periodically  throughout,  treatment  with  axitinib  is 
recommended.  For  patients  who  develop  moderate  to  severe  proteinuria,  reduce  the  dose  or 
temporarily interrupt axitinib treatment.  
Liver  function  tests  should  be  monitored  before  initiation  of,  and  periodically  throughout,  treatment 
with axitinib. 
PRES  is  a  neurological  disorder  which  can  present  with  headache,  seizure,  lethargy,  confusion, 
blindness and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. In 
patients  with  signs  or  symptoms  of  PRES,  temporarily  interrupt  or  permanently  discontinue  axitinib 
treatment.  The  safety  of  reinitiating  axitinib  therapy  in  patients  previously  experiencing  PRES  is  not 
known. 
Asthenia  and  fatigue  were  frequently  reported  in  axitinib-treated  subjects  (20.6%  and  39.0%, 
respectively), and fatigue was the only grade 3 or greater AE that was reported more frequently (≥5% 
difference) in the axitinib treatment group than in the sorafenib treatment group. The incidence of skin 
reactions  including  epidermal  and  dermal  conditions,  and  PPES  was  lower  in  the  axitinib-treated 
subjects than in sorafenib-treated subjects.  
There does not seem to be any clear signals of a clinically meaningful prolongation of the QT interval 
observed  with  axitinib,  however,  two  patients  had  grade  ≥3  QTc  prolongation  (absolute  QTc  >500 
msec) at Cycle 1 day 15, and two additional patients had on-treatment increase in QTc greater than 60 
msec  in  the  pivotal  study.  Therefore  QTc  prolongation  has  been  identified  as  an  important  potential 
risk.  However  in  order  to  get  most  optimal  information  about  new  suspected  cases,  the  applicant 
should  include  enhanced  pharmacovigilance  activities  with  use  of  a  questionnaire  to  systematically 
collect follow-up data of ICSRs that can be associated with QT prolongation. 
Axitinib has not been studied in patients who have evidence of untreated brain metastasis or recent 
active gastrointestinal bleeding, and should not be used in those patients. If any bleeding requires 
medical intervention, temporarily interrupt the axitinib dose. Inlyta is contraindicated in patients with 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Axitinib should not be used during 
pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with this medicinal product. 
Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 1 week after 
treatment. It is unknown whether axitinib is excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot 
be excluded. Axitinib should not be used during breast-feeding.    
Since  Inlyta  contains  lactose  patients  with  rare  hereditary  problems  of  galactose  intolerance,  Lapp 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take it. 
There is no specific treatment for axitinib overdose.  In a controlled clinical study with axitinib for the 
treatment  of  patients  with  RCC,  one  patient  inadvertently  received  a  dose  of  20 mg  twice  daily  for  4 
days  and  experienced  dizziness  (Grade 1).  In  a  clinical  dose  finding  study  with  axitinib,  subjects  who 
received starting doses of 10 mg twice daily or 20 mg twice daily experienced adverse reactions which 
included  hypertension,  seizures  associated  with  hypertension,  and  fatal  haemoptysis.  In  cases  of 
suspected overdose, axitinib should be withheld and supportive care instituted. 
No  studies  on  the  effects  on  the  ability  to  drive  and  use  machines  have  been  performed.  Patients 
should be advised that they may experience events such as dizziness and/or fatigue during treatment 
with axitinib. 
There  are  some  differences  in  safety  parameters  based  on  age,  race,  gender  or  region.  Since  the 
axitinib dose is individually titrated as clinically indicated (ie. according to safety and tolerability), none 
of  these  differences  in  itself  leads  to  a  recommendation  of  a  definitive  dose  reduction.  The  applicant 
has updated the SmPC with regards to observed differences of certain AEs and race/genetics.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  of  axitinib  is  consistent  with  the  expected  profile  for  a  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor 
selectively  targets  the  VEGFR-1,  VEGFR-2  and  VEGFR-3  signalling.  Severe,  serious  and  even  fatal 
events  occur,  but  the  incidences  are  low.  Most  common  AEs  are  well-known  and  largely  manageable 
with  dose  reductions  and  temporary  interruptions.  Despite  dosage  optimisation  based  on  tolerability, 
the majority of adverse events were mild or modest in severity and relatively few patients discontinued 
therapy due to AEs. There does not seem to be more AEs in subjects treated with axitinib compared to 
sorafenib, although the incidences of the individual AEs differ. Compared to sorafenib, treatment with 
axitinib  was  associated  with  some  distinct  features  (more  hypertension,  but  less  skin  toxicity,  less 
hand-foot syndrome, less anaemia, less alopecia).  
Overall, axitinib seems to be acceptably tolerated as monotherapy in patients with advanced RCC that 
have failed prior cytokine and sunitinib therapy.

studied in patients receiving strong CYP3A4/5 
inhibitors, if a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor must 
be co-administered, a dose decrease of axitinib 
to approximately half the dose (e.g., from a 
starting dose of 5 mg twice daily to a reduced 
dose of 2 mg twice daily) is recommended.  
Management of some adverse reactions may 
require temporary or permanent discontinuation 
of axitinib therapy.  If co-administration of the 
strong inhibitor is discontinued, a return to the 
axitinib dose used prior to initiation of the 
strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor should be 
considered.”

See SmPC, Section 4.5.  “In vitro studies 
indicated that axitinib has a potential to inhibit 
CYP1A2.  Therefore, co-administration of 
axitinib with CYP1A2 substrates may result in 
increased plasma concentrations of CYP1A2 
substrates (e.g. theophylline).  
In vitro studies also indicated that axitinib has 
the potential to inhibit CYP2C8.  However, co-
administration of axitinib with paclitaxel, a 
known CYP2C8 substrate, did not result in 
increased plasma concentrations of paclitaxel in

In vitro studies indicated that axitinib inhibits P-
glycoprotein.  However, axitinib is not expected 
to inhibit P-glycoprotein at therapeutic plasma 
concentrations.  Therefore, co-administration of 
axitinib is not expected to increase the plasma 
concentration of digoxin, or other P-glycoprotein 
substrates, in vivo.”

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The applicant submitted one pivotal trial in support of the efficacy of axitinib in patients with advanced 
RCC after failure of treatment with one prior systemic therapy including sunitinib, bevacizumab + IFN-
α, temsirolimus, or cytokine(s), or combination of these. 
In the overall population of the pivotal phase III study a median PFS of 6.8 months for the axitinib 
group and 4.7 months for the sorafenib group has been observed. Median PFS in the subgroup of 
patients previously treated with cytokines as 1st line therapy was 12.0 months for axitinib and 6.6 
months for sorafenib (HR=0.519; 95% CI: 0.375, 0.720; p <0.0001). In patients previously treated 
with sunitinib median PFS for axitinib was 4.8 months vs. 3.4 months for sorafenib (HR =0.736; 95% 
CI: 0.578, 0.937; p=0.0063). 
This effect was further substantiated by results in the secondary efficacy endpoints: A positive trend 
for OS was observed in the prior-cytokine group (HR= 0.813; 95% CI: 0.555, 1.191; p=0.1435,) with 
median OS of 29.4 months in the axitinib arm and 27.8 months in the sorafenib arm. The analysis of 
ORR showed a statistically significant improvement of 13.9% for axitinib compared to sorafenib in 
patients pre-treated with cytokines (HR=2.392; 95% CI: 1.434, 3.993; p=0.0002). In the prior-
sunitinib group, the difference in ORR between axitinib and sorafenib was 3.6% (HR=1.477; 95% CI: 
0.792, 2.754; p=0.1085).  
Duration of response and patient reported outcomes were only analysed for the overall study 
population. There were no differences in these endpoints between the axitinib and sorafenib study 
arms.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The  group  of  patients  previously  treated  with  temsirolimus  and  bevacizumab+IFN-α  are  very  small 
(n=25 and n=59, respectively), and therefore no firm conclusions can be made regarding the efficacy 
in these subgroups. Therefore the indication has been restricted to the patients previously treated with 
sunitinib or cytokine. 
Based on the analysis of OS in the pivotal study there is no indication of any survival benefit of axitinib 
over sorafenib in the prior sunitinib group (HR=0.997).  
Risks 
The most common AEs reported in the axitinib group (in ≥20% subjects) were diarrhoea, hypertension, 
fatigue,  dysphonia,  nausea,  decreased  appetite,  and  palmar-plantar  erythrodysaesthesia  (hand-foot) 
syndrome. Most of these events occurred with Grade 1 or 2 severities.  
The  most  common  (>3%)  severe  events  (grade  3-5  events  pooled)  in  the  axitinib  arm  were 
hypertension (15.6%), diarrhoea (10%), fatigue (9.7%), palmar-plantar erythrodysaestesia syndrome 
(5.0%), asthenia (4.2%), decreased appetite (3.6%) and proteinuria (3.1%). In comparison, the most 
common  severe  events  in  the  sorafenib  arm  were  palmar-plantar  erythrodysaestesia  syndrome 
(16.1%), hypertension (11.0%), diarrhoea (7.0%), fatigue (3.7%), rash (3.7%) and lipase increased 
(3.1%).  
Inlyta 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 86/92 
 
 
 
Axitinib  affects  the  incidence  of  hypertension  and  of  thyroid  dysfunction,  and  sometimes  aggravates 
these conditions if pre-existing. The hypertension reported during the study  was largely manageable, 
but hypertension is still considered an unfavourable effect of axitinib. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  axitinib  is  consistent  with  the  expected  profile  for  a  tyrosine  kinase 
inhibitor selectively targets the VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 signalling.  
There does not seem to be any clear signals of a clinically meaningful prolongation of the QT interval 
observed  with  axitinib,  however,  two  patients  had  grade  ≥3  QTc  prolongation  (absolute  QTc  >500 
msec) at Cycle 1 day 15, and two additional patients had on-treatment increase in QTc greater than 60 
msec  in  the  pivotal  study.  Therefore  QTc  prolongation  has  been  identified  as  an  important  potential 
risk. However in order to get most optimal information about new suspected cases, the applicant will 
include  enhanced  pharmacovigilance  activities  with  use  of  a  questionnaire  to  systematically  collect 
follow-up data of ICSRs that can be associated with QT prolongation. 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Treatment  with  axitinib  showed  an  improvement  in  the  median  progression  free  survival.  Results  in 
ORR supported the observed improvement in PFS. Axitinib showed a clear antitumour effect in patients 
with advanced RCC that have failed prior cytokine and sunitinib therapy.  The results are considered to 
be mature, robust and of clinical relevance.  
Based  on  the  safety  data  from  the  submitted  studies,  axitinib  seems  to  be  acceptably  tolerated  as 
monotherapy in patients with advanced RCC. There does not seem to be more AEs in subjects treated 
with  axitinib  compared  to  sorafenib,  although  the  incidences  of  some  of  the  individual  AEs  varies 
between the two treatment arms. The majority of adverse events were mild or modest in severity and 
relatively few patients discontinued therapy due to AEs.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall, the efficacy of axitinib has been demonstrated. The adverse event profile of axitinib in second-
line therapy of mRCC seems acceptable and generally manageable. The benefit-risk balance for axitinib 
for the treatment of adult patients, with advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of prior treatment 
with sunitinib or a cytokine, is considered positive. The favourable effects outweigh the negative effects 
of Inlyta. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The  indication  has  been  restricted  to  the  patients  previously  treated  with  sunitinib  or  cytokine.  The 
group of patients previously treated with temsirolimus and bevacizumab+IFN-α are very small (n=25 
and  n=59,  respectively)  and  no  firm  conclusions  can  be  made  regarding  the  efficacy  in  these 
subgroups. 
In  the  opinion  of  the  divergent  CHMP  members  the  benefit-risk  balance  in  the  subpopulation  of 
patients previously treated with sunitinib is considered negative.

4. Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Inlyta is not similar to Nexavar and Torisel within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Inlyta in the treatment of adult patients, with advanced renal 
cell carcinoma after failure of prior treatment with sunitinib or a cytokine, is favourable and therefore 
recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation under subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription  
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation

The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, presented in Module 1.8.1 of the 
marketing authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market. 
The MAH shall perform the pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as 
agreed in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation 
and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP. 
As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the 
updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR). 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, 
Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities 
•  Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached

DIVERGENT POSITION EXPRESSED BY CHMP MEMBERS 
A  clinically  relevant  effect  of  axitinib  has  convincingly  been  demonstrated  in  the  patients  previously 
treated  with  cytokines.  Uncertainty  about  the  effects  of  axitinib  specifically  concerns  its  use  in  the 
subgroup of patients previously treated with sunitinib and are related to the issues described below. 
The  magnitude  of  the  PFS  benefit  for  axitinib  over  sorafenib  is  uncertain  since  the  PFS  estimate  for 
sorafenib in the pivotal study lacks external validation from a registrational phase III study. At present, 
everolimus is the only drug approved for use in a second line treatment of mRCC after prior sunitinib.  
Sorafenib is only approved for use after prior cytokines in this setting. The lack of external validation of 
the effect of the comparator on PFS in the AXIS study is of particular importance since median PFS of 
axitinib in the prior sunitinib group is rather modest and the analysis of OS in the pivotal study gave no 
indication of any survival benefit of axitinib over sorafenib in this subgroup (HR=0.997). 
In terms of effect on PFS axitinib is much less active in the prior sunitinib group than in patients who 
have received cytokines as part of their first-line treatment. This finding could indicate cross-resistance 
mechanisms that reduce the potential clinical activity of axitinib when used after sunitinib. An analysis 
of  the  relationship  between  time  to  progression  on  first  line  sunitinib  and  PFS  on  axitinib  did  not 
exclude  the  possibility  that  resistance  to  TKIs  develop  on  or  after  first-line  therapy  with  sunitinib, 
resulting in reduced activity of the second-line TKI. It is acknowledged that mechanisms of resistance 
to  VEGF-targeted  therapy  in  patients  with  advanced  RCC  are  still  to  be  fully  elucidated,  but  it  is  not 
considered  that  the  applicant  has  addressed  the  issue  of  resistance  adequately.  At  present,  multiple 
agents  for  mRCC  with  overlapping  mechanisms  of  action  are  being  developed  concurrently,  but  the 
rationale  for  selection  of  a  second  TKI  is  weak,  and  whether  to  select  an  mTOR  instead  of  a  TKI  in 
second line treatment of RCC has not been thoroughly addressed.  
The  uncertainty  of  the  therapeutic  value  of  axitinib  after  failure  of  first  line  sunitinib  is  further 
strengthened by the lack of a clear rationale for preferring TKIs instead of the approved mTOR inhibitor 
(everolimus) for second line mRCC therapy.  
Axitinib is less effective in terms of PFS and OS when used as second-line therapy after prior sunitinib 
than when used after first-line treatment with cytokines.  In first line therapy of mRCC, however, TKI 
therapy (sunitinib) is much more effective (PFS and OS) than therapy with cytokines. Apparently, the 
treatment potential of TKI therapy is released during first-line therapy, and little gain of this therapy is 
achieved if repeated in second-line. Overall, the additional analyses of OS of patients in the pivotal trial 
examined from the start of first-line treatment with  either sunitinib or cytokines to the time of death 
on or following second-line treatment with axitinib or sorafenib further contributes to the uncertainty of 
whether  sequential  therapy  with  axitinib  after  prior  sunitinib  is  beneficial  for  patients  with  metastatic 
RCC. 
Therefore, in the opinion of the divergent CHMP members the benefit-risk balance in the subpopulation 
of patients previously treated with sunitinib is considered negative.

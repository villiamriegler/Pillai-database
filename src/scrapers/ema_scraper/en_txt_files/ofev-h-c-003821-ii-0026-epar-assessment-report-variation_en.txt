2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition/clinical presentation 
Systemic sclerosis presents with diverse organ manifestations. The disease follows a variable and 
unpredictable course, but organ manifestations tend to become evident in the early stages of disease. In 
a study of patients with early SSc in the EUSTAR cohort, skin sclerosis, gastrointestinal, and pulmonary 
involvement were the earliest organ manifestations to appear and were evident in the majority of patients 
one year after the onset of Raynaud’s phenomenon (which is the first symptom of SSc in most patients). 
Estimates of the prevalence of ILD in patients with SSc vary widely (from ~20% to ~65%), depending on 
the criteria used to define ILD. Although the clinical course of SSc-ILD is unpredictable in an individual 
patient, disease progression occurs predominantly in the first years after diagnosis. Currently, pulmonary 
fibrosis is the leading cause of death in patients with SSc.  
Median survival is 5 to 8 years in SSc-associated ILD. Skin involvement is observed in the majority of 
patients with SSc and is one of the earliest disease manifestations. Although skin thickness tends to 
worsen in early SSc and improve in later stages of the disease, worsening/improvement of skin fibrosis is 
unpredictable for an individual patient. In patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc, a high mRSS score is 
associated with mortality. 
The following indication was submitted by the MAH: Ofev is indicated in adults for the treatment of 
Systemic Sclerosis associated Interstitial Lung Disease (SSc-ILD). 
The same posology as approved for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) was proposed by the MAH for this 
indication.  
Management 
There are no approved treatments which can modify or prevent systemic progression of SSc-ILD and 
allow long term treatment in this chronic disease. Non-approved treatments with immunosuppresants, 
such as cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate, have shown only modest benefits, while carrying serious 
risks and tolerability issues that limit their use and, in case of cyclophosphamide, preclude chronic use. 
The EULAR treatment guideline recommends that cyclophosphamide be considered for the treatment of 
SSc-ILD, in particular for patients with progressive ILD. In the randomised, placebo-controlled 
Scleroderma Lung Study I, cyclophosphamide showed a significant but modest benefit in FVC% predicted 
at 1 year. The mean change from baseline in FVC at Week 48 was -1.0% predicted in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020 
Page 8/119 
 
  
  
 
cyclophosphamide group and -2.6% predicted in the placebo group. However, the use of and the duration 
of treatment with cyclophosphamide are limited due to its toxicity, which manifests in, among others, 
myelosuppression and increased cancer risk. 
Although no recommendation is given in the guideline, in some regions, mycophenolate is used frequently 
on an empirical basis for the treatment of SSc-ILD. 
The EULAR guideline recommends methotrexate to be considered for the treatment of skin manifestations 
of early diffuse cutaneous SSc. 
The EULAR guideline recommends that haematopoietic stem cell transplant be considered for a small 
selected subgroup of patients with rapidly progressive SSc at risk of organ failure.  
Other immunosuppressive drugs, such as azathioprine, rituximab, or cyclosporine A may be used in 
individual cases, although there are no placebo-controlled studies to corroborate their efficacy. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor including the receptors platelet-
derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) α and β, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1-3, and VEGFR 
1-3. Nintedanib binds competitively to the ATP binding pocket of these receptors and blocks the 
intracellular signalling. In addition, nintedanib inhibits Flt-3 (Fms-like tyrosine-protein kinase), Lck 
(lymphocyte-specific tyrosine-protein kinase), Lyn (tyrosine-protein kinase lyn) and Src (proto-oncogene 
tyrosine-protein kinase src) kinases. 
Nintedanib inhibits the activation of FGFR and PDGFR signalling cascades which are critically involved in 
proliferation, migration and differentiation of lung fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, the hallmark cells in the 
pathology of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The potential impact of VEGFR inhibition by nintedanib and the 
anti-angiogenic activity of nintedanib on IPF pathology are currently not fully elucidated. In preclinical 
disease models of lung fibrosis nintedanib exerts potent anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory activity. 
Nintedanib inhibits proliferation, migration and fibroblast to myofibroblast transformation of human lung 
fibroblasts from patients with IPF. 
Nintedanib is licenced as Ofev for the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). The recommended 
dose is 150 mg nintedanib twice daily administered approximately 12 hours apart. The 100 mg twice daily 
dose is only recommended to be used in patients who do not tolerate the 150 mg twice daily dose. 
Nintedanib is also licenced as Vargatef and is indicated in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of 
adult patients with locally advanced, metastatic or locally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of 
adenocarcinoma tumour histology after first-line chemotherapy. The recommended dose of nintedanib is 
200 mg twice daily administered approximately 12 hours apart, on days 2 to 21 of a standard 21 day 
docetaxel treatment cycle.

used oral contraceptive combination. 
•  Acceptability  of  the  design  of  a  single  pivotal,  prospective,  randomised  (1:1),  parallel  group, 
placebo  controlled,  double  blind  52  week  clinical  trial,  investigating  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
nintedanib  at  a  dose  of  150  mg  bid,  in  400  patients  with  SSc-ILD,  including  the  selected  study 
population - based upon classification according to the ACR/EULAR 2013 guideline and Chest HRCT 
diagnosis,  with  DLCO  30%-  89%  predicted  and  FVC  45%  -  85%  predicted;  primary  endpoint 
(annual rate of decline in FVC (percent predicted) over 52 weeks) and secondary endpoints (key - 
absolute change from baseline in the modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) at Week 52); a dosing 
regimen  extrapolated  from  the  IPF  indication;  placebo  control;    sample  size  estimation  and 
statistical  analyses;  proposed  restrictions  and  allowances  regarding  concomitant  medications, 
including the proposed rescue treatment rules; safety database including supportive safety data for 
nintedanib in IPF and NSCLC programs. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
In this application, the applicant submitted primary pharmacodynamic studies to support the proposed 
new indication. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
In-vitro 
Nintedanib was shown to exhibit effects in a number of in-vitro models related to the proposed SSc and 
SSC-ILD indication. These include: concentration-dependent inhibition of pro-fibrotic mediator release 
from peripheral blood monocytic cells and from T cells in-vitro; Concentration-dependent reduced mRNA 
expression of Col1a1, Col1a2, fibronectin and αSMA, collagen protein, stress fiber formation and pSmad 
2/3 in dermal fibroblasts from patients with systemic sclerosis or control donors under basal conditions or 
if stimulated with TGFβ or PDGF; concentration-dependent reduced proliferation and migration in dermal 
fibroblasts from patients with systemic sclerosis or control donors stimulated with TGFβ or PDGF; 
concentration-dependent reduced proliferation, migration and contraction of lung fibroblasts from patients 
with systemic sclerosis. 
In-vivo 
Several studies were conducted in animal models of systemic and pulmonary fibrosis (see summary table 
below): 
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020 
Page 10/119 
 
  
  
 
 
Table 1 Mouse models of systemic sclerosis 
In four animal models of systemic sclerosis (bleomycin induced skin fibrosis in mice, graft versus host 
disease-induced skin fibrosis in mice, tight skin mouse and Fra-2 mouse), nintedanib reduced skin 
myofibroblast count, dermal thickness and hydroxyproline content in a dose-dependent manner. In the 
Fra-2 mouse which resembles aspects of skin and lung fibrosis including microvascular disease and 
pulmonary hypertension in addition to the effects on the skin previously noted, nintedanib administration 
dose dependently decreased sirius red staining, myofibroblast count and hydroxyproline content in lung 
tissue and an attenuation of proliferation of pulmonary smooth muscle cell and apoptosis of dermal 
microvascular endothelial cells were also noted. Following a preventative treatment regimen 
(administration from first CCl4 administration) in a CCL4 induced liver fibrosis mouse model, nintedanib 
administration was associated with a significant reduction in necrosis, inflammation and fibrosis as 
assessed by the semi-quantitative histological scoring. Following a therapeutic treatment regimen 
(administration starting on either day 7 or 14 post first CCl4 dose), nintedanib administration was 
associated with an attenuation in increased liver weight and ALT. Nintedanib treatment starting at day 7 
significantly reduced liver necrosis, inflammation and fibrosis as assessed by the semi-quantitative 
histological scoring. 
2.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has not submitted any additional ERA studies/data with this application. Justification was 
provided on the basis that the effects on the environment by adding the proposed indication are 
considered negligible and well covered by the Fpen used. The CHMP agreed that the ERA submitted with 
the initial MAA remains valid for the current type II variation covering the proposed additional indication 
in patients with systemic sclerosis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020 
Page 11/119 
 
  
  
 
 
2.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The submitted pharmacology studies are acceptable and sufficient to support additional clinical 
development in the proposed patient population. Update of the pharmacodynamic effects and Mechanism 
of action are introduced in the SmPC section 5.1. 
2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The submitted pharmacology studies are sufficient to support additional clinical development in the 
proposed patient population.  
The new indication does not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of 
nintedanib.  The CHMP agreed that the current ERA remains valid for the current type II variation 
covering the proposed additional indication in patients with systemic sclerosis. Nintedanib is not expected 
to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects

Absorption in patient population 
Title: SENSCIS®: A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial evaluating efficacy and safety of 
oral nintedanib treatment for at least 52 weeks in patients with ‘Systemic Sclerosis-associated Interstitial 
Lung Disease’ (SSc-ILD) 
Study design: This was a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel design trial. Patients 
were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to nintedanib or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by anti-
topoisomerase antibody (ATA) status (positive or negative). The main efficacy and safety assessments 
were done until Week 52. Individual patients stayed on blinded trial treatment until the last randomised 
patient reached 52 weeks of treatment, but no longer than 100 weeks. Data collected beyond 52 weeks 
were used in exploratory analyses of efficacy and safety. Patients who completed this trial on treatment 
and attended a follow-up visit 28 days after end of treatment could participate in an open-label extension 
trial 1199.225, in which all patients received nintedanib treatment. 
Results: 
Plasma concentrations of nintedanib and its 2 main metabolites, BIBF 1202 and BIBF 1202 glucuronide, 
were determined in PK samples collected at Visits 4 and 7, just before drug administration. 
Descriptive statistics are presented below. PK samples were missing or excluded from descriptive and 
graphical PK analyses for 39 patients at Visit 4 (150 mg: 38 patients; 100 mg: 1 patient) and 37 patients 
at Visit 7 (150 mg: 31 patients; 100 mg: 6 patients). Reasons were sampling time violations (not 
between 9 to 20 hours post-dose) or missing dose administrations (therefore, these patients were not at 
steady state). Of the patients in the PKS, 4 patients at Visit 4 and 45 patients at Visit 7 received a 
reduced dose of nintedanib 100 mg bid.

Results regarding exposure in subgroups were as expected. Asian patients were found to have higher 
nintedanib exposure than other races (Asian: 0.0755 ng/mL/mg, White: 0.0510 ng/mL/mg, Black/African 
American: 0.0592 ng/mL/mg (Table 3). Slightly higher exposure was seen for patients ≤65 kg (0.0645 
ng/mL/mg) compared to patients >65 kg (0.0501 ng/mL/mg) and for patients ≥65 years (0.0635 
ng/mL/mg) compared to patients <65 years (0.0534 ng/mL/mg). No other relevant differences in 
exposure between subgroup categories were noted.

Comparison of results across studies 
The observed trough concentrations of nintedanib in patients from Trial 1199.214 (SSc-ILD) are provided 
below in Table 4 and compared to values of patients with IPF from Trial 1199.32 and 1199.34.

Figure 1 compares the trough plasma concentrations of the respective clinical trials. Nintedanib plasma 
exposure observed in patients with SSc-ILD appears to be comparable to plasma exposure observed in 
patients with IPF.  
Subgroup analyses of study 1199.214 showed that patients with SSc-ILD, who had Asian race, were 
elderly (≥ 65 years), had lower body weight (≤ 65 kg) or were females (if not weight adjusted), had 
higher nintedanib exposure in a magnitude that was similar as observed in previous PopPK analyses of 
NSCLC and IPF patients. 
Distribution 
No distribution studies were performed which is acceptable. As per the Ofev SmPC, Nintedanib follows at 
least bi-phasic disposition kinetics, has a high volume of distribution (Vss: 1,050 L, 45.0% gCV) and high 
in vitro plasma protein binding, the majority being serum albumin. 
Elimination 
No elimination studies were performed which is acceptable. As per the Ofev SmPC the major route of 
elimination of nintedanib is via faecal/biliary excretion (93.4% of dose, 2.61% gCV). The contribution of 
renal excretion to the total clearance is low. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
No dose proportionality or time dependent studies were performed which is acceptable. The PK of 
nintedanib is considered linear over time. 
Special populations 
No studies in special populations have been performed which is acceptable. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
a) DDI study with bosentan 
The applicant performed a DDI study with Bosentan, an inducer of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). As P-gp is a major 
determinant of nintedanib kinetics, an induction of P-gp may reduce the systemic exposure of nintedanib, 
which in turn could reduce its therapeutic efficacy. The current trial was designed to investigate whether, 
and to which extent, multiple doses of bosentan might influence the kinetics of nintedanib given as a single 
dose. 
Title: Influence of bosentan on the pharmacokinetics of nintedanib in healthy male subjects 
Study design: This open-label, mono-centre clinical trial in healthy male subjects applied a fixed sequence, 
two-treatment, two-period crossover design. Each subject participated in 2 trial periods (Visit 2, Days -1 to 
4, and Visit 3, Days 1 to 10); a wash-out period between trial periods was not mandatory. Each subject 
received the  same  treatments in the  same  order.  All  subjects  were to undergo  2  trial  periods  in  a  fixed 
sequence, receiving reference treatment (R) in Period 1, and test treatment (T) in Period 2. 
Study duration:  
Period 1 (R): single dose of 150 mg nintedanib (1 x 1 capsule) on Day 1 
Period 2 (T): 125 mg bosentan twice daily (2 x 1 tablet) on Days 1 to 8 (bosentan loading dose phase on 
Days 1 to 6), single dose of 150 mg nintedanib on Day 7 (1 x 1 capsule)

(61.5%) never smoked, while 3 subjects (23.1%) were ex-smokers and 2 subjects (15.4%) currently 
smoked. None of the subjects consumed alcohol to an extent interfering with the trial; 2 subjects 
(15.4%) did not drink alcohol at all. None of the subjects reported a relevant medical history or was 
diagnosed with a relevant baseline condition interfering with participation in the trial.  
Treatment compliance: 
The  healthy  male  subjects  received  the  trial  medication  at  the  trial  centre  under  surveillance  of  the 
investigator or a designee. Plasma concentrations of nintedanib (and metabolites as applicable) as well as 
those of bosentan provided additional information on treatment compliance. No deviations from treatment 
compliance were detected. 
Concomitant and prohibited therapies: 
None of the subjects received a concomitant medication at baseline. 
Protocol deviations: The maximum deviations from the scheduled drug administrations were 38 min (at 
Visit 3 24:00 h in one subject) and 16 min (at Visit 3 48:00 h in another Subject), both during the bosentan 
loading dose phase.  All  other  drug  administrations were  done  within  2 min  of  the  scheduled  time  point. 
These  deviations  were  considered  to  be  not  relevant.  The  maximum  deviation  from  the  scheduled  PK 
sampling times was 24 min (in one Subject Visit 2 at 24:00 h). All other samples were taken within 4 min 
of the scheduled sampling time. These findings constituted minor protocol violations/deviations and none 
of them was considered as relevant. None resulted in exclusion from the analyses. 
Results: 
Pre-dose  plasma  concentrations  of  nintedanib  (BIBF  1120)  were  BLQ  in  all  subjects  prior  to  dosing  of 
nintedanib alone (Treatment Period 1) as well as prior to coadministration with bosentan (Treatment Period 
2). 
Time  profiles  of  gMean  plasma  concentrations  were  virtually  superimposable  for  R  and  T.  Peak 
concentrations  of  nintedanib  were  reached  approximately  2  h  after  nintedanib  administration  and  then 
declined in an at least bi-phasic manner. Plasma concentrations were measurable up to the last sampling 
time  point  at  72  h  after  dosing.  Low  to  moderate  inter-individual  variability  was  observed  for  plasma 
concentrations in the disposition phase (time points including and beyond 2 h after nintedanib dosing), with 
geometric coefficients of variation (%gCV) ranging from 31.4% to 73.3%. Inter-individual variability in the 
absorption phase was higher, with geometric coefficients of variation up to 1080%. 
Primary PK parameters 
The primary and key secondary nintedanib PK parameters were similar following a single oral dose of 150 
mg  nintedanib  administered  alone  (R)  or  in  combination  with  multiple  doses  of  bosentan  125  mg  given 
twice daily over 8 days (T): 
•  Nintedanib gMean AUC0-tz was 195 ng·h/mL for R and 193 ng·h/mL for T 
•  Nintedanib gMean Cmax was 21.9 ng/mL for R and 22.7 ng/mL for T 
•  Nintedanib gMean AUC0-∞ was 204 ng·h/mL for R and 208 ng·h/mL for T 
The inter-individual variability of the primary and key secondary PK endpoints was moderate and similar 
between  both  treatments,  with  %gCV  values  of  38.8%  (R)  and  33.4%  (T)  for  AUC0-tz,  55.2%  (R)  and 
42.2% (T) for Cmax, and 38.3% (R) and 34.1% (T) for AUC0-∞ The inferential analysis of nintedanib AUCs 
and Cmax demonstrated comparable PK characteristics for nintedanib irrespective of coadministration with 
bosentan. The adjusted gMean T/R ratios were 98.85% for AUC0-tz, 103.36% for Cmax, and 101.98% for 
AUC0-∞.

The corresponding 90% CIs of these PK parameters included 100%, thus indicating no relevant effect of

Likewise, all further nintedanib endpoints (including tmax and t1/2) were similar following the R and T 
treatments.

Metabolites of nintedanib: BIBF 1202 and BIBF 1202 glucuronide 
Pre-dose plasma concentrations of the nintedanib metabolite BIBF 1202 were BLQ in all subjects prior to 
dosing of nintedanib alone (Treatment Period 1) as well as prior to coadministration with bosentan 
(Treatment Period 2). Regarding the metabolite BIBF 1202 glucuronide, the observed pre-dose plasma 
concentrations were all BLQ in Treatment Period 1, while 9 out of 13 subjects showed detectable plasma 
concentrations in one of their pre-dose samples in Treatment Period 2. In one Subject, the pre-dose 
plasma concentration exceeded 5% of Cmax, and in consequence all BIBF 1202 glucuronide plasma 
concentrations of this subject were excluded from the calculation of descriptive statistics in Treatment 
Period 2.  
Plasma concentration time profiles (gMean) of both nintedanib metabolites (BIBF 1202 and BIBF 1202 
glucuronide) were similar following the administration of nintedanib alone or in combination with multiple 
doses of bosentan. Peak plasma concentrations of BIBF 1202 were reached 1.5 to 5 h after nintedanib 
administration, while Cmax values of BIBF 1202 glucuronide were observed at 6 to 12 h after nintedanib 
administration. Inter-individual variability of the exposure parameters (AUC0-tz and AUC0-∞) observed 
for BIBF 1202 and BIBF 1202 glucuronide in both treatments were moderate with %gCV values of 45% to 
51% for BIBF 1202 and of 60% to 65% for BIBF 1202 glucuronide

Trough bosentan plasma concentrations Cpre,ss were similar on Days 5, 6, and 7/Visit 3; gMean values 
were 80.5 ng/mL, 86.6 ng/mL, and 89.8 ng/mL, respectively.  
Based on bosentan plasma concentrations at trough on Days 5, 6, and 7/Visit 3, inferential analyses 
suggested attainment of bosentan steady state at Day 5. All 95% CIs for the three comparisons of 
Cpre,ss between Days 5, 6, and 7 (based on adjusted mean ratios) contained ‘1’. The table below 
summarises the Cpre,ss gMean values and the results of the pairwise comparisons of bosentan Cpre,ss on

Title: A Phase I trial to investigate the effect of nintedanib on the pharmacokinetics of a combination of 
ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel in patients with non-small cell lung cancer 
Study design:  This open-label, multi-centre clinical trial in NSCLC patients applied a fixed sequence, 2-
treatment, 2-period crossover design. In period 1 (Reference treatment, R) patients received a single 
dose of Microgynon® (ethinylestradiol 30 μg and levonorgestrel 150 μg). A least 7 days later treatment 
period 2 (Test treatment, T) was started with nintedanib bid dosing. A second dose of Microgynon® was 
administered after continuous nintedanib intake for at least 7 consecutive days. 
The trial was stopped prematurely in November 2017 due to poor recruitment. Two patients had been 
recruited and treated by the time the trial was stopped.

Exposure response analyses in patients with IPF 
Title: Update on exposure-response analyses for nintedanib in IPF for efficacy (annual rate of decline in 
FVC and FVC % predicted) and safety (diarrhea and liver enzyme elevations) endpoints 
Objective: 
(1)  To characterize the relationship between nintedanib exposure and efficacy (represented as annual 
rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) and percentage of predicted FVC (FVC % predicted)) 
and the major safety events diarrhea and liver enzyme elevations in patients with IPF 
(2)  To explore the effects of selected intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors on the exposure efficacy and 
exposure safety relationships of nintedanib in IPF by refining existing models 
Methods:

Observed  (Cpre,ss)  and  individual  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  model  predicted  (Cpre,ss,pred)  nintedanib  trough 
plasma concentrations at steady state were used as nintedanib exposure metrics. As more than one Cpre,ss 
value was determined per patient, the intra-patient geometric mean was used. 
Cpre,ss,pred was calculated using the final model and analysis dataset of the combined population PK analysis 
of  studies  1199.30,  1199.32,  and  1199.34.  Changes  in  dose  were  not  considered,  when  using  Cpre,ss as 
exposure  metrics  (i.e.  time  independent  exposure  based  on  starting  dose  level),  whereas  treatment 
interruptions  and  dose  reduction  were  taken  into  account  for  Cpre.ss,pred  based  modelling  approaches 
(Cpre,ss,pred(t)). As trough concentrations obtained after once daily (qd) dosing are difficult to compare with 
those after twice daily (bid) dosing, qd dosing was excluded from model building. A sensitivity analysis was 
however performed at the end of model building to assess the impact of data exclusion. 
Exposure-efficacy 
Different  disease  progression  models  were  explored  (including  linear,  exponential,  logistic,  generalized 
logistic and Gompertz functions) to describe the natural decline in FVC and FVC % predicted over time in 
patients with IPF without nintedanib treatment based on placebo data.  
Subsequently, the relationship between the time course of FVC or  FVC % predicted and each Cpre,ss and 
Cpre,ss,pred(t)  was  investigated  using  different  drug  effect  functions  and  data  from  placebo  and  nintedanib 
treated  patients.  The  potential  impact  of  selected  intrinsic  and  extrinsic  factors  on  baseline  FVC  (% 
predicted), natural disease progression or the drug-dependent treatment effect was evaluated by stepwise 
covariate  analysis.  The  evaluated  covariates  include  age,  height,  gender,  ethnicity  [Caucasian/Black  vs. 
Chinese  vs.  Taiwanese  vs.  Indian  vs.  Japanese  vs.  Korean  vs.  other  Asian],  smoking  status  [never  vs. 
current  vs.  ex-smoker],  presence of  honeycombing confirming IPF  diagnosis  [yes  vs.  no],  occurrence of 
diarrhea  during  nintedanib  treatment  [yes  vs.  no]  and  study  (1199.30  vs.  .32  vs.  34).  A  univariate 
assessment was thereby followed by a stepwise forward inclusion-backward elimination procedure. 5% and 
0.1%  alpha  level  (log  likelihood  ratio  test,  χ2  distribution)  were  chosen  for  the  forward  inclusion  and 
backward  elimination,  respectively.  Age,  height  and  sex  were  implemented  as  pre-defined  covariates 
influencing the baseline FVC in the disease progression model (not for baseline FVC % predicted) as known 
from literature and were only re-evaluated during the backward elimination step. 
Exposure-safety  
Parametric time-to-event modelling was used to explore the relationship between the safety endpoints of 
interest and each Cpre,ss and Cpre,ss,pred(t). The safety endpoints of interest were diarrhea (more precisely: 
time to first onset of diarrhea of any intensity) and liver enzyme elevation events (more precisely: time to 
first ALT or AST elevation to three times upper limit of normal or higher, i.e. ALT or AST > 3x ULN). Diarrhea 
events were derived from patient reported adverse events data and were assumed to be right censored; 
ALT  or  AST  elevations  were  determined  using  measurements  from  standard  clinical  laboratory  tests 
performed at the visits during study conduct and ALT or AST > 3x ULN events were therefore assumed to 
be interval censored. Different drug effect functions were explored. 
Regarding the methodology for assessment of covariate effects (i.e. potential impact of selected intrinsic 
and extrinsic factors), the same approaches as described for the exposure-efficacy analyses were applied.  
The  evaluated  covariates  include  age,  body  weight,  body  surface  area,  height,  gender,  ethnicity 
[Caucasian/Black  vs.  Chinese  vs.  Taiwanese  vs.  Indian  vs.  Japanese  vs.  Korean  vs.  other  Asian],  study 
[1199.30 vs. .32 vs. 34] and smoking status [never vs. current vs. ex-smoker]). 
Updates in comparison to previously reported exposure-response analyses 
In comparison to the previously reported exposure-response analyses, which were also based on data from 
studies 1199.30, 1199.32 and 1199.34, in the current analyses the analysis datasets were updated, one 
further efficacy endpoint was added, namely FVC % predicted, and more thorough analyses for exposure-

safety  relationships  were  done  including  evaluation  of  additional  drug  effect  functions  and  addition  of  a 
covariate analysis for the exposure-liver enzyme elevation endpoint. 
Results:  
Data 
Data  from  1403  patients  treated  with  nintedanib  50-150  mg  bid  doses  (n=895)  or  placebo  (n=508)  in 
studies  1199.30,  1199.32  or  1199.34  were  used  for  model  development  based  on  predicted  pre-dose 
concentrations Cpre,ss,pred(t). Additional 86 patients belonging to the 50 mg qd treatment group were used 
for  sensitivity  analysis.  When  exploring  observed  pre-dose  concentrations,  1283  patients  treated  with 
nintedanib 50-150 mg bid doses (n=775) or placebo (n=508) were included (lack of evaluable Cpre,ss for 
120 patients in comparison to Cpre,ss,pred(t)). 
Overall, 11192 FVC (and FVC % predicted) measurements over a 52 weeks treatment period were analysed 
(6744, 621 and 3827 observations from bid and qd treatment groups and placebo, respectively).  
Five hundred ninety three (40%) out of 1489 patients overall had a diarrhea event. About 60% (N=445) 
of  patients  experienced  diarrhea  at  the  therapeutic  dose  of  150  mg  bid  (N=723).  The  number  of  liver 
enzyme elevation events (ALT or AST elevations ≥ 3xULN) was low (N=41) compared to the total number 
of subjects (N=1489) with only 3 events (0.6%) in the placebo group (N=508) and 38 events (4.3%) in 
the nintedanib bid treatment groups (N=895). About 5% (N=36) of patients experienced a liver enzyme 
elevation event at the therapeutic dose of 150 mg bid (N=723).  
The analyzed patients with IPF had a median age of 67 years and median body weight of 77.0 kg, median 
height  of  168.0  cm,  median  body  surface  area  of  1.87  m2,  median  baseline  FVC  of  2.68  L  and  median 
baseline  FVC  %  predicted  of  78.2%.  22.0%  (N=328)  of  the  patients  were  females.  Asian  patients 
represented 27.7% of all patients (Chinese: 9.5%, N=141; Korean: 6.8%, N=101; Taiwanese: 0.5%, N=7; 
Indian:  1.3%,  N=20;  Japanese:  8.5%,  N=126;  other  Asian  (including  American  Indian/Alaska 
native):1.1%, N=17), Black patients 0.1% (N=2) and the Caucasians 72.2% (N=1075). For 48.6% of the 
patients, IPF diagnosis was confirmed by honeycombing (more precisely referring to patients included in 
studies  1199.32  and  1199.34  with  honeycombing  on  HRCT  and/or  confirmation  of  usual  interstitial 
pneumonia  (UIP)  by  surgical  lung  biopsy),  whereas  22.7%  of  the  patients  had  no  honeycombing  (more 
precisely referring to patients included in studies 1199.32 and 1199.34 with features of possible UIP and 
traction bronchiectasis on HRCT [criteria B and C] and no surgical lung biopsy) and 28.7% of the patients 
had missing information (referring to patients included in study 1199.30). 
Exposure-efficacy (FVC) 
The  FVC  data  were  described  by  a  linear  disease  progression  model  with  a  disease-modifying  effect  of 
nintedanib  exposure  on  the  annual  rate  of  FVC  decline.  No  evidence  of  a  symptomatic  drug  effect  was 
found.  A  maximum  effect  (Emax)  relationship  was  established  for  both  Cpre,ss  and  Cpre,ss,pred  with  an 
estimated half maximum effect concentration (EC50) of  2.57 ng/mL and 3.28 ng/mL for the final models, 
respectively  (with  moderate  relative  standard  errors:  55-57%),  which  translates  into  an  EC80  of 
approximately  10-13  ng/mL,  respectively.  For  comparison,  median  observed  nintedanib  trough 
concentrations for 150 mg bid were about 10 ng/mL in the Phase II/III trials. 
Even  though  an  exposure-FVC  model  could  formally  be  established,  it  should  be  considered  that  using 
individual drug plasma exposure instead of dose group allocation neither resulted in clearly superior models 
nor did it add benefit by reducing unexplained inter-individual variability in response (i.e., rate of decline 
in FVC) in a considerable manner. Within the 150 mg dose group, only a slight trend for a positive exposure 
dependency of FVC decline was found.  
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020 
Page 24/119 
 
  
  
During covariate analysis, the a priori assumed correlation between baseline FVC and age, gender as well 
as height (known relationship from literature) was confirmed. No distinct predictor of the treatment effect 
of nintedanib other than exposure was identified.  
In  particular,  there  was  no  evidence  that  disease  progression  or  exposure-response  relationship  differ 
between Caucasian patients and patients from the investigated Asian subpopulations or patients with and 
without presence of honeycombing. Furthermore, it was not affected by patient's age or height. 
Only  smoking  status  was  found  to  be  a  significant  covariate  on  the  baseline  FVC  and  natural  disease 
progression not affecting the nintedanib treatment effect (higher baseline FVC and a slower rate of FVC 
decline were found for current smokers than for ex- or non-smokers).  
Covariates of gender, diarrhoea during treatment and baseline FVC % predicted were at the borderline of 
significance and not conclusive, as only significant in one of the two FVC based models. Hence, a slower 
FVC decline in women was only significant in the model based on predicted trough concentrations. Patients 
experiencing diarrhoea of any intensity during treatment tended to reach a higher maximum drug effect 
resulting in an FVC decline typical for healthy subjects (only significant in the model based on observed 
trough concentrations [Cpre,ss]). Patients with more severely impaired lung function at baseline tended to 
need higher exposure to achieve the same effect size as patients with less severely impaired lung function 
(only significant in the model based on Cpre,ss). 
Exposure-efficacy (FVC % predicted) 
By using FVC % predicted as efficacy endpoint, comparable model structure and parameter estimates 
were  obtained  as  for  FVC.  Hence,  a  linear  disease  progression  modelling  framework  with  a  disease-
modifying effect on the rate of decline in FVC % predicted was implemented using an Emax model. EC50 
was estimated to be 2.18 ng/mL and 2.77 ng/mL for the final models based on observed and predicted 
trough  concentrations  at  steady-state,  respectively  (relative  standard  errors:  49-50%)  which  translates 
into an EC80 of approximately 9-11 ng/mL, respectively. Like in the FVC based models, smoking status 
was identified as significant covariate on baseline FVC % predicted and natural disease progression (higher 
baseline FVC % predicted and slower decline in FVC % predicted for current smokers than ex- or never-
smoker),  however  not  affecting  the  nintedanib  treatment  effect.  No  further  significant  covariate  effects 
influencing  the  baseline  FVC %  predicted,  natural  disease  progression  or  the  drug-dependent  treatment 
effect were detected.  
Exposure-safety (diarrhoea) 
The parametric time-to-first event models characterizing the relationship between nintedanib exposure and 
diarrhoea (with a sigmoidal maximum drug effect) was inferior in terms of model selection criteria to the 
models based on dose group suggesting that the actual administered dose (i.e. local gut concentrations) is 
a better predictor for the risk to develop diarrhoea than plasma exposure. This was supported by further 
analyses: 
- 
Visual  predictive  checks  based  on  the  exposure-diarrhoea  models  indicated  an  inadequate 
description  of  data  across  different  dose/treatment  groups  (over-  and  underprediction  of  the 
diarrhoea risk in the low and high nintedanib dose groups, respectively).

In  exploratory  data  analyses,  patients  from  the  150  mg  bid  treatment  group  were  matched  to 
patients in the 100 mg bid treatment group by nintedanib exposure. Descriptive statistics on these 
groups showed a different proportion of diarrhoea events although a similar diarrhea risk would be 
expected for similar exposure levels, if it was exposure driven. The proportion of events in the two 
matched  groups  reflected  the  proportion  of  diarrhoea  events  of  the  whole  treatment  group 
independent on drug exposure.

-  Results from covariate analysis indicated that subpopulations of patients with increased nintedanib 
exposure were not associated with a higher diarrhoea risk but even a trend for a lower risk was 
detected due to compensating covariate effects (see following paragraph).  
A covariate analysis based on the exposure-diarrhoea models as well as the dose/treatment group-driven 
models  showed,  that  age,  gender,  body  weight,  and  height  had  no  significant  effect  on  the  dose  or 
exposure-diarrhoea  relationship.  However,  Asian  patients  tended  to  be  less  sensitive  to  experience 
diarrhoea under nintedanib treatment as compared to Caucasian patients in all models. In the exposure-
diarrhoea models, the diarrhoea risk was additionally found to be lower in never-smokers than in current 
or  ex-smokers  with  the  same  nintedanib  plasma  exposure.  The  subgroups  found  to  be  less  sensitive  to 
diarrhoea  (Asian  patients  and  never  smokers;  this  trend  was  also  detected  for  patients  with  low  body 
weight, low body surface area and low height during univariate assessment), are characterized by increased 
nintedanib exposure according to PopPK analysis in patients with IPF. In case of an exposure-dependent 
diarrhoea risk, an increased risk would be expected for these subgroups, whereas an unchanged or even 
decreased risk due to compensating effects was found.  
In contrast to the previously reported exposure-diarrhoea models, consistent results for the models using 
observed  or  model  predicted  pre-dose  concentrations  were  obtained  in  the  current  analysis  (use  of  an 
updated dataset). The differences between models in the previous analyses turned out to not result from 
differences in Cpre,ss versus Cpre,ss,pred but from inconsistent assumptions on diarrhoea occurrence on the first 
day of treatment, for which the exact time was not known (i.e. events were assumed to occur before start 
of treatment for Cpre,ss,pred and after start of treatment for Cpre,ss due to time dependent implemention of 
Cpre,ss,pred). This was adapted (assumption of event occurrence after start of treatment for both models) to 
achieve consistency.  
Exposure-safety (liver enzyme elevations) 
With respect to liver enzymes, the number of patients experiencing an ALT or AST elevation >= 3x ULN 
was low (in total 41 events), as almost no events occurred in the dose groups lower than 150 mg bid (N = 
3 for placebo (exclusively from Phase III) and N = 2 for 50 mg bid treatment group).  
Overall, there seemed to be a shallow relationship between nintedanib plasma exposure and ALT or AST 
elevations.  
For both exposure-safety models (based on observed and predicted exposure), a parametric time-to-first 
safety event model with a log linear drug effect on the log of the hazard was implemented (better model 
fit and predictive performance as compared to a linear relationship used in the previously reported cox-
proportional hazard models). A slight superiority of the exposure-liver enzyme elevation models over the 
dose group based models (categorical dose effect) regarding model selection criteria was observed.  
Gender  was  identified  as  significant  covariate  influencing  the  risk  to  develop  ALT/AST  elevations 
(independent of exposure) with females having an about 3 to 4-fold higher (exposure adjusted) risk than 
males (reference exposure:10 ng/mL=median exposure for 150 mg bid). The trend for a gender effect was 
consistently  observed  in  both  models  despite  the  very  low  incidence  of  liver  enzyme  events  (N=38  and 
N=31 in the active treatment groups for the two analyses sets, respectively). However, this effect remained 
only significant in the final model based on PK model predicted nintedanib exposure.  
As visual predictive checks stratified by subgroups of covariate characteristics further supported a gender 
effect,  this  might  be  considered  a  ‘true  effect’  and  was  therefore  implemented  in  both  exposure-liver 
enzyme  elevation  models  based  on  observed  and  predicted  Cpre,ss.  After  adjusting  for  gender,  no  other 
significant covariate effects (including age, ethnicity, smoking status, height, body weight, and body surface 
area) on the exposure-liver enzyme elevation relationship were detected.

The  results  and  conclusions  from  the  current  update  of  exposure-response  analyses  based  on  studies 
1199.30, 1199.32 and 1199.34 were consistent to those from the previous analyses.  
The  current  analyses  revealed  further  insights  into  the  exposure-efficacy  relationship  (additional 
consideration  of  FVC  %  predicted  as  endpoint)  and  exposure-safety  relationships  (more  thorough 
assessment  of  the  exposure-diarrhea  relationship  and  the  exposure-liver  enzyme  elevation  relationship 
including  a  covariate  assessment  for  the  exposure-liver  enzyme  elevation  relationship).  Overall,  the 
analyses revealed an Emax-like relationship between exposure and the efficacy endpoints annual rate of 
decline in FVC and FVC % predicted, for the range of exposure observed in studies 1199.30, 1199.32, and 
1199.34.  
The exposure-efficacy models support the selected starting dose of nintedanib 150 mg bid for the treatment 
of IPF, as this results in efficacious exposure levels in the majority of patients with the median exposure 
level just approaching the plateau of the established maximum effect relationship. No distinct predictors of 
nintedanib effect other than exposure were detected. With respect to safety, a weak relationship between 
nintedanib plasma exposure and ALT and/or AST elevations were found. Females additionally seemed to 
have an about 3 to 4-fold higher (exposure-adjusted) risk to experience ALT and/or AST elevations ≥ 3x 
ULN than males, although the estimate was based on a limited number of liver enzyme elevation events.  
With regard to diarrhoea, the thorough analyses suggest that the actual administered dose (i.e. local gut 
concentrations) is a better predictor for the risk to develop diarrhoea than plasma exposure.  
Therefore, no change in diarrhoea risk is expected for patient populations with altered nintedanib exposure.  
Exposure response analyses in patients with SSc-ILD  
Title: Exposure-response analyses for nintedanib in patients with systemic sclerosis associated interstitial 
lung disease (SSc-ILD). Reference: [c26435665] 
Objectives: 
(1) Characterize the relationship between nintedanib plasma exposure and the efficacy endpoint of annual 
rate  of  decline  in  forced  vital  capacity  (FVC)  over  52  weeks  and  the  safety  endpoint  of  liver  enzyme 
elevations (assessed as time to first aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
elevation ≥ 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN)) over 52 weeks in patients with systemic sclerosis associated 
interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). 
(2) Identify relevant covariate-parameter relationships in the exposure-response models. 
Data: 
Analysis for FVC was based on data from 575 patients with SSc-ILD randomized to either 150 mg nintedanib 
twice daily (bid) (n=287) or placebo (n=288) in study 1199.214. Overall, 4500 FVC measurements over 
the 52 weeks treatment period (as used for primary endpoint assessment including baseline measurements) 
were analyzed. Analysis for liver enzyme elevations (evaluating time to first AST or ALT elevation ≥ 3 x 
ULN over 52 weeks) was based on pooled data from overall 1979 patients with either idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis (IPF) or SSc-ILD. A total of 1403 patients with IPF treated with nintedanib doses of 50 mg, 100 mg 
or 150 mg bid (n=895) or placebo (n=508) in studies 1199.30, 1199.32, 1199.34 and a total of 576 patients 
with SSc-ILD treated with either 150 mg nintedanib bid (n=288) or placebo (n=288) in study 1199.214 
were  considered.  In  all  studies,  dose  reductions  or  treatment  interruptions  were  allowed  for  the 
management of adverse events. The number of patients with liver enzyme elevation events was low (n=57) 
compared to the total number of subjects (n=1979) with 41 events in 1403 patients with IPF (3 events in 
the placebo group and 38 events in the nintedanib bid treatment groups) and 16 events in 576 patients 
with SSc-ILD (2 events in the placebo group and 14 events in the 150 mg bid treatment group). 
Methods: 
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020 
Page 27/119 
 
  
  
The  methods  used  in  this  analysis  were  pre-specified  and  outlined  in  a  separate  analysis  plan  for  the 
exposure-response  analyses  prior  to  database  lock.  Population  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  model  predicted 
nintedanib  trough  plasma  concentrations  at  steady  state  (Cpred,ss,t)  were  used  as  nintedanib  exposure 
metrics (time dependent exposure measure by considering dose reductions and treatment interruptions). 
More precisely, Cpred,ss,t were calculated based on fixed effects parameter estimates and empirical Bayes 
estimates (EBE) based on inter-individual variability (IIV) terms of the final population PK model in IPF and 
PK analysis data sets from the respective studies (including dosing history, PK measurements and covariate 
effects from study 1199.214 for SSc-ILD and from studies 1199.30, 1199.32, and 1199.34 for IPF). 
Data  summaries  and  a  graphical  exploratory  analysis  were  first  performed,  in  order  to  guide  the  model 
development. 
Previous  exposure-response  models  developed  in  IPF  were  starting  points  for  FVC  and  liver  enzyme 
elevation  modeling.  Hence,  for  FVC,  the  starting  point  was  a  linear  disease  progression  model  with  a 
disease-modifying maximum drug effect (Emax) of nintedanib exposure on the annual rate of decline in 
FVC. For liver enzyme elevations, the starting point was a parametric time-to-first safety event model with 
a log linear drug effect on the log of the hazard. The models were adapted until they described the data 
adequately. 
Once  the  base  models  were  identified,  a  covariate  search  was  performed  applying  a  full  random  effect 
model  (FREM)  approach  for  the  FVC  endpoint  and  a  stepwise  forward  inclusion-backward  elimination 
procedure for the liver enzyme elevation endpoint. 5% and 0.1% alpha levels (log likelihood ratio test, χ2 
distribution)  were  chosen for  the  forward  inclusion and  backward  elimination,  respectively.  The  baseline 
covariates  tested  for  FVC  were  anti-topoisomerase antibodies  (ATA)  status,  gender,  age,  race,  race  and 
region  combined  by  considering  Asian  subpopulations  (including  Chinese,  Japanese  and  Indian), 
Mycophenolate (mofetil/sodium) use at baseline, SSc subtype (diffuse and limited) and FVC % predicted at 
baseline (baseline FVC as  a % of normal FVC predicted according to the Global Lung Initiative). For the 
liver enzyme elevation model, the baseline covariates tested included age, gender, body weight, race, race 
and region combined by considering Asian subpopulations (including Chinese/Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean 
and Indian), Mycophenolate (mofetil/sodium) use at baseline, SSc subtype, ATA status and population (IPF 
vs. SSc-ILD). 
The final models were identified after including significant covariates based on model qualification specific 
for each endpoint. 
Results: 
The final exposure-FVC model in patients with SSc-ILD consisted of a linear disease progression model with 
a disease-modifying nintedanib effect on the rate of decline in FVC using a maximum effect (Emax) drug 
effect  function.  As  concentration  at  half  maximum  effect  (EC50)  and  Emax  were  not  estimated  with 
acceptable precision (analysis of only one dose group), EC50 was fixed to the estimated value from the 
previous  FVC  model  in  patients  nintedanib).  Fixing  EC50  to  a  certain  value,  which  can  be  considered  a 
strong assumption, was based on the mode of action of nintedanib. Its antifibrotic activity is considered 
independent of the initial trigger. Therefore, it is assumed that the nintedanib drug concentration leading 
to a half maximum effect of this antifibrotic activity (EC50) is the same across different conditions of fibrosis. 
The parameter estimates for the final FVC model for are provided in Table 10. Overall, a good precision of 
parameter estimates was obtained with exception of the high RSE for the Emax parameter (76.5%) and a 
high RSE of the pre-defined age effect on the alpha, which appeared not to be supported by the current 
data in SSc-ILD patients but was kept in the model based on prior knowledge.

Table 10 Parameter estimates of the final FVC nintedanib model 
Inter-individual variability (IIV) terms were supported on the parameter of FVC at baseline and natural 
rate of decline in FVC (referring to rate of decline in FVC in placebo patients). Age, gender and height 
were included as pre-specified structural covariates on the FVC at baseline. No other distinct covariate-
parameter relationship for the FVC model was identified. 
The final model was therefore identical to the base FVC model. The model fit of the current data set was 
assessed using GOF and VPC plots (Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 6). The figures demonstrate that the final 
FVC model, overall, described the data adequately.

Using this model, the natural rate of decline in FVC was estimated to be about 50 % slower in patients 
with SSc-ILD than in patients with IPF (-98.6 mL/year (95% CI: [-124.5; -72.7]) for patients with SSc-
ILD). Similar to the effect in patients with IPF, the Emax estimate, although being rather imprecise 
indicated that the annual rate of decline in FVC could almost be reduced to the natural age related loss of 
FVC (annual rate of decline at maximum drug effect: -28.5 mL/year (95% CI: [-71.2; 14.2])). Model 
diagnostics for the final FVC model indicated a satisfactory predictive performance for both placebo and 
nintedanib 150 mg bid data. The relationship of annual rate of decline in FVC versus concentration based 
on the final FVC model demonstrates that the therapeutic dose of 150 mg bid resulted in plasma 
exposures, which were close to the maximum drug effect.

that a drop-out model was needed. Therefore, no drop-out model was developed.

Regarding the endpoint of liver enzyme elevations, a positive relationship (already observed in IPF data) 
between nintedanib plasma exposure and ALT or AST elevations ≥ 3 x ULN was confirmed based on 
combined data from patients with IPF and SSc-ILD. The final exposure liver enzyme elevation model 
consisted of a parametric time-to-first safety event model with a log-linear drug effect on the log of the 
hazard. In addition to plasma exposure, gender was identified as independent and as significant covariate 
influencing the risk to develop ALT or AST elevations (in line with previous model established in patients 
with IPF). No other significant covariate-parameter relationships were identified. In particular, no 
significant difference between the populations of patients with IPF and patients with SSc-ILD on the 
exposure-AST/ALT relationship was observed. Assessment of the final liver enzyme elevation model 
showed a good predictive performance in the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) plots overall as well as in the K-M plots 
stratified by key covariates. 
Simulations, based on the final liver enzyme model, predicted the risk having a liver enzyme elevation 
event [exposure-adjusted to the median Cpred,ss,t of study 1199.214 for the 150 mg bid regimen; 9.9 
ng/mL] to be about 3-fold higher in female than male patients on average (median hazard ratio of 3.0; 
95% CI: [1.8;5.1]). The expected median proportion of patients having an event was, however, low for 
the overall population (<10 %) and the estimated gender effect was associated with moderate precision 
(due to limited number of events).

N/A 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
PK data from three studies were presented as part of this variation.  
The first study obtained PK data from SSc-ILD patients, patients were treated and dosed with the same 
posology as for the licenced indication of IPF. 
Baseline demographics were well balanced at the start of the trial, with the exception of the numbers of 
patients taking anti-diarrheal medication (11.5 v 50%) and are unlikely to impact on PK analysis. A 
higher number of patients discontinued from the trial in the nintedanib treatment arm compared to the 
placebo arm, however the PK data was collected at week 4 and 7 where the number of discontinuations 
was lower and unlikely to impact PK results. 
Overall, plasma levels were lower to what was observed in IPF patients where the dose-normalized steady 
state nintedanib trough plasma concentration (Cpre,ss,norm) after multiple oral administrations of 
nintedanib 150 mg twice daily was 0.0635 and 0.0687 for IPF trials 1199.32 and 1199.34 compared to 
0.0555 for SSc-ILD patients. However, it is also noted that both IPF trials had outlier subjects with higher 
than expected nintedanib levels which may have affected the overall mean plasma levels, while for a third 
IPF trial not included in the PK overview (study 1199.30, n=70), the Cmin plasma level was closer to that 
observed in the current study at 0.0558.

Subgroup analysis for SSc-ILD patients demonstrated higher gMean ratios for Asians, patients with a low 
body weight (<60kg), the elderly (>65 years) and for female subjects. These results follow the same 
trends observed in IPF patients. 
The second study in this variation presented data from a healthy volunteer trial looking at potential 
interactions between Nintedanib and bosentan, a frequent comedication in patients with SSc-ILD used to 
treat pulmonary hypertension and to prevent new digital ulcers. In this study the inter-individual 
variability (gCV%) in the absorption phase of nintedanib in combination with bosentan was extremely 
high at 1080%, however after 2 hrs this had decreased substantially to 31.2 to 73.3%. The plasma levels 
of nintedanib before and after bosentan dosing were similar with adjusted gMean T/R ratios of 98.85% for 
AUC0-tz, 103.36% for Cmax, and 101.98% for AUC0-∞. However, a difference was noted in the t1/2 
values of nintedanib before and after bosentan dosing (21.1 v 26.5h), and the results for the metabolites 
BIBF 1202 and BIBF 1202 glucuronide demonstrated lower levels for AUC0-tz, Cmax, and AUC0-∞ 
following co-administration of Bosentan compared to Nintedanib treatment alone.   
Bosentan is an assumed inducer of P-gp. In a previous DDI study where nintedanib was administered in 
combination with the potent P-gp inducer rifampicin, exposure to nintedanib decreased to 50.3% based 
on AUC and to 60.3% based on Cmax upon co-administration with rifampicin compared to administration 
of nintedanib alone (Ofev SmPC). 
While subject numbers were low, the CHMP is of the opinion that bosentan has no effect on the levels of 
nintedanib.  The SmPC of Ofev has been updated to reflect this (section 5.2).   
The third study was to look at the potential interaction between Nintendanib and the oral contractive 
Microgynon. Due to poor recruitment rates only 2 patients could be recruited to this trial and there is not 
enough data to draw any conclusions.  
Another DDI trial in patients with SSc-ILD has been initiated, study 1199.0340, and is not part of this 
application. The clinical study report will be submitted for later review through a variation which is 
acceptable by CHMP. 
The applicant has also provided exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety models using data from IPF and 
SSc-ILD trials.  
Using the exposure-efficacy model, the rate of decline in FVC was estimated to be about 50 % slower in 
patients with SSc-ILD than in patients compared with IPF patients. Noteworthy, in trial 1199.214, 
approximately half of the patients were on background treatment with mycophenolate at baseline, 
presumably contributing additionally to the overall slower FVC decline compared with patients with IPF in 
the INPULSIS® trials. Data did not allow to characterise the exposure-effect relationship as properly as 
for IPF due to the lower number of patients, the slower decline in FVC and the lack of additional doses 
other than 150 mg bid. However, it is agreed that the 90% CI for trough plasma concentrations based on 
the proposed licenced dose of 150 bid resulted in plasma levels which were close to the maximum drug 
effect.  
For the exposure-safety model, a positive correlation between nintedanib plasma exposure and ALT or 
AST elevations ≥ 3 x ULN was confirmed. Gender was identified as a significant covariate with females 3 
times more likely to develop ALT or AST elevations. These results were in agreement with the previous 
model established in IPF patients.   
In conclusion, the exposure-response analyses support the proposed dose of 150 mg bid as the 
therapeutic starting dose for patients with SSc-ILD.

2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Based on the updated clinical data provided in this application, it is agreed that the exposure-response 
analyses support the proposed dose of 150 mg bid as the therapeutic starting dose for patients with SSc-
ILD. The section 4.2 is amended accordingly. Additional information related to Drug Drug interactions are 
added to the SmPC section 4.5. 
In addition, the results of the ongoing DDI trial in patients with SSc-ILD, study 1199.0340 will be 
submitted through a variation after approval of this new indication which is considered acceptable by 
CHMP.

2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Results of exposure-response analyses in patients with SSc-ILD (annual rate of decline in FVC over 52 
weeks as an efficacy endpoint and liver enzyme elevations as a safety endpoint) were consistent with 
results determined in patients with IPF. The exposure-efficacy model in IPF could be applied to patients 
with SSc-ILD with an about 50% slower estimated FVC decline in the placebo group in patients with SSc-
ILD, compared with IPF. Noteworthy, in trial 1199.214, approximately half of the patients were on 
background treatment with mycophenolate at baseline, presumably contributing additionally to the overall 
slower FVC decline compared with patients with IPF in the INPULSIS® trials. Data did not allow to 
characterise the exposure-effect relationship as properly as for IPF due to the lower number of patients, 
the slower decline in FVC and the lack of additional doses other than 150 mg bid. However, the results 
were consistent with the finding in IPF that plasma exposure to 150 mg bid nintedanib is close to the 
plateau of the maximum drug effect.  
In addition, covariate effects for race, age, weight and gender were similar in patients with SSc-ILD to 
what was observed in previous population PK analyses of patients with IPF. 
By analyzing combined liver enzyme safety laboratory data from SSc-ILD and IPF trials, a positive 
relationship between nintedanib plasma exposure and liver enzyme (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] 
and/or alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) elevations ≥3x upper limit of normal (ULN) was confirmed, as 
already found for IPF patients. On top of the exposure-related risk (covering known factors leading to 
exposure increase such as Asian race, low body weight, or high age), females additionally had a higher 
(exposure-adjusted) risk to experience AST and/or ALT elevations ≥3x ULN, however with a low overall

occurrence of liver enzyme elevation events. There was no difference in the exposure-liver enzyme 
elevation relationship between patients with IPF and SSc-ILD.  
In conclusion, the exposure-response analyses support 150 mg bid as the appropriate therapeutic 
starting dose for patients with SSc-ILD.

Title of Study 
SENSCIS: A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial evaluating efficacy and safety of 
oral nintedanib treatment for at least 52 weeks in patients with ‘Systemic Sclerosis associated 
Interstitial Lung Disease’ (SSc-ILD) 
Methods 
This was a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel design trial. Patients were randomised 
in a 1:1 ratio to nintedanib or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by antitopoisomerase antibody (ATA) 
status (positive or negative). The main efficacy and safety assessments were done until Week 52. 
Individual patients stayed on blinded trial treatment until the last randomised patient reached 52 weeks 
of treatment, but no longer than 100 weeks. Data collected beyond 52 weeks were used in exploratory 
analyses of efficacy and safety. Patients who completed this trial on treatment and attended a follow-up 
visit 28 days after end of treatment could participate in an open-label extension trial 1199.225, in which 
all patients received nintedanib treatment.

Treatments 
Nintedanib is a small molecule that inhibits a distinct spectrum of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and 
non-receptor tyrosine kinases (nRTKs) including VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor), 
PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor), FGFR (fibroblast growth factor receptor), and Src family 
kinases (Src, Lck and Lyn belonging to a family of proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinases). All of these 
growth factor pathways and their down-stream signal cascades have been demonstrated to be involved in 
the pathogenesis of fibrotic tissue remodelling. 
The patient received either active drug at a dosage of 150 mg bid or placebo bid. Trial medication was to 
be taken at the same time every day, i.e. between 06:00 and 11:00 in the morning, and between 18:00 
and 23:00 in the evening. Because nintedanib may cause stomach discomfort, it was recommended to 
take the trial medication with food.  
Dose reduction or treatment interruption 
The dose reduction or treatment interruption were allowed in the study.   
In case of AEs requiring dose reduction between planned visits, an additional site visit was required. 
Nintedanib 100 mg bid (or matching placebo) was assigned via an IRT call from the investigator. The 
colour of capsules (nintedanib 100 mg capsule or corresponding placebo) was slightly different but the 
packaging remained the same, i.e. same number of capsules per blister and same number of blisters per 
wallet.

In case of AEs, the treatment with Nintedanib could be interrupted in line with the recommendation 
presented in the table below: 
Table 13: Allowed treatment reduction or interruption periods of nintedanib 
In the trial, there were specific recommendations for the management of diarrhoea and management of 
liver enzyme elevation. 
Concomitant therapy 
Medication as individually indicated per discretion of the investigator was allowed unless covered by 
medication restrictions as presented in the table below.

Objectives 
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020 
Page 42/119 
 
  
  
 
 
The objective of this trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of nintedanib in the treatment of SSc with 
ILD at a dose of 150 mg twice daily (bid) compared with placebo. 
The primary objective was to demonstrate a reduction in the annual rate of decline in FVC in mL over 52 
weeks in the nintedanib treatment group compared with the placebo group. 
The main secondary objectives were to demonstrate efficacy regarding skin fibrosis as assessed by the 
modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) at Week 52 and to demonstrate an improvement of patient’s 
symptoms as measured by the Saint George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at Week 52. 
Other objectives were to assess safety and tolerability, mortality, the effects on different systemic organ 
manifestations of SSc, pharmacokinetics, and the effects of nintedanib on patient’s perception of the 
disease.

Assessment of forced vital capacity (FVC) 
FVC  was  assessed  with  the  FlowScreen®  spirometer  that  was  supplied  to  all  participating  sites.  Central 
reading was conducted along the 2005 ATS/ERS (American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society) 
Guideline 
Assessment of modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) 
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020

The modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) is an evaluation of the patient’s skin thickness rated by clinical 
palpation using a 0 to 3 scale. The scale differentiates between 0 = normal skin, 1 = mild thickness, 2 = 
moderate thickness, and 3 = severe thickness with inability to pinch the skin into a fold. The palpation is 
done for each of the 17 surface anatomic areas of the body: face, anterior chest, abdomen, fingers (right 
and left separately), forearms, upper arms, thighs, lower legs, dorsum of hands and feet. The sum of these 
individual values is defined as the total skin score [R15-1205]. The mRSS has a range from 0 (no thickening) 
to 51 (severe thickening in all 17 areas). A high score corresponds to worse skin thickness. 
Assessment of Saint George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score 
The Saint George’s Respiratory Questionnaire measures the health status in patients with chronic airflow 
limitation. It consists of 2 parts that cover 3 domains: symptoms, activities, and impacts. The scores of 
these domains range from 0 (no impairment) to 100 (worst possible). 
Assessment of carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLco) 
The sites used their own carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLco) equipment. All measurements were to 
be  conducted  with  the  same  DLco  equipment,  e.g.  if  several  devices  were  available  at  the  site.  Single-
breath DLco was to be carried out according to the ATS/ERS guideline on DLco measurements. 
Assessment of digital ulcers 
Net ulcer burden was defined as the number of new digital ulcers plus the number of digital ulcers that had 
been verified at any earlier assessment during the trial. A digital ulcer was defined as an area of loss of 
continuity of both epithelial coverage and of part of the dermal tissue. If covered by a scab, and there was 
no debridement performed, the decision whether there was an ulcer, with loss of continuity of both epithelial 
coverage and part of the dermal tissue, was according to the investigator’s clinical judgement. Only digital 
ulcers distal to the proximal interphalangeal joints and vascular in origin were assessed. 
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-dyspnoea (FACIT-dyspnoea) 
The FACIT-dyspnoea is a questionnaire that was developed using the National Institutes of Health’s Patient-
Reported  Outcomes  Measurement  Information  System’s  (PROMIS)  database.    Originally  developed  with 
patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), it assesses the shortness of breath and its 
impact  on  10  different  activities  of  daily  living.  Recent  evidence  suggests  that  the  FACIT-dyspnoea  may 
have good measurement properties that are useful for patients with SSc. 
The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)  
The  Health  Assessment  Questionnaire  (HAQ)  is  a  questionnaire  that  has  been  frequently  used  in 
rheumatological  disorders  including  SSc.  The  HAQ  assesses  function  or  activities  of  daily  living  with  20 
items in 8 categories. The 8 categories are: dressing and grooming, hygiene, arising, reach, eating, grip, 
walking, and common daily activities 
Combined Response Index in Systemic Sclerosis (CRISS) 
The  Combined  Response  Index  in  Systemic  Sclerosis  (CRISS)  is  based  on  the  mRSS,  FVC  %  predicted, 
HAQ-DI, patient’s global impression of overall health VAS, and physician’s global impression of patient’s 
overall  health  VAS,  as  well  as  the  absence  of  significant  worsening  of  interstitial  lung  disease,  a  new 
scleroderma renal crisis, left ventricular failure or pulmonary arterial hypertension [R15-1207]. The CRISS 
index score represents a probability of improvement and ranges between 0 and 1. 
EuroQol 5-Dimensional quality of life Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) 
The EQ-5D-5L was developed by the European Quality of Life Group (EuroQol Group) and is a standardised 
instrument used to measure health outcome reflecting the patient’s own judgement. The questionnaire has 
2 parts. The first part consists of 5 areas describing the patient’s health state today. Each area captures 1

Page 44/119 
 
  
  
dimension of health, e.g. mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression. 
Each of these areas is rated on 5 different levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe 
problems, and extreme problems. The patient has to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next 
to the most appropriate statement in each of the five areas. The second part of the questionnaire records 
the patient’s self-rated health status of today on a vertical graduated VAS. The VAS ranges from 0 (“the 
worst health you can imagine”) to 100 (“the best health you can imagine”). 
Sample size 
The estimated treatment difference in the absolute change in FVC in mL over 52 weeks was assumed to be 
between 70 and 110 mL, based on the cyclophosphamide trial in scleroderma lung disease [R14-5407] and 
on the IPF trials INPULSIS-1 and INPULSIS-2 [P14-07514]. 
Note that FVC % predicted had been converted to mL using the approximate relationship of 1% = 35 mL 
based  on  the IPF  results that  were presented  in  both %  predicted  and  mL.  An equal  standard  deviation 
across treatment groups of 245 mL (based on the cyclophosphamide trial) and a 1:1 randomisation was 
assumed. The sample size calculations in Table 9.7.2: 1 were done based on a 2-sided, 2-sample superiority 
t-test, with a significance level of 5% and power of either 80% or 90% 
The  first  key  secondary  endpoints  of  the  absolute  change  from  baseline  in  the  mRSS  at  Week  52  and 
absolute change from baseline in the SGRQ total score at Week 52 were also considered in sample size 
calculation.  
Randomisation 
Patients  were  randomised  in  blocks  to  double-blind  treatment.  The  randomization  was  stratified  by  ATA 
status (positive or negative) within the IRT system. Equal numbers of patients were randomised to each 
treatment  group  (i.e.  a  1:1  randomisation  was  used).  BI  will  arrange  for  the  randomization  and  the 
packaging and labelling of trial medication. The randomisation list was generated using a validated system, 
which involved a pseudo-random number generator so that the resulting treatment was both reproducible 
and non-predictable. The block size was documented in the clinical trial report. Access to the codes was 
controlled and documented. All members of the clinical trial team remained blinded to the randomization 
schedule until the final database is locked. The independent DMC had at any time the possibility to look at 
unblinded data according to the DMC charter. 
Blinding (masking) 
That trial was a double-blind trial. Trial medication was identified by a medication code number. Packaging 
and labelling were otherwise identical. The booklet cover page for 150 mg and 100 mg nintedanib and the 
respective corresponding placebo was differently coloured. Colour, size and shape of nintedanib and placebo 
capsules were indistinguishable within dose strength but were different between dose strengths. 
Patients, investigators and everyone involved in trial conduct or analysis or with any other interest in this 
double-blind  trial  (apart  from  the  DMC)  remained  blinded  with  regard  to  the  randomised  treatment 
assignments until  after  database  lock.  The  randomization  code  was  kept  secret  by  the  sponsor’s  clinical 
trial support up to database lock. 
Statistical methods 
Hypotheses testing 
The primary and the key secondary endpoints were analysed in a hierarchical testing procedure to protect 
the type I error rate. The general aim was to test the superiority of treatment with nintedanib 150 mg bid 
over treatment with placebo. Each step was only considered confirmatory if all the previous steps had been 
successful.  If  the  previous  step  was  not  successful,  i.e.  the  null  hypothesis  was  not  rejected,  then  the 
procedure stopped and the analysis of the current endpoint (and any subsequent endpoints) was considered

descriptive  only.  The  procedure  started  with  the  primary  endpoint  and  tested  first  for  a  statistically 
significant difference of the annual rate of decline in FVC. The procedure proceeded to the key secondary 
endpoints only if statistical significance was proven for FVC in favour of nintedanib. Subsequently, it was 
planned to test the change from baseline in mRSS,  followed by the change from baseline in SGRQ total 
score. 
Primary analyses 
The primary analysis was a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based approach using a random slope 
and intercept model. The analysis compared the annual rate of decline in FVC in mL between the nintedanib 
and  placebo  groups  over  52  weeks  of  treatment.  The  statistical  model  included  treatment,  ATA  status 
(positive or negative), and gender as fixed, categorical effects. Time, baseline FVC [mL], age, and height, 
as  well  as  the  treatment-by-time  and  baseline-by-time  interactions  were  included  as  fixed,  continuous 
effects. Random effects were included for the patient response for time and intercept. The ATA status of 
the patients was analysed as reported in the CRF. 
Analyses of the key secondary endpoints 
The key secondary endpoints of the absolute change from baseline in mRSS at Week 52, and the absolute 
change  from  baseline  in  the  SGRQ  total  score  at  Week  52,  were  analysed  using  a  restricted  maximum 
likelihood  (REML)-based  mixed  model  repeated  measures  (MMRM)  approach.  The  analyses  included  the 
fixed, categorical effects of treatment, ATA status, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the 
continuous, fixed covariate of baseline-byvisit interaction. An unstructured variance-covariance structure 
was used to model the withinpatient measurements. 
Analyses of the other secondary endpoints 
Any p-values presented for the secondary endpoints (with the exception of the key secondary endpoints) 
were considered nominal in nature and no adjustment for multiplicity was made. 
Data handling 
In  the  analyses  over  52  weeks,  all  available  data  were  used,  including  data  collected  after  premature 
discontinuation of trial medication. Follow-up visit data were excluded, except for patients who prematurely 
discontinued  trial  medication.  The  statistical  models  used  for  analysing  the  primary  endpoint  and  key 
secondary endpoints allowed for missing data, assuming they were missing at random. Sensitivity analyses 
using  different  assumptions  were  conducted  to  investigate  the  potential  effect  of  data  handling  and  the 
analysis  model  on  the  results  of  the  main  analysis.  In  the  analysis  of  all  other  continuous  secondary 
endpoints, missing data were not imputed. In the analysis of time to death, missing or incomplete data 
were handled using censoring as detailed in the TSAP. In the analysis of the binary endpoints, patients with 
missing data were considered as non-responders, i.e. worst-case analysis. In addition, post-hoc analyses 
using the worst value carried forward method to impute missing data were conducted.  
Patients  were  analysed  according  to  their  planned  treatment  group,  i.e.  corresponding  to  the  treatment 
group allocated during randomisation by IRT. Generally, the last assessment or measurement before the 
date of first trial drug intake (included) was used as baseline. 
Analysis sets 
The relevant analysis set for the efficacy evaluation was the treated set; additionally, the definitions for the 
screened and randomised sets are given below: 
• 
Screened  set:  The  screened  set  included  all  patients  who  signed  the  informed  consent  and 
performed Visit 1 
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020 
Page 46/119 
 
  
  
Randomised set (RS): The randomised set comprised all randomised patients, whether treated or 
• 
not 
• 
Treated set (TS): The treated set consisted of patients who were randomised to a treatment group 
and received at least 1 dose of trial medication. The efficacy analyses were conducted on the TS 
Subgroup analyses 
For the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoints, selected efficacy analyses were done only in 
subgroups  with  >20 patients  in  both  treatment  groups within  each  category  of  the  subgroup.  The  TSAP 
specified the following subgroup analyses for efficacy: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
ATA status (positive/negative) 
Gender (male/female) 
Age (<65 years/≥65 years) 
Race (White/Asian/Black or African American)  
Region (Asia/Europe/Canada and United States/rest of the world) 
Mycophenolate mofetil/sodium use at baseline (yes/no) 
SSc subtype (diffuse cutaneous SSc/limited cutaneous SSc) 
For each subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint, the heterogeneity of the treatment effect on the slope 
across subgroups was tested: a random slope and intercept mixed model was fitted based on the statistical 
model for the primary analysis considering the treatment-by-subgroup and treatment-by-subgroup-by-time 
interaction  terms.  A  contrast  statement,  with  appropriate  contrasts,  was  used  to  conduct  an  F-test  of 
heterogeneity across all levels of the subgrouping at Week 52. The level at which p-values were considered 
nominally significant was 5%.  
In the subgroup analysis of the key secondary endpoints using MMRM models, a similar approach as for the 
primary endpoint was used: a single MMRM model was fitted involving all model terms from the primary 
analysis model except replacing the treatment-by-visit term by treatment-by-subgroup-by-visit. 
Results 
Overall, 580 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to nintedanib 150 mg bid or placebo. 
Over  52  weeks,  19.4%  of  patients  in  the  nintedanib  group  and  10.8%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group 
prematurely  discontinued  treatment.  The  most  frequent  reason  for  premature  treatment  discontinuation 
was ‘other AEs’, i.e. AEs not related to worsening of disease under study (10.8% nintedanib, 5.6% placebo). 
Recruitment 
Conduct of the study 
A total of 3 global and 5 local amendments were issued. 
Main changes are discussed below  
Global Amendment 1 (02 Mar 2016) 
For Inclusion Criterion No. 5, the reference time point for the historical HRCT, which had to be performed 
within 12 months, was changed from Visit 2 to Visit 1, as Visit 1 represented the better predictable time 
point 
• 
Exclusion Criterion No. 8 was updated to clarify that not only digital ulcers but also severe other 
ulcers could have led to the exclusion of a patient at the discretion of the investigator 
Assessment report

• 
• 
• 
• 
Exclusion Criterion No. 12 was updated to clarify that also severe gastrointestinal symptoms due 
to SSc could have led to the exclusion of a patient 
Exclusion  Criterion  No.  25  was  added  based  on  advice  from  regulatory  agencies:  patients  with 
underlying chronic liver disease (Child Pugh A, B, C hepatic impairment) 
The restrictions regarding concomitant treatment with corticosteroids were modified. Patients on 
low  dose  corticosteroid  therapy  were  eligible  for  the  trial  even  if  the  dose  of  the  corticosteroid 
medication was not stable 
The description of the method of measuring DLco was harmonised within the CTP, by removal of 
the adjustments for altitude and carboxyhaemoglobin incorrectly mentioned in one section of the 
CTP 
Global Amendment 2 (26 Jan 2017) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Inclusion Criterion No. 4 was revised and the requested SSc disease onset (defined by first non-
Raynaud  symptom)  had  to  occur  within  7  years  instead  of  5  years  of  Visit  1.  This  change  was 
introduced to facilitate recruitment into the trial, without compromising the characterisation of the 
trial population 
For  Exclusion  Criterion  No.  4,  the  reference  time  point  to  assess  eligibility  regarding  airway 
obstruction  (pre-bronchodilator  FEV1/FVC  <0.7)  was  changed  from  Visit  1  to  Visit  2  to  ensure 
consistency with all other lung function criteria 
Exclusion Criterion No. 26 was added: patients with a history of SSc renal crisis 
The  absolute  change  from  baseline  at  Week  52  in  CRISS  index  score  was  added  as  secondary 
endpoint and removed from the list of further endpoints; however, the TSAP defined to analyse the 
proportion of responders instead of the absolute change from baseline  
The ATA status and baseline FVC% predicted were included as covariates in the analysis of the rate 
of decline in FVC in % predicted 
Global Amendment 3 (15 Feb 2018) 
The following main changes in the conduct of the trial were introduced by the amendment: 
• 
• 
The end of trial for patients on-treatment as well as for patients who prematurely discontinued trial 
medication and attended visits as planned was clarified. Details regarding the time point of the EOT 
Visit and requirements for Follow-up Visits were added. 
The  restrictions  regarding  concomitant  treatment  were  modified.  The  definition  of  clinically 
significant deterioration was extended to other clinical parameters than mRSS and FVC 
•  Clarification  that  based  on  the  half-life  of  the  trial  drug,  a  safety  analysis  restricted  to  AEs  that 
occurred between the start of treatment and up to 7 days after the date of the last dose of trial 
medication were analysed in addition 
Protocol deviations 
Important protocol deviations (iPDs) were those protocol deviations that could potentially impact on the 
efficacy assessments or the patients’ rights or safety. Important protocol deviations were pre-defined in 
the  TSAP  and  assessed  before  the  locking  and  unblinding  of  data;  note  that  the  term  ‘deviation’  is  a 
synonym for ‘violation’, which is used in the TSAP. As no per protocol set was defined in trial 1199.214, 
none of the iPDs led to exclusion of patients from any analyses.  
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020

Over  52  weeks,  18.9%  of  patients  were  reported  with  iPDs.  The  proportion  of  patients  with  iPDs  was 
generally  similar  in  both  treatment  groups.  The  most  common  categories  of  iPDs  were  related  to  trial 
medication and randomisation as well as exclusion criteria.  
The use of prohibited concomitant therapies between baseline and Week 52, considered as iPD, was low. 
Prohibited concomitant medications were taken by 3 patients overall.

Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics were generally similar in both treatment groups. The majority of patients 
(75.2%) were women. The largest proportion of patients was White (67.2%), followed by Asian patients 
(24.8%); with a smaller proportion of Asian patients in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group 
(21.5% vs. 28.1%). The mean (SD) age was 54.0 (12.2) years.

Systemic sclerosis characteristics 
The SSc characteristics were comparable between the treatment groups. The mean (SD) time since onset 
of the first non-Raynaud symptom was 3.49 (1.70) years. About three-quarters of patients had the onset 
of the first non-Raynaud symptom between >1 to ≤5 years (76.4% nintedanib, 71.5% placebo). Overall, 
51.9% of patients had diffuse cutaneous SSc and 48.1% of patients had limited cutaneous SSc. The 
majority of patients (60.8%) was positive for ATA. The mean (SD) extent of fibrosis on HRCT, as 
determined by centralised over-read, was 36.0% (21.3).

Baseline efficacy characteristics  
The baseline efficacy variables were generally balanced across the treatment groups. The mean baseline 
FVC was lower for nintedanib (2458.5 mL) than for placebo (2541.0 mL). 
However, the difference between the groups was smaller when considering the median FVC values 
(2361.0 mL nintedanib, 2402.0 mL placebo), and the mean FVC % predicted at baseline was similar in 
the 2 treatment groups (72.4% nintedanib, 72.7% placebo).

Outcomes and estimation 
•  Primary endpoint - the adjusted annual rate of decline in FVC over 52 weeks 
The adjusted annual rate of decline in FVC over 52 weeks was lower in the nintedanib group (-52.4 
mL/year) than in the placebo group (-93.3 mL/year). The adjusted difference between the treatment 
groups was 40.95 mL/year (95% CI 2.88, 79.01) with a statistically significant p-value of 0.0350. This 
corresponded to a relative treatment effect of 43.8% reduction in FVC decline compared to placebo.

weeks - TS 
The annual rate of decline in FVC over the whole trial (up to 100 weeks) 
The annual rate of decline in FVC over the whole trial in the originally planned analysis, including post 
treatment data, was -62.3 mL/year in the nintedanib group and -86.0 mL/year in the placebo group, with 
the estimated treatment difference of 23.71 mL/year (95% CI -5.77, 53.18). This was considered by the 
applicant as overly conservative estimate of the effect of taking nintedanib. The annual rate of decline in 
FVC over the whole trial based on the post-hoc analysis, including only on-treatment data, was -55.1 
mL/year in the nintedanib group and -94.0 mL/year in the placebo group, resulting in a treatment 
difference of 38.85 mL/year (95% CI 5.56, 72.14). 
Secondary endpoints: 
•  Key secondary endpoint: absolute change from baseline in mRSS at Week 52 
The adjusted mean absolute change from baseline in mRSS at Week 52 was -2.17 in the nintedanib group 
compared with -1.96 in the placebo group. The adjusted mean difference between the groups at Week 52 
was -0.21 (95% CI -0.94, 0.53) and not statistically significant with p = 0.5785

•  Key secondary endpoint: absolute change from baseline in SGRQ total score at Week 52 
The adjusted mean absolute change from baseline in SGRQ total score at Week 52 was 0.81in the 
nintedanib group and -0.88 in the placebo group. The adjusted mean difference between the groups was 
1.69 (95% CI -0.73, 4.12; p = 0.1711).

•  Secondary endpoint: CRISS at Week 52 
The CRISS index represents the probability of patient improvement. For patients considered not improved 
over 52 weeks, based on new onset of scleroderma renal crisis, pulmonary hypertension, or left 
ventricular failure, or relative decline in FVC % predicted from baseline at Week 52 of ≥15% and FVC % 
predicted <80% at Week 52, the CRISS index score is set to 0.  For the majority of patients, the CRISS 
index score was close to 0 (58.3% nintedanib, 63.9% placebo). The proportion of responders based on 
CRISS at Week 52 was similar in each treatment group. No difference was seen in the odds ratio between 
the nintedanib and the placebo group. This result is consistent with the lack of treatment effect of 
nintedanib seen for the mRSS.

•  Secondary endpoint: Absolute change from baseline in DLco [% predicted] at Week 52 
The absolute change form baseline in DLco in % predicted at Week 52 was comparable between the 
nintedanib and the placebo group.

•  Categorical changes in FVC over 52 weeks 
To further investigate the effect of nintedanib on lung function, the proportions of patients with a relative 
decline in FVC [mL] and an absolute decline in FVC % predicted of >5% and >10%, respectively, at Week 
52 were analysed. Two types of analyses were conducted for these endpoints. 
In the planned analysis, which classified patients with missing data as non-responders, i.e. as patients 
that progressed, the proportion of patients with a relative decline from baseline in FVC [mL] of >5% at 
Week 52 was numerically lower in the nintedanib group (40.6%) than in the placebo group (48.3%); the 
odds ratio was 0.73 (95% CI 0.53, 1.02; p-value = 0.0663), 
Using a cut-off of >10%, no relevant difference was seen in the proportion of patients between the 
nintedanib group (27.8%) and the placebo group (26.4%), with an odds ratio of 1.07 (95% CI 0.74, 
1.55; p-value = 0.7036). 
In the post hoc analysis, using the worst value carried forward approach, for the relative decline from 
baseline in FVC [mL], a lower proportion of patients in the nintedanib group had a relative decline of >5% 
at Week 52 compared to the placebo group. The proportion of patients with a relative decline >10% was 
comparable between the treatment groups. Similar results were obtained in the post hoc analysis for the 
absolute decline from baseline in FVC [% predicted] at Week 52. The proportion of patients with an 
absolute decline >5% was lower in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group, whereas at the >10% 
threshold the proportions of patients in each treatment group were comparable.

absolute decline since baseline [% predicted] greater than 5% or 10% at Week 52 – TS (worst 
observation carried forward-post hoc analysis) 
•  Further endpoints: patient reported outcomes and visual analogue scales 
Generally, no relevant change from baseline was noticeable for the assessed patient reported outcomes, 
based on questionnaires and the VAS scores, over 52 weeks. There were no meaningful treatment 
differences between the nintedanib and placebo group. 
The VAS score indicating limitations in daily activities due to intestinal problems, the absolute change 
from baseline slightly increased over time in the nintedanib group whereas no change was seen in the 
placebo group. These results are consistent with the observation of a higher proportion of patients in the 
nintedanib group reported with gastrointestinal AEs. 
The proportion of SGRQ non-responders, i.e. patients with absolute change from baseline in SGRQ total 
score ≥4 points, was larger in the nintedanib group (49.7%) than in the placebo group (41.0%), with and 
odds ratio of 1.42 [95% CI 1.02, 1.97], p = 0.0374).

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
For this application, the MAH submitted one pivotal study (1199.214). The MAH claimed that recruitment 
for two adequate and well-controlled adequately powered studies was unlikely to be feasible in this limited 
target  patient  population  in  an  acceptable  time.  In  addition,  one  study  approach  was  justified  by  the 
applicant by the fact that the similarities of pathophysiologies resulting in the same pro-fibrotic cascade as 
has been described in regard to SSc-ILD and IPF. 
Assessment report

Study 1199.214 was a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel design trial in which patients 
were  randomised  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  nintedanib  or  placebo.  Randomisation  was  stratified  by  anti-topo 
isomerase  antibody  (ATA)  status  (positive or  negative).  The  main efficacy  and  safety  assessments  were 
done until Week 52. The data collected beyond 52 weeks were used in exploratory analyses of efficacy and 
safety. 
Patients enrolled to this study had systemic sclerosis within 7 years of onset (defined by first non-Raynaud 
symptom). It is known that the most rapid decline in lung function occurs within the first three years of 
disease therefore enrolment of patients in an earlier stage of SSc and pulmonary fibrosis was recommended 
to the applicant during the scientific advice.  
In relation to the disease severity, the extent of fibrotic disease in the lung had to be ≥10% on HRCT, FVC 
had to be ≥40% predicted and DLco 30% to 89% of predicted. These inclusion criteria allowed for enrolment 
of patients with mild to severe degrees of functional impairment e.g patients with limited and also extensive 
disease according to the criteria established by Goh 2008 could be enrolled  
It  is  noted  that  patients  with  significant  pulmonary  hypertension  (right  heart  failure,  cardiac  index  ≤2 
L/min/m²  and  parenteral  therapy  with  epoprostenol/treprostinil)  as  well  as  patients  with  significant 
vasculopathies (>3 digital ulcers) were excluded from the study.  
There were no specific inclusion criteria with regards to skin fibrosis and level of symptoms reported by 
patients.  
In  the  study  patients  received  either  Nintedanib  at  a  dosage  of  150  mg  bid  or  placebo  bid.  The  dose 
reduction to 100 mg bid or treatment interruptions were allowed in the study.  
No formal dose finding study was performed in patients with Systemic Sclerosis associated Interstitial Lung 
Disease (SSc-ILD).  
A dose of nintedanib 150 mg bid was selected for this trial, was based on the efficacy, safety, and dose-
finding  results  from  trials  investigating  nintedanib  in  IPF,  i.e.  the  trials  TOMORROW,  INPULSIS  I  and 
INPULSIS II. 
There was no comparator in this study. The use of placebo-controlled design is considered acceptable as 
there are no therapies mandated (or approved) for SSc-ILD according to the EULAR treatment guidelines.  
In this guideline cyclophosphamide is only recommended for consideration however, due to its toxicity, this 
medication is not suitable for long term use.  
Stable therapy with mycophenolate mofetil/sodium or methotrexate or low dose of Prednisone (≤10 mg) 
were  permitted  in  the  study.  The  treatment  with  other  medications  used  for  SSc-ILD  including 
Cyclophosphamide, Azathioprine and Ciclosporine A were not permitted except for deterioration. 
The primary endpoint of this study was the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) which is 
considered acceptable. The same primary endpoint was used in the pivotal study investigating the effect of 
nintedanib in the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). In addition, decline in FVC was found to 
be a good predictor of mortality in studies investigating survival in patients with SSc-ILD. Absolute change 
from  baseline  in  DLco  at  Week  52  (another  pulmonary  function  test)  was  investigated  as  a  secondary 
endpoint in this study. 
In the study there were two key primary endpoints - change from baseline in modified Rodnan Skin Score 
(mRSS) and change from baseline Saint George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). 
The  assessment  of  Saint  George’s  Respiratory  Questionnaire  (SGRQ)  is  considered  to  be  a  particularly 
important  secondary  endpoint.  Although  not  specifically  designed  for  scleroderma,  the  Saint  George's 
Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) was used in the literature as respiratory-specific questionnaire for the 
evaluation  of  health-related  quality  of  life  in  patients  with  SSc-related  ILD.  The  assessment  of  the 
Assessment report

improvement  in  patient  functional  status  in  addition  to  the  assessment  of  lung  function  parameters  is 
considered to be important taking into consideration that nintedanib is long-term treatment with notable 
side effects (e.g. diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting).   
In the study there were a few other secondary endpoints which investigated patients reported outcomes 
including  FACIT-dyspnoea  score,  Health  Assessment  Questionnaire-Disability  Index,  Scleroderma  Health 
Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ) and EQ-5D-5L VAS.  
Modified Rodnan Skin Score was used to investigate the effect of nintedanib on skin fibrosis. The potential 
effects of nintedanib on the vasculature was investigated through the assessment of changes from baseline 
in digital ulcer net burden at Week 52. 
Time to death was investigated as other secondary endpoint.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study design/study population 
Overall, 580 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to nintedanib 150 mg bid or placebo. The majority of 
patients  randomized  completed  study  (>84%).  However,  the  discontinuation  rate  was  higher  in  the 
nintedanib group as compared to the placebo group (19.4% and 10.8% of patients respectively). The main 
reason for discontinuation was other AEs’, i.e. AEs not related to worsening of disease under study (10.8% 
nintedanib, 5.6% placebo). 
In  line  with  the  literature  findings,  patients  with  SSc-associated  ILD  are  more  commonly  women 
(approximately  80%)  between  the  ages  of  30  and  55.  The  enrolled  pupation  reflects  these  literature 
findings. The majority of patients were women (75.2%). The mean age of enrolled patients was 54.0 years. 
Overall,  67.2%  of  patients  were  White,  24.8%  Asian,  6.3%  Black  or  African  American,  0.9%  American 
Indian or Alaska Native, 0.2% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and 0.7% of multiple race. In total, 
6.9% of patients were of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. 
Patients  enrolled  where  in  an  earlier  stage  of  SSc  and  pulmonary  fibrosis  as  recommended  during  the 
scientific advice since the most rapid decline in lung function occurs within the first three years of disease.   
In relation to systemic sclerosis characteristics 7% of patients enrolled were within 1 year since the first 
non-Raynaud symptom of SSc, 35% within 1- 3 years and 38% within 3-5 years of onset of the first non-
Raynaud symptom of SSc. The mean time since SSc-associated ILD diagnosis was 2.63 years. 
60.8%  of  randomised  patients  had  anti-topoisomerase  antibodies.  Anti-topoisomerase  Antibody  (ATA) 
positivity  has  been  associated  with  ILD  and  has  been  reported  to  be  a  predictor  of  FVC  decline  in  SSc 
patients. Anti-ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase III antibodies were positive in 8.5% of patients and anti-
centromere antibodies were positive in 7.1% of patients. 
At baseline the mean FVC % predicted was 72.5% whereas the mean DLco % predicted was 53.03%.  
Results 
For this pivotal study, the primary endpoint was met. In patients receiving treatment with nintedanib for 
52 weeks a significantly lower annual rate of decline in FVC was reported as compared to patients on the 
placebo. The adjusted difference between the treatment groups was 40.95 mL/year (95% CI 2.88, 79.01) 
with a statistically significant p-value of 0.0350. This corresponded to a relative treatment effect of 43.8% 
reduction in FVC decline compared to placebo.  
However, the difference between groups (45.95 ml/year) recorded in this study was lower as compared to 
the difference reported studies investigating the treatment in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis 
(IPF). In trials INPULSIS-1, INPULSIS-2 (pooled data) the observed difference between the treatment and 
placebo group was 109.9 ml.

The assessment of the annual rate of decline in FVC over the whole trial (up to 100 weeks) which was an 
exploratory endpoint in the study showed a smaller difference between the treatment groups (e.g 23.71 
mL/year) as compared to the difference recorded at week 52.  
In the post-hoc analysis, including only on-treatment data (the least conservative approach), the difference 
between groups was 38.85 mL/year. 
The following subgroup analyses were performed: ATA status (positive/negative), Gender (male/female), 
Age (<65 years/≥65 years), Race (White/Asian/Black or African American), Region (Asia/Europe/Canada 
and United States/rest of the world) Mycophenolate mofetil/sodium use at baseline (yes/no), SSc subtype 
(diffuse cutaneous SSc or limited cutaneous SSc). 
The applicant was requested to present the treatment effects depending on the severity of the disease and 
time from onset.  The data were provided for the following subgroups: by time from onset (≤2 years/>2 
years and ≤3 years/>3 years since onset of first non-Raynaud symptom), extent of fibrosis in the lung at 
baseline  (<20%/≥20%,  based  on  HRCT),  baseline  FVC  %  predicted  (<70%/≥70%),  baseline  DLco  % 
predicted (≤55%/>55%), and baseline C-reactive protein (CRP; normal/increased). 
For the presented above subgroups no significant differences in the treatment effects were observed. The 
direction  of  effect  estimates  for  all  these  analysed  subgroups  was  consistent  with  the  overall  effect. 
Treatment /by subgroups interactions were not statistically significant. 
Further  to  the  Major  Objections  raised,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  discuss  on  the  reported  modest 
effect on FVC (41 ml difference as compared to placebo) in patients with SSc-associated ILD treated with 
Nintedanib.  
In  the  response,  the  applicant  highlighted  that  ILD  in  patients  with  SSc  is  progressing  more  slowly  as 
compared to patients with IPF. In the placebo group of the pooled INPULSIS trials (patients with IPF), the 
rate of decline in FVC over 52 weeks was -224 mL/year whereas this rate in the placebo group in SENSCIS 
study (in patients with SSc-ILD) was smaller e.g 93 mL/year. Therefore, it could be understandable that a 
smaller  treatment  effect  (in  absolute  terms)  was  seen  in  SENSCIS  study  (SSc-ILD)  as  compared  to 
INPULSIS trials (IPF). However, a similar relative reduction in the annual FVC decline was observed for both 
SSc-ILD and IPF patients.   
The applicant clarified also that the prespecified analysis included also FVC follow-up data collected 28 days 
after  end  of  trial  treatment.    For  this  reason,  it  can  be  agreed  with  the  applicant  that  this  prespecified 
analysis was over-conservative.  
Thus,  the  post  hoc  analysis  (Analysis  2  -  Post  treatment  data  of  patients  who  completed  treatment- 
excluded in 100 weeks analysis) was considered a better reflection of the treatment effect as no FVC follow-
up data collected 28 days after the end of trial treatment were included in this analysis. This second analysis 
showed an adjusted treatment difference in the annual rate of decline of 34.0 mL/year (95% CI 3.4, 64.5).  
The  treatment  difference  in  the  annual  rate  of  decline  (Nintedanib  versus  placebo)  for  100  weeks  was 
slightly smaller as reported for 52 weeks (41 ml).  
The  adjusted  rate  decline  in  the  Nintedanib  group  was  similar  for  both  52  and  100  weeks  period  (- 
52.4ml/year  of  decline  for  52  weeks  and  –  54.9  ml/year  decline  calculated  based  on  100  weeks  data) 
suggesting that, based on the available limited data, no substantial loss of the treatment effect occurs over 
time. A categorical decline in FVC of ≥10% was found predictive of mortality, especially in patients with 
extensive lung fibrosis. The proportion of patients with a relative decline from baseline in FVC [mL] of >5% 
at Week 52 was numerically lower in the nintedanib group (40.6%) than in the placebo group (48.3%); the 
odds ratio was 0.73 (95% CI 0.53, 1.02; p-value =  0.0663). Using a cut-off of >10%, no relevant difference 
was  seen  in  the  proportion  of  patients  between  the  nintedanib  group  (27.8%)  and  the  placebo  group 
(26.4%), with an odds ratio of 1.07 (95% CI 0.74, 1.55; p-value = 0.7036).

Categorical declines in FVC have been associated in IPF with reduced survival time in observational cohorts. 
Importantly, not only absolute declines in FVC % predicted ≥10% were associated with an increased risk of 
death, but also declines ≥5% [P18-04750] as well as relative declines ≥10%. 
The  applicant  claimed  that  these  observations  made  in  the  population  of  patients  with  IPF  could  be 
extrapolated  to  patients  with  SSc-ILD  and  therefore  argued  that  the  observed  improvements  in  the 
proportions of patients with >5/10% relative decline in FVC [mL] and >5/10% absolute decline in FVC % 
predicted in the nintedanib group as compared to the placebo group is likely to lead to the improvement of 
survival of SSc-ILD patients.  
In addition, the applicant presented the data which link continuous declines in FVC with increased mortality 
in SSc-ILD, providing further evidence that decline in FVC in SSc is heterogeneous but is per se detrimental 
and associated with an increased risk of death. 
The CHMP considered that extrapolation of potential survival benefits from IPF to SSc-ILD required some 
caution especially for patients with early stage of the disease. The following differences between IPF and 
SSc-ILD are noted: 
•  SSc-ILD is much more heterogeneous disease as compared to IPF and the progression pattern in 
SSc-ILD and IPF is different. 
• 
The disease progression in SSc-ILD is normally not as fast as in the IPF i.e in IPF median survival 
time is 3 to 5 years after diagnosis whereas in SSc-ILD median survival time  is between 5 to 8 
years and up to 11 years. For this reason, it considered that a longer follow up of SSc-ILD 
patients might be required since the pivotal study for SSc-ILD was designed with only 1 year 
follow up. 
•  SSc-ILD is an autoimmune disease and treatments targeting this aspect of the disease are also 
likely to be important for survival. It is noted that the efficacy (FVC annual decline) was more 
evident in the population concomitantly treated with the mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). 
Additionally, an observed decrease in the annual decline in FVC reported in the nintedanib group was not 
linked to any improvement in patient reported outcomes. In fact, there was a trend towards reduction of 
the quality of life in patients on nintedanib as compared to those on placebo. For SGRQ total score (which 
was  the  key  secondary  endpoint  in  the  study),  HAQ-DI  score  and  FACIT  dyspnoea  score,  the  difference 
between groups was not statistically significant.  In addition, no improvement or even a small deterioration 
from baseline was noticeable in the nintedanib group for other assessed patient reported outcomes, based 
on  questionnaires  and  the  VAS  scores,  over  52  weeks.  Furthermore,  the  proportion  of  SGRQ  non-
responders, i.e. patients with absolute change from baseline in SGRQ total score ≥4 points, was larger in 
the nintedanib group (49.7%) than in the placebo group (41.0%), with and odds ratio of 1.42. 
Nintedanib had no effect on the skin fibrosis. No significant changes between the groups were reported for 
the modified Rodnan Skin Score -the adjusted mean difference was -0.21 (95% CI -0.94, 0.53, p = 0.5785). 
Also no changes from baseline was observed for the digital ulcer net burden at Week 52. 
No  statistically  significant  difference  was  observed  for  the  absolute  change  form  baseline  in  DLco  in  % 
predicted at Week 52 however, numerally higher decline in DLco was reported in the nintedanib group. The 
adjusted mean absolute change from baseline in DLCO % predicted at Week 52 was -3.21% predicted in 
the nintedanib  group  compared  with -2.77 %  predicted  in  the  placebo  group.  It  has  been  reported  that 
declining DL,CO is the single most significant marker of poor outcome (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2002; 
165: 1581–1586).  
Over in the whole trial, 10 patients (3.5%) in the nintedanib group and 9 patients (3.1%) in the placebo 
group died. There are no differences in the time to death over the whole trial (p=0.7535)

In addition, the applicant was requested to present subgroup analysis in patients with pulmonary 
hypertension at baseline.  Patients with mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension could be enrolled to 
the pivotal study however, patients with severe pulmonary hypertension were excluded. 
In  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  pulmonary  hypertension  receiving  a  nintedanib 
significantly higher decline was reported (-150 ml/year) as comparing to patients on placebo (-39 ml/year)  
As indicated by the applicant there were 23 patients in the nintedanib group and 29 patients in the placebo 
group categorised as having mild to moderate to pulmonary hypertension at baseline.   
In view of the concerns and uncertainties above described, the CHMP considered the need for an expert 
consultation in order to conclude on the benefit risk of nintedanib. The ad-hoc Expert Group convened on 
22th January 2020 and the minutes and answers are presented hereafter: 
Additional expert consultation 
1.  Do the experts believe that there is a true clinical relevance of the effect seen on FVC of 
41 mls for this claimed population? What is their opinion on a MCID for clinically 
meaningful improvement or decline, as reported by the MAH? 
The experts acknowledged that there indeed isn’t an adequate endpoint, biomarker, questionnaire, imaging 
technique, etc. that would allow for a reliable treatment evaluation in the population diagnosed with SSc-
ILD. Hence, the measurements of forced vital capacity (FVC), as proposed and conducted by the applicant 
in the clinical trial are currently the commonly used indicators of efficacy, taking account the limitations, 
such as the fact that FVC was originally validated as an endpoint for other lung diseases.  
In the pivotal study, the clinical endpoint of FVC annual decline was met and was considered meaningful. 
Of note, the efficacy (FVC annual decline) was more evident in the population concomitantly treated with 
the  mycophenolate  mofetil  (mycophenolate)  and  this  treatment  option  (add  on,  sub-sequential)  should 
remain open. The experts were initially unsure of the total relevance of the effect size reached in the FVC, 
but  overall  and  by  broad  consensus,  they  concluded  that  the  effect  seen  on  the  FVC  is  sufficient  and 
important, as it indicative of the slowing of disease progression. The representative of patients thought that 
since SSc-ILD is a progressive disease, even the 41ml per year effect on the FVC is important, as the aim 
is to avoid worsening of the disease.  
The  experts  also  commented  on  the  Quality  of  Life  (QoL)  measure,  which  was  assessed  using  the  St. 
George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGQR). Although the impact of Ofev on the QoL was not overwhelming, 
the  experts  acknowledged  that  this  tool  is  not  the  most  appropriate  for  the  current  setting  as  it  was 
developed for COPD assessment, but at the time of trial conduct, other measures of QoL were not validated 
for SSc-ILD. In addition, other important factors such as occurrence of ADRs and their dynamic over time 
influence patient’s QoL, so an overall definitive conclusion on SSc-ILD population cannot be drawn and the 
physician should asses each patient individually.   
2.  The extrapolation from IPF to SSc-ILD population requires caution. SSc-ILD is much more 
heterogeneous disease as compared to IPF and the progression pattern in SSc-ILD and 
IPF is different. The experts are asked whether any extrapolation of effect can be allowed 
from the IPF population where a more pronounced effect was demonstrated. 
The  experts  were  of  the  opinion  that  extrapolation  exercise  can  be  applied  in  case  both  diseases  are 
progressing, ideally over a period of 2-3 years. It was acknowledged that the disease progression in SSc-
ILD is normally not as fast as in the IPF. The limitation of the pivotal study is that it was designed for SSc-
ILD with only 1 year follow up. Another difference to keep in mind is the fact that SSc-ILD is an autoimmune 
disease and the treatment should target this aspect before reaching the late/end stage of the diseases.  
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020 
Page 71/119 
 
  
  
In summary, there are several common aspects between the conditions, which to certain extend can be 
extrapolated, as long as the specificities of the early and later stage of the diseases are taken into account. 
Ofev can have a place in the disease management as add on or sequential treatment after lung disease 
progression identification on the established treatment (MMF, anti-inflammatory, etc.). The experts agreed 
that an indication with a cut-off boundary for disease progression (e.g. >10% fibrosis) would not appear 
best  for  clinical  practice.  While  this  the  information  could  be  provided  in  the  SmPC  and/or  EPAR,  the 
treatment decision should take into account the extent of the fibrosis but allow for a holistic decision based 
on the individual patient’s overall status.    
3.  The  subgroup  of  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  pulmonary  hypertension  at  baseline 
receiving  nintedanib  showed  a  significantly  higher  decline  in  FVC  (-150  ml/year)  as 
compared  to  the  FVC  decline  in  the  placebo  group  (-39  ml/year).  As  pulmonary 
hypertension  can  occur  with  progression  of  disease,  there  is  a  concern  that  this 
subpopulation would have a less favourable outcome. The experts are asked  to give an 
opinion on this issue. 
The majority of experts expressed their concern about the interpretation and over-interpretation of the 
results observed in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH), mainly due to the fact that the origin of 
the PH was not known (hypoxaemia, low lung function). There are different genetic and pathogenic 
mechanisms involved in these conditions. Hence, a straightforward conclusion on the observed data is 
difficult to make. It was stated that in clinical practise, treatment decision for SSc-ILD patients with PH is 
made between pulmonologist and rheumatologist, based on individual patient status. 
In order to exercise caution, the experts suggested that Ofev, if approved, should not be used in severe 
PH patients. Severe PH might need to be followed up in further post-authorisation studies.  
4.  The experts are asked to reflect upon the need for generating further long-term clinical 
data to further characterize the efficacy on outcomes including mortality, and if so, what 
kind of collection methods (trial, registry) are relevant and feasible to conduct? 
There was a good consensus amongst the experts that in case of an approval, collection of post-
authorisation data would be very important. Their experience with registries in general was positive.  The 
SSc-ILD patients are well defined and organised, most already participate in registries. 
The key focus of such disease registry would be, amongst others: treatment effect on mortality, QoL, size 
of treatment effect, adherence to the treatment, ADRs, pattern of disease progression, use of new 
treatments especially from rheumatology area, and others (subject to further discussions with the 
applicant). The feasibility and meaningfulness of the registry shall also be taken into account.  
2.4.4.  Conclusion on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP having considered the data submitted by the applicant and the advice received from the Ad-
hoc experts, concluded as follows:  
The improvement in FVC observed of 41mls is considered clinically meaningful and supported by 
extrapolation of results between both IPF and SSc-ILD populations.  
There  are  insufficient  data  to  conclude  on  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  pulmonary  hypertension  and 
therefore contraindicate the use of nintedanib in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Nevertheless, the 
observed results cannot be completely ignored.  For this reason, the applicant was requested to include in 
the SmPC a warning highlighting that there are limited data in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The 
fact  that  patients  with  significant  pulmonary  hypertension  (cardiac  index  ≤2  l/min/m2,  or  parenteral 
epoprostenol/treprostinil or significant right heart failure) were excluded from the SENSCIS trial should also 
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020 
Page 72/119 
 
  
  
be highlighted in the SmPC. In summary, a warning is proposed to recommend that Ofev should not be 
used in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and that patients with mild to moderate PAH should 
be closely monitored. 
It was considered that nintedanib could be approved for the treatment of patients with SSc-ILD however 
the CHMP recommended the applicant to generate further data in the post approval setting. The following 
aspects related to efficacy would need to be considered: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
treatment effect on mortality,  
size of treatment effect and any potential changes of the treatment effect overtime  
pattern of disease progression 
effects of other concomitant or previous therapies on survival  
•  QoL  
• 
efficacy and safety profile in specific subgroups including patients with diagnosis of pulmonary 
hypertension   
The CHMP recommended that the protocol of the future study is developed in discussion with the CHMP 
SAWP, to which the MAH agreed. 
In summary it is considered it is agreed with the applicant that nintedanib treatment is a valid option for 
SSc-ILD patients. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The  safety  profile  of  nintedanib  has  been  investigated  comprehensively  in  IPF  and  established  in  this 
indication in >60,000 patient-years exposure post-marketing. The risks of treatment with nintedanib for 
this indication are primarily related to the gastrointestinal tract (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal 
pain, pancreatitis) and increases in liver enzymes and bilirubin, including drug-induced liver injury (DILI). 
Based on data from clinical trials and post-marketing and supported by population pharmacokinetic models, 
patients  with  low  body  weight  (<65  kg),  Asian,  and  female  patients  have  a  higher  risk  of  liver  enzyme 
elevations with nintedanib treatment. Risks of nintedanib treatment also include hypertension, bleeding, 
thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal perforation, thromboembolism, decreased appetite, decreased weight, 
rash, and pruritus. 
1199.214 Trial: Pivotal SSc-ILD 
In the 1199.214 trial, 580 patients from 32 countries were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive nintedanib 
150  mg  twice  daily  or  placebo.  Randomisation  was  stratified  based  on  the  anti-topoisomerase  antibody 
(ATA)  status  (positive  or  negative).  Data  suggest  that  ATA-positive  status  is  associated  with  faster 
progression of ILD. Dose reductions (to 100 mg bid) and treatment interruptions were allowed to manage 
adverse events. The main efficacy and safety assessments were conducted at 52 weeks.   
Individual patients stayed on blinded trial treatment for up to 100 weeks, until the last patient reached 52 
weeks  of  treatment.  Data  collected  beyond  52  weeks  were  used  in  supportive  analyses  of  efficacy  and 
safety. 
1199.225 Trial: SSc-ILD Long-term extension 
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020 
Page 73/119 
 
  
  
Patients who completed trial 1199.214 on treatment and attended a follow-up visit 28 days after end of 
treatment could participate in an open-label long-term extension trial 1199.225, in which all patients receive 
nintedanib. Patients whose last dose in the parent trial had been 150 mg bid, were also assigned this dose 
in trial 1199.225. Patients whose last dose in the parent trial had been 100 mg bid, could continue receiving 
the  dose  of  100  mg  bid  in  trial  1199.225  or  increase  the  dose  to  150  mg  bid,  at  the  discretion  of  the 
investigator.  Trial  1199.225  is  ongoing;  data  from  this  trial  is  not  included  in  this  application  as  the 
cumulative exposure was low at the time of the finalisation of this clinical overview. 
1199.239 Trial: DDI of nintedanib and bosentan 
A Phase I trial in healthy volunteers was conducted to investigate a potential drug-drug interaction (DDI) 
of  nintedanib  and  bosentan,  which  is  indicated  in  some  regions  for  the  treatment  of  digital  ulcers  and 
pulmonary hypertension in SSc. 
1199.0340 Trial: DDI of nintedanib and hormonal contraception 
Since the population of patients with SSc has a higher proportion of women of child-bearing potential than 
the  population  of  patients  with  IPF,  a  potential  DDI  of  nintedanib  and  hormonal  contraception  is  being 
evaluated. A dedicated DDI trial in patients with non-small cell lung cancer [trial 1199.238] was terminated 
due to recruitment issues.  
Therefore, another DDI trial, in patients with SSc-ILD, has recently been initiated (trial 1199.0340). The 
trial is currently ongoing and is not included in this application. At the time of finalisation of this clinical 
overview, 5 of the 24 planned patients have been enrolled. The clinical trial report (CTR) for the trial is 
planned to be available in July 2019. 
As perspective to compare the existing safety profile for the IPF population, in regard to differences of IPF 
and SSc-ILD as reviewed by Herzog and colleagues, patients with SSc-associated ILD are more commonly 
women (approximately 80%) between the ages of 30 and 55, IPF patients are more commonly men 
between 60–75 years (approximately 80%). The prevalence of IPF increases with age, which is not the 
case in SSc. Similarities of the underlying pathophysiology in regard to the fibrotic cascade have also 
been presented during scientific advice.  
The main safety assessment below is based on 1199.214 Trial: Pivotal SSc-ILD. The discussion involves 
mainly results from 1199.214 Trial: Pivotal SSc-ILD.  
Patient exposure 
The main assessment of safety in trial 1199.214 was done on data collected up to Week 52. The analysis 
of AEs was based on the concept of treatment-emergent AEs. All AEs with an onset date (or worsening) 
between the first intake of study medication and the end of the residual effect period, defined as 28 days 
after last drug intake, were considered treatment emergent. 
Demographic characteristics were generally similar in both treatment groups. The majority of patients 
(75.2%) were women. The largest proportion of patients was White (67.2%), followed by Asian patients 
(24.8%); with a smaller proportion of Asian patients in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group 
(21.5% vs. 28.1%). The mean (SD) age was 54.0 (12.2) years.

Table 33 The mean exposure to trial medication over 52 weeks and over the whole trial: 
As expected, based on data collected in the IPF programme, dose reductions and treatment interruptions 
were more frequent in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group, see Table above. The main reason 
for dose reductions and treatment interruptions were gastrointestinal AEs, especially diarrhoea. 
Table 34 Allowed dose reduction or treatment periods of nintedanib in trial 
Overall, 576 patients were treated (288 patients in each treatment group). At Week 52, more patients in 
the nintedanib group (19.4%) than in the placebo group (10.8%) had prematurely discontinued 
treatment. Over the whole trial (i.e. including time beyond 52 and up to 100 weeks), 25.7% of patients in 
the nintedanib group and 16.0% of patients in the placebo group prematurely discontinued trial 
medication. Overall, 83.0% of patients in the nintedanib group and 87.5% of patients in the placebo 
group completed the planned observation time (attended planned visits up to Week 100 or until the end 
of the trial).

The assessment of 1199.214 Trial: Pivotal SSc-ILD, AE data over the 52-week period was based on 
frequencies of patients with events rather than exposure-adjusted incidence rates, because exposure to 
study medication was expected to be comparable in the 2 treatment groups. 
In both treatment groups, the majority of patients (nintedanib: 98.3%, placebo: 95.8%) were reported 
with at least 1 AE over 52 weeks. The proportion of patients with AEs of severe intensity was higher in 
the nintedanib group (18.1%) than in the placebo group (12.5%). The proportion of patients with 
investigator defined drug-related AEs was nearly twice as high in the nintedanib group (82.6%) as in the 
placebo group (43.4%). Likewise, the proportion of patients with AEs leading to discontinuation of trial 
drug was twice as high in the nintedanib group (16.0%) as in the placebo group (8.7%). A similar 
proportion of patients in both groups were reported with SAEs (nintedanib: 24.0%, placebo: 21.5%) and 
AEs leading to death (nintedanib: 5 patients [1.7%], placebo: 4 patients [1.4%]).

The most common AEs observed more frequently in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group were 
gastrointestinal disorders, in particular diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting, see Table below. In addition, the 
incidences of the PTs weight decreased (SOC investigations) and decreased appetite (SOC metabolism 
and nutrition disorders) were higher in the nintedanib group. Abnormal liver function tests (increases in 
ALT, gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], AST) were also reported more frequently in the nintedanib 
group than in the placebo group. These results were as expected, based on the known safety profile of 
nintedanib in IPF.  
The most frequent AEs by preferred term (PT) were (PTs with a frequency >10% in either treatment 
group sorted by frequency in the nintedanib group) diarrhoea (75.7% vs. 31.6%), nausea (31.6% vs. 
13.5%), vomiting (24.7% vs. 10.4%), skin ulcer (18.4% vs. 17.4%), nasopharyngitis (12.5% vs. 
17.0%), cough (11.8% vs. 18.1%), weight decreased (11.8% vs. 4.2%), upper respiratory tract infection 
(11.5% vs. 12.2%), abdominal pain (11.5% vs.7.3%), and fatigue (10.8% vs. 6.9%). 
More frequently reported in the placebo group than in the nintedanib group were the PTs nasopharyngitis 
(SOC infections and infestations) and cough (SOC respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders). The 
incidence of the other most frequent AEs was similar in the 2 treatment groups. In particular, there was 
no difference between the groups in the incidence of skin ulcers. See Table below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020

In general, the AE profile over the whole trial was similar to the AE profile over 52 weeks. See table 
below. 
Table 36 Overall summery of adverse events over the whole trial - TS 
In general, the pattern of the most frequently reported AEs over the whole trial was similar to the pattern 
of the most frequently reported AEs over the first 52 weeks. The observed AE pattern stayed in line with 
the known AE profile of nintedanib in the treatment of IPF. The only exception remained the occurrence of 
skin ulcer associated with the underlying SSc disease, which was similar in both treatment groups.  
Gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported SOC. Within this SOC, the incidence of AEs 
was higher in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group. Specifically, the incidence of the PTs 
diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting was higher in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group. The 
incidences of the related PTs weight decreased and decreased appetite were higher in the nintedanib 
group, as were abnormal liver function tests (increases in ALT, GGT, and AST).

Table 37 Adverse events reported for more than 5% of patients over 52 weeks an either 
treatment group on the PT level in trial 1199.214 - TS 
The  most  common  severe  AEs  in  the  placebo  group  belonged  to  the  SOC  respiratory,  thoracic  and 
mediastinal disorders (nintedanib: 2.8% vs. placebo: 3.8%) with dyspnoea as the most commonly reported 
PT in the placebo group (0.3% vs. 1.4%).  
Drug-related AEs (defined by the investigator) were most frequently reported in the SOC gastrointestinal 
disorders (nintedanib: 78.5%; placebo: 29.9%). The most frequent PTs were diarrhoea (68.4% vs. 19.8%), 
nausea (24.7% vs. 7.3%), and vomiting (17.7% vs. 4.2%). The second most frequently reported SOC for 
Assessment report

drug-related AEs was investigations (19.1% vs. 4.9%) with weight decreased (6.9% vs. 1.4%) and alanine 
aminotransferase increased (5.6% vs. 0.7%) being the most frequent events in this SOC. 
Vital signs 
Analyses of vital signs showed that patients in the nintedanib group were more frequently reported with an 
increase  in  diastolic  blood  pressure  (14.6%)  than  patients  in  the  placebo  group  (5.6%).  Patients  in  the 
nintedanib  group  also  lost  more  weight  than  patients  in  the  placebo  group.  Over  52  weeks,  20.5%  of 
patients in the nintedanib group and 4.5% in the placebo group lost more than 10% of their body weight 
at some point during the first 52 weeks of treatment. 
Gastrointestinal and metabolic adverse events over 52 weeks 
Consistent with the known safety profile of nintedanib in IPF, gastrointestinal and metabolic adverse events 
were more than twice as frequent in the nintedanib group as in the placebo group. Exceptions were the 
SMQ-based safety topics ‘pancreatitis’ and ‘gastrointestinal perforation’, for which no relevant differences 
were seen. There was 1 patient with gastrointestinal perforation (PT anal abscess) in the placebo group; 
no gastrointestinal perforation was reported in the nintedanib group. See table below for gastrointestinal 
and metabolic adverse events over 52 weeks. 
Table 38 Gastrointestinal and metabolic adverse events over 52 weeks - TS 
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea AEs in the nintedanib group were mostly mild (49.5%) or moderate (45.0%) in intensity. About 
90% of patients with diarrhoea AEs in the nintedanib group could continue treatment despite occurrence 
of diarrhoea. The incidence of diarrhoea AEs with nintedanib was similar in patients with (76.9%) and 
without (70.4%) pre-disposition to gastrointestinal events. Most diarrhoea events in the nintedanib group 
and more than half of the diarrhoea events in the placebo group were considered to be drug-related by 
the investigator. 
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020 
Page 79/119 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Table 39 Summery of diarrhoea events over 52 weeks - TS 
About two thirds of the patients with diarrhoea in the nintedanib group had their first diarrhoea episode in 
the first 2 months of treatment. Most of these events were grade 1 (increase of <4 stools over baseline; 
56.8%) or grade 2 (increase of 4 to 6 stools over baseline; 31.5%). Most events responded to treatment 
(43.1%)  or  did  not  require  treatment  (35.1%).  Most  events  were  not  considered  to  be  related  to  SSc 
(83.5%). 
An additional analysis was conducted to evaluate whether pre-disposition to gastrointestinal events had an 
impact on the occurrence of diarrhoea AEs. Overall, 234 patients in the nintedanib group and 235 patients 
in the placebo group had a pre-disposition to gastrointestinal events; 54 patients in the nintedanib group 
and  53  patients  in  the  placebo  group  had  no  pre-disposition.  In  patients  with  pre-disposition  to 
gastrointestinal events, diarrhoea AEs were reported for 76.9% of patients in the nintedanib group and for 
34.0% of patients in the placebo group. In patients without pre-disposition, diarrhoea AEs were reported 
for  70.4%  of  patients  in  the  nintedanib  group  and  20.8%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group.  Thus,  the 
incidence  of  diarrhoea  AEs  with  nintedanib  was  similar  in  patients  with  and  without  pre-disposition  to 
gastrointestinal events. 
AESI gastrointestinal perforation 
Gastrointestinal perforation was defined as AESI in this trial, i.e. it had been identified as being of particular 
concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety assessment, with the requirement for investigators to 
mark the event as AESI. No such event was reported as AESI, although based on the SMQ ‘gastrointestinal 
perforation’, 1 patient in the placebo group experienced anal abscess. 
Concomitant GI AEs  
Over 52 weeks, 40.6% of patients in the nintedanib group and 5.9% of patients in the placebo group were 
reported  with  at  least  1  other  significant  AE.  The  most  common  other  significant  AEs  in  both  treatment 
groups  were  reported  in  the  SOC  gastrointestinal  disorders  (nintedanib  32.3%  vs.  placebo  2.4%),  with 
diarrhoea (26.4% vs. 1.0%) being the most frequent PT.

Hepatobiliary and liver laboratory adverse events over 52 weeks 
In line with the known nintedanib safety profile, hepatobiliary AEs were more frequent in the nintedanib 
group than in the placebo group, specifically within the SMQs ‘drug-related hepatic disorders - 
comprehensive search’ and ‘liver-related investigations, signs, and symptoms’. This difference was driven 
by liver laboratory AEs. 
Clinical hepatic failure was not reported. In the nintedanib group, all cases reported as PT liver disorder 
represented liver enzyme elevations, reported within 2 to 4 weeks after start of study treatment. The 
events were reported as non-serious in all but 1 patient (one patient), see SAE section of report below. 
Drug-induced liver injury was reported for 1 patient in each treatment group. Details on the patients with 
DILI (nintedanib group: one patient placebo group: one patient) and with hepatocellular injury 
(nintedanib group: one patient) are discussed in the SAE section of report below. No acute hepatic failure 
and no fatal hepatic events were reported in patients treated with nintedanib. 
For several patients, laboratory values fulfilled the protocol-defined criteria for signs of hepatic injury, but 
these were not reported as AEs. Based on review of the individual cases, hepatic injury was mild to 
moderate in intensity and reversible upon treatment interruption or discontinuation. None of the events 
resulted in hepatic failure or met Hy’s law criteria. 
With regards to increases in hepatic enzymes these are discussed below in the section Laboratory 
findings.

Cardiovascular adverse events over 52 weeks 
The  incidence  of  cardiovascular  AEs  was  similar  in  the  2  treatment  groups,  with  the  exception  of 
hypertension, which is a known side effect of nintedanib (4.9% vs. 1.7%, nintedanib vs. placebo). 
These hypertension AEs were non-serious in all but 1 patient in the nintedanib group. The patient in the 
nintedanib group reported with serious hypertension (PT hypertensive crisis) had underlying hypertension  
Myocardial  infarction  events  within  MACE  (based  on  broad  SMQ  ‘myocardial  infarction’)  represented 
laboratory abnormalities associated with cardiac conditions in all but 1 patient. A single case of PT acute 
myocardial infarction was reported in the placebo group. All stroke events were non-fatal, but reported as 
serious. Details on the patients with stroke events are discussed further in the SAE section in report below. 
Few cardiovascular AEs were considered drug-related by the investigator. Within the cardiovascular AEs, 
hypertension  (narrow  SMQ)  was  the  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  event  (nintedanib:  1.7%; 
placebo: 0.7%). 
To note, hypertension remained more frequent in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group beyond 
52 weeks of treatment (5.6% vs. 2.4%, nintedanib vs. placebo). 
Blood adverse events over 52 weeks 
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020 
Page 82/119 
 
  
  
 
 
In  line  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  nintedanib,  the  incidence  of  bleeding  AEs  was  higher  in  the 
nintedanib group than in the placebo group. Most bleeding AEs were reported as non-serious. The most 
frequently reported bleeding AEs involved the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. In these systems, 
the PT epistaxis (nintedanib 2.8% vs. placebo 3.8%) and rectal bleeding (reported as PT rectal haemorrhage 
[1.7% vs. 0%] and PT haematochezia [0.7% vs. 0.3%]) were reported most frequently.  
The  CNS  bleeding  events  in  2  patients  in  the  nintedanib  group  were  also  considered  in  the  SMQ 
‘haemorrhagic stroke’ and is discussed in this report under Serious adverse events- cardiovascular.  
An alternative explanation (other than trial medication) could be identified for 47.1% of the events in the 
nintedanib group and for 16.7% of the events in the placebo group. Blood AEs considered drug-related by 
the  investigator  are  shown  in  table  below.  Thrombocytopenia  and  neutropenia  were  evaluated  because 
these events have been reported rarely with nintedanib. In this trial, these events occurred infrequently, 
and the incidence of neutropenia AEs was similar in the 2 treatment groups. 
To note, additional patients with CNS bleeding were not reported beyond 52 weeks of treatment.

Renal adverse events over 52 weeks 
Renal failure was reported for 3 patients in each treatment group. Details on the 3 patients in the 
nintedanib group (3 patients) are provided in this report under the SAE heading below. The PT 
glomerulonephritis was not reported in either treatment group. Urinary tract infections were frequently 
reported in the predominantly female patient population (15.6% vs. 12.5% nintedanib vs. placebo). 
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020 
Page 83/119 
 
  
  
 
 
Beyond 52 weeks of treatment, there was one additional patient reported with ‘renal failure’ in the 
nintedanib group; the reported PT was ‘prerenal failure’. The PT glomerulonephritis was not reported in 
either treatment group. The increase in the incidence of ‘urinary tract infection’ was similar in both 
treatment groups beyond 52 weeks. 
Psychiatric adverse events over 52 weeks 
‘Depression’ was reported for 1.4% of patients in the nintedanib group and for 2.4% of patients in the 
placebo group. ‘Suicide’ was not reported. 
Psychiatric AEs over the whole trial were consistent with those over 52 weeks. Over the whole trial, 
‘depression’ was reported for 1.4% of patients in the nintedanib group (unchanged; rate/100 patient-
years = 1.09) and for 3.1% of patients in the placebo group (rate/100 patient-years = 2.28). ‘Suicide’ 
was not reported. 
Cutaneous adverse events over 52 weeks 
Rash and pruritus are known side effects of nintedanib. Both events were reported infrequently, but were 
more frequent in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group. Rash was reported for 4.2% of patients 
in the nintedanib group and for 3.1% of patients in the placebo group. The PT pruritus was reported for 
2.8% of patients in the nintedanib group and 1.4% of patients in the placebo group. No events were 
reported within the SMQ ‘serious cutaneous reactions’. 
In the SOC skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, skin ulcer was the most frequently reported PT. Skin 
ulcer was reported in 18.4% of patients in the nintedanib group and in 17.4% of patients in the placebo 
group. This is in line with the SSc disease. 
The pattern of cutaneous AEs reported over the whole trial was similar to the pattern reported over 52 
weeks. Also over the whole trial, there were no events reported within the SMQ ‘serious cutaneous 
reactions’ 
Drug-related adverse events over 52 weeks 
Substantial proportions of patients in both treatment groups were reported with drug-related AEs, 82.6% 
in the nintedanib group and 46.2% in the placebo group. This proportion was almost twice as high in the 
nintedanib group as in the placebo group. 
Drug-related AEs were most commonly reported in the SOC gastrointestinal disorders. The most frequent 
PTs were diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting. The second most frequently reported SOC for drug-related 
AEs was investigations. Weight decreased and elevations in several liver enzymes were the most frequent 
events in this SOC.

Table 43 Drug-related adverse events reported for more than1 % of patients in either 
treatment group PT level - TS 
Among  the  AEs  reported  as  drug-related  by  investigators,  urinary  tract  infection,  fatigue,  myalgia,  and 
arthralgia have not been associated with nintedanib in previous clinical trials and development programs. 
These events were considered associated with the underlying SSc- ILD disease of the trial population. 
In order to identify new ADRs for nintedanib in patients with SSc-associated ILD, a comparison of the safety 
results for the nintedanib and placebo groups of trial 1199.214 was carried out. A screening algorithm with 
numerical thresholds was applied to each PT using the following numerical criteria: 
• 
If  the  AE  frequency  in  the  nintedanib  group  is  ≥5%  and  the  relative  risk  (rate  ratio)  versus  the 
placebo group is ≥2-fold, the event is suggestive of a potential side effect (criterion 1) 
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020

• 
• 
If  the  AE  frequency  in  the  nintedanib  group  is  ≥2%  and  <5%  and  the  relative  risk  (rate  ratio) 
versus the placebo group is ≥2-fold (criterion 2) or  
if  the  AE  frequency  in  the  nintedanib  group  is  ≥5%  and  the  relative  risk  (rate  ratio)  versus  the 
placebo  group  is  >1-fold  and  <2-fold  (criterion  3),  other  supportive  data  that  support  a  causal 
association would be needed to suggest a side effect. 
All non-listed terms identified by this screening algorithm are summarised in the table below. They were 
subject to further integrated medical evaluation considering all sources of safety data, such as individual 
case medical content, seriousness, investigator-reported relatedness, and if applicable clinical laboratory 
data, vital signs, and dedicated pharmacokinetic/dynamic analyses. 
Table 44 Non-listed Preferred Terms identified by the screening algorithm for potential ADRs  
Based on the methods described above, no new ADRs were identified for nintedanib in SSc associated ILD. 
A causal association between the screened AEs and nintedanib could not be established for one or more of 
the following reasons: 
• 
• 
The difference to placebo was too low (≤3 patients) to allow the drawing of conclusions 
The  screened  AEs  represent  individual  terms  (PTs);  when  looking  into  the  respective  medical 
concepts, the findings were balanced 
•  Some AEs were potential chain events occurring as a consequence of already listed ADRs 
• 
•  Alternative explanations for the AEs were found after individual case review 
There was no known pharmacologic or physiologic mechanism to associate the AEs with nintedanib 
Severe adverse events over 52 weeks 
Severe AEs were reported for 18.1% of patients in the nintedanib group and 12.5% of patients in the 
placebo group. The most common severe AEs in the nintedanib group belonged to the SOC 
gastrointestinal disorders (nintedanib: 7.6% vs. placebo: 2.1%), with diarrhoea as the most frequently 
reported PT in the nintedanib group (4.2% vs. 1.0%). The most common severe AEs in the placebo group 
belonged to the SOC respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (2.8% vs. 3.8%) with dyspnoea as 
the most frequently reported PT in the placebo group (0.3% vs. 1.4%). Severity assessed based on 
CTCAE) Version 4.0. 
Adverse events in subgroups over 52 weeks 
Adverse events were analysed for various subgroups. There were no relevant findings in the subgroups 
for ATA status, mycophenolate use at baseline, region, and pre-disposition to gastrointestinal, 
cardiovascular, renal, and pulmonary hypertension events. 
Overall, the safety profile for nintedanib was consistent across the pre-specified subgroups. The incidence 
of SAEs in the nintedanib group was higher for Black/African American patients (40.0%) than for Asian 
(25.8%) and White (22.4%) patients. However, as the number of Black/African American patients was 
relatively small, the findings need to be interpreted with caution. Gastrointestinal disorders, specifically 
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020

vomiting and nausea, as well as elevations in liver enzymes were more frequent in women than in men 
treated with nintedanib. Hepatobiliary AEs in the nintedanib group were more frequent in patients of 
Asian race, low body weight, and those with limited cutaneous SSc subtype. However, the higher 
proportion of Asians in the limited cutaneous SSc subgroup than in the diffuse cutaneous SSc subgroup 
may have contributed to these findings. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The proportion of patients reported with SAEs (nintedanib: 24.0%, placebo: 21.5%) and AEs leading to 
death (nintedanib: 5 patients [1.7%], placebo: 4 patients [1.4%]). 
The most common serious adverse events (SAEs) by PT were (sorted by frequency in the nintedanib 
group) pneumonia (nintedanib: 2.8%; placebo: 0.3%), interstitial lung disease (2.4% vs. 1.7%), 
pulmonary hypertension (1.4% vs. 1.4%), dyspnoea (1.0% vs. 1.7%), pulmonary fibrosis (1.0% vs. 
1.4%), acute kidney injury (1.0% vs. 0.3%), pulmonary arterial hypertension (1.0% vs. 0.0%), and 
systemic sclerosis pulmonary (0.7% vs. 1.0%). 
Table 45 Serious adverse events reported for more than 1% of patients over 52 weeks in 
either treatment group on the PT level - TS 
The overall incidence of SAEs was similar in both treatment groups. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders was the most frequently reported SOC. The most frequently reported SAEs (>1% of patients in 
either treatment group on the PT level) were balanced between the 2 treatment groups, with the 
exception of interstitial lung disease and pneumonia, which were more frequent in the nintedanib group 
than in the placebo group. This imbalance was smaller in the analysis of all pneumonia AEs (serious and 
non-serious) over 52 weeks (nintedanib: 4.2%, placebo: 2.1%). See discussion Other serious adverse 
events of interest over 52 weeks, in this section. 
In general, the pattern of serious adverse events reported over the whole trial was very similar to the 
pattern reported over 52 weeks.

Table 46 Serious adverse events and their incidence rates reported for more than 1% of 
patients over whole trial in either treatment group on the PT level - TS 
The proportion of patients with AEs categorised as MACE over 52 weeks was balanced between the 2 
treatment groups (nintedanib: 1.4%; placebo: 1.7%). Events were adjudicated as MACE in 1 patient in 
the nintedanib group (0.3%; arrhythmia) and 3 patients in the placebo group (1.0%; 1 patient each with 
acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and cerebral infarction). 
Deaths 
The number of patients who died was low and similar in both treatment groups. Adverse events leading 
to death over the whole trial were reported for 6 patients in the nintedanib group (2.1%) and 5 patients 
in the placebo group (1.7%). Of these, 5 patients in the nintedanib group (1.7%) and 4 patients in the 
placebo group (1.4%) died in the first 52 weeks of the trial. Post-treatment AEs leading to death (onset 
after the residual effect period), were reported for 4 patients in the nintedanib group and 4 patients in the 
placebo group. There was no pattern to the types of events leading to death.

after nintedanib discontinuation, the patient died of acute lung injury. Autopsy details were not reported. 
The investigator assessed the acute lung injury as related to the study drug. 
Patient 2: an old Black woman with diffuse cutaneous SSc was on treatment with nintedanib for about 4 
months. Nintedanib was discontinued due to worsening of the disease under study. 5 days after nintedanib 
discontinuation, the patient was diagnosed with scleroderma renal crisis and malignant arterial hypertension 
with  thrombotic  microangiopathy.  During  the  subsequent  weeks,  the  patient  experienced  renal, 
neurological, and cardiologic repercussions. 40 days after nintedanib discontinuation, the patient died of 
scleroderma renal crisis and thrombotic microangiopathy. An autopsy was not performed. The investigator 
assessed the scleroderma renal crisis and thrombotic microangiopathy as not related to the study drug. 
Patient 3:  an old White woman with diffuse cutaneous SSc was on treatment with nintedanib for about 2 
months.  Nintedanib  was  discontinued  due  to  diarrhoea.  During  the  subsequent  weeks,  the  patient  was 
reported  with  ANCA  positive  vasculitis,  acute  kidney  injury,  respiratory  failure,  and  large  intestine 
perforation. 69 days after nintedanib discontinuation, the patient was reported with pleural effusion. Later 
on that day, the patient died of circulatory collapse. It was not reported whether an autopsy was performed. 
The investigator assessed the circulatory collapse as not related to the study drug. 
In the follow-up phase when subjects were not receiving study drug, there were 4 deaths in the placebo 
group and 4 in the nintedanib group, no deaths were assessed during follow-up as related.  
Serious gastrointestinal and metabolic adverse events over 52 weeks 
Serious gastrointestinal AEs were rare in both treatment groups. Serious metabolic AEs were not reported. 
The only serious gastrointestinal AE considered drug-related by the investigator was diarrhoea, reported 
for 1 patient in the nintedanib group. 
Serious hepatobiliary and liver laboratory adverse events over 52 weeks 
Drug-induced liver injury was reported as serious for 1 patient in each treatment group (nintedanib and ; 
placebo). Drug-induced liver injury was reported as ‘not severe’ for the patient in the nintedanib group. 
Both  patients  recovered  after  treatment  discontinuation.  One  Patient  DILI  resolved  in  2weeks  following 
treatment discontinuation.  
Hepatocellular injury was reported as serious for 1 patient in the nintedanib group. The patient recovered 
upon dose reduction. On the 288th day since the 1st intake of the study drug, a blood test showed elevated 
transaminases- AST 92 IU/L, ALT 106 IU/L, bilirubin 10 μmol/L (normal), ALP219 IU/L and GGT 434 IU/L. 
No abnormalities were seen in an abdominal ultrasound. The event was considered serious due to other 
(unspecified)  comparable  medical  criteria.  The  hepatocellular  injury  resolved  16  day  later,  without  any 
treatment. The study drug was restarted on the next day at a permanently reduced dose of 100 mg bid 
due to the hepatocellular injury. 
Liver  disorder  was  reported  as  serious  for  1  patient  in  the  nintedanib  group.  The  patient  attended  the 
hospital with malaise. Laboratory testing noted ALT values >10x ULN, bilirubin 1.3mg/dL (normal range 0-
1.0mg/dL). Upon treatment discontinuation, the liver disorder resolved without any further treatment. 
Liver enzyme elevations are briefly discussed further in the Laboratory findings section below.  
Serious cardiovascular adverse events over 52 weeks 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  AEs  categorised  as  MACE  over  52  weeks  was  balanced  between  the  2 
treatment groups (nintedanib: 1.4%; placebo: 1.7%). Serious MACE events were reported for 2 patients 
in  the  nintedanib  group;  those  were  one  patient  with  subarachnoid  haemorrhage  secondary  to  a  fall/ 
syncope and another patient with fatal arrhythmia. Events were adjudicated as MACE in 1 patient in the 
nintedanib group (0.3%; arrhythmia) and 3 patients in the placebo group (1.0%; 1 patient each with acute 
Assessment report

myocardial  infarction,  cardiac  arrest,  and  cerebral  infarction).  Hypertension  was  the  most  frequently 
reported drug-related event (nintedanib: 1.7%; placebo: 0.7%). 
Arterial thromboembolic events were infrequently reported: in 0.7% of patients in the placebo and 0.7% in 
the Ofev treated group. Myocardial infarction was observed with low frequency in the placebo group (0.7%) 
and not observed in the Ofev group. 
-One Patient with fatal arrhythmia 
On  the  102nd  day  since  the  1st  intake  of  the  study  drug,  subject  suddenly  collapsed  moving  from  the 
bathroom to the bed. Emergency physician administered epinephrine and 45 minutes of resuscitation was 
performed, after which the patient was declared dead due to a cardiac arrest secondary to a serious adverse 
event of arrhythmia and irreversible respiratory failure. It was also stated that the patient was affected by 
a  progressive  form  of  SSc  with  several  comorbidities  such  as  pulmonary  hypertension,  supraventricular 
arrhythmia, frequent ventricular extrasystoles, chronic heart-lung failure, and diffused myopathy. The other 
cause of death was therefore reported as worsening of SSc. The last dose of the study drug had been taken 
one day earlier. No autopsy was performed. 
An  independent  committee  adjudicated  the  cause  of  death  for  this  patient  as  cardiovascular  death.  The 
investigator assessed the events painful ulcer right index finger and ulcer left thumb, digital ulcer on left 
ring finger, and arrhythmia as not related to the study drug. 
-Hypertensive crisis 
The patient in the nintedanib group reported with serious hypertension (PT hypertensive crisis), and was 
treated with olmesartan prior to and during the course of study drug. The patient experienced an adverse 
event of epistaxis on the 208th day since the 1st intake of the study drug, and was also noted with a serious 
adverse event of hypertensive crisis with systolic blood pressure at 180 mmHg (diastolic not reported for 
this  date).  The  event  was  considered  serious  due  to  other  comparable  medical  criteria.  The  patient 
continued to receive olmesartan. No action was taken with the study drug and the event resolved on the 
onset date. The investigator assessed the event hypertensive crisis as not related to the study drug. 
-Haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke events 
Within the first 52 weeks of the trial, there were 4 patients with serious haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke 
events,  3  patients  in  the  nintedanib  group  and  1  patient  in  the  placebo  group.  Over  the  whole  trial,  1 
additional patient in the placebo group had a serious haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke event. A short 
summary  of  these  5  patients  and  their  events  is  given  below.  Further  details  are  available  in  patient 
narratives. 
Patient 1: a woman in the nintedanib group, experienced a subarachnoid haemorrhage as the result of an 
injury. The patient had diarrhoea due to nintedanib, developed hypovolemia and hypotension, followed by 
syncope and a fall that caused the subarachnoid haemorrhage. The patient was also noted to have elevated 
blood  creatinine  values,  diagnosed  as  acute  kidney  injury.  The  patient  recovered  from  subarachnoid 
haemorrhage and acute kidney injury. The investigator assessed the subarachnoid haemorrhage as drug-
related. The subarachnoid haemorrhage of this patient is also counted under the organ system ‘blood AEs’, 
safety topic ‘bleeding’ in the subcategory ‘CNS bleeding’. 
Patient  2,  a  woman  in  the  nintedanib  group,  experienced  a  cerebral  microhaemorrhage.  An  MRI  scan 
detected cerebral amyloid angiopathy and an old microhaemorrhage. The patient’s event was reported as 
not yet recovered, but the patient was followed in the study without further symptoms related to the event. 
The investigator assessed the cerebral microhaemorrhage as drug-related. The cerebral microhaemorrhage 
of this patient is also counted under the organ system ‘blood adverse events’, safety topic ‘bleeding’ in the 
subcategory ‘CNS bleeding’.

Patient  3,  a  woman  in  the  nintedanib  group,  experienced  a  cerebrovascular  disorder.  The  patient  had 
presented for workup of headache with possible cerebral carcinoma. The findings were reported as cerebral 
vascular lesion, a type of arteriovenous malformation which had been present but undetected since birth. 
The  patient  had  not  yet  recovered  but  was  followed  in  the  study.  The  investigator  assessed  the 
cerebrovascular disorder as not drug-related. 
Patient 4, a man in the placebo group, presented to the hospital with hemiparesis and was diagnosed with 
a cerebral infarction. The patient recovered. The investigator assessed the cerebral infarction as not drug-
related. 
Patient  5,  a  man  in  the  placebo  group,  experienced  carotid  artery  stenosis.  The  patient  had  underlying 
pulmonary  arterial  hypertension.  The  patient  had  not  yet  recovered  but  was  followed  in  the  study.  The 
investigator assessed the carotid artery stenosis as not drug-related. 
Serious blood adverse events over 52 weeks 
Serious blood AEs were rare in both treatment groups. The 3 patients in the nintedanib group with SAEs in 
the subcategory ‘GI bleeding - lower’ were reported with haematochezia (, unrelated), rectal haemorrhage 
(unrelated),  and  lower  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage  secondary  to  internal  haemorrhoids  which  were 
coagulated (related). All 3 patients recovered. 
For  Patient  with  rectal  and  GI  haemorrhage,  the  investigator  assessed  the  events  lower  gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage and upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage as related to the study drug. It was stated that the 
upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage and lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage were possibly related to the 
concomitant diseases gastric polyps, haemorrhoids, and proximal colitis. Also, the investigator considered 
a  causal  relationship  between  ketoprofen  (administered  for  general  inflammatory  lumbalgia  since  2006) 
and the upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage but did not report a causal relationship between ketoprofen 
and  lower  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage.  The  study  drug  was  temporarily  stopped  and  restarted  at  a 
permanently reduced dose of 100 mg for each episode of bleeding.  
Serious renal adverse events over 52 weeks 
Serious renal AEs were rare in both treatment groups. All 3 renal failure events that were reported as AEs 
in the nintedanib group met seriousness criteria. These SAEs involved the following patients: 
• 
• 
• 
Patient1, a patient with scleroderma renal crisis, described this section under Deaths 
Patient 2, a patient with ANCA vasculitis, described this section under Deaths 
Patient3, as described in the section above, Serious cardiovascular adverse events over 52 weeks. 
The  only  serious  renal  AE  considered  drug-related  by  the  investigator  was  experienced  by  patient.  The 
patient recovered from subarachnoid haemorrhage and acute kidney injury. 
Among the reported serious urinary tract infections was 1 case of pyelonephritis in each treatment group 
(nintedanib and placebo), as well as 1 case of urosepsis in the nintedanib group. All 3 patients recovered.  
Renal failure (narrow SMQ ‘Acute renal failure’) was rarely co-reported in cases of diarrhoea, with 112 cases 
(0.5%). The co-reporting is independent of a causal or temporal association of the events. 
Other significant adverse events (ICH E3) over 52 weeks 
Other significant AEs (according to ICH E3) included mostly non-serious and non-significant AEs that led to 
discontinuation or dose reduction of trial treatment. Thus, other significant AEs overlapped with AEs leading 
to permanent dose reduction and AEs leading to premature treatment discontinuation. 
Over 52 weeks, 40.6% of patients in the nintedanib group and 5.9% of patients in the placebo group were 
reported  with  at  least  1  other  significant  AE.  The  most  common  other  significant  AEs  in  both  treatment

groups  were  reported  in  the  SOC  gastrointestinal  disorders  (nintedanib  32.3%  vs.  placebo  2.4%),  with 
diarrhoea (26.4% vs. 1.0%) being the most frequent PT. The second most frequently reported SOC was 
investigations  (5.9%  vs.  0.7%),  which  mainly  comprised  PTs  of  liver  enzyme  elevations  and  (in  the 
nintedanib group only) weight decreased. See also Concomitant GI AEs above in this report.

Serious cutaneous adverse events over 52 weeks 
Serious cutaneous AEs were not reported 
Other serious adverse events of interest over 52 weeks 
The following events were further evaluated based on the study results. They had not been pre-defined as 
safety topics. 
Pneumonia 
Over the whole trial, 10 patients in the nintedanib group (3.5%) and 2 patients in the placebo group (0.7%) 
were reported with serious pneumonia. In addition, 1 patient in the nintedanib group was reported with 
serious bacterial pneumonia. 
The serious cases of pneumonia in the nintedanib group were reviewed based on patient narratives. Three 
of  the  cases  were  associated  with  significant  underlying  concurrent  disease  (scleroderma  renal  crisis, 
mesothelioma,  severe 
leukopenia);  2  cases  were  associated  with  recent  administration  of 
cyclophosphamide; 1 case was assessed by the investigator as possibly related to prednisone, mycophenolic 
acid, or other medications; 1 fatal pneumonia case occurred within 1 month of start of treatment, which 
was not consistent with other cases; 1 case was reclassified by the investigator as not pneumonia; 2 cases 
occurred  during  the  residual  effect  period  of  28  days;  in  1  case,  available  information  did  not  provide 
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020

sufficient clarity for an alternative explanation. Thus, there are alternative explanations for pneumonia for 
the majority of cases, with no identifiable pattern for the serious pneumonia cases with nintedanib.  
In addition, a post-hoc analysis based on multiple PTs indicative of lower respiratory tract infections was 
conducted. Based on this analysis, the overall incidence of lower respiratory tract infection AEs including 
pneumonia,  was  balanced  between  the  2  treatment  groups,  with  an  imbalance  towards  the  nintedanib 
group for SAEs. Over 52 weeks, 12.8% of patients in the nintedanib group and 14.2% of patients in the 
placebo  group  were  reported  with  lower  respiratory  tract  infections.  Serious  lower  respiratory  tract 
infections  over  52  weeks  were  reported  for  3.5%  of  patients  in  the  nintedanib  group  and  1.7%  in  the 
placebo group. In conclusion, there is no reasonable possibility for a causal association between nintedanib 
and serious pneumonia. 
Neoplasms 
The incidence of AEs belonging to the SOC ‘neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts 
and  polyps)’  was  low.  While  the  incidence  of  these  AEs  was  higher  in  the  nintedanib  group  than  in  the 
placebo group, the incidence of SAEs was similar in the 2 treatment groups, both over 52 weeks and over 
the whole trial. The individual PTs within this SOC were reported for 1 or 2 patients each, and there was no 
discernible pattern of events. 
Table 49 Overview of adverse events within the SOC ‘neoplasm’ 
Worsening of ILD 
Worsening of the underlying disease was to be reported as (S)AE in this trial. The proportion of patients 
reported with the PT ILD was slightly higher in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group. Review of 
individual cases indicated that these were reports of exacerbation, worsening, or deterioration of the 
underlying SSc-ILD disease. 
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020

Table 50 Overview of PT interstitial lung disease adverse events 
Apart from the PT ILD, the investigators used several other terms to report worsening of the underlying 
disease, specifically the PTs SSc pulmonary, pulmonary fibrosis, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory 
failure. Based on all these terms, the overall incidence of AEs and SAEs indicative of worsening of the 
underlying disease was, the incidence of AEs (nintedanib: 6.6%, placebo: 5.9%) and SAEs (4.5% in both 
groups) over 52 weeks. 
Laboratory findings 
Liver enzymes 
The clinical laboratory evaluation showed that no patient in the trial had liver enzyme elevations 
concurrent with an elevation in bilirubin that fell within the Hy’s law criteria. A maximum ALT and/or AST 
≥3x ULN was observed for 4.9% of patients in the nintedanib group and for 0.7% of patients in the 
placebo group. More than half of the patients (9/16 patients) with a liver enzyme elevation in the 
nintedanib group experienced the first liver enzyme elevation within the first 2 months of treatment. All 
events in both treatment groups were reversible after dose reduction or discontinuation. Clinical liver 
failure and the PT liver failure were not reported during the trial. 
No patient in the trial had liver enzyme elevations ≥3x ULN concurrent with an elevation in bilirubin ≥2x 
ULN that met Hy’s law criteria, see figure below.

Figure 20 Potential Hy’s law cases over 52 weeks - TS 
An  additional  search  was  conducted  for  patients  with  signs  of  hepatic  injury  as  defined  by  the  protocol. 
More patients in the nintedanib than in the placebo group had such signs of hepatic injury. Affected patients 
(with PTs for relevant AEs) were in the nintedanib group one patient (PTs ALT increased, AST increased, 
GGT increased, nausea, vomiting), another patient (PTs transaminases increased, nausea), another patient  
(PTs hepatic enzyme increased, abdominal pain), patient (PT hepatitis A), patient (PT liver injury), patient 
one (PTs ALT increased, AST the placebo group patient (PT drug-induced liver injury).  
Of note, for the patients in the nintedanib group, the signs of hepatic injury occurred within the first month 
of treatment; most patients could restart nintedanib at a reduced dose and continue treatment with stable 
liver function tests. 
All events in both treatment groups normalised at the following visits. In the nintedanib group, the events 
resolved after dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. 
Other Laboratory findings 
There  were  no  notable  differences  in  the  frequency  of  patients  with  possibly  clinically  significant 
abnormalities in haematology, coagulation, electrolytes, biochemistry, and urinalysis parameters over 52 
weeks in the nintedanib group and in the placebo group. 
Natriuretic peptide type B- At baseline, the mean concentration (SD) of natriuretic peptide type B, a marker 
of right ventricular stress, was quite similar in both treatment groups, with 44.305 (73.830) ng/L in the 
nintedanib group and 43.544 (62.778) ng/L in the placebo group. The mean change from baseline at the 
last value on treatment was -0.872 (61.372) ng/L in the nintedanib group and 5.304 (41.015) ng/L in the 
placebo group. 
Assessment report

The PT ‘brain natriuretic peptide increased’ was reported as an AE for 1 patient in the nintedanib group and 
for 2 patients in the placebo group.  
Results  of  the  clinical  laboratory  evaluation  over  the  whole  trial  were  consistent  with  the  results  of  the 
clinical laboratory evaluation over 52 weeks. 
Safety in special populations 
Adverse events in trial 1199.214 were analysed for various subgroups. There were no relevant findings in 
the  subgroups  for  ATA  status,  mycophenolate  use  at  baseline,  region,  and  pre-disposition  to 
gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal, and pulmonary hypertension events.   
Gender 
In the nintedanib group, the PTs nausea and vomiting were more frequently reported in women (35.3% 
and 28.1%) than in men (19.4% and 13.4%). 
Of note, the PT diarrhoea was similarly frequent in women and in men in both treatment groups. In women, 
diarrhoea  was  reported  for  74.7%  of  patients  in  the  nintedanib  group  and  for  31.1%  of  patients  in  the 
placebo group. In men, diarrhoea was reported for 79.1% of patients in the nintedanib group and for 32.9% 
of patients in the placebo group. 
Adverse events within the safety topic ‘hepatic disorders combined’ were also reported more frequently for 
women than for men in the nintedanib group (19.0% vs. 11.9%). 
Age 
The incidence of other significant AEs (ICH E3) in the nintedanib group was higher in older patients (≥65 
years) than in younger patients (<65 years). 
Table 51 Overall summery of adverse events in subgroups by age over 52 weeks in trial 
1199.214 - TS 
In  the  nintedanib  group,  AEs  within  the  SOC  gastrointestinal  disorders  were  balanced  between  the  age 
groups. However, SAEs within this SOC were more frequently reported for older patients than for younger 
patients (9.4% vs. 2.2%). Adverse events within the SOC gastrointestinal disorders also more frequently

led  to  premature  discontinuation  of  nintedanib  treatment  in  older  than  in  younger  patients  (14.1%  vs. 
8.0%) 
The PT decreased appetite in the nintedanib group was more frequently reported in older than in younger 
patients (18.8% vs. 6.7%). A similar difference was seen for weight decreased (18.8% vs. 9.8%). 
The proportion of patients reported with AEs within the safety topic ‘hepatic disorders combined’ was higher 
for older than for younger patients in the nintedanib group (23.4% vs. 15.6%). Smaller differences were 
seen for events in the nintedanib group within the SMQ ‘hepatic failure’ (7.8% vs. 2.7%) and for hepatic 
enzyme increased (within the organ system ‘liver laboratory AEs’; 15.6% vs. 12.5%.) 
Body weight 
Adverse events leading to permanent treatment discontinuation and other significant AEs (ICH E3) were 
more frequently reported in patients ≤65 kg than in patients >65 kg. Adverse events belonging to the SOC 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders were less frequently reported for patients ≤65 kg than for 
patients >65 kg in the nintedanib group (25.0% vs. 42.3%).  
In  the  nintedanib  group,  AEs  within  the  safety  topic  ‘hepatic  disorders  combined’  were  more  frequently 
reported in patients ≤65 kg than patients >65 kg (20.0% vs. 15.5%). 
Race 
The incidence of SAEs was higher in Black/African American patients than in Asian and White patients. Of 
note, the number of Black/African American patients was relatively small. 
Adverse events within the safety topic ‘hepatic disorders combined’ in the nintedanib group were reported 
more  frequently  in  Asians  (35.5%)  than  in  Blacks/African  Americans  (15.0%)  and  Whites  (12.4%). 
Specifically, in Asian patients, ‘hepatic disorders combined’ were reported more frequently in the nintedanib 
group than in the placebo group (35.5% vs. 4.9%). 
Within the organ system ‘liver laboratory AEs’, hepatic enzyme increased (group of PTs) was reported for 
16.1% of Asian patients, 15.0% of Black/African American patients, and 12.4% of White patients. The 2 
DILI cases in the trial were reported for Asian patients (1 in each treatment group). 
Adverse  events  within  the  safety  topic  ‘hepatic  disorders  combined’  in  the  nintedanib  group  were  more 
frequent  in  patients  with  limited  cutaneous  SSc  than  in  those  with  diffuse  cutaneous  SSc  (23.0%  vs. 
12.4%). Of note, the proportion of Asian patients was higher in the limited cutaneous SSc subgroup than 
in  the  diffuse  cutaneous  SSc  subgroup  (28.2%  vs.  21.7%).  Therefore,  the  differences  in  AEs  described 
above can at least partly be attributed to race rather than to SSc type. 
Pulmonary hypertension 
Pulmonary hypertension is a recognised feature of ILD associated with SSc – presumptively due in part to 
vasculitic  changes  affecting  pulmonary  blood  vessels  -  but  is  less  common  in  IPF.  From  a  theoretical 
perspective,  the  known  anti-angiogenic  action  of  nintedanib  may  improve  or  worsen  pulmonary 
hypertension, and there is no clear evidence in humans to establish which is more likely to occur in this 
patient  population.  There  are  also  risks  in  relation  to  pulmonary  haemorrhage.  Nintedanib  is  a  pan-
angiogenic kinase inhibitor with inhibitory activity at the VEGF and PDGF receptors which can have opposing 
effects  on  vascular  permeability.  The  vasculitic  component  to  pulmonary  hypertension  in  SSc  could 
predispose to vascular leakage if increased vascular permeability is the net effect of nintedanib’s action at 
VEGF and PDGF receptors. Pulmonary haemorrhage is already recognised to occur in SSc and there may 
therefore be an increased risk of this in patients treated with nintedanib.  
Doppler  echocardiography  was  at  least  to  be  performed  in  patients  with  a  prior  history  of  pulmonary 
hypertension  at  the  time  of  screening.  An  echocardiography-specific  CRF  page  was  completed  for  107

patients  in  the  nintedanib  group  and  96  patients  in  the  placebo  group.  The  proportion  of  patients  with 
changes  from  baseline  was  low  and  similar  in  the  2  treatment  groups  (nintedanib:  8  patients,  7.5%; 
placebo:  7  patients,  7.3%).  Changes  primarily  involved  reports  of  worsening  of  estimated  pulmonary 
arterial pressure (corresponding to pulmonary hypertension) and/or increased diameter of the right heart 
ventricle or atrium.  
Adverse events were analysed for various subgroups. There were no relevant findings in the subgroups for 
pulmonary hypertension events. 
Pregnancy and Lactation 
Angiogenesis is critical to foetal development. Following administration of nintedanib to rats, the inhibition 
of angiogenesis resulted in absorption of foetuses and increased incidence of malformations. These effects 
occurred at dose levels resulting in plasma drug concentrations similar to, or lower than, those reached in 
humans during treatment with nintedanib.  
Women of childbearing potential not using a highly effective method of birth control were therefore excluded 
from all studies with nintedanib. Women who were pregnant or breast feeding were also excluded. None of 
the female patients became pregnant during the nintedanib studies. 
No post-marketing cases of pregnancy have been received since product launch.

Introduction 
DDI study with Bosentan, Trial 1199.239: 
A total of 6 out of 13 subjects (46.2%) reported at least one AE during the entire course of this trial. In 
Treatment Period 1, 4 subjects (30.8%) reported AEs following the administration of a single oral dose of 
150  mg  nintedanib  on  Day  1.  In  Treatment  Period  2,  4  subjects  (30.8%)  reported  AEs  following  the 
administration  of  bosentan  125  mg  twice  daily  on  Days  1  to  6  (loading  doses)  and  2  subjects  (15.4%) 
reported AEs following the administration of a single oral dose of 150 mg nintedanib on Day 7 plus 125 mg 
bosentan twice daily on Days 7 and 8. These incidences include AEs that were reported within the residual 
effect periods after last dosing. Following the administration of nintedanib alone (Treatment Period 1) or 
nintedanib plus bosentan (Treatment Period 2), 5 out of 13 subjects (38.5%) were reported with AEs, (‘total 
on nintedanib’). 
Adverse events assessed by the investigator as related to the trial medication were reported for 4 out of 
13 subjects (30.8%). Following the administration of nintedanib alone or nintedanib plus bosentan, drug-
related AEs were reported for 3 subjects (23.1%).

(according to ICH E3) were not observed (AESIs had not been defined for this clinical trial). 
No subject reported AEs in the screening or post-study periods.  
Display of adverse events 
Most frequent adverse events 
Taken all treatments together, nervous system disorders (in 4 subjects [30.8%]) were the most frequent 
AEs by SOC, followed by infections and infestations (in 3 subjects [23.1%]). On the PT level, headache (in 
3 subjects [23.1%]) was the most frequent AE; all other PTs were reported in single subjects only. 
Headache was also the most frequent AE following the administration of nintedanib in Treatment Period 1 
(in 2 subjects [15.4%]). Moreover, headache occurred in 1 subject during administration of the bosentan 
loading doses in Treatment Period 2. 
Most-frequent drug-related adverse events 
Adverse  events  assessed  by  the  investigator  as  related  to  the  trial  medication  were  documented  for  2 
subjects (15.4%) following the administration of nintedanib only (headache), for 1 subject (7.7%) during 
the  bosentan  loading  doses  (headache),  and  for  1  subject  (7.7%)  following  the  coadministration  of 
nintedanib  plus  bosentan  (diarrhoea).  In  total,  drug-related  AEs  were  reported  in  4  out  of  13  subjects 
(30.8%). 
Diarrhoea (investigator term ‘loose stool’) reported by One Subject was deemed not to interfere with the 
nintedanib PK analyses in this subject as (i) the AE intensity was mild and (ii) the AE occurred later than 7 
h after dosing of nintedanib. 
Concomitant medication due to adverse events 
One subject used a concomitant medication for the AE and received topical aciclovir for oral herpes.  
This concomitant treatment was deemed not to interfere with the bioanalytical assays for nintedanib and 
its metabolites or bosentan.

administration of nintedanib alone or in combination with bosentan (treated set) 
DEATHS - OTHER SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EVENTS 
No  deaths  and  no  other  SAEs  occurred  in  this  trial  in  healthy  male  subjects.  Adverse  events  of  special 
interest had not been defined for this clinical trial. None of the AEs fulfilled the ICH E3 criteria of ‘other 
significance’. 
CLINICAL LABORATORY EVALUATION 
There  were  no  clinically  important,  treatment-emergent  changes  in  safety  laboratory  parameters 
(haematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry) throughout the course of the trial. Occasionally, deviations 
of individual laboratory values from the reference ranges occurred. One subject showed isolated elevations 
in ALT/GPT at several time points during the trial (maximum 66 U/L at Visit 3/96 h; reference range 0-50 
U/L) that were not accompanied by elevations in AST/GOT, GGT, or AP. At the end-of-trial examination, 
ALT/GPT was again within the reference range (48 U/L). None of the observed deviations from reference 
ranges was judged by the investigator as clinically relevant and none was documented as an AE. 
Urinalysis  was  done  by  qualitative/semi-quantitative  urine  dipstick  analysis  at  the  screening  and  end-of 
trial  examinations;  urinary  sediment  was  only  performed  in  case  of  abnormal  dipstick  findings.  Urinary 
dipstick analyses were normal except for isolated findings in 2 subjects at the end-of-trial examination (One

Subject had RBCs in urine, Another Subject had protein in urine; urinary sediments revealed corresponding 
findings) 
VITAL SIGNS - PHYSICAL FINDINGS AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS RELATED TO SAFETY 
Evaluation  of  individual  vital  signs  data  (blood  pressure  and  pulse  rate)  did  not  reveal  any  clinically 
important abnormal findings. All subjects had systolic blood pressure values >90 and <140 mmHg except 
for one Subject who had an isolated finding of 142 mmHg at -1 h on Day 1/Visit 2 (screening value 135 
mmHg). Diastolic blood pressure values were within the range of >50 to ≤90 mmHg in all subjects. Pulse 
rate ranged between 45 and 90 bpm in all subjects except for one Subject who had an isolated finding of 
101 bpm at -1 h on Day 1/Visit 2 (screening value 85 bpm).  
The  investigator  did  neither  document  baseline  conditions  nor  AEs  in  any  subject  related  to  abnormal 
findings in vital signs. The investigator did not document any abnormal findings in physical examinations 
or ECG recordings as a baseline condition or an AE. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Dose reduction/discontinuation 
Adverse  events  leading  to  permanent  dose  reduction  over  52  weeks  The  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  a 
permanent  dose  reduction  was  substantially  higher  in  the  nintedanib  group  than  in  the  placebo  group 
(nintedanib: 34.0%; placebo: 3.5%). In the nintedanib group, such AEs most frequently belonged to the 
SOC  gastrointestinal  disorders  (27.1%)  and  were  mostly  diarrhoea  events  (22.2%).  The  second  most 
frequent SOC was investigations (4.9%), with ALT increased reported most frequently (1.4%).  
Adverse  events  leading  to  premature  discontinuation  of  trial  medication  over  52  weeks.  Adverse  events 
leading  to  premature  discontinuation  of  trial  medication  were  reported  for  16.0%  of  patients  in  the 
nintedanib  group  and  8.7%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group.  In  the  nintedanib  group,  such  AEs  most 
frequently belonged to the SOC gastrointestinal disorders (9.4%), with diarrhoea reported most frequently 
(6.9%). 
The most common AEs leading to permanent dose reduction were diarrhoea (nintedanib: 22.2%; placebo: 
1.0%), nausea (2.1% vs. 0.0%), vomiting (2.1% vs. 0.0%), and alanine aminotransferase increased (1.4% 
vs.  0.0%).  The  most  common  AEs  leading  to  premature  treatment  discontinuation  were  diarrhoea 
(nintedanib: 6.9%; placebo: 0.3%), nausea (2.1% vs. 0.0%), and vomiting (1.4% vs. 0.3%). 
Table 54 Allowed dose reduction or treatment interruption periods of nintedanib in trial 
Post marketing experience 
Nintedanib (Ofev®) is authorised in more than 65 countries worldwide for the treatment of IPF and to 
slow disease progression. Cumulative patient exposure to marketed Ofev® until October 2018 was 
estimated to be 60,107 PY. The most common AEs reported postmarketing are gastrointestinal disorders, 
with diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting being the most frequent. Most of these events were of mild or 
Assessment report

moderate intensity, non-serious, and were managed by symptomatic treatment and/or temporary 
interruption and/or reduction of the nintedanib dose. 
The clinically most relevant unfavourable effects of Ofev®, both in clinical trials and postmarketing, are 
diarrhoea, increased liver enzymes and bilirubin elevations including DILI, bleeding, and myocardial 
infarction. 
Diarrhoea is the most frequently reported side effect of Ofev® from post-marketing sources (reporting 
rate 357.43 per 1000 PY); the majority of cases were non-serious. For liver enzyme and bilirubin 
elevations, including DILI with fatal outcome, non-serious and serious cases have been observed with 
Ofev® treatment (reporting rate 64.5 per 1000 PY). The majority of hepatic events occurred within the 
first 3 months of treatment. Increases in liver enzyme and bilirubin are generally reversible upon dose 
reduction or interruption. 
For bleeding, non-serious and serious events, some of which were fatal, have been reported in the post-
marketing setting (reporting rate 43.5 per 1000 PY). Non-serious epistaxis was the most frequent 
bleeding event. 
For myocardial infarction, mostly serious cases have been reported in the post-marketing setting 
(reporting rate 5.6 per 1000 PY). In many of these cases, the presence of risk factors for coronary artery 
disease was reported. Further information is available in the most recent PBRER of Ofev®. 
Three cases of off-label use of nintedanib in SSc have been reported, without reports of AEs or SAEs. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  assessment  of  nintedanib  in  patients  with  SSc-associated  ILD  was  primarily  based  on  trial 
1199.214.  This  was  a  multinational,  prospective,  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind  Phase  III 
trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of nintedanib 150 mg bid in patients with SSc-associated ILD. 
The  main  efficacy  analysis  was  performed  after  52  weeks  of  treatment.  To  collect  additional  safety  and 
efficacy data, patients stayed on blinded trial treatment for up to 100 weeks. 
After  completion  of  trial  1199.214,  patients  who  did  not  prematurely  discontinue  trial  medication  could 
participate in the open-label extension trial 1199.225. Trial 1199.225 will assess the long-term safety of 
nintedanib in patients with SSc-associated ILD. Data from this trial are not included in this submission. 
The  safety  results  from  trial  1199.214  is  supported  by  the  Phase  I  drug-drug  interaction  study,  trial 
1199.239,  which  investigated  the  influence  of  multiple  doses  of  bosentan  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  a 
single  dose  of  nintedanib  150  mg  in  healthy  male  subjects.  1199.0340  Trial,  a  DDI  of  nintedanib  and 
hormonal contraception is currently ongoing. 
The existing safety profile of nintedanib in the IPF population is considered supportive for safety in patients 
with SSc-ILD  along with post-marketing data. 
 The main assessment of safety was carried out on data collected up to Week 52, representing mean (SD) 
exposure to trial medication of 10.52 (3.43) months in the nintedanib group and 11.35 (2.39) months in 
the placebo group. The extent of exposure fulfils the requirement of more than 100 patients with one year 
of treatment as per ICH E1 for non-life threatening diseases. 
Overall, the safety findings of this trial were consistent with the known safety profile of nintedanib in IPF. 
Furthermore, there was consistency in the safety findings for the 52-weeks data and the whole trial data. 
Angiogenesis is critical to foetal development. Following administration of nintedanib to rats, the inhibition 
of angiogenesis resulted in absorption of foetuses and increased incidence of malformations. These effects 
occurred at dose levels resulting in plasma drug concentrations similar to, or lower than, those reached in 
Assessment report

humans during treatment with nintedanib.  Women of childbearing potential not using a highly effective 
method of birth control were therefore excluded from all studies with nintedanib. Women who were 
pregnant or breast feeding were also excluded. None of the female patients became pregnant during the 
nintedanib studies.  
As scleroderma affects a younger female population relative to the current indication of idiopathic lung 
fibrosis and Nintedanib may potentially cause foetal harm in humans based on preclinical studies. It was 
agreed to contra indicate use of Ofev in pregnancy (See Section 4.3 of the SmPC). In addition, using 
hormonal contraceptives must add a barrier method as it is currently unknown whether nintedanib may 
reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives should use highly effective contraception ( see SmPC 
section 4.6). 
Adverse events 
Gastrointestinal  disorders  were  the  most  frequently  reported  AEs.  Their  incidence  was  higher  in  the 
nintedanib group than in the placebo group (88.2% vs. 56.9% over 52 weeks), specifically for diarrhoea, 
nausea,  and  vomiting.  Most  gastrointestinal  events  were  non-serious.  Of  note,  the  incidence  of 
gastrointestinal  events  was  higher  than  in  the  pooled  INPULSIS®  (IPF)  trials  in  both  treatment  groups 
(76.5% vs. 39.7%). This is likely due to gastrointestinal manifestations of SSc. 
Most of the diarrhoea AEs were of CTCAE grade 1 (increase of <4 stools over baseline; 56.8%) or grade 2 
(increase of 4 to 6 stools over baseline; 31.5%). Most events responded to treatment or did not require 
treatment.  Most  events  were  not  considered  to  be  related  to  SSc.  The  most  common  severe  AEs  in  the 
nintedanib  group  belonged  to  the  SOC  gastrointestinal  disorders,  with  diarrhoea  as  the  most  frequently 
reported  PT  in  the  nintedanib  group.  Pre-disposition  to  gastrointestinal  events  did  not  seem  to  have  an 
influence on the incidence of diarrhoea AEs in this trial. 
Over 52 weeks, 40.6% of patients in the nintedanib group and 5.9% of patients in the placebo group were 
reported  with  at  least  1  other  significant  AE.  The  most  common  other  significant  AEs  in  both  treatment 
groups were reported in the SOC gastrointestinal disorders, with diarrhoea (nintedanib 26.4% vs. placebo 
1.0%) being the most frequent PT. 
In line with the findings for gastrointestinal disorders, the incidences of decreased appetite and weight loss 
were higher in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group. 
Elevations of liver enzymes, specifically of ALT, GGT, and AST, were more frequent in the nintedanib group 
than in the placebo group. Specifically, elevations in ALT and/or AST ≥3x ULN over 52 weeks were more 
common in the nintedanib group (4.9%) than in the placebo group (0.7%). These results are in line with 
data obtained in the INPULSIS® trials, in which such elevations were reported for about 5% of patients in 
the  nintedanib  group.  Liver  enzyme  elevations  typically  occurred  early  in  the  course  of  treatment  and 
normalised  at  the  subsequent  visits,  following  treatment  interruption,  dose  reduction,  or  treatment 
discontinuation. All liver laboratory test abnormalities reported as AEs were non-serious.  
Importantly, even though there were some patients with events included in the ‘hepatic failure’ SMQ, clinical 
liver failure was not reported in either treatment group. There was no Hy’s law case. 
The applicant has generated exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety models using data from IPF and SSc-
ILD trials. For the exposure-safety model, a positive correlation between nintedanib plasma exposure and 
ALT  or  AST  elevations  ≥  3  x  ULN  was  confirmed.  Gender  was  identified  as  a  significant  covariate  with 
females  3  times  more  likely  to  develop  ALT  or  AST  elevations.  These  results  are  in  agreement  with  the 
previous model established in IPF patients and the warnings/precautions existing in the SmPC.   
The proportion of patients with bleeding events over 52 weeks was higher in the nintedanib group (11.1%) 
than in the placebo group (8.3%). These results are in line with data observed in the INPULSIS® trials, in 
which  bleeding  was  reported  for  10.3%  of  patients  in  the  nintedanib  group  and  7.8%  of  patients  in  the 
Assessment report

placebo  group.  The  majority  of  bleeding  events  in  trial  1199.214  were  non-serious  cases  of  epistaxis, 
contusion, and rectal haemorrhage, with the 2 latter PTs driving the difference to placebo. 
Myocardial infarction is an important identified risk of nintedanib in IPF in the EU, and is monitored as an 
important potential risk as part of arterial thromboembolism. In the pooled INPULSIS® trials, while AEs 
reflecting ischaemic heart disease were balanced between the treatment groups, a higher percentage of 
patients  in  the  nintedanib  group  (1.6%)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (0.5%)  was  reported  with  the  PTs 
myocardial  infarction  or  acute  myocardial  infarction.  In  trial  1199.214,  the  proportions  of  patients  with 
MACE and other serious cardiovascular AEs were low and balanced between the treatment groups. 
Myocardial  infarction  was  not  reported  in  the  nintedanib  group  of  trial  1199.214.  The  incidence  of  non-
serious hypertension, a labelled side effect of nintedanib in IPF, was higher in the nintedanib group than in 
the placebo group. Consistently, marked increases in mean diastolic blood pressure were more frequent in 
the nintedanib group. 
Laboratory  findings  were  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile.  Warnings pertaining  to  elevated  liver 
enzymes in the SmPC and dose reduction/cessation guidance is adequate for the safety data demonstrated 
in  1199.214  SSc-ILD  Trial.  Elevations  in  liver  enzymes  were  more  frequently  reported  in  the nintedanib 
group than in the placebo group. Importantly, no patient in the trial had liver enzyme elevations concurrent 
with an elevation in bilirubin that met Hy’s law criteria. A maximum ALT and/or AST ≥3x ULN was observed 
for 4.9% of patients in the nintedanib group and for 0.7% of patients in the placebo group. More than half 
of the patients (9/16 patients) with a liver enzyme elevation in the nintedanib group experienced the first 
liver  enzyme  elevation  within  the  first  2  months  of  treatment.  All  events  in  both  treatment  groups 
normalised at the following visits. In the nintedanib group, the events resolved after treatment interruption, 
dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. There were no notable changes in other clinical laboratory test 
parameters including haematology, electrolytes, and urinalysis. 
Some differences in the AE patterns between patients with SSc-ILD and patients with IPF were apparent. 
Specific for patients with SSc-ILD and consistent with the SSc disease was the occurrence of skin ulcers, 
which was balanced between the nintedanib group and the placebo group. Moreover, AEs within the SOC 
infections and infestations were reported more frequently in both treatment groups in this trial (nintedanib: 
62.5%;  placebo:  63.5%  over  52  weeks)  than  in  the  pooled  INPULSIS®  trials  (56.3%  vs.  53.9%).  The 
considerable proportion of patients with SSc taking immunosuppressive co-medication might explain this 
difference. 
Adverse drug reactions 
Among  the  AEs  reported  as  drug-related  by  investigators,  urinary  tract  infection,  fatigue,  myalgia,  and 
arthralgia have not been associated with nintedanib in previous clinical trials and development programs. 
These events were considered associated with the underlying SSc- ILD disease of the trial population and 
therefore  not considered for inclusion in the SmPC at present. 
ADRs  reported  with  increased  frequency  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC,  in  the  SSc  population  include 
hypertension,  vomiting,  elevated  alkaline  phosphatase  and  renal  failure.  ADRs  reported  with  decreased 
frequency in the SSc population include dehydration, MI, pancreatitis, hyperbilirubinaemia and rash. These 
are consistent with the safety profile reported in the 1199.214 SSc-ILD Trial and are discussed in previous 
sections. 
Serious adverse events 
The overall incidence of SAEs was similar in both treatment groups (nintedanib: 24.0%; placebo: 21.5%). 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders was the most frequently reported SOC (9.4% vs. 8.7%). 
The most common serious adverse events (SAEs) by PT were (sorted by frequency in the nintedanib group) 
pneumonia  (nintedanib:  2.8%;  placebo:  0.3%),  interstitial  lung  disease  (2.4%  vs.  1.7%),  pulmonary 
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020 
Page 105/119 
 
  
  
hypertension  (1.4%  vs.  1.4%),  dyspnoea  (1.0%  vs.  1.7%),  pulmonary  fibrosis  (1.0%  vs.  1.4%),  acute 
kidney injury (1.0% vs. 0.3%), pulmonary arterial hypertension (1.0% vs. 0.0%), and systemic sclerosis 
pulmonary (0.7% vs. 1.0%). 
The  SAEs  of  acute  kidney injury  was  reported  at  a greater  frequency  than  the  known  safety  profile  and  
reflected in Section 4.8 of the SmPC under renal failure.  
Over the whole trial, 10 patients in the nintedanib group (3.5%) and 2 patients in the placebo group (0.7%) 
were reported with serious pneumonia. In addition, 1 patient in the nintedanib group was reported with 
serious bacterial pneumonia. 
The  applicant  has  concluded  a  safety  review  of  the  pneumonia  cases  and  concluded  that  there  are 
alternative explanations for pneumonia for the majority of cases, with no identifiable pattern for the serious 
pneumonia cases with nintedanib. In addition, a post-hoc analysis based on multiple PTs indicative of lower 
respiratory tract infections was conducted and found the overall incidence of lower respiratory tract infection 
AEs including pneumonia, was balanced between the 2 treatment groups, with an imbalance towards the 
nintedanib group for SAEs. The exclusion of pneumonia as a known ADR is considered justified. 
Worsening of the underlying disease was to be reported as (S)AE in this trial. The proportion of patients 
reported with the PT ILD was slightly higher in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group. Post-hoc 
analysis used several other terms to report worsening of the underlying disease, specifically the PTs SSc 
pulmonary, pulmonary fibrosis, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory failure. Based on all these terms, 
the overall incidence of AEs and SAEs indicative of worsening of the underlying disease remained slightly 
increased in the nintedanib group for AEs and equal in groups for SAEs over 52 weeks. 
Safety in special populations was consistent with the known safety profile of nintedanib. Overall, the safety 
profile  for  nintedanib  was  consistent  across  the  pre-specified  subgroups.  The  incidence  of  SAEs  in  the 
nintedanib group was higher for Black/African American patients (40.0%) than for Asian (25.8%) and White 
(22.4%)  patients.  However,  as  the  number  of  Black/African  American  patients  was  relatively  small,  the 
findings need to be interpreted with caution. Gastrointestinal disorders, specifically vomiting and nausea, 
as well as elevations in liver enzymes were more frequent in women than in men treated with nintedanib. 
Hepatobiliary AEs in the nintedanib group were more frequent in patients of Asian race, low body weight, 
and  those  with  limited  cutaneous  SSc  subtype.  However,  the  higher  proportion  of  Asians  in  the  limited 
cutaneous  SSc  subgroup  than  in  the  diffuse  cutaneous  SSc  subgroup  may  have  contributed  to  these 
findings. 
Pulmonary hypertension is a recognised feature of ILD associated with SSc. From a theoretical perspective, 
the known anti-angiogenic action of nintedanib may improve or worsen pulmonary hypertension, and there 
is no clear evidence in humans to establish which is more likely to occur in this patient population. There 
are  also  risks  in  relation  to  pulmonary  haemorrhage.  1199.214  SSc-ILD  Trial  excluded  the  SSc  patients 
with significant pulmonary hypertension (PH). Doppler echocardiography was completed for 107 patients 
in the nintedanib group and 96 patients in the placebo group. The proportion of patients with changes from 
baseline was low and similar in the 2 treatment groups (nintedanib: 8 patients, 7.5%; placebo: 7 patients, 
7.3%). There was no difference between placebo and nintedanib in AEs for pulmonary hypertension. There 
were no relevant findings in the subgroups for pulmonary hypertension events. Given the exclusion of SSc 
patients with significant pulmonary hypertension into the trial the PT of Pulmonary hypertension was  added 
to the RMP as Missing information.  
Additional expert consultations 
An ad-hoc expert group was convened on 22 January 2020, where the population of patients with 
pulmonary hypertension was discussed. (Please refer to the discussion on efficacy)

2.5.1.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported AEs, specifically for diarrhoea, nausea, and 
vomiting. The most common severe AEs reported was diarrhoea. In addition, concomitant AEs were 
common, 40.6% of patients in the nintedanib group and 5.9% of patients in the placebo group with 
diarrhoea being the most frequent PT occurring with at least one other AE. Other very common GI ADRs 
included abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Other important risks including elevations of liver 
enzymes, bleeding events, myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, hypertension and decreased weight 
and apetite are in line with the known safety profile and the changes introduced in the SmPC section 4.8 
and RMP adequately addresses risk mitigation measures for these ADRs.  
Following administration of nintedanib to rats, the inhibition of angiogenesis resulted in absorption of 
foetuses and increased incidence of malformations. These effects occurred at dose levels resulting in 
plasma drug concentrations similar to, or lower than, those reached in humans during treatment with 
nintedanib. Women of childbearing potential not using a highly effective method of birth control were 
therefore excluded from all studies with nintedanib. Women who were pregnant or breast feeding were 
also excluded. Therefore, as patients with SSc-ILD are younger patients than ILD patients, a 
contraindication in pregnancy is introduced. 
Pulmonary hypertension is a recognised feature of ILD associated with SSc. From a theoretical 
perspective, the known anti-angiogenic action of nintedanib may improve or worsen pulmonary 
hypertension, and there is no clear evidence in humans to establish which is more likely to occur in this 
patient population. Given the exclusion of SSc patients with significant pulmonary hypertension into the 
trial the PT of Pulmonary hypertension was added to the RMP as missing information, following PRAC 
assessment.  
A warning was introduced in section 4.4 to state that Ofev should not be used in patients with severe 
pulmonary hypertension and that close monitoring of patients with mild to moderate pulmonary 
hypertension is recommended. 
The following safety aspects are recommended to be further characterised in a post approval setting:

2.5.2.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Based on the approval of the new indication in a different and younger population  that the existing  
approved indication, the CHMP is of the opinion that the already existing entry in the EURD list for 
nintedanib needs to be amended as follows: the PSUR cycle for the medicinal product should follow a 
half-yearly cycle. The next data lock point will be 15/04/2020.

missing information given that the limited number of subjects with mild/moderate pulmonary 
hypertension at baseline included in trial 1199.214. Therefore, the safety in this subgroup of population is 
considered as missing information.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
This variation is for an extension of indication to include new indication for OFEV for the treatment of 
Systemic Sclerosis associated Interstitial Lung Disease (SSc-ILD). 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Systemic sclerosis presents with diverse organ manifestations. The disease follows a variable and 
unpredictable course, but organ manifestations tend to become evident in the early stages of disease. In 
a study of patients with early SSc in the EUSTAR cohort, skin sclerosis, gastrointestinal, and pulmonary 
involvement were the earliest organ manifestations to appear and were evident in the majority of patients 
one year after the onset of Raynaud’s phenomenon (which is the first symptom of SSc in most patients). 
Estimates of the prevalence of ILD in patients with SSc vary widely (from ~20% to ~65%), depending on 
the criteria used to define ILD. Although the clinical course of SSc-ILD is unpredictable in an individual 
patient, disease progression occurs predominantly in the first years after diagnosis. Currently, pulmonary 
fibrosis is the leading cause of death in patients with SSc.  
Median survival is 5 to 8 years in SSc-associated ILD. Skin involvement is observed in the majority of 
patients with SSc and is one of the earliest disease manifestations. Although skin thickness tends to 
worsen in early SSc and improve in later stages of the disease, worsening/improvement of skin fibrosis is 
unpredictable for an individual patient. In patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc, a high mRSS score is 
associated with mortality.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The EULAR treatment guideline recommends that cyclophosphamide be considered for the treatment of 
SSc-ILD, in particular for patients with progressive ILD. In the randomised, placebo-controlled 
Scleroderma Lung Study I, cyclophosphamide showed a significant but modest benefit in FVC% predicted 
at 1 year. The mean change from baseline in FVC at Week 48 was -1.0% predicted in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020 
Page 113/119 
 
  
  
 
 
cyclophosphamide group and -2.6% predicted in the placebo group. However, the use of and the duration 
of treatment with cyclophosphamide are limited due to its toxicity, which manifests in, among others, 
myelosuppression and increased cancer risk. 
Although no recommendation is given in the guideline, in some regions, mycophenolate is used frequently 
on an empirical basis for the treatment of SSc-ILD. 
The EULAR guideline recommends methotrexate to be considered for the treatment of skin manifestations 
of early diffuse cutaneous SSc. 
The EULAR guideline recommends that haematopoietic stem cell transplant be considered for a small 
selected subgroup of patients with rapidly progressive SSc at risk of organ failure.  
Other immunosuppressive drugs, such as azathioprine, rituximab, or cyclosporine A may be used in 
individual cases, although there are no placebo-controlled studies to corroborate their efficacy. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This was a phase 3 double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase III trial (SENSCIS) in patients 
with SSc-ILD.  
Patients were diagnosed with SSc-ILD based upon the 2013 American College of Rheumatology / 
European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria for SSc and a chest high resolution computed 
tomography (HRCT) scan conducted within the previous 12 months. A total of 580 patients were 
randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Ofev 150 mg bid or matching placebo for at least 52 weeks, of 
which 576 patients were treated. Randomisation was stratified by antitopoisomerase antibody status 
(ATA). Individual patients stayed on blinded trial treatment for up to 100 weeks (median Ofev exposure 
15.4 months; mean Ofev exposure 14.5 months). 
The primary endpoint was the annual rate of decline in FVC over 52 weeks. Key secondary endpoints 
were absolute change from baseline in the modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) at week 52 and absolute 
change from baseline in the Saint George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at week 52. 
Annual rate of decline in FVC 
The annual rate of decline of FVC (mL) over 52 weeks was significantly reduced by 41.0 mL in patients 
receiving Ofev compared to patients receiving placebo (Table 8) corresponding to a relative treatment 
effect of 43.8%.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
In patients receiving treatment with nintedanib for 52 weeks a significantly lower annual rate of decline in 
FVC was reported as compared to patients the placebo group. The adjusted difference between the 
treatment groups was 40.95 mL/year (95% CI 2.88, 79.01) with a statistically significant p-value of 
0.0350. This corresponded to a relative treatment effect of 43.8% reduction in FVC decline compared to 
placebo. 
Other endpoints which investigated changes in FVC such as the annual rate of decline in FVC % predicted 
over 52 weeks or absolute change from baseline in FVC in mL at Week 52 showed smaller decline in the 
nintedanib group as compared to the placebo group.  
In addition, available limited data do not suggest a substantial loss of the treatment effect over time. 
The difference between groups (45.95 ml/year) recorded in this study was lower as compared to the 
difference reported studies investigating the treatment in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis 
(IPF). In trials INPULSIS-1, INPULSIS-2 (pooled data) the observed difference between the treatment and 
placebo group was 109.9 ml.   
It is acknowledged that ILD in patients with SSc is progressing more slowly as compared to patients with 
IPF. In the placebo group of the pooled INPULSIS trials (in patients with IPF), the rate of decline in FVC 
over 52 weeks was -224 mL/year whereas this rate in the placebo group in SENSCIS study (in patients 
with SSc-ILD) was smaller e.g 93 mL/year. Therefore, it is understandable that a smaller treatment effect 
(in absolute terms) was seen in SENSCIS study (SSc-ILD) as compared to INPULSIS trials (IPF). 
However, the relative reduction in the annual FVC decline was similar for both SSc-ILD and IPF patients.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
A small decrease in the annual decline in FVC reported in the nintedanib group was not linked to any 
improvement in patient reported outcomes. In fact, there was a trend towards reduction of the quality of 
life in patients on nintedanib as compared to those on placebo.  
In addition, no improvement or even a small deterioration from baseline was noticeable in the nintedanib 
group for other assessed patient reported outcomes, based on questionnaires and the VAS scores, over 
52 weeks. 
Nintedanib had no effect on the skin fibrosis. No significant changes between the groups were reported 
for the modified Rodnan Skin Score -the adjusted mean difference was -0.21 (95% CI -0.94, 0.53, p = 
0.5785). Also no change from baseline was observed for the digital ulcer net burden at Week 52. 
No meaningful treatment difference was observed for the absolute change form baseline in DLco in % 
predicted at Week 52 between the treatment groups.  
There was no significant deference in the number of deaths at week 100 (10 patients (3.5%) in the 
nintedanib group and 9 patients (3.1%) in the placebo group. There were no survival benefits apart from 
FVC in the study.  
Declines in FVC have been associated with reduced survival time in observational cohorts in patients with 
in IPF. The applicant claims that these observations made in the population of patients with IPF could be 
extrapolated to patients with SSc-ILD and therefore the observed reductions in annual rate of decline in 
FVC over 52 weeks in  the nintedanib group as compared to the placebo group is likely to be linked to the 
improvement of survival of SSc-ILD patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020 
Page 115/119 
 
  
  
It was acknowledged that the disease progression in SSc-ILD is normally not as fast as in the IPF. The 
limitation of the pivotal study is that it was designed for SSc-ILD with only 1 year follow up, however the 
beneficial effects would more likely be demonstrated over a longer duration. However, the beneficial 
effects in terms of survival, efficacy, quality of life and pattern of disease as well as efficacy and safety 
especially in patients with PAH are not entirely clear over longer term and would benefit for further 
characterisation in the post approval setting. Therefore, the MAH agreed to conduct a post approval study 
and discuss the protocol with the CHMP in the context of a Scientific Advice. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety findings of 1199.214 SSc-ILD Trial were consistent with the known safety profile of 
nintedanib in IPF including post-marketing data. Different frequencies were noticed with the safety profile 
observed in patients with ILD and the section 4.8 updated accordingly. Additional safety information 
included interactions with bosentan. 
Other important risks including elevations of liver enzymes, bleeding events, myocardial infarction, acute 
kidney injury, hypertension and decreased weight and appetite are in line with the known safety profile 
and the SmPC and RMP adequately addresses risk mitigation measures for these ADRs.  
In animal studies nintenanib inhibited angiogenegis resulting in absorption of foetuses and increased 
incidence of malformations at dose levels similar to those reached in humans. Women of childbearing 
potential not using a highly effective method of birth control were therefore excluded from all studies with 
nintedanib. Women who were pregnant or breast feeding were also excluded. Therefore, as patients with 
SSc-ILD are younger patients than ILD patients, a contraindication of use during pregnancy is introduced. 
Regarding SAEs, over the whole trial, 10 patients in the nintedanib group (3.5%) and 2 patients in the 
placebo group (0.7%) were reported with serious pneumonia. In addition, 1 patient in the nintedanib 
group was reported with serious bacterial pneumonia. For the majority of cases, no identifiable pattern 
for the serious pneumonia cases with nintedanib could be identified. In addition, a post-hoc analysis on 
AEs and SAEs based on multiple PTs indicative of lower respiratory tract infections did not identify an 
imbalance between the 2 treatment groups for AEs in contrast to SAEs for nintedanib group. 
The proportion of patients reported with the PT ILD  (worsening of the underlying disease) was slightly 
higher in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group. Post-hoc analysis showed less of a difference 
between the nintedanib and placebo groups however incidence remained slightly increased in the 
nintedanib group for AEs and equal in groups for SAEs over 52 weeks.  
Pulmonary hypertension is a recognised feature of ILD associated with SSc. From a theoretical 
perspective, the known anti-angiogenic action of nintedanib may improve or worsen pulmonary 
hypertension, and there is no clear evidence in humans to establish which is more likely to occur in this 
patient population. Given the exclusion of SSc patients with significant pulmonary hypertension into the 
trial the PT of Pulmonary hypertension is mentioned in the RMP as missing information. In conclusion the 
CHMP considered Ofev should not be used in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and that close 
monitoring of patients with mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension would be needed. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Some ADRs had an impact on quality of life: Gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported 
AEs, specifically for diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting. CTCAE Grade 2 diarrhoea is defined as an increase 
of 4 to 6 stools over baseline, which is a significant increase from baseline from a quality of life 
perspective. The most common severe AEs reported was diarrhoea. In addition, concomitant AEs were 
Assessment report  
EMA/155527/2020 
Page 116/119 
 
  
  
common, 40.6% of patients in the nintedanib group and 5.9% of patients in the placebo group with 
diarrhoea being the most frequent PT occurring with at least one other AE. Other very common GI ADRs 
included abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. 
The exclusion of pneumonia as a known ADR is justified. No discernible pattern was found to justify the 
aetiology or relation to SSc therefore drug-related cannot be ruled out, given that the incidence as an 
SAE is greater, pneumonia is recommended to be considered as an important potential risk following 
PRAC review.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
It is recognised that systemic sclerosis, in particular the associated ILD, represent a high unmet medical 
need, as currently no approved disease-modifying treatments exist. In addition, Median survival in SSc-
associated ILD is only 5 to 8 years after diagnosis. 
In patients receiving treatment with nintedanib for 52 weeks a significantly lower annual rate of decline in 
FVC was reported as compared to patients the placebo group. 
The adjusted difference between the treatment groups was 40.95 mL/year (95% CI 2.88, 79.01) with a 
statistically significant p-value of 0.0350. This corresponded to a relative treatment effect of 43.8% 
reduction in FVC decline compared to placebo. 
Treatment with nintedanib was no linked to survival benefits in the study; however, it could be agreed 
that the study was too short to investigate survival.  
In general, the safety profile is consistent with the known safety profile of nintedanib.  
Following discussion from the Ad hoc expert meeting, the CHMP agreed that the beneficial effects seen in 
SENSCIS study are clinically meaningful and relevant. 
Thus, the CHMP considered that the product could be approved for the treatment in patients with SSc-ILD 
however, recommended the MAH to generate further long-term efficacy and safety data in a post 
marketing efficacy study which is to be agreed with CHMP in Q3 2020 through a scientific advice 
consultation.

1.  Introduction 
Perampanel is a highly selective non-competitive AMPA-type glutamate receptor antagonist. In the EU, 
Fycompa  (perampanel),  following  the  recent  extension  of  indication  in  the  paediatric  population 
(EMEA/H/C/002434/II/0047), is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of: 
- 
partial-onset seizures (POS) with or without secondarily generalised seizures in patients from 4 
years of age and older. 
- 
primary generalised tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures in patients from 7 years of age and older with 
idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE). 
Perampanel  has  also  been  approved  as  monotherapy  or  adjunctive  therapy  in  pediatric  patients  with 
POS aged 4 years and older in the US as of September 2018. The International Birth Date is 23 July 
2012  in  the  EU  (via  the  centralized  procedure).  Perampanel  is  marketed  under  the  trade  name 
Fycompa and is available as 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-mg tablets and 0.5 mg/ml oral suspension. 
With  this  post-authorisation  measure  (PAM)  EISAI  is  hereby  submitting  final  study  results  and  report 
related  to  paediatric  population  in  line  with  Article  46  of  paediatric  regulation  1901/2006  for  Study 
E2007-M065-411  (Study  411).  Study  411  was  a  Phase  4,  observational,  open-label,  post  marketing, 
non-interventional  drug  monitoring  study,  to  collect  data  on  the  use  of  Fycompa  in  actual  clinical 
settings. The study was conducted in the hospitals of participating physicians/investigators in Taiwan. 
Male and female subjects (aged 12 years and older) who were diagnosed to have POS with or without 
SGS and who were appropriate to receive Fycompa according to the investigator, were eligible to enroll 
in  this  study.  The  purpose  of  Study  411  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  Fycompa  as  an 
adjunctive treatment of POS with or without SGS in subjects with epilepsy aged 12 years and older. 
On 27 October 2020, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Fycompa (perampanel), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. This study E2007-M065-411 
(Study  411)  which  was  completed  on  03  July  2017,  was  implemented  as  a  Taiwan  post-marketing, 
observational study following comments from the review of the marketing authorisation application by 
the  Taiwan  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (TFDA).  The  TFDA  requested  a  post-marketing,  safety 
monitoring study instead of a bridging study. 
The submission of the final clinical study report for Study 411 is being made to the European Medicines 
Agency to fulfil the obligation to present data from any MAH-sponsored study in a pediatric population. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Post-authorisation measure - Submission of paediatric study pursuant to article 
46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The investigational medicinal product tested in Study 411 was FYCOMPA as film-coated tablets of 2, 4 
and 8 mg.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  MAH  submitted  a  final  report  for  Study  E2007-M065-411  (hereafter  referred  to  as  Study  411), a 
Phase  4,  observational,  open-label,  post  marketing,  non-interventional  drug  monitoring  study  to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of Fycompa as an adjunctive treatment of POS with or without SGS in 
subjects with epilepsy aged 12 years and older 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
The  study  was  conducted  in  the  hospitals  of  the  participating  physician/investigators  in  Taiwan  to 
collect data on the use of Fycompa in actual clinical settings. 
Methods 
Objectives 
The  objectives  of  the  study  are  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  Fycompa  in  patients  with  the 
adjunctive  treatment  of  partial-onset  seizures  with  or  without  secondarily  generalized  seizures  in 
patients with epilepsy aged 12 years and older. 
Study design 
Study 411 has been designed to evaluate the safety profile of Fycompa prescribed as add-on therapy 
in  patients  with  epilepsy  in  Taiwan.  The  anti-epileptic  drugs  (AEDs)  were  prescribed  by  the  physician 
according to current and best medical practice. The study protocol did not prescribe or advise any drug 
or treatment for the study patients and they were given treatment according to investigators’ routine 
practice. There was no control group in the study. Figure 1 below represents the study design: 
EMA/114809/2021

CHMP comment:  
On Visit 0, there was the screening/baseline visit, conducted in Week-0 of the study, and the eligibility 
criteria were carried out, in particular the seizure count(s) in the past 4 weeks. 
On  treatment  phase,  the  patients  received  Fycompa  in  addition  to  their  current  AED;  the  treatment 
with Fycompa was initiated with a dose of 2 mg/day once daily before bedtime. During treatment, the 
maintenance dose ranged between 4 and 12 mg daily.  
The following assessments / procedures were carried out during the 50 weeks treatment period: 
- Recording seizure count(s) and seizure type(s) experienced by patient. 
- Collecting and recording concomitant drug treatment details of patient in the eCRF. 
- Examining and recording number and details of AE(s) experienced by patient. 
The Follow-Up visit was only performed for patients who discontinued prior to Week-52 and it had been 
conducted  after  2  weeks  of  ET  (Early  Termination)  visit.  The  same  assessments  and  procedures  as 
mentioned above were carried out during the 50 weeks treatment period. 
Study population /Sample size 
The study planned to enrol 100 patients (60 evaluable). Subjects were eligible for participation in the 
study if they were aged 12 years and older with a  diagnosis of partial-onset seizures with or without 
secondarily generalized seizures. 
CHMP comment:  
The  patients  were  selected  to  receive  Fycompa  as  an  adjunctive  treatment  starting  at  Visit  0  and 
according to investigator’s judgment. 
Treatments 
Fycompa  was  taken  as  a  single  oral  dose  taken  once  daily  before  bedtime.  Treatment  was  initiated 
with a dose of 2 mg/day as approved in the PIL.  
CHMP comment:  
The  dose  was  increased  based  on  clinical  response  and  tolerability  by  increments  of  2  mg/day  to  a 
maintenance dose of 4 mg/day to 12 mg/day. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
•  Safety:  
All Adverse Events (AEs) including Serious Adverse Events (SAEs). 
Adverse  Events  of  Special  Interest  (AESI)  such  as  Medication  Errors,  Lack  of  Therapeutic  Efficacy, 
Overdose, Abuse, Misuse, Off Label Use, Pregnancy and exposure to drug during breast feeding. 
• 
Efficacy :  
Change from Baseline in 28-day seizure count at the End of treatment. 
Response rate at Week 12, Week 24 and Week 52. Response was defined as >=50% reduction in 28-
day seizure frequency from Baseline. 
CHMP comment: 
Safety is the primary endpoint and efficacy the secondary. 
EMA/114809/2021

Statistical Methods 
•  Safety aspects: the number and percentage of patients with AEs/SAE and frequency/incidence 
of each type of AE/SAE were calculated.  
• 
Efficacy aspects: the mean change from baseline in 28-day seizure frequency at the end of the 
treatment and the 50% response rate after 12, 24 and 52 weeks of treatment were calculated. 
CHMP comment:  
As  this  is  an  open-label,  post  marketing,  non-interventional  drug  monitoring  study,  there  are  no 
statistical methods per se. The results are only observational. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
CHMP comment:  
This study was conducted between 11 Apr 2016 and 03 Jul 2017 at 3 study sites in Taiwan.  
117 subjects were enrolled into the study. Of these, 79 subjects completed the study (= 67.5% of all 
patients) and 38 discontinued (= 32.5% of all patients).  
The  main  reasons  for  discontinuation  are:  death  (n=2;  1.7%),  lack  of  efficacy  (n=  5;  4.3%),  lost  to 
FUp (n= 3; 2.6%), withdrawn consent (n= 11; 9.4%) and AE (n= 16; 13.7%).

Baseline data 
Table 1 
CHMP comment:  
The  mean  age  of  patients  is  32.8  years.  The  median  (minimum,  maximum)  age  of  the  enrolled 
subjects  was  31.0  (13.0, 65.0)  years.  There  were  69  (59.0%)  male  subjects and  48  (41.0%)  female 
subjects in the study. 
Around  20  %  of  subjects  were  taking  1  concomitant  AED,  nearly  1/3  of  subjects  were  taking  2 
concomitant AED, and almost 1/3 of subjects were taking 3 concomitant AED.  
Among the 117 subjects, only 13 (11.1%) subjects were 12 to 17 years of age, 99 (84.6%) subjects 
were  18  to  60  years  of  age  and  5  (4.3%)  subjects  were  above  60  years  of  age.  The  low  amount  of 
paediatrics in this study do not provide enough further safety data in this specific population. 
The  paediatrics  (12  to  17  years  of  age)  are  underrepresented,  which  undermines  the  validity  of  the 
study in this age cohort. No firm conclusion concerning this age group is therefore possible. 
Efficacy results 
During  this  study,  efficacy  assessments  were  evaluated  as  secondary  endpoints  and  included 
percentage  change  in  28-day  seizure  frequency  from  baseline  and  50%  responder  rate  (50%  or 
greater reduction in seizure frequency compared to baseline). 
EMA/114809/2021 
Page 7/8 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Table 2 
CHMP comment:  
Regarding the percentage change in 28-day seizure frequency from baseline, the mean ± SD seizure 
count at baseline was 9.39±26.65 seizures, with a mean ± SD change from baseline at Week 52 of –
1.78±15.93  seizures  (P=0.2342).  This  is  not  a  significant  result  however  no  firm  conclusion  can  be 
drawn from these efficacy data and do not challenge the known efficacy results for perampanel in the 
studied population, mainly in adults.

CHMP comment: 
Regarding the 50% responder rate (defined as 50% or greater reduction in 28-day seizure frequency 
from  baseline),  it  concerned  10.30%  (17/165)  subjects  at  Weeks  12,  10.07%  (15/149)  subjects  at 
Weeks 24, and 31.06% (41/132) subjects at Weeks 52. This endpoint is that recommended in EU by 
the guidelines. The study design do not lead to put in question the known efficacy results.  
Safety results 
Extent of Exposure 
Table 4 
CHMP comment: 
Subjects received Fycompa for up to 52 weeks. The mean daily dose during the study was 4.97±2.15 
mg/day and the mean daily dose based on the maximum dose taken by the subject during the study 
was 6.11±1.58 mg/day, respectively.  
The mean daily dose is in accordance with the dosing recommendation already approved in the SmPC 
for children above 12 years of age and adults for the treatment of POS, in conjunction with other AED.

Summary of TEAE 
Table 5 
A total of 232 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 78 (66.67%) subjects with 
47 (40.17%) subjects reporting AEs in the nervous system disorder SOC. 
There were 38 serious adverse events (SAE) reported in the study by 18 (15.4%) subjects of which a 
total of 8 SAEs were reported by 2 subjects between the ages of 12 and 17 years. The majority 
of  subjects  (15  out  of  18  i.e.  12.8%)  with  serious  TEAE  required  hospitalization  or  prolongation  of 
existing hospitalization. 
A  total  of  12  SAEs  were  reported  in  the  SOC  of  nervous  system  disorders  by  a  total  of  9  (7.69%) 
subjects and 5 SAEs were reported in the SOC psychiatric disorders by a total of 2 (1.71%) subjects.  
The  other  SAEs  were  of  renal  and  urinary  disorders,  neoplasms  benign,  malignant  and  unspecified 
(including cysts and polyps) ie, 3 events each.  
Of the SAEs, 9 events were considered possibly related to the study drug and the remaining SAEs were 
all considered not related to the study drug. 
For  36  subjects  (30.8%),  the  occurrence  of  TEAE  led  to  study  drug  dose  adjustment  in  15  subjects 
(33.3%) of the 4mg group and in 16 subjects (29.1%) of the 8mg group. For 23 subjects the TEAE led 
to study drug dose reduction and for 16 subjects the TEAE led to study or study drug withdrawal. 
There were two deaths in the 4mg group reported in the present study (see below for more details). 
EMA/114809/2021

CHMP comment: 
The most frequent SOC is related to nervous system disorders and psychiatric disorders in accordance 
with the known safety profile of perampanel. 
From  these  data,  no  further  safety  conclusion  could  be  drawn  regarding  the  paediatrics  for  the 
following  reasons:  they  represent  only  11%  of  the  overall  included  patients  and  the  MAH  did  not 
provide separate data for patients aged 12 to 17 years, as the data are mixed for the overall included 
patients. This issue is a flaw of this study not pursued. 
As detailed recently in the PSUSA  for perampanel, available post marketing data since the marketing 
authorization in July 2012 did not show additional risks associated with long-term use of perampanel. 
Nevertheless,  post-marketing  studies  are  ongoing  and  long  term  safety  in  adolescents  and  adults 
should remain a missing information in the PSUR. 
TEAE by SOC and PT for all enrolled subjects 
Among  the  232  events  in  78  subjects,  the  most  frequent  AE  occurring  in  more  than  10%  of  the 
subjects implied MedDRA SOC Nervous System Disorders.  
Indeed, seventy-four (74) subjects showed AE within this SOC: 31 events of dizziness and 15 events of 
headache which were common AEs in this SOC.  
The  other  common  AEs  were  psychiatric  disorders  (40  events)  mostly  irritability  with  16  events, 
infections and infestations (31 events) mostly upper respiratory tract infections with 19 events, general 
disorders (17 events) mostly malaise with 6 events, injury poisoning and procedural complications (14 
events) mostly wounds with 5 events.

CHMP comment: 
When  scrutinizing  more  in  detail  with  PT  classification,  the  most  common  AE  from  MedDRA  SOC 
Nervous  System  Disorders  are  those  already  stated  in  the  SmPC:  dizziness,  somnolence  and  ataxia. 
For  the  MedDRA  SOC  Psychotic  Disorders,  the  most  common  AE  are  irritability,  aggression  and 
agitation. 
The  AE  headache  which  is  one  of  the  most  frequent  AE  from  SOC  Nervous  System  Disorders  is  not 
stated in the SmPC nor mentioned in the recent PSUSA AR. 
Events  reported  in  patients  who  had  medical  history  of  suicidal  behaviours  were  consistent  with  the 
known safety profile of perampanel or could be related to the medical history of the patients. 
Severity of AE and relationship to study drug /outcome 
Of  the  232  TEAEs,  there  were  151  mild  AEs,  67  moderate  and  14  severe  AEs  reported  during  the 
study. 
The study drug dosage was decreased due to 30 TEAEs. 
The study drug was discontinued due to 26 TEAEs.  
Concomitant medication was given for 94 AEs, non-drug treatment was given for 33 AEs and no action 
was taken for 49 AEs. 
The relationship to study drug was reported as probably related for 55 TEAEs and possibly related for 
59 TEAEs. There were 118 TEAEs which were not related to the study drug. 
Regarding  the  outcome,  a  total  of  178  AEs  were  recovered/resolved  without  sequelae,  2  were 
recovered/resolved with sequelae and 27 AEs were reported as not recovered. 
CHMP comment: 
The most frequently reported TEAEs that led to discontinuation were irritability (6 [5.1%] subjects with 
6 events) and dizziness (3 [2.6%] subjects with 3 events) which are AE from the SOC Nervous System 
Disorders.  In  the  SmPC,  it  is  stated:  “The  adverse  reactions  most  commonly  ( ≥   1%  in  the  total 
perampanel  group  and  greater  than  placebo)  leading  to  discontinuation  were  dizziness  and 
somnolence”.  Therefore,  this  is  overall  in  line  with  what  was  observed  in  controlled  phase  3  studies 
assessing the efficacy and safety of perampanel when given for the treatment of POS in adjunction to 
other AED. Regarding the AE irritability, it is tabulated in section 4.8 as common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) 
and the frequency in study 411 is slightly higher with 13.68%. This is in the same range however no 
formal comparison is possible.

system  disorders,  including  dizziness,  headache  and  ataxia  among  others.  In  some  cases,  the  dose 
decrease was an option to continue the treatment. In other cases, the subjects discontinued the study 
or study treatment. No deaths were reported for subjects aged between 12 and 17 years.  
There  were  no  significant  changes  in  the  frequency  and  severity  of  previously  identified  adverse 
reactions apart from the AE headache. 
On  the  basis  of  the  review  of  the  AEs  and  TEAEs  in  this  study,  no  additional  changes  to  the  safety 
information  of  the  SmPC  are  requested  by  the  Applicant  which  is  acceptable.  However  the  AE 
“headache” may be possibly added to the SmPC in the future (15 events in 13 patients, frequency of 
11.11%  which  could  be  categorized  as  very  common).  Of  note,  this  AE  is  not  yet  discussed  in  the 
recent PSUSA and needs to be kept in mind and further explored. 
Regarding  efficacy,  which  is  the  secondary  endpoint  in  this  study,  there  is  a  non-significant  change 
from baseline in seizure count at week 52 [-1.78 (15.93), p = 0.2342]. This is not a significant result 
however  no  firm  conclusion  can  be  drawn  from  these  efficacy  data  and  do  not  challenge  the  known 
efficacy results for perampanel in the studied population, mainly in adults. Response rate was not high 
possibly explained by the studied population. 
3.  Rapporteur’s CHMP overall conclusion and 
recommendation 
The  MAH  submitted  the  results  of  study  411  in  order  to  fulfil  the  requirement  of  reporting  paediatric 
data  as  outlined  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  regulation  (EC)  no  1901/2006,  as  amended.  Only  a 
small number of paediatric patients were included in this study (i.e. 11% of the patients). 
The  MAH  determines  that  the  benefit-risk  ratio  for  Fycompa  remains  unchanged  and  positive  despite 
the non-significant  efficacy  result  at 52  weeks,  which  is  hardly  disputable  regarding  the  study  design 
(open-labelled, uncontrolled). Indeed the results of this study could only be considered as supportive 
of  the  known  safety  profile  and  efficacy  results  of  perampanel  in  adults  and  adolescents  above  12 
years of age and do not allow to draw any further robust conclusion.  
The  MAH  does  not  propose  any  changes  of  the  currently  approved  SmPC  based  on  the  present  data, 
which is supported. However, the AE “headache” needs to be kept in mind and further explored for its 
potential addition in the SmPC. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

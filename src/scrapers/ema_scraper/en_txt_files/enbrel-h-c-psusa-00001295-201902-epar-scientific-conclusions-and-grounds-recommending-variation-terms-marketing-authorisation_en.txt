Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for etanercept (except for biosimilars), 
the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Based on the review of the literature and spontaneous reporting presented in this PSUSA, covering the 
period from 03 February 2018 to 02 February 2019, as well as cumulative data since the European birth 
date, the PRAC considered that a causal relationship between inflammatory bowel disease and etanercept 
cannot be excluded and therefore recommends that the product information of medicinal products 
containing the active substance etanercept should be updated as follows: update of section 4.8 of the SmPC 
to add inflammatory bowel disease with a frequency uncommon. The package leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for etanercept (except for biosimilars) the CHMP is of the opinion 
that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing etanercept (except for biosimilars) is 
unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Voncento can be used for all age groups.
von Willebrand disease (VWD)
Prophylaxis and treatment of haemorrhage or surgical bleeding in patients with VWD, when 
desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or contraindicated. 
Haemophilia A (congenital FVIII deficiency)
Prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment of VWD and haemophilia A should be supervised by a physician experienced in the 
treatment of haemostatic disorders.
The decision on the use of the product at home for patients with VWD and with haemophilia A should 
be made by the treating physician who should ensure that appropriate training is provided and the use 
is reviewed at intervals.
The ratio between FVIII:C and VWF:RCo in a vial is approximately 1:2.4.
Treatment monitoring
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide the 
dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their 
response to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight 
may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical 
interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation 
analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.
Posology
von Willebrand disease
It is important to calculate the dose using the number of IU of VWF:RCo specified.
Generally, 1 IU/kg VWF:RCo raises the circulating level of VWF:RCo by 0.02 IU/ml (2 %).
Levels of VWF:RCo of > 0.6 IU/ml (60 %) and of FVIII:C of > 0.4 IU/ml (40 %) should be achieved.
3
On-demand treatment
Usually 40 - 80 IU/kg of von Willebrand factor (VWF:RCo) corresponding to 20 - 40 IU FVIII:C/kg 
of body weight (BW) are recommended to achieve haemostasis.
An initial dose of 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo may be required, especially in patients with type 3 VWD where 
maintenance of adequate levels may require greater doses than in other types of VWD.
Prevention of haemorrhage in case of surgery
For prevention of excessive bleeding during or after surgery the application should start 1 - 2 hours 
before the surgical procedure. 
An appropriate dose should be re-administered every 12 - 24 hours. The dose and duration of the 
treatment depend on the clinical status of the patient, the type and severity of the bleeding, and both 
VWF:RCo and FVIII:C levels.
When using a FVIII-containing VWF product, the treating physician should be aware that continued 
treatment may cause an excessive rise in FVIII:C. After 24 - 48 hours of treatment, in order to avoid 
an excessive rise in FVIII:C, reduced doses and/or prolongation of the dose interval or the use of a 
VWF product containing a low level of FVIII should be considered (see section 5.2). 
Prophylaxis treatment
For long term prophylaxis in patients with VWD, a dose of 25 - 40 IU VWF:RCo /kg body weight 
should be considered at a frequency of 1 to 3 times per week. In patients with gastrointestinal bleeds 
or menorrhagia, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary. The dose and duration of 
treatment will depend on the clinical status of the patient, as well as their VWF:RCo and FVIII:C 
plasma levels.
Paediatric VWD population 
Treatment of bleeding
Usually 40 - 80 IU/kg of von Willebrand factor (VWF:RCo) corresponding to 20 - 40 IU FVIII:C/kg 
of body weight (BW) are recommended in paediatric patients to treat a bleed. 
Prophylaxis treatment
Patients aged 12 to 18 years old: Dosing is based on the same guidelines as for adults. 
Patients aged <12 years old: Based on results from a clinical trial in which paediatric patients under 12 
years of age were shown to have lower exposure of VWF, a prophylactic dose range of 40 – 80 IU 
VWF:RCo/kg body weight 1 to 3 times a week should be considered. (see Section 5.2).
The dose and duration of treatment will depend on the clinical status of the patient, as well as their 
VWF:RCo and FVIII:C plasma levels.
Haemophilia A
It is important to calculate the dose using the number of IU of FVIII:C specified. 
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, 
on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition. 
The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which is 
related to the current WHO concentrate standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in 
plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or preferably in 
International Units (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).
1 IU of factorVIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in 1 ml of normal human 
plasma. 
On demand treatment
4
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 
1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by about 
2 % of normal activity (in vivo recovery 2 IU/dl). The required dose is determined using the following 
formula:
Required units = body weight [kg] x desired factor VIII rise [% or IU/dl] x 0.5.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the 
clinical effectiveness in the individual case. 
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the 
given plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) within the corresponding period. The following 
table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:
Degree of haemorrhage / Type 
of surgical procedure
Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level 
required (% or IU/dl)
Frequency of doses (hours) / 
Duration of therapy (days)
Early haemarthrosis, muscle 
bleeding or oral bleeding

(pre- and
postoperative)
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 
at least 1 day, until the bleeding episode 
as indicated by pain is resolved or 
healing is achieved.
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 
3 - 4 days or more until pain and acute 
disability are resolved.
Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours until 
threat is resolved.
Repeat infusion every 24 hours for at 
least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours until 
adequate wound healing, then continue 
therapy for at least another 7 days to 
maintain a factor VIII activity of 30 % -
60 % (IU/dl).
Prophylaxis treatment
For long term prophylaxis in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual dose is 20 to 40 IU of 
factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days. In some cases, especially in younger
patients, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Paediatric haemophilia A population
Dosing in haemophilia A in children and adolescents aged ˂ 18 years old is based on body weight and 
is therefore generally based on the same guidelines as for adults. In some cases shorter dose intervals 
or higher doses may be necessary. The frequency of administration should always be oriented to the 
clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Currently available data are described in Sections 4.8and 5.2.
Elderly
No dose adjustment is necessary for the older people.
Method of administration
For intravenous use.
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. The 
reconstituted preparation should be injected/infused slowly intravenously at a rate comfortable for the 
patient. 
5
The injection/infusion rate should not exceed 6 ml per minute. The patient should be observed for any 
immediate reaction. If any reaction takes place that might be related to the administration of Voncento,
the rate of injection should be decreased or the application should be stopped, as required by the 
clinical condition of the patient (see also section 4.4).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
It is strongly recommended that every time that Voncento is administered to a patient, the name and 
batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch 
of the product.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients 
should be advised to discontinue use of the medicinal product immediately and contact their physician.
Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, 
generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis. In case of shock, 
the current medical standards for shock treatment should be observed. 
Virus safety
Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from 
human blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma 
pools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the 
inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or 
plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. 
This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. 
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and for the non-enveloped hepatitis 
A virus (HAV).
The measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19.
Parvovirus B19 infection may be serious for pregnant women (foetal infection) and for individuals 
with immunodeficiency or increased erythropoiesis (e.g. haemolytic anaemia).
Appropriate vaccination (hepatitis A and B) should be considered for patients in regular/repeated 
receipt of human plasma-derived factor VIII/VWF products.
von Willebrand disease
There is a risk of occurrence of thrombotic events, particularly in patients with known clinical or 
laboratory risk factors. Therefore, patients at risk must be monitored for early signs of thrombosis. 
Prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism should be instituted, according to the current 
recommendations.
When using a FVIII-containing VWF product, the treating physician should be aware that continued 
treatment may cause an excessive rise in FVIII:C. In patients receiving FVIII-containing VWF 
products, plasma levels of FVIII:C should be monitored to avoid sustained excessive FVIII:C plasma 
6
levels which may increase the risk of thrombotic events, and antithrombotic measures should be 
considered (see also section 5.2).
Patients with VWD, especially type 3 patients, may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to 
VWF. If the expected VWF:RCo activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled 
with an appropriate dose, an appropriate assay should be performed to determine if a VWF inhibitor is 
present. In patients with high levels of inhibitor, therapy may not only be ineffective but also lead to 
anaphylactoid reactions and other therapeutic options should be considered. 
Haemophilia A
Inhibitors
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per 
ml of plasma, using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity 
of the disease as well as exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 50 exposure 
days but continues throughout life although the risk is uncommon. 
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
posing less of a risk of insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected 
factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate 
dose, testing for FVIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of 
inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. 
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of 
haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors.
Cardiovascular events
In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FVIII may increase the 
cardiovascular risk.
Catheter-related complications
If a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.

4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Voncento.
von Willebrand disease
Experience in the treatment of pregnant or breast-feeding women is not available. Voncento should be 
administered to pregnant or breast-feeding VWF deficient women only if clearly indicated, taking into 
consideration that delivery confers an increased risk of haemorrhagic events in these patients.
Haemophilia A
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the treatment during 
pregnancy and breastfeeding is not available. 
Therefore, Voncento should be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding only if clearly indicated.
Fertility
There are no data on fertility available.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Voncento has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects

Description of selected adverse reactions
Hypersensitivity (allergic reactions)
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest (including chest pain and chest discomfort), back pain, 
tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed, and may in some cases progress to severe 
anaphylaxis (including shock).
FVIII inhibition
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated 
with factor VIII, including with Voncento. If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest itself 
as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia 
centre be contacted.
VWF inhibition
Patients with VWD, especially type 3 patients, may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to 
VWF. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as an inadequate clinical response. 
Such antibodies are precipitating and may occur concomitantly to anaphylactic reactions. Therefore, 
patients experiencing an anaphylactic reaction should be evaluated for the presence of an inhibitor. In 
all such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted. 
Thromboembolic events
In patients with VWD, there is a risk of occurrence of thromboembolic events, particularly in patients 
with known clinical or laboratory risk factors. In patients receiving FVIII-containing VWF products, 
sustained excessive FVIII:C plasma levels may increase the risk of thromboembolic events (see also 
section 4.4).
For safety with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4. 
Paediatric population 
Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in adults.
9
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Five cases of overdose have been reported from clinical trials. No adverse reactions have been
associated with these reports.
The risk of thromboembolic events cannot be excluded in case of major overdose, especially in 
patients with VWD.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics,blood coagulation factors, von Willebrand factor and 
coagulation factor VIII in combination, ATC code: B02BD06
von Willebrand disease
Exogenously administered human plasma-derived VWF behaves in the same way as endogenous 
VWF.
Administration of VWF allows correction of the haemostatic abnormalities exhibited by patients who 
suffer from VWF deficiency (VWD) at two levels:
-
VWF re-establishes platelet adhesion to the vascular sub-endothelium at the site of vascular 
damage (as it binds both to the vascular sub-endothelium and to the platelet membrane), 
providing primary haemostasis as shown by the shortening of the bleeding time. This effect 
occurs immediately and is known to depend to a large extent on the level of polymerisation of 
the protein.
VWF produces delayed correction of the associated FVIII deficiency. Administered 
intravenously, VWF binds to endogenous FVIII (which is produced normally by the patient), 
and by stabilising this factor, avoids its rapid degradation.
Because of this, administration of pure VWF (VWF product with a low FVIII level) restores the 
FVIII:C level to normal as a secondary effect after the first infusion with a slight delay.
Administration of a FVIII:C containing VWF preparation restores the FVIII:C level to normal 
immediately after the first infusion.
-
-
Haemophilia A
Exogenously administered human plasma-derived FVIII behaves in the same way as endogenous 
FVIII.
The FVIII/VWF complex consists of two molecules (FVIII and VWF) with different physiological 
functions.  When infused into a haemophiliac patient, FVIII binds to VWF in the patient’s circulation.
Activated FVIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX accelerating the conversion of factor X to 
activated factor X. Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts 
fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of 
blood coagulation due to decreased levels of FVIII and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles 
or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement
10
therapy the plasma level of FVIII is increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor 
deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency.
Of note, annualized bleeding rate (ABR) is not comparable between different factor concentrates and 
between different clinical studies.
5.2

von Willebrand disease
The pharmacokinetic data in patients with von Willebrand disease are very similar to those observed 
in the adult population.
PK of single dose of 80 IU VWF:RCo/kg body weight was evaluated in paediatric subjects less than 
12 years of age with severe VWD (see Table below). Following infusion, peak concentrations of VWF 
markers (VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, and VWF:CB) and FVIII:C were achieved immediately with a median 
IR of 0.012-0.016 (IU/mL)/(IU/kg) for VWF markers and 0.018-0.020 (IU/mL)/(IU/kg) for FVIII:C. 
The median elimination t1/2 of VWF markers was between 10.00 and 13.48 h whereas FVIII:C had a 
longer t1/2 between 11.40 and 19.54 h due to a plateau effect that may represent the net effect of 
decreasing levels of exogenous FVIII, combined with increasing endogenous FVIII levels. PK 
parameters from the repeat PK evaluation were similar to those from initial PK. Voncento exposure 
and disposition were comparable between <6-year-old and 6-12-year-old subjects.

Preclinical safety data
Voncento contains FVIII and VWF as active ingredients which are derived from human plasma and 
act like endogenous constituents of plasma. Preclinical studies with repeated dose applications 
(chronic toxicity, carcinogenicity and mutagenicity) cannot be reasonably performed in conventional 
animal models due to the development of antibodies following the application of heterologous human 
proteins.

Special precautions for disposal and other handling
General instructions
The solution should be clear or slightly opalescent. After filtering/withdrawal (see below) the 
reconstituted product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to 
administration. Do not use visibly cloudy solutions or solutions still containing flakes or particles. 
Reconstitution and withdrawal must be carried out under aseptic conditions.
Reconstitution
Bring the solvent to room temperature. Ensure powder and solvent vial flip caps are removed and the 
stoppers are treated with an antiseptic solution and allowed to dry prior to opening the Mix2Vial 
package.

1. Open the Mix2Vial package by peeling off the lid. Do not
remove the Mix2Vial from the blister package!
2. Place the solvent vial on an even, clean surface and hold 
the vial tight. Take the Mix2Vial together with the blister 
package and push the spike of the blue adapter end 
straight down through the solvent vial stopper.
3. Carefully remove the blister package from the Mix2Vial 
set by holding at the rim, and pulling vertically upwards. 
Make sure that you only pull away the blister package and 
not the Mix2Vial set.
4. Place the product vial on an even and firm surface. Invert 
the solvent vial with the Mix2Vial set attached and push 
the spike of the transparent adapter end straight down
through the product vial stopper. The solvent will 
automatically flow into the product vial.
15
5. With one hand grasp the product-side of the Mix2Vial set 
and with the other hand grasp the solvent-side and unscrew 
the set carefully counterclockwise into two pieces to avoid 
excessive build-up of foam when dissolving the product. 
Discard the solvent vial with the blue Mix2Vial adapter 
attached.
6. Gently swirl the product vial with the transparent adapter 
attached until the substance is fully dissolved. Do not 
shake.
7. Draw air into an empty, sterile syringe. While the product 
vial is upright, connect the syringe to the Mix2Vial´s Luer 
Lock fitting by screwing clockwise. Inject air into the 
product vial.

7
Withdrawal and application
8. While keeping the syringe plunger pressed, turn the 
system upside down and draw the solution into the syringe 
by pulling the plunger back slowly.
9. Now that the solution has been transferred into the 
syringe, firmly hold on to the barrel of the syringe 
(keeping the syringe plunger facing down) and disconnect 
the transparent Mix2Vial adapter from the syringe by 
unscrewing counterclockwise.

9
For injection of Voncento only the provided administration sets should be used because treatment 
failure can occur as a consequence of FVIII adsorption to the internal surfaces of some 
injection/infusion equipment.
In case large volumes of Voncento are required, it is possible to pool several vials of Voncento via a 
commercially available infusion set (e.g. a syringe pump for intravenous application of medicinal 
products). However, in these cases the initially reconstituted solution of Voncento should not be 
diluted any further.
Administer the solution slowly intravenously (see section 4.2), taking care to ensure that no blood 
enters the syringe filled with product. 
16
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information
1.
What Voncento is and what it is used for 
The product is made from human plasma (the liquid part of the blood) and contains the active 
substances called human coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and human von Willebrand factor (VWF).
Voncento is used for all age groups to prevent or to halt bleeding caused by the lack of VWF in von 
Willebrand disease (VWD) and the lack of FVIII in haemophilia A. Voncento is only used when 
treatment with another medicine, desmopressin, is not effective alone or cannot be given.
VWF and FVIII are involved in blood clotting. Lack of either factor means that blood does not clot as 
quickly as it should so there is an increased tendency to bleed. The replacement of VWF and FVIII by
Voncento will temporarily repair the blood clotting mechanisms.
As Voncento contains both FVIII and VWF, it is important to know which factor you most need. If 
you have haemophilia A your doctor will prescribe you Voncento with the number of units of 
FVIII specified. If you have VWD your doctor will prescribe you Voncento with the number of 
units of VWF specified.
2.
What you need to know before you use Voncento
Do not use Voncento
42

If you are allergic to VWF or FVIII or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions
Traceability
It is strongly recommended that every time Voncento is given, you record the date of administration, 
the batch number and the injected volume in your treatment diary.
Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before taking Voncento.





Allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions are possible. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, you 
should stop using the medicine immediately and contact your doctor. Your doctor should 
inform you of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions. These include hives, generalised 
skin rash, tightness of the chest, wheezing, fall in blood pressure and anaphylaxis (a serious 
allergic reaction that causes severe difficulty in breathing, or dizziness). 
The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during 
treatment with all factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the 
treatment working properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the 
development of these inhibitors. If your or your child’s bleeding is not being controlled with 
Voncento, tell your doctor immediately. 
If you have been told you have heart disease or are at risk for heart disease, tell your doctor or 
pharmacist.
If for the administration of Voncento you will require a central venous access device (CVAD), 
the risk of CVAD-related complications including local infections, bacteria in the blood 
(bacteremia) and the formation of a blood clot in the blood vessel (thrombosis) where the 
catheter is inserted should be considered by your doctor.
von Willebrand disease
If you have a known risk of developing blood clots, you must be monitored for early signs of 
thrombosis (blood clotting). Your doctor should give you treatment to prevent thrombosis.
Virus safety
When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place by the 
manufacturer to prevent infections being passed on to patients. These include:

careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections
are excluded, 
the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections,
inclusion of steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses.


Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the 
possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or 
emerging viruses or other types of infections.
The measures taken are considered effective for so-called “enveloped” viruses such as human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the AIDS virus), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (which cause 
inflammation of the liver), and for the “non-enveloped” hepatitis A virus (which also causes 
inflammation of the liver). 
The measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19. 
Parvovirus B19 infection may be serious 

for pregnant women (as there is a risk of infection of the unborn child) and 
43

for individuals with a weakened immune system or with an increased production of red blood 
cells due to certain types of anaemia (e.g. sickle cell anaemia or haemolytic anaemia).
Your doctor may recommend that you consider being vaccinated against hepatitis A and B if you 
regularly/repeatedly receive human plasma-derived medicines such as Voncento.
Children and adolescents
The listed warnings and precautions apply to children and adolescents.
Other medicines and Voncento

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 


If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
During pregnancy and breast-feeding, Voncento should be given only if it is clearly needed.
Driving and using machines
Voncento does not affect your ability to drive and use machines.
Voncento contains sodium
The presentations 250 IU FVIII /600 IU VWF (5 ml solvent) and 500 IU FVIII /1200 IU VWF (5 ml 
solvent) contain up to 14.75 mg sodium per vial (main component of cooking/table salt). This is 
equivalent to 0.74 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
The presentations 500 IU FVIII /1200 IU VWF (10 ml solvent) and 1000 IU FVIII /2400 IU VWF (10 
ml solvent) contain up to 29.50 mg  sodium per vial (main component of cooking/table salt). This is 
equivalent to 1.48% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.
3.
How to use Voncento
Your treatment should be monitored by a doctor who is experienced in the treatment of blood clotting
disorders.
If your doctor thinks you could administer Voncento yourself, appropriate instructions will be 
provided to you by your doctor. Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check 
with your doctor if you are not sure.
Dose
the severity of your disease
the site and intensity of the bleeding



(see also section “The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only”).
If you have been prescribed Voncento to use at home, your doctor will make sure that you are shown 
how to inject it and how much to use.
44




Follow the directions given to you by your doctor.
Use in children and adolescents
Dosing in children and adolescents aged < 18 years is based on body weight and is therefore generally 
based on the same instructions as for adults. In some cases, especially in younger patients, higher 
doses may be needed.
If you use more Voncento than you should 
Five cases of overdose have been reported from clinical trials. No side effects have been associated 
with these reports. The risk of developing blood clots (thrombosis) cannot be excluded in case of an 
extremely high dose, especially in patients with VWD.
If you forget to use Voncento

Proceed with your next dose immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your 
doctor. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Voncento
Do not stop using Voncento without consulting your doctor.
Reconstitution and application
General Instructions

The powder must be mixed with the solvent (liquid) and withdrawn from the vial under aseptic 
conditions.
Voncento must not be mixed with other medicines, diluents or solvents except those mentioned 
in section 6.
The solution should be clear or slightly opalescent, i.e. it might be sparkling when held up to the 
light but must not contain any obvious particles. After filtering or withdrawal (see below) the 
solution should be checked by eye, before it is used. Do not use the solution if it is visibly 
cloudy or if it contains flakes or particles.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements and as instructed by your doctor. 
Reconstitution
Without opening the vials, warm the Voncento powder and the liquid to room or body temperature. 
This can be done either by leaving the vials at room temperature for about an hour, or by holding them 
in your hands for a few minutes. 
DO NOT expose the vials to direct heat. The vials must not be heated above body temperature (37 ºC).
Carefully remove the protective caps from the vials, and clean the exposed rubber stoppers with an 
alcohol swab. Allow the vials to dry before opening the Mix2Vial package (which contains the filter 
transfer device), then follow the instructions given below.
1. Open the Mix2Vial package by peeling off the lid. Do not
remove the Mix2Vial from the blister package!
2. Place the solvent vial on an even, clean surface and hold 
the vial tight. Take the Mix2Vial together with the blister 
package and push the spike of the blue adapter end 
straight down through the solvent vial stopper.
45

2
3. Carefully remove the blister package from the Mix2Vial 
set by holding at the rim, and pulling vertically upwards. 
Make sure that you only pull away the blister package and 
not the Mix2Vial set.
4. Place the product vial on an even and firm surface. Invert 
the solvent vial with the Mix2Vial set attached and push 
the spike of the transparent adapter end straight down
through the product vial stopper. The solvent will 
automatically flow into the product vial.
5. With one hand grasp the product-side of the Mix2Vial set 
and with the other hand grasp the solvent-side and unscrew 
the set carefully counterclockwise into two pieces to avoid 
excessive build-up of foam when dissolving the product. 
Discard the solvent vial with the blue Mix2Vial adapter 
attached.
6. Gently swirl the product vial with the transparent adapter 
attached until the substance is fully dissolved. Do not 
shake.
7. Draw air into an empty, sterile syringe. While the product 
vial is upright, connect the syringe to the Mix2Vial´s Luer 
Lock fitting by screwing clockwise. Inject air into the 
product vial.

Withdrawal and Application
8. While keeping the syringe plunger pressed, turn the 
system upside down and draw the solution into the syringe 
by pulling the plunger back slowly.

46
9. Now that the solution has been transferred into the 
syringe, firmly hold on to the barrel of the syringe 
(keeping the syringe plunger facing down) and disconnect 
the transparent Mix2Vial adapter from the syringe by 
unscrewing counterclockwise.
9
Use the venipuncture kit supplied with the product, insert the needle into a vein. Let blood flow back 
to the end of the tube. Attach the syringe to the threaded, locking end of the venipuncture kit. The use 
of plastic disposable syringes is recommended as the ground glass surfaces of all-glass syringes tend to 
stick with solutions of this type. Inject/infuse the reconstituted solution slowly (at a rate not more 
than 6 ml per minute) into the vein following the instructions given to you by your doctor. Take care 
not to get any blood in the syringe containing the product.
In case large volumes of Voncento are required, it is possible to pool several vials of Voncento 
together, via a commercially available infusion set (e.g. a syringe pump for giving medicines into a 
vein). However, in these cases the initially reconstituted solution of Voncento should not be diluted 
any further.
Check yourself for any side effects that might happen straight away. If you have any side effects that 
might be related to the administration of Voncento, the injection or infusion should be stopped (see 
also section 2).
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
Possible side effects
Like all medicines, Voncento can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Please contact your doctor immediately if:

you notice symptoms of allergic reactions
In some cases it may progress to a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) that causes severe 
difficulty in breathing, dizziness or shock. Allergic reactions may include the following 
symptoms: Swollen face, tongue, mouth or throat, difficulty in breathing and swallowing, hives, 
wheezing, burning and stinging where the infusion was given, chills, flushing, skin rash over the 
whole body, headache, fall in blood pressure, restlessness, faster heart beat, tightness of the 
chest (including chest pain and chest discomfort), back pain, tiredness (lethargy), nausea, 
vomiting, tingling.
you notice that the medicine stops working properly (bleeding is not stopped).
For children not previously treated with factor VIII medicines, inhibitor antibodies (see section 
2) may form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 patients); however patients who have received 
previous treatment with factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) the risk is uncommon 
(less than 1 in 100 patients). If this happens your or your child’s medicines may stop working 
properly and you or your child may experience persistent bleeding.
You may develop an inhibitor (neutralising antibody) to VWF, in which case VWF will not 
work properly any more.
you notice any symptoms of an impaired perfusion in your extremities (e.g. cold and pale 
extremities) or vital organs (e.g. severe chest pain)
There is a risk of formation of blood clots (thrombosis), particularly in patients with known risk 
factors (see also section 2).

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Posology 
von Willebrand disease
It is important to calculate the dose using the number of IU of VWF:RCo specified. 
Generally, 1 IU/kg VWF:RCo raises the circulating level of VWF:RCo by 0.02 IU/ml (2 %).
Levels of VWF:RCo of > 0.6 IU/ml (60 %) and of FVIII:C of > 0.4 IU/ml (40 %) should be achieved.
On-demand treatment
Usually 40 - 80 IU/kg of VWF (VWF:RCo) corresponding to 20 - 40 IU FVIII:C/kg of body weight 
(BW) are recommended to achieve haemostasis.
An initial dose of 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo may be required, especially in patients with type 3 VWD where 
maintenance of adequate levels may require greater doses than in other types of VWD.
Prevention of haemorrhage in case of surgery:
For prevention of excessive bleeding during or after surgery the application should start 1 - 2 hours 
before the surgical procedure. 
An appropriate dose should be re-administered every 12 - 24 hours. The dose and duration of the 
treatment depend on the clinical status of the patient, the type and severity of the bleeding, and both 
VWF:RCo and FVIII:C levels.
When using a FVIII-containing VWF product, the treating physician should be aware that continued 
treatment may cause an excessive rise in FVIII:C. After 24 - 48 hours of treatment, in order to avoid 
an excessive rise in FVIII:C, reduced doses and/or prolongation of the dose interval or the use of a 
VWF product containing a low level of FVIII should be considered.
Prophylaxis treatment
For long term prophylaxis in patients with VWD, a dose of 25 - 40 IU VWF:RCo /kg body weight 
should be considered at a frequency of 1 to 3 times per week. In patients with gastrointestinal bleeds 
or menorrhagia, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary. The dose and duration of 
treatment will depend on the clinical status of the patient, as well as their VWF:RCo and FVIII:C 
plasma levels.
Paediatric VWD population 
Treatment of bleeding
Usually 40 - 80 IU/kg of von Willebrand factor (VWF:RCo) corresponding to 20 - 40 IU FVIII:C/kg 
of body weight (BW) are recommended in paediatric patients to treat a bleed. 
Prophylaxis treatment
Patients aged 12 to 18 years old: Dosing is based on the same guidelines as for adults. 
51
Patients aged <12 years old: Based on results from a clinical trial in which paediatric patients under 12 
years of age were shown to have lower exposure of VWF, a prophylactic dose range of 40 – 80 IU 
VWF:RCo/kg body weight 1 to 3 times a week should be considered.
The dose and duration of treatment will depend on the clinical status of the patient, as well as their 
VWF:RCo and FVIII:C plasma levels.
Haemophilia A
It is important to calculate the dose using the number of IU of FVIII:C specified. 
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the FVIII deficiency, on 
the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition. 
The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which is 
related to the current WHO concentrate standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in 
plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or preferably in 
International Units (relative to an International Standard for FVIII in plasma).
1 IU of FVIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in 1 ml of normal human plasma. 
On demand treatment
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor 
VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by about 2 % of normal activity (in vivo 
recovery 2 IU/dl). The required dose is determined using the following formula:
Required units = body weight [kg] x desired factor VIII rise [% or IU/dl] x 0.5.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the 
clinical effectiveness in the individual case. 
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the 
given plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) within the corresponding period. The following 
table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:
Degree of haemorrhage / Type 
of surgical procedure
Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required 
(% or IU/dl)
Frequency of doses (hours) / 
Duration of therapy (days)
Early haemarthrosis, muscle 
bleeding or oral bleeding
20 - 40
More extensive haemarthrosis, 
muscle bleeding or haematoma 
30 - 60
Life-threatening haemorrhages:
60 - 100
Surgery
Minor surgery including tooth 
extraction
30 - 60
Major surgery
80 - 100 
(pre- and
postoperative)
52
Repeat infusion every 12 to 24 
hours for at least 1 day, until the 
bleeding episode as indicated by 
pain is resolved or healing is 
achieved.
Repeat infusion every 12-24 
hours for 3 - 4 days or more 
until pain and acute disability 
are resolved.
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 
hours until threat is resolved.
Repeat infusion every 24 hours 
for at least 1 day, until healing is 
achieved.
Repeat infusion every 8-24 
hours until adequate wound 
healing, then continue therapy 
for at least another 7 days to 
maintain a factor VIII activity of 
30% - 60% (IU/dl).
Treatment monitoring
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide the 
dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their 
response to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight 
may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical 
interventions in particular, a precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation 
analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable..
Prophylaxis treatment
For long term prophylaxis in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual dose is 20 to 40 IU of 
FVIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days. In some cases, especially in younger patients, 
shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Paediatric haemophilia A population
Dosing in in haemophilia A in children and adolescents aged ˂ 18 years is based on body weight and 
is therefore generally based on the same guidelines as for adults. In some cases shorter dose intervals 
or higher doses may be necessary. The frequency of administration should always be oriented to the 
clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Elderly
No dose adjustment is necessary for the older people.

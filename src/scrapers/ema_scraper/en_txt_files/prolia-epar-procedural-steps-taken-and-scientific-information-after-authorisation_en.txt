increased from the pivotal study baseline by 21.7% at the 
lumbar spine, 9.2% at the total hip, 9.0% at the femoral 
neck, 13.0% at the trochanter and 2.8% at the distal 1/3 
radius. The mean lumbar spine BMD T-score at the end of 
the study was -1.3 in patients treated for 10 years. 
Fracture incidence was evaluated as a safety endpoint but 
efficacy in fracture prevention cannot be estimated due to 
high number of discontinuations and open-label design. The 
cumulative incidence of new vertebral and non-vertebral 
fractures were approximately 6.8% and 13.1% 
respectively, in patients who remained on denosumab 
treatment for 10 years (n = 1,278). Patients who did not 
complete the study of any reason had higher on-treatment 
fracture rates. 
Incidence of ONJ was 0.04% at 3 years, 0.06% at 5 years 
and 0.44% at 10 years of Prolia treatment. The risk of ONJ 
increased with duration of exposure to Prolia. 
Overall, long-term antiresorptive treatment (including both 
denosumab and bisphosphonates) may contribute to an 
increased risk for adverse outcomes such as osteonecrosis 
of the jaw and atypical femur fractures due to significant 
suppression of bone remodelling.  
The optimal total duration of antiresorptive treatment

treatment for osteoporosis (including both denosumab and 
bisphosphonates) has not been established. The need for 
continued treatment should be re-evaluated periodically 
based on the benefits and potential risks of denosumab on 
an individual patient basis, particularly after 5 or more 
years of use.

incidence was evaluated as a safety endpoint. In years 4 
through 10, the rates of new vertebral and non-vertebral 
fractures did not increase over time; annualised rates were 
approximately 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively.  Two 
adjudicated cases of atypical fractures of the femur 
occurred during the extension study.    
ONJ has been reported rarely, in 16 patients, in clinical 
trials in osteoporosis and in breast or prostate cancer 
patients receiving hormone ablation including a total of 
23,148 patients. Thirteen of these ONJ cases occurred in 
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis during the phase 
III clinical trial extension following treatment with Prolia for 
up to 10 years (0.3%; < 0.1 events per 100 subject-
years). 
Fifty nine women participated in the bone biopsy sub-study 
at month 24 (n = 41) and/or month 84 (n = 22) of the 
extension study in postmenopausal women with 
osteoporosis. Bone histology was also evaluated in 17 men 
with osteoporosis following 1 year treatment with Prolia. 
Bone biopsy results showed bone of normal architecture 
and quality with no evidence of mineralisation defects, 
woven bone or marrow fibrosis. Histomorphometry findings 
in the extension study in postmenopausal women with 
osteoporosis showed that the antiresorptive effects of 
Prolia, as measured by activation frequency and bone 
formation rates, were maintained over time.

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and 
efficacy, including all variations introduced since the 
marketing authorisation was granted, the CHMP considered 
that the risk-benefit balance of Prolia in the approved 
indications remains favourable and therefore recommends 
the renewal of the marketing authorisation. 
Given that there were several ongoing safety concerns 
associated with denosumab (Prolia) at the time of this 
renewal, it was recommended that one additional five-year 
renewal is asked for on the basis of pharmacovigilance 
grounds.

clinical manifestations of severe symptomatic 
hypocalcaemia and increases in parathyroid hormone 
in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8, and to add 
musculoskeletal pain as an identified risk in section 
4.8 further to post-marketing experience. The 
Package Leaflet and the RMP have been modified 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to make editorial changes in the Package 
Leaflet.

this risk. Further, a DHPC has also been agreed as an 
additional risk minimisation measure in order to inform 
prescribers of this safety concern and the subsequent 
changes to the SmPC. 
Denosumab inhibits osteoclast bone resorption, thereby 
decreasing the release of calcium from bone into the 
bloodstream. In two phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical 
trials in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, there 
were no reported cases of severe symptomatic 
hypocalcaemia

symptomatic hypocalcaemia have been reported. Renal 
insufficiency was described in the majority of these cases, 
with most cases occurring in the first weeks of initiating 
Prolia therapy but it can occur later.  
Examples of the clinical manifestations of severe 
symptomatic hypocalcaemia have included QT interval 
prolongation, tetany, seizures and altered mental status. 
Symptoms of hypocalcaemia observed in denosumab 
clinical studies included paresthesias or muscle stiffness, 
twitching, spasms and muscle cramps. Patients should be 
encouraged to report symptoms indicative of hypocalcemia.

physicians in the recognition and management of this risk. 
Further, a DHPC has also been agreed as an additional risk 
minimisation measure in order to inform prescribers of this 
safety concern and the subsequent changes to the SmPC. 
ONJ has been reported rarely in clinical studies and in the 
post marketing setting in patients receiving Prolia 
(denosumab at dose 60 mg every 6 months for 
osteoporosis).  ONJ has been reported commonly in 
patients with advanced cancer treated with denosumab at a 
dose of 120 mg administered monthly.  
Known risk factors for ONJ include previous treatment with 
bisphosphonates, older age, poor oral hygiene, invasive 
dental procedures (e.g. tooth extractions, dental implants, 
oral surgery), co-morbid disorders (e.g. pre-existing dental 
disease, anaemia, coagulopathy, infection), smoking, a

diagnosis of cancer with bone lesions, and concomitant 
therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, antiangiogenic biologics, 
corticosteroids, radiotherapy to head and neck).  
While on treatment, patients with risk factors should avoid 
invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who 
develop ONJ while on Prolia therapy, doctors should 
develop a management plan for the individual patient in 
close collaboration with a dentist or oral surgeon with 
expertise in ONJ. Temporary interruption of treatment 
should be considered until the condition resolves and 
contributing risk factors are mitigated, where possible.

The CHMP agreed with the MAH’s proposal to amend the PI

histology (MEA 10), from interim analyses of the 
ongoing open-label extension study in the treatment 
of postmenopausal osteoporosis (Study 20060289).

new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
in order to inform prescribers of the long-term exposure 
results from the study.   
The data from the first 5 years of the Prolia open-label 
extension study demonstrated that: 
- BMD increased at lumbar spine, proximal femur, and 
radius, in both the long-term and crossover groups.  
- New vertebral and nonvertebral fracture incidence rates 
were similar in the long term and crossover groups.   
Page 21/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- Through year 5 of the extension study, bone turnover 
markers remain reduced in both the long term and 
crossover groups with a characteristic attenuation at the 
end of the dosing interval. 
- The rates of common adverse events or serious adverse 
events observed through Month 60 have not shown 
significant increases over time. 
- Eight events of ONJ and two atypical femoral fractures 
have been observed. The median time to onset of ONJ was 
approximately 5 years after the start of denosumab 
treatment. One case of atypical femoral fracture was 
reported after 3 years of denosumab treatment and the 
other case was reported after 7 years of denosumab 
treatment. Owing to the small number of subjects, no 
definite conclusion can be drawn on the ONJ rate over time. 
A longer duration of treatment with Prolia may increase the 
risk of these adverse events as it does for Xgeva and other 
antiresorptive treatments.   
- Bone biopsies at month 24 of the extension study showed 
bone of normal architecture and quality with no evidence of 
mineralization defects, woven bone, or marrow fibrosis. 
The benefit/risk balance of Prolia remains positive.

took the opportunity to make minor editorial changes

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
with postmenopausal osteoporosis receiving long-term 
treatment with Prolia (denosumab). Atypical femoral 
fractures are subtrochanteric or proximal diaphyseal 
fractures that occur with little to no trauma.  Specific 
radiographic findings, including a simple transverse or 
oblique fracture with beaking of the cortex and diffuse 
cortical thickening of the proximal femoral shaft, 
characterize these events. They may occur bilaterally.  
An increased risk of atypical femoral fractures has been 
reported with bisphosphonates, another class of 
antiresorptive therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis. As 
a result, the MAH has evaluated the potential for atypical 
Page 26/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
femoral fractures in patients treated with Prolia in clinical 
trials and the post-marketing setting.  Cases of atypical 
femoral fracture have been confirmed in patients receiving 
long-term treatment with Prolia participating in the ongoing 
open-label extension study of the pivotal phase 3 fracture 
trial in postmenopausal osteoporosis (FREEDOM). These 
events have occurred rarely (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) 
based on 8,928 subjects being exposed to Prolia in bone 
loss studies, corresponding to 31,266 subject-years of 
exposure.  
The new information in the SmPC and Package Leaflet 
informs prescribers of the risk of atypical femoral fracture 
with Prolia, provides information on the nature of these 
events, and guides physicians in the recognition and 
management of this risk. Further, a DHPC has also been 
agreed as an additional risk minimisation measure in order 
to inform prescribers of this safety concern and the 
subsequent changes to the SmPC. 
During Prolia (denosumab) treatment, patients should be 
advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain. 
Patients presenting with such symptoms should be 
evaluated for an incomplete femoral fracture. The 
contralateral femur should be examined in denosumab-
treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft 
fracture. Discontinuation of denosumab therapy in patients 
suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be 
considered while they are evaluated.  An individual 
assessment of the benefits and risks should be performed.

of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
already described in the Prolia SmPC. The Prolia SmPC also 
includes a contraindication for hypocalcemia and steps to 
mitigate the risk. A review of post-marketing, spontaneous 
adverse event reports has identified 8 cases of medically 
confirmed hypocalcemia with severe signs or symptoms, for 
which a causal association with denosumab could not be 
ruled out. The majority of these events occurred in patients 
with severe or end-stage kidney disease who were 
predisposed to hypocalcemia. The Prolia SmPC currently 
indicates an increased risk of hypocalcemia in patients with 
kidney disease and recommends monitoring of calcium 
levels in patients predisposed to hypocalcemia; adequate 
intake of calcium and vitamin D is recommended in all 
patients. The SmPC also indicates that, for all patients, 
hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy 
with denosumab. 
To inform prescribers about the post-marketing experience 
with Prolia, the SmPC has been updated to report that 
severe symptomatic hypocalcemia has been observed in 
patients at increased risk of hypocalcemia.

study in postmenopausal women who completed the 
pivotal study 20030216. Further, the MAH has made 
minor editorial changes to the SmPC. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-

available from study 20060289.  
Study 20060289 was an open-label Extension Study in the 
Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis. A total of 4550 
patients (2343 Prolia & 2207 placebo) who missed no more 
than one dose of investigational product in the pivotal 
study (already described in section 5.1 of the SmPC) and 
completed all study visits agreed to enroll in a 7-year, 
multinational, multicenter, open label, single-arm extension 
study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of 
Prolia.  At month 24 of the extension study, after 5 years of 
denosumab treatment, the long-term group increased BMD 
by 13.8% at the lumbar spine, 7.0% at the total hip, 6.2% 
at the femoral neck and 9.7% at the trochanter from the 
original pivotal study baseline.  Fracture incidence was 
evaluated as a safety endpoint: continued Prolia treatment 
maintained a low incidence of new vertebral and non-
vertebral fractures in years 4 and 5 (annualized rate of new 
vertebral fracture was 1.4% in both years 4 and 5, while 
1.4% and 1.1% of patients had a non-vertebral fracture in 
years 4 and 5 respectively).  
Three cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) occurred 
during the first 25 months in the study, two cases in the de 
novo treatment group and one case in the long term 
treatment group, all cases resolved.

authorisation phase, a change of the frequency 
category allocated to the ADR 'hypocalcaemia' from 
‘very rare’ to ‘rare’, the inclusion of ‘osteonecrosis of 
the jaw’ as a rare adverse reaction in the ADR table 
and the inclusion of text under ‘summary of safety 
profile’ in line with the SmPC guideline. The Package 
Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Further, for 
increased clarity the MAH has implemented changes 
to the 'instructions for injecting with the Prolia pre-
filled syringe with an automatic needle guard' section 
of the Package Leaflet. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement editorial changes in the 
annexes, to update the annexes in line with the 
latest QRD template (version 8.0) and to update the 
contact details in the list of local representatives in 
the Package Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
information available for review, were not obviously 
confounded by history or suspect concomitant medication, 
and although clinical features were variable, drug-related 
hypersensitivity could not be excluded. Common clinical 
features among these 6 cases were rash, urticaria, facial 
oedema, and erythema. None of these cases was fatal and 
there were no cases featuring bronchospasm or 
hypotension. The MAH provided data supporting the use of 
‘Rare’ as the appropriate CIOMS frequency category for this 
ADR. 
Based on the data from study 20060289 (24 month 
analysis), an extension study from study 20030216, there 
were in total 3 cases of ONJ, two cases in the de novo 
treatment group and one case in the long term treatment 
group. The MAH provided data supporting the use of ‘Rare’ 
as the appropriate CIOMS frequency category for this ADR.

of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-

foetal harm.  In this study, foetal lymph nodes were not 
examined.  
In another study of cynomolgus monkeys dosed with 
denosumab throughout pregnancy at AUC exposures 119-
fold higher than the human dose (60 mg every 6 months),  
there were increased stillbirths and postnatal mortality; 
abnormal bone growth resulting in reduced bone strength, 
reduced haematopoiesis, and tooth malalignment; absence 
of peripheral lymph nodes; and decreased neonatal growth.  
A no observed adverse effect level for reproductive effects 
was not established. Following a 6 month period after birth, 
bone related changes showed recovery and there was no 
effect on tooth eruption. However, the effects on lymph 
nodes and tooth malalignment persisted, and minimal to 
moderate mineralisation in multiple tissues was seen in one 
animal (relation to treatment uncertain). There was no 
evidence of maternal harm prior to labour; adverse 
maternal effects occurred infrequently during labour.  
Maternal mammary gland development was normal.  
From a clinical viewpoint, women who become pregnant 
during Prolia treatment are encouraged to enrol in the 
MAH’s Pregnancy Surveillance programme. Contact details 
are provided in section 6 of the Package Leaflet – 
Information for the user. 
Similarly, women who are nursing during Prolia treatment 
are encouraged to enrol in the MAH’s Lactation Surveillance 
Program. Contact details are provided in section 6 of the

CHMP comments: 
Two formulations of the Rotarix vaccine are compared in this study. Both formulations contain ≥106.0 
CCID50 of the active substance HRV RIX4414 live attenuated. The HRV liquid formulation is 
administered as a 1.5 ml oral dose while the HRV lyophilized formulation is administered as a 1 ml oral 
dose. For each formulation, two doses of the vaccine are needed.   
Both formulations are approved for use in infants from 6 to 24 weeks to protect against gastroenteritis 
(diarrhoea and vomiting) caused by rotavirus infections. 
Both formulations are authorized in EU. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report(s) for the study 116566 (ROTA-083) entitled “A phase III, 
randomized, open study to assess the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of two different 
formulations of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals’ oral live attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine, 
Rotarix, when given as a two-dose primary vaccination, in healthy infants with no previous history of 
rotavirus illness or vaccination.” 
Rotarix is a live attenuated HRV vaccine (strain G1P[8], RIX4414) for oral administration that is 
manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, s.a. (referred to as GSK). Two pharmaceutical forms of 
Rotarix are available: the lyophilized formulation to be reconstituted with a liquid diluent and the liquid 
formulation ready to use. The active ingredient (rotavirus strain RIX4414) is the same for both 
formulations; only the excipients differ, which is linked to manufacturing and vaccine stability 
constraints. The lyophilized formulation was approved in the European Union (EU) via the centralized 
procedure on 21 February 2006 and the liquid formulation was approved as a line extension on 1 
September 2008. Rotarix liquid formulation is prequalified by the World Health Organization (WHO). 
The current indication in the EU summary of product characteristics (SmPC) is active immunization of 
infants aged 6 to 24 weeks for prevention of gastroenteritis due to rotavirus infection. 
The ROTA-083 study report is being submitted to comply with the requirements of Article 46 of the 
paediatric regulation 1901/2006. 
Study ROTA-083 has not been conducted in accordance with an agreed paediatric investigation plan. 
In this study, the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of GSK's HRV liquid vaccine compared to 
GSK's HRV lyophilized vaccine were evaluated.

2.3.2.2.  Methods 
2.3.2.2.1.  Objective(s) 
Primary objective 
• 
To evaluate non-inferiority of GSK’s HRV liquid vaccine compared to GSK’s HRV 
lyophilized vaccine in terms of geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for anti-RV 
antibodies, 1 month post-Dose 2 of HRV liquid vaccine and HRV lyophilized 
vaccine. 
-  Non-inferiority was stated if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for the ratio of anti-RV IgA antibody GMCs between HRV liquid 
vaccine over the HRV lyophilized vaccine, 1 month after Dose 2 was greater 
than or equal to 0.5. 
Secondary objectives 
Immunogenicity 
• 
To assess the immunogenicity of the HRV liquid vaccine and HRV lyophilized 
vaccine, in terms of seroconversion* rates, 1 month post-Dose 2 of HRV vaccine. 
*Definition: 
- 
- 
for subjects with a pre-vaccination anti-RV IgA antibody concentration <20 U/mL, 
seroconversion was achieved when the post-vaccination concentration was ≥20 U/mL. 
for subjects with a pre-vaccination anti-RV IgA antibody concentration ≥20 U/mL, 
seroconversion was achieved when the post-vaccination concentration was ≥2 times the 
pre-vaccination concentration. 
Reactogenicity and safety 
• 
• 
To assess the reactogenicity of the HRV liquid vaccine and the HRV lyophilized vaccine in terms 
of solicited adverse events (AEs), during the 8-day (Day 1–Day 8) follow-up period after each 
vaccination. 
To assess the safety of the HRV liquid vaccine and the HRV lyophilized vaccine in terms of 
unsolicited AEs, during the 31-day (Day 1–Day 31) follow-up period after each vaccination and 
serious adverse events (SAEs), during the entire study period. 
CHMP comments: 
This trial has a primary and secondary immunogenicity objective, while the reactogenicity and safety 
objective is secondary. There is no efficacy objective in this trial.  
The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate non-inferiority of the HRV liq compared to the HRV lyo 
formulation in terms of geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for anti-RV antibodies, 1 month post-
Dose 2. Non-inferiority is defined as: if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for 
the ratio of anti-RV IgA antibody GMCs between HRV liquid vaccine over the HRV lyophilized vaccine, 1 
month after Dose 2 is greater than or equal to 0.5.  
The secondary immunogenicity objective is to assess seroconversion rates of the HRV liq and HRV lyo 
vaccine 1 month post-Dose 2. In the absence of an immunological correlate of protection, two 
definitions of seroconversion were used:

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/267200/2021  
Page 5/22 
 
 
 
 
 
- for subjects with a pre-vaccination anti-RV IgA antibody concentration <20 U/mL, seroconversion 
was achieved when the post-vaccination concentration was ≥20 U/mL. 
- for subjects with a pre-vaccination anti-RV IgA antibody concentration ≥20 U/mL, seroconversion was 
achieved when the post-vaccination concentration was ≥2 times the pre-vaccination concentration. 
A study by Cheuvart et al., in 2014 showed that a post-vaccination antibody concentration ≥ 20 U/mL 
may serve as a useful correlate of vaccine efficacy in clinical trials with Rotarix. An independent 
analysis [Baker, 2020] confirmed the GSK analysis by Cheuvart et al, 2014. The definition of 
seroconversion for subjects with a pre-vaccination anti-RV IgA antibody concentration ≥20 U/mL was 
already used in another study with Rotarix in India. 
The secondary reactogenicity objective is to assess solicited AEs during the 8-day (Day 1 – Day 8) 
follow-up period after dose 1 and dose 2 of the HRV liq and HRV lyo vaccines.  
The secondary safety objective is to assess unsolicited AEs during the 31-day (Day 1 – Day 31) follow-
up period after dose 1 and dose 2 of the HRV liq and HRV lyo vaccines vaccination and SAEs, during 
the entire study period.  
Overall, the objectives are considered appropriate. As there is currently no immune correlate of 
protection, the relation to protection against disease is still poorly understood. 
2.3.2.2.2.  Study design 
This was a phase III, open-label, active-controlled, randomized (1:1), multi-center, single-country 
study with 2 parallel groups: 
•  HRV Liquid vaccine group (also referred to as HRV Liq) 
•  HRV Lyophilized vaccine group (also referred to as HRV Lyo) 
Two oral doses of the HRV vaccine were given according to a 0, 1 month schedule. 
All subjects were allowed to receive routine childhood vaccinations according to the local immunization 
practice. Administration of all routine childhood vaccinations given since birth was to be recorded in the 
electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). 
Blood samples (approximately 2 mL) were collected from all subjects at Visit 1 and Visit 3 to measure 
serum anti-RV Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody concentrations using enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA). 
CHMP comments: 
This is a phase III, open-label, active-controlled, randomized (1:1), multi-center, single-country study 
in India with 2 parallel groups: HRV liq and HRV lyo. Each subject received 2 doses of the vaccine with 
an interval of 1 month.  
The first dose was administered at an age between 6 and 10 weeks. Although Rotarix is indicated for 
immunization of infants from 6 to 24 weeks, a lower age limit is preferred as it is known that the first 
infection with a rotavirus is more severe than the subsequent infections which can be either mild or 
asymptomatic. Therefore, it is most important to prevent the first rotavirus infection in infants.  
All subjects were allowed to receive routine childhood vaccinations according to the local immunization 
practice.

Blood samples for immunogenicity analysis were collected pre-dose 1 and 1 month post-dose 2. 
2.3.2.2.3.  Study population /Sample size 
Number of subjects 
The target enrolment was 450 subjects (225 subjects in each study group) to obtain at least 292 
evaluable subjects (146 subjects in each study group) for the evaluation of the primary and secondary 
objectives. 
A total of 451 subjects were enrolled in the study. Of these subjects, 449 subjects (224 subjects in 
HRV Liq group, 225 subjects in HRV Lyo group) were included in the Exposed Set (ES). 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria 
The study was conducted in healthy male or female infants, who were between, and including 6 and 10 
weeks of age at the time of first vaccination and with a birth weight >2000 grams. Written informed

to performing any study specific procedure. Exclusion criteria essentially consisted of very prematurely 
born infants (born ≤28 weeks of gestation), administration of vaccines not foreseen by the study 
protocol, history of confirmed RV gastroenteritis (GE), previous vaccination against RV, administration 
of immunoglobulins, long-acting immune-modifying drugs, immunosuppressant medications or any 
chronic drug therapy, a potential reaction or hypersensitivity to the HRV vaccine components and 
significant history of chronic gastrointestinal disease or uncorrected gastrointestinal malformation or 
intussusception (IS) or any neurological disorders or seizures. 
CHMP comments:

2.3.2.2.6.  Statistical Methods 
The analyses were conducted as per protocol amendment 3 (primary objective and secondary 
immunogenicity objective) dated 31 October 2017, protocol amendment 4 dated 30 October 2019 and 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) amendment 2 dated 23 June 2020. 
Analysis sets 
• 
• 
ES 
Per-protocol set (PPS) 
Analysis of Immunogenicity 
The primary analysis was based on the PPS for analysis of immunogenicity. As the percentage of 
vaccinated subjects with serological results excluded from the PPS for analysis of immunogenicity was 
more than 5%, a second within-group analysis based on the ES was performed to complement the PPS 
analysis. 
Within group assessment 
The following calculations were performed for each group 
• 
For each group, at each time point that anti-RV IgA was measured, 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/267200/2021

-  GMCs and their 95% CIs were computed. 
-  Seropositivity/seroconversion rates and their exact 95% CI were computed. 
- 
The distribution of anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations at Visit 1 and Visit 3 was displayed 
using Reverse Cumulative Curves (RCCs). 
Between groups assessment 
• 
The 95% CI for the ratio of anti-RV IgA antibody GMCs at Visit 3 between the HRV liquid 
vaccine over the HRV lyophilized vaccine was computed using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model on the logarithm-transformed concentrations. This model included the 
vaccine group and the logarithm of the baseline concentration as covariables. The GMC ratios 
and their 95% CI were derived by exponential transformation of the corresponding group 
contrast in the model (primary objective). 
• 
The asymptotic standardized 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rate at Visit 3 
between the HRV liquid vaccine and HRV lyophilized vaccine was computed (secondary 
objective). 
Complementary to the within group assessment of immunogenicity; fold increase from pre-vaccination 
to 1 month post-Dose 2 of anti-RV antibody concentrations was computed for each group. 
The protocol amendment 3 required an additional condition to be part of the PPS. This condition was to 
have pre-vaccination anti-RV IgA antibody concentration <20 U/mL. As per request from the Indian 
Regulatory Authorities (Scientific Expert Committee [SEC], earlier called New Drug Advisory 
Committee on Vaccines [NDAC] of Drug Controller General of India [DCGI]), the PPS analyses 
addressing the primary and secondary immunogenicity objectives planned in the protocol amendment 
3 were also generated, namely for the PPS limited to subjects with available pre-vaccination anti-RV 
IgA antibody concentrations <20 U/mL. 
• 
• 
The 95% CI for the ratio of anti-RV IgA antibody GMCs at Visit 3 between the HRV liquid 
vaccine over the HRV lyophilized vaccine was computed using an ANOVA model on the 
logarithm-transformed concentrations. This model included the vaccine group as a covariable. 
The GMC ratio and its 95% CI were derived by exponential transformation of the corresponding 
group contrast in the model (primary objective from protocol amendment 3). 
The asymptotic standardized 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rate at Visit 3 
between the HRV liquid vaccine and HRV lyophilized vaccine was computed (secondary 
immunogenicity objective from protocol amendment 3). 
Analysis of safety 
The ES was used for the analysis of safety. 
Descriptive summaries were generated via the percentage by group and associated exact 95% CI. 
Further details of the statistical analyses are provided in the SAP.

CHMP comments 
In total 451 subjects were enrolled in the study, of which 449 subjects (224 subjects in the HRV Liq 
group and 225 subjects in the HRV Lyo group) were included in the exposed set (ES). The ES included 
all subjects with at least 1 study vaccine administration documented and is used for the safety 
analyses. The per protocol set (PPS) is used for the immunogenicity analysis. In this study, subjects 
were eliminated from the PPS because Rotarix was not administered as requested per protocol, blood 
samples were not taken according to the time periods defined in the protocol or the subjects did not 
have immunogenicity results for the pre and/or the post-vaccination timepoint. The PPS consists of 
381 subjects in total, of which 189 subjects in the HRV Liq group and 192 subjects in the HRV Lyo 
group. 
A secondary immunogenicity analysis was done based on the ES to complement the PPS analysis, since 
more than 5% of the vaccinated subjects with serological results were excluded from the PPS.  
Within group assessment was done by calculating GMCs and 95% CI  for each timepoint that anti-RV 
IgA was measured. Seropositivity/seroconversion rates with their exact 95% CI were computed. 
For analysis of the primary immunogenicity objective to compare the two vaccine formulations, 95% CI 
for the ratio of anti-RV IgA antibody GMCs  after the second dose were calculated for the HRV liq over 
the HRV lyo group using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model on the logarithm-transformed 
concentrations. The asymptotic standardized 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rate at Visit 3 
between the HRV liquid vaccine and HRV lyophilized vaccine was computed (secondary objective). 
The protocol amendment 3 required an additional condition to be part of the PPS. This condition was to 
have pre-vaccination anti-RV IgA antibody concentration <20 U/mL. As per request from the Indian 
Regulatory Authorities (SEC of DCGI), the PPS analyses addressing the primary and secondary 
immunogenicity objectives planned in the protocol amendment 3 were also generated, namely for the 
PPS limited to subjects with available pre-vaccination anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations <20 U/mL.  
The PPS as defined in protocol amendment 3 consists of 215 subjects in total, of which 108 subjects in 
the HRV Liq group and 107 subjects in the HRV Lyo group. However, this analysis is no pre-defined 
endpoint of the study.  
For analysis of the primary objective as described in protocol amendment 3, The 95% CI for the ratio 
of anti-RV IgA antibody GMCs at Visit 3 between the HRV liquid vaccine over the HRV lyophilized 
vaccine was computed using an ANOVA model on the logarithm-transformed concentrations instead of 
the ANCOVA model.

CHMP comments: 
Of the 449 subjects in the ES, 224 subjects were in HRV Liq group and 225 subjects in HRV Lyo group. 
In each group 93.3% of the subjects, or 209 subjects and 210 subjects in the HRV liq and HRV Lyo 
group, respectively, completed the study.  
Overall, the number of females and males is well balanced (220 vs 229, respectively). However, there 
is a small imbalance in each group with more males in the HRV Liq group (44.6% vs 55.4% females 
and males, respectively) and more females in the HRV Lyo group (53.3% vs 46.7% females and 
males, respectively). This is not considered an issue as comparable immune responses were observed 
in the HRV liq and HRV lyo groups in females and males in previous studies (Public assessment report 
Rotarix).

The age was well balanced across the HRV Liq and HRV Lyo group, with a mean age of 6.8 weeks and 
a median age of 6.0 weeks (min: 6 weeks; max: 10 weeks) at the time of first vaccination. At this age, 
it is expected that most subjects have not been infected yet with rotavirus. Rotarix is approved in EU 
for use in infants from 6 to 24 weeks old. 
All participating subjects are Asian as the study was done in India. 
There are 381 subjects in total in the PPS, of which 189 subjects were in HRV Liq group and 192 
subjects in HRV Lyo group. This is well above the target to obtain at least 292 evaluable subjects (146 
subjects in each study group) for the evaluation of the primary and secondary objectives.  
Overall, the baseline characteristics form the PPS is similar to the ES set. There is a small imbalance in 
gender between the HRV Lig and HRV Lyo group (43.9% females and 56.1% males vs 52.6% females 
and 47.4% males in each group, respectively). Mean and median age at dose 1 are 6.8 weeks and 6.0 
weeks, respectively, in both groups.  
In the ES, 52 subjects had a gestational age of <37 weeks, with an even distribution in the HRV Liq 
group (25 subjects) and the HRV Lyo group (27 subjects). The majority of these subjects (78.8%) had 
a gestational age of 36 weeks. 
Co-administration of routine vaccines was allowed in this study. A total of 85.1% of subjects at Dose 1 
and 82.4% of subjects at Dose 2 were co-administered with routine vaccines (most frequently with 
hepatitis B vaccine, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine and 
inactivated/oral poliovirus vaccine). Clinical studies have demonstrated that the immune responses and 
the safety profiles of the administered vaccines were unaffected. Although concomitant administration 
of OPV may slightly reduce the immune response to rotavirus vaccine, clinical protection against 
severe rotavirus gastro-enteritis was shown to be maintained in a clinical trial involving more than 
4,200 subjects who received Rotarix concomitantly with OPV (SmPC Rotarix).  
2.3.2.3.3.  Efficacy/Immunogenicity results 
Primary objective 
The primary objective was met. 
In terms of anti-RV IgA antibody GMCs, GSK’s HRV liquid vaccine was shown to be non-inferior to 
GSK’s HRV lyophilized vaccine as the lower limit (LL) of the 2-sided 95% CI for the ratio of anti-RV IgA 
antibody GMCs, between HRV liquid vaccine over the HRV lyophilized vaccine was greater than 0.5 (LL: 
0.65).

CHMP comments: 
Efficacy was not assessed in this study. 
Immunogenicity assessment was based on measuring serological anti-rotavirus IgA antibody levels by 
ELISA. All serological assays were performed by GSK using standardized and validated procedures.  
Blood samples for antibody measurement were collected on Day 1 (pre-dose 1) and on Month 2 (21-48 
days after dose 2). 
At 1 month post-dose 2, 71.4% and 73.4% of the subjects were  seropositive (≥20 U/mL) in both 
groups and the GMCs increased from 25.06 (95% CI: 19.41-32.35) to 90.25 (95% CI: 67.28-121.06) 
and from 23.74 (95% CI: 18.96-29.73)  to 94.16 (95% CI: 70.29-126.13) in both groups, 
respectively.  
One month post-dose 2, anti-RV seroconversion was 54.5% in the HRV liq group and 50.0% in the 
HRV lyo group. Seroconversion was defined as anti-RV IgA ≥20 U/mL post-Dose 2 for initially 
seronegative subjects and as anti-RV IgA post-Dose 2 ≥2 fold the pre-Dose 1 for initially seropositive 
subjects.  
A significant number of subjects already had pre-dose 1 anti-RV IgA concentrations ≥20 U/mL (42.9% 
and 44.3% in the HRV Liq and HRV Lyo group, respectively) in the PPS. These subjects were excluded 
from the analysis as planned in protocol amendment 3 (81 subjects form the HRV liq group and 85 
subjects form the HRV lyo group). One month post-dose 2, 58.3% and 55.1% of the subjects with 
baseline anti-RV IgA <20 U/mL seroconverted in the HRV Liq and HRV Lyo groups, respectively.   
Seroconversion rates were approximately 10% higher in the baseline seronegative subjects compared 
to baseline seropositive subjects. 
Primary objective 
The primary objective of this study was showing non-inferiority between the HRV Liq and HRV Lyo 
formulation of the Rotarix vaccine, by means of anti-RV IgA antibody levels one month after dose 2. In 
the absence of an immune correlate of protection, non-inferiority was defined as the lower limit (LL) of 
the 2-sided 95% CI for the ratio of anti-RV IgA antibody GMCs, between HRV liq over HRV lyo vaccine 
being greater than 0.5.  
Analysis in the PPS showed that the anti-RV IgA GMC in the HRV Liq and HRV Lyo groups was 88.8 and 
95.6, respectively. The GMC ratio of HRV Liq/HRV Lyo is 0.93 with a 95% CI of 0.65-1.34. As the LL is

greater than 0.5, non-inferiority of HRV Liq compared to HRV Lyo  is shown and the primary objective 
of the trial is met. 
Secondary objective 
The secondary immunogenicity objective of this study is to assess seroconversion rates in the HRV liq 
and HRV lyo group, one month post-dose 2 in the PPS. The difference in seroconversion rates one 
month post-dose 2 between the HRV liq and HRV lyo group is 4.50% (95% CI : -5.53 – 14.44), which 
is supportive of the primary objective analysis result that the immune responses in both groups are 
comparable.  
Analyses per protocol amendment 3 
The primary and secondary objectives as described in protocol amendment 3 included only baseline 
seronegative subjects (with anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations <20 U/mL) in the PPS. Although this 
is not a pre-defined endpoint of the current study, the analyses are used as supportive data. 
The ratio of anti-RV IgA GMCs between the HRV liq over the HRV lyo vaccine group in baseline 
seronegative subjects in the PPS is 0.88 (95% IC: 0.52-1.49). The difference in seroconversion rates 
one month post-dose 2 between the HRV liq and HRV lyo group in baseline seronegative subjects in 
the PPS is 3.19 % (95% CI: -10.02-16.30). These data further support the primary objective result 
that the immune responses in both groups are comparable.  
To conclude, this data shows non-inferiority of the immune response elicited by the HRV liq compared 
to HRV lyo formulation of the Rotarix vaccine, measured by means of anti-RV IgA concentrations 1 
month after the second dose.   
2.3.2.3.4.  Safety results 
The safety profile of the HRV liquid vaccine was comparable to the HRV lyophilized vaccine. 
Overall incidence of AEs (solicited and unsolicited) during the 8-day period (Day 1- Day 8) 
following HRV vaccination: 
At least 1 solicited or unsolicited AE was reported in 62.5% and 66.2% of the subjects in the HRV Liq 
and HRV Lyo groups, respectively. In both the vaccine groups, the incidence of the solicited or 
unsolicited AEs (grade 3, causally related and AEs leading to medically attended visits) was 
comparable. 
Solicited general AEs during the 8-day period (Day 1-Day 8) following HRV vaccination: 
In both the vaccine groups, the solicited general AEs were reported in similar percentages of subjects. 
Irritability/fussiness was the most frequently reported solicited general AE (38.4% and 45.3% of 
subjects in the HRV Liq and HRV Lyo groups, respectively). Cough/runny nose was the most frequently 
reported solicited general AE leading to medically attended visits (2.7% and 1.3% of the subjects in 
HRV Liq and HRV Lyo groups, respectively).

CHMP comments: 
The analysis of safety was performed on the exposed set (ES), comprising 449 subjects of which 224 
received at least 1 dose of the HRV liquid vaccine and 225 received at least 1 dose of the HRV 
lyophilized vaccine.  
The number of subjects who reported at least one solicited or unsolicited AEs during the 8-day period 
following vaccination was similar for the HRV Liq group (62.5%) compared to the HRV Lyo group 
(66.2%). 
Solicited AEs collected during the 8-day period are Cough/Runny nose; Diarrhea; Fever; 
Irritability/Fussiness; Loss of appetite and Vomiting. Overall similar percentages of subjects reported 
solicited AEs in both groups. The most frequently reported solicited AEs are ‘irritability/Fussiness’ 
(38.4% and 45.3%, respectively in the HRV liq and HRV Lyo group) and Fever (35.7% vs 36.9%, 
respectively in the HRV liq and HRV Lyo group). The majority of subjects reported mild fever, with a 
temperature >38.5°C reported by 8.5% and 8.4% of the subjects in the HRV liq and HRV Lyo group 
respectively and a temperature >39°C reported by only 1.3% and 0.9%, in both groups respectively. 
In addition, Loss of appetite was reported in 19.6% and 23.6% of the subjects; Cough/Runny nose 
was reported in 14.3% and 17.3% of the subjects; Vomiting was reported in 14.7% and 13.3% of the 
subjects and Diarrhea was reported in 2.7 and 2.2% of the subjects, in the HRV Liq and lyo group, 
respectively. 
In the current SmPC, only diarrhea and irritability are considered common AEs possibly related to 
vaccination. The severity of the solicited AEs, including diarrhea and irritability, was not found to be 
significantly different in the group receiving Rotarix compared to placebo, in 3 placebo-controlled trials 
Relatedness to the study vaccine was most often considered by a clinical investigator for diarrhea 
(approximately 83% and 60% of the cases in the HRV liq and HRV lyo group). Around 30-50% of the 
cases of Fever, Irritability/Fussiness and vomiting were considered to be related. Fewer than 20% of 
cases of cough/runny nose and loss of appetite were considered related to vaccination. Overall 
relatedness was well balanced between the HRV liq and HRV lyo group and after the first and second 
dose. 
Cough/runny nose was the most frequently reported solicited general AE leading to medically attended 
visits (2.7% and 1.3% of the subjects in HRV Liq and HRV Lyo groups, respectively)  
For grade 3 related AEs, irritability/fussiness was the most commonly reported in HRV Liq group (1.8% 
of subjects) (defined as: Crying that cannot be comforted/prevents normal activity) and vomiting was 
the most commonly reported in HRV Lyo group (2.2% of subjects) (defined as: ≥3 episodes of 
vomiting/day). 
Overall the number of AEs reported after the first or second dose is similar in both groups. 
Unsolicited AEs during the 31-day period (Day 1-Day 31) following HRV vaccination: 
•  At least 1 unsolicited AE was reported in 24.1% and 25.8% of subjects in the HRV Liq group 
and HRV Lyo group, respectively. 
•  At least 1 grade 3 unsolicited AE was reported in 2.7% of the subjects in the HRV Liq group 
and 1.3% of the subjects in the HRV Lyo group. The most commonly reported grade 3 
unsolicited AE was bronchiolitis in HRV Liq group (1.3% of subjects) and vomiting in HRV Lyo 
group (0.9% of subjects).

• 
There was no unsolicited AE considered causally related to vaccination by the investigator 
reported in this study. 
•  At least 1 unsolicited AE leading to medical attention following vaccination was reported in 
10.7% and 12.9% of subjects in HRV Liq group and in HRV Lyo group, respectively. Upper 
respiratory tract infection was the most commonly reported AE in HRV Liq group (3.1% of 
subjects) and cough was the most commonly reported AE in HRV Lyo group (4.9% of 
subjects). 
CHMP comments: 
During the 31-day period, unsolicited AEs were reported by 24.1% and 25.8% of subjects in the HRV 
Liq group and HRV Lyo group in the ES, respectively. At least one Grade 3 unsolicited AE was reported 
by 2.7% (6 subjects) and 1.3% (3 subjects) of the subjects in both groups respectively. The most 
commonly reported grade 3 unsolicited AE was bronchiolitis in HRV Liq group (3 subjects) and vomiting 
in HRV Lyo group (2 subjects). 
None of the unsolicited AEs was considered related to the vaccine by the clinical investigator.  
Deaths and SAEs during the entire study period: 
Deaths: 
No deaths were reported in this study. 
SAEs: 
•  A total of 9 SAEs were reported in 7 subjects in the HRV Liq group (3.1% of subjects) and 3 
SAEs were reported in 2 subjects in the HRV Lyo group (0.9% of subjects). 
•  None of the SAEs were assessed by the investigator as related to study vaccination. 
Withdrawals due to AE/SAE: 
A total of 93.3% of the vaccinated subjects of the ES completed the study. There were no 
withdrawals due to AE/SAE.

Table 10. Percentage of subjects with grade 3 unsolicited adverse events classified 
by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term during the 31-day 
period (Days 1-31) following HRV vaccination (Exposed Set) 
CHMP comments: 
At least one SAEs was reported by 7 subjects (9 events) in the HRV Liq group and by 2 subjects (3 
events) in the HRV Lyo group in the ES. All 9 subjects were hospitalized. 
None of the SAEs was considered related to the study vaccine by the clinical investigator. 
The most commonly reported SAEs were bronchiolitis (3 subjects) and Gastroenteritis (2 subjects), 
both in the HRV Liq group. 
Two SAES in the Primary System Organ Class ‘gastrointestinal disorders’ were reported: 1 case of 
diarrhea hemorrhagic in the HRV Lyo group and 1 case of Intestinal obstruction in the HRV Liq group. 
Intussusception, a known very rare serious adverse reaction associated with rotavirus vaccines was not 
reported in this trial.  
In six subjects, the SAEs started after dose 2 while in 3 subjects, SAEs had an onset after dose 1. Of 
the 3 subjects who reported these 3 SAEs, 1 subject also received dose 2 and the 2 other subjects 
withdrew from the study before administration of the second dose.  
Most SAEs were severe (n=10) in intensity. One SAE was moderate (Gastroenteritis) and one SAE was 
mild (intestinal obstruction).  
No deaths were reported in this trial. 
To conclude, in this trial the reactogenicity and safety profile of the HRV liq and HRV lyo formulation of 
Rotarix are comparable. This is in line with 4 previous clinical trials in which approximately 1900 
infants received approximately 3800 doses of HRV liquid formulation (SmPC Rotarix).  No additional 
safety concerns have been identified in this trial compared to the information already available in the 
SmPC.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This phase III, randomized, open study demonstrated non-inferiority of GSK’s HRV liquid vaccine 
compared to GSK’s HRV lyophilized vaccine, in terms of anti-RV IgA antibody GMCs, when 
administered in healthy infants 6-10 weeks of age at the time of first vaccination. The results of 
immunogenicity analyses in terms of seroconversion rates and analyses in subjects seronegative 
before vaccination (as per protocol amendment 3 as requested by the Indian Regulatory Authorities 
[SEC of DCGI]) were supportive of the primary objective analysis result that the immune response to 
HRV liquid vaccine is comparable to HRV lyophilized vaccine. In addition, the administration of GSK’s 
HRV liquid formulation did not raise any safety concerns. The reactogenicity and safety profile of both 
formulations of the vaccine was comparable. 
GSK has reviewed the immunogenicity and safety results of study ROTA-083 and has concluded that 
they are in line with the approved product information for Rotarix in the EU. Therefore, no additional 
changes to the SmPC for Rotarix are considered necessary.  
The current version of the EU SmPC states: 
•  Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties: "In three comparative controlled trials, the immune 
response elicited by Rotarix liquid formulation was comparable to the one elicited by Rotarix 
lyophilised formulation". 
•  Section 4.8 Undesirable effects: "In a total of four clinical trials, approximately 3,800 doses of 
Rotarix liquid formulation were administered to approximately 1,900 infants. Those trials have 
shown that the safety profile of the liquid formulation is comparable to the lyophilised 
formulation". 
The Company considers the fact that these statements are now confirmed by an additional 
study, 438 additional doses of Rotarix liquid and 224 additional infants vaccinated to be of 
limited added value for the Health Care Providers. 
CHMP comments: 
The immunogenicity results of this trial demonstrate non-inferiority of the HRV liquid compared to the 
HRV lyophilized formulation of Rotarix in healthy infants 6-10 weeks of age at the time of first 
vaccination. In addition, the reactogenicity and safety profile of both formulations is comparable and 
no additional safety concerns have been identified.  
The current version of the EU SmPC states: 
• 
Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties: "In three comparative controlled trials, the immune 
response elicited by Rotarix liquid formulation was comparable to the one elicited by Rotarix lyophilised 
formulation". 
• 
Section 4.8 Undesirable effects: "In a total of four clinical trials, approximately 3,800 doses of 
Rotarix liquid formulation were administered to approximately 1,900 infants. Those trials have shown 
that the safety profile of the liquid formulation is comparable to the lyophilised formulation". 
These results are now confirmed in an additional 224 infants vaccinated with 438 additional doses of 
Rotarix liquid. The applicant considers an update of the SmPC not needed as the additional information 
is of limited added value for healthcare providers. We agree with the proposal of the applicant.

3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The immunogenicity results of this trial demonstrate non-inferiority of the HRV liquid compared to HRV 
lyophilized formulation of Rotarix in healthy infants 6-10 weeks of age at the time of first vaccination. 
In addition, the reactogenicity and safety profile of both formulations is comparable and no additional 
safety concerns have been identified.  
No update of the SmPC is required.

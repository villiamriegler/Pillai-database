Summary of the risk management plan for Isturisa (osilodrostat)
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  Isturisa.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of Isturisa, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about Isturisa's risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Isturisa’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Isturisa should be used.
This summary of the RMP for Isturisa should be read in the context of all this information 
including  the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-language  summary,  all 
which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
Isturisa’s RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Isturisa is authorized for the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome (CS).
Isturisa contains osilodrostat as the active substance and it is given orally.
Further information about the evaluation of Isturisa’s benefits can be found in the Isturisa 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available  on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/isturisa.
II.  Risks  associated  with  the  medicine  and  activities  to 
minimize or further characterize the risks
Important risks  of  Isturisa,  together  with  measures  to  minimize  such  risks  and  the 
proposed studies for learning more about Isturisa’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;



Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. 
with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of Isturisa is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A: List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Isturisa are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate  or  minimize  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  taken. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Isturisa. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, 
but  this  association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Events  of  decreased  cortisol  and  decreased  response  to  ACTH 
stimulation  testing  were  noted  in  patients  with  hypertension  and 
healthy  volunteer  studies.  Events  of  hypocortisolism,  including 
serious and symptomatic, have been reported in clinical trials with 
osilodrostat.

A  thorough  QT  study  (Study CLCI699C2105)  demonstrated  a 
positive  exposure-related  QTcF  prolongation  (a  measure  of  the 
electrical activity of the heart) for osilodrostat. QTcF increased by 
25.38 ms (90% CI: 23.53, 27.22) on osilodrostat 150 mg, but not 
on  osilodrostat  10 mg  (1.73 ms  at  3 hours  post-dose).  The 
estimated mean maximum QTcF increase for the maximum clinical 
dose of 30 mg was +5.3 ms.
In both in vivo and in vitro nonclinical studies, osilodrostat showed 
concentration/dose-dependent  QT  prolongation  and  a  potential  to 
cause cardiac rhythm abnormalities, including torsades de pointes.
Despite  intense  ECG  monitoring,  no  cases  of  unconfounded 
treatment-related  arrhythmia  or  events  of  QTcF  > 500 ms  were 
documented in the pivotal clinical study (Study CLCI699C2301).

Embryo-fetal toxicities were observed in the rat and rabbit embryo-
fetal development studies. Increased embryonic and fetal deaths, 
decreased fetal weights, external malformations, and visceral and 
skeletal variations occurred in rats and increased  resorptions and 
decreased  fetal  viability  were  observed  in  rabbits.  In  the  pre-and 
post-natal  developmental  study,  dystocia  and  delayed  parturition 
were  observed  in  rats.  The  NOAEL  for the  embryo-fetal  toxicities 
for  rats  and  rabbits  were  considered  to  be  5  and  3 mg/kg/day, 
respectively,  with  systemic  exposure  level  (based  on  AUC)  9  and 
0.6  times  higher  than  that  expected  in  humans  at  the  highest 
recommended dose of 30 mg twice daily. Thus, osilodrostat should 
be considered potentially teratogenic to humans.

There  is  no  risk  from  transfer  of  the  drug  via  semen:  The 
osilodrostat  safety  margin for  causing  embryo-fetal  toxicity  and 
teratogenicity through seminal fluid transfer is > 100-fold.

Rationale and study objectives
Roll-over study 
(Study CLCI699C2X01B)
Registry
The  purpose  of  this  study  is  the  evaluation  of  long-term 
safety of osilodrostat in patients who have already received 
osilodrostat  treatment 
in  a  previous  global  Novartis 
sponsored trial and who, based on investigators’ judgement, 
will continue benefiting from its administration.
Primary objective: 
- To  evaluate  the  long-term  safety  data  with  osilodrostat 
treatment (i.e., adverse events and serious adverse events).
Secondary objectives:
- To  evaluate  the  clinical  benefit  as  assessed  by  the 
Investigator;
- To evaluate the long-term safety of osilodrostat treatment, 
as assessed by physical examination, laboratory data, vital 
signs, ECG and pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Rationale  and  study  objectives: The  aim  is  to  further 
document the long-term safety of osilodrostat administered 
in  routine  clinical  practice  in  patients  with  CS  treated  with 
osilodrostat.
Primary objective:
- to collect and assess safety data with a particular focus on 
hypocortisolism,  CV  safety,  QT  prolongation  and  hormones 
of  the  HPA-axis  including  ACTH  increase,  and  clinical 
consequences of increased sexual hormones. The long-term 
safety of non-CD CS patients will also be assessed.

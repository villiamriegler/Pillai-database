EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This is an assessment of data for docetaxel, in accordance with the Article 46 of the regulation of 
the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  (EC)  No.1901/2006,  as  amended,  sanofi  has 
submitted  information  on  this  international  paediatric  study  EFC10339  completed  on  29  may 
2012.  France is Rapporteur for this procedure. 
On  16  May  2008,  a  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  (EMEA-000029-PIP01-07)  has  been  adopted 
by the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) for docetaxel in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.  
The objective of the PIP EFC10339 study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition 
of docetaxel to the combination of cisplatin-5-fluorouracil (TCF) vs. Cisplatin-5-fluorouracil (CF) 
in the induction treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in children and adolescents.

INTRODUCTION 
On  14  august  2012,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  docetaxel,  in 
accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as  amended,  on  medicinal 
products for paediatric use. 
A critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The  MAH  states  that,  in  accordance  with  Article  16(2)  of    Regulation  (EC)  No.  726/2004,  the 
submitted  data  do  not  influence  the  benefit-risk  balance  for  docetaxel  and  therefore  do  not 
require to take further regulatory action on the Marketing authorisation of Taxotere.  
IV. 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
IV.1 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Docetaxel is approved and marketed in the European Union in monotherapy or in combination 
for  several  indications  in  adults  (breast  cancer,  locally  advanced  non-small  cell  lung  cancer, 
metastatic gastric cancer, hormone refractory prostate cancer and head and neck cancer). 
Docetaxel in Polysorbate 80 for intravenous administration is available in two presentations: 
•  Two-vials: 20 mg/0.5 ml and 80 mg/2 ml concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion 
•  One-vial: 20 mg/1 ml, 80 mg/4 ml and 160 mg/8 ml concentrate for solution for infusion 
The  docetaxel  pharmaceutical  formulation  used  in  the  EFC10339  study  was  the 
concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion.

IV.3  Clinical aspects 
1.  Introduction 
The MAH has submitted:  
•  The clinical study report of study ECF 10339:  
•  The EFC10339 abbreviated study report 
•  The pharmacokinetics results of docetaxel (when added to CF) in paediatric patients 
obtained from the EFC10339 study 
•  The clinical overview 
The objective of the PIP EFC10339 study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition 
of docetaxel to the combination of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF) versus the cisplatin and 5-
fluorouracil (CF) combination in the induction treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in 
children and adolescents. 
The  EFC10339  abbreviated  study  report  presents  the  overall  survival  results  from  date  of 
randomization  to  three  years  following  the  end  of  the  consolidation  period  (ie,  from  study  start 
date of 22 November 2007 to 23 February 2012 [last patient, last 3-year follow-up visit date]). In 
addition any new or updated serious adverse event information reported between 23 April 2009 
and database lock on 29 May 2012, inclusive, is provided in updated and new patient narratives, 
as applicable. 
The pharmacokinetics results of docetaxel (when added to CF) in paediatric patients obtained 
from the EFC10339 study, compared to those observed in adults after monotherapy at the same 
docetaxel dose (75 mg/m²), have been analyzed in the BAY0016 study report. 
2.  Clinical study(ies) 
As the EFC10339 study has been completed on 29 May 2012 (database lock for 3-year follow- 
up period), this paediatric study report is submitted under the Article 46 of the European 
Regulation (EC) 1901/2006, as amended. 
Results  taken  from  the  PIP  EFC10339  study:  a  randomized,  international,  multicenter  study  in 
Paediatric patients comparing docetaxel + cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (TCF) to cisplatin + 5-
FU  (CF)  in  the  induction  treatment  of  nasopharyngeal  carcinoma  (NPC)  have  been  provided. 
This pivotal study enrolled 75 patients in a 2:1 randomization.

3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In  study  EFC10339,  the  overall  complete  response  rate  after  induction  treatment  of  NPC  in 
children and adolescents showed that 1 patient out of 50 in the TCF group (2.0%) had an overall 
complete  response  while  none  of  the  25  patients  in  the  CF  group  had  an  overall  complete 
response.  Overall, there were no differences between the groups. The PR rate was 76% in the 
TCF group  and  80%  in  the  CF  group. The  distribution  of  OS rates  over  3  years  follow-up  was 
similar in children and adolescents with NPC treated with docetaxel and CF compared with CF 
alone [Hazard ratio (95% CI): 0.67 (0.218-2.056), p=0.4809] and that docetaxel did not appear to 
increase the survival benefit in this patient population. 
The  response  rates  in  study  EFC10339  were  lower  than  those  assumed  in  the  sample  size 
calculations,  which  assumed  a  complete  response  rate  of  31%  after  3  cycles  of  induction 
therapy for the experimental arm (TCF) and a 20% complete response rate for the control arm 
(CF).  The  complete  response  rate  assumption  of  31%  was  based  on  a  study  by 
Rodriquez-Galindo et al in which Paediatric patients with NPC were treated with 4 courses of a 
regimen consisting of methotrexate (120 mg/m²) on Day 1, cisplatin (100 mg/m²) 24 hours later, 
and  5-FU  (1000 mg/m²/day  continuous  infusion  for  3  days  with  leucovorin  25  mg/m²  every 
6 hours  for  6 doses.  Radiation  was  given  after  chemotherapy.  After  4  courses,  a  complete 
response  rate  of  31%  was  reported. The  mean survival  time  was  23.45,  and  the  mean  overall 
survival was 60.13 months. 
Mertens et al studied the treatment of NPC in paediatric patients in Europe. They administered 3 
courses  of  preradiation  chemotherapy  consisting  of  methotrexate  (120  mg/m²)  on  Day  1, 
cisplatin  (100  mg/m²)  on  Day  1,  and  5-FU  (1000  mg/m²  continuous  infusion  for  5  days  with 
leucovorin  25 mg/m²  every  6  hours for  6  doses  beginning  on  Day  2.  Radiation  was  given  after 
chemotherapy.  The  complete  response  rate  was  14%  after  3  courses  of  preradiation 
chemotherapy. 
In  study  EFC10339,  the  patients  received  only  3  courses  of  combination  chemotherapy  with 
TCF.  The  difference  in  response  rate  between  EFC10339  and  these  2  other  older  Paediatric 
studies may have been due to differences in response evaluation. In EFC10339, response was 
evaluated  by  a  blinded  panel  of  experts,  which  is  a  more  reliable  methodology  than  unblinded 
investigator  evaluation.    Mertens  et  al  and  Rodriguez-Galindo  et  al  did  not  use  independent 
blinded review, which may have contributed to higher reported response rates. 
In  addition,  different  response  criteria  were  used  in  these  studies.  A  CR  in  the  Mertens  study 
was defined as disappearance of all target lesions on MRI. Responses were not independently 
confirmed.    Rodriquez-Galindo  et  al  defined  CR  as  no  evidence  of  disease  by  CT  or  MRI.    In 
EFC10339,  CR  was  defined  as  the  complete  disappearance  of  the  target  and  non-target 
lesion(s) after radiological evaluation. 
There are also differences in the extent of disease in these studies. Both the Mertens study and 
EFC10339  had  higher  proportions  of  patients  with  Stage  4  disease  than  did  the  Rodriquez-
Galindo study. The proportion of patients with Stage 4 disease (53%) in the Mertens study was 
similar  to  that  in  EFC10339  (58.0%  TCF,  52.0%  CF).  The  proportion  of  patients  with  Stage  4 
disease in the Rodriquez-Galindo study was only 13%, which may have contributed to the higher 
response rate.

V. 
RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
Since the results presented in this clinical overview show that docetaxel monotherapy, as well as 
combination therapy with cisplatin and 5-FU was not demonstrated to be effective in treating 
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (based on the response rate during induction therapy), the MAH will 
not seek an indication for docetaxel therapy in paediatric patients. 
This is considered acceptable.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for siponimod, the scientific conclusions 
of the CHMP are as follows: 
In view of available data on lymphopenia from spontaneous reports and in view of a plausible mechanism 
of  action,  the  PRAC  concluded  that  the  product  information  of  products  containing  siponimod  should  be 
amended accordingly in order to ensure a better monitoring of lymphopenia and align the recommendations 
with the product information of fingolimod. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for siponimod the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing siponimod is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

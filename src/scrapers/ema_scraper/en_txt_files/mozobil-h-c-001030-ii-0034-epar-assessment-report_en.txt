2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
About the product 
Plerixafor (Mozobil) is a small-molecule bicyclam derivative that reversibly antagonizes the CXCR4 
chemokine receptor and blocks binding of its cognate ligand, stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α, also 
known as CXCL12). This interruption of the CXCR4/SDF-1α interaction results in mobilization of HSCs 
positive for cell surface glycoprotein CD34 (CD34+ cells) to the peripheral blood where they can be 
collected for HSC transplantation. 
Currently, Mozobil is approved for the following indication: 
Mozobil is indicated in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to enhance 
mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous 
transplantation in adult patients with lymphoma and multiple myeloma whose cells mobilise poorly (see 
section 4.2). 
This indication was based on the evaluation of two phase 3 placebo-controlled efficacy and safety studies 
with plerixafor in conjunction with G–CSF in patients with non Hodgkin lymphoma (AMD3100-3101) and 
in patients with multiple myeloma (AMD3100- 3102). This was supported by two phase 2 efficacy and 
safety studies with plerixafor in conjunction with G-CSF in patients with non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) 
and multiple myeloma (MM) and 8 clinical pharmacology studies and 10 supportive studies (see EPAR 
Mozobil). 
About the condition 
Patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) to treat malignant disorders suffer from severe and 
potentially fatal myeloablation. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using 
mobilized peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) collected by apheresis is a common strategy 
for repopulation of the bone marrow and regeneration of trilineage blood cells (red blood cells, platelets, 
neutrophils). To yield a sufficient number of stem cells for apheresis, HSCs are increased in the peripheral 
blood by treating patients with G-CSF or with non-myeloablative chemotherapy, often in combination with 
G-CSF. However, a significant proportion of patients may not be able to mobilize a sufficient or target 
number of cells for transplantation(s) with these HSC mobilization regimens.In children, single or tandem 
myeloablative chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support is used during the treatment of refractory 
lymphoma and solid tumours, such as, but not limited to medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, Ewing’s 
sarcoma, and germ cell tumours. Paediatric patients with these relatively chemotherapy-resistant 
tumours, receive high-dose chemotherapy (HDC), causing severe and potentially fatal myeloablation that 
requires stem cell rescue to repopulate the bone marrow and regenerate trilineage blood cells. In order to 
obtain stem cells from peripheral blood, the cells have to be “mobilised” from the bone marrow into the 
peripheral blood.  
By using conventional mobilization protocols, about 20% of patients fail to collect enough cells to proceed 
to the autologous transplant. In order to proceed to the transplant, these patients are offered a second 
round of stem cell mobilization and stem cell collection using intensive chemotherapy, which requires a 
further inpatient admission, additional chemotherapy, and G-CSF. These additional mobilization attempts 
are only effective in a limited number of patients. When additional mobilization fails, patients may either 
be ineligible for a transplant procedure which may negatively impact their survival, or alternatively they 
may have to undergo allogeneic transplantation which is a more complex procedure with higher morbidity 
and cost. There is a need for new treatment options by which more paediatric patients needing HDC 
Assessment report

therapy, could proceed to autologous stem cell transplantation. 
This is a type II variation in order to extent the indication to paediatric patients (1 to less than 18 years) 
The indication initially applied was:  
Mozobil is indicated in combination with G-CSF to enhance mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells to 
the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in children with lymphoma 
or solid malignant tumours and either: 
- 
low circulating stem cell count on the predicted day of collection after mobilisation with G-CSF 
(with or without chemotherapy) or 
-  who previously failed to collect sufficient haematopoietic stem cells  
The indication approved by the CHMP following this assessment was:  
Mozobil in paediatric patients (1 to less than 18 years) in combination with G-CSF to enhance mobilisation 
of haematopoietic stem cells to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous 
transplantation in children with lymphoma or solid malignant tumours, either: 
- 
pre-emptively, when circulating stem cell count on the predicted day of collection after adequate 
mobilization with G-CSF (with or without chemotherapy) is expected to be insufficient with 
regards to desired hematopoietic stem cells yield, or 
-  who previously failed to collect sufficient haematopoietic stem cells (see section 4.2). 
To support this extension of the indication Applicant has submitted the studies as agreed in PIP (EMEA-
000174-PIP-01-07-M03): 
• 
• 
a non-clinical juvenile animal development study completed on time (March 2010); 
a clinical study DFI12860 (also referred to as MOZ15609): Combined dose ranging and 
randomized, open label, comparative study of the efficacy and safety of plerixafor in addition to 
standard regimens for mobilization of haematopoietic stem cells into peripheral blood, and 
subsequent collection by apheresis, versus standard mobilization regimens alone in paediatric 
patients, aged 1 to less than 18 years, with solid tumours eligible for autologous transplants. 
The plerixafor pharmaceutical formulation used in the paediatric study DFI12860 (MOZ15609) was the 
solution for injection and corresponding to the authorized pharmaceutical form. 
These studies were supplemented with a review of the available literature (containing results from 
investigator sponsored studies, data from compassionate use programs and series of individual case 
reports in paediatric patients). Furthermore, support for the use of Mozobil in children may be provided 
by extrapolation of adult data where Mozobil is used in the HSC mobilisation regimen of subjects whose 
CD34+ cells mobilise poorly to standard mobilisation regimens (so-called poor mobilisers).  
2.2.  Quality 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
No updates to the quality aspects of the dossier were submitted. 
The below discussion is focused on the suitability (age-appropriateness) of the dosage form for the 
intended paediatric population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/243012/2019 
Page 10/73 
 
  
 
2.2.2.  Discussion on quality aspects 
Mozobil is a sterile, preservative-free, clear, colourless to pale yellow, isotonic 1.2 ml solution for 
subcutaneous injection containing the drug substance plerixafor in a concentration of 20 mg/ml. The 
product is packaged in a glass vial. Each vial contains 24 mg plerixafor. pH is 6.0 – 7.5 and osmolality is 
260 – 320 mOsm/kg.  
A solution for injection as such can be considered a suitable dosage form for use in children. 
The product contains sodium chloride, water for injections, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide as 
excipients. No safety issues are foreseen with these excipients for use in children. 
No dosing device is supplied with the drug product. Plerixafor has to be drawn up into a syringe size type 
which should be selected according to the weight of the patient. For low weight patients, up to 45 kg of 
body weight, 1 ml syringes for use in infant patients can be used. This type of syringe has major 
graduations for 0.1 ml and minor graduations for 0.01 ml and therefore is suitable to administer 
plerixafor - at a dose of 240 µg/kg - to paediatric patients of at least 9 kg body weight. For patients of 
more than 45 kg, 1 mL or 2 mL syringe with graduations that allow a volume to 0.1mL to be accurately 
measured can be used. However - based on the recommended dose for children, a single dose for e.g. a 
1 year old child (of about 9.5 kg bodyweight) would be 2.28 mg; the minimum single dose volume would 
then be 0.114 ml.   
The MAH did not perform dosing accuracy studies using the intended 1 ml syringes and the Mozobil drug 
product which are normally required. Instead reference is made to the criteria of ISO 7886-1 Sterile 
hypodermic syringes for single use which specifies general quality requirements for these type of 
syringes, amongst others accuracy. However, considering the composition of the drug product (active 
substance, sodium chloride, water for injection and excipients for pH adjustment), it is assumed that the 
syringe accuracy performance will not be impacted by the drug product properties and therefore the 
allowed range of deviation from the intended (rounded) dose volume, conform the criteria of ISO 7886-1, 
may be used to assess the worst case scenarios of deviation from the intended dose volume leading to 
potential under- and overdosing. It can be seen that the deviation from the intended (rounded) dose 
volume decreases with increasing dose volume. It is generally known that accuracy is lower for 
measuring smaller dose volumes. However, rounding of volumes normally occurs in the clinical setting for 
drug product doses calculated based on body weight and the fact that it concerns a drug product with no 
narrow therapeutic index, the maximum calculated deviations from the intended dose can be accepted. 
(see also the ‘Q&A on Quality-medicines; part-2, Graduation of measuring devices for liquid dosage 
forms’ updated Nov 2018).  Therefore, the use of 1.0 ml syringes from the indicated suppliers can be 
accepted for measuring doses in the intended paediatric population.  
2.2.3.  Conclusions on quality aspects 
Since the concern on the dosing accuracy was suitably addressed, there are no issues from a quality 
perspective for the product to be intended for the paediatric population. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Plerixafor (MOZOBIL, AMD3100, GZ316455) is a small molecule, bicyclam derivative (ATC code: 
L03AX16) that selectively and reversibly antagonizes the CXCR4 chemokine receptor and blocks binding 
of its cognate ligand stromal cell–derived factor-1α (SDF-1α). Plerixafor is approved in combination with 
G-CSF to enhance mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells to the peripheral blood for collection and

subsequent autologous transplantation in patients with lymphoma and multiple myeloma whose cells 
mobilize poorly. The structural formula of plerixafor is shown in Figure 1.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
No new non-clinical pharmacological data have been submitted in this application, which is considered 
acceptable. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new non-clinical pharmacokinetic data have been submitted in this application, which is considered 
acceptable. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Exploratory single- and repeat-dose range-finding study in juvenile male Yorkshire pigs 
In an exploratory (non-GLP) dose range-finding study, plerixafor was administered to juvenile male 
Yorkshire pigs (24.5-28.2 kg) at single subcutaneous (SC) doses of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 12 mg/kg or repeat 
SC doses of 4.75 mg/kg/day for 4 days. The toxicity results were consistent with results seen in other 
toxicology studies. Plerixafor was well tolerated at single doses of ≤6 mg/kg and for 4 days of dosing at 
4.75 mg/kg/day. After a single dose, clinical signs of lateral recumbence and “looked uncomfortable” 
were observed 1-2 hours post-dose at 8 mg/kg and mortality at 12 mg/kg. At doses of 4 and 2 mg/kg 
observed clinical signs were loose feces, and slight shaking (but this might be related to temperature 
difference due to separation from herd). No clinical signs were found at 1 and 6 mg/kg or after repeated 
administration of 4.75 mg/kg. Two distinct phases of increase of white blood cell counts (WBC) were 
found, peaking near 4 and 12 hrs post-dose respectively. At 24 hrs WBC were back at baseline. No clear 
difference in effect was found between 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg, or between 6 and 8 mg/kg. The effect (area 
under curve of WBC) of 6 and 8 mg/kg clearly exceeded that of the three lower doses. The plasma 
concentration of 28 659 ng/mL (57 μM) observed following the death at 12 mg/kg is consistent with 
plasma exposure concentrations with serious adverse effects in other species. Pharmacokinetics after 
doses of 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 mg/kg showed an approximately dose proportional increase of AUC0-24hr of 10.15 
– 75.40 hr.μM, a less than dose proportional increase of Cmax of 5.02 – 23.59 μM, a tmax of 0.5 hr, and an 
Assessment report

elimination half-life in the range 3.51 – 4.41 hr. In summary, plerixafor produced the expected 
pharmacological effect of leucocytosis. Overall, the steepness of these dose-response effects and the 
nature of the observed effects are consistent with those from both single and repeat-dose toxicology 
studies in rats and dogs. Because only one animal was tested per dose level, the interanimal variability of 
the toxicity response is not known. 
Exploratory subcutaneous juvenile toxicity dose range-finding study in the rat 
In an exploratory (non-GLP) dose range-finding toxicity study, daily SC administration of plerixafor to 
juvenile Sprague-Dawley rats from Postnatal Day (PND)21 to PND50 at dose levels 1.5, 5, 10, or 15 
mg/kg/day was well tolerated with respect to the absence of adverse clinical signs, body weight or food 
consumption effects. A marked increase in white blood cell count was recorded at dose levels of ≥1.5 
mg/kg/day, considered to reflect test article pharmacology. Slight effects on blood magnesium or urea 
were also seen at dose levels of ≥5 mg/kg/day. Higher body weight related spleen weight and a marginal 
increase in the age of attainment of vaginal perforation were seen at ≥5 mg/kg/day, and marginally 
higher liver weight at 15 mg/kg/day was also observed. The effects on organ weights were thought to 
reflect an adaptive response to test article administration. One male given 5 mg/kg/day (Male 23) and 1 
male given 15 mg/kg/day (Male 46) were noted to have a large spleen at necropsy, and accordingly, 
these males had the highest absolute spleen weights recorded for the study. Enlarged spleen was also 
noted in toxicity studies with adult animals supporting the MAA filed for the adult patient population.  
Subcutaneous juvenile toxicity study in the rat 
In a GLP toxicity study (Study GT-249-TX-9), the effects of plerixafor on the juvenile development of the 
rat were investigated following once daily subcutaneous administration to pups from PND21 through 
PND50. The toxicokinetics of plerixafor in juvenile rats was also evaluated. 
Thirty-six timed-mated Sprague-Dawley female rats were allowed to litter. Pups were selected so that 24 
pups of each sex were allocated to each dose group (Groups 1 to 4) and each group was subdivided into 
Subsets I and II, consisting of 12 animals per sex. Pups were dosed once daily via subcutaneous injection 
with vehicle, 1.5, 7.6, or 15 mg/kg/day plerixafor from PND21 through PND50, using a constant dose 
volume of 5 mL/kg. Individual doses were adjusted according to the most recently recorded body weight. 
Pre-weaning pup development tests were conducted for all litters prior to the commencement of dosing, 
and clinical observations, body weight and food consumption were recorded at regular intervals 
throughout the study. 
Crown to rump and tarsus bone lengths were measured, and developmental and behavioural tests were 
conducted on Subset I pups (with the Figure Eight maze conducted on some of Subset I and II animals). 
Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory investigations were also obtained towards the end of the 
treatment period. All Subset I pups were killed on PND51 and subjected to necropsy. Selected tissues 
were weighed, fixed, processed to slide and examined microscopically. 
Pups allocated to Subset II were assessed for sexual development and blood samples for toxicokinetic 
assessment were collected on PND50. At approximately 10 weeks of age, following a treatment-free 
period of approximately 3 weeks, male and female pups from the same dose group were paired to assess 
reproductive performance. Subset II females were killed on Gestation Day (GD)13 and subjected to 
necropsy, where the pregnancy status, number of corpora lutea and number and distribution of 
implantations were recorded. Subset II males were killed and subjected to necropsy approximately 14 
days after completion of the mating period. Selected tissues were retained and fixed for both sexes.

a Values are rounded to 3 significant figures 
Peak plasma concentration and systemic exposure to plerixafor on PND50 increased with increasing dose 
level in a dose proportional manner. The time of peak plasma concentration occurred 30 minutes after 
dosing, after which levels declined with a mean apparent half-life of 1.1 to 1.2 hours, where measurable. 
No marked differences in peak or systemic exposure of plerixafor between the sexes were apparent.  
On Day 50 of age, concentrations of Plerixafor were measurable up to 8 hours post-dose at 1.5 
mg/kg/day and up to 24 hours post-dose at 7.6 or 15 mg/kg/day, indicating continuous exposure to 
Plerixafor at the mid and high dose levels following repeated dosing. The data at the mid and high dose 
levels also indicated that steady-state had been reached by Day 50 of age. 
Clinical signs of unsteady gait and/or decreased activity were noted on the first or second days of dosing 
for several animals given 15 mg/kg/day. These effects had fully recovered 2 hour subsequent to dose 
administration and there were no further clinical signs noted throughout the remainder of the study. Two 
males at 15 mg/kg/day were dosed twice in error on PND50, and showed clinical signs of prostration, 
unsteady gait, decreased activity and slow, laboured breathing; these signs were resolved by 2 hours 
after the second dose, and there were no additional clinical signs during the remainder of the study. 
Given that the clinical signs were transient in nature and present only in a limited number of animals, 
they were considered not to be adverse. 
In the subset of rats euthanized on PND51, slightly lower group mean body weight gain over the entire 
treatment period was noted for males at 15 mg/kg/day and for females at all doses. There were no 
differences in group mean absolute body weight for a subset of animals used for the reproductive phase 
of the study, suggesting that any effects on body weight could recover within the short period of time 
between cessation of dosing on PND50 and mating approximately 3 weeks later. As the decreases in body 
weight gain were minor and did not produce a decline in the condition of the animals, the effects on body 
weight gain were considered not to be adverse. Markedly higher leukocyte counts were seen for both 
sexes at all dose levels of plerixafor, however, this effect was expected due to the pharmacology of the 
test article. Other minor haematological effects (slightly lower haemoglobin concentration and packed cell 
volume, and marginally lower red blood cell counts) without histopathology correlates were seen at 15 
mg/kg/day plerixafor, and were not considered to be toxicologically meaningful. 
Higher group mean blood urea concentrations were seen for males at 15 mg/kg/day and for females at ≥
7.6 mg/kg/day, with some animals having individual values above the background data range. In 
addition, lower group mean total protein concentrations occurred in both sexes at ≥7.6 mg/kg/day, and 
this was considered likely to be associated with the lower calcium and magnesium concentrations also 
seen at these dose levels. As there were no changes in the liver or kidneys at histopathological 
examination and the magnitude of the changes in blood chemistry parameters was not sufficient to affect 
the health of the animals, these effects on blood urea and total protein were considered not to be adverse 
in nature.

Group mean relative (to body weight) thymus weights were slightly lower at ≥7.6 mg/kg/day in the 
subset of males euthanized on PND51, and group mean relative liver weights were slightly higher at 15 
mg/kg/day in the subset of females euthanized on PND51. The effect on thymus weight was considered 
to be associated with plerixafor pharmacology and the higher liver weights were thought to be an 
adaptive response to plerixafor administration. No organ weight effects were noted for the reproductive 
subset animals, which had been allocated to a treatment-free period. Considering the organ weight 
findings were limited to one sex, were slight, there were no associated histopathology changes and that 
the effects were not present in the reproductive cohort rats, the organ weight changes were considered 
not to be adverse. 
In conclusion, once daily subcutaneous injection of plerixafor to juvenile Sprague-Dawley rats from 
PND21 to PND50 at dose levels of 1.5, 7.6, or 15 mg/kg/day was generally well tolerated. Blood 
chemistry changes (higher blood urea concentration and lower plasma protein, calcium and magnesium 
concentrations) and slightly lower body weight gain were seen at ≥7.6 mg/kg/day, and transient clinical 
signs were noted at 15 mg/kg/day at the start of treatment; these changes were not considered adverse 
because of their small changes, transient nature, and/or not affecting the health of the rats. Marked 
leucocytosis was seen at all dose levels of plerixafor, and slightly lower thymus weights relative to body 
weight were recorded at ≥7.6 mg/kg/day in males; however, these effects were considered to reflect 
plerixafor pharmacology rather than toxicity. Higher body weight-related liver weights were also noted at 
15 mg/kg/day in females, although this was considered to represent an adaptive response to plerixafor 
administration. Any changes in thymus or liver weight were limited only to one sex, did not correspond to 
histopathological changes in either affected organ, and there were no effects on organ weights in 
reproductive cohort animals. No adverse developmental effects were observed in these juvenile rats at 
any dose level tested. 
Consequently, the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL) for juvenile toxicity was considered to be 
15 mg/kg/day SC. 
Based on body surface area, dose margins at the highest clinical paediatric dose of 11.8 mg/m2 (ie, 320 
μg/kg) in children 2 to 12 years of age [MOZ15609/DFI12860], and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
of 90 mg/m2 (ie, 15 mg/kg/day) in the juvenile rat study would be 7.6-fold based on body surface area 
or 47-fold based on dose. The dose margins in the GLP juvenile toxicity study in rats relative to the 
highest clinical paediatric dose are shown below.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the scope described in the ERA Guideline, given that this application is for a product 
with Orphan Drug status in Europe, the absence of a phased approach ERA as specified in the guideline is 
considered justified in that the total quantity of Mozobil 20 mg/ml solution for injection used will be below 
the ERA Phase II Predicted Environmental Concentration in surface water (PECsurfacewater) action limit of 
0.01 μg/L. This is because epidemiology data and projected sales of the product result in a market 
Assessment report  
EMA/243012/2019 
Page 15/73 
 
  
 
 
 
penetration factor (Fpen) which results in a PECsurfacewater value of <0.001 μg/L. Consequently, there would 
be no significant environmental risk from Mozobil 20 mg/ml solution for injection using the conservative 
assumptions of the Phase I ERA guidance. 
Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration 
The data used to determine a prevalence rate in Europe of less than 1 person in 10,000 was the grounds 
for the orphan drug designation granted for plerixafor. At the time of orphan drug designation, treatment 
to mobilize progenitor cells prior to stem cell transplantation affected less than 1 in 10,000 people in the 
European Union (EU). This is equivalent to a total of fewer than 46,000 people, and is below the threshold 
for orphan designation, which is 5 people in 10,000. This is based on the information provided by the 
sponsor and knowledge of the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP). 
Based on these epidemiology data and the prevalence rate in the orphan designation, a conservative 
prevalence of 10 per 100,000 in the European population was used to calculate the PECsurfacewater using the 
refined formula in the CHMP ERA guideline: 
This is a conservative calculation since it does not consider metabolism or degradation of plerixafor, 
patient presentation, diagnosis or compliance rates and the assumption that all patients are dosed 365 
days per year.  
The pharmaceutical excipients in the formulation are Sodium chloride, Hydrochloric acid, Sodium 
hydroxide and Water for injections. All of these excipients are well known and commonly used, some in 
very small quantities, and comply with the Ph. Eur., in-house and other reference standards. The 
excipients are considered by the expert to be inactive with very low toxicity and do not present a 
significant environmental toxicity risk. Considerations of the environmental risk were therefore limited to 
the active substance plerixafor. 
Although an exemption from preparation of an ERA is claimed, Genzyme performed one following the 
concepts of the CHMP ERA guideline for the original submission. The ERA was performed using data to 
identify the environmental fate and any significant environmental risks from exposure to the active 
substance plerixafor.  
Table 4: Summary of environmental fate data for plerixafor  
Assessment report  
EMA/243012/2019 
Page 16/73 
 
  
 
 
 
In accordance with the CHMP ERA guideline, an exemption from preparation of Phase II ERA studies is 
claimed because there are no apparent environmental concerns about the product, and based on 
published epidemiology studies, the PECsurfacewater will be less than 0.01 μg/L. Consequently the product is 
unlikely to present a risk for the environment following its prescribed use in patients. As such, no 
precautionary and safety measures need to be imposed regarding the environmental release from use in 
patients or from disposal of unused products or waste materials derived from the medicinal product. 
Although no Phase II ERA studies or precautionary or safety measures are needed for this medicinal 
product, a review of available data was made and an ERA was performed for the active substance 
plerixafor. These data do not indicate a significant environmental impact from its use. 
To encourage proper disposal of unused medicines as a means to protect the environment and in 
accordance with recommendations in the CHMP 2006 Guidance, the proposed package leaflet should 
include the following statement: “Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. 
Ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect 
the environment.” 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A dose range finding and a pivotal juvenile toxicity study, in which rats were dosed 1.5-15 mg/kg/day 
from PND 21 to PND 50, were submitted. Rats in the juvenile toxicity study are dosed from PND21 to PND 
50 to support a paediatric indication. However, to cover human age period up to 18 years, rats should 
have been dosed starting earlier and ending later. Nevertheless, it is accepted that as the immune system 
is the pharmacological target organ and that the rat’s immune system at PND 21 is equivalent to 1 year 
old humans. The MAH also describes the development of the human immune system from formation of 
HSCs towards the development of the thymic microenvironment, which is complete between 1 and 2 
years of age and at PND 21, the immune system could be compared to a human immune system of 1-2 
years. As such the pharmacological effect of plerixafor has sufficiently been studied in juvenile animals. 
Moreover, as the safety profile of plerixafor in adult and juvenile animals is very similar, it is not expected 
that any new safety effects will appear in a study with younger juvenile animals, i.e. those equivalent to  
children between 1 and 2 years old. Therefore, it is not supported to conduct another juvenile animal 
study to address safety in children between below 2 years of age. However, it is recommended to keep 
monitoring the safety profile of plerixafor in 1-2 years aged children, which is also to be included in the 
safety specification (see RMP).  
Plerixafor selectively and reversibly antagonizes the CXCR4 chemokine receptor and blocks binding of its 
cognate ligand stromal cell–derived factor-1α (SDF-1α). This results in mobilization of hematopoietic stem 
cells from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood. Thus, increased extramedullary haematopoiesis could 
be expected based on the pharmacological action of the product. The observed (marked) leucocytosis 
seen at all dose levels of plerixafor, and slightly lower thymus weights relative to body weight were

EMA/243012/2019 
Page 17/73 
 
  
 
 
recorded at ≥7.6 mg/kg/day in males were considered to reflect plerixafor pharmacology rather than 
toxicity. 
Plerixafor administration also result in changes in blood chemistry, such as higher blood urea 
concentration and lower plasma protein, calcium and magnesium concentrations. Slightly lower body 
weight gain was seen at doses of  ≥7.6 mg/kg/day, and transient clinical signs were noted at 15 
mg/kg/day at the start of treatment. These changes were not considered adverse by the applicant 
because of their small changes, transient nature, and/or not affecting the health of the rats. Higher body 
weight-related liver weights ( 15 mg/kg/day in females) in the pivotal and  the higher spleen weights 
relative to body weight in the DRF study were considered adaptive responses (extracellular 
haematopoiesis)  to plerixafor administration, by the applicant. The changes in thymus or liver weight 
were limited only to one sex, did not correspond to histopathological changes in either affected organ and  
organ weights in reproductive cohort animals were unchanged. The observed effects were regarded non 
adverse by the applicant resulting in a NOAEL of 15 mg/kg/day SC, which was the highest dose tested. 
Based on body surface area, dose margins at the highest clinical paediatric dose of 11.8 mg/m2 (ie, 320 
μg/kg) in children 2 to 12 years of age [MOZ15609/DFI12860], and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
of 90 mg/m2 (ie, 15 mg/kg/day) in the juvenile rat study would be 7.6-fold based on body surface area 
or 47-fold based on dose.  
In addition, the pharmacological and toxicological findings in the juvenile animals are not compared to the 
pharmacological and toxicological findings in the adults animals (rats) as studied to support the original 
MAA, which was granted in 2009. This would have been informative though, to interpret the nature of the 
findings in the juvenile toxicity study. Furthermore, an exposure multiple between juvenile rat at the 
NOAEL and the paediatric dose to be used in the clinic, will be more informative then the margins 
between rat and human based on body surface or dose.  
The potential effects of plerixafor on male fertility and postnatal development have not been evaluated in 
non-clinical studies. 
Following discussion of the pharmacological and toxicological findings in the juvenile toxicity study in 
relation to those obtained in the studies with adult animals (conducted in support for the MAA, which was 
granted in 2009) it was found that these effects were similar, which indicates that there are no additional 
targets of toxicity upon plerixafor treatment in juvenile animals (see section 5.3 of the SmPC).  
The MAH provided data on rat to human margins based on dose, body surface area and exposure. 
Margins at the highest clinical pediatric dose of 11.8 mg/m2 (ie, 320 μg/kg) in children 2 to 12 years of 
age and the MTD of 90 mg/m2 (ie, 15 mg/kg/day) in the juvenile rat toxicity study were 7.6-fold based 
on body surface area or 47-fold based on dose and ≥ 18 based on exposure. Plerixafor is thus tested in 
juvenile rat with a sufficient safety margin.  
The studies in miniature pigs -submitted as part of the original plerixafor registration, - showed that the 
lethal dose for pigs is lower than the NOAEL for rats. Pig may have been a more sensitive species to test 
juvenile toxicity. In miniature pigs a dose of 12/mg/kg appeared lethal. According to the applicant this 
occurs at exposures that also appear to be lethal in other species. This underscores the need for a 
comparison of exposure in animals (rat and also miniature pig) with the exposure in children.  
Further, the MAH was asked to justify the maximum dose in relation to the pharmacological effect on 
mobilisation of WBC and CD34+ cells (this issue is touched upon in the discussion on results obtained in 
the study with Yorkshire pigs that was included in the original application and discussed in the non clinical 
toxicological summary included with this application). In its response, the MAH described the mobilisation 
of several types of immune cell upon plerixafor administration to several species. Apparently, the pig is 
not such a relevant model as the number of lymphocytes is already higher in pig as compared to human. 
Therefore, the study in pig may be less informative with regard to dose extrapolation. In the juvenile rat 
Assessment report  
EMA/243012/2019 
Page 18/73 
 
  
 
study, ‘pharmacologically-mediated, markedly higher total leucocyte counts were observed in both sexes 
at all dose levels, and generally included all white blood cell types (with the exception of lymphocyte 
counts in males).’ Thus, the pharmacological effect was observed in all dose groups in the rat juvenile 
toxicity study. However, determination of a clinical dose required to obtain an optimal pharmacological 
effect, should occur based on clinical studies rather than on animals studies.  
The applicant has provided a Phase I calculation using a refined Fpen. The data used in the Fpen and 
PECsurfacewater calculations in the ERA (1/10,000 persons) used substantiated data for disease 
prevalence for all plerixafor indications, including the current application for use in the paediatric 
population in Europe. The ERA is thus applicable also to this current application. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Non-clinical aspects related to the extension of the indication for plerixafor to children aged 1 to 18 years 
are satisfactorily addressed. Section 5.3 of the SmPC was updated accordingly. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
One Clinical study (DFI12860) was submitted to support the extension of indication to paediatric patients 
(1 to less than 18 years), to be used in combination with G-CSF to enhance mobilisation of 
haematopoietic stem cells to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous 
transplantation in children with lymphoma or solid malignant tumours and either: 
− 
low circulating stem cell count on the predicted day of collection after mobilisation with G-CSF 
(with or without chemotherapy) or 
−  who previously failed to collect sufficient haematopoietic stem cells (see section 4.2). 
GCP 
The clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
• 
Overview of clinical studies  
Clinical study DFI12860 (MOZ15609) is a study of the efficacy and safety of plerixafor  in addition to 
standard regimens for mobilization of haematopoietic stem cells into peripheral blood, and subsequent 
collection by apheresis, versus standard mobilization regimens alone in the paediatric setting. 
This study was conducted in 2 stages: an initial dose-escalation phase (Stage 1), followed by a 
randomized phase (Stage 2) comparing plerixafor at the dose selected in Stage 1 plus standard 
mobilization to standard mobilization alone.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In adults, the pharmacokinetics of plerixafor were characterized by a rapid absorption, with the Tmax 
occurring at approximately 0.5 to 1 hour after SC administration. Plerixafor is administered based on 
weight to provide a dose of 0.24 mg/kg or as fixed dose of 20 mg in patients of 83 kg or less. Based on 
increasing exposure with increasing body weight, the plerixafor dose should not exceed 40 mg. Patients 
with creatinine clearance 20-50 ml/min should have their dose of plerixafor reduced by one-third to 0.16 
mg/kg (and the dose should not exceed 27 mg).  
Figure 2: Average plerixafor concentration-time curves following SC administration of 4 dose levels in 18 
healthy adult volunteers in the original study-1002. 
Plerixafor has a low potential for involvement in P450-dependent drug-drug interactions. The major route 
of elimination of plerixafor is urinary and the elimination half-life (t1/2) in plasma is 3-5 hours. There is 
no significant effect of gender or age on the pharmacokinetics of plerixafor. 
Special populations 
Paediatric 
In stage 1 of the paediatric clinical study DFI12860, patients received plerixafor once daily as a SC 
injection with the sterile solution of 20 mg/ml in doses of 160, 240 and 320 μg/kg, in accordance with the 
dose and age cohort see Table 5: Dose levels per cohort.

As discussed in the PIP, the doses for the dose-escalation phase of the clinical study were selected based 
on simulations with the adult population PK model. The CrCl was included in the model to describe 
clearance (weight and age as covariates). Due to the expected higher clearance in children as compared 
to adults, the highest dose of the 3 dose levels (160, 240 and 320 μg/kg) was predicted to result in 
values of Cmax and AUC that were within the range observed following administration to adults of 160 
and 240 μg/kg plerixafor. Additionally, the applicant suggested that the protocol could be amended to 
examine higher doses (400 μg/kg) following completion of each cohort and evaluation of the safety and 
PK data. All dose escalation decisions during stage 1 were reviewed and approved by an independent data 
monitoring committee. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for all 27 patients, characterised using non-compartmental 
methods and reported and summarised by dosing cohort using descriptive statistics. Blood samples were 
taken during stage 1 of the study at the following time points after the first dose of plerixafor in 12 to 
<18 year olds: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 4, 8, 9 (just prior to apheresis), and 24 hours post first plerixafor dose. 
In younger patients (i.e., <12 years old) a reduced numbers of samples were taken because of the need 
to reduce sampling volumes in paediatric patients with smaller blood volumes. 
Patients of the 2 to <6 age cohort (n=9) were 3.1 (2-5) years of age (mean, range) and 78% of them 
were females. 
Patients of the 6 to <12 age cohort (n=9) were 8.8 (6-11) years of age and 22% of them were females. 
Patients of the 12 to <18 years age cohort (n=9) were 15.2 (13-17) years of age and 67% of them were 
females. 
Safety, PK and PD data from stage 1 was evaluated to determine the appropriate dose(s) and timing of 
plerixafor administration to be used in stage 2.

From these data, the applicant concludes dose proportionality from 160 to 240 μg/kg in all age groups, 
comparable to adults. No increase in exposure (AUC0-9h) above the dose of 240 μg/kg were noted in 
children 2 to <6 years old or 6 to <12 years old. 
The AUC0-9h after a 240 μg/kg dose of plerixafor to 6 to <12 year olds and 12 to <18 year was 
concluded to be similar to that achieved in adults. 
It is noted that the exposure in two 2 to <6 year olds with evaluable PK data were nominally lower than 
the exposures reported in adults, however both subjects achieved sufficient mobilization of CD34+ HSCs 
to proceed to transplant.

A higher dose cohort of 400ug/kg that was permitted by the protocol, was not deemed necessary based 
on the PK/PD results.  
Selection of the final dose for stage 2 (240 μg/kg daily) was based on the absence of clear evidence of an 
age related effect, dose proportionality from 160 to 240 μg/kg in all age groups and no dose proportional 
exposure beyond 240 μg/kg. Thus, the dose for stage 2 was determined to be 240 μg/kg, which is the 
same as that approved for use in adults over 83 kg. 
For stage 2, pharmacokinetics were only characterized for a subset of the treated patients. Patients were 
aged 1 to 18 years. Blood sampling was sparse: 2 samples, drawn 0.25 to 1 hour post dose and prior to 
apheresis 8- 12 hours post dose. According to the protocol, pharmacokinetic data from stage 2 was to be 
added to stage 1 pharmacokinetic data for determination of AUC0-9, Cmax, Tmax and t1/2.  
The data used for paediatric popPK model building was reasonably rich to adequately characterize 
plerixafor pharmacokinetics (PK) in paediatric patients. It included data from both dense PK sampling 
(Stage 1) and sparse PK sampling (Stage 2) over the dose range of 160 to 320 μg/kg. The Stage 1 PK 
sampling ensured that the terminal and distribution phases of the PK profile in paediatric patients were 
well informed, especially when the adult popPK model was used as a starting point to develop the 
paediatric popPK model. The dataset included patients over a broad range of bodyweights over the age 
range of 1 to less than 18 years, essentially ensuring that the paediatric body size effect with age is 
appropriately characterized by using only the paediatric PK data. 
Upon request for supplementary information, the applicant provided pharmacokinetic results of stage 2 as 
well, and developed a pediatric population pharmacokinetic model for plerixafor using the pooled PK data 
from stage 1 and stage 2 of study MOZ15609, based on the adult population pharmacokinetic model. 
Presented results of the model validation indicated good model performance. Below a plot of simulated

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Plerixafor is a small molecule bicyclam derivative that antagonises the CXCR4 chemokine receptor and 
blocks binding of its cognate ligand, stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF-1α, also known as CXCL12). The 
interruption of this interaction results in mobilisation of CD34+ stem cells to the peripheral blood where 
they can be collected for autologous transplantation. 
The mechanism of action of plerixafor is the same in children as in adults; antagonism of CXCR4/SDF-1 
binding.  
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
In Stage 1, peak CD34+ levels generally rose and peaked within the first hour after dosing, with the peak 
lagging behind the maximum plasma concentration of plerixafor, although individual patients showed 
some variation. This pattern was seen in all 3 dose groups (160, 240, and 320 μg/kg) and is consistent 
with the PK/PD relationship in adults treated with plerixafor. 
Figure 10 displays graphs of individual plerixafor concentrations for the 3 age cohorts and PB CD34+ 
levels at different times after first plerixafor dose administration in the 160 μg/kg group. In general, peak 
CD34+ levels found within the first hour after dosing lag behind the maximum plasma concentrations of

plerixafor, but individual patients show some variation. The delayed PD response (ie, increase in CD34+ 
cell count) with rising plasma plerixafor concentration is also observed at 240 and 320 μg/kg dose levels 
and is consistent with the PK/PD relationship in adults treated with plerixafor. Note: Solid lines represent

In the age cohort 2 to <6 years (n=9 across the 3 dose groups) with 9 evaluable patients, 6 patients 
showed a doubling of CD34+ count and 8 patients reached at least 2 × 106 CD34+ cell/kg within the first

Stage 2 data 
The Applicant has further analysed the effect of age on mobilisation using data collected in stage 2 of the 
study; these data indicate that despite lower exposure to plerixafor patients of the low age categories do 
not seem, in general, to behave differently than these of the oldest age category.  
2.4.4.  PK/PD   
In order to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of plerixafor following 0.24 mg/kg 
based and fixed (20 mg) doses, a trial was conducted in adult patients with NHL (N=61) who were 
treated with 0.24 mg/kg or 20 mg of plerixafor. The trial was conducted in patients weighing 70 kg or 
less (median: 63.7 kg , min: 34.2 kg, max: 70 kg). The fixed 20 mg dose showed 1.43-fold higher 
exposure (AUC0-10h) than the 0.24 mg/kg dose. The fixed 20 mg dose also showed numerically higher 
response rate (estimated difference between treatment arms was 5.2% [60.0% vs 54.8%] based on the 
local lab data and 11.7% [63.3% vs 51.6%] based on the central lab data) in attaining the target of ≥ 5 
× 106 CD34+ cells/kg than the mg/kg-based dose. The median time to reach ≥ 5 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg 
was 3 days for both treatment groups, and the safety profile between the groups was similar. Body 
weight of 83 kg was selected as the cut-off point to transition patients from fixed to weight based dosing 
(83 kg x 0.24 mg = 19.92 mg/kg).

2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In both adults and children HSCT rescue is being used for patients suffering from a malignancy requiring 
HDC. However, the underlying malignancies require HDC varies between the adult and paediatric 
population. In adults the two commonest diseases treated by HDC followed by HSCT are multiple 
myeloma and lymphoma. In children the commonest reason for HDT and HSCT is treatment of a solid 
tumour. As a consequence, the chemotherapy regimen is likely to be different between adults and 
children, both the chemotherapy administered before HSC collection as the HDC regimes for which HCS 
rescue is needed. These differences may affect the subjects response to mobilisation regimen as well as 
the marrow recovery and ability for HCS engraftment. However none of these differences would be 
expected to affect the mode of action of Mozobil, i.e. CXCR4/ SDF-1α interactions and therefore the 
ability of Mozobil to mobilise stem cells. Thus the mechanism of action of Mozobil is presumed to be the 
same in children as in adults.  
Limited data on CXCR4 expression in children or adolescents is available. Results of Shalekoff (Shalekoff 
et al. 2004, Clin Diagn Lab Immun), showed that expression of CXCR4 on peripheral blood leukocytes in 
very young children is well below adult levels, but from the age of 15 months onwards, it approached 
adult levels. Based on the available data, it is noted that currently, only in the very young children, there 
is uncertainty regarding the comparability in CXCR4 expression levels with that of the rest of the 
population. 
The immune system is for some specifications different in adults and children, for example in the 
numbers of percentage of different white blood cells. These immune differences are most pronounced in 
paediatric patients under the age of 2. In neonates greater numbers of circulating CD34+ stem cells are 
seen. Therefore, in principle a lower exposure to Mozobil might be sufficient in the lower age group for 
reaching the target amount of CD34+ cells needed for HSCT (2x106/kg). Whether this is the case, needs 
to be determined by a dose finding study stratified by age.  
In conclusion, although there are differences in disease treated and HDC regimens used between 
paediatric and adult populations, the need for HSCT rescue following HDC and thus need for stem cell 
mobilisation to collect sufficient numbers of HSC is the same between adult and paediatric population. As 
the mechanism of action of Mozobil and the expression of CXCR4 and SDF-1 is similar in children as in 
adults a similar response in children as in adults is to be expected. However, the doses needed to obtain 
this response might be different.  
The pharmacokinetics of plerixafor were evaluated in 48 paediatric patients (1 to less than 18 years) with 
solid tumours at subcutaneous doses of 0.16, 0.24 and 0.32 mg/kg with standard mobilisation (G-CSF 
plus or minus chemotherapy). Based on population pharmacokinetic modeling and similar to adults, 
µg/kg-based dosage results in increase in plerixafor exposure with increasing body weight in paediatric 
patients. At the same weight-based dosing regimen of 240 µg/kg, the plerixafor mean exposure (AUC0-
24h) is lower in paediatric patients aged 2 to < 6 years (1410 ng.h/mL), 6 to <12 years (2318 ng.h/mL), 
and 12 to <18 years (2981 ng.h/mL) than in adults (4337 ng.h/mL). However, mobilization of PB CD34+ 
count was observed in stage 2 of the trial. 
In order to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of plerixafor following 0.24 mg/kg 
based and fixed (20 mg) doses, a trial was conducted in adult patients with NHL (N=61) who were 
treated with 0.24 mg/kg or 20 mg of plerixafor weighing 70 kg or less. The fixed 20 mg dose showed 
1.43-fold higher exposure (AUC0-10h) than the 0.24 mg/kg dose and numerically higher response rate in 
attaining the target cells/kg than the mg/kg-based dose with the same median time to target cells/kg (3 
days) for both treatment groups, and similar safety profile between the groups. An age related effect on 
the pharmacokinetics of plerixafor is noted consisting of an increase in clearance and decrease of

Page 30/73 
 
  
 
exposure for the younger patients. This observation and the population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate 
that plerixafor exposure decreases with decreased age/body weight.  
The full study modelling was performed according to the guideline on Reporting the results of population 
pharmacokinetic analyses (CHMP/EWP/185990/06) and included Visual Predictive Checks (VPC) stratified 
on age, VPCs stratified on weight- and prediction-corrected VPCs, ETA's versus weight and age. The plots 
allow for a good comparison of data. It clearly confirms the previous conclusions of a weight effect, and 
possible age effect, on the pharmacokinetics of plerixafor. Although there is an (expected) high 
correlation of age and weight in the study population, the conclusion can be drawn that exposure 
following weight-based dosing increased with weight as well as age. 
Findings from the observed data, and from the simulated data, confirm the expectation that exposure at 
the dose of 320 μg/kg in paediatric patients is more in line with the exposure in adults at 240 μg/kg than 
the paediatric dose of 240 μg/kg. 
These results have been reflected in the SmPC section 5.2. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Plerixafor exposure decreases with decreased age/body weight, but this lower exposure does not seem to 
affect the response to plerixafor containing mobilisation. The markedly lower exposure in the paediatric 
population is reflected in the SmPC. Exposure in different age groups for the 320 µg/kg dose is provided 
to allow the treating physician to decide on potentially increasing the dose if deemed necessary. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical paediatric study DFI12860 (MOZ15609) consisted of an initial dose escalation study (Stage 1) 
followed by a randomized, comparative study extension (Stage 2) at the dose identified as most 
appropriate in the dose escalation part of the study. Stage 2 compared plerixafor administered in 
combination with standard mobilization, to standard mobilization alone. 
Overall, this development program included 72 paediatric patients aged 1 to <18 years with 57 patients 
treated with plerixafor plus standard mobilization (27 in Stage 1 and 30 Stage 2) and 15 treated with 
standard mobilization alone (Stage 2). 
The evaluation of efficacy is focussed on the data collected within study DFI12860, in particular stage 2 of 
this study. 
2.5.1.  Dose response study: DFI12860 Stage 1 
The primary objective was to determine the age appropriate dose and to characterize the safety, 
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of plerixafor when given in addition to standard mobilization 
regimens in paediatric patients (aged 2 to <18 years) with Ewing’s sarcoma/soft tissue sarcoma, 
neuroblastoma, brain tumours, and other malignancies, who were planned to undergo high dose 
chemotherapy, followed by autologous HSCT. Patients with any form of leukaemia were excluded because 
of the concerns about potential tumour cell mobilization and subsequent contamination of apheresis 
product. Similar inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied as in Stage 2 of the study (see below), 
except that Stage 1 included patients age 2 to <18 years and Stage 2 included patients age 1 to <18 
years. 
The primary objective of Stage 1 of this study was to determine the appropriate dose, and to characterize 
the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of plerixafor across age and size in paediatric cancer 
patients when given in addition to standard mobilization of HSCs into peripheral blood. 
Assessment report  
EMA/243012/2019

Dose per age cohort was determined using a standard three plus three dose parallel escalation strategy 
where three patients would be enrolled in a cohort by age group and dose. Three plerixafor dose levels 
were evaluated: 160 μg/kg, 240 μg/kg, and 320 μg/kg (see Table 6). 
The decision whether to expand a particular age-dose cohort to 6 patients or to treat the next cohort of 3 
patients at the next dose-level (240 μg/kg and 320 μg/kg, respectively) was based on the occurrence of 
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). DLTs were defined as non-hematological AEs of toxicity Grade 3 or higher 
according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria that was considered by the Investigator to be 
definitely related or at least possibly related to plerixafor. 
Table 8. Age group versus dose 
Patients were to begin treatment with standard mobilization (GCSF ± chemotherapy), and peripheral 
blood CD34+ counts were to be monitored daily until a “trigger point” minimum of 7 PB CD34+ cells/μL 
was reached. Once the required threshold for PB CD34+was met, patients were to receive their first dose 
of plerixafor the same day in the evening, and were to begin apheresis the next day (approximately one 
hour after administration of G-CSF, 8 to 12 hours after administration of plerixafor). If necessary, 
treatment with plerixafor and G-CSF was to be continued according to the same schedule until a yield of 
at least 2x106 CD34+ cells/kg was reached, or for a maximum of 5 aphereses (see Figure 12). 
For all patients, venous blood samples for peripheral blood CD34+ fluorescence-activated cell sorting 
(FACS) analysis were taken on the morning of the day preceding the first apheresis day and in the 
morning prior to administration of the once daily G-CSF dose on the apheresis day itself. For all patients, 
on each subsequent day of apheresis (up to a maximum of 5 aphereses) samples for FACS analysis were 
collected immediately prior to the dose of G-CSF on the morning of apheresis.

23 of 27 patients demonstrated mobilization sufficient for transplantation. 
Based on the per cohort dose escalation PK and PD data, the dose proposed for use in Stage 2 will be 240 
μg/kg which is the same as that approved for use in adults. 
The dose escalation part of the PIP study DFI12860 (MOZ15609) (Stage 1) was completed in 2013. After 
discussion between the Sponsor and the EMA Paediatric Committee (PDCO), the plerixafor treatment 
regimen selected for Stage 2 was the same as that used in adults, 240 μg/kg the evening prior to 
apheresis approximately 8 to 12 hours later. The resulting protocol proposal for Stage 2 was agreed with 
EMA/Pediatric Committee (PDCO) further to a PIP RfM (EMA Decision dated 29 October 2013).

This study was conducted at 25 active study centres in Israel and 11 European countries: Belgium, Czech 
Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and United Kingdom. 
Adequate harvesting techniques were not yet available for children <2year of age during Stage 1; 
therefore, paediatric patients in this age range were not included.  
In order to maximize study sample representativeness, the following tumour groups were included for 
analysis: Ewing’s sarcoma/soft tissue sarcoma, lymphoma, neuroblastoma, and other malignancies 
including brain tumours. Leukaemia was excluded as the clinical significance and risks of potential tumour 
cell mobilization and re-infusion had not yet been determined.

Treatments 
Subjects started on a standard mobilization (G-CSF ± chemotherapy as per site standard practice). The 
dose of once daily G-CSF was to be 10 μg/kg (which could be increased up to a maximum of 15 μg/kg in 
poor mobilizers). When the trigger point minimum of 7 CD34+ cells/μL in peripheral blood (measured 
locally) was achieved, patients were randomized 2:1 to either receive either plerixafor at a dose of 240 
μg/kg daily starting on the same day in the evening plus standard mobilization or standard mobilization 
alone. 
Plerixafor was to be administered as a SC injection at a separate anatomical site from the patient’s 
standard mobilization treatment. In exceptional circumstances (eg, significant thrombocytopenia), 
plerixafor may have been administered via the intravenous (IV) route, but only with prior authorization 
from the Sponsor. The patients were to begin apheresis the next day (approximately one hour after 
administration of G-CSF, 8 to 12 hours after administration of plerixafor). If necessary, treatment with 
plerixafor and G-CSF was to be continued according to the same schedule until a yield of at least 2x106 
CD34+ cells/kg was reached, or for a maximum of 5 aphereses (see Figure 12). 
Figure 11 Schematic time schedule for administration of G-CSF, plerixafor, and apheresis, and 
respective time for measurement of CD34+ cells in peripheral blood 
Apheresis was to occur if the PB CD34+ count, on the scheduled day of apheresis was ≥20 cells/μL. Stem 
cell collection was to take place using standard procedures and, wherever possible, employing a 3 blood 
volume (±25%) apheresis. 
Prior and concomitant therapy 
Concomitant medications were not required to be recorded on the eCRF with the exception of medications 
that were administered to treat AEs and/or SAEs recorded during the study. Hematologic growth factors 
and blood products were to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF pages.

Objectives 
The primary endpoint in Stage 2 was the difference between the 2 treatment arms in the proportion of 
patients achieving at least a doubling of peripheral blood CD34+ count from the morning of the day 
preceding the apheresis day to the morning of the apheresis day.  
The secondary objectives of Stage 2 of this study were to confirm the efficacy and safety of plerixafor in 
paediatric cancer patients, and to compare the efficacy between the 2 treatment arms by examining the 
degree and rate of change of PB CD34+ counts, number of CD34+ cells collected by apheresis, 
percentage of patients proceeding to transplant, and percentage of transplanted patients with durable 
engraftment at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-transplantation. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was successful mobilization, defined as at least a doubling of the PB CD34+ 
count observed from the morning of the day preceding the first planned apheresis day to the morning 
prior to apheresis. 
The secondary efficacy variables in Stage 2 were comparisons between the 2 treatment arms in: 
Total CD34+ yield 
•  Number of days of apheresis required to reach ≥2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg 
•  CD34+ yield for each apheresis 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Percentage of patients proceeding to transplant 
Percentage of patients successfully engrafting 
Percentage of patients with durable engraftment at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-transplant. 
Variables for exploratory endpoints in Stage 2 included: 
•  CD34+ count transplanted (infused) 
• 
Percentage of patients with 2-fold increase in peripheral blood CD34+ AND reaching the study 
site-specific threshold level required to initiate apheresis 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Increase in peripheral blood CD34+ counts 
Total blood volume processed

Time to platelet engraftment (in days). 
No statistical testing was planned for the secondary efficacy endpoints. For every continuous secondary 
endpoint, a descriptive summary including mean, median, SD, minimum, and maximum, is provided. 
The safety of patients was assessed via monitoring of AEs, laboratory safety parameters, disease 
recurrence or progression, graft status (delayed engraftment or failure), tumour cell mobilization, 
secondary malignancies, survival status, hospitalization, incidence of fever and infections, and other 
safety parameters including physical examination and vital signs.

The duration of follow-up for safety evaluation was dependent on mobilization treatment and transplant 
status. All patients who underwent transplant(s) within 6 months after last study apheresis were to be 
evaluated for up to 24 months after the last transplant; otherwise patients were to be evaluated for up to 
24 months after last dose of study mobilization treatment (see also Figure 13). 
CD34+ cell counts 
Peripheral blood samples were to be analysed for CD34+ cell content by both local and central 
laboratories. Local laboratories provided data for clinical decisions during treatment. Central laboratory 
data were used in the primary analyses of efficacy. Data from the local laboratory were used for 
supportive analysis. The PB CD34+ counts measured each day and the absolute increase in PB CD34+ 
counts on the apheresis day from the day prior were summarized descriptively for each arm and by 
apheresis day. 
The product volume and the absolute number of CD34+ cells per unit volume were calculated. The total 
yield of CD34+ cells/kg was recorded prior to cryopreservation, and also after thawing, prior to infusion. 
The cumulative total CD34+ cells/kg yield was calculated by summing the CD34+ yield from each 
apheresis. 
Engraftment 
Data to determine engraftment included ANC and platelet count. The dates of engraftment were defined 
as below: 
•  Date of Neutrophil Engraftment: defined as the first day when the ANC was ≥0.5 × 109/L for 3 
consecutive laboratory values on 3 different days, or ≥1.0 ×109/L for 1 day. 
•  Date of Platelet Engraftment: defined as the first day when the platelet count was ≥20 × 109/L 
measured by at least 3 consecutive platelet laboratory values obtained over at least 7 days that 
show that level was achieved and maintained. The patient should not have had any platelet 
transfusions in the 7 days prior to the date selected for achieving ≥20 × 109/L, and the date 
should have been the first of 3 consecutive laboratory values tested on different days. 
Sample size 
The sample size was determined by the ability to recruit patients to the study, based on known numbers 
of autologous transplants carried out in paediatric cancer patients, diagnoses to be included in this study, 
and limiting participation to larger sites that have capability to achieve sufficient patient numbers within a 
reasonable amount of time. No formal statistics-based sample size calculations were performed. 
The full analysis set (FAS) comprised all patients randomized in Stage 2 according to the intent-to-treat 
principle. 
The per-protocol set (PP) was a subset of the full analysis set excluding patients who have major protocol 
deviations that significantly affect the assessment of efficacy. 
Also an Exploratory full analysis set was defined including patients treated with plerixafor in Stage 2 and 
9 patients treated at the 240 μg/kg dose level in Stage 1. 
Randomisation 
Patients were allocated to treatment using an automated interactive response system. At least 40 
patients in total were to be randomized.

Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study, so no blinding was needed. No formal statistics-based sample size 
calculations were performed. 
Statistical methods 
The sample size was determined by the ability to recruit patients to the study, based on known numbers 
of autologous transplants carried out in paediatric cancer patients, diagnoses to be included in this study, 
and limiting participation to larger sites that have capability to achieve sufficient patient numbers within a 
reasonable amount of time. No formal statistics-based sample size calculations were performed. 
The randomized population was to include any patient enrolled in Stage 2 of the study who had been 
allocated to a randomized treatment regardless of whether the treatment kit was used. 
Results 
Participant disposition for stage 2 
Forty- five (45) patients were randomized in Stage 2, 30 to receive plerixafor plus standard mobilization 
and 15 to receive standard mobilization alone. 
The majority of patients (35/45, 77.8%) completed the study period. Ten (10) patients discontinued the 
study prematurely (i.e. prior to completing the 24 month follow-up visit).

Recruitment 
In Stage 2 45 subjects were enrolled. Patients were enrolled in 12 countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and United Kingdom and Israel) 
in a total of 25 study centres. 
Conduct of the study 
There was 1 critical deviation impacting efficacy analysis. This deviation involved Patient 222008 in the 
standard mobilization arm, for whom both central and local laboratory PB CD34+ data from baseline were 
missing. It was therefore impossible to include this patient in the primary efficacy endpoint analysis. 
Other major deviations included:  
•  2 patients who were randomized before reaching the protocol defined trigger point of 7 CD34+ 
cells/μL, both in the standard mobilization arm. 
•  2 patients were reported to have persistent high percentage marrow involvement prior to 
mobilization, one in each arm. Both patients were included in the analysis.

Set 
Table 11 Number (%) of patients with baseline PB CD 34+ count (cells/μL) less than 10, 15, or 20 (as 
measured on the day prior to the day of apheresis) 
Using the definition of poor mobilizers as those patients with <20 cells/μL PB CD34+ cells on the day 
prior to the first apheresis, 21 of 30 patients (70.0%) in the plerixafor plus standard mobilization arm 
were poor mobilizers versus 5 of 15 patients (33.3%) in the standard mobilization alone arm.  
Using the definition of poor mobilizers as those patients with <15 cells/μL PB CD34+ cells on the day 
prior to the first apheresis, 13 of 30 patients (43.3%) in the plerixafor plus standard mobilization arm 
were poor mobilizers versus 3 of 15 patients (20.0%) in the standard mobilization alone arm. 
Also the median PB CD34+ count at baseline for patients in the plerixafor plus standard mobilization 
group were substantially lower than the median of PB CD34+ count for patients in the standard 
mobilization alone group (15 × 106 cells/L versus 35 × 106 cells/L). 
Exposure 
Patients in the plerixafor plus standard mobilization arm received a median of 1.00 dose administration of 
plerixafor (range: 1.0 – 3.0). Median total plerixafor dose level administered (per kg body weight) was 
240.0 μg/kg (range: 234.0 - 720.0 μg/kg). During Stage 2, 27 of 30 patients from the plerixafor arm 
received a single dose of plerixafor. Of the 3 remaining patients, 2 patients (Wilm’s tumor, 
neuroblastoma) received 2 doses of plerixafor and one patient (Ewing’s sarcoma) received 3 doses of 
plerixafor.

In Stage 2, median total G-CSF exposure (per kg body weight) was slightly lower in the plerixafor plus 
standard mobilization arm than in the standard mobilization alone arm (89.59 μg/kg versus 97.60 μg/kg) 
The percentage of patients who received chemotherapy as part of the standard mobilization regimen was 
lower in the plerixafor plus standard mobilization arm (23.3%) than in the standard mobilization alone

Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy analysis was performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was successful mobilization: The proportion of patients with successful 
mobilization was significantly greater in the plerixafor plus standard mobilization arm (80%, 24 of 30 
patients) compared to the standard mobilization only arm (28.6%, 4 of 14 patients) (p=0.0019) (see 
Table 11). Supportive analysis using local laboratory data showed successful mobilization in 27of 30 
patients (90%) in the plerixafor plus standard mobilization arm compared to 4 of 14 patients (28.6%)in 
the standard mobilization alone arm (p <0.0001) 
The rate of successful mobilization was similar across age and disease categories in the plerixafor plus 
standard mobilisation arm.

Secondary efficacy endpoints 
•  Number of days of apheresis required to reach ≥2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg  
The number of patients reaching the threshold of collecting ≥2 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg at first apheresis 
was 26 of 29 (89.7%) evaluated patients in the plerixafor plus standard mobilization arm and 13 of 14 
(92.9%) evaluated patients in the standard mobilization arm (see Table 12). The median number of 
apheresis days required to collect ≥ 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg was identical (1 day) in both treatment arms.  
One patient in the standard mobilization alone group and 3 patients in the plerixafor plus standard 
mobilization group failed to reach 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg by central laboratory assessment. For 3 of 
these patients local laboratory values were >2 × 106/kg.

Total CD34+ yield 
In case of missing result from central laboratory, the local laboratory result was used. 
The median total CD34+ cell yield was 10.15 × 106 cells/kg in the standard mobilization alone arm versus 
9.13 × 106 cells/kg in the plerixafor arm. 
The applicant states that this numerical difference in favour of the standard mobilization arm in terms of 
total cell yields was unexpected given the difference in mobilization (see primary endpoint). Therefore the 
Applicant has performed a post hoc exploratory analysis by analysing the increase of PB CD34+ count 
between the baseline and the next day prior to apheresis (see below).

Ancillary analyses 
For Stage 2, the number and percentage of patients with at least a doubling of the PB CD34+ count 
observed from the morning of the day preceding the first apheresis day to the morning prior to apheresis 
were estimated by subgroups for age (1 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 12 to <18 years), tumour type 
(Ewing’s sarcoma/soft tissue sarcoma, lymphoma, neuroblastoma, and other paediatric tumours including 
brain tumours), and marrow involvement at baseline (yes/no) (see Table 14). 
For each subgroup, the proportion of patients with at least a doubling of the PB CD34+ was numerically 
greater in the plerixafor plus standard mobilization arm compared to the standard mobilization alone arm 
based on central laboratory data, except for the subgroup of patients positive for marrow involvement in 
which 100% of patients (1 of 1 patient) in each arm had successful mobilization.

Supportive study(ies) 
The Applicant provided a literature review relating to the use of plerixafor as mobilizing agent in children 
who are candidates for high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) 
support. Only references with information on at least 3 patients were retained for this review. 
From 2011 to 2016, 16 publications reporting on 3 or more patients were identified. No randomized 
controlled trial was found in the published literature. Only few prospective uncontrolled experiences have 
been performed and most of the available data are retrospective analyses of case reports or are 
compassionate use programs that were initiated after plerixafor was first approved in the adult 
population. The publications encompass a total of 163 patients treated with at least 1 dose of plerixafor. 
The dose was 240 μg/kg with a few exceptions. In all publications but one, plerixafor was part of a 
mobilization protocol that included G-CSF ± chemo-mobilization. In the vast majority of the cases, 
plerixafor was administered to patients with a history of failed prior conventional PBSC mobilization with 
G-CSF ± chemotherapy, or a history of stem cell apheresis insufficient to proceed to transplant, or on 
rescue basis in the course of an inadequate mobilization attempt (insufficient PB CD34+ to proceed to 
apheresis). Successful harvest was achieved in 66.7% to 100% of the patients in all studies evaluating 
plerixafor combined with G-CSF ± chemo-mobilization as mobilisation protocol.  
The MAH has provided data from 2 publications of retrospective analysis of the 2 pivotal studies in adults 
by subgroups according to categories of baseline Day 4 CD34+ counts (study AMD 3101-3101 in NHL and 
study AMD3101-3102 in MM). 
The data regarding the fold increases between Day 4 pre-apheresis PB CD34+ count and at the day of 
apheresis is of particular interest. In both studies it is noted that while the fold-increase in PB CD34+ 
counts were of similar magnitude across the five Day 4 pre-apheresis PB CD34+ count subgroups in the 
control arm, these were higher in all subgroups in the plerixafor-treated arm, and in particular in the 
subgroup with the lowest Day 4 pre-apheresis PB CD34+ counts. A similar pattern is noted for cell yields. 
This suggest a larger efficacy of plerixafor in poor mobilizer adult patients. This is supported by the 
observation of fewer days of apheresis and a lower incidence of a second round of mobilization in the 
adult patients initially randomized to plerixafor.  
While paediatric data are more limited, and there is a skewing of patients with low Day 4 PB CD34 count 
in the plerixafor arm, a similar pattern in the fold-increase is suggested in study DFI12860. Also in this 
study the fold–increase in CD34 count seems rather independent of the Day 4 PB CD34 count in the 
control arm, while in the plerixafor arm there seems to be a tendency of numerically higher increase in 
subjects with lower Day 4 PB CD34 count. This similar PD effect between adults and paediatric patients 
suggest that also in children a greater efficacy of plerixafor can be expected in subjects with low PB 
CD34+ values on the day prior to apheresis.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies  
The clinical paediatric study DFI12860 (MOZ15609) consisted of an initial dose escalation study (Stage 1) 
followed by a randomized, comparative study extension (Stage 2) at the dose identified as most 
appropriate in the dose escalation part of the study. Stage 2 compared plerixafor administered in 
combination with standard mobilization, to standard mobilization alone. 
The study has been conducted in accordance with a PDCO agreed paediatric investigation plan. 
Overall, this development program included 72 paediatric patients aged 1 to <18 years with 57 patients 
treated with plerixafor plus standard mobilization (27 in Stage 1 and 30 Stage 2) and 15 treated with 
standard mobilization alone (Stage 2). 
The primary objective of stage 1 of the study was to determine the appropriate dose for stage 2. At Stage 
2 of the study, patients were randomized at a 2:1 ratio to receive plerixafor at the selected dose of 
240µg/kg plus standard mobilization or standard mobilization alone. The primary objective of the second 
stage of the study was to establish the difference between the 2 treatment arms in the proportion of 
patients achieving at least a doubling of peripheral blood CD34+ count for the morning of the day 
preceding the apheresis day to the morning of the apheresis day.  
Secondary endpoints included number of subjects reaching the threshold of ≥2x106 CD34+ cells/kg, 
number of days of apheresis required to reach ≥2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg, CD34+ yield for each apheresis, 
total CD34+ yield, percentage of patients proceeding to transplant, percentage of patients successfully 
engrafting and percentage of patients with durable engraftment at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-
transplant. The time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment are exploratory endpoints.  
No formal statistical hypothesis based sample size calculations were performed and except for the 
primary endpoint no statistical hypothesis testing was preformed, results are only descriptive.  
The primary endpoint reflects the anticipated pharmacodynamic effect of the plerixafor added to standard 
mobilisation, as it provides data on whether or not CD34+ cells can be mobilized by plerixafor. However, 
with this endpoint the clinical benefit of plerixafor treatment can not directly be determined, as it does 
not show that plerixafor treatment allows more patients to proceed to transplant. The percentage of 
patients who reach the threshold of ≥2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg, that proceed to transplant and who have 
successful engraftment are important secondary parameters as these reflect the intent of CD34+ 
mobilization, the collection of sufficient numbers of CD34+ cells to allow for successful stem cell 
transplantation. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are generally representative of the paediatric patient population who 
are in need of myeloablative high dose chemotherapy and thus of stem cell rescue. This population is 
different from the sought paediatric indication where subjects should also comply with one of two 
requirements intended to restrict the target population to those paediatric subjects who (are expected to) 
mobilise poorly. Importantly the proposed indication represents a population of poor mobilisers for which 
the addition of plerixafor to the standard mobilisation regime could address an unmet medical need. The 
PIP was agreed before the marketing authorisation was granted, without requiring a restriction in the 
study to the paediatric population of poor mobilisers. However, the sensitivity to determine a difference 
between control and active treatment in clinically relevant endpoints (e.g. achieving sufficient CD34+ 
cells for transplant) may be reduced due to the inclusion of normal (non-poor) mobilising subjects in the 
studied population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/243012/2019 
Page 52/73 
 
  
 
In the study, 4 subjects were aged between 1 and 2 years, 3 subjects received standard mobilisation 
alone, and 1 received plerixafor + standard mobilisation. This indicates that there is a need for 
autologous SCT in this age category. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A statistically significant difference is seen between the stage 2 study arms in the primary endpoint point: 
proportion of patients with successful mobilization. Doubling of the PB CD34+ count from the morning 
before the apheresis day to the morning of the apheresis day was reported for 80% of the patients in the 
plerixafor plus standard mobilisation arm and in 28.6% of the patients in the standard mobilisation arm 
(p<0.0019). 
Regarding the clinically relevant endpoints, no clear difference was noted between the study arms. The 
number of patients reaching the threshold of collecting ≥2 x 106 CD34+ cell/kg was comparable between 
the treatment groups (89.7% vs 92.9% for plerixafor plus standard mobilisation and standard 
mobilisation respectively). For both treatment groups the median number of apheresis days needed to 
collect the threshold number of cells was 1 day. While the percentage of patients who proceeded to 
transplant was higher for the plerixafor plus standard mobilisation arm than for the control arm (76.7% 
vs 66.7%, respectively), no difference was noted in the reasons for not proceeding to HSCT. Insufficient 
stem cell harvest was reported for only 1 subject, in the plerixafor arm. 
For both treatment arms, all patients who were transplanted successfully engrafted, and the percentages 
of patients with engraftment after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, were comparable. Only minor differences 
occurred in time to neutrophil engraftment (12 vs 14 day, plerixafor plus standard mobilisation vs 
standard mobilisation) and time to platelet engraftment (28 vs 23 days, plerixafor plus standard 
mobilisation vs standard mobilisation). 
The total amount of CD34+ cells yield was slightly lower for the plerixafor plus standard mobilisation arm 
than for the control arm (9.13 x 106 cells/kg vs 10.15 x106 cells/kg, respectively), which may, in part, be 
explained by the slightly lower blood volume which was processed in the plerixafor plus standard 
mobilisation than for the control arm (3.0 L vs 3.75L, respectively. Also the small differences in the 
percentage of patients who received chemotherapy as part of the standard mobilization regimen (23.3% 
vs 33.3% plerixafor vs control), and the median total GCSF dose (89.59 µg/kg vs 97.60 µg/kg, plerixafor 
vs control) between the study arms may have contributed to this imbalance.  
Importantly, the median amount of CD34+ cells at baseline was significantly lower (15 x 106 cells/ ml vs 
35 x 106 cells/ml) in the plerixafor plus standard mobilisation arm. Thus the absolute increase in PB 
CD34+ count (also needed to reach the relatively similar CD34+ yield) was higher in the plerixafor plus 
standard mobilisation arm. Also the relative increase in PB CD34+ counts was higher in the plerixafor plus 
standard mobilisation arm (+220% vs +39%). 
The results of the efficacy endpoints demonstrate the pharmacodynamic effect of plerixafor added to a 
standard mobilisation regime in the paediatric population: an additional increase (absolute and relative) 
in the amount of circulating CD34+ cells at the day of apheresis when compared to a standard 
mobilisation regime (G-CSF +/- chemotherapy) alone, taking the day before apheresis as baseline. This 
pharmacodynamic effect is the first step needed for proof of clinical benefit. Unfortunately, of the 
secondary endpoints reflecting a clinical goal of treatment and thus benefit only the percentage of 
patients proceeding to transplant, shows a positive trend. This lack of benefit in clinically relevant 
parameters might be due to the limited number of paediatric patients included in the study and the fact 
that the studied population was relatively insensitive for demonstrating a clinical difference as inclusion 
was not restricted to patients who were poor mobilizers and therefore in need of plerixafor addition above 
standard mobilisation therapy.

EMA/243012/2019 
Page 53/73 
 
  
 
Overall, the data from the paediatric study alone is insufficient to support an extension of indication due 
to the lack of benefit on clinically relevant parameters in the studied population. To compensate for this, 
an extrapolation approach was taken building on the established clinical benefit in poor mobilising adults 
by comparing the effects seen in adults to those in the paediatric population. Both in adults and in 
children a similar pattern is noted in the fold increase in PB CD34+ count between Day 4 /pre-apheresis 
day and at the day of apheresis suggesting a greater treatment effect of plerixafor in potentially poor 
mobilizing population (based on low CD34+ PB count day4/pre-apheresis) both in adults and in children. 
A similar effect is noted for cell yields. This suggest a larger effect of plerixafor in poor mobilizers. 
Further, it is noted that of the subjects in the paediatric study with PB CD34+ count below <20/μL, 1 of 4 
control subjects had > 4-fold increase in CD34+ counts on the day of apheresis, while in the plerixafor 
arm, 9 of 17 subjects had > 4-fold increase in CD34+ counts on the day of apheresis. This also suggests 
benefit of plerixafor treatment in (potential) low mobilising subjects.  
The similarity in the relationship between the PD response (fold increase) and pre-apheresis PB CD34+ 
count between adults and paediatric patients, and the established efficacy in the adult population 
together with the difference in frequency of potentially poor mobilising subjects with strong increase (>4 
fold) in CD34+ counts between control and plerixafor-treated subjects in the paediatric study provide 
sufficient support for adding plerixafor to the standard mobilization in children who are (expected to) 
mobilise poorly.  
The need for a lower age cut off has been discussed with the Applicant during the procedure. Data on the 
effect of plerixafor in children below the age of 2 is limited to 1 subject. In this patient, a > 6 fold 
increase in PB CD34+ cells from Day 4 to Day 5 PB CD34+ counts was noted (6.2 by central assessment 
and 7.1 by local assessment). This high increase suggests that plerixafor was active in this infant (13 
months, 8.9 kg). Thus the available (but very limited) data do not suggest that the potential lower 
exposure in children aged < 2 years is clinically relevant. Given this observation the age restriction to 1 
year and older as no data are available in subjects below the age of 1 year was endorsed. While an 
extrapolation approach could be envisaged allowing to remove a lower age limit from the indication, the 1 
year cut off is accepted in view of lack of data. 
The Applicant has discussed the complexities of defining a poor mobiliser among adults and infants. As 
mobilisation failure is multifactorial, no single parameter with a clear cut off can be identified that can 
accurately discriminate between subjects who are expected to fail mobilization and those who are not. It 
is also acknowledged that there may be institutional/national differences in algorithms to guide 
optimization of mobilization. As such it is agreed that specifying a specific threshold triggering pre-
emptive use of plerixafor is not the best option.  
The final agreed indication is considered to better capture the intent of pre-emptive plerixafor treatment 
than the initially proposed text, namely to target those subjects who are at likely to/at high risk for 
mobilisation failure, that is insufficient mobilisation to allow for collection of sufficient number of CD34+ 
stem cells to allow for autologous stem cell transplantation. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, it is considered that with the currently provided analyses, focussing on the potentially low 
mobilising subjects (based on pre-apheresis PB CD34+ counts), a clinically relevant effect of plerixafor 
treatment in children (1 to less than 18 years) who are expected to mobilise poorly is sufficiently 
supported.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In adults Mozobil treatment has been associated with injection and infusion site reactions, including 
allergic and anaphylactic reactions, gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal 
pain, stomach discomfort, dyspepsia, abdominal distention, constipation, flatulence, hypoaesthesia oral, 
dry mouth), fatigue, malaise, insomnia, hyperhidrosis, erythema, arthralgia, and musculoskeletal pain. 
Furthermore, specific warnings in the SmPC include potential for tumour cell mobilization in leukaemia 
patients, increased circulating leukocytes and decreased platelet counts, and splenic enlargement. 
The clinical study (DFI12860) is provided for this application, consisting of 2 stages: Stage 1 a dose-
escalation study and stage 2 an open-label, comparative study. For further description of the study, see 
clinical efficacy section. 
For safety assessment 3 safety populations can be defined:  
•  Safety set for Stage 1 (defined as all patients who received at least one dose of plerixafor in 
Stage 1) 
• 
• 
The safety set for Stage 2 (defined as all randomized patients who received at least one study 
dose (either plerixafor or standard mobilization) in Stage 2). 
The overall safety set; combining plerixafor patients treated in Stage 1 and Stage 2. 
All AEs, regardless of causality, were collected from the time the patient signed the Informed Consent 
Form until 30 days after the last dose of the patient’s mobilization regimen or until the first dose of their 
next anticancer therapy or myeloablative therapy for transplant, whichever occurred first. From the first 
dose of marrow ablative chemotherapy until the last follow-up visit, only serious adverse events (SAEs) 
considered by the Investigator to be related to study treatment were recorded.  
The primary focus of AE reporting was on TEAEs. Pretreatment and post-apheresis AEs were described 
separately. 
The duration of follow-up for safety evaluation was dependent on mobilization treatment and transplant 
status. All patients who underwent transplant(s) within 6 months after last study apheresis were to be 
evaluated for up to 24 months after the last transplant; otherwise patients were to be evaluated for up to 
24 months after last dose of study mobilization treatment (see Figure 11). During the 24-month post-
transplant period (i.e., 24 months after the last planned transplant performed in the 6 month period after 
last study apheresis), disease recurrence or progression, graft failure, and Grade 3 or higher infections 
were recorded as SAEs. 
Disease recurrence or progression were to be recorded as SAEs. Data recorded on graft status was to 
include delayed platelet engraftment and graft failure; if applicable, primary and secondary graft failure 
was to be reported as an SAE. 
Other events that were to be recorded included tumour cell mobilization (to be evaluated by assessment 
of samples for the presence of tumour cells in peripheral blood), second malignancies (as opposed to 
relapse or recurrence) and hospitalisation (both initial hospitalization for mobilization and apheresis, as 
well as other periods of hospitalization throughout the duration of the study).  
Patient exposure and baseline characteristics 
Among the 27 patients in Stage 1, and the 45 randomized patients in Stage 2 all received at least one 
dose of study treatment and were therefore included in respective the safety populations.  
Assessment report  
EMA/243012/2019 
Page 55/73 
 
  
 
There was an imbalance in the standard mobilisation treatment between the study arms: the percentage 
of patients who received chemotherapy as part of the standard mobilization regimen (23.3% vs 33.3%) 
and the median total GCSF dose (89.59 µg/kg vs 97.60 µg/kg) were slightly lower in the plerixafor plus 
standard mobilisation arm when compared to standard mobilisation alone.  
More information on received doses and baseline characteristics, is provided in the efficacy section. 
Adverse events 
Frequency 
During Stage 1, TEAEs were reported in 59% of patients, with TEAEs assessed by the investigator as 
related to study treatment reported in only 1 patient. TEAEs of Grade 3-4 were recorded for 8 patients 
(30%). The only Grade 3/4 TEAEs reported in 2 or more patients were febrile neutropenia (2 patients 
with Grade 3 and 1 patient with Grade 4 TEAEs) and pancytopenia (1 patient with Grade 3 and 1 patient 
with Grade 4 TEAEs) 
During stage 2, TEAEs were reported in 77% of patients in the plerixafor plus standard mobilization arm 
and 67% patients in the standard mobilization only arm. Treatment–emergent AEs assessed by the 
investigator as related to study procedure were reported more frequently in the plerixafor plus standard 
mobilization arm than in the standard mobilization alone arm (43.3% versus 40.0%, respectively). 
Treatment–emergent AEs assessed by the investigator as related to study treatment were reported in 4 
(13.3%) patients in the plerixafor plus standard mobilization arm and none in the standard mobilization 
alone arm. The events reported were mild (Grade 1 in severity) included injection site reactions (2 
patients, 6.7%), and hypokalaemia and blood bicarbonate increased (1 patient each, 3.3%). These were 
considered consistent with the known safety profile of plerixafor.

Table 20 Overview of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) (Safety Set for Stage 2) 
AE profile 
During stage 1, the most common TEAEs reported by > 15% of patients were: vomiting (5 patients), 
anaemia (4 patients), febrile neutropenia (4 patients) and pyrexia (4 patients). 1 patient had 2 TEAEs 
(abdominal pain and vomiting) assessed by the investigator as related to study treatment. 
The only Grade 3-4 TEAEs reported in 2 or more patients were febrile neutropenia (2 patients with Grade 
3 and 1 patient with Grade 4 TEAEs) and pancytopenia (1 patient with Grade 3 and 1 patient with Grade 
4 TEAEs). 
During stage 2, the most common TEAEs reported by ≥10% of patients in the plerixafor plus standard 
mobilization arm were anaemia, platelet count decreased, rhinitis, febrile neutropenia, 
hypoalbuminaemia, diarrhoea, vomiting, and pyrexia. The most common Grade 3 or higher TEAEs 
reported by ≥10% of patients were anaemia, platelet count decreased, and febrile neutropenia in the 
plerixafor plus standard mobilization arm. 
In the standard mobilization alone arm, the most common TEAEs reported by >10% of patients were 
hypokalaemia, alanine aminotransferase increased, febrile neutropenia, vomiting, platelet count

decreased, fatigue, nausea, and anaemia. The most common Grade 3 or higher TEAEs reported by ≥10% 
of patients were anaemia, febrile neutropenia, hypokalaemia, and platelet count decreased in the 
standard mobilization alone arm. 
No major difference in occurrence of any type of AEs was observed between the study arms (see Table 
17). 
Treatment-related TEAE included injection site reactions (2 patients, 6.7%), and hypokalaemia and blood 
bicarbonate increased (1 patient each, 3.3%). All TEAEs considered related to study treatment were mild.

and PT, safety set for stage 2 
During the post-apheresis period, AEs were reported in 18 (60.0%) patients in the plerixafor plus 
standard mobilization arm and 9 (60.0%) patients in the standard mobilization alone arm. The most 
frequently reported post-apheresis AEs (by PT) in both the plerixafor plus standard mobilization arm and 
the standard mobilization alone arm were disease progression (2 patients, 6.7% and 4 patients, 26.7%, 
respectively), febrile neutropenia (6 patients, 20.0% and 2 patients, 13.3%, respectively) and 
neuroblastoma recurrent (4 patients, 13.3% and 2 patients, 13.3%, respectively).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No deaths occurred within 30 days of the last study treatment in either stage of the study. 
During the post-treatment follow-up period, 5 patients died in stage 1 of the study, 3 due to disease 
progression. In stage 2, 6 patients died (3 in each treatment arm), all deaths were due to disease 
progression.  
Survival rates post-transplant were reported for stage 2 (see Table 18).

Safety Set for Stage 2 
Serious TEAEs  
In stage 1, serious TEAEs were reported in 9 (33%) patients, none assessed by the Investigator as 
related to study treatment (see Table 19).  
In stage 2, serious TEAEs were reported in 9 (30.0%) patients in the plerixafor plus standard mobilization 
arm and in 4 (26.7%) patients in the standard mobilization alone arm, none were assessed by the 
Investigator as related to study treatment (see Table 20). Treatment-emergent SAEs reported for 
patients in the plerixafor treatment plus standard mobilization arm included febrile neutropenia, (3 
patients [10%]) pancytopenia and pyrexia (2 patients [6.7%] each), and hydrocephalus and bone 
marrow failure (1 patient [3.3%] each).  
Serious AEs reported post-apheresis in the plerixafor plus standard mobilization arm were reported in 7 
patient (device-related infection [2], appendicitis, clostridial sepsis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract 
infection, and urinary tract infection). Neoplastic recurrence and disease progression occurred in 2 + 4 
subjects in the standard mobilization alone arm, and 7 + 2 subjects in the plerixafor plus standard 
mobilization arm. No primary or secondary graft failures were reported in the standard mobilization arm 
alone. In the plerixafor plus standard mobilization arm primary graft failure was reported in 1 (4.3%) 
patient and 1 secondary graft failure was also reported in this arm (was considered secondary due to 
missing data on platelet engraftment).

•  Relapse rate: The post-transplant relapse rate (95% CI) for patients who received transplant 
within 6 months of last study apheresis was similar in the plerixafor plus standard mobilization 
arm and the standard mobilization alone. 
•  Unplanned hospitalizations due to AEs were reported in 10 (76.9%) patients of the standard 
mobilization arm only and in 17 (63.0%) patients of the plerixafor plus standard mobilization arm. 
Other unplanned hospitalizations (at any time during the study) were reported in 6 (46.2%) 
patients of the standard mobilization arm only and in 15 (55.6%) patients of the plerixafor plus 
standard mobilization arm. 
• 
Tumour cell mobilisation: Blood samples (2 mL per sample) were to be collected on the day 
preceding the first apheresis day and prior to G-CSF administration on the first apheresis day 
itself, as well as in apheresis product prior to cryopreservation in patients with neuroblastoma, 
Ewing’s sarcoma and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase 
polymerase chain reaction technology using tumor type-specific mRNA was used for tumour cell 
detection.

negative for tumour cell RNA. In Stage 2, target messenger RNA (mRNA) was detected at low 
levels in 1 of 61 PB and 5 of 37 apheresis samples successfully analysed. Positive samples were 
collected from 3 patients in the standard mobilization only arm, and 1 patient in the plerixafor 
plus standard mobilization arm.

Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
The database was queried for events potentially meeting criteria for the following AESI 
• 
Pregnancy occurring in a female patient included in the clinical trial 
•  Vasovagal reaction: Orthostatic hypotension, syncope, bradycardia 
•  Systemic allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction and anaphylactic shock 
•  Overdose of IMP/NIMP 
•  Symptomatic leukocytosis. 
Three TEAEs resulted from this search: 1 patient had an event of Grade 3 urticaria and Grade 1 allergic 
transfusion reaction associated with platelet transfusion. One patient experienced Grade 3 stomatitis. All 
3 events were assessed by the Investigators as not related to study treatment

Laboratory findings 
Serum chemistry (sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, blood urea nitrogen, bicarbonate, creatinine, 
ALT/SGPT, AST/SGOT, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, glucose, phosphate, 
and magnesium) and haematology (Complete blood count (CBC) with differential was to be evaluated in 
peripheral blood samples, and was to include platelets, haematocrit, haemoglobin, red blood cells, and 
WBCs with differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils) were to be assessed 
by the site’s local laboratory at the study visits. 
In stage 1 no clinically meaningful variations were noted between baseline and the day following 
apheresis for liver function tests, plasma creatinine, and electrolytes. 
In each of the 3 age categories neutrophils increased and platelets decreased while RBC indices did not 
change appreciably between baseline and the day following apheresis. 
In stage 2, abnormalities in liver and renal function indices reported were similar between treatment 
arms, electrolyte abnormalities were uncommon. The effect on haematology in stage 3 is shown in Table 
23.

Post marketing experience 
The cumulative analysis to summarize the AEs collected from solicited and unsolicited reporting and 
reported in Sanofi global pharmacovigilance database, Application for Worldwide Adverse Event Reporting 
and Evaluation (AWARE) are presented below. The data were retrieved cumulatively until 06 June 2017 
(the time of the data cut off) for all cases occurring in patients under age 18 (paediatric use). 
A total of 270 AEs were collected cumulatively in the safety database as of the cut-off date (06 June 
2017), with the majority (219 AEs) reported as serious. Due to one duplicate case with 1 SAE reported, 
the total number of AEs and SAEs were 269 and 218 respectively. The events are summarised (by SOC) 
in Table 24. 
One study reported a cluster of 4 cases of serious visual hallucinations and nightmares in children 25-58 
months of age (Son et al, 2013). After the cumulative analysis of all cases retrieved from the safety 
database, the MAH concluded that the cumulative weighted evidence support a causal association 
between plerixafor and the onset of abnormal dreams and nightmares. The product information was 
updated accordingly.  
Table 28 Overall adverse events summarized by system organ class (SOC) collected post-marketing 
In summary, the overall profiles of the AEs reported in the safety database were consistent with the 
reference safety information of plerixafor. No any new or different safety issue identified. 
Also a review of literature relating to the use of plerixafor as mobilizing agent in children who are 
candidates for high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) support 
was conducted. For description of literature database, see efficacy section.

From 2011 to 2016, 16 publications reporting on 3 or more patients were identified (for further 
description see efficacy section). No appreciable side effects associated with administration of plerixafor 
were reported in most of these 16 publications. Most of the reported toxicities have been already 
documented as possibly associated with plerixafor in adults. One publication (Son et al, 2013) reported 
nightmares, nyctophobia, and visual hallucinations in 4 out of the 6 patients treated with G-CSF and 
plerixafor. These events resolved within one week, although, visual hallucinations persisted about one 
month in one patient. These 4 patients received 3 to 10 doses of plerixafor. As possible explanation for 
these psychological adverse events, the authors hypothesized on a possible difference in CXCR4 
expression in the brain tissues and/or a difference in the degree of neuronal dysregulation by plerixafor 
between adults and young children. Sevilla at al. (2012), also reported 1 patient out of 8 who 
experienced anxiety and nightmares following administration of plerixafor. The report by Son et al (2013) 
has been previously discussed as included in post marketing pharmacovigilance activities and has led to 
an update of the product information.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of plerixafor added to a standard mobilisation regime in the paediatric population has been 
studied in clinical study DFI12860, consisting of 2 stages: Stage 1 a dose-escalation study and stage 2 an 
open-label, comparative study. The collection and reporting of the AEs during this study is sufficient to 
allow for a general impression of the effect of adding plerixafor to a standard mobilisation regime in 
children and for a high-level comparison of the safety profile between adults and children.  
Among the 27 patients in Stage 1, and the 45 randomized patients in Stage 2 all received at least one 
dose of study treatment and were therefore included in respective the safety populations. Due to the 
restricted sample size in children potential small differences in frequencies or uncommon new AEs could 
not be captured. However this can be accepted as more extensive safety data has been obtained in 
adults, and the mechanism of action of plerixafor is expected to be similar between children and adults. 
TEAEs were reported in 59% of patients in stage 1 subjects with TEAEs of Grade 3-4 recorded for 8 
patients (30%). In stage 2 TEAEs were reported in 77% of patients in the plerixafor plus standard 
mobilization arm and 67% patients in the standard mobilization only arm. Grade 3-4 recorded TEAEs 
were recorded in 40 respectively 43% of subjects. Treatment–emergent AEs assessed by the investigator 
as related to study treatment were reported in 1 subject during stage 1, and during stage 2 in 4 (13.3%) 
patients in the plerixafor plus standard mobilization arm and none in the standard mobilization alone arm. 
The observed adverse events in paediatric population are consistent with the known safety profile of 
plerixafor in adults. 
In stage 2, the frequencies of TEAEs and TEAEs related to study treatment were higher in the plerixafor 
plus standard mobilisation arm when compared to the standard mobilisation arm alone. However this is 
not unexpected for an add-on therapy and differences were modest.  
Overall, during both stages of the study, no unexpected AEs, SEAs, AE of special interest were noted in 
the plerixafor + standard mobilisation arm, and the observed events are consistent with the known safety 
profile of plerixafor in adults. Data on survival, relapse rate, hospitalisations and tumour cell mobilisation 
also do not point toward any unexpected safety concerns, and no obvious differences were noted between 
the two treatment arms in stage 2 of the study. The observed effect on haematology parameters (i.e. 
increase neutrophils, decrease platelets) are in line with the intended effects of CD34+ mobilization, with 
again no major differences between the study arms. 
Review of the post marketing experience and of literature on the use of plerixafor in the paediatric patient 
population also did not reveal new safety signals which have not been discussed previously with the 
Applicant during post marketing pharmacovigilance activities.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall it can be concluded that the safety profile of plerixafor added to standard mobilisation is 
consistent to what has been reported previously, and that no new safety concerns have been identified. 
Notably, due to the restricted sample size in this study the sensitivity to detect potential small differences 
in frequencies or uncommon new AEs is limited. 
Long-term safety (patients >1 year) should be followed up in the PSURs as a safety concern to be further 
monitored and characterized over time. 
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Significance of paediatric studies 
The CHMP is of the opinion that DFI12860, which is contained in the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan

3.1.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
 The changes to the RMP and the changes to the conditions and obligations of the MA are acceptable. 
4.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a consequence of this variation, section 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC are updated. The 
Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
4.1.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: the present 
application for a new paediatric indication of Mozobil does not bring any significant change to Patient 
Information Leaflet tested for Mozobil 20 mg/ml solution for injection. Therefore, no additional Readability 
testing was performed.

5.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
5.1.  Therapeutic Context 
5.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) to treat malignant disorders suffer from severe and 
potentially fatal myeloablation. Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using 
mobilized peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) collected by apheresis is a common strategy 
for repopulation of the bone marrow and regeneration of trilineage blood cells (red blood cells, platelets, 
neutrophils). To yield a sufficient number of stem cells for apheresis, HSCs are increased in the peripheral 
blood by treating patients with G-CSF and/or with non-myeloablative chemotherapy. However, a 
significant proportion of patients may not be able to mobilize a sufficient or target number of cells for 
transplantation(s) with these HSC mobilization regimens, the so-called poor mobilisers. 
5.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently, Mozobil is approved as for treatment for adult patients who are poor mobilisers in conjunction 
with G-CSF. Plerixafor (Mozobil) is a small-molecule bicyclam derivative that reversibly antagonizes the 
CXCR4 chemokine receptor and blocks binding of its cognate ligand, stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-
1α, also known as CXCL12). This interruption of the CXCR4/SDF-1α interaction results in mobilization of 
HSCs positive for cell surface glycoprotein CD34 (CD34+ cells) to the peripheral blood where they can be 
collected for HSC transplantation.  
There are no clear alternatives to plerixafor, since higher G-CSF and another chemotherapy cannot 
quickly be used when CD34+ turnout is low. 
In this application, Mozobil in paediatric patients (1 to less than 18 years) is indicated in combination with 
G-CSF to enhance mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells to the peripheral blood for collection and 
subsequent autologous transplantation in children with a lymphoma or a solid malignant tumour, either: 
- 
pre-emptively, when circulating stem cell count on the predicted day of collection after adequate 
mobilization with G-CSF (with or without chemotherapy) is expected to be insufficient with 
regards to desired hematopoietic stem cells yield, or 
-  who previously failed to collect sufficient haematopoietic stem cells. 
This indication is considered to better capture the intent of pre-emptive plerixafor treatment that the 
initially proposed text, namely to target those subjects who are at likely to/at high risk for mobilisation 
failure, that is insufficient mobilisation to allow for collection of sufficient number of CD34+ stem cells to 
allow for autologous stem cell transplantation. Indeed, these are the subjects with the highest unmet 
medical need, as poor mobilisation may result in a failure to collect a sufficient number of CD34+ stem 
cells needed for HSCT. These poor mobilising patients may be offered a second round of stem cell 
mobilization and stem cell collection requiring additional mobilisation therapy and inpatient admission. In 
case patients are then still poorly mobilising,  patients are at high risk of failure to obtain sufficient 
number of stem cells. These patients may as a consequence become  ineligible for an autologous 
transplant procedure and thus cannot receive the high dose chemotherapy (HDC) because the absence of 
stem cell rescue. This may negatively impact their survival, or alternatively they may have to undergo 
allogeneic transplantation which is a more complex procedure with higher morbidity. While Mozobil has 
been registered for poor mobilising adults, there is still a need for an additional mobilisation treatment 
option for paediatric patients in need of HDC, in particular those who are (at high risk to be) poor 
mobilisers. This to increase mobilisation of stem cell and thereby ensure collection of sufficient number of 
Assessment report  
EMA/243012/2019 
Page 68/73 
 
  
 
stem cells which would allow these patients to proceed to potentially life-saving HDC therapy because of 
the availability of subsequent stem cell rescue.  
5.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The study supporting this extension of the indication encompassed a dose-escalation phase (Stage 1) and 
a randomisation phase (Stage 2) comparing plerixafor at the dose selected in Stage 1 plus standard 
mobilization to standard mobilization alone. This study design was discussed and agreed to by the PDCO. 
As the mechanism of action of plerixafor and the expression of CXCR4 and SDF-1 is similar between 
children and adults, a similar response in children as in adults is to be expected. However, direct 
extrapolation of adult efficacy data based on pharmacokinetics only was not possible as there may be 
differences in PK/PD between adults and children. This issue was addressed in Stage 1 of the study. 
Furthermore, as the underlying malignancies requiring HDC is different between the adult and paediatric 
population, the chemotherapy regimen is also likely to be different between adults and children. This 
concerns both the chemotherapy administered before HSC collection and the HDC regimes for which HCS 
rescue is needed. In principle, these differences might affect the response of the subject to mobilisation 
regimen as well as the marrow recovery and ability for HSC engraftment. This issue was addressed in 
Stage 2 of the study.  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are generally representative of the paediatric patient population who 
are in need of myeloablative HDC and thus stem cell rescue. However, there was no requirement for the 
subjects in the study to be (expected to be) a poor mobiliser. As a consequence, the studied population 
may have been insensitive for differences in the more clinically relevant endpoints (stem cell yield 
sufficient for transplantation, transplantation rate, etc.). The study design is in accordance with the 
agreed PIP (EMEA-000174-PIP01-07) with appropriate endpoints to collect the pharmacodynamic effect 
(primary endpoint) and potential clinically relevant effects (secondary endpoints) of adding plerixafor to 
standard mobilisation regime. The conduct of the study was of sufficient standard. 
5.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint of Stage 2 was met: the proportion of patients with successful mobilization, defined 
as doubling of the PB CD34+ count from the morning before the apheresis day to the morning of the 
apheresis day, was significantly greater in the plerixafor plus standard mobilization arm (80%, 24 of 30 
patients) compared to the standard mobilization only arm (28.6%, 4 of 14 patients) (p=0.0019). The 
results of the primary (pharmacodynamic) endpoint were supported by the other secondary/exploratory 
pharmacodynamic parameters. 
Results for the clinically relevant endpoints in the plerixafor plus standard mobilisation group in stage 2 
were good: 26 of 29 (89.7%) of evaluated patients reached the threshold of collecting ≥2 × 106 CD34+ 
cells/kg at first apheresis in the plerixafor plus standard mobilization. The rate of successful mobilization 
was similar across age and disease categories in the plerixafor plus standard mobilisation arm. 
The percentage of patients who proceeded to transplant was 76.7% in the plerixafor plus standard 
mobilization, which was higher than that seen in the control arm where 66.7% of patients proceeded to 
transplant. All patients who were transplanted (23 in the plerixafor plus standard mobilization arm and 10 
in the standard mobilization arm) successfully engrafted. Only minor differences in time to neutrophil 
engraftment (12 vs 14 day, for respectively plerixafor plus standard mobilisation vs standard mobilisation 
only) and time to platelet engraftment (28 vs 23 days, for respectively plerixafor plus standard 
mobilisation vs standard mobilisation only)  were noted with overlapping 95% confidence intervals. Thus 
plerixafor exposure did not seem to negatively impact transplant efficiency.

EMA/243012/2019 
Page 69/73 
 
  
 
A similar pattern in PD parameters was noted between adults and the paediatric population, this 
particularly concerns the effect of plerixafor on fold-increase in PB CD34+ count between Day 4 /pre-
apheresis day and at the day of apheresis and the stem cell yield. The response to treatment of these 
parameters suggest a greater treatment effect of plerixafor in potentially poor mobilizing population. 
Of the subjects in the paediatric study with PB CD34+ count below <20/μL (a risk factor for poor 
mobilisation), 1 of 4 control subjects had > 4 fold increase in CD34+ counts on the day of apheresis, 
while in the plerixafor arm, 9 of 17 subjects had > 4 fold increase in CD34+ counts on the day of 
apheresis. This also suggests efficacy of plerixafor treatment in (potential) low mobilising subjects in the 
paediatric population. 
One subject < 2 years of age was randomised to the plerixafor + standard mobilisation arm, a high 
increase CD34+ cells from Day 4 to Day 5 PB CD34+ counts was noted in this subject (> 6 fold), 
suggesting that plerixafor was active in this small infant (13 months, 8.9 kg). 
5.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There were no uncertainties about the favourable effects. 
5.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In adults plerixafor treatment has been associated with injection and infusion site reactions, including 
allergic and anaphylactic reactions, gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal 
pain, stomach discomfort, dyspepsia, abdominal distention, constipation, flatulence, hypoaesthesia oral, 
dry mouth), fatigue, malaise, insomnia, hyperhidrosis, erythema, arthralgia, and musculoskeletal pain. 
Furthermore, specific warnings in the product information include potential for tumour cell mobilization in 
leukaemia patients, increased circulating leukocytes and decreased platelet counts, and splenic 
enlargement. 
TEAEs were reported in 59% of paediatric patients in stage 1 subjects with TEAEs of Grade 3-4 recorded 
for 8 patients (30%). In stage 2 TEAEs were reported in 77% of paediatric patients in the plerixafor plus 
standard mobilization arm and 67% patients in the standard mobilization only arm. Grade 3-4 recorded 
TEAEs were recorded in 40% versus 43% of subjects. 
Treatment–emergent AEs assessed by the investigator as related to study treatment were reported in 1 
subject during stage 1, and during stage 2 in 4 (13.3%) patients in the plerixafor plus standard 
mobilization arm and none in the standard mobilization alone arm. 
The observed adverse events in paediatric population were consistent with the known safety profile of 
plerixafor in adults. 
5.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Due to the limited sample size in children potential small differences in frequencies or uncommon new 
AEs will not be captured.

5.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
5.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Overall, the data from the paediatric study taken together with an extrapolation approach building on the 
established clinical benefit in poor mobilising adults by comparing the effects seen in adults to those in 
the paediatric population are sufficient to support a paediatric indication. The similarity in the relationship 
between the PD response (fold increase) and pre-apheresis PB CD34+ count between adults and 
paediatric patients, and the established efficacy in the adult population is supportive of this extrapolation 
approach. The higher frequency of potentially poor mobilising subjects with a strong increase (>4 fold) in 
CD34+ counts in plerixafor-treated subjects in the paediatric study further supports the claim of efficacy. 
Together, this sufficiently supports the benefit of the addition of plerixafor to the standard mobilization for 
children who (are expected to) mobilise poorly. 
Regarding the unfavourable effects, it is important to note that the observed safety profile in the 
paediatric population is consistent with that in adults, and that no new safety signals have been observed. 
Moreover, plerixafor exposure did not seem to negatively impact transplant efficiency.  
Data on the effect of plerixafor in the age group <2 years is limited to 1 subject. A high increase in PB 
CD34+ cells following treatment was noted suggesting that plerixafor was active in this small infant (13 
months, 8.9 kg). Thus the available (but very limited) data do not suggest that the potential lower 
exposure in children aged < 2 years is clinically relevant. Given this observation, the final indication is 
defined in children above 1 years old.    
5.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, it is considered that the provided PD and clinical data, focussing on the potentially low mobilising 
subjects (based on pre-apheresis PB CD34+ counts) and on similarities between adults and children in 
combination with the known mechanism of action of plerixafor, are sufficient to support the claim of a 
clinical relevant effect of plerixafor treatment in children who (are expected to) mobilise poorly. This 
effect of plerixafor is expected to reduce the risk of insufficient stem cell harvest and thereby of the need 
to undergo an additional round of stem cell mobilisation and apheresis or bone marrow harvest in order 
to collect sufficient stem cell numbers to proceed to potentially life-saving HSCT. Further, though limited 
data are available, based on the current results no major safety concerns have been identified and the 
overall safety profile is deemed acceptable also for the paediatric population. Therefore, it is considered 
that the benefit-risk balance of adding plerixafor to standard mobilisation for patients who (are expected 
to) mobilise poorly is positive. Overall, the currently presented data from this study and the extrapolation 
from the adult indication support the requested extension of indication. 
5.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Mozobil in paediatric patients (1 to less than 18 years) in combination with G-CSF to 
enhance mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent 
autologous transplantation in children with a lymphoma or a solid malignant tumour, either:

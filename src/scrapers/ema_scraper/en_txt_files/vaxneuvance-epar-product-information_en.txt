and acute otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants, children and adolescents from
6 weeks to less than 18 years of age.
Vaxneuvance is indicated for active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease and
pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in individuals 18 years of age and older.
2
See sections 4.4 and 5.1 for information on protection against specific pneumococcal serotypes.
The use of Vaxneuvance should be in accordance with official recommendations.
4.2  Posology and method of administration
Posology
Routine vaccination schedule in infants and children aged 6 weeks to less than 2 years 
Two-dose primary series 
followed by a booster dose 
Three-dose primary series
followed by a booster dose
The recommended immunisation regimen consists of 3 doses of
Vaxneuvance, each of 0.5 mL. The first dose is given as early as
6 weeks of age, with a second dose administered 8 weeks later. The
third (booster) dose is recommended between 11 through 15 months
of age.
An immunisation regimen consisting of 4 doses of Vaxneuvance,
each of 0.5 mL, may be given. This primary series consists of
3 doses, with the first dose given as early as 6 weeks of age, with an
interval of 4 to 8 weeks between doses in the primary series. The
fourth (booster) dose is recommended between 11 through
15 months of age and at least 2 months after the third dose.
Preterm infants (<37 weeks
gestation at birth)
The recommended immunisation regimen consists of a three-dose
primary series of Vaxneuvance followed by a fourth (booster) dose,
each of 0.5 mL, as per three-dose primary series followed by a
booster dose posology (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).
Prior vaccination with
another pneumococcal
conjugate vaccine
Infants and children who have begun immunisation with another
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine may switch to Vaxneuvance at
any point in the schedule (see section 5.1). 
Catch-up vaccination schedule for children 7 months to less than 18 years of age
Unvaccinated infants 7 to 
less than 12 months of age 
3 doses, each of 0.5 mL, with the first two doses given at least
4 weeks apart. A third (booster) dose is recommended after
12 months of age, separated from the second dose by at least
2 months.
Unvaccinated children 12
months to less than 2 years
of age
Unvaccinated or not fully
vaccinated children and
adolescents 2 to less than 18
years of age
2 doses, each of 0.5 mL, with an interval of 2 months between
doses.
1 dose (0.5 mL).
If a previous pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was administered, at
least 2 months should elapse before administering Vaxneuvance.
Vaccination schedule for individuals 18 years of age and older
Individuals 18 years of age 
and older 
1 dose (0.5 mL).
The need for revaccination with a subsequent dose of Vaxneuvance
has not been established.
Special populations
One or more doses of Vaxneuvance may be given to individuals who have one or more underlying
conditions predisposing them to an increased risk of pneumococcal disease (such as individuals with
3
 
sickle cell disease or living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or recipients of
haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or immunocompetent individuals 18 to 49 years of age
with risk factors for pneumococcal disease; see section 5.1).
Method of administration
The vaccine should be administered by intramuscular injection. The preferred site is the anterolateral
aspect of the thigh in infants or the deltoid muscle of the upper arm in children and adults. 
No data are available for administration via the intradermal route.
For instructions on the handling of the vaccine before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to any
diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine.
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Precaution related to route of administration
Vaxneuvance must not be administered intravascularly.
Anaphylaxis
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be
readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.
Concurrent illness
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution to individuals
receiving anticoagulant therapy, or to those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder such
as haemophilia. Bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these
individuals. Vaxneuvance may be given subcutaneously if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the
risks (see section 5.1).
Apnoea in premature infants
The potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hours should be
considered when administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born ≤ 28
weeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the
benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination generally should not be withheld or
delayed.
4
Immunocompromised individuals
Immunocompromised individuals, whether due to the use of immuno-suppressive therapy, a genetic
defect, HIV infection, or other causes, may have reduced antibody response to active immunisation.
Safety and immunogenicity data for Vaxneuvance are available for individuals with sickle cell disease
or living with HIV infection or with a haematopoietic stem cell transplant (see section 5.1). Safety and
immunogenicity data for Vaxneuvance are not available for individuals in other specific
immunocompromised groups and vaccination should be considered on an individual basis.
Protection
As with any vaccine, vaccination with Vaxneuvance may not protect all vaccine recipients.
Vaxneuvance will only protect against Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes included in the vaccine
(see sections 2 and 5.1).
Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 milligrams) per dose, i.e. essentially
‘sodium-free’.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Different injectable vaccines should always be administered at different injection sites.
Immunosuppressive therapies may reduce the immune responses to vaccines.
Infants and children aged 6 weeks to less than 2 years
Vaxneuvance can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccine antigens, either as
monovalent or combination vaccines: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis (serotypes 1, 2
and 3), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella and
rotavirus vaccine.
Children and adolescents 2 to less than 18 years of age
There are no data on the concomitant administration of Vaxneuvance with other vaccines.
Data from a post-marketing clinical study evaluating the impact of prophylactic use of antipyretics
(ibuprofen and paracetamol) on the immune response to other pneumococcal vaccines suggest that
administration of antipyretics concomitantly or within the same day of vaccination may reduce the
immune response after the infant series. Responses to the booster dose administered at 12 months were
unaffected. The clinical significance of this observation is unknown.
Adults 
Vaxneuvance can be administered concomitantly with seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine (split
virion, inactivated). There are no data on the concomitant administration of Vaxneuvance with other
vaccines.
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy, and lactation
Pregnancy
There is limited experience with the use of Vaxneuvance in pregnant women.
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy,
embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3).
5
Administration of Vaxneuvance in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits
outweigh any potential risks for the mother and the foetus.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether Vaxneuvance is excreted in human milk.
Fertility
No human data on the effect of Vaxneuvance on fertility are available. Animal studies in female rats
do not indicate harmful effects (see section 5.3).
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Vaxneuvance has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some
of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” may temporarily affect the ability to
drive or use machines.
4.8  Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Paediatric population
Infants and children aged 6 weeks to less than 2 years
The safety of Vaxneuvance in healthy infants, including preterm infants (from 6 weeks of age at first
vaccination) and children (11 through 15 months of age) was assessed as a 3 dose or 4 dose regimen in
5 clinical studies with a total of 7,229 participants. 
All 5 studies evaluated the safety of Vaxneuvance when administered concomitantly with other
routine paediatric vaccines. In these studies, 4,286 participants received a complete regimen of
Vaxneuvance, 2,405 participants received a complete regimen of the 13-valent pneumococcal
conjugate vaccine (PCV) and 538 participants received Vaxneuvance when used to complete a
regimen initiated with the 13-valent PCV (mixed dose regimen).
The most frequent adverse reactions were pyrexia ≥38 °C (75.2%), irritability (74.5%), somnolence
(55.0%), injection-site pain (44.4%), injection-site erythema (41.7%), decreased appetite (38.2%),
injection-site induration (28.3%) and injection-site swelling (28.2%) based on results in 3,589
participants (Table 1), excluding participants who received a mixed dose regimen. The majority of
solicited adverse reactions were mild to moderate (based on intensity or size) and of short duration
(≤3 days). Severe reactions (defined as being extremely distressed or unable to do usual activities or
size of injection site reaction >7.6 cm) occurred in ≤3.5% of infants and children following any dose,
with the exception of irritability which occurred in 11.4% of participants.
Children and adolescents 2 to less than 18 years of age
The safety of Vaxneuvance in healthy children and adolescents was assessed in a study that included
352 participants 2 to less than 18 years of age, of whom 177 received a single dose of Vaxneuvance.
In this age cohort, 42.9% of all participants had a history of previous vaccination with a lower valency
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
The most frequent adverse reactions were injection-site pain (54.8%), myalgia (23.7%), injection-site
swelling (20.9%), injection-site erythema (19.2%), fatigue (15.8%), headache (11.9%), injection-site
induration (6.8%), and pyrexia ≥38 °C (5.6%) (Table 1). The majority of solicited adverse reactions
were mild to moderate (based on intensity or size) and of short duration (≤3 days); severe reactions
6
(defined as being extremely distressed or unable to do usual activities or size of injection site
reaction >7.6 cm) occurred in ≤4.5% of children and adolescents.
Adults 18 years of age and older
The safety of Vaxneuvance in healthy and immunocompetent adults was assessed in 6 clinical studies
in 7,136 adults ≥18 years of age. An additional clinical study assessed 302 adults ≥18 years of age
living with HIV. Vaxneuvance was administered to 5,630 adults; 1,241 were 18 to 49 years of age,
1,911 were 50 to 64 years of age, and 2,478 were 65 years of age and older. Of those who received
Vaxneuvance, 1,134 were immunocompetent adults 18 to 49 years of age who had no (n=285), 1
(n=620) or ≥ 2 (n=229) risk factors for pneumococcal disease and 152 were adults ≥18 years of age
living with HIV. In addition, 5,253 adults were pneumococcal vaccine-naïve and 377 adults were
previously vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) at least 1 year
prior to enrollment.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions following vaccination with Vaxneuvance were
solicited. In the pooled analysis of the 7 studies, the most frequent adverse reactions were injection-
site pain (64.6%), fatigue (23.4%), myalgia (20.7%), headache (17.3%), injection-site swelling
(16.1%), injection-site erythema (11.3%) and arthralgia (7.9%) (Table 1). The majority of solicited
adverse reactions were mild (based on intensity or size) and of short duration (≤3 days); severe
reactions (defined as an event that prevents normal daily activity or size of injection site
reaction >10 cm) occurred in ≤1.5% of adults across the clinical program.
Older adults reported fewer adverse reactions than younger adults.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
In clinical studies of adults, local and systemic adverse reactions were solicited daily after vaccination
for 5 and 14 days, respectively and in infants, children and adolescents up to 14 days after vaccination.
In all populations, unsolicited adverse reactions were reported for 14 days after vaccination.

Additional information for other dosing regimens, vaccination schedules and special populations 
Mixed dose regimen of different pneumococcal conjugate vaccines 
The safety profiles of mixed 4-dose regimens of Vaxneuvance and the 13-valent PCV in healthy
infants and children were generally comparable to those of complete 4-dose regimens of either
Vaxneuvance or the 13-valent PCV (see section 5.1).
Catch-up vaccination schedule
Safety was also assessed as a catch-up vaccination schedule in 126 healthy infants and children from
7 months to less than 2 years of age who received 2 or 3 doses of Vaxneuvance based on age at
enrollment. The safety profile of the catch-up vaccination schedule was generally consistent with the
safety profile of the routine vaccination schedule initiated from 6 weeks of age (see section 5.1).
8
 
Children and adolescents with sickle cell disease or living with HIV
Safety was also assessed in 69 children and adolescents 5 to less than 18 years of age with sickle cell
disease and in 203 children and adolescents 6 to less than 18 years of age living with HIV, all of
whom received a single dose of Vaxneuvance. The safety profile of Vaxneuvance in children with
these conditions was generally consistent with the safety profile in healthy children (see section 5.1). 
Children and adults receiving Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant
Safety was also assessed in 131 adults and 8 children ≥3 years of age who had received an allogeneic
haematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) 3 to 6 months prior to enrollment, all of whom
received between 1 and 4 doses of Vaxneuvance. The safety profile of Vaxneuvance in recipients of
allo-HSCT was generally consistent with the safety profile in a healthy population.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
There are no data with regard to overdose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, pneumococcal vaccines, ATC code: J07AL02
Mechanism of action
Vaxneuvance contains 15 purified pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides from Streptococcus
pneumoniae (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F, with the additional serotypes 22F and
33F), each conjugated to a carrier protein (CRM197). Vaxneuvance elicits a T-cell dependent immune
response to induce antibodies that enhance opsonisation, phagocytosis, and killing of pneumococci to
protect against pneumococcal disease. 
Immune responses following natural exposure to Streptococcus pneumoniae or following
pneumococcal vaccination can be determined by measuring opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) and
immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses. OPA represents functional antibodies and is considered an
important immunologic surrogate measure of protection against pneumococcal disease in adults. In
children, a serotype-specific IgG antibody level corresponding to ≥0.35 µg/mL using the WHO
enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been used as the threshold value for the clinical
evaluation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.
Clinical immunogenicity in healthy infants, children and adolescents
Immunogenicity was assessed by serotype-specific IgG response rates (the proportion of participants
meeting the serotype-specific IgG threshold value of ≥0.35 µg/mL) and IgG geometric mean
concentrations (GMCs) at 30 days following the primary series and/or following the toddler (booster)
dose. In a subset of participants, OPA geometric mean titres (GMTs) were also measured at 30 days
following the primary series and/or following the toddler dose.
9
Infants and children receiving a routine vaccination schedule
3-dose regimen (2-dose primary series + 1 toddler dose)
In the double-blind, active comparator-controlled study (Protocol 025), 1,184 participants were
randomised to receive Vaxneuvance or the 13-valent PCV in a 3-dose regimen. The first two doses
were administered to infants at 2 and 4 months of age (primary series) and the third dose was
administered to children at 11 through 15 months of age (toddler dose). Participants also received
other paediatric vaccines concomitantly, including Rotavirus vaccine (live) with the infant primary
series and Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis (acellular), Hepatitis B (rDNA), Poliomyelitis (inactivated),
Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine (adsorbed) with all 3 doses in the complete regimen.
Vaxneuvance elicits immune responses, as assessed by IgG response rates, IgG GMCs and OPA
GMTs, for all 15 serotypes contained in the vaccine. At 30 days following the two-dose primary
series, serotype-specific IgG response rates and GMCs were generally comparable for the 13 shared
serotypes and higher for the 2 additional serotypes (22F and 33F) in Vaxneuvance recipients,
compared to the 13-valent PCV recipients (Table 2). At 30 days following the toddler dose,
Vaxneuvance is noninferior to the 13-valent PCV for the 13 shared serotypes and superior for the
2 additional serotypes, as assessed by IgG response rate and IgG GMCs (Table 3).

n=Number of participants randomised, vaccinated and contributing to the analysis.
CI=confidence interval; GMC=geometric mean concentration (µg/mL); IgG=immunoglobulin G.
Additionally, Vaxneuvance elicits functional antibodies, as assessed by serotype-specific OPA GMTs
at 30 days following the toddler dose, that are generally comparable but slightly lower for the
13  serotypes shared with 13-valent PCV. The clinical relevance of this slightly lower response is
unknown. OPA GMTs for both 22F and 33F were higher in Vaxneuvance recipients compared to the
13-valent PCV recipients. 
In another double-blind, active comparator-controlled study (Protocol 026), 1,191 participants were
randomised to receive Vaxneuvance or the 13-valent PCV as a 3-dose regimen given concomitantly
with other paediatric vaccines including Vaxelis with all three doses and M-M-RvaxPro and Varivax
with the toddler dose. The primary series was administered to infants at 3 and 5 months of age
followed by the toddler dose at 12 months of age. 
Vaxneuvance elicits immune responses, as assessed by IgG response rates, IgG GMCs and OPA
GMTs, for all 15 serotypes contained in the vaccine. At 30 days following the toddler dose,
Vaxneuvance is non-inferior to the 13-valent PCV for the 13 shared serotypes and superior for the
2 additional serotypes, 22F and 33F, as assessed by IgG response rates. Similarly, Vaxneuvance is
non-inferior to the 13-valent PCV for the 13 shared serotypes and superior to the 13-valent PCV for
the 2 additional serotypes, as assessed by IgG GMCs. Following the toddler dose, Vaxneuvance
12
generates functional antibodies (OPA GMTs) for all 15 serotypes that are generally comparable with
the 13-valent PCV.
4-dose regimen (3-dose primary series + 1 toddler dose)
A 4-dose regimen was evaluated in healthy infants in one phase 2 and three phase 3 studies. The
primary series were administered to infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age and the toddler dose was
administered to children at 12 through 15 months of age.
In a double-blind, active comparator-controlled study (Protocol 029), 1,720 participants were
randomised to receive Vaxneuvance or the 13-valent PCV. Participants also received other paediatric
vaccines concomitantly, including HBVaxPro (Hepatitis B Vaccine [Recombinant]), RotaTeq
(Rotavirus Vaccine, Live, Oral, Pentavalent) and Diphtheria, Tetanus Toxoids, Acellular Pertussis
Adsorbed, Poliomyelitis (inactivated), Haemophilus b Conjugate (Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate) Vaccine
in the infant series. Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate), M-M-RvaxPro
(Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live), Varivax (Varicella Virus Vaccine Live) and
Vaqta (Hepatitis A Vaccine, Inactivated) were administered concomitantly with the toddler dose of
Vaxneuvance. 
Vaxneuvance elicits immune responses, as assessed by IgG response rates, IgG GMCs and OPA
GMTs for all 15 serotypes contained in the vaccine. At 30 days following the primary series,
Vaxneuvance is noninferior to the 13-valent PCV for the 13 shared serotypes, as assessed by IgG
response rates (Table 4). Vaxneuvance is noninferior for the 2 additional serotypes, as assessed by the
IgG response rates for serotypes 22F and 33F in recipients of Vaxneuvance compared with the
response rate for serotype 23F in recipients of the 13-valent PCV (the lowest response rate for any of
the shared serotypes, excluding serotype 3), with percentage point differences of 6.7% (95% CI: 4.6,
9.2) and -4.5% (95% CI: -7.8, -1.3), respectively.
At 30 days following the primary series, serotype-specific IgG GMCs are noninferior to the 13-valent
PCV for 12 of the 13 shared serotypes. The IgG response to serotype 6A narrowly missed the
prespecified noninferiority criteria by a small margin (0.48 versus >0.5) (Table 4). Vaxneuvance is
noninferior to the 13-valent PCV for the 2 additional serotypes, as assessed by serotype-specific IgG
GMCs for serotypes 22F and 33F in recipients of Vaxneuvance compared with the IgG GMCs for
serotype 4 in recipients of the 13-valent PCV (the lowest IgG GMC for any of the shared serotypes,
excluding serotype 3) with a GMC ratio of 3.64 and 1.24, respectively.
Additionally, Vaxneuvance induces immune responses to shared serotype 3 and the 2 additional
serotypes, which were substantially higher compared to the immune response induced by the 13-valent
PCV as assessed by IgG response rates and IgG GMCs at 30 days following the primary series
(Table 4).

† A conclusion of non-inferiority for the 13 shared serotypes is based on the lower bound of the 95% CI being > 0.5 for the IgG GMC ratio

n=Number of participants randomised, vaccinated and contributing to the analysis.
CI=confidence interval; GMC=geometric mean concentration (µg/mL); IgG=immunoglobulin G.
Vaxneuvance elicits functional antibodies, as assessed by serotype-specific OPA GMTs at 30 days
following the primary series and following the toddler dose, that are generally comparable but slightly
lower for the 13 serotypes shared with 13-valent PCV. The clinical relevance of this slightly lower
response is unknown. OPA GMTs for both 22F and 33F were higher in Vaxneuvance recipients
compared to the 13-valent PCV recipients.
Infants and children receiving a mixed dose regimen of different pneumococcal conjugate vaccines
In a double-blind, active comparator-controlled, descriptive study (Protocol 027), 900 participants
were randomised in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to one of five vaccination groups to receive a complete or mixed
dosing regimen of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. In two vaccination groups, participants received
a 4-dose regimen of either Vaxneuvance or the 13-valent PCV. In the three other vaccination groups,
the vaccination series were initiated with the 13-valent PCV and changed to Vaxneuvance at Dose 2,
Dose 3 or Dose 4. Participants also received other paediatric vaccines concomitantly, including
HBVaxPro (Hepatitis B Vaccine [Recombinant]) and RotaTeq (Rotavirus Vaccine, Live, Oral,
Pentavalent). Serotype-specific IgG GMCs at 30 days following the toddler dose were generally
comparable for participants administered mixed regimens of Vaxneuvance and the 13-valent PCV and
for participants administered a complete dosing regimen of the 13-valent PCV for the 13 shared
serotypes, as assessed by IgG GMC ratios. 
Higher antibodies to serotypes 22F and 33F were only observed when at least one dose of
Vaxneuvance was administered during primary infant series and at the toddler age.
15
Immunogenicity in preterm infants
The immune responses (serotype-specific IgG and OPA) in preterm infants receiving 4 doses of
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 4 double-blind, active comparator-controlled studies
(Protocol 025, Protocol 027, Protocol 029 and Protocol 031), were generally consistent with those
observed in the overall healthy infant population in these studies (including preterm and term infants).
Infants, children and adolescents receiving a catch-up vaccination schedule 
In a double-blind, active comparator-controlled, descriptive study (Protocol 024), 606 children who
were either pneumococcal vaccine-naïve or not fully vaccinated or completed a dosing regimen with
lower valency pneumococcal conjugate vaccines were randomised to receive 1 to 3 doses of
Vaxneuvance or the 13-valent PCV in three different age cohorts (7 through 11 months, 12 through
23 months and 24 months to less than 18 years of age), according to an age-appropriate schedule.
Catch-up vaccination with Vaxneuvance elicited immune responses in children 7 months to less than
18 years of age that are comparable to the 13-valent PCV for the shared serotypes and higher than the
13-valent PCV for the additional serotypes 22F and 33F. Within each age cohort, serotype-specific
IgG GMCs at 30 days following the last dose of vaccine were generally comparable between the
vaccination groups for the 13 shared serotypes and higher in Vaxneuvance for the 2 additional
serotypes.
Immune responses after subcutaneous administration in infants and children
In a double-blind, active comparator-controlled, descriptive study (Protocol 033), 694 healthy
Japanese infants from 2 to 6 months of age were randomised to receive either Vaxneuvance or the 13-
valent PCV as a 4-dose regimen via a subcutaneous route of administration. The first dose was given
at 2 to 6 months of age and second and third dose were given at an interval of ≥27 days from the prior
dose. The fourth dose was administered at 12 to 15 months of age. Vaxneuvance elicited serotype-
specific immune responses (IgG and OPA) in healthy infants and toddlers that were generally
comparable to the 13-valent PCV for the shared serotypes and higher in Vaxneuvance for the 2 
additional serotypes.
Clinical immunogenicity in immunocompetent adults ≥18 years of age
Five clinical studies (Protocol 007, Protocol 016, Protocol 017, Protocol 019, and Protocol 021)
conducted in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific evaluated the immunogenicity of Vaxneuvance in
healthy and immunocompetent adults across different age groups including individuals with or without
previous pneumococcal vaccination. Each clinical study included adults with stable underlying
medical conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus, renal disorders, chronic heart disease, chronic liver disease,
chronic lung disease including asthma) and/or behavioural risk factors (e.g., current tobacco use,
increased alcohol consumption) that are known to increase the risk of pneumococcal disease.
In each study, immunogenicity was assessed by serotype-specific OPA and IgG responses at 30 days
postvaccination. Study endpoints included OPA geometric mean titres (GMTs) and IgG geometric
mean concentrations (GMCs). The pivotal study (Protocol 019) aimed to show noninferiority of the
OPA GMTs for 12 of 13 serotypes that Vaxneuvance shares with the 13-valent pneumococcal
polysaccharide conjugate vaccine, noninferiority and superiority for the shared serotype 3, and
superiority for serotypes 22F and 33F, additional to Vaxneuvance. Superiority assessment of
Vaxneuvance to the 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine was based on the
between-group comparisons of OPA GMTs and the proportions of participants with a ≥4-fold rise in
serotype-specific OPA titres from prevaccination to 30 days postvaccination.
Pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults
In the pivotal, double-blind, active comparator-controlled study (Protocol 019),
1,205 immunocompetent pneumococcal vaccine-naïve subjects ≥50 years of age were randomised to
receive Vaxneuvance or the 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine. The median
age of participants was 66 years (range: 50 to 92 years), with approximately 69% over 65 years of age,
16
and approximately 12% over 75 years of age. 57.3% were female and 87% reported history of at least
one underlying medical condition.
The study demonstrated that Vaxneuvance is noninferior to the 13-valent pneumococcal
polysaccharide conjugate vaccine for the 13 shared serotypes and superior for the 2 additional
serotypes and for the shared serotype 3. Table 6 summarises the OPA GMTs at 30 days
postvaccination. IgG GMCs were generally consistent with the results observed for the OPA GMTs.

In a double-blind, descriptive study (Protocol 017), 1,515 immunocompetent subjects 18 to 49 years of
age with or without risk factors for pneumococcal disease were randomised 3:1 and received
Vaxneuvance or the 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine, followed by PPV23
6 months later. Risk factors for pneumococcal disease included the following: diabetes mellitus,
chronic heart disease including heart failure, chronic liver disease with compensated cirrhosis, chronic
lung disease including persistent asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), current
tobacco use, and increased alcohol consumption. Overall, of those who received Vaxneuvance,
285 (25.2%) had no risk factor, 620 (54.7%) had 1 risk factor, and 228 (20.1%) had 2 or more risk
factors.
Vaxneuvance elicited immune responses to all 15 serotypes contained in the vaccine as assessed by
OPA GMTs (Table 7) and IgG GMCs. OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs were generally comparable
between the two vaccination groups for the 13 shared serotypes and higher in the Vaxneuvance group
17
for the 2 additional serotypes. Following vaccination with PPV23, OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs were
generally comparable between the two vaccination groups for all 15 serotypes.
In a subgroup analysis based on the number of reported risk factors, Vaxneuvance elicited immune
responses to all 15 serotypes contained in the vaccine as assessed by OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs at
30 days postvaccination in adults with no, 1, or 2 or more risk factors. The results in each subgroup
were generally consistent with those observed in the overall study population. Sequential
administration of Vaxneuvance followed 6 months later by PPV23 was also immunogenic for all
15 serotypes contained in Vaxneuvance.

Sequential administration of pneumococcal vaccines in adults
The sequential administration of Vaxneuvance followed by PPV23 was assessed in Protocol 016,
Protocol 017 (see section 5.1, Pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults), and Protocol 018 (see section 5.1,
Adults living with HIV).
In a double-blind, active comparator-controlled study (Protocol 016), 652 pneumococcal
vaccine-naïve subjects ≥50 years of age were randomised to receive Vaxneuvance or the 13-valent
pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine, followed by PPV23 one year later.
Following vaccination with PPV23, OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs were comparable between the two
vaccination groups for all 15 serotypes in Vaxneuvance.
Immune responses elicited by Vaxneuvance persisted up to 12 months postvaccination as assessed by
OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs. Serotype-specific OPA GMTs declined over time, as they were lower at
Month 12 than Day 30, but remained above baseline levels for all the serotypes contained in either
Vaxneuvance or the 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine. OPA GMTs and IgG
18
GMCs were generally comparable between the intervention groups at Month 12 for the 13 shared
serotypes and higher for the 2 additional serotypes among recipients of Vaxneuvance.
Adults with prior pneumococcal vaccination
In a double-blind, descriptive study (Protocol 007), 253 subjects ≥65 years of age who were
previously vaccinated with PPV23 at least one year prior to study entry were randomised to receive
Vaxneuvance or the 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine.
IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs were generally comparable between the two vaccination groups for the
13 shared serotypes and higher in the Vaxneuvance group for the 2 additional serotypes.
In a clinical study, in which another PCV was administered ≤1 year after PPV23, reduced immune
responses were observed for the common serotypes compared to immune responses observed when
PCV was given either alone or before PPV23. The clinical significance of this is unknown.
Clinical immunogenicity in special populations
Children living with HIV
In a double-blind, descriptive study (Protocol 030), Vaxneuvance was evaluated in 203 children 6 to
less than 18 years of age living with HIV. Of these children, 17 (8.4%) had a CD4+ T-cell count
<500 cells/μL and plasma HIV RNA value <50,000 copies/mL. In this study, 407 participants were
randomised to receive a single dose of either Vaxneuvance or the 13-valent PCV, followed by PPV 23
2 months later. Vaxneuvance was immunogenic as assessed by serotype-specific IgG GMCs and OPA
GMTs at 30 days postvaccination for all 15 serotypes contained in Vaxneuvance. Serotype-specific
IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs were generally comparable for the 13 shared serotypes and higher for the
2 additional serotypes (22F and 33F). After sequential administration with PPV 23, IgG GMCs and
OPA GMTs were generally comparable at 30 days postvaccination between the two vaccination
groups for all 15 serotypes contained in Vaxneuvance. 
Adults living with HIV
In a double-blind, descriptive study (Protocol 018), 302 pneumococcal vaccine-naïve subjects
≥ 18 years of age living with HIV with CD4+ T-cell count ≥50 cells/µL and plasma HIV ribonucleic
acid (RNA) <50,000 copies/mL were randomised to receive Vaxneuvance or the 13-valent
pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine, followed by PPV23 2 months later. The majority of
participants had a CD4+ T-cell count ≥200 cells/µL; 4 (1.3%) had a CD4+ T-cell count ≥50 to
<200 cells/µL, 152 (50.3%) had a CD4+ T-cell count ≥200 to <500 cells/µL, and 146 (48.3%) had a
CD4+ T-cell count ≥500 cells/µL.
Vaxneuvance elicited immune responses to all 15 serotypes contained in the vaccine as assessed by
OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs at 30 days postvaccination. Immune responses seen in the HIV-infected
participants were consistently lower compared to healthy participants but comparable for both
vaccination groups, except for serotype 4. OPA GMT and IgG GMC for serotype 4 were lower for
Vaxneuvance. After sequential administration with PPV23, OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs were
generally comparable between the two vaccination groups for all 15 serotypes. 
Children with Sickle Cell Disease
In a double-blind, descriptive study (Protocol 023), Vaxneuvance was evaluated in children 5 to less
than 18 years of age with sickle cell disease. In this study, participants enrolled may have received
routine pneumococcal vaccines during the first two years of life but had not received pneumococcal
vaccines in the 3 years prior to study entry. A total of 104 participants were randomised 2:1 to receive
a single dose of either Vaxneuvance or the 13-valent PCV. Vaxneuvance was immunogenic as
assessed by serotype-specific IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs at 30 days postvaccination for all
15 serotypes contained in Vaxneuvance. Serotype-specific IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs were generally
comparable between the two vaccination groups for the 13 shared serotypes and higher in
Vaxneuvance for the two additional serotypes 22F and 33F. 
19
Children and adults receiving Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant
In a double-blind, descriptive study (Protocol 022), Vaxneuvance was evaluated in adults and
children ≥3 years of age who had received an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant
(allo-HSCT) 3 to 6 months prior to enrollment. In this study, 277 participants were randomised to
receive 3 doses of Vaxneuvance or the 13-valent PCV, administered one month apart. Twelve months
after allo-HSCT, participants without chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) received a single
dose of PPV23 and those with cGvHD received a fourth dose of either Vaxneuvance or the 13-valent
PCV. Vaxneuvance was immunogenic in recipients of allo-HSCT, as assessed by IgG GMCs and OPA
GMTs at 30 days following the third dose of Vaxneuvance for all 15 serotypes contained in the
vaccine. Serotype-specific IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs were generally comparable between the two
vaccination groups for the 13 shared serotypes and higher in Vaxneuvance for the two additional
serotypes (22F and 33F). Similarly, in participants who received either Vaxneuvance or the 13-valent
PCV twelve months after allo-HSCT, IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs at 30 days following vaccination
were generally comparable between the two vaccination groups for the 13 shared serotypes and higher
in Vaxneuvance for the two additional serotypes (22F and 33F). In participants who received PPV23
twelve months after allo-HSCT, IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs at 30 days following vaccination were
generally comparable between the two vaccination groups for all 15 serotypes contained in
Vaxneuvance.
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties
Not applicable.
5.3  Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical study data revealed no hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose
toxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development.
Vaxneuvance administered to female rats had no effects on mating performance, fertility,
embryonic/foetal development, or development of the offspring.
Vaxneuvance administered to pregnant female rats resulted in detectable antibodies to all 15 serotypes
in offspring. This was attributable to the acquisition of maternal antibodies via placental transfer
during gestation and possibly via lactation.

important information for you.
• 
• 
• 
• 
This vaccine has been prescribed for you or your child only. Do not pass it on to others.
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.

Possible side effects 
How to store Vaxneuvance
1.  What Vaxneuvance is and what it is used for
Vaxneuvance is a pneumococcal vaccine given to:
• 
children from 6 weeks to less than 18 years of age to help protect against diseases such as
lung infection (pneumonia), inflammation of the coverings of the brain and spinal cord
(meningitis), a severe infection in the blood (bacteraemia) and ear infections (acute otitis
media),
• 
individuals 18 years of age and older to help protect against diseases such as lung infection
(pneumonia), inflammation of the coverings of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) and a
severe infection in the blood (bacteraemia), caused by 15 types of bacteria called Streptococcus
pneumoniae or pneumococcus.
2.  What you need to know before you or your child receives Vaxneuvance
Do not receive Vaxneuvance if:
• 
you or your child is allergic to the active substances or to any of the ingredients of this vaccine
(listed in section 6), or to any vaccine that contains diphtheria toxoid.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you or your child receives Vaxneuvance if:
• 
the immune system is weak (which means the body is less able to fight off infections) or if you
or your child is taking certain medicines that may make the immune system weak (for example,
immunosuppressants or steroids).
• 
• 
you or your child has a high fever or severe infection. In these cases, the vaccination may have
to be postponed until you or your child has recovered. However, a mild fever or infection (for
example having a cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination.
you or your child has any bleeding problems, bruises easily, or is taking medicines to prevent
blood clots.
36
If your child is an infant, also tell your doctor if your child was born prematurely (too early). 
As with any vaccine, Vaxneuvance may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated.
Other medicines/vaccines and Vaxneuvance
Your child can be given Vaxneuvance at the same time as other routine childhood vaccines.
In adults, Vaxneuvance can be given at the same time as the flu (inactivated influenza) vaccine.
Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if:
• 
you or your child is taking, has recently taken, or might take any prescription medicines (for
example, immunosuppressants or steroids which may make the immune system weak) or any
medicines obtained without a prescription.
• 
you or your child has recently received or plan to receive any other vaccine.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse for advice before you receive this vaccine.
Driving and using machines
Vaxneuvance has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some
of the effects mentioned under section 4 “Possible side effects” may temporarily affect the ability to
drive or use machines.
Vaxneuvance contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 milligrams) per dose, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.
3.  How Vaxneuvance is given
Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you or your child has been given a pneumococcal vaccine
before.
Your doctor or nurse will give the vaccine into your arm muscle or into your child's arm or leg muscle.
The first injection may be given as early as 6 weeks of age.
Infants and children aged 6 weeks to less than 2 years  
Your child should receive an initial course of 2 injections of the vaccine followed by a booster dose.
• 
• 
• 
You will be told when your child should come back for each injection.
A third injection (booster) will be given between 11 through 15 months of age.
A second injection is administered 2 months later.
According to official recommendations in your country, an alternative schedule of 3 injections
followed by a booster dose may be used by your healthcare provider. Please speak to your doctor,
pharmacist, or nurse for more information.
Premature infants (born earlier than 37 weeks of pregnancy)
Your child should receive an initial course of 3 injections of the vaccine followed by a booster dose. 
• 
• 
The second and third injections are given thereafter with an interval of 4 to 8 weeks between
doses. 
The first injection may be given as early as 6 weeks of age. 
• 
A fourth injection (booster) will be given between 11 through 15 months of age.
37
Infants, children and adolescents starting the vaccination at 7 months of age or older
Infants 7 to less than 12 months of age should receive a total of 3 injections. The first two injections
will be given at least 1 month apart. The third injection (booster) will be given after 12 months of age
and at least 2 months after the second injection.
Children 12 months to less than 2 years of age should receive a total of 2 injections. The two
injections will be given at least 2 months apart. 
Children and adolescents 2 to less than 18 years of age should receive 1 injection.
Adults
Adults should receive 1 injection.
Special populations
One or more injections of Vaxneuvance may be given to individuals who have one or more underlying
conditions that increase their risk for pneumococcal disease (such as individuals with sickle cell
disease or living with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or recipients of a stem cell transplant). 
If you have any further questions on the use of Vaxneuvance, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.

5.  How to store Vaxneuvance
Keep this vaccine out of the sight and reach of children.
Do not use this vaccine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and syringe label after EXP.
The expiry date refers to the last day of that month.
Store in a refrigerator (2 C – 8 C). Do not freeze. Keep the pre-filled syringe in the outer carton in
order to protect from light. 
39
Vaxneuvance should be administered as soon as possible after being removed from the refrigerator.

vaccine is stable at temperatures up to 25 C for 48 hours.
6. 
Contents of the pack and other information
What Vaxneuvance contains
The active substances are:
- 
bacterial sugars from pneumococcus types 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F,
and 33F (2.0 micrograms of each type);
bacterial sugar from pneumococcus type 6B (4.0 micrograms).
- 
Each bacterial sugar is linked to a carrier protein (CRM197). The bacterial sugars and the carrier protein
are not alive and do not cause disease.
One dose (0.5 mL) contains approximately 30 micrograms carrier protein, adsorbed on aluminium
phosphate (125 micrograms aluminium [Al3+]). Aluminium phosphate is included in the vaccine as an
adjuvant. Adjuvants are included to improve the immune responses of vaccines.
The other ingredients are sodium chloride (NaCl), L-histidine, polysorbate 20, and water for
injections.
What Vaxneuvance looks like and contents of the pack
Vaxneuvance is an opalescent suspension for injection, provided in a single-dose, pre-filled syringe
(0.5 mL). Vaxneuvance is available in pack sizes of 1 or 10, either without needles, with 1 separate
needle, or with 2 separate needles.
Vaxneuvance is also available in multipacks comprising 5 cartons, each containing 10 pre-filled
syringes without needles.
Not all pack sizes may be marketed.

Immediately prior to use, hold the pre-filled syringe horizontally and shake vigorously to obtain
an opalescent suspension. Do not use the vaccine if it cannot be resuspended.
Inspect the suspension visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration.
Discard the vaccine if particulates are present and/or if it appears discoloured.
Attach a needle with Luer lock connection by twisting in a clockwise direction until the needle
fits securely on the syringe.
Inject immediately using the intramuscular (IM) route, preferably in the anterolateral aspect of
the thigh in infants or in the deltoid area of the upper arm in children and adults.
Exercise care to avoid harm from an accidental needle stick.
No data are available for administration via the intradermal route.
Vaxneuvance must not be mixed with any other vaccines in the same syringe.
Vaxneuvance can be given concomitantly with other routine childhood vaccines.
Vaxneuvance can be administered concomitantly with seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine (split
virion, inactivated) in adults. 
Different injectable vaccines should always be administered at different injection sites.
Store in a refrigerator (2 ℃– 8 ℃). Do not freeze.
Keep the pre-filled syringe in the outer carton in order to protect from light.

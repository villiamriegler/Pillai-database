Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for voretigene neparvovec, the 
scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
In view of available data on (chorio)retinal atrophy from the literature and reports from the ongoing 
US and EU PASSs including in 21 cases a close temporal relationship, and in view of a possible 
mechanism of action, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between Voretigene 
neparvovec and (chorio)retinal atrophy is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC Rapporteur 
concluded that the product information of products containing Voretigene neparvovec should be 
amended accordingly.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for voretigene neparvovec the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing voretigene neparvovec is unchanged 
subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

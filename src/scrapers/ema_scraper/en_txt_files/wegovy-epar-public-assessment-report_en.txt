2.  Scientific discussion  
2.1.  Problem statement  
In this application, data collected by Novo Nordisk (sponsor, applicant) are presented to support the use of 
semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once weekly (hereafter referred to as semaglutide 2.4 mg) as an adjunct to a 
reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management, including weight loss and weight 
maintenance, in adults with an initial body mass index (BMI) of 
•  ≥30 kg/m2 (obesity), or 
•  ≥27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2 (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbidity. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition  
Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation. Obesity is a medical condition 
in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. A body 
mass index (BMI) over 25 is considered overweight, and over 30 is obese.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and Biologic features  
The prevalence of obesity has reached epidemic proportions and continues to increase. Obesity is currently 
considered one of the most significant public health challenges worldwide due to its substantial medical, 
societal and economic impact. Obesity is associated with several health-related complications. Most 
concerning, obesity increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancers, 
which are some of the leading causes of early death in these patients. In addition, obesity is a well-
established risk factor for other serious conditions including, but not limited to, T2D, hypertension, 
dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, osteoarthritis, urinary incontinence, asthma and non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis. Obesity also significantly impacts health-related quality of life by impairing physical health 
status and imposing limitations on daily activities. Furthermore, stigmatization and discrimination associated 
with obesity can contribute to impaired mental well-being.  
The risk of obesity-related complications and comorbidities increases with increasing BMI, and a weight loss 
of 5−10% has significant health benefits by improving obesity-related comorbidities, including slowing 
progression to T2D, and improving physical symptoms and quality of life. Studies suggest a beneficial impact 
of weight loss on cardiovascular risk and mortality in people with obesity, with or without T2D.  
2.1.3.  Management  
Lifestyle intervention in the form of diet and exercise is first-line treatment for obesity, but most people with 
obesity struggle to achieve and maintain their weight loss, most likely due in large part to a homeostatic 
mechanism involving counteractive biological responses. 
Bariatric surgery offers an effective alternative for some people with severe obesity, but surgery carries a risk 
in connection with the procedure and for complications afterwards, and requires close follow-up, which can be 
cumbersome and costly. For people with obesity, there is a lack of safe and efficacious treatment options that 
can provide a reduction in body weight approaching what can be obtained by surgical procedures, and at the 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 12/177 
 
 
 
same time enables the patient to maintain the weight loss. Pharmacotherapy may serve as a valuable 
alternative to bariatric surgery as a supplement to lifestyle intervention to achieve and sustain a clinically 
relevant weight loss. Currently, only a very limited number of pharmacological options are approved for 
weight management.  
Collectively, the Applicant describes an unmet medical need for a convenient, efficacious and safe weight 
lowering drug with beneficial effects on obesity-related comorbidities. The GLP-1 RA drug class is associated 
with multiple benefits; they have a well-documented safety profile, reduce body weight, improve blood 
pressure, lipid profile and other cardiovascular risk factors as well as glucose metabolism. 
2.2.  About the product  
Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue and classified as a GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 
RA). It has a 94% homology to human GLP-1 and a long half-life suitable for once-weekly dosing.  
Semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg for once-weekly s.c. injection is approved worldwide under the tradename 
(Ozempic) for treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and in the US and Russia also for cardiovascular risk 
reduction in people with T2D and established cardiovascular disease. Oral semaglutide (7 mg and 14 mg) is 
approved in the US, Canada, the EU and Japan for the treatment of T2D (Rybelsus). In addition, another 
GLP-1 analogue, the once-daily GLP-1 analogue liraglutide, is approved worldwide for weight management 
(Saxenda). Clinical experience exists from semaglutide for the treatment of T2D and the use of liraglutide for 
weight management. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development  
Development programme 
The global clinical development programme for semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg for weight management, forming the 
basis for this application, comprises 8 completed clinical trials: 
• 
clinical pharmacology trials (of which two are bioequivalence trials) 
•  1 phase 2 dose-finding trial 
•  4 phase 3a therapeutic confirmatory trials (referred to as the STEP trials) 
The cut-off date for inclusion of completed trials was 28 October 2020 (DBL for the last bioequivalence trial, 
trial 4590). 
The application includes blinded safety data from 1 extension trial (extension phase of STEP 1) and 5 other 
ongoing trials. For data from these trials, a cut-off date of 01 September 2020 has been used. 
An overview of the clinical trials included in the application is provided in Table 1 (completed trials) and 
Table 2 (ongoing trials). 
All trials in the clinical development programme followed accepted industry and regulatory requirements for 
developing weight management products, and were conducted in accordance with ICH Good Clinical Practice 
and FDA 21 CFR 312.120.  
Clinical trials conducted with semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg for weight management are identified by the project 
name (NN9536) followed by a unique 4-digit number, e.g., NN9536-4373. In this application, the trials are 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 13/177 
 
 
 
referred to as ‘trial xxxx’, where ‘xxxx’ is the unique 4-digit number (e.g. trial 4373). Trials from other 
development programmes are referred to by their project number (NNXXXX) followed by the unique 4-digit 
number (e.g. semaglutide s.c. for T2D [Ozempic]: trial NN9535-3744). 
The nonclinical and clinical pharmacology data generated with semaglutide as part of the Ozempic 
programme support the weight management indication.

Impact of COVID-19 on the clinical programme 
The COVID-19 public health emergency occurred when almost all subjects in the phase 3a trials had 
completed their last visits. Therefore, the impact of COVID-19 on STEP 1–4 was limited. Novo Nordisk 
followed the guidance provided by the FDA and EMA on handling changes to trials related to COVID-19.  
No subjects discontinued treatment due to COVID-19, but 1 subject (placebo) in STEP 2 and 1 subject 
(semaglutide 2.4 mg) in STEP 3 were reported as withdrawn from the trial during the follow-up period due to 
COVID-19. These 2 subjects were treatment completers. 
COVID-19-related AEs were reported for 3 subjects, 1 in each of the STEP 1–3 trials, all in the semaglutide 
2.4 mg groups (PTs: corona virus infection [2 subjects] and coronavirus test positive [1 subject]). The AEs in 
STEP 1 and 3 were non-serious and of mild severity. The AE in STEP 2 was an SAE reported as ‘severe’ and 
requiring hospitalisation (in-trial period, after the last dosing); the outcome was reported as recovered.

To mitigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19 for subjects and trial staff, site visits could be converted to 
phone visits, thus ensuring reporting of AEs and other safety follow-up information. Visit conversions due to 
COVID-19 were categorised as important PDs, marked as being related to COVID-19.  
Based on information from important PDs, very few subjects (1 in each of the STEP 1–3 trials) had missing 
assessments at the end-of-treatment visit (week 68) for reasons related to COVID-19. As a result, the impact 
of COVID-19 on missing data for the primary and confirmatory secondary endpoints was minimal, and no 
changes were made to the statistical analysis plans due to COVID-19.  
A larger number of subjects (181 in STEP 1, 230 in STEP 2, 135 in STEP 3, and 12 in STEP 4) had missing 
assessments due to COVID-19 at the end-of-trial follow-up visit (week 75) due to visit conversion. The 
assessments to be done at this visit were mainly related to safety follow-up. In STEP 1 and 2, blood sampling 
for PK and antibodies were to be done at week 75, and these samples were not taken for subjects who had 
the follow-up visit done by phone due to COVID-19. In the context of the previous experience with 
semaglutide, the missing data from the follow-up visits did not give rise to any concerns. The missing PK and 
antibody samples did not have any impact on the immunogenicity assessment of semaglutide 2.4 mg. 
Although subjects were allowed to perform some assessments themselves at home (e.g. body weight, pulse, 
blood pressure), the results of these assessments were treated as missing data and were not included in any 
descriptive summaries or statistical analyses. Home pregnancy testing in women of childbearing potential 
was allowed at week 75 (follow-up visit) in order to ensure the safety of the subjects. A total of 20 subjects 
(18 in STEP 1, 1 in STEP 3, and 1 in STEP 4) performed a home pregnancy test at week 75 because the clinic 
visit had been converted to a phone visit due to COVID-19.  
The impact of COVID-19 on the two bioequivalence trials was limited. In trial 4590, some doses were 
changed from being self-administered at the trial site to being self-administered at home, and in trial 
NN9535-4588, 1 PK visit was affected due to a subject with a possible COVID-19 infection. 
Compliance with guidances 
Compliance to CHMP guidelines is discussed in the respective paragraphs, no issues were identified. 
2.4.  Quality aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction  
Semaglutide, the active substance contained in Wegovy, is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue 
substituted with a linker and a fatty acid side chain. It is produced using recombinant DNA technology in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae followed by chemical modifications. Semaglutide is the same active substance 
contained in the currently authorised product Ozempic (EMEA/H/C/4174). 
Wegovy is presented as a clear and colourless solution for subcutaneous injection in a 1 mL prefilled Type I 
glass syringe (PFS) attached  with stainless steel needle, rigid needle shield (type II/polyisoprene) and a 
rubber plunger (type I/chlorobutyl).The PFS is assembled into a single-use prefilled pen (PFP).  
The following presentations are proposed with packs of 4 PFPs each: 
- 0.25 mg semaglutide in 0.5 mL (strength 0.25 mg); 
- 0.5 mg semaglutide in 0.5 mL (strength 0.5 mg); 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 16/177 
 
 
 
- 1 mg semaglutide in 0.5 mL (strength 1 mg); 
- 1.7 mg semaglutide in 0.75 mL (strength 1.7 mg); 
- 2.4 mg semgaglutide in 0.75 mL (strength 2.4 mg). 
2.4.2.  Active Substance  
The information on semaglutide as described in Module 3.2.S. of this marketing authorisation application 
(MAA) is identical to Module 3.2.S of the Ozempic dossier. Minor updates have been implemented to the 
Wegovy dossier. No issue was identified during the procedure. 
General Information  
Semaglutide is a long-acting analogue of human glucagon like-1 peptide i.e. an Aib8, Arg34-GLP-1(7-37) 
analogue substituted on the ε-amino group of the lysine residue in position 26 with an (S)-22,40-dicarboxy-
10,19,24-trioxo-3,6,12,15-tetraoxa-9,18,23-triazatetracontan-1-oyl side chain. The side chain consists of two 
8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid (ADO) spacers, one γ-glutamic acid (Glu) spacer, and a fatty diacid (1,18-
octadecanedioic acid). Semaglutide is produced using recombinant DNA technology in yeast (Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae) and chemical modification. 
The structural formula of semaglutide is given in Figure 1.

Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Manufacturing process 
Semaglutide is manufactured at Novo Nordisk A/S, Hallas Allé, DK-4400 Kalundborg, Denmark (site currently 
authorised for Ozempic). EU GMP compliance for all the sites involved in active substance manufacture and 
control was confirmed. 
The manufacturing process for semaglutide active substance consists of a fermentation process in yeast cells, 
recovery and purification of semaglutide precursor. The semaglutide precursor is subject to a synthetic 
modification process and purified. All steps have been described and explained. 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 17/177 
 
 
 
 
 
The harvested culture broth is split into several batches at delivery to recovery. The subsequent steps in 
recovery and purification (including modification) are all performed as batch processes, and unique batch 
numbers are assigned at designated steps. 
In addition to the active substance itself, three other intermediates are isolated and storage conditions and 
shelf life are defined. 
Control of materials 
The construction of the expression plasmid and the source and history of S. cerevisiae strain Arg34]GLP-1-
(9-37)) producing semaglutide precursor is described in detail. The cell banking system of master cell bank 
(MCB) and working cell bank (WCB) is explained and characterisation of MCB and WCB is reported. Stability 
results of MCB and WCB are available and the results comply with the specification acceptance criteria for the 
MCB and WCB. 
No animal-derived substances are used in the production of semaglutide. 
Reference is made to the CHMP assessment report for Ozempic regarding the definition of stating materials 
and critical intermediates. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical operational parameters and critical in-process tests are defined for process steps. Critical in-process 
tests focus on microbial contamination and product purity. A set of critical operational parameters has been 
defined for the multistep process supported by the evaluation studies in manufacturing process development.  
Process validation 
The manufacturing process design consists of process characterisation and process justification. This is 
followed by process verification (also referred to as process performance qualification (PPQ)), confirming that 
the semaglutide manufacturing process can consistently produce semaglutide active substance of the 
required quality in a manufacturing scale. To ensure that the semaglutide active substance manufacturing 
process remains in a state of control during commercial manufacture and that the validated state following 
PPQ is maintained, ongoing process verification was initiated. 
Based on the totality of the experiments performed during process justification, ranges of both critical and 
non-critical operational parameters and the acceptance criteria for the critical in-process tests have been 
supported. Steps having one or more critical operational parameters have been defined as critical steps. 
The PPQ results of the critical operational parameters, critical in-process tests, and the results of the 
semaglutide active substance specification tests were all consistent for the fermentation, recovery, and 
purification batches and all acceptance criteria were fulfilled. Based on these results, the applicant concludes 
that the semaglutide manufacturing process consistently produces semaglutide active substance of 
reproducible quality in accordance with the predetermined specifications; the process is considered validated 
and ready for commercial production. 
The evaluation of impurity reduction was carried out at a manufacturing scale, covering representative 
production batches from the PPQ. Selected product-related impurities analysed during the PPQ. Process steps 
are monitored, reduction factors calculated, and in-process acceptance criteria set.

Manufacturing process development 
Description and explanation of every change during product and process development is presented, batch 
analysis data and the use of the batch is indicated. 
Comparability and stability data demonstrate that the process has been improved during development with 
respect to impurity levels and robustness of the manufacturing process. The changes made during 
development have not adversely affected the product with respect to quality, safety, or efficacy. 
Characterisation  
Structural characterisation and elucidation of the physico-chemical properties of semaglutide has been 
performed using active substance batches representative for the manufacturing process used for phase 3 
clinical trials and intended for the commercial product. The results of the structural characterisation of 
semaglutide have confirmed the expected and theoretical structure. 
The bioactivity of semaglutide is determined by a cell-based bioactivity assay, which indirectly measures 
adenylate cyclase activation of the cloned human GLP-1 receptor. The bioactivity of isolated semaglutide 
related impurities has been investigated by isolation of the semaglutide main peak and major semaglutide 
related impurities from semaglutide active substance, followed by testing for content and purity of each peak 
by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and bioactivity. An evaluation of the 
correlation between the bioactivity and the content determined by RP-HPLC of semaglutide in active 
substance and finished product, including forced degraded samples, is provided. It is concluded that the RP-
HPLC analytical procedure established for the determination of the main peak content in the semaglutide 
active substance and finished product specifications offers a reliable measure of the bioactivity of semaglutide 
in both active substance and finished product. 
Product-related impurities are structurally related to semaglutide. They are generated as by-products in 
fermentation by the host organism as well as in the recovery and purification process of semaglutide 
precursor, in the modification steps and in the purification process of semaglutide. 
The major impurity peaks from semaglutide active substance have been isolated and the identity of the 
components present in each peak has been determined by high-resolution liquid chromatography mass 
spectrometry (LC/MS). 
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, and 
container closure  
Specification 
The specification for semaglutide active substance include control of identity, purity, bioactivity and other 
general tests. 
Justification of individual specification parameters and acceptance criteria is provided. Specification limits are 
based on process capability.  
A systematic and risk-based approach has been used to establish the control strategy of semaglutide active 
substance.  
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 19/177 
 
 
 
The resulting control strategy for semaglutide active substance is a planned set of controls which are derived 
from accumulated product and process understanding and hereby ensures process performance and product 
quality. 
Analytical procedures 
Method descriptions and validation of test methods are provided. 
The analytical procedures are described, and validation reports have been provided. 
Batch analyses 
The analytical results for relevant semaglutide active substance batches are presented. The batches have 
been used for non-clinical studies, clinical trials (early phase 1 and 2 trials), clinical pharmacology and phase 
3 trials, stability studies, reference material, process performance qualification, and setting of specifications. 
Data is presented as ranges obtained within the given campaign. All batch release data shown comply with 
the active substance specification for semaglutide, which was in force at the time for releasing the batches.  
Reference standards 
A Novo Nordisk A/S reference material hierarchy has been established for semaglutide, consisting of a 
semaglutide primary reference material (PRM) and a semaglutide secondary reference material (SRM). 
The content of the semaglutide PRM was assigned upon an analytical determination of nitrogen content, 
related to the theoretical content of nitrogen in semaglutide, and corrected for sum of impurities by RP-HPLC. 
The semaglutide PRM serves as reference for identification and calibrator for assignment of Content to 
semaglutide SRM, as well as to confirm bioactivity expressed as Specific bioactivity to semaglutide SRMs. 
Semaglutide SRM is used for quality control of semaglutide active substance and finished product for 
identification and determination of Content, as well as to determine the biological activity expressed as 
Specific bioactivity of semaglutide active substance. 
Container closure system 
The active substance is stored in 5 L or 10 L high density polyethylene (HDPE) containers equipped with a 
sealing ring and a handgrip. The container closure system is considered suitable and qualified for its intended 
use. 
Stability  
The semaglutide active substance is stored frozen below or at -20°C, a shelf-life of 60 months is approved. 
All data for each test parameter from both supportive, primary and PPQ studies, when stored at -20°C ± 5°C, 
are within the acceptance criteria and shows no change over time. Furthermore, the batches have 
comparable trends. In addition, all data for each test parameter from both supportive, primary, and PPQ 
studies, when stored at accelerated condition at +5°C ± 3°C, shows no change over time. The batches have 
comparable trends.

2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product  
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development   
Description of the product 
Semaglutide 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.7 mg and 2.4 mg solution for injection (hereafter referred to as 
semaglutide finished products) are clear and colourless solutions filled in a pre-fillable syringe, with a filling 
volume of 0.5 mL (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg and 1 mg) or 0.75 ml (1.7 mg and 2.4 mg), assembled in a pen-injector.  
The semaglutide finished products comprise the following commonly used excipients: disodium phosphate 
dihydrate (buffering agent), sodium chloride (tonicity agent), hydrochloric acid (pH adjustment), sodium 
hydroxide (pH adjustment), and water for injections (solvent).  
The primary packaging is a 1 mL glass syringe barrel with a staked needle, rigid needle shield and a rubber 
plunger. The prefilled syringe is assembled in a DV3396 single dose pen-injector.  
Pharmaceutical development 
Finished product understanding has been achieved based on the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP), prior 
knowledge gained during the development of Ozempic, formulation development studies, and risk 
assessment of the manufacturing process.  
There were several changes to the formulation and drug-device combination (DDC) during clinical 
development. The semaglutide finished products for clinical trials contained slightly different semaglutide 
concentrations and were used with the multi-dose pen-injector known from Ozempic (PDS290). The primary 
packaging and excipients were also identical to Ozempic. Comparability of the different finished product 
formulations is demonstrated at the level of semaglutide related impurities and stability.  
The manufacturing process development is based on the manufacturing process of Ozempic. The 
manufacturing process has remained essentially the same from the manufacture of finished products for the 
clinical trials to the manufacturing process intended for the market.  
Extractable and leachable studies have been performed with the syringe components.  
The Applicant’s proposal for 36 months container closure integrity is supported by data. The semaglutide 
finished products are found to be compatible with the 1 mL syringe container closure system and the single-
dose pen-injector.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls  
Manufacture  
GMP compliance for all the sites involved in finished product manufacture and control was confirmed. 
Briefly, semaglutide active substance is dissolved in a solution containing all excipients and diluted with water 
for injections to obtain the desired weight. The pH is adjusted by adding diluted sodium hydroxide or diluted 
hydrochloric acid. The final solution is sterile filtered and filled aseptically into sterilised and depyrogenated 
syringes.  
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 21/177 
 
 
 
Assembly of the single dose pen-injector is achieved by inserting the prefilled syringe into the pen-injector’s 
front assembly, followed by insertion of the rear assembly. After final assembly, the single-dose pen-injector 
is labelled and packed before final release. The descriptions are sufficiently detailed.  
Process controls 
Critical steps and in-process controls (IPCs) have been assigned for the semaglutide finished products. The 
proposed actions for failing to meet acceptance criteria are considered acceptable. Adequate process controls 
are in place for the front and rear assembly and the final assembly. The dose accuracy of the finished 
products is controlled routinely. 
Process validation  
Validation activities have been performed to confirm that the manufacturing process for the semaglutide 
finished products is capable of consistently and reproducibly producing finished product of the required 
quality on a commercial manufacturing scale. The process validation activities encompass: a) Process 
justification, b) Process validation programme, and c) Ongoing process verification.  
The process justification was performed with scalable process parameters (batch size-independent) and non-
scalable process parameters (batch size-dependent and/or equipment specific).  
Based on the results from process validation it can be concluded that the manufacturing process for 
semaglutide finished product is in a validated state and suited for commercial production. 
The drug-device combination is assembled on a high volume, fully automatic assembly line. The assembly 
line is adequately validated. 
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis  
Specifications 
The specification for semaglutide finished products include control of identity, purity, bioactivity and other 
general tests. 
Analytical procedures 
Analytical procedures are described and validated according to relevant ICH guidelines or reference is made 
to compendial requirements (Ph. Eur.). 
Batch analyses 
Analyses of all relevant finished product batches are provided. The results are not reproduced in this report.  
Characterisation of impurities 
A characterisation study was conducted to characterise the semaglutide related impurities generated during 
the manufacture and storage of the semaglutide finished products.  
The risk assessment for elemental impurities in accordance with ICH Q3D guideline is considered approvable 
and the levels found were consistently below the permissible daily exposure (PDE) value based on the worst 
case finished product dosing.  
A risk evaluation concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product is 
provided and considered approvable. No additional testing is considered necessary.

Reference standards 
Reference is made to the active substance part. 
Container closure system 
The container closure system for the semaglutide finished products comprises the primary packaging and the 
DV3396 single dose pen-injector.  
The primary packaging is a 1 mL pre-fillable syringe with a syringe barrel made of type I borosilicate glass 
(Ph. Eur.), a stainless steel staked needle, a rigid needle shield where the rubber part is made of 
polyisoprene rubber-type II (Ph. Eur.), and a plunger made of chlorobutyl rubber-type I (Ph. Eur.). All of the 
above components have direct contact with the finished product. Extractable and leachable studies and 
container closure integrity testing were part of the finished product development studies. The syringe 
components are supplied sterile and ready-to-use. Sufficient documentation is provided.  
The PFSs are assembled with sub-assembled device components at the site. The device secondary functional 
packaging are not in direct contact with the semaglutide solution. Device operations are described in detail. 
The device components are identical for all to-be-marketed semaglutide finished products; there is, however 
a difference in the placement of the plunger rod to accommodate the dose volumes 0.5 mL and 0.75 mL.  
The DDCs have been tested in a usability study and are found to be safe and effective for intended users, 
intended use and use environments with regards to handling and differentiation. In addition, a Notified Body 
Opinion according to Article 117, Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on Medical Devices, confirming full compliance 
with the relevant general safety and performance requirements (GSPRs).  
Stability of the product  
The stability test programme for the semaglutide finished products is provided, also listing what data is 
available at the time of submission. The studies were performed according to current ICH guidelines.  
Thirty six months stability data is available for Ozempic (1.34 mg/ml semaglutide) and Wegovy finished 
products used in phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials, but with a slightly different formulation.  
All long term and accelerated stability studies were performed on semaglutide finished products in primary 
containers (1 mL syringe). A separate study is included in which 1 mL syringes from the primary stability 
batches are assembled in the DV3396 single dose pen-injector. The currently available stability data indicate 
that the assembly has no impact on the stability of the finished products. Long-term testing will continue up 
to 36 months.  
The proposed shelf-life for semaglutide finished products in the single-dose pen-injector is 24 months when 
stored refrigerated (2° to 8°C) in carton. This is supported by stability data and therefore approvable. The 
Applicant has provided results from ongoing studies of the to-be-marketed formulation in the proposed 
device as part of stability studies. The results so far support stable performance of dose accuracy of the 
combination product. The study will continue up to 36 months. 
An in-use stability time of 28 days below 30°C to allow storage outside the refrigerator before use is 
proposed. The Applicant has presented in-use stability data for the 1 mL PFS assembled in the single dose 
pen-injector. The results raise no issues. The study was performed at the end of the currently proposed shelf 
life of 24 months. The Applicant confirms that the study will continue until 36 months.

Post approval change management protocol(s)  
A post-approval change management protocol (PACMP) is included to add a second manufacturing site for the 
finished product. The contents of the PACMP are well aligned with those recently accepted for additional 
finished product facilities for Ozempic and are considered acceptable.  
Adventitious agents  
The semaglutide precursor peptide is produced from a yeast strain. Yeast is not a host for mammalian 
viruses. The cell line has been tested for microbial purity. As no further raw materials or excipients of human 
or animal origin are used for the manufacture of semaglutide, the finished products are evaluated to be safe 
regarding TSE agents and there is no risk of contaminating the product with mammalian viruses. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The active substance section of the dossier is identical to the approved Ozempic dossier (with the exception 
of minor updates) and is therefore considered approvable.  
Finished products used in clinical trials were similar to Ozempic regarding the excipients, container closure 
system and DDC, but the to-be-marketed products are used with a single dose pen-injector and a 
formulation optimised for single use.  
The finished product manufacturing process is straightforward and sufficiently described. Process 
characterisation/justification studies and PPQ studies generally support the process ranges/limits and product 
intermediate holding times.

CHMP recommends a point for investigation. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects  
2.5.1.  Pharmacology  
Semaglutide is a long-acting human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, which specifically 
activates the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R). Semaglutide is an Aib8, Arg34-GLP-1(7-37) analogue substituted with 
a side chain on the lysine residue in position 26. The side chain consists of two ADO (8-amino-3,6-
dioxaoctanoic acid) spacers, one γ-glutamic acid (Glu) spacer, and a fatty diacid (1,18-octadecanedioic acid). 
Semaglutide is produced using recombinant DNA technology in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and 
chemical modification. Semaglutide has a 94% structural homology to native GLP-1, a molecular weight of 
4113,58 g/mol and is good soluble in an aqueous solution. Semaglutide is suitable for once-weekly 
administration in humans.  
The pharmacological mechanism of GLP-1R agonists is well described in the literature, with blood glucose-
lowering and body fat loss mediated by lowered intake of calories. The primary pharmacological target 
tissues for GLP-1R agonists are the pancreas (beta-cells), the gastrointestinal system and the brain. The 
amino acid sequence of GLP-1 is preserved in mammals, and only one receptor, the GLP-1R, has been 
identified. Rat and human GLP-1R have 90% homology, and monkey and human 99%. The GLP-1R is a G-
protein coupled receptor, and the cellular action of GLP-1 is mediated through the G-protein and subsequent 
activation of adenylate cyclase, leading to increased cAMP accumulation. 
2.5.1.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cell membranes, stably expressing the human GLP-1 receptor, were used to 
characterize the in vitro pharmacological receptor effect of semaglutide using binding and functional studies 
on the human GLP-1 receptor. The binding affinity of semaglutide to the GLP-1 receptor in the membrane 
preparation, was found to be influenced by albumin concentrations.  
The results of the functional, receptor activating, studies, measuring cAMP production, showed that 
semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist with a potency of 0.15 nM, which is comparable to liraglutide and 8-
fold less potent than GLP-1 itself.  
In an ex vivo study using rat isolated perfused pancreas, semaglutide stimulated insulin secretion dose-
dependently. Two pancreas preparations were studied with increasing concentration of semaglutide, and the 
EC50 of insulin secretion was estimated to be ~14 nM.  
The primary pharmacodynamic effect was evaluated in a number of animal models.  
In normal male rats, the in vivo potency was estimated by dosing semaglutide subcutaneously (sc) followed 
by an i.v. glucose infusion 3 hrs later. Semaglutide stimulated plasma insulin secretion and lowered blood 
glucose at a dose of 123 μg/kg (~6 nM plasma exposure), and a trend towards stimulation was observed at 
41 μg/kg.  
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 25/177 
 
 
 
 
In male diabetic db/db mice, upon single or repeated 4-week sc dosing, semaglutide lowered blood glucose 
dose-dependently and had a long duration of action. The ED50 for lowering of blood glucose (6 hours post-
dosing) was estimated to be 1.2 μg/kg for semaglutide, whereas it was about 20-fold higher for liraglutide, 
indicating that semaglutide was more potent in vivo than liraglutide. The maximal effect on blood glucose-
lowering was comparable for semaglutide and liraglutide, and was obtained at 4 - 8 μg/kg for semaglutide in 
the 4-week study. The effect on body weight was maximal at a dose of 21 μg/kg.  
The beta-cell-reduced Göttingen minipig is a model in which the human conditions of impaired glucose 
tolerance are mimicked and resembles humans than rodent models. This model was used for the evaluation 
of the duration of action of GLP-1R agonists. In a hyperglycaemic clamp study in beta-cell-reduced minipigs, 
semaglutide stimulated insulin secretion for up to 7 days after the last dose (8.2 μg/kg) was administered.  
GLP-1 and its analogues are, among other effects, able to reduce food intake, which is an important aspect in 
the treatment of obesity and diabetes. The subchronic efficacy of semaglutide on body weight reduction was 
evaluated in diet-induced obese (DIO) aged female rats, which were given chocolate in addition to normal 
chow for 9 months. Subcutaneous doses of 1.2 and 4.1 μg/kg once-daily for 77 days led to a dose-
dependent, significant decrease in body weight, primarily from fat. Furthermore, semaglutide dose-
dependently decreased overall food intake, which mainly consisted of chocolate. Leptin, total cholesterol, and 
free fatty acids were significantly decreased after treatment with semaglutide, while plasma glucose, HbA1c, 
insulin, glucagon and triglycerides were not changed.  
The effects of semaglutide on hypothalamic appetite signals were evaluated in high-fat diet obese (DIO) 
mice. Dosing of semaglutide for 18 days (0.15 mg/kg, s.c., daily) significantly lowered body weight. This was 
associated with increased mRNA expression of the satiety peptide cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated 
transcript (CART) in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) in the hypothalamus. Expression levels of the hunger peptides 
neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Agouti-related peptide (AGRP) in the ARC in the hypothalamus were not different 
between semaglutide and vehicle but were lower than in the weight-matched vehicle group.  
The effect and duration of semaglutide on lowering food intake were also studied in young, growing pigs. 
Steady-state plasma levels of semaglutide were achieved by dosing every other day at 21 μg/kg. When 
steady-state had been reached, dosing was stopped, and daily food intake was assessed. Semaglutide 
decreased food intake in pigs for at least 2 days after cessation of dosing. The potency of semaglutide for 
decreasing food intake was in magnitude comparable to liraglutide in pigs, but with a longer duration of 
action.  
The access and neuronal interaction of semaglutide in the rodent (SD rat, C57BL mice) brain were 
investigated using peripherally administered fluorescently labelled semaglutide. Semaglutide was shown to 
have access to discrete brain regions expressing the GLP-1R, including some well-defined circumventricular 
organs. Fluorescently labelled semaglutide also gained access to brain regions protected by the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB), such as NTS (nucleus tractus solitarus) in the brain stem and in the hypothalamus, where it 
was present in CART positive neurons in the ARC. The fluorescent signal was lost in the GLP-1R Knock-Out 
(KO) mouse, suggesting dependence upon binding to the GLP-1 receptor. Electrophysiological measurements 
of mouse brain slices revealed that semaglutide (100 nM) directly stimulated Pro-opiomelanocortin 
(POMC)/CART neurons and indirectly inhibited neural activity in neurons expressing NPY. 
The effect of semaglutide on the development of atherosclerosis was investigated in two 
hypercholesterolemic mouse models, the ApoE- and LDL-receptor KO mouse models, at sc doses of 4, 12 and 
60 μg/kg administered once-daily for 13 or 17 weeks, respectively. These models are widely used to study 
Assessment report

Page 26/177 
 
 
 
plaque formation when on a western diet (WD) consisting of high fat and carbohydrate content and 0.2% 
cholesterol. 
In the LDLr KO mouse model, semaglutide showed a significant, about two-third, reduction of aortic plaque 
area at all three dose levels tested. This effect was accompanied by a significantly reduced body weight gain 
and a reduction in plasma TG levels with the highest dose, while plasma cholesterol and cholesterol 
lipoprotein levels were not changed by semaglutide treatment. 
In the ApoE KO mouse, semaglutide treatment showed a significant attenuation of aortic plaque area at all 
three dose levels tested after 13 weeks of daily treatment. This effect was accompanied by a significantly 
reduced body weight gain with all doses.  
In conclusion, the development of WD-induced aortic plaque lesion areas was attenuated by semaglutide in 
both KO models at all dose levels. The effect was partially independent of reduced body weight gain. 
In conclusion, the efficacy pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo in 
normal, diabetic and obese rodent models and normal pigs and minipigs. The studies have shown that 
semaglutide has pharmacological properties consistent with a GLP-1R agonist showing increases in insulin 
secretion, plasma glucose-lowering and weight lowering due to reduced food intake. 
Semaglutide for weight management 
In support of the present indication for weight management, two new studies were performed to evaluate the 
mechanism of action of semaglutide in the brain concerning weight loss.   
Semaglutide had access to distinct brain regions expressing the GLP-1R, including the circumventricular 
organs not protected by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Semaglutide also reached select GLP-1R populations 
in brain regions protected by the BBB. These included several nuclei in the brain stem (in the NTS and the 
dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMX)) and in the hypothalamus (in the arcuate nucleus (ARH), 
among others). The access of fluorescent semaglutide to these sites contributes to the idea that the brain 
stem and hypothalamus are important regions for GLP-1R agonists central effects to regulate homeostatic 
food intake. In addition, fluorescent semaglutide was observed in the septum, including the lateral septal 
nucleus (LS).  
The administration of semaglutide resulted in the activation of some brain regions as measured by increased 
expression of immediate early gene cFos. It should be noted that cFos expression does not specifically means 
GLP-1R activation, but rather general neuronal activation. cFos expression was seen in the circumventricular 
organs and the area postrema (AP) and the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) in the brain stem, areas known 
to be involved in regulating body weight. Further, deeper brain regions that were not directly targeted by 
semaglutide were positive for cFos, which included the parabrachial nucleus (PB), the midline group of the 
dorsal thalamus (MTN), bed nuclei of the stria terminalis (BST), and the central amygdala nucleus (CeA). 
These are areas associated with energy homeostasis and reward, and are potentially indirectly activated via 
projections from the brain stem, septum or hypothalamus. However, activation of these areas seems not 
solely mediated by semaglutide since the access of semaglutide or direct GLP-1R activation in these areas 
was not confirmed in these studies. Hence, the role of semaglutide for the proposed projections remains a 
theoretical possibility. In the cFos positive PB, a population of cells in the dorsal lateral nuclei was positive for 
neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). As CGRP acts as an appetite suppressant in mice, this 
area might play a role in regulating food intake. However, the potential relevance for humans seems limited. 
Overall, it was confirmed that semaglutide crosses the BBB and that its effects include central homeostatic 
mechanisms involving the hypothalamus and brain stem. Evidence for the direct involvement of the hedonic

system is limited, yet supported by semaglutide access to the septum. More evidence suggestive of the 
involvement of reward-related brain regions in the hedonic regulation of food intake included activation of 
deeper brain regions, possibly indirectly via projections from the homeostatic system that were directly 
accessible for semaglutide. 
2.5.1.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies  
A broad profiling screening panel using 68 biochemical receptors, ion-channels and neurotransmitter 
transporters did not show a competitive interaction with semaglutide. Also, semaglutide, up to 10 μM, did not 
activate the glucagon receptor. No secondary pharmacology effects are expected from semaglutide. 
2.5.1.3.  Safety pharmacology programme  
The safety pharmacology studies were designed to investigate the effect of semaglutide on major organ 
function (central nervous system, respiratory system and cardiovascular system). Exposure measurements in 
both the rat CNS study and the cynomolgus monkey cardiovascular study exposure of treated animals 
confirmed exposure of treated animals could correlate to exposure. Due to differences in dosing frequency 
between humans (once weekly) and animals (daily/biweekly), the mean maximal plasma concentration 
(Cmax) at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2.4 mg/week has been used for exposure 
comparison in the safety pharmacology section. A value of ~75 nM has been taken as the mean Cmax in 
humans at MRHD. 
The effect of semaglutide on the central nervous system was studied in the rat CNS (Irwin) study. In this 
study, no significant gross behavioural or physiological changes were observed during the 24 h post-dose 
period in rats receiving subcutaneous treatment with semaglutide. Abnormal gait (walking on toes), passivity, 
decreased touch response, increased urination, lethargy and piloerection were observed in animals 
administered 95 μg/kg semaglutide, which corresponds to ~0.6 fold the maximal plasma (Cmax) exposure at 
the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). The observed effects are considered pharmacology-
related and likely due to the activity at GLP-1 receptors in the CNS. The No Observed Adverse Effect Level 
(NOAEL) was determined to be 22 μg/kg. 
Semaglutide, given subcutaneously at doses up to 84 μg/kg, had no statistically significant effects on 
respiratory rate, tidal volume or minute volume up to 24 hours after dosing in male SD rats.  
Treatment with semaglutide (>100-fold higher concentration than the mean maximal plasma concentration 
at the MRHD) produced no inhibition of hERG channel tail current recorded in HEK293 cells stably transfected 
with hERG cDNA, nor an effect on action potential parameters in isolated female rabbit Purkinje fibres. This 
indicates that semaglutide has a low potential for QT prolongation. 
The acute effect of semaglutide on cardiovascular function was studied in male conscious unrestrained 
cynomolgus monkeys equipped with telemetry transmitters and dosed subcutaneously with ascending doses 
of semaglutide. No effects related to semaglutide were observed on arterial blood pressure (systolic, diastolic 
and mean) or the lead II ECG variables examined (RR, PR, QR, QTcF and QTcQ intervals or QRS duration). In 
conclusion, it was found that there were no clinically relevant findings in cynomolgus monkeys in single doses 
up to 470 μg/kg (about 6-fold above MRHD based on Cmax). 
In addition, in the repeat dose toxicology study at week 13, 26 and 52, the cardiac electrophysiology was 
monitored by ECG in male and female telemetered cynomolgus monkeys (10, 60 and 360 μg/kg twice-weekly 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 28/177 
 
 
 
sc). In this 52-week toxicity monkey study, a left-bundle-branch-block was observed in one female animal at 
high dose of 360 μg/kg (~10-fold above MRHD). The animal exhibited no clinical signs attributable to the 
ECG finding and histopathology revealed no correlating changes. Cardiac bundle-branch blocks are an 
occasional finding in monkeys and humans, and are in most cases a consequence of other underlying cardiac 
diseases. Although histopathology revealed no changes in the heart, the ECG finding was considered adverse. 
When heart rate was analysed as a change from baseline, it was shown that there seems to be a transient 
increase in heart rate at week 26, which returns to baseline values at week 52 in males but remains elevated 
at week 52 in high dose females. This finding supports the increase in heart rate seen in patients in the 
clinical trials. 
A renal function study was performed to evaluate the acute effects of semaglutide on the renal system in the 
rat. Semaglutide caused an acute transient increase in diuresis during the first 8 hours after dosing at the 
highest doses (23 and 89 μg/kg) and a decrease in the diuresis parameters thereafter. These observations 
are well-known effects of GLP-1R agonists in the rat. Acute effects on diuresis have also been shown in 
humans with native GLP-1, but not following chronic administration of GLP-1R agonists. The NOAEL was 
determined to be 5 μg/kg. 
2.5.1.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions  
Nonclinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have not been conducted with semaglutide, which is 
agreed upon. GLP-1R agonists have been reported to delay gastric emptying but this was evaluated in clinical 
trials. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Methods of analysis 
The methods developed for the analysis of semaglutide in plasma with LC-MS/MS (mouse, rat, monkey) and 
ELISA (mouse, rabbit, monkey) were sufficiently validated with satisfactory assay performance.  
The LOCI assay was affected by interference from the plasma matrix and dilution linearity issues with a larger 
impact on low concentrations, leading to underestimating semaglutide exposures (rat, rabbit, monkey). For 
this reason, the plasma assay in rat and monkey was replaced by LC-MS/MS and ELISA. In the rabbit 
embryo-foetal development study (207360), the measured concentration was below 200 nM, where Hook 
effect occurred, and the values for dose-normalized average concentrations (Cavg) did not deviate from the 
other tests. 
Absorption 
Single dose absorption and plasma pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional, and there was no gender dependency. The absorption of 
Semaglutide from the subcutaneous injection site was rapid in mouse and rat, but slower in rabbit, monkey 
and minipig. The time to maximum concentration (tmax) was 2 to 3 hours in mouse and rat, and about 24 
hours in rabbit, monkey and minipig. The bioavailability ranged from 86% (monkey) to 94% (minipig). In 
human, the bioavailability was equally high (89%), but the absorption was slower (tmax 60 h). 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 29/177 
 
 
 
 
The mean dose-normalized concentration was comparable in monkey and human, while it was lower in 
mouse, rabbit and rat due to faster clearance. The terminal half-life was estimated to be 8 h in the mouse, 11 
hr in the rat, 28 h in the rabbit, 51 h in the monkey and 148 h in human. 
The distribution volume was low (0.2 L/kg) following i.v. administration in the monkey, which corresponds 
approximately to the volume of extracellular water, indicates that a high fraction of semaglutide is circulating 
in plasma and extracellular fluid. 
Comparing single-dose pharmacokinetics in monkeys after subcutaneous and intravenous dosing indicated 
that the absorption rate from subcutis does not limit elimination. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding  
In-vitro binding studies showed that the plasma protein binding was high, >99%, and that albumin was the 
primary protein responsible for binding of semaglutide in plasma. The potential binding to other plasma 
proteins has not been studied. The fraction unbound was somewhat lower in plasma from mouse, rat and 
rabbit (0.07-0.28%) as compared to plasma from monkey (0.46%) and human (0.36%). 
Distribution to red blood cells 
As determined in rats, whole blood concentrations of semaglutide-related material were approximately half of 
the values in plasma, suggesting no preferential uptake into red cells. 
Tissue distribution 
Distribution studies in rats showed the highest presence of semaglutide-related material in blood and in 
highly perfused tissues. 
After subcutaneous administration of [3H]-Oct- or [3H]-Tyr-labelled semaglutide, the tissue-to-blood ratios of 
semaglutide related material were generally below 1. The highest levels were associated with lung, tooth 
pulp, kidney (cortex and medulla), bladder, adrenal medulla and uterus. The high levels in the bile ducts, up 
to and including 3 days after dosing, suggests that biliary secretion may have played an important role in 
elimination by contributing to faecal excretion. In addition, the moderate levels of radioactivity present in the 
kidneys and bladder also suggest that urinary elimination occurred. The lowest concentrations were present 
in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and white fat. 
The distribution and concentrations of [3H]-Oct-semaglutide related material in male pigmented rats were 
similar to that in male albino rats, suggesting that semaglutide related material does not bind to melanin or 
accumulate in pigmented tissues. 
Placenta transfer 
Semaglutide related material passed the placental barrier in rats and rabbits, but distributed to foetal tissue 
at levels lower than in dam plasma (<4%). This suggests limited distribution across the placenta. 
Nevertheless, a single dose of semaglutide to pregnant rats at GD18, led to low, but measurable levels in 
foetuses at 24h post-dose and effects on the foetus were observed. 
Excretion into milk 
Semaglutide and metabolites are excreted into rat milk. Mean concentrations were 3-12 times lower than in 
plasma up to 24 hours after a subcutaneous dose 0.3 mg/kg/day semaglutide. There are no data on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 30/177 
 
 
 
 
excretion of semaglutide in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Semaglutide 
should not be used during breastfeeding. 
Metabolism 
The in-vitro metabolism of radiolabelled semaglutide was studied in hepatocytes from rats, monkeys and 
humans. Limited metabolism was observed in all species, and no unique human metabolites were formed. It 
was shown that semaglutide is metabolised by proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone by neutral 
endopeptidase (neprilysin) and sequential beta-oxidation of the fatty acid side chain.  
The in-vivo metabolism of semaglutide was investigated by chromatographic metabolite profiling of plasma, 
urine and faeces from rat, monkey and human following administration of radiolabelled semaglutide. The 
metabolite profiles from plasma were similar across species. The peptide backbone of semaglutide was 
metabolised by proteolytic degradation, and the fatty acid moiety was degraded by sequential beta-oxidation.  
Semaglutide was the most abundant component in plasma across animal species, accounting for 69-93% of 
the total amount of semaglutide related material and 4 to 12 metabolites, which constituted only a small part 
concerning the amount unchanged semaglutide.  
In human plasma, there were 6 metabolites, each contributing 0.4-7.7% to the total amount of semaglutide-
related material, whereas the contribution of unchanged semaglutide was 83%. The largest metabolite (P3) 
contained at least three components (P3A, P3B and P3C). P3C was characterised as a semaglutide isomer. 
P3B was identified as a peptide metabolite from semaglutide, following proteolytic cleavage and the loss of 
the first 13 amino acids. Neprilysin was capable of forming the metabolite P3B in vitro. No further structural 
information could be provided P3A and P3C, due to the limited amounts in plasma. All human metabolites are 
also present in rats, and P3, P5 and P7 are also present in monkeys.  
The two primary metabolites in human (U6 and U7) were identified as the free Lys26 amino acid bound to 
the ADO-linker with butyric (C4) or hexanoic (C6) di-acid side chains attached. These metabolites are 
products formed from full proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone with sequential removal of C2-units 
by beta-oxidation of the di-fatty acid side chain. The urine metabolite U22 was identified as semaglutide. 
Only limited amounts of unchanged semaglutide were observed in urine of animals (1%) and humans (3%). 
The pharmacological activity of the metabolites has not been evaluated. These metabolites, such as P3B and 
P3C, may be pharmacologically active since they have structural similarities with semaglutide. The possible 
contribution of these metabolites to the pharmacological activity of the final product will be minor, because in 
plasma they are only a small part in relation to the amount of unchanged semaglutide (< 7.7%). 
Excretion 
Semaglutide was extensively metabolised prior to elimination. In human, unchanged semaglutide were 
observed in small amounts in human urine (3.1%), but was not detected in faeces. In rat and monkey, both 
urine and faeces were equally important as excretion routes of semaglutide and related material. The 
contribution of urinary excretion was 37% in rats and 30% in monkey, whereas the contribution of faecal 
excretion was 35% and 21% in these species, respectively. In human, the urinary excretion was the 
predominant route of excretion (53%), followed by faeces (18.6%). 
In bile-cannulated rats, bile was the primary route for excretion of semaglutide-related material into faeces 
(48%), of which approximately 14% was unchanged semaglutide. Other components in bile were

metabolites, each accounting for less than 5% of the administered dose. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
The results of the in-vitro and in-vivo studies on the drug interaction potential of semaglutide have been 
evaluated in the clinical assessment report. 
2.5.3.  Toxicology  
2.5.3.1.  Single dose toxicity  
A single dose up to 12mg/kg (mouse) or 7.532 mg/kg (rat) was generally well tolerated. Observed major 
findings such as reduced body weight and food intake showed quick recovery and can be related to the 
pharmacological action of semaglutide. 
2.5.3.2.  Repeat dose toxicity  
Repeated dose studies in mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys revealed mainly effects related to the 
pharmacological action of semaglutide. Reduction in food intake and body weight gain were dose-limiting, as 
exceeding the maximum tolerated dose in monkeys led to dehydration, consequently followed by 
euthanization. However, dose escalation improves tolerability. 
Hypertrophy of Brunner’s glands of the duodenum was observed in rats after 26 weeks of treatment. This 
effect is likely due to the high expression of GLP-1R on Brunner’s glands. However, there was no progression 
to hyper- or neoplasia in the rodent carcinogenicity studies, and no similar observations in cynomolgus 
monkeys dosed for 52 weeks. Therefore, this observation is not considered a safety concern in humans. 
Thyroid C-cell hyperplasia was only observed in mice at all dose levels. This is an expected result also seen 
with other GLP-1 agonists and can be considered a class effect.  
The 52-week monkey study revealed a chronic left bundle-branch-block in one high dose female. Although 
the abnormal ECG was confined to a single animal, the observation was considered adverse.  
An increase in uterus fluid distension and luminal dilatation is seen in rats after 26 weeks of dosing. These 
findings are likely due to differences in the stage of the sexual cycle which could be treatment-related, and 
likely secondary to a reduction in body weight. Daily subcutaneous administration to Sprague-Dawley rats 
over a treatment period of 13 weeks with 0.48 mg/kg/day and 0.45 mg/kg/day semaglutide, respectively, 
demonstrated generally similar observations between two formulations based on two different manufacturing 
processes. Although there were a few minor differences, none was considered of any toxicological 
significance. 
2.5.3.3.  Genotoxicity  
Semaglutide is not genotoxic in vitro or in vivo. 
2.5.3.4.  Carcinogenicity  
In carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats, thyroid C-cell adenomas and carcinomas were observed at all 
Assessment report

dose levels. This is an expected result also seen with other GLP-1 agonists and can be considered a class 
effect. No other tumours were found. Other non-neoplastic effects were secondary to the decreased body 
weight gain related to the pharmacological action of semaglutide. To determine whether the thyroid C-cell 
tumours are indeed caused by the same mechanism as is responsible for C-cell tumours observed after 
treatment with GLP-1 agonists, the applicant performed some mechanistic studies. The activation of the GLP-
1R was tested in vitro on a thyroid C-cell tumour cell line and compared to GLP-1, exenatide and liraglutide. 
It was shown that the potency of semaglutide to activate the receptor was similar to liraglutide, and less 
potent than GLP-1 and exenatide. 
Increased plasma calcitonin concentration is considered a marker for increased activation of GLP-1R on the 
thyroid C-cells. Upon chronic activation, this leads to up-regulation of calcitonin synthesis and further to C-
cell proliferation and tumour formation. Therefore, the applicant performed in vivo studies in mice and rats, 
which show that even after a single 1 mg/kg dose of semaglutide in mice, plasma calcitonin levels were 
increased 12 and 24 hours after injection. However, in rats, an increased calcitonin level was not seen in 
females and not very convincingly in males after 6 weeks of treatment. This could be due to the very short 
half-life of calcitonin in rats of 4 minutes or a delayed effect which is still not apparent after 6 weeks. Further, 
an inconsistent effect on calcitonin levels in rats was also seen for liraglutide. Overall, the mechanism of 
formation of rodent thyroid C-cell tumours is well known and discussed in the public literature. There is no 
reason to suggest a different mechanism might be responsible for the C-cell tumours observed after 
treatment with semaglutide, and therefore the thyroid C-cell tumours are likely rodent specific. Since 
relevance for humans cannot be completely ruled out, thyroid C-cell tumours are listed in the RMP as 
potential risk. 
2.5.3.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity  
Semaglutide caused embryotoxicity in the rat. The observed effects included embryo-foetal mortality, growth 
retardation, and skeletal and visceral abnormalities. The effects were observed at dose levels of 0.03 
mg/kg/day and above, with AUC exposures below the clinical exposure at the MRHD of 2.4 mg/week. The 
applicant describes a mechanism of action for the embryotoxic effects observed in the rat reproduction study, 
which involves the presence of GLP-1R on the yolk sac. Semaglutide binds to the receptors on the yolk sac, 
leading to inhibition of transport of nutrients across the membrane. This mechanism is likely rat specific, 
since rat embryos are dependent on the yolk sac for their nutrient supply which is, e.g. less important in 
other species including humans and monkeys. Moreover, GLP-1R is not expressed on monkey yolk sacs.  
It is agreed that the mechanism demonstrated is specific for rats, and could explain the malformations seen 
in the rat foetuses. Although undoubtedly this mechanism is responsible for most of the malformations 
observed, it cannot be excluded that other mechanisms that may not be rat specific are also involved. This is 
based on the fact that not only more and other malformations are present, but also foetal weight is much 
further reduced in embryos of dams treated up to GD17 as compared to GD13. This is after the period 
(GD12) in which embryos are solely dependent on the yolk sac for nutrition, but also rely on the developing 
chorioallantoic placenta. Although the additional skeletal abnormalities that occur between GD13 and GD17 
could still be due to the impaired yolk sac, due to the presence of the GLP-1R on the rat embryo from GD13.5 
and the presence of low levels of semaglutide in the foetus as measured on GD20, a direct effect of 
semaglutide on the foetus, of which the clinical relevance is unknown, cannot be excluded. It appears that a 
potential direct effect of semaglutide is only relevant in the later stages of pregnancy in rats, since the 
receptor is not present before GD13.5. Timing of receptor expression, if this is relevant for humans at all, is 
unknown, but a potential risk for humans is mitigated through the labelling in SmPC section 4.6, where it is

stated that semaglutide should not be used during pregnancy and women of childbearing potential should use 
contraception to avoid unplanned pregnancies. Any further risk mitigation measures are not warranted.  
A second embryo-foetal toxicity study was performed in rabbits. Once-daily SC administration of semaglutide 
to pregnant New Zealand White rabbits markedly reduced maternal body weight and food consumption. This 
coincided with increased post-implantation losses, incomplete ossification of foetal metacarpals/phalanges, 
and increased incidences of minor skeletal and visceral foetal abnormalities. The increased post-implantation 
losses and the foetal pathology findings were possibly secondary to the marked maternal effects, but a direct 
effect of semaglutide could not be excluded. On the other hand, marked maternal toxicity could also mask a 
direct effect on the embryo or foetus. Although exposure in the high dose group at GD19 was above the 
human exposure, it was below human exposure at GD6. The Applicant attributes the observations in the 
rabbit as described above, primarily to the maternal effects on body weight and food consumption. Delayed 
ossification observed without concomitant decreases in foetal body weight may warrant increased attention 
(Carney and Kimmel 2007). However, as the mid and high-dose dams showed lower body weight gains on 
GD 6-19, and higher than control body weight gains on GD 20-29, any decreased foetal body weights in the 
mid and high dose groups may have been recovered at termination of the study when the foetal 
examinations were performed.  
Cynomolgus monkeys were used as a third species for embryo-toxicity testing of semaglutide, since monkeys 
do not rely on a yolk sac for nutrition. In all dose groups, the pregnant females had an initial loss of body 
weight, and a lower body weight gain as compared to control animals. There were 2 cases of abortion in all 
dose groups as compared to 1 in the control group. The incidence of 2 out of 16 (12.5%) is close to the 
incidence of pregnancy loss in cynomolgus monkey controls reported in literature of 11.5% up to GD75 
(Jarvis et al, Birth Defects Research (Part B) 89:175–187 (2010)). 
Further, two major malformations were reported in the study. In the mid-dose group, a single foetus had a 
fused kidney, and in the high dose group, there was one foetus with a misshapen brain. These effects have 
not previously been reported in historical controls from the same testing site. However, a relevance for 
humans is unlikely due to the lack of a mechanistic relation to semaglutide and lack of similar findings in 
other studies. Moreover, any potential risk is mitigated through the labelling in SmPC section 4.6.  
There was no effect on postnatal development in offspring of cynomolgus monkeys treated with semaglutide 
until GD140. Initial maternal body weight losses likely led to an increased incidence of early pregnancy loss 
and reduced foetal weight in the mid and high dose. No other effects were observed.  
A juvenile study was performed where rats from the age of 21 days were dosed for 11 weeks. Apart from 
general signs of toxicity, sexual maturation and fertility were investigated. Sexual maturation was delayed for 
both sexes, but this did not coincide with effects on fertility or mating performance. No histopathological 
findings were noted, and therefore it is considered likely that the delay is due to the decreased body weight 
gain of the treated animals. No new findings were seen in these juvenile animals that were not seen in the 
adult animals. This study is of limited relevance in the current procedure, as the indication applied for is in 
adults only. 
2.5.3.6.  Toxicokinetic data  
The pharmacokinetics following repeated dosing of subcutaneous semaglutide showed a linear relationship 
between doses and exposures. No gender differences were noted. The dose normalised exposure was 
generally lower for mice, rats, rabbits and minipigs compared to monkeys and humans due to faster 
clearance. To ensure continued exposure, and to mimic the once-weekly exposure profile in humans, once-

daily dosing was used in mice and rats, and twice-weekly dosing was used in monkeys. At these dose 
intervals, there was no apparent (i.e. < 2-fold) systemic accumulation.  
No difference in exposure was observed between pregnant and non-pregnant animals following repeated 
administration of semaglutide to rats, rabbits and monkeys. However, rabbits showed some accumulation in 
the embryofoetal development study, but the wide range (1.3 up to 13-fold) and the few data do not permit 
a clear conclusion.  
2.5.3.7.  Local Tolerance  
In a local toxicity study in pigs using the subcutaneous route of administration only mild effects related to the 
vehicle or injection procedure were seen. Further, in all pivotal toxicity studies the subcutaneous route of 
administration was applied, and therefore local toxicity is considered sufficiently investigated and no concerns 
for human safety were identified.  
In clinical practise it is possible that the product will be administered by intravenous, intra-arterial or 
intramuscular routes by mistake. Therefore, possible adverse effects were investigated in rabbits using these 
routes of administration. No adverse effects were seen other than mild effects related to the vehicle or 
injection procedure. 
2.5.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment  
The active substance is a peptide. Therefore, semaglutide is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.5.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects  
In support of the present indication for weight management, two new studies were performed to evaluate the 
mechanism of action of semaglutide in the brain in relation to weight loss.  
It was confirmed that semaglutide crosses the BBB, and that its effects include central homeostatic 
mechanisms involving the hypothalamus and brain stem. Evidence for the direct involvement of the hedonic 
system is limited, yet supported by semaglutide access to the septum. More evidence suggestive of the 
involvement of reward-related brain regions in the hedonic regulation of food intake included activation of 
deeper brain regions, possibly indirectly via projections from the homeostatic system that were directly 
accessible for semaglutide. 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of 
the substance in the environment. Therefore, semaglutide is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.5.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects  
The pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology programs are considered 
sufficient.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology  
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics of semaglutide up to a s.c. dose of 2.4 mg were extensively characterised during the 
weight management and T2D clinical pharmacology programme. 
Semaglutide pharmacokinetics profile is suitable for once-weekly subcutaneous administration due to the 
prolonged-release characteristics (e.g. albumin binding, slow-release from subcutis and reduced degradation 
by enzymes).  
Semaglutide should be carefully up-titrated due to the occurrence of GI-adverse effects. An exposure-
response relationship was observed for gastrointestinal adverse events, but tolerance for gastrointestinal 
adverse events develops over time. Therefore, it is recommended to escalate the dose every 4 weeks. 
Methods 
During the weight management program, appropriately validated LC-MS/MS assays were used to analyse 
semaglutide in plasma. Assay interference was not detected in hyperlipidaemic matrix.  
A multi-tiered approach has been used to assess the anti-semaglutide and neutralizing antibodies. In general, 
the assay validation was adequately performed, and no lipemic interference was detected in the 
immunogenicity assays. The employed four-tiered strategy, including a screening, confirmatory, cross 
reactivity to endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and neutralization assay, agrees with the draft 
Guideline on Immunogenicity assessment of biotechnology-derived therapeutic proteins 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev. 1). Confirmatory and cross-reactivity cut points were determined to 
8.0455, 23.78 and 19.03, respectively, in obese matrix and at 100 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL antibody. The ADA 
assay had some limitations. Drug tolerance was demonstrated up to 2 nM semaglutide for detection of 100

ng/mL ADA, respectively, for obese. However, at steady-state semaglutide concentrations of above 100 nM 
were reached at the 2.4 mg maintenance dose. Although the ADA assay was able to detect high levels of 
ADAs (>500 ng/mL) in presence of >100 nM semaglutide, sensitivity was not shown for lower levels of ADAs, 
so false negatives cannot be excluded. 
In the previously conducted studies in the T2D clinical pharmacology programme, the same or very similar 
LC-MS/MS assays were used to analyse semaglutide in plasma and urine. Further, in some early studies of 
the T2D clinical pharmacology programme, bioanalytical LOCI assay has been used to detect semaglutide in 
plasma. 
The plasma concentration-time data for semaglutide were analysed by non-compartmental methods and 
standard pharmacokinetic parameters have been calculated (AUC0 168h, Cmax, tmax, CL/F, t½ and Vss/F). 
Descriptive statistics of PK variables and power calculations have been provided. In the studies 4590 and 
NN9535-4588, bioequivalence was assessed for the endpoints Cmax,ss and AUC0-168h (log-transformed) and 
analysed separately using an ANCOVA model with treatment (semaglutide/single-dose pen-injector and 
semaglutide/PDS290 pen-injector) and stratification category (body weight 70.0−99.9 kg or 100.0−130.0 
kg) as factors and the logarithm of body weight as a covariate. 
Dose-proportionality between semaglutide 1.0 mg and 2.4 mg doses was assessed separately. The ratio AUC0 
168h,2.4 mg/AUC0-168h,1.0mg was estimated with 95% CI. The same analysis was done for Cmax. 
In the T2D clinical pharmacology programme, the plasma concentration-time data for semaglutide were 
analysed by non-compartmental methods, and standard pharmacokinetic parameters have been calculated. 
Descriptive statistics of PK variables and power calculations have been provided for all PK/PD studies. In 
general, the pharmacokinetic endpoints were analysed and compared between treatments using normal 
linear models (ANCOVA) with the log-transformed endpoint as the dependent variable. Fixed and random 
factors were taken into account as independent variables. The software used to calculate and compare the 
pharmacokinetic parameters in the clinical trials was Kinetica or SAS release 9 or higher on a UNIX platform. 
The applicant submitted two population pharmacokinetic models. The initial was a one-compartment model 
based on pharmacokinetic samples (mainly through samples, collected at about 168h since last dose) 
obtained in the STEP1 and STEP2 phase 3 trials. The objectives were to evaluate the dose proportionality of 
the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide and the impact of covariates on semaglutide exposure. An updated 
population model was provided upon request, as the initial model was based on sparse data only. A limited 
amount of rich data included in the new 2-compartment analysis.  
The initial model had a one-compartment structure with first-order absorption and first-order elimination, it 
was used to describe the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide. The absorption rate constant was fixed to a value 
of 0.0296 h-1, based on earlier clinical pharmacology trials in normoglycaemic and type 2 diabetes subjects. 
Between-subject variability was included for CL/V and V/F and assumed to have a log-normal distribution. 
Residual variability was described by a proportional error model. The population pharmacokinetic model 
comprised 11827 pharmacokinetic observations from 2077 subjects. Model parameters are displayed in Table 
13.

Based on published data (Diabetes Ther 2019 10:649–662), it appeared that a 2-compartment model 
including rich PK data may be more appropriate to describe the PK of semaglutide. The applicant was 
therefore requested to evaluate 2-compartmental behaviour in an informative dataset. In the updated 
population pharmacokinetic model, results of nine dense sampling studies (two single dose and seven 
multiple dose clinical pharmacology trials in healthy volunteers) and sparse sampling studies: one phase 2 
trial, and two phase 3a trials (step 1 and 2). The Applicant performed a new modelling exercise fitting the 
sparse data in the obese population to a 2-compartment model with first-order elimination. The effect of each 
covariate was evaluated by comparing the 90% CI to the 0.80-1.25 exposure level using the full model 
approach. A one-compartment model was again the better model. No new parameter estimates and 
goodness-of-fit plots have been provided. Therefore, the predictive performance of the updated model could 
not be assessed. However, the parameter estimates of the updated population PK model of semaglutide was 
compared to the initial phase 3a population PK model of semaglutide and both models were in good 
agreement. As limited rich data were included in the new 2-compartment analysis for a thorough evaluation 
of covariates effects on other parameters than CL. The impact of changing injection sites was evaluated 
between injection site arm or thigh and abdomen was not significant for CL (exposure ratio 0.96). Injection 
site arm and thigh could not be evaluated separately. 
Further, an exposure-response analysis was conducted. The relationship between the Cavg and weight loss 
and Cavg and gastro-intestinal adverse events was analysed. The average concentration (Cavg) was calculated 
based on the individual parameter estimates of CL/F using the reduced population pharmacokinetic model, 
using STEP1 and STEP2 phase 3 trials. If no concentration data was available, this concentration was derived 
from the population prediction of this individual. Missing body weight information at week 68 was predicted 
using a mixed model for repeated measures (MRMM) to the observed on-treatment body weight data. Only 
observations from patients that were on randomised treatment were included (thus no discontinuation 
data/follow-up data). An unstructured covariance matrix was used. Also, a completer dataset was 
constructed with only subjects who were on-treatment and had measurable plasma concentrations. 
The bodyweight model is displayed below.  
Bodyweight (change from baseline) = E0 [placebo effect] + Emax * (1 + Isex) * Cavg / (Cavg + EC50) [Drug 
effect] + Ecov [Covariate effects of bodyweight, sex and study] + e [residual error]

Also, linear and Sigmoid drug effects were evaluated as well as additional covariates (age, BMI, race, 
ethnicity, glycaemic status) on E0, Emax and EC50. For weight loss categories, the same final model was used 
but scaled to the logit domain.  
The gastro-intestinal adverse event model is displayed below:  
Logit(P(GI=Y)) = E0 [placebo effect] + Esema*Cavg [Drug effect] + Ecov [Covariate effects of bodyweight, sex 
and study] 
A total of 3171 subjects were included in the exposure-response analysis. The parameter estimates for 
bodyweight and gastro-intestinal adverse events is displayed in Table 14 and

Absorption  
Absorption of semaglutide is relatively slow. Following sc injection, semaglutide 2.4 mg dosed in the to be 
marketed single-dose pen-injector had a median time to maximum concentration (tmax) of 24 hours with an 
observed range of 3–48 hours. Steady-state concentrations were achieved after approximately 4 weeks, with 
a Cmaxss and AUC0-168h of 118 nmol/L and 14572 nmol*h/L, respectively. Steady-state concentration-time 
profiles for semaglutide 2.4 mg is presented in Figure 3.

The absolute bioavailability was estimated to be 89% after abdominal SC administration. Comparable steady-
state concentrations have been observed between injection sites (upper arm, thigh and abdomen) for 
Ozempic, in the type II diabetes population (popPK study), but has not been evaluated in obese subjects. 
Systemic concentrations were maintained at the same level for about 7 days after administration of a single 
dose. Steady-state concentrations were achieved after 4-5 weeks, and fluctuation between Cmax,ss and 
Cthrough,ss was small. 
Figure 1: Semaglutide 2.4 mg dosing interval profiles at steady state – geometric mean plot – full 
analysis set (study 4590)  
A multiple-dose pen-injector, Semaglutide PDS290, was used in the four clinical phase 3 trials of the 
semaglutide weight management programme (Study 4373, 4374, 4375, and 4376). To improve the ease of 
use, a patient-friendly single-dose pen-injector, semaglutide DV3396 has been developed. Two 
bioequivalence studies (4590 and NN9535-4588) were submitted to support the change from the formulation 
used in the phase 3a trials to the to-be-marketed formulation: the single-dose pen-injector DV3396.  
In bioequivalence study 4590, bioequivalence between the DV3396 and PDS290 formulations was shown for 
the 2.4 mg strength, at steady-state and for the 1.0 mg strength, also at steady state (Table 16). Further, 
descriptive statistics of the semaglutide trough levels for other different dose levels were presented ( 
Table 17).

In the bioequivalence study NN9535-4588, bioequivalence was shown for 0.25 mg, at steady state; however, 
bioequivalence was not confirmed for semaglutide 1.0 mg, first dose following uptitration. Although the 
exposure was comparable between the formulations, the absorption profiles were different and the 
Cmax,sema,1mg, was slightly higher, with an estimated treatment ratio and 90% CI of 1.27 [1.20 ; 1.34]. (see 
Figure 4).

Figure 2: Semaglutide profiles after 1 mg dose of semaglutide s.c.– geometric mean plot –full 
analysis set NN9535-4588 
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution following a s.c. administration of semaglutide was approximately 12-13 
L. In vitro protein binding, mainly to albumin, was above 99% in human plasma. The high protein binding 
prevents semaglutide from being rapidly eliminated from the circulation.  
Elimination 
In the popPK model, the estimated apparent clearance was 0.05 L/h (17.7%) for a typical subject profile 
(white, normo-glycaemic [STEP 1], female, body weight of 110 kg, normal renal function). In study 4590 the 
apparent clearance of the to-be marketed single-dose pen-injector (CL/F) was 0.040 (22.6) L/h and the half-
life (t1/2) 155 (9.8)h in healthy subjects.  
In mass balance study 3789 with [3H]−semaglutide, the cumulative recovery of total radioactivity was 75% 
of the administered dose; hereof 53.0% in urine, 18.6% in faeces and 3.2% in expired air. In urine, 
unchanged semaglutide accounted for 3.1% of the administered dose. 
Semaglutide is metabolized by proteolytic degradation of the peptide backbone and beta-oxidation of the 
fatty acid side-chain. Semaglutide is extensively metabolised into many different metabolites. Its most 
abundant metabolite in plasma was P3, in urine U6 and U7 were most abundant (study 214379). All 
metabolites accounted for less than 10% of the total amount of semaglutide related material and are not 
expected to have any activity. 
Endogenous GLP-1 is metabolised by DPP-IV and NEP, but only NEP is involved in the metabolism of 
semaglutide. The applicant has shown that semaglutide was less sensitive to DPP-IV degradation. The 
pharmacokinetic data do not indicate any influence of polymorphisms of NEP on the pharmacokinetics of 
semaglutide.

Semaglutide steady-state exposure (AUC and Cmax) increased approximately proportionally with semaglutide 
dose, in the dose range of 0.25-2.4 mg semaglutide. Semaglutide steady-state exposure is stable over time, 
with an accumulation ratio of approximately 2.  
Variability  
The population pharmacokinetic analyses of the STEP 1 and STEP 2 trials, based mainly on trough 
concentrations, estimated an approximately 18% between-subject variability in AUC and within-subject 
variability in the pharmacokinetics of 27%. Within- and between-subject variability in PK in healthy 
volunteers was low (within-subject variability: 5–10%, between-subject variability: 17-24%) For subjects 
with T2D, within- and between subject was evaluated in the population PK analysis and was estimated to be 
13% and 27% respectively.  
Exposure in the target population  
The pharmacokinetics of semaglutide, following administration of the semaglutide 2.4 mg the single-dose 
pen-injector 2.4 mg, has only been characterised in study 4590 steady-state, in subjects with overweight or 
obesity (BMI 27.0−34.9 kg/m2, both inclusive). All pharmacokinetic studies that were conducted to support 
the weight management indication were conducted in subjects with overweight or obesity and therefore 
reflect the pharmacokinetics in the target population. 
Special populations 
The applicant has evaluated various special populations during the weight management program and 
previously conducted studies to support the T2D program. In popPK, effects of intrinsic and extrinsic 
covariate factors on exposure were evaluated using the full model approach and results were displayed in a 
forest plot, Figure 5. The most important covariate on exposure was body weight. The effects of body weight 
on the expected semaglutide concentration range at a steady state following a 2.4 mg dose is shown in 
Figure 6. Semaglutide exposure tended to be lower in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes compared to 
normoglycaemic subjects, the difference was 4% and 15%, respectively. Other covariates such as sex, age, 
race, ethnicity, renal function and injection site had no or only minor effects on exposure.

Further dedicated studies on the effect of renal impairment (study 3616) and hepatic impairment (study 
3651) on semaglutide exposure and a PopPK study in T2D patients were conducted during the T2D program. 
In these studies, body weight was the most important covariate on semaglutide exposure. Impaired renal 
function (mild to end-stage renal disease) and mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, 
B, or C) had no or only minor effects on semaglutide exposure. The same was the case for covariates gender 
and race.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro studies and clinical interaction studies suggest that semaglutide has a low potential for interactions. 
In vitro, semaglutide did not inhibit or induce CYP enzymes, and did not inhibit drug transporters.  
In study 4455, no clinically relevant effect on gastric emptying was observed with semaglutide 2.4 mg. 
However, in previous studies 1821 and 3685, a delay in gastric emptying has been observed, so it is 
assumed that semaglutide has some effect on gastric emptying. 
Drug-drug interactions between semaglutide 1.0 mg and metformin, warfarin, digoxin, atorvastatin or oral 
contraceptive combination drug (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) were evaluated. The results of these 
DDI studies are summarised in Figure 7. A lower Cmax was observed for atorvastatin when co-administered 
with semaglutide, but its overall exposure (AUC) was not affected. The other investigated medication was not 
affected by concomitantly administered drugs. It was noted that the tmax was more variable and tended to be 
delayed for most medication. Overall, small changes were observed in AUC, Cmax, and tmax.

INR was measured over a 168-hour period after a single dose of warfarin with and without semaglutide. An 
increase in INR indicates a prolonged blood clotting time. The average increase of clotting time after warfarin 
dosing during the two conditions were similar; the estimated treatment ratio (with/without semaglutide) for 
iAUCINR, 0−168h and INRmax were 1.05 [0.87; 1.28]90% CI and 1.04 [0.99; 1.10]90% CI, respectively. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics  
The clinical pharmacology programme for semaglutide in weight management builds upon the clinical 
development programme for Ozempic. Within the Ozempic application, the PD properties of semaglutide were 
investigated in nine clinical pharmacology trials and one phase 2, dose-finding trial. One new PD trial (4455) 
was conducted and submitted to assess the effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg on the rate of gastric emptying and 
explored the mechanism of the weight lowering effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg. 
Mechanism of action 
Animal studies show that Semaglutide crosses the BBB, and its effects include central homeostatic 
mechanisms involving the hypothalamus and brain stem. Evidence for the direct involvement of the hedonic 
system is limited, yet supported by semaglutide access to the septum. More evidence suggestive of the 
involvement of reward-related brain regions in the hedonic regulation of food intake included activation of 
deeper brain regions, possibly indirectly via projections from the homeostatic system that were directly 
accessible for semaglutide (please see under ‘Non-clinical aspects; Pharmacology’). 
Clinical studies show that semaglutide reduces energy intake, increases feelings of satiety, fullness and 
control of eating, reduces feelings of hunger, and frequency and intensity of cravings. In addition, 
semaglutide reduces the preference for high fat foods.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Summary of pharmacodynamics of semaglutide known from Ozempic  
Pharmacodynamic properties in relation to glucose metabolism 
The primary mode of action responsible for the effects of the GLP-1 Ras on glycaemic control is increased 
insulin secretion and decreased glucagon secretion from the pancreatic islets during elevated glucose levels. 
Thus, several PD parameters assessing different aspect of islets function (mainly the β-cell) and 
responsiveness have been included as PD endpoints. 
Fasting and postprandial plasma glucose responses 
Semaglutide improves glycaemic control in patients with T2D by lowering fasting and postprandial glucose 
concentrations (Figure 8). The lowering of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) with semaglutide was evident 
already after the first dose for doses of 0.2 mg or higher (trial 1821). 
Semaglutide lowered fasting glucose concentrations by 22% after 12 weeks of semaglutide treatment, the 
overall 24-hour glucose response (AUC0-24h) by 22% and the absolute postprandial responses (AUC0-5 h 
after each meal) by 20–29% compared with placebo assessed with three standardised meals (breakfast, 
lunch and protein-rich dinner) (trial 3635). 
The mean postprandial increments in glucose were lowered by 0.6–1.1 mmol/L (11 20 mg/dL) with 
semaglutide compared with placebo. In addition, semaglutide lowered the 2-hour postprandial glucose 
concentration after the breakfast meal by 37% as compared to placebo; the decrease was 4.1 mmol/L (74 
mg/dL) in semaglutide-treated patients. The reduced gastric emptying during the early postprandial phase 
contributed to a lower postprandial increase in glucose in patients treated with semaglutide as compared with 
placebo.

First and second-phase insulin secretion

In patients with T2D, defects in insulin secretion occur at an early stage during the development of the 
disease, and a decline in first-phase insulin secretion is among the first observations. The influence of 
semaglutide on first and second phase insulin secretion was therefore investigated following an intravenous 
bolus of glucose (IVGTT) in patients with T2D (trial 3635). 
First- and second-phase insulin concentration and insulin secretion rate increased approximately 3-fold and 
2-fold with semaglutide as compared to placebo (Figure 9).

• 
Glucose-dependent insulin secretory response 
Native GLP-1 is known to stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, and this ability was 
investigated for semaglutide in a graded glucose infusion test during a gradual increase of glucose from 
normoglycaemia to hyperglycaemia in patients with T2D (trial 3635). Healthy untreated subjects were 
included as a comparator group. 
The insulin concentration and insulin secretion rate (ISR) corresponding to the glucose increase from 5 to 12 
mmol/L (90−216 mg/dL) was ~ 2.5 fold higher with semaglutide than with placebo in patients with T2D 
(Figure 10). With semaglutide, the insulin concentration and the ISR in patients with T2D were comparable 
to untreated healthy subjects. The increasingly larger insulin secretion with increasing glucose concentrations 
demonstrates that semaglutide improved the insulin secretory response to elevated glucose levels in a 
glucose-dependent manner.

Maximum β-cell secretory capacity 
An arginine stimulation test was performed to assess maximum β-cell secretory capacity on a basis of 
induced hyperglycaemic conditions. Semaglutide-treated patients had an approximate 4-fold larger increase 
in insulin secretion than placebo-treated patients (trial 3635). 
• 
Fasting insulin and C-peptide levels 
As expected of an incretin, fasting insulin and C-peptide increased 30% and 23%, respectively after 12 weeks 
treatment with semaglutide in patients with T2D, as compared with placebo (trial 3635). 
• 
HOMA-IR and HOMA-B 
The data in the phase 3 trials show improvements in both HOMA-B and HOMA-IR. In the PD trial (3635), 
there was no apparent improvement in HOMA IR that may be explained by a generally better-controlled 
diabetes (lower HbA1c, lower BMI) in line with the inclusion criteria of this PD trial and may thus have 
reduced the improvability of insulin resistance in these subjects.  
Glucagon 
T2D is associated with inappropriately high glucagon secretion both at fasting and at postprandial conditions, 
contributing to high hepatic glucose output. GLP-1 Ras induce glucose-dependent lowering of glucagon 
secretion, which in turn lowers the hepatic glucose output. The ability of semaglutide to decrease glucagon 
secretion was investigated in patients with T2D during various glucose metabolism tests. Semaglutide 
treatment resulted in relative reductions compared to placebo in fasting glucagon of 8-21%, postprandial 
glucagon response of 14-15% and mean 24-hour glucagon concentration of 12% (trials 3684 and 3635). 
In the graded glucose infusion test, a glucose-dependent decrease in glucagon levels was observed with 
increasing glucose concentrations both with semaglutide and placebo; however, the glucagon decrease was 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 53/177 
 
 
 
  
more pronounced with semaglutide, further supporting the glucose-dependent responses of both insulin and 
glucagon (trial 3635). 
Counter-regulatory response to hypoglycaemia 
During induced hypoglycaemia, semaglutide did not alter the counter-regulatory responses of increased 
glucagon, and did not impair the plasma glucose-dependent decrease in C-peptide concentrations in patients 
with T2D as compared to placebo (trial 3684). 
There was a lower increase in concentrations of noradrenaline and cortisol for patients when treated with 
semaglutide compared with placebo. A decreased recognition of hypoglycaemia was also observed.  
Gastric emptying 
GLP-1 inhibits gastric emptying, causing a reduction in postprandial plasma glucose excursions. While 
decreased gastric emptying is an important physiological effect of native GLP-1, and short-acting GLP-1R 
agonists like exenatide and lixisenatide, decreased gastric emptying is less pronounced for long-acting GLP-
1R agonist like liraglutide, dulaglutide, albiglutide and semaglutide. The effect of steady-state semaglutide on 
gastric emptying was assessed after 12 weeks of treatment during standardised meal settings in subjects 
with obesity (trial 3685) and patients with T2D (trial 1821). 
Semaglutide reduced gastric emptying in subjects with obesity during the first hour after a meal (AUC of 
paracetamol reduced by 27%), and consistent reductions in early gastric emptying were seen in patients with 
T2D. The gastric emptying over the full postprandial period was not reduced, or slightly reduced for 
semaglutide doses of 0.2–1.6 mg (range for treatment ratios 0.87−0.96) when assessed in subjects with 
obesity and patients with T2D. The reduced gastric emptying during the early postprandial phase reduces the 
rate at which glucose appears in the circulation post-prandially, and may have contributed to the observed 
reductions in postprandial glucose. No effects of delayed gastric emptying on the PK properties of co-
administered drugs were evident. 
Pharmacodynamic properties in relation to weight loss 
The GLP 1 receptor is expressed in the human brain in areas involved in satiety and appetite regulation, and 
changes in plasma GLP-1 concentrations increase brain activity in these areas. GLP-1 has been shown to 
induce decreased hunger, increased satiety and a lower energy intake and thereby weight loss in humans. In 
animal studies, semaglutide is taken up in specific brain regions and increases key satiety and decreases key 
hunger signals. Using isolated brain tissue sections, semaglutide has been shown to activate satiety related 
neurons and inhibit hunger-related neurons. 
Body weight and composition 
Change in body weight from baseline to end of treatment was assessed in all clinical pharmacology trials. A 
reduction in body weight with semaglutide was observed across trials and populations (T2D and obesity), 
with a mean weight loss of 4–5 kg in 12 weeks, compared with a neutral effect on body weight with placebo. 
The effect of semaglutide on body composition was investigated in subjects with obesity using air 
displacement plethysmography (trial 3685), showing that the body weight loss with semaglutide was 
predominantly from fat tissue with loss of fat mass being 3-fold larger than the loss of lean mass. 
Appetite, energy intake and energy expenditure 
Semaglutide reduced appetite, improved control of eating, reduced food cravings and reduced preference for 
high-fat foods compared to placebo in a dedicated trial (trial 3685) in subjects with obesity. This translated 
Assessment report

into a substantially lower energy intake with semaglutide. The energy intake of 3 consecutive ad libitum 
meals was 18-35% lower with semaglutide than with placebo (Figure 11). Across meals on the test day, this 
corresponds to a reduction in energy intake of more than 3000 kJ (appr. 700 kcal) with semaglutide, 
corresponding to 24% lower ad libitum energy intake as compared to placebo. Based on ratings of nausea 
and palatability, there were no indications of food aversion or nausea during the meals being responsible for 
this markedly reduced food and energy intake.

weeks of treatment – trial 3685 
Note: Figure shows ETD and corresponding 95% CI. Abbreviations: CI: confidence interval; ETD: estimated treatment difference. 
Semaglutide reduced energy expenditure as assessed by resting metabolic rate (RMR) using indirect 
calorimetry/ventilated hood system by appr. 600 kJ per day. A minor part of the difference could be 
explained by the observed difference in lean body mass between treatments. No effect of semaglutide on 
respiratory quotient (RQ) was shown, indicating no difference in the oxidation of macronutrients following 
semaglutide treatment. 
The semaglutide-induced weight loss due to the reduced energy intake was primarily mediated through less 
appetite; however, other mechanisms, including improvements in the control of eating, fewer food cravings 
and a lower relative preference for fatty, energy-dense foods, may also have contributed to the reduced 
energy intake. 
Lipids 
The effect of semaglutide on lipid metabolism was assessed prior to (fasting) and up to 8 hours 
postprandially during a standardised fat-rich breakfast meal in subjects with obesity (trial 3685). These 
results suggest an improvement in lipid metabolism. 
PD trial 4455 
For the clinical PD assessment of semaglutide up to 2.4 mg for weight management, one new clinical PD trial 
(trial 4455) was conducted and submitted. 
This was a single-site, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the PD 
effects of semaglutide 2.4 mg in subjects with obesity (BMI 30-45 kg/m2). 
The trial consisted of an up to 4-week screening period, a 20-week treatment period (including 16-week dose 
escalation to reach semaglutide 2.4 mg) and a 7-week post-dose follow-up period. The trial included in-house

visits at baseline and at week 20. Subjects attended the study clinic for 8 visits, including two 2-days in-
house visits at baseline and at week 20.  
Gastric emptying was assessed by the paracetamol (acetaminophen) absorption technique. Blood samples for 
measurement of paracetamol were taken up to 5 hours after the meal as an indirect marker for the gastric 
emptying rate. Appetite (hunger, satiety, fullness, prospective food consumption), thirst, well-being and 
nausea was assessed using visual analogue scales (VAS) before the standardised breakfast meal and up to 5 
hours postprandially, as well as immediately after completion of an ad libitum lunch. Energy intake was 
assessed by food consumption of a homogenous ad libitum lunch meal that was served approximately 5 
hours after the standardised breakfast. Food cravings and control of eating were assessed by the Control of 
Eating Questionnaire (CoEQ).  
A total of 125 subjects were screened, 72 subjects were randomised and exposed (36 in each treatment 
group), and 70 subjects completed the trial, 35 in each of the two treatment arms. Demographics and 
baseline characteristics were generally comparable between the treatment groups. 
Mean paracetamol concentrations peaked approximately 30 minutes after the start of the meal test at 
baseline and at week 20 in both treatment groups. The paracetamol concentrations appeared higher in both 
treatment groups at week 20 compared to baseline (Figure 12). At week 20, there was a statistically 
significantly 8% higher mean AUC0-5h,para in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group compared to placebo. When 
adjusting for body weight at week 20 in the post-hoc statistical analysis no statistically significant difference 
in AUC0–5h,para between semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo was observed, ETR 1.05 [0.99; 1.12] 95% CI; p = 
0.1218. 
Figure 12: Gastric emptying – paracetamol concentration profile. 
Regarding the supportive secondary endpoints, no statistically significant difference between semaglutide 2.4 
mg and placebo was observed for AUC0–1h,para, Cmax,para, tmax,para at week 20. The effect on mean energy intake 
during the ad libitum lunch at week 20 was statistically significantly lower with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared 
to placebo with an ETD of -940 kJ, corresponding to approximately 35% lower energy intake with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg. The rating for OAS appeared higher with semaglutide 2.4 mg at week 20 compared to 
placebo, indicating less appetite in subjects treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg (see Figure 13).

100 mm = a lot Overall appetite score = (satiety + fullness + [100 – hunger] + [100 – prospective food consumption])/4. 
In exploratory evaluations, the appetite ratings before eating were comparable to the ratings after 
consumption. Further, the outcome for food intake appears linked to energy intake as there was a larger 
decrease at week 20 in mean amount of food consumed with semaglutide 2.4 mg (baseline: 685 g, week 20: 
364 g) than with placebo, with slightly more food aversion in the patients on the trial product. Also, the 
results from the COEQ suggested better control of eating, less hunger and less food cravings with the use of

semaglutide 2.4 mg. Also, subjects had a mean decrease in body weight of 9.9% (10.4 kg) compared to 
0.4% (0.4 kg) with placebo from baseline to week 20.  
The safety and tolerability profile was consistent with the previous clinical pharmacology trials with 
semaglutide. Mainly gastrointestinal disorders were reported for semaglutide. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Cardiac repolarisation by QT interval evaluation 
The potential effects of semaglutide on QTc interval and cardiac repolarisation were tested in a dedicated, 
thorough QTc trial, designed and conducted in accordance with recommendations in guidelines, including 
supra-therapeutic dose levels of semaglutide up to 1.5 mg at steady-state as agreed with the FDA. 
During the 48-hour post-dose ECG recording at steady state of the supratherapeutic 1.5 mg 
semaglutide/placebo dose level, 11 time-matched QtcI measurements (QT interval individually corrected for 
heart rate) were performed (Table 19).

Evaluations were also made using QTcF, QTcB and QTcL corrections. No prolongation of QTcL and QTcF was 
observed at any of the three dose levels. For QTcB a prolongation was observed at all dose levels i.e. the 
upper limits of at least one of the 11 two-sided 90% Cis for the estimated mean treatment differences were 
above 10 ms (Figure 14). Bazett’s correction may overcorrect the QT interval when the heart rate is 
elevated. Increased heart rate is a well-known class effect of GLP-1s as reproduced in this study (Figure 14) 
and hence QTcB is not appropriate for this analysis.

Figure 14: Baseline-adjusted QTcB interval analysis. 
Treatment with semaglutide was associated with an increase in heart rate and PR interval at all dose levels. 
The increase in pulse rate seemed dose dependant and varied over the day; the mean highest changes were: 
• 0.5 mg : 8.48 bpm [6.87 ; 10.09]90% CI 
• 1.0 mg : 9.66 bpm [8.04 ; 11.29]90% CI 
• 1.5 mg: 11.10 bpm [9.58; 12.62]90% CI 
The mean highest change in PR interval was apparently not dose dependant: 
• 0.5 mg : 10.72 ms [6.25 ; 15.20]90% CI 
• 1.0 mg : 9.22 ms [4.96 ; 13.47]90% CI 
• 1.5 mg: 10.02 ms [6.15; 13.89]90% CI 
The effect of semaglutide on PR appears larger than with other GLP-1Ras. When assessed by office 
measurements, semaglutide seems to antagonize the beta-blocker-induced pulse rate reduction. As beta-
blockers were not a randomised treatment in the CVOT, the implications hereof cannot be assessed. 
Extrapolation of the CV outcome results to subjects without established CV disease remains difficult. In these 
subjects, the differences in office HR were larger than in the whole population. 
Exposure response relationship 
The semaglutide exposure-response analysis included data from the same two-phase 3a trials (STEP 1 and 
STEP 2) as used for the population PK analysis, see section 3.1.2. Methods– Qualification of models, of this 
assessment report for a description of the model development.  
Assessment report

Exposure-response models were developed that aimed at establishing the characteristics of the exposure-
response relationship for the following efficacy and tolerability endpoints: 
•  Change from baseline from week 0 to week 68 in body weight (%)  
•  Subjects who at any time experienced:  
•  Gastro-intestinal adverse events of any kind and severity 
•  Nausea events of any severity 
•  Vomiting events of any severity 
The average semaglutide steady-state concentrations in a dosing interval (Cavg) was used as measure of 
exposure. The main results are displayed below in Figure 15 and Figure 16.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology  
The pharmacokinetics of semaglutide up to a s.c. dose of 2.4 mg were extensively characterised during the 
weight management and T2D clinical pharmacology programme.  
Methods 
The bioanalytical methods, pharmacokinetic data analysis and statistical methods used in the phase I studies 
are consistent between studies; therefore, the study results can be easily compared. The applicant has shown 
that all clinical samples could be analysed in the semaglutide assay, no samples were unsuitable for analysis 
due to being lipemic.  
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 61/177 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunogenicity of semaglutide has been evaluated using ADA screening, confirmatory and cross-reactivity 
assays, and a Nab assay. The employed ADA-assay had limited drug tolerance and the risk of false negatives 
cannot be excluded.   
The sensitivity of the NaB assays is adequate for detection of in vitro neutralising antibodies after 7 weeks 
drug wash-out but not during treatment.  
The pharmacokinetic data and exposure-response data from the weight management phase III studies were 
analysed using population PK modelling. Although some basic information from previously developed models 
was used, the weight management model was developed independently from the previously developed 
population models with data from the T2D population.  
The weight management population pharmacokinetic model was based on pharmacokinetic samples obtained 
in the STEP1 and STEP2 phase 3 trials. In the initial application there were concerns with the use of the 1-
compartment model since it is based on sparse data only. The model structure and covariate analysis were 
questioned. Mainly uninformative trough concentrations were used in the model development, therefore this 
model cannot be used for any extrapolations, but the model can be used to characterise variability in the 
semaglutide trough concentrations in these trials. The submitted VPCs indicate that the variability is not 
adequately captured by the model, which further supports that the model should not be used for any 
extrapolation. Based on published data (Diabetes Ther 2019 10:649–662), it appears that a 2-compartment 
model including rich PK data may be more appropriate to describe the PK of semaglutide.  
Upon request the applicant provided an updated Population PK model and showed that the initial one-
compartment model was also the most adequate model in the presence of additional data.  
The majority of available data were sparse PK samples from phase 2 and 3 trials (N=2,781, 6–8 samples per 
subject), and therefore robust individual estimates for all subjects was only expected for CL, with high 
shrinkage expected for the remaining model parameters.  
The updated population PK model of semaglutide was compared to the initial phase 3a population PK model 
of semaglutide. The estimated individual Cavg values from both models were in good agreement with similar 
to the intra- and intersubject variabilities and the effect of various covariates on the exposure of semaglutide 
was similar between the two models.  
The impact of changing injection sites, was evaluated between injection site arm or thigh and abdomen, was 
not significant for CL (exposure ratio 0.96). Injection site arm and thigh could not be evaluated separately. 
Given the shortcomings of sparse data-based models, the models for Wegovy may not be fully adequate for 
evaluation of covariate effects e.g. injection site in future paediatric extension applications. It is questionable 
if the sparse PK data sampling planned in the paediatric studies will be sufficient to address this concern.  
Bodyweight was the most influential covariate in both models that influenced semaglutide plasma exposure, 
which is in line with previous results obtained for patients with type 2 diabetes. For weight management 
program, the investigated bodyweight ranged between 54.4 kg and 245.6 kg, with a mean (SD) of 103.1 kg 
(22.2). In the T2D Ozempic program, the investigated bodyweight ranged between 39.7 kg and 198.3 kg, 
with a mean (SD) of 86.2 kg (22.5). So there is considerable overlap between the investigated body weight 
ranges. 
Furthermore, the trough concentrations of semaglutide also appear to be dose-proportional on a population 
level as no significant covariate of dose could be identified in the population pharmacokinetic model. 
However, it should be noted that both models are not considered sensitive to detect any non-linearities in the 
pharmacokinetics of semaglutide.  
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 62/177 
 
 
 
The exposure-response analyses were conducted with a derived average plasma concentration of 
semaglutide, mainly based on trough concentrations included on the initial 1-compartment model. The 
variability in the upper range of the plasma concentration-time profile is usually larger. Therefore, the 
variability in Cavg is most likely underestimated. The exposure-response models are quite empirical and a lot 
of information is lost by neglecting the time component. No results have been presented about the adequacy 
of the exposure-response models to capture the variability in the exposure-response relationship in the STEP 
1 and STEP 2 populations. Study effects are incorporated as fixed model parameters, which indicates that 
these models can only be used to describe the populations in these trials. Due to a high correlation in Cavg 
and similar intra- and intersubject variabilities between the initial 1-compartment model and the updated 2-
compartment PK model exposure-response relationships are not investigated with the 2-compartment model. 
Moreover, it is unclear how the imputations based on the MRMM affect the exposure-response models. 
Finally, there could be severe collinearity between plasma exposure and body weight (baseline and body 
weight change). Thus, the exposure-response analyses should be interpreted with caution. 
Pharmacokinetics of Semaglutide  
All pharmacokinetic studies that were conducted to support the weight management indication were 
conducted in subjects with overweight or obesity and therefore reflect the pharmacokinetics in the target 
population. 
The absorption of semaglutide is relatively slow. Following s.c. injection semaglutide 2.4 mg dosed in the to-
be-marketed single-dose pen-injector, had a median time to maximum concentration (tmax) of 24 hours with 
an observed range of 3–48 hours. Steady-state concentrations were achieved after approximately 4 weeks, 
with a Cmaxss and AUC0-168h of 118 nmol/L and 14572 nmol*h/L , respectively. These results are consistent 
with previous results of studies with the multidose pen injector and studies with lower doses of semaglutide, 
that were submitted to support the T2D indication. 
A multidose pen-injector, Semaglutide PDS290, was used in the four clinical phase 3 trials of the semaglutide 
weight management programme (Study 4373, 4374, 4375, and 4376). To support the change from the 
formulation used in the phase 3a trials to the to-be-marketed formulation (the single-dose pen-injector 
DV3396), two bioequivalence studies were submitted: trials 4590 and 4588.  
In bioequivalence study 4590, bioequivalence between the DV3396 and PDS290 formulations was shown for 
the 2.4 mg strength, at steady-state and for the 1.0 mg strength, at steady state. However, in 
bioequivalence study NN9535-4588, bioequivalence between the DV3396 and PDS290 formulations was not 
confirmed for semaglutide 1.0 mg, first dose following uptitration. Although the exposure was comparable 
between the formulations, the Cmax,sema,1mg, was slightly higher, with an estimated treatment ratio and 90% 
CI of 1.27 [1.20 ; 1.34]. Bioequivalence was shown for 0.25 mg, at steady-state. 
There is some difference in absorption profile between the two formulations, which may be attributed to 
differences in concentration between dose levels or the presence/absence of the preservative phenol. Due to 
the long half-life of semaglutide, the different absorption is not resulting in significantly different 
concentrations at steady-state. Therefore, it is agreed that the single-dose pen-injector DV3396 can be used 
to deliver the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg.  
The different absorption profile resulted in a 27% higher maximum concentration (Cmax,sema,1mg) following the 
first dose after dose escalation. It cannot be excluded that the maximum semaglutide concentrations will be 
higher for every dose escalation step and possibly, will result in more adverse effects during uptitration. As

semaglutide is carefully uptitrated in small steps and dose can be adjusted based on tolerability in individual 
patient, the 30% higher concentrations can be expected to be clinically managed.   
Semaglutide steady-state exposure (AUC and Cmax) increased approximately proportionally with semaglutide 
dose, in the dose range of 0.25-2.4 mg semaglutide. Semaglutide steady-state exposure is stable over time. 
With an accumulation ratio of approximately 2. However, semaglutide exposure may increase over time, in 
subjects with considerable weight loss. Upon request, the applicant calculated that a reduction in BW of 20% 
in an individual subject would lead to an approximate 18% increase in exposure (for comparison, in STEP 1, 
the trial with the greatest reduction in BW, approximately 30% of subjects lost more than 20% of the 
baseline BW). Usually, an increase of exposure is well tolerated, however in case of tolerability issues there 
may be a need for delay in dose escalation or dose reduction. This is now mentioned in the SmPC section 4.2. 
The within- and between-subject variability in the STEP1 and STEP2 populations appears to be comparable to 
patients with type 2 diabetes and a bit higher than for healthy volunteers. However, population 
pharmacokinetic analyses of the STEP 1 and STEP 2 trials, was based on trough concentrations only. The 
within- and between-subject variability of the exposure (AUC) in the STEP1 and STEP2 populations was 27% 
and 18%, respectively. Within- and between-subject variability in PK in healthy volunteers was low (within-
subject variability: 5–10%, between-subject variability: 17-24%). For subjects with T2D, within- and 
between-subject was evaluated in the population PK analysis and was estimated to be 13% and 27%, 
respectively. It should however be noted that the estimates obtained in the population pharmacokinetic 
analyses are based on sparse sampling data only. This could have resulted in a significant underestimation of 
the variability and therefore these results should be interpreted with caution. Upon request, the applicant 
calculated the intra- and inter-individual variability in the obese population using the updated Pop PK-model. 
The inter-individual variability in exposure for subjects with overweight or obesity was estimated to be 
19.2%, and the residual variability (within-subject and unexplained variability) was 25.6%.  The 2-
compartment analysis mainly contained sparse data with a relatively small contribution of richer PK data, so 
variability may still be underestimated. 
Special Populations 
The applicant has evaluated various special populations during the weight management program and 
previously conducted studies to support the T2D program. In popPK study III, the most important covariate 
on exposure was body weight. Semaglutide exposure tended to be lower in subjects with prediabetes and 
diabetes than normoglycaemic subjects; the difference was 4% and 15%, respectively. Other covariates such 
as sex, age, race, ethnicity, renal function and injection site had no or only minor effects on exposure. These 
observations are in line with previous observations for the T2D management indication. 
Interactions 
In vitro studies and clinical interaction studies suggest that semaglutide has a low potential for interaction. In 
vitro, semaglutide did not inhibit or induce CYP enzymes, and did not inhibit drug transporters.  
Although semaglutide is strongly bound to plasma albumin, the therapeutic plasma concentrations following 
semaglutide dosing is very low compared to that of albumin, and it is considered unlikely that semaglutide 
will alter the protein binding of other drugs.  
Drug-drug interactions between semaglutide 1.0 mg and metformin, warfarin, digoxin, atorvastatin or oral 
contraceptive combination drug (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) were evaluated. Overall, small changes 
were observed in AUC, Cmax, and tmax. These effects are probably reflecting a minor delay in gastric emptying 
with semaglutide. A lower Cmax was observed for atorvastatin when co-administered with semaglutide, but its 
overall exposure (AUC) has not been affected. The other investigated medication was not affected by 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 64/177 
 
 
 
concomitantly administered drugs. The observed changes in pharmacokinetics are not expected to be 
clinically relevant. The applicant did not evaluate the effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg on other drugs. As the 
observed delay in gastric emptying was less or comparable between semaglutide 2.4 mg (study 4455) and 
the lower dose of semaglutide 1.0 mg (study 3685) and the dose range of 0.2-1.6mg semaglutide (study 
1821), the DDI studies with the 1.0 mg dose can be used to support the application of the higher 1.7 and 2.4 
mg dose levels. No additional interaction studies are needed to evaluate the effect of delayed gastric 
emptying. 
Primary pharmacology 
The Ozempic clinical pharmacology programme was cross-referred for PD and PK/PD characteristics of 
semaglutide 2.4 mg. Within the Ozempic application, the PD properties of semaglutide were investigated in 
nine clinical pharmacology trials and one phase 2, dose-finding trial. A summary is provided here: 
Semaglutide treatment, compared with placebo, lowered fasting and postprandial blood glucose by improving 
multiple aspects of beta-cell function, including insulin secretion, and reducing both fasting and postprandial 
glucagon concentrations, all in a glucose-dependent manner. The data in the phase 3 trials show 
improvements in both HOMA-B and HOMA-IR. In the PD trial (3635), there was no apparent improvement in 
HOMA IR that may be explained by a generally better-controlled diabetes (lower HbA1c, lower BMI) in line 
with the inclusion criteria of this PD trial and may thus have reduced the improvability of insulin resistance in 
these subjects. The mechanism of postprandial blood glucose lowering also involved a delay in gastric 
emptying. 
Counter-regulation during hypoglycaemia was comparable with semaglutide treatment as compared with 
placebo. This was based on responses in concentrations of glucagon and C-peptide, and in glucose need 
during the clamp (AUCGIR). A decreased recognition of hypoglycaemia was also observed. It is not clear if 
this should be considered favourable or not: on the one hand, it may represent subject’s adaptation to 
normalised glucose levels; on the other hand, it could represent hypoglycaemia unawareness. 
The body weight loss observed with semaglutide was primarily from fat tissue. The mechanism of body 
weight loss involved lowered appetite, both in the fasting and postprandial state, leading to lowered daily 
energy intake. Semaglutide improved control of eating, reduced food cravings and reduced the preference for 
high-fat foods, as compared to placebo. However, semaglutide reduced energy expenditure as assessed by 
resting metabolic rate (RMR) using indirect calorimetry/ventilated hood system by appr. 600 kJ per day.  
Newly submitted study data on PD for the current application of Wegovy 
For the clinical PD assessment of semaglutide up to 2.4 mg for weight management, one new clinical PD trial 
(trial 4455) was conducted and submitted. Further, BE trial 4590 consisted of some PD data, and one phase 
2 trial and two-phase 3a trials included data for exposure-response analysis for semaglutide 2.4 mg.  
Trial 4455 
Trial 4455 was a single-site, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating 
the PD effects of semaglutide 2.4 mg in 72 (n=36 on semaglutide, n=36 on placebo) treatment group 
subjects with obesity (BMI 30-45 kg/m2), using a generally similar overall study design and the same 
methodology, as the NN9535-3685 trial, for gastric emptying assessment (paracetamol absorption technique) 
and can be considered acceptable. 
The primary endpoint, i. e. the paracetamol concentrations, appeared higher in both treatment groups at 
week 20 compared to baseline and no delay in gastric emptying was observed. A statistically significant 
increase in AUC0–5h,para of 8% was observed. After adjusting for body weight at week 20, the difference was 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 65/177 
 
 
 
no longer statistically significant. In previous gastric emptying studies 1821 and 3685 a delay in gastric 
emptying has been observed with semaglutide at a dose range of 0.2-1.6 mg and at the 1.0 mg dose level, 
respectively. Patients in trial 4455 had more time (20 weeks) to gain tolerance to the trial product and its 
side-effects, compared to patients in previous studies with 12 weeks, which would have affected the gastric 
emptying and would explain the difference in outcome between the NN9535-3685 trial and the 4455 trial. 
Therefore, although there is no delay or a slight increase in gastric emptying in obese patients taking 
semaglutide 2.4 mg, it is still assumed that semaglutide affects gastric emptying. 
The secondary endpoints of AUC0–1h,para, Cmax,para, tmax,para showed no statistically significant differences. The 
effect on mean energy intake during the ad libitum lunch at week 20 was statistically significantly lower with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo with an ETD of -940 kJ, corresponding to approximately 35% lower 
energy intake with semaglutide 2.4 mg and was comparable to the effect with semaglutide 1.0 mg. Further, 
results from appetite ratings showed a statistically significant effect of appetite suppression postprandially, 
when semaglutide was compared with placebo at week 20. Data were comparable in the previous 3685 trial. 
In exploratory evaluations, the appetite ratings before eating were comparable to the ratings after 
consumption. Further, the outcome for food intake appears linked to energy intake as there was a larger 
decrease at week 20 in the mean amount of food consumed with semaglutide 2.4 mg (baseline: 685 g, week 
20: 364 g) than with placebo, with slightly more food aversion in the patients on the trial product. Also, the 
results from the COEQ suggested better control of eating, less hunger and less food cravings with the use of 
semaglutide 2.4 mg. Regarding body weight, subjects had a mean decrease in body weight of 9.9% (10.4 
kg) compared to 0.4% (0.4 kg) with placebo from baseline to week 20. As expected, body weight data of the 
4590 trial were comparable to those of the 4455 trial with a decrease of 8.5-8.7 kg after 21 weeks of 
semaglutide. Subjects treated with semaglutide eat less than subjects treated with placebo. The intake 
decreases, primarily based on less appetite.  
Regarding safety, mainly gastrointestinal disorders were reported. The safety and tolerability profile was 
consistent with the previous clinical pharmacology trials with semaglutide. A mean increase in pulse of 5 
beats/min was observed with semaglutide 2.4 mg, as expected since data from the QTC trial 3652 showed a 
comparable dose-dependent effect on heartbeat. The mean pulse appeared to be returned to baseline value 
at the follow-up visit.  
Secondary pharmacology 
Cardiac repolarisation by QT interval evaluation 
The QTc trial (3652) was executed in line with regulatory requirements, and this is accepted. As evidenced by 
the QTc trial, semaglutide does not prolong QTc values. However, the effect of semaglutide on pulse rate was 
dose-dependent and appeared to be larger than with other GLP-1Ras. Consistent with the GLP-1 receptor 
agonist class effect, a small, persistent increase in resting pulse rate was observed with semaglutide in the 
clinical trial data available at the time of planning the thorough QT/QTc trial, trial 3652 (see also heart rate 
data from study 4455). QTcI, QTcL and QTcF changes were all below regulatory thresholds. A negative 
correlation between QTcB and RR interval was found; this association is demonstrated to materialize (albeit 
weakly) at a heart rate of 60. Consequently, overestimation may be an issue using QTcB in this study. Such 
association was not present for QTcI and RR intervals. Therefore QTcI (individual heart rate corrected QT 
interval) was pre-specified as the primary endpoint in this trial, avoiding correction methods for the primary 
objective that is known to be problematic for compounds with properties to elevate heart rate. 
Exposure response relationship 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 66/177 
 
 
 
The exposure-response analyses appear to indicate that the higher the average concentration, the more 
bodyweight loss can be expected. In contrast, the relationship between exposure and response for gastro-
intestinal adverse events indicates that a plateau is reached for the probability of experiencing an adverse 
event. However, these results could be severely biased by the assumed model structures (see also section 
3.1.2. Methods). The exposure-response models are quite empirical, pre-specified, and no goodness-of-fit 
plots or adequate numerical diagnostics have been provided. The average plasma concentration is estimated 
based on solely through concentrations, which could also severely bias the estimation of exposure. Therefore, 
the adequacy of the models to describe the relationship between plasma-exposure and bodyweight or 
adverse events cannot be assessed.  
Bodyweight influences plasma exposure (i.e. the higher the body weight, the lower the plasma exposure). 
This could severely bias the relationship between plasma exposure and body weight change. Furthermore, 
the time component (any correlation over the observations) is completely neglected by the modelling, which 
could bias the exposure-response relationship. Therefore, these models should not be used for any dosing 
recommendations and cannot demonstrate the adequacy of the selected dosing regimen in subpopulations. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology  
In general, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of semaglutide up to a s.c. dose of 2.4 mg are 
adequately characterised during the weight management and T2D clinical pharmacology programme.  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy  
The clinical efficacy programme consists of one dose-response study and four phase 3 studies as outlined in 
the table below (Table 20). The phase 3 studies are all conducted in patients, who are obese (BMI≥30 
kg/m2) or overweight (27 kg/m2≤ BMI < 30 kg/m2) with at least one weight-related comorbidity.  
The Applicant states that all studies for the weight management programme were conducted in accordance 
with ICH Good Clinical Practice.

2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies)  
The phase 2 trial 4153 was a 52-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-
centre, multinational trial with liraglutide 3.0 mg as an active comparator, and it enrolled 957 subjects with 
obesity, but without diabetes. The study design is shown in Figure 17. Dose selection was performed with 
daily doses of semaglutide s.c. The Applicant described that this was chosen to avoid large fluctuations in 
semaglutide plasma concentrations as this might have increased gastrointestinal side effects. However, as 
semaglutide has a half-life of a week, fluctuation in plasma concentrations are not very likely. Trial 4153 
investigated 5 once-daily doses of semaglutide (0.05 mg, 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg. 0.3 mg, and 0.4 mg) with dose 
escalation every fourth week and a steady-state reached before increasing the dose. Two dose escalation 
regimens were tested. As expected, with an increase of the dosage, a larger proportion of subjects reported 
gastrointestinal AEs. The results from this study showed that semaglutide 0.4 mg once daily with dose 
escalation every fourth week was most effective in terms of weight loss (Figure 18), while displaying an 
acceptable tolerability profile. 
A once-weekly dose was chosen that was not expected to exceed the plasma semaglutide concentrations 
achieved with once-daily 0.4 mg semaglutide. The population PK modelling estimated that a once-weekly 
maintenance dose of 2.4 mg semaglutide would result in similar concentrations at steady-state. The once-
weekly 2.4 mg semaglutide projected lower proportions of subjects reporting gastrointestinal AEs by 
approximately 2% and the proportion of subjects discontinuing due to gastrointestinal AEs. Consequently, 
semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly was the selected maintenance dose for the phase 3a weight management 
development programme, with dose escalation every four weeks  
However, no subgroup evaluation was performed at this stage and therefore, no evaluation if the effect of 
dose may differ depending on weight or BMI at baseline. It is considered plausible that the effect on weight 
loss may be baseline weight dependent.

2.6.5.2.  Main study(ies)  
Conduct of the study  
The investigators were required to have been trained in GCP. Training of the investigators in the protocol was 
carried out through investigator meetings and site initiation visits to ensure compliance and standardise 
performance across the trial. According to the protocol, the principal investigators provided written 
commitments to comply with GCP and conduct the trial prior to participation in the trial. Monitoring was 
conducted using a risk-based approach, including risk assessment, monitoring plans, centralised monitoring, 
and trial sites visits. The monitors reviewed the subject’s medical records and other source data, e.g. the 
diaries and mental health assessment instruments, to ensure consistency and/or to identify omissions 
compared to the eCRF. 
Novo Nordisk was responsible for the data management of this trial, including quality checking of the data. 
All subject data relating to the trial were recorded on eCRFs unless transmitted electronically to Novo Nordisk 
or designee (e.g. laboratory data). The investigator was responsible for verifying that data entries were 
accurate and correct by signing the eCRF. The original of the completed diaries should not be removed from 
the trial site, unless they form part of the CRF, and a copy was kept at the site. 
As a consequence of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was decided as of 23 March 2020 to stop 
source data validation of remaining data, as monitors could not visit the sites and remote validation was not 
possible. All data were still entered into the eCRF and checked for completeness, and data cleaning and 
casebook sign-off were ensured.  
Internal audits were performed by Novo Nordisk Quality Audits. Audit certificates that were available as of 01 
July 2020. The results presented reflect the data available in the clinical database as of 11 May 2020 (all data 
except anti-semaglutide antibody data and pharmacokinetic data) and 01 July 2020 (anti-semaglutide

antibody data and pharmacokinetic data). The first database lock covering all data except anti-semaglutide 
antibody data and pharmacokinetic data took place on 11 May 2020, after which the randomisation code was 
unblinded. 
STEP 1-4 
Methods 
The efficacy and safety of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once weekly for weight management as an adjunct to a 
reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity (STEP 1, 2 and 4) or intensive behavioural therapy (IBT) 
(STEP 3) were studied in four phase 3a 68-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials which 
included a total of 2652 subjects randomised to semaglutide 2.4 mg and 1530 randomised to placebo. 
The four-phase 3a trials (STEP 1–4) all included subjects with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) or overweight (BMI 
≥27 to <30 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related comorbidity. STEP 2 included subjects with overweight or 
obesity (BMI ≥27 kg/m2) and T2D (HbA1c 7–10%). In STEP 1, 2 and 4, standard lifestyle intervention 
according to clinical guidelines was included. STEP 3 evaluated semaglutide 2.4 mg when combined with IBT. 
All four trials had a treatment duration of 68 weeks with an additional 7 weeks of follow-up off treatment. In 
STEP 1–3, the 68 weeks of treatment included 16 weeks of dose escalation to semaglutide 2.4 mg and 52 
weeks on maintenance dose. The semaglutide 1.0 mg treatment arm in STEP 2 included 8 weeks of dose 
escalation and 60 weeks on 1.0 mg. STEP 4 evaluated the effects of stopping or continuing treatment with 
semaglutide after reaching the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg. 
•  Study Participants  
The STEP 1 trial (4373 – weight management) was performed at 129 sites in 16 countries in Asia, Europe, 
North America, and South America. 
The key inclusion criteria were:

The STEP 2 trial (4374 – weight management in type 2 diabetes) was designed to investigate the effect of 
semaglutide 2.4 mg on weight management in T2D. IN this trial, the key inclusion criteria were:  
•  Male or female, age ≥ 18 years at the time of signing informed consent  
•  BMI ≥ 27.0 kg/m2 
•  History of at least one self-reported unsuccessful dietary effort to lose body weight 
•  Diagnosed with T2D ≥180 days prior to the day of screening 
•  Subject treated with either:  
o  diet and exercise alone or  
o 
stable treatment with metformin, SU, SGLT2i, glitazone as single agent therapy or up to 3 
OADs (metformin, SU, SGLT2i or glitazone) according to local label  
Any approved and marketed metformin, glitazone, SGLT2i or SU product or combination products 
are allowed. Treatment with oral agents should be stable (same drug(s), dose and dosing 
frequency) for at least 90 days prior to screening.  
•  HbA1c 7-10% (53-86 mmol/mol) (both inclusive) 
The key exclusion criteria were:  
•  A self-reported change in body weight > 5 kg (11 lbs) within 90 days before screening irrespective of 
medical records  
•  Renal impairment measured as estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) value of <30 
mL/min/1.73 m2 (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in subjects treated with SGLT2i) according to CKD-EPI 
creatinine equation as defined by KDIGO 201285 by the central laboratory at screening 
•  Uncontrolled and potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy. Verified by a 
pharmacologically pupil-dilated fundus examination performed by an ophthalmologist or an equally 
qualified health care provider (e.g. optometrist) within the past 90 days prior to screening or in the 
period between screening and randomisation 
In all four STEP trials, patients with renal and hepatic impairment were excluded. The PK studies showed a 
similar exposure in patients with renal impairment and hepatic impairment. However, patients with renal or 
hepatic impairment were not included in the STEP studies. No analyses on efficacy and safety have been 
performed in these patients. The Applicant is requested to amend section 4.2 in the SmPC on renal and 
hepatic impairment in line with the SmPC of Saxenda.  
•  Treatments 
STEP 1 (4373) – weight management in overweight or obesity  
STEP 1 was a 68-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-armed, parallel group, multi-
centre, multinational trial. The 68 weeks of treatment included 16 weeks of dose escalation and 52 weeks on 
maintenance dose (Figure 19). The treatment period was followed by a 7-week follow-up period off-
treatment. This period of 7 weeks after treatment discontinuation is considered short, but as STEP 4 (see 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 72/177 
 
 
 
 
below) is designed to investigate the maintenance of effect on weight, this is not considered a large issue in 
the design. A sub-population of 140 randomised subjects had their body composition assessed by DEXA at 
screening and end-of-treatment. 
Figure 19 STEP 1 trial design 
STEP 2 (4374) – weight management in type 2 diabetes  
STEP 2 was a 68-week, randomised, double-blind, double dummy, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, 
multinational trial. In addition to comparing semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once weekly with placebo, a treatment 
arm with semaglutide s.c. 1.0 mg once weekly was included to enable comparison with the semaglutide s.c. 
T2D development programme and a comparison of the effect on body weight between the two semaglutide 
doses (1.0 and 2.4 mg). Randomisation in this study was 1:1:1. The 68 weeks of treatment with semaglutide 
s.c. 2.4 mg included 16 weeks of dose escalation and 52 weeks on maintenance dose (for semaglutide s.c. 
1.0 mg: 8 weeks of dose escalation and 60 weeks on maintenance dose), followed by a 7-week follow-up 
period off treatment (.

STEP 3 (4375) – weight management with IBT  
STEP 3 was a 68-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-armed, parallel group, multi-
centre trial conducted in the US. The 68 weeks of treatment included 16 weeks of dose escalation and 
52 weeks on maintenance dose. For the first 8 weeks after randomisation, dietary intervention consisted of a 
1000–1200 kcal/day low-calorie diet (LCD). After 8 weeks on LCD, subjects were gradually transferred to a 
less strict hypo-caloric diet (1200–1800 kcal/day) combined with physical activity and frequent behavioural 
counselling (in combination referred to as intensive behavioural therapy or IBT). Physical activity was 
initiated from randomisation with a target of 100 minutes physical activity per week, gradually progressing 
(by 25 minutes every 4 weeks) up to 200 minutes/week. The treatment period was followed by a 7-week 
follow-up period off-treatment (Figure 21 ).

STEP 4 (4376) – sustained weight management  
STEP 4 was a 68-week placebo-controlled, two-armed, double-blind, multinational, multi-centre, randomised 
withdrawal trial. The trial included a 20-week run-in period (including 16 weeks of dose escalation) on 
semaglutide followed by a randomised treatment period of 48 weeks treatment with either semaglutide 2.4 
mg or placebo. Only subjects who had reached the maintenance dose of semaglutide (2.4 mg) during the 
run-in period were eligible for randomisation. The withdrawal design was used to assess weight development 
after switching to placebo and generate data to support maintained weight loss in subjects continuing 
semaglutide treatment compared to subjects switching to placebo (Figure 22).

•  Objectives 
The primary objective of the four phase 3a trials (STEP 1–4) was to compare the effect of semaglutide s.c. 
2.4 mg once weekly vs placebo in subjects with overweight or obesity (and T2D in STEP 2) on body weight, 
either as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity (STEP 1, 2 and 4) or to IBT 
(STEP 3).

The main secondary objectives of STEP 1–4 were to compare the effect of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once 
weekly vs placebo in subjects with overweight or obesity (and T2D in STEP 2) on other factors related to 
body weight, cardiovascular risk factors, clinical outcome assessments including patient-reported outcomes, 
and glucose metabolism. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoints were change from baseline to week 68 in body weight (%) (STEP 1−4) and subjects 
who achieve ≥5% body weight reduction from week 0 at week 68 (STEP 1−3). The confirmatory secondary 
endpoints differed slightly between trials and included additional body weight-related endpoints, 
cardiovascular and glycaemic biomarkers, and patient-reported outcomes. 
An overview of the efficacy-related endpoints across the STEP trials is provided in Table 21 and Table 22.

The primary endpoint was the same in all four phase 3a trials: change from baseline to week 68 in body 
weight (%). Furthermore, STEP 1–3 included a co-primary endpoint: subjects achieving (y/n) ≥5% body 
weight reduction at week 68.  
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
In STEP 1 and 3, eligible subjects were centrally randomised in a 2:1 manner to one of the two treatment 
groups at visit 2. In STEP 2, eligible subjects were randomised in a 1:1:1 manner to one of the three 
treatment groups at visit 2. Randomisation in STEP 2 was stratified according to background diabetes 
treatment and HbA1c at screening. Furthermore, the proportion of subjects treated with SUs was restricted to 
a maximum of 30% of all randomised subjects. In STEP 4, eligible subjects were randomised in a 2:1 manner 
to one of the two treatment groups at visit 12 (week 20). 
Randomisation was performed using an IWRS. Subjects were assigned to the next available treatment 
according to the randomisation schedule. 
Treatment allocation remained blinded to the subjects, the investigators and to Novo Nordisk during the 
entire treatment and follow-up period in the main phase of the trial and until after DBL for the main phase of 
the trial. 
•  Sample size / Statistical methods 
The sample size and thereby the power for these trials was primarily defined to support safety.

The tests of superiority of semaglutide 2.4 mg to semaglutide placebo (or semaglutide placebo I/II or 
semaglutide 1.0 mg in STEP 2) for the primary and confirmatory secondary endpoints were performed using 
the fixed-sequence statistical strategy, at the significance level of 5%. The effective power was calculated 
under the assumption of independence of endpoints by multiplying the respective marginal powers 
successively. The assumptions on treatment effect and resulting power are given in Table 23, Table 24, 
Table 25 and Table 26.

The efficacy-related endpoints were evaluated for two pre-specified estimands, addressing the trial 
objectives in terms of two different aspects of the treatment effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg: 
The treatment policy estimand was the protocol-defined primary estimand in all phase 3a trials and in the 
phase 2 trial 4153. It assessed the trial population-average effect of subjects being randomised to treatment 
with the trial product (semaglutide or placebo) after 68 weeks, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and 
increased physical activity (STEP 1, 2 and 4) or IBT (STEP 3), regardless of adherence to treatment or 
initiation of other anti-obesity therapies. The analyses of the confirmatory endpoints were controlled for 
multiplicity only for the treatment policy estimand, and all superiority claims were based on conclusions from 
the treatment policy estimand. 
The hypothetical estimand assessed the trial population-average effect of actually taking the trial product 
(semaglutide or placebo) without any initiation of other anti-obesity therapies after 68 weeks as an adjunct 
to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity (STEP 1, 2 and 4) or IBT (STEP 3). 
Three analysis sets are defined: 
• 
• 
• 
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomised subjects according to the intention-to-treat 
principle. 
The safety analysis set (SAS) includes all randomised subjects exposed to at least one dose of 
randomised treatment. 
The extension analysis set (ExAS) includes all subjects eligible for the extension trial, who gave 
informed consent to participate and attended at least one of the following visits in the extension 
period: V25ext, V26ext, V27ext or V28ext. 
Two observation periods are defined for each subject 
• 
In-trial: The in-trial period is defined as the uninterrupted time interval from the date of 
randomisation to the date of the last contact with the trial site. 
•  On-treatment (with trial product): A time-point is considered as ‘on-treatment’ if any dose of trial 
product has been administered within the prior 2 weeks (14 days). The on-treatment period is 
defined as all times which are considered on-treatment. 
• 
In general, the on-treatment period will therefore be from the date of first trial product 
administration to the date of last trial product administration, excluding potential off-treatment 
time intervals triggered by at least two consecutive missed doses. 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 81/177 
 
 
 
 
• 
For the evaluation of adverse events, the lag time for each on-treatment time interval is 7 weeks 
(49 days). 
For the treatment policy estimand, the primary analysis model for continuous endpoints was a linear 
regression (ANCOVA) with randomised treatment as a factor and baseline assessment of the endpoint to be 
analysed as a covariate. In STEP 2, the stratification group for OAD treatment and HbA1c and the interaction 
between these were included as additional factors. 
The analysis model for the binary endpoints was a logistic regression using randomised treatment as a factor 
and baseline assessment of the endpoint to be analysed as a covariate. In STEP 2, the stratification group for 
OAD treatment and HbA1c, as well as the interaction between these, were included as additional factors. 
The confirmatory hypotheses were controlled for multiplicity using the fixed-sequence statistical strategy, 
testing the endpoints using a predefined hierarchical order. The test hierarchies for each of the four phase 3a 
trials are given in Table 27. 
Table 18 Confirmatory endpoints and testing hierarchy  
For each subject, a given assessment at week 68 could be available or missing, depending on whether they 
were still on randomised treatment at week 68: Available on randomised treatment (AT), available but 
discontinued (AD, missing on randomised treatment (MT), and missing and discontinued (MD). Note that 
subjects could have a different type for different assessments. 
All available data at week 68 (AT and AD) was used and missing values (MT and MD) at week 68 were 
imputed and the endpoints derived from the imputed values. The primary imputation approach was a 
multiple imputation approach using retrieved subjects (RD-MI). Missing body weight measurements at week 
68 for non-retrieved subjects (MD) were imputed using assessments from retrieved subjects (AD), and 
missing body weight measurements at week 68 for subjects on randomised treatment (MT) were imputed by 
sampling from subjects on randomised treatment (AT), both in the relevant randomised treatment arm. 
Sensitivity analyses investigated how assumptions on body weight development after withdrawal from the 
trial impacted the estimated treatment contrasts: jump to reference MI, single imputation approach as done 
by Sacks26, tipping-point MI, in-trial MMRM, and non-responders imputation (for binary endpoints only). 
For the secondary hypothetical estimand, both continuous and binary endpoints were assessed using a mixed 
model for repeated measurements, or ‘on-treatment MMRM’. The on-treatment MMRM was fitted using the

endpoint as response and the same factor(s) and covariate as for the primary analyses all nested within visit. 
An unstructured covariance matrix for measurements within the same subject was employed. 
The estimated treatment difference within each subgroup (demographics and baseline disease severity) were 
presented. 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
In total, 4585 subjects were randomised in STEP 1–4: 2652 to semaglutide 2.4 mg, 1530 to placebo, and 
403 to semaglutide 1.0 mg. Total patient-years of exposure (PYE) was 4770 for the on-treatment observation 
period (+14 days ascertainment window). 
STEP 1 (4373) – weight management in overweight or obesity  
In total 2303 subjects were screened, of which 305 subjects were screening failures, and 37 subjects 
withdrew consent before randomisation; thus, 1961 subjects were randomised 2:1 to receive either 
semaglutide 2.4 mg (1306 subjects) or placebo (655 subjects). 26 subjects were randomised in violation of 
the eligibility criteria (Section 9.3). The primary reasons were not keeping a food diary without missing more 
than 2 days of entries (19 subjects) and female subjects being pregnant, breast-feeding or intending to 
become pregnant or of child-bearing potential and not using highly effective contraception methods (6 
subjects). Most of these subjects were allowed to continue on trial product, which was in accordance with the 
protocol.  
In total, 1591 subjects (81.1%) completed treatment with the trial product, and the proportion was higher 
with semaglutide 2.4 mg (82.9%) than with placebo (77.6%). The proportion of subjects with at least one 
temporary trial product interruption was comparable for semaglutide 2.4 mg (9.1%) and placebo (8.9%). In 
total, 1849 subjects (94.3%) completed the trial and the proportions were comparable in the two treatment 
groups (semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo: 94.9% vs 93.0%). Slightly more subjects treated with semaglutide 
2.4 mg (82.1%) attended the week 68 and week 75 visits without permanent discontinuation of the trial 
product, as compared with placebo (77.3%). A plot of time to withdrawal from the trial (i.e. the accumulated 
proportion of subjects withdrawing from the trial) displayed that increasingly more subjects withdrew from 
the trial with placebo at a constantly increasing rate over time. The primary reasons for withdrawal from the 
trial in both treatment groups were withdrawal of consent and subjects being lost for follow-up.

STEP 2 (4374) – weight management in type 2 diabetes  
A total of 1595 subjects were screened, of which 361 were screen failures, and 24 were withdrawn before 
randomisation. 1210 subjects were randomised 1:1:1 to receive either semaglutide 2.4 mg (404 subjects), 
semaglutide 1.0 mg (403 subjects) or placebo (403 subjects). 49 subjects were randomised in violation of 
the eligibility criteria (Section 9.3). The primary reasons were not having kept a food diary without missing 
more than 2 days of entries (23 subjects), and treatment with any medication for the indication of diabetes 
or diabetes other than stated in the inclusion criteria within the past 90 days before screening (11 subjects). 
Besides the 49 subjects, 1 additional subject was discovered after DBL to be randomised in error due to 
violation of inclusion criterion #6. The subject was screened shortly after protocol version 2 was issued, in 
which the inclusion criteria were updated to specify that treatment with OADs should have been stable for at 
least 90 days prior to screening. The subject completed the trial. Furthermore, 1 subject with a screening 
eGFR of 29.27 mL/min/1.73 m2 was randomised to the semaglutide 2.4 mg group and completed the trial. 
The reason for this was that in the laboratory report sent to the investigator, the value was 30 mL/min/1.73 
m2 due to rounding in the calculation of eGFR, which was discovered after DBL. Most of these subjects were 
allowed to continue on trial product, which was in accordance with the protocol. Of the 1210 randomised 
subjects, 1207 were exposed to the trial product; thus, FAS contained 1210 subjects, and SAS contained 
1207 subjects.

In total, 1058 subjects (87.4%) completed the treatment with trial product, with comparable proportions 
across treatment groups. The proportions of subjects with at least one temporary trial product interruption 
were comparable: 8.4% with semaglutide 2.4 mg, 6.7% with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 6.9% with placebo. In 
total, 1164 subjects (96.2%) completed the trial with comparable proportions across treatment groups; 
87.1% of the subjects attended the end-of-treatment visit (week 68) and the end-of-trial visit (week 75) 
without permanent discontinuation of the trial product, with comparable proportions across treatment groups. 
EOT Figure 14.1.9 shows a plot of withdrawal during the trial across treatment groups. The reasons for 
withdrawal from the trial were withdrawal of consent and subjects being lost for follow-up.

STEP 3 (4375) – weight management with IBT  
A total of 742 subjects were screened, of which 129 were screening failures and 2 subjects withdrew before 
randomisation; thus, 611 subjects were randomised 2:1 to receive either semaglutide 2.4 mg (407 subjects) 
or placebo (204 subjects). There was 1 subject reported to be randomised in violation of one of the eligibility 
criteria when entering the randomised period; history of major depressive disorder within 2 years before 
screening. Of the 611 randomised subjects, all were exposed to the trial product; thus, the FAS and the SAS 
are identical. 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 85/177 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
In total, 505 subjects (82.7%) completed treatment with trial product and with comparable proportions for 
the semaglutide 2.4 mg group (83.3%) and for the placebo group (81.4%). Of the total subjects, 11.3% in 
both treatment groups completed treatment with at least one temporary trial product interruption. Of the 
total subjects, 92.4% of the subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group and 93.6% of the subjects in the 
placebo group completed the trial. Of the total subjects, 82.3% of the subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg 
group and 80.9% of the subjects in the placebo group attended the week 68 and week 75 visits without 
permanent discontinuation of the trial product. The time to withdrawal from the trial (i.e. the accumulated 
proportion of subjects withdrawing from the trial) was comparable for the two treatment groups with what 
appeared to be a constant rate over time. The primary reasons for withdrawing from the trial in both 
treatment groups were withdrawal of consent and subjects being lost to follow-up. 
STEP 4 (4376) – sustained weight management  
•  Recruitment / Conduct of the study 
A total of 1051 subjects were screened, of which 139 were screening failures, and 10 subjects withdrew 
before run-in. 902 subjects were included in the run-in period.  
Run-in period 
All 902 subjects in the run-in period were exposed to the trial product and were included in the SAS. Of 
these, 14 subjects were reported to violate one of the eligibility criteria when entering the run-in period; 
primarily for not having kept a food diary without missing more than 2 entries per day. 99 subjects 
discontinued trial product before randomisation (i.e. were classified as run-in failures). Of the 99 subjects 
who discontinued trial product before randomisation, 48 were due to AEs, 19 were due to being run-in 
failures (i.e. subjects for which the primary reason for not being randomised) was not fulfilling the 
randomisation criteria) and 11 were due to withdrawal of consent.  
Randomised period 
803 subjects were randomised 2:1 to receive either semaglutide 2.4 mg (535 subjects) or placebo (268 
subjects). All 803 subjects were included in the FAS and in the SAS (only randomised subjects). Of these, 8 
subjects were reported to violate one of the eligibility criteria when entering the randomised period. All 
subjects, except for 1 subject in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group, were exposed to the trial product after 
randomisation. More subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group (94.2%) completed treatment defined as 
being on treatment at week 68 compared to the placebo group (88.4%). In the semaglutide 2.4 mg group, 
98.5% completed the trial by attending the follow-up visit at week 75 compared to 97.0% in the placebo. 
5.8% of subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group and 5.6% in the placebo group had at least one temporary 
drug interruption. 
•  Baseline data 
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the trial populations studied were designed to be 
representative of the expected target population for treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight 
management in clinical practice. 
STEP 1, 3, and 4 enrolled subjects with overweight or obesity without T2D, and STEP 2 enrolled subjects with 
overweight or obesity and T2D. In STEP 4, only subjects who reached the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg after 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 86/177 
 
 
 
 
20 weeks of run-in with semaglutide were randomised. These differences in trial populations are reflected in 
the baseline characteristics, as seen in Table 28 and  
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 87/177 
 
 
 
 
Table 29. Subjects randomised to semaglutide 1.0 mg in STEP 2 are not included in the tables because 
semaglutide 2.4 mg is the intended dose for weight management. The baseline characteristics of subjects 
randomised to semaglutide 1.0 mg were comparable to those of the subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg and 
placebo groups of STEP 2. 
Baseline body weight, BMI, waist circumference, HbA1c, and FPG was lower in STEP 4 than in STEP 1–3, 
reflecting that subjects had completed a 20-week run-in period with semaglutide 2.4 mg prior to 
randomisation at week 20 (baseline). Because of this, STEP 4 is presented separately in Table 28 and Table 
29. 
The trials enrolling subjects without T2D (STEP 1, 2 and 4) had more female than male participants, while 
subjects with T2D (STEP 2) were evenly distributed between men and women. Moreover, subjects with T2D 
were older, had a higher HbA1c and FPG, and lower body weight at baseline compared to subjects without 
T2D. The proportion of Asian subjects was higher in STEP 2 than in the other trials. STEP 3 had more 
Black/African American subjects than the other trials, reflecting that this trial was conducted solely in the US.

STEP 1–4 data from subjects randomised to semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo during the controlled periods of the trials. STEP 
1–3: Baseline: Randomisation (week 0), STEP 4: Baseline: Randomisation (week 20). The last available and eligible 
observation at or prior to the baseline visit was selected for summary. 
Information on weight-related comorbidities was systematically collected at screening. The investigator was 
to record in a specific form whether the subject had the following comorbidities: dyslipidaemia, hypertension, 
coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, impaired glucose metabolism, 
reproductive system, liver disease, kidney disease, osteoarthritis, gout, and asthma/chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). 
Comorbidities recorded at screening are summarised in Table 30. Subjects reported a wide range of 
comorbidities at screening. Notably, hypertension and dyslipidaemia were more frequent in subjects with T2D 
(STEP 2) compared to subjects without T2D (STEP 1, 3 and 4).

In STEP 1, all the 1961 subjects were exposed to the trial product, and both FAS and SAS contained 1961 
subjects. In STEP 2, of the 1210 randomised subjects, 1207 were exposed to the trial product; thus, FAS 
contained 1210 subjects, and SAS contained 1207 subjects. In STEP 3, of the 611 randomised subjects, all 
were exposed to the trial product; thus, the FAS and the SAS are identical. In STEP 4, after the run-in period,

803 subjects were randomised 2:1 to receive either semaglutide 2.4 mg (535 subjects) or placebo (268 
subjects). All 803 subjects were included in the FAS and the SAS. 
•  Outcomes and estimation 
Effect on body weight and related parameters 
Semaglutide 2.4 mg was superior to placebo in providing a reduction in body weight (up to -15.97%), 
achieving a clinically relevant weight loss of ≥5%, and improving weight-related endpoints in subjects with 
overweight or obesity with and without T2D. As expected, the treatment effects addressing the hypothetical 
estimand were larger than those using the treatment policy estimand. An overview of the effect of 
semaglutide 2.4 mg on body weight-related parameters is given below.  
Body weight – change from baseline 
In all four STEP trials, substantial, clinically relevant and sustained reductions in body weight were observed, 
and superiority of semaglutide 2.4 mg was demonstrated for the primary endpoint: change from baseline to 
week 68 in body weight (%). Weight loss occurred early and continued throughout the trials. 
In STEP 1–3, weight loss was observed in both the semaglutide 2.4 mg group and the placebo group, but to 
a greater extent in subjects treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg. Subjects treated in the STEP trials with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg achieved reductions in mean body weight of 9.64% to 15.97% (9.67 to 16.82 kg) 
compared to 2.41% to 5.70% (2.61 to 6.22 kg) in subjects treated with placebo (Figure 25 and 26). 
In subjects with T2D, where improvements in glycaemic control have been associated with weight gain, 
semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment resulted in a weight loss of 9.64% despite a concomitant marked decrease in 
HbA1c of 1.6 %-point (described below, ‘glycaemic results’. The magnitude of the weight loss in subjects with 
T2D (STEP 2) was smaller than in subjects without T2D (STEP 1 and 3), a phenomenon that has been well 
documented in previous weight management trials. The placebo arm of STEP 2 achieved a larger mean 
weight loss than what has been reported in other trials with T2D, which may be due to the more intensive 
lifestyle intervention applied in the weight management trials compared to T2D trials. The 3.4% weight loss 
observed in the placebo arm of STEP 2 suggests a compliance to lifestyle intervention in the trial. 
The ETDs (semaglutide 2.4 mg relative to placebo) for mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 
were statistically significant in favour of semaglutide 2.4 mg.  
As expected, the results for the hypothetical estimand showed an even more pronounced weight loss with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg than those for the treatment policy estimand. Based on the hypothetical estimand; 
subjects treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg achieved a mean weight loss of 10.64% to 17.64% (10.61 to 
18.43 kg) compared to 2.44% to 4.97% (2.70 to 5.40 kg) with placebo.

estimand – STEP 1–3 
In STEP 4, all subjects received semaglutide s.c. for the first 20 weeks and had a mean weight loss of 10.6% 
during this period. Subjects randomised to continue semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment at week 20 continued to 
lose weight until the end of the treatment period while subjects randomised to placebo gradually regained 
weight but did not return to weight levels at the start of run-in (Figure 27 ). 
Subjects randomised to continue treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg had a further reduction in mean body 
weight from week 20 (baseline) to week 68 of 7.88% (7.12 kg) compared to a mean weight gain of 6.87% 
(6.06 kg) in subjects randomised to placebo. The ETD (semaglutide 2.4 mg relative to placebo) for mean 
change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -14.75% [-16.00; -13.50]95% CI and statistically 
significant in favour of semaglutide 2.4 mg. 
For the hypothetical estimand, treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg resulted in a mean weight reduction from 
baseline to week 68 of 8.79% (7.98 kg) compared to a mean weight gain of 6.54% (5.65 kg) in the placebo 
group, with an ETD of -15.33% [-16.52; -14.13]95% CI. 
Among randomised subjects, the supportive secondary endpoint; change in body weight (%) from the start 
of run-in (week 0) to week 68, was -17.38% for subjects randomised to semaglutide 2.4 mg and -5.02% for 
subjects randomised to placebo, giving an ETD of -12.36% [-13.71; -11.02]95% CI also favouring semaglutide 
2.4 mg.

Body weight - categorical response 
Superiority of semaglutide 2.4 mg was demonstrated for the primary endpoint; the proportion of subjects 
who achieve ≥5% weight loss from baseline to week 68, in all three STEP 1–3 trials (not a primary endpoint 
in STEP 4). 
In STEP 1–3, 68.8% to 86.6% of subjects on semaglutide 2.4 mg achieved ≥5% weight loss compared with 
28.5% to 47.6% of subjects on placebo (Figure 28 ) with statistically significant ORs in favour of 
semaglutide 2.4 mg. Treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg also resulted in greater proportion of subjects 
achieving ≥10%, ≥15%, and ≥20% body weight reduction from baseline to week 68 with ORs in favour of 
semaglutide 2.4 mg (and statistically significant for the confirmatory secondary endpoints proportion of 
subjects achieving ≥10% and ≥15% weight loss).

In STEP 4, all subjects received semaglutide from week 0 to week 20, at which point they were randomised 
to either continue on semaglutide 2.4 mg or switch to placebo until week 68. For subjects randomised to 
continue on semaglutide, 2.4 mg, higher proportions of subjects had achieved ≥5%, ≥10%, ≥15%, and 
≥20% body weight reduction from the start of run-in (week 0) to week 68 compared to subjects who were 
randomised to placebo (Figure 29). ORs were in favour of semaglutide 2.4 mg. The odds of gaining weight at 
week 68 from baseline (week 20) was 0.20 for the semaglutide 2.4 mg group and 5.01 for the placebo group, 
giving an OR of 0.04 [0.03; 0.06]95% CI that favoured semaglutide 2.4 mg.

Note: All subjects received semaglutide from week 0 to week 20. At week 20 subjects were randomised to either continue 
on semaglutide 2.4 mg or switch to placebo until week 68. 
Body mass index and waist circumference 
In alignment with the improvements in body weight, semaglutide 2.4 mg also reduced BMI and waist 
circumference in STEP 1–3. 
In STEP 1–3, treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg resulted in mean reductions in BMI from baseline to week 
68 of 3.51 to 6.00 kg/m2 for semaglutide 2.4 mg and 0.92 to 2.23 kg/m2 for placebo, with ETDs that 
favoured semaglutide 2.4 mg. Comparable results were obtained when addressing the hypothetical estimand 
and were supported by the results from STEP 4. 
In STEP 1–3, treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg resulted in mean reductions in waist circumference from 
baseline to week 68 of 9.40 to 14.61 cm compared with 4.13 to 6.27 cm for placebo with ETDs that favoured 
semaglutide 2.4 mg (Figure 30). Comparable results were obtained when addressing the hypothetical 
estimand. These results were supported by the results from STEP 4.

Figure 307 Waist circumference change from baseline to week 68 - forest plot - treatment policy estimand - 
STEP 1-3 
Reductions in waist circumference seen in STEP 1−3 were supported by the results from STEP 4 (where 
baseline was at week 20), where the ETD of -9.74 [-10.94; -8.54]95% CI favoured semaglutide 2.4 mg.  
Glycaemic efficacy results 
Treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg improved glucose metabolism with reductions in HbA1c and FPG in all 
four trials. As expected, the largest HbA1c reduction was observed in subjects with T2D (STEP 2) (See Table 
31 and Figure 31). A larger proportion of subjects achieved the HbA1c targets of <7.0% (53.0 mmol/mol) 
and ≤6.5% (47.5 mmol/mol) with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo (Figure 32).  
In STEP 2, superiority of semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo for change from baseline in HbA1c at week 68 
was confirmed and subjects reached a mean HbA1c of 6.52% (47.80 mmol/mol) with semaglutide 2.4 mg. A 
larger proportion of subjects with T2D achieved the HbA1c targets of <7.0% (53.0 mmol/mol) and ≤6.5% 
(47.5 mmol/mol) with semaglutide 2.4 mg (78.5% and 67.5% of subjects, respectively) compared to placebo 
(26.5% and 15.5% of subjects, respectively). Furthermore, a higher proportion of subjects achieved the 
composite endpoint, weight loss ≥10% and HbA1c <7.0% at week 68, with semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo 
(44.6% vs 6.7%). A higher proportion of subjects also achieved both weight loss ≥15% and HbA1c <7.0% at 
week 68 with semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo (25.7% vs 2.9%). 
In STEP 2, the proportion of subjects who had a decrease in treatment intensity with OADs (metformin, 
SGLT2i, sulfonylurea and thiazolidinediones) was larger with semaglutide 2.4 mg (27.1%) compared to 
placebo (6.8%), which further substantiates the improvements in glycaemic parameters. In line with this, a 
lower proportion of subjects had an increase in treatment intensity with OADs with semaglutide 2.4 mg 
(4.6%) compared to placebo (23.0%).

Improvements in glucose metabolism were evident even in subjects without T2D, as a higher proportion of 
the subjects in STEP 1 and 3 who had pre-diabetes at baseline shifted to the category of normo-glycaemia by 
week 68 with semaglutide 2.4 mg (84.1% to 89.5%) compared with placebo (47.8% to 55.0%) (Figure 33).

For subjects with T2D (STEP 2), fasting serum insulin decreased by 12% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and by 6% 
with placebo. The estimated treatment ratio did not indicate a treatment effect. For subjects without T2D,

fasting serum insulin decreased by 26% in STEP 1 and 32% in STEP 3 with semaglutide 2.4 mg. A decrease 
was also seen with placebo: 7% in STEP 1 and 15% in STEP 3. Baseline fasting serum insulin was lower in 
STEP 4 than in STEP 1–3, reflecting the 20-week run-in period. In STEP 4, fasting insulin decreased further 
(18% from week 20) for the subjects who continued treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg, while there was no 
change in fasting insulin for subjects who were switched to placebo. The estimated treatment ratio at week 
68 was in favour of semaglutide 2.4 mg for STEP 1, 3 and 4. 
Effect on cardiovascular parameters 
Semaglutide 2.4 mg decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the STEP 1–3 trials (Figure 34 and Table 
32). Semaglutide 2.4 mg reduced SBP (by up to 6.16 mmHg) in subjects with overweight or obesity with and 
without T2D at a clinically relevant level and was superior to placebo. In line with this, improvements in 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were also observed in subjects with overweight or obesity without T2D, but 
estimated treatment differences in favour of semaglutide 2.4 mg were found only for STEP 1 and 3. Although 
the mean blood pressure was within normal range across the subject populations in the STEP trials, the 
reductions in blood pressure were of a magnitude that would be clinically relevant for people with 
hypertension. The improvements in blood pressure were seen in parallel with reduced use of antihypertensive 
medication. 
Baseline (week 20) SBP was lower in STEP 4 than in STEP 1–3, reflecting the 20-week run-in period with 
semaglutide s.c. No further reduction in mean SBP was observed with continued semaglutide 2.4 mg 
treatment after week 20, whereas SBP increased for subjects who switched to placebo at week 20. 
Superiority (semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo) was confirmed for change in SBP from baseline (week 20) to 
week 68 in STEP 4.

Approximately one-third of subjects without T2D used antihypertensive medication between baseline and 
week 68 (STEP 1 and 3), while approximately two-thirds of subjects with T2D used antihypertensive 
medication between baseline and week 68 (STEP 2). Of these, the proportions of subjects who decreased or 
stopped taking antihypertensive medication during the treatment period were higher with semaglutide 2.4 
mg (26% to 36%) compared to placebo (13% to 16%) in STEP 1−3 (Figure 35). Furthermore, lower 
proportions of subjects had an increase in antihypertensive medication with semaglutide 2.4 mg (7% to 
13%) compared to placebo (13% to 22%). In STEP 4, a larger proportion of subjects stopped or decreased 
the use of antihypertensive medication between week 20 and week 68 with continued semaglutide 2.4 mg 
treatment (25.5%), compared to subjects who switched to placebo (12.0%), and a smaller proportion

Treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg resulted in an overall improvement in the plasma lipid profiles in STEP 
1−3 (Table 33). Triglycerides and FFA were reduced with semaglutide 2.4 mg in all three STEP 1–3 trials 
compared to placebo. Increases in HDL cholesterol were also observed with semaglutide 2.4 mg across all 
three trials. The change was in favour of semaglutide 2.4 mg in STEP 1 and 2, while data from STEP 3 did not 
indicate a treatment effect. In STEP 1 and 3, improvements with semaglutide 2.4 mg were observed for total 
cholesterol (including reductions in LDL and VLDL cholesterol). In subjects with T2D, a reduction in VLDL was 
observed with semaglutide 2.4 mg. See Table 33 for the full evaluation of changes in lipids in STEP 1–3. 
Improvements from baseline (week 20) to week 68 in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, 
and triglycerides were observed in STEP 4, whereas no noteworthy changes were observed for HDL and FFA. 
Approximately 20% of subjects without T2D (STEP 1 and 3) and 60% of subjects with T2D (STEP 2) used 
lipid-lowering medication between baseline and week 68. Of these subjects, comparable or slightly higher 
proportions of subjects decreased or stopped taking lipid-lowering medication with semaglutide 2.4 mg 
compared to placebo.

Est: estimated, N: subjects in FAS. a VLDL was measured as a fraction of triglycerides. Results reflect the treatment policy 
estimand. Baseline values are observed geometric mean (CV%). Analysis of data from in-trial period. The approximate 
relative changes/differences were derived from estimated ratios by subtracting 1 and multiplying by 100.  
C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of inflammation associated with increased cardiovascular risk and was 
measured in STEP 1–3. Mean CRP levels decreased from baseline to week 68, and the decrease was greater 
with semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo in all three trials. The estimated ratios to baseline ranged from 0.40 to 
0.51 with semaglutide 2.4 mg. This corresponded to estimated reductions in CRP levels of 48.91–59.54% 
from baseline. In comparison, estimated ratios to baseline ranged from 0.77 to 0.85 with placebo, which 
corresponded to estimated reductions of 14.99–22.93%.  
As part of the semaglutide s.c. for T2D development programme (Ozempic), a 104-week double-blind trial, 
SUSTAIN 6 (Trial NN9535-3744) was conducted. SUSTAIN 6 randomised a total of 3297 subjects with T2D 
and at high risk for cardiovascular events to semaglutide 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg once weekly or corresponding 
placebo in addition to standard-of-care. Treatment with semaglutide s.c. resulted in a 26% risk reduction in 
the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-
fatal stroke. This was mainly driven by a significant (39%) decrease in the rate of non-fatal stroke and a 
non-significant (26%) decrease in non-fatal myocardial infarction with no difference in cardiovascular death. 
This resulted in non-inferiority of MACE with semaglutide vs placebo. However, this represents another 
population than the target population of semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight reduction. 
With regards to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), some unexpected findings were present, as PAI-1 
increased in almost all treatment arms.  
The cardiovascular effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg is further being investigated in a dedicated CVOT, SELECT 
(trial EX9536-4388) in subjects with established cardiovascular disease and obesity or overweight without 
T2D. 
Patient-reported outcomes 
Underlying comorbidities in people with obesity act as major confounders impacting health-related quality of 
life (HRQOL), however research has shown that obesity in itself can also significantly impact HRQOL by 
impairing physical health status and imposing limitations on daily activities and reduced physical health. 
Furthermore, stigmatisation and discrimination associated with obesity can contribute to impaired mental 
well-being. Obesity-associated decrements on HRQOL tend to be more pronounced in physical functioning 
compared to mental or psychosocial functioning.  
Patients’ perception of how they function and feel is an important consideration for physicians and patients 
when making treatment decisions. With the purpose of including the patients’ perspectives on changes in 
physical functioning, confirmatory secondary efficacy endpoints were included in the phase 3a programme 
based on the validated Short Form Health Survey version 2 (SF-36) Physical Functioning subscale (STEP 1–4) 
and Impact of Weight on Quality of Life Clinical Trials (IWQOL-Lite-CT) Physical Function composite (STEP 1–
2). SF-36 is one of the most commonly used generic PRO instruments measuring general health status. 
IWQOL-Lite-CT was developed to assess weight-related changes in physical and psychosocial functioning in 
subjects with overweight or obesity in clinical trials. The IWQOL-Lite-CT was developed and validated in 
accordance with the FDA PRO guideline. Supportive secondary endpoints were related to the remaining 
IWQOL-Lite-CT composites (Physical and Psychosocial) and the total score as well as the remaining SF-36

subscales and the two component summaries (Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social-
Functioning, Role-Emotional, Mental Health, Physical Component Summary, Mental Component Summary).  
Statistically significant benefits in physical functioning were demonstrated for both SF-36 and IWQOL-Lite-CT, 
which occurred simultaneously with weight loss in all trials. Superiority of semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to 
placebo was confirmed for change from baseline to week 68 for SF-36 Physical Functioning in STEP 1, 2 and 
4, and for IWQOL-Lite-CT in STEP 1 and 2 following weight loss. Superiority was not confirmed in STEP 3, but 
the improvement in SF-36 Physical Functioning in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group was of comparable 
magnitude as in STEP 1 and 2, and the lack of superiority may be explained by the relatively high response in 
the placebo group receiving IBT alone.  
Responder definitions were used as benchmarks for what was considered a meaningful change for patients. 
The responder definition was the change in the individual patient-reported outcome score that had been 
demonstrated to have a significant treatment benefit based on patient evaluations. Thereby, the responder 
definition is considered to represent the patients’ own perspective of a meaningful change. Greater 
proportions of subjects achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in SF-36 Physical Functioning according 
to the responder definition (≥3.7 points) at week 68 with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo across 
STEP 1 (40.1% vs 27.2%), STEP 2 (42.0% vs 28.9%) and STEP 3 (36.7% vs 28.0%). This was also reflected 
in the estimated odds ratios, which were in favour of semaglutide 2.4 mg. 
With IWQOL-Lite-CT, greater proportions of subjects also achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in 
Physical Functioning according to the responder definition (≥14.6 points) at week 68 with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo in both STEP 1 (51.3% vs 33.0%) and in STEP 2 (42.5% vs 
31.3%). This was also reflected in the estimated odds ratios, which were in favour of semaglutide 2.4 mg.  
•  Ancillary analyses 
Prediction of effect on body weight based on early weight loss 
The labels of anti-obesity medications such as Qsymia, Contrave /Mysimba and Saxenda include instructions 
to discontinue treatment if a prespecified amount of weight loss is not achieved by a certain time, to ensure 
that patients who are not responsive to the therapy are not unnecessarily exposed to any potential risks of 
the treatment. 
Based on the data presented below, a specific recommendation for patients to discontinue treatment with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg if they do not achieve a predefined response is not considered to be relevant. 
Prediction of clinically relevant body weight loss at week 68 on the basis of early body weight loss was 
evaluated based on STEP 4 data, supported by additional analyses based on data from STEP 1 and STEP 2. 
The goal was to identify subjects unlikely to achieve and sustain a clinically relevant weight loss of at least 
5% after 68 weeks of treatment (non-responders). Early body weight loss was evaluated in early body weight 
response status at week 20 (1% to 5% body weight loss by 1%-intervals).  
Due to the marked weight loss achieved during the run-in period (week 0–20) of STEP 4, very few subjects 
did not meet the week 20 weight loss criteria below 5%. Therefore, this presentation will focus on the week 
20 (5%) weight loss criterion in STEP 4. Evaluation of early weight response at week 20 and week 28 in STEP 
1 and STEP 2 is included as supportive data.

Week 20 weight loss criterion: predefined amount of weight loss from week 0 to week 20 
Week 20 (x%) responder: subject who has achieved a weight loss ≥x% at week 20 
Week 20 (x%) non-responder: subject who has not achieved a weight loss ≥x% at week 20 
Week 68 (5%) responder: subject who has achieved a weight loss ≥5% from week 0 to week 68 
Week 68 (5%) non-responder: subject who has not achieved a weight loss ≥5% from week 0 to week 68 
Positive predictive value: % week 68 responders out of the week 20 responders. A low positive predictive 
value means that a high number of subjects will be continued on treatment who eventually would not have 
achieved clinically relevant weight loss. 
Negative predictive value: % week 68 non-responders out of week 20 non-responders. A low negative 
predictive value means that a high number of subjects will be discontinued from treatment who eventually 
would have achieved clinically relevant weight loss. 
Sensitivity: % week 20 responders out of the week 68 responders. A high sensitivity corresponds to a high 
probability that a week 68 responder is correctly identified based on being classified as a week 20 responder. 
Specificity: % week 20 non-responders out of the week 68 non-responders. A high specificity corresponds 
to a high probability that a week 68 non-responder is correctly identified based on being classified as a 
week 20 non-responder. 
% correctly predicted subjects: the sum of correctly positive predicted subjects and correctly negative 
predicted subjects divided by the total number of subjects 
If an early weight loss criterion (e.g. weight loss ≥5% at week 20) is to be applied as a clinically meaningful 
‘stopping rule’ to identify those subject who do not benefit from the treatment, the criterion should ideally 
have both a high positive predictive value (% week 68 responders out of week 20 responders) and a high 
negative predictive value (% week 68 non-responders out of week 20 non-responders). If an early weight 
loss criterion fulfilling these requirements was applied, responsive patients would remain on the treatment, 
whereas unnecessary treatment of unresponsive patients would be avoided. 
Prediction of clinically relevant weight loss at week 68 by week 20 weight loss 
Results based on STEP 4 
Most subjects (719 of 803 subjects, 89.5%) had achieved a weight loss ≥5% at week 20. Thus, the majority 
of the trial population were week 20 (5%) responders. The observed mean change in body weight from start 
of run-in (week 0) to week 20 was -10.6% across all randomised subjects with an available body weight 
measurement at week 20. 
Change in body weight (%) from start of run-in by week 20 weight loss 
A total of 88.7% of subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group achieved a weight loss ≥5% from week 0 to 
week 68 with semaglutide 2.4 mg, compared to 47.6% with placebo. 
The estimated change in body weight from start of run-in (week 0) or from baseline (week 20) to week 68 
was substantially and consistently lower for week 20 non-responders compared to week 20 responders. Still, 
weight loss increased with increasing week 20 weight loss criteria (1% to 5%), and even subjects who were 
week 20 (5%) non-responders had a clinically relevant (≥5%) mean weight loss from week 0 to week 68 of -
6.07% with semaglutide 2.4 mg (Table 34).

The small number of week 20 non-responders with the lowest week 20 weight loss criteria (1% to 3%), led 
to wide confidence intervals and were furthermore insufficient to perform statistical analysis of clinically 
relevant weight loss of ≥5% at week 68. 
Approximately half of the subjects who were week 20 (5%) non-responders with semaglutide still achieved a 
≥5% weight reduction after a further 48 weeks of treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg (estimated percentage 
of week 68 [5%] responders: 51.95%), while only a few of the week 20 (5%) non-responders who switched 
to placebo at week 20 became week 68 (5%) responders (estimated percentage: 11.36%). A non-responder 
sensitivity analysis supported these results. 
Prediction of clinically relevant weight loss since start of run-in by week 20 weight loss 
Positive predictive values were high with semaglutide 2.4 mg, meaning that few subjects would be continued 
on treatment without achieving clinically relevant weight loss (Table 35 and Figure 36, top panel). In 
contrast, negative predictive values decreased with increasing week 20 weight loss criteria, meaning that a 
high number of subjects would be discontinued from treatment who eventually would have achieved clinically 
relevant weight loss (Table 35 and Figure 36, bottom panel). Specificity was low, especially for the lower 
week 20 weight loss criteria. Thus, a week 20 non-response could not accurately predict a week 68 (5%) 
non-response. In contrast, sensitivity was high, so a week 68 (5%) responder was likely to have been 
correctly identified based on being a week 20 responder, regardless of the week 20 weight loss criterion 
applied (Table 35).

Supporting data from STEP 1 and STEP 2 
The (%) change in body weight from week 0 to week 68 by early body weight response status at week 20 
and week 28 (1% to 5% by 1%) was analysed for STEP 1 and STEP 2. Week 28 was included in the 
evaluation to provide supportive data from the time point where subjects had been treated with the 
maintenance dose (2.4 mg) for 12 weeks. 
The evaluation of data from STEP 1 (subjects without T2D) and from STEP 2 (subjects with T2D) in terms of 
prediction of clinically relevant weight loss at week 68 by early weight loss criteria led to comparable 
conclusions as for the evaluation of STEP 4. A large proportion of subjects were week 20 (5%) responders, 
and week 20 (5%) non-responders achieved a clinically meaningful weight loss at week 68. Comparable 
results were obtained when week 28 was set as the time point for assessing early weight loss.

Change in body weight (%) from start of run-in by week 20 or week 28 weight loss 
Most subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group were week 20 (5%) responders (STEP 1: 85.3% and STEP 2: 
70.2%). Similar results were seen for week 28 (5%) responders. 
The estimated change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was substantially and consistently smaller for 
week 20 non-responders than for week 20 responders. Still, in STEP 1, week 20 (5%) non-responders had a 
clinically relevant weight loss at week 68 with semaglutide 2.4 mg (estimated change from 
baseline: -5.30%). In STEP 2, week 20 (5%) non-responders had an estimated change from baseline in body 
weight of -4.10% at week 68 with semaglutide 2.4 mg. Comparable results were seen for week 28 criteria.  
Prediction of clinically relevant weight loss at week 68 by week 20 or week 28 weight loss  
In STEP 1 and STEP 2, positive predictive values were high in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group, whereas 
negative predictive values decreased with increasing weight loss criteria. In STEP 1, the negative predictive 
value of week 20 (5%) non-responders was 42.3%, meaning that 57.7% of week 20 (5%) non-responders 
with semaglutide 2.4 mg still achieved a clinically relevant weight loss ≥5% at week 68. Similarly, in STEP 2, 
the negative predictive value of week 20 (5%) non-responders was 62.7%, meaning that 37.3% of week 20 
(5%) non-responders still achieved a clinically relevant weight loss ≥5% at week 68. 
Within each of the two trials, predictive values were similar for week 28 (5%) criteria and week 20 (5%) 
criteria, except for the negative predictive value in STEP 1, which was lower for the week 20 (5%) criterion 
compared to the week 28 (5%) criterion. Sensitivity analyses supported the results for STEP 1 and STEP 2. 
Summary of results 
Analyses were performed based on data from STEP 4 to investigate how well the amount of weight loss 
achieved after 20 weeks of treatment predicts which subjects will not achieve and sustain a weight loss of at 
least 5% after 68 weeks of treatment (non-responders). 
In STEP 4, a substantial weight loss was achieved during the 20-week run-in, and very few subjects did not 
meet the week 20 (5%) weight loss criterion. This criterion gave a high positive predictive value, but a low 
negative predictive value, meaning that few subjects would continue treatment without achieving a clinically 
relevant weight loss, but also that a large fraction of subjects would stop treatment although they were likely 
to achieve a clinically relevant weight loss, had they continued. The results of the supportive analyses of 
STEP 1 and 2 data were consistent with the results obtained for STEP 4. 
Based on the results of these analyses, a specific recommendation for patients to discontinue treatment with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg if they do not achieve a predefined weight loss is not considered to be relevant, since 
none of the predefined early weight loss criteria identified the majority of non-responders. 
Missing data patterns: 
The number of subjects who discontinued trial product prematurely for each trial and who attended the 68-
week visit are shown in the four figures below (blue dashed lines, Figures 37-40). The mean body weight of 
those who discontinued are also shown. 
Those who discontinue treatment have a higher bodyweight at week 68 compared to those who stay on 
treatment both in the placebo group and in the semaglutide treatment group, and the difference between 
completers and non-completers are higher in the semaglutide group compared with the placebo group. But

for the STEP 2 study, the bodyweight among those who discontinue treatment is higher in the semaglutide 
group than in the placebo group at week 68.

Adherence to diet and increased physical activity 
In STEP 1, adherence to diet registration and increased physical activity during the trial was higher in the 
semaglutide group compared with placebo (Figure 41).

2.6.5.3.  Clinical studies in special populations  
Subgroup analyses based on baseline demographic and disease factors 
To investigate whether there were differences in efficacy response to semaglutide 2.4 mg in sub-populations, 
the evaluation of change from baseline in body weight (%) was conducted for predefined subgroups. In 
general, lower baseline values were observed in STEP 4 due to baseline being defined as the start of the on-
treatment period after randomisation (week 20).  
Apart from sex (STEP 1, 2, 4) and baseline body weight (STEP 1 and STEP 4), the efficacy response to 
semaglutide 2.4 mg was consistent across sub-populations, and the beneficial effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg 
compared to placebo was generally seen across all sub-populations. 
Sex 
The majority of subjects in STEP 1, 3, and 4 were female. Male and female subjects were more evenly 
distributed in STEP 2. 
In STEP 1, 2, and 4, female subjects lost on average more weight compared with male subjects, as shown by 
the larger ETDs of semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo (Figure 42 and 43). However, this effect was not 
seen in STEP 3. Body weight was previously identified as the most important covariate for semaglutide 
exposure, with higher exposures at lower body weights. Higher exposure may contribute to the larger weight 
loss seen in female subjects, as baseline mean body weight was lower in female subjects across all four 
trials.

Exposure-response relationships were explored as part of the dose setting for phase 3 based on data from 
4153. Here it appeared that the weight loss increased in an exposure-dependent manner within both sexes 
although weight loss at a given exposure level was slightly larger in females than males. A larger weight loss 
in STEP 1 as compared to STEP 2 was observed. Factors contributing to this difference may include sex 
distribution between the two trials. Sex were compared across trials showing that the weight loss increased in 
an exposure-dependent manner in both male and female subjects. Within both trials, it appeared that the 
weight loss at a given exposure level was larger in females than males. Overall, these analyses suggested 
that exposure differences cannot explain all differences between genders in terms of weight loss.

Baseline body weight 
Subjects were evenly distributed across the baseline body weight categories (Figure 44) within the trials, 
with the exception of STEP 2 and STEP 4, which had higher proportions of subjects with baseline body weight 
<90 kg. Mean baseline body weight within the categories was comparable across treatment groups in each 
trial. 
Subjects in STEP 1 and STEP 4 with higher baseline body weight lost on average less weight (%) than 
subjects with lower baseline body weight. This effect was less pronounced in STEP 2 and STEP 3 (Figure 44, 
Figure 45). There was a small treatment effect of baseline BMI in STEP 3 and STEP 4. No treatment-
subgroup interaction was seen for baseline BMI in STEP 1 and STEP 2.

Weight loss in subjects with gastrointestinal AEs 
A descriptive analysis of the effect of gastrointestinal AEs on weight loss (change in body weight [%] from 
baseline to week 68) was evaluated in two sub-populations – subjects with and without: 
•  Any gastrointestinal AEs 
•  Nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea (the most frequently occurring gastrointestinal AEs) 
Weight loss occurred irrespective of gastrointestinal AEs, as there were minimal differences in weight loss in 
these two sub-populations. In STEP 1 trial, 969/1306 subjects treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg had 
gastrointestinal AE, and patients with gastrointestinal AEs had a weight change at 68 weeks of treatment of 
(mean (SD)) -15.8% (10.1) vs -15.1% (10.0) in patients without gastrointestinal AEs. In STEP 2 trial 
256/404 patients treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg had gastrointestinal AE and body weight change of -
10.4% (8.3) vs -9.0% (7.5) in patients without gastrointestinal AEs. Including only patients with AEs of 
nausea, diarrhoea and/or vomiting in STEP 1 779/1306 patients had these AEs and had a body weight 
change of -16.1% (10.4) vs –14.8% (9.6) in patients without at 68 weeks of treatment with semaglutide 2.4 
mg. In STEP 2 this was 191/404 patients with a weight change of -10.5% (8.2) vs -9.4% (7.8).  
Analyses across age groups 
In the 4 pivotal trials 388 out of 4182 subjects were between 65 and 74 years of age, and 36 patients were 
75 years of age or older (Table 40). No information on the number of subjects aged 85+ years are provided.

2.6.5.4.  Supportive study(ies)  
Body composition  
Changes in body composition (total fat mass, total lean body mass, and regional visceral fat mass) from 
baseline to week 68 were included as a supportive secondary endpoint for a subpopulation of 140 US 
subjects in STEP 1.  
Body composition was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Treatment with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg was accompanied by greater reduction in fat mass than in lean body mass leading to an 
improvement in body composition compared to placebo after 68 weeks. Furthermore, this reduction in total 
fat mass was accompanied by a reduction in regional visceral fat.  
Compared to placebo, treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg resulted in improvements in proportions of total 
body fat (ETD: -3.29 %-points, 95% CI -4.94 to -1.65), lean body mass (ETD: 2.94 %-points, 95% CI 1.40 
to 4.49), and regional visceral fat mass (ETD: -1.98 %-points, 95% CI -3.69; -0.27) (Figure 50).  
These results suggest that most of the total weight loss was attributable to a reduction in fat tissue, including 
regional visceral fat.

Anti-semaglutide antibodies 
Overall, the low immunogenicity observed with semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg is consistent with that reported for 
semaglutide s.c. 1 mg for T2D (Ozempic) and other GLP-1 analogues with high homology to the human GLP-
1 amino acid backbone. 
In STEP 1 and STEP 2, the proportion of subjects that tested positive for anti-semaglutide antibodies at any 
time point post-baseline was low (50 subjects, 2.9% of subjects randomised to semaglutide 2.4 mg). The 
antibodies levels were low for all weeks; with mean levels ranging from 2.01−4.93 %B/T and median titres of 
either 15 or 30. Antibodies cross-reacting with endogenous GLP-1 were detected in 28 subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022

(corresponding to 1.6% of all subjects randomised to semaglutide 2.4 mg). No subjects had anti-semaglutide 
antibodies with in vitro neutralising effect against semaglutide or endogenous GLP-1. 
Of the 50 subjects with a treatment-induced antibody response, 21 subjects had a transient antibody 
response, and of these, 20 subjects had anti-semaglutide antibodies at a single visit during treatment only. 
For the remaining 29 subjects with a treatment-induced antibody response, a persistent response was 
observed with anti-semaglutide antibodies at several visits during the trial (with at least 16 weeks in 
between) and/or antibodies at the follow-up visit. Of these 29 subjects with a persistent response, 
19 subjects were positive for anti-semaglutide antibodies at the follow-up visit, and of these, 5 subjects were 
positive at the follow-up visit only. 
Pre-existing antibodies at baseline occurred in 1 subject; this subject was antibody negative at all visits post-
baseline, hence the antibodies were not boosted following treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg. 
The formation of anti-semaglutide antibodies did not appear to influence the semaglutide plasma 
concentrations, based on PK data in subjects that tested positive for anti-semaglutide antibodies.  
The formation of anti-semaglutide antibodies did not appear to influence the efficacy as measured by body 
weight (%) change from baseline. In STEP 2, the formation of anti-semaglutide antibodies did not appear to 
influence the efficacy in subjects with T2D, as measured by HbA1c. 
Based on the reported AEs in subjects positive for anti-semaglutide antibodies, there was no indication that 
the formation of anti-semaglutide antibodies impacted the safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg. 
However, some differences have been observed on weight loss and allergic reactions between patients with 
and without antibodies. This will be discussed below in Section 3.3.8. ‘Clinical safety, immunological events’.  
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy  
Dose response studies  
The phase 2 trial 4153 investigated 5 once-daily doses of semaglutide (0.05 mg, 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg. 0.3 mg, 
and 0.4 mg) with dose escalation every fourth week and a steady-state reached before increasing the dose. 
As expected, with an increase of the dosage, a larger proportion of subjects reported gastrointestinal AEs. A 
once-weekly dose was chosen for phase 3 that was not expected to exceed the plasma semaglutide 
concentrations achieved with once-daily 0.4 mg semaglutide.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Four phase 3a trials (STEP 1–4) have been performed to investigate the efficacy of semaglutide 2.4 mg for 
weight management. STEP 1, 3 and 4 are performed in obese individuals without T2D or in overweight 
patients with the presence of at least one weight related comorbidity, but without T2D.  STEP 2 was 
performed in overweight or obese patients with T2D. The key in- and exclusion criteria are acceptable, as 
they are in line with the proposed indication in Section 4.1 of the SmPC.  
In the 4 pivotal trials 388 out of 4182 subjects were between 65 and 74 years of age, and 36 patients were 
75 years of age or older. The limited evidence in patients older than 75 years of age is reflected in the SmPC. 
In STEP 2 (subjects with type 2 diabetes), HbA1c should be within 7-10%. Concomitant treatment with insulin 
was not allowed in the STEP 2 study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 131/177 
 
 
 
The four STEP trials all include a 68 weeks treatment period with a fixed titration period in the first 16 weeks 
and a follow-up period for 7 weeks. The randomisation for the treatment arm vs. placebo was 2:1, except for 
STEP 2. In STEP 2 (in T2D patients), an additional treatment arm was included with the dosage of 1.0 mg 
once weekly, which is currently an indicated dosage for the treatment of diabetes. Randomisation in this 
study was 1:1:1.  
These are well-designed studies, and the treatment duration period is considered sufficient to assess the 
effect on the primary outcome. The follow-up period of 7 weeks after treatment discontinuation is considered 
short, but as STEP 4 is designed to investigate the maintenance of effect on weight, this is not considered a 
large issue in the design. 
The primary endpoints were in accordance with regulatory guidance (Guideline on clinical evaluation of 
medicinal products used in weight management (2016 EMA/CHMP/311805/2014)). Also, the confirmatory 
secondary endpoint on weight related outcomes (HbA1c and SBP) are in line with the guideline and in 
addition, reported patient-related outcomes were defined as confirmatory secondary endpoints. The 
treatment effect of semaglutide is much larger than of products currently on the market and exceeds the 
presumptions of the Guideline.  
The randomisation procedure and blinding procedure for all studies are acceptable. The sample size of the 
studies is based on reaching sufficient power to support safety and, given the assumptions, provides 86 to 
99% power for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, which can be considered overpowered for 
efficacy. 
The primary analysis was based on a treatment-policy estimand with appropriate choices for handling 
intercurrent events, using data after non-adherence or initiation of other anti-obesity treatments. This is a 
conservative approach and acceptable. As secondary, a hypothetical estimand was used, ignoring data after 
non-adherence or initiation of anti-obesity treatment, which will provide supportive evidence of the treatment 
effect as if all patients adhered and did not need initiation of other therapy. The Applicant has proposed the 
inclusion of these data in the label (in footnotes in section 5.1), although these data were not included in the 
testing hierarchy (SmPC). 
The analysis sets chosen and the observation periods correspond with the chosen estimands and are 
considered acceptable. 
The analysis of the primary and key secondary endpoints used ANCOVA with stratification factor as fixed 
effects (in STEP 2) and baseline value as covariate. Binary endpoints were analysed using logistic regression 
with the same factors. Both are considered standard and acceptable. The sequential testing strategy is 
acceptable. It allows concluding the hypotheses tested in the hierarchy at a controlled level of alpha. 
Missing data was handled using a retrieved drop-out multiple imputation using data from the same treatment 
arm. This follows the primary estimand and is acceptable. Sensitivity analyses (jump-to-reference, LOCF, 
tipping point, MMRM and non-responder imputation) were defined to test the robustness of the primary 
analysis. 
For the hypothetical estimand, analysis was performed using a mixed model for repeated measures using on-
treatment data, which is acceptable for this secondary estimand and supportive for the primary analysis. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The described conduct of the study is in line with GCP. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, no source data 
verification was performed after 23th of March 2020, but a large proportion of the data was verified across 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 132/177 
 
 
 
the STEP trials. As only a small percentage of the verified data was changed due to SDV or other monitoring, 
the non-verified data are considered reliable. 
The baseline variables were overall balanced across treatment groups in each trial. However, the most 
important baseline variable, bodyweight, was not well balanced in STEP 2 and STEP 3. In the STEP 2 study, 
the difference was 0.6 kg. This is, however, considered too small to have affected the results. In STEP 3, the 
difference between treatment groups was 3.2 kg, with the highest mean bodyweight in the semaglutide 
treatment group (106.9 kg). As higher body weight is associated with lower exposure to semaglutide, the 
results from this study could be considered a conservative estimate and is therefore not pursued any further. 
Baseline mean bodyweight between studies also differed. As such, the mean body weight in subjects with 
type 2 diabetes (STEP 2) was 100 kg, whereas body weight in subjects without type 2 diabetes was 105-106 
kg (STEP 2 and STEP 3). In the STEP 1-4 trials, treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg consistently and 
significantly decreased weight during the trial period of 68 weeks compared to placebo. In STEP 1, the ETD 
was -12.4% body weight (95% CI -13.4% to -11.5%). In STEP 3, i.e. with IBT, a comparable observation 
was found (body weight ETD -10.3%, 95% CI -12.0% to -8.6%). Somewhat surprisingly, the mean weight 
change appears comparable between patients treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg in STEP 1 (mean -15.6% (SD 
+/- 10.1)) vs. STEP 3 with IBT (mean -16.5% (SD +/- 10.1)). An additional effect of IBT during treatment 
with semaglutide 2.4 mg based on these results could be considered modest.  
The clinical relevance of the weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg is further supported by the evaluation of 
categorical response on body weight loss (i.e. > 5%, >10%, >15% (confirmatory) and >20% (exploratory) 
body weight loss). The results show a large percentages of responders with a clinically relevant body weight 
loss (> 5% body weight loss, semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo: STEP 1 86.4% vs 31.5%, STEP 2 68.8% vs. 
28.5%, STEP 3 86.6% vs 47.6%). The effects on body weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg were 
accompanied by a loss in waist circumference. A sub-study with DEXA assessments suggests an improved 
body composition. 
In the STEP 2 trials, i.e. in patients with T2D, the effect on body weight was less pronounced compared to 
the findings in STEP 1 and 3, but still statistically significant compared to placebo (ETD -6.2%, 95% CI -7.3% 
to -5.2%). This could be expected based on previous results in patients with T2D and treatment with GLP-1 
analogues (liraglutide 3.0 mg, SCALE trial). The effect on the weight with treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg 
is stronger than the currently authorised semaglutide 1.0 mg (ETD -2.65, 95% CI -3.66 to -1.64).  
As described above, in the STEP 2 trial, T2D patients using insulin were excluded. Currently, Ozempic 
(semaglutide 1.0 mg) is registered for the treatment of diabetes, also combined with insulin treatment. To 
evaluate if patients with T2D and using insulin should be in- or excluded for treatment with semaglutide 2.4 
mg for the indication of weight loss, the data from the SUSTAIN trials with Ozempic 1.0 mg were evaluated.  
In the SUSTAIN trials, semaglutide 1.0 mg has been evaluated in T2D patients without insulin (SUSTAIN 1, 
trial 3623) and as add-on in patients already using insulin (SUSTAIN 5, trial 3627). Weight at baseline is 
comparable in both trials (baseline weight total group SUSTAIN 1: 91.9 kg, SUSTAIN 5: 91.7 kg). The effect 
on weight of semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. placebo in these trials appears similar (weight change (kg); SUSTAIN 1, 
semaglutide 1.0 mg -4.53 kg, placebo -0.98, ETD -3.56, 95% CI -4.74 to -2.38; SUSTAIN 5 (add-on baseline 
insulin use) semaglutide 1.0 mg -6.42 kg, placebo -1.36, ETD -5.06, 95% CI -6.08 to -4.04). Also HbA1c 
effects were similar in both trials (change HbA1c (%) SUSTAIN 1: -1.53, 95%CI -1.81 to -1.25, SUSTAIN 5: 
ETD -1.75, 95%CI -2.01 to -1.50). Although there is no data in T2D patients using insulin and using add-on 
semaglutide 2.4 mg, it is considered plausible, based on the data with semaglutide 1.0 mg, that these 
patients also benefit from treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg. 
Assessment report

Subjects who discontinued treatment had a higher bodyweight at week 68 than those who stayed on 
treatment, which was seen in the semaglutide group as well in the placebo group, which is not surprising. In 
STEP 1 and 3 there was steep increase in body weight among those who discontinued, but the body weight 
was still lower than the placebo group.  In STEP 4, patients that switched after 20 weeks of semaglutide 2.4 
mg to placebo regained weight as expected. However, 48 weeks later, a mean body weight reduction of 
5.02% was still present compared to baseline. These findings do not suggest that there is a rebound effect 
with a risk of gaining weight compared to baseline, after stopping semaglutide 2.4 mg.  
The STEP 2 trial shows an improvement in glycaemic control in T2D patients using semaglutide 2.4 mg vs 
placebo, with an ETD of HbA1c (%) -1.23% (95% CI -1.42 to -1.05). This difference is comparable to the 
HbA1c effect of the currently registered semaglutide 1.0% (HbA1c semaglutide 2.4 mg vs 1.0 mg ETD -0.2, 
95% CI -0.3 to 0.0). Therefore, it could be suggested that for T2D patients, there is mainly an additional 
benefit using semaglutide 2.4 mg for improvement in weight management, but not on glycaemic control. 
Evaluating the proportion of clinically relevant HbA1c changes, the proportion of patients that reached the 
target of HbA1c <7% was larger in the semaglutide group (78.5%) vs placebo (26.5%). As treatment with 
oral glucose lowering agents or insulin could be changed during the trial period, this could affect the 
interpretation of these results. The patients that started insulin differed between the treatment groups 
(2 subjects (0.5%) in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group, 5 subjects (1.2%) in the semaglutide 1.0 mg group and 
18 subjects (4.5%) in the placebo group). Also the proportion of patients that decreased OAD (semaglutide 
2.4 mg 27.1% and semaglutide 1.0 mg 24.0% compared to placebo 6.8%) or increased OAD (semaglutide 
2.4 mg 4.6% and semaglutide 1.0 mg 4.9% compared to placebo 23.0%). However, the difference between 
semaglutide 2.4 mg and 1.0 mg is modest.  
In the patients without diabetes (i.e. STEP 1 and 3), improvement of glycaemic control was noted during 
semaglutide 2.4 mg. The clinical relevance of the small effects on HbA1c and FPG is doubtful. However, some 
patients with pre-diabetes improved to normoglycaemia (semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo: STEP 1 84.1% vs 
47.8%, STEP 3 89.5% vs 55%), which is considered relevant. 
Treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg also decreased SBP (confirmatory) and DBP (exploratory) in STEP 1-3 
studies. Again, this effect was less pronounced for T2D patients in the STEP 2 trial and there was no effect on 
diastolic blood pressure in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Also, the effect on lipids (exploratory) was found 
across the trials, but there were some discrepancies. In subjects with type 2 diabetes, the effect was smaller 
compared to subjects without type 2 diabetes and there was no effect on LDL cholesterol in subjects with 
type 2 diabetes.  This could partly be explained by a large number of subjects using lipid lowering medication 
in the STEP 2 trial, i.e. 60%, as could be expected from a population with T2D. This may hamper an 
additional measurable effect on LDL by semaglutide. The baseline level of LDL was also lower in the STEP 2 
trial (baseline mean LDL 2.3) compared to STEP 1 (baseline mean LDL 2.9). It is questionable if the 
difference in lipid lowering medication explains all the differences between the effect in subjects with and 
without T2D. However, for the other lipid levels (i.e. triglyceride, FFA, VLDL and HDL) a beneficial effect was 
observed in the STEP 2 trial with semaglutide 2.4 mg. In the STEP 3 study and STEP 4 study there was no 
effect on HDL cholesterol. The finding in the STEP 3 trial could be explained by the smaller treatment effect of 
semaglutide in the STEP 3 trial on HDL by the additional effect of IBT observed in both treatment groups. 
This may influence the interpretation of the treatment results compared to STEP 1. However, the effect of IBT 
(comparing the data on lipid profile of STEP 1 and 3) is less for the other lipid levels. Although heterogeneity 
was observed in the results on serum lipids, in general a positive effect on serum lipids was observed.  
With regards to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), some unexpected findings were present. The 
Applicant has explained that the PAI-1 activity was analysed on a central laboratory, and that the routine 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 134/177 
 
 
 
biochemistry analyses were analysed at other central accredited laboratories. The analysis of PAI-1 was for 
research only, whereas the other laboratories for the routine measures had standardised and strict quality 
control measures. Therefore, the unexpected findings on PAI-1 do not question the reliability of the other 
laboratory measures.  
The clinical relevance of the PRO’s was discussed in the Scientific advice. The PRO’s of the SF-36 PF and 
IWQOL-Lite-CT PF score were analysed as confirmatory secondary endpoints (change from baseline). The 
additional SF-36 and IWQOL-Lite-CT scores were supportive endpoints. The effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg vs. 
placebo on both PRO’s was more and statistically significant in STEP 1 (SF-36 PF ETD 1.80, 95% CI 1.18 to 
2.42; IWQOL-Lite-CT PF ETD 9.43, 95% CI 7.50 to 11.35) and STEP 2 (SF-36 PF ETD 1.52, 95% CI 0.44 to 
2.61; IWQOL-Lite-CT PF ETD 4.83, 95% CI 1.79 to 7.86). The treatment differences are consistent and 
statistically significant, but appear small and the clinical relevance of these ETDs are not demonstrated. A 
greater proportion of subjects achieving clinically meaningful improvements in physical functioning were seen 
for both PRO’s in STEP 1 and 2. However, these results were supportive secondary endpoints and do not 
demonstrate a clinically relevant finding.  
The Applicant performed additional sub-group analyses. The Applicant describes that apart from sex (STEP 1, 
2, 4) and baseline body weight (STEP 1 and STEP 4), the efficacy response to semaglutide 2.4 mg was 
consistent across sub-populations. In STEP 1 and 2, female subjects lost on average more weight compared 
with male subjects (semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo, STEP 1 male ETD -8.02, 95% CI -9.79 to -6.35, female 
ETD -14.00, 95% CI -15.06 to -12.94; STEP 2 male ETD -4.63, 95% CI -6.11 to -3.15, female ETD -7.48, 
95% CI -9.06 to -5.09). As described above and especially in STEP 1, the number of female patients was 
considerably larger than males, which could drive the mean overall results. Additional analyses showed that 
the weight loss increased in an exposure-dependent manner within both males and females. Within both 
STEP 1 and 2 trials, the weight loss at a given exposure level appears larger in females than males. These 
analyses suggested that exposure differences cannot explain all differences between genders and that a 
difference in baseline weight between male and female subjects does not explain the treatment difference.  
The effects of gender were, however, not observed in the STEP 3 trial, were treatment with semaglutide 2.4 
mg vs placebo was evaluated combined with IBT. The Applicant explains this lack of observed gender 
difference in weight partly by the small sample size and by consequence a large confidence interval. 
Nevertheless, the point estimate in female subjects on weight changes was lower compared to male subjects 
(weight change (%) semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo STEP 3; primary analysis -10.27, 95%CI -11.97 to -
8.57; female -10.12, 95%CI -11.95 to -8.29; male -11.07, 95%CI -15.62 to -6.53). Differences in adherence 
to the intensive lifestyle intervention may partly explain these results. Although uncertainties remain 
regarding the mechanism and consistency on gender differences on the effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg 
treatment for weight loss, in both genders a clinically relevant weight loss is observed.  
A reduced treatment effect based on baseline body weight was mainly present in the group of patients with a 
body weight > 115kg (body weight change in % STEP 1 overall ETD -14.74, 95% CI -16.00 to -13.50, 
baseline body weight > 115kg overall ETD -7.87, 95% CI -10.73 tot -5.0). It could therefore be anticipated 
that there will be an overall lower % body weight change in patients with an initial high body weight vs low 
body weight, who initiates treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg. However, as the effect remains significant and 
clinically relevant, this is not considered a large issue.  
The treatment effect in subjects with type 2 diabetes (STEP 2) was markedly lower than in subjects without 
type 2 diabetes (STEP 1 and STEP 3). Based on data from the Saxenda clinical development programme and 
published literature on weight loss in patients with T2D, it was expected to see a lower treatment effect in 
subjects with T2D (STEP 2) than in subjects without T2D (STEP 1, 3 and 4). The physiological explanation 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 135/177 
 
 
 
with regards to the counteracting insulinotropic effect can to some extend supports the difference in weight 
loss. The glucosuria theory supports that weight loss attenuates when the patient goes from being 
hyperglycaemic to normoglycaemic. Even though the weight loss is lower in subjects with T2D, the placebo-
controlled weight loss is considered clinically relevant.  
It could be speculated that the known gastro-intestinal side effects are largely contributing to the effect on 
weight loss. Especially considering the large proportion of patients with gastrointestinal AEs. However, the 
additional analysis dividing patients with and without gastrointestinal AEs, only a modest difference of 
approximately 1% between the groups in weight change is observed. This does not appear to be an 
explanation for the observed weight loss during semaglutide treatment. 
In all 4 studies, the maintenance dose of 2.4 was tested and compared with placebo. The dose was escalated 
every 4th week, and at week 16, the maintenance dose was reached. If the subjects did not tolerate the 
target dose of 2.4 mg, the dose was decreased to 1.7 mg. There is insufficient evidence to support a lower 
maintenance dose. Treatment should therefore be discontinued if the maintenance dose 2.4 mg is not 
tolerated. The Applicant has provided weight loss data on those subjects which were persistently treated with 
a lower dose of semaglutide than 2.4 mg from week 52 to 68. In those 70 subjects, the weight loss was 
19%. The Applicant also provided body weight data on subjects who lowered the dose or who did never reach 
the final dose of 2.4 mg. Despite a temporarily or permanently lower dose in these subjects, a clinically 
relevant weight loss was seen in these subjects in STEP 1, STEP 2, and STEP 3.  
To evaluate the application of a ‘stopping rule’, as described in the Guideline (Guideline on clinical evaluation 
of medicinal products used in weight management (2016 EMA/CHMP/311805/2014)), the Applicant provided 
analyses for the predictive value of non-responders (responders defined as at least 5% body weight loss at 
20 weeks of treatment) with semaglutide 2.4% on clinically relevant weight loss (>5%) after 68 weeks in the 
STEP 4 trial and in additional analyses in STEP 1 and 2 trial. In the STEP 4 trial, the majority of subjects (719 
of 803 subjects, 89.5%) had achieved a weight loss ≥5% at week 20. Approximately half of the subjects who 
were week 20 (5%) non-responders with semaglutide still achieved a ≥5% weight reduction after a further 
48 weeks of treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg (estimated percentage of week 68 [5%] responders: 
51.95%), while only few of the week 20 (5%) non-responders who switched to placebo at week 20 became 
week 68 (5%) responders (estimated percentage: 11.36%).  The Applicant proposes not to include a 
stopping rule in the SmPC. Using a stopping rule at week 28 will exclude patients from relevant treatment, as 
among early non-responders the proportion of patients achieving a weight loss at week 68 was substantial 
(40.5% and 31.9%). However, even without a stopping rule, regular evaluation concerning treatment 
discontinuation is needed and this is considered to fall within the regular clinical practice.  
In STEP 1 adherence to diet registration and increased physical activity were assessed. Adherence to diet 
registration and increased physical activity during the trial was higher in the semaglutide group compared 
with placebo. The Applicant discussed that the dietary registration might be explained by the lower appetite 
and weight loos, as subjects with the lower appetite are more motivated to record their diet than subjects 
who cannot control their diet. The weight loss could also lead to higher motivation of physical activity. The 
difference in physical activity at the end of the trial was 60 minutes per week, and even though this is a 
substantial difference, it is not likely that the weight loss is caused by this difference.  
In STEP 1 a sub-study that included DEXA scans were conducted. The study showed a statistically significant 
reduction in total fat mass of -7.0 kg (95% CI: -9.8; -4.2) and in visceral fat mass of -0.3 kg (95% CI: -0.4; 
-0.1). Lean body weight also decreased more with semaglutide than with placebo, but relative to total body 
weight, lean body weight increased. These results underline that the weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg is 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 136/177 
 
 
 
mainly due to loss of fat mass, which is acknowledged. The loss of lean body weight is a usual phenomenon 
during a weight loss programme.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy  
The STEP 1 and 3 trials showed convincingly that semaglutide 2.4 mg induces clinically relevant body weight 
loss in obese patients with or without IBT. In STEP 2 the effect in subjects with type 2 diabetes was lower 
than the effect seen in subjects without type 2 diabetes. Also in male vs. female subjects the effect on body 
weight was lower and in patients with a higher body weight (> 115kg) at baseline. However, in all groups the 
achieved weight loss is considered clinically relevant.   
2.6.8.  Clinical safety  
The four phase 3a trials (referred to as STEP 1−4) serve as the primary foundation for evaluating the safety 
of semaglutide 2.4 mg, as these trials investigated the intended target population, had a similar treatment 
duration, investigated once-weekly dosing of semaglutide 2.4 mg and contribute with the majority of the 
total exposure to semaglutide 2.4 mg. Safety data from the phase 2 dose-finding trial contribute to the dose-
response evaluation. 
Figure 51 provides an overview of the pool, groups and trials used to evaluate the different safety topics and 
populations. The pooling strategy was agreed. 
Figure 51 
Overview of the pool, groups and trials evaluating different safety topics or 
different populations 
T2D: type 2 diabetes. STEP 2: Safety evaluations include assessments of both the 2.4 mg dose and the 1.0 
mg dose (only evaluated for safety areas specific to a T2D population, i.e. retinal disorders and 
hypoglycaemic episodes). 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure  
The phase 3a pool comprises STEP 1‒4 and includes the semaglutide 2.4 mg groups (the intended 
maintenance dose) and the placebo groups and uses the randomised, placebo-controlled period of the trials. 
The 20-week run-in period of STEP 4 is omitted since this period is not placebo-controlled. The phase 3a pool 
represents the majority of the total exposure, with 2650 subjects exposed to semaglutide 2.4 mg and 1529 
to placebo. 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 137/177 
 
 
 
 
 
The phase 3a dose-escalation group comprises STEP 1‒3, but excludes STEP 4, as the randomised, placebo-
controlled period of this trial did not include dose-escalation, which had taken place during the uncontrolled, 
20-week run-in period. The phase 3a dose-escalation group was used for the evaluation of gastrointestinal 
AEs, which are most frequent during the dose-escalation phase. The phase 3a with T2D trial (STEP 2) was 
used for the safety evaluation, specifically in subjects with T2D (including evaluation of hypoglycaemic 
episodes and retinal disorders). The phase 3a without T2D group comprised STEP 1, 3 and 4 and was used to 
evaluate hypoglycaemia in subjects without T2D and the impact of glycaemic status (normo-glycaemic or 
pre-diabetes). The evaluation of dose-response on safety was based on STEP 2 (semaglutide 1.0 and 2.4 mg 
once weekly) and the phase 2 dose-finding trial 4153 (semaglutide 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mg once 
daily). 
The treatment groups were generally well-balanced with regards to demographics, baseline characteristics, 
medical history, concomitant illnesses and concomitant medication at baseline and where differences were 
present, these could be explained by a lower proportion of subjects with T2D in the semaglutide 2.4 mg 
group compared to the placebo group, due to differences in randomisation ratio between STEP 2 (1:1) and 
the other STEP trials (2:1).  
The subject disposition was similar in the two treatment groups, with the exception of less subjects that 
permanently discontinued trial product with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo and more subjects that 
permanently discontinued trial product due to AEs with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo (driven by 
gastrointestinal AEs). 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events  
The proportions of subjects with AEs, SAEs and severe AEs were slightly larger with semaglutide 2.4 mg 
compared to placebo in the phase 3a pool (Figure 52). 
Figure 52 
Adverse events overview – on treatment – phase 3a pool 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 138/177 
 
 
 
 
Most of the AEs were non-serious and mild or moderate, and most subjects had recovered by the end of the 
trials. The proportion of subjects with AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was low in both 
treatment groups but larger with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo (5.7% vs 3.0%), driven by 
gastrointestinal AEs.  
Regardless of treatment group, the reporting of the first event mainly occurred during the first 20 weeks of 
treatment, i.e. during the dose-escalation period. However, the time to first event was shorter with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo with approximately 50% of subjects reporting their first event during 
the first 5 weeks, a pattern that was again driven by gastrointestinal disorders. 
AEs were reported by a comparable proportion of subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo within all 
SOCs, except for gastrointestinal disorders and nervous system disorders (Figure 53). A difference between 
semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo was also seen for the 2 SOCs: general disorders and administration site 
conditions and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. 
As expected for a drug within the GLP-1 RA drug class, Gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequent 
types of reported AEs, and these events were reported more often with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to 
placebo. The following PTs were reported by ≥5% of subjects and more often with semaglutide 2.4 mg 
compared to placebo: Nausea (38.3% vs 14.0%), Diarrhoea (26.8% vs 14.3%), Constipation (21.8% vs 
10.2%), Vomiting (21.8% vs 5.7%), Abdominal pain (8.4% vs 4.0%), Dyspepsia (7.6% vs 2.7%), Abdominal 
pain upper (7.1% vs 3.6%), Eructation (6.5% vs 0.4%), Abdominal distension (6.3% vs 4.3%) and 
Flatulence (5.3% vs 3.7%). (see Figure 54). 
A larger proportion of subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo reported events within the SOC 
Nervous system disorders. This difference was driven by the PTs Headache (12.8% vs 8.7%) and Dizziness 
(6.8% vs 3.3%) that were reported for more than 5% of subjects. There was 1 SAE of Headache, and there 
were 3 subjects who permanently discontinued treatment with trial product due to Headache. There was 1 
SAE of Dizziness with semaglutide 2.4 mg assessed as severe, the subject recovered from the event. 2 
subjects permanently discontinued treatment with the trial product due to Dizziness.  
General disorders and administration site conditions showed a small difference with more AEs in subjects 
treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo; this difference was mainly driven by the PT Fatigue 
(7.9% vs 3.6%). Using the grouped term for Fatigue, the proportion of subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg vs 
placebo was 10.6% vs 5.1% in the phase 3a dose-escalation group.  
The PT Decreased appetite belonging to the SOC Metabolism and nutrition disorders was reported by ≥5% of 
subjects, and these events occurred more often with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo (7.8% vs 
2.8%).  
Less common PTs reported more frequently with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo (by ≥2 to <5% of 
subjects) were overall well-known side effects of the GLP-1 RA class, with the only addition being alopecia. A 
higher proportion of subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg than placebo in the phase 3a pool (3.3% vs 1.4%) 
reported AEs for the PT Alopecia that belongs to the SOC Skin subcutaneous tissue disorders. There were 3 
events with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 1 event with placebo leading to permanent treatment discontinuation.

Deaths

A total of 8 deaths were reported in the completed clinical trials: 7 deaths in the STEP trials and 1 death in 
the phase 2 dose-finding trial (trial 4153). There were no deaths in the clinical pharmacology trials. All 
reported deaths were among subjects who had been exposed to trial product and occurred between 
randomisation and until DBL in the individual trials. 
Based on the phase 3a pool (which covered 6 of the 8 reported deaths), there was no difference between 
semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo in the proportion of subjects who died (3 subjects [0.1%] in the semaglutide 
2.4 mg group and 3 subjects [0.2%] in the placebo group). The 3 deaths in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group 
were classified as cardiovascular deaths, which included one death where the cause of death was 
undetermined. The 3 deaths in the placebo group were all classified as death due to malignancy. The last 2 
reported deaths included: 1 death in the semaglutide 1.0 mg group in STEP 2, which was classified as an 
undetermined cause of death, and 1 death in the semaglutide 0.4 mg once-daily fast escalation group in trial 
4153, which was classified as due to malignancy. 
Other serious events 
The proportion of subjects with SAEs was larger with semaglutide 2.4 mg (9.3%) than with placebo (6.4%), 
driven by gallbladder disorders and gastrointestinal AEs. 
The majority of subjects were reported to have recovered from their SAEs. The proportions of subjects with 
SAEs reported as not recovered, recovered with sequelae, and deaths were comparable between semaglutide 
2.4 mg and placebo. About half of the events were severe with both semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo. For the 
majority of the events, the investigator-assessed the relationship to the trial product as unlikely.  
The proportion of subjects with SAEs (Table 41) leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was 
comparable with semaglutide 2.4 mg (1.0%) and placebo (0.8%).

Adverse events leading to permanent or temporary treatment discontinuation  
Overall, the proportion of subjects with AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was higher with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo (5.7% vs 3.0%), driven by gastrointestinal disorders, mainly the PTs: 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain upper, and constipation.

Evaluations relevant to dosing 
Dose-dependency was evaluated for STEP 2 (semaglutide 1.0 mg and 2.4 mg) and focused on areas for 
which treatment differences disfavouring semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo had been observed in the phase 3a 
pool, including single PTs (gastroenteritis, headache, dizziness, fatigue, decreased appetite and alopecia), 
gastrointestinal disorders, gallbladder-related disorders, hypoglycaemic episodes, retinal disorders, lipase and 
amylase, and pulse. The evaluation was supplemented with exposure-response analyses for gastrointestinal 
AEs based on STEP 1 and 2. 
Dose-response was observed for gastrointestinal AEs (mainly nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting constipation and 
eructation). A dose-response was also seen for AEs of fatigue and decreased appetite. The results for STEP 2 
were overall consistent with the observations from the phase 2 dose-finding trial. 
Safety focus areas  
An overview of the results for the safety focus areas is provided in Figure 55.

Gastrointestinal disorders 
A dose-escalation regimen, with 4-week increments to reach the 2.4 mg maintenance dose, was used to 
mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal side effects and improve the tolerability profile. 
Since the incidence of gastrointestinal AEs is highest during the dose-escalation period and decreases over 
time as subjects get used to treatment (or those who do not tolerate treatment have discontinued 
treatment), the evaluation of gastrointestinal disorders was based on the phase 3a dose-escalation group 
comprising STEP 1–3. 
Based on the dose-escalation group, gastrointestinal AEs were reported for 72.9% of subjects on semaglutide 
2.4 mg compared to 47.1% of subjects on placebo. As expected, the incidence of gastrointestinal AEs was 
highest during the initial 20 weeks of treatment (covering the dose-escalation period), after which it started 
to level off and become more on par with the level in the placebo group (Figure 56). 
Figure 56 
Gastrointestinal disorders over time ‒ pre-defined MedDRA search ‒ on-treatment ‒ 
phase 3a dose escalation group 
Gastrointestinal AEs led to permanent discontinuation of trial product in 4.3% of subjects in the semaglutide 
2.4 mg group vs 0.7% in the placebo group. 
The majority of events were mild or moderate in severity and had onset during the dose-escalation period. 
Nausea, Diarrhoea, Vomiting and Constipation were the most frequently reported gastrointestinal AEs and 
reported more frequently with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo. The proportion of subjects reporting 
any Abdominal pain was higher with semaglutide 2.4 mg (19.7%) than with placebo (10.0%).  
The proportion of subjects reporting any Gastritis during the randomised periods of the trials was higher with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg (3.6%) than with placebo (1.3%). The prevalence of any Gastritis increased until week

50 where it reached a plateau with approximately 1.1% of subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg having 
Gastritis at any given day.  
A higher proportion of subjects reported Haemorrhoids with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo (2.1% vs 
0.4%).  
Timing and duration of gastrointestinal AEs 
With semaglutide, the prevalence of gastrointestinal AEs increased during the initial 20 weeks of treatment, 
where it peaked with approximately 38% of subjects having at least one gastrointestinal AE on a given day. 
In the placebo group, the prevalence of gastrointestinal AEs was stable during the study at approximately 
11%. The prevalences of Nausea, Diarrhoea, Vomiting and Constipation increased during dose escalation and 
thereafter, the prevalence of Nausea, Diarrhoea and Vomiting gradually decreased over time (Figure 57). 
However, the prevalence of nausea was still much higher with semaglutide compared to placebo after 68 
weeks (approximately 10 vs 1%). Importantly, the prevalence of Constipation remained increased 
throughout the trials.

This increase in gastrointestinal AEs and gastrointestinal AEs leading to premature trial product 
discontinuation was dose-dependent (STEP 2 and trial 4153).

Gallbladder related disorders 
During the on-treatment period in the phase 3a pool, AEs of gallbladder-related disorders were reported by a 
higher proportion of subjects and with a higher event rate with semaglutide 2.4 mg (2.5%, 2.4 events per 
100 PYE) than with placebo (1.6%, 1.5 events per 100 PYE). There were more events of gallbladder-related 
disorders with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo in the phase 3a pool driven by events of 
Cholelithiasis (1.6% vs 1.1%). The increased risk of events of gallbladder-related disorders with semaglutide 
2.4 mg compared to placebo may be at least partly explained by the larger weight loss. 
Pancreatitis and pancreatic enzymes 
Based on the EAC-confirmed events of acute pancreatitis in the phase 3a pool during the on-treatment 
period, there was a slightly increased risk of acute pancreatitis with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to 
placebo. There were 4 EAC-confirmed events of acute pancreatitis with semaglutide 2.4 mg (0.2%) and 1 
with placebo (<0.1). 
All 4 events were confirmed as acute pancreatitis by adjudication. The adjudication process identified two 
additional events in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm: 1 investigator reported AE with the PT lipase increased and 
1 recurrent event in a subject with an already reported AE of acute pancreatitis. Thus, 6 EAC-confirmed 
events of acute pancreatitis were identified in total: 5 events in 4 subjects (0.2%) with semaglutide 2.4 mg 
and 1 event in 1 subject (<0.1%) with placebo. In all cases, the subjects had symptoms of upper abdominal 
pain and elevated pancreatic enzymes.  
For 3 of the 4 events in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group, imaging data were available and were for 2 of the 
events consistent with gallstones but actually not with acute pancreatitis, and for 1 event, there were no 
abnormal findings. For the event in the placebo group, imaging data were consistent with acute pancreatitis 
and gallstones and thus seemed to be a gallstone-related pancreatitis, and the event resolved after acute 
cholecystectomy. 
Mean lipase and amylase levels increased with semaglutide 2.4 mg. At week 68, lipase levels seemed to have 
reached a plateau with a 39% increase while amylase levels had increased by 16% and seemingly had not 
levelled off.  
Cardiovascular outcomes 
The effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly on cardiovascular outcomes is currently being investigated in a 
dedicated CVOT, SELECT (trial EX9536-4388) in subjects with established cardiovascular disease and obesity 
or overweight (without T2D). 
Overall, there was no increased risk of cardiovascular disorders for semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo, based on 
the phase 3a pool (and the in-trial period). AEs of cardiovascular disorders were reported by a lower 
proportion of subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo (8.7% vs 10.9%). 
A total of 20 EAC-confirmed first MACEs were reported by the same proportion of subjects with semaglutide 
2.4 mg and placebo (0.5% for both treatments). The estimated HR for time to first EAC-confirmed MACE was 
0.991 [0.400; 2.456]95% CI for semaglutide 2.4 mg relative to placebo, indicating no increased 
cardiovascular risk. 
Pulse 
Across STEP 1‒3 and the run-in period of STEP 4, pulse increases were observed in the semaglutide 2.4 mg 
group. The ETD (semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo) for mean increases in pulse from baseline to week 68 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 146/177 
 
 
 
ranged from 1−4 bpm. The pulse increases were comparable to what has been reported with semaglutide 
s.c. for T2D (2−5 bpm for semaglutide 1.0 mg vs placebo) and oral semaglutide for T2D (3−4 bpm for 
semaglutide 14 mg vs placebo). 
A total of 26.0% of subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group had an increase (from baseline) in pulse of ≥20 
beats/min at one or more timepoints during the on-treatment period compared to 15.6% in the placebo 
group.  
There was no treatment difference in the reporting of AEs within the HLGT Cardiac arrhythmias (sema 2.4 
mg: 2.3%, 2.1 events per 100 PYE, placebo: 2.0%, 1.9 events per 100 PYE) in the phase 3a pool. 
Neoplasms 
In the phase 3a pool, AEs of neoplasms (benign and malignant) were reported by a comparable proportion of 
subjects and at a comparable event rate with semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo (6.9% vs 7.1% and 6.3 vs 6.2 
events per 100 PYO) for the in-trial period, and with no apparent treatment differences on SOC and HLGT 
level. Comparable proportions of subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo reported AEs within specific 
focus areas for neoplasms (benign and malignant): breast (1.1% vs 1.2%), skin (0.8% vs 1.1%) and 
colorectal (0.8% vs 0.8%). 
Few AEs of malignant neoplasms were reported in the phase 3a pool and by a similar proportion of subjects 
for semaglutide 2.4 mg (1.1%) and placebo (1.1%). There were no apparent imbalances between 
semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo in the types of malignant neoplasms reported. Approximately half of the 
events were serious. Three events in the placebo group had a fatal outcome. 
No events of pancreatic cancer were reported. No events of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) were 
reported. Calcitonin level ≥50 ng/L was detected in one subject at the baseline visit only. 
Hepatic disorders 
Based on the phase 3a pool, hepatic disorder AEs were reported by a comparable proportion of subjects and 
at comparable event rates with semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo (2.3% vs 2.7% and 2.1 vs 2.7 events per 
100 PYE). The majority of the events were mild and related to increases in hepatic enzymes.  Hepatic 
steatosis was reported for slightly fewer subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg (0.5%) compared to placebo 
(1.0%). 
There were no cases of Hy’s law (concurrent elevations of AST/ALT and TBL and no alternative aetiology) in 
the semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight management programme. Mean levels of ALT decreased with both 
semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo, both to a larger extent with semaglutide 2.4 mg (26% vs 13%). AST and 
ALP decreased by 12% and 10%, respectively, with semaglutide 2.4 mg but remained fairly stable with 
placebo (decreases of 4% and 3%). Mean total bilirubin increased by 15% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and by 
6% with placebo. 
Renal failure 
In the phase 3a pool, there were few AEs of acute renal failure and these were reported for a comparable 
proportion of subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo (0.4% vs 0.3%) and with identical event rates 
(0.3 events per 100 PYE in both groups). Most events were mild or moderate, and the majority of subjects 
recovered. The majority of the events were assessed as unlikely related to trial product and none of the 
events in either treatment group led to permanent treatment discontinuation. 
There was no apparent association between AEs of vomiting or diarrhoea and AEs of acute renal failure. 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 147/177 
 
 
 
Ratio to baseline levels for the renal function parameters eGFR and creatinine (phase 3a dose escalation 
group) were comparable with semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo at end of treatment (week 68). Improvements 
were seen for UACR (assessed in the phase 3a with T2D trial [STEP 2]) that decreased by 24% with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg and increased by 17% with placebo. 
Hypoglycaemia 
In the phase 3a without T2D group (STEP 1, 3 and 4), the proportion of subjects and rates of events of 
hypoglycaemia were low and comparable between semaglutide 2.4 and placebo (0.6% vs 0.7% of subjects 
and 0.7 vs 0.8 events per 100 PYE). There were no SAEs in either of the two treatment groups, none of the 
events were severe and none of the AEs led to permanent trial product discontinuation.  
In the phase 3a with T2D trial (STEP 2), the proportion of subjects with hypoglycaemic episodes and the rate 
of episodes (ADA 2018/IHSG 2017 level 2: glucose <3 mmol/L)) was higher with semaglutide 2.4 mg 
compared to placebo (6.2% vs 2.5% of subjects and 10.7 vs 3.2 episodes per 100 PYE). Only 
1 hypoglycaemic episode was reported as severe. The episode occurred in a subject in the semaglutide 
2.4 mg group during dose escalation. More than half of the hypoglycaemic episodes (level 2 and 3) occurred 
when trial product was used in combination with SUs, which themselves are associated with an increased risk 
of hypoglycaemia.  
Retinal adverse events 
In STEP 2, a total of 85 AEs of retinal disorders were identified by the pre-defined MedDRA search. These 
events were reported by a larger proportion of subjects with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 2.4 mg compared to 
placebo (6.2%, 6.9% and 4.2%, respectively). Risk of new onset or worsening of diabetic retinopathy was 
also higher with high-dose semaglutide in STEP 2, with such events observed in 12, 19 and 11 subjects with 
semaglutide 1.0 mg, semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo, respectively.  No SAEs were reported for any of the 
treatment groups and the majority of the events were mild. The events were identified during routine 
assessments and were not based on emergence of eye-related symptoms. For the majority of events, no 
treatment was deemed necessary, only observation. 
Eye examinations (fundus photography or a dilated fundoscopy) were performed at baseline, at week 52 and 
at end of treatment (week 68).  
Psychiatric disorders 
During the on-treatment period, AEs of psychiatric disorders were reported at a comparable frequency and 
rate with semaglutide 2.4 mg (9.3% of subjects, 10.0 events per 100 PYE) and placebo (10.7% of subjects, 
12.1 events per 100 PYE) in the phase 3a pool. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings  
Mean values of haematological parameters and biochemistry parameters (not covered under a safety focus 
area) were within the normal range, stable over time and comparable for semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo. 
For creatine kinase, the ratio to baseline at week 20 decreased 22% in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group 
compared to 3% decrease in the placebo group. These levels did not decrease further at the week 52 visit or 
at the end of-treatment visit (week 68).

2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations  
Subgroup analyses 
The potential impact of various intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg 
versus placebo was evaluated based on data from the on-treatment period for the phase 3a pool.  
Sex 
More pronounced treatment differences in the reporting of AEs for females vs males were seen for the 
Gastrointestinal disorders SOC incl. the PTs Nausea, Diarrhoea, Constipation and Vomiting; the Metabolism 
and nutrition disorders SOC incl. the PT Decreased appetite; the Nervous system disorders SOC incl. the PTs 
Headache and Dizziness. 
These more pronounced treatment differences are likely related to the lower body weight and thus a higher 
exposure in females. There was no marked difference in exposure between males and females when 
adjusting for other covariates than baseline body weight  
Age 
More pronounced treatment differences in the reporting of AEs with increasing age (largest for subjects ≥75 
years and lowest for subjects <65 years) were seen for the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC incl. PTs Nausea, 
Vomiting, Constipation and GERD, the Nervous system disorders SOC incl. the PT Dizziness; the PT Fatigue.  
Race 
Asian subjects compared to the other subgroups by race had a more pronounced treatment difference in the 
reporting of AEs with PT Decreased appetite; no treatment difference in the reporting of AEs with PT 
Headache.  
Black/African American subjects compared to the other subgroups by race had less pronounced treatment 
differences in the reporting of AEs within the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC mostly due to lower reporting of 
AEs with PTs Diarrhoea and Vomiting. Treatment differences for AEs, SAEs, severe AEs and AEs leading to 
permanent trial product discontinuation appeared comparable across subgroups by ethnic origin except for 
AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of trial product where no treatment difference was observed in 
subjects of Hispanic or Latino origin.  
Body weight/BMI 
More pronounced treatment differences in the reporting of AEs among subjects with a baseline body weight 
of <90 kg were seen for the PT Decreased appetite and the PT Fatigue. 
The more pronounced treatment difference in reporting of AEs of Decreased appetite among subjects with a 
baseline body weight of <90 kg could be related to the higher exposure in these subjects. Furthermore, in 
subjects with a baseline body weight of <90 kg a larger proportion of subjects treated with semaglutide 2.4 
mg compared to placebo reported AEs within the Infections and infestations SOC distributed across many 
different PTs; no such treatment difference was seen in the total population. Among subjects with a baseline 
BMI < 30 kg/m2, the treatment difference in reporting of AEs was slightly more pronounced than in the other 
BMI subgroups, but less pronounced for reporting of SAEs, and there was no treatment difference in the 
reporting of severe AEs and AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of trial product in this subgroup. 
Among subjects with a BMI ≥40 kg/m2, the treatment differences in reporting of SAEs and severe AEs were 
more pronounced than in the subjects with BMI ≥30 to <35 kg/m2 or ≥35 to <40 kg/m2. The higher 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 149/177 
 
 
 
reporting of SAEs appeared to be driven by AEs within the Hepatobiliary disorders and Gastrointestinal 
disorders SOCs, while the higher reporting of severe AEs appeared to be driven by AEs within the 
Gastrointestinal disorders SOC.  
Renal function 
For subjects with mild renal impairment versus subjects with normal renal function at baseline, there were no 
noteworthy treatment differences in reporting of AEs, SAEs, severe AEs and AEs leading to permanent 
discontinuation of trial product. 
Among subjects with moderate renal impairment at baseline, the treatment differences in reporting of SAEs, 
severe AEs and AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of trial product were more pronounced than in the 
subjects with normal renal function or mild renal impairment at baseline.  
More pronounced treatment differences in the reporting of AEs with decreasing renal function (mostly for 
moderate renal impairment vs normal renal function) were seen for the Gastrointestinal SOC incl. the PTs 
Nausea, Abdominal pain, Dyspepsia, Flatulence and GERD; the PT Decreased appetite; the Nervous system 
disorders SOC incl. the PTs Dizziness and Headache.  
Region 
The treatment differences in the proportion of subjects reporting of AEs within the Gastrointestinal disorders 
SOC varied across regions:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Africa (~ -2%-points) 
East Asia (~ 11%-points) 
Europe and North America (~24%-points)  
South America (~29%-points)  
Asia (excluding East Asia) (~44%-points). 
For subjects from South America and Asia, there were more pronounced treatment differences in reporting 
several gastrointestinal AEs.  
Weight loss 
The safety profile of subjects within the semaglutide 2.4 mg group who lost 20% or more of their body 
weight compared to those who did not, did not give rise to any safety concerns. The AE types more 
frequently reported among subjects with a large weight loss were gastrointestinal, decreased appetite, 
Alopecia, Dizziness, Headache and Cholelithiasis.  
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events  
Based on the phase 3a pool, immunogenicity-related AEs were reported by comparable proportion of subjects 
with semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo (allergic reactions: 6.9% vs 6.8%; injection site reactions: 4.2% vs 
4.9%). 
The proportion of subjects that tested positive for anti-semaglutide antibodies at any time point post-baseline 
was low (2.9% of subjects with antibody assessment in STEP 1 and 2). For almost half of these subjects, the 
responses were transiently induced, and they only tested positive at a single timepoint. The antibodies levels 
were low for all weeks, with mean levels ranging from 2.01% to 4.93% B/T and median titres of either 15 or 
Assessment report

30. Antibodies cross-reacting with endogenous GLP 1 were detected in 1.6% of subjects randomised to 
semaglutide 2.4 mg. No subjects had anti-semaglutide antibodies with in vitro neutralising effect against 
semaglutide or endogenous GLP-1. 
The formation of anti-semaglutide antibodies influenced the efficacy of semaglutide. Weight loss was 2 kg 
less in individuals with antibodies compared to individuals without. Compared to individuals without 
antibodies, individuals with anti-semaglutide antibodies had an increased risk of allergic reactions (15.7 vs 
6.9%) and injection site reactions (5.9 vs 4.5%). 
There were no anaphylactic reactions reported in the STEP trials, with 3052 subjects exposed to semaglutide 
(2650 subjects to semaglutide 2.4 mg and 402 to semaglutide 1.0 mg. 
2.6.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions  
Please see considerations under ‘Clinical Pharmacology’. 
2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events  
Overall, the proportion of subjects with AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was higher with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo (5.7% vs 3.0%), driven by gastrointestinal disorders, mainly the PTs: 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain upper, and constipation. 
2.6.8.9.  Post marketing experience  
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
The four phase 3a trials (referred to as STEP 1−4) serve as the primary foundation for evaluating the safety 
of semaglutide 2.4 mg, as these trials investigated the intended target population, had a similar treatment 
duration, investigated once-weekly dosing of semaglutide 2.4 mg and contribute with the majority of the 
total exposure to semaglutide 2.4 mg.  
A total of 3052 subjects were exposed to semaglutide (2650 to semaglutide 2.4 mg and 402 to semaglutide 
1.0 mg) and 1529 to placebo during the randomised periods of STEP 1‒4. This is considered sufficient to 
evaluate the safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg in the target population. 
Disposition and characteristics 
The subject disposition was similar in the semaglutide and placebo groups, with the exception of fewer 
subjects that permanently discontinued trial product with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo and more 
subjects that permanently discontinued trial product due to AEs with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo 
(driven by gastrointestinal AEs).  
In the phase 3a pool, there were more female subjects than male subjects (71.6% vs 29.4%); most subjects 
were White (73.8%) and of non-Hispanic/non-Latino ethnicity (86.3%), and they had a mean age of 48 
years, a mean body weight of 102.6 kg and had a mean BMI of 36.8 kg/m2. The number of black and Asian 
individuals may be too small to establish a robust benefit-risk ratio.

The treatment groups were generally well-balanced regarding demographics, baseline characteristics, medical 
history, concomitant illnesses and concomitant medication at baseline.  
Adverse events 
The proportions of subjects with AEs (88.5 vs 83.6%), SAEs (9.3 vs 6.4%) and severe AEs (9.9 vs 6.9%) 
were larger with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo in the phase 3a pool. A larger proportion of 
subjects with AEs led to permanent treatment discontinuation with semaglutide 2.4 mg (5.7 vs 3.0%): this 
was driven by gastrointestinal AEs.  
In the phase 3a pool, AEs were reported by a higher proportion of subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 
placebo within the SOCs Gastrointestinal disorders, Nervous system disorders, General disorders and 
administration site conditions, and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.  
Gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequent types of reported AEs, and these events were reported 
more often with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo. The following PTs were reported by ≥5% of 
subjects and more often with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo: Nausea (38.3% vs 14.0%), 
Diarrhoea (26.8% vs 14.3%), Constipation (21.8% vs 10.2%), Vomiting (21.8% vs 5.7%), Abdominal pain 
(8.4% vs 4.0%), Dyspepsia (7.6% vs 2.7%), Abdominal pain upper (7.1% vs 3.6%), Eructation (6.5% vs 
0.4%), Abdominal distension (6.3% vs 4.3%) and Flatulence (5.3% vs 3.7%). These types of events are 
well-known for semaglutide and for the GLP-1 RA class in general, but the incidence of these adverse events 
appears larger than those with low dose GLP-RA in patients with diabetes. However, the same pattern was 
seen when comparing the placebo groups. The rate of gastrointestinal disorders with semaglutide 2.4 mg was 
around 8% higher (246.3 vs. 227.9 events per 100 patient-years of exposure) compared to Saxenda This 
increase may be relevant for patients, but the effect of semaglutide on weight loss has approximately twice 
the magnitude as seen with Saxenda.  
A larger proportion of subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo reported events within the SOC 
Nervous system disorders. This difference was driven by Headache (12.8% vs 8.7%) and Dizziness (6.8% vs 
3.3%) that were reported for more than 5% of subjects. The frequency of reporting of Headache and 
Dizziness with semaglutide 2.4 mg was similar to that of liraglutide 3.0 mg in Saxenda for weight loss, but 
higher than with the highest doses within the T2D programmes. A possible explanation for this difference 
between the weight management programmes and the T2D programmes appear to be the differences in 
indication and population characteristics and in the weight loss obtained. However, other explanations may 
also be possible. Nevertheless, headache and dizziness have already been reported as a very common 
adverse event in the SPC. 
General disorders and administration site conditions showed a small difference with more AEs in subjects 
treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo, this difference was mainly driven by fatigue: the 
proportion of subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo was 10.6% vs 5.1% in the phase 3a dose-
escalation group. This difference also appears larger than that with high dose liraglutide for weight loss. The 
company hypothesizes that the increased proportion of patients with fatigue may be a secondary effect to the 
gastrointestinal events that was experienced more often in subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to 
placebo. Indeed, subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group who reported Fatigue also reported more 
gastrointestinal AEs than subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group who did not report Fatigue  
The PT Decreased appetite belonging to the SOC Metabolism and nutrition disorders was reported by ≥5% of 
subjects, and these events occurred more often with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo (7.8% vs 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 152/177 
 
 
 
 
2.8%). This is not unexpected. Decreased appetite may be related to the gastrointestinal side effects and/or 
it may also play a role in the weight losing effects of semaglutide.  
A higher proportion of subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo in the phase 3a pool (3.3% vs 
1.4%) reported AEs for the PT Alopecia that belongs to the SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. 
There were 3 events with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 1 event with placebo leading to permanent treatment 
discontinuation. Hair loss in relation to weight loss has been reported in other studies and is described in 
labels for other weight management drugs. A direct effect of semaglutide is not likely Subjects obtaining a 
weight loss of ≥20% with semaglutide 2.4 mg reported events of Alopecia more often than subjects with a 
weight loss <20% Furthermore, when comparing the time of onset of individual events of Alopecia and 
weight loss (%) at the time of onset, most subjects reporting events of Alopecia had a larger than average 
weight loss regardless of treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo. Hair less is reported in the SPC as 
common. 
A larger proportion of subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo in the phase 3a pool (2.1% vs 
1.3%) reported AEs for the PT Migraine that belongs to the SOC Nervous system disorders, which is 
comparable to the finding for the PT Headache.  
Deaths, serious adverse events and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation 
A total of 8 deaths were reported in the semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight management programme: 6 deaths 
were exposed to semaglutide and 2 to placebo. The proportion of subjects with AEs with fatal outcome was 
low and comparable with semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo (0.1% vs 0.2% of subjects) in the phase 3a pool.  
The proportion of subjects with SAEs was larger with semaglutide 2.4 mg (9.3%) compared to placebo 
(6.4%) in the phase 3a pool; this was driven mainly by gallbladder-related disorders and gastrointestinal 
AEs. The proportion of subjects with SAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was comparable 
with semaglutide 2.4 mg (1.0%) and placebo (0.8%). In the phase 3a pool, the proportion of subjects with 
AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation were higher with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo 
(5.7% vs 3.0%), driven by gastrointestinal disorders. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Gastrointestinal AE’s 
Gastrointestinal AEs were the most commonly reported events and were reported more frequently with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo (72.9 vs 47.1%). The majority of events were mild or moderate in 
severity and had onset during the dose-escalation period. Nausea, Diarrhoea, Vomiting and Constipation 
were the most frequently reported gastrointestinal AEs and reported more frequently with semaglutide 2.4 
mg than with placebo. Abdominal pain and gastritis were also more reported with semaglutide 2.4 mg than 
with placebo. A higher proportion of subjects reported Haemorrhoids with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with 
placebo (2.1% vs 0.4%). Obesity and constipation are well-known risk factors for the development of 
haemorrhoids. Among subjects reporting Haemorrhoids in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group, 42% did not report 
Constipation, thus missing a plausible explanation for a causal relationship to semaglutide. No increased risk 
of haemorrhoids with GLP-1 RA has been observed previously. The majority of events of haemorrhoids was 
co-reported with constipation or appeared to be related to constipation, which is a very common adverse 
reaction that is already addressed in the SmPC.

With semaglutide, the prevalence of gastrointestinal AEs increased during the initial 20 weeks of treatment, 
where it peaked with approximately 38% of subjects having at least one gastrointestinal AE on a given day. 
In the placebo group, the prevalence of gastrointestinal AEs was stable during the study at approximately 
11%. The prevalences of Nausea, Diarrhoea, Vomiting and Constipation increased during dose escalation and 
thereafter, the prevalence of Nausea, Diarrhoea and Vomiting gradually decreased over time. However, the 
prevalence of nausea was still much higher with semaglutide compared to placebo after 68 weeks 
(approximately 10 vs 1%). This is in contrast to nausea in previous studies with GLP-1 RA. The higher 
prevalence of nausea in the current studies compared to previous studies may be explained by differences in 
design. In contrast to the previous studies, subjects were allowed to proceed with trial product after 
temporary treatment discontinuations or dose reductions in the current studies. Nausea only led to 
permanent discontinuation of trial product in only 1.8% of subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group. 
Gall bladder related disorders 
During the on-treatment period in the phase 3a pool, AEs of gallbladder-related disorders were reported by a 
higher proportion of subjects and with a higher event rate with semaglutide 2.4 mg (2.5%, 2.4 events per 
100 PYE) than with placebo (1.6%, 1.5 events per 100 PYE). There were more events of gallbladder-related 
disorders with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo in the phase 3a pool driven by events of 
Cholelithiasis (1.6% vs 1.1%). This effect may be more pronounced than that with other GLP-1 RAs, but this 
may be at least partly explained by the larger weight loss with semaglutide. 
Pancreatitis 
Based on the EAC-confirmed events of acute pancreatitis in the phase 3a pool during the on-treatment 
period, there was an increased risk of acute pancreatitis with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo. 
There were 4 EAC-confirmed events of acute pancreatitis with semaglutide 2.4 mg (0.2%) and 1 with placebo 
(<0.1). 
Mean lipase and amylase levels increased with semaglutide 2.4 mg, and at week 68, lipase levels seemed to 
have reached a plateau with a 39% increase while amylase levels had increased by 16% and seemingly had 
not levelled off. In line with other studies, in the absence of other signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis, 
elevations in pancreatic enzymes alone are not predictive of acute pancreatitis. Nevertheless, in the long 
term, chronic deleterious effects on the pancreas may become apparent.  
Cardiovascular disorders 
In the phase 3a pool, AEs of cardiovascular disorders (MedDRA search) were reported at slightly lower 
frequency and rate with semaglutide 2.4 mg (8.7% of subjects, 8.3 events per 100 PYO) vs placebo (10.9% 
of subjects, 10.9 events per 100 PYO). For SAEs within cardiovascular disorders, a comparable proportion of 
subjects had events with semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo (1.6% vs 1.8%). 
There was a total of 20 EAC-confirmed first MACEs, and these were reported by the same proportion of 
subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo (0.5% for both treatments). 
Across STEP 1‒3 and the run-in period of STEP 4, increases in pulse were observed in the semaglutide 2.4 
mg group. The ETD (semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo) for mean increases in pulse from baseline to week 68 
ranged from 1−4 bpm. The pulse increases were comparable to what has been reported with semaglutide 
s.c. for T2D (2−5 bpm for semaglutide 1.0 mg vs placebo) and with oral semaglutide for T2D (3−4 bpm for 
semaglutide 14 mg vs placebo). A total of 26.0% of subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group had an 
increase (from baseline) in pulse of ≥20 beats/min at one or more timepoints during the on-treatment period 
compared to 15.6% in the placebo group.

There was no treatment difference in the reporting of AEs within the HLGT Cardiac arrhythmias (sema 2.4 
mg: 2.3%, 2.1 events per 100 PYE, placebo: 2.0%, 1.9 events per 100 PYE) in the phase 3a pool.  
A cardiovascular outcome trial with semaglutide 2.4 mg is ongoing. In patients with diabetes, positive effects 
of lower dose semaglutide on cardiovascular events have been demonstrated (SUSTAIN 6). 
Neoplasms 
The proportion of subjects reporting AEs of overall neoplasms (benign and malignant) were comparable 
between semaglutide 2.4 mg (6.9%) and placebo (7.1%). AEs of breast, skin and colorectal neoplasms 
(benign and malignant) were all reported by a comparable proportion of subjects for semaglutide 2.4 mg and 
placebo. 
Few AEs of malignant neoplasms were reported in the phase 3a pool and by a similar proportion of subjects 
for semaglutide 2.4 mg (1.1%) and placebo (1.1%). There were no apparent imbalances between 
semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo in the types of malignant neoplasms reported.  
No events of pancreatic cancer or medullary thyroid carcinoma were reported.  
Liver function 
There was a balanced reporting of AEs between semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo and the evaluation of 
biochemical markers of liver function overall and in individuals with outlier values. There were no cases of 
Hy’s law in the semaglutide 2.4 mg for the weight management programme. At the end of treatment, mean 
ALT levels (decreases of 26% vs 13%) and AST (decreases of 12% vs 4%) decreased to a greater extent 
with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo. The improvement in ASAT and ALAT saw in this population is 
likely related to the semaglutide-induced weight loss.  
Renal failure 
AEs of acute renal failure in the phase 3a pool were reported by comparable proportions of subjects and rate 
of events with semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo.  
Comparable to what has been observed with semaglutide s.c. for T2D and oral semaglutide for T2D, ratio to 
baseline levels for the renal function parameters eGFR and creatinine (phase 3a dose-escalation group) were 
comparable with semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo at the end of treatment (week 68). Improvements were 
seen for UACR (assessed in the phase 3a with T2D trial [STEP 2]) that decreased by 24% with semaglutide 
2.4 mg and increased by 17% with placebo.  
Hypoglycaemia 
In the phase 3a without T2D group, the proportion of subjects with AEs of hypoglycaemia was low and 
comparable with semaglutide 2.4 mg (0.6%) and placebo (0.7%).  
In subjects with T2D, the proportion of subjects with level 2 episodes of hypoglycaemia (6.2% vs 2.5%) and 
the rate of episodes (10.7 vs 3.2 episodes per 100 PYE) was higher with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to 
placebo. The majority of the episodes occurred when semaglutide 2.4 mg was used in combination with SU, 
which is in line with what is seen with semaglutide s.c. for T2D and oral semaglutide for T2D. However, many 
patients with hypoglycaemia were not using SU. In addition, there was one severe hypoglycaemic episode 
with semaglutide. This occurred in a patient without SU treatment. The fact that semaglutide may cause 
(severe) hypoglycaemia in patients without SU is now clearly stated in the SmPC.  
Retinopathy 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 155/177 
 
 
 
Retinal disorders were included as a safety focus area for the STEP 2 trial (diabetes patients) in the 
semaglutide 2.4 mg for the weight management programme. In STEP 2, subjects with uncontrolled and 
potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy were not eligible for enrolment in the trial. A total of 
85 AEs of retinal disorders were identified by the pre-defined MedDRA search. These events were reported by 
a larger proportion of subjects with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 2.4 mg compared to placebo (6.2%, 6.9% and 
4.2%, respectively). One subject discontinued treatment with trial product permanently and one subject had 
a dose reduction of the trial product; both subjects were treated with semaglutide 1.0 mg. There appears to 
be a dose-response for events of new onset or worsening of diabetic retinopathy at higher doses (observed in 
19 subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to 12 subjects with semaglutide 1.0 mg), despite similar 
initial glucose-lowering effects.   
The semaglutide s.c. for T2D CVOT (SUSTAIN 6) also showed a higher risk of retinopathy with semaglutide 
s.c. compared to placebo (50 subjects (3.0%) vs 29 subjects (1.8%); and a HR of 1.76 [1.11; 2.78]95% CI 
for time to first event). The increased risk was primarily seen in pre-disposed patients with pre
existing 
diabetic retinopathy and poor glycaemic control at baseline and who were being treated with insulins at 
‐
baseline. In SUSTAIN 6, it has been suggested that the events that occurred with semaglutide and placebo 
represent an early worsening in connection to intensified treatment. However, in SUSTAIN 6, compared to 
placebo, the incidence of retinopathy events continued to increase up to 2 years after initiation of treatment 
(longer than that observed in insulin studies with large decreases in HbA1c). In addition, in the CVOT in 
patients with pre-existent retinopathy, an increased risk with semaglutide compared to placebo was not only 
seen in patients with large decreases in HbA1c, but also in patients with HbA1c reductions <0.5%. 
Importantly, in STEP 2, the increased risk of retinopathy with semaglutide was not associated with larger 
decreases in HbA1c and cannot be interpreted as early worsening. To evaluate this issue, a dedicated 
randomised clinical trial with semaglutide s.c. (NN9535 4352, FOCUS) is currently being conducted to assess 
the long-term effects of treatment with semaglutide 1.0 mg on diabetic retinopathy development and 
progression when added to standard of care in subjects with T2D. Incorporation of a new dose arm into the 
FOCUS trial is not feasible.  
Novo Nordisk has found limited protein and mRNA expression of GLP-1 receptors in normal human eyes with 
expression being confined to single neurons in the ganglion cell layer. No GLP-1 receptor expression was 
detected in eyes of individuals with advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy including in areas characterised 
by neovascularisation. Although a, direct effect cannot be excluded, these data offer some level of 
reassurance.  
Additional reassurance comes from SUSTAIN FORTE. In this study identical proportions of subjects with AEs 
within ‘Diabetic retinopathy’ were seen in each semaglutide dose group (sema 1.0 mg: 7/480 subjects, 
1.5%; sema 2.0 mg: 7/479 subjects, 1.5%).  
In further considering that data from Sustain 6 indicated increased risk of EAC-confirmed diabetic retinopathy 
complications only in patients with pre-existent DRP, the Applicant’s position not to add retinopathy in 
patients without diabetes as a potential risk in the RMP is accepted (from the Ozempic EPAR: “Among 
patients without pre-existing diabetic retinopathy, events of EAC-confirmed diabetic retinopathy 
complications were few and there was no imbalance in events of diabetic retinopathy complications between 
patients treated with semaglutide as compared with placebo (5 vs 4 events). Supporting a lack of effect in 
those patients without baseline retinopathy, no difference was observed in patients with a baseline 
fundoscopy evaluated to be normal.”). 
Considering that an exclusion criterion was added in STEP 2 regarding uncontrolled and potentially unstable 
diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy and that subjects with pre-existent diabetic retinopathy were identified 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 156/177 
 
 
 
in the SUSTAIN 6 CVOT as being at highest risk, this population may be very vulnerable. The company 
provided data on the effects of semaglutide on DRP and MACE in patients with "uncontrolled or potentially 
unstable diabetic retinopathy" in SUSTAIN 6 (semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg in patients with diabetes). The 
estimated HRs in the ‘uncontrolled or potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy’ subpopulation in SUSTAIN 6 
are consistent with those in the overall population. However, the absolute effects are of a different 
magnitude. In the ‘uncontrolled or potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy’ subpopulation for every 100 
patients that were treated, semaglutide prevented 3 MACE events, but caused 6 events of serious DRP. 
The Applicant has updated SmPC section 4.4, stating that there is no experience with semaglutide 2.4 mg in 
patients with type 2 diabetes with uncontrolled or potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy, and that 
semaglutide 2.4 mg is not recommended in these patients. Further, the imbalance in diabetic retinopathy 
complications between semaglutide arms of the STEP 2 trial should is reflected in SmPC section 4.8. 
Infections 
It would appear that the use of semaglutide 2.4 mg in combination with low-calorie diet and exercise (STEP 
3) is associated with an increased risk of severe and serious infections. However, there was only a small 
number of subjects for whom severe infections were reported with no clustering of events over time in the 
trial. Overall, these data do not permit firm conclusions 
Psychiatric disorders 
During the on-treatment period, AEs of psychiatric disorders were reported at a comparable frequency and 
rate with semaglutide 2.4 mg (9.3% of subjects, 10.0 events per 100 PYE) and placebo (10.7% of subjects, 
12.1 events per 100 PYE) in the phase 3a pool  
Laboratory values 
Overall, no noteworthy changes to haematology or biochemistry parameters (not part of a safety focus area) 
were observed; this is in line with previous experience from semaglutide s.c. for T2D and oral semaglutide for 
T2D.  
Blood pressure 
In the phase 3a dose-escalation group, SBP and DBP decreased from baseline to end of treatment with both 
semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo but more with semaglutide 2.4 mg (-6 mmHg and 3 mmHg) than with 
placebo (1 mmHg for both).  
Allergic reactions and injection site reaction 
In the phase 3a pool, the proportion of subjects reporting AEs of allergic reaction were comparable with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg (6.9%) and placebo (6.8%). 
In the phase 3a pool, the proportion of subjects reporting AEs of injection site reaction were comparable with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg (4.2%) and placebo (4.9%). 
Subgroup analyses 
Gender, age and renal function 
There were no consistent differences between males and females in gastrointestinal AEs Gastrointestinal AEs, 
the most commonly observed AEs with GLP-1 RAs, were reported more often by subjects with age 65 to <75 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 157/177 
 
 
 
 
years and subjects with moderate renal impairment at baseline (based on a very low number of subjects in 
this subgroup). Results for the age group ≥75 years should be interpreted with caution. In this age group 
only 23 subjects treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 13 subjects treated with placebo. Based on the 
apparent lack of impact of baseline age on exposure in STEP 1 and 2, it appears unlikely that the more 
pronounced treatment difference in proportion of subjects with gastrointestinal AEs with increasing age 
(partly driven by differences within the placebo group) should be due to a difference in exposure across 
subgroups by age. However, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be excluded. The revised 
text in the SmPC (SmPC, Section 4.2 ‘Posology’) allows for delayed dose escalation or lowering to the 
previous dose until symptoms have improved, which is considered sufficient to mitigate the risk for females 
and elderly people. Nevertheless, the revised SmPC now also states that greater sensitivity of some older 
individuals cannot be excluded. 
Considering the low number of patients with moderate renal impairment, semaglutide should be used with 
care in these individuals. This was added to the text of the SmPC. 
Weight loss 
The safety profile of subjects within the semaglutide 2.4 mg group who lost 20% or more of their body 
weight compared to those who did not differed for several AE types. The AE types more frequently reported 
among subjects with a large weight loss were gastrointestinal, decreased appetite, Alopecia, Dizziness, 
Headache and Cholelithiasis. Changes in the dose are not necessary with subsequent weight loss. First, within 
the range of exposures observed for the 2.4 mg dose level (e.g. 90% range of model-derived Cavg in STEP 1 
was 51−110 nmol/L), a 18% difference in exposures (as a consequence of weight loss) was considered to be 
of negligible clinical relevance. Second, the revised text in the posology section of the SmPC allows for 
delayed dose escalation or lowering to the previous dose until symptoms have improved, which should be 
sufficient for any patient irrespective of their speed and size of weight loss. Third, SAEs and severe AEs were 
reported by similar proportions and AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of trial product by a lower 
proportion of subjects with a weight loss ≥20% vs <20%. 
Race and region 
The treatment differences in the proportion of subjects reporting of AEs within the Gastrointestinal disorders 
SOC varied across regions. For example, treatment differences in the proportion of subjects reporting of AEs 
within the Gastrointestinal disorders were only 2% points in Africa, 24% points in Europe and 44% points in 
Asia (excl east Asia). These differences are very remarkable. A clear explanation for the regional differences 
in reporting of gastrointestinal AEs is lacking. There may be cultural differences in how gastrointestinal AEs 
are perceived and reported across regions. 
Antibodies 
In STEP 1 and STEP 2, the proportion of subjects that tested positive for anti-semaglutide antibodies at any 
time point post-baseline was low (50 subjects, 2.9% of subjects randomised to semaglutide 2.4 mg). The 
company concluded that the formation of antibodies did not influence the efficacy and the occurrence of 
adverse events. For efficacy, the mean body weight %-changes from baseline for STEP 1 and STEP 2 were 
approximately 2%-points lower for subjects with antibodies, compared to subjects without antibodies. 
However, we agree with the company that the low number of subjects with antibodies compared to the 
subjects without antibodies precludes statistical interpretation (STEP 1: 39 vs 1267 subjects, STEP 2: 12 vs 
391 subjects). The 2%-points difference in efficacy may be a chance finding. This may also be true for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 158/177 
 
 
 
  
safety parameters Allergic reactions and Injection site reaction. The difference between subjects with 
antibodies compared to subjects without antibodies is driven by few subjects with antibodies (8 subjects with 
Allergic reactions and 3 subjects with Injection site reactions), hence a causal relationship cannot be 
concluded. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety  
In general, the safety profile of semaglutide subcutaneous (s.c.) 2.4 mg once weekly for weight management 
appears similar to that of other GLP-1 receptor agonists. However, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse 
events appears larger than in previous studies with GLP-1 RA’s. In addition, several new adverse events were 
identified (hair loss, dizziness, headache, hypotension, orthostatic hypotension) and reported in the SmPC. In 
contrast to previous studies, gastrointestinal adverse events only slightly decreased over time. Also, in 
contrast to previous studies, semaglutide caused hypoglycaemia in patients with diabetes without SU. 
Moreover, “uncontrolled or potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy” was added as a warning to the SmPC.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context  
3.1.1.  Disease or condition  
In this application, data collected by Novo Nordisk (sponsor, applicant) are presented to support the use of 
semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once weekly (hereafter referred to as semaglutide 2.4 mg) as an adjunct to a 
reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management, including weight loss and weight 
maintenance, in adults with an initial body mass index (BMI) of 
•  ≥30 kg/m2 (obesity), or 
•  ≥27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2 (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbidity. 
The prevalence of obesity has reached epidemic proportions and continues to increase. Obesity is associated 
with several health-related complications. Most concerning, obesity increases the risk of developing 
cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancers, which are some of the leading causes of early death in 
these patients. In addition, obesity is a well-established risk factor for other serious conditions including, but 
not limited to, T2D, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, osteoarthritis, urinary 
incontinence, asthma and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Obesity also significantly impacts health-related 
quality of life by impairing physical health status and imposing limitations on daily activities. Furthermore, 
stigmatization and discrimination associated with obesity can contribute to impaired mental well-being. The 
risk of obesity-related complications and comorbidities increases with increasing BMI, and a weight loss of 
5−10% has significant health benefits by improving obesity-related comorbidities, including slowing 
progression to T2D, and improving physical symptoms and quality of life. Studies suggest a beneficial impact 
of weight loss on cardiovascular risk and mortality in people with obesity, with or without T2D.

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need  
Lifestyle intervention in diet and exercise is first-line treatment for obesity, but most people with obesity 
struggle to achieve and maintain their weight loss, most likely due largely to a homeostatic mechanism 
involving counteractive biological responses. Bariatric surgery offers an effective alternative for some people 
with severe obesity, but surgery carries a risk connected with the procedure and for complications afterwards 
and requires close follow-up, which can be cumbersome and costly. For people with obesity, there is a lack of 
safe and efficacious treatment options that can provide a reduction in body weight approaching what can be 
obtained by surgical procedures, and at the same time enables the patient to maintain the weight loss. 
Pharmacotherapy may serve as a valuable alternative to bariatric surgery as a supplement to lifestyle 
intervention to achieve and sustain a clinically relevant weight loss. Currently, only a very limited number of 
pharmacological options are approved for weight management.  
Collectively, the Applicant describes an unmet medical need for a convenient, efficacious and safe weight 
lowering drug with beneficial effects on obesity-related comorbidities. The GLP-1 RA drug class is associated 
with multiple benefits; they have a well-documented safety profile, reduce body weight, improve blood 
pressure, lipid profile and other cardiovascular risk factors, and glucose metabolism. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies  
The efficacy and safety of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once weekly for weight management as an adjunct to a 
reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity (STEP 1, 2 and 4) or intensive behavioural therapy (IBT) 
(STEP 3) were studied in four phase 3a 68-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials which 
included a total of 2652 subjects randomised to semaglutide 2.4 mg and 1530 randomised to placebo. 
The four phase 3a trials (STEP 1–4) all included subjects with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) or overweight (BMI 
≥27 to <30 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related comorbidity. STEP 2 included subjects with overweight or 
obesity (BMI ≥27 kg/m2) and T2D (HbA1c 7–10%). In STEP 1, 2 and 4, standard lifestyle intervention 
according to clinical guidelines was included. STEP 3 evaluated semaglutide 2.4 mg when combined with IBT. 
All four trials had a treatment duration of 68 weeks with an additional 7 weeks of follow-up off treatment. In 
STEP 1–3, the 68 weeks of treatment included 16 weeks of dose escalation to semaglutide 2.4 mg and 52 
weeks on maintenance dose. The semaglutide 1.0 mg treatment arm in STEP 2 included 8 weeks of dose 
escalation and 60 weeks on 1.0 mg. STEP 4 evaluated the effects of stopping or continuing treatment with 
semaglutide after reaching the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg (at 20 weeks). 
The primary endpoint in all four STEP trials was the change from baseline to 68 weeks in body weight (%), 
and in STEP 1-3 the proportion of subjects who achieve at week 68 ≥ 5% body weight loss. 
3.2.  Favourable effects  
Body weight related outcomes  
In the four STEP trials, treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo resulted in consistent and statistically 
significant weight loss. In STEP 1, treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg resulted in a body weight change of -
15 % with an ETD vs placebo of -12.4% (95% CI -13.4 to -11.5). A comparable effect was observed in STEP 
3 (ETD -10.3%, 95% CI -12 to -8.6). The effect was less pronounced in T2D patients in STEP 2 (ETD -6.2%, 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 163/177 
 
 
 
95% CI -7.3 to -5.2). This was accompanied by a larger decrease in waist circumference (confirmatory 
secondary endpoint) with semaglutide vs placebo in all four STEP trials. 
Also the proportion of subjects achieving ≥5% body weight change (co-primary endpoint in STEP 1-3) was 
significantly larger with semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment (semaglutide vs. placebo STEP 1 83.5% vs 31.1%; 
STEP 2 67.4% vs 30.2%; STEP 3 86.6% vs 47.6%). In addition, the proportion of patients achieving a weight 
loss of ≥10% (confirmatory secondary endpoint in STEP 1-3) was larger with semaglutide 2.4 mg 
(semaglutide vs placebo: STEP 1, 66.1% vs 12.0%; STEP 2 44.5% vs 10.2%; STEP 3 75.3% vs 27.0%,  
In STEP 4, weight maintenance was investigated. After the run-in period of 20 weeks with semaglutide 
treatment, weight loss continued in the patients continuing semaglutide (point estimate -7.9%), while in 
patients switching to placebo, this resulted in mean weight gain (point estimate +6.9%, semaglutide vs 
placebo ETD -14.8%, 95% CI -16.00 to -13.50) 
The subgroup analyses showed a larger effect on weight loss of semaglutide 2.4 mg in female subjects 
compared with male subjects (STEP 1 body weight change (%) female subjects ETD -14.0, 95% CI -15.1 to -
12.9, male subjects ETD -8.0, 95% CI -9.8 to -6.3).  
The effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg on weight loss was also larger in subjects with a baseline weight < 90 kg 
compared with subjects with a baseline weight > 115kg (STEP 1 body weight change (%) baseline weight < 
90 kg group ETD -14.0, 95% CI -15.8 to -12.1, baseline weight > 115 kg group ETD -9.6, 95% CI -11.3 to -
7.9).  
Glycaemic parameters  
STEP 2 shows an improvement in HbA1c (confirmatory secondary endpoint) in T2D patients using 
semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo at 68 weeks, with an ETD of HbA1c (%) -1.23% (95% CI -1.42 to -1.05). In 
the exploratory analyses, the proportion of patients that reached the target of HbA1c <7% was larger in the 
semaglutide group (78.5%) vs placebo (26.5%). The patients that started insulin differed between the 
treatment groups (2 subjects (0.5%) in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group compared to 18 subjects (4.5%) in 
the placebo group). Also the proportion of patients that decreased OAD (semaglutide 2.4 mg 27.1% 
compared to placebo 6.8%) or increased OAD (semaglutide 2.4 mg 4.6% compared to placebo 23.0%).  
The analyses in the patients without diabetes (i.e. STEP 1 and 3) on glycaemic control were exploratory and 
resulted in a larger HbA1c reduction with semaglutide vs placebo at 68 weeks (STEP 1 ETD -0.29%, 95% CI -
0.32 to -0.26; STEP 3 ETD -0.24%, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.19).  
Effect on cardiovascular parameters  
Treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg also resulted in decreased SBP (confirmatory secondary endpoint) in 
STEP 1-3 (STEP 1 ETD -5.1 mmHg, 95% CI -6.3 to -3.9, STEP 2 ETD -3.4 mmHg, 95% CI -5.6 to -1.3, STEP 
3 ETD -3.9, 95% CI -6.4 to -1.5). Also, the effect on lipids was found across the trials, except on an effect on 
LDL in the STEP 2 trial. 
Patient-reported outcomes  
The PRO’s of the SF-36 PF and IWQOL-Lite-CT PF score were analysed as confirmatory secondary endpoints. 
The effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo on both PRO’s was more and statistically significant in STEP 1 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 164/177 
 
 
 
(SF-36 PF ETD 1.80, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.42; IWQOL-Lite-CT PF ETD 9.43, 95% CI 7.50 to 11.35) and STEP 2 
(SF-36 PF ETD 1.52, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.61; IWQOL-Lite-CT PF ETD 4.83, 95% CI 1.79 to 7.86). A larger 
proportions of subjects achieving clinically relevant improvements in physical functioning were seen for both 
PRO’s in STEP 1 and 2 (supportive secondary endpoint). 
Body composition  
In STEP 1 a sub-study that included DEXA scans were conducted. The study showed a statistically significant 
reduction in total fat mass of -7.0 kg (95% CI: -9.8; -4.2) and in visceral fat mass of -0.3 kg (95% CI: -0.4; 
-0.1). Lean body weight also decreased more with semaglutide than with placebo, but relative to total body 
weight, lean body weight increased. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects  
Stopping rule  
To evaluate the application of a ‘stopping rule’, as described in the Guideline (Guideline on clinical evaluation 
of medicinal products used in weight management (2016 EMA/CHMP/311805/2014)), the Applicant provided 
analyses for the predictive value of non-responders (responders defined as at least 5% body weight loss at 
20 weeks of treatment) with semaglutide 2.4% on clinically relevant weight loss (>5%). In STEP 4, the 
majority of subjects (719 of 803 subjects, 89.5%) had achieved a weight loss ≥5% at week 20. 
Approximately half of the subjects who were at week 20 (5%) non-responders with semaglutide still achieved 
a ≥5% weight reduction after a further 48 weeks of treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg (estimated 
percentage of week 68 [5%] responders: 51.95%), while only few of the week 20 (5%) non-responders who 
switched to placebo at week 20 became week 68 (5%) responders (estimated percentage: 11.36%). It is 
considered acceptable not to include a stopping rule in the SmPC. Using a stopping rule at week 28 will 
exclude patients from relevant treatment, as among early non-responders the proportion of patients 
achieving a weight loss at week 68 was substantial (40.5% and 31.9%). However, even without a stopping 
rule, regular evaluation concerning treatment discontinuation is needed and this is considered to fall within 
the regular clinical practice. 
Sex  
The percentage of female subjects vs male subjects was larger in all four STEP trials. The effect on weight 
was larger in female subjects in the subgroup analyses, and therefore the inclusion of relatively more females 
could lead to an overestimation of the effect of semaglutide on weight loss in general.  Additional analyses 
showed that the weight loss increased in an exposure-dependent manner for both males and females. Within 
both STEP 1 and 2 trials, the weight loss at a given exposure level appears larger in females than males. 
These analyses suggested that exposure differences cannot explain all differences between genders and that 
a difference in baseline weight between male and female subjects does not explain the treatment difference.  
Effect of baseline weight  
It is considered plausible that the effect on weight loss may be baseline weight dependent. Additional 
analyses on the change in body weight (% and kg) based on baseline body weight were performed and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 165/177 
 
 
 
subgroup analyses showed a lower ETD for weight loss in % in patients with a baseline weight > 115 kg vs. 
patients with a baseline weight < 90 kg (body weight change (%) STEP 1 baseline weight > 115 kg group 
ETD -9.6, 95% CI -11.3 to -7.9, baseline weight < 90 kg group ETD -14.0, 95% CI -15.8 to -12.1). Although 
the dosage of semaglutide 2.4 mg appears suitable in general, it could be anticipated that there will be an 
overall lower % body weight change in patients with an initial high body weight vs low body weight, who 
initiates treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg. efficacy. But the achieved weight loss in patients with a weight 
> 115kg is considered clinically relevant. 
Effect of diabetes  
The effects of semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo in patients with T2D (STEP 2) were less pronounced compared 
to the effect in patients without T2D (STEP 1 and 3), but remained statistically significant (STEP 2, body 
weight change (%) semaglutide vs placebo ETD -6.2%, 95% CI -7.3% to -5.2%). This could be expected 
based on previous results in patients with T2D and treatment with GLP-1 analogues (liraglutide 3.0 mg, 
SCALE trial), but it has not been explicitly addressed in the SmPC. Also, the effects on waist circumference 
and SBP were less pronounced in T2D patients. In the STEP 2 trial, T2D patients using insulin at baseline 
were excluded. However, Ozempic (semaglutide 1.0 mg) for the treatment of diabetes is registered also 
combined with insulin treatment. In the SUSTAIN trials, semaglutide 1.0 mg has been evaluated in T2D 
patients without insulin (SUSTAIN 1, trial 3623) and as add-on in patients already using insulin (SUSTAIN 5, 
trial 3627) and the effect on weight of semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. placebo in these trials appears similar (weight 
change (kg); SUSTAIN 1, semaglutide 1.0 mg -4.53 kg, placebo -0.98, ETD -3.56, 95% CI -4.74 to -2.38; 
SUSTAIN 5 (add-on baseline insulin use) semaglutide 1.0 mg -6.42 kg, placebo -1.36, ETD -5.06, 95% CI -
6.08 to -4.04). Although there is no data in T2D patients using insulin and using add-on semaglutide 2.4 mg, 
it is considered plausible, based on the data with semaglutide 1.0 mg, that these patients also benefit from 
treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg.  
Longer term effects  
The results of the STEP 4 trial suggest that continuous treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg is needed to 
maintain the achieved weight loss after 68 weeks. However, no additional weight loss is expected after this 
period, and it remains uncertain if, after a longer period of treatment, weight gain may occur. An ongoing 
study (STEP 5, trial 4378) will evaluate the effect after 2 years of treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg.  
Cardiovascular effects  
A beneficial effect accompanied the effect on weight loss on waist circumference and SBP. There were, 
however, some discrepancies with regards to the lipid profile. In subjects with type 2 diabetes, the effect was 
smaller compared to subjects without T2D and there was no effect on LDL cholesterol in subjects with T2D. 
This could partly be explained by a large number of subjects using lipid lowering medication in the STEP 2 
trial, i.e. 60%, as could be expected from a population with T2D. This may hamper an additional measurable 
effect on LDL by semaglutide. In the STEP 3 study and STEP 4 study, there was no effect on HDL cholesterol. 
Although heterogeneity was observed in the results on serum lipids, there appears to be positive effect on 
serum lipids in general. But the interpretation of the data should be done with caution as these were 
supportive endpoints. A cardiovascular benefit has not yet been shown for the treatment with semaglutide 
2.4 mg, but will be evaluated in an ongoing study (SELECT, trial 4388) (see below). 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 166/177 
 
 
 
Patient reported outcomes  
The effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg vs. placebo on both PRO’s (i.e. SF-36 PF and IWQOL-Lite-CT PF) was more 
and statistically significant in STEP 1 and STEP 2. The ETD difference (STEP 1 ETD 1.80, STEP 2 ETD 1.52) 
did, however, not reach the primary responder threshold (SF-36 PF 3.7 points, IWQOL-Lite-CT PF 14.6 
points) for clinically meaningful change on individual level. These results support a consistent and statistically 
significant effect, but the clinical relevance is not demonstrated based on these results.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects  
A total of 3052 subjects were exposed to semaglutide (2650 to semaglutide 2.4 mg and 402 to semaglutide 
1.0 mg) and 1529 to placebo during the randomised periods of STEP 1‒4. This is considered sufficient to 
evaluate the safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg in the target population. 
Adverse events 
The proportions of subjects with AEs (88.5 vs 83.6%), SAEs (9.3 vs 6.4%) and severe AEs (9.9 vs 6.9%) 
were larger with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo in the phase 3a pool. A larger proportion of 
subjects with AEs led to permanent treatment discontinuation with semaglutide 2.4 mg (5.7 vs 3.0%): this 
was driven by gastrointestinal AEs. The time to first event was shorter with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with 
placebo, with approximately 50% of subjects reporting their first event during the first 5 weeks.  
Deaths, serious adverse events and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation 
A total of 8 deaths were reported in the semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight management programme: 6 deaths 
were exposed to semaglutide and 2 to placebo. The proportion of subjects with AEs with fatal outcome was 
low and comparable with semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo (0.1% vs 0.2% of subjects) in the phase 3a pool.  
The proportion of subjects with SAEs was larger with semaglutide 2.4 mg (9.3%) compared to placebo 
(6.4%) in the phase 3a pool; this was driven mainly by gallbladder-related disorders and gastrointestinal 
AEs. The proportion of subjects with SAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was comparable 
with semaglutide 2.4 mg (1.0%) and placebo (0.8%). In the phase 3a pool, the proportion of subjects with 
AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation were higher with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo 
(5.7% vs 3.0%), driven by gastrointestinal disorders. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Gastrointestinal AE’s 
Gastrointestinal AEs were the most commonly reported events and were reported more frequently with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo (72.9 vs 47.1%). The majority of events were mild or moderate in 
severity and had onset during the dose-escalation period.  
The following PTs were reported by ≥5% of subjects and more often with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to 
placebo: Nausea (38.3% vs 14.0%), Diarrhoea (26.8% vs 14.3%), Constipation (21.8% vs 10.2%), Vomiting 
(21.8% vs 5.7%), Abdominal pain (8.4% vs 4.0%), Dyspepsia (7.6% vs 2.7%), Abdominal pain upper (7.1% 
vs 3.6%), Eructation (6.5% vs 0.4%), Abdominal distension (6.3% vs 4.3%) and Flatulence (5.3% vs 3.7%).  
The PT Decreased appetite belonging to the SOC Metabolism and nutrition disorders was reported by ≥5% of 
subjects, and these events occurred more often with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo (7.8% vs 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 167/177 
 
 
 
2.8%). This is not unexpected. Decreased appetite may be related to the gastrointestinal side effects and/or 
it may also play a role in the weight losing effects of semaglutide.  
Gall bladder related disorders 
During the on-treatment period in the phase 3a pool, AEs of gallbladder-related disorders were reported by a 
higher proportion of subjects and with a higher event rate with semaglutide 2.4 mg (2.5%, 2.4 events per 
100 PYE) than with placebo (1.6%, 1.5 events per 100 PYE). There were more events of gallbladder-related 
disorders with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo in the phase 3a pool driven by events of 
Cholelithiasis (1.6% vs 1.1%).  
Neoplasms 
The proportion of subjects reporting AEs of overall neoplasms (benign and malignant) were comparable 
between semaglutide 2.4 mg (6.9%) and placebo (7.1%). AEs of breast, skin and colorectal neoplasms 
(benign and malignant) were all reported by a comparable proportion of subjects for semaglutide 2.4 mg and 
placebo. 
Few AEs of malignant neoplasms were reported in the phase 3a pool, and by a similar proportion of subjects 
for semaglutide 2.4 mg (1.1%) and placebo (1.1%). There were no apparent imbalances between 
semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo in the types of malignant neoplasms reported.  
No events of pancreatic cancer or medullary thyroid carcinoma were reported.  
Liver function 
There was a balanced reporting of AEs between semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo and the evaluation of 
biochemical markers of liver function overall and in individuals with outlier values. There were no cases of 
Hy’s law in the semaglutide 2.4 mg for the weight management programme. At the end of treatment, mean 
levels of ALT (decreases of 26% vs 13%) and AST (decreases of 12% vs 4%) decreased to a greater extent 
with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo. The improvement in ASAT and ALAT saw in this population is 
likely related to the semaglutide-induced weight loss.  
Renal failure 
AEs of acute renal failure in the phase 3a pool were reported by comparable proportions of subjects and rate 
of events with semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo.  
Comparable to what has been observed with semaglutide s.c. for T2D and oral semaglutide for T2D, ratio to 
baseline levels for the renal function parameters eGFR and creatinine (phase 3a dose-escalation group) were 
comparable with semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo at the end of treatment (week 68). Improvements were 
seen for UACR (assessed in the phase 3a with T2D trial [STEP 2]) that decreased by 24% with semaglutide 
2.4 mg and increased by 17% with placebo.  
Psychiatric disorders 
During the on-treatment period, AEs of psychiatric disorders were reported at a comparable frequency and 
rate with semaglutide 2.4 mg (9.3% of subjects, 10.0 events per 100 PYE) and placebo (10.7% of subjects, 
12.1 events per 100 PYE) in the phase 3a pool.  
Laboratory values 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 168/177 
 
 
 
Overall, no noteworthy changes to haematology or biochemistry parameters (not part of a safety focus area) 
were observed; this is in line with previous experience from semaglutide s.c. for T2D and oral semaglutide for 
T2D.  
Blood pressure 
In the phase 3a dose-escalation group, SBP and DBP decreased from baseline to end of treatment with both 
semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo but more with semaglutide 2.4 mg (-6 mmHg and 3 mmHg) than with 
placebo (1 mmHg for both).  
Allergic reactions and injection site reaction 
In the phase 3a pool, the proportion of subjects reporting AEs of allergic reaction were comparable with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg (6.9%) and placebo (6.8%). 
In the phase 3a pool, the proportion of subjects reporting AEs of injection site reaction were comparable with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg (4.2%) and placebo (4.9%). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects  
In the phase 3a pool, there were more female subjects than male subjects (71.6% vs 29.4%); most subjects 
were White (73.8%) and of non-Hispanic/non-Latino ethnicity (86.3%), and they had a mean age of 48 
years, a mean body weight of 102.6 kg and had a mean BMI of 36.8 kg/m2. The number of black and Asian 
individuals may be too small to establish a robust benefit-risk ratio.  
Gastrointestinal events compared to other GLP-1 RA studies  
The types of gastrointestinal adverse events are well-known for semaglutide and for the GLP-1 RA class in 
general, but the incidence of these adverse events appears larger than those with low dose GLP-RA in 
patients with diabetes. However, the same pattern was seen when comparing the placebo groups. In 
addition, the rate of gastrointestinal disorders with semaglutide 2.4 mg was around 8% higher (246.3 vs. 
227.9 events per 100 patient-years of exposure) compared to Saxenda. This increase may be relevant for 
patients, but the text of the SPC now allows for delayed dose escalation or lowering to the previous dose until 
symptoms have improved.  
Timing of gastrointestinal adverse events 
With semaglutide, the prevalence of gastrointestinal AEs increased during the initial 20 weeks of treatment, 
where it peaked with approximately 38% of subjects having at least one gastrointestinal AE on a given day. 
The prevalence of gastrointestinal AEs was stable during the study at approximately 11% in the placebo 
group. The prevalences of Nausea, Diarrhoea, Vomiting and Constipation increased during dose escalation 
and after that, the prevalence of Nausea, Diarrhoea and Vomiting gradually decreased over time.  
The prevalences of Nausea, Diarrhoea, Vomiting and Constipation increased during dose escalation and after 
that the prevalence of Nausea, Diarrhoea and Vomiting gradually decreased over time. However, the 
prevalence of nausea was still much higher with semaglutide compared to placebo after 68 weeks 
(approximately 10 vs 1%). This is in contrast to nausea in previous studies with GLP-1 RA. The higher 
prevalence of nausea in the current studies compared to previous studies may be explained by differences in 
design. In contrast to the previous studies, subjects were allowed to proceed with trial product after 
temporary treatment discontinuations or dose reductions in the current studies. Nausea only led to 
permanent discontinuation of trial product in only 1.8% of subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 169/177 
 
 
 
Haemorrhoids  
Haemorrhoids were also more reported with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo (2.1% vs 0.4%). Obesity 
and constipation are well-known risk factors for the development of haemorrhoids. The majority of events of 
haemorrhoids was co-reported with constipation or appeared to be related to constipation, which is a very 
common adverse reaction that is already addressed in the SmPC. 
Nervous system disorders 
A larger proportion of subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo reported events within the SOC 
Nervous system disorders. This difference was driven by the PTs Headache (12.8% vs 8.7%) and Dizziness 
(6.8% vs 3.3%) that were reported for more than 5% of subjects. The frequency of reporting of Headache 
and Dizziness with semaglutide 2.4 mg was similar to that of liraglutide 3.0 mg in Saxenda for weight loss, 
but higher than with the highest doses within the T2D programmes. A possible explanation for this difference 
between the weight management programmes and the T2D programmes appear to be the differences in 
indication and population characteristics and in the weight loss obtained. However, other explanations may 
also be possible. Nevertheless, headache is already reported as a very common adverse event in the SPC. 
Narratives for the 5 SAEs of Vertigo reported by subjects randomised to semaglutide 2.4 mg in the STEP 
trials have been provided. Overall, the SAEs of Vertigo were reported as resolved without any changes to trial 
product.  
Fatigue 
General disorders and administration site conditions showed a small difference with more AEs in subjects 
treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg than placebo; this difference was mainly driven by fatigue: the proportion of 
subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo was 10.6% vs 5.1% in the phase 3a dose-escalation group. The 
effect of semaglutide on fatigue also appears larger than that with high dose liraglutide for weight loss. The 
company hypothesizes that the increased proportion of patients with fatigue may be a secondary effect on 
the gastrointestinal events experienced more often in subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to 
placebo. Indeed, subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group who reported Fatigue also reported more 
gastrointestinal AEs than subjects in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group who did not report Fatigue. 
Alopecia 
A higher proportion of subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg than placebo in the phase 3a pool (3.3% vs 1.4%) 
reported AEs for the PT Alopecia that belong to the SOC Skin subcutaneous tissue disorders. There were 3 
events with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 1 event with placebo leading to permanent treatment discontinuation. 
Although alopecia is not reported for other GLP-1 RAs, hair loss in relation to weight loss has been reported in 
other studies and is described in labels for other weight management drugs. The events of Alopecia reported 
with semaglutide 2.4 mg are most likely a result of weight loss. Subjects obtaining a weight loss of ≥20% 
with semaglutide 2.4 mg reported events of Alopecia more often than subjects with a weight loss <20% 
Furthermore, when comparing the time of onset of individual events of Alopecia and weight loss (%) at the 
time of onset, most subjects reporting events of Alopecia had a larger than average weight loss regardless of 
treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo.  
Alopecia is already reported in the SPC as a common adverse event. 
Pancreatitis 
Based on the EAC-confirmed events of acute pancreatitis in the phase 3a pool during the on-treatment 
period, there was an increased risk of acute pancreatitis with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo. 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 170/177 
 
 
 
 
There were 4 EAC-confirmed events of acute pancreatitis with semaglutide 2.4 mg (0.2%) and 1 with placebo 
(<0.1). 
Mean lipase and amylase levels increased with semaglutide 2.4 mg, and at week 68, lipase levels seemed to 
have reached a plateau with a 39% increase while amylase levels had increased by 16% and seemingly had 
not levelled off. In line with other studies, in the absence of other signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis, 
elevations in pancreatic enzymes alone are not predictive of acute pancreatitis.  
Cardiovascular disorders 
In the phase 3a pool, AEs of cardiovascular disorders (MedDRA search) were reported at slightly lower 
frequency and rate with semaglutide 2.4 mg (8.7% of subjects, 8.3 events per 100 PYO) vs placebo (10.9% 
of subjects, 10.9 events per 100 PYO). A comparable proportion of subjects had events with semaglutide 2.4 
mg and placebo (1.6% vs 1.8%). 
A total of 20 EAC-confirmed first MACEs were reported by the same proportion of subjects with semaglutide 
2.4 mg and placebo (0.5% for both treatments).  
Across STEP 1‒3 and the run-in period of STEP 4, increases in pulse were observed in the semaglutide 2.4 
mg group. The ETD (semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo) for mean increases in pulse from baseline to week 68 
ranged from 1−4 bpm. The pulse increases were comparable to what has been reported with semaglutide 
s.c. for T2D (2−5 bpm for semaglutide 1.0 mg vs placebo) and oral semaglutide for T2D (3−4 bpm for 
semaglutide 14 mg vs placebo).  
There was no treatment difference in the reporting of AEs within the HLGT Cardiac arrhythmias (sema 2.4 
mg: 2.3%, 2.1 events per 100 PYE, placebo: 2.0%, 1.9 events per 100 PYE) in the phase 3a pool.  
A cardiovascular outcome trial with semaglutide 2.4 mg is ongoing. In patients with diabetes, positive effects 
of lower dose semaglutide on cardiovascular events have been demonstrated (SUSTAIN 6). 
Hypoglycaemia 
In the phase 3a without T2D group, the proportion of subjects with AEs of hypoglycaemia was low and 
comparable with semaglutide 2.4 mg (0.6%) and placebo (0.7%).  
In subjects with T2D, the proportion of subjects with level 2 episodes of hypoglycaemia (6.2% vs 2.5%) and 
the rate of episodes (10.7 vs 3.2 episodes per 100 PYE) was higher with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to 
placebo. The majority of the episodes occurred when semaglutide 2.4 mg was used in combination with SU, 
which is in line with what is seen with semaglutide s.c. for T2D and oral semaglutide for T2D. However, many 
patients with hypoglycaemia were not using SU. In addition, there was one severe hypoglycaemic episode 
with semaglutide. This occurred in a patient without SU treatment. The fact that semaglutide may cause 
(severe) hypoglycaemia in patients without SU is now clearly stated in the SmPC.  
Retinopathy 
Retinal disorders were included as a safety focus area for the STEP 2 trial (diabetes patients) in the 
semaglutide 2.4 mg for the weight management programme. In STEP 2, subjects with uncontrolled and 
potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy were not eligible for enrolment in the trial. A total of 
85 AEs of retinal disorders were identified by the pre-defined MedDRA search. These events were reported by 
a larger proportion of subjects with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 2.4 mg compared to placebo (6.2%, 6.9% and 
4.2%, respectively). One subject discontinued treatment with trial product permanently, and one subject had 
a dose reduction of the trial product; both subjects were treated with semaglutide 1.0 mg. There appears to 
Assessment report

be a dose-response for events of new onset or worsening of diabetic retinopathy at higher doses (observed in 
19 subjects with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to 12 subjects with semaglutide 1.0 mg), despite similar 
initial glucose-lowering effects.   
The semaglutide s.c. for T2D CVOT (SUSTAIN 6) also showed a higher risk of retinopathy with semaglutide 
s.c. compared to placebo (50 subjects (3.0%) vs 29 subjects (1.8%); and a HR of 1.76 [1.11; 2.78]95% CI 
for time to first event). The increased risk was primarily seen in pre-disposed patients with pre
existing 
diabetic retinopathy and poor glycaemic control at baseline and who were being treated with insulins at 
‐
baseline. In SUSTAIN 6, it has been suggested that the events that occurred with semaglutide and placebo 
represent an early worsening in connection to intensified treatment. However, in SUSTAIN 6, compared to 
placebo, the incidence of retinopathy events continued to increase up to 2 years after initiation of treatment 
(longer than that observed in insulin studies with large decreases in HbA1c). In addition, in the CVOT in 
patients with pre-existent retinopathy, an increased risk with semaglutide compared to placebo was not only 
seen in patients with large decreases in HbA1c, but also in patients with HbA1c reductions < 0.5%. 
Importantly, in STEP 2, the increased risk of retinopathy with semaglutide in STEP 2 was not associated with 
larger decreases in HbA1c and cannot be interpreted as early worsening.  
To further evaluate this issue, a dedicated randomised clinical trial with semaglutide s.c. (NN9535 4352, 
FOCUS) is currently being conducted to assess the long-term effects of treatment with semaglutide at a 
target dose of 1.0 mg on diabetic retinopathy development and progression when added to standard of care 
in subjects with T2D. Incorporation of a new dose arm into the FOCUS trial is not feasible 
For support of the position that a direct effect of semaglutide on the retina seems unlikely, the Applicant 
further refers to non-clinical data. Across nonclinical toxicology studies in mice, rats and cynomolgus 
monkeys with semaglutide, no treatment-related findings on the retina or the optic nerve has been observed 
by ophthalmoscopy or histopathology at exposures up to 22-fold the clinical exposure of semaglutide 2.4 mg. 
Using specific methods Novo Nordisk has found limited protein and mRNA expression of GLP-1 receptors in 
normal human eyes with expression being confined to single neurons in the ganglion cell layer. No GLP-1 
receptor expression was detected in eyes of individuals with advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy 
including in areas characterised by neovascularisation. The Applicant also states that review of the post-
marketing safety data for Saxenda (liraglutide, structurally similar to semaglutide) showed no association 
between liraglutide and retinopathy.  Although a direct effect cannot be excluded, these data offer some level 
of reassurance. Additional reassurance comes from SUSTAIN FORTE. In this study identical proportions of 
subjects with AEs within ‘Diabetic retinopathy’ were seen in each semaglutide dose group (sema 1.0 mg: 
7/480 subjects, 1.5%; sema 2.0 mg: 7/479 subjects, 1.5%).  
In further considering that data from Sustain 6 indicated increased risk of EAC-confirmed diabetic retinopathy 
complications only in patients with pre-existent DRP, the Applicant’s position not to add retinopathy in 
patients without diabetes as a potential risk in the RMP is accepted (from the Ozempic EPAR: “Among 
patients without pre-existing diabetic retinopathy, events of EAC-confirmed diabetic retinopathy 
complications were few and there was no imbalance in events of diabetic retinopathy complications between 
patients treated with semaglutide as compared with placebo (5 vs 4 events). Supporting a lack of effect in 
those patients without baseline retinopathy, no difference was observed in patients with a baseline 
fundoscopy evaluated to be normal.”). 
Considering that an exclusion criterion was added in STEP 2 “regarding active uncontrolled and potentially 
unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy and that subjects with pre-existent diabetic retinopathy were 
identified in the SUSTAIN 6 CVOT as being at highest risk, the unstable population may be very vulnerable., 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 172/177 
 
 
 
The Company provided data on the effects of semaglutide on DRP and MACE in patients with "uncontrolled or 
potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy" in SUSTAIN 6 (semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg in patients with 
diabetes). The estimated HRs in the ‘uncontrolled or potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy’ subpopulation 
in SUSTAIN 6 are consistent with those in the overall population. However, the absolute effects are of a 
different magnitude. In the ‘uncontrolled or potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy’ subpopulation for every 
100 patients that were treated, semaglutide prevented 3 MACE events, but caused 6 events of serious DRP. A 
strict warning was added to the SmPC. 
Infections 
It would appear that the use of semaglutide 2.4 mg in combination with low-calorie diet and exercise (STEP 
3) is associated with an increased risk of severe and serious infections (perhaps through increased loss of 
lean body mass and/or some other mechanism resulting in decreased immunity). However, there was only a 
small number of subjects for whom severe infections were reported with no clustering of events over time in 
the trial. Overall, these data do not permit firm conclusions. 
Subgroup analyses 
Gender, age and renal function 
There were no consistent differences between males and females in gastrointestinal AEs, the most commonly 
observed AEs with GLP-1 RAs. Gastrointestinal AEs were reported more often by subjects with age 65 to <75 
years and subjects with moderate renal impairment at baseline (based on a very low number of subjects in 
this subgroup). Results for the age group ≥75 years should be interpreted with caution. In this age group 
only 23 subjects treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 13 subjects treated with placebo. Based on the 
apparent lack of impact of baseline age on exposure in STEP 1 and 2, it appears unlikely that the more 
pronounced treatment difference in proportion of subjects with gastrointestinal AEs with increasing age 
(partly driven by differences within the placebo group) should be due to a difference in exposure across 
subgroups by age. However, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be excluded. The revised 
text in the SmPC (SmPC, Section 4.2 ‘Posology’) allows for delayed dose escalation or lowering to the 
previous dose until symptoms have improved, which is considered sufficient to mitigate the risk for females 
and elderly people. Nevertheless, the revised SPC now also states that greater sensitivity of some older 
individuals cannot be excluded. 
Considering the low number of patients with moderate renal impairment, semaglutide should be used with 
care in these individuals. This is now added to the SmPC. 
Weight loss 
The safety profile of subjects within the semaglutide 2.4 mg group who lost 20% or more of their body 
weight compared to those who did not differed for several AE types. The AE types more frequently reported 
among subjects with a large weight loss were gastrointestinal, decreased appetite, Alopecia, Dizziness, 
Headache and Cholelithiasis. changes in the dose are not necessary with subsequent weight loss. First, within 
the range of exposures observed for the 2.4 mg dose level (e.g. 90% range of model-derived Cavg in STEP 1 
was 51−110 nmol/L), a 18% difference in exposures (as a consequence of weight loss) was considered to be 
of negligible clinical relevance. Second, the revised text in the posology section of the SmPC allows for 
delayed dose escalation or lowering to the previous dose until symptoms have improved, which should be 
sufficient for any patient irrespective of their speed and size of weight loss. Third, SAEs and severe AEs were 
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 173/177 
 
 
 
 
reported by similar proportions and AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of trial product by a lower 
proportion of subjects with a weight loss ≥20% vs <20%. 
Race and region 
Asian subjects compared to the other subgroups by race had a more pronounced treatment difference in the 
reporting of AEs with PT Decreased appetite; no treatment difference in the reporting of AEs with PT 
Headache. The more pronounced treatment difference in reporting of AEs of Decreased appetite among Asian 
subjects could be related to the higher exposure in these subjects due to a lower body weight. 
The treatment differences in the proportion of subjects reporting of AEs within the Gastrointestinal disorders 
SOC varied across regions. For example, treatment differences in the proportion of subjects reporting of AEs 
within the Gastrointestinal disorders were only 2% points in Africa, 24% points in Europe and 44% points in 
Asia (excl east Asia). These differences are very remarkable. For subjects from South America and 
(East)Asia, there were more pronounced treatment differences in reporting several gastrointestinal AEs. A 
clear explanation for the regional differences in reporting of gastrointestinal AEs. There may be cultural 
differences in how gastrointestinal AEs are perceived and reported across regions. 
Immunogenicity 
In STEP 1 and STEP 2, the proportion of subjects that tested positive for anti-semaglutide antibodies at any 
time point post-baseline was low (50 subjects, 2.9% of subjects randomised to semaglutide 2.4 mg). The 
company concluded that the formation of antibodies did not influence the efficacy and the occurrence of 
adverse events. For efficacy, the mean body weight %-changes from baseline for STEP 1 and STEP 2 were 
approximately 2%-points lower for subjects with antibodies, compared to subjects without antibodies. 
However, we agree with the company that the low number of subjects with antibodies compared to the 
subjects without antibodies precludes statistical interpretation (STEP 1: 39 vs 1267 subjects, STEP 2: 12 vs 
391 subjects). The 2%-points difference in efficacy may be a chance finding. This may also be true for the 
safety parameters Allergic reactions and Injection site reaction. The difference between subjects with 
antibodies compared to subjects without antibodies is driven by few subjects with antibodies (8 subjects with 
Allergic reactions and 3 subjects with Injection site reactions), hence a causal relationship cannot be 
concluded.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion  
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment on weight loss is considerably larger compared to currently 
available treatments. The effect of semaglutide on weight loss was found in all four STEP trials and supports 
a consistent effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg. In addition, the weight loss achieved is considered clinically 
relevant and persists after 68 weeks of treatment. However, the effects on weight loss are clearly less 
pronounced in patients with T2D, in male patients and patients with a higher baseline weight. But also in 
these subgroups the achieved weight loss is considered clinically relevant.  
The obtained weight loss is considered an important benefit and it is also accompanied by improvements in 
SBP and glycaemic parameters, the latter mostly in T2D patients. These improvements may lead to a 
decrease in health-related complications, but a benefit on cardiovascular outcome has not yet been shown. A 
cardiovascular outcome trial with semaglutide 2.4 mg is ongoing.  
Assessment report  
EMA/112307/2022 
Page 175/177 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the results of STEP 4, it is expected that treatment needs to be continued long-term to maintain the 
achieved weight loss, as after cessation of treatment, weight gain occurs. In addition, no further weight loss 
is expected after 68 weeks, and it remains uncertain if, after longer ongoing treatment, weight gain may 
occur again. A stopping rule at week 28 was not introduced in the SmPC, as among early non-responders the 
proportion of patients achieving a weight loss at week 68 was substantial. However, even without a stopping 
rule, regular evaluation concerning treatment discontinuation is needed and this is considered to fall within 
the regular clinical practice. 
In general, the safety profile of semaglutide subcutaneous (s.c.) 2.4 mg once weekly for weight management 
appears similar to that of other GLP-1 receptor agonists. However, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse 
events appears larger than in previous studies with GLP-1 RA’s for the treatment of diabetes. These events 
can be an important burden for patients. On the other hand, gastrointestinal adverse events are transient, 
and will diminish over time.  
Several new adverse events were identified (hair loss, dizziness, headache). These events may be 
burdensome for patients, but it is likely that all will disappear after treatment is stopped.  
Semaglutide caused also hypoglycaemia in patients with diabetes without SU. This is an important issue that 
is now clearly stated in the SmPC.  
Subjects with uncontrolled and potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy were not eligible for 
enrolment in the trial. The increased risk of retinopathy in these patients is a possible very serious issue. To 
evaluate this issue in more detail, a dedicated randomised clinical trial with low dose semaglutide s.c. 
(NN9535 4352, FOCUS) is currently being conducted to assess the long-term effects of treatment with 
semaglutide on diabetic retinopathy development and progression when added to standard of care in subjects 
with T2D. Nevertheless, questions about possible direct effects on the retina remain. A warning in patients 
with uncontrolled and potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy has been added to the SmPC. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks  
Obesity is associated with several health-related complications and most patients experience large difficulties 
with achieving weight loss. Treatment options (non-surgical) leading to clinically relevant weight loss are 
considered important. The effect of semaglutide on body weight is considered clinically relevant and larger 
than that observed in previous studies with GLP-1 RAs.  
The effects of semaglutide 2.4 mg on cardiovascular events are uncertain, but a specific outcome trial with 
high dose semaglutide is ongoing. This trial will also provide data on adverse events during long term 
treatment. Considering the expected need for long-term treatment, no large safety issues are considered 
acceptable. The safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg appears similar to that of other GLP-1 receptor agonists, 
and no important new safety signals were identified.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance  
Several adverse events are more pronounced with the high dose semaglutide compared to the lower dose in 
diabetes and several new adverse events were identified. These events may be burdensome for patients, but 
they will likely disappear after the dose is decreased or alternatively after treatment is stopped. The concern 
of diabetic retinopathy will be monitored together with the high dose semaglutide used for the treatment of 
diabetes mellitus indication.

3.8.  Conclusions  
The overall benefit/risk balance of Wegovy is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Wegovy is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Wegovy is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight 
management, including weight loss and weight maintenance, in adults with an initial Body Mass Index (BMI) 
of  
• 
≥30 kg/m2 (obesity), or  
≥27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2 (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbidity e.g. 
• 
dysglycaemia (prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus), hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep 
apnoea or cardiovascular disease. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

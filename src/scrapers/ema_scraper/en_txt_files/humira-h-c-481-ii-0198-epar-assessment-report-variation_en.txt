2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Introduction
2.1.1.  Problem statement
Disease or condition
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the two primary forms of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It 
is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disease of the rectum and/or large intestine characterized by 
inflammation and ulceration of the mucosal and submucosal intestinal layers. The hallmark clinical 
symptoms include bloody diarrhoea associated with rectal urgency and tenesmus. 
The clinical course of UC is marked by exacerbation and remission of symptoms and may eventually 
require a restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch–anal anastomosis (IPAA) in up to 30% of patients. 
The most severe intestinal manifestations of UC are toxic megacolon, perforation, and massive 
haemorrhage. Furthermore, UC may be accompanied by extra-intestinal manifestations such as arthritis, 
dermatological conditions, uveitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis (which can progress to liver failure 
requiring transplantation, and is associated with an increased risk of colorectal, bile duct, and gallbladder 
cancers). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 7/136
 
 
The general clinical and histopathological features of UC as well as the drug effects are similar in adults 
and children. Both patient populations share the same clinical hallmark symptoms: inflammation being 
limited to large intestine and rectum, the occurrence of extra-intestinal manifestations, and the clinical 
course which usually alternates between exacerbation and remission and may lead to colectomy. There is 
also substantial overlap of gene expression profiles from disease tissues in both paediatric and adult UC 
patients suggesting strong similarity of molecular pathways. In addition, treatment paradigms are 
essentially similar for both populations, and pharmacological therapies such as aminosalicylates, 
corticosteroids, immunosuppressants (IMMs), and the anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) infliximab have 
shown efficacy in adult and paediatric patients with UC. However, there are differences in the phenotypic 
presentation and progression of the disease. While the vast majority of adults with UC have limited or 
left-sided colitis, pancolitis is more common in children. Ulcerative colitis often presents as a more severe 
disease in children. Severity of disease correlates with the likelihood of colectomy; 10-year colectomy 
rates in adults are 15% to 25% compared to 30% to 40% in paediatric patients. 
The burden of colectomy is high in paediatric UC; among children presenting with moderate or severe 
disease, 9% had surgery within 1 year and 26% within 5 years. The cumulative likelihood of colectomy is 
generally similar between adults and children (in children 6% after 1year, 29% after 20years). 
Age of Onset, Incidence, and Prevalence 
Ulcerative colitis onset can occur at any age, but it is rare in infants and relatively infrequent in early 
childhood. The overall (adult and paediatric) incidence of UC has been reported as 1.2 to 20.3 cases per 
100,000 persons/year. Incidence of paediatric IBD (Crohn's disease [CD] and UC) has been increasing 
worldwide. Evidence suggests that the incidence of early-onset IBD, including UC, is increasing in younger 
age groups. Recent studies provide incidence estimates for children under 5years old in European 
countries, including up to 1.0 per 100,000 for females in the UK, 0.7 per 100,000 in Hungary, and 2.22 
per 100,000 in Germany. Among older children, estimated incidence rates are higher. In France, the 
estimated incidence of UC is 0.6 per 100,000 person-years among children aged 0 to 9 years old and 4.1 
per 100,000 person-years among children aged 10 to 16. Corresponding estimates in Finland are 3.1 per 
100,000 person-years for children 0 to 9 years, 15.4 per 100,000 person-years for 10 to 15 years, and 
finally 40.4 per 100,000 person years for 15 to 19 years old. Similar increases in incidence with increases 
in age was also seen in Germany, Italy, the UK, and Hungary. 
There are some published prevalence estimates of UC for a few European countries, although the bulk of 
the recently published literature reports estimated incidence rates as opposed to prevalence estimates. 
Unsurprisingly, prevalence increases with increasing age. The highest published prevalence estimate was 
from Denmark, with an estimated 83.4 cases per 100,000 people under 16 years old. The lowest 
prevalence estimate is from Germany, which was 23.74 cases per 100,000 children 18 years old or 
younger.
In a commercially insured US population of over 12.5 million people for the period 2008–2009, the 
prevalence of paediatric UC (<20 years of age) was estimated as 34 (95% confidence interval [CI] 32 – 
36) per 100,000 persons. The prevalence of paediatric UC increased with age.
More recently, in an observational retrospective cross-sectional study conducted in 2 claims databases in 
the US, the pooled prevalence in 2016 per 100,000 was 21.6 for UC (95% CI, 20.3– 22.8) for paediatric 
patients (2 to 17 years of age). This real-world data study reported a 152% increase in prevalence for UC 
from 2007 to 2016 (8.6 to 21.6), which was attributed mainly to increases in the 10 to 17-year-old 
subgroup.
With this variation, the MAH seeks to add the following indication to the product information for Humira 
(adalimumab):
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 8/136
 
 
Humira is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in 
paediatric patients (from 5 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional 
therapy including corticosteroids and/or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who 
are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies.
The proposed dosing regimen of adalimumab for patients from 5 to 17 years of age with UC is based on 
body weight. 


For patients < 40 kg, the induction dose is 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, followed by a 
maintenance dose of 40 mg every other week (eow) starting at Week 4. 
For patients ≥ 40 kg, the induction dose is 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 
a maintenance dose of 80 mg eow starting at Week 4. The maintenance doses of 40 mg eow and 
80 mg eow are considered equivalent to 20 mg every week (ew) and 40 mg ew doses, 
respectively. 
Continued therapy beyond 8 weeks should be carefully considered in patients not showing signs of 
response within this time period. Patients who experience a disease flare after beginning maintenance 
therapy may benefit from a one-time re-induction dose of 80 mg (< 40 kg) or 160 mg (≥ 40 kg), 
followed by maintenance dosing.
Management
The pharmacological treatment of UC in childhood is largely the same as in adulthood. Conventional 
pharmaceutical therapies do not completely abate the inflammatory process and have significant side 
effects. Conventional therapies for the induction of remission include anti-inflammatory agents (5-
aminosalicylic acid [5-ASA] derivatives and corticosteroids) and the immunomodulatory agent 
cyclosporine. 5-aminosalicylic acid derivatives as well as immunomodulatory agents (azathioprine [AZA]or 
6-mercaptopurine [6-MP]) have been used for the maintenance of remission. Safety issues associated 
with the use of thiopurines include bone marrow suppression, malignancies including lymphoma, and 
serious infections including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Corticosteroids are not effective 
for the maintenance of remission. In addition to the induction and maintenance of clinical remission, 
absence of adverse effects on linear growth and maturation is demanded from therapy of paediatric UC. 
Similar to adults, corticosteroid dependence is frequent, but long-term corticosteroids are absolutely 
contraindicated because they do not maintain remission and have a negative effect on linear growth and 
bone mineralization. 
Infliximab (a chimeric monoclonal anti-TNF-α antibody) is approved in Europe for the treatment of 
paediatric patients with severe UC and in the US for the treatment of paediatric patients with moderate to 
severe UC based on the results of an open-label (OL) study in 60 subjects. However, infliximab is an 
intravenous (IV) therapy, may pose a burden to paediatric patients. For adult UC, vedolizumab and 
tofacitinib were approved globally and in the US and European Union (EU) respectively, and ustekinumab 
was approved in the US and EU recently, but none have been approved for paediatric UC patients. Hence, 
additional treatment options that offer induction and maintenance of remission to a clinically meaningful 
number of patients, an acceptable safety profile, and more convenient dosing regimens than currently 
approved therapies are needed for paediatric UC patients.
2.1.2.  About the product
Adalimumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin (IgG1) monoclonal antibody containing only human 
peptide sequences. Adalimumab is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell 
expression system. It consists of 1330 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 9/136
 
 
kilodaltons. Adalimumab is composed of fully human heavy and light chain variable regions, which confer 
specificity to human TNF, and human IgG1 heavy chain and kappa light chain sequences. Adalimumab 
binds with high affinity and specificity to soluble TNF-α but not to lymphotoxin-α (TNF-β).
Tumour necrosis factor is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and 
immune responses. Elevated levels of TNF play an important role in pathologic inflammation.  
Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralizes the biological function of TNF by blocking its 
interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab also modulates biological 
responses that are induced or regulated by TNF. After treatment with adalimumab, levels of acute phase 
reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and serum cytokines 
rapidly decrease.
Adalimumab was first approved for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the US in 
December 2002 and in the EU in September 2003. In addition, adalimumab is approved for the treatment 
of patients with early RA, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) (2 years of age and older), 
psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, CD (adult and paediatric), UC (adult), plaque psoriasis (Ps) 
(adult), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)(adult and adolescent), and non-infectious uveitis (adult and 
paediatric) in the EU, US, and the rest of the world. Adalimumab is also approved for the treatment of 
patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA), paediatric enthesitis-related arthritis 
(ERA), and paediatric plaque Ps in the EU and many other countries, as well as for intestinal Behcet's 
disease in Japan and several other countries outside of the EU. Most recently, adalimumab has been 
approved for the treatment of generalized pustular Ps in Japan.
The estimated cumulative postmarketing patient exposure since the International Birth Date (31 
December 2002) through 31 December 2019 is approximately 7.8 million PYs.  
Adalimumab has been evaluated in 49,693 subjects in MAH-sponsored clinical trials and patient registries 
through 31 December 2019.
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects
No new non clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
In accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for 
Human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), proteins are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the 
environment. Hence, the CHMP agreed that no environmental risk assessment studies were needed.
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
Given that the pharmaco-toxicological profile of adalimumab has been well established, the CHMP agreed 
that no non-clinical data were needed to support this application.

2.3.  Clinical aspects
2.3.1.  Introduction
Adalimumab is a fully human antibody that binds specifically to Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α and 
neutralizes the biological function of TNF-α. Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are 
induced or regulated by TNF-α. After treatment with adalimumab, levels of acute phase reactants of 
inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines 
rapidly decrease. Adalimumab is approved for use in the treatment of several immunological diseases 
including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic 
arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, adult and paediatric Crohn's disease, adult and paediatric uveitis, adult 
and adolescent hidradenitis suppurativa, plaque psoriasis and adult ulcerative colitis (UC). 
In this submission, the MAH seeks to add a new indication for Humira (adalimumab) for the treatment of 
paediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age with moderately to severely active UC. This application is 
supported by data from 2 Phase 3 clinical studies: 


a randomized, controlled study (Study M11-290);
an open-label (OL) long-term study (Study M10-870) for subjects who participated in, and 
successfully completed Study M11-290. 
Study M11-290 is a post-marketing commitment to the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA). This submission also aims to fulfil the agreed European Union (EU) Paediatric Investigation Plan 
(PIP) (EMEA-000366-PIP02-09-M06, Decision P/0174/2019).
Proposed Indication and Dose
Humira is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in paediatric 
patients (from 5 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including 
corticosteroids and/or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have 
medical contraindications for such therapies.
The proposed dosing regimen of adalimumab for patients from 5 to 17 years of age with UC is based on 
body weight.  For patients < 40 kg, the induction dose is 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, 
followed by a maintenance dose of 40 mg every other week (eow) starting at Week 4.  For patients ≥ 40 
kg, the induction dose is 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by a maintenance dose of 80 
mg eow starting at Week 4.  The maintenance doses of 40 mg eow and 80 mg eow are considered 
equivalent to 20 mg every week (ew) and 40 mg ew doses, respectively.  Continued therapy beyond 8 
weeks should be carefully considered in patients not showing signs of response within this time period.  
Patients who experience a disease flare after beginning maintenance therapy may benefit from a one-
time re-induction dose of 80 mg (< 40 kg) or 160 mg (≥ 40 kg), followed by maintenance dosing.
GCP
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinetic (PK) and immunogenicity of adalimumab were evaluated in paediatric subjects with 
moderate to severe UC in a Phase 3 study (Study M11-290). 
Population PK of adalimumab was also assessed in paediatric UC subjects using a non-linear mixed effects 
modelling approach. 
The PK and immunogenicity of adalimumab are well characterized in paediatric subjects in the approved 
indications of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA; specifically, the categories of polyarticular JIA [pJIA] and 
enthesitis-related arthritis [ERA]), paediatric psoriasis (Ps), and paediatric Crohn's disease (CD)). 
Methods
Bioanalytical methods
Bioanalytical methods for adalimumab and anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) were provided with previous 
submissions. No additional biopharmaceutic or analytical studies are included in this application.
Descriptive pharmacokinetic analysis for study M11-290
Analysis of adalimumab
Serum adalimumab concentrations were summarized at each time point using descriptive statistics. For 
induction period, serum adalimumab concentrations were analyzed by induction dose group, prior anti- 
TNF use, Baseline HACA status, and PMS remission status at Week 8. For maintenance period, summaries 
of serum adalimumab concentrations were compared by maintenance dose group and remission status at 
Week 52 per Full Mayo Score (FMS) in those subjects who were responders per PMS at Week 8. Data 
listings were generated for individual subjects. For the calculation of summary statistics and plots, 
concentration values below lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) were set to zero.

EMA/584443/2020
Page 12/136
 
 
Analysis of immunogenicity
The number and percentage of subjects who developed AAA were determined. The impact of AAA status 
on serum adalimumab concentrations, efficacy (both coprimary efficacy points) and safety were assessed.
Population pharmacokinetic analysis
A cross-indication popPK analysis was performed. The analysis is described under the section 
Pharmacokinetics in target population.
Pharmacokinetics in target population - study M11-290
A total of 100 paediatric UC subjects (93 in main study and 7 in Japan sub-study) were included in the PK 
summary and population PK modelling, as well as exposure-response/simulation analyses. The mean age 
was 14 years and the mean body weight was 55 kg. Blood samples were obtained for the measurement 
of adalimumab concentrations at Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 16, 26 and at 52/ET and for the measurement of 
AAA at Baseline, Weeks 16, 26 and 52/ET. 
Summary of adalimumab concentrations versus time for the first 8 weeks by induction dose group and 
infliximab/HACA status were compared. The mean adalimumab concentrations appeared similar in anti-
TNF-naïve and anti-TNF-experienced subjects in both induction dose groups. Adalimumab concentrations 
appeared to be lower in HACA+ subjects (N = 3) than in HACA– subjects for the high induction dose 
group. However, adalimumab concentrations in HACA+ subject (N = 1) were similar to the mean 
adalimumab concentrations in HACA– subjects for the standard induction dose group.
A summary of adalimumab concentrations by induction dose and maintenance dose are presented in 
Table 1. Results show that the mean adalimumab concentration were 24.0 μg/mL and 17.2 μg/mL in 
subjects receiving high induction dose at Weeks 2 and 4 compared to 9.83 μg/mL and 10.5 μg/mL in 
subjects receiving standard induction dose. Mean adalimumab concentrations appeared to be slightly 
higher in subjects who achieved PMS remission at Week 8 than those who did not in both treatment 
groups (Figure 1).

At Week 8, subjects who demonstrated a clinical response per PMS were allowed to continue in the 
maintenance period of the study. Starting from Week 26, the mean adalimumab steady state 
concentrations reached approximately 15 – 17 μg/mL and 4 – 6 μg/mL for high maintenance dose and 
standard maintenance dose, respectively (Figure 2). For subjects who were randomized to placebo 
treatment in maintenance period, their measurable adalimumab levels were due to receipt of adalimumab 
due to disease flare.

For subjects receiving either high dose or standard dose in maintenance period without disease flare, 
mean adalimumab concentrations were comparable regardless of their clinical remission status at Week 
52 per full Mayo Score. For subjects who were on placebo during maintenance period without disease 
flares, all 3 of them achieved clinical remission at Week 52 per full Mayo score (Figure 3).

For subjects on high dose in maintenance period without disease flare, the mean adalimumab 
concentrations were similar with large variability among subjects by Week 52 remission status per full 
Mayo score. For subjects on standard dose (N = 8) in maintenance period without disease flare, none of 
them achieved Week 52 clinical remission per full Mayo score. For subjects (N = 2) who were on placebo 
in maintenance period without disease flares, one subject achieved Week 52 remission per full Mayo score 
and the other did not. Both had similar adalimumab concentrations (Figure 4).

Population pharmacokinetic analysis
Data inclusion
The population PK model development included paediatric Study M11-290 (UC), Study M06-806 (Crohn's 
disease [CD]), Study M04-717 (Psoriasis [Ps]), Study DE038 (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
[pJIA]), Study M11-328 (Enthesis-Related Arthritis [ERA]) and Study M10-444 (pJIA).
Study M11-290
All subjects who received at least one dose of adalimumab treatment and who had at least one 
adalimumab concentration measurement between first and last adalimumab dose plus 30 days were 
included in the analyses. Doses and concentrations were included up to a maximum of 52 weeks, starting 
with the first adalimumab dose. Only doses that reported in the database with available dates were used. 
Adalimumab doses given later than one day after the last concentration measurement were excluded 
from the model. Concentrations measured before the first active dose or after the last active dose + 30 
days were excluded. Concentrations that did not have a blood collection date were excluded. For 
concentrations with available collection date but missing collection time, the measurements were 
included, and the time was set to 12:00 AM. Actual dosing times were used in the analyses where 
available. When data times were not available, a dosing time of 8:00 AM was assumed.
All concentrations below limit of quantitation (BLQ) in the PK dataset were set to LLOQ/2.

Figure 5 Study Design Schematic for Dose Escalation After Amendment 4 (Study M11-290)
There were 101 paediatric subjects (93 in main study and 8 in Japan sub-study) with UC enrolled in 
Study M11-290. One subject  in the Japan sub-study did not have any adalimumab, AAA, infliximab and 
HACA results. Therefore, the subject was excluded in the PK and immunogenicity summary calculations 
and analyses. A summary of all subjects' disposition information on dosing assignments in induction and 
maintenance period, as well as disease flare status, is listed in Table 2. 
The dose levels in the study are summarised below, the study design of M11-290 is further described in 
the clinical efficacy section. All doses were administered as subcutaneous injections.

Induction phase: 2.4 mg/kg (max 160 mg) week 1 and 2, high dose 1.2 mg/kg (max 80 mg) or 
no dose for standard dose week 3, and 0.6 mg/kg (max 40 mg) week 4.
 Maintenance phase: standard dose 0.6 mg/kg [max 40 mg] eow, high dose 0.6 mg/kg [max 40 
mg] ew. 
Subjects with a disease flare were allowed to receive a re-induction dose. A subject was allowed to 
receive treatment for disease flare 3 times before being withdrawn from the study.
The summary demographic data for all subjects in study M11-290 are shown in Table 3.

Model development
The starting PK model was a one-compartment model. The model complexity was increased until no 
improvement of the model fit could be achieved anymore or until the models could not be estimated. In 
the next model, building step covariates were tested to improve the model using the forward inclusion 
backward elimination procedure. The likelihood ratio test was used for hypothesis testing to discriminate 
among alternative models. Graphical methods were employed to assess model goodness of fit. 
From the previously developed cross-indication paediatric PK model for adalimumab (as described in 
procedure EMEA/H/C/0481/II/0134) and several adult and paediatric studies of adalimumab, it was 
known that both AAA and concomitant MTX medication impact the exposure of adalimumab. Therefore, 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 18/136
 
 
both AAA and MTX were tested on apparent clearance (CL/F) of adalimumab and subsequently included 
as covariates if significant before other covariates were tested. The following additional covariates were 
tested on:


CL/F: Baseline body weight, baseline body surface area, baseline age, baseline albumin, baseline 
high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), baseline AST, baseline ALT, indication, race;
Apparent volume of distribution (V2/F) and first-order absorption rate constant (Ka): baseline 
body weight, baseline body surface area, baseline age, indication, race.
In the final paediatric PK model, adalimumab pharmacokinetics were characterized using a one-
compartment model with linear absorption. Overall, adalimumab apparent oral clearance (CL/F) in 
paediatric subjects with UC was comparable to that in other paediatric populations after accounting for 
identified covariates. Inter-subject-variability (ISV) in adalimumab CL/F and apparent volume of 
distribution of central compartment (V2/F) were estimated to be 47% and 19%, respectively (Table 5). 
Shrinkage in the distribution of individual ISV were 5.5% and 39% for CL/F and V2/F, respectively.  
Significant model covariates were AAA development, MTX coadministration, baseline albumin serum 
concentration, and baseline body surface area on CL/F as well as baseline body surface area, UC 
indication, and CD indication on V2/F. The estimated PK parameter values are shown in Table 5 and were 
in good agreement with the medians of the parameter values estimated in a bootstrap analysis (not 
shown).

Simulations of exposure to inform dose selection
The final PK model was used to conduct PK simulations for paediatric UC to evaluate fixed-dose regimens 
and compare expected concentrations to those using the body weight-based dosing regimens used in the 
paediatric UC Study M11-290. The fixed-dose regimens were compared to the body weight-based dosing 
regimens with standard and high induction doses as well as to the adult Phase 3 exposures to determine 
an appropriate fixed-dosing regimen similar to body weight-based dosing (Figure 8).

Overall, results of PK modelling and simulation demonstrated that fixed-dose and body weight-based 
dosing (mg/kg) regimens give largely overlapping concentration-time profiles for paediatric UC subjects 
under eow maintenance dosing (Figure 9) or ew maintenance dosing (Figure 10) subsequent to 
induction dosing. Simulated serum adalimumab concentrations were comparable between the fixed-dose 
scenarios that were evaluated (30 or 40 kg cut-off for 160/80 mg at Week 0, 80/40 mg at Week 2, and 
40/20 mg eow or ew starting at Week 4) and the body weight-based dosing used in Study M11-290 in the 
maintenance portion of dosing (eow or ew dosing), respectively.

similar to concentrations at early time points under the standard induction dose from Study M11-290 and 
slightly lower when compared to the concentrations at early time points under the high induction dose 
from Study M11-290. However, simulated serum adalimumab concentrations at early time points under 
the fixed-dose scenarios (30 or 40 kg weight cut-off) were similar to the adalimumab concentrations 
observed at early time points in adult subjects with UC from Study M06-827 (Figure 11).

To further evaluate the potential fixed-dose options with 30 kg or 40 kg body weight cut-off, serum

categories. The distribution of the simulated Week 52 trough serum adalimumab concentrations by body

Upon request from CHMP, the MAH provided simulated exposures for the low weight group of ≥15kg and 
<25kg or ≥25kg.
The simulation approach relied on re-sampling subjects from the observed population to retain realistic 
correlation structures for all covariates.  Two weight bins were created for subjects, including subjects 
≥ 15 kg to < 25 kg and subjects ≥ 25 kg, in order to assess the simulated exposure levels down to 15 
kg.  It is noted that in the weight bin from 15 kg to 25 kg, the paediatric UC dataset only contained data 
for six subjects.  Thus, to continue using this approach, the dataset was enriched using data from the 
other paediatric indications (Crohn's disease [CD], psoriasis [Ps], and enthesitis-related arthritis [ERA]).  
From the combined dataset, all subjects in the 15 kg to 25 kg bin were retained for the simulation dataset 
and combined with all subjects above 25 kg from the M11-290 study.  For all subjects, the indication and 
methotrexate covariates were set to UC and no concomitant use, respectively.  The distribution of the 
covariates across the studies were comparable.
Based on the final population PK model, the resulting virtual populations were used to simulate 
adalimumab concentration-time profiles considering the following dosing regimens (1–7):
1. Studied high induction/high maintenance dosing regimen:  2.4/2.4/1.2 mg/kg at Week 0/1/2 and 
0.6 mg/kg every week (ew) maintenance starting at Week 4
2. Studied high induction/standard maintenance dosing regimen:  2.4/2.4/1.2 mg/kg at Week 0/1/2 
and 0.6 mg/kg every other week (eow) maintenance starting at Week 4
3. Studied standard induction/high maintenance dosing regimen:  2.4/placebo/1.2 mg/kg at Week 
0/1/2 and 0.6 mg/kg ew maintenance starting at Week 4
4. Studied standard induction/standard maintenance dosing regimen:  2.4/placebo/1.2 mg/kg at 
Week 0/1/2 and 0.6 mg/kg eow maintenance starting at Week 4
5. Assessed fixed-dosing regimen:  160/80 mg at Week 0, 80/40 mg at Week 2 and 40/20 mg eow 
maintenance starting at Week 4 (40 kg cut-off)

7. Final proposed fixed-dosing regimen:  160/80 mg at Week 0, 80/40 mg at Week 2 and 80/40 mg 
eow maintenance starting at Week 4 (40 kg cut-off)
One hundred replicates of each regimen for each subject in the dataset were simulated using the final 
population PK model and drawing new between-subject variability (BSV) terms in each replicate.  
The resulting simulated concentration-time profiles were summarized into two weight bins (≥ 15 kg to 
< 25 kg vs ≥ 25 kg).  The adalimumab concentration-time profiles for subjects with either ≥ 15 kg to < 
25 kg or ≥ 25 kg following different dosing regimens are shown in Figure 13.  A direct comparison 
between proposed dosing regimen and studied high induction/high maintenance dosing regimen for 
subjects with ≥ 15 to < 25 kg and subjects with ≥ 25 kg are shown in

2.3.3.  PK/PD modelling
Exposure-response modelling was performed to investigate the relationship of adalimumab in paediatric 
subjects with UC using logistic regression models for the coprimary endpoints of clinical remission per 
PMS at Week 8 and clinical remission per FMS at Week 52 for Week 8 responders per PMS. Furthermore, 
a Markov exposure-response model was developed for clinical remission per PMS collected from baseline 
to Week 52. The demographics and covariate distributions of all subjects included in the Markov model 
and logistic regressions are shown in Table 8.

Logistic Regression Exposure-Response Analyses on Efficacy
Adalimumab observed serum concentrations at Weeks 8 and 52 were used as the exposure measure for 
the logistic regression analyses of clinical remission per PMS at Week 8 and clinical remission per PMS at 
Week 52 for Week 8 responders per PMS, respectively.
The coprimary efficacy endpoints were modelled as binary variables. The endpoint definitions were:




Clinical response per PMS: Decrease in PMS ≥ 2 and ≥ 30% from Baseline
Clinical remission per PMS: PMS ≤ 2 and no sub score > 1
Clinical remission per MS: MS ≤ 2 and no sub score > 1
The probabilities of response were modelled using the equation:
where CP is the exposure metric, and Yi represents the occurrence (or lack thereof) of an event in the ith 
subject. P(Yi = 1) is the probability of observation Y from subject i being equal to 1, with 1 indicating that 
the endpoint is achieved or an event occurred. Placebo describes the probability of an observation in the 
absence of drug while slope describes the strength of the drug effect.
Covariates were tested by adding linear terms as shown above in the equation with PREF being the 
estimated covariate parameter. Tested covariates were sex, age, race, baseline body weight, baseline 
hsCRP, baseline MS, and concomitant medication with methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, 
azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or 5-amino salicylic.
The logistic regression analyses for the coprimary endpoints were performed using software R 3.5.2.
A logistic regression analysis showed an exposure-response relationship between adalimumab 
concentration and % subjects with remission per PMS at Week 8 and a slight relationship for % subjects 
who responded at Week 8 per PMS and achieved clinical remission at Week 52 per full Mayo score in 
paediatric subjects with UC (Figure 16 and Table 9). Adalimumab drug effect was found to be a 
significant predictor for clinical remission per PMS at Week 8 with higher concentrations leading to higher 
remission. Observed remission rates at Week 8 appeared to reach a plateau at the third quartile, while 
there was a slight increase in remission rate at Week 52 with increasing adalimumab concentrations.

results showed that the probability of achieving efficacy endpoints were overlapping for all dosing 
regimens (fixed-dose regimen of 160/80 mg at Week 0, 80/40 mg at Week 2 followed by eow or ew 
[using a 30 or 40 kg body weight cut-off]) and the body weight-based (mg/kg) eow or ew dosing, 
respectively, used in Study M11-290) across the different body weight categories for paediatric UC. The 
small differences in the probability of achieving efficacy endpoints between dosing regimens within and 
across body weight categories are expected based on the different doses and resulting exposures 
(adalimumab concentrations), along with the modest exposure-response relationship.

Markov Exposure-Response Modelling for Clinical Remission per PMS
To show similarity of efficacy between 80 mg eow and 40 mg ew maintenance dosing, a continuous time 
Markov exposure-response modelling approach was utilized, which took into account the time course of 
response with adalimumab treatment. The Markov model employed described the relationship between 
actual adalimumab serum exposures Cp on achievement of clinical remission per PMS in Study M11-290. 
Only the Week 8 responders per PMS who entered the maintenance period of Study M11-290 were 
considered for model building to avoid modelling study design artefacts such as the forced dropout for 
non-responders per PMS at Week 8. A total of 80 subjects who entered the maintenance phase were 
included in the modelling.
The time course of clinical remission was modelled via transitions between model states, which were 
characterized by respective transition rate constants Kij. The rate constant K01 describes the transition 
from no response to response, the rate constant K10 the transition from response to no response, the 
rate constant K0D the transition from no response to dropout, and the rate constant K1D the transition 
from response to dropout. A model schematic is illustrated below:
Transition rates were then translated into time-dependent transition probabilities Pij. Due to the time-
continuous implementation, rapid changes of disease states were enabled. The Markov property implies 
that future states only depend on the current state, therefore accounting for serial correlation in data. 
This stochastic process was described by the Kolmogorov forward equations.
yielding a system of differential equations for the probabilities of going from state i to state j. Drug effect 
on transition rate constants K01 was incorporated using an Emax model as:
Where Cp denotes the exposure metric used. Emax describes the maximum drug effect on rate constant 
K01, with concentration that provides half the maximal response (EC50) being the concentration at which 
half maximal effect on K01 is achieved.
The parameter estimates of the model are shown in Table 10. The dropout rate K1D for dropout from 
response was estimated to be very low and could not be estimated precisely. The model was rerun fixing 
rate K1D to the point estimate. When comparing K1D with the dropout rate K0D from no response, one 
can see that K1D was estimated to be much lower compared to K0D indicating that the dropout is 
informative where mostly non-responders leave the study. Visual predictive checks were performed and

showed that the model adequately described the observed clinical remission per PMS and dropout in 
Study M11-290 (Figure 19).

Exposure-Safety Analysis in Paediatric Subjects
The range of concentrations expected with the proposed fixed-dose regimen, based on population PK 
simulations, has been previously observed in paediatric subjects across several indications of 
adalimumab. The relationship between adalimumab concentrations and the risk of adverse events is 
shown in Figure 20 for paediatric UC subjects and Figure 21 for paediatric CD subjects. In addition, 
data from previous adalimumab development programs in adults includes doses up to 10 mg/kg 
intravenous for 6 months and 3 mg/kg for up to 2 years, plus doubling of approved subcutaneous doses 
in multiple indications (RA, Ps and CD), showing a similar safety profile across doses and exposures.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
The PK and immunogenicity of adalimumab were evaluated in paediatric subjects with moderate to severe 
UC in a Phase 3 study (Study M11-290).  Population PK of adalimumab was also assessed in paediatric 
UC subjects using a non-linear mixed effects modelling approach. 
The pharmacokinetic results showed that the mean adalimumab concentrations were 24.0 μg/mL and 
17.2 μg/mL in subjects on high induction dose at Weeks 2 and 4, respectively, compared to 9.83 μg/mL 
and 10.5 μg/mL in subjects on standard induction dose. Starting from Week 26, the mean adalimumab 
steady-state concentrations reached approximately 15 - 17 μg/mL and 4 - 6 μg/mL for subjects on high 
maintenance dose and standard maintenance dose, respectively. 
The overall AAA+ rate was 3% (3/100) using the current ELISA AAA assay. In general, as previously 
identified, serum adalimumab concentrations were lower in AAA+ subjects compared to those in AAA– 
subjects.
A paediatric cross-indication population PK analysis was performed to describe PK in UC patients and 
other paediatric indications. The model was subsequently used to simulate exposure levels given the 
proposed flat dose posology. The final PK model was largely similar to a previous cross-indication popPK 
model, with the addition of different volume of distribution estimates for UC and CD populations. The 
visual predictive checks indicate that the variability for the UC patient population is over-estimated and 
hence simulated UC exposures can be expected to be somewhat higher than observed values. However, 
as this caveat would lead to a conservative decision, the popPK model is agreed by CHMP for this 
application.
The expected exposure levels are studied in previously approved dosing regimens for other Humira 
indications. When comparing the 40 mg ew and 80 mg eow regimens the main difference is that the 
fluctuations (i.e peak to trough concentration ratio) is larger for the 80 mg eow, however the average 
concentration is expected to be largely the same.
A concern was raised during the evaluation regarding the expected exposures for the most light-weight 
UC patients as the dosing strategy in the induction phase is considerably higher than other approved 
indications such as the pJIA for example. Hence, the MAH was asked to provide simulated exposure levels 
down to 15 kg. The MAH provided simulated exposure levels, with highlight on subjects >15 to ≤25 kg. It 
is noted that the expected exposure in the smallest children are exceeding previously accepted 
adalimumab exposure levels. For the most light-weight the flat-dose regimen will result in higher 
exposures, during maintenance treatment, than the dosing regimen used in the paediatric UC study. The 
80/40/40 eow dosing regimen in small children is the dosing regimen that would result in the highest 
exposures; those exposures have not previously been reached by any approved Humira dosing regimen. 
The 80 mg eow maintenance dosing regimen is approved (as an alternative dosing regimen) for CD 
patients from 6 years; however, as the largest deviation between the flat dosing from the body-weight 
dosing is apparent at the lowest body-weight, the proposed dosing regimen is not considered acceptable 
to CHMP under the age of 6 years. Therefore, the MAH agreed to restrict the indication for the use in 
children as of 6 years of age.
The MAH provided exposure simulations where a re-induction dose has been introduced during the 
maintenance phase to present the expected exposure levels after such dose. Similarly, the expected 
exposure subsequent a (flat-dose) re-induction dose exceeds previously accepted exposure levels for 
adalimumab, both in previous indications and in the present paediatric UC study. Hence, the 
recommendation of a re-induction dose was not supported by CHMP. Therefore, the MAH agreed to 
remove this claim from the SmPC (see also Discussion on clinical efficacy).  
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 43/136
 
 
Exposure-efficacy analyses were performed both for PMS (week 8) and FMS (week 52), as well as a 
longitudinal Markov analysis for PMS. For the exposure-response analyses, observed adalimumab 
concentrations were used and due to the sampling schedule, the exposure metric was Ctrough. For the 
logistic regression analysis at week 8, there was a clear trend with increasing probability of response with 
increasing exposure. In the FMS analysis, the confidence interval for the Slope parameter (i.e. drug 
effect) overlap zero, hence indicating that there is no relationship between adalimumab concentration and 
clinical remission at week 52. This relationship, however, is most likely diluted by the fact that only 
responders at week 8 are carried forward to the maintenance phase and as such a weak exposure-
response relationship is not unexpected at week 52. A continuous time Markov exposure-response model 
was developed, which take into account the time course of response with adalimumab treatment. Such 
modelling approach could have provided supportive information to describe the clinical response over 
time. However, the parameter estimates for the drug effect (Emax and EC50) are estimated with very 
high uncertainty and as such, using the model to distinguish between the ew and eow dosing regimens 
are not considered reliable by CHMP. Therefore, no conclusion can be made from this analysis.
Graphical analysis was presented for exposure-safety endpoints. The exposure-safety results from study 
M11-290 indicate that there is a trend of increasing rate of infections with increasing exposure, no other 
adverse events indicated a relationship with exposure. This behaviour was similar in the paediatric CD 
population, which also displayed a wider exposure range more comparable to the exposure range 
expected from the flat dose regimens proposed. The MAH has provided a summary of adalimumab 
exposure-safety across several paediatric indications (UC, JIA, Ps, and CD) and no trends of increasing 
AEs with increasing adalimumab concentration could be detected.
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
The PK and PK/PD has been sufficiently characterised in paediatric patients. The expected adalimumab 
exposure, given the proposed flat-dose regimen, has been accepted in previous indications of Humira in 
children 6 years and above. 
The initially proposed indication was for children 5 years and older. However, since the exposure levels in 
the smallest children exceeded studied exposure levels, the available data did not support dosing 
recommendations in children lower than 6 years of age. The indication was therefore restricted to children 
6 years and above. 
In addition, a re-induction dose was initially proposed in case of disease flare. However, the expected 
exposure subsequent a re-induction dose exceeded previously accepted exposure levels for adalimumab, 
the re-induction dose was therefore removed from the SmPC. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy
In this submission, the MAH seeks to add a new indication for Humira (adalimumab) for the treatment of 
paediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age with moderately to severely active UC. This application is 
supported by data from 2 Phase 3 clinical studies: 


a randomized, controlled study (Study M11-290) 
an open-label (OL) long-term study (Study M10-870) for subjects who participated in, and 
successfully completed, Study M11-290. Study M11-290 is a post-marketing commitment to the 
US FDA. This submission also aims to fulfil the agreed EU PIP (EMEA-000366-PIP02-09-M06, 
Decision P/0174/2019).
The indication and dose initially proposed in the application are:
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 44/136
 
 
Humira is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in paediatric 
patients (from 5 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including 
corticosteroids and/or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have 
medical contraindications for such therapies.
The proposed dosing regimen of adalimumab for patients from 5 to 17 years of age with UC is based on 
body weight.  For patients < 40 kg, the induction dose is 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, 
followed by a maintenance dose of 40 mg every other week (eow) starting at Week 4.  For patients ≥ 40 
kg, the induction dose is 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by a maintenance dose of 80 
mg eow starting at Week 4.  The maintenance doses of 40 mg eow and 80 mg eow are considered 
equivalent to 20 mg every week (ew) and 40 mg ew doses, respectively.  Continued therapy beyond 8 
weeks should be carefully considered in patients not showing signs of response within this time period.  
Patients who experience a disease flare after beginning maintenance therapy may benefit from a one-
time re-induction dose of 80 mg (< 40 kg) or 160 mg (≥ 40 kg), followed by maintenance dosing.
2.4.1.  Dose response study
No dedicated dose response studies were performed. Exposure-response relationships were evaluated 
based on the M11-290 data, further described in the PK/PD modelling section.
2.4.2.  Main studies
The MAH submitted two main studies; study M11-290 is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind 
(DB) trial. This study is part of the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) in the EU and a postmarketing 
commitment associated with the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) approval of the adult UC 
indication.  Study M10-870 is a Phase 3, multi-center, OL study designed to evaluate the long-term 
maintenance of clinical response, safety and tolerability of adalimumab in pediatric subjects with UC who 
participated in, and successfully completed, Protocol M11-290 through Week 52.  
Since there were issues in recruitment of paediatric patients with UC in Study M11-290, major changes to 
the protocol were made during the study, these changes were agreed by PDCO and implemented as 
agreed modifications to the PIP (
Table 11).
Table 11 PIP modifications regarding Study M11-290 are summarized in the table below.

Study M11-290: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind Study of the Human 
Anti-TNF Monoclonal Antibody Adalimumab in Pediatric Subjects with 
Moderate to Severe Ulcerative Colitis
Methods
Study M11-290 is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double blind (DB) trial designed to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of adalimumab in paediatric subjects with moderate to severe UC who have failed 
therapy with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant (IMM).
A sub-study conducted in Japanese patients, results from this sub-study were not included in the 
submitted analysis.
Prior to Amendment 4, enrolled subjects were randomized 3:2 at Baseline to 1 of 2 DB adalimumab 
induction doses, induction high dose (I-HD) or induction standard dose (I-SD). At Week 8, subjects 
demonstrating a clinical response per Partial Mayo Score (PMS) are randomized to the following groups in 
a 2:2:1 ratio:  adalimumab maintenance standard dose (M-SD), adalimumab maintenance high dose (M-
HD), or placebo. Subjects continue their blinded treatment during the maintenance period until Week 52.
After Amendment 4, enrolled subjects receive adalimumab induction high dose open-label (I-HD-OL).  
At Week 8, subjects demonstrating a clinical response per PMS are randomized and stratified by Week 8 
remission status per PMS in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 adalimumab maintenance treatment groups, M-SD or M-
HD. Subjects continue their blinded treatment during the maintenance period until Week 52
Prior to Amendment 4, internal placebo was chosen as the control group during maintenance period.  
Over the course of study, there were significant recruitment difficulties (the primary reason being 
objection to the placebo group in the maintenance period) despite efforts to reduce subject burden and 
study complexity. As a result, after Amendment 4, per agreement with the regulatory agencies, 
randomization to the internal placebo group was ceased, and external placebo derived from a meta-
analysis of placebo-controlled studies in adult subjects with moderate to severe UC who had failed

conventional therapy was used as comparator for the confirmatory analysis of co-primary and ranked 
secondary efficacy endpoints instead.
The duration of the study is up to 66 weeks, which includes a screening period of up to 28 days, an 8-
week induction period and a 44-week DB maintenance period and a 70-day follow-up phone call.  Upon 
completion of the study, subjects were to have the option to enrol into an OLE study (Study M10-870 
Main) where they were to continue to receive OL adalimumab.

Flares
Criteria for disease flare were as follows:
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 47/136
 
 



Subjects with a Week 8 PMS of 0 to 2 who presented with a PMS at least 3 points greater than 
their Week 8 score.
Subjects with a Week 8 PMS of 3 to 4 who presented with a PMS at least 2 points greater than 
their Week 8 score.
Subjects with a Week 8 PMS of 5 to 6 who presented with a PMS at least 1 point greater than 
their Week 8 score. 
Subjects were expected to remain on blinded therapy throughout the 44-week maintenance period.  
However, subjects with a disease flare could be re-randomized to receive the following blinded treatment 
at or after Week 12:
Subjects who were randomized to M-SD were to be re-randomized to receive either adalimumab re-
induction dose (2.4 mg/kg [maximum of 160 mg]) or adalimumab (0.6mg/kg [maximum of 40 mg]) at 
the visit. Afterwards, all subjects were to resume receiving the standard dose (adalimumab 0.6 mg/kg 
[maximum of 40mg] eow) within the original dosing schedule.
Subjects who were randomized to M-HD were to be re-randomized to receive either adalimumab re-
induction dose (2.4 mg/kg [maximum of 160 mg]) or adalimumab (0.6mg/kg [maximum of 40 mg]) at 
the visit. The following week, all subjects were to resume receiving the high dose (adalimumab 0.6 mg/kg 
[maximum of 40 mg] ew) within the original dosing schedule.
Subjects who were randomized to placebo prior to Amendment 4 were to be re-randomized to receive 
either adalimumab re-induction dose (adalimumab 2.4 mg/kg [maximum of 160 mg]) or to receive 
adalimumab (0.6 mg/kg [maximum of 40mg]) at the visit.  Afterwards, all subjects were to receive the 
standard dose (adalimumab 0.6mg/kg [maximum of 40 mg] eow) within the original dosing schedule
If a subject continued to meet the definition of disease flare (2nd time) following at least a 4-week course 
of blinded therapy since the subject had been re-randomized for the disease flare, they could have been 
switched to OL adalimumab ew at 0.6 mg/kg [maximum of 40 mg].  If a subject was re-randomized at 
Week 12 to receive either re-induction dose (adalimumab 2.4 mg/kg [maximum of 160 mg]) or to receive 
adalimumab (0.6 mg/kg [maximum of 40mg]), then the earliest that subject could have been evaluated 
to determine if they meet the criteria for disease flare for switch to OL (adalimumab 0.6 mg/kg 
[maximum of 40 mg]) weekly dosing was at Week 16.
If a subject continued to meet the definition of disease flare (3rd time) following a 4-week course of OL 
adalimumab ew at 0.6mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg), they could have been switched to receive 
adalimumab OL 40 mg ew (maximum dose, not weight-based). Subjects with persistent disease flare 
while on adalimumab 40 mg ew (maximum dose) could have been withdrawn from the study at the 
investigator's discretion. During OL rescue therapy, subjects who were responders and had been in 
remission for at least 8 consecutive weeks may have had their dosage decreased from ew to eow.  If 
subjects demonstrated disease flare after dose de-escalation, subjects also had an opportunity to re-
escalate their dose back to adalimumab ew dosing
External placebo group
In order to derive robust external placebo assumptions for the co-primary and ranked secondary 
endpoints, a thorough literature search of placebo-controlled clinical studies in subjects with moderate to 
severe UC who had failed conventional therapy was performed.  Studies M06-826 and M06-827 in adults 
were the only available data sources with PMS data at Week 8.  Studies GEMINI 1 and OCTAVE Sustain in 
adults were the only studies with a similar subject population (i.e. failure or intolerance to prior 
corticosteroids or IMMs), study design (i.e. randomized withdrawal), and endpoint definitions for 
derivation of external placebo rates for the Week 52 endpoints in Study M11-290.

Study participants
Paediatric subjects with moderate to severe UC (Mayo score of 6 to 12 points and endoscopy sub score of 
2 to 3) from 4 to less than 18 years old, who have failed therapy with corticosteroids and/or 
immunosuppressant (IMM) and meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were 
eligible for enrolment.
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion
Main Inclusion
1. Subjects from the ages of 4 to 17 prior to baseline dosing.
2. Subjects with a diagnosis of UC for at least 12 weeks prior to screening confirmed by endoscopy with 
biopsy. A colonoscopy will be performed during the screening period unless the subject underwent a 
colonoscopy within 12 months prior to Screening and appropriate documentation is available (to confirm 
the diagnosis without evidence of dysplasia, colon cancer or infection). In this case the screening 
endoscopy may be either a colonoscopy or a flexible sigmoidoscopy. If the subject underwent an 
endoscopy within 56 days of Baseline, and a video recording of the endoscopy is available, the video 
recording may be used and no additional endoscopy be performed during the Screening period. If no 
appropriate documentation for confirmation of the diagnosis is available as per the investigator's 
judgment a diagnostic biopsy must also be performed. Biopsies to rule out dysplasia, colon cancer and 
infection may be taken at the investigator's discretion.
3. Active ulcerative colitis with a Mayo Score of 6 – 12 points and endoscopy subscore of 2 – 3 (confirmed 
by central reader) despite concurrent treatment with at least one of the following (oral corticosteroids or 
immunosuppressants or both as defined below):

≥ 3 mg/day, but not exceeding 9 mg/day, with a stable dose for at least 7 days prior to 
Baseline; and/or  

At least a consecutive 28-day course of azathioprine or 6-MP or methotrexate (MTX) prior to 
Baseline, with a stable dose prior to Baseline of azathioprine ≥ 1.5 mg/kg/day or 6-MP ≥ 1 
mg/kg/day (rounded to the nearest available tablet or half tablet formulation) or a documented 
6-TGN level of 230 – 450 pmol/8 × 108 RBC on the current dosing regimen or MTX ≥ 15mg/m2 
body surface area/week, or a dose that is the highest tolerated by the subject (e.g., due to 
leukopenia, elevated liver enzymes, nausea) during that time.
Note:  If subjects are on both oral corticosteroid and immunosuppressants BOTH of the drugs 
need to meet the above criteria; and/or

Table 12 Definitions of Key Efficacy Endpoints
Sample size
Originally planned sample size:
Table 13 Sample size based on Week 8 and Week 52 co-Primary Endpoints
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 54/136
 
 
Changes to the sample size calculation: 
The sample size was changed in amendment 5 to 93 patients in total. The ordering of the secondary 
endpoints was changed. A 48% remission rate per PMS at Week 8 for the combined standard and high 
adalimumab induction dose groups was assumed. A 52% remission rate per PMS at Week 8 for the high 
adalimumab induction dose group was assumed.
Randomisation
Subjects were initially to be randomized 3:2 between standard induction dose or high induction dose.   At 
Week 8, subjects demonstrating a clinical response were to be re-randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to 
adalimumab maintenance standard dose, adalimumab maintenance high dose or placebo, respectively. 
The randomization was stratified by Week 8 remission status per PMS (defined as a PMS ≤ 2 and no 
individual subscore > 1) and induction dose.
Randomization to DB induction treatment was discontinued and open-label high induction dose was 
instead used for all subsequently enrolled subjects after amendment 4. Randomization to the internal 
placebo arm from the maintenance period was discontinued after amendment 4. 
Blinding (masking)
Subjects were to continue their blinded treatment during the maintenance period until Week 52.
All AbbVie personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the trial (with the exception 
of AbbVie Drug Supply Management Team) the Investigator, study site personnel and the subject were to 
remain blinded to each subject's treatment throughout the blinded period of the study. The IVRS/IWRS 
was to provide access to blinded subject treatment information in the case of medical emergency.

Statistical methods
Analysis methods
Efficacy analyses are performed on the ITT population for the Week 8 efficacy endpoints and on the mITT 
population for the Week 52 efficacy endpoints, unless otherwise noted. Testing of the co-primary and 
ranked secondary endpoints were to be done on the ITT-E (for Week 8 efficacy endpoints) and mITT-E 
population (for Week 52 efficacy endpoints). Endpoints that are of the binary type were to be analyzed as 
proportions by treatment group including 95% CIs. Endpoints that are of the continuous type were to be 
analyzed as changes from baseline and reported by treatment group including 95% CIs. 
Analysis sets 
Seven study populations will be used for analyses in this study. These are:
Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population: The ITT population includes all subjects who received at least one 
dose of the study medication during induction period. ITT subjects were to be analyzed as 
randomized/enrolled.
ITT-E population: The ITT-E population was to be a subpopulation of the ITT population, where subjects 
who have received open-label high induction dose are excluded. The ITT-E is the primary population for 
the confirmatory induction period efficacy analyses.
Modified ITT (mITT) population: The mITT population consists of all Week 8 PMS responders who 
were randomized at Week 8 and received at least one dose of the study medication during maintenance 
period. mITT subjects were to be analyzed as randomized at the beginning of maintenance phase.
mITT-E population: The mITT-E population was to be a subpopulation of the mITT population, where 
subjects who have received Placebo are excluded. The mITT-E is the primary population for the 
confirmatory maintenance period efficacy analyses.
Re-Randomized (RR) population: Consists of all subjects who were re-randomized due to a disease 
flare and received at least one dose of the study medication after the rerandomization. RR subjects will be 
analyzed as randomized at the beginning of maintenance phase.
Safety population: Includes all subjects who received at least one dose of the study drug. The safety 
population was to be analyzed (separately for induction and maintenance phase) as treated, according to 
treatment the subject actually received. The safety population was to be used for safety analyses.
Per Protocol (PP) populations: The PP populations was only to be used for sensitivity analyses of the 
co-primary and ranked secondary endpoints.
External Placebo Control
In order to derive external placebo assumptions for the co-primary and ranked secondary endpoints, a 
literature search of placebo-controlled clinical studies in subjects with moderate to severe UC who had 
failed conventional therapy was performed.
Studies M06-826 and M06-827 in adults were the only available data sources with PMS data at Week 8. 
Studies GEMINI 1 and OCTAVE Sustain in adults were the only studies with a similar subject population 
(i.e., failure or intolerance to prior corticosteroids or IMMs), study design (i.e., randomized withdrawal), 
and endpoint definitions for derivation of external placebo rates for the Week 52 endpoints in Study M11-
290.
For all co-primary and ranked secondary endpoints where available, separate estimates for anti-TNF naïve 
placebo patients and anti-TNF experienced placebo patients were derived. The estimates for anti-TNF 
naïve placebo patients and anti-TNF experienced placebo patients were then combined as a weighted 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 56/136
 
 
mean according to the assumed proportion of anti-TNF naïve and experienced subjects as per the Study 
M11-290 protocol, i.e., 0.75 × rate in anti-TNF naïve + 0.25 × rate in anti TNF experienced subjects. 
Missing data
Missing Data Handling
In general, missing Baseline and safety data were not imputed.
Baseline Value is Missing:
Subjects were excluded from analysis of change from Baseline if Baseline evaluation is missing.
Missing Efficacy and Outcome Evaluations:
Missing values was only to be imputed for study periods which a subject has actually entered, e.g., if a 
subject is a non-responder at Week 8 and thus discontinues from the study after induction period, this 
subject's missing data would only be imputed up to Week 8.
Non-responder Imputation (NRI): The NRI approach is used for all binary efficacy
variables. These variables can take values of 'Response' (i.e., response, remission or mucosal healing) or 
'Non-response' (i.e., non-response, non-remission or no mucosal healing) or may be missing for any 
reason including discontinuation from study. According to the NRI method all missing values were 
considered as 'Non-Response'. Subjects re-randomized due to disease flare were considered as 'Non-
Responders' at and after their 1st re-randomization. The confirmatory efficacy analyses used NRI 
approach to impute the missing values. Additionally, only for sensitivity analyses on the mITT population, 
a modified NRI (mNRI) approach to impute the missing values was used. For mNRI method, subjects 
re-randomized due to disease flare were considered as 'Non-Responders' at and after the switch to the 
open-label therapy (2nd disease flare).
Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF): 
For categorical and continuous efficacy variables the following rules was used for LOCF approach:

Baseline and pre-baseline values were not to be used to impute the missing post-baseline values, 
and
 Missing values after baseline were to be imputed using the last non-missing values after baseline 

and prior to the missing value.
For subjects who were re-randomized due to disease flare, the last non-missing value before or at 
the re-randomization after 1st disease flare were carried forward.
The LOCF analysis was performed as sensitivity analysis.
For patients with disease flare and at least one non-missing post-Baseline endoscopy, last observation 
carried forward (LOCF) rules were refined to carry forward the last non-missing PMS prior to disease flare 
combined with the last non-missing post-Baseline prior to disease flare or the Baseline endoscopy 
subscore if the only non-missing post-Baseline endoscopy was after disease flare for the calculation of 
Mayo Score at Week 52.
Observed Cases (OC): Observed case analysis was performed on data until 1st re-randomization of 
subjects with a disease flare as a sensitivity analysis.
Multiple Imputation (MI): Visits were imputed in order, where later visits were imputed based upon all 
previous visits, baseline, treatment group, demographics and other key baseline characteristics. Subjects 
who discontinued due to lack of efficacy or received rescue medication were forced in as non-responders. 
The MI analysis was performed as sensitivity analysis.
A description of how Missing Items on Questionnaire Scales was handled was also provided in the SAP.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 57/136
 
 
Other sensitivity analyses of interest
In order to utilize the 12 internal placebo subjects' data, a sensitivity analysis of the second co-primary 
endpoint was performed in R using Bayesian borrowing.  After deriving informative prior distributions for 
clinical remission rates at Week 52 from historical data for adalimumab and for placebo subjects, 
posterior probabilities for the difference between adalimumab and placebo subjects in clinical remission 
rates were calculated considering prior anti-TNF experience. 
Subgroup analyses 
The subgroups listed below were used for the analyses of co-primary and ranked secondary endpoints 
including calculation of 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
● Sex (male, female)
● Age (< 13 years, ≥ 13 years)
● Ethnicity (white, non-white)
● Geographic region (North America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe)
● Disease severity per Baseline Mayo Score (≤ 9, > 9)
● Prior exposure to anti-TNF (yes, no)
● Baseline systemic corticosteroid use (yes, no)
● Baseline IMM use (yes, no)
● Weight (< 40 kg, ≥ 40 kg)
● Pancolitis (yes, no)
● Disease duration (≤ Baseline-median, > Baseline-median)
● Baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (≤ Baseline-median, > Baseline-median)
● Fecal calprotectin (≤ Baseline-median, > Baseline-median)
● Induction treatment group (I-HD, I-SD, I-HD-OL) [only for Mayo clinical Remission at Week 52 in the 
mITT population]
● Week 8 remission status per PMS (yes, no) [only for Mayo clinical remissionat Week 52 in the mITT 
population]
Multiplicity
In the co-primary and ranked secondary endpoints adalimumab dose groups were tested against external 
placebo in a sequentially rejective multiple test procedure with a familywise type I error of 5%.
A graphical presentation of the multiple testing procedure was provided in the SAP.
Interim analyses
Interim analyses were not planned or performed. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) 
was established for the study to independently monitor and assess safety and primary efficacy data from 
the study. No changes to the study were requested by the IDMC.
Changes to the statistical analysis
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020

The study has been subjected to major changes (amendments 4 and 5), including ceasing randomization 
to DB induction treatment and switching to open-label high induction dose for all subsequently enrolled 
subjects, as well as ceasing randomization to the internal placebo arm from the maintenance period, 
reducing the number of planned subjects, and modifying study endpoints and statistical analyses 
accordingly.
A description of the timing of amendments and the study status at each change was provided in appendix 
A in the overview. Part of this table is presented below. In the complete table subjects are also reported

Baseline data
The MAH states that subject demographic characteristics were generally balanced between treatment 
groups during Induction and Maintenance.  Evaluating across treatment groups, the subject population 
was predominantly in the categories of ≥ 13 years and ≥ 12 years, White, in Eastern Europe, had no 
prior exposure to anti-TNF, and had Baseline IMM use. Baseline disease characteristics were generally 
balanced between treatment groups and consistent with a paediatric subject population with moderate to 
severe UC.

Outcomes and estimation
The first co-primary endpoint of clinical remission per PMS (defined as ≤ 2 and no individual subscore > 
1) at Week 8 was achieved by 59.6% of subjects randomized to the adalimumab I-HD group and 43.3% 
of subjects randomized to the I-SD group (NRI) (Table 22). A statistically significantly greater proportion 
of subjects in the combined adalimumab I-HD and I-SD group as well as the I-HD group achieved clinical 
remission as measured by PMS at Week 8 compared with the external placebo control. A high proportion 
of subjects in the adalimumab I-HD-OL group (11/16 [68.8%]) also achieved clinical remission as 
measured by PMS at Week 8.
The second co-primary endpoint clinical remission per Mayo Score (defined as a Mayo Score ≤ 2 and no 
individual subscore > 1) at Week 52 in PMS responders at Week 8 was achieved by 45.2% of subjects in

the adalimumab M-HD group and 29.0% of subjects in the M-SD group (NRI) (Table 22). A statistically 
significantly greater proportion of subjects in the combined adalimumab M-HD and M-SD group as well as 
M-HD group who were Week 8 responders per PMS achieved clinical remission as measured by Mayo 
Score at Week 52 compared with the external placebo control. Four of 12 subjects (33.3%) in the M-PL 
group who were Week 8 responders per PMS achieved clinical remission as measured by Mayo Score at 
Week 52.

Other outcomes
When the original protocol for Study M11-290 was finalized in 2013, the primary endpoint definitions 
were aligned with the requirements from all relevant regulatory agencies and the scientific community.  
European Medicines Agency's recently updated "Guideline on the Development of New Medicinal Products 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

for the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis" as of 2018, which mainly focuses on studies in adults, now 
requests cessation of rectal bleeding for the definition of remission. Although the pre-specified and 
previously agreed upon primary endpoint definitions in Study M11-290 do not specifically entail a RBS of 
0, the available efficacy results provide evidence of clinically meaningful improvement of RBS over time. 
At Week 8 RBS improved from Baseline by 0.86 and 1.07 points in subjects on the I-SD and I-HD dose 
regimens, respectively. In addition, at Week 52, RBS improved from Baseline by 1.48 and 1.36 points in 
subjects on the M-SD and M-HD doses, respectively. Furthermore, RBS data corroborated the clinical 
remission rates per PMS at Week 8 and per FMS at Week 52.
Clinical remission per PUCAI at Week 8 was achieved by 46.8% and 33.3% of subjects in the adalimumab 
I-HD and I-SD groups, respectively.  PUCAI response at Week 52 in Week 8 PMS responders was 
achieved by 51.6% and 58.1% of subjects in the adalimumab M-HD and M-SD groups, respectively. 
PUCAI remission at Week 52 in Week 8 PMS responders was reported by 58.1% and 45.2% of subjects in 
the adalimumab M-HD and M-SD groups, respectively.  Corticosteroid-free PUCAI clinical remission at 
Week 52 in subjects receiving corticosteroids at Baseline and Week 8 PMS responders was reported by 
43.8% and 38.5% of subjects in the adalimumab M-HD and M-SD groups, respectively.
Overall, these clinical outcomes were accompanied by UC-related hospitalization rates of < 20% and very 
low colectomy rates (1.1%) in the adalimumab-treated subjects.  The QOL for the adalimumab-treated 
subjects as well as work productivity and activity impairment for their caregivers also showed clinically 
meaningful improvements as early as Week 8 compared to Baseline during the study as measured by 
IMPACT III and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI).
Clinically meaningful improvement in height velocity was reported for subjects who received either of the 
adalimumab maintenance doses through the study. While subjects demonstrated some evidence of 
reduced linear growth rate at Baseline (mean z-score of –0.843), subjects experienced an increase of 
height velocity subsequent to adalimumab treatment by a change from baseline in mean z score of 0.798 
and 1.154 at Weeks 26 and 52, respectively. Clinically relevant improvement in body mass index at 
Weeks 26 and 52 was achieved by subjects who received the adalimumab high maintenance dose as a 
change from Baseline of 0.490 mg/kg2 and 0.566 mg/kg2, respectively.
Re-Induction Following Disease Flare
Among adalimumab-treated subjects who experienced their first disease flare during Maintenance, little to 
no difference was observed in the proportion of subjects with clinical response and clinical remission per 
FMS at Week 52 in Week 8 responders per PMS with re-induction dose compared to without re-induction 
dose, although a numerically greater proportion of subjects who received a re-induction dose (33.3%) 
demonstrated clinical response at Week 52 compared to subjects without re-induction (22.2%).  
However, the number of subjects for each subgroup is too small to be conclusive.

Ancillary analyses
For the subgroup analysis, a higher proportion of prior anti-TNF naïve subjects achieved the co-primary 
efficacy endpoints compared to subjects with prior anti-TNF. When analysing subgroups by geographic 
regions, a higher proportion of subjects in Eastern Europe achieved the co-primary efficacy endpoints 
compared to subjects in North America and Western Europe; however, the number of subjects for the 
Western countries subgroups are too small to be conclusive.
Study M10-870: A Multi-Center, Open-Label Study of the Human Anti-TNF 
Monoclonal Antibody Adalimumab to Evaluate Long-Term Safety and 
Tolerability of Repeated Administration of Adalimumab in Paediatric Subjects 
with Ulcerative Colitis Who Completed the Study M11-290
Methods
Study M10-870 is a Phase 3, multi-centre, OL study designed to evaluate the long-term maintenance of 
clinical response, safety and tolerability of adalimumab in paediatric subjects with UC.
All subjects receive OL therapy beginning at the baseline visit (Week 52 visit from the Study M11-290) as 
follows:


Subjects who enrolled into the study from blinded treatment in Study M11-290 receive OL 
adalimumab 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every other week (eow).
Subjects who received OL adalimumab in Study M11-290 maintain the same dose in Study M10-
870.
The duration of the study is up to 298 weeks, which includes a 288-week OL maintenance period and a 
70-day follow-up phone call. The submitted clinical study report (CSR) is an interim report for Study M10-
870 with a data cut-off date of 28 August 2019 and covers the Main Study, which includes all subjects 
enrolled outside of Japan. A separate interim CSR is being prepared for the Japan Substudy, which 
includes only the subjects enrolled at sites in Japan.
Study participants
Paediatric subjects with UC who participated in, and successfully completed, Protocol M11-290 through 
Week 52 were eligible to enrol as long as they met all of the Study M10-870 inclusion criteria and none of 
the exclusion criteria.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 77/136
 
 
Key eligibility criteria for Study M10-870 included: subject must have successfully enrolled in and 
completed Protocol M11-290 through Week 52; and the subject is judged to be in good medical condition, 
as determined by the Principal Investigator based upon results of clinical and laboratory evaluations done 
throughout the preceding ulcerative colitis Study M11-290.
Key exclusion criteria for Study M10-870 included:  subject is considered by the Investigator, for any 
reason, to be an unsuitable candidate for continuing therapy in the Study M10-870; subject with Crohn's 
disease or indeterminate colitis; subject who is planning surgical bowel resection at any time point while 
enrolled in the study; known hypersensitivity to adalimumab or its excipients; or current diagnosis of 
fulminant colitis and/or toxic megacolon.
Treatments
All subjects received open-label therapy as follows beginning at the Baseline Visit in Study M10-870:  
subjects who enrolled into the study from blinded treatment in Study M11-290 received open label 0.6 
mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) eow of adalimumab; or subjects who received open label adalimumab in 
Study M11-290 maintained the same dose in Study M10-870. Subjects who experienced disease flare 
received either of the following:  subjects who were on 0.6 mg/kg (maximum dose of 40 mg, weight 
based) eow of adalimumab could receive 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40mg, weight based) every week (ew); 
or subjects who were on 0.6 mg/kg ew of adalimumab could receive 40 mg ew (maximum dose) of 
adalimumab.
The duration of Treatment was up to 288 weeks of OL treatment.
Objectives
The objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and maintenance of clinical 
response, of repeated administration of adalimumab in paediatric subjects with UC who participated in, 
and successfully completed, Protocol M11-290 through Week 52.

Table 25 Subject Disposition (FAS)
Recruitment
A total of 55 subjects were enrolled and randomized at 11 sites in Poland, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, 
and the US. 
The first subjects started the study in November 2015; as of the cut-off date of 28 August 2019, no 
subjects completed the study as the study was still ongoing. 
A total of 3 subjects received adalimumab 0.6 mg/kg (maximum dose of 40mg) ew (hereafter referred to 
as the ew dose) at Baseline and 52 subjects received adalimumab 0.6 mg/kg (maximum dose of 40 mg) 
eow (hereafter referred to as the eow dose) at Baseline. 
Of these subjects, 18 subjects had at least 1 dose escalation from the eow dose to the ew dose; no 
subjects had dose de-escalation from the ew dose to the eow dose; and no subjects had dose re-
escalation from the eow dose to the ew dose.  
The rate of discontinuation was 25.5%. The primary reason for discontinuation reported by most subjects 
was lack of efficacy.

Table 26 Protocol Deviations (FAS)
Baseline data
At Baseline for Study M10-870, the majority of subjects were white (94.5%) and female (54.5%) with an 
overall mean age of 14.7 years. At Baseline, subjects had a mean duration of UC of 3.6 years. Baseline 
characteristics for subjects in Study M10-870 Main were generally consistent with inactive or mild UC 
disease (mean Mayo score 2.1, mean PMS 1.2) after these subjects had been treated with adalimumab 
for up to 52 weeks in Study M11-290 prior to entering Study M10-870.
Outcomes and estimation
Clinical remission and response per PMS (Table 27) and PUCAI (CI = confidence interval; FAS = full analysis set; LOCF = last 
observation carried forward
Note:
Clinical remission per Partial Mayo Score was defined as PMS ≤ 2 and no individual subscore > 1.
Baseline is defined as the last non-missing value before the baseline visit date (i.e., at or before the Week 52 visit form Study M11-
290 Main) and prior to the first dose of Study M10-870 Main.
Last observation carried forward:  Missing data was imputed by carrying forward the last non-missing post-baseline observation.  For 
interim analyses, missing values was imputed up to the timepoint a patient could have potentially reached at the data cutoff for 
analyses.
Due to the ongoing status of the study, not all subjects could have reached each study timepoint, therefore the overall N decreases.

Table 28) seemed sustained for subjects receiving adalimumab through Week 168. 
As the study is ongoing, the number of subjects at each timepoint decreased over time, making 
conclusions at later timepoints less robust. 
The quality of life of subjects receiving adalimumab and the work productivity of their caregivers seem to 
be sustained as measured by IMPACT III and WPAI assessments from Baseline through Weeks 120 and 
72, respectively.

Activity Index
Note:
PUCAI clinical remission was defined as a total PUCAI score < 10.
Baseline is defined as the last non-missing value before the baseline visit date (i.e., at or before the Week 52 visit form Study M11-
290 Main) and prior to the first dose of Study M10-870 Main.
Last observation carried forward:  Missing data was imputed by carrying forward the last non-missing post-baseline observation.  For 
interim analyses, missing values was imputed up to the timepoint a patient could have potentially reached at the data cutoff for 
analyses.
Due to the ongoing status of the study, not all subjects could have reached each study timepoint, therefore the overall N decreases.

Title: A Multicenter, Randomised, Double-Blind Study of the Human Anti-TNF Monoclonal 
Antibody Adalimumab in Pediatric Subjects with Moderate to Severe Ulcerative Colitis
Study identifier
M11-290 (EudraCT Number: 2013-003032-77) Main Study
Design
Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind (DB) trial designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety, and to assess the pharmacokinetics of 
subcutaneously administered adalimumab in paediatric subjects aged 4 to 
less than 18 years with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC; defined as 
a Mayo Score of 6 to 12 points and endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3), who have 
failed therapy with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant.
Prior to protocol Amendment 4, enrolled subjects were randomised 3:2 at 
baseline to 1 of 2 DB adalimumab induction doses, induction high dose 
(I-HD) or induction standard dose (I-SD).  Randomisation was stratified by 
baseline disease severity (Mayo Score ≤ 9, > 9), prior exposure to anti-TNF 
(infliximab), and corticosteroid use at baseline.  After Amendment 4, enrolled 
subjects received adalimumab induction high dose open label (I-HD-OL). 
Ongoing subjects randomized prior to Amendment 4 continued their blinded 
treatment during the induction period until Week 8. 
Prior to protocol Amendment 4, subjects demonstrating a clinical response 
per Partial Mayo Score (PMS; defined as a decrease in PMS ≥ 2 points and 
≥ 30% from baseline) at Week 8 were stratified by Week 8 remission status 
per PMS (remission defined as a PMS ≤ 2 and no individual subscore > 1) 
and induction dose, then randomised in a 2:2:1 ratio to adalimumab 
maintenance standard dose (M-SD), adalimumab maintenance high dose 
(M-HD), or placebo (M-PL).  After Amendment 4, subjects demonstrating a 
clinical response per PMS at Week 8 were stratified by Week 8 remission 
status per PMS and randomised in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 adalimumab 
maintenance treatment groups, M-SD or M-HD.  Subjects continued their 
blinded treatment during the maintenance period until Week 52 unless they 
experienced ≥ 2 disease flares and received open label rescue therapy after 
the second flare.
Prior to protocol Amendment 4, internal placebo was chosen as the control 
group during the maintenance period per regulatory requirement.  After 
Amendment 4, in agreement with the regulatory agencies, randomisation to 
the internal placebo group was ceased, and external placebo rates were used 
as comparators for co-primary and ranked secondary efficacy endpoints 
instead.  The external placebo rates were identified from a meta-analysis of 
relevant publicly available clinical trials.

Hypothesis
Superiority: 
For co-primary induction endpoint:  I-SD + I-HD vs external placebo rate; 
I-HD vs external placebo rate; and I-SD vs external placebo rate
For maintenance endpoints: M-SD + M-HD vs external placebo rate; M-HD vs 
external placebo rate; and M-SD vs external placebo rate.

of the mITT population (all Week 8 responders per PMS who were 
randomised at Week 8 and received at least one dose of study medication 
during the maintenance period; n=74), where subjects who received placebo 
(n = 12) were excluded. One subject who was erroneously randomised to the 
M-HD treatment group had received a maintenance dose but was not a 
responder at Week 8. This subject was excluded from the mITT-E population 
per definition but was included in the safety population.

Notes

b Adjusted P values from a sequentially rejective multiple test procedure, 
testing co-primary and ranked secondary endpoints first for I-SD/I-HD 
combined and then for individual adalimumab dose groups against the 
respective external placebo rate, controlling familywise Type I error of 5% 
in a strong sense. 
c External placebo rates for statistical comparisons (upper limit of 95% CI of 
point estimates from meta-analysis).
Note:  Non-responder imputation (NRI) method was used to impute missing 
values for binary efficacy endpoints. Missing data was imputed as not having 
met the endpoint.  Subjects re-randomized due to disease flare were 
considered as not having met the endpoint at and after their 1st disease 
flare.
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)
Analyses on integrated efficacy data from Studies M11-290 and M10-870 prespecified in the SAP have 
been presented. The adalimumab set for efficacy (“ADA set – E”) consists of 63 subjects who received at 
least 1 dose of adalimumab during the maintenance period of Study M11-290 and who were not 
randomized to placebo during the maintenance period (
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 89/136
 
 
Table 29). Among the ADA set – E, a total of 53 subjects completed Study M11-290, and of those, 48 
subjects enrolled in the ongoing Study M10-870. As of the data cut-off date of 28 August 2019, 36 
subjects are ongoing in Study M10-870 in the ADA set – E and none has completed as the study is 
ongoing. A total of 22 subjects discontinued adalimumab in the ADA set – E, and most were due to the 
primary reason of lack of efficacy (14 subjects). Similar trends were observed in the re-randomised with 
re-induction analysis set for efficacy (“RR with Re-Ind Set – E”) though the number of subjects in that 
analysis set are too small to be conclusive.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
Design and conduct of clinical studies
In this submission, the MAH initially sought a new indication for Humira (adalimumab) for the treatment 
of paediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age with moderately to severely active UC. This application is 
supported by data from 2 Phase 3 clinical studies: a randomized, controlled study (Study M11-290) and 
an open-label (OL) long-term study (Study M10-870) for subjects who participated in, and successfully 
completed, Study M11-290. Study M11-290 is a post-marketing commitment to the US FDA. This 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 93/136
 
 
submission also aims to fulfill the agreed European Union (EU) Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) (EMEA-
000366-PIP02-09-M06, Decision P/0174/2019). 
Study M11-290 is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, DB trial with an 8 week- induction period 
followed by a 44 weeks maintenance period. It was initially planned as an induction-
maintenance/withdrawal study with a placebo part but due to recruitment problems, several changes 
were done during the study and this was discussed and accepted by EMA/PDCO/FDA. The major changes 
affecting the study design were implemented in amendment 4 and therefore the study design is 
presented before and after amendment 4. 
Before amendment 4, the study participants were randomised (3:2) to receive either an induction high 
dose (I-HD) or an induction standard dose (I-SD). At week 8, subjects demonstrating a clinical response 
per Partial Mayo Score (PMS) were re-randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive either maintenance standard 
dose (M-SD), maintenance high dose (M-HD) or maintenance placebo dose (M-PL).
After amendment 4, the lower dose in the induction phase (i.e. the I-SD part) was omitted. Instead, all 
patients received open label high dose induction dose (I-HD-OL). In addition, at week 8, the re-
randomisation of patients to a placebo group was ceased and subjects demonstrating a clinical response 
per PMS were instead re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either M-SD or M-HD. 
Two different induction regimens were studied: High dose (I-HD): adalimumab 2.4 mg/kg (maximum 
dose of 160 mg) at Baseline and at Week 1 or Standard dose (I-SD): adalimumab 2.4 mg/kg (maximum 
dose of 160 mg) at Baseline and matching placebo at Week 1. Both doses were followed by 1.2 mg/kg 
(maximum dose of 80 mg) at Week 2, followed by 0.6 mg/kg (maximum dose of 40 mg) at Week 4 and 
Week 6.
Two different maintenance regimens were studied (from week 8 and onwards): Standard dose (M-SD): 
Adalimumab 0.6 mg/kg (maximum dose of 40 mg) every other week (eow) or High dose (M-HD): 
Adalimumab 0.6 mg/kg (maximum dose of 40 mg) every week (ew). The study was not designed to 
compare the two different doses used, neither for induction therapy nor for maintenance therapy.
Subjects were to continue their blinded treatment during the maintenance period until week 52. In case 
of disease flare (defined in three different ways depending on the received PMS score at week 8) the 
patients were randomized to receive a bolus dose of adalimumab either 2.4 mg/kg (or maximum 160 mg) 
or 0.6 mg/kg (or maximum 40 mg). Thereafter, the patients returned to their original treatment, with 
exception for the placebo group, who received M-SD treatment.  
The study is divided in an induction phase and a maintenance phase. This is in line with the EMA guideline 
(CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Rev.1) which states that “combined trial designs for induction and maintenance 
of remission can be accepted. Nevertheless, the design has to be adapted to allow interpretation of 
results in both phases and an element of dose-comparison may be built into a maintenance phase 
considering that the dose may not be the same for achieving as for maintaining remission. Dose-finding 
aspects in long-term treatment should be addressed”.
Since recruitment to the internal placebo group was ceased after amendment 4, the presented efficacy 
endpoints rely on external placebo data derived from an adult population. The MAH had initially proposed 
to include results from the adult external placebo group in Section 5.1 of the SmPC. A central assumption 
in these comparisons is that placebo remission rates are at the same level for adults and children. Also, 
they require that the studies are conducted in a comparable manner. The submitted application does not 
provide support of these assumptions. The CHMP considers therefore hard to make any conclusions about 
the effect in children from these comparisons, and the corresponding p-values should not be used to 
make claims about the efficacy. The MAH provided some additional argumentations for keeping this in the 
SmPC. However, the issue that the treated group and comparison group are from fundamentally different 
populations remains, and it is therefore not acceptable to include the results of the comparison in the 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 94/136
 
 
SmPC. Upon request from the CHMP, the MAH agreed to remove the efficacy comparison with the adult 
control group from the SmPC. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study adequately defined paediatric patients with moderate to 
severe UC (Mayo score of 6 to 12 points and endoscopy sub score of 2 to 3) from 4 to less than 18 years 
old, who have failed therapy with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant (IMM). Patient were to have 
had previous failed conventional therapy.
The study has two co-primary endpoints, clinical remission at Week 8 as measured by PMS and clinical 
remission at week 52 (in patients receiving PMS response at week 8) measured by FMS. The PMS 
evaluates clinical symptoms such as stool frequency and rectal bleeding and includes a physician’s global 
score. The FMS includes in addition an endoscopic evaluation which is endorsed by CHMP. Four ranked 
secondary endpoints were analysed at week 52, where proportion of subjects receiving systemic 
corticosteroids at Baseline who discontinued systemic corticosteroids prior to Week 52 and were in Mayo 
clinical remission at Week 52 in Week 8 responders per PMS was one of them.
The data in this study has been collected over several years due to inclusion difficulties. A new EMA 
guideline on the development of new medicinal products for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis has been 
released in January 2019. This guidelines states that: “The aim of UC treatment in children should be 
achieving remission without affecting growth and maturation. Symptomatic remission and endoscopic MH 
should be used as co-primary endpoints. The primary endpoint of maintenance trials should be sustained 
relapse-free corticosteroid-free remission (defined as maintaining both, symptomatic remission, and 
endoscopic MH). In addition, it is mentioned at least in the general part of this guideline that for defining 
clinical remission it is recommended to use a sub score of 0 for RBS. Since there is no validated paediatric 
patient reported outcome measurement for the evaluation of symptoms for the time being, the use of the 
PUCAI as a surrogate for symptomatic remission is suggested in the guidelines. 
Although the MAH does not use the more stringent definition of PMS and FMS remission (ie RBS 0), the 
chosen endpoints and exploratory analysis are acceptable to CHMP. The MAH analyses PUCAI as an 
exploratory outcome. Height, weight, BMI, Tanner stage were also analysed as exploratory outcomes. 
Study M10-870 is a Phase 3, multi-centre, open-label study designed to evaluate the long-term 
maintenance of clinical response, safety and tolerability of adalimumab in paediatric subjects with 
ulcerative colitis. Subjects who successfully completed Study M11-290 through Week 52 were potentially 
eligible to participate in this study. The duration of the study is up to 298 weeks, which includes a 288-
week OL maintenance period and a 70-day follow-up phone call. The study is currently ongoing and at the 
data cut-off date of 28 August 2019, no patients had completed the study.  
All subjects received open-label therapy as follows: subjects who enrolled into the study from blinded 
treatment in Study M11-290 received open label 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) eow of adalimumab; or 
subjects who received open label adalimumab in Study M11-290 maintained the same dose in Study 
M10-870. Subjects who experienced disease flare received either of the following:  subjects who were on 
0.6 mg/kg (maximum dose of 40 mg, weight based) eow of adalimumab could receive 0.6 mg/kg 
(maximum of 40 mg, weight based) every week (ew); or subjects who were on 0.6 mg/kg ew of 
adalimumab could receive 40 mg ew (maximum dose) of adalimumab.
The study M10-870 has no primary or secondary endpoints but several exploratory endpoints.

Efficacy data and additional analyses
Study M11-290: 
In the main study, a total of 93 subjects enrolled in the study at 19 sites in Austria, Belgium, Canada, 
Spain, United Kingdom, Israel, Poland, Slovakia, and the US.
In the ITT/Safety population, 73.1% were >13 years of age, with a mean age of 14.1 years, mean 
disease duration of 2.3 years and 54.8% were females. 
The majority of the patients had concomitant immunotherapy (59.1%), 47.3% had concomitant 
corticosteroids at baseline and 16.1% had previously been exposed to TNF-inhibitors. At baseline, 60.2% 
of the patients had extensive disease/pancolitis and mean baseline Mayo score and Partial Mayo score 
were 7.8 and 5.6 respectively reflecting the intended population with an active moderate to severe 
disease despite conventional therapy. Baseline disease characteristics were generally well balanced 
between the two treatment groups receiving I-SD and I-HD.
In the mITT population (i.e  all Week 8 PMS responders who were randomized at Week 8 and received at 
least one dose of the study medication during maintenance period) demographics were similar to the 
patients in the ITT population in respect of gender, age and disease duration. For the mITT population, 
PMS score at week 8 were low (total median (min, max) PMS at week 8 were 1.6 (0.0, 5.0)) as expected 
and did not differ between the treatment groups. Upon request from CHMP, additional demographics were 
presented per age-group (<or≥13 years). There were numerically more females in the <13 years age 
group than in the ≥13 years age group, otherwise the group did not differ in respect of disease severity 
or previous use of TNF-inhibitors.
Of the 93 patients included in the study, 64 patients (68.8%) completed the 52 weeks. During the 
induction phase (week 0-8), 47 patients were randomized to the I-HD group, 30 patients to the I-SD 
group and 16 patients received I-HD open label. In total 18 of the patients (19.4%) discontinued the 
study during the induction phase. The proportion of patients who discontinued the study were numerically 
higher in the I-SD group 8/30 (26.7%) than in the I-HD group 8/47 (17.0%). The main reason for 
discontinuation in all groups were being non responders at week 8. The number of patients screened were 
145 and the number of patients who flared more than once were 7.
For the 74 patients that continued to maintenance treatment, 31 patients were randomized to M-HD, 31 
patients to M-SD and 12 patients to Placebo (M-PL). During the maintenance period, 22 patients (29.7%) 
were rerandomized due to flare. Additional information provided by the MAH upon CHMP’s request 
showed that PMS values at the time of the flare were rather high, with a PMS between 3.6 and 7.4 at the 
time of the flare. No changes in corticosteroid treatment seemed to have occurred in any of the patients 
at the time of the flare. The flares occurred between approximately 1 and 7.8 month after start of 
maintenance treatment in the three groups, with no apparently differences between the groups. It is 
noted that the proportion of patients who flared was numerically higher in the M-HD group (n=9, 29%) 
compared with the M-SD group (n=6, 19%) although the numbers are too small to make any firm 
conclusion. Of the 22 patients who flared, no one achieved FMS remission at week 52, regardless of re-
induction therapy or not. Of the 10 patients who received a re-induction dose, all patients (100%) had an 
initial PMS response at first visit after the re-induction dose (mean 38.0 days after flare) and a third of 
them (33.3%) achieved clinical remission per PMS at week 52. Although the response in the population 
without reinduction dose were numerically lower (66.7% PMS response at first visit after flare and 11.1% 
in PMS remission at week 52) it should be noted that the number of patients in the respective groups are 
small. Only three patients in the M-HD group received a re-induction dose and only one patient achieved 
a beneficial effect from the re-induction dose. The numbers are too low to draw any firm conclusion but 
the fact that none of the patient reached the co-primary endpoint at week 52 (FMS remission) regardless 
of re-induction treatment does not justify the proposed suggestion of a re-induction dose. In addition, the 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

re-induction dose will lead to exposure outside the previously studied exposure range for Humira (see 
also Discussion on clinical pharmacology). Upon request from CHMP, the MAH removed the suggested 
dose re-induction in patients with flares.
At week 8 after the induction phase, clinical remission per PMS was achieved in 59.6% of the patients 
receiving the higher induction dose (I-HD) and in 43.3% of the patients receiving the standard induction 
dose (I-SD). In the group receiving I-HD-OL, 68.8% of the patients reached clinical remission. Although 
only an exploratory statistical comparison was made between the doses, it is noted that a numerically 
higher proportion of patients receiving the higher induction dose reached clinical remission. This supports 
the MAH’s suggested posology using the higher dose for induction therapy. This is also in line with the 
approved posology for induction therapy in adults with the same indication. To further explore the 
supposed differences between the two doses, although no formal statistical analysis can be done, the 
MAH provided tabulations of not only the patients receiving blinded I-SD and blinded I-HD, but also the 
patients receiving blinded I-HD and open label I-HD combined. The proportion of patients with PMS 
remission at week 8 was 61.9% in the I-HD/I-HD-OL group and 43.3% in the I-SD group. The nominal p-
value for this exploratory comparison was 0.09. It is noted that the study was not powered to detect any 
difference between the two doses of adalimumab.
Compared to the external placebo rate (19.83%), I-HD was statistically significantly better, although the 
relevance of this comparison is not endorsed (see statistical methodology discussed above). It is noted 
that the external placebo group for this comparison is derived from the MAH’s own studies in adult 
population with the same indication (studies M06-826 and M06-827).
At week 52, clinical remission per FMS were reached by 14 patients (45.2%) in the maintenance high 
dose group (M-HD) and 9 patients (29.0%) in the maintenance standard dose group (M-SD). Although no 
statistical comparison was made regarding the internal placebo it is noted that 4 patients (33.3%) in the 
placebo group received clinical remission per FMS. Compared to the external placebo rate (18.37%), 
derived from an adult population, statistically significant better effect was seen only in the higher dose. 
This finding could imply that the higher dose is needed for adequate mucosal healing. The same result 
was seen when analysing the second ranked secondary endpoint where mucosal healing at Week 52 as 
measured by Mayo endoscopy sub score (defined as ≤ 1) in Week 8 PMS responders was achieved by 
51.6% of subjects who were randomized to the adalimumab M-HD group and 38.7% of subjects in the M-
SD group. 
Posology
Although no formal comparison between doses is made in this study, the MAH suggests using the higher 
maintenance dose in the paediatric population. The MAH proposes a higher maintenance dose for the 
paediatric UC indication than what is approved as standard dose for the adult UC population and for the 
other paediatric indications (although a dose increase to the currently proposed dose is possible in both 
adult UC and the paediatric Crohn’s population). To further explore the suggested posology, the MAH was 
asked to discuss the results in the light of the results received in the studies of adalimumab treated adult 
population (M06-826 and M06-827). The MAH explained that in the adult UC studies M06-826 and M06-
827, only the standard maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab eow was evaluated for the primary 
efficacy analysis. In the adult study M06-827, the 2nd co-primary endpoint FMS remission at week 52 
were reached by 17.3% in the Adalimumab group compared with 8.5% in the placebo group (although 
this study evaluated all patients randomized to active drug versus placebo at baseline (i.e. in contrast to 
the paediatric population, the placebo group has never received active induction treatment) and not only, 
as in the paediatric population, PMS responders at week 8). In addition, 27.7% and 30.8% of the adult 
UC population in the respective study required escalation to ew dosing during the maintenance period. 
This could, as stated by the MAH, indicate that also a substantial proportion of the adults would benefit 
from a higher dose and this is also reflected in the SmPC were the dose can be escalated to 40 mg ew for 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 97/136
 
 
the adult population. The MAH also argued that paediatric patients often present with a more severe 
disease than adults and that the presented study results from M11-290 point towards a generally better 
efficacy outcome in the M-HD population without indicating any worsening of the safety profile, 
supporting therefore the suggested posology. 
The MAH provided also a justification of the selection for doses used in Study M11-290 and the 
subsequent proposal of a flat dose regimen. The justification is supported including the use of model-
based PK-matching approach to support the flat-dose regimen. The data provide exposures generally 
comparable between the studied body weight-based high induction/high maintenance regimen and the 
proposed two-tiered fixed dosing regimen in paediatric UC patients for the induction and maintenance 
doses. The methodology to support a switch to a flat-dose regimen has been accepted in previous 
paediatric variations for Humira. The MAH’s argumentation is therefore endorsed by CHMP and the dosing 
recommendations are as follows:
Patient Weight
Induction Dose
Maintenance Dose
Starting at Week 4*
< 40 kg
• 80 mg at Week 0 (given as two 40 
• 40 mg every other week
≥ 40 kg
mg injections in one day) and
• 40 mg at Week 2 (given as one 40 
mg injection)
• 160 mg at Week 0 (given as four 
40 mg injections in one day or 
two 40 mg injections per day for 
two consecutive days) and
• 80 mg at Week 2 (given as two 40 
mg injections in one day)
• 80 mg every other week
* Paediatric patients who turn 18 years of age while on Humira should continue their prescribed 
maintenance dose.
The MAH has provided data showing mean RBS improvement from Baseline by 0.86 and 1.07 points in 
subjects on the I-SD and I-HD dose regimens, respectively and RBS improved from Baseline at Week 52  
by 1.48 and 1.36 points in subjects on the M-SD and M-HD doses, respectively. Upon request, the MAH 
provided data on numbers and proportions of patients reaching a rectal bleeding score of 0 at week 8 and 
week 52 and in both treatment doses the proportions were >50% which are acceptable to CHMP.
Clinical remission per PUCAI at Week 8 was achieved by 46.8% and 33.3% of subjects in the adalimumab 
I-HD and I-SD groups, respectively.  PUCAI response at Week 52 in Week 8 PMS responders was 
achieved by 51.6% and 58.1% of subjects in the adalimumab M-HD and M-SD groups, respectively. 
PUCAI remission at Week 52 in Week 8 PMS responders was reported by 58.1% and 45.2% of subjects in 
the adalimumab M-HD and M-SD groups, respectively. The MAH included information about the 
exploratory endpoint PUCAI in 5.1 of the SmPC upon recommendation from CHMP since it is suggested as 
a measure of clinical symptoms in paediatric patients in the EMA guidelines.
The QOL for the adalimumab-treated subjects as well as work productivity and activity impairment for 
their caregivers also showed meaningful improvements as early as Week 8 compared to Baseline during 
the study as measured by IMPACT III and WPAI. At week 52, subjects randomized to the M-SD and M-HD 
treatment regimens achieved mean changes from baseline in Activity Impairment of -19.0 and -32.9 
percentage points, in Impairment While Working of -26.1 and -24.5 percentage points, in Overall Work 
Impairment of  -27.7 and -24.8 percentage points, and in Work Time Missed of  -5.8 and -7.9 percentage 
points at Week 52, respectively. The MAH justified that the mean changes in WPAI were above the 
minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of WPAI established as a change of 7 percentage points1.

Even though established in patients with CD, this MCID has been extrapolated to patients with UC in a 
systemic review of psychometric evaluation in WPAI to evaluate the ability to detect change and the 
responsiveness to treatment2.  In addition, this threshold has also been used in patients with UC to 
demonstrate the treatment effect on clinical meaningful improvement of WPAI3. CHMP endorsed the 
provided justification and considers the improvements measured by IMPACT III and WPAI as clinically 
meaningful. Section 5.1 of the SmPC is updated accordingly.
Study M10-870
The submitted clinical study report is an interim report, covering the main study (excluding Japan). A 
total of 55 patients is included in the study. This study is currently ongoing, and none of subject enrolled 
has yet completed the study. Only three subjects received adalimumab 0.6 mg/kg (maximum dose of 40 
mg) ew (M-HD) at baseline, the other 52 patients received adalimumab 0.6 mg/kg (maximum dose of 40 
mg) eow (M-SD). Of these, 18 subjects (34.6%) had at least 1 dose escalation from the eow dose to the 
ew dose; no subjects had dose de-escalation from the ew dose to the eow dose. The rate of 
discontinuation was 25.5% and the primary reason for discontinuation reported by most subjects was 
lack of efficacy.
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
Despite difficulties to enrol patients during the conduct of the pivotal study M11-290, resulting in change 
of the study design omitting the original placebo group, the study managed to include 93 paediatric 
patients with active moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. 
The results indicate clinically significant effects both in reducing symptoms and mucosal healing. The 
comparison towards the external placebo group received from an adult population relies on a central 
assumption that placebo remission rates are at the same level for adults and children. Also, they require 
that the studies are conducted in a comparable manner. However, the submitted application does not 
provide support of these assumptions. It is therefore hard to make any conclusions about the effect in 
children from these comparisons, and the corresponding p-values cannot be used to make claims about 
the efficacy. At the CHMP’s request, those values were not included in the SmPC. 
The study was not designed to compare the two different doses used, neither for induction therapy nor 
for maintenance therapy. However, the results seem to indicate a better response in the patients 
receiving the higher induction dose and also with the higher maintenance dose. Such results would not be 
expected without active treatment in a population who is non responders to standard of care, and thus, a 
drug effect is undoubtedly shown. 
The MAH proposes a higher maintenance dose for the paediatric UC indication than what is approved as 
standard dose for the adult UC population and for the other paediatric indications (although a dose 
increase to the currently proposed dose is possible in both adult UC and the paediatric Crohn’s 
population). This is acceptable to the CHMP for patients 6 years and older (see also discussions on clinical 
pharmacology). 
The benefit of the suggested one-time re induction dose was not supported by the data submitted; 
therefore, the MAH agreed to remove it from the SmPC.
The following indication is agreed by CHMP:

patients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including

medical contraindications for such therapies.
2.5.  Clinical safety
Introduction
Adalimumab was approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active 
ulcerative colitis (UC) in April 2012 in the European Union (EU) and September 2012 in the US. 
Adalimumab is approved for several paediatric indications: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (from 2 years), 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis (from 4 years), Paediatric Crohn's disease (from 6 years) and Paediatric 
Uveitis (from 2 years). 
With this variation, the MAH seeks to add a new indication for the treatment of paediatric patients 5 to 17 
years of age with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. This application is supported by data 
from 2 Phase 3 clinical studies:  a randomized, controlled study (Study M11-290) and an open-label (OL) 
long-term study (Study M10-870) for subjects who participated in, and successfully completed, Study 
M11-290. 
For an overview of the study design and treatment regimens, please refer to the clinical efficacy section.
Study M11-290 had an 8-week double-blind (DB) induction period and a 44-week DB maintenance period. 
Study M10-870 (extension study of Study M11-290) has a 288-week maintenance period, with subjects 
receiving OL adalimumab beginning at the baseline visit (Week 52 visit from Study M11-290).
The analysis sets are described below. 
Safety data was summarized across all treatment groups ("any adalimumab") for the analysis sets. No 
statistical comparisons were made.

Re-induction data-set
This dataset included all subjects exposed to adalimumab who were re-randomized, due to 1st disease 
flare in maintenance period of Study M11-290, to receive a re-induction dose. Subject data is included 
from first dose of adalimumab in Study M11-290 through last available observation in Study M11-
290/Study M10-870.
Although the number of subjects in the RR with Re-Ind Set was small, the MAH states that the TEAEs for 
this analysis set were consistent with those for the Any ADA Set. Most subjects (90%) in the RR with Re-
Ind Set experienced at least 1 TEAE (Table 41, Table 42). Three subjects (30%) in the RR with Re-Ind 
Set reported a SAE (1 subject had colitis ulcerative; 1 subject had a large intestine polyp; and 1 subject 
had colitis ulcerative, a large intestine polyp, bronchitis, asthma, and growth failure). There was no 
temporal relationship between administration of a re-induction dose and occurrence of any of the SAEs, 
except that 1 event of colitis ulcerative was reported on the same day as the re-induction dose and was 
deemed as having no reasonable possibility of relationship by the investigator. In addition, nonserious 
cytomegalovirus enterocolitis was reported in a subject approximately 3 months after receiving the re-
induction dose. No subject in the RR with Re-Ind Set discontinued study drug due to an AE, and no 
deaths were reported.
In accordance with the study population and the underlying disorder, most subjects in the RR with Re-Ind 
Set reported AEs of the Infections and Infestations (80%) and Gastrointestinal Disorders (60%) SOCs.  
The most frequently reported AEs (> 1 subject) overall were colitis ulcerative (5 subjects), headache (4 
subjects), upper respiratory tract infection (3 subjects), urinary tract infection, viral upper respiratory 
tract infection, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, large intestine polyp, epistaxis (2 subjects each).

Serious adverse events 
During Induction, a total of 10 subjects (10.8%) experienced SAEs.  The most frequently reported SAEs 
were colitis ulcerative (5 subjects [5.4%]). The proportion of subjects with SAEs was higher in the I-SD 
group (5 subjects [16.7%]) than the I-HD group (4 subjects [8.5%]). 
During Maintenance up to the first disease flare, a total of 10 subjects (13.3%) experienced SAEs. The 
most frequently reported SAEs were colitis ulcerative (3 subjects [4.0%]). Similar proportions of subjects 
in the M-SD (12.9%) and M-HD (15.6%) groups experienced SAEs although the incidence rates of SAEs

were consistently higher with the standard dose regimen than the high dose regimen during Induction 
(159.1 E/100 PYs vs 56.3 E/100 PYs) and Maintenance (44.6 E/100 PYs vs 28.3 E/100 PYs), respectively.
In the any adalimumab dataset, a total of 26 of 93 subjects (28.0%) experienced ≥ 1 treatment-
emergent SAE. Anaemia and colitis ulcerative were the only SAEs reported by >5% of subjects.

Infections were the most frequently reported category of AESIs (53.8% of subjects). Serious infectious 
AEs occurred in 6.5% of the patients (bronchitis, gastroenteritis, aseptic meningitis, pharyngitis, urinary 
tract infection). Upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, and nasopharyngitis were the most 
frequently reported infections. No serious infections led to discontinuation of the study drug. 
One nonserious opportunistic infection (cytomegalovirus enterocolitis) was severe and considered by the 
investigator to have a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug; the event resolved in 25 
days. Five subjects had a positive TB test result during their routine annual screening; all events were 
mild, without clinical symptomatology of TB infection, and none led to a change in study drug dose or 
premature discontinuation. Chemoprophylaxis medication was prescribed to 4 subjects who remained in 
the study; 1 subject was lost to follow-up before initiating TB prophylaxis.
The occurrence of serious infections per dose in study M11-290 is shown in Table 45.

Table 45. Treatment-Emergent Serious Infections during Maintenance Period, study M11-290
Allergic reactions
Allergic reactions occurred in 6 subjects; all were mild. One subject had an attack of asthma, which the 
investigator considered probably allergy-related, with cough; the event led to hospitalization and resolved 
in 4 days although the asthma remained intermittent. Two subjects had injection site urticaria that was 
considered by the investigator to have a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. None of the 
AEs required interruption or discontinuation of study drug.
Pancreatitis
One subject had pancreatitis that was moderate, considered by the investigator to have a reasonable 
possibility of being related to study drug, led to hospitalization, and resolved in 15 days. The subject had 
a history of pancreatitis secondary to UC flare prior to study entry.
Haematologic disorders
Anaemia was the only hematologic disorder reported (15 of 93 subjects [16.1%]); in the majority of 
these subjects, the anaemia was mild or moderate and resolved. Five subjects had serious anaemia that 
required hospitalization; 1 of these subjects discontinued study drug due to the anaemia. In 3 of these 
subjects, the anaemia was severe; anaemia was not considered by the investigator to have a reasonable 
possibility of being related to study drug for these subjects. Three of the 5 subjects with serious anaemia 
had a prior medical history of anaemia.
Laboratory findings
According to the MAH, mean changes in haematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis parameter values 
were small and not considered clinically significant. 
In the Any ADA Set, few potentially clinically significant liver function laboratory values were reported. 
One subject with a history of cholecystitis had elevated liver tests including transaminases > 5 × upper 
limit of normal 9 days after the subject had stopped receiving study drug; 1 subject had an isolated ALT 
value > 3 × upper limit of normal. No other subjects had an ALT or AST value > 3 × upper limit of normal 
as of the cut-off date.
Immunological events
Three subjects became AAA+ during the study.  The overall AAA+ rate was 3% (3/100). None of these 
patients had a disease flare during the study. According to the MAH, immunogenicity did not appear to 
have a significant impact on the safety.

Extrinsic factors
According to the MAH, extrinsic factor analyses performed for TEAEs by prior exposure to anti-TNFs, 
baseline systemic corticosteroids, baseline immunosuppressants, and disease severity per Mayo score did 
not show any significant differences, with the exception that: 

the percentage of subjects with SAEs, with serious infections, and with hematologic disorders was 
larger in subjects with prior exposure to anti-TNFs than without (46.7% versus 24.4%, 
respectively, for SAEs; 20.0% versus 3.8%, respectively, for serious infections; 26.7% versus 
14.1%, respectively for hematologic disorders); 

subjects on systemic corticosteroids at Baseline experienced higher incidences of AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug (11.4% versus 4.1%), serious infections (11.4% versus 2.0%), and 
latent TB (9.1% versus 2.0%) compared with subjects without concomitant corticosteroids at 
Baseline, respectively; and 

subjects on concomitant immunosuppressants at Baseline reported more hematologic disorders 
compared with subjects without use of immunosuppressants (21.8% versus 7.9%, respectively). 
Pregnancy and lactation
No pregnancies were reported in Study M11-290 or Study M10-870 as of the 28 August 2019 cut-off 
date.
Discontinuation due to adverse events
Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug occurred in 7 of 93 subjects (7.5%). These 
included anaemia, pericarditis, ulcerative colitis and enteritis. 
Post marketing experience
The proposed indication for paediatric UC is further supported by data from the ImproveCareNow (ICN) 
registry, claims database data, literature data, safety data from other approved indications for Humira in 
paediatric populations, and pharmacovigilance data. 
Real World Evidence 
The safety of Humira in UC paediatric population is supported by supplemental real-world data from a 
number of other sources. One data source is a retrospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study of 
133 patients with UC who were treated with adalimumab at ICN network of paediatric gastroenterology 
care centres in the US up to November 2016. In addition, 4 reports are available on the use of 
adalimumab in 51 paediatric patients with UC, most of whom had prior exposure to infliximab: 1) a 
retrospective analysis reports from an Italian registry (Aloi 20184) and 2) report from a single United 
Kingdom (UK) center (Volonaki 20155), 3) a prospective audit report from clinical centers in the UK 
(Merrick 20186), and 4) an individual patient report (Cameron 20157). In summary, the ICN registry and 
these reports, encompassing a total of 184 patients, suggest that clinically meaningful proportions of 
paediatric patients with UC who were primarily refractory to previous treatment benefitted from use of

adalimumab over durations up to and beyond 1 year. No deaths, malignancies, or TB were reported. The 
available published studies are limited by their noninterventional and mainly retrospective nature, the 
lack of randomization, and a less stringent data collection approach compared to Phase 3 studies, such as 
Study M11-290 and Study M10-870, which may have resulted in underreporting of safety events. 
However, according to the MAH, the observed safety profile in these published sources is consistent with 
the established safety experience with adalimumab in the treatment IBD, the underlying disease and 
patient population, and the use of prior and concomitant UC-related medications. 
Safety Data for Other Approved Paediatric Indications for Humira 
A recent publication reported an analysis of the safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (JIA; polyarticular JIA and paediatric enthesitis-related arthritis), psoriasis, and CD 
from 7 global, randomized, and OL MAH-sponsored clinical trials of adalimumab and the OL extensions 
conducted between September 2002 and December 31, 2015 (Horneff 20188). A total of 577 patients 
were included, for a total of 1440.7 PYs of adalimumab exposure. Across the indications, the most 
frequently reported adverse events were injection site pain, upper respiratory tract infections, headache, 
and nasopharyngitis (44.8, 24.3, 19.9, and 17.3 E/100 PYs, respectively). Serious infections (4.0 E/100 
PYs) were the most frequent serious AEs; serious infection rates were 2.7, 0.8, and 6.6 E/100 PYs, 
respectively, across patients with JIA, psoriasis, and CD. The conclusion was that the safety profile of 
adalimumab across paediatric indications was similar to the respective adult indications taking differences 
between study populations into account; no new safety signals were identified with adalimumab 
treatment. 
Pharmacovigilance Data 
A registry (Study P10-262 [STRIVE]) in patients with polyarticular or polyarticular-course JIA is ongoing, 
with an accumulation of 2204.5 patient-years of adalimumab exposure as of 01 June 2019. To date, the 
benefit-risk profile of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular JIA remains positive. 
The overall safety profile of adalimumab in paediatric patients (from 6 years of age) with moderately to 
severely active CD, some with more than 7 years of exposure, has been consistent with the known safety 
profile of adalimumab in adults with CD. As of December 2019, a total of 192 paediatric patients with CD 
have been exposed to adalimumab (522.1 PYs) in MAH-sponsored clinical studies. A long-term 
noninterventional registry in paediatric patients with moderately to severely active CD (Study P11-292 
[CAPE]) is ongoing, with 887 patients enrolled in the Humira Registry Group with an accumulation of 
1641.5 patient-years of adalimumab exposure as of 31 May 2019. No new safety signals have been 
identified for paediatric patients with CD. 
Treatment with adalimumab to date has been safe and well-tolerated for paediatric patients with 
moderately to severely active CD. Overall, the long-term MAH-sponsored paediatric studies (Study P10-
262 in JIA [completed 10th year] and Study P11-292 in paediatric CD [completed 5th year]) have shown 
that the majority of the most frequently reported treatment-related AEs, including SAE, AESI, and AEs 
that resulted in discontinuation of registry drug are either consistent with the safety profile described in 
the currently approved prescribing information for Humira or associated with the disease of interest. 
Cumulatively, there were a total of 49,693 unique patients on treatment in MAH-sponsored clinical 
studies (including registries) of approved and unapproved indications through 31 December 2019. These 
include clinical studies with RA, JIA, paediatric ERA, ankylosing spondylitis, spondyloarthritis, non-
radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, paediatric psoriasis, CD, paediatric CD, 
UC, hidradenitis suppurativa, uveitis, intestinal Behçet's disease, pustular psoriasis, and pyoderma 
gangrenosum. The estimated cumulative postmarketing patient exposure from all indications from 31

December 2002 (International Birth Date) to 31 December 2019 is 7.8 million patient-treatment years. 
To date, comprehensive data across all Humira postmarketing, observational registries continue to show 
that the benefit-risk profile of Humira in patients of the approved indications remains favourable. 
Real-World Multi-Database Study in Patients in the United States 
To augment the published and registry-based information on AEs in real-world paediatric UC populations, 
the MAH conducted analyses of safety in adalimumab-treated patients with UC < 18 years of age in 2 US-
based administrative claims databases, Optum Clinformatics® (data from 01 January 2013 through 30 
June 2019) and IBM MarketScan® commercial (data from 01 January 2013 through 30 June 2019). 
Patients included in the analyses had a filled prescription claim for adalimumab and met criteria for UC 
diagnosis prior to the date of the first adalimumab claim (index date), were < 18 years of age, and had a 
minimum of 180 days of insurance eligibility on the date of the first adalimumab claim. In each claims 
database, relevant AEs included UC-related inpatient admissions, intestinal resection procedures, 
hospitalized infections (TB and herpes infections separated out), and malignancies (nonmelanoma skin 
cancer separated out). On-treatment person-time (follow-up period) was defined as the day after index 
through the consecutive days covered by adalimumab prescription claims, censoring at the event of 
interest, treatment termination (30 day gap allowed), age 18, end of insurance eligibility, death or end of 
data. Median follow-up duration was 108 – 138 days, depending on database and outcome. 
Demographic characteristics of patients included in the 2 claims database analyses were similar and 
comparable to the respective characteristics of subjects in Study M11-290 (Table 12). Although the 
number of subjects in both adalimumab-treated cohorts was small and median follow-up durations were 
short, the results of relevant AEs (number and percent of subjects, number of AEs per 100 PYs; Table 13) 
reported for each cohort were consistent with the underlying paediatric UC and no new safety information 
was identified.

Table 49. Adverse Events in Adalimumab-Treated Patients with Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis 
(Claims-Based Real-World Cohorts)
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety
Adalimumab is approved for several paediatric indications: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (from 2 years), 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis (from 4 years), Paediatric Crohn's disease (from 6 years) and Paediatric 
Uveitis (from 2 years). It is also approved for adolescent hidradenitis suppurativa from 12 years. With 
this variation, the MAH seeks to add a new indication for the treatment of paediatric patients 5 to 17 
years of age with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. This application is supported by data 
from 2 Phase 3 clinical studies:  a randomized, controlled study (Study M11-290) and its open-label (OL) 
long-term study (Study M10-870).
The recommended standard maintenance dose for the JIA, paediatric plaque psoriasis and paediatric 
uveitis indications are lower than what is now proposed for UC:



JIA and paediatric plaque psoriasis: 
<30 kg: 20 mg every other week (eow) and ≥30 kg: 40 mg eow
Adolescent hidradenitis suppurativa (from 12 years): 
≥30 kg: 40 mg eow 
Paediatric Crohn's disease: 
<40 kg: 20 mg eow and ≥40 kg: 40 mg eow 
Patients with insufficient response may increase the dose as follows:
< 40 kg: 20 mg every week; and ≥ 40 kg: 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week
The proposed maintenance dose for the paediatric UC population is <40 kg: 40 mg eow and ≥40 kg: 80 
mg eow
Thus, the recommended maintenance dose is doubled compared to the standard maintenance dose in the 
paediatric Crohn’s disease population. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 118/136
 
 
 
For the adult population, the same dose is recommended for both the Crohn’s and UC population: 40 mg 
eow with possibility to dose increase to 40 mg ew or 80 mg eow in patients who experience decrease in 
their response.
The mean duration of adalimumab exposure for the 93 subjects included in study M11-290 was 569.6 
days, giving a total of 145.0 PYs of exposure. Among the 93 patients, 57 patients (61.3%) were exposed 
to Humira for more than 1 year. This can be compared to the approval of the paediatric CD indication, 
where a total of 192 patients were exposed to at least 1 dose of Humira whereof 115 patients were 
exposed for more than 1 year (Humira II-88 EPAR, variation approved in 2013). Although the exposure is 
markedly smaller in the current application, this can be acceptable given the overall exposure to date of 
Humira in paediatric patients, and especially given that UC and CD share many common features and the 
same safety profiles can be expected in both populations. 
As stated in the EMA Guideline on Development of new medicinal products for the treatment of ulcerative 
colitis, the following factors should be considered to justify extrapolation of data from use in adults:
 Whether the substance belongs to a well-studied pharmacological class for which several 
substances have already been granted a paediatric indication – this requirement is considered 
fulfilled by CHMP, since infliximab is approved for the treatment of paediatric UC.
 Whether a comprehensive amount of data has already been collected in adults with UC - this 
requirement is considered fulfilled by CHMP since adalimumab is approved for the treatment of 
adults with UC
 Whether a safe dose in children has been identified for the same medicinal product for other 
diseases - this requirement is fulfilled based on the other approved paediatric indications
The mean age of the studied patients was 14.1 years (range 5-17). The majority (~80%) was older than 
12 years, and only 19 of the patients were below 12 years of age (5, 6, 7 (n=2), 8 (n=2), 9 (n=3), 10 
(n=3), 11 (n=7)).
Study M11-290 had an 8-week double-blind (DB) induction period and a 44-week DB maintenance period. 
Study M10-870 (extension study of Study M11-290) has a 288-week maintenance period, with subjects 
receiving OL adalimumab beginning at the baseline visit (Week 52 visit from Study M11-290).
Induction phase
Two different induction regimens were studied (differences between the two regimens are highlighted in 
bold): 


High dose: adalimumab 2.4 mg/kg (maximum dose of 160 mg) at Baseline and at Week 1, 1.2 
mg/kg (maximum dose of 80 mg) at Week 2, followed by 0.6 mg/kg (maximum dose of 40 mg) 
at Week 4 and Week 6.  
Standard dose: adalimumab 2.4 mg/kg (maximum dose of 160 mg) at Baseline and matching 
placebo at Week 1, 1.2 mg/kg (maximum dose of 80 mg) at Week 2, followed by 0.6 mg/kg 
(maximum dose of 40 mg) at Week 4 and Week 6.  
During the induction phase, a total of 55.9% of the patients reported any AEs. The frequency of AEs was 
slightly higher among subjects receiving the “standard” dose induction (56.7%) than those receiving 
“high” dose induction (48.9%). Most TEAEs reported were mild to moderate in severity. The SOCs with 
the most frequently reported TEAEs were infections and infestations (21.5%) and gastrointestinal 
disorders (21.5%). Headache, anaemia and ulcerative colitis were most commonly observed adverse 
events. Headache is a known side effect, reported as “very common” in the SmPC. Regarding anaemia, 
the frequency was higher in the standard dose group, probably reflecting disease activity rather than a 
consequence of the treatment.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 119/136
 
 
The proportion of subjects with serious AEs was higher in the I- SD group (16.7%) than the I- HD group 
(8.5%). Only 3 patients (3.2%) experienced adverse events leading to discontinuation of the study drug. 
In summary, the observed adverse events are expected given the known safety profile of Humira, and 
there seemed to be no dose-relation in the frequency or severity of adverse events.
Maintenance phase
Two different maintenance regimens were studied (from week 8 and onwards): 


Standard dose: Adalimumab 0.6 mg/kg (maximum dose of 40 mg) eow
High dose: Adalimumab 0.6 mg/kg (maximum dose of 40 mg) ew
During the maintenance phase, a total of 66.7% of the adalimumab-treated patients reported adverse 
events (64.5% in the standard dose group and 68.8% in the high dose group). The proportion of patients 
experiencing any treatment-emergent adverse events was higher among placebo-treated patients than 
among patients treated with adalimumab (both standard dose and high dose), whereas severe adverse 
events were more frequent among adalimumab-treated patients. It is noted that most of these were not 
considered related to the study drug. Adverse events and serious adverse events were slightly more 
frequent for the high dose regimen, than for the standard dose regimen. There were no deaths in any of 
the study groups. It should be noted that also placebo-treated patients achieved induction treatment with 
adalimumab. 
The SOCs with the most frequently reported TEAEs were infections and infestations (37.3%) and 
gastrointestinal disorders (29.3%). Headache and ulcerative colitis were most commonly observed 
adverse events.
The proportion of adalimumab-treated subjects who experienced TEAEs related to study drug was slightly 
higher in the HD group than in the SD group (31.3% vs. 25.8%). The most frequently reported TEAEs 
having a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug were colitis ulcerative (4.8%), fatigue, 
headache, and rash (all 3.2%). It is noted that serious infections were slightly more frequent for the high 
dose regimen (3/32 subjects, 9.4%) than for the SD regimen (2/31 subjects, 6.5%), but the absolute 
number of cases was very low in both groups.
Long-term extension study M10-870
In the long-term extension study M10-870, all patients received open-label Humira as follows:


Subjects who enrolled into the study from blinded treatment in Study M11-290 received OL 
adalimumab 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every other week (eow).
Subjects who received OL adalimumab (ew at 0.6 mg/kg [maximum of 40 mg]) in Study M11-290 
maintained the same dose in Study M10-870
Subjects with a disease flare who were on adalimumab 0.6 mg/kg (maximum dose of 40 mg, weight 
based) eow could receive adalimumab 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg, weight based) every week (ew). 
Subjects with a disease flare who were on adalimumab 0.6mg/kg ew could receive adalimumab 40 mg ew 
(maximum dose of 40 mg).
Thus, only patients who flared in this study received the higher dose regimen.
Combined dataset (“Any Adalimumab dataset”)
A total of 80/93 patients (86%) experienced adverse events. The most commonly occurring side effects 
were headache and infections. Many of the described adverse events are more likely to be associated with 
the disease per se (i.e. ulcerative colitis, abdominal pain and increased CRP) while for example anaemia 
can be associated with both the disease and adalimumab treatment.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 120/136
 
 
A total of 26/93 patients (28%) experienced serious adverse events. Most common were gastrointestinal 
disorder which is not likely associated with the treatment but rather with the disease. Anaemia occurred 
in 5% of the patients, but causality with Humira is difficult to assess because it is a common symptom of 
UC. Serious infections occurred in 6/93 patients (6.5%); bronchitis, gastroenteritis (2 cases), aseptic 
meningitis, pharyngitis and urinary tract infection. This is consistent with the known safety profile of 
Humira.
Upon request from CHMP, the MAH presented the frequency of adverse events, serious adverse events 
and infections in pooled data from studies M11-290 and M10-870 for the two different maintenance 
dosing regimens (SD/HD) separately. For infections and serious infections the exposure-adjusted 
incidence rates were lower for the SD regimen than for the HD regimen (infections: 53.2 E/100PYs vs 
79.4 E/100PYs, serious infections: 3.7 E/100PYs vs 6.3 E/100PYs). It is agreed with the MAH that overall, 
the safety profile of subjects who received the M-SD and the M-HD regimens were similar during Studies 
M11-290 and M10-870.
There were no malignancies or deaths in the studies. The rate of ADAs was low.
Among the AESIs, infections were the most common adverse event. Most infections were mild, and 
serious infections were uncommon and did not lead to treatment discontinuation in any case. There were 
6 cases of allergic reactions, but none of these patients had to discontinue treatment. Regarding 
anaemia, this is a common symptom of UC and causality with Humira is difficult to assess. The fact that 
3/5 patients had a history of anaemia makes confounding by disease more likely.
To conclude, the AESIs reported are consistent with the expected safety profile of Humira.
Serious adverse events were slightly more frequent in patients aged ≥13 years than in the younger age 
group, while infections were more common among the younger children. Serious infections were however 
less frequent among the younger children, which is reassuring. 
The rate of anti-adalimumab antibody in patients with moderately to severely active paediatric UC 
receiving adalimumab was 3%. Section 5.1 of the SmPC is updated with the immunogenicity in this 
patient population.
One patient (1/93) had an ALT value > 3 × upper limit of normal. Section 4.8 of the SmPC is updated to 
include this information.
There was no specific pattern observed with regards to adverse events by weight group. Safety data in 
the youngest patients is very limited, since only 19 of the patients were below 12 years of age (5, 6, 7 
(n=2), 8 (n=2), 9 (n=3), 10 (n=3), 11 (n=7)). PK data indicates high exposures in subjects of low 
weight. The initially proposed indication for patients 5 years older was therefore not supported from a 
safety perspective. The MAH was in the first round asked to discuss to include a lower weight cut-off in 
the indication statement. Based on the presented data, the MAH was asked to revise the indication to 
include only children aged 6 years and older. The MAH revised the indication as requested and the issue 
was solved. 
The MAH has summarised post-marketing data from several sources to support the recently proposed 
indication. These include the ICN registry and literature reports, including a total of 184 paediatric UC 
patients. There were no deaths, malignancies or TB cases reported from these sources.  
There is also data on paediatric use of adalimumab from other indications. In a publication by Horneff, a 
total of 577 patients were included. The authors conclude that the safety profile of adalimumab across 
paediatric indications was similar to the respective adult indications taking differences between study 
populations into account; no new safety signals were identified with adalimumab treatment.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 121/136
 
 
The MAH has also summarised pharmacovigilance data from other paediatric indications. These include 
polyarticular JIA (2204 patient-years) and CD (192 patients, 522 patient-years in clinical studies and 887 
patients (1641.5 patient-years) in a non-interventional registry). 
Finally, data is presented from two US-based claims databases (Optum and IBM MarketScan). These 
include a total of 615 Humira-treated UC patients aged <18 years. There were no deaths and no cases of 
TB observed in these data. There was one case of malignancy; a malignant brain tumour. 
Although the limitations with these data must be acknowledged, it is agreed with the MAH that the 
exposure of Humira in paediatric patients is large and that these data can be considered supportive for 
the safety of Humira in paediatric UC. 
In the SmPC, there was an option to repeat the induction dose of 80 mg (<40 kg) or 160 mg (≥40 kg) in 
patients who experience a disease flare after beginning maintenance therapy. A higher proportion of 
subjects who received a re-induction dose (33.3%) demonstrated clinical response at Week 52 compared 
to subjects without re-induction (22.2%). Nonetheless, the benefit of this re-induction dose is not 
considered to overweigh the potential risks since it will lead to exposures outside the previously studied 
exposure range for Humira which is not accepted. The MAH removed this re-induction regimen from the 
SmPC as requested.
Patients with UC are at increased risk for colorectal cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. The presented data 
are too limited to assess the long-term risks associated with Humira treatment in children with UC. As 
stated in the EMA Guideline on Development of new medicinal products for the treatment of ulcerative 
colitis, “Collection of safety data will always be required to identify any unexpected age-specific safety 
events. For the confirmation of efficacy and to evaluate safety in larger populations long-term post-
marketing observational studies (i.e. registries) may be used”. Therefore, long-term data in paediatric UC 
patients will be important. The MAH has provided a discussion on the feasibility to collect observational 
data within a relevant study setting with special focus on dysplasia of the colon and colorectal cancer. 
Assuming an annual background risk to develop CRC of 0.011% for paediatric patients with UC, a study 
with a follow-up time of up to 10 years would lead to a sample size of N = 8,838. It is agreed with the 
MAH that this is not considered feasible. Therefore, the MAH’s proposal to perform standard 
postmarketing safety surveillance is acceptable. Long-term safety information in peadiatric UC patients is 
included as missing information in the RMP and will be reviewed in future PSURs. Furthermore, the final 
report from the extension phase of the paediatric UC study, which is a Category 3 in the RMP, will be 
submitted in 2025. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety
Although the exposure of adalimumab to paediatric patients with UC is limited, there is no new safety 
signal identified in the paediatric clinical development program submitted. Adalimumab has a well 
characterised safety profile in several authorised indications, including adult UC and juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis (from 2 years), paediatric plaque psoriasis (from 4 years), paediatric Crohn's disease (from 6 
years) and paediatric uveitis (from 2 years). 
The MAH proposes a higher maintenance dose for the paediatric UC indication than what is approved as 
standard dose for the other paediatric indications (although a dose increase to the currently proposed 
dose is possible in the paediatric Crohn’s population). Although a slightly higher frequency of infections 
was observed for the high-dose regimen than compared to the standard dose regimen, the overall safety 
profile is similar for the two regimens.
The MAH was in the first round asked to discuss to include a lower weight cut-off in the indication 
statement. Based on the presented data indicating exposures exceeding previously approved ones and 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 122/136
 
 
largest deviations between the body-weight dosing of the clinical study and the proposed flat dosing 
observed in lowest group, the MAH was asked to revise the indication to include only children aged 6 
years and older. The MAH revised the indication as requested and the issue was solved.
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.
2.6.  Risk management plan
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application. 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 15.1 is acceptable. The CHMP endorsed the 
Risk Management Plan version 15.1 with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC for 40mg/0.8mL, 
40mg/0.4mL and 80mg/0.8mL presentations have been updated to include treatment of moderately to 
severely active ulcerative colitis in paediatric patients for Humira. The Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly.
The MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the 
SmPC for all the presentations.
Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template (version 10.1).
2.7.1.  User consultation
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reason: the proposed 
changes are limited and not considered to significantly affect the readability of the package leaflet.
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
3.1.1.  Disease or condition
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the two primary forms of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It 
is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disease of the rectum and/or large intestine characterized by 
inflammation and ulceration of the mucosal and submucosal intestinal layers. The hallmark clinical 
symptoms include bloody diarrhoea associated with rectal urgency and tenesmus. 
The clinical course of UC is marked by exacerbation and remission of symptoms and may eventually 
require a restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch–anal anastomosis (IPAA) in up to 30% of patients. 
The most severe intestinal manifestations of UC are toxic megacolon, perforation, and massive 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 128/136
 
 
haemorrhage. Furthermore, UC may be accompanied by extra-intestinal manifestations such as arthritis, 
dermatological conditions, uveitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis (which can progress to liver failure 
requiring transplantation, and is associated with an increased risk of colorectal, bile duct, and gallbladder 
cancers). 
The general clinical and histopathological features of UC as well as the drug effects are similar in adults 
and children. Both patient populations share the same clinical hallmark symptoms: inflammation being 
limited to large intestine and rectum, the occurrence of extra-intestinal manifestations, and the clinical 
course which usually alternates between exacerbation and remission and may lead to colectomy. There is 
also substantial overlap of gene expression profiles from disease tissues in both paediatric and adult UC 
patients suggesting strong similarity of molecular pathways. In addition, treatment paradigms are 
essentially similar for both populations, and pharmacological therapies such as aminosalicylates, 
corticosteroids, immunosuppressants (IMMs), and anti-tumour necrosis factors (TNFs) (e.g., infliximab) 
have shown efficacy in adult and paediatric patients with UC. However, there are differences in the 
phenotypic presentation and progression of the disease. While the vast majority of adults with UC have 
limited or left-sided colitis, pancolitis is more common in children. Ulcerative colitis often presents as a 
more severe disease in children. Severity of disease correlates with the likelihood of colectomy; 10-year 
colectomy rates in adults are 15% to 25% compared to 30% to 40% in paediatric patients. 
The burden of colectomy is high in paediatric UC; among children presenting with moderate or severe 
disease, 9% had surgery within 1 year and 26% within 5 years. The cumulative likelihood of colectomy is 
generally similar between adults and children (in children 6% after 1year, 29% after 20years). 
Age of Onset, Incidence, and Prevalence 
Ulcerative colitis onset can occur at any age, but it is rare in infants and relatively infrequent in early 
childhood. The overall (adult and paediatric) incidence of UC has been reported as 1.2 to 20.3 cases per 
100,000 persons/year. Incidence of paediatric IBD (CD and UC) has been increasing worldwide, including 
in the US. Evidence suggests that the incidence of early-onset IBD, including UC, is increasing in younger 
age groups. Recent studies provide incidence estimates for children under 5 years old in European 
countries, including up to 1.0 per 100,000 for females in the UK, 0.7 per 100,000 in Hungary, and 2.22 
per 100,000 in Germany. Among older children, estimated incidence rates are higher. In France, the 
estimated incidence of UC is 0.6 per 100,000 person-years among children aged 0 to 9 years old and 4.1 
per 100,000person-years among children aged 10 to 16. Corresponding estimates in Finland are 3.1 per 
100,000 person-years for children 0 to 9 years, 15.4 per 100,000 person-years for 10to 15 years, and 
finally 40.4 per 100,000 person years for 15 to 19years old. Similar increases in incidence with increases 
in age was also seen in Germany, Italy, the UK, and Hungary. 
There are some published prevalence estimates of UC for a few European countries, although the bulk of 
the recently published literature reports estimated incidence rates as opposed to prevalence estimates. 
Unsurprisingly, prevalence increases with increasing age. The highest published prevalence estimate was 
from Denmark, with an estimated 83.4 cases per 100,000 people under 16 years old. The lowest 
prevalence estimate is from Germany, which was 23.74 cases per 100,000 children 18 years old or 
younger.
In a commercially insured US population of over 12.5million people for the period 2008– 2009, the 
prevalence of paediatric UC (<20 years of age) was estimated as 34 (95% confidence interval [CI] 32 – 
36) per 100,000 persons. The prevalence of paediatric UC increased with age.
More recently, in an observational retrospective cross-sectional study conducted in 2 claims databases in 
the US, the pooled prevalence in 2016 per 100,000 was 21.6 for UC (95% CI, 20.3– 22.8) for paediatric 
patients (2 to 17 years of age). This real-world data study reported a 152% increase in prevalence for UC

from 2007 to 2016 (8.6 to 21.6), which was attributed mainly to increases in the 10 to 17-year-old 
subgroup.
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
The pharmacological treatment of UC in childhood is largely the same as in adulthood. Conventional 
pharmaceutical therapies do not completely abate the inflammatory process and have significant side 
effects. Conventional therapies for the induction of remission have included anti-inflammatory agents (5-
aminosalicylic acid [5-ASA] derivatives and corticosteroids) and the immunomodulatory agent 
cyclosporine. 5-aminosalicylic acid derivatives as well as immunomodulatory agents (azathioprine [AZA]or 
6-mercaptopurine [6-MP]) have been used for the maintenance of remission. Safety issues associated 
with the use of thiopurines include bone marrow suppression, malignancies including lymphoma, and 
serious infections including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Corticosteroids are not effective 
for the maintenance of remission. In addition to the induction and maintenance of clinical remission, 
absence of adverse effects on linear growth and maturation is demanded from therapy of paediatric UC. 
Similar to adults, corticosteroid dependence is frequent, but long-term corticosteroids are absolutely 
contraindicated because they do not maintain remission and have a negative effect on linear growth and 
bone mineralization. Infliximab (a chimeric monoclonal anti-TNF-α antibody) was approved in Europe for 
the treatment of paediatric patients with severe UC and in the US for the treatment of paediatric patients 
with moderate to severe UC based on the results of an open-label (OL) study in 60 subjects. However, 
infliximab is an intravenous (IV) therapy, may pose a burden to paediatric patients. For adult UC, 
vedolizumab and tofacitinib were approved globally and in the US and European Union (EU) respectively, 
and ustekinumab was approved in the US and EU recently, but none have been approved for paediatric 
UC patients. Hence, additional treatment options that offer induction and maintenance of remission to a 
clinically meaningful number of patients, an acceptable safety profile, and more convenient dosing 
regimens than currently approved therapies are needed for paediatric UC patients. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies
The main studies to support the new indication is study M11-290, and its open-label extension study 
M10-870.
Study M11-290 was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, DB trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of adalimumab in paediatric subjects with moderate to severe UC who have failed therapy with 
corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant (IMM). Study M11-290 had an 8-week DB induction period 
and a 44-week DB maintenance period.
Prior to an important amendment (4) due to recruitment issues, enrolled subjects were randomized 3:2 
at Baseline to 1 of 2 DB adalimumab induction doses, induction high dose (I-HD) or induction standard 
dose (I-SD). At Week 8, subjects demonstrating a clinical response were randomized to the following 
groups:  adalimumab maintenance standard dose (M-SD), adalimumab maintenance high dose (M-HD), 
or placebo. Subjects will continue their blinded treatment during the maintenance period until Week 52.
After this amendment, enrolled subjects received adalimumab induction high dose open-label (I-HD-OL).  
At Week 8, subjects demonstrating a clinical response were randomized to 1 of 2 adalimumab 
maintenance treatment groups, M-SD or M-HD.  Subjects continued on their blinded treatment during the 
maintenance period until Week 52
Study M10-870 (extension of Study M11-290) had a 288-week maintenance period, with subjects 
receiving OL adalimumab beginning at the baseline visit (Week 52 visit from Study M11-290).

EMA/584443/2020

3.2.  Favourable effects
At week 8 after the induction phase, clinical remission per Partial Mayo Score (PMS, evaluates clinical 
symptoms such as stool frequency and rectal bleeding and includes a physician’s global score) was 
received in 59.6% of the patients receiving the higher induction dose (I-HD) and in 43.3% of the patients 
receiving the standard induction dose (I-SD). In the group receiving I-HD OL, 68.8% of the patients 
reached clinical remission. Although an exploratory statistical comparison was made between the doses, it 
is noted that a numerically higher proportion of patients receiving the higher induction dose reached 
clinical remission. Compared to an external placebo rate (19.83%) derived from a meta-analysis of 
placebo-controlled studies from an adult population with UC, I-HD was statistically significantly better.
At week 52, clinical remission per Full Mayo Score (FMS includes in addition to PMS also an endoscopic 
evaluation) were reached by 14 patients (45.2%) in the maintenance high dose group (M-HD) and 9 
patients (29.0%) in the maintenance standard dose group (M-SD). Although no statistical comparison 
was made regarding the internal placebo it is noted that 4 patients (33.3%) in the placebo group also 
received clinical remission per FMS. Compared to the external placebo rate (18.37%), derived from an 
adult population, statistically significant better effect was seen only in the higher dose. The same result 
was seen when analysing the second ranked secondary endpoint where mucosal healing at Week 52 as 
measured by Mayo endoscopy subscore (defined as ≤ 1) in Week 8 PMS responders was achieved by 
51.6% of subjects who were randomized to the adalimumab M-HD group and 38.7% of subjects in the M-
SD group. 
Among the 22 patients who experienced a disease flare during the maintenance treatment, a numerically 
greater proportion of subjects who received a re-induction dose (33.3%) demonstrated clinical response 
at Week 52 compared to subjects without re-induction (22.2%), although the number in each subgroup 
were too small to be conclusive.
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
Since recruitment to the internal placebo group was ceased after amendment 4, the presented efficacy 
endpoints rely on data derived from an adult population. A central assumption in these comparisons is 
that placebo remission rates are at the same level for adults and children. Also, they require that the 
studies are conducted in a comparable manner. The submitted application did not provide support of 
these assumptions. It is therefore hard to make any conclusions about the effect in children from these 
comparisons, and the corresponding p-values should not be used to make claims about the efficacy. The 
study was not designed to compare the two different doses used, neither for induction therapy nor for 
maintenance therapy. Results from the external placebo control group are therefore not included in the 
approved SmPC.
The MAH proposes a higher maintenance dose for the paediatric UC indication than what is approved as 
standard dose for the adult UC population and for the other paediatric indications. A dose increase to the 
currently proposed dose is possible in both adult UC and the paediatric Crohn’s population as of 6 years of 
age. A flat dosing is proposed while a body weight dosing was used in the clinical study. Simulated 
exposures in children down to 15kg indicated exposures exceeding previously approved exposures, the 
largest deviations between the body-weight dosing of the clinical study and the proposed flat dosing were 
observed in the lowest age group. The available data, from other authorised indications, were thus 
considered sufficient to support a use in children as of 6 years age. At the CHMP’s request, the MAH 
restricted therefore the indication to patients 6 years and older.
Upon request from CHMP, the MAH has deleted the previous suggested “flare-treatment”, since none of 
the patients who flared achieved FMS remission at week 52, regardless of re-induction therapy or not and 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 131/136
 
 
the maintenance adalimumab concentrations subsequent a re-induction dose are higher than has been 
previously accepted for adalimumab in the paediatric and adult populations.
3.4.  Unfavourable effects
During the induction phase, a total of 55.9% of the patients reported any AEs; 56.7% among subjects 
receiving the “standard” dose induction and 48.9% among those receiving “high” dose induction. The 
SOCs with the most frequently reported TEAEs were infections and infestations (21.5%) and 
gastrointestinal disorders (21.5%). Headache, anaemia and ulcerative colitis were most commonly 
observed adverse events. Serious AEs were reported in 16.7% of the patients in the standard dose group 
and 8.5% of the patients in the high dose group. 
During the maintenance phase, a total of 66.7% of the patients reported adverse events (64.5% in the 
standard dose group and 68.8% in the high dose group). The SOCs with the most frequently reported 
TEAEs were infections and infestations (37.3%) and gastrointestinal disorders (29.3%). Headache and 
ulcerative colitis were most commonly observed adverse events.
In the combined dataset (“any adalimumab dataset”), a total of 80/93 patients (86%) experienced 
adverse events. The most commonly occurring side effects were headache and infections. A total of 26/93 
patients (28%) experienced serious adverse events, with gastrointestinal disorder being most frequent. 
There were no malignancies or deaths in the studies.
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects
The MAH proposes a higher maintenance dose for the paediatric UC indication than what is approved as 
standard dose for the other paediatric indications (although a dose increase to the currently proposed 
dose is possible in the paediatric Crohn’s population). Although short-term safety data is considered 
acceptable, long-term data in paediatric UC patients will be important. Additional safety data will be 
collected from the extension study M10-870 (Category 3 in the RMP).
Other important uncertainties pertain to adverse events occurring with a low frequency and long latency, 
because of the small study size and relatively short follow-up time. Patients with ulcerative colitis are at 
increased risk for colorectal cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. Paediatric UC can be more complicated and 
more inflammatory active than adult UC (as stated in the EMA GL), leading to an even higher risk for 
malignancies in children than in adults. Long-term safety data is included as missing information in the 
RMP and will be reviewed in future PSURs. Furthermore, the final report from the extension phase of the 
paediatric UC study M10-870 will be submitted in 2025.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
The pivotal study in children and adolescents had no internal control arm. Control arm was initially 
included in the study design, study protocol was updated to remove it due to recruitment issues. Instead, 
the MAH proposes a comparison to an external placebo group, achieved from an adult population. This 
comparison has several limitations and is not considered valid. However, the results clearly indicate that 
treatment with Humira results in clinically significant effects both in reducing symptoms and mucosal 
healing. 
The study was not designed to compare the two different doses used, neither for induction therapy nor 
for maintenance therapy, but the results indicate a better response in the patients receiving the higher 
induction dose and also with the higher maintenance dose. Such results would not be expected without 
active treatment in a population who is non responders to standard of care, and thus, a drug effect is 
undoubtedly shown. 
The MAH proposes a higher maintenance dose for the paediatric UC indication than what is approved as 
standard dose for the other paediatric indications, although a dose increase to the currently proposed 
dose is possible in the paediatric Crohn’s population. For infections and serious infections, the exposure-
adjusted incidence rates were lower for the SD regimen than for the HD regimen (infections: 53.2 
E/100PYs vs 79.4 E/100PYs, serious infections: 3.7 E/100PYs vs 6.3 E/100PYs). It is agreed with the MAH 
that overall, the safety profile of subjects who received the M-SD and the M-HD regimens were similar 
during Studies M11-290 and M10-870.
Safety data in the youngest patients is very limited, since only 19 of the patients were below 12 years of 
age (5, 6, 7 (n=2), 8 (n=2), 9 (n=3), 10 (n=3), 11 (n=7)). The MAH was first asked to discuss to include 
a lower weight cut-off in the indication statement. Based on the presented data indicating exposures 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/584443/2020
Page 134/136
 
 
exceeding previously approved ones and largest deviations between the body-weight dosing of the clinical 
study and the proposed flat dosing observed in lowest group, the MAH was asked to revise the indication 
to include only children aged 6 years and older. The MAH revised the indication as requested and the 
issue was solved.
There were no new safety signals observed during the study period. The most commonly reported 
adverse events were infections and gastrointestinal disorders, the latter rather representing a disease 
manifestation. The observed safety profile is consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab and 
other TNF inhibitors. Although the exposure of paediatric UC patients is limited, the use of Humira in 
other paediatric indications is large and knowledge on the safety profile from these indications could be 
considered supportive for this new indication, provided that the MAH can present supportive data for the 
currently proposed dose. There is however need for long-term data that will be collected post-approval 
from the extension study M10-870 (Category 3 in the RMP), especially because of the concern on an 
increased risk for malignancies in paediatric patients with UC.
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks
The results of the pivotal study show a clinically significant effect both in reducing symptoms and mucosal 
healing. The results indicate a better response in the patients receiving the higher induction dose and also 
with the higher maintenance dose. 
The safety profile observed in the studies is consistent with the known safety profile of Humira, and no 
new safety signals were observed. 
There is need for further long-term follow up post marketing considering that the dose is higher 
compared to standard maintenance dose in other indications. Long term data in paediatric patients with 
UC will be collected in the extension study M10-870 (Category 3 in the RMP).
The benefit/risk balance of Humira in paediatric patients from 6 years with moderately to severely active 
ulcerative colitis is positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance
Not applicable.
3.8.  Conclusions
The overall B/R of Humira is positive in the following indication:
Paediatric ulcerative colitis
Humira is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in paediatric 
patients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including 
corticosteroids and/or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have 
medical contraindications for such therapies.

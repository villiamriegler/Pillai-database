Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan
Summary  of  risk  management  plan  for  Seebri 
Breezhaler (glycopyrronium bromide)
This is a summary of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Seebri Breezhaler. The 
RMP details important risks of Seebri Breezhaler, how these risks can be minimized, 
and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about  Seebri  Breezhaler’s  risks  and 
uncertainties (missing information).
Seebri  Breezhaler’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package 
leaflet  give  essential  information  to  healthcare  professionals  and  patients  on  how 
Seebri Breezhaler should be used.
This summary of the RMP for Seebri Breezhaler should be read in the context of all 
this  information  including  the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-
language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the  European  Public  Assessment  Report 
(EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Seebri Breezhaler RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Seebri  Breezhaler  is  authorized  for  maintenance  bronchodilator  treatment  to  relieve 
symptoms in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (see SmPC for 
the full indication). It contains glycopyrronium bromide as the active substance and it 
is given by Inhalation powder hard capsules.
Further information about the evaluation of Seebri Breezhaler’s benefits can be found 
in  the  EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage.
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or 
further characterize the risks
Important risks of Seebri Breezhaler, together with measures to minimize such risks 
and  the  proposed  studies  for  learning  more  about  Seebri  Breezhaler’s  risks,  are 
outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;

 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. 
with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
If important information that may affect the safe use of Seebri Breezhaler is not yet 
available, it is listed under “missing information” below.
II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important  risks  of  Seebri  Breezhaler are  risks  that need  special  risk  management 
activities to further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can 
be safely taken.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified 
risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Seebri 
Breezhaler. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this  association  has  not  been 
established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks
Table 2
Important identified risk: Hypersensitivity including
angioedema
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Causal association was based on post-marketing data supported by data 
from class effect, clinical trial, and published literature (Guglielmi et al 
2006).
Risk factors and risk groups Patients with pre-existing hypersensitivity to drugs are in higher risk for 
developing new reaction. Women are shown to have a higher incidence 
of ADRs than men. On-going diseases may favor drug hypersensitivity 
reactions. For instance, patients affected with asthma or nasal polyposis 
are more frequently hypersensitive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs. Drug allergy in HIV infected patients occurs at a 10-100 time 
increased rate when compared to HIV-negative subjects. The herpes 
infection is also a risk factor for ADRs. Atopy in general is not a risk 
factor, but atopic patients may suffer from more severe reactions 
(Guglielmi et al 2006).
Patients with pre-existing hypersensitivity to drugs are in higher risk for 
developing new reactions including angioedema. In addition, patients with 
hereditary angioedema are in a much higher risk.

Important potential risk - Medication errors
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Current evidence is based on post-marketing reports. The most frequent 
medication error was swallowing/ingestion of the capsule instead of 
placing the capsule in the device for inhalation, which may lead to 
decreased effect of the medication.
Risk factors and risk groups None. Elderly patients are at higher risk due to difficulties to follow

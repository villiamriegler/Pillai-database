Fast-acting insulin aspart (faster aspart) is insulin aspart in a new formulation, which has been developed 
as a mealtime insulin with a faster glucose-lowering effect compared to the original insulin aspart 
formulation with the global trade name NovoRapid. Faster aspart has received marketing authorisation in 
the EU in January 2017, under the tradename Fiasp, for the treatment of adult patients with diabetes 
mellitus. 
Assessment report  
EMA/400065/2019 
Page 5/78 
  
  
 
 
 
The objective of the development of faster aspart was to more closely mimic the physiological mealtime 
insulin response compared to other available mealtime insulins. Moreover, the aim with faster aspart was 
to address some of the real-life challenges faced by individuals who require mealtime insulin, such as the 
option for post-meal dosing in situations when dosing at the start of the meal is not suitable or possible 
(e.g., when the size, composition or timing of the meal is unpredictable) or when patients are anxious 
about potential hypoglycaemia from pre-meal dosing.  
Compared to NovoRapid, faster aspart contains two additional excipients: nicotinamide (also known as 
niacinamide or vitamin B3) and L-arginine hydrochloride (an amino acid). The addition of nicotinamide 
results in a faster initial absorption of insulin aspart following subcutaneous (s.c.) injection, leading to a 
greater early glucose-lowering effect compared to NovoRapid. The addition of L-arginine hydrochloride 
supports stabilisation of the faster aspart formulation. The insulin aspart molecule in faster aspart and 
NovoRapid is identical and therefore, once systemically absorbed, it has the same biological action at the 
insulin receptor as that of NovoRapid.  
Diabetes mellitus in paediatric subjects 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is among the most common chronic diseases in children and 
adolescents. T1DM accounts for over 90% of all childhood and adolescent diabetes. Subjects with T1DM 
require lifelong treatment with insulin.  
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is becoming increasingly common in adolescents, particularly in the 
peripubertal period although the disease remains relatively rare apart from in minority populations. 
Available data suggest that preadolescent children are unlikely to have T2DM even if obese. Due to the 
progressive nature of T2DM, the majority of subjects will eventually require insulin therapy to achieve 
targets for glycaemic control once beta-cell function deteriorates and insulin deficiency increases. 
The challenge to obtain good glycaemic control in the absence of hypoglycaemia is greater in a paediatric 
population compared to an adult population due to growth, more variable lifestyle, need of assistance 
with insulin injection and hormonal changes. A basal-bolus insulin regimen is generally recommended for 
paediatric T1DM subjects aiming at resembling physiological insulin secretion.   
Preferable, rapid-acting insulin analogues like faster aspart should be given immediately before meals. 
However, a significant proportion of people with diabetes regularly need to take their dose of bolus insulin 
either during or after a meal despite glycaemic control having a positive association with administration 
before the meal. Thus, there is an unmet medical need for a bolus insulin that allows subjects greater 
flexibility through the option of post-meal dosing. In the ISPAD 2018 guideline, the need for the option to 
dose after meal start is recognised, and it states that rapid acting insulin analogues may be given after 
the meal if needed, e.g., in toddlers and infants where the size and composition of a meal cannot be 
accurately predicted in advance.  
Paediatric development programme 
The clinical development programme for faster aspart in paediatric subjects consisted of one clinical 
pharmacology trial (trial 3888) and one therapeutic confirmatory trial (trial 4101). The clinical trial report 
for trial 3888 was submitted as part of the Marketing authorisation application (MAA), and the clinical trial 
report for trial 4101 has been submitted as a post-authorisation measure as an Article-46 paediatric 
study submission (EMEA/H/C/4046 P46 002).  
In addition, a clinical pharmacology trial, trial 4371, with similar trial design and objectives as that of trial 
3888 was conducted in alignment with recommendations from the FDA. From this trial, only safety results 
as well as the pharmacodynamic results from the meal test are included in the present application. The 
Assessment report

clinical trial report has been submitted as a post-authorisation measure as an Article-46 paediatric study 
submission. 
Objective and rationale 
The purpose of this application is to update the current prescribing information to include specific 
information on the use of faster aspart in children from 1 year and above with diabetes mellitus.  
Prior to initiation of the paediatric trials included in this application, the MAH consulted with the 
Committee for medicinal products for human use (EMA/H/SA/2136/FU/1/2013/III) and obtained 
agreement that the proposed trials would support the paediatric indication for faster aspart including 
children from 1 year of age and above with diabetes mellitus. 
The clinical trials were conducted in children and adolescents with T1DM. Insulin treatment may be 
required to achieve good glycaemic control in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and 
insulin , together with metformin, are the only approved drugs for the treatment of diabetes in this 
population. According to the EMA diabetes guideline, additional data in paediatric patients with T2DM may 
not be needed if efficacy and safety of a novel insulin is demonstrated in adults with T2DM and in children 
with T1DM. As part of the clinical development programme for faster aspart, 2 therapeutic confirmatory 
trials in adult subjects with T2DM were conducted: trial 3853 in which 689 bolus insulin-naïve subjects 
were treated for 26 weeks with faster aspart versus NovoRapid in a basal-bolus regimen with a trial 
design comparable to that of trial 4101, and trial 4049 in which 236 bolus insulin-naïve subjects were 
treated with faster aspart + basal vs. basal only treatment. Both trials demonstrated that faster aspart 
was efficacious and safe in adult subjects with T2DM. This issue was discussed in the Scientific Advice and 
the CHMP agreed that this type of extrapolation (to children with T2DM, based on efficacy and safety 
having been demonstrated in adults with T2DM and in children and adolescents with T1DM) would be in 
line with the EMA diabetes guideline. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Insulin aspart is a protein consisting of amino acids derived from a biological system and therefore 
expected to be readily biodegradable. On this basis Novo Nordisk conclude that the use of Fiasp for 
treatment of diabetes is unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. This is agreed.  
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections to approval of the Type II variation from a non-clinical point of view. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Two clinical pharmacology trials have been conducted in paediatric patients; trial 3888 and trial 4371. 
Trial 3888 was submitted with the initial MAA and is not further described in this AR. Study 4371, with a 
similar trial design and objectives, is described below. 
Study 4371 was a randomised, single-centre, double-blind, single-dose, two-period cross-over trial 
investigating the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of faster aspart and NovoRapid in 
children (n=12), adolescents (n=16) and adults (n=15) with T1DM. Each subject was randomly allocated 
to a treatment sequence consisting of two dosing visits during which the subject received a single 
subcutaneous dose of either faster aspart or NovoRapid at a predefined fixed dose level (0.2 U/kg BW) in 
connection to intake of a standardised meal (meal test). The mean age was 10.0 years in the children age 
group (range 7-11 years), 14.9 in the adolescent group (range 12-17 years) and 19.7 in the adult group 
(range 18-23 years). 
Age group comparisons (children vs adults, adolescents vs adults) 
The age group comparisons showed similar pattern for insulin aspart as for NovoRapid. 
Total insulin exposure 
Based on free insulin aspart measurements, the total exposure (AUCIAsp,free,0-12h) after administration 
of faster aspart was 29% lower in children and 13% lower in adolescents compared to adults, Figure 1 
and Table 1.

concentration, faster aspart (IAspfree). 
Early insulin exposure 
For all AUCs covering the first 90 minutes after administration of faster aspart, early exposure based on 
free insulin aspart measurements in children and adolescents was not statistically significantly different 
from that in adults. There was a tendency towards lower exposure in children and adolescents compared 
to that in adults, which became statistically significant at 2 h after drug administration, Table 2.

(IAspfree). 
Onset of insulin exposure 
The onset of appearance for free insulin aspart after administration of faster aspart in children (4.2 min) 
and in adolescents (4.4 min) was not statistically significantly different from that for adults (3.7 min). The 
time to 50% Cmax in children (19.7 min) and in adolescents (20.9 min) was no statistically significantly 
different form that in adults (18.6 min). 
Treatment group comparison (faster aspart versus NovoRapid) 
Total insulin exposure 
Based on the free insulin aspart measurements, the total insulin exposure (AUCIAsp, 0−12h) and the 
maximum observed free insulin aspart concentration (Cmax) were comparable for faster aspart and 
NovoRapid (treatment ratios: 0.99 [0.88; 1.11]95% CI and 1.01 [0.83; 1.23]95% CI, respectively). 
Onset of insulin exposure 
In children, the onset of appearance for free insulin aspart was 5.0 minutes earlier for faster aspart (4.2 
minutes) compared to NovoRapid (9.2 minutes). The time to 50% Cmax for free insulin aspart was 6.4 
minutes earlier for faster aspart (19.7 minutes) compared to NovoRapid® (26.2 minutes). 
In adolescents, the onset of appearance for free insulin aspart was 2.4 minutes earlier for faster aspart 
(4.4 minutes) compared to NovoRapid (6.8 minutes). The time to 50% Cmax for free insulin aspart was 
6.6 minutes earlier for faster aspart (20.9 minutes) compared to NovoRapid® (27.5 minutes). 
Early insulin exposure 
Insulin exposure based on free insulin aspart measurements was approximately 3.6 times greater in 
children for faster aspart compared to NovoRapid® during the first 15 minutes (AUCIAsp 0-15min) after 
trial product administration ( 
Figure 2). This result was statistically significant. There was a trend towards greater exposure for faster 
aspart compared to NovoRapid for AUCIAsp, 0-30 min, AUCIAsp, 0-1h, and AUCIAsp, 0-90min, although 
these differences were not statistically significant. Insulin exposure based on free insulin aspart 
measurements was comparable at 2 hours (AUCIAsp, 0-2h) after trial product administration.

Children (IAspfree) 
Insulin exposure based on free insulin aspart measurements was approximately 2.3 times greater in 
adolescents for faster aspart compared to NovoRapid® during the first 15 minutes and approximately 1.6 
times greater during the first 30 minutes after trial product administration (Figure 3). These results were 
statistically significant. There was a trend towards greater exposure for faster aspart compared to 
NovoRapid® for AUCIAsp, 0-1h, and AUCIAsp, 0-90min, although these differences were not statistically 
significant. Insulin exposure based on free insulin aspart measurements was comparable at 2 hours 
(AUCIAsp, 0-2h) after trial product administration.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Two studies providing PD data in paediatric subjects were submitted in support of the present application. 
Trial 3888 was submitted as part of the MAA. Only the pharmacodynamic (PD) results from the meal test 
in this study are described in the present application.  
In addition, a clinical pharmacology trial with similar design and objectives as that of trial 3888, was 
conducted; trial 4371.  
Both trial 3888 and trial 4371 were single dose cross-over studies investigating pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic properties of faster aspart and NovoRapid in children, adolescents and adults. 
Study 3888 
This single-centre cross-over study included 40 subjects and compared the pharmacodynamic properties 
of faster aspart and NovoRapid administered as a single subcutaneous injection (0.2 U/kg) immediately 
before a standardised meal in subjects with T1DM. For further details of this study, please refer to the 
EPAR for the MAA for Fiasp (EMEA/H/C/004046/0000). 
The age range of the included subjects was 9 – 25 years. Pharmacodynamic properties were studied with 
plasma glucose sampled during a 12-hour period following a standardised meal. To describe the early and 
Assessment report  
EMA/400065/2019 
Page 11/78 
  
  
 
 
 
total effect of faster aspart, the average postprandial plasma glucose increment during time, and the 
plasma glucose concentrations at 1 and 2 hours after start of the meal, were used. 
The estimated mean PPG increment over 2 hours (ΔPGav, 0-2h) with faster aspart in adults was 2.36 
mmol/L with faster aspart and 2.93 mmol/L with NovoRapid. The estimated treatment difference between 
faster aspart and NovoRapid for ΔPGav, 0-2h was not statistically significantly different (-0.57 mmol/L [-
1.83; 0.69]95% CI). The treatment difference (faster aspart – NovoRapid) in mean PPG increment over 1 
hour (ΔPGav, 0-1h) (-0.31mmol/L [-1.48; 0.86]95% CI) was smaller than at 2 hours.  
The estimated mean changes from baseline in PG during the first and second hours of the meal test 
(ΔPGav, 0-1h and ΔPGav, 0-2h) were similar between children (9-11 years) and adults (18-25 years) but 
tended to be larger for adolescents (13-17 years) compared to adults, though this difference was not 
statistically significant. 
The mean PG level did not differ significantly between children and adults at 1 hour and at 2 hours.  
With regards to the mean changes in PG levels, adolescents tended to have higher PG levels than adults 
at both 1 hour and 2 hours, but these differences were not statistically significant.  
A test for interaction between age group and treatment showed that the age group effect did not differ 
significantly between the treatments for the pharmacodynamic endpoints.  
Study 4371 - Pharmacodynamic profiles – age group comparison – faster aspart 
In study 4371, the PG concentration was measured over a period of 12 hours following the administration 
of a single dose of faster aspart given in connection with a standardised meal. 
Seven (7) subjects (3 children and 4 adults) who were administered faster aspart received oral 
carbohydrate interventions during the meal test. No interventions were made during the first 60 minutes 
following trial product administration, and the majority of interventions in children and adults occurred 
between 120 minutes and 180 minutes. As 25.0% of children and 26.7% of adults received oral 
carbohydrate with the faster aspart treatment, the secondary endpoints of mean change in PG 
concentration from 0 to 6 hours after trial product administration and minimum PG levels were affected, 
as well as the 0 to 6 hour PG profiles. 
In evaluation of the PG-lowering effect of the trial products, it is therefore more relevant to consider the 
PD endpoints covering the first 2 hours of the meal test. No insulin or glucose infusions were given as 
intervention during the meal test. 
Mean baseline adjusted PG profiles for all age groups for faster aspart from 0 to 120 minutes are shown 
in Figure 4. During the first 2 hours after administration of faster aspart, the PG profile for children and 
adolescents appeared to be higher compared to that for adults.

analysis set) 
Glucose-lowering effect – age group comparison – faster aspart 
The one-hour glucose-lowering effect estimated by the change from baseline in PG (ΔPG1h) was not 
statistically significantly different between children and adults (age group difference: 1.13 [-1.63; 
3.88]95% CI), or between adolescents and adults (age group difference: 1.52 [-0.05; 3.09]95% CI). 
Also, the two-hour glucose-lowering effect was not statistically significantly different between children 
and adults (age group difference: 1.93 [-0.92; 4.79]95% CI) but was statistically significantly lower in 
adolescents compared to adults (age group difference: 3.06 [0.83; 5.29]95% CI). The PG mean change 
endpoints (ΔPGav,0-1h and ΔPGav,0-2h) showed similar results. 
The maximum PG excursion from 0 to 6 hours (ΔPGmax) was not statistically significantly different 
between children and adults (age group difference: 1.61 [-0.51; 3.73]95% CI), or between adolescents 
and adults (age group difference: 1.91 [0.24; 3.58]95% CI). 
Pharmacodynamic profiles – treatment comparison – faster aspart vs NovoRapid 
For all three age groups, the PG profiles for the first 2 hours were lower for faster aspart than for 
NovoRapid indicating a greater glucose-lowering effect with faster aspart compared to NovoRapid. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Two clinical pharmacology trials have been conducted in paediatric patients; trial 3888 and trial 4371. 
Trial 3888 was submitted with the initial MAA and is only briefly described in this AR.  
Study 4371 included children from 7 years of age, adolescents and adults. Pharmacokinetic data show 
that total exposure was 29% lower in children and 13% lower in adolescents compared to adults. Cmax 
was 12% and 13% lower in children and adolescents respectively, compared to adults. A similar pattern 
was seen for NovoRapid. The difference between children and adolescents compared to adults is not 
considered clinically relevant since insulin is individually titrated.

Faster aspart showed an earlier onset of exposure and a higher early insulin exposure whilst maintaining 
a similar total exposure and maximum concentration compared to NovoRapid across all age groups. 
With regards to the PD, 1-hour PG-lowering effect did not differ between children and adults or between 
adolescents and adults. However, the 2-hour PG-lowering effect was lower in adolescents compared to 
adults. For NovoRapid, the age group comparison for PD parameters showed similar pattern of results as 
seen for faster aspart. When faster aspart was compared to NovoRapid, both the 1-hour and 2-hour PG 
lowering effect was greater with faster aspart than with NovoRapid across all age groups. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The results provided with study 4371are well in accordance with the results from the previous paediatric 
study, 3888, included in the initial MAA. The pharmacodynamic data indicate that the glucose lowering 
effect of Fiasp is comparable in children, adolescents and adults.

2.4.1.  Main study 
“Efficacy and Safety of Faster-acting Insulin Aspart compared to NovoRapid 
both in Combination with Insulin Degludec in Children and Adolescents with 
Type 1 Diabetes” - NN1218-4101 
Methods 
The trial compared effect and safety of mealtime faster aspart versus mealtime NovoRapid, both in 
combination with insulin degludec once daily in a basal-bolus regimen, in subjects with T1DM aged 1 year 
to less than 18 years of age. The trial also included a 26-week open-label post-meal faster aspart dosing 
group in combination with insulin degludec.  
The trial design is shown schematically in Figure 5. 
The total trial duration for each subject was approximately 45 weeks: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
up to 2 weeks for screening 
a 12-week run-in period (optimising the insulin degludec dose) 
a 26-week treatment period 
a 7-day and a 30-day follow-up period 
12-week run-in period 
At visit 2, eligible subjects were enrolled in a 12-week run-in period and switched from their previous 
insulin treatment to insulin degludec once daily and mealtime NovoRapid. In this period, the investigator 
optimised the basal insulin on a weekly basis to individual FPG targets (Figure 5). 
26-week treatment period 
Subjects with HbA1c ≤ 9.5% (80 mmol/mol) who based on the investigators judgement had shown ability 
and willingness to adhere to the trial protocol were randomised (1:1:1) to receive mealtime faster aspart, 
post-meal faster aspart or mealtime NovoRapid, all in combination with insulin degludec (Figure 5). 
In the 26-week treatment period, the investigator optimised the bolus insulin to individual pre-meal 
targets, in accordance with the titration guideline, as described in the trial protocol. Adjustment of basal

insulin dose was to be minimized during the treatment phase; however, basal insulin dose could be 
adjusted at the investigator’s discretion if needed. Glycaemic pre-meal targets of 4.0-8.0 mmol/L (71-145 
mg/dL) and glycaemic bedtime targets of 6.7-10.0 mmol/L (120-180 mg/dL) were to be attempted 
achieved as described in protocol. 
Figure 5 Trial design 
Study participants 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the trial were chosen to allow enrolment of subjects from the 
intended target population in terms of baseline demographics, comorbidities, duration and severity of 
diabetes. Eligible subjects were 1 to less than 18 years of age (In Serbia: 2 to less than 18 years) with 
T1DM, treated on a basal-bolus insulin regimen and using a basal insulin analogue or NPH insulin for at 
least 90 days prior to screening with a total daily dose of insulin ≤2.0 U/kg prior to screening, and with 
HbA1c ≤9.5 mmol/L (80 mmol/mol) at screening. Subjects had to fulfil an additional randomisation 
criterion related to their HbA1c levels measured two weeks prior to randomisation: HbA1c ≤9.5%. This 
criterion was set with the aim to select a trial population, which could be expected to be compliant with 
the trial regimen and could achieve adequate basal insulin coverage in the 12-week run-in basal insulin 
titration period where focus was not on bolus titration. 
Treatments 
The following investigational medical products (IMPs) were used in this trial: 
•  Basal insulin: Insulin degludec 
•  Bolus insulin: Faster aspart (test product) or NovoRapid (active comparator) 
At selected sites, a subgroup of subjects wore a blinded CGM device. Subjects were not allowed to wear 
their own real time CGM during the run-in or treatment periods. 
Basal insulin 
Timing of dosing: All subjects received insulin degludec as basal insulin from visit 2 (run-in) and 
throughout the treatment period. Administration of insulin degludec was once-daily, preferably at the 
same time every day. 
Assessment report  
EMA/400065/2019 
Page 15/78 
  
  
 
Dose: The titration guideline in the trial protocol was followed and titration was based on the SMPG 
profiles recorded by subjects, with no maximum dose specified: 
•  At visit 2, all subjects were switched from their previous basal insulin analogue or NPH insulin to 
insulin degludec. 
•  During the 12-week run-in period, basal insulin was titrated by the investigator on a weekly basis 
to the pre-breakfast glycaemic target of 4.0-8.0 mmol/L (71-145 mg/dL). 
•  During the 26-week treatment period, adjustment at the discretion of the investigator was 
allowed if needed. 
Bolus insulin 
Timing of dosing: In the run-in period, all subjects received NovoRapid as bolus insulin. In the treatment 
period, subjects received mealtime faster aspart, post-meal faster aspart or mealtime NovoRapid as bolus 
insulin according to their randomisation: 
•  Mealtime dosing was defined as injecting 0-2 minutes before the meal. 
• 
Post-meal dosing was defined as injecting 20 minutes after the start of the meal. 
Administration of bolus insulin (faster aspart or NovoRapid) was done for each of the 3 main meals (i.e., 
breakfast, lunch and main evening meal). Additional bolus dosing was allowed at the discretion of the 
investigator. 
Dose: The titration guideline in the trial protocol was followed and titration was based on the SMPG 
profiles recorded by subjects with no maximum dose specified: 
•  At visit 2, all subjects were switched from their pre-trial bolus insulin to mealtime NovoRapid. 
Subjects received diabetes training including training in carbohydrate counting. NovoRapid was 
only adjusted during the run-in period if the investigator found it necessary for safety reasons. 
•  At randomisation (visit 14), subjects were randomised 1:1:1 to receive mealtime faster aspart, 
post-meal faster aspart or mealtime NovoRapid. 
• 
In the 26-week treatment period, the bolus insulin was titrated to the pre-meal target of 4.0−8.0 
mmol/L (71–145 mg/dL), and the bed-time target of 6.7–10 mmol/L (120−180 mg/dL) in a treat-
to-target fashion. Subjects were instructed to titrate the bolus insulin doses using the principles of 
flexible bolus dosing based on the meal carbohydrate content or to use the pre-defined bolus 
dosing algorithms.

Sample size 
The primary objective of the trial was to confirm the effect of treatment with mealtime faster aspart in 
terms of glycaemic control measured by change from baseline in HbA1c 26 weeks after randomisation by 
comparing it to treatment with mealtime NovoRapid, both in combination with insulin degludec, using a 
non-inferiority approach in children and adolescents with T1DM. The sample size was determined using a 
non-inferiority limit of 0.4%. 
The trial also aimed to confirm the effect of treatment with post-meal faster aspart as measured by 
change from baseline in HbA1c 26 weeks after randomisation and to confirm superiority of mealtime 
faster aspart, both in combination with insulin degludec in children and adolescents with T1DM. This was 
done using a hierarchical testing procedure with 3 steps. 
The sample size was determined to ensure sufficient power for the first step and the second step in the 
hierarchical testing procedure. 
Assessment report  
EMA/400065/2019 
Page 17/78 
  
  
Power for the non-inferiority steps were based on a t-statistic under the assumption of a one-sided test of 
size 2.5%. A zero mean treatment difference for the comparison between mealtime faster aspart and 
mealtime NovoRapid was expected, and for the comparison of post-meal faster aspart and mealtime 
NovoRapid a mean difference of 0.05% in favour of mealtime NovoRapid was expected. 
Based on experience from previous trials, and taking into account that the in-trial observation period 
included data collected after treatment discontinuation, the SD for change in HbA1c was assumed to be 
1.3%. With this SD, a sample size of 250 subjects per group (750 in total) ensured more than 93% 
power to show non-inferiority, given that the actual treatment difference was 0%. This sample size 
ensured a power of 85% to show non-inferiority of post-meal faster aspart compared to mealtime 
NovoRapid. 
The number of subjects to prematurely discontinue trial product was expected to be less than 10% based 
on previous trials. The number of subjects to withdraw from the trial was expected to be less than 5%. 
Sample size calculation for the continuous glucose monitoring and meal test subgroup 
The CGM and meal test subgroup was included in the trial in order to compare additional assessments for 
evaluation of postprandial and overall glucose regulation between the treatment groups. As this additional 
assessment was exploratory in nature, this subgroup was not strictly powered to demonstrate a statistical 
significant difference between treatment groups in any particular endpoint. In all, 50 subjects per 
treatment group was chosen as this number was considered enough to provide sufficient information for 
evaluation in this exploratory analysis, and as this was a similar number to what had been included in 
previous trials using CGM subgroups. 
Randomisation 
Subjects with HbA1c ≤ 9.5% (80 mmol/mol) who based on the investigators judgement had shown ability 
and willingness to adhere to the trial protocol were randomised (1:1:1) to receive mealtime faster aspart, 
post-meal faster aspart or mealtime NovoRapid, all in combination with insulin degludec. The 
randomisation was stratified by age group (1≤ age < 3 years, 3≤ age <6 years, 6≤ age <12 years and 
12≤ age <18 years) based on subject’s age at randomisation. 
Blinding (masking) 
Rationale for the method of treatment assignment and blinding 
It was not considered feasible to blind the post-meal arm due to the high number of injections required to 
make a double-blind, double dummy trial and increased burden on the subjects; as such, a partly double-
blind trial design was chosen. 
The bolus treatment was double-blind for the mealtime faster aspart and NovoRapid treatment groups 
and open-label for the post-meal faster aspart treatment group. According to standard pharmacovigilance 
procedures, specific members of the Novo Nordisk A/S Global Safety department were not blinded to 
SUSARs (for reporting purpose), whereas the clinical study group and the investigator remained blinded 
throughout the trial. 
The treatment code for a particular subject could be broken in a medical emergency if knowing the actual 
treatment would influence the treatment of the subject. If the code was broken, the subject was to 
discontinue trial product and a discontinuation of trial product session was to be completed in IV/WRS. 
The blind was unintentionally broken for one subject in the mealtime faster aspart group. 
A subgroup of subjects (150 in total), age ≥ 8 years old at screening (visit 1) had blinded CGM and a 
standardised meal test at 2 occasions during the trial.

Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
• 
• 
Full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomised subjects. In exceptional cases randomised subjects 
could have been excluded from the FAS. In such cases the reason for exclusion was to be justified 
and documented. Subjects in the FAS contributed to the evaluation ‘as randomised’. 
Per protocol (PP) analysis set includes all subjects in the FAS that comply with inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. Subjects in the PP set contributed to the evaluation “as treated”. 
Primary endpoint 
Change from baseline in HbA1c 26 weeks after randomisation. 
Primary estimand 
Treatment difference between faster aspart and NovoRapid, assessed by change from baseline in HbA1c 
26 weeks after randomisation for all randomised subjects, regardless of treatment discontinuation or use 
of ancillary therapies. The primary estimand was assessed using the in-trial observation period, which 
included data collected after a subject discontinued trial product. 
Secondary estimand 
Treatment difference between faster aspart and NovoRapid, assessed by change from baseline in HbA1c 
26 weeks after randomisation for all randomised subjects, if subjects continued on treatment until 26 
weeks. The secondary estimand was assessed using the on-treatment observation period. 
Efficacy endpoints except insulin dose were based on the in-trial observation period and repeated using 
the on-treatment observation period. Insulin dose and all safety endpoints were based on on-treatment 
observation period. The hierarchical testing procedure below was performed under the framework of the 
primary estimand. 
Hierarchical testing procedure and analysis used for the primary endpoint 
The primary objective was addressed using a non-inferiority approach to compare the change from 
baseline in HbA1c 26 weeks after randomisation between mealtime faster aspart and mealtime NovoRapid 
(non-inferiority limit 0.4%). If the primary objective was confirmed (step 1), type I error rate was 
controlled by using a hierarchical (fixed sequence) testing approach to address the secondary 
confirmatory objectives of non-inferiority of post-meal faster aspart vs mealtime NovoRapid (step 2), 
respectively superiority of mealtime faster aspart vs mealtime NovoRapid (step 3). Accordingly, rejection 
of the null hypothesis was confirmed only for steps where all previous null hypotheses had been rejected 
in favour of faster aspart. 
Analysis was based on a statistical model using multiple imputations where the subjects without any 
available HbA1c measurements at scheduled visits had their HbA1c value imputed from the available 
information from the treatment the subject had been randomised to (resembling in essence a mixed 
model of repeated measurements analysis). Analyses were adjusted for region, strata (age), as factors, 
and baseline HbA1c as a covariate. 
Key supportive secondary analyses 
Change from baseline in 8-point self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) profile endpoints: Change from 
baseline in mean PPG and PPG increment over all three meals were analysed using a model similar to the 
primary endpoint except with the corresponding baseline value as covariate.

Safety endpoints 
A treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as an event that had an onset date on or after the first 
day of exposure to randomised treatment, and no later than seven days after the last day of randomised 
treatment.  
A hypoglycaemic episode was defined as treatment-emergent if the onset of the episode occurred on or 
after the first day of IMP administration after randomisation and no later than one day after the last day 
on IMP. Hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as nocturnal if the time of the onset was between 23:00 
and 07:00 both included. Severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode that was 
severe according to the ISPAD criterion or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose value <3.1 mmol/L (56 
mg/dL) with or without symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. The number of treatment-emergent 
severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes (all, daytime, nocturnal) were analysed using a negative 
binomial regression model with a log-link function and the logarithm of the time period for which a 
hypoglycaemic episode was considered treatment emergent as offset. The model included treatment, 
region and strata (age) as factors, and was based on the FAS. Where data allowed, separate analyses 
were performed for severe episodes. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Run-in period 
A total of 834 subjects entered the run-in period of the trial. Of those, 57 subjects were run-in failure. 
Thus, 777 subjects were later randomised to the treatment period. The most common reason for failure 
during the run-in period was ‘failure to meet randomisation criteria’ (31 subjects).  During the run-in 
period subjects were treated with insulin degludec once daily and mealtime NovoRapid. 
Randomisation and completion 
In all, 777 subjects were assigned to the 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio: mealtime faster aspart (260 
subjects), post-meal faster aspart (259 subjects) and NovoRapid (258 subjects). All 777 randomised 
subjects were exposed to trial product (Table 3).  
A total of 760 (97.8%) of the randomised subjects completed the trial period: 256 (98.5%) of the 
subjects in the mealtime faster aspart group, 251 (96.9%) of the subjects in the post-meal faster aspart 
group and 253 (98.1%) of the subjects in the NovoRapid group.  
A similar proportion of subjects completed both the trial and treatment period in each treatment group 
(Table 3).

Table 3 Subject disposition  
Age groups 
As a consequence of the small number of subjects below 3 years of age (n=4, two each in the faster 
aspart groups), only results for the age groups 1 to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years and 12 to < 18 years are 
presented. In all, 46 subjects in the age group 1 to < 6 years, 301 subjects in the age group 6 to < 12 
years and 430 subjects in the age group 12 to < 18 years were randomised and exposed to treatment 
(Table 4).

Table 4 Subject disposition – summary – by age groups 
Premature discontinuation 
A total of 21 (2.7%) subjects prematurely discontinued randomised treatment: 6 (2.3%) subjects in the 
mealtime faster aspart group, 9 (3.5%) subjects in the post-meal faster aspart group and 6 (2.3%) 
subjects in the NovoRapid group (Table 3). 
The reasons for premature treatment discontinuation of trial product were ‘decision of subject’ (6 
subjects), ‘decision of parent/guardian’ (5 subjects) and ‘other’ (10 subjects). No subjects prematurely 
discontinued treatment due to an AE, a hypoglycaemic episode, a protocol violation or due to pregnancy 
(Table 3). 
The most common reason for prematurely discontinuation was due to reasons unrelated to treatment 
(mainly personal reasons).  
Withdrawals 
In total, 17 (2.2%) subjects withdrew from the trial at or after randomisation: 4 (1.5%) subjects in the 
mealtime faster aspart group, 8 (3.1%) subjects in the post-meal faster aspart group and 5 (1.9%) 
subjects in the NovoRapid group. No subjects withdrew from the trial due to an AE (Table 3). 
The most frequent reason for withdrawal was ‘withdrawal by parent/guardian’ (in all 9 subjects): 4 
(1.5%) subjects in the mealtime faster aspart group, 4 (1.5%) subjects in the post-meal faster aspart 
group and 1 (0.4%) subject in the NovoRapid group. An overview of the reasons for withdrawal is shown 
in Table 3. 
Screen failures 
A total of 933 subjects were screened, of which 99 subjects were screening failures (Table 3). The 
majority of subjects (82 subjects) failed during screening because they did not meet one of the inclusion

criteria, of which the most common was inclusion criterion 7 (HbA1c was outside the allowed range) (74 
subjects).

Protocol deviations 
Important protocol deviations at trial level 
At trial level, 1 important PD belonging to the category “other” was reported. There were 4 deviations in 
the Appendix B (CGM and meal test) of the protocol version 2.0 which was discovered by monitors.  
Important protocol deviations at trial site and subject level 
There were 94 and 875 important PDs at site and subject level, respectively. The number of PDs related 
to informed consent was rather high (122). According to the MAH, the site personnel were retrained on 
the informed consent procedure and missing or incorrect informed consent forms were corrected. 
None of the PDs were by the MAH considered to have an overall impact on the trial conduct, subject 
safety or data interpretation and neither of the PDs were considered to be in violation of the defined 
estimands. 
Baseline data 
Demographics and baseline characteristics  
Overall, the 3 treatment groups were similar with respect to demographics and baseline characteristics 
(Table 6, Table 7). 
At baseline (visit 14), the mean age of the subjects was 11.68 years (range: 2−17 years). The mean 
body weight was 46.48 kg (range: 12.3−103.4 kg) and the mean BMI was 19.66 kg/m2 (range: 
11.8−33.5 kg/m2). Mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.56 % (59.13 mmol/mol) (range: 4.9−10.6 % 
(30.1−92.4 mmol/mol)). Please note, the HbA1c criterion for screening and randomisation (HbA1c 
≤ 9.5 %), was based on HbA1c values measured at screening and visit 12. The mean HbA1c at visit 1 
was 7.71 % (range: 5.1−9.5 %) and 7.59 % (range: 4.9−9.5 %) at visit 12. Mean FPG was 7.81 mmol/L 
(140.66 mg/dL) (range: 1.1−21.3 mmol/L (18.9−384.0 mg/dL)). The mean duration of diabetes was 
4.38 years (range: 0.5−16.3 years). 
In all, 464 of 777 subjects used flexible dosing (carbohydrate counting) at baseline with a similar number 
of subjects in each treatment group (152, 156 and 156 subjects in the mealtime faster aspart, post-meal 
faster aspart and NovoRapid groups). Overall, 53.9% of the subjects were male. The majority of the 
subjects were White (81.3%) or Asian (16.2%) and of non-Hispanic or non-Latino ethnicity (94.2%).  
The majority of subjects were enrolled in the US (25.1%), Russia (13.4%) and Japan (8.5%).

Anti-diabetic treatment at screening 
The majority of randomised subjects received insulin glargine (50.2%) or insulin detemir (24.7%) as 
basal insulin at screening. The majority of subjects received insulin aspart (49.5%) or insulin lispro 
(28.2%) as bolus insulin at screening. There were no marked differences with regard to the anti-diabetic 
treatment at screening across the 3 treatment groups.

Diabetes complications before or at screening 
Overall, 8.1% of the randomised subjects reported one or more diabetes complications. There were no 
marked differences with regard to the diabetic complications before or at screening across the 3 
treatment groups. 
Concomitant illness and medication 
The most frequent concomitant illnesses, across treatment groups, were seen in the SOC ‘skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders’ (reported by 10.3% of the subjects; mainly related to ‘lipodystrophy 
acquired’ [2.1%] and ‘lipohypertrophy’ [1.9%]) and the SOC ‘endocrine disorders’ (reported by 8.5% of 
the subjects; mainly related to ‘autoimmune thyroiditis’ [4.1%] and ‘hypothyroidism’ [3.6%]). The 
proportion of subjects with concomitant illnesses was comparable across the 3 treatment groups. 
At baseline, the most commonly reported concomitant medications used were drugs from the categories 
‘alimentary tract and metabolism’ (8.0% of the subjects), ‘systemic hormonal preparations, excluding sex 
hormones and insulins’ (7.6% of the subjects) and ‘respiratory system’ (6.4% of the subjects). The 
proportion of subjects reporting concomitant medication at baseline was comparable across the 3 
treatment groups. 
Continuous glucose monitoring subgroup 
In all, 135 subjects aged ≥ 8 years of age at screening (visit 1) used a blinded CGM. This subgroup had 2 
standardised meal tests; one at baseline (visit 14) and another at the end-of-treatment (visit 40). 
At baseline (visit 14), the mean age of the subjects was 12.58 years (range: 8−17 years). The mean 
body weight was 51.26 kg (range: 26.4−95.2 kg) and the mean BMI was 20.35 kg/m2 (range: 
14.3−30.8 kg/m2). Mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.39 % (range: 5.4−9.4 %) and mean FPG was 
6.89 mmol/L (124.12 mg/dL) (range: 1.1−14.9 mmol/L (18.9−269.0 mg/dL)). The mean duration of 
diabetes was 4.53 years (range: 0.5−14.0 years).  
Overall, 57.8% of the subjects were male. The majority of the subjects were White (97.8%) and of non-
Hispanic or non-Latino ethnicity (95.6%). The majority of subjects were from the US (38.5%), Ukraine 
(23.7%) and Bulgaria (15.6%). 
The 3 treatment groups in the CGM subgroup were considered similar with respect to demographics and 
baseline characteristics.

Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy results 
Two estimands were defined in trial 4101 (see Statistical methods). The efficacy results in the following 
are structured around the framework of the primary estimand, focusing on the results for subjects in the 
trial, regardless of treatment adherence. Efficacy results related to the period where subjects were on 
treatment can be found in (Table 10). Results based on these 2 approaches were comparable due to the 
high completion rate and the small difference between number of subjects who discontinued treatment 
and who withdrew from trial. 
Change in HbA1c (primary endpoint) - hierarchical testing 
The results of the hierarchical testing procedure showed that mealtime faster aspart was non-inferior to 
mealtime NovoRapid, both in combination with insulin degludec, in terms of change from baseline to 26 
weeks after randomisation in HbA1c (primary endpoint; Step 1). Non-inferiority of post-meal faster aspart 
versus mealtime NovoRapid, both in combination with insulin degludec, was confirmed in terms of change 
from baseline to 26 weeks after randomisation in HbA1c (Step 2). Superiority of mealtime faster aspart 
versus mealtime NovoRapid, both in combination with insulin degludec, was confirmed in terms of change 
from baseline to 26 weeks after randomisation in HbA1c (Step 3), see Table 9.

Run-in 
During the run-in period, all subjects were treated with insulin degludec and NovoRapid. During the 14 
weeks prior to randomisation (up to 2 weeks screening and 12-week run-in), the overall observed mean 
HbA1c changed from 7.71% to 7.56%.  In subjects subsequently randomised to mealtime faster aspart 
the corresponding changes in HbA1c was from 7.76% to 7.57% (61.27 to 59.26 mmol/mol), from 7.71% 
to 7.58% (60.81 to 59.38 mmol/mol) in subjects subsequently randomised to post-meal faster aspart,

and from 7.67% to 7.53% (60.35 to 58.76 mmol/mol) in subjects subsequently randomised to mealtime 
NovoRapid (Figure 6). 
Minor changes in the observed mean HbA1c was also seen during the 14 weeks prior to randomisation in 
all 3 age groups across treatment groups. 
Week 26 
After 26 weeks of treatment, the observed mean HbA1c (at “last in-trial visit”) in the mealtime faster 
aspart group remained stable compared to baseline (from 7.57% at randomisation to 7.63% [59.88 
mmol/mol]), whereas the observed mean HbA1c increased slightly in the post-meal faster aspart (from 
7.58% to 7.91% [62.97 mmol/mol]) and NovoRapid (from 7.53% to 7.76% [61.30 mmol/mol]) groups 
compared to baseline (Figure 6). 
Figure 6 HbA1c by treatment week - observed mean and lsmean plot - in-trial (FAS) 
In the age group 6 to <12 years, all 3 treatment groups appeared stable in observed mean HbA1c from 
baseline to week 26 with no other differences between age groups observed (Figure 7, Figure 8 and 
Figure 9).

The change from baseline to week 26 in HbA1c was estimated to 0.06 %-points (0.62 mmol/mol) with 
mealtime faster aspart, 0.35 %-points (3.84 mmol/mol) with post-meal faster aspart and 0.22 %-points 
(2.44 mmol/mol) with NovoRapid (Table 11 and Figure 6). 
The estimated treatment difference 26 weeks after randomisation was -0.17 %-points (-1.82 mmol/mol) 
between mealtime faster aspart and NovoRapid and 0.13 %-points (1.40 mmol/mol) between post-meal 
faster aspart and NovoRapid (Table 11).

Table 11 HbA1c 26 weeks after randomisation  
Sensitivity analysis 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the primary analysis with regards to 
deviations from the model assumptions, by reducing the factors included (reduced model) and the 
assumption that missing data is missing at random (switch to inferior treatment, conditional switch to 
NovoRapid and unconditional switch to NovoRapid). The results of the sensitivity analyses supported the 
conclusions of the primary analysis. 
Tipping point analysis 
The robustness of the primary analysis addressing the primary estimand with regards to the MAR 
assumption was investigated using tipping point analyses. In the tipping point analysis, a multiple 
imputation model similar to the primary analysis was repeated with gradually increasing penalty added to 
imputed values at week 26 for subjects in the faster aspart arms until the non-inferiority hypotheses were 
rejected. The penalty value, also known as the tipping point, are the point at which the assumption about 
the treatment effect in subjects in the faster aspart groups with missing values at week 26 change the 
conclusion of faster aspart groups from being non-inferior to NovoRapid. 
A tipping point analysis were also performed for step three in the hierachical testing procedure, 
superiority of meal time faster aspart compared to NovoRapid, where the penalty added to the imputed 
values in the faster aspart group causing the treatment effect to not be statistically significantly different 
is the tipping point.

With penalties reaching HbA1c values that were not clinically plausible, these analyses supported the 
conclusion of the primary analysis (Table 12).

inferiority and superiority – in-trial (FAS) 
Percentage of subjects reaching HbA1c target  
For all treatment groups, the total proportion of subjects achieving the HbA1c target (< 7.5%) was higher 
at baseline (44.6%, 43.6% and 50.0%) compared to after 26 weeks of treatment (Table 13). For 
mealtime faster aspart, the proportion of subjects achieving this target increased for age group 1 to <6 
years, decreased for age group 6 to <12 years, and was stable for age group 12 to <18 years from 
baseline to after 26 weeks of treatment.  
There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of subjects achieving the HbA1c target 
26 weeks after randomisation between mealtime faster aspart and NovoRapid (OR: 1.33 [0.87; 2.01]) or 
between post-meal faster aspart and NovoRapid (OR: 0.66 [0.43; 1.02]).  
There was also no statistically significant difference between faster aspart and NovoRapid in the 
proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c targets without severe hypoglycaemic episodes 26 weeks after 
randomisation (OR: 1.37 [0.91; 2.08]95% CI and 0.68 [0.44; 1.04]95% CI).

Subjects measured the SMPG 8 times (8-point profiles) on 2 consecutive days (8-8-point profiles) prior to 
the visits at baseline (week 0), week 12 and week 26. 
At baseline, the 8-point profiles for the 3 treatment groups appeared similar. At 26 weeks after 
randomisation, the observed mean SMPG was lower at 1 hour after breakfast, lunch and main evening 
meal with mealtime faster aspart compared to NovoRapid (Figure 10). With post-meal faster aspart, the 
observed mean SMPG was higher at 1 hour after lunch and main evening meal compared to NovoRapid at 
26 weeks after randomisation. 
No major differences were observed between age groups in the 8-point profiles.

At week 26, the observed mean 1-hour PPG and 1-hour PPG increment were lower for mealtime faster 
aspart compared to NovoRapid at all individual meals (breakfast, lunch and evening meal) and for “all 
meals”, while the post-meal faster aspart group showed higher 1-hour PPGs and PPG increments 
compared to NovoRapid. 
•  1-hour PPG mean over all meals was 9.26 mmol/L (166.82 mg/dL) for mealtime faster aspart, 
10.50 mmol/L (189.23 mg/dL) for post-meal faster aspart, and 9.98 mmol/L (179.77 mg/dL) for 
NovoRapid.

Fasting plasma glucose 
The mean FPG was fairly stable between baseline and week 26 for all 3 treatment groups. At baseline, the 
observed mean FPG was 7.58 mmol/L (136.67 mg/dL) with mealtime faster aspart, 8.03 mmol/L (144.61 
mg/dL) with post-meal faster aspart and 7.79 mmol/L (140.43 mg/dL) with NovoRapid. At week 26, the 
observed mean FPG was 7.80 mmol/L (140.60 mg/dL) with mealtime faster aspart, 7.93 mmol/L (142.85 
mg/dL) with “post-meal faster aspart” and 7.88 mmol/L (142.03 mg/dL) with NovoRapid (Figure 11). 
There was no statistically significant difference between mealtime faster aspart and NovoRapid or post-
meal faster aspart and NovoRapid in the change from baseline to week 26 in FPG. 
No major differences between age groups in estimated change from baseline in FPG 26 weeks after 
randomisation was observed (data not shown in the AR)

1,5-anhydroglucitol 
From baseline to week 26, the observed mean 1,5-anhydroglucitol was stable for mealtime faster aspart 
(from 4.95 to 4.89 μg/mL) and decreased for post-meal faster aspart (from 5,07 to 4.25 μg/mL) and 
NovoRapid (from 5.13 to 4.50 μg/mL).  
The estimated change from baseline to week 26 in 1,5-anhydroglucitol was -0.07, -0.89, 
and -0.60 μg/mL for mealtime faster aspart, post-meal faster aspart and NovoRapid, respectively. The 
change from baseline to week 26 in 1.5-anhydroglucitol with mealtime faster aspart was statistically 
significantly different from that with NovoRapid (ETD: 0.52 μg/mL [0.09; 0.95]95% CI), whereas no 
statistically significant difference was found for the decrease from baseline to week 26 with post-meal 
faster aspart and NovoRapid (ETD: -0.29 μg/mL [-0.73; 0.14]95% CI). 
Insulin dose 
At week 26, subjects in the three treatment groups were treated with similar doses (U/kg) of daily bolus, 
daily basal, and total daily insulin doses:

The mean daily bolus insulin dose at week 26 was 23.3 U (0.48 U/kg) for mealtime faster aspart, 
23.5 U (0.49 U/kg) for post-meal faster as part and 22.5 U (0.47 U/kg) for NovoRapid. No 
apparent differences between treatment groups were identified among the observed doses at 
each main meal. 
The mean daily basal insulin dose at week 26 was 21.6 U (0.43 U/kg) for mealtime faster aspart, 
21.5 U (0.43 U/kg) for post-meal faster as part and 20.7 U (0.41 U/kg) for NovoRapid. 
The mean daily total insulin dose at week 26 was 44.8 U (0.92 U/kg) for mealtime faster aspart, 
45.0 U (0.92 U/kg) for post-meal faster as part and 43.2 U (0.88 U/kg) for NovoRapid. 
At week 26, the mean basal: bolus split ratio was similar between treatment groups (47: 53 for mealtime 
faster aspart, 47: 53 for post-meal faster aspart and 46: 54 for NovoRapid).

Two estimands were used in this trial for the primary endpoint; the primary 
estimand addressed the effect of trial drug irrespective of whether randomised 
subjects were treated as directed or not. The secondary estimand addressed 
the effect of trial drug had all randomised subjects taken the treatment as 
directed. Results based on these two approaches were comparable due a high 
completion rate and a small difference between number of subjects who 
discontinued treatment and who withdrew from trial.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
The aim of the current submission is to provide data in support of a paediatric indication for faster aspart 
(Fiasp).  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study 4101 data is a 26-week, randomised, partly double-blind, multicentre, multinational, active 
controlled, treat-to-target, 3-armed parallel-group trial with a 12-week run-in period, conducted to 
support the use of Fiasp for the treatment of children aged 1 year and above with diabetes mellitus. The 
trial compared effect and safety of mealtime faster aspart versus mealtime NovoRapid, both in 
combination with insulin degludec once daily in a basal-bolus regimen, in subjects with T1DM aged 1 year 
to less than 18 years of age. The overall study design is in line with the Scientific advice given by the 
CHMP in 2013, with the exception that the basal insulin has been changed from insulin detemir to insulin 
degludec which was approved after the SA was given. The choice of basal insulin is acceptable as insulin 
degludec is approved in children from the age of 1 year. All insulins were administered according to label. 
Fiasp was administered according to the recommendations approved for the adult population. Titration 
algorithms were in place. 
The trial also included a 26-week open-label post-meal faster aspart dosing group in combination with 
insulin degludec. Furthermore, a subgroup of children aged > 8 years took part in a CGM substudy 
investigating the effects of Fiasp and NovoRapid in relation to a standardised meal test. This is also in line 
with the SA (EMEA/H/SA/2136/1/FU/1/2013/III) as extrapolation from the data on post-meal dosing and 
effects on PPG after a standardised meal test in adults was not accepted by the CHMP. 
The study design is considered adequate and the study duration, including the run-in period, is 
considered sufficient to evaluate the effect of Fiasp in comparison with NovoRapid in children aged 1 to 18 
years of age. 
Statistical methods are generally acceptable. The non-inferiority margin applied is not entirely endorsed 
as 0.4% is generally considered too wide, it may however be accepted for planning purposes. For control 
of the family-wise type I error rate a hierarchical (fixed sequence) testing procedure with three steps was 
used including in step 1) non-inferiority of meal-time fast-acting insulin aspart versus meal-time 
NovoRapid, in step 2) non-inferiority of post-meal fast-acting insulin aspart versus meal-time NovoRapid 
and in step 3) superiority of meal-time fast-acting insulin aspart versus meal-time NovoRapid. Rejection 
of a null hypothesis was only to be confirmed for analyses where all previous null hypotheses had been 
rejected in favour of fast-acting insulin aspart. This multiplicity approach is acceptable. 
A primary and a secondary estimand was defined. The primary estimand used for confirmatory analyses 
was defined according to a “treatment-policy” strategy ignoring intercurrents events (treatment 
discontinuation and ancillary treatments). This can be criticized in the non-inferiority setting in that 
responses in both treatment groups will appear more similar following discontinuation of randomised 
treatment or use of another medication. A secondary estimand was defined according to a “hypothetical”-
Assessment report

strategy aiming at estimating treatment response week 26 if all subjects adhered. For a conclusion of 
superiority, the primary estimand is acceptable; considering that two of three primary hypotheses aimed 
at non-inferiority both estimands are of interest.  
Overall, and having an impact on the analyses addressing the primary and secondary estimands, the 
majority of subjects, irrespective of randomised treatment arm, completed the 26-week treatment 
period; 254/260 (97.7%) of subjects on fast-acting insulin aspart (meal), 250/259 (96.5%) of subjects 
on fast-acting insulin aspart (post) and 252/258 (97.7%) of subjects on NovoRapid (meal). 
Four amendments were made to the protocol. Two of the 4 protocol amendments were implemented after 
the first subject first visit. None of the changes is considered to have had any impact on the trial data. 
There was a rather high number of protocol deviations related to “informed consent”. This was identified 
by the MAH and site personnel were retrained on the procedures, thus this issue was adequately handled.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In total 777 subjects were included in the study. Recruitment in the lowest age group (1 to 3 years) was 
low and no children below the age of 2 years were included in the study. Only four children aged 2-3 
years were included, all in the two faster aspart groups (2 in each groups).   
Otherwise the recruitment targets were met. A high proportion of subjects completed the trial (98%), 
with no major imbalances between treatment groups. Premature discontinuations were few and evenly 
distributed between groups. No subjects discontinued due to AEs. 
The demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between groups. European subjects were 
adequately represented. A comparable exposure was observed for all treatment groups, with no apparent 
difference when analysed by age group. 
HbA1c decreased slightly in the overall population and in all the three age groups during the 14 weeks 
run-in phase. During the randomised treatment period of the study, HbA1c remained stable in the Fiasp 
mealtime group, whereas HbA1c slightly increased in the post-meal group and in the NovoRapid group. 
The increase observed is in line with the outcome of previous paediatric studies. 
When presented by age groups, it is observed that HbA1c remained stable in all treatment groups in the 
age group 6 to <12 years. The change in HbA1c observed in the overall population was driven by the 
changes in HbA1c observed in the two other age groups, i.e. children (1 - <6 years) and adolescents (12 
- <18 years) respectively. 
The study met its primary objective as both mealtime and post-meal Fiasp was found to be non-inferior 
to NovoRapid (ETD -0.17 [-0.30; -0.03]95%CI and 0.13 [-0.01; 0.26]95%CI for mealtime and post-meal 
dosing, respectively). In both analyses the upper limit of the 95%CI was below 0.3% which is considered 
an acceptable non-inferiority margin. Mealtime Fiasp was also shown to be superior to NovoRapid with 
regards to change from baseline in HbA1c 26 weeks after randomisation (ETD: -0.17 % [-
0.30; -0.03]95% CI). The clinical relevance of this difference may be debated but considering that the 
mean HbA1c at baseline was rather low (7.56%) large improvements in HbA1c may be difficult to 
achieve. The responder rates decreased in all treatment groups over the treatment period, as expected 
since HbA1c increased during the treatment period. The outcome compares well with the data in adults 
presented in the Fiasp MAA, where both mealtime faster aspart and post-meal faster aspart was 
compared with mealtime NovoRapid (EPAR for Fiasp; Trial 3852).  
FPG remained rather stable during the study in all treatment groups. No statistically significant 
differences were observed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/400065/2019 
Page 43/78 
  
  
The 8-point SMBG profiles at week 26 differed somewhat between treatment groups. The observed mean 
1-hour PPG and 1-hour PPG increment were lower for mealtime faster aspart compared to NovoRapid at 
all individual meals (breakfast, lunch and evening meal) and for “all meals”, while the post-meal faster 
aspart group showed higher 1-hour PPGs and PPG increments compared to NovoRapid.  
For mealtime faster aspart, a statistically significant difference in favour of mealtime faster aspart over 
NovoRapid was found for change from baseline to week 26 in 1-hour PPG after breakfast, lunch, and “all 
meals”, but not for the main evening meal. The change from baseline to week 26 in 1-hour PPG 
increment was statistically significantly in favour of mealtime faster aspart after breakfast, main evening 
meal, and “all meals” but no for the lunch meal. 
For post-meal faster aspart, a statistically significant difference in favour of NovoRapid was found for 
change from baseline to week 26 in 1-hour PPG after lunch, main evening meal, and “all meals”, as well 
as for change from baseline to week 26 in 1-hour PPG increment after “all meals”.  
The data from the CGM subgroup largely confirms the data from the 8-point SMBG profiles.  
The data from the meal test show that mealtime faster aspart was comparable to NovoRapid up to 1 hour 
after the meal after which the increment was actually higher with faster aspart. None of the differences 
observed in the meal test were statistically significant. Post-meal faster aspart showed less prandial 
glucose control at all time points. The prandial IG data confirms the data on PPG and PPG increment data. 
There were no apparent differences in either daily mean bolus, basal or total insulin dose between 
treatment groups at week 26. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical data provided show that Fiasp is superior to NovoRapid when administered before the meal 
and non-inferior to NovoRapid when administered after the meal. The findings were consistent across age 
groups. Very few subjects below the age of 3 were included in the trial, but there is no concern that the 
efficacy would differ in children in this age group compared to older children, therefore the use of Fiasp 
from the age of 1 year is acceptable from an efficacy point of view. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Faster Insulin Aspart was approved for treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, in the EU in January 
2017. The active insulin component of FIASP, Insulin Aspart, has been on the market as NovoRapid 
worldwide for more 15 years for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and is approved for the treatment of 
diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 1 years (since 2016) and above. The safety 
profile is well known, with the major safety issue being hypoglycaemia. Medication errors, 
immunogenicity and lipodystrophy are also events of special interest. 
To support the safety of an extension of the indication of faster aspart for use in children and adolescents, 
clinical safety results from trial NN1218-4101 was submitted. See section 2.4.1.  Additionally, a 
pharmacology trial (4371) comparing the pharmacokinetic properties of Fiasp between children, 
adolescents and adults with T1DM and post marketing information from spontaneous reports of paediatric 
use post-marketing contribute with supportive safety data.

Patient exposure 
In trial NN1218-4101, a total of 777 subjects were assigned to the 3 treatment groups (mealtime faster 
aspart, postmeal faster aspart and mealtime NovoRapid) in a 1:1:1 ratio. All 777 randomised subjects 
were exposed to trial product; 261 subjects to mealtime faster aspart, 258 subjects to postmeal faster 
aspart and 258 subjects to NovoRapid (Table 15). The trial population included the intended paediatric 
T1DM population to be treated with faster aspart with 32 children treated with faster aspart in the age 
group 1 to <6 years, 200 subjects in the age group 6 to <12 years and 287 subjects in the age group 12 
to <18 years (Table 16).  
The total exposure was 128.4 PYE for the mealtime faster aspart group and 127.7 PYE for both the post-
meal faster aspart and NovoRapid groups (Table 15). Thus, there were no overall differences across the 3 
treatment groups with regard to extent of exposure in PYE. There was neither any differences with regard 
to extent of exposure within each age group between the 3 treatment groups ( 
Table 17). However, the total exposure in PYE, of the respective treatment was notable lower in the 1-to 
< 6 years group (8 PYE), compared to the 6 to < 12 years (approx. 50 PYE) and 12 to < 18 years age 
groups (approx. 70 PYEs). See Table 17.  
Thus, exposure in the youngest age group (1 -< 6 years) were lower compared to the other groups due 
to fewer subjects in this group.  
The vast majority of subjects in all 3 treatment groups were exposed to trial products for ≥25 weeks. In 
total, 45.7% were exposed to trial products 25-26 weeks and 51.9% were exposed > 27 weeks.  
Overall, the extent of exposure is considered acceptable for ages above 3 years. However, there was only 
four subjects treated with faster aspart in the ages below 3 years and at baseline the lowest age was 2 
years (Table 16 and Table 7). Thus, no safety data is available for subjects between 1 and 2 years and 
very limited safety data in the ages between 2 and 3 years. Besides, none subjects with T2DM were 
exposed.

Adverse events 
Overall adverse events 
The proportion of subjects with an AE during the study period was similar in the 3 treatment groups; 
73.9%, 77.1% and 78.7% of subjects in the mealtime faster aspart, post-meal faster aspart and 
NovoRapid groups respectively reported AEs. The AE rates were also similar in the different treatment 
groups (448.6, 531.1 and 464.5 per 100 PYE for mealtime faster aspart, post-meal faster aspart and 
NovoRapid respectively, Table 18). 
The majority of AEs in all 3 treatment groups were non-serious (98%) and of mild or moderate severity 
(99%). The proportion of subjects with severe AEs was comparable between the treatment groups (Table 
18). 
Across age groups, the frequency of subjects that reported an AE was slightly lower in the 1 to < 6 age 
group (58.7%) compared to the two older groups (77.4% in the 6 to<12 years group and 77.9% in the 
12 to <18 years group respectively). No systematic unexpected differences were observed between the 3 
treatment groups within each age group (Table 19)

Table 19 Adverse events – age groups – safety analysis set 
Most common adverse events 
The three most frequent AEs (by SOC) in all treatment groups were ‘infections and infestations (57.3% of 
all subjects), ‘gastrointestinal disorders’ (17.9% of all subjects) ‘respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders (14.8% of all subjects).  
Overall, no differences in frequency and rate were seen between the treatment groups; however, the 
proportion of subjects reporting AEs and the rate in the SOC ‘gastrointestinal disorders’ were higher in 
the post-meal faster aspart group (22.9%) compared with the mealtime faster aspart (14.2%) and 
NovoRapid groups (16.7%). This was mainly due to a higher frequency of ‘vomiting’ reported in the post-
meal faster aspart group (8.1% compared to 3.4% in the mealtime faster aspart group and 2.7% in the 
NovoRapid group). 
All subjects: The most frequently reported preferred terms in all 3 treatment groups was ‘viral upper 
respiratory tract infection’; reported by 23.0%, 20.5% and 18.6% of subjects in the mealtime faster 
aspart, post-meal faster aspart and NovoRapid groups respectively. Other frequently reported AEs were 
‘upper respiratory tract infection’ and ‘headache’; these AEs were reported by 8.4%, 12.4% and 10.1%; 
and by 6.1%, 10.1% and 8.5% of subjects in the mealtime faster aspart, post-meal faster aspart and 
NovoRapid groups, respectively (Figure 15). There were no clinically relevant differences across the 
treatment groups with respect to the most frequently reported AEs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/400065/2019 
Page 48/78 
  
  
 
Age groups: The most frequently reported preferred terms within the SOC ‘Infections and infestations’ 
were in the age group 1 to < 6 years: pharyngitis (10.9%) and influenza/upper respiratory tract 
infection/nasopharyngitis/ear infection (all 6.5% each), in the age group 6 to < 12 years: upper 
respiratory tract infection (10.6%) and rhinitis/influenza/gastroenteritis (7.3% each), in the age group 12 
to < 18 years:  upper respiratory tract infection (10.5%) and gastroenteritis (6.3%).  The most 
frequently reported preferred terms within the SOC ‘Gastrointestinal disorders’ were in the age group 1 to 
< 6 year: diarrhea and vomiting (8.7% each), in the age group 6 to < 12 years:  abdominal pain (5.6%) 
and vomiting (3.3%) and in the age group 12 to < 18 years: abdominal pain and vomiting (3.7% each). 
Further, ‘headache’ within the SOC ‘nervous system disorders’ was frequently reported in the age groups 
6 to <12 years and 12 to <18 years. 
Overall, as expected the AE profile differed slightly between the different age groups regarding PT within 
the most common SOCs (“Infections and infestations” and “Gastrointestinal disorders”). These differences 
reflected more the normal background differences of disease in these age groups. 
In all age groups, frequency of vomiting was higher among subjects treated with post meal faster aspart 
(8.1%, compared to 3.4% in the mealtime faster aspart group and 2.7% in the mealtime NovoRapid 
group). This difference was more pronounced in the two older age groups (9.1% (n=9) of subjects aged 6 
to < 12 years reported AEs of vomiting in the post meal faster aspart group compared to 5% and 3% in 
the faster aspart meal group and NovoRapid group respectively and in 7% (n=10) of the subjects in the 
post meal faster aspart group in the oldest age group [12 - <18 years] compared with 2.1% in both 
faster aspart meal group and NovoRapid group.  This phenomenon has not been noticed in the 
development program for adult and there are no clear explanations for this increased incidence. However, 
vomiting is general considered more frequently occurring in children than adults. Further, none of the 
events was reported as serious, severe or related to study drug and that almost all subjects reporting 
vomiting (n=37/777) reported this only once (total number of events were 40).

Adverse events by relation to trial products  
In total 62 AEs (of 1847) were reported as possibly and/or probably related to randomised trial drug in 49 
subjects (6.3%; 34 subjects reported any event judged as probably and 18 subject any event as possible 
related to randomised trial drug). The distribution between the three treatment groups was 5.0% (n=13 
subjects), 6.6% (n=17 subjects) and 7.4% (n=19 subjects) in the mealtime faster aspart, post-meal 
faster aspart and NovoRapid groups respectively. None of the preferred terms were reported with a

frequency ≥ 2% and no marked differences were seen between the 3 treatment groups with respect to 
frequency or type of possibly or probably related AEs.  
Possibly or probably related AEs reported with a frequency ≥ 1% in any group were ‘injection site 
reaction (n=4), ‘hypoglycaemia’ (n=10), ‘lipohypertrophy’ (n=7) and ‘blood glucose decreased’ (n=4) 
(Table 21) 
In total, 7 of the 62 possibly or probably related AEs were classified as serious (2, 4 and 1 event in the 
mealtime faster aspart, post-meal faster aspart and NovoRapid groups). These events (‘accidental 
overdose’ [n=3], ‘hypoglycaemia’ [n=2] and ‘hypoglycaemia unconsciousness’ [n=2]). 
In the age group 1 to < 6 years, none of the reported AEs was possibly or probably related to randomised 
trial product. In the age groups 6 to < 12 years and 12 to < 18 years, the AEs possibly or probably 
related to randomised trial product were infrequently reported in all 3 treatment groups and no marked 
differences were seen between treatment or age groups with respect to frequency or type of AEs. 
The most frequent PTs reported as possible or probably related to faster aspart are adequately reflected 
in the SmPC.

Adverse event by severity 
The majority of AEs in all 3 treatment groups were of mild (85% [1573/1847] of all AEs) or moderate 
severity (14% [257/1847] of all AEs]). Only four of the 17 severe AEs were considered possible or 
probably related. A summary of AEs in relation to severity and relation to trial products is shown in Table

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Death 
No deaths were reported in the FIASP group, while one non-treatment emergent death  was reported in 
the NovoRapid group. A subject in the group 6 to < 12 years died in an accident 11 days after the last 
dose of randomised treatment. The relation to trial products was considered unlikely by both the 
investigator and MAH. 
Serious adverse events 
All subject: In study 4101, a total of 35 SAEs were reported by 27 (3.5%) subjects; 7 SAEs were 
reported by 5 (1.9%) subjects in the mealtime faster aspart group, 15 SAEs were reported by 13 (5.0%) 
subjects in the post-meal faster aspart group and 13 SAEs were reported by 9 (3.5%) in the NovoRapid 
group (Table 23). 
The majority of SAEs were reported in the SOCs ‘infections and infestations’ and ‘metabolism and 
nutrition disorders’. Overall, none of the SAEs were reported by ≥ 1% of subjects, except ‘gastroenteritis’ 
that was reported by 3 (1.2%) subjects in the NovoRapid group 
In total, 7 SAEs were considered probably related to randomised trial product (2 events in the mealtime 
faster aspart group, 4 events in the post-meal faster aspart group and one event in the NovoRapid 
group), these events were all related to events in association to hypoglycaemia. 
None of the SAEs was reported as possible related to study drug. 
Overall the frequency of SAEs was reported in slightly higher frequency in subjects treated with meal 
faster aspart (1.9%) meal compared to treatment with post meal faster aspart (5%). This difference was 
driven by more reported diabetes related PTs such as DKA and hypoglycaemia.  However, the number of 
subjects in each group was few and conclusions should carefully be drawn. 
Age groups: In the age group 1 to < 6 years, 1 SAE was reported in the post-meal faster aspart group 
(‘influenza’). In all, 18 SAEs were reported in the age group 6 to < 12 years and 16 SAEs were reported 
in the age group 12 to < 18 years. In both age groups no SAEs were reported by more than 1 subject, 
except ‘accidental overdose’ and ‘hypoglycaemic unconsciousness’ (reported by 2 subjects with post-meal 
faster aspart in the age group 6 to < 12 years) and ‘gastroenteritis’ (reported by 2 subjects with 
NovoRapid in the age group 12 to < 18 years).

Adverse event of special interest 
•  Medication errors 
Very few probably related medication errors were reported (3, 2 and 1 event in the mealtime Fiasp, post 
meal Fiasp and NovoRapid groups). Table 24. The available data did not suggest an increased risk of 
medications errors for Fiasp compared to NovoRapid. 
None of the medication errors led to withdrawal or premature discontinuation of trial product. 
Table 24 Medication errors 
• 
Injection site reactions 
Injections site reaction is a known risk for both faster aspart and NovoRapid and labelled in the SmPC for 
FIASP. 
In total, 59 injection site reactions were reported by 33 (4.2%) subjects; 11 events were reported by 8 
(3.1%) subjects in the mealtime faster aspart group, 31 events were reported by 14 (5.4%) subjects in 
the post-meal faster aspart group and 17 events were reported by 11 (4.3%) subjects in the NovoRapid 
group. All AEs related to injection site reactions were non-serious and of mild severity. The majority of 
AEs related to injection site reactions were unlikely related to randomised trial product (Table 25). 
Additionally, 15 AEs (5 in the mealtime faster aspart group, 4 in the post-meal faster aspart group and 6 
in the NovoRapid) were reported by the investigator as injection site reactions, but were not caught in the 
NNMQ search. 
Thus, overall there was no difference in frequency of ISR between the three treatment groups.

As seen in  
Table 26, the events of injection site reaction were evenly distributed between the two oldest age groups 
(6 to <12 years and 12 to <18 years). No events occurred in the youngest age group (1 to < 6 years). 
Three subjects randomised to the postmeal faster aspart group reported 19 ‘injection site haemorrhage’ 
events. 
None of the ‘injection site haemorrhage’ events were considered possibly or probably related to 
randomised trial product.

•  Lipodystrophy 
Lipodystrophy is a known risk for both faster aspart and NovoRapid and labelled in SmPC for FIASP.  
In total, 17 events of lipodystrophy were reported by 15 (1.9%) subjects; 8 events reported by 7 (2.7%) 
subjects in the mealtime faster aspart group, 5 events reported by 4 (1.6%) subjects in the post-meal 
faster aspart and 4 events reported by 4 (1.6%) subjects in the NovoRapid group (Table 27). The 
majority (15 of 17) of the lipodystrophy events were reported as ‘lipohypertrophy’, while the remaining 2 
events were reported as ‘lipodystrophy acquired’; both with post-meal faster aspart 
Overall, there was no difference in frequency of lipodystrophy between the three treatment groups.  
As seen in Table 28, the events of lipodystrophy were evenly distributed between the two oldest age 
groups (6 to <12 years and 12 to <18 years). No events occurred in the youngest age group (1 to < 6 
years).

•  Allergic reactions 
Hypersensitivity and allergic skin manifestations is labelled in the SmPC for FIASP. 
In total, 38 allergic reactions were reported by 30 (3.9%) subjects. There were no differences across 
treatment groups with respect to the type of allergic reactions or the proportion of subjects experiencing 
the reactions Table 29. The most frequently reported allergic reactions (≥ 1% of subjects in any 
treatment group) were ‘rash’ (in all n=7) and ‘rhinitis allergic’ (n=6). Table 29 
None of the allergic reactions were serious. One reaction was considered possibly or probably related to 
randomised trial product (‘urticaria’ in the NovoRapid group). 
Overall, there was no difference in frequency of allergic reactions between the three treatment groups.

•  Hypoglycaemia 
Novo Nordisk classified all hypoglycaemic episodes into the following categories: ‘severe hypoglycaemia’ 
(according to ISPAD classification) ‘BG confirmed hypoglycaemia’, ‘severe or BG confirmed symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia’ and ‘severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemia’ (Figure 16). All hypoglycaemic episodes 
were also classified according to ADA classification (Figure 17).

Overall hypoglycaemic episodes 
The proportion of subjects with hypoglycaemic episodes was similar for mealtime faster aspart, post-meal 
faster aspart and NovoRapid (96.2%, 96.9% and 96.5% of subjects). The observed rate was slightly 
lower for NovoRapid (6973 episodes per 100 PYE) compared to mealtime faster aspart and post-meal 
faster aspart (7556 and 7481 episodes per 100 PYE) (Table 31).

meal faster aspart and NovoRapid groups respectively (Table 31). 
The majority of severe hypoglycaemic episodes (11 of 15 [73%]) were reported during daytime. Three of 
the four nocturnal severe hypoglycaemic episodes were reported in the post-meal faster aspart treatment 
group.

Age groups: None of the severe hypoglycaemic episodes were reported in the age group 1 to < 6 years, 9 
episodes were reported in the age group 6 to < 12 years (2, 4 and 3 episodes in the mealtime faster 
aspart, post-meal faster aspart and NovoRapid groups) and 6 episodes were reported in the age group 12 
to < 18 years (1, 4 and 1 episodes in the mealtime faster aspart, post-meal faster aspart and NovoRapid 
groups) (Table 21) 
Severe or blood glucose confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes 
All ages: In total, 10453 severe or blood glucose confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes (Figure 16) were 
reported in 672 (86.5%) of the subjects.  The proportion of subjects reported severe or BG confirmed 
hypoglycaemic episodes were similar between the three treatment groups: 87.4% of subjects, in the 
post-meal faster aspart group 88.0% of subjects and in the NovoRapid group 84.1% of the subjects 
(Table 31). The estimated rate ratios for severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were 1.11 
[0.90; 1.37] 95%CI for mealtime faster aspart versus NovoRapid and also 1.11 [0.90; 1.37] 95%CI for 
post-meal faster aspart versus NovoRapid.  
Thus, no statistically significant differences were seen between mealtime faster aspart and NovoRapid or 
between post-meal faster aspart and NovoRapid. 
Severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were evenly distributed throughout the 26-week 
treatment period with no differences between treatment groups Figure 18. The distribution of the number 
of severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were similar across the 3 treatment groups.  
In total, 66% of all “severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes” were symptomatic and 89% 
occurred in the daytime.

cumulative function 
Age groups: The frequency of subjects with severe or blood glucose confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes 
was highest in the youngest age group (91.3%) compared to the 6 - <12 years age group (87.7%) and 
the 12 - <18 years age-group (85.1%). When comparing the treatment groups within the age groups, a 
slightly higher incidence of severe or blood-glucose confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes was noted in the 
faster aspart treatment groups compared to NovoRapid treatment groups in the ages below 12 (Table 
32). The clinical relevance of this finding is considered low.

Daytime episodes 
A similar proportion of subjects reported daytime “severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes” in 
the three treatment groups (86.6%, 86.8% and 84.1% in the mealtime faster aspart, post-meal faster 
aspart and NovoRapid group respectively). Table 33

Nocturnal episodes 
All subjects: A higher proportion of subjects in the post-meal faster aspart group (48.4%) reported 
nocturnal severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes compared with the mealtime faster aspart and 
NovoRapid groups (42.9% and 40.3%) (Table 33). The estimated rate ratio for mealtime faster aspart 
versus NovoRapid was 1.29 [0.93; 1.79] 95%CI and 1.50 [1.09; 2.08] 95%CI for postmeal faster aspart 
versus NovoRapid; the latter being statistically significant.

An explanation by the Applicant that may explain the higher rate of nocturnal severe or BG confirmed 
hypoglycaemic episodes in the postmeal faster aspart group (204 per 100 PY) compared to NovoRapid 
(125 100 PY) is that one subject (12 ≤ age < 18 years) in the postmeal faster aspart group contributed 
with a high number of nocturnal severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes (the subject had 45 
episodes during the treatment period and also had a high number of episodes during run-in period).  
The higher number of nocturnal severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes in the post-meal faster 
aspart group were mainly seen in the evening from 22:00 to 01:00 and in the morning from 6:00 to 
7:00. To note is that in trial 4101 with children and adolescents, a hypoglycaemic episode was defined as 
nocturnal if it occurred from 23:00–07:00 (inclusive). 
The cumulative number of nocturnal severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes per subject is 
shown in Figure 19. 
Figure 19 Nocturnal severe or blood glucose confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes – mean 
cumulative function 
Age groups: Nocturnal severe or blood glucose confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes by age groups are 
presented in Table 34.  
In the age group 1 to <6 years, both the proportion of subjects with nocturnal severe or BG confirmed 
hypoglycaemic episodes and rate of episodes per 100 PY were numerically higher in the both groups with 
FIASP (62.5% and 412 in mealtime FIASP group respectively 56.3% and 363 in postmeal FIASP group) 
compared to the NovoRapid group (21.4% and 114 events per 100 PY). See Table 34. According to the 
Applicant, the higher number of episodes in the mealtime faster aspart group compared to the NovoRapid 
group can to some extent be explained by one subject in the mealtime faster aspart group who had 15 
episodes during the treatment period; that subject also had a high number of episodes during the during 
run-in period. 
In the age group 6 to <12 years both the proportion of subjects and the rate were higher in the postmeal 
FIASP group (50.5% and 326 events per 100 PY) than in the NovoRapid group and the mealtime FISAP 
group (37.6% in both and 224 respectively 306 events per 100 PY in the NovoRapid and mealtime FIASP 
group).  
For the age group 12 to <18 years treated with postmeal faster aspart group, the proportion of subjects 
with these episodes was similar to NovoRapid but the rate was numerically higher with postmeal faster 
aspart than with NovoRapid (Table 34). The higher rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes in the post-
meal faster aspart treatment group ages 12 to < 18 years could possibly be explained by one subject in 
the age group reporting 45 nocturnal severe or blood glucose confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/400065/2019

Thus, overall it could not be excluded that subjects using a postmeal faster aspart regime might have a 
greater risk to more often develop nocturnal hypoglycaemia compared to subjects using meal-time 
NovoRapid. However, considering that, in clinical practice, postmeal dosing will only be an administration 
option and not a regime to use on a regular basis together with the inserted warning in SmPC section 4.4 
the risk for nocturnal hypoglycaemia is considered manageable. 
Table 34 Nocturnal severe or blood glucose confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes – age groups 
Mealtime episodes 
Within the first hour after the start of the meal, the rate of severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic 
episodes was low in all 3 treatment groups; however, lower in the post-meal faster aspart group (52 
episodes per 100 PYE) compared with the mealtime faster aspart and NovoRapid groups (93 and 82 
episodes per 100 PYE) (Table 35). 
For each of the time intervals 1–2 hours and 2−3 hours after the start of a meal, the rate was higher 
than the preceding time interval in all 3 treatment groups. For the 3−4 hour time interval, however, the 
rate of hypoglycaemia declined and was lower than for the 2−3 hour interval in all treatment groups 
(Table 35 and Figure 20). 
No statistically significant difference was seen between mealtime faster aspart and NovoRapid in the rate 
of severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemia within 1, 2, or 4 hours after start of a meal, or between 1−2, 
2−3, 2−4 or 3−4 hours after the start of a meal.   
However, the rate of severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemia within 1 hour after start of a meal was 
statistically significantly lower for post-meal faster aspart compared to NovoRapid; the estimated rate 
ratio was 0.64 [0.42; 0.96]95% CI) (Figure 21).  
No statistically significant differences were seen between post-meal faster aspart and NovoRapid within 2 
or 4 hours after start of a meal, or between 1−2, 2−3, 2−4 hours or 3−4 hours after the start of a meal. 
Thus, overall there was no difference between the two mealtime treatment groups (faster aspart vs 
NovoRapid) in the aspect of hypoglycaemic episodes 1-4 hours after mealtime.

Severe or blood glucose confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes by time 
All subjects: No pronounced differences were seen between mealtime faster aspart, postmeal faster 
aspart and NovoRapid in rate of or proportion of subjects reporting severe or BG confirmed 
hypoglycaemic episodes. 
Table 36 Severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes by time - treatment emergent - 
summary – trial 4101 - on-treatment - safety analysis set 
Hypoglycaemic episodes reported as serious adverse events 
In all, 6 hypoglycaemic episodes were reported as SAEs (‘hypoglycaemia’ and ‘hypoglycaemic 
unconsciousness’). None of the hypoglycaemic episodes reported as SAEs were reported in the age group 
1 to <6 years, 4 were reported in the age group 6 to <12 years and 2 were reported in the age group 12 
to <18 years. 
•  Hyperglycaemic episodes 
A hyperglycaemic episode was defined as: if a subject looked/felt ill and had either a SMPG > 14.0 
mmol/L (250 mg/dL) and blood ketones > 1.5 mmol/L or SMPG > 14.0 mmol/L (250 mg/dL) and urine 
ketones above moderate. 
In all, 12 hyperglycaemic episodes were reported by 12 (1.5%) subjects (4 in the meal faster aspart 
group, 1 in the post-meal faster aspart group and 7 in the NovoRapid group). One episode was reported 
Assessment report  
EMA/400065/2019 
Page 63/78 
  
  
 
 
in the age group 1 to <6 years, 3 in the age group 6 to <12 years and 8 in the age group 12 to <18 
years. The number of subjects with hyperglycaemic episodes and the number of the episodes were too 
low to see a pattern in relation to treatment. 
In total 5 events of DKA was reported (2 in the postmeal faster aspart group and 3 in the Novorapid 
treatment group). All 5 events of DKA were reported in the age group 12 to <18 years. 
• 
Insulin Antibodies 
Samples for antibodies were collected at baseline (week 0) at week 12 and at the end-of-trial visit (week 
26). The subjects attended these visits without taking any kind of insulin in the morning to minimise 
potential assay interference. 
The presence of antibodies (insulin aspart specific antibodies and antibodies cross-reacting with human 
insulin as well as the total level of antibodies [comprised of the 2 types of antibodies]) is presented as the 
percentage of bound radioactivity (B) out of the total amount of radioactivity (T) (% B/T) on the 3 
sampling days during the span of the on-treatment period. 
Cut-point values for each antibody measurement are listed below: 
•  Anti-insulin aspart specific antibodies: >1.9% B/T 
•  Antibodies cross-reacting between insulin aspart and human insulin: >0.7% B/T 
• 
Total insulin aspart antibodies: >1.9% B/T 
The percentage of subjects categorised as positive for specific antibodies (13.6–20.5%), respectively 
positive for cross-reacting antibodies (93.0–96.2%) was similar between the 3 treatment groups, 
irrespective of the timing of the sample or whether the response was sustained or a single occurrence 
(Table 37). 
Across all 3 treatment groups, only minor changes in mean level of anti-insulin aspart specific antibodies 
were seen from baseline to week 12, hereafter a slight decrease between week 12 and week 26 was seen 
(Figure 22). 
There did not appear to be any correlation between allergic reactions or injection site reactions and an 
increase in antibody levels from baseline to end-of-trial, or with high antibody levels, for any of the 
treatment groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/400065/2019 
Page 64/78 
  
  
The percentage of subjects categorised as positive for specific antibodies was similar between the 3 age 
groups (1-6 years: 6.3 – 14.3%; 6-12 years: 10.1 – 19.8%; 12-18 years: 14.7 – 16.7%), irrespective of 
the timing of the sample or whether the response was sustained or a single occurrence.  
In line with the results for specific antibodies, the percentage of subjects categorised as positive for 
cross-reacting antibodies was similar between the 3 age groups. At baseline, the percentage of subjects 
categorised as positive for cross-reacting antibodies was 85.7–98.0%, and 92.9-100% of the subjects 
were categorised as positive at any time during the treatment period. The percentage of subjects with a 
sustained positive response was slightly lower than the percentage of subjects with positive response at 
any time during the treatment period and comparable to the percentage of subjects categorised as 
positive for cross-reacting antibodies at baseline.

•  Medication errors 
During the on-treatment period, 6 medication errors were reported by 6 subjects; 3 in the mealtime 
faster aspart group, 2 events in the post-meal faster aspart group and 1 in the NovoRapid group. All the 
medication errors were considered probably related to randomised trial product. 
Five of the medication errors were reported as ‘accidental overdose’ (4 were associated with 
hypoglycaemia and three were serious) and 1 event as ‘incorrect dose administered’. 
•  Technical complaints 
In all, 3 technical complaints related to AEs were reported.  The AEs were non-serious and of mild 
severity. Two AEs (‘injection site pain’ and ‘incorrect dose administered’) were reported by 2 subjects in 
the mealtime faster apart group. The AE ‘injection site pain’ was considered unlikely related to 
randomised trial product, while the AE ‘incorrect dose administered’ was considered probably related to 
randomised trial product. One AE (‘injection site pain’) was reported in the NovoRapid group. The AE was 
considered unlikely related to randomised trial product. Following visual and functional investigations of 
the returned devices by Novo Nordisk, it was concluded that the trial product was normal. 
Laboratory findings and vital signs 
Biochemistry and haematology 
Mean values for biochemistry and haematology remained stable during the trial, and there were no 
apparent differences across the treatment groups in mean values or mean change in values during the 
trial 
Lipids 
The treatment ratios in total cholesterol and LDL were statistically significantly lower for mealtime faster 
aspart compared to NovoRapid. Although statistically significant, the small difference is not considered 
clinically relevant (total cholesterol: estimated rate ratio 0.97 [0.95; 0.99]95% CI; LDL: estimated rate 
Assessment report  
EMA/400065/2019 
Page 66/78 
  
  
 
ratio 0.97 [0.94; 1.00]95% CI). No statistically significant difference in treatment ratios in HDL was 
observed between mealtime faster aspart and NovoRapid. 
The treatment ratios in total cholesterol, LDL and HDL showed no statistically significant differences 
between postmeal faster aspart and NovoRapid. 
Vital signs 
Mean blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and pulse remained stable within each treatment group 
during the trial. No noticeable differences were seen across the 3 treatment groups in the parameters at 
baseline and after 26 weeks of treatment. 
Body weight and body mass index (SD-score) 
The estimated changes from baseline in body weight SD-score (and BMI SD-score) 26 weeks after 
randomisation were +0.03 (+0.02) in the mealtime faster aspart group, +0.01 (+0.00) in the post-meal 
faster aspart group and +0.03 (+0.01) in the NovoRapid group.  
No statistically significant differences between either the faster aspart group or NovoRapid were shown. 
Safety in special populations 
Safety in clinical pharmacology study 4371 (see Efficacy section for further description of the trial) did not 
reveal any new safety issues. 
Intrinsic factors 
The only intrinsic factor investigated in trial 4101 was age. Other intrinsic factors were investigated in the 
original application submitted in 2015. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No subjects withdrew from the trial due to an AE and no subjects discontinued trial product prematurely 
due to an AE. 
Adverse events leading to dose reduction 
In total 62 events were leading to dose reduction.  The reporting-rate of these events was slightly lower 
in mealtime Fiasp (9.3 per100 PY) compared to NovoRapid (20.4 per 100 PY) as well as postmeal Fiasp 
(18.8 per 100 PY) (Table 38).The most frequent (≥ 1%) preferred terms leading to dose reduction were 
‘gastroenteritis, ‘vomiting’, ‘hypoglycaemia’ and ‘blood glucose decreased’; however, these were 
infrequently reported in all 3 treatment groups (Table 38).

Post marketing experience 
Novo Nordisk received the marketing authorisation of faster aspart with the trade name Fiasp during 
2017 in Canada (on 06 January), in the EU (on 09 January) 2017 and in the US (on 29 September) 2017. 
Fiasp was approved for treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults. According to the approved label, use of 
Fiasp in paediatric population is considered as off-label use and as such is addressed in other safety 
documentation including the periodic safety update reports (PSURs). 
As with all post-marketing reports, it is voluntary to report off-label use to the marketing authorisation 
holder. 
As of 30 September 2018, the MAH has received 94 spontaneous case reports of paediatric use with 
Fiasp. The majority of cases were reported from EU and 6 cases originated from US. In all, 50 of the 
spontaneous case reports included an AE and in 4 of the cases, the patients experienced SAEs: 2 serious 
cases of ketoacidosis, 1 serious case of lipoatrophy, and 1 serious case with events pertaining to 
aggression and other behaviour disturbances. 
Based on above data, no safety concerns have been raised in the paediatric population when treated with 
Fiasp. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
To support safety in the paediatric population results from trial 4101 was submitted.  
Exposure 
The trial population included the intended paediatric T1DM population with 46 subjects in the age group 1 
to <6 years, 301 subjects in the age group 6 to <12 years and 430 subjects in the age group 12 to <18 
years. Within the age groups the subjects were assigned to the 3 treatment groups, mealtime faster 
aspart, postmeal faster aspart and mealtime NovoRapid, in a 1:1:1 ratio.  
Assessment report  
EMA/400065/2019 
Page 68/78 
  
  
 
Overall, the extent of exposure of faster aspart in the paediatric population is considered acceptable. 
However, the total exposure (number of subjects and subject years), of the respective treatment was 
notable lower in the 1- to < 6 years group (n=32; 8 PYE), compared to the 6 to < 12 years (n=200; 
approx. 50 PYE) and 12 to < 18 years age groups (n=287; approx. 70 PYE). According to the data 
presented, there were only four subjects randomised to treatment with faster aspart in the ages below 3 
years and at baseline the lowest age was 2 years. Thus, no safety data is available for subjects between 1 
and 2 years and very limited safety data in the ages between 2 and 3 years. Further discussion regarding 
this issue is reflected below. 
Adverse events 
Common adverse events: Overall the safety profile was in accordance with the SmPC for Fiasp (and 
NovoRapid). Across all treatment groups the most frequently reported preferred term was ‘viral upper 
respiratory tract infection’ (20.7%). Other frequently reported PTs were upper respiratory tract infection’ 
(10.3%) and ‘headache’ (8.2%). To note in this context is that “Hypoglycaemic episodes” were only to be 
reported as AEs if they met the definitions of SAE. The overall risk for hypoglycaemia is discussed below. 
As expected the AE profile differed slightly between the different age groups regarding PT within the most 
common SOCs and PTs. These differences reflected more the normal background differences of disease 
repertoires in these age groups. 
In all age groups, frequency of vomiting was higher among subjects treated with post meal faster aspart 
(8.1%) compared to the mealtime faster aspart group (3.4%) and the mealtime NovoRapid group (2.7% 
in). The difference was higher in the two older age groups (children and adolescents above 12 years). 
This phenomenon has not been noticed in the development program for adult and there are no clear 
explanations for this increased incidence. However, vomiting is general considered more frequently 
occurring in children than adults. Further, none of the events was reported as serious, severe or related 
to study drug and that almost all subjects reporting vomiting (n=37/777) reported this only once (total 
number of events were 40). Thus, this finding does not warrant any further action.  
Related adverse events: In total 62 AEs (of 1847) were reported as possible and/or probably related to 
randomised trial drug in 49 subjects. The distribution between the three treatment groups was similar 
5.0%, 6.6% and 7.4% in the mealtime faster aspart, post-meal faster aspart and NovoRapid groups 
respectively. No marked differences were seen between the 3 treatment groups with respect to frequency 
or type of possibly or probably related AEs. Possibly or probably related AEs reported with a frequency ≥ 
1% in any group were ‘injection site reaction (n=4), ‘hypoglycaemia’ (n=10), ‘lipohypertrophy’ (n=8) and 
‘blood glucose decreased’ (n=4). No AE was reported in a frequency > 2%. 
SAEs, Death 
The frequency of SAEs was reported in slightly lower frequency in subjects treated with meal faster aspart 
(1.9%) compared to treatment with post meal faster aspart (5%). This difference was driven by more 
reported diabetes related PTs such as DKA and hypoglycaemia.  However, the number of subjects in each 
group was few and conclusions should be drawn with caution. Overall, none of the SAEs were reported by 
≥ 1% of subjects, except ‘gastroenteritis’ that was reported by 3 (1.2%) subjects in the NovoRapid 
group. 
One non-treatment emergent death (drowning) was reported in the trial 11 days after last dose of 
NovoRapid. No death occurred in any of the two groups with faster aspart.   
Hypoglycaemia 
 “Severe or blood-glucose hypoglycaemic episodes” were reported in 86.5% of the subjects with a similar 
distribution between the three treatment groups. However, these events were reported in a higher 
proportion in the youngest age group (91.3%) compared to the 6 - <12 years age group (87.7%) and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/400065/2019 
Page 69/78 
  
  
12 - <18 years age-group (85.1%). When comparing the treatment groups within the age groups, a 
slightly higher rate of severe or blood-glucose confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes was noted in the two 
faster aspart treatment groups compared to NovoRapid treatment groups in the ages below 12. The 
clinical relevance of this finding is considered low.  
As expected, the rate of severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were lower in the post-meal 
faster aspart group compared with the mealtime faster aspart and NovoRapid groups one and 1-2 hours 
after meal. However, after 2-3 and 3-4 hours after meal the rate was higher in the postmeal faster aspart 
group.  
Overall, the rate of severe or BG confirmed nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes was slightly higher in the 
postmeal faster aspart group (374 per 100 PY [48.4%]) compared to the mealtime treatment groups 
(308 per PYE in the mealtime faster aspart group [42.9%] and 245 per PYE with NovoRapid [40.3%]). 
According to the Applicant the higher rate in the post-meal faster aspart group could to some extent be 
explained by one subject (belonging to the 12 to <18 years age group) that reported with a high number 
(n=45) of nocturnal severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes in this group.  
The higher incidences of nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes in the postmeal treatment groups in the late 
evening might reflect the administration of dosing after the evening meal. This is considered to be of 
clinical relevance and something to be cautioned about when administering faster aspart post-meal to 
children close to bed-time. However, the incidence of severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia was low and this 
risk is overall considered manageable but post-meal treatment with FIASP in the evenings should be 
handled special awareness due to the risk for nocturnal hypoglycaemia especially in the younger children. 
In addition, in clinical practice, postmeal dosing will only be an administration option and not a regime to 
use on a regular basis. The risk for nocturnal hypoglycaemia should be is reflected in the SmPC section 
4.4. 
Allergic reactions, Injection site reactions and Lipodystrophy 
Overall, there was no difference in frequency of allergic reactions (in total 4%), Injection site reactions (in 
total 4%) and lipodystrophy (in total 2%) between the three treatment groups. These events have not 
been analysed across age groups. The AEs related to lipodystrophy, injections site reactions and allergic 
reactions were evenly distributed between the two oldest age groups (6-< 12 years and 12 to < 18 
years). No or few events were reported in the youngest age group. 
Antibodies 
Across all 3 treatment groups, only minor changes in mean level of anti-insulin aspart specific antibodies 
were seen from baseline to week 12, hereafter a slight decrease between week 12 and week 26 was 
seen. The antibody development by age group were aligned with the results seen in the total population.  
Children below 1 and 3 years 
There are limited safety data of faster aspart in the ages between 2 and 3 years. However, when 
comparing the using of faster aspart in the youngest age group with the older ones, no new pronounced 
differences were noted besides a higher proportion and rate of hypoglycaemic episode in the youngest 
age group. Thus, albeit limited, these data indicate that the treatment with faster insulin aspart in 
children aged 2-3 years old also is tolerated to the same extent as the older children and adolescents. 
No children in the ages 1 to < 2 years was included in the study. However, NovoRapid has the same 
active component as Fiasp (insulin aspart) and is since 2016 authorised, in the EU, in children above 1 
year. Limited safety data is also available for NovoRapid (insulin aspart) in children aged 1-2 years, which 
does not indicate any differences in the safety profile in this subgroup. These data supported the 
extension of the indication for NovoRapid to include children from 1 year of age 
(EMEA/H/C/000258/II/0112). Evaluation of the present data did not identify any differences in the safety 
Assessment report  
EMA/400065/2019 
Page 70/78 
  
  
profile of clinical significance between faster aspart and NovoRapid.  Thus, there are no suspicions that 
safety should differ in subjects between 1 to 2 years using faster aspart compared to use of NovoRapid in 
this age group. However, as for all subjects and especially the youngest children, care should be taken 
when faster aspart is administered postmeal in evenings due to the risk for nocturnal hypoglycaemic 
episodes. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of faster aspart in the paediatric population was in accordance with the know safety 
profile of Fiasp in adults and NovoRapid in adults and children above 1 year. As expected, the major risk 
with both treatments across all age groups was hypoglycaemia. With post-meal faster aspart treatment 
the risk for nocturnal hypoglycaemia tended to be higher. This is reflected in the SmPC. In addition, in 
clinical practice, postmeal dosing will only be an administration option and not a regime to use on a 
regular basis. Albeit, limited data in subjects between 2 and 3 years, the data presented indicate that the 
treatment with faster insulin aspart in these ages was tolerated to the same extent as the older children 
and adolescents. No subjects between 1 to > 2 year were included in the study. However, since no 
difference of clinical significance in the overall safety profile was noted between faster aspart and 
NovoRapid, there are no suspicions that safety should differ in subjects between 1 to 2 years using faster 
aspart compared to use of NovoRapid in these ages. However, as for all subjects and especially the 
youngest children, care should be taken if faster aspart is administered postmeal in evenings due to the 
possible increased risk for nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes.

Product differentiation strategy: Coloured cartons, labels and plastic components 
of primary packaging to prevent wrong drug administration due to mix-up of 
different insulin products  
Text in SmPC, PL and IFU 
1 SmPC Section 4.2 where information is given on posology and method of 
administration.  
2 SmPC Section 4.2 where passive discouragement for withdrawing insulin with 
a syringe from cartridges and prefilled pens is included. It is further specified 
that if administration by a syringe, intravenous injection or infusion pump is 
necessary, a vial should be used.  
3 Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use where information on 
avoidance of accidental mix-ups is given. Additionally, advice on practical 
actions to minimise the risk is given, for example for patients to check the 
insulin label before each injection and that a syringe should never be used to 
draw the medicinal product from the cartridge of a pre-filled pen. 
4 SmPC Section 6.6 where special precautions are given for disposal and other 
handling. Text/wording allowing the possibility to withdraw insulin from 
cartridges and prefilled pens with a syringe in case of emergency has been 
deleted from this section. 
5 PL Section 2 with information on when the medicine should not be used, and 
also to check the label before use to ensure the right type of medicine is 
used. 
6 PL Section 3 with information on how to use the product correctly. In addition, 
text on correct usage of Fiasp® patients with poor eyesight is also included. 
7 IFU where information is given on how to handle the product including 
instruction to check the label to ensure the right type of insulin is used and 
instruction on how to avoid injection of air to ensure proper dosing and to 
carry a spare prefilled pen in case it is lost or damaged 
Additional risk minimisation measures: 
To increase awareness of differences between Fiasp® and Tresiba® products, a 
communication plan regarding the risk of mix-up between Fiasp® and Tresiba® has 
been prepared. The communication plan includes a direct healthcare professional 
communication (DHPC) addressing pharmacies and dispensing clinics. 
This risk minimisation is intended to be used until there are no longer any Fiasp® 
products on the market with only yellow colour plastic components 
2.7.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated to include 
information on the use of Fiasp in children. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
In addition, minor editorial changes are made to the PI. 
Assessment report

2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Fiasp (insulin aspart) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it is a biological product authorised after 1 January 2011.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is among the most common chronic diseases in children and 
adolescents. T1DM accounts for over 90% of all childhood and adolescent diabetes. Subjects with T1DM 
require lifelong treatment with insulin. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is becoming increasingly common 
in adolescents, particularly in the peripubertal period although the disease remains relatively rare apart 
from in minority populations. Available data suggest that preadolescent children are unlikely to have 
T2DM even if obese. Both T1DM and T2DM are associated with acute and chronic complications. 
With this application the MAH seek to extend the indication for Fiasp to include children and adolescents 
from the age of 1 year. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
A basal-bolus insulin regimen is generally recommended for paediatric T1DM subjects aiming at 
resembling physiological insulin secretion. The challenge to obtain good glycaemic control in the absence 
of hypoglycaemia is greater in a paediatric population compared to an adult population due to growth, 
more variable lifestyle, need of assistance with insulin injection and hormonal changes.   
Preferable, rapid-acting insulin analogues like faster aspart should be given immediately before meals. 
However, a significant proportion of people with diabetes regularly need to take (or be given) their dose 
of bolus insulin either during or after a meal, e.g. toddlers and infants where the size and composition of 
a meal cannot be accurately predicted in advance. This despite glycaemic control having a positive 
association with administration before the meal. There is a need for better documentation on the efficacy 
and safety when a bolus insulin is given post-meal.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study 4101 data is a 26-week, randomised, partly double-blind, multicentre, multinational, active 
controlled, treat-to-target, 3-armed parallel-group trial with a 12-week run-in period. The trial compared 
effect and safety of mealtime faster aspart versus mealtime NovoRapid, both in combination with insulin 
degludec once daily in a basal-bolus regimen, in subjects with T1DM aged 1 year to less than 18 years of 
age. The trial also included a 26-week open-label post-meal faster aspart dosing group in combination 
Assessment report  
EMA/400065/2019 
Page 73/78 
  
  
with insulin degludec. Furthermore, a subgroup of children aged > 8 years took part in a CGM substudy 
investigating the effects of Fiasp and NovoRapid in relation to a standardised meal test.  
Data is presented for the overall population (777 subjects) and for the three age groups: 1-6 years (46 
subjects), 6-12 years (301 subjects) and 12-18 years (430 subjects). No children below the age of 2 
years were actually included in the study. Four children aged 2-3 years were included, all in the two 
faster aspart groups (2 in each groups). The demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced 
between groups. A high proportion of subjects completed the trial (98%). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The study met its primary objective as both mealtime and post-meal Fiasp was found to be non-inferior 
to NovoRapid (ETD -0.17 [-0.30; -0.03]95%CI and 0.13 [-0.01; 0.26]95%CI for mealtime and post-meal 
dosing, respectively).  In both analyses the upper limit of the 95%CI was below 0.3% which is considered 
an acceptable non-inferiority margin. Mealtime Fiasp was also shown to be superior to NovoRapid with 
regards to change from baseline in HbA1c 26 weeks after randomisation (estimated treatment 
difference: -0.17 % [-0.30; -0.03]95% CI).   
During the randomised treatment period of the study, HbA1c remained stable in the Fiasp mealtime 
group, whereas HbA1c slightly increased in the post-meal group and in the NovoRapid group.  
The responder rates decreased in all treatment groups over the treatment period, as expected since 
HbA1c increased during the treatment period. No statistically significant differences were observed 
between the treatment groups. 
When presented by age groups, it is observed that HbA1c remained stable in all treatment groups in the 
age group 6 to <12 years. The change in HbA1c observed in the overall population was driven by the 
changes in HbA1c observed in the two other age groups, i.e. children (1 - <6 years) and adolescents (12 
- <18 years) respectively. 
FPG remained rather stable during the study in all treatment groups. No statistically significant 
differences were observed.  
The 8-point SMBG profiles at week 26 differed somewhat between treatment groups. The observed mean 
1-hour PPG and 1-hour PPG increment were lower for mealtime faster aspart compared to NovoRapid at 
all individual meals (breakfast, lunch and evening meal) and for “all meals”, while the post-meal faster 
aspart group showed higher 1-hour PPGs and PPG increments compared to NovoRapid.  
For mealtime faster aspart, a statistically significant difference in favour of mealtime faster aspart over 
NovoRapid was found for change from baseline to week 26 in 1-hour PPG after breakfast, lunch, and “all 
meals” (ETD: -0.70 mmol/L [-1.14; -0.27]95% CI), but not for the main evening meal. The change from 
baseline to week 26 in 1-hour PPG increment was statistically significantly in favour of mealtime faster 
aspart after breakfast, main evening meal, and “all meals” (ETD: -0.93 mmol/L [-1.35; -0.52]95% CI) 
but no for the lunch meal. 
For post-meal faster aspart, a statistically significant difference in favour of NovoRapid was found for 
change from baseline to week 26 in 1-hour PPG after lunch, main evening meal, and “all meals”, as well 
as for change from baseline to week 26 in 1-hour PPG increment after “all meals”.  
The data from the CGM subgroup largely confirms the data from the 8-point SMBG profiles.  
The data from the meal test show that mealtime faster aspart was comparable to NovoRapid up to 1 hour 
after the meal after which plasma glucose increment was higher with faster aspart. None of the 
differences observed in the meal test were statistically significant. Post-meal faster aspart showed less 
post prandial glucose control at all time points.  
Assessment report  
EMA/400065/2019 
Page 74/78 
  
  
There were no apparent differences in either daily mean bolus, basal or total insulin dose between 
treatment groups at week 26. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No children in the age group 1-2 years were included in the trial and only 4 children aged 2-3 years were 
included, all in the two faster aspart groups (two in each group). Thus, the efficacy data in the youngest 
age group is very limited but as there is no reason to believe that the PD effect is different in the 
youngest children, extrapolation of efficacy data from older children is acceptable.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The total exposure (number of subjects and subject years), of the respective treatment was notable lower 
in the 1- to < 6 years group (n=32; 8 PYE), compared to the 6 to < 12 years (n=200; approx. 50 PYE) 
and 12 to < 18 years age groups (n=287; approx. 70 PYE). According to the data presented, there were 
only four subjects randomised to treatment with faster aspart in the ages below 3 years and at baseline 
the lowest age was 2 years.  
The overall proportion of subjects with an AE during the study period was 76.5% and similar across the 3 
treatment groups (74% -79%). Across all treatment groups the most frequently reported preferred term 
was ‘viral upper respiratory tract infection’ (20.7%), other frequently reported PTs were upper respiratory 
tract infection’ (10.3%) and ‘headache’ (8.2%). “Hypoglycaemic episodes” were only to be reported as 
AEs if they met the definitions of SAE. The majority of AEs in all 3 treatment groups were non-serious 
(98%) and of mild or moderate severity (99%).  As expected the AE profile differed slightly between the 
different age groups regarding PT within the most common SOCs and PTs. These differences reflected 
more the normal background differences of disease repertoires in these age groups. 
The majority of the SAEs (in total n=18 in the two faster aspart groups) reported in the SOCs ‘infections 
and infestations’ and ‘metabolism and nutrition disorders. Overall, none of the SAEs were reported by 
≥ 1% of subjects in any of the two faster aspart groups. 
Overall the AE profile was in accordance with the SmPC for Fiasp (and NovoRapid) without any difference 
of clinical significance between the three treatment groups.  
“Severe or blood-glucose hypoglycaemic episodes” were reported in 86% of the subjects with almost a 
similar distribution between the three treatment groups. However, overall these events were reported in 
a slightly higher proportion in the youngest age group (91%) compared to the two older age groups 
(88% in the 6 - <12 years age group and 85% in the 12 - <18 years age-group). This difference was 
driven by slightly higher frequencies of subjects reporting severe or blood-glucose confirmed 
hypoglycaemic episodes in the two faster aspart treatment groups in the ages below 12 years (94% 
reported these events in subjects treated with faster aspart in the ages 1 to < 6 years and 90% in the 
ages 6 to < 12 years) compared to NovoRapid treatment groups in these age-groups (86% reported 
Severe or blood-glucose hypoglycaemic episodes in the ages 1 to < 6 years and 82% in the ages 6 to < 
12 years).  
In study NN1218-4101, a higher incidence and rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemia defined as severe or 
blood-glucose confirmed hypoglycaemia was reported among subjects treated with post-meal faster 
aspart (48.4%; 374 events per 100 PY) compared with NovoRapid (40.3%; 245 events per 100 PY) and 
mealtime faster aspart (42.9%; 308 events per 100 PY). However, in clinical practice, postmeal dosing 
will only be an administration option and not a regime to use on a regular basis. A recommendation how 
to handle the risk for nocturnal hypoglycaemia with postmeal dosing in the paediatric population has been 
inserted SmPC section 4.4.  
Assessment report  
EMA/400065/2019 
Page 75/78 
  
  
Reassuringly, the incidence of severe nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes was low (in total 4 events in four 
subjects). 
ADRs related to allergic reaction, ISR, lipodystrophies and medication errors were reported in 4%, 4%, 
2% and 0.7% respectively of the subject without any difference of clinical relevance between treatment 
or age groups.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Even though, the inclusion criteria in study NN1218-4101 allowed subjects from one year to participate in 
the study, the minimum age at baseline across all treatment groups was 2 years. Thus, no subjects were 
below two years and only four children between 2 and 3 years was included. Thus, there is a limitation in 
exposure of Fiasp in the age span 1-3 years, which is covered in the proposed indication.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Subjects with T1DM require life-long insulin treatment for survival. In order to allow individualised 
treatment, with the aim of achieving good metabolic control, insulins with different PD profiles are 
needed. T1DM is rare in very young children but insulin treatment is mandatory to prevent death, 
irrespective of age. With the current submission, data to support the use of Fiasp in children and 
adolescents aged 1 year and above have been submitted.  
It is well recognized that insulin treatment in diabetic subjects should, as much as possible, mimic the 
physiological feedback system that regulates insulin secretion by way of circulating levels of glucose. It is 
also known that the insulin response to glucose is normally very swift and that insulin release from the 
pancreas reaches a prime target of insulin action, namely the liver, within minutes by way of the portal 
circulation. It is therefore, theoretically at least, advantageous for patients, including children, to receive 
very fast acting insulin treatment which, albeit given by necessity subcutaneously (thereby bypassing the 
portal circulation), will as much as possible mimic physiological conditions. 
Fiasp, given either before or after the meal was compared with NovoRapid given before meals and was 
shown superior to NovoRapid when given before meals. The clinical relevance of the treatment difference 
of -0.17 observed between mealtime Fiasp and NovoRapid may be debated but, considering that the 
mean HbA1c at baseline was rather low (7.56%), large improvements in HbA1c may be difficult to 
achieve, especially as the bolus insulin will mostly affect the postprandial glucose excursion. The 
comparison between Fiasp given after the meal with NovoRapid given before the meal, showed that post-
meal dosing when used on a regular basis, is suboptimal as reflected by a numerically higher HbA1c. 
These data are of importance since many patients (especially young children) already take their bolus 
dose after the meal out of fear of hypoglycaemia. Post-meal dosing is however not to be used on a 
regular basis but is an option in certain situations and the SmPC has been amended to more clearly 
reflect this.  
The study aimed at including children aged 1 to 18 years, but no children in the age group 1-2 years were 
included in the trial. Thus, the efficacy data in the youngest age group is very limited but as there is no 
reason to believe that the PD effect is different in the youngest children, extrapolation of efficacy data is 
acceptable.  
Although only limited safety data in children aged 2 to 3 years is available, the data indicate that 
treatment with insulin aspart in Fiasp is comparable to that of older children and adolescents. Limited 
safety data is also available for NovoRapid (insulin aspart) in children aged 1-2 years, which does not 
indicate any differences in the safety profile in this subgroup. These data supported the extension of the 
indication for NovoRapid to include children from 1 year of age (EMEA/H/C/000258/II/0112).   
The risk for nocturnal hypoglycaemia is always an issue for subject treated with insulin and special 
attention with regards to carbohydrate intake and insulin dosing in the evenings. The slightly higher risk 
for nocturnal hypoglycaemias with post-meal insulin aspart is considered manageable with the proposed 
warning in the SmPC section 4.4.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The beneficial effects of Fiasp in the paediatric population, aged 1 to 18 years, is considered to outweigh 
the risks, thus the benefit risk balance is positive. The data in the youngest children is limited. Data on 
NovoRapid, which is already approved for use in this population provide further support for the safe use 
also in children from 1 year of age, as the only difference between the two products, i.e. the faster onset 
of action with Fiasp, has been shown to result in better glycaemic control without undue increase in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/400065/2019 
Page 77/78 
  
  
risk of hypoglycaemias. Notably, all 46 children in the age group 1-6 years of age completed the trial on 
study drug, indicating that Fiasp (and NovoRapid) was well tolerated also in the youngest age groups. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The indication proposed by the MAH does not specify the type of diabetes. According to the EMA 
“Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment or prevention of diabetes 
mellitus” (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev. 1), extrapolation of data from adults with T2DM to children with 
T2DM is acceptable if efficacy and safety has been demonstrated in adults with T2DM and in children with 
T1DM.  This issue was discussed in the SA given by CHMP in 2013. The condition of demonstrating 
efficacy and safety in adults with T2DM and in children with T1DM is considered fulfilled and therefore 
extrapolation to the paediatric T2DM population is acceptable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Fiasp in the treatment of children with diabetes mellitus aged 1 year and above is 
positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following

As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC and the corresponding sections of the 
Package Leaflet are updated accordingly.  
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to make other non-related 
minor or editorial changes were implemented throughout the EU PI to increase readability/consistency. 
An updated RMP version 3.1 was agreed during the procedure. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and

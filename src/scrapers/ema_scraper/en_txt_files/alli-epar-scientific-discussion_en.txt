SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
1.  Introduction 
This  application  has  been  submitted  as  an  informed  consent  application  in  accordance  with  Article 
10(c) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended.  
Therefore, consent from the MAH of the XENICAL application, which had been submitted as a full 
application under Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC, has been given allowing access to Module 2 
to Module 5 of the initial dossier of this authorised product and any subsequent post-marketing 
procedures submitted, assessed and approved. 
As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Orlistat GSK medicinal product are identical to 
the up-to-date quality, safety and efficacy profile of XENICAL. Information on the scientific 
discussions can be found in the XENICAL CHMP assessment report and in the European Public 
Assessment Report (EPAR). 
The approved indication is: “Orlistat GSK is indicated in conjunction with a mildly hypocaloric diet 
for the treatment of obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater or equal to 30 kg/m², or 
overweight patients (BMI > 28 kg/m²) with associated risk factors.  
Treatment with orlistat should be discontinued after 12 weeks if patients have been unable to lose at 
least 5% of their body weight as measured at the start of drug therapy”. 
2.  Quality aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the XENICAL application, the quality data in support 
of the Orlistat GSK application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the XENICAL dossier 
which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
3.  Non-clinical aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the XENICAL application, the non-clinical data in 
support of the Orlistat GSK application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the 
XENICAL dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
4.  Clinical aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the XENICAL application, the clinical data in support 
of the Orlistat GSK application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the XENICAL dossier, 
which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
•  User Consultation 
Consultation with target patient groups has not been undertaken for Orlistat GSK. The applicant has 
included justification for this based on the fact that the reference product was first approved in 1998 
and the leaflet has been used by a large number of patients since that time.

6.  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Since this application is an informed consent of the XENICAL application, the CHMP considered that 
the risk-benefit balance of Orlistat GSK was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of 
the marketing authorisation for the following indication: 
Orlistat GSK is indicated in conjunction with a mildly hypocaloric diet for the treatment of obese 
patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater or equal to 30 kg/m², or overweight patients (BMI 
> 28 kg/m²) with associated risk factors.  
Treatment with orlistat should be discontinued after 12 weeks if patients have been unable to lose at 
least 5% of their body weight as measured at the start of drug therapy.

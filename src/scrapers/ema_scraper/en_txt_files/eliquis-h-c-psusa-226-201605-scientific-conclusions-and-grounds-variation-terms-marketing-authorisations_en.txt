Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for apixaban, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
During the reporting period of the periodic safety update report, the marketing authorisation holder 
received some comments through the Medical Information channel regarding clarity of dosing 
recommendation in patients with renal impairment. Considering the importance of dosing in this 
vulnerable subpopulation and in order to prevent any dose error, the PRAC considers that the dosing 
recommendation in patients with renal impairment in section 4.2 of the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC) should be clarified. In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment, it is 
clarified that for the prevention of venous thromboembolic events in elective hip or knee replacement 
surgery, for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE) 
and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE, no dose adjustment is necessary; for the prevention of 
stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and serum 
creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL (133 micromole/L) associated with age ≥ 80 years or body weight ≤ 60 kg, a 
dose reduction is necessary and described in the product information. In the absence of other criteria 
for dose reduction (age, body weight), no dose adjustment is necessary. In patients with severe 
renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min), it is clarified that for the prevention of stroke 
and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF, patients should receive the lower dose of apixaban 
2.5 mg twice daily; and no change are made to the recommendation for the other indications where 
apixaban is to be used with caution.  
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information of medicinal products containing apixaban were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for apixaban the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product containing apixaban is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.

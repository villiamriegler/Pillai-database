2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
The present application pertains to the informed consent procedure according to Article 82(1) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 aiming to duplicate the existing marketing authorisation for the H5N1 
zoonotic vaccine Aflunov (MAH: Seqirus S.r.l.), into a new vaccine named “Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine 
Seqirus” (Applicant: Seqirus S.r.l.).  
The reason behind the present informed consent application procedure is that Seqirus intends to 
continue the marketing of the currently authorised Aflunov H5N1 vaccine and, in parallel, to introduce 
a new H5N8 vaccine targeting a new clade (2.3.4.4b) which has become dominant in various world 
regions. The risk for occupationally or otherwise exposed groups to avian influenza-infected birds or 
mammals is assessed as low to moderate. The candidate virus subtype which has the greatest 
coverage against the avian viruses of concern which are currently of clade 2.3.4.4b is 
A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 (H5N8) clade 2.3.4.4b.  
Therefore, following duplicate license granting, Seqirus intends to introduce a strain modification for 
the Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus in order to target the new clade, while maintaining the same 
strain for the current Aflunov license.  
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
H5 subtype influenza virus is the most widely detected avian influenza virus. Since 1996, when the 
virus was first identified, it has caused numerous disease outbreaks in domestic poultry and wild birds 
around the world. The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of type A subtype H5N1 (HPAI) A(H5N1), 
that causes high mortality in infected chicken, is the causative agent of H5N1 flu, commonly known as 
avian influenza ("bird flu"). 
H5N1 is highly contagious among birds and has a near 100% case fatality rate. It is spread through 
birds’ droppings, saliva, or through contaminated food and water. Recently, there have been a rising 
number of cases of bird flu detected among mammals. Although human infection is rare (sporadic 
infection), there is some evidence of limited human-to-human transmission of the virus. Individuals 
with close contact to birds, including poultry farm workers, are at increased risk of acquiring the 
infection. Around 60% of humans known to have been infected with the HPAI A(H5N1) have died from 
it. Further, due to long-term circulation and increasingly large host reservoir, H5N1 may mutate or 
reassort into a strain capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. According to the WHO, H5N1 
pathogenicity is gradually continuing to rise in endemic areas, and due to its high lethality and 
virulence, and its significant ongoing mutations, the H5N1 virus is regarded to be the largest threat for 
a potential influenza pandemic. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
In 1996, HPAI A(H5N1) virus is first identified in domestic waterfowl in Southern China. The virus is 
named A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996. Detections of HPAIV were initially reported in the Far East, and 
later, in parts of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the United States. 
In 1997, Hong Kong identified the first human infections. In 2003, the first confirmed human cases 
were notified by WHO, and since then more human cases and fatalities have been reported by WHO. 
According to WHO Globally, from January 2003 to 31 May 2023, 876 cases of human infection with 
avian influenza A(H5N1) virus were reported from 23 countries. Of these 876 cases, 458 were fatal 
(Case Fatality Rate of 52%). In December 2021, a mild A(H5N1) infection in a person above 75 years 
of age that had close exposure to infected ducks was reported from the United Kingdom 
(https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/zoonotic-influenza/facts/factsheet-h5n1). 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
In general, humans who catch a humanized influenza A virus (a human flu virus of type A) usually 
have symptoms that include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, conjunctivitis, and, in severe 
cases, breathing problems and viral pneumonia that may be fatal. Influenza A virus H5N1 can trigger a 
'cytokine storm' by inducing higher levels of cytokines than the more common flu virus types. While it 
is expected that immunocompromised individuals may develop more severe disease, clinical picture of 
infection with a humanized H5N1 flu is not yet known. 
The reported mortality rate of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in a human is high and 
according to WHO reaches 60% of cases. However, there is some uncertainty as people with milder 
symptoms may not seek treatment. 
2.1.4.  Management 
Currently, Aflunov is the only H5N1 zoonotic vaccine approved in EU.  
WHO has published guidance on the clinical management of human infection with A(H5N1) as well as 
rapid advice guidelines on pharmacological management of humans infected with avian influenza A 
(H5N1) virus. 
Four licensed influenza antiviral agents are available in the EU/EEA: amantadine, rimantadine, 
zanamivir and oseltamivir. However, current circulating seasonal influenza A viruses are resistant 
(>99%) to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine). Isolates of influenza A(H5) strains are 
also widely resistant to the adamantanes. Zanamivir and oseltamivir are included in a class of 
medicinal products known as influenza neuraminidase inhibitors and are active against both influenza A 
and B viruses. Baloxavir marboxyl has been authorised in 2021 in the EU/EEA. 
HPAI A(H5N1) viruses have so far been reported to be sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors, even 
though a few viruses of the Egyptian clade showed resistance. 
Controlling the virus’ spread is the best defence to prevent spilling from birds over into humans. 
Current seasonal flu vaccines are not effective against bird flu.  
There are several H5N1 pandemic vaccines approved in EU, but the continual mutation of H5N1 
renders them of limited use to date: while vaccines can sometimes provide cross-protection against 
related flu strains, the best protection would be from a vaccine specifically produced for any future 
pandemic flu virus strain. 
2.2.  About the product 
Like the currently authorised Aflunov vaccine, the duplicate “Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus” is a 
monovalent influenza avian vaccine (surface antigen, inactivated, MF59C.1 adjuvanted). The vaccine 
contains purified HA and NA surface antigens from the influenza avian virus A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 
(H5N1) like strain (NIBRG-23) clade 2.2.1. 
Aflunov was developed to protect against a (closely matched) potential zoonotic influenza viral strain 
via early vaccination at the start of a pandemic or during pre-pandemic stages (e.g. to reduce 
mortality against a zoonotic pandemic strain in those countries where infections are occurring). It may 
also help reducing the chance of the emergence of a reassortant pandemic strain by vaccinating those 
(e.g., veterinarians, poultry workers, operators involved in the manufacturing of vaccines with 
pandemic-like strains, laboratory workers) at high risk of infection from both avian and human viruses. 
In the event of a zoonotic influenza, the “Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus” active substance can be 
updated accordingly with the circulating zoonotic strain according to WHO indication. 
The MF59C.1 adjuvant is an oil-in-water emulsion, composed mainly of squalene that is an 
intermediate metabolite in the synthesis of cholesterol.  
The influenza virus strain is propagated in embryonated chicken eggs. 
The vaccine is presented as a suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe containing 7.5 micrograms 
(expressed in micrograms haemagglutinin)/0.5 ml. Packs of 1 or 10 pre-filled syringes are proposed. 
2.3.  Quality aspects 
The  “Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus” is submitted as an informed consent application of Aflunov, 
under Article 10(c) of Directive 2001/83/EC.  
Therefore, the present application fully cross-refers to the up-to-date quality data of the original dossier 
of the zoonotic vaccine Aflunov, as further modified through all the post-approval Aflunov quality changes 
which have been assessed and authorised to date.  
It is noted that, with the exception of antigen composition and dose, Aflunov has a manufacturing process 
highly comparable (i.e. same technology platform/equipment, same adjuvant) to the Seqirus seasonal 
vaccines  such  as  the  EU  authorised  quadrivalent  vaccine  “Fluad  Tetra”  (aQIV)  and  the  nationally 
authorised  trivalent  vaccine  “Fluad”,  licensed  in  several  EU  countries  through  a  Mutual  Recognition 
Procedure  (MRP).  Due  to  the  similarity  of  the  manufacturing  process  adopted  for  other  Seqirus  egg-
based, MF59C.1 adjuvanted vaccines, most of the Aflunov variation procedures authorised to date have 
been  supported  with  quality  data  relative  to  highly  similar  platform  products,  such  as  the  seasonal 
vaccine Fluad Tetra.  
Being  an  informed  consent  application  procedure,  only  Module  1  has  been  submitted  to  support  the 
present duplicate license for the “Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus”. 
In  particular,  within  Module  1  the  applicant  has  submitted  a  declaration  stating  that  the  “Zoonotic 
Influenza  Vaccine  Seqirus”  has  the  same  qualitative  and  quantitative  composition  in  terms  of  active 
substance  (Influenza  virus  surface  antigens  of  strain  a/turkey/Turkey/1/2005,  H5N1)  and  the  same 
pharmaceutical form as the currently authorised zoonotic vaccine Aflunov.  
Moreover,  suitable  proof  of  GMP  compliance  for  all  the  involved  DS/DP  manufacturing  sites has  been 
provided. 
The  applicant  has  also  provided  confirmation  that  no  new  or  additional  sites  than  those  currently 
approved for the reference medicinal product Aflunov have been included and committed to ensure the 
same  consistency  with  the  manufacturing  sites  that  will  be  listed in  Module 3 (sections  3.2.P.3.1  and 
3.2.S.2.1) once the lifecycle of this part of the dossier will start. 
 
 
 
To  support  the  present  informed  consent  application,  the  applicant  has  also  provided  additional 
documentation  requested  during  validation:  QP  declaration,  TSE  compliance  declaration  and  risk 
summary for presence of nitrosamines, which were acceptable. 
2.4.   Non-clinical aspects 
Zoonotic  Influenza  Vaccine  Seqirus  is  submitted  as  an  informed  consent  application  of  Aflunov  under 
Article 10(c) of Directive 2001/83/EC. The present application cross-refers to the up-to-date non-clinical 
data of the original dossier of Aflunov, which has been assessed and authorised.  
2.4.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Due to the nature of the product (i.e., a vaccine comprised of proteins in an adjuvanted buffer solution) 
no ERA studies have been performed, since the product is unlikely to result in a significant risk to the 
environment. 
The  active  substance  is  a  natural  substance  (7.5  μg  of  haemagglutinin  antigen)  and  the  adjuvant 
MF59C.1 consists of squalene (a natural organic compound obtained from shark liver oil) polysorbate 80 
and sorbitan trioleate, in a sodium citrate / citric acid buffer. 
Influenza  vaccine  A/turkey/Turkey/1/05  (H5N1)  (egg  based,  surface  antigen,  inactivated,  adjuvanted 
MF59C.1), is already used in existing marketed products and no significant increase in environmental 
exposure is anticipated.  
2.5.  Clinical aspects 
Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus was submitted as an informed consent application of Aflunov under 
Article 10(c) of Directive 2001/83/EC.  
The  present  application  cross-refers  to  the  up-to-date  clinical  data  of  the  original  dossier  of  Aflunov, 
which has been assessed and authorised. 
Clinical  trials  (immunogenicity)  have  been  conducted  with  either  the  former  A/Vietnam/1194/2004 
(H5N1) (clade 1) or the A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (H5N1) vaccine strain (clade 2.2.1) currently approved 
as Aflunov. For this reason, the wording of indication was further amended to avoid reference to only 
“A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (H5N1)” like strain” that is how the current AFLUNOV vaccine is composed of, 
and replacing with “H5N1 subtype strain” leaving it more open.  
2.6.  Risk Management Plan 
Zoonotic  Influenza  Vaccine  Seqirus  is  submitted  as  an  informed  consent  application  of  Aflunov  under 
Article 10(c) of Directive 2001/83/EC.  
An RMP version 4.0 was submitted that is not in line with the latest approved EU-RMP version 4.11 of 
the cross-referred medicinal product. Since RMP is a common document to Foclivia pandemic vaccine 
and Aflunov zoonotic vaccine, the applicant should add the cross-referred product in Product Overview 
as Medicinal products to which the RMP refers and release an updated amended version. 
The applicant submitted an updated version 5.1 of the RMP to address such concerns. 
The RMP is in line with the approved EU-RMP version 5.0 of the cross-referred medicinal product. 
 
2.6.1.  Safety concerns 
The applicant proposed the following summary of safety concerns in the RMP:

2.6.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 5.1 is acceptable. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.7.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.7.2.  Periodic safety update reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
 
2.8.  Product information 
The proposed product information for Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus is mostly aligned with the latest 
approved  version  of  the  product  information  of  the  cross-referred  product  Aflunov.  Minor  changes 
proposed by both the CHMP Rapporteur and EMA Label during the assessment were implemented. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Aflunov. The bridging report submitted by the applicant 
has been found acceptable.  
2.8.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004 (REG), similarly to Aflunov, the “Zoonotic 
Influenza Vaccine Seqirus” is not included in the additional monitoring list for the following reason: 
informed consent of a product not included in the additional monitoring list. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
The  application  for  the  “Zoonotic  Influenza  Vaccine  Seqirus”  is  based  on  an  informed  consent  on  the 
pharmaceutical,  non-clinical  and  clinical  documentation  contained  in  the  marketing  authorisation  of 
Aflunov, as complemented by administrative and prescribing information.  
Taking into account the assessment of data previously undertaken for cross-referred medicinal product 
Aflunov, the benefit-risk balance for the “Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus” is considered positive.   
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus is favourable in the following 
indication(s): 
Active immunisation against H5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus. 
This indication is based on immunogenicity data from healthy subjects from the age of 18 years 
onwards following administration of two doses of the vaccine containing H5N1 subtype strain (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus should be used in accordance with official recommendations. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

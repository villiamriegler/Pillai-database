2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2014 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing recombinant human 
monoclonal IgG1 antibody for fibroblast growth factor 23 was considered justified based on pre-
clinical in vivo and clinical data in patients with the condition;  
the condition is chronically debilitating due to inadequate mineralization which results in soft bones 
and consequential bone deformities, and once the patients become weight bearing, it leads to the 
characteristic genu varum, genu valgum, tibial torsion, as well as rickets changes in metaphyses of 
the bones, especially notable in the wrists and knees on x-ray; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting between 0.002 to 0.04 per 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time the application was made; 
there exists no satisfactory method of treatment that has been authorised in the European Union 
for patients affected by the condition. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The condition submitted by the sponsor is for X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH). At the time of the 
initial designation this condition was well established in the literature.  
The disorder is reportedly linked to a mutation of the phosphate regulating gene homologous to 
endopeptidases on the X chromosome. This gene is believed to encode for fibroblast growth factor 23 
(FGF-23) which is expressed in bone.  
The gene defect leads to impaired proximal renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate due to reduced 
expression of sodium-phosphate (TRP), due to reduced expression of sodium-phosphate co-
transporters on the apical surface of the proximal renal tubule cells. Elevated FGF-23 levels cause the 
abnormal modulation of the vitamin D axis.  
The mutations inhibit FGF-23 inactivation, thus causing increased levels of free FGF-23 in the plasma 
and thereby causing hyperphosphaturia. There is also a loss of the conversion of 25(OH)-vitamin 
(Calcidiol) conversion to its active form 1,25(OH)-vitamin D. FGF-23 seems to play a central role on 
this axis through its phosphoturic effects and its autocrine action on osteoblasts, thus modulating bone 
mineralisation.  
Clinical features of XLH presents itself in the first years of life and can include short stature, reduced 
growth rate and bone deformity (Eur J Orthop Surg Traumatol (2015) 25:221-226).

FGF23  has  been  found  to  be  related  to  a  number  of  hereditable  and  acquired  phosphate  wasting 
disorders  which  the  literature  has  been  consolidating  these  disorders  under  the  term  of 
hypophosphtaemic rickets since the designation in 2014. Genetic disorders include X- linked dominant 
hypophosphatemic  rickets,  autosomal  recessive  hypophosphatemic  rickets,  autosomal  dominant 
hypophosphatemic  rickets,  hypophosphatemic  rickets  associated  with  McCune–Albright  syndrome  and 
Linear sebaceous nevus syndrome. Acquired disorders include tumour induced osteomalacia.  
Hypophosphatemic rickets is a genetic disorder and the X-linked inheritance (XLI) is the most frequent 
form  of  transmission,  accounting  for  about  80  %  of  the  familial  cases  of  hypophosphatemia.  The 
remaining 20 % of familial HR patients belong to the HR autosomal dominant and to the hereditary HR 
with calciuria types (Eur J Orthop Surg, Traumatol, February 2015, Volume 25, Issue 2,  pp 221–226). 
Furthermore the autosomal dominant hyposphatemic rickets (ADHR) patients have clinical and 
biochemical findings similar to those of X-linked dominant hypophosphataemic rickets patients. The 
autosomal forms show variable and incomplete penetrance with variable symptomatology and 
biochemical findings depending on the age at presentation. Patients who manifest the disease in their 
childhood develop short stature, rickets, bone pain, lower extremity deformities, and dental abscess. 
Some of the children have spontaneous resolution of symptoms during adulthood (Bone Research 
(2013) 2: 120-132).  
Autosomal-recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR), is a rare disorder that is recently recognized 
(Eur J Orthop Surg, Traumatol, February 2015, Volume 25, Issue 2, pp 221–226). Clinical and 
biochemical findings of the affected individuals are similar to ADHR and XLH. Clinical features include 
rickets, skeletal deformities, dental defects, and affected individuals develop sclerotic bone lesions and 
enthesopathies. The clinical presentation of ARHR is not found at birth. Affected individuals present 
signs of rickets/osteomalacia later during childhood and even in adulthood. 
In view of the grouping of the different forms of the condition linked with either a dysfunction of 
fibroblast growth factor 23 or a similarity in phosphate wasting signs and symptoms the COMP was of 
the opinion that the original condition could be broadened from X-linked hyphosphataemia to 
hypophosphataemic rickets. This was to include the autosomal forms and acquired forms described in 
review articles on hypophosphataemic rickets. 
The approved therapeutic indication “treatment of X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) in children and 
adolescents aged 1 to <18 years” falls within the scope of the amended orphan indication “treatment 
of hypophosphataemic rickets”.  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Based on the positive CHMP assessment, the intention to treat the condition has been justified.  
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
Clinical manifestations vary in severity, but patients most commonly present in childhood with bowing 
deformities of the legs. Progressive bowing, antero-medial rotational torsion of tibiae, and short 
stature represent the predominant skeletal outcomes in growing children. Osteomalacia (accumulation 
of unmineralized osteoid) is characteristic of hypophosphataemic rickets. 
The patients present with growth retardation and disproportionately short stature and limb deformities 
which appear after the ages of 1 or 2 years. In adulthood, the disease is associated with osteomalacia, 
musculoskeletal pain/stiffness and dental abscesses. 
When rickets is quickly and properly treated, there is a rapid improvement of the symptomatology, 
although treatment requires careful and frequent laboratory evaluation. Short stature may persist into

adult age. After 20 years of age, the treatment may become less aggressive and patients may be 
treated only with calcitriol. (Endocrine Connections (2014) 3, R13–R30). Identification of the causative 
mutation in patients with hypophosphatemic rickets may be useful to confirm the diagnosis and 
probably for prognosis. (Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes 2012, 19:460–467) 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor has provided a prevalence calculation which covers more recent publications than what 
was submitted at the time of designation, and information from the UK’s NIHR (RUDY) database. Below 
please find the table submitted by the sponsor of the publications used. 
Table 1.   
The condition is reported to be present in many of the EU Member States, the incidence however, 
seem to vary between the European countries. In Denmark it is reported as 3.9 in 100,000, in the UK 
as 3 in 100,000, and in Sweden as 5 in 100,000. This translates to an incidence of ~1 in 20,000. 
The data supports that the prevalence is stable and similar across Europe. Life expectancy for these 
patients is normal. Indeed if rickets is quickly and properly treated, there is a rapid improvement of 
the symptomatology, although treatment requires careful and frequent laboratory evaluation (Eur J 
Orthop Surg Traumatol (2015) 25:221-226). The same publications states: “After 20 years of age, the 
treatment may become less aggressive and patients may be treated only with calcitriol.”  
The sponsor proposes that the prevalence is 0.48 in 10,000 in Europe.  
Another approach to the test the proposed prevalence is the following: If the incidence of the condition 
is around the same in most Member States namely 1 in 20,000 and there is 5.1 million live births in 
the European Union this corresponds to 250 children born with the condition. If life expectancy is taken 
to be ~80 years this would correspond to around 20,000 individuals or a prevalence of 0.5 in 10,000 in 
Europe.  
The sponsor’s proposal of 0.48 in 10,000 is acceptable for the population with X-linked 
Hyphosphataemia. The remaining 20 % of familial HR patients belong to the HR autosomal dominant 
and to the hereditary HR with calciuria types (Eur J Orthop Surg, Traumatol, February 2015, Volume 
25, Issue 2,  pp 221–226). As the COMP asked the sponsor to expand the condition to 
Hypophosphataemic rickets which includes the autosomal forms described in the literature the 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/51018/2018  
  Page 6/8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
prevalence slightly increased. The sponsor amended the prevalence accordingly to 0.6 in 10,000 to 
account for the additional forms described in the literature.  
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
There are no products authorised for the treatment of this condition. Calcitriol or alfacalcidol and 
phosphate supplementation are used from the time of diagnosis until growth is complete. Current 
outcomes of this therapy are still not optimal, and therapies targeting the pathophysiology of the 
disease, i.e. FGF23 excess, are desirable. (Endocrine Connections (2014) 3, R13–R30) There are no 
specific guidelines for the management or treatment of patients with this condition in Europe. 
Gudielines have been pubished in the US in 2011 for X-linked hypophosphataemia (J Bone Miner Res. 
2011 July ; 26(7): 1381–1388.). This guideline recommends combining active vitamin D metabolites 
with a balanced dose of phosphate asa the mainstay of therapy.  
In a recent publication in the Lancet in 2014 (Lancet 2014;383:1665-76) a treatment algorithm divides 
the treatment by parathyroid hormone levels. If parathyroid hormone levels are elevated and Vitamin 
D levels are low, the vitamin D deficiency should be treated. The article highlights that in this setting 
the treatment is with a vitamin D preparation ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol. If the Vitamin D levels 
are not low the physician should retake the history and consider a vitamin D pathway defect.

4.  COMP position adopted on 15 January 2018 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) considered that the designated orphan 
condition, X-linked hypophosphataemia, should be renamed as “hypophosphataemic rickets” 
(hereinafter referred to as “the condition”). 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of hypophosphataemic rickets was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was 
concluded to be 0.6 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the 
designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to inadequate mineralization which results in soft bones 
and consequential bone deformities, and once the patients become weight bearing, it leads to the 
characteristic genu varum, genu valgum, tibial torsion, as well as rickets changes in metaphyses of 
the bones, especially notable in the wrists and knees on x-ray; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the European Union for 
patients affected by the condition.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Crysvita, burosumab, 
recombinant human monoclonal IgG1 antibody for fibroblast growth factor 23, EU/3/14/1351 for 
treatment of hypophosphataemic rickets is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan 
Medicinal Products.

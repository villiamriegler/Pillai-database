1.  Introduction 
On  19th  of  July  2023,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Study  D5290C00005 
(MEDLEY), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. The Study was 
completed by 20 January 2023.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  stated  that  Study  D5290C00005  (EudraCT  no.  2019-000201-69)  titled  “A  Phase  2/3 
Randomized,  Double-blind,  Palivizumab-controlled  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Safety  of  MEDI8897,  a 
Monoclonal Antibody with an Extended Half-life Against Respiratory Syncytial Virus, in High-risk Children 
(MEDLEY)” is part of a clinical development program.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Nirsevimab  is  a  recombinant  human  immunoglobulin  G1  kappa  mAb  directed  against  the  prefusion 
conformation of the RSV F protein (Zhu et al 2017).  
It  binds  to  a  discontinuous  epitope  displayed  by  the  native,  quaternary  structure  on  the  apex  of  the 
prefusion conformation of the F protein (F protein residues 62-96 and 196-212, within antigenic site Ø, 
site zero). Site Ø is lost as the F protein transitions to the post-fusion conformation, i.e. nirsevimab is 
specific for the pre-fusion state of F (McLellan 2013 and 2015, Zhu 2017, Swanson 2014). 
The mAb exhibits neutralising activity against both RSV subtype A and B strains, by locking the F protein 
in the pre-fusion conformation, thereby inhibiting  entry of free  virions into cells, as well as inhibiting 
spread of cell-associated virus by cell fusion. The mAb does not inhibit attachment of virions to cells. 
This mode of action is similar to the mode of action for palivizumab (palivizumab targets epitope site II, 
binds  pre-  as  well  as  postfusion  conformations  of  the  RSV  F  protein,  and  likely  neutralizes  virus  by 
sterically inhibiting the cell fusion step). 
Nirsevimab  finished  product  is  a  sterile,  preservative-free,  solution  for  intramuscular  injection.  It  is 
supplied as a single-dose pre-filled syringe (PFS) in two strengths: 50 mg (in 0.5 mL solution) and 100mg 
(in 1 mL solution). The formulation is suitable for the paediatric population and the product is already 
approved for children entering their first RSV season. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
Nirsevimab is approved for prevention of RSV disease in all infants (preterm and term), including high-
risk infants through their first RSV season and is under review for children up to 24 months of age who 
remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second season. Nirsevimab (BEYFORTUS®) was 
first approved in the EU/EEA on 31 October 2022. 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
According  to  Article  46  of  the  Regulation  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  (EC)  No. 
1901/2006, and Regulation 78A (13) and (14) of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, as inserted by 
the Human Medicines (Amendment etc.) (EU  Exit) Regulations 2019,  marketing  authorisation holder-
sponsored studies which involve the use in the paediatric population of a medicinal product covered by 
a marketing authorisation, whether or not they are conducted in compliance with an agreed paediatric 
investigation plan, shall be submitted to the competent authority within 6 months of completion of the 
studies concerned.

•  Study D5290C00005 (MEDLEY) 
A Phase 2/3 randomized, double-blind, palivizumab-controlled study to evaluate the safety of MEDI8897, 
a monoclonal antibody with an extended half-life against respiratory syncytial virus, in high-risk children 
(MEDLEY) 
CHMP’s comments 
According to the paediatric regulation Article 46, the MAH has submitted the final study report for the 
MEDLEY  study:  A  Phase  2/3  randomized,  double-blind,  palivizumab-controlled  study  to  evaluate  the 
safety of MEDI8897, a monoclonal antibody with an extended half-life against respiratory syncytial virus, 
in high-risk children. 
Interim data from the study has been evaluated twice by the EMA.  
Firstly, at time of initial MAA, where data on the first RSV season in vulnerable children were evaluated.  
Secondly, when the population has completed the second RSV season. This part of the study is currently 
under evaluation by EMA for an indication of prevention of RSV in the children’s second RSV season.  
In the present submission which includes the final analysis, all CLD/CHD subjects completed follow-up 
through 360 days post first dose in Season 2 and included all Season 1 and Season 2 safety, efficacy, 
PK, and ADA data available at the time of the DBL, including Season 1 data through 360 days post first 
dose.  
Please  refer  to  the  EPAR  of  the  initial  MAA  (EMEA/H/C/005304/0000)  for  detailed  description  of  the 
MEDLEY study. In this report the results on efficacy and safety up to day 360 in season 2 are assessed, 
and it is evaluated whether amendment of the SmPC is considered relevant.  
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study D5290C00005 (MEDLEY) 
Description 
MEDLEY was a pivotal, Phase II/III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, palivizumab-controlled study 
in infants at higher risk for RSV severe disease eligible to receive palivizumab when entering their first 
or second RSV season.

Methods 
Study participants 
For season 1, the population consisted of two cohorts: preterm infants ≤ 35+0 weeks gestational age 
with no lower limit of gestational age, besides for the population in Japan in which the gestational age 
was 29-35 weeks. The second cohort consisted of term and preterm infants in their first year of life with 
either chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) or congenital heart disease (CHD) 
For season 2, subjects from the CLD/CHD cohort from the MEDLEY Season 1 study, i.e. patients who 
had received either nirsevimab or palivizumab were invited to participate.  
Children from the preterm cohort from the MEDLEY  Season 1 study were not included for the second 
season intervention. 
Treatments 
RSV season 1:  
In the first RSV season, subjects were randomised to weight-based dose of nirsevimab (50 mg if < 5 kg 
or 100 mg if ≥ 5 kg) or palivizumab 15mg/kg once monthly x 5. Relevant placebo injections were used 
in order to keep the blinding.  
All subjects were followed through 360 days post dose 1 in RSV Season 1.  
RSV season 2: 
Subjects  in  the  CLD/CHD  cohort  dosed  with  nirsevimab  in  the  first  RSV  season  were  assigned  to 
nirsevimab 200 mg IM followed by 4 once-monthly IM doses of placebo (n=200) in the second season. 
Subjects in the CLD/CHD cohort dosed with palivizumab during the first season were randomly assigned 
to  either  Nirsevimab  200  mg  IM  followed  by  4  once-monthly  IM  doses  of  placebo  or  Palivizumab  15 
mg/kg IM once-monthly for 5 months in a 1:1 fashion. 
Subjects in the CLD/CHD cohort dosed in the second RSV season were followed through 360 days post 
dose 1 in the second RSV season. Subjects in the CLD/CHD cohort who underwent cardiac surgery with 
cardiopulmonary  bypass  received  a  replacement  dose  and  were  followed  through  1  year  after  the 
replacement dose.  
Objective(s) and endpoints: 
Primary and secondary objectives and endpoints are shown in the table. The objectives up to day 360 
for  season  1  and up  to  day  150  for  season  2  was  evaluated  in  a  previous  procedure.  Hence,  for  the 
current procedure efficacy data to day 360 for season 2 is evaluated (exploratory endpoint) and safety 
data up to day 360 for season 2 is evaluated.

Sample size 
The sample size calculation was based on safety, and 600 subjects were to be exposed to nirsevimab 
and 300 to palivizumab. Hence, approximately 900 palivizumab-eligible infants entering their first RSV 
season were to be enrolled into one of 2 cohorts: (i) preterm cohort, including approximately 600 preterm 
infants born < 35 wGA without CLD/CHD, or (ii) CLD/CHD cohort, including approximately 300 infants 
with  CLD  of  prematurity  or  haemodynamically  significant  CHD.  A  minimum  of  100  infants  with 
haemodynamically significant CHD were to be enrolled.  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
The randomization was stratified by age group (≤ 3 months, > 3 to ≤ 6 months, > 6 months) at season 
1 and hemisphere within each cohort. Randomization was not stratified by CLD/CHD disease, however, 
the two cohorts (preterm and CLD/CHD) were balanced between treatment groups.  
The study was double-blinded. 
Statistical Methods 
There were 3 planned analyses for this study:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
the Primary Analysis (RSV Season 1 Cohort to Day 151),  
analysis of RSV Season 1 Cohort to Day 361 and RSV Season 2 CHD/CLD Cohort to Day 151 
the Final Analysis (conducted when all subjects completed the last study visit and included 
all study data collected).  
Descriptive statistics were used for efficacy  variables.  Furthermore, extrapolation was used to assess 
efficacy, which is currently under evaluation in another procedure (EMEA/H/C/005304/II/0005).

Season 2
Recruitment 
Season 1:  
In the overall population (CLD/CHD cohort and preterm cohort), 960 subjects were screened, of whom 
925 were enrolled (CLD/CHD cohort (n=310) and preterm cohort (n=615)), and randomised (2:1) to 
nirsevimab (n = 616) or palivizumab (n = 309).  
Overall, 99.2% of subjects received IP, 91.1% completed treatment, 95.8% completed Day 151 follow-
up for RSV Season 1 and 87.1% completed follow-up for season 1.  
Season 2:  
Of the 310 subjects in the CLD/CHD cohort, 262 subjects continued into RSV season 2 study. Of those, 
180 subjects had been randomised to nirsevimab in season 1, and 82 subjects had been randomised to 
palivizumab in season 1. The nirsevimab group from season 1 received nirsevimab in season 2 (nirs/nirs, 
n=180), the palivizumab group were rerandomized to nirsevimab or palivizumab in season 2 (pali/nirs, 
n=40, pali/pali n=42). Of the 262 subjects who continued into season 2, 256 subjects (97.7%) completed 
day 151 follow-up and 253 subjects (96.6%) completed the day 360 follow-up. 
Baseline data 
Season 1:  
The  baseline  characteristics  were  balanced  between  the  two  treatment  arms  in  both  cohorts.  In  the 
CLD/CHD, the median age at baseline was 1.8 months higher than the preterm group (4.6 months and 
2.8 months). As such, the median body weight was also marginally higher (5 kg and 4.3 kg).

Season 2: 
At time of dosing in season 2, median body weight was 9.7 kg with IQR of 8.9 kg to 10.9 kg. 
PK and immunogenicity results 
Following a single dose of nirsevimab, serum concentrations declined linearly over time. In Season 1, 
there was substantial overlap  in serum  concentrations between  weight groups (< 5  kg,  ≥  5  kg), with 
comparable  serum  concentrations  in  preterm  and  CLD/CHD  subjects.  In  CLD/CHD  subjects,  serum 
concentrations were slightly higher in Season 2, with substantial overlap in the serum concentrations 
observed for weight-band dose in Season 1 and the fixed dose in Season 2.  
Summary of nirsevimab serum concentrations are shown in table 32 and 33.

Of the subjects who had serum samples available for testing during Season 1, ADA was detected at any 
time post-baseline in 5.8% (34/587) of subjects in the nirsevimab group. Treatment-emergent ADA to 
nirsevimab were detected in 5.7% (22/385) of subjects in the preterm cohort and 5.0% (10/202) in the 
CLD/CHD cohort. 
In the overall population, of all subjects in the nirsevimab group who were post-baseline ADA-positive, 
a  total  of  6.3%  (2/32)  of  subjects  on  Day  361  had  neutralising  ADA;  there  were  no  subjects  with 
neutralising ADA on Day 31 or Day 151. 
In the preterm cohort, of all subjects in the nirsevimab group who were post-baseline ADA-positive, a 
total  of  4.3%  (1/23)  of  subjects  on  Day  361  had  neutralising  ADA;  there  were  no  subjects  with 
neutralising ADA on Day 31 or Day 151. 
In the CLD/CHD cohort, of all subjects in the nirsevimab group who were post-baseline ADA-positive, a 
total of 11.1% (1/9) of subjects Day 361 had neutralising ADA; there were no subjects with neutralising 
ADA on Day 31 or Day 151. 
For those CLD/CHD subjects in the NIRS/NIRS group in Season 2, ADA was detected in 7/174 (4.0%) 
subjects  at  Season  1  Day  361.  In  Season  2,  ADA  was  detected  in  1/90  (1.1%),  0/168  (0.0%),  and 
13/144 (9.0%) subjects at Day 31, Day 151, and Day 361, respectively.  
CHMP’s comments 
The  pharmacokinetics  are  as  expected  and  known  from  the  initial  studies  and  PK  linearity  was 
confirmed.  The  aspired  exposures  were  reached  in  all  subgroups.  No  changes  are  required  to  the 
SmPC. 
The immunogenicity results in RSV season 1 are in line with the ones from the pooled data from the 
primary cohort of subjects in MELODY and Study 3 entering their first RSV season, who received the 
proposed dose of nirsevimab regarding post-baseline ADA (5.8 vs. 5.7 %) and treatment-emergent 
ADA  (5.7  vs.  5.6%).  Regarding  the  neutralising  antibodies  these  were  higher  with  6,3%  vs.  0.9% 
however the absolute numbers were small. 
The first dose of nirsevimab did not appear to prime an anti-drug immune response after the second 
exposure to nirsevimab in Season 2 who received nirsevimab in both seasons, the second dose did

not  boost  immune  responses  in  previously  ADA-positive  subjects  from  Season  1.  Of  note,  in  the 
ongoing type II variation (II-05), the MAH is asked to improve the drug tolerance of the ADA assay.  
Efficacy results 
The incidence of MA RSV LRTI in Season 2 from 151 through 361 days post first dose by RSV subtype is 
summarised in Table 34. 
There were 2 instances of MA RSV LRTI from 151 through 360 days post first dose in Season 2, in the 
PALI/NIRS and PALI/PALI groups (1/40 subjects [2.5%] each). 
Table 34 Incidence of MA RSV LRTI by RSV Subtype from 151 Through 361 Days Post First 
Dose in Season 2 – ITT Population 
CHMP’s comments 
In season 2 from day 151 to 361 post dose, there were only 2 cases of MA RSV LRTI, whereas one of 
the cases was in the treatment group who had received palivizumab in the first and second RSV season, 
and the other case was in the treatment group who had received palivizumab in the first season and 
nirsevimab  in  the  second  season.  Those  descriptive  results  do  not  suggest  any  differences  between 
palivizumab and nirsevimab in the period where the RSV season has ended.  
Safety results 
Nirsevimab had a favourable and comparable safety and tolerability profile to the current standard of 
care, palivizumab, in the overall population, preterm infants and those with CLD and/or CHD in Season 
1,  with  similarly  favourable  and  comparable  safety  and  tolerability  for  subjects  with  CLD/CHD  who 
received nirsevimab in Season 2.  
The  types  and  frequencies  of  AEs  were  generally  balanced  between  subjects  in  the  nirsevimab  and 
palivizumab groups, with a low incidence of, investigator-assessed AESIs, NOCDs, and IP-related events 
(including IP-related skin reactions). There were no subjects with IP-related events of ≥ Grade 3 severity, 
IP-related SAEs, or IP-related NOCDs.  
Overall in RSV Season 1 (up to 360 days post first dose), 72.3% of subjects in the nirsevimab group and 
70.7% of subjects in the palivizumab group, had at least one AE. A majority of the events were of Grade 
1  or  Grade  2  severity.  Five  fatal  events  occurred  in  the  nirsevimab  group:  2  in  the  preterm  cohort 
(bronchiolitis and COVID-19) and 3 in the CLD/CHD cohort (cardiac failure congestive, cardiogenic shock, 
and  pneumonia).  One  fatal  event  occurred  in  the  palivizumab  group:  bronchiolitis  in  an  infant  in  the 
CLD/CHD  cohort.  All  fatal  events  were  judged  as  unrelated  to  IP  and  these  infants  all  had  serious, 
complex underlying medical conditions at baseline.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/4418/2024  
Page 14/15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The overall frequency of subjects with SAEs was similar between the nirsevimab and palivizumab groups 
(13.0% vs 12.5%), and none was considered by the investigator to be IP-related. In RSV Season 2 (up 
to 360 days post first dose in subjects with CHD/CLD), 72.5% of subjects had at least one AE (69.0% in 
the PALI/PALI group, 77.5% in the PALI/NIRS group, 72.2% in the NIRS/NIRS group); and the majority 
of events were Grade 1 or 2 severity. No fatal events were reported and the incidence of SAEs and/or 
AEs ≥ Grade 3 was numerically higher in the NIRS/NIRS (10.6%) and PALI/NIRS (10.0%) groups than 
in the PALI/PALI (4.8%) group; however, this was not observed within all analysed time points through 
30 days post first dose.  
None of AEs in RSV Season 2 were considered to be IP-related. Adverse events of special interest based 
on investigator assessment and NOCDs were reported in one subject each in the NIRS/NIRS group. There 
were no deaths in Season 2. 
CHMP’s comments 
The final CSR provides additional safety data from MEDLEY Study RSV Season 2, Day 151 to Day 360 
post first dose, compared to interim data on TEAE’s through at least 150 days post first dose in season 
2, currently under evaluation in variation EMEA/H/C/005304/II/0005 for an indication of prevention of 
RSV in the children’s second RSV season. 
Patient exposure to IP was 220 subjects in RSV season 2 (MEDLEY, n= 180 + 40 = 220). 
Overall, the safety profile of nirsevimab is adequately characterised, and generally in accordance with 
the safety profile for RSV Season 1. Although, a relatively high proportion of subjects experienced ≥ 1 
TEAE in the CLD/CHD subpopulations through up to 360 days post first dose in Season 2, there were no 
IP-related TEAs of ≥Grade 3, no IP-related serious events, no IP-related AESI based on selected MedDRA 
PT codes, no IP-related skin reactions and no IP-related NOCD.  There was no clear clinically meaningful 
pattern of TEAs by SOC and PT by time relative to dosing across the treatment groups ion the CLD and 
CHD subpopulations. In the MEDLEY study, RSV season 2 there were no AE’s with the outcome of death 
and there were no reported discontinuations due to adverse events. 
No new adverse drug reactions have been reported. Some aspects  regarding serious adverse events, 
safety in special populations and subjects weighing less than 7 kg need to be elucidated, and is currently 
under  review  in  variation  EMEA/H/C/005304/II/0005,  with  outstanding  issues  that  may  lead  to 
amendments of the SmPC. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Regarding  the  clinical  pharmacology  PK  linearity  were  confirmed.  The  submitted  study  report  did not 
show any new findings and thus did not give rise to changes or amendments in the summary of product 
characteristics regarding clinical pharmacology.  
Regarding clinical efficacy and safety, there is no new information that will lead to an amendment of the 
SmPC.  
In the variation EMEA/H/C/005304/II/0005 which is currently under evaluation by the CHMP, there are 
still some outstanding issues that may lead to amendments of the SmPC.  
3.  Rapporteur’s CHMP overall conclusion and 
recommendation

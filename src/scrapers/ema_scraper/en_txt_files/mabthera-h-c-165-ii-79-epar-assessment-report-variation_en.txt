2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Granulomatosis  with  polyangiitis  (GPA)  –  also  known  as  Wegener’s  granulomatosis  (WG)  –  and 
microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are both associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) 
and  are  therefore  referred  to  collectively  as  ANCA-associated  vasculitis  (AAV).  The  causative  role  of 
ANCAs  in  generating  small-vessel  vasculitis  has  been  demonstrated  in  several  in-vitro  and  in-vivo 
models.  This  concept  is  confirmed  in  patients  by  the  fact  that  systemic  disease  flares  did  not  occur 
unless ANCAs persisted or returned in patients in remission of AAV [Boomsma et al. 2000]. Two types 
of ANCA have been identified in GPA and MPA, defined by the antigenicity against two different self –
antigens which are the endogenous enzymes; MPO (myeloperoxidase) and PR3 (proteinase-3) that are 
present in neutrophilic lymphocytes. ANCA-serology has a different distribution between GPA and MPA.

GPA  is  mainly  associated  with  PR3-ANCA  (95%  of  the  cases),  whereas  MPA  is  more  frequently 
associated with MPO-ANCA (75% of MPA patients).  
AAV  are  rare  disorders,  with  an  estimated  yearly  incidence  of  1  in  100,000  in  Europe.  The  clinical 
features  of  GPA  and  MPA  largely  overlap,  as  necrotizing  vasculitis  may  occur  in  the  same  organs.  In 
GPA,  crusting  granulomata  in  the  ear,  nose  and  throat  area  and  alveolar  bleeding  are  the  most 
prominent  feature,  and  segmental,  necrotizing  glomerulonephritis  may  occur  in  about  50%  of  the 
cases. In MPA, glomerulonephritis is the most prominent feature present in virtual all patients, whereas 
the respiratory tract may be spared. In both GPA and MPA, vasculitis may be extended to other organs 
like  the  skin,  nervous  system  (specifically  vaso  nervorum  of  peripheral  nerves),  heart  and 
gastrointestinal  (GI)  tract  (mesenterium).  CNS  involvement  is  relatively  rare  for  both  disorders. 
Systemic features (fever, arthritis) are more common in MPA. The distinction between both entities is 
made by histology (Chapel-Hill Concensus Conference criteria, see table 1 below).

Until the late 1960s the prognosis of WG was poor, with mortality rate of 80% within 1 year, mainly 
because of renal failure and GI/alveolar bleedings. With the introduction of cyclophosphamide therapy 
in the 1970s, prognosis has significantly improved, with reported remission rates of flares of 70-90%, 
and survival rate of 80% in 5 years. Mortality is also reduced by improved supportive care of renal 
failure. The clinical response to induction therapy with cyclophosphamide (CYC) is reported to be 
similar for MPA and GPA, although the relapse-rate is reported to be higher for PR-3 ANCA+ GPA (60-
80% within 2 years) than for MPA (about 30%). In general, GPA relapses are more progressive of 
nature (i.e. more severe symptoms and more organs involved), than for MPA. 
However CYC is associated with signicant toxicity, such as uro-toxicity (haemorrhagic cystitis, bladder 
cancer), cardio-toxicity, malignancies (lymphoma, thyroid cancer, non-melanoma skin cancer), 
lymphopenia and neutropenia, serious and opportunistic infections, thrombocytopenia and reduced 
fertility. Because of its toxicity, its use is limited to short-term induction therapy of severe flares, 
followed by maintenance therapy with other,  in general better-tolerated immune-suppressant agents, 
like AZA (azathioprine), MFM (mycophenolate mofetil)  or MTX (methotrexate). Mild-isolated cases of 
GPA granulomata may be treated with MTX alone. In a recent series, encompassing a mean follow-up 
of 17.8 months, 50% of participants suffered either severe or life-threatening adverse effects 
associated with conventional therapies (WG etanercept trial -WGET). Since currently available 
therapies are associated with significant toxicities, as well as disease relapses when therapy is tapered 
or discontinued, there is a need for novel, more specific treatment approaches.  
The rationale of developing B-cell targeting therapy with rituximab in AAV is that the number of 
activated B cells in the periphery has been shown to correlate with the extent of disease activity (Popa 
Mabthera

et al. 1999). Short-lived plasma cells, thought to be a major source of pathogenic autoantibodies like 
ANCAs, are the terminally differentiated progeny of antigen-specific B-cell precursors. Without their B-
cell precursors, short-lived plasma cells disappear after about 2 weeks.  
Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against CD20, a cell surface antigen expressed on B-lymphocytes. 
It  depletes  peripheral  CD19/20+  -B  cells,  thereby  reducing  the  production  of  antibodies,  including 
those  related  to  auto-immune  reactions.  Anti-CD20  therapy  effectively  eliminates  most  circulating  B 
cells, while allowing restoration of much of the B-cell lineage once B cell production resumes.  Thus, by 
depleting  CD20+  B  cells,  rituximab  may  disrupt  critical  B-cell  contributions  to  disease  and  suppress 
autoantibody production and could potentially contribute to the restoration of B-cell tolerance to ANCA 
antigens.   
The currently approved indications for Mabthera (rituximab) include Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL), 
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) and 3rd line treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).  
The  MAH  proposes  to  extend  the  indications  to  include  severely  active  GPA  (granulomatosis  with 
polyangiitis, also called Wegener’s disease) and MPA (microscopic polyangiitis), in combination therapy 
with high-doses of glucocorticoids. 
The  proposed  posology  of  the  GPA/MPA  indications  is  the  same  as  proposed  for  the  NHL  indications, 
i.e.  375  mg/m2  body  surface  area,  administered  as  an  intravenous  infusion  once  weekly  for  4 
sequential  weeks.  Specific  guidance  for  concurrent  therapy  with  corticosteroids  is  provided  in  Section 
4.2 of the SPC. Sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SPC are also updated with the clinical trial outcomes 
in the sought indications.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
Not applicable for this procedure. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Since the pharmacologically active substance in MabThera, rituximab, is a monoclonal antibody, a non-
conjugated protein, it is exempted from the requirement of providing an ERA as in accordance with the 
Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(CHMP/SWP/4447/00), it is unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The  indication  claim  is  based  on  data  from  a  single  pivotal  study,  ITN021AI  (RAVE),  a  multicenter 
study  comparing  rituximab  treatment  against  the  current  standard  of  care  (CYC)  and  against  a 
historical control.

In  addition,  published  data  from  RITUXVAS,  a  Phase  II,  open-label,  two-group,  randomized  study  of 
44 patients  from  8  centers  in  Europe  and  Australia  were  provided  as  supportive.    The  study  was 
sponsored  and  conducted  by 
the  Cambridge  University  Hospitals  NHS  Foundation  Trust 
(United Kingdom) and the European Vasculitis Study Group (EUVAS).

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic data were derived from 487 serum samples from 97 patients treated with rituximab at 
the  pivotal  study  RAVE.  Rituximab  (375  mg/m2)  was  administered  to  patients  by  IV  infusion  on  the 
first  day  of  Weeks  1,  2,  3,  and  4.  Rituximab  levels  were  evaluated  prior  to  the  first  and  third  doses, 
then  on  Days  29,  60,  120,180,  270,  and  545  from the  first  dose.  The  primary  goals  for  this  analysis 
were  to  evaluate  the  PK  characteristics of  rituximab  in  AAV  patients  by  quantifying  the  PK  as  well  as 
the relationship between PK parameters and covariates in this study. 
The population PK analysis encompassed a total of 487 rituximab serum samples from 97 patients who 
received multiple infusions of rituximab in combination with a glucocorticoid. 
The study population consisted of 45 males and 52 females with age ranging from 16 to 92 years and 
BSA ranging from 1.43 to 2.45 m2. The subject population was predominantly white (91.820 (20.6%) 
study subjects out of 97 were HACA-positive.  
The  typical  population  estimates  (%SEE)  of  rituximab  clearance  (CL),  and  volume  of  distribution  in 
central  compartment  (V1)  were  0.289  L/day  (4.39%),  and  4.42  L  (3.21%),  respectively.  The  inter-
patient variability (%SEE) for CL, and V1 were 42.1% (13.8%), and 26.8% (18.9%), respectively. The 
median of individual estimates of T1/2 of rituximab for 97 patients with GPA and MPA  was 23.4 days 
(range:  9.38−48.7  days)  (Table  2.4.2.1).  Sex  and  HACA  were  important  covariates  explaining  inter-

individual  variability  on  CL.  The  estimate  of  t1/2,  based  on  the  final  model  was  very  similar  between 
male patients and female patients (23.6 and 24.9 days, respectively). The HACA-positive patients were 
associated with shorter t1/2 than HACA-negative patients (19.0 vs. 25.6 days). 
Table 3  Mean PK parameters. 
The  individual  AUC0-inf  were  similar  between  patients  who  achieved  a  complete  remission  and  those 
who failed the primary endpoint at Month 6 (Table 2.4.1.2). 
Table 4  AUC0–inf for Rituximab Patients with and without Complete Remission at 6 Months 
(Per-Protocol Population) 
In addition, there was no correlation between the achievement of complete remission at Month 6 and 
the individual AUC0-inf as indicated by a Spearman coefficient of correlation of 0.01. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics  
No clinical pharmacodynamics studies were submitted. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall the PK parameters of rituximab in AAV patients were similar to those previously observed in RA 
patients and typical for IgG antibodies (Frazer 1999). Sex and presence of HACA antibodies were 
important covariates explaining inter-individual variability in clearance, however, no dose adjustment 
according to sex or HACA status is necessary. 
2.4.5.  Conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall the PK parameters were similar to what was seen previously for rituximab and other 
monoclonal antibodies.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
This  application  for  an  extension  of  indication  of  Mabthera  for  the  treatment of  GPA/MPA  is  based  on 
data  from  a  single  pivotal  study,  ITN021AI  (RAVE).  In  addition,  a  summary  based  on  the  published

Phase II RITUXVAS trial was provided in this submission as supportive data.  A number of publications 
of  small  uncontrolled  investigator  initiated  studies  involving  rituximab  in  AAV  (see  table  5)  was 
submitted. Most studies are small including only few patients treated with rituximab due to intolerance 
or  treatment  failure  on  conventional  therapy  with  CYC.  These  studies  will  not  be  discussed  as 
supportive of efficacy.  
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
No specific dose response study was performed. The dose selection was based on the experience with 
the  use  of  Mabthera  in  the  approved  heamatology  indications  and  an  investigator-sponsored,  open-
label  study  of  patients  with  refractory  AAV.  In  this  study,  rituximab  375  mg/m2  weekly  for  4  weeks 
was used and induction of remission was achieved. The study assessed the clinical effects of rituximab 
375  mg/m2  once  weekly  for  4  weeks  in  combination  with  glucocorticoid  in  11  patients  with 
antineutrophil  cytoplasmatic  antibody  (ANCA)  associated  vasculitis  (AAV).  Disease  remission  was 
induced  in  all  11  patients  and  glucocorticoids  were  tapered  successfully  in  all  patients.  Ten  patients 
achieved BWAS/WG scores of 0 within 6 months. Remission was maintained in all patients as long as B 
lymphocytes were undetectable. It was shown in the above mentioned study by Keough et al, that the 
rituximab dose chosen was able to induce remission in patients with AAV.

Study participants 
Main Inclusion criteria: 
Diagnosis type: had a diagnosis of WG or MPA according to the definitions of the Chapel Hill Consensus 
Conference.  
Screening diagnosis: had newly diagnosed disease or must have had a disease flare  
Disease activity: had active disease with a BVAS/WG ≥ 3 that would normally have required treatment 
with CYC. 
Disease severity: had severe disease (i.e., one or more of the major BVAS/WG items listed in Table 2 
of the protocol), or disease severe enough to require treatment with CYC. 
ANCA status: was positive for either proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA or myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA at the 
Screening Visit. 
Patients with biopsy-proven, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis who did not have evidence of disease in 
non-renal  organ  systems  were  also  eligible,  provided  that  they  were  positive  for  PR3-ANCA  or  MPO-
ANCA antibodies. 
Main Exclusion Criteria: 
Diagnosis:  had  a  diagnosis  of  Churg  Strauss  syndrome  as  defined  by  the  Chapel  Hill  Consensus 
Conference  
Disease severity: 
a. Limited disease: limited disease that would not normally be treated with CYC. 
b.  Severe  disease:  required  mechanical  ventilation  because  of  alveolar  hemorrhage.  -  Co-
morbidities, such as allergies, infections, liver disease, renal disease, malignancies. 
Treatments 
Patients in both arms received 1 g intravenous (IV) pulse methylprednisolone (or an equivalent IV dose 
of  another  glucocorticoid preparation),  followed  by  protocol-mandated  oral  prednisone  taper  (starting 
at 1 mg/kg/day, not exceeding 80 mg/day).  Depending on the patient’s presenting clinical and disease 
state, the investigator could repeat the IV glucocorticoid administration for up to, but not exceeding, 3 
days  of  therapy  (total  of  3g  methylprednisolone  or  dose-equivalent  of  another  glucocorticoid 
preparation).    Prednisone  tapering  was  to  be  completed  by  the  Month  6  Visit  in  order  to  meet  the 
definition of complete remission. 
The study consisted of two phases: 
• 
• 
a 6-month remission-induction phase followed by  
a 12-month remission-maintenance phase.   
During the  remission-induction  phase,  patients  in  the  control  arm  received  oral  prednisone  daily, 
rituximab  placebo  infusions  once weekly  for  4 weeks,  and  oral  CYC  daily  (2 mg/kg/day)  for  3  to 
Mabthera

6 months.    Patients  in  the  experimental  arm  received  oral  prednisone  daily,  rituximab  (375 mg/m2) 
infusions once weekly for 4 weeks, and CYC placebo daily for 3 to 6 months.   
During  the  remission-maintenance  phase,  patients  in  the  control  arm  discontinued  CYC  and  started 
oral azathioprine (AZA) (2 mg/kg/day), and patients in the experimental arm discontinued CYC placebo 
and started oral AZA placebo daily.  Both arms continued oral AZA/AZA placebo daily up to Month 18.  
Upon  achievement  of  remission  in  the  RTX  group,  no  additional  maintenance  therapy  was  to  be 
provided  to  these  patients.  Patients  in  either  group  who  achieved  remission,  defined  as  a  BVAS/WG 
of 0 before  completing  6  months  of  therapy,  could  stop  induction  therapy  and  start  maintenance 
therapy after completing 3 months of induction therapy.  An exception was that any patient who was in 
remission  (BVAS/WG = 0)  and  developed  hemorrhagic  cystitis  before  Month  3  after  his  or  her  most 
recent rituximab/rituximab placebo infusion could start maintenance therapy. 
Patients who experienced severe disease flares or treatment failure between Visit V5 (1 week after the 
last  rituximab/rituximab  placebo  infusion)  and  Visit V8  (i.e.,  the  Month  6  Visit)  switched  to  the 
alternative treatment in a blinded manner (see Figure 1), unless specifically contraindicated.  Patients 
who  experienced  severe  flares  during  months  6  to  18  could  be  treated  with  open-label  rituximab  or 
according to best medical judgment if rituximab was contraindicated per the investigator’s assessment. 
An overview of study design is presented in Figure1.

Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  RAVE  was  to  demonstrate  non-inferiority  of  rituximab  efficacy  as  compared 
with conventional therapy (CYC/AZA) and superiority to historical control. 
The secondary objective was superiority of rituximab to CYC for the percentage of patients who had a 
BVAS/WG of 0 and successfully completed the glucocorticoid taper by 6 months after randomization.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  percentage  of  patients  who  achieved  complete  remission  at  Month  6, 
defined  as  a  BVAS/WG  of  0  and  successful  completion  of  the  glucocorticoid  taper  at  Month  6  (i.e., 
completely off glucocorticoids).   
The secondary efficacy endpoint was testing of superiority of rituximab treatment at month 6. 
The tertiary efficacy endpoints for RAVE were as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The cumulative BVAS/WG area under the curve (AUC) during the 6 months after randomization 
The  percentage  of  patients  who  achieved  and  maintained  partial  remission  as  defined  by  having 
BVAS ≤ 2 and off glucocorticoids at Month 6 
The percentage of patients who achieved a BVAS/WG of 0 on prednisone < 10 mg/day at 6 months 
The cumulative glucocorticoid dose at 6 months 
The  number  of  severe  flares  (i.e.,  increase  in  BVAS/WG  to ≥  3  or  experiencing  one  major 
BVAS/WG item requiring treatment with CYC) at 6 months 
The number of limited flares (new occurrence or worsening of one or more minor BVAS/WG items) 
at 6 months 
Laboratory markers of inflammation (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and C-reactive protein 
[CRP]) at 6 months 
The  endpoints  for  the  assessment  of  long-term  efficacy,  assessed  out  to  18  months,  included  the 
duration of complete remission, and the time to limited and/or severe flare after complete remission in 
the two treatment groups. 
The  studies  mentioned  in  this  application  used  the  BVAS  or  BVAS/WG  and  the  Disease  Extent  Index 
(DEI).   
Sample size 
Based on the data from the WGET trial (Stone 2002), the sample size was calculated assuming that 
70% of the patients receiving CYC or rituximab would attain complete remission during the first 6 
months after randomization and that the non-inferiority limit for the difference in percentage complete 
remission between rituximab and CYC would be 20%. If the dropout rate was 10% and equally 
distributed between treatment groups, a sample size of 100 patients per arm would yield 83% power 
to conclude non-inferiority using a one-sided 0.025 level test. The sample size was to be re-evaluated 
if the assumptions (e.g., dropout rate) changed markedly during the study. 
Randomisation 
Two-hundred patients  were  to  be  randomized  in  a  blinded  way  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  the  experimental 
(rituximab)  or  control  arm  (conventional  therapy).    Differences  in  organ  involvement,  prognosis,  and 
relapse  rate  have  been  documented  between  proteinase  3  (PR3)-ANCA  and  myeloperoxidase 
(MPO)-ANCA  and,  thus,  the  randomization  was  stratified  by  clinical  study  center  and  type  of  ANCA 
(PR3 or MPO).  Because the clinical types of AAV in RAVE have many overlapping features, and no data 
show a different response to medical interventions, the randomization was not further stratified by the 
type  of  AAV  (WG  or  MPA).    However,  to  ensure  that  the  proportions  of  WG  and  MPA  patients  were 
similar to those in the AAV population, the maximum percentage of MPA patients was to be 50% of all 
AAV patients.

Blinding (masking)  
This was a double blind study. 
Follow-up 
All  patients  were  to  be  followed  until  18  months  after  the  enrolment  of  the  last patient.    After  the 
Month 18 Visit, patients were to be treated according to best medical judgment (BMJ).       
Statistical methods 
Primary analyses were performed in the ITT population which included all randomised and treated 
patients. Two-sample comparisons were performed with the use of Student’s t-test or a Wilcoxon rank-
sum test for continuous measures and a chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test for binary measures. 
Patients with missing data at Month 6 and patients who experienced early treatment failures -defined 
as failure to achieve disease response at Month 1, or inability to complete at least 3 infusions of 
rituximab or rituximab-placebo-, were considered as non-responders. As a secondary supportive 
analysis, PP (per=protocol) analyses and “as-treated” analysis was performed. The PP analysis 
population was a subset of the ITT analysis population that excluded patients without any BVAS/WG 
observation post randomization, patients with less than 75% of total 375 mg/m2 x 4 rituximab/placebo 
infusions and Patients with major protocol deviations. The “as-treated” population includes patients 
who fulfilled the protocol definition of early treatment failure but continued their initial treatment 
(under best medical judgment). 
As  a  sensitivity  analysis,  the  primary  endpoint  was  also  determined  using  Worst-Case  Imputation  for 
ITT patients who discontinued permanently from study treatment or withdrew from study before Month 
6, beyond meeting the criteria of the definition of early treatment failures as stated above.   
To assess the consistency of the study results, subgroup analyses were performed based on the 
following baseline variables: type of AAV (GPA or MPA), type of ANCA, newly diagnosed disease, 
relapsing disease, alveolar hemorrhage, and severe renal disease. There was no correction for 
multiplicity because they were pre-specified and had biologically plausible bases. 
Non-Inferiority margin was predefined at -20% with an expected response rate of 80%. A 0.049 level 
of significance was used for the analysis of non-inferiority, to account for an interim efficacy analysis 
performed for the DSMB when half of the patients completed the 6-month’ evaluation. As secondary 
analyses, superiority was tested for the primary and main secondary endpoint with X² test, after 
testing for non-inferiority. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Eighty-two  (83%)  patients  in  the  RTX  group  and  79  (81%)  patients  in  the  CYC  group  completed 
6 months of the study without switching treatment or change to BMJ. During the maintenance phase of 
the study, patients in RAVE were followed up to a common closeout (CCO) date, corresponding to the 
last patient’s 18-month visit. In total, 123 completed 18 months on their randomized treatment (61 of 
99 [62%] on rituximab and 62 of 98 [63%] on CYC).

Recruitment 
The study was initially estimated to recruit 200 patients over an accrual period of 30 months. The 
study was initiated on 21 December 2004 and completed on 9 January 2009 for the 6 month analyses 
cut-off.  
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol version 1.0 issued on 1 July 2004, was amended 7 times. Main amendments were 
implemented in version 2 to add a secondary objective to demonstrate superiority of rituximab to 
conventional therapy, 2 tertiary objectives and 11 tertiary endpoints, including changing the secondary 
endpoint of percentage of patients in complete remission at 12 and 18 months to a tertiary endpoint. 
Other points added in this version were: secondary endpoints on treatment arm difference, duration of 
remission (combined with time to limited or severe flare after remission), percentage of patients who 
met criteria for clinical tolerance, risks associated with AZA. Amendments 6 and 7 occurred after the 
lock for the 6-month analysis. All amendments occurred before the final database closure which 
included the follow-up data for all patients.

Baseline Disease Characteristics 
The  majority  of  patients  (74.6%)  in  RAVE  had  a  diagnosis  of  WG,  and  24.4%  had  a  diagnosis  of 
microscopic polyangiitis (MPA).  One percent of the patients had an unknown AAV type.

AAV = ANCA-associated vasculitis; ITT = intent to treat; MPA = microscopic polyangiitis; WG = Wegener's 
granulomatosis.  
Renal involvement was almost identical in both groups (RTX 65.7% and CYC 66.3%). However, renal 
function expressed by creatinine clearance was markedly different with a mean clearance of 76.5 (RTX 
group) vs.91.4 (CYC group).  
Approximately  two-thirds  of  the  patients  in  each  arm  were  positive  for  classical  ANCA  (c-ANCA)  by 
immunofluorescence,  and  the  remaining  one-third  was  positive  for  perinuclear-staining  ANCA  (p-
ANCA)).  Similarly, approximately two-thirds of the patients were positive for PR3-specific antibodies, 
and one-third was positive for MPO-specific antibodies. 
Numbers analysed  
Both the ITT and Safety populations included all 197 treated patients. The PP population included 188 
(95.4%) patients and excluded 4 and 5 patients from the rituximab and CYC arms, respectively.

•  Secondary endpoints 
Cumulative BVAS/WG AUC during the First 6 Months 
Using  worst  case  imputation,  the  mean  (SD)  BVAS/WG  AUC/month  over  the  first 6 months  was  1.29 
(1.331) points for the RTX group and 1.25 (1.030) points for the CYC group.  No significant difference 
was observed between the treatment arms. 
Remission on < 10 mg/day Prednisone at 6 Months 
Using  worst  case  imputation,  70  patients  (70.7%)  in  the  RTX  group  achieved  a  BVAS/WG  of  0  at 
6 months  while  on  < 10  mg  prednisone  per  day.    Fewer  patients  (61,  62.2%)  in  the  CYC  group 
achieved  this  outcome;  however,  the  resulting  treatment  difference  (8.5%)  was  not  statistically 
significant).

Partial Remission 
Using  worst  case  imputation,  70  patients  (70.7%)  in  the  RTX  group  and  61 patients  (62.2%)  in  the 
CYC group achieved a BVAS/WG ≤ 2 while off glucocorticoids at 6 months.   
Exploratory AnalysisRemission 
An exploratory analysis was conducted to determine the rate of remission (BVAS\WG = 0) regardless of 
prednisone  use.    Using  worst-case  imputation,  80  patients  (80.8%)  in  the  RTX  arm  achieved  a 
BVAS/WG of 0 compared with 65 (66.3%) patients in the CYC arm, resulting in a treatment difference 
of 14.5 (95% CI:  2.3, 26.6), p = 0.021.  
Severe and Limited Flares During the Remission Induction Phase 
In  the  first  6  months  after  randomization,  no  significant  difference  in  severe  or  limited  flares  was 
observed  between  the  two  treatment  arms.    In this  analysis,  flares  that  occurred  after  switching 
treatment  were  excluded.    Five  (5.1%)  patients  in  the  RTX  group  experienced  a  total  of  six  severe 
flares, and 10 (10.2%) patients in the CYC group experienced a total of 10 severe flares.  These events 
translated to a rate of 0.011 and 0.019 severe flares per patient-month in the RTX and CYC treatment 
groups, respectively (p = 0.293).  Limited flares occurred at an equal rate of 0.026 per patient-month 
for both arms.   
Cumulative Glucocorticoid Dose 
During  the  2  weeks  prior  to  randomization,  the  median  cumulative  dose  of  methylprednisolone  was 
0 mg  in  both  treatment  arms.    The  median  cumulative  dose  of  prednisone  was  240.0  mg  in  the  RTX 
group and 270.0 mg in the CYC group. 
From  randomization  through  6 months  after  randomization,  IV  administration  of  methylprednisolone 
was similar across treatment arms, with a median dose of 1000 mg for both arms.   
The  median  cumulative  dose  of  prednisone  from  randomization  to  6  months  was  lower  in  the  RTX 
group (3310.0 mg) compared with the CYC group (3450.0 mg; p = 0.055).

Change in ANCA Status Over 6 Months 
Achievement  of  ANCA  negativity  after  induction  therapy  has  been  associated  with  a  lower  rate  of 
subsequent disease relapse.  In addition to the hospital determination of baseline ANCA status, blood 
samples  were  collected  at  screening  and  at  various  time  points  after  remission  induction  and  were

analyzed  for  seroconversion.    A  total  of  166  patients  had  a  sample  collected  for  the  lab  assay  at 
Screening and a subsequent time point during the remission induction period (89% of patients in the 
RTX group and 80% of patients in the CYC group).  Of these, the proportion of patients who became 
negative  for  ANCA  was  higher  in  the  RTX  group  compared  with  the  CYC  group  (p = 0.050).    The 
greatest effect on becoming seronegative by 6 months was observed for patients who were PR3 + and 
were treated with rituximab (p = 0.012).  The ability to induce seronegative results in MPO + patients 
was similar between the treatment arms. 
Change from Baseline in Markers of Inflammation 
In  both  groups,  the  ESR  and  CRP  levels  decreased  between  baseline  and  Month 6,  with  a  larger 
improvement  in  the  RTX  group  with  respect  to  ESR  levels:  median  reduction  of  14  mm/hr  vs.  3.0 
mm/hr in the CYC group, and a difference in mean changes between the two arms of 7.6 mm/hr (95% 
CI:  2.2, 13.1), p = 0.0064. 
The  changes  in  CRP  levels  were  comparable  between  the  two  arms,  with  a  difference  in  means  of 
0.61 mg/dL (95% CI:  − 0.50, 1.73), p = 0.28. 
In  exploratory  analyses,  age  group  (< 65,  ≥ 65  years)  was  an  important  covariate,  improving  the 
estimation  of  the  treatment  effect.    Adding  the  age  group  as  an  additional  covariate  in  the  ANCOVA 
model,  the  difference  in  mean  reduction  from  baseline  was  9.0  mm/hr  (95%  CI:    3.6,  14.5), 
p = 0.0013, for ESR and 0.88 mg/dL (95% CI: − 0.25, 2.00), p = 0.13, for CRP. 
Additional  exploratory  analyses  were  performed  to  evaluate  changes  in  other  laboratory  values 
relevant to AAV disease activity.  The age group was included as a covariate in all these analyses. 
Larger  improvements  were  noted  in  the  RTX  group  compared  with  the  CYC group  with  respect  to 
changes in hemoglobin (p = 0.0025), or hematocrit (p = 0.0001).  Platelets were lower in both groups 
at Month 6, with smaller changes in the RTX group (p = 0.0411)  
Patients in the CYC arm had a complete remission rate at 6 months of 54.7 % and a rate of remission 
on  < 10 mg/day  prednisone  of  62.2%,  while  the  remission  rate  regardless  of  the  prednisone  dose 
(BVAS/WG = 0) was 66.3%.  These remission rates are consistent with the remission rate observed in 
the WGET study in patients with severe AAV treated with the same CYC regimen.

At  12  months,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  maintained  complete  remission  was  47.5%  in  the  RTX 
group and 38.8% in the CYC group. The treatment difference was 8.7% (numerically higher in the RTX

group),  with  95%  CI,  −5.1%  to  22.5%.  At  18  months,  the  proportions  of  patients  who  maintained 
complete remission were 39.4% in the RTX group vs. 32.7% in the CYC group.  
For  the  patients  who  met  remission  criteria  at  any  glucocorticoid  dose  at  6,  12,  or  18  months,  the 
mean  (median)  cumulative  prednisone  dose  in  the  RTX  group  was  lower  at  all  time-points  when 
compared with the CYC group.  
Exploratory  analyses  on  the  durability  of  complete  clinical  remission  have  been  performed  by 
demographic and disease characteristic subgroups (AAV type, ANCA type, renal involvement, history of 
alveolar  hemorrhage,  age,  gender,  presence  of  systemic  disease).  The  results  for  both  12-  and  18-
month time points were consistent with those observed for the 6-month primary time point. In the RTX 
group, the highest remission rates were maintained by the patients with MPA, female patients, patients 
with systemic disease, and younger patients. 
Time to flare analyses 
For the Kaplan-Meier analyses of time to flare for patients who achieved complete remission, patients 
were  censored  at  the  time  of  withdrawal,  switch  of  therapy,  open-label  rituximab,  or  BMJ,  or  at  18 
months.  
Figure 5. 
BWAS WG over time 
The  mean  BVAS/WG  for  each  treatment  group  was  similar  at  all  time-points  during  the  maintenance 
period.  The  mean  score  was  lower  in  the  RTX  group  at  Month  6  (p  <  0.01), mirroring the  results  for 
remission (regardless of GC use). 
Clinical Tolerance 
Since the pre-specified definition of clinical tolerance requires that patients be off immunosuppression, 
and  the  CYC  group  received  azathioprine  during  the  maintenance  phase  of  the  study,  tolerance  can 
only be assessed for the rituximab group.  
At 12 months, 41% of the rituximab patients achieved the Step 1 criterion of tolerance, with a similar 
breakdown for MPO + and PR3 + patients.  Of these, in the MPO + group, approximately half were also 
ANCA negative, thus meeting the Step 2 definition of tolerance. Thus 21% of all MPO + patients met 
the Step 2 definition of tolerance at Month 12. A lower proportion of PR3 + patients (12% at Month 12) 
were in complete remission and also ANCA negative.

Applying the CD19 return criterion resulted in a total of 5 rituximab patients at Month 12 who met the 
Step 3 definition of tolerance. Findings at 18 months were consistent with the 12-month time-point. 
B-cell Repletion and Maintenance of Efficacy in RAVE 
The proportion of patients with ANCA-antibodies who became sero-negative for ANCA after induction 
treatment was higher in the rituximab arm compared with the CYC arm (44.3% vs. 28.0%, p = 
0.050).   
In  the  pivotal  study  RAVE,  the  number  of  peripheral-blood  CD19+  B  cells  decreased  to  <  10  cells/μL 
after two infusions of rituximab and remained at that level in most patients through 6 months. In the 
RTX  group,  87  of  92  patients  (95%)  had  this  degree  of  CD19+  depletion  at  1  month.  Among  the  5 
patients  who  did  not  have  this  degree  of  CD19+  depletion,  4  patients  achieved  the  primary  endpoint 
and  1  patient  did  not.  At  6  months,  71  of  85  patients  (84%)  in  the  RTX  group  had  this  degree  of 
CD19+  depletion.  Among  the  14  patients  who  did  not  have  this  degree  of  CD19+  depletion,  11 
achieved  the  primary  endpoint  (79%).  By  Month  12,  the  majority  of  patients  showed  signs  of  B  cell 
return  with  66  of  82  (80.5%)  patients  with  counts  >  10  cells/μL.  By  Month  18,  61  of  70  patients 
(87.1%) had counts > 10 cells/μL.

Supportive study  
Study RITUXVAS  
RITUXVAS was a Phase II, open-label, two-group, randomized study of 44 patients from eight centres 
in Europe and Australia.  It was sponsored and conducted by the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS 
Foundation Trust (United Kingdom) and the European Vasculitis Study Group (EUVAS).  Genentech was 
not  involved  in  this  study,  and  the  summary  provided  in  this submission  is  based  on  the  published 
RITUXVAS data. 
Methods 
Inclusion  criteria  required  a  new  diagnosis  of  AAV;  ANCA  positivity;  and  renal  involvement,  identified 
by  either  necrotizing  glomerulonephritis  on  biopsy,  red  cell  casts  on  urine  microscopy,  or  haematuria 
(≥ ++) on urinalysis. 
Prior  to  entry,  patients  were  allowed  plasma  exchange  or  IV  methylprednisolone  (maximum  2 g) 
according  to  local  practice  for  severe  disease.    After  randomization,  both  groups  received  1 g  IV 
methylprednisolone  and  the  same  oral  glucocorticoid  regimen  (initially  1 mg/kg/day,  reduced  to 
5 mg/day  at  6 months).    Patients  were  randomized  3:1  to  receive  rituximab  375 mg/m2  weekly  for 
4 weeks, plus IV CYC 15 mg/kg with the first and third rituximab infusions, or IV CYC pulse (15 mg/kg 
every 2  to  3  weeks,  for  3  to  6  months)  followed  by  AZA  (2 mg/kg/day).    (In  this  SCE,  RITUXVAS 
patients  in  the  experimental  arm  will  be  referred  to  as  the  RTX + low-dose  CYC  group  or  the  RTX 
group.)    Further  rituximab  or  CYC  was  permitted  for  disease  relapse.    Relapses  occurring  before  a 
minimum of 6 months of sustained remission were categorized as failures with respect to the primary

efficacy  endpoint.    Assessments  were  performed  at  0,  1.5,  3,  6,  9,  and  12  months  and  at  relapse, 
which was defined as the appearance of any BVAS item attributable to active vasculitis.  
Primary Outcome 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  for  RITUXVAS  was  sustained  remission,  defined  as  a  BVAS  score  of  0 
that was maintained for at least 6 months. 
Secondary Outcomes 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  time  to  remission,  BVAS,  change  in  GFR,  prednisolone  dose,  and 
quality of life and disease damage (assessed through the Short Form 36 [SF-36] questionnaire and VDI 
between 0 and 12 months). 
Results 
Patients characteristics 
Patients  in  RITUXVAS  were  all  new-onset  disease  patients;  median  age of  68  yrs,  disease  severity  of  
BVAS 19, all had renal insufficiency with a low GFR and a substantial proportion required dialysis. 
Efficacy Results 
Primary outcome 
Sustained remission occurred in 25 of 33 patients (76%) in the RTX + low-dose CYC group and in 9 out 
of 11 patients (82%) in the CYC group.  The absolute difference in sustained remission with rituximab 
compared with CYC was − 6% (95% CI: − 33, 21). 
Among patients who reached 12 months, 93% of patients in the RTX + low-dose CYC group and 90% 
of  patients  in  the  CYC  group  achieved  sustained  remission.    Reasons  for  not  achieving  sustained 
remission  at  12  months  included  death  (18%  in  the  RTX + low-dose  CYC  group  and  9%  in  the  CYC 
group),  re-treatment  for  incomplete  remission  (1  patient  in  the  RTX + low-dose  CYC  group; 
subsequently  led  to  full  remission),  and  relapse  within  6  months  after  achieving  remission  (1  patient 
from each treatment group).  Nine patients were dialysis dependent at entry, 8 in the RTX + low-dose 
CYC group and 1 in the CYC group.  Of these, 6 out of 8 patients from the RTX + low-dose CYC group 
had  a  sustained  remission,  with  5 patients  becoming  dialysis  independent.    The  one  patient  from  the 
CYC group who was dialysis dependent at the start of the study, died shortly after study entry. 
Despite  more  severe  AAV  in  the  RITUXVAS  population  the  proportion  of  patients  who  obtained 
remission at month 12 was higher than in the RAVE study; 76% to 82% (RITUXVAS) and 66% to 63% 
(RAVE). At month 12, 7 patients had died in the RITUXVAS compared to 3 patients in RAVE which can 
be explained by older age and more severe disease in RITUXVAS. 
Secondary Outcomes 
Time to Remission 
Remission  (defined  in  this  study  as  a  BVAS  2003  score  of  0  for  2 months)  occurred  in  30  out  of  33 
patients  (91%)  in  the  RTX + low-dose  CYC  group  and  10 of  the  11  patients  (91%)  in  the  CYC  group.  
The median time to remission was 90 days (IQR, 79−112 days) in the RTX + low-dose CYC group and 
94 days (IQR, 91−100 days) in the CYC group. 
BVAS 2003 
In  RITUXVAS,  median  BVAS  fell  from  19  (IQR,  14−24)  at  entry  to  0  (IQR,  0−1.5)  at  3  months  in  the 
RTX + low-dose CYC group and 18 (IQR, 12−25) at entry to 0 (IQR, 0−0) at 3 months in the CYC group.

Change in Glomerular Filtration Rate 
The median estimated GFR (eGFR; mL/min/1.73 m2) levels in the RTX + low-dose CYC group increased 
from 20 (IQR, 5−44) at entry to 39 (IQR, 20−45) at 12 months.  In the CYC group, the median eGFR 
increased from 12 (IQR, 9−33) at entry to 27 (IQR, 12−47) at 12 months.  
Prednisolone Dose 
Prednisolone  doses  were  reduced  in  both  groups  in  accordance  with  the  protocol,  with  96%  from the 
RTX + low-dose  CYC  group  and  89%  from  the  CYC group  receiving  5 mg/day  by  9  months.    At  12 
months, median weight-adjusted prednisolone doses (mg/kg/day) were 0.071 (IQR, 0.062−0.082) for 
the RTX + low-dose CYC group and 0.082 (IQR, 0.071−0.093) for the control group. 
Quality of Life and Disease Damage 
The  median  change  in  the  VDI  in  the  RTX + low-dose  CYC  group  was  2  (IQR,  0−3)  and  was  not 
significantly different from the CYC group's change of 1 (IQR, 0−2) (p = 0.38).  Similarly, the treatment 
groups did not differ with respect to the change in the physical composite score of the SF-36 (p = 0.36). 
The CYC group had an improved mental composite SF-36 score in comparison with the RTX + low-dose 
CYC group (p = 0.04); this difference was largely accounted for by 2 patients’ scores in the RTX + low-
dose CYC group.  Exclusion of these 2 patients’ data led to a p = 0.32. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  development  of  rituximab  in  severely  active  Granulomatosis  with  polyangiitis  and  Microscopic 
polyangiitis, in combination with glucocorticoids is based on the anticipation of a long-term reduction of 
auto-antibody forming B-cells and on the hypothesis that depletion of B-cells could induce tolerance to 
self-antigens. 
The MAHhas submitted 2 studies investigating the efficacy of rituximab in AAV; the pivotal RAVE trial 
and  the  supportive  study  RITUXVAS.  Both  were  randomized  and  active-controlled  –  the  RAVE  study 
was also double-blinded. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are acceptable. 
The  choice  of  BVAS-WG  as  the  instrument  of  the  primary  outcome  is  supported.  This  instrument  is 
considered  well  validated  to  measure  disease  activity,  without  interference  of  pre-existing  organ 
damage,  and  recommended  to  be  used  in  trials  on  AAV  by  the  EULAR.  The  definition  of  the  primary 
outcome,  BVAS-WG  of  0,  without  any  use  of  corticosteroids,  is  considered  conservative,  and 
supported. 
No  dose  finding  was  performed.  The  dose  rationale  in  the  RAVE  study  was  based  on  historical  data, 
which  show  that  the  rituximab  dose  of  4  doses  of  375  mg/m2  each  given  1  week  apart, was  able  to 
induce  remission  in  patients  with  AAV,  this  is  the  same  dose  and  posology  as  used  in  the  approved 
indications.  
In the pre-specified statistical analysis plan a non-inferiority margin of -20% was chosen and the lower 
boundary of the 95% CI for RTX remission should exceed 50% based on data from a historical control 
case  series.    Although  the  margin  seems  inadequate  from  a  clinical  point  of  view,  the  response  rate 
was numerically higher in the experimental group versus standard therapy, and the lower limit of the 
CI was actually smaller than 5 %, no further concerns are raised on this issue. The fact that the lower 
limit of the 95% CI of the complete remission rate at 6 months in the RTX group was required to be 
> 50% is acceptable as a remission rate of approximately 70% after CYC treatment can be expected. A 
worst-case  analysis  has  been  included  where  missing  data  were  recorded  as  treatment  failures.  This 
strengthens the robustness of the analyses.

Oral CYC became the standard regimen for severely active AAV and is considered acceptable as a 
comparator in this trial.  
Patient disposition is adequately described and is compatible with characteristics of patients enrolled in 
recent  studies  of  severe  AAV.  The  WG  and  MPA  patients  were  evenly  distributed  between  treatment 
groups. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two arms except for gender (more females in the 
RTX group and more males in the CYC group) and age (the RTX population was older). It seems that 
the  RTX  patients  had  a  worse  baseline  renal  function  compared  to  the  CYC  patients.  The  observed 
imbalances do not affect the overall conclusion. 
Compared to RAVE the patients in RITUXVAS were all new-onset disease patients; they were markedly 
older  (68  yrs  vs.  52  yrs),  and  had  much  more  severe  disease  (BVAS  19  vs.  8),  all  had  renal 
insufficiency with a low GFR and a substantial proportion required dialysis.  
A high rate of study adherence up to month 6 was observed in both treatment arms. 
The  RAVE  study  reached  its  primary  goal  by  showing  convincingly  that  RTX  was  non-inferior  to  oral 
CYC + AZA as at month 6 there were 64% of patients in the RTX arm in remission vs. 55% in the CYC 
arm. There were, however, major differences according to study centre. Patients treated at the Mayo 
Clinic  had  a  remission  rate  of  over  92%  in  the  RTX  arm  compared  to  all  other  centres  where  the 
remission  rate  combined  was  53.4%.  Subgroup  analyses  showed  that  relapsing  disease  responded 
markedly better with RTX  compared to CYC probably because these patients had undergone previous 
treatment  cycles  with  CYC  and  therefore  could  be  regarded  as  at  least  partial  CYC  failures.  The 
response rate in newly diagnosed disease was slightly in favour of CYC (65% CYC vs. 60% RTX). The 
study failed to show superiority of RTX compared to CYC (secondary endpoint). In contrast to the CYC 
arm,  there  was  no  maintenance  treatment  with  immune-suppressive  drugs  in  the  RTX  arm.  It  was 
hypothesized a-priori, that the reduction of B-cells by rituximab could induce tolerance to MPO or PR-3. 
However, this was not confirmed by the data.  
Patients in relapse at randomisation responded better to RTX induction therapy than re-treatment with 
CYC,  as  may  be  expected  (difference  24.7%,  95%  CI  5.8-43.6).  In  the  newly-diagnosed  patients, 
response  to  RTX  was  numerically  less  than  for  CYC  (difference  -4.2%,  95%  CI  -23.6-15.27).  This  is 
considered as relevant information for the prescribers at choosing between the two treatment options, 
and therefore subgroup-analyses are included in the SPC section 5.1.  
The proportion of patients in the RTX group who achieved complete remission was numerically higher 
than in the CYC group; however, the 9.5% difference was not statistically significant (95.1% CI for the 
difference:    -4.3%,  23.4%;  p = 0.177,  χ2  test;  ).    The outcome  was  similar  using  the  worst  case 
imputation  (95.1%  CI  for  the  difference:    -3.2%,  24.3%;  p = 0.132).    While  the  rituximab  remission 
rate at 6 months was not statistically significantly superior to CYC at 6 months, the lower limit of the 
95% CI of the complete remission rate at 6 months in the RTX group exceeded 50%, which was based 
on the upper bound of the 95% CI of the survival rate of the Walton cohort at 6 months.  The mortality 
rate by 6 months is 1% (1/99) in rituximab-treated patients versus historical of 63% (35/56) mortality 
rate at 6 months in the patients described by Walton (), which is still significant even when considering 
advances in supportive medical care over the previous five decades. 
Patients in the CYC arm had a complete remission rate at 6 months of 54.7 % and a rate of remission 
on  < 10 mg/day  prednisone  of  62.2%,  while  the  remission  rate  regardless  of  the  prednisone  dose 
(BVAS/WG = 0) was 66.3%.  These remission rates are consistent with the remission rate observed in 
the  WGET  study  in  patients  with  severe  AAV  treated  with  the  same  CYC  regimen.  Based  on  this,  the 
ability of CYC treatment to induce remission at 6 months remains greater than 20 percentage points, 
the protocol-specified non-inferiority margin M2, with a likely treatment effect of approximately 50%.

Considering the mean BVAS scores in the first months of treatment, it seems that onset of the clinical 
effect is similar between both treatments. A sudden increase in BVAS scores was noted at 6 months in 
the CYC arm. This is concurrent with end of CYC induction therapy, and conversion to maintenance 
therapy with AZA, a milder acting immune-suppressive drug.  
Rates  of  remission  defined  as  BVAS/WG  of  0  on  a  prednisone  dose  of  <  10  mg/day  and  rates  of 
remission  irrespective  of  prednisone  dose  were  similar  across  treatment  groups  at  6,  12,  and  18 
months.  The  results  were  generally  consistent  in  the  observed-case  analysis  and  the  worst-case 
analysis.  
The  time  to  flare  analyses  indicated  that,  the  proportions  of  patients  who  remained  in  complete 
remission were comparable up to 12 months after randomization.  After 12 months, the proportion of 
patients  remaining  in  complete  remission  was  numerically  lower  in  the  RTX  group  than  in  the  CYC 
group. More severe flares occurred between 12 and 18 months in the RTX than CYC group (8 vs. 4). 
Between 6 and 18 months, more limited flares also occurred in the RTX than  CYC group (24 vs. 16). 
The slightly higher number of limited flares after 6 months in the RTX group may partly be due to the 
lack of AZA maintenance and less GC use in this treatment group, as well as B-cell repletion. 
There was a tendency of lower rate of serious flares under rituximab than under CYC in the induction 
phase.  Flare  rates,  however,  increased  again  at  longer-term  follow-up  in  the  rituximab  arm,  when 
CD19+  B  cells  re-emerged.  This  raises  the  question  whether  follow-up  maintenance  therapy  with 
rituximab,  or  other  immune-suppressive  drugs,  is  indicated.  This  issue  cannot  be  solved  by  the 
available data, and future studies are required to establish the optimal maintenance therapy to prevent 
relapses, after rituximab induction treatment. A general recommendation was included in section 5.1. 
of  the  SmPC  stating  that  maintenance  therapy  with  immune-suppressant  drugs  may  be  considered 
after induction therapy with RTX, to prevent relapses, especially for patients considered at high risk.  
In  the  pivotal  study  RAVE,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  became  sero-negative  for  ANCA  after 
induction treatment was higher in the rituximab arm compared with the CYC arm (44.3% vs. 28.0%, p 
= 0.050).  
The use of the level of CD19+ B cells as a biomarker is justified as it is recognized that CD19 has been 
suggested as a therapeutic target in autoimmune diseases.  The number of peripheral-blood CD19+ B 
cells  decreased  to  <  10  cells/μL  after  two  infusions  of  rituximab  and  remained  at  that  level  in  most 
patients  through  6  months.  In  the  RTX  group,  87  of  92  patients  (95%)  had  this  degree  of  CD19+ 
depletion at 1 month and 71 of 85 patients (84%) still had it at 6 months. However, the patients who 
didn’t achieve depletion  of B cells, still achieved the primary endpoint. By  Month 12, the majority of 
patients  showed  signs  of  B  cell  return  with  66  of  82  (80.5%)  patients  with  counts  >  10  cells/μL.  By 
Month  18,  61  of  70  patients  (87.1%)  had  counts  >  10  cells/μL.  In  the  CYC  group,  peripheral-blood 
CD19+ B-cell counts also decreased, but the rate and magnitude of the decrease were less than in the 
RTX group, and B-cell recovery appeared to occur more slowly. Of note, the majority of the CYC group 
received AZA maintenance therapy between 6 and 18 months, which may have contributed to slower 
B-cell recovery, whereas the RTX group did not.  
The RAVE data evaluating efficacy up to 18 months suggest that the benefit generated with a cycle of 
rituximab  persists  past  6  months  despite  the  lack  of  AZA  maintenance  therapy  in  the  RTX  arm. 
Pharmacodynamic data suggest a significant return of CD19-positive B cells between 6 and 12 months. 
Peripheral  B-cell  repletion  seems  to  not  impact  complete  remission  rates  over  time  but  may  have  an 
impact on the occurrence of severe or limited flares between 12 and 18 months, which were 17 severe 
flares and 24 limited flares in the RTX arm compared with 13 severe flares and 16 limited flares in the 
CYC  arm.  It  follows  that  B-cell  depletion  and  ANCA-negative  status  might  be  associated  with  lower 
relapse rate and that PR3-ANCA positive patients, patients with GPA and relapsing disease at baseline 
might be associated with a higher risk of relapse, however these associations are only suggestive and

are not reliable as biomarkers of disease activity. Circulating CD19+ B-cells declined more rapidly and 
intensively  after  RTX  as  compared  to  after  CYC  treatment  and  recuperated  12  month  after  RTX 
treatment. As patients in the CYC arm received AZA maintenance therapy after CYC induction, the B-
cell count remained reduced.  
Not all patients may be candidates for maintenance therapy with immune-suppressive drugs, as about 
40% of the subject did not relapse after long-term follow-up. Of interest are the experiences from the 
Mayo  Clinic  (US),  of  10  years  monitoring  of  108  AAV  patients  treated  with  rituximab  induction  and 
maintenance. In this population, all observed relapse-cases (53) occurred after reconstitution of B cells 
and were accompanied or preceded by an increase in ANCA levels, in all but one patient (Cartin-Ceba 
et al., Arthritis Rheum 2010;62 Suppl 10 :680). A treatment modality based on monitoring ANCA and 
B-cells  is  planned  to  be  developed  further  after  approval,  when  more  data  become  available  from 
ongoing studies.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The non-inferiority of rituximab to standard treatment in terms of inducing remission in patients with 
severe MPA / GPA was convincingly demonstrated. Since the trial was not designed to allow 
conclusions of follow-up treatment with rituximab the wording of the indication has been adequately 
amended to reflect that rituximab is indicated for induction-therapy only. 
Although the dose recommendation of 4 x 375mg/ m2 is considered sufficiently justified, the lack of 
dose-finding studies conducted with rituximab in AAV needs to be addressed and it is recommended to 
the MAH to explore a flat, less frequent and in total lower dose of 2 x 1000 mg  as dosing regimen. As 
a lower dose may have an impact on improving the safety profile, this is included in the RMP (see 
discussion on Clinical Safety). 
Patients  in  relapse  at  randomisation,  appeared  to  respond  better  to  rituximab  induction  therapy  than 
re-treatment with CYC, as may be expected, however, a definite conclusion cannot be made due to the 
exploratory  nature  of  the  analysis.  These  data  may  be  considered  as  relevant  information  for  the 
prescribers and therefore subgroup-analyses are included in the SPC section 5.1.  
The data showed that after 12 months the RTX patients experienced an increasing number of flares 
indicating that supplementary immunosuppressant drugs or retreatment with RTX are needed beyond 
month 12.  Thus it recommended to add information in section 5.1 that maintenance treatment with 
immune-suppressants should be considered for relapse prevention, especially for patients at risk (i.e. 
with a history of earlier relapses and GPA, or in patients with a reconstitution of B-lymphocytes and 
PR3- ANCA at monitoring). Future studies are required to establish the optimal maintenance therapy to 
prevent relapses, after rituximab induction treatment. In this respect, study MAINRITSAN I is planned 
for completion in December 2013, and as agreed in the context of the RMP, data will be submitted to 
the CHMP for review. Furthermore, study RITAZAREM comparing rituximab to azathioprine as 
maintenance therapy in relapsing AAV is planned to be completed in 2016. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Rituximab has been in use since the late 90s initially for haematological indications and has 
subsequently received MA for rheumatoid arthritis. It is estimated that around 2 million patients have 
Mabthera 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

been treated with this compound, thus a considerable amount of information regarding its safety 
profile has been made available. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of main importance are primarily 
infusion reactions within 24 hours after the infusion (either allergic or caused by the cytokine release 
syndrome), cardiac disorders, haematological abnormalities such as leukopenia, increase in the rate of 
infections among which reactivation of hepatitis B can be fatal and Progressive Multifocal 
Leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is often associated with immunosuppression due to cytotoxic 
treatment as in the NHL population, although a few cases have been reported in RA patients without 
concomitant immunosuppressive treatment.  
In  the  pivotal  study  RAVE  the  primary  safety  analysis  was  based  on  the  safety  population,  which 
included all patients who were randomized and who received at least one dose of the following study 
drugs:  rituximab/rituximab placebo or CYC/CYC placebo.   
Safety data were also obtained from RITUXVAS and published studies with rituximab in AAV.   
Patient exposure 
Primary Safety Analysis:  RAVE 
Disposition and Duration of Follow-Up Up to 6 months from randomization: 
A  total  of  197  randomized  and  treated  patients,  all of  whom  received  at  least  one  dose  of  any  study 
drug, were included in the safety analysis:  n = 99 in the RTX group and n = 98 in the CYC group.  At 
the  6-month  analysis,  a  similar  proportion  of  patients  in  each  treatment  group  had  remained  on 
randomized treatment without switching or a change to a different treatment under BMJ (86 patients in 
the  RTX  group  comprising  the  RTX  only  group  and  85  patients  in  the  CYC  group  comprising  the  CYC 
only group).  The majority of patients in both groups completed the first 6 month study period (93 of 
99  [94%]  and  91  of  98  [93%]  in  the  RTX  and  CYC  groups,  respectively).  Safety  information  was 
summarized from randomization until the Month 6 visit or the point of study discontinuation, whichever 
occurred earlier, to yield a total duration of follow-up of 47.6 patient-years in the RTX group and 47.0 
patient years in the CYC group. The follow-up time in the RTX only and CYC only groups was 41.9 and 
40.5  patient  years,  respectively.    Since  only  a  small  proportion  of  patients  switched  to  the  opposite 
treatment  or  received  different  treatment  according  to  BMJ  or  as  a  result  of  a  deviation  from  study 
drug administration during the first 6-month study period, the duration of follow-up for these patients 
was  very  limited  (5.7  patient-years  in  the  RTX  other  group  and  6.5  patient-years  in  the  CYC  other 
group).   
Up  to  18  months  from  randomization,  mean  follow-up  times  were  1.4  years  (16.8  months)  in  both 
treatment groups. From randomization to the CCO date, mean follow-up times were 3.0 and 2.8 years 
in the RTX and CYC groups, respectively. 
In  total,  123  patients  completed  18  months  on  their  randomized  treatment  (61  of  99  [62%]  on 
rituximab  and  62  of  98  [63%]  on  CYC)  Twenty-nine  patients  remained  on  original  treatment  at  the 
date of the CCO.  
For the 18-month analysis, a total of 139.6 and 134.7 patient-years of follow-up were accrued in the 
RTX  and  CYC  groups,  respectively.  For  the  analysis  through  the  CCO  date,  patient-years  of  follow-up 
were 299.2 in the RTX group and 274.7 in the CYC group. For sensitivity analyses in which data were 
summarized  until  the  point  of  treatment  switch,  patient-years  of  follow-up  were  168.4  for  the  RTX 
group and 136.1 for the CYC group. 
Extent of Exposure to Rituximab 
All  patients  received  at  least  one  infusion  of  rituximab  or  rituximab  placebo.   The  median  cumulative 
dose of rituximab in the RTX group was 1500 mg/m2 (range of 742 to 1687 mg/m2) at month 6.  The 
Mabthera 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/462277/2013 
Page 30/66 
 
 
 
total amount (volume) of infusions received was similar in both treatment arms, with the vast majority 
of patients (97% in both group) receiving  ≥ 75% of the planned total amount. 
Since  the  6-month  time  point,  15  patients  in  the  RTX  group  have  received  an  additional  course  of 
open-label RTX between Months 6 and 18 and 11 patients have received at least one course of open-
label rituximab in the CYC group. After 18 months, 1 additional patient in RTX group and 2 additional 
patients in CYC group received their first open-label rituximab treatment. In addition, 7 patients in the 
CYC arm received RTX due to switch to BMJ prior to 6 months. 
Additional Data:  RITUXVAS 
Forty-four patients were randomized (33 to rituximab - low-dose CYC and 11 to CYC followed by AZA).  
Of these, 27 in the RTX -  low-dose CYC group and  10 in the CYC group completed the full 12 month 
follow up.  The total patient-years of follow-up were not reported. 
All  patients  received  methylprednisolone  1 g  IV  followed  by  oral  steroids.    Patients  randomized  to 
rituximab also received two doses of IV CYC; 2 patients in the RTX + low-dose CYC group received a 
third CYC dose (one treatment failure and one protocol violation).    
Additional information regarding total dosages of study drug was not reported. 
Additional Data:  Other Published Investigator Initiated Studies 
In  total,  a  further  162  patients  with  AAV  were  exposed  to  rituximab  in  12  published  investigator-
initiated  studies. 
  Patients  generally 
received  GC 
therapy  and  a  number  of  different 
immunosuppressive therapies concomitantly with rituximab, most commonly CYC.  Duration of follow-
up varied between 3 and 55 months across patients in these studies. 
Adverse events 
Primary Safety Analysis: RAVE 
Overall Adverse Event Profile 
Up to 6 months: 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  adverse  events  leading  to  a  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug 
was slightly higher in the CYC group (13.3%) compared with the RTX group (8.1%). 
The proportion of patients who reported any selected adverse event was numerically lower in the RTX 
group (22.2%) than in the CYC group (34.7%).  However, the rates of selected adverse events were 
similar  between  the  two  treatment  groups  (0.78  events/patient  year  in  the  RTX  group  vs.  0.96 
events/patient-year in the CYC group; p-value = 0.250).  10 [10.1%] in the RTX group vs 4 [4.1%] in 
the  CYC  group  required  hospitalization,  which  was  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to 
disease  activity  or  study  therapy.    Of  the  10  patients  who  were  hospitalized  in  the  RTX  group,  5 
received  rituximab  only  (RTX  only  group),  while  the  remaining  5  received  other  therapies  after 
receiving  rituximab  (RTX  other  group).    All 4  patients  in  the  CYC  group  received  CYC  only,  without  a 
different treatment by switching treatment or BMJ (CYC only group).  However, these hospitalizations 
were due to serious adverse events, which were balanced across the two groups.   
The  incidence  of  events  of  special  interest  for  rituximab,  such  as  serious  infections,  serious  cardiac 
adverse  events,  and  malignancies,  was  similar  across  the  two  treatment  groups  over  the  6-month 
treatment period.  A similar proportion of patients experienced infusion reactions in each group.

Sub f: The primary reason for hospitalization for patients in the RTX arm included leukopenia (n=3), pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, renal failure, 
pulmonary embolism, osteomyelitis,  bronchitis, and hypersensitivity. Reasons for hospitalization for patients in the CYC arm included pneumonia (n=2), 
acute respiratory distress syndrome, and upper respiratory tract infection 
Up to 18 months: 
The  overall  18-month  adverse  event  profile  in  the  RAVE  safety  population  was  generally  consistent 
with the profile at 6 months and comparable between the treatment groups. Incidences and rates per 
patient-year of any adverse event, selected adverse events, Grade ≥ 3 adverse events, serious adverse 
events,  and  serious  infections  were  similar  across  treatment  groups.  While  a  higher  proportion  of 
patients  in  the  RTX  group  experienced  infections,  the  rates  of  infection  per  patient-year  were  similar 
between  the  groups  at  18  months.  The  proportions  of  patients  who  experienced  Grade ≥ 3  adverse 
events  were  similar  across  the  treatment  groups.  However,  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  reported 
Grade  4  events  in  the  RTX  group;  with  the  difference  largely  due  to  disease-related  respiratory  and 
renal system events.

Results of the sensitivity analysis excluding events that occurred after switch of therapy were generally 
consistent with those from the primary 18-month analysis.  
The  overall  numbers  and  rates  of  adverse  events  were  similar  across  the  RTX  and  CYC  groups.  Of 
these common events, those with an absolute increase of ≥5% in incidence in the RTX group over the 
CYC  group  were  diarrhoea  (24.2%  vs.  17.3%),  peripheral  oedema  (20.2%  vs.  12.2%),  urinary  tract 
infection (UTI) (16.2% vs. 6.1%), and cough (28.3% vs. 18.4%). These differences are consistent with 
those reported at the 6-month time point except for the imbalance in UTI, the incidence of which had 
been similar in both treatment groups at 6 months (5% vs. 3% in the RTX vs. CYC group, respectively). 
The  higher  proportion  of  patients  with  hypertension  in  the  RTX  group  compared  with  the  CYC  group 
that  was  observed  at  6  months  remained  at  18  months  but  was  less  marked.  Of  note,  these  events 
were self-limiting and did not lead to permanent discontinuation of study medication. 
Common adverse events with an increased incidence ( ≥ 5%) in the CYC group compared with the RTX 
group  were  leucopenia  (and  decreased  WBC),  nausea,  increased  ALT  and  AST,  rash,  alopecia,  RBC 
sedimentation  rate  increased,  haematuria,  haematocrit  decreased,  vomiting,  pyrexia,  and  fatigue. 
Compared with the 6-month data, more adverse event terms were reported at an increased incidence 
(≥ 5%) in the CYC group compared to the RTX group by 18 months. 
Table 16. Selected AEs of interest (total study duration 18 months).  
Up to Common Closeout Date: 
The overall adverse event profile up to the CCO date was, in general, consistent with that observed at 
18 months with one exception: a higher proportion of patients reported serious adverse events in the 
RTX  group  than  in  the  CYC  group  (60%  vs.  48%).  However,  the  rate  of  serious  adverse  events  was 
comparable  between  the  treatment  groups  (0.41  vs.  0.36  per  patient-year).  The  difference  in  the 
proportion of patients who experienced Grade 4 events between the two treatment arms (all but one of 
which was also reported as serious) was greater through the CCO date than what was observed at 18 
months. In addition, several malignancies were diagnosed between 18 months and the CCO date. 
Adverse Events by Severity

Up to 6 months 
The  majority  of  patients  in  both  groups  experienced  adverse  events  of,  at  worst,  mild-to-moderate 
intensity:    Grade  1 - RTX  group  20.2%,  CYC  group  22.4%;  Grade  2 - RTX  group  45.5%,  CYC  group 
40.8%.    Overall,  similar  proportions  of  patients  experienced  Grade   ≥ 3  events  in  the  RTX  and  CYC 
groups. 
There  were  three  Grade  5  (fatal)  events:    1)  multi-organ  failure  in  a  rituximab  treated  patient  who 
received rituximab followed by CYC treatment according to BMJ 16 days after the first dose of RTX; 2) 
pneumonia in a CYC only–treated patient; and 3) septic shock also in a CYC only–treated patient.  
Ten  Grade  4  events  occurred  in  8  patients  in  the  RTX  group:    pulmonary  embolism  (2  patients), 
leucopenia (2 patients), neutropenia (1 patient), accidental overdose of CYC  placebo (1 patient), and 
pneumonia  (1 patient)  in  the  RTX  only  group  and  renal  failure  (1  patient),  hyperkalemia  (1  patient), 
and acute renal failure (1 patient) in the RTX other group 
Four  Grade  4  events  occurred  in  3  patients  in  the  CYC  group:    febrile  neutropenia,  pneumocystis 
pneumonia,  pulmonary  embolism,  and  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome.    All  these  events  were 
reported in the CYC only group. 
The most common type of Grade  ≥ 3 events was infection, which occurred in 10 patients in each group.  
The most frequent Grade  ≥ 3 infection included respiratory infections in both groups, most commonly 
pneumonia.   
Up to 18 months: 
The  majority  of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  experienced  adverse  events  of,  at  worst,  mild-to-
moderate  intensity  (Grade  1  or  2).  Overall,  the  proportions  of  patients  who  experienced  at  least  one 
Grade  ≥ 3 event up to 18 months were similar between the two treatment groups (44.4% in the RTX 
group  and  45.9%  in  the  CYC  group)  Grade   ≥ 3  events  at  18  months  had  a  similar  profile  to  that 
observed at 6 months, including, most commonly, infections in both groups (13.1% in the RTX group 
and 13.3% in the CYC group). 
In the RTX group, 39 patients experienced 81 Grade 3 adverse events, including 55 events up to the 
6-month time point and 26 additional events between 6 and 18 months. In the CYC group, 79 Grade 3 
events were reported in 43 patients by 18 months, with 56 events up to the 6-month time point and 
23  events  after  6  months.  In  both  groups,  the  most  common  Grade  3  events  were  infections  and 
disease-related respiratory disorders. 
Overall,  by  18  months,  10  patients  in  the  RTX  group  experienced  13  Grade  4  adverse  events  and  4 
patients  in  the  CYC  group  reported  4  Grade  4  adverse  events.  This  imbalance  was  attributable  to 
disease-related  respiratory  and  renal  system  events  (4  vs.  2  events  in  the  RTX  and  CYC  arms, 
respectively) and haematological abnormalities (3 vs. 1 event, respectively), as well as to a number of 
individual events without a clear pattern. 
The majority of Grade 4 events occurred prior to 6 months, with two events occurring between 6 and 
18  months  in  the  RTX  group:  an  autoimmune  thrombocytopenia  (Patient  001007  patient  narratives) 
and  a  suicide  attempt  (Patient  002025  patient  narratives)  in  the  RTX  arm.  The  case  of  autoimmune 
thrombocytopenia occurred 8 months after the patient switched and received CYC. No additional Grade 
4 adverse events were reported between 6 and 18 months in the CYC group. 
In addition to the 2 deaths in the CYC group, both due to infections, and 1 death in the RTX group due 
to  multi-organ  failure  attributed  to  underlying  disease,  reported  up  to  6  months,  1  additional  death 
occurred in the RTX group after 6 months that resulted from PAH.

The majority of the Grade  ≥ 3 adverse events (107 of 181, 59.1%) were also classified as serious. All 
but one Grade 4 adverse event (a case of neutropeniain the RTX group) were classified as serious. 
Up to Common Closeout Date: 
The analysis of adverse events collected through the CCO date shows a pattern consistent with that of 
the  18-month  analysis.  Overall,  a  slightly  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the  RTX  group  reported 
Grade  ≥ 3 events compared with the CYC group (58.6% vs. 53.1%) as a result of a greater proportion 
of  patients  experiencing  Grade  4  events  in  the  RTX  group.  From  randomization  to  the  CCO  date,  17 
patients  in  the  RTX  group  experienced  21  Grade  4  adverse  events  and  5  patients  in  the  CYC  group 
experienced  6  Grade  4  adverse  events.  Again,  this  imbalance  was  mainly  attributable  to  disease-
related  respiratory  and  renal  system  events  (9  vs.  4  events  in  the  RTX  and  CYC  arms,  respectively) 
and hematological abnormalities (6 vs. 1 event, respectively). 
Between 18 months and the CCO date, 1 CYC patient (001027 patient narratives) reported two Grade 
4  events  of  renal  failure,  both  occurring  after  the  patient  received  therapy  under  BMJ.  In  the  RTX 
group, 7 patients reported eight additional Grade 4 adverse events including anemia, cerebrovascular 
accident  (CVA),  WG,  PAH,  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome,  PE,  chronic  renal  failure,  and  aortic 
dissection.  Four  of  these  eight  events  (renal  failure,  CVA,  WG,  and  aortic  dissection)  occurred  after 
patients switched to therapy under BMJ. Given that most of the patients switched therapy to BMJ after 
18 months, data collected after 18 months should be interpreted with caution.

A higher proportion of patients in the CYC group (58.1%) than in the RTX group (36.4%) had at least 
one adverse event probably or definitely related to study drug, per the investigator’s evaluation. 
The most frequent adverse events considered probably or definitely related to study drug, on the basis 
of  the  investigator’s  evaluation,  in  the  CYC  group  were  leukopenia  (22.4%),  decreased  WBC  count 
(11.2%),  alopecia  (8.1%),  hyperglycemia  (6.1%),  and  anemia  (4.1%).    The  most  frequent  adverse 
events probably or definitely related to study drug, on the basis of the investigator’s evaluation, in the 
RTX  group  included  leukopenia  (7.1%),  cytokine-release  syndrome  (4.0%),  and  thrombocytopenia 
(4.0%). 
Up to 18 months 
Consistent with the 6-month analyses, by 18 months, a higher proportion of patients in the CYC group 
(70.4%) than in the RTX group (42.4%) had at least one adverse event probably or definitely related 
to study drug, per the investigator’s evaluation. 
The most frequent adverse events considered probably or definitely related to study drug, on the basis 
of  the  investigator’s  evaluation,  in  the  CYC  group  were  leukopenia  (31.6%),  decreased  WBC  count 
(15.3%),  alopecia  (8.2%),  hyperglycaemia  (6.1%),  thrombocytopenia  (5.1%),  anemia  (4.1%),  and 
ALT increased (4.1%). The most frequent adverse events probably or definitely related to study drug, 
on  the  basis of  the  investigator’s  evaluation,  in  the RTX  group  included  leukopenia  (8.1%),  cytokine-
release syndrome (4.0%), thrombocytopenia (4.0%), WBC decreased (4.0%), and flushing (4.0%).  
Up to Common Closeout Date: 
The results of the analysis on data collected through the CCO date were consistent with the 18-month 
data.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Primary Safety Analysis:  RAVE  
Up to 6 months: 
In  RAVE,  3  deaths  occurred  during  the  first  6-month  period:    2  in  the  CYC  group  and  1  in  the  RTX 
group.    The  2  deaths  in  the  CYC  group  occurred  in  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  AAV.   One  patient 
who received CYC therapy followed by AZA, died on Study Day 123 of pneumonia that was considered 
possibly related to study treatment.  This patient had a medical history notable for chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease.  One patient, who received CYC, died on Study Day 55 of septic shock, which was 
considered possibly related to study treatment.  This event was preceded by a serious adverse event of 
Pneumocystis  pneumonia  despite  prophylaxis  (on  Study  Day  21)  for  which  CYC  treatment  had  been 
suspended.    This  patient  also  had  a  history  of  coronary  artery  disease  and  experienced  a  serious 
myocardial infarction during the study. 
The 1 death in the RTX group was a patient randomized to rituximab who subsequently received CYC.  
This  patient  had  a  history  of  AAV  for  18  months  and  relapsing  WG  with  renal  involvement  at  study 
entry.  He received rituximab (three infusions) but was switched to BMJ after the onset of renal failure 
on  Study  Day  16,  receiving  open-label  CYC  until  Study  Day  36.    The  patient  subsequently  developed 
pancytopenia and sepsis and died of multi-organ failure approximately 1 month later.  The event was 
attributed to the progression of AAV and considered unrelated to study treatment.  
Up to 18 months: 
Two patients in each arm died during the 18 months of study. One death was attributed to pulmonary 
alveolar haemorrhage 9 months into the maintenance phase in the RTX arm. This patient was treated 
with RTX induction, but for the subsequent 5 + 9 months was without any immunosuppressive therapy.  
Up to Common Closeout Date: 
There were no additional deaths reported between 18 months and the CCO date. 
Additional Data:  RITUXVAS 
Eight deaths occurred in RITUXVAS, 6 (18%) in the RTX + low-dose CYC group prior to 12 months and 
3 (27%) in the CYC group of which 2 occurred after 12 months.  Only summary data on these deaths 
have  been  reported in  the  literature  and  data  on  one  of  the  deaths  in  the  CYC  group  is  unpublished.  
The majority of the deaths occurred within 3 months of randomization, and the median time to death 
was 91 days (range of 22-330 days in the RTX + low-dose CYC group and range of 2-610 days in the 
CYC  group).    Compared  with  the  overall  study  population,  the  patients  who  died  were  older  (median 
age,  76  years;  range,  63-84  years)  and  had  low  glomerular  filtration  rates  (GFR;  median  GFR  at 
baseline  of  9 mLs/min/1.73  m2),  two  known  risk  factors  for  death  in  this  population.  The  causes  of 
death  were  infections  (RTX  low-dose  CYC  group,  n  =  3;  CYC  group,  n = 1),  cardiovascular  disease 
(RTX  low-dose  CYC  group,  n = 1;  CYC  group,  n = 2),  and  complications  of  end  stage  renal  failure 
(RTX + low-dose CYC group, n = 2).

Other Serious Adverse Events 
Primary Safety Analysis:  RAVE 
In the safety population, 33 (33.3%) rituximab patients had a total of 46 serious adverse events and 
33  (33.7%)  CYC  patients  had  a  total  of  54  serious  adverse  events  during  the  first  6  months  of 
treatment.  The rate of serious adverse events per patient-year was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.72-1.29) in the 
RTX group and 1.15 (95% CI, 0.88-1.50) in the CYC group. 
The  rate  of  serious  adverse  events  per  patient-year  was  numerically  lower  in  the  RTX  only  group 
(0.69) compared with the CYC only group (0.94).  Patients who switched treatment or who received a 
different  treatment  according  to  BMJ  or  as  a  result  of  errors  in  study  drug  administration  had  a 
numerically  higher  rate  of  serious  adverse  events  per  patient-year  (RTX  other:    2.98;  CYC  other:  
2.47),  although  the  data  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  because  of  the  very  limited  sample  size 
and  duration  of  follow  up  in  these  groups.    Patients  in  these  groups  had  higher  rates  of  disease 
exacerbation reported as serious adverse events, including renal failure, creatinine increase, and WG.   
The  most  frequent  serious  adverse  events  in  the  overall  safety  population  were  DVT  (10  patients, 
5.1%), pneumonia (8 patients, 4.1%), anemia (5 patients, 2.5%), renal failure (including acute renal 
failure, 5 patients, 2.5%), and pulmonary embolism (4 patients, 2.0%).  The only notable imbalance in 
these  events  between  the  RTX  and  CYC  arms  was  in  the  incidence  of  serious  DVT  (2  patients  in  the 
RTX group vs. 8 patients in the CYC group). The reason for this imbalance is unknown.  
There  were  three  episodes  of  serious  leukopenia  reported  in  the  RTX  group.    As  noted  previously, 
Grade  ≥ 2 leukopenia, which includes nonserious events, occurred in a greater proportion of patients 
in the CYC group than the RTX group (17.3% vs. 5.1%). 
Serious  adverse  events  affecting  the  gastrointestinal  system  were  observed  in  4  patients  in  the  RTX 
group  compared  with  no  patients  in  the  CYC  group.  The  serious  gastrointestinal  adverse  events 
included  diarrhea  (2  patients,  2.0%)  and  ischemic  colitis  and  upper  gastrointestinal  hemorrhage  (1 
patient  each).    The  incidence  of  serious  adverse  events  in  each  system  organ  class  (SOC)  was 
otherwise similar between treatment groups or lower in the RTX group than in the CYC group. 
The  SOC  with  the  highest  incidence  of  serious  adverse  events  was  infections  and  infestations  (21 
patients,  10.7%  overall),  with  a  similar  proportion  of  patients  reporting  serious  infections  in  the  RTX 
(11, 11.1%) and CYC (10, 10.2%) arms. 
The  serious  adverse  event  profiles  between  the  RTX  only  and  CYC  only  groups  were  similar  to  that 
observed between the RTX and CYC groups. 
Up to 18 months: 
The overall serious adverse event profile was similar in the RTX  and  CYC groups in RAVE through 18 
months.  In  the  safety  population,  46(46.5%)  rituximab  patients  had  a  total  of  69  serious  adverse 
events  and  41  (41.8%)  CYC  patients  had  a  total  of  77  serious  adverse  events.  The  rates  of  serious 
adverse  events  per  patient-year  were  comparable  between  the  RTX  (0.49  [95%  CI,  0.39-0.63])  and 
CYC  (0.57  [95%  CI,  0.46-0.71])  groups.  These  rates  were  lower  than  those  reported  for  the  first  6 
months of the study (0.97 [95% CI, 0.72-1.29] in the RTX group and 1.15 [95% CI, 0.88-1.50] in the 
CYC group). The decrease in rates may be due, at least in part, to lower disease activity and GC use 
later in the study. 
The  overall  profile  of  events  was  consistent  with  that  observed  at  6  months  with  the  most  frequent 
type  of  serious  adverse  event,  by  SOC,  being  infection  in  both  groups  (15.2%  for  RTX  group  and 
15.3% for CYC group). The most common serious infections were pneumonia (4.0% for the RTX group 
and 5.1% for the CYC group) and UTI (2.0% and 1.0% in the RTX and CYC groups, respectively).  
Mabthera 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/462277/2013 
Page 39/66 
 
 
 
Other common types of serious adverse events included respiratory disorders (9.1% vs. 11.2% in the 
RTX  vs.  CYC  groups,  mainly  WG,  PE,  PAH,  and  laryngeal  stenosis)  and  blood  and  lymphatic  system 
disorders (overall 6.1% in each arm), which encompassed mainly anemia (2.0% in the RTX group vs. 
4.1% in the CYC group) and leukopenia (3.0% in the RTX group vs. no patients in the CYC group, all 
occurring prior to 6 months). 
Also  consistent  with  the  data  at  6  months  was  the  higher  incidence  of  serious  DVT  in  the  CYC  group 
(8.2%  vs.  1.0%  in  the  RTX  group)—events  that  all  required  anticoagulant  therapy  that  was 
administered  in  hospital—and  a  higher  number  of  events  affecting  the  gastrointestinal  system  in  the 
RTX  group  (five  vs.  two  in  the  CYC  group).  Gastrointestinal  events  occurring  in  the  RTX  group 
(ischemic  colitis,  diarrhea,  gastritis,  and  upper  gastrointestinal  hemorrhage)  had  no  clear  pattern  or 
unifying  etiology.  The  two  gastrointestinal  events  in  the  CYC  group  were  both  cases  of  acute 
pancreatitis.  
No  other  clear  imbalances  were  observed  in  events  grouped  by  SOC.  By  18  months,  there  were  two 
serious  cardiac  events  in  the  RTX  group,  both  of  which  were  atrial  fibrillation.  There  were  also  two 
serious  cardiac  events  in  the  CYC  group:  myocardial  infarction  and  supraventricular  tachycardia. 
Sensitivity  analyses,  which  excluded  events  occurring  after  treatment  switch,  were  overall  consistent 
with the primary analysis at 18 months. 
Up to Common Closeout Date: 
Overall, 60 (60.6%) rituximab patients had a total of 122 serious adverse events and 47 (48.0%) CYC 
patients  had  a  total  of  100  serious  adverse  events  through  the  CCO  date.  Importantly,  the  rates  of 
serious adverse events per patient-year were comparable between the RTX (0.41 [95% CI, 0.34–0.49]) 
and CYC (0.36 [95% CI, 0.30–0.44]) groups. These rates were lower than those reported at 6 months 
(0.97 [95% CI, 0.72-1.29] in the RTX group vs. 1.15 [95% CI, 0.88-1.50] in the CYC group and at 18 
months (0.49 [95% CI, 0.39-0.63] in the RTX group vs. 0.57 [95% CI, 0.46-0.71] in the CYC group), 
perhaps in part due to lower disease activity and GC use later in the study. 
The overall profile of events was consistent with that observed at 6 and at 18 months, with the most 
common serious adverse event being infection in both treatment arms. As noted at the 18-month time 
point, the most common serious infections were pneumonia (8.1% in the RTX group and 10.2% in the 
CYC group) and UTI (2.0% in the RTX group and 1.0% in the CYC group) 
Additional Data:  RITUXVAS 
At 12 months, 16 of 33 (48%) patients experienced 35 serious adverse events in the RTX — low-dose 
CYC  arm  of  RITUXVAS  (including  6  patients  with  fatal  events).    Six  of  these  patients  had  serious 
infections. Four of 11 (36%) patients experienced 11 serious adverse events in the CYC arm, including 
3  serious  infections  in  2  patients.    Identical  proportions  of  patients  experienced  outcomes  of 
hospitalizations or life threatening events, serious infections, or deaths in each treatment group.  The 
rate of serious adverse events per patient-year was not reported.   
Preliminary  unpublished  data  up  to  2  years  revealed  that  20  of  33  (61%)  patients  experienced  50 
serious  adverse  events  in  the  RTX + low-dose  CYC  arm  of  RITUXVAS  (including  6  patients  with  fatal 
events).    Twelve  of  these  patients  had  serious  infections  and  3  developed  malignancies  (melanoma, 
breast cancer and basal cell carcinoma [unpublished case].  Four of 11 (36%) patients experienced 15 
serious  adverse  events  in the  CYC  arm,  including  5  serious  infections  in  2  patients.  Three  patients  in 
the CYC arm had fatal events, one of which was an infection.   
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Study Drug 
Mabthera 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/462277/2013 
Page 40/66 
 
 
 
 
Primary Safety Analysis:  RAVE 
Up to 6 months: 
In total, 21 patients reported 27 events that led to discontinuation of study drug (rituximab/rituximab 
placebo, CYC/CYC placebo, or AZA/AZA placebo).  All these adverse events occurred prior to a patient 
switching treatment or receiving other treatment under BMJ.  
A higher proportion of patients experienced adverse events leading to a permanent discontinuation of 
study  drug  in  the  CYC  group  than  in  the  RTX  group.    In  the  RTX  group,  8  (8.1%)  patients  had  12 
events that led to study drug discontinuation.  In the CYC group, 13 patients (13.3%) experienced 15 
adverse events that led to study drug discontinuation. 
The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  events  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug  were  (acute) 
renal failure, leukopenia, and (drug) hypersensitivity.  There was no clear imbalance between the RTX 
and  CYC  groups  in  the  type  of  adverse  events  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation  except  for 
leukopenia, which was only reported in 3 patients in the CYC group. 
Among  the  adverse  events  that  led  to  study  drug  discontinuation,  none  were  considered  infusion 
related by the investigator.  However, one serious adverse event of hypersensitivity (Patient 006001) 
was recorded on the Selected Adverse Event CRF as an IRR despite it not occurring within 24 hours of 
an  infusion  as  specified  in  the  reporting  instructions.    This  event  occurred  2  days  following  the  third 
infusion of rituximab.  CYC placebo was interrupted and restarted at a reduced dose (50 mg), and the 
fourth infusion of rituximab was not administered for this reason. 
Up to 18 months: 
Between 6 and 18 months, 8 patients in the RTX group and 12 patients in the CYC group discontinued 
study  drug  as  a  result  of  adverse  events,  thereby  yielding  a  total  of  16  (16.2%)  rituximab  and  24 
(24.5%)  CYC  patients  who  reported  adverse  events  that  led  to  a  permanent  discontinuation  of  study 
drug  (rituximab/rituximab  placebo,  CYC/CYC  placebo,  or  AZA/AZA  placebo)  from  baseline  to  18 
months.  The  main  reason  for  the  difference  in  the  number  of  patients  discontinuing  study  drug 
treatment  was  the  greater  number  of  patients  who  discontinued  because  of  leukopenia  in  the  CYC 
group. The most common reasons for permanent drug discontinuation, by 18 months, were leukopenia 
(7 patients [5 leukopenia and 2 WBC decreased] in the CYC group and no patients in the RTX group), 
infections  (2  patients  in  each  treatment  group),  WG  (2  patients  in  the  CYC  group  and  4  in  the  RTX 
group),  renal  failure  (2  patients  in  each  group),  and  (drug)  hypersensitivity  (2  patients  in  the  CYC 
group and 1 in the RTX group). 
Up to Common Closeout Date: 
After 18 months, two adverse events that led to permanent study drug discontinuation were reported: 
1 event of bronchostenosis in the CYC group and 1 case of WG in the RTX group. Overall, the profile of 
adverse events leading to permanent study drug discontinuation was consistent with that reported at 6 
months,  with  the  addition  of  more  withdrawals  due  to  infection  and  to  WG-related  respiratory 
symptoms 
Additional Data:  RITUXVAS  
No patient in the RTX + low-dose CYC group was reported to have stopped rituximab treatment early 
(course of four infusions).

By 6 months, 2 patients in the RTX group and no patients in the CYC group withdrew prematurely from 
the  study  as  a  result  of  adverse  events.  Since  the  6  month  time  point,  and  prior  to  18  months,  1 
additional  patient  in  the  RTX  group  and  1  patient  in  the  CYC  group  withdrew  as  a  result  of  adverse 
events.  The  serious  adverse  events  reported  in  the  2  patients  who  withdrew  prior  to  6  months  were 
pneumonia  and osteomyelitis. The 2 patients who withdrew after 6 months reported serious adverse 
events of renal failure and colon cancer. 
Up to Common Closeout Date: 
No  further  withdrawals  occurred  after  18  months.  Hence,  overall,  3  patients  in  the  RTX  group  and  1 
patient in the CYC group withdrew from the study because of adverse events. 
Additional Data:  RITUXVAS 
No patients were reported to have withdrawn from this study. 
Selected Adverse Events Pre-Defined in RAVE 
Selected  adverse  events  included  pre  specified  categories  of  events  including  death,  bone  marrow 
suppression, 
infection,  hemorrhagic  cystitis,  malignancy,  venous 
thromboembolic  events, 
hospitalizations  associated  with  AAV  or  study  drug  per  the  investigators  opinion,  CVAs  and  IRRs 
leading to discontinuation of further infusions.  These events are key safety outcomes associated with 
underlying disease or treatment that can result in substantial morbidity in this patient population, and 
a  significant  reduction  in  their  rates  was  deemed  clinically  important  in  the  protocol.    Therefore,  the 
pre specified analysis of the safety of rituximab versus that of CYC focused on these events. 
 Key findings were as follows: 
Up to 6 months: 
• 
• 
• 
The  proportion  of  patients  experiencing  the  pre-specified  selected  adverse  events  in  RAVE  was 
22.2%  in  the  RTX  group  and  34.7%  in  the  CYC  group.    However,  as  patients  may  have 
experienced  multiple  types  of  selected  events,  the  rate  of  these  events  per  patient-year  was 
similar in each group (0.78 vs. 0.96, respectively; p = 0.250).   
There were more cases of leukopenia and venous thromboembolic events in the CYC group than in 
the  RTX  group  in  RAVE,  although  the  higher  incidence  of  leukopenia  in  the  CYC  group  did  not 
translate into a higher number of infections during the first 6 months.   
In  RAVE,  10  patients  experienced  hospitalizations  considered  related  to  disease  activity  or  study 
therapy in the RTX group (5 RTX only patients and 5 RTX other patients) and 4 patients in the CYC 
group (4 CYC only patients).   
Up to 18 months and Common Closeout Date: 
•  By  18  months,  the  proportion  of  patients  experiencing  any  of  the  pre-specified  selected  adverse 
events in RAVE was 33.3% in the RTX group and 42.9% in the CYC group. The rate of these events 
per patient-year was 0.47 per patient-year in the RTX group vs. 0.48 per patient-year in the CYC 
group. 
• 
• 
Leukopenia remained more frequent in the CYC group compared with the RTX group at 18 months.  
The  subset  of  hospitalizations  associated  with  AAV  or  study  drug  per  the  investigator’s  opinion 
remained  more  frequent  in  the  RTX  group  at  18  months.  The  majority  of  hospitalizations 
associated  with  AAV  or  study  drug  per  the  investigator’s  opinion  were  due  to  infections  in  both 
groups.  Importantly,  hospitalizations  are  a  subset  of  serious  adverse  events,  and  the  percent 
incidences  and  rates  of  serious  adverse  events  and  serious  infections  were  balanced  across 
treatment groups.

•  At  the  18-month  time  point,  the  incidences  and  rates  of  severe  (Grade   ≥ 3)  infections  remained 
balanced across treatment arms. 
• 
These findings at the 18-month time point were consistent with the analysis up to the CCO date. 
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy 
No cases have been observed in the AAV studies included in this filing. 
Malignancies 
The total number of cancers reported from randomization up to the CCO Date was six malignancies in 
5 patients randomized to rituximab and two malignancies in 2 patients randomized to CYC. Table 19 
summarizes the malignancy events in RAVE up to CC date..

Laboratory findings 
HEMATOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY 
Primary Safety Analysis:  RAVE 
In  the  18-month  study  period  of  RAVE,  the  median  values  and  median  changes  from  baseline  of 
standard  hematologic  and  biochemistry  parameters  were  similar  across  treatment  groups  for  most 
laboratory parameters. These changes were consistent with those observed over the first 6 months of 
RAVE. 
The  most  common  newly  occurring  Grade  3  or  4  abnormalities  during  the  18-months  of  follow-up  in 
RAVE were lymphopenia and hyperuricemia, consistent with the analysis at 6 months. In patients with 
lymphocytes  in  the  normal  range  at  baseline,  there  was  a  higher  incidence  of  Grade  3  or  4 
Mabthera 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/462277/2013 
Page 43/66 
 
  
 
 
 
lymphopenia  in  the  CYC  group  (88.5%)  compared  with  the  RTX  group  (48.1%),  consistent  with  the 
known effects of these treatments. Hyperuricemia occurred more frequently in the RTX group than in 
the  CYC  group  (30.3%  vs.  15.9%),  also  consistent  with  previous  experience  with  rituximab  in  other 
indications (MabThera SmPC). The hyperuricemia was transient and without obvious consequence and 
was likely related to DNA catabolism resulting from B-cell lysis. The cumulative incidence of Grade  ≥ 3 
neutropenia  over  18  months  was  marginally  increased  in  the  CYC  group  (20.7%)  compared  with  the 
RTX  group  (17.9%),  with  more  Grade  4  neutropenia  in  the  CYC  group  (18.4%  vs.  10.7%).  This 
difference  is  consistent  with  the  more  frequent  reporting  of  leucopenia  adverse  events  in  the  CYC 
group. 
LABORATORY EVALUATIONS OF SPECIAL INTEREST 
Human Anti-Chimeric Antibody 
Primary Safety Analysis:  RAVE  
Thirty-one  patients  tested  positive  for  HACA  (defined  as  >5  RU/mL  and  immunodepletable  with 
rituximab)  at  any  time:  25  from  the  RTX  group  and  6  from  the  CYC  group  (3  out  of  these  tested 
positive  after  exposure  to  rituximab  as  a  result  from  switching,  receiving  open-label  rituximab,  or 
receiving  rituximab  under  BMJ).  Hence,  in  total,  28  (of  a  total  of  124  ever  exposed  to  rituximab) 
patients tested HACA positive after exposure to rituximab. The maximum HACA titer values for each of 
these  28  patients  ranged  from  9.78  to  12,100  RU/ml,  with  a  median  of  38.5  RU/mL  (the  3  CYC 
patients  who  were  HACA  positive  without  or  prior  to  exposure  to  rituximab  had  values  ranging  from 
24.9 to 374.0 RU/mL). Of note, 22 of the 25 HACA-positive patients in the RTX group tested positive 
after 6 months (time points at which serum levels of rituximab would be expected to be low and less 
likely to interfere with the detection of HACA). 
Of the 25 patients in the RTX group, 7 received a second course of rituximab as open-label treatment 
and  4  were  tested  HACA  positive  prior  to  receiving  repeated  rituximab.  None  of  these  4  patients 
experienced an IRR with their second course of treatment. 
HACA-positive  patients  are  defined  as  those  who  tested  HACA  positive  after  their  first  exposure  to 
rituximab, which includes 25 patients in the RTX group and 3 patients randomized to CYC who received 
rituximab as switch or open-label rituximab or under BMJ. For patients randomized to CYC, only events 
that  occurred  after  their  first  infusion  of  active  rituximab  were  included  in  the  analysis.  The  overall 
safety profile was similar in HACA-positive and HACA-negative patients. There was no clear difference 
in  the  proportions  of  patients  who  experienced  any  adverse  events,  serious  adverse  events,  and 
selected adverse events or in the respective rates of these events.  
The  proportion  of  patients  who  reported  IRRs  was  similar  in  the  HACA-positive  group  (4  of  28  or 
14.3%)  compared  with  the  HACA-negative  patients  (11  of  96  or  11.5%)  but  should  be  interpreted 
cautiously  because  of  the  small  numbers  of  events  and  HACA-positive  patients.  IRRs  are  defined  as 
those adverse events that occurred within 24 hours of an infusion and are considered infusion related 
by the investigators. Ten IRRs were reported in 4 patients who tested HACA positive, including 1 CYC 
patient  (001024)  who  received  rituximab  as  switching  treatment.  All  these  IRR  events  were  mild  to 
moderate in severity, all occurred prior to the detection of HACA, and none of them were reported as 
serious  adverse  events  or  resulted  in  discontinuation  of  therapy.  The  events  reported  as  IRRs  in  the 
HACA-positive  patients  comprised  cytokine  release  syndrome  (four  events),  flushing  (one  event), 
hypotension  (one  event),  oropharyngeal  discomfort  (one  event),  diarrhea  (one  event),  and 
hyperhidrosis (two events).

Pharmacodynamics (CD19 B Cell Counts) 
The number of peripheral-blood CD19-positive B cells decreased to <10 cells/µL after two infusions of 
rituximab  and  remained  at  that  level  in  most  patients  through  6  months.  At  6  months,  70  of  84 
patients  (83%)  in  the  RTX  group  had  this  degree  of  CD19-positive  depletion.  By  Month  12,  the 
majority  of  patients  showed  signs  of  B  cell  return  with  66  of  82  (80.5%)  patients  with 
counts >10 cells/µL. By Month 18, 61 of 70 patients (87.1%) had counts <10 cells/µL (excluding data 
collected after switch to RTX or open-label RTX).  
Immunoglobulins 
A  substantial  proportion  of  patients  receiving  either  RTX  or  CYC/AZA  had  low  Ig  concentrations  at 
baseline,  perhaps  resulting  from  immunosuppression  prior  to  trial  entry.    The  proportions  of  patients 
with  low  Ig  increased  at  6  months  and  18  months  in  both  groups.  On  the  basis  of  these  data,  and 
consistent  with  hypogammaglobulinaemia  (low  IgG  or  IgM)  observed  following  RTX  treatment  in  the 
RA clinical trial population, hypogammaglobulinemia is considered an Adverse Drug Reaction following 
RTX treatment in GPA and MPA patients. Low Ig was not associated with increased rates of infections.  
Neutropenia 
Primary Safety Analysis:  RAVE  
In RAVE, similar proportions of patients developed newly occurring CTC Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia, based 
on laboratory data, in the RTX group and CYC groups at each time point (10.8% vs 13.7% at 6 months, 
16.8% vs 20.7% at 18 months and 24.1% vs 23.0% at CCO). About 30% of patients who developed 
Grade   ≥ 3  neutropenia  by  the  CCO  date  (7/20  in  the  RTX  group  and  4/20  in  the  CYC  group),  did  so 
after switching therapy (cross-over, open-label RTX, or BMJ). Due to frequency of treatment switches, 
attribution of neutropenia to specific therapies is unclear. 
Importantly, most episodes of Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia were resolved by the next visit and there was no 
clear  association  between  occurrence  of  Grade ≥ 3  neutropenia  and increased risk  of  serious  infection 
in either treatment group. One of the twenty patients in the RTX group and one of the twenty in the 
CYC group with grade ≥ 3 neutropenia up to the CCO date developed a serious infection within 30 days 
of  the  reported  neutropenia:  one  serious  grade  2  infection  of  viral  URTI  was  reported  in  RTX  patient 
within 30 days of a grade 4 neutropenia and 1 serious, grade 2 viral infection was reported within 30 
days of a grade 4 neutropenia in a patient in the CYC group. 
On the basis of these data, and consistent with neutropenia observed following an initial course of RTX 
in  the  RA  clinical  trial  population,  neutropenia  is  considered  an  Adverse  Drug  Reaction  following  a 
single course of RTX in GPA and MPA patients. 
Safety in special populations 
Subgroup analyses of the safety profile in RAVE were primarily based on the data collected up to 6 and 
up to 18 months regardless of switch of therapy and presented in the following sections. The subgroup 
safety profiles were, in general, consistent between the 18-month and CCO analyses. 
Age  
Among the 197 patients randomized and treated in RAVE, 55 (28%) were aged  ≥ 65 years of which 12 
(6%)  were  aged   ≥ 75  years.    There  were  more  patients  aged   ≥ 65  years  old  in  the  RTX  group 
compared with the CYC group (36/99 vs. 19/98).  Of the 12 patients aged  ≥ 75 years, 8 were in the 
RTX group.  Within each age group, the safety profile of the RTX group compared with that of the CYC 
group  was  broadly  similar  to  that  observed  in  the  overall  safety  population.  Patterns  observed  in  the 
data  through  18  months  were  consistent  with  those  seen  at  6  months,  with  the  following  key 
observations: 
Mabthera 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/462277/2013 
Page 45/66 
 
 
 
•  Higher  incidence  and  rates  of  severe  (Grade ≥ 3)  and  serious  adverse  events  in  older  patients 
(difference primarily attributable to anemia and leukopenia, gastrointestinal disorders, and general 
disorders and administrational site reactions [chest pain and chills]) 
•  Deaths only occurred in older patients, with a similar incidence in the two treatment groups. 
• 
The  subset  of  hospitalizations  related  to  AAV  or  study  drug  per  investigator’s  opinion  occurred 
more  frequently  in  older  patients  in  the  RTX  group,  with  no  hospitalizations  occurring  in  older 
patients  in  the  CYC  group.  The  difference  in  the  proportion  of  patients  hospitalized  between  the 
two treatment groups was less in the group of younger patients. Hospitalizations reported in older 
patients  (all  in  RTX  group)  stemmed  from  acute  renal  failure,  pulmonary  hemorrhage,  steroid-
induced diabetes, and three cases of pneumonia (two of which were associated with leukopenia). 
• 
In  the  group  of  younger  patients  (<65  years),  Grade   ≥ 2  leukopenia  was  mostly  reported  in  the 
CYC  group,  whereas  in  older  patients,  the  proportions  of  patients  reporting  these  events  were 
similar across treatment groups. 
•  Cardiac events occurred more frequently in older patients in the RTX group, mainly attributable to 
Grade 1 or 2 atrial fibrillation and tachycardic events. In the CYC group, the proportion of patients 
reporting  cardiac  events  was  similar  in  older  and  younger  patients.  Serious  cardiac  events  were 
infrequent in both age groups for both treatment groups. 
• 
There was no clear or consistent trend in the rates of infections and serious infections in younger 
versus older patients in either treatment group. 
Safety Profile by Onset of Disease in RAVE:  New versus Relapsing Disease 
Of the 197 patients randomized and treated in RAVE, 96 (48.7%) were newly diagnosed at the time of 
screening  with  a  similar  proportion  in  each  treatment  group.  The  vast  majority  of  patients  who  had 
relapsing  disease  (79  of  101)  had  been  treated  with  CYC  prior  to  trial  entry,  while  only  6  patients  in 
the  newly  diagnosed  group  had  received  prior  CYC.  The  overall  safety  profiles  of  the  treatment  arms 
for  the  subgroups  of  new  and  relapsing  diseases  were  similar  to  those  observed  in  the  overall  safety 
population. 
Patterns observed in the  data through 18 months  were consistent with those seen at 6 months, with 
the following key observations: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The  safety  profiles  of  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  disease  versus  those  with  relapsing  disease 
were, in general, comparable. 
The overall incidences of infections and serious infections were similar in newly diagnosed patients 
and those with relapsing disease. 
The  incidences  of  Grade ≥ 2  leukopenia  and  thrombocytopenia  were  higher  in  newly  diagnosed 
patients compared with those with relapsing disease. 
In the patients with newly diagnosed disease, hospitalizations were only reported in the RTX group. 
In the relapsing group, the proportions of patients reporting hospitalization were similar in the two 
treatment groups. 
Safety Profile by Baseline Renal Function in RAVE 
In RAVE, the mean baseline creatinine clearance rate was 84.0 mL/min and the median 74.71 mL/min 
in the 197 randomized and treated patients. Baseline renal function was better in patients in the CYC 
group  compared  with  those  in  RTX  group.  The  proportion  of  patients  with  a  baseline  creatinine 
clearance rate below the median (74.71 mL/min) was higher in the RTX group (54.5%) compared with 
the CYC group (44.9%). 
Mabthera 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/462277/2013 
Page 46/66 
 
 
 
As with the previous subgroup analyses, these data should be interpreted with caution because of the 
limited sample size in each subgroup.  Also of note,  baseline renal function can be related to age and 
other  baseline  demographic  or  disease  characteristics,  potentially  confounding  the  subgroup  analysis. 
Key findings from the 18-month analysis were as follows: 
•  A  higher  proportion  of  CYC  group  patients  with  a  lower  baseline  creatinine  clearance  (<74.71 
mL/min)  experienced  severe  or  serious  adverse  events,  infections,  and  serious  infections  than 
those with a higher baseline creatinine clearance rate in the CYC group. 
•  All deaths occurred in patients with worse baseline renal function. 
• 
The numerical imbalance between treatment groups in patients hospitalized as a result of disease 
activity or study drug per the investigator’s opinion was larger in patients with worse baseline renal 
function.  Patients  with  worse  baseline  renal  function  in  the  RTX  group  who  reported 
hospitalizations were also older patients ( ≥ 65 years). 
•  More  serious  adverse  events  of  anemia,  pneumonia,  and  renal  failure  occurred  in  the  subgroup 
with worse renal function. In contrast, however, serious PE (four cases) occurred only in the group 
of  patients  with  a  higher  creatinine  clearance  rate  at  baseline  in  either  treatment  group.  The 
incidences of DVTs, however, were balanced across the subgroups. 
• 
• 
There  were  no  clear  differences  in  the  incidences  and  rates  of  infections  and  serious  infections 
between patients with higher or lower baseline creatinine clearance rates. 
The proportion of patients experiencing UTIs was slightly higher in patients with the lower baseline 
creatinine clearance rate than in those with better renal function at baseline. In both these groups, 
more patients in the RTX group experienced UTI than patients in the CYC group. 
EXTRINSIC FACTORS 
Patients  with  a  history  of  CYC  use  in  RAVE  largely  corresponded  to  the  subgroup  of  patients  with 
relapsing disease.  Seventy nine out of the 101 patients with relapsing disease  (78.2%) had a history 
of CYC use.  Only 6 of 96 (6.3%) patients with new onset disease had previously used CYC.  Therefore, 
a separate subgroup analysis was not performed on history of CYC use. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No  formal  drug  interaction  studies  have  been  performed  with  rituximab  in  the  target  population.  
However,  a  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  of  RA  patients  suggests  that  co  administration  with 
CYC,  methotrexate,  or  GC  has  no  effect  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  rituximab.    Furthermore,  as  the 
elimination  of  rituximab  is  mediated  by  both  the  specific  CD20  receptor-mediated  pathway  and  the 
nonspecific  immunoglobulin  G  clearance  pathway,  rituximab  is  not  expected  to  interact  with  other 
drugs  through  protein  binding,  effects  on  cytochrome  P450  activity,  renal  excretion,  and/or 
competition for common drug transporter proteins.   
Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy  
One pregnancy of a patient’s partner was reported by a patient who was randomized to the RTX arm of 
RAVE.  This patient did not switch to CYC during the first 6 months on study.  The pregnancy ended in 
miscarriage, with no additional details reported.

Rituximab  is  approved  for  Wegener’s  granulomatosis  and  microscopic  polyangiitis  in  the  USA  since 
April  2011.    Spontaneous  serious  adverse  events  of  rituximab  in  AAV  reported  to  the  Global  Safety 
Database  have  been  summarized  in  this  safety  summary  where  relevant.    The  reported  events  were 
consistent  with  underlying  disease  and  previous  experience,  for  rituximab.    Many  of  these  patients 
were reported to be taking concurrent immunosuppressive therapies.    
A  search  in  the  Global  Safety  Database  for  spontaneous  serious  adverse  events  received  through  31 
August 2011 in Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positive vasculitis, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and 
microscopic  polyangiitis  resulted  in  99  case  reports:    94  in  WG,  4  in  MPA,  and  1  in  ANCA-positive 
vasculitis. 
In the 99 case reports, a total of 81 serious adverse events were reported.  These events were most 
commonly  in  the  infections  and  infestations  SOC,  followed  by  respiratory,  thoracic,  and  mediastinal 
disorders SOC. 
Four events of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) have been spontaneously reported to the safety 
database  in  AAV  patients  receiving  rituximab;  alternative  risk  factors,  typically  use  of  corticosteroids 
and other immunosuppressants, may have contributed in the majority of case reports.  In addition, it 
is unknown if any of these patients received PJP prophylaxis, which is the standard of care in patients 
with AAV given their known risk of development of PJP (Green et al, 2007).  Of note, the reporting rate 
of  PJP  from  the  safety  database  was  lower  than  the  rate  reported  in  the  literature  in  AAV  patients 
(Ognibene  et  al,  1995,  Ward  and  Donald,  1999;  Falagas  et  al  2007).  Given  the  known  risk  of  PJP  in 
patients with AAV, the data presented here does not suggest that rituximab increases the risk of PJP in 
AAV  patients.  Four  additional  opportunistic  infections  (unconfirmed  PML),  cytomegalovirus  infection, 
Kaposi’s varicelliform eruption, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis) with fatal outcome were reported. As 
interpretation  of  spontaneous  reporting  is  limited  by  incomplete  reporting  of  events  as  well  as  an 
unknown denominator, reporting rates cannot be directly compared to incidences.  
The  events  described  in  these  cases  were  consistent  with  the  types  of  events  typically  reported  for 
patients with these disease states (WGET Research Group 2005; de Groot et al. 2009). 
No  confirmed  cases  of  PML  in  rituximab-treated  AAV  patients  in  the  Global  Safety  Database  were 
reported as of the cutoff date of 17 May 2011 or in the literature. There has been one suspected but 
unconfirmed  case  of  PML  in  a  patient  with  WG  that  occurred  approximately  2  months  after  the  last 
dose of rituximab reported in the Global Safety Database.  The patient also had diabetes mellitus, and 
renal  insufficiency  and  was  treated  with  multiple  concomitant  immunosuppressive  medications, 
including  prednisone,  CYC,  and  adalimumab.    Cerebrospinal  fluid  analysis  was  negative  for  JC  virus.  
The patient subsequently experienced pneumonia and died.  No additional case details were reported 
despite  multiple  contact  attempts  with  the  clinician.  One  recent  case  of  confirmed  PML  was  reported 
with  a  GPA  patient  treated  with  rituximab  during  the  assessment  of  this  application.  JC  virus  was 
detected following observation of neurological symptoms and the patient started antiviral therapy. 
Following  the  submission  of  a  Drug  Safety  Report  as  part  of  a  parallel  ongoing  safety  variation  to 
include Stevens Johnson’s syndrome (SJS) / toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) occurred in autoimmune 
indications in the SmPC, one case of SJS was reported in a patient treated with Mabthera for GPA.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The main reason to develop alternative treatment options for AAV, was the toxicity concerns of CYC.  
Rituximab  has  been  in  use  since  1997  initially  for  NHL  indications  and  later  approved  for  rheumatoid 
arthritis.  Estimated  around  2  million  patients  have  been  treated  with  this  compound,  thus  a 
Mabthera

considerable  amount  of  information  regarding  adverse  effects  has  been  made  available.  Of  main 
interest are primarily infusion reactions within 24 hours after the infusion either allergic or caused by 
the  cytokine  release  syndrome,  increase  in  rate  of  infections  among  which  reactivation  of  hepatitis  B 
can  be  fatal,  cardiac  disorders,  haematological  abnormalities  such  as  leukopenia.  The  most  feared 
complication is PML where activation of JC-virus can cause a rapid deteriorating neurological condition 
often  resulting  in  death  or  severe  neurological  deficiencies.    This  complication  is  found  most  often  in 
the lymphoma population where patients apart from RTX also receive a combination of cytotoxic drugs. 
A  few  cases  have  been  described  in  patients  with  rheumatic  conditions  without  concomitant 
immunosuppressive treatment.  
In the RAVE study the pattern of AEs did not deviate from what could be anticipated. The incidence of 
leukopenia was significantly lower for RTX treatment than for CYC however, the overall safety profile 
was comparable for the two treatments. The incidence of serious infections, malignancies or urotoxic 
events like (haemorrhagic) cystitis, was similar between RTX and CYC arm. There were similar rates 
per patient-year of any adverse event, however, specific AEs varied across treatment groups. The 
investigators had a priori selected AEs of special interest; these were: death, bone marrow suppression, 
infections, hemorrhagic cystitis, malignancies, venous thromboembolic event, hospitalizations, CVAs, 
and IRRs.  
As expected, more grade 2-4 lymphopenia/leukopenia was observed in the CYC group compared with 
RTX  leading  to  a  number  of  drug  discontinuation.  More  hospitalizations  occurred  in  the  RTX  group 
mainly due to infections or disease flares. Infections were upper respiratory or UTI. This could probably 
in part be explained by the slightly higher age of patients in the RTX group and a higher incidence of 
impaired  renal  function  in  that  group.  DVTs  occurred  more  often  in  the  CYC  group  (1%  in  the  RTX 
group vs. 8.2% in the CYC group at 18 months). IRRs were similar across the treatment arms and all 
were moderate or mild in severity. Cardiac events were higher in the RTX group by month 18; 18.2% 
vs.  12.2%.  This  was  largely  due  to  low-grade  tachycardias  and  atrial  fibrillation  occurring  in  the  RTX 
arm. Mild hypertension was also more pronounced in the RTX group.  
No case of PML has been reported in the trial or from spontaneous reports received up to the cut-off of 
31  August  2011,  but  one  case  was  received  from  spontaneous  reports  while  this  procedure  was 
ongoing.  The  overall  rate  of  PML  in  vasculitis  has  been  estimated  to  be  10.8  (0.27-60.39)/100,000 
person-years on the basis of a review of medical records of cases in the Normative Health Informatics 
claims database [Amend et al, 2010].  In a global literature review covering the years 1989 to 2010, 
there  were  five  published  reports of  confirmed  PML in  WG  patients  treated  with  CYC  and  prednisone, 
two  of  them  had  received  additional  immunosuppressive  therapies  (AZA,  methotrexate,  and 
cyclosporine in 1 patient and AZA and mycophenolate mofetil in the other).   
PML is known to occur in AAV patients treated with other therapies, is a known adverse drug reaction 
associated with rituximab and its risk increases when RTX is combined with other immunosuppressive 
(in particular cytotoxic) drugs. As AAV patients often have received one or more cycles of CYC before 
commencing RTX these patients should probably be placed in the same risk category as NHL patients 
in the enhanced PhV plan and instead of the category of autoimmune conditions such as RA.  
There  were  6  malignancies  in  5  patients  initially  treated  with  rituximab  and  2  malignancies  in  2 
patients initially treated with CYC over a total of 573.90 patient-years of follow up. Four of 5 patients 
in the RTX group who were diagnosed with malignancies had previous exposure to CYC, and the fifth 
patient, who did not have a history of prior immunosuppressive use, was diagnosed only 93 days into 
the  study,  thereby  suggesting  a  prevalent  rather  than  incident  cancer.  Similarly,  the  rates  of 
malignancy across both treatment groups in RAVE at the end of longer-term study follow-up (mean of 
3.0  years  in  the  RTX  group,  range  0.08  to  5.02  years)  are  consistent  with  the  published  malignancy 
rates  (based  on  SIRs)  in  AAV  with  or  without  treatment  with  CYC  as  concluded  from  a  literature

comparison (). Long term data are needed to study malignancies and for this purpose the follow-up of 
the RAVE study population and collection of data from participation in an EU registry are agreed in the 
context of the RMP. 
The  infusion-related-reactions  with  RTX  were  in  general  of  low  incidence  and  of  mild  character.  This 
might be due to high concurrent doss of corticosteroids.  
One of the advantages of RTX therapy seems to be that the incidence of venous thrombotic events was 
considerably lower than for CYC.  
There  are  no  adequate  and  well-controlled  studies  of  rituximab  in  pregnant  women.    Postmarketing 
data  indicate  that  B-cell  lymphocytopenia  generally  lasting  fewer  than  6  months  can  occur  in  infants 
exposed to rituximab in utero.  Rituximab was detected postnatally in the serum of infants exposed in 
utero.  
As follow up data on safety are considered important several options were being considered as follows:  
The MAH is conducting a multicenter (U.S.-based), prospective, observational study designed to follow 
100 rituximab-treated patients with GPA or MPA for a maximum of 4 years (Study WA27893 [RAVeR]).  
An  interim  analysis  will  be  performed  when  all  patients  are  enrolled  and  approximately  50%  of  the 
estimated total patient-year exposure data (327 patient years) have been collected. 
The MAH is in contact with principal investigators (PIs) from national patient registries. In addition to 
the  German  Register  in  Autoimmune  Diseases-II  (GRAID-II)  the  MAH  is  investigating  additional 
European  registries  to  generate  additional  standardised  data,  including  BIOGEAS  and  BIOBADASER 
(Spain)  and  has  committed  to  undertake  additional  follow-up  with  EUVAS  in  order  to  identify  and 
evaluate  additional  data  sources.  registries  in  the  E.U.  to  investigate  the  possibility  of  obtaining 
standardized  biannual  (or  annual)  adverse  event  (AE)  reports  from  cohorts  of  rituximab-treated  and 
rituximab-naive  ANCA-associated  vasculatis  (AAV)  patients:    the  National  Czech  Registry  of  AAV 
Patients (Hruskova Z et al. 2012), and two Spanish patient registries that recruit biologic-treated, non-
rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  patients (BIOGEAS and BIOBADASER  studies; Ramos-Casals M et al. 2010; 
BIOBADASER  2012).    The  MAH  will  continue  to  monitor  European  Vasculitis  Study  Group  (EUVAS) 
activities in case any relevant data sources may be identified in the future. The MAH will also monitor 
the  development  of  the  planned  Norwegian  National  Registry  of  Biologics  (NOKBIL).    This  national 
registry  will  recruit  patients  with  an  autoimmune  or  chronic  inflammatory  disease  indication  treated 
with  a  biologic  agent.    The  details  of  the  methodology  and  data  collection  are  not  yet  finalized.    The 
registry  is  planned  to  commence  in  2013  and  progress  on  the  methodology  will  be  monitored  in 
collaboration with the affiliate. 
The  medical  importance  of  limiting  the  exposure  to  the  lowest  possible  corticosteroid  dose  is 
recognized.    For  this  purpose,  reports  and  publications  from  the  PEXIVAS  trial,  or  other  trials 
evaluating lower steroid doses in conjunction with rituximab, will be provided to the CHMP once they 
have  been  published  and  become  available  to  the  MAH.  Following  publication  of  the  updated  EULAR 
recommendations  for  the  Management  of  Primary  Small  and  Medium  Vessel  Vasculitis  in  2013  the 
requirement for providing guidance on this issue will be reassessed. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In conclusion, the pattern of adverse events demonstrated in the RAVE study does not raise any new 
safety signals for rituximab. Long term safety data will be provided from ongoing studies (see RMP). 
The  investigation  of  a  lower  fixed  dose,  which  could  lead  to  a  better  safety  profile  (e.g.  in  terms  of 
infections), is recommended to the MAH. This is included in the RMP under section “infections’, so that 
the CHMP will be kept informed about further developments regarding dose finding.

It  is  expected  that  use  of  registry  data  will  add  to  the  long  term  safety  profile  of  rituximab  in  GPA, 
MPA. Data access from 3 E.U. registries (National Czech Registry of AAV Patients, two Spanish patient 
registries  BIOGEAS  and  BIOBADASER)  is  planned  in  the  context  of  the  RMP,  detailed  protocols  and 
possible  addition  of  a  4th  registry  will  be  included  in  the  next  revision  of  RMP  to  be  submitted  to  the 
CHMP for assessment by June 2013. 
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.  
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the MAH fulfils the legislative 
requirements. 
Risk management plan 
The  MAH  proposed  that  the  identified  risks,  Acute  Infusion-Related  Reactions,  Infections,  Impaired 
Immunisation Response, PML, HBV Reactivation, and Hypogammaglobulinaemia (newly identified) and 
the potential risks De Novo HBV, Opportunistic Infections, Malignant Events, Impact on Cardiovascular 
Disease, GI Perforation and neutropenia (newly identified) should also apply to the GPA/MPA indication. 
In  addition,  “Off-label  use  in  paediatrics − all  indications”  was  added  as  an  Important  Potential  Risk 
throughout the EU RMP, version 9.2. 
“Long  term  safety  in  GPA/  MPA  patients”  is  missing  with  regard  to  RTX  re-treatment  and  relapse. 
Therefore, “Long term safety in GPA/ MPA patients” is included in the RMP as missing information and 
data  access  from  the  identified  E.U.  registries  (National  Czech  Registry  of  AAV  Patients,  two  Spanish 
patient  registries  BIOGEAS  and  BIOBADASER,  one  in  UK)  should  be  included  in  the  next  revision  of 
RMP  as  an  additional  Pharmacovigilance  activity.  Draft  study  protocols  should  be  submitted  for 
assessment, in the upcoming planned RMP update.   
It  is  noted  that  the  MAH  will  actively  review  all  academia-  and  investigator-sponsored  studies  with 
different doses of rituximab to identify significant differences in the risk of severe infections related to 
the dose regimen.  A next revision of the RMP will be included in an ongoing procedure and is expected 
to be submitted in June 2013.  Added under RMP measures regarding the potential risk of ‘Infections’: 
to  provide  reports  and  publications  from  the  PEXVIAS  trial,  or  other  trials  evaluating  lower  steroid 
doses add-on to rituximab, as soon as available. 
The  medical  importance  of  limiting  the  exposure  to  the  lowest  possible  corticosteroid  dose  is 
recognized.    For  this  purpose,  reports  and  publications  from  the  PEXIVAS  trial,  or  other  trials 
evaluating lower steroid doses in conjunction with rituximab, will be provided to the CHMP once they 
have  been  published  and  become  available  to  the  MAH.  The  EULAR  Recommendations  for  the 
Management  of  Primary  Small  and  Medium  Vessel  Vasculitis  last  updated  in  2009  will  be  updated  in 
2013.  Following  publication  of  the  updated  EULAR  recommendations  in  2013  the  requirement  for 
providing separate guidance on this issue will be reassessed as an RMP measure.

Therefore it is proposed to ensure that label 
wording is maintained to reflect 
appropriate information related to off-label 
use. 
The MAH does not consider that additional

Pharmacoepidemiology studies refer to the Registry studies (British Society of Rheumatology Biologics Register 
(BSRBR) and the AntiRheumatic Therapy in Sweden Group (ARTIS) discussed in Section 3.3.1 in the respective 
pharmacovigilance plans). The BSRBR prospectively evaluates the safety profile of biologic agents, in particular the 
risks of neoplasms, serious co-morbidity and death in cohorts of patients taking particular biologics, compared with a 
cohort of patients who are being treated with non-biologic DMARDs only. The Swedish Registry is performing a 
post-marketing surveillance study including the presently available biologics used in treating patients with rheumatic 
diseases. This is performed in collaboration with the Swedish Society of Rheumatology and the Swedish Medical 
Products Agency, and aims to provide long term safety data on major comorbidities with the use of biologics. 
The below Pharmacovigilance activities are needed to investigate some of the safety concerns.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed post-
authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product. 
The PRAC also considered that routine PhV is sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk 
minimisation measures. 
2.8.  Update of the Product information   
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated (see Annex  to this report). The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Furthermore, since post authorisation measures have been agreed in the RMP and the CHMP has 
requested a revision (version 9.3) to be submitted by June 2013, this was reflected in the Annex in 
line with the latest QRD template rev. 9. 
Section “Additional risk minimisation measures” has been added to reflect the additional risk 
minimisation measures (educational material and patient alert card) agreed following the assessment 
of a previous RMP version (v7.0) and a related follow-up measure FUM070.1.  
Annex IIIA has been updated to reflect that the patient alert card is addressed to all patients with 
non-oncology indications (not only addressed to Rheumatoid Arthritis patients). 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The RAVE study showed convincingly that RTX was non-inferior to oral CYC + AZA. At month 6, 64% in 
the RTX arm was in remission vs. 55% in the CYC arm (95.1% CI of the difference:  -4.3% – 23.4%). 
thus, the primary objective of the study was achieved.  
The conclusion of non-inferiority in terms of percentage of patients who achieved complete remission 
at  month  6,  is  considered  valid;  The  pivotal  study  design  is  acceptable  and  appropriate  assay 
sensitivity is established. One single RCT is considered acceptable, given the rareness of the disease, 
the  high  response  rate  in  an  otherwise  fatal  disease,  and  the  predictable  control-response.  Subgroup 
Mabthera 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/462277/2013 
Page 61/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
analyses showed that non-inferiority was shown for  both disorders (GPA and MPA). The rate of flares 
and the proportion of patients remaining in complete remission was comparable in the two arms at 12 
months. 
Rituximab is demonstrated to be non-inferior as compared to standard CYC treatment for induction of 
remission  in  MPA  and  GPA  and  seems  to  be  particularly  effective  in  the  relapsing  forms  of  these 
conditions.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Although the dose recommendation is considered sufficiently justified, the lack of dose-finding studies 
conducted with rituximab in AAV is can be suggested that a flat, less frequent, and in total lower dose 
as  applied  in  RA  (booster  of  2  x  1000  mg  followed  by  maintenance  of  1000mg  every  6  months  as 
maintenance) may be as efficacious as the recommended dosing regimen of 4 x 375mg/ m2. Relevant 
measures to investigate this are agreed within the RMP.  
The RAVE study was designed to evaluate induction therapy at 6 months, and to observe the duration 
of  the  PD  and  clinical  effect  of  rituximab  in  the  long-term  follow-up.  As  the  study  was  designed  to 
evaluate  induction  therapy,  and  maintenance  of  efficacy  was  not  established,  the  original  general 
indication  has  been  restricted  to  induction  of  remission  in  adult  patients  with  severely  active 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). 
The need of active maintenance therapy to prevent  relapses was not investigated. However, relapse-
prevention  is  considered  relevant  as  relapses  may  be  severe  and  life-threatening.    A  relevant 
statement  that  maintenance  treatment  with  immunosuppressants  should  be  considered  for  relapse 
prevention, especially for  patients at risk (e.g. with  a history of earlier relapses and GPA, or patients 
with  a  reconstitution  of  B-lymphocytes  and  PR3-ANCA  at  monitoring)  is  added  in  section  5.1  of  the 
SmPC. Further studies on maintenance therapy are agreed in the context of the RMP. 
With  the  restriction  of  the  indication  to  induction  therapy  earlier  issues  on  a  general  treatment  of 
GPA/MPA due to limitations of the design of the pivotal RAVE trial, are now obsolete.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The  safety  profile  of  rituximab  is  well  known  from  its  use  in  lymphoma  and  rheumatoid  arthritis 
patients. ADRs of special importance are primarily infusion reactions within 24 hours after the infusion 
either  allergic  or  caused  by  the  cytokine  release  syndrome,  cardiac  disorders,  haematological 
abnormalities such as leukopenia increase in rate of infections among which reactivation of hepatitis B 
and PML can be fatal.  
In the RAVE study the pattern of AEs did not deviate from what could be anticipated. The overall safety 
was  comparable  between  the  2  groups,  with  similar  rates  per  patient-year  of  any  adverse  event, 
however,  specific  AEs  varied  across  treatment  groups.  The  investigators  had  a  priori  selected  AEs  of 
special  interest;  these  were:  death,  bone  marrow  suppression,  infections,  hemorrhagic  cystitis, 
malignancies,  venous  thrombo-embolic  event,  hospitalizations,  CVAs,  and  IRRs.  As  expected,  more 
grade  2-4  lymphopenia/leukopenia  was  observed  in  the  CYC  group  compared  with  RTX  leading  to  a 
number  of  drug  discontinuation.  More  hospitalizations  occurred  in  the  RTX  group  mainly  due  to 
infections  or  disease  flares.  Infections  were  upper  respiratory  or  UTI.  This  could  probably  in  part  be 
explained  by  the  slightly  higher  age  of  patients  in  the  RTX  group  and  a  higher  incidence  of  impaired 
Mabthera 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/462277/2013 
Page 62/66 
 
 
 
 
renal  function  in  that  group.  DVTs  occurred  more  often  in  the  CYC  group  (1%  in  the  RTX  group  vs. 
8.2%  in  the  CYC  group  at  18  month).  IRRs  were  similar  across  the  treatment  arms  and  all  were 
moderate  or  mild  in  severity.  Cardiac  events  were  higher  in  the  RTX  group  by  month  18;  18.2%  vs. 
12.2%. This was largely due to low-grade tachycardias and atrial fibrillation occurring in the RTX arm. 
Mild  hypertension  was  also  more  pronounced  in  the  RTX  group.  There  were  six  malignancies  in  5 
patients  initially  treated  with  rituximab  and  two  malignancies  in  2  patients  initially  treated  with  CYC 
over  a  total  of  573.90  patient-years  of  follow  up  in  RAVE.  The  rates  of  malignancy  across  both 
treatment  groups  are  consistent  with  the  published  malignancy  rates  (based on  SIRs)  in  AAV  with  or 
without treatment with CYC.  
The use of rituximab is also associated with JC-virus (PML) and other opportunistic infections, although 
these are also reported for cyclophosphamide in the literature.  
The incidence of venous thrombotic events was considerably lower for RTX than for CYC (5.1% versus 
9.2%),  which  may  be  of  interest  in  patients  at  risk.  Furthermore,  rituximab  is  not  known  to  be 
teratogenic or reducing fertility.  
In conclusion, the pattern of adverse events demonstrated in the RAVE study does not raise any new 
concerns. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The high rate of infections may be due to the co-medication of high doses of steroids, or the relatively 
high  rituximab  dose.    The  proposed  corticosteroid  dose  is  established  for  standard  therapy  with 
cyclophosphamide.    In  the  SPC  of  rituximab,  also  high  doses  of  glucocorticosteroids  (GC)  are 
recommended  as  co-medication  for  the  ANCA-vasculitis  indication.  Although  rituximab  caused  less 
leukopenia, earlier B-cell reconstitution, and less T-cell cytopenia compared to CYC, the rate of serious 
infections was the same. This might be partly related to the high GC doses that were used add-on to 
rituximab. Therefore, an additional RMP measure is requested for an update with data from an ongoing 
randomized trial in AAV patients, investigating whether a reduced cumulative dosing regimen of GCs is 
as effective as a standard regimen, add-on to rituximab. 
Regarding malignancies, the follow-up may be too short and the number of subjects may be too low to 
evaluate the risk. So far, rituximab is not clearly associated with a higher incidence of solid tumors in 
other indications. Although there may be confounding factors such as earlier use of CYC, smoking and 
high  age,  the  risk  could  however  is  not  to  be  fully  excluded.  A  longer  follow-up  of  the  RAVE  study 
population,  data  from  ongoing  studies  and  participation  in  registries  are  expected  to  provide  more 
information on long term safety and are agreed within the RMP. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The data derived from study RAVE are considered to demonstrate a clinically relevant benefit to 
patients as induction therapy considering the limited treatment options available for this serious 
disorder, since non-inferiority to CYC was demonstrated in terms of efficacy and a comparable safety 
profile is established.  
From a safety point of view the profile of rituximab there may be potential advantages as compared to 
CYC, such as lower risk of neurotoxicity, and infertility. These potential advantages cannot be detected 
yet based on short-term studies, but are considered relevant.   
Mabthera 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/462277/2013 
Page 63/66 
 
 
 
 
In general, treatment with rituximab was tolerable for the majority of subjects and overall the adverse 
event profile was consistent with previous experience.  There are no options available for patients 
resistant and intolerant to standard care with cyclophosphamide, and this is considered an unmet 
medical need.   
Benefit-risk balance 
The Benefit/Risk balance is considered positive for rituximab as induction treatment of severe GPA/MPA 
flares as rituximab may serve as an alternative treatment option for standard care with CYC, as non-
inferiority has been shown regarding efficacy and safety.  
Cyclophosphamide  has  specific  toxicity  which  is  not  evident  for  rituximab,  such  as  urotoxicity, 
teratogenicity,  and  impaired  fertility.  These  potential  advantages  cannot  be  detected  yet  based  on 
short-term studies, but are considered relevant.  
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The indication has been limited to the treatment of adults patients as the PDCO has issued a deferral 
for an observational paediatric study in 25 subjects aged 2-18 years of age. A waiver has been given 
for the population younger than 2 years of age.  
The benefit-risk of Mabthera in the indication: 
MabThera,  in  combination  with  glucocorticoids,  is  indicated  for  the  induction  of  remission  in 
adult  patients  with  severely  active  Granulomatosis  with  polyangiitis  (Wegener’s)  (GPA)  and 
Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). 
is therefore considered positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
The application for the following indication  
MabThera,  in  combination  with  glucocorticoids,  is  indicated  for  the  induction  of  remission  in 
adult  patients  with  severely  active  Granulomatosis  with  polyangiitis  (Wegener’s)  (GPA)  and 
Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). 
is approvable since major objections and other concerns have all been resolved. 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change:

severely active Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). 
SmPC sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 are also updated to reflect the efficacy and safety data 
for this indication. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
Furthermore, the Annex II is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 9 to state the 
deadline for the next RMP update (v9.3) and has also been updated to reflect the additional risk 
minimisation measures following the assessment of a previous RMP version (v7.0) and a related 
follow-up measure FUM070.1. Annex IIIA has been updated to reflect that the patient alert card is 
addressed to all patients with non-oncology indications (not restricted to Rheumatoid Arthritis 
patients). 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet.

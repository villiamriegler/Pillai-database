The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) applied for a new indication for treatment of chronic plaque 
psoriasis in children and adolescents from 4 years of age, based on data from study M04-717 ‘A 
multicentre, randomised, double-dummy, double-blind study evaluating two doses of adalimumab versus 
methotrexate in paediatric subjects with chronic plaque psoriasis. Consequently, the MAH proposed the 
update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC.  
The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in accordance. 
The MAH has also taken the opportunity to make some minor editorial amendments to the SmPC and 
Package Leaflet. 
A revised RMP version 11.2 was included as part of this application. 
The variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0324/2013 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0324/2013 was completed. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0324/2013.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Adalimumab  is  a  recombinant,  fully  human  immunoglobulin  (IgG1)  monoclonal  antibody  that  binds 
specifically to the soluble and transmembrane forms of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and inhibits the 
binding of TNF-α to its receptors. 
Adalimumab is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, active and progressive psoriatic arthritis, severe ankylosing spondylitis, moderate to 
severe chronic plaque psoriasis (in adults), moderate to severe Crohn's disease, and moderate to severe 
ulcerative colitis (UC). 
The psoriasis indication in adults reads as follows: 
“Humira is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients 
who failed to respond to or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy 
including cyclosporine, methotrexate or PUVA”. 
Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated proliferative disease of the skin. In the UK, the incidence rates for 
individuals with psoriasis that are <20 years of age is 110 per 100,000 person years for males and 121 
per 100,000 person years for females. In the Stanford Psoriasis Life History Survey, 27% of patients 
reported the onset before the age of 16, 10% before the age of 10, 6.5% before the age of 5, and 2% 
before the age of 2. 
The MAH sought to add the following new indication to the product labeling for Humira: “treatment of 
severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from 4 years of age who have had an 
inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical therapy and phototherapy” based on 
data from study M04-717, a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter study in pediatric 
subjects with severe chronic plaque psoriasis. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology and immunogenicity of adalimumab have been characterized in adult healthy 
subjects, as well as in adult subjects with RA, PsA, AS, CD, psoriasis and UC. In addition, the clinical 
pharmacology and immunogenicity of adalimumab in paediatric subjects with polyarticular JIA, 
enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA), and CD have also been studied. These data have been provided and 
assessed by the CHMP in previous submissions. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Population PK analyses were conducted using Non-Linear Mixed Effects Modeling in NONMEM, combining 
the serum adalimumab concentration data in paediatric subjects from different indications. The data from 
all subjects enrolled into the 5 pediatric studies (Studies DE038 (JIA), M06-806 (Crohn’s disease), 
M10-444 (JIA), M11-328 (ERA) and M04-717 (psoriasis)) that received adalimumab and had at least one 
adalimumab concentration above the lower limit of quantitation were included in the population 
pharmacokinetic analyses (total of 524 subjects (age 2-18 years)). For the Phase III study in psoriasis

patients, only PK data available at the time of the interim analysis were included (cut-off date 02 Dec 
2013). The summary of the demographic data stratified by indication is presented in table 1. 
Table 1. Summary demographics per indication 
The variables anti-adalimumab antibodies (AAA), age, sex, race, weight (WTKG), body surface area 
(BSA), Albumin (ALB), CRP, CRCL, BILI, GOT, GPT, Methotrexate (MTX), IND (describing the indications 
RA, PS, and CD) were tested as covariates on CL/F and V2/F in the forward inclusion process.  
Results 
In addition to the significant AAA effect on apparent clearance the final model included the covariates 
body surface area (BSA), MTX concomitant use, Baseline albumin concentration (ALB) on CL/F and BSA 
on V2/F. PK parameters were not different between disease indications, when adjusted for the significant 
covariates. 
VPCs stratified by indication as well as by age showed agreement between observed concentrations and 
simulations without any systematic deviations. 
Evaluation of immunogenicity 
The frequency and impact of Anti-adalimumab antibodies (AAA) was evaluated using interim PK and 
efficacy data available from the Phase III study in pediatric psoriasis patients (n=94). Serum 
measurement of AAA were obtained at baseline (Week 0A) and at Weeks 11A, 16A, 12B, 16B, 0C, 11C, 
0D, 8D, and 16D (where A, B, C and D denotes period).  
Samples were analyzed for screening and confirmatory AAA assay using a validated double antigen 
immunoassay, detecting free (unbound) AAA. Consistent with previous studies with adalimumab only, 
samples in which the adalimumab concentration was low (<2 µg/mL) were analyzed for AAA. The LLOQ 
for AAA was established at 10.31 ng/mL in undiluted serum and 1.031 ng/mL in 10% diluted serum. For 
those samples with a quantifiable AAA concentration (above 20 ng/mL), additional suppression tests 
(addition of adalimumab serum) were performed to evaluate the specificity of the AAA response.  
Results 
In the initial double-blind period (Period A), the percentage of subjects with AAA+ samples was 
approximately 13% (10 of 77 subjects) following treatment with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg and adalimumab 
0.4 mg/kg. After withdrawal of adalimumab in Period B, the percentage of subjects with AAA+ samples 
increased to 26.8% (11 of 41 subjects). Of the 11 subjects who had AAA+ samples, 6 subjects were 
measured as AAA+ only during withdrawal (Period B). Upon re-treatment (Period C), the percentage of 
subjects with AAA+ samples decreased to approximately 10% (3 of 30 subjects) for the adalimumab 
groups, which was similar to the rates observed prior to treatment withdrawal (Period A).  
There was a significant impact of AAA on the exposure to adalimumab, as illustrated in Figure 3.

Figure 1 Interim Mean + SD Serum Adalimumab Concentrations Versus Time Profiles Stratified by AAA+ 
Status 
The impact of AAA on clinical outcome was also evaluated using the interim data. The primary efficacy 
endpoints were the proportion of subjects achieving a ≥PASI 75 response and a PGA score of 0/1 at Week 
16A. Interim analysis of the primary efficacy by AAA status was performed at Week 16A (Table 3).  
Table 2 Proportion of Subject Achieving PASI 75/PGA Response by AAA Status at Week 16A 
(InterimAnalysis) 
Ten subjects were AAA+ at Week 16A; five in the 0.8 mg/kg and five in the 0.4 mg/kg group. The 
proportion of AAA+ subjects achieving PASI 75 and PGA 0/1 response at Week 16A was similar to AAA– 
subjects except for PGA 0/1 responders in the 0.4 mg/kg group. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Adalimumab is a recombinant, fully human immunoglobulin (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that binds 
specifically to the soluble and transmembrane forms of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-á and inhibits the 
binding of TNF-á to its receptors.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The population pharmacokinetic model adequately described the data in paediatric patients with chronic 
plaque psoriasis. As described for the interim PK analysis the effect of AAA+ on adalimumab CL is 
substantial, causing a five-fold increase. 
The presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies (AAA) significantly reduced adalimumab serum exposures in 
pediatric subjects with psoriasis in Study M04-717. In the initial double-blind treatment period (Period A), 
there were only 10 of 77 AAA+ subjects (13%); 5 subjects in the adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg dose group and 
5 subjects in the adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg group. In the 0.8 mg/kg group, 3 of 5 AAA+ subjects achieved 
a PASI 75 or PGA 0,1 response by Week 16A. The serum adalimumab trough concentration values in these 
subjects at Week 16A were 0, 0, and 1.03 µg/mL. The number of AAA+ subjects in each treatment group 
was too small to make a definitive conclusion regarding the impact of AAA+ on efficacy; therefore, an 
additional PK/PD analysis was conducted by the MAH to assess the impact of AAA on efficacy. The 
relationship between adalimumab exposure (trough serum concentrations) and primary efficacy 
endpoints in Study M04-717 was examined in AAA– subjects. The percentage of AAA– subjects achieving 
a PASI 75 response or a PGA score of 0,1 at Week 16A was plotted against measured adalimumab trough 
concentrations categorized into quartiles. Of the 33 subjects in the lower 2 quartiles, 25 subjects were in 
the 0.4 mg/kg group. Similarly, of the 34 subjects in the upper 2 quartiles, 26 subjects were in the 0.8 
mg/kg group. The exposure-response relationship for PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 showed that lower 
adalimumab concentrations are associated with lower PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 response rates. The 
proportion of subjects with PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 responses in the first quartile was about 31%. Therefore, 
the response rate in AAA+ subjects may be lower than observed in Study M04-717 (3 of 5 subjects), 
based on the comparison to adalimumab trough concentration in AAA– subjects. It is important to note 
that the number of AAA+ subjects in each treatment group is too small to make a definitive conclusion 
regarding the impact of AAA+ on efficacy. 
Prevalence of AAA+ by Indication 
The prevalence of AAA+ was also assessed in studies for different pediatric indications, including 
psoriasis, JIA, ERA, and CD. In Study M04-717, immunogenicity data for pediatric subjects with psoriasis 
was plotted separately for the primary treatment phase (Period A) and re-treatment phase (Period C; 
longer term continuous adalimumab administration). It is noteworthy to mention that subjects with JIA 
received adalimumab as monotherapy or in combination with MTX. The rate of AAA+ in subjects with 
pediatric psoriasis was 13%, which was in the range observed for other indications. 
Differentiation of AAA+ subjects by the adalimumab dose groups, 0.8 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg, was also 
investigated in Periods A and C of Study M04-717. At the end of Period A (Week 16A), there were 5 
subjects in each dose group, whereas at the end of Period C, there were 2 subjects that were AAA+ in the 
0.8 mg/kg group and 1 subject that was AAA+ in the 0.4 mg/kg group. 
The prevalence of AAA ranged from 3.3% in subjects with CD to 25.6% for subjects with JIA. In the 
presence of MTX, the prevalence of AAA in subjects with JIA was 5.9 %, suggesting that co-administration 
of MTX is associated with lower prevalence of AAA. The prevalence of AAA in subjects with psoriasis at the 
end of Period A (Week 16A) was 13% and at the end of a longer term administration (end of Period C) was 
7.9%, which was between the ranges observed for other indications. 
The prevalence of AAA+ status across age groups was also investigated for Study M04-717.  The number 
of AAA+ subjects and total subjects in each quartile who received adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg are also listed. 
The AAA+ incidence appeared to be comparable for the first 3 quartiles over an age range of 5 to 16 
years, with only small differences (1 to 2 subjects). In the fourth quartile (age range of 16 to 18 years), 
only 1 of 17 subjects (5.9%) was AAA+.

EMA/177541/2015  
Page 11/58 
 
 
 
 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK/PD analysis suggested a reduction in efficacy in AAA+ pediatric psoriasis patients, as described in 
the SmPC for all indications. The CHMP concluded that the prevalence of AAA+ appears comparable in this 
population vs. other indications. Body size was also a significant predictor of adalimumab PK supporting 
the use of weight based dosing. In addition, albumin was identified as a covariate affecting CL, however 
this effect was modest and does not warrant dose-adjustment. Disease was not a significant covariate in 
the model and thus it may be concluded that the pharmacokinetics in this new patient population is 
similar to that in previously treated paediatric patients. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dose response studies have been performed. The efficacy of two doses of adalimumab was evaluated 
in the performed main efficacy study. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Study M04-717: “A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Dummy, Double-Blind Study Evaluating Two Doses 
of Adalimumab versus Methotrexate (MTX) in Pediatric Subjects with Chronic Plaque Psoriasis (Ps)”. 
Methods 
Study M04-717, is a Phase 3, randomized, 4-period, double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre clinical 
trial conducted in paediatric subjects from 4 through 17 years of age with severe chronic plaque psoriasis. 
Study participants 
The study included paediatric subjects 4-17 years of age with chronic plaque psoriasis. 
The main inclusion criteria were: 
1. Subject was ≥4 years and <18 years of age; 
2. Subject weighed ≥13 kg; 
3. Subject failed to respond to topical therapy; 
4. Subject needed systemic treatment to control his/her disease and met one of the following: 
● PGA ≥4 
● Body surface area (BSA) involved >20% 
● Very thick lesions with BSA >10% 
● PASI >20 
● PASI >10 and at least one of the following: 
○ Active PsA unresponsive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
○ Clinically relevant facial involvement 
○ Clinically relevant genital involvement 
○ Clinically relevant hand and/or foot involvement 
○ Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) >10 
The main exclusion criteria were: 
1. Prior biologic use other than prior treatment with etanercept; 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/177541/2015  
Page 12/58 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Treatment with etanercept therapy within 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit; 
3. MTX use within the past year or prior MTX use at any time where the subject did not adequately 
respond or did not tolerate MTX; 
4. Contraindication for treatment with MTX during the study; 
5. Erythrodermic Ps, generalized or localized pustular Ps, medication-induced or medication-exacerbated 
Ps, or new onset guttate Ps; 
6. Infection(s) requiring treatment with intravenous (IV) anti-infectives within 30 days prior to the 
baseline visit or oral anti-infectives within 14 days prior to the baseline visit. 
Treatments 
Subjects who met enrolment criteria were randomized in a 1:1:1 ration to either methotrexate, 
adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg or adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg. 
At the time of data cut-off for the Study M04-717 interim CSR (02 December 2013), 69 subjects (60.5%) 
had completed the study (through Period D); 24 subjects (21.1%) had discontinued from the study, 18 of 
whom discontinued during Period D; and 21 subjects (18.4%) were still ongoing in the study (in Period 
D). 
The study design for study M04-717 is shown below (figure 4). The study is comprised of 4 periods and 
the objective of each period is shown in the table below.

Discontinuation: 
13 subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg discontinued from the study, whereas 8 subjects 
randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg and 3 subjects randomized to MTX discontinued from the study. 
Lack of efficacy was the most reported primary reason for discontinuation. Two subjects discontinued 
because of an adverse event as primary reason (1 subject randomized to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg had an 
event of moderate Ps flare in Period C and 1 subject initially randomized to MTX, but receiving 
adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, had an event of severe urticaria in Period D).  
Objectives 
The objectives of the study were to determine the safety and efficacy of two doses of adalimumab versus 
MTX in pediatric subjects with severe chronic plaque psoriasis, to determine the time to loss of disease 
control, the ability to regain response upon re-treatment, and to examine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
immunogenicity of adalimumab following subcutaneous (SC) administration in this subject population 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoints were: 
● The proportion of subjects achieving a ≥PASI 75 response at Week 16A, adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg 
versus MTX. 
● The proportion of subjects achieving a PGA "cleared" or "minimal" (0 or 1) at Week 16A, 
adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX. 
The a priori defined order of the statistical hypotheses is: 
● Superiority of adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX, regarding the proportion of subjects

● Superiority of adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX, regarding the proportion of subjects 
achieving a PGA "cleared" or "minimal" (0 or 1) at Week 16A. 
The following secondary variables were evaluated per the ranking order: 
1. The proportion of subjects achieving a PASI 90 at Week 16A, adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX 
2. The proportion of subjects achieving a PASI 100 at Week 16A, adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX 
3. Change from baseline in the CDLQI scores at Week16A, adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX 
4. Change from baseline in the PedsQL scores at Week16A, adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX 
5. The proportion of subjects achieving PGA "cleared" or "minimal" (0 or 1) upon completion of 
re-treatment (Period C), according to the original randomized group assignment in Period A (adalimumab 
0.8 mg/kg versus adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg). 
6. Time to loss of disease control (Period B), according to the original randomized group assignment in 
Period A (adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg and MTX). 
Sample size 
The sample size calculation was based on the following assumed responder rates (Table 5).

With these assumptions, the total of 111 subjects (37 subjects in each group) provided 90% power for the 
comparison of adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX in PASI 75 response rate and 80% power for the 
comparison of adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX in PGA response rate. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized to receive adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg, or MTX in a 1:1:1 
ratio, respectively. Randomization was stratified by prior treatment with etanercept. 
Blinding (masking) 
All the MAH’s personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the trial, (with the 
exception of the MAH’s Drug Supply Management Team), the PI, study site personnel, and the subject 
were to remain blinded to each subject's treatment throughout the blinded period of the study. 
Statistical methods 
All efficacy analyses were based on the ITT population. 
The two primary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of subjects achieving a PASI ≥75 response and 
the proportion of subjects achieving a PGA "cleared" or "minimal" (0 or 1) response at Week 16A. These 
endpoints were tested in hierarchical order, first PASI then PGA, at a level of significance of 5% to 
preserve the overall type I error. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/177541/2015  
Page 15/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Due to the expected small number of subjects per group with prior etanercept treatment, the primary 
confirmatory analysis was to be done without stratification using a chi-square test or Fisher's exact test 
if expected cell count was less than 5 at alpha level of 5%. Analysis using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test 
stratified for prior etanercept use was to be done as sensitivity analysis. 
Subjects who did not have PGA or PASI assessments at Week 16A were to be imputed as nonresponders 
in the primary analysis and using LOCF for continuous variables. This includes subjects that "early 
escaped" during the initial 16-week Period A.

Recruitment 
A total of 114 subjects were recruited at 38 sites in Canada, the EU, and rest of world (Chile, Mexico, 
Switzerland, and Turkey). 
Conduct of the study 
Eleven subjects were judged to have major protocol deviations; i.e., protocol deviations with a potential 
impact on the primary variable of the study, and were excluded from the PP analysis set:

Table 9. Baseline disease measures (ITT set) 
All subjects reported prior topical use of medication for psoriasis. One half of the subjects had previously 
received phototherapy. Approximately 10% had previously used etanercept and one-third of the subjects 
had previously used a systemic nonbiologic treatment. The most frequently reported prior psoriasis 
treatments, reported by >30% of subjects were vitamin D analogue, mid to high potency corticosteroids 
and ultraviolet B narrow band UVB treatment.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoints 
The results were presented for the two primary efficacy endpoints to compare the adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg 
and MTX treatment groups in the proportion of subjects achieving a ≥PASI 75 response and the 
proportion of subjects achieving a PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) response at Week 16A (Period A). 
The results presented for the primary endpoints were based on the ITT set. The primary method of 
handling missing or incomplete data was the nonresponder imputation (NRI) method. Sensitivity analysis 
included last observation carried forward (LOCF) and observed cases analyses. Results from LOCF and 
observed cases analyses were similar to NRI. 
A statistically significantly higher proportion of subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg achieved 
a PASI 75 response at Week 16A than subjects randomized to MTX (57.9% versus 32.4%, p = 0.027) 
(see table below).

Page 20/58 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 11. Proportion of Subjects Who Achieved a PASI 75 or PGA 0, 1 Response at Week 16A 
(NRI) (ITT Set) 
The other primary endpoint investigated, the response at Week 16A of PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal), did 
not reach statistical significance (see Table 11).  
Secondary endpoints 
The ranked secondary endpoints provide support for the 2 primary endpoints; however, because the 
secondary ranked primary endpoint (PGA 0.1 [cleared, minimal]) did not achieve statistical significance, 
none of the secondary ranked endpoints can be interpreted as confirmatory. 
Initial response (Period A) 
Period A was a 16-week period of initial treatment in which subjects were randomized to adalimumab 0.4 
mg/kg, adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, or MTX. 
A higher proportion (20% to 39%) of subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg achieved PASI 
50/75/90 and PGA 0,1 responses than subjects randomized to MTX. Statistical significance was observed 
as early as Week 4A for PASI 50/75 and as early as Week 8A for PASI 90. No statistical significance was 
observed for any of the timepoints in PASI 100 responses. 
At Week 16A, an improvement in the mean CDLQI and PedsQL scores was greater for subjects 
randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg than subjects randomized to MTX (see table below). The change 
from baseline in PedsQL at Week 16A was statistically significant.

Table 12. Clinically Meaningful Improvements in Primary and Ranked Secondary Endpoints 
Loss of response (Period B) 
Subjects who achieved both a PASI 75 and a PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) response after 16 weeks of initial 
treatment in Period A had their treatment withdrawn for up to 36 weeks in Period B. 
The time to loss of disease control, defined as a worsening of PGA scores in comparison to Week 16A by 
at least 2 grades after treatment withdrawal, was numerically shorter for subjects randomized to 
adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg than subjects who were randomized to MTX. 
No subjects experienced a loss of disease control during the withdrawal period of the study that met the 
definition of rebound, defined as a PASI score at least 125% above baseline PASI within 90 days of 
treatment discontinuation. 
Retreatment (Period C) 
In Period C, subjects who lost disease control during Period B were re-treated for 16 weeks with their 
initially randomized adalimumab dose regimen or, if they were initially randomized to MTX, with 
adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg. PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) responses at Week 16C for subjects 
initially randomized to MTX, therefore, are a result from exposure to both MTX (during initial treatment in 
Period A) and adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg (during re-treatment in Period C). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/177541/2015  
Page 22/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, the PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) response 
rates during initial treatment and re-treatment were similar (PASI 75 response of 78.9% (15 of 19 
subjects) and PGA clear or minimal of 52.6% (10 of 19 subjects)). For subjects randomized to MTX, the 
response rate to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg in Period C was higher and occurred faster than the response 
rate to MTX in Period A (Figure 6). 
Figure 6. Comparison of PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 (Cleared, Minimal) Response Rates Between 
Initial Treatment in Period A and Re-Treatment in Period C for Subjects Initially Randomized 
to Adalimumab  0.8 mg/kg or Methotrexate (NRI) (ITT Set)  
Subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg or to MTX, who were re-treated with adalimumab 0.8 
mg/kg, also had an improvement in mean CDLQI and mean PedsQL values. 
Maintenance (Period D) 
Period D is a 52-week long-term follow-up period during which subjects continued to receive adalimumab 
0.4 mg/kg or adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg or continued to be observed off-treatment, if their disease remained 
under control after treatment withdrawal in Period B. At the time of data cut-off for the Study M04-717 
interim CSR (02 December 2013), 21 subjects (18.4%) were still ongoing in the study. 
PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) response rates for subjects initially randomized to adalimumab 
0.8 mg/kg or MTX were retained through at least Week 40D (Figure 7).

Figure 7. PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 (Cleared, Minimal) Response Rates During Treatment 
Maintenance in Period D for Subjects Initially Randomized to Adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg or 
Methotrexate and Receiving Adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg in Period D (NRI) (ITT Set) 
For subjects initially randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, who achieved an adequate clinical response 
in Period A, lost disease control in Period B, and re-achieved an adequate clinical response in Period C, 
PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) response rates appeared to be maintained for the full 52 weeks 
in Period D. In addition, PASI 50/75/90/100 response rates were generally as high or higher at Week 52D 
than at Week 16A. 
The improvement in CDLQI that was achieved at Week 16A appeared to be maintained with adalimumab 
0.8 mg/kg throughout Period D and the proportion of subjects who achieved CDLQI scores of 0 at Week 
16A generally increased with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg treatment throughout Period D. Subjects 
randomized to MTX and treated with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg in Period D showed an approximate 5-fold 
increase in mean change from baseline in PedsQL at Week 52D, as compared to Week 16A. 
Ancillary analyses 
Nonresponders  
Subjects who did not achieve a PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) response by Week 16A were 
considered nonresponders. These subjects continued directly to Period D, where they received open-label 
adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg for 52 weeks. A total of 51 subjects met the definition of nonresponder (19 
subjects randomized to MTX, 18 subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg, and 14 subjects 
randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg). 
In a subgroup analysis of nonresponders from Period A, who entered Period D directly and received 
adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, the PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 response rates during Period D were similar to the 
response rates for subjects who achieved PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) responses in Period A 
(for subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg) and Period C (for subjects randomized to 
adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg and subjects initially randomized to MTX, but receiving adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg) 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/177541/2015  
Page 24/58 
 
 
 
 
 
The majority of nonresponders who were initially randomized to MTX and who continued directly to Period 
D achieved a PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) response with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg after 16 
weeks and sustained this response to the end of the study at Week 52D. 
All nonresponders, whether initially randomized to adalimumab or MTX, had an improvement in their 
mean CDLQI and PedsQL values after treatment with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg for 52 weeks in Period D. 
Dose-response discussions 
Final results for Period A through Period C of this study suggest that adalimumab, at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg, 
was more effective than adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg in the treatment of the subject population. A 
substantially higher proportion of subjects treated with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg achieved clinical response 
(by PASI 75 or PGA 0,1 [cleared, minimal]), as compared with subjects treated with adalimumab 0.4 
mg/kg. The differences in PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) response rates between the 2 
adalimumab dose groups were not statistically significant. 
In Period A, after 16 weeks of initial treatment, PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) response rates 
were approximately 15 to 20 percentage points higher for subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg 
than subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg. Additionally, at Week 16A, results from the CDLQI 
showed a greater mean decrease (improvement) for subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg than 
subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg. 
Following treatment withdrawal, re-treatment for 16 weeks (Period C) showed a 28.3% difference in PGA 
response rates between subjects re-treated with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg (i.e., subjects from the 
randomized adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg and MTX groups) and subjects re-treated with adalimumab 0.4 
mg/kg. A similar treatment difference (25.3%) was observed when the response rates for re-treatment of 
subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg was compared to the response rate for re-treatment of 
subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg. 
During the long-term maintenance period (Period D), subjects treated with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg had 
higher PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) response rates overall than subjects treated with 
adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg (20% to 25% for PASI 75 and up to 12% for PGA 0,1 [cleared, minimal]).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In support of the present application, to extend the indication of Humira to treat not only adults, but 
children from the age of 4 years old and adolescents with chronic plaque psoriasis, the MAH has submitted 
a Phase 3, randomized, 4-period, double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre clinical trial. The study 
design is somewhat complex but has been agreed upon at scientific advice meetings and is accepted. The 
study is not yet completed; the long-term follow up period was on-going at the time of submission of the 
variation application (as described in the RMP). 
114 subjects were randomized to receive adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg, or 
methotrexate (MTX) in a 1:1:1 ratio, respectively. 
The statistical methods used in the study are considered acceptable. 16 out of 114 subjects received the 
wrong medication which is considered a fairly large number. The MAH clarified that the incidence of the 
error ”wrong medication” occurred at single time points in the study and the MAH’s view that the overall 
study result would not have changed due to these errors is endorsed by the CHMP. 
The demographic characteristics demonstrated that only two subjects between the age of 4 and 6 were 
exposed to adalimumab, and these subjects were randomized to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg. Consequently 
there are no subjects below the age of 6 that have received adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, the dose proposed 
for marketing. The numbers of subjects at the age of 6, 7 and 8 years of age were approximately 5 in 
every age group, while the majority of subjects were 9-18 years of age. It was a slight majority for girls 
in the study, as could be expected considering the gender distribution of the disease. The vast majority of 
participating subjects was white and of normal height according to their age. The weight was somewhat 
on the higher level, as could be expected in subjects with psoriasis. 
The severity of psoriasis was evaluated using the PASI and the PGA scales which are often used psoriasis 
scales. According to the MAH, the subjects included in the study had severe psoriasis, which partly can be 
agreed upon. In the PASI scale, moderate to severe psoriasis has a score between 10 and 20, while 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/177541/2015  
Page 29/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
severe psoriasis has a score above 20. The average score in the study was 18.3. The PGA scale used 
cleared, minimal, mild, moderate, marked and severe to define the disease severity of the patients. 
During the procedure the MAH clarified that severity of psoriasis assessment for inclusion in Study 
M04-717 was based not only on the PASI and PGA scores, but also on the thickness, distribution, and 
location of the lesions, with thicker lesions or lesions affecting functionally and socially important 
locations, such as the hands, feet, face, and genitals, conferring higher severity.. The Physician's Global 
Assessment (PGA) of disease severity was defined as the degree of overall lesion severity at the time of 
the physician's evaluation of the subject. The PGA was based on definitions for different degrees of 
scaling, erythema, and induration. The protocol specified that each site should make every attempt to 
have the same individual (i.e., efficacy assessor) conduct a patient's assessment throughout Period A. 
The protocol also specified that the PGA is static and refers to the subject's disease state at the time of the 
assessment and is not a comparison to the subject's previous disease state, whether at Screening, 
Baseline, or any other previous visits. When using these subdivisions, approximately half of the subjects 
had moderate and half had marked psoriasis, while only a few subjects had a severe form, one subject 
had a minimal and a few subjects had mild psoriasis. The average subject had 28% of the body surface 
area affected by psoriasis lesions.  
According to the proposed SmPC, the dosing of adalimumab is different in paediatric patients compared 
to adults, who start with a bolus dose. The MAH clarified that the different dosing in paediatric patients 
compared to adults who start with a bolus dose of adalimumab resulted in comparable serum adalimumab 
concentrations. Moreover, comparable efficacy results, measured as PASI scores, were obtained in 
paediatric and adult subjects although the initial dose differed. Thus, there appears to be no impact of the 
difference in initial adalimumab dose for paediatric and adult patients. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
The proposed recommended dose in Paediatric plaque psoriasis is 0.8 mg per kg body weight reflecting 
the regimen that was used in Study M04-717. In the current Humira product information, dosing for the 
approved pediatric indications of JIA and ERA is determined by body surface area. The MAH clarified that 
that the difference in dosing recommendations between JIA and psoriasis should not confusing for the 
dermatologists who would be prescribing Humira for pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis as there is 
clear separation of the dosing recommendations according to indication in the product information and 
the recommended dosing recommendations for each indication is clearly presented. Additionally, a 
comparison of body weight versus body surface area dosing regimens demonstrated that the proposed 
dosing regimen would, in general, be within a similar range as that already in the Humira label and would 
not result in significant over dosing or under dosing if the incorrect dosing table was referenced. Finally, 
the steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations for pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis who 
received the proposed recommended dose of 0.8 mg/kg bodyweight eow are similar to the steady-state 
serum adalimumab concentrations for patients with polyarticular JIA who received the recommended 
dose of 24 mg/m2 body surface area (for patients 2 to <4 and 4 to 12 years of age) administered eow. The 
CHMP agreed with this rationale and was reassured that if a physician should follow the dosing table for 
JIA, instead of psoriasis, or vice-versa, the systemic exposure of adalimumab is likely to be very similar 
to that which would be obtained if the correct dosing table had been followed. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The results following 16 weeks of treatment (Period A) demonstrated that the efficacy of adalimumab 0.8 
mg/kg, measured as per cent subjects reaching PASI 75, seems to be higher than that of adalimumab 0.4 
mg/kg. The dose proposed for marketing in subjects with paediatric psoriasis is 0.8 mg/kg. Moreover, 
treatment with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg seems to be higher than that of methotrexate (PASI 75: 57.9% 
vs. 32.4% p=0.027; PGA: 60.5%vs. 40.5% p=0.083). The difference in per cent efficacy superior to that 
efficacy achieved with methotrexate is approximately 26 (for PASI 75).  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/177541/2015  
Page 30/58 
 
 
 
 
The efficacy of adalimumab in adult patients with psoriasis was according to the approved product 
information evaluated using the same efficacy scores as in the present application. The efficacy results in 
in children and adolescents seem overall to be less convincing than in adults. This might have affected the 
MAH in designing the responder rates in the sample size calculation. The postulated responder rate in 
PASI 75 was 69% responder rate for adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, while the outcome was 57%. 
The second primary endpoint, the response at Week 16A of PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal), did not reach 
statistical significance. A tendency of efficacy was obtained, while statistical significance using this 
endpoint has been obtained in adult psoriasis patients. The MAH concluded that the lack of statistical 
significance might be due to the limited sample size and power of the study or to an imbalance of 
exposure to prior nonbiologic treatment or etanercept. This might be the case. However, the CHMP can 
only conclude that a less convincing efficacy has been demonstrated in paediatric subjects with psoriasis 
compared to the adult population.  
The CHMP also noted that no subjects at the proposed lower age limit for treatment, between 4-6 years, 
have been exposed to the dose proposed for marketing since they were randomised to adalimumab 0.4 
mg/kg. During the procedure the MAH argued that the clinical features of plaque psoriasis are essentially 
the same among younger and older subjects within the paediatric population. In addition, the 
pharmacokinetic data in the submitted study M04-717 and PK data in other paediatric indication, 
particular in polyarticular JIA where Humira is approved from 2 years of age, demonstrate that the PK and 
exposure of adalimumab are similar between subjects 4 to 6 years of age and 6 to 17 years of age when 
dosed at 0.8 mg/kg. Finally the safety of Humira was overall similar in the paediatric population compared 
to the adult population.  
Considering both the PK and safety profile of adalimumab, the 4 years of age as lower age limit for 
treatment of children with chronic plaque psoriasis is accepted by the CHMP. 
Subjects who achieved both a PASI 75 and a PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) response after 16 weeks of initial 
treatment in Period A had their treatment withdrawn for up to 36 weeks in Period B and the time to loss 
of disease control was investigated. The time to loss of disease control, defined as a worsening of PGA 
scores in comparison to Week 16A by at least 2 grades after treatment withdrawal, was numerically 
shorter for subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, than subjects who were randomized to MTX. 
This finding could be anticipated considering the higher responder rates for adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg in 
PASI scores at week 16A.  
In Period C, subjects who lost disease control during Period B were re-treated for 16 weeks with their 
initially randomized adalimumab dose regimen or, if they were initially randomized to MTX, with 
adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg. The efficacy of adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg (PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) 
response rates) was similar following the 16 week retreatment period C in subjects that previously 
(period A) had been randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg (PASI 75 response of 78.9% (15 of 19 
subjects) and PGA clear or minimal of 52.6% (10 of 19 subjects)). Subjects that had been initially treated 
with MTX, and in Period C treated with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, demonstrated a higher and faster 
response rate to adalimumab than to MTX in Period A. 
Period D is a 52-week long-term follow-up period during which subjects continued to receive adalimumab 
0.4 mg/kg or adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg or continued to be observed off-treatment, if their disease remained 
under control after treatment withdrawal in Period B. At the time of data cut-off for the Study M04-717 
interim CSR (02 December 2013), 21 subjects (18.4%) were still ongoing in the study. The efficacy of 
adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg seems to be maintained over the 52 week follow up period which is reflected also 
in the CDLQI.  
Ancillary analysis was performed on nonresponders, defined as subjects who did not achieve a PASI 75 
and PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) response by Week 16A. These subjects continued directly to Period D, 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/177541/2015  
Page 31/58 
 
 
 
 
where they received open-label adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg for 52 weeks. The PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 response 
rates during Period D were similar to the response rates for subjects who achieved PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 
(cleared, minimal) responses in Period A (for subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg) and Period 
C (for subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg and subjects initially randomized to MTX, but 
receiving adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg). The majority of nonresponders who were initially randomized to MTX 
and who continued directly to Period D achieved a PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal) response with 
adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg after 16 weeks and sustained this response to the end of the study at Week 52D. 
During the procedure, and in order to increase the flexibility of each treatment center to decide on the 
phototherapy treatment, the CHMP requested the MAH to amend the indication as follows: 
“Humira is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from 
4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical 
therapy and phototherapies”. 
This was agreed by the MAH. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of Humira was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, controlled study of 114 paediatric 
patients from 4 years of age with severe chronic plaque psoriasis who were inadequately controlled with 
topical therapy and heliotherapy or phototherapy. Patients received Humira 0.8mg/kg eow (up to 40 mg), 
0.4 mg/kg eow (up to 20 mg), or methotrexate 0.1 – 0.4 mg/kg weekly (up to 25 mg). At week 16, more 
patients randomised to Humira 0.8 mg/kg had positive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than those 
randomised to 0.4mg/kg eow or MTX.  
Patients who achieved PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal were withdrawn from treatment for up to 36 
weeks and monitored for loss of disease control (i.e. a worsening of PGA by at least 2 grades). Patients 
were then re-treated with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow for an additional 16 weeks and response rates 
observed during retreatment were similar to the previous double-blind period: PASI 75 response of 
78.9% (15 of 19 subjects) and PGA clear or minimal of 52.6% (10 of 19 subjects). 
In the open label period of the study, PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal responses were maintained for up 
to an additional 52 weeks with no new safety findings. 
The second primary endpoint, the response at Week 16 of PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal), did not reach 
statistical significance. However, a tendency for clinical efficacy was demonstrated also in this endpoint. 
Taken together, a fairly convincing efficacy of adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg has been demonstrated in children 
and adolescents. 
The CHMP also noted that no subjects at the proposed lower age limit for treatment, between 4-6 years, 
have been exposed to the dose proposed for marketing since they were randomised to adalimumab 0.4 
mg/kg. However, considering both the PK and safety profile of adalimumab, the 4 years of age as lower 
age limit for treatment of children with chronic plaque psoriasis is accepted by the CHMP. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety of adalimumab in subjects with paediatric psoriasis was determined using data from one Phase 
3 clinical trial. Study M04-717 is a randomized, 4-period, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter, 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/177541/2015  
Page 32/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clinical trial conducted in pediatric subjects from 4 through 17 years of age with severe chronic plaque 
psoriasis. 
The data presented is from all subjects that completed Period C, and all data accumulated in Period D up 
to the cut-off data of 02 December 2013. 
AEs representing identified and potential risks of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapy are of 
special interest and were examined separately by category.

Patient exposure 
A total of 114 subjects from 4 through 17 years of age who were diagnosed with chronic plaque psoriasis 
and whose disease was considered severe on the basis of enrolment criteria were enrolled in the study. In 
Period A, these subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to either adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg, adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg 
or MTX.  
The duration of treatments can be seen in the tables below.

In Period A, 84 of 114 subjects (73.7%) reported at least 1 AE (Table 15). The incidence of AEs was 
similar across all treatment groups. The incidence of AEs at least possibly related to adalimumab was 
33.8% for subjects randomized to adalimumab (similar incidence between both dose groups) and 27.0% 
for subjects randomized to MTX.

Overall, 104 of 114 subjects (91.2%) reported at least 1 AE during the study (Table 16). The incidence of 
AEs was similar across all treatment groups. The incidence of AEs considered by the investigator to be at 
least possibly related to adalimumab was 42.9% among subjects in the adalimumab groups, and 40.5% 
among subjects randomized to MTX.

Common adverse events 
Period A 
Adverse events occurring in at least 5% of subjects in any treatment group can be seen in Table 17. 
Eighty-four of 114 subjects (73.7%) reported at least 1 AE in Period A. The most frequently reported 
events were in the Infections and Infestations SOC, reported by 60 of 114 subjects (52.6%). Upper 
respiratory tract infections occurred in 7.8% of subjects randomized to adalimumab (10.3% of subjects 
randomized to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg, and 5.3% of subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg) and 
16.2% of subjects randomized to MTX. Rhinitis was reported in 5.2% of subjects randomized to 
adalimumab (2.6% of subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg and 7.9% of subjects randomized 
to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg) and 2.7% of subjects randomized to MTX. Two events of herpes zoster were 
reported by subjects randomized to adalimumab (1 event in each dose group). 
Events in the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC were more frequently reported among MTX subjects than 
adalimumab subjects (24.3% versus 18.2%, respectively). The most commonly reported gastrointestinal 
events were nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and abdominal pain upper, which are events commonly 
associated with MTX.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
There was one death reported during the study. A 17-year-old white male randomized to adalimumab 0.8 
mg/kg died from an accidental fall. The fall occurred 11 days after the last dose in Period D, but before the 
last scheduled Period D visit. The event was assessed by the investigator as not related to study drug. 
Other serious adverse event 
Seven of 114 subjects (6.1%) reported 8 treatment-emergent SAEs, and 1 subject reported a 
non-treatment-emergent SAE. A listing of all treatment-emergent SAEs is presented in Table 21.

Adverse events of special interest 
Infections 
Infectious AEs were reported in a total of 74.6% of subjects overall. 29 subjects (25.4%) experienced 
infectious AEs of special interest which were assessed by the investigator as possibly or probably related 
to study drug. These were respiratory infections (13 subjects [11.4%] with nasopharyngitis, 10 subjects 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/177541/2015  
Page 41/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[8.8%] with upper respiratory tract infections, 3 subjects [2.6%] each with bronchitis and herpes zoster, 
and 1 subject each with viral upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, pharyngitis streptococcal, 
rhinitis, and tonsillitis). 
Tuberculosis 
Two subjects tested positive for TB conversion, both during Period D. 
•  One subject who was randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, reported an AE of tuberculin test 
positive on Day 270 of Period D that was considered by the investigator to be probably related to 
adalimumab. The subject's baseline TB PPD skin test was negative and there were no signs of TB 
at screening. Adalimumab was interrupted and the subject treated with oral isoniazid 100 mg QD.  
The event was ongoing after 83 days. 
•  One subject who was randomized to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg, tested positive for TB on Day 225 of 
Period D. Mild latent TB was reported as an AE, which was considered by the investigator to be 
possibly related to adalimumab. The subject's baseline TB PPD test was negative and there were 
no signs of TB at screening. The subject was treated with oral isoniazide 100 mg QD. The event 
was ongoing after 142 days.  
Parasitic infections 
One subject had a parasitic infestation (lice) assessed as not related to study drug. 
Herpes Zoster 
In addition to two subjects (1 each in the 0.4 mg/kg and 0.8 mg/kg adalimumab groups) with herpes 
zoster in Period A, one additional subject had a possibly drug-related herpes zoster infection while 
receiving adalimumab in Period D.   
Allergic reactions 
Allergic reactions were reported for 7 subjects. There were 4 events of urticaria (1 subject receiving MTX 
in Period A, 2 subjects receiving adalimumab in Period A or D, and 1 subject 3 days after the last 
adalimumab treatment in Period D). There were 2 events of pruritus generalized (both receiving 
adalimumab in Period C or D), and 1 event of dyspnea (subject receiving MTX in Period A). One event of 
severe urticaria in a subject randomized to MTX, but receiving adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg in Period C, led to 
discontinuation of adalimumab and discontinuation from the study.   
One event of pruritus and 1 event of urticaria were assessed by the investigator as probably related to 
adalimumab. All of the events resolved with the exception of one case of pruritus, which was ongoing 
after 25 days. 
Haematological disorders 
Two subjects reported 3 haematological AEs, while receiving adalimumab.  
•  A subject initially randomized to MTX, but receiving adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, reported an event of 
mild leukopenia on Day 2 of Period C that lasted 6 days. The event was considered by the 
investigator to be possibly related to study drug. The subject had several events of upper 
respiratory tract infection during Period A and Period B that may have contributed to the low WBC 
counts. On Day 1 of Period D, the subject also reported an event of mild neutropenia that lasted 
107 days.  The event was considered by the investigator to be possibly related to adalimumab. 
•  A Subject randomized to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg had an event of mild leukopenia on Day 30. The 
event was assessed by the investigator as probably not related to adalimumab.   
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/177541/2015  
Page 42/58 
 
 
 
 
Injection site reactions 
Fourteen of 114 subjects (12.3%) on study M04-717 reported events of injection site reactions. Ten 
subjects randomized to adalimumab (4 subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg and 6 subjects 
randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg) and 4 subjects randomized to MTX reported a total of 20 injection 
site reaction-related AEs, including 7 injection site reactions, 9 events of injection site pain, and 1 event 
each of pruritus, rash, swelling, and hematoma. Almost all injection site AEs were assessed by the 
investigator as possibly or probably related to adalimumab and not related to MTX. The majority of 
injection sites AEs were mild and most resolved without treatment. The only severe injection site-related 
event (injection site pain) was reported in Period A by a subject randomized to MTX, but receiving placebo 
injection. 
Worsening and new onset of psoriasis 
Eleven subjects (5 subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg and 3 subjects each randomized to 
adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg or MTX) reported 12 events of worsening or new onset of psoriasis. Three events 
were reported during Period A, 1 event during Period B, 4 events during Period D, and 4 events during the 
post-treatment period following Period D. The majority of these events were mild to moderate in severity 
and 2 events were considered to be severe. These severe events were reported by subjects randomized 
to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg (1 event occurred in Period A and 1 event in the post-treatment period 
following Period D). All of these events were due to a worsening of psoriasis, with the exception of 1 
subject who had a new onset of the psoriasis variant, psoriasis inversa, which occurred during treatment 
withdrawal in Period B.   
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
In Period A, analysis of mean changes in haematology values from baseline to final visit showed a few 
statistically significant pairwise differences between treatment groups. The differences were by the MAH 
not considered clinically meaningful. 
Clinical chemistry 
Analysis of mean changes in chemistry values from baseline to final visit also showed few statistically 
significant pairwise differences between treatment groups. These differences were not considered 
clinically meaningful. In Period A and overall, no subjects randomized to adalimumab experienced shifts 
in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, or total 
bilirubin from normal or low at baseline to high (≥ 1.5 × the upper limit of normal [ULN]) at final. One 
subject had shifts in ALT and AST from normal at baseline to ≥  1.5 – <3 × ULN at final visit. This subject 
was randomized to MTX and entered Period D directly from Period A. 
Liver function tests were examined for clinical significance according to the following criteria:  ≥ 2.5 × 
ULN for ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase and ≥ 1.5 × ULN for total bilirubin: 
•  A subject randomized to MTX, had 3 occurrences of ALT elevation. On Day 1 and Day 113 of 
Period D, during which the subject was receiving adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, ALT values increased to 
68 U/L and 49 U/L, respectively (ULN = 48 U/L). On Day 5 of the post-treatment period following 
Period D, the subject's ALT value was further increased to 146 U/L and the AST value was 
elevated to 68 U/L (ULN = 42 U/L). An AE of hepatic enzyme increased was reported on 
Post-treatment Day 5 and assessed by the investigator as possibly related to adalimumab. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/177541/2015  
Page 43/58 
 
 
 
 
 
Post-study follow-up visits were planned, but no further information on results of retesting is 
available. 
•  A subject randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, had an elevated ALT value of 174 U/L (ULN = 48 
U/L) and an elevated AST value of 121 U/L (ULN = 42 U/L) on Day 106 of Period D. The total 
bilirubin value was normal on that day and the subject was asymptomatic. Both tests were within 
the normal range by Day 14 of the post-treatment period following Period D. 
•  A subject randomized to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg, had total bilirubin values ≥ 1.5 × ULN at all 
study visits from Pretreatment Day – 27 through Day 28 of Period D. The highest total bilirubin 
value was reported on Day 1 of Period D when the total bilirubin value was 50 µmol/L (ULN = 22 
µmol/L). 
Urinalysis 
There were no statistically significant between-group differences in mean changes from baseline to final 
visit in continuous urinalysis values (pH and specific gravity). 
Safety in special populations 
The use of adalimumab during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended. No change in the Humira 
prescribing information is recommended at this time. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No AEs led to discontinuation from the study during Period A or Period B. One subject, who was initially 
randomized to MTX, but received adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg in Period C, reported an event of severe 
urticaria that led to discontinuation from treatment. 
• 
The subject randomized to MTX, but receiving adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg in Period C, reported a 
severe event of urticaria on Day 209 that was assessed by the investigator as probably related to 
adalimumab. The subject was discontinued from study drug and from the study and was treated 
with a single application twice a-day (BID) of betamethasone valerate for 7 days. The event was 
considered resolved on Day 213. 
In Period D, 1 subject randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg died from an accidental fall that occurred 11 
days after the last dose, assessed by the investigator as not related to study drug. One subject 
randomized to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg and concurrently receiving adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg had an AE of 
moderate flare of Ps that led to discontinuation from adalimumab. 
• 
The subject randomized to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg, reported an event of moderate Ps flare are on 
Day 57 of Period D that was assessed by the investigator as not related to study drug. The subject 
was discontinued from adalimumab and from the study and was treated with a single application 
once-a-day (QD) of topical betamethasone with calcipotriol and betamethasone + salicylic acid. 
The event was ongoing as of Day 223.  No further information was provided. 
Post marketing experience 
Adalimumab was first approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis on 31 December 2002. As of 31 
December 2013, adalimumab has been evaluated in 42,568 subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, pediatric enthesitis related arthritis, PsA, Crohn's disease, pediatric CD, Psoriasis, 
pediatric Ps, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, spondyloarthritis, non-radiographic axial SpA, 
hidradenitis suppurativa, uveitis, and intestinal Behçet's disease. The estimated cumulative 
postmarketing patient exposure since the IBD through 31 December 2013 is 2.9 million PYs and for 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis and Crohn's disease patients <18 years of age since the IBD through 31

December 2013 is 38,421 PYs worldwide. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of adalimumab in subjects with paediatric psoriasis was determined using data from study 
M04-717, a randomized, 4-period, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter, clinical trial. The data 
presented are from the end of the first 16-week treatment period (Period A) and from the entire study 
(Period A to Period D). The duration of treatment overall to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg was 348 days and to 
adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg 412 days.  
During Period A, the incidence of adverse events was approximately 35% in subjects dosed with either 
dose of adalimumab or MTX. In the study overall (Period B to Period D), the incidence of AEs was also 
similar across all treatment groups. The incidence of AEs considered by the investigator to be at least 
possibly related to adalimumab was 42.9% among subjects in the adalimumab groups, and 40.5% 
among subjects randomized to MTX. 
The most frequently reported adverse events in Period A were in the Infections and Infestations SOC. 
Upper respiratory tract infections occurred in 7.8% of subjects randomized to adalimumab (10.3% in 
subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg, and 5.3% in subjects randomized to adalimumab 0.8 
mg/kg) and in 16.2% of subjects randomized to MTX. Rhinitis was reported in 5.2% of subjects 
randomized to adalimumab (2.6% adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg and 7.9% adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg) and 2.7% 
of subjects randomized to MTX. Occasionally, there is more adverse event noted among subjects treated 
with 0.4 mg/kg adalimumab compared to 0.8 mg/kg, which is assessed as a chance finding. 0.8 mg/kg of 
adalimumab is the dose proposed for use in paediatric psoriasis patients. 
Adverse events in the gastrointestinal tract were more frequently reported among MTX subjects than 
adalimumab subjects (24.3% versus 18.2%, respectively). The most commonly reported gastrointestinal 
events were nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and abdominal pain upper, which are adverse events 
commonly associated with MTX. 
In the study overall (Period A-Period D), the incidence of adverse events was similar among the treatment 
groups, with infections as the most frequently seen adverse event. Among the adverse events reported in 
more than one subject in any treatment group and by the investigator assessed as possibly or probably 
related to study drug, infections, injections site pain and injections site reactions, nausea and headache 
dominated in the overall safety data set.  
One death occurred during the study, a 17-year-old white male randomized to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg, 
who died from an accidental fall. The death was by the investigator assessed as not related to study drug, 
an opinion which is endorsed by the CHMP. All treatment-emergent SAEs (hand fracture tendon injury, 
fall, haemorrhagic ovarian cyst, GI infection, chest pain, rash, agitation) were assessed by the 
investigator as not related or probably not related to study drug. No malignancies were detected during 
the study. 
Adverse events of special interest followed during the study were infections, tuberculosis, parasitic 
infections, herpes zoster, allergic reactions, haematological disorders, injections site reactions, and 
worsening and new onset of psoriasis. Three subjects had herpes zoster, assessed as a fairly large 
number. The MAH has presented the incidences of herpes zoster in paediatric clinical trials overall 
including the paediatric psoriasis study. The event rate was slightly higher in the pediatric psoriasis study. 
It is however acknowledged that the number of events is small (n=3) and a few subjects have so far been 
exposed, compared to larger clinical trials in other indication. The overall rate of herpes zoster infection 
in paediatric subjects (2.7% – 3.1%) is was considered by the CHMP consistent with the current 
adalimumab label of ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/177541/2015  
Page 45/58 
 
 
 
 
Respiratory infections with nasopharyngitis were the most common observed infection during the study. 
Two subjects tested positive for TB conversion and one subject had a parasitic infection assessed as not 
related to study drug. Three subjects had herpes zoster and allergic reactions (urticarial and pruritus) 
were reported for 7 subjects. Two subjects reported three haematological adverse events (mild 
leukopenia and mild neutropenia). Injection site AEs were observed in 12% of subjects in the study 
M04-717. The majority were mild and most resolved without treatment. Eleven subjects reported 
worsening of new onset of psoriasis; three events were reported during Period A, one event during Period 
B, four events during Period D, and four events during the post-treatment period following Period D.  
Occasional elevations of ALT were noted during the study. Elevated liver enzymes are included as a very 
common adverse event in the product information, and are not considered a cause for concern by the 
CHMP. 
One significant adverse event that led to study discontinuation was severe urticarial in a 10-years old 
white male receiving adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg in Period C, assessed by the investigator as probably related 
to adalimumab. This opinion is endorsed by the CHMP. 
In Period D, 13-year-old white male got a moderate flare of psoriasis, which could be related to 
treatment, although assessed by the MAH as not related. This opinion is endorsed by the CHMP. 
The safety of Humira was overall similar in the paediatric population compared to the adult population. 
During the procedure the MAH has addressed the safety of Humira in patients 4 to 17 years of age with 
polyarticular JIA and patients 2 to <4 years of age with polyarticular JIA. The safety of adalimumab was 
comparable despite the differences in the age groups receiving treatment. The view of the MAH that the 
safety profile in younger children with plaque psoriasis (lower age limit of 4 years) would be consistent 
with the safety profile in younger patients with polyarticular JIA is endorsed. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new safety concerns have emerged in the present study performed in paediatric patients with 
psoriasis. The adverse events noted have been seen in adult patients with psoriasis and in clinical trials 
with Humira in other paediatric indications.  
Based on the data provided by the MAH the CHMP concluded that safety profile in younger children with 
plaque psoriasis (lower age limit of 4 years) would be consistent with the safety profile in younger 
patients with polyarticular JIA and therefore that the proposed lower age limit for treatment, between 4-6 
years has been justified. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 11.2 could be acceptable if the applicant 
implemented the changes to the RMP as described in the PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment 
report. The applicant implemented the changes in the RMP as requested by PRAC.  
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 11.2.1 with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated 
(addition, deletion). The package leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Section 4.1 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Humira is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and 
adolescents from 4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate 
candidates for topical therapy and phototherapies.

Section 4.2 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
The recommended Humira dose is 0.8 mg per kg body weight (up to a maximum of 40 mg per 
dose) administered subcutaneously weekly for the first two doses and every other week 
thereafter.  Continued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully considered in a patient 
not responding within this time period. 
If retreatment with Humira is indicated, the above guidance on dose and treatment duration 
should be followed. 
The safety of Humira in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis has been assessed for a 
mean of 13 months. 
There is no relevant use of Humira in children aged less than 4 years in this indication. 
The volume for injection is selected based on the patients' weight (Table 2).

Method of administration 
Humira is administered by subcutaneous injection. Full instructions for use are provided in the package 
leaflet. 
A 40 mg pen and a 40 mg prefilled syringe are also available for patients to administer a full 
40 mg dose. 
Section 4.8 
Humira was studied in 8,198 8,308 patients in pivotal controlled and open label trials for up to 60 months 
or more.  These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing disease, 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis) as 
well as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic 
evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and psoriasis patients. The pivotal 
controlled studies involved 5,343 5,420 patients receiving Humira and 3,148 3,185 patients receiving 
placebo or active comparator during the controlled period. 
The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, 
controlled portion of pivotal studies was 6.01% for patients taking Humira and 5.7% for control treated 
patients 
Injection site reactions   
In the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, 13.56% of patients treated with Humira developed 
injection site reactions …

Infections  
In the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.512 per patient year in the 
Humira treated patients and 1.445 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated patients.  
Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders 
No malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient years during 
Humira trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and 
enthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 paediatric patients with an 
exposure of 258.9 patient years during a Humira trial in paediatric patients with Crohn’s disease. No 
malignancies were observed in 77 paediatric patients with an exposure of 80.0 patient years 
during a Humira trial in paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. 
Hepato-biliary events 
In controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with  plaque Psoriasis with a control period duration 
ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of Humira-treated patients and 
1.8% of control-treated patients.  
No ALT elevations ≥3 X ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of Humira in paediatric patients with 
plaque psoriasis. 
Section 5.1 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis  
The efficacy of Humira was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, controlled study of 114 
paediatric patients from 4 years of age with severe chronic plaque psoriasis (as defined by a 
PGA ≥ 4 or > 20% BSA involvement or > 10% BSA involvement with very thick lesions or 
PASI ≥ 20 or ≥ 10 with clinically relevant facial, genital, or hand/ foot involvement) who 
were inadequately controlled with topical therapy and heliotherapy or phototherapy.  
Patients received Humira 0.8mg/kg eow (up to 40 mg), 0.4 mg/kg eow (up to 20 mg), or 
methotrexate 0.1 – 0.4 mg/kg weekly (up to 25 mg).   At week 16, more patients randomised 
to Humira 0.8 mg/kg had positive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than those randomised 
to 0.4mg/kg eow or MTX.

Patients who achieved PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal were withdrawn from treatment for 
up to 36 weeks and monitored for loss of disease control (i.e. a worsening of PGA by at least 2

grades).  Patients were then re-treated with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow for an additional 16 
weeks and response rates observed during retreatment were similar to the previous 
double-blind period:  PASI 75 response of 78.9% (15 of 19 subjects) and PGA clear or 
minimal of 52.6% (10 of 19 subjects). 
In the open label period of the study, PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal responses were 
maintained for up to an additional 52 weeks with no new safety findings. 
Section 5.2 
Following the administration of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously 
every other week to paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, the mean ± SD 
steady-state adalimumab trough concentration was approximately 7.4 ± 5.8 µg/mL (79% 
CV). 
2.8.  Significance of paediatric studies 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the paediatric clinical studies (M04-717, DE038, M06-806, M10-444 and 
M11-328) of adalimumab which are contained in the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0324/2013 
and completed after 26 January 2007 are significant. The assessment criteria for significance of studies as 
defined in Section III, Title 4.2 of the Europe Commission Communication - Guideline on the format and 
content of applications for agreement or modification of a paediatric investigation plan and requests for 
waivers or deferrals and concerning the operation of the compliance check and on criteria for assessing 
significant studies (2014/C 338/01) has been fulfilled, taking into account the study type of the 
above-mentioned study: 
(1) Comparative efficacy studies (randomized/ active control or placebo): The pivotal study M04-717 is a 
Phase 3, randomized, 4-period, double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre clinical trial conducted in 
paediatric subjects from 4 through 17 years of age with severe chronic plaque psoriasis 
(2) Prospective clinical safety studies: as the pivotal study M04-717 is a randomized, 4-period, 
double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre clinical trial, adverse events (AEs), laboratory data, physical 
examinations, and vital signs were assessed throughout the study. 
Furthermore studies DE038, M06-806, M10-444 and M11-328 provide meaningful pharmacokinetic 
information as per criteria (e) of the above mentioned Guideline which is supporting the claimed 
indication. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The efficacy of adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg seems to be higher than that of adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg and 
methotrexate. Adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg reached statistical significance in one of the primary endpoints 
used; per cent subjects reaching PASI 75. The second primary endpoint, the response at Week 16 of PGA 
0,1 (cleared, minimal), did not reach statistical significance. However, a tendency for clinical efficacy was 
demonstrated also in this endpoint. Taken together, a fairly convincing efficacy of adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/177541/2015  
Page 55/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
has been demonstrated in children and adolescents. The efficacy of adalimumab was similar during a 
retreatment period following a withdrawal phase, and was also maintained during a 52 week period. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
No subjects at the proposed lower age limit for treatment, between 4-6 years, have been exposed to the 
dose proposed for marketing (0.8 mg/kg) since they were randomised to the lower dose of adalimumab 
(0.4 mg/kg). However the data showed that that the PK and exposure of adalimumab are similar between 
subjects 4 to 6 years of age and 6 to 17 years of age when dosed at 0.8 mg/kg. Furthermore, safety in 
polyarticular JIA, approved from 2 years of age demonstrated no additional cause for concern due to 
young age. To conclude, considering both the PK and safety profile of adalimumab, the 4 years of age as 
lower age limit for treatment of children with chronic plaque psoriasis is accepted. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
No new safety concerns have emerged in the present study. The adverse events noted have been seen in 
adult patients with psoriasis, and in clinical trials with adalimumab in other paediatric indications. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Long-term safety data beyond 52 weeks are lacking in the target population. As described in the RMP, 
there are already two ongoing non-interventional studies registries in paediatric Crohn’s disease and 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis, which are considered sufficient to follow the long-term safety in paediatric 
patients treated with adalimumab. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
A fairly convincing efficacy of adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg has been demonstrated in children and adolescents 
with severe plaque psoriasis. 
Considering both the PK and safety profile of adalimumab, the 4 years of age as lower age limit for 
treatment of children with chronic plaque psoriasis is accepted. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The efficacy of Humira was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, controlled study of 114 paediatric 
patients from 4 years of age with severe chronic plaque psoriasis who were inadequately controlled with 
topical therapy and heliotherapy or phototherapy. Patients received Humira 0.8mg/kg eow (up to 40 mg), 
0.4 mg/kg eow (up to 20 mg), or methotrexate 0.1 – 0.4 mg/kg weekly (up to 25 mg). At week 16, more 
patients randomised to Humira 0.8 mg/kg had positive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than those 
randomised to 0.4mg/kg eow or MTX.  
Patients who achieved PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal were withdrawn from treatment for up to 36 
weeks and monitored for loss of disease control (i.e. a worsening of PGA by at least 2 grades). Patients 
were then re-treated with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow for an additional 16 weeks and response rates 
observed during retreatment were similar to the previous double-blind period: PASI 75 response of 
78.9% (15 of 19 subjects) and PGA clear or minimal of 52.6% (10 of 19 subjects). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/177541/2015  
Page 56/58 
 
 
 
 
In the open label period of the study, PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal responses were maintained for up 
to an additional 52 weeks with no new safety findings. 
The second primary endpoint, the response at Week 16 of PGA 0,1 (cleared, minimal), did not reach 
statistical significance. However, a tendency for clinical efficacy was demonstrated also in this endpoint. 
Taken together, a fairly convincing efficacy of adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg has been demonstrated in children 
and adolescents. 
The CHMP also noted that no subjects at the proposed lower age limit for treatment, between 4-6 years, 
have been exposed to the dose proposed for marketing since they were randomised to adalimumab 0.4 
mg/kg. However, considering both the PK and safety profile of adalimumab, the 4 years of age as lower 
age limit for treatment of children with chronic plaque psoriasis is accepted by the CHMP. 
During the procedure, and in order to increase the flexibility of each treatment center to decide on the 
phototherapy treatment, the CHMP requested the MAH to amend the indication as follows: 
“Humira is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from 
4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical 
therapy and phototherapies”. This was agreed by the MAH. 
The benefit-risk balance of adalimumab for the severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and 
adolescents from 4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates 
for topical therapy and phototherapies is considered positive.

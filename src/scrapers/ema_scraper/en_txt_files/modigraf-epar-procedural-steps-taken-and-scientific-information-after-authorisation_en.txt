are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Update of sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 of the SmPC in 
order to add a warning on the adverse reaction 
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) based on a 
cumulative review of fatal cases of TMA during 
treatment with tacrolimus, requested by the PRAC 
following the assessment of the PSUR 
(EMEA/H/C/00002839/202103). 
Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC in order to add 
the drug-drug interaction between tacrolimus and 
caspofungin based on post-marketing safety report 
and literature.  
Update of section 5.2 of the SmPC in order to add 
that tacrolimus is metabolized by the cytochrome 
P450-3A5 (CYP3A5) based on post-marketing safety 
report and literature.  
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) section 4.4 and 4.5 are 
updated to raise awareness about TMA and highlight that 
concomitant use of tacrolimus with mammalian target of 
rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor may increase the risk of 
developing TMA. The frequency of TMA is also updated from 
rare to uncommon in section 4.8. 
Information relating to the potential interaction between 
tacrolimus with caspofungin is included in section 4.5. 
Based on post-marketing safety report and literature, 
section 5.2 is updated to add that tacrolimus is metabolized 
by the cytochrome P450-3A5 (CYP3A5).

Based on the CHMP review of the available information and

the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of Modigraf continues to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considered that the 
benefit risk profile of Modigraf continues to be favourable in 
the prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult and 
paediatric, kidney, liver or heart allograft recipients and in 
the treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment 
with other immunosuppressive medicinal products in adult

Product Information document has been updated to include 
warnings about this possible event.

global safety data for tacrolimus has shown that 
concomitant use of tacrolimus with protein inhibitors or 
amiodarone results in an increase of its levels. The 
mechanism related to this interaction is mainly reported to 
be due to an inhibition of CYP3A4 enzyme which is involved 
in the metabolism of tacrolimus and is inhibited by either 
the protease inhibitors or amiodarone. Therefore, the 
current warning related to the use of tacrolimus together 
with drugs capable of reducing CYP3A4 activity is amended. 
These drugs include in particular protease inhibitors for HIV 
and HCV and amiodarone.

to appropriately reflect the post-marketing experience with 
systemic tacrolimus in exposed pregnancies. Pregnancy-
related cases remain under close monitoring and will be 
reported and discussed in the PSURs. 
Review of the available data in the safety database of the 
MAH concluded that cases of agranulocytosis and 
haemolytic anaemia have been reported in association with 
use of tacrolimus. Regarding agranulocytosis, 36 cases 
were identified as of October 2010, of which four and 17 
were classified as ‘Index’ and ‘Informative’, respectively. 
The reported index and informative cases suggest a 
causative relationship between administration of systemic 
tacrolimus and agranulocytosis. Regarding haemolytic 
anaemia, 67 cases were identified as of October 2010, of 
which one and 21 cases were classified as ‘Index’ and 
‘Informative’, respectively. Based on these cases a possible 
causative relationship between administration of systemic 
tacrolimus and haemolytic anaemia is suggested. The two 
identified adverse reactions were included in the SmPC and 
the PIL and the benefit-risk balance of the product remains 
positive.

The MAH provided the Signal Evaluation Report for Pure 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC regarding 
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA). The PIL is updated 
Red Cell Aplasia for Prograf (systemic tacrolimus). While 
the number of cases are limited, and many of the 27 
reported "informative cases" of PRCA are confounded by 
factors such as co-administration of other medication, 
evidence of parvovirus B19 infection or the presence or

accordingly. Furthermore, the MAH took the 
opportunity to update the list of local representatives 
in section 6 of the PIL. 
This application was submitted for a group of 
variations consisting of a Type II variation following a 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
history of thymoma/myasthenia gravis, the available data 
strongly suggests a causative association between 
exposure to tacrolimus and the development of PRCA. 
Therefore, a warning statement has been included in the 
SmPC of all three systemic tacrolimus products (Advagraf, 
Modigraf, Prograf) and the PRCA has been added as an 
adverse reaction in the section "Undesirable effects".

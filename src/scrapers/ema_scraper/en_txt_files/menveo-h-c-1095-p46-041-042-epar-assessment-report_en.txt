1.  Introduction 
On 27 March 2019, the MAH submitted 2 completed paediatric studies for Menveo, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
Menveo is indicated for active immunization of children (from 2 years of age), adolescents and adults 
at risk of exposure to Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W135 and Y, to prevent invasive disease. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
Menveo should be administered as a single dose (0.5 ml). To ensure optimal antibody levels against all 
vaccine  serogroups,  the  primary  vaccination  schedule  with  Menveo  should  be  completed  one  month 
prior to risk of exposure to Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W135 and Y. 
In the parent study V102_16 Menveo was used as a comparator vaccine.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development programme 
The MAH stated that the phase 2, open-label, controlled, multi-centre study (V102_16) and the 
extension (V102_16E1) to assess the effectiveness, immunogenicity and safety of the MenABCWY 
vaccine compared to a single dose of MenACWY, is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
MenABCWY is a combination vaccine containing MenACWY conjugated to a carrier protein cross 
reactive material (CRM197) combined with recombinant MenB with outer member vesicle (OMV) from 
the New Zealand (NZ) strain. Novartis MenABCWY vaccine is prepared immediately before injection by 
extemporaneous mixing of a fully lyophilized formulation of MenACWY with 1 dose of liquid 
rMenB+OMV vaccine for a total injection volume of 0.5 ml.  
Novartis MenACWY conjugate vaccine was obtained by extemporaneous mixing a lyophilized MenA-
CRM197 conjugate component with a liquid MenCWY-CRM197 conjugate component. After 
reconstitution, the total volume of injection was 0.5 ml. The placebo consisted a saline solution (NaCl 
0.9%; lot number: IF12361035), the total injection volume was 0.5 ml. 
Vaccines were to be administered IM, preferably in the deltoid area of nondominant arm. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted final reports for:

administered to healthy adolescents in the US.  
2.3.2.  Clinical studies 
Studies V102_16 & V102_16E1 
Description 
The V102_16 study evaluated the effectiveness of 2 doses of Meningococcal Serogroups A, B, C, W, 
and Y (MenABCWY) vaccine in adolescents by measuring the bactericidal serum activity against a large 
panel of epidemiologically relevant invasive disease strains of Neisseria meningitidis (N meningitidis) 
serogroup B (110 strains overall) using an endogenous complement human serum bactericidal assay 
(enc-hSBA), when compared to a single dose of Meningococcal Serogroups A, C, W, and Y (MenACWY) 
vaccine. The analysis of MenABCWY vaccine effectiveness was performed at 1 month and 4 months 
after completion of the 2-dose vaccination series to assess short term persistence of bactericidal 
antibodies.  
In the extension of study V102_16 immunogenicity data were collected after a third vaccination with 
meningococcal ABCWY vaccine 6 months after the first vaccination (i.e. subjects were vaccinated at 0, 
2, 6 month). Subjects were followed for about 44 months after the last vaccination. Again safety and 
efficacy was compared to a single dose of meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y vaccine (Menveo). 
Methods 
Objectives 
Assessor’s comment 
Note that only the objectives which relate to measuring the response against MenACWY of both study 
V102_16 and study V102_16E1 are mentioned. The response against the serogroups B strains is not 
mentioned as this is of no relevance for Menveo . 
Secondary objectives (relevant for MenACWY) 
Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives: 
To assess the immunogenicity of MenABCWY vaccine against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y 
as measured by HT-hSBA GMTs, the percentages of subjects with HT-hSBA titers ≥ LLQ and the 
percentages of subjects with 2-, 3- and 4-fold hSBA titer rise at 1 and 4 months after the 2-dose 
vaccination series, when compared to a single dose of MenACWY (study V102_16). 
• To assess the immunogenicity of MenABCWY vaccine against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and 
Y as measured by hSBA GMTs, the percentages of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ LLQ and the percentages 
of subjects with 2-, 3- and 4-fold rise in hSBA titer at 1 and 4 months after the 3-dose vaccination 
series, when compared to a single dose of MenACWY (study V102_16E1). 
Assessor’s comment 
In the present procedure the focus will be on Menveo. Therefore, results for the objectives described in 
the CSR in which the response against serogroup B is measured will not be discussed in this report.

Only the objectives which concerns the response to or persistence after receiving MenACWY for 
serogroups A, C, W and Y will be discussed.  
Note that a high throughput assay was used with different cut offs (LLOQ/LOD) as compared to 
previous assays employed in the clinicial development of Menveo. Direct comparisons of immune 
responses between the present study and older studies should be avoided or at least interpreted with 
caution.

a For subjects who were to be enrolled in the extension study, visit Month 6 of the parent study was the first study 
visit of the extension study. All consecutive study visits were numbered accordingly. In the event of a transient 
clinical circumstance which may warrant delay of extension study vaccination, the first day of the extension study 
could be postponed, but was to occur within a maximum of 14 days from Visit Month 6 of the parent study.

Study population /Sample size 
V120_16 
The study included healthy male and female adolescents who, at the time of enrolment into V102_16 
trial, were 10 through 18 years of age. Subjects were in good health as determined by the outcome of 
medical history, physical examination and clinical judgment of the investigator. Subjects with a history 
of any meningococcal vaccine administration, current or previous, confirmed or suspected disease 
caused by N meningitidis or household contact with and/or intimate exposure to an individual with any 
laboratory confirmed N meningitidis infection within 60 days of enrolment, were excluded. 
MenABCWY group: Approximately 150 subjects were planned to receive MenABCWY vaccine at visit 
day 1 and visit month 2;  
MenACWY group: Approximately 150 subjects were planned to receive 1 dose of placebo at visit day 1 
and 1 dose of MenACWY vaccine at visit month 2. 
V120_16E1: All subjects who completed parent study and received the protocol-specified study 
vaccines were to be invited to participate in the extension study (V102_16E1).  
Treatments 
In study V102_16 subjects in the MenABCWY group received 2 doses of MenABCWY vaccine at day 1 
and month 2 whereas subjects in the MenACWY group received 1 dose of placebo at day 1 and 1 dose 
of MenACWY vaccine at month 2. In the extension (V102_16E1) (i.e. six months after the first injection 
in study V102_16) subjects received either a third vaccination with MenABCWY (MenABCWY group) or 
a placebo (MenACWY group). 
Assessor’s comments 
Healthy subjects aged 10 to 18 years old either received MenABCWY vaccine at visit day 1, visit month 
2 and (in V102_16E1) after 6 months or dose of placebo at visit day 1, 1 dose of MenACWY vaccine at 
visit month 2 and a placebo again at the start of study V102_16E1 (6 months after the first placebo 
vaccination). Subjects were naïve for meningococcal vaccine and did not experience caused by N 
meningitides.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Assessor’s comment: 
Note that below only endpoints relevant for evaluating the response to MenACWY are listed. 
Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints study V102_16: 
•  HT-hSBA GMTs against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y at baseline, 1 and 4 months 
after the 2-dose vaccination series. 
• 
• 
Percentages of subjects with HT-hSBA titers ≥ LLQ against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W 
and Y at baseline, 1 and 4 months after the 2-dose vaccination series. 
Percentages of subjects with 2-, 3-, and 4-fold rise in HT-hSBA titer against N meningitidis 
serogroups A, C, W and Y at 1 and 4 months after the 2-dose vaccination series. 
Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints V102_16E1: 
•  hSBA GMTs against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y at 1 and 4 months after the 3-
dose vaccination series.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/415957/2019  
Page 6/22 
 
 
 
•  Percentages of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ LLQ against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y 
at 1 and 4 months after the 3-dose vaccination series. 
•  Percentages of subjects with 2-, 3-, and 4-fold rise in hSBA titer against N meningitidis 
serogroups A, C, W and Y at 1 and 4 months after the 3-dose vaccination series. 
Secondary Safety Endpoints 
Safety of the study vaccines were to be assessed in all subjects in terms of the frequency and 
percentage of reported AEs including: 
•  Any unsolicited and solicited AEs reported within 30 min after each vaccination;  
•  Solicited local (i.e., pain, erythema and induration) and systemic (ie, loss of appetite, 
headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, fever (body temperature ≥ 38°C [100.4°F]). 
AEs reported from day 1 (6 h) through day 7 after each vaccination; 
•  All unsolicited AEs reported from day 1 to day 30 after each vaccination; 
•  Medically attended AEs reported during the entire study period; 
•  AEs leading to premature withdrawal from the study during the entire study period; 
•  SAEs reported during the entire study period. 
Statistical Methods 
Considering that the acceptable volume of blood sample in adolescents aged 10 through 18 years is 20 
ml, approximately 33 (range 25-40) endemic US N meningitidis serogroup B strains from the strain 
panel and the 4 serogroup B test strains (one test strain per antigen, fHbp, NHBA, NadA and Por A 
P1.4) were to be  tested per subject using enc-hSBA. In addition, 8 test strains (4 serogroup B test 
strains and 1 each for serogroups A, C, W and Y) could be tested using HT-hSBA in each subject. 
Assuming 150 enrolled subjects per group and a dropout rate of 20%, approximately 120 subjects 
were to be evaluated for the vaccine effectiveness (VE) analysis.  
Considering the total number of endemic US N meningitidis serogroup B invasive strains in the selected 
panel (n = 110) and the expected number of strains tested in each subject (n = 33, range 25-40), 
each strain was to be tested in approximately 36 (range 27-44) subjects. 
For each strain, VE was to be calculated as VE = 1− [percentage of subjects without bactericidal serum 
activity at 1:4 dilution using enc-hSBA in the MenABCWY group/percentage of subjects without 
bactericidal serum activity at 1:4 dilution in the MenACWY group] x 100. 
For the overall panel of the US N meningitidis serogroup B invasive isolates (the primary objective of 
the study), the VE and associated 95% confidence interval (CI) were to be computed as the average 
for VE of the 110 US N meningitidis serogroup B strains tested in this study. 
If the lower limit of the 95% CI for VE against the panel of the endemic US N meningitidis serogroup B 
strains between the MenABCWY group and the MenACWY group is above 10% the null hypothesis was 
to be rejected and effectiveness declared. 
Statistical method for the primary endpoint was the generalized linear model using individual strain 
Bernoulli measure (killed/not killed) as outcome measure with treatment group and strain as 
independent variables.

Results of the Geometric Mean HT-hSBA Titers after the 3rd dose MenABCWY were not reported, only 
after the second dose. As this information is less relevant for the Menveo control arm this information 
is not requested in this art 46 procedure.  
At baseline both treatment arms are comparable with respect to Geometric Mean HT-hSBA Titers as 
can be concluded form the vaccine comparison of the Geometric Mean HT-hSBA Titers ratios that vary 
from 0.77 to 1.0 for the various serogroups.  
The Geometric Mean HT-hSBA Titers one month after the Menveo vaccination are also largely 
comparable with those mentioned in the initial EPAR for patient with baseline hSBA titre ≥1:4. This 
confirms the known immunologic effects of Menveo.  
Percentages of subjects with HT-hSBA titers ≥ LLQ against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W 
and Y 
At baseline, the percentages of subjects with HT-hSBA titers ≥ LLQ against N meningitidis serogroups 
were: A (2% and 1%), C (32% and 43%); W (12% and 16%), and Y (10% and 11%), in MenABCWY 
and MenACWY vaccine groups, respectively

In the MenABCWY group, at 1 month after the second dose (2-dose MenABCWY vaccination series), 
there was increase in the percentages of subjects with HT-hSBA titers ≥ LLQ (90% to 100%) against all 
4 N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y. At 4 months after the second dose, the percentages of 
subjects with persisting HT-hSBA titers ≥ LLQ were between 48% to 98% against all 4 N meningitidis 
serogroups A, C, W, and Y. Overall, the percentage of subjects with HT-hSBA titers ≥ LLQ at 4 months 
after the second dose were lower than the percentages of subjects at 1 month after the second dose, 
but were higher than the baseline (2% to 32%;Table 8). 
In the MenACWY group, at 1 month after a single dose of MenACWY vaccine, there was increase in the 
percentages of subjects with HT-hSBA titers ≥ LLQ (range: 52%-82% across serogroups) against all 4 
N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y. At 4 months after a single dose of MenACWY vaccine, the 
percentages of subjects with persisting HThSBA titers ≥ LLQ were between 32% to 78% against 
serogroups A, C, W, and Y (Table 8).

a For subjects who were enrolled in the extension study, Visit Month 6 of the parent study V102_16 was the first 
study visit of the extension study V102_16E1. All consecutive study visits were numbered accordingly. 
Note: Subjects in the MenABCWY group had received 2 doses of MenABCWY vaccine at day 1 and month 2 in the 
parent study V102_16, and received a single dose of MenABCWY vaccine at month 6 (4 months after the second 
dose) in the extention study V102_16E1. 
Subjects in the MenACWY group had received 1 dose of placebo at day 1 and 1 dose of MenACWY vaccine at month 
2 in the parent study V102_16, and received a single dose of placebo at month 6 in the extention study 
V102_16E1. 
Assessor’s comment 
The percentages of subjects in the MenACWY group with HT-hSBA titers ≥ LLQ against serogroups A, C, 
W, and Y were 1%, 43%, 16%, and 11%, respectively at baseline. The percentages increased at 1 
month after the second dose to 63%, 82%, 52%, and 70%, respectively, and were 32%, 78%, 58%, 
and 63%, respectively at 4 months after the second dose, 1 month after 3-dose series (Month 7) 24%, 
73%, 60%, 57%. At the end of the study 4 months after 3-dose series (Month 10) the percentages of 
subjects in the MenABCWY group with HT-hSBA titers ≥ LLQ against serogroups A, C, W, and Y were 
18%, 69%, 51% and 53%, respectively. 
Given the used high throughput assay the LLQ of all serogroups (A, C, W, and Y) is well above the 
commonly used 1:4 titer. As all HT-hSBA titers are above the 1:4 titer protection against serogroups A, 
C, W, and Y might be assumed for most patients. Results are largely in line with the current knowledge 
about Menveo.

Assessor’s comment 
The percentages of subjects with at least 4-fold rise in HT-hSBA titers, against serogroups A, C, W, and 
Y, at 1 month after the second dose (2-dose MenABCWY vaccination series), were numerically higher 
in the MenABCWY group (A [45%], C [95%], W [50%], and Y [81%]), compared to those in the 
MenACWY group (A [26%], C [54%], W [15%], and Y [47%]), after a single dose of MenACWY 
vaccine.  
The percentages of subjects with at least 4-fold rise in HT-hSBA titers, at 1 month after the 3-dose 
series, against serogroups A, C, W, and Y, were numerically higher in the MenABCWY group (A [53%],

C [49%], W [49%], and Y [28%]), compared to those in the MenACWY group (0%-1%, across 
serogroups), who received a single dose of MenACWY.  
At 4 months after the 3-dose series, the percentages in the MenABCWY group (A [6%], C [21%], W 
[8%], and Y [6%]) were numerically higher compared to those in the MenACWY group (0%-2%, 
across serogroups), who received a single dose of MenACWY. 
Given the three dose vaccination with MenABCWY it is not surprising that a higher immune response 
over time is observed s compared to Menveo. The pattern reported for the Menveo group is in line with 
the known immune response reported in other studies (see EPAR). 
Safety data 
In total 152 subjects in the MenABCWY group and 149 subjects in the MenACWY group were exposed 
to the study vaccinations.

Assessor’s comment 
After study vaccination, the most frequently reported solicited local AE was pain in both the vaccine 
groups, whereas the most frequently reported systemic AE was fatigue in the MenABCWY group and 
headache in the MenACWY group. The most frequently reported solicited local AE after the third 
vaccination was pain in both study groups, while the most frequently reported solicited systemic AE 
was fatigue in both study groups. The majority of the local and systemic AEs were mild to moderate in 
intensity.  
Unsolicited AEs after any vaccination were reported in 33% of subjects in the MenABCWY group and 
37% of subjects in the MenACWY group. Overall, any unsolicited AE was reported by 26% of subjects 
in the MenABCWY group and by 27% of subjects in the MenACWY group during the entire study period 
after third vaccination. 
Only one SAE was reported after the second vaccination in one subject in the MenACWY group and the 
SAE was considered not related to study vaccination as per the investigator.  
There were no AEs leading to withdrawal, SAEs, or deaths reported in the extension study. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This report contains the clinical study reports of V102_16 and V102_16E1. These studies were 
conducted as part of the development program of the investigational meningococcal combination 
vaccine MenABCWY, intended to protect against the five most common Neisseria meningitidis 
serogroups (A, B, C, W and Y). Menveo was given as a comparator vaccine in one control arm in the 
parent study V102_16. The persistence of the immune response was followed in study V102_16E1. 
The study enrolled vaccine naïve subjects aged 10 to 18 years who did not report any disease caused 
by N meningitidis previously.  
As the efficacy results are reported for serogroup B invasive disease isolates only no relevant 
conclusions on the efficacy of Menveo can be made. Therefore, the present P46 AR, only the safety 
analysis of the Menveo arm after vaccination is directly relevant to Menveo.  
In the combined study (V102_16 and V102_16E1) a total 152 subjects in the MenABCWY group and 
149 subjects in the MenACWY group were exposed to the study vaccinations.

No relevant differences can be observed comparing the results of the Geometric Mean HT-hSBA titers 
at baseline with those mentioned in the initial EPAR for patient with baseline hSBA titre ≥1:4. The 
Geometric Mean HT-hSBA Titers one month after the Menveo vaccination are also comparable with 
those mentioned in the initial EPAR for patient with baseline hSBA titre ≥1:4.  
Given the used high throughput assay the LLQ of all serogroups (A, C, W, and Y) is well above the 
commonly used 1:4 titer. As all HT-hSBA titers are above the 1:4 titer protection against serogroups A, 
C, W, and Y might be assumed for most patients. This is in line with the current knowledge about 
Menveo. 
One (1) month after vaccination in the MenACWY group the percentages of subjects with 4-fold rise in 
HT-hSBA titers was 26% for serogroup A, 54% for C, 15% for W, and 47% for Y. At month 10 in the 
MenACWY group the percentages of subjects with 4-fold rise in HT-hSBA titers against the 4 N 
meningitidis serogroups was 0%-1. This is in line with the known immunologic response over time 
where the HT-hSBA titers wane of after about 6 months. 
After study vaccination, the most frequently reported solicited local AE was pain in both the vaccine 
groups, whereas the most frequently reported systemic AE was fatigue in the MenABCWY group and 
headache in the MenACWY group. The most frequently reported solicited local AE after the third 
vaccination was pain in both study groups, while the most frequently reported solicited systemic AE 
was fatigue in both study groups. The majority of the local and systemic AEs were mild to moderate in 
intensity.  
Unsolicited AEs after any vaccination were reported in 33% of subjects in the MenABCWY group and 
37% of subjects in the MenACWY group. Overall, any unsolicited AE was reported by 26% of subjects 
in the MenABCWY group and by 27% of subjects in the MenACWY group during the entire study period 
after third vaccination. 
Only one SAE was reported after the second vaccination in one subject in the MenACWY group and the 
SAE was considered not related to study vaccination as per the investigator.  
There were no AEs leading to withdrawal, SAEs, or deaths reported in the extension study. 
Reported AEs for Menveo were included in the SmPC with comparable frequencies. Therefore no 
further action is necessary.  
3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
Immunogenicity data presented for Menveo are largely in line with the known immunogenicity of 
Menveo, with the caveat that a HT assay was employed in this study. Regarding Menveo safety 
analysis did not reveal unlisted or unexpected adverse events. There were no AEs leading to 
withdrawal, SAEs, or deaths reported in the Menveo arm.  Therefore, the results from the study are 
considered in line with the known clinical characteristics of Menveo. 
The B/R remains positive. No changes to the SmPC are considered necessary.

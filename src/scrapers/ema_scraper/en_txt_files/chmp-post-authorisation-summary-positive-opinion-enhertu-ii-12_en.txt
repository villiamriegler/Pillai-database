The CHMP adopted a new indication for the treatment of gastric cancer. For information, the full

metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received one or more prior anti-HER2-based 
regimens. 
Gastric cancer 
Enhertu as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced 
HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have

Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of risk management plan for VOLIBRIS (ambrisentan)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for VOLIBRIS.  The RMP details 
important risks of VOLIBRIS, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about VOLIBRIS's risks and uncertainties (missing information).
VOLIBRIS's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how VOLIBRIS should be used.
This summary of the RMP for VOLIBRIS should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
VOLIBRIS's RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
VOLIBRIS is authorised for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult and 
paediatric patients aged 8 and over (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains ambrisentan 
as the active substance and it is given by oral route.  
Further information about the evaluation of VOLIBRIS’s benefits can be found in 
VOLIBRIS’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, 
under the medicine’s webpage:
http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/000839/human_me 
d_001151.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further
characterise the risks
Important risks of VOLIBRIS, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed
studies for learning more about VOLIBRIS risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:



Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure
that the medicine is used correctly;

The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In the case of VOLIBRIS, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment - so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary.  These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of VOLIBRIS is not yet available, it is
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of VOLIBRIS are risks that need special risk management activities to further
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken.  Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of VOLIBRIS. Potential risks are concerns for which an
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Clinical Trial and Post-marketing data
Overall, anaemia is twice as prevalent in females as in males. 
This difference is significantly greater during the childbearing 
years. Anaemia of chronic disorders is more common in 
populations with a high incidence of chronic infectious disease 
(e.g., malaria, tuberculosis, acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome Milman, 2011).

Risk factors and risk 
groups
One of the challenges of analyzing reports of liver related events 
in patients with PAH is that this patient population has an 
underlying risk of liver disease. One of the most common causes 
of elevated liver enzymes in pulmonary hypertension patients is 
liver congestion associated with severe pulmonary hypertension 
or right heart failure. In addition to congestive hepatopathy, since 
the liver typically receives 20% of cardiac output, circulatory 
failure, which can occur in PAH patients with decompensated 
heart failure, can be associated with ischemic hepatitis, 
especially if the cardiac index <1.5 liters/min/m2 (Naschitz, 
2000). Hypoxic hepatitis is associated with PaO2 < 45 mmHg 
(which may also occur in severe or end stage PAH patients) and 
results in a high (62%) in-hospital mortality. Hypoxic hepatitis is 
rare and has similar findings to ischemic hepatitis: abrupt, 
marked ALT & AST elevations (10-20 fold normal) which resolve 
rapidly, with centrilobular necrosis on liver biopsy. (Henrion, 
2012).
Additionally, hepatitis in PAH patients may be associated with 
underlying diseases (e.g., autoimmune hepatitis, HIV co-infected 
viral hepatitis, connective tissue disease associated hepatitis and 
existing liver disease resulting in portopulmonary hypertension). 
A review of placebo data in ambrisentan, bosentan and 
sitaxentan clinical studies in PAH patients indicated that elevated 
aminotransferase levels of greater than three times the upper 
limit of normal (ULN) occurred in placebo patients at an 
incidence of between 1.5 and 6% over a 12 to 24 week period 
(Galiè, 2008a; Rubin, 2002; Barst, 2004; Barst, 2006; Oudiz, 
2006; Galiè, 2008b). The background rate of liver dysfunction in 
PAH patients makes it challenging to disentangle a possible 
causal association with ambrisentan from the underlying 
predisposition of PAH patients to experience liver events.
It is not clear whether a history of transaminase elevations prior 
to initiation of ambrisentan constitutes a risk factor for 
hepatotoxicity with ambrisentan. At the of submission for 
marketing authorisation the assessment of liver safety also 
included a cohort of patients who have discontinued other ERAs 
due to elevations in hepatic transaminases previously. Over a 
period of exposure (mean 52.9 weeks, maximum exposure 76

weeks) none of the 36 patients enrolled had LFT abnormalities 
that required permanent discontinuation of ambrisentan. In this 
study the duration of exposure to ambrisentan is considerably 
longer than the median time to discontinuation of bosentan or 
sitaxentan (14 and 29 weeks respectively).

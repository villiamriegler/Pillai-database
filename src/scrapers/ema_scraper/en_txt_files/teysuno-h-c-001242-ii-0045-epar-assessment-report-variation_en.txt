Extension of indication to include treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in adult patients where it is 
not possible to initiate or continue treatment with another fluoropyrimidine. As a consequence, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. Version 10 of the RMP has also been submitted.  
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet 
and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision 
CW/0001/2015 on the granting of a class waiver for the class of pyrimidine- and pyrimidine analogue-
containing medicinal products for treatment of (…) intestinal malignant neoplasms (…). As Teysuno 
falls into this category, the need for a PIP and subsequent paediatric studies is waived. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
This application is for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), a common and lethal disease. 
Claimed therapeutic indication 
Teysuno is indicated in adults as monotherapy or in combination with oxaliplatin or irinotecan, with 
or without bevacizumab, for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer for whom 
it is not possible to continue treatment with another fluoropyrimidine due to hand-foot syndrome 
or cardiovascular toxicity that developed in the adjuvant or metastatic setting. 
Epidemiology  
Based on reports by Globocan colorectal cancer is responsible for 10.2% of all cancers worldwide and 
for 9.2% of the cancer deaths (Globocan 2018). In Europe, it is the second most frequent cancer causing 
13.2% and 12.7% of all cancer cases in men and women, respectively, and a leading cause of death. In 
terms of absolute numbers, in 2012 there were 447,000 new cases of CRC in Europe with 215,000 deaths 
and worldwide 1.4 million new cases were reported with 694,000 deaths. Approximately 25% of patients 
Assessment report

are diagnosed with metastatic disease (van Cutsem et al., Annals of Oncology, 2014; van Cutsem et al., 
Annals of Oncology, 2016; Yoshino et al., Annals of Oncology, 2018). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Colorectal cancer is usually diagnosed after the onset of symptoms, or through screening methods using 
fecal occult blood testing or colonoscopy. Patients can present themselves with symptoms of local growth 
of  the  tumour  within  the  lumen  or  adjacent  structures  leading  to  changes  in  bowel  habits,  bleeding, 
abdominal  or  rectal  pain,  or  iron  deficiency  anaemia.  Patients  can  be  diagnosed  with  more  acute 
symptoms  of  intestinal  obstruction,  peritonitis,  or  acute  bleeding.  Symptomatic  colorectal  cancer  is 
usually associated with a more advanced disease stage and patients can also experience symptoms from 
metastatic disease with the most common metastatic sites being regional lymph nodes, liver, lungs, and 
peritoneum (Macrae et al., Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer, UpToDate, 
2020). When colorectal cancer is suspected, this is confirmed by radiological imaging and histology of 
the primary tumour or metastases. The tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system of the combined 
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) is used to 
stage colorectal cancer (van Cutsem et al., Annals of Oncology, 2014). 
The median overall survival (OS) for patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) is around 30 months with a 
5-year survival rate of 60% (van Cutsem et al., Annals of Oncology, 2016). The reported median OS of 
30 months is based on the results of clinical trials. Population-based studies suggest that the survival 
outside clinical trials is worse with a median OS of approximately 12 months in the total population and 
15 months in patients who received systemic therapy (Hamers et al., International Journal of Cancer, 
2020). 
Management 
Generally,  in  the  metastatic  setting  the  typical  first-line  chemotherapy  for  CRC  contains  a 
fluoropyrimidine  (intravenous  5-FU  or  oral  capecitabine)  used  in  various  combinations  and  schedules 
with irinotecan or oxaliplatin. Biologicals (e.g., anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR antibodies) are also indicated 
for the first-line treatment, unless contraindications exist. Second-line treatment depends on the type 
of prior therapy administered. Antiangiogenic treatment can be started in bevacizumab naïve patients. 
After  first-line  bevacizumab,  aflibercept,  ramucirumab  or  EGFR  antibodies  for patients  with  RAS  wild-
type (BRAF wild-type) tumours are options. According to ESMO guidelines, patients should receive all 
three available cytotoxic agents (fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan) and all targeted treatments 
(anti-VEGF  and,  if  RAS  wild-type,  anti-EGFR)  during  the  course  of  the  treatment  whenever  possible, 
although  the  optimal  sequence  is  not  known.  For  third-line  therapy,  cetuximab  or  panitumumab 
monotherapy  can  be  considered  in  RAS  wild-type  and  BRAF  wild-type  patients  not  previously  treated 
with  EGFR  antibodies.  Alternative  options  are  regorafenib  and  trifluridine/tipiracil  (van  Cutsem  et  al., 
Annals of Oncology, 2016). 
For specific biomarker-defined subgroups the combination of encorafenib and cetuximab is approved in 
patients  with  BRAF  V600E  mutation  who  have  received  prior  systemic  therapy.  The  NTRK-inhibitors 
larotrectinib and entrectinib are approved for patients with NTRK gene fusion positive tumours who have 
no satisfactory treatment options. 
Despite all the new developments, chemotherapy remains the backbone of first-line systemic treatment 
with fluoropyrimidine as basis. As an alternative to intravenous 5-fluorouracil, the oral fluoropyrimidine 
capecitabine  has  been  developed.  Capecitabine  has  been  shown  to  be  non-inferior  compared  to 
intravenous 5-fluorouracil regarding efficacy. The safety profile is different for oral capecitabine versus 
the  intravenous  alternatives,  with  for  example  higher  frequencies  of  hand-foot  syndrome  with 
capecitabine. Hand-foot syndrome is also frequently reported for capecitabine, depending on the regimen

used,  in  22-63%  of  the  patients.  Diarrhoea  is  also frequently  reported  (up to  50%).  Cardiotoxicity  is 
reported at lower frequency (1.2%-5.9%) (EPARs, SmPC Xeloda). There is therefore still a need for the 
development of alternatives of intravenous 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Teysuno is an oral, fixed-dose combination product comprised of tegafur, a fluoropyrimidine prodrug of 
5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and 2 modulators of 5-FU metabolism, gimeracil and oteracil, in a 1:0.4:1 molar 
ratio (tegafur:gimeracil:oteracil). Teysuno has been designed to provide oral delivery of 5-FU, a 
pyrimidine analogue antimetabolite antineoplastic agent, while reducing the rate of degradation of 5-
FU and its conversion in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to its toxic phosphorylated metabolite. As a 5-
FU prodrug, Teysuno exerts its anti-tumour activity by inhibiting DNA and RNA synthesis after uptake 
by cancer cells. 
Teysuno (25 mg/m2 twice per day [b.i.d.] d1-21 of a 28-day cycle), in combination with cisplatin, has 
been approved for use in the European Union (EU) for treatment of advanced gastric cancer since 
2011. 
Of note, oral tegafur has been in use for the treatment of colorectal and other types of cancer for over 
30 years in the EU. Tegafur monotherapy is approved in Spain for the treatment of colorectal cancer, 
gastric cancer, and advanced or recurrent gastrointestinal tumours (including oesophagus and 
pancreas), metastatic carcinoma of the breast, and treatment of advanced head and neck tumours 
(stages III and IV). Tegafur is also approved in Hungary, Latvia, and Lithuania. The combination of 
oral tegafur and uracil (UFT) was approved in the EU in 2000 via the Mutual Recognition Procedure 
under the brand name Uftoral. Uftoral is indicated for first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal 
cancer in combination with calcium folinate. UFT is also approved in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. 
Teysuno formulation 
Teysuno capsules are immediate release solid oral hard gelatin capsules that contain standard 
pharmaceutical excipients. Teysuno capsules in 15-mg and 20-mg strengths are currently used for 
commercialisation in advanced gastric cancer in Europe (Teysuno SmPC). No changes from the 
marketed product have been made to the formulation described in this application. The different 
capsules all use a common blend; the strengths are achieved by adjusting the fill weight of the 
capsules. 
The capsule dosage form used in clinical trials has remained unchanged throughout clinical 
development, and has been produced using the same manufacturing process and at the same scale as 
that proposed for commercialisation. The proposed commercial dosage form is the same as that used 
to generate the phase 3 clinical data. 
Teysuno capsules (or granules/tablets approved in Japan based on bioequivalence to the capsules) 
manufactured by Taiho were used in most of the Japanese and Korean studies (Hong et al., 2012; Kim 
et al., 2014; Yamada et al., 2013; Baba et al., 2017; Yamada et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2015; Yasui et 
al., 2015; Muro et al., 2010). A generic form of Teysuno licensed in Japan in 2013 and also 
manufactured by Taiho (and bioequivalent) was used in three Phase 2 Japanese studies (Iwasa et al., 
2015; Yamazaki et al., 2015; Kato et al., 2012). Three studies conducted in China were unavailable in 
PubMed or other online resources and thus, the formulation of Teysuno used in these studies is 
unknown (Tian et al., J Qihihar Univ Med 2011;32:2580-2; Ning et al., Anhui Med Pharm J 
Assessment report  
EMA/2190/2022 
Page 8/9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2017;21:1669-72; Zong et al., Medicine 2019;98:30 (e16667)). All of the European studies used the 
commercially available capsule formulation of Teysuno manufactured by Taiho (Kwakman et al., 
2017c; Kwakman et al., 2019; Winther et al., 2019; Punt et al., 2021, in preparation; Kwakman et al., 
2017b; Österlund et al., 2021, submitted; Kwakman et al., 2017d; Derksen et al., 2021, in 
preparation). 
Proposed dose 
The proposed dose for monotherapy in mCRC is 30 mg/m2 b.i.d. days 1-14 with a one-week pause (± 
bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg on day 1) (Kwakman et al., 2017, Österlund et al., 2021 (submitted)). For 
combination therapy with oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 day 1) or irinotecan (180 mg/m2 day 1), 25 mg/m2 
b.i.d. d1-14 followed by one-week pause (± bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg on day 1) is recommended 
(Chung et al., 2011, Österlund et al., 2021 (submitted), Punt et al., 2021 (in preparation), Winther et 
al., 2019). In frail, elderly patients (≥70 years of age), the recommended dose is 20 mg/m2 b.i.d. on 
days 1-14 followed by one-week pause, in combination with a reduced dose of oxaliplatin (100 mg/m2 
on day 1 of a 3-week cycle) (Winther et al., 2019). 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH did not seek scientific advice.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The current application for a new indication is based on literature review. According to the MAH, all 
studies conducted during the clinical development programme for Teysuno have been conducted in 
compliance with good clinical practice (GCP) principles. The Japanese studies (Yamada et al., 2013; 
Baba et al., 2017; Yamada et al., 2018; Muro et al., 2010; Yasui et al., 2015) were conducted in 
accordance with Japanese ethical guidelines for clinical studies and the ethical principles in the 
Declaration of Helsinki. The protocols for these studies were approved by the institutional review board 
or ethics committee in each participating institution. Written informed consent was obtained before 
patient enrolment. 
It needs to be noted that the essential documents of the Japanese guidelines are different from those 
of the ICH-GCP. 
The SOX vs. CapeOX study in Korean patients (Hong et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2014) was conducted in 
accordance with Korean GCP, in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki and in keeping with local 
regulations.  
The European studies were all conducted according to GCP guidelines, ethical approval for protocols 
was obtained and all patients submitted informed consent before admission to the trial as required 
(Kwakman et al., 2017c; Kwakman et al., 2019; Chung et al., 2011; Winther et al., 2019; Österlund et 
al., 2021, submitted). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
Environmental Risk Assessment:  
An updated environmental risk assessment has been submitted in this application. 
Phase I:  
Assessment report  
EMA/2190/2022 
Page 9/10 
 
 
 
 
 
Assessment for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity: 
According to the guideline, drug substances with a log Kow >4.5 should be screened for persistence, 
bioaccumulation and toxicity according to the EU Technical Guidance Document (TGD). 
The log Kow values for tegafur, gimeracil and oteracil monopotassium salt are <4.5, as detailed in 
Tables 1.6-2, 1.6-4 and 1.6-6 above. Therefore, an assessment for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and 
Toxicity (PBT) is not necessary. 
Calculations of the Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PEC) for Tegafur, Gimeracil and Oteracil 
Monopotassium Salt: 
In Phase I, the PEC calculation is restricted to the aquatic compartment. The calculation of the PEC in 
surface water further assumes that the predicted amount used per year is evenly distributed over the 
year and throughout the geographic area, the sewage system is the main route of entry, there is no 
biodegradation or retention of the drug substance in the sewage treatment plant (STP) and 
metabolism in the patient is not taken into account. Thus, a PEC is only calculated for the active entity. 
An Fpen default value of 0.01 (1%) is proposed in the guideline. However, if data (reasonably justified 
market penetration data, e.g. based on published epidemiological data) are available to estimate a 
more accurate Fpen, this may be used. As shown in this environmental risk assessment, data are 
available to estimate a more accurate refined Fpen for the use of S-1 15 and 20 mg capsules for the 
treatment of advanced gastric cancer when given in combination with cisplatin or for treatment of 
metastatic colorectal cancer in the EU. These published epidemiological data and treatment regimen 
information have been included below to support Phase I estimation of exposure. 
Using values for tegafur, the refined Fpen is calculated as: 
Fpen is refined based on prevalence data for Europe of the separate indications stomach cancer and 
metastatic colorectal cancer: 
Stomach cancer: 
Fpen is further refined based on treatment regimen: 
Stomach cancer stage III-IV refined by treatment regimen 
21 consecutive days followed by 7 days rest (1 treatment cycle). This treatment cycle is repeated 
Assessment report  
EMA/2190/2022 
Page 10/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
every 4 weeks. 
21 * 13 / 365 = 0.75 
Fpen refined = 0.75 * 0.0000756 = 0.0000567 
Colorectal cancer: 
Colorectal cancer TNM stage IV refined by treatment regimen 
14 consecutive days followed by 7 days rest (1 treatment cycle). This treatment cycle is repeated 
every 3 weeks. 
14 * 17.4 / 365 = 0.667 
Fpen refined = 0.667 * 0.000122 = 0.0000814 
Calculation of PEC 
Estimation of PEC surface water in the Phase I assessment is calculated below using the refined Fpen 
of above for both indications. 
DOSEai = Maximum daily dose consumed per inhabitant 
Fpen = Fraction of market penetration = 0.01 (default value but can be refined) 
WASTWinhab = Amount of wastewater per inhabitant per day = 200 L (default value) 
DILUTION = Dilution factor = 10 (default value) 
The maximum total daily dose of tegafur administered in stomach cancer is 120 mg and in metastatic 
colorectal cancer is 140 mg. 
Stomach cancer stage III-IV refined treatment regimen 
The refined Fpen has been calculated only for tegafur and the PECSURFACEWATER value has been 
Assessment report  
EMA/2190/2022 
Page 11/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
obtained for tegafur, as shown above. Since S-1 is a Fixed- Combination, this means that 
PECSURFACEWATER values for gimeracil and oteracil as shown below can be calculated from the 
PECSURFACEWATER value for tegafur on the basis of the relative fixed amounts in the doses. 
PECSURFACEWATER for gimeracil = 0.00264 μg/L 
PECSURFACEWATER for oteracil monopotassium salt = 0.00892 μg/L 
Action Limit 
The PECSURFACEWATER values of 0.0091 μg/L, 0.00264 μg/L and 0.00892 μg/L, for tegafur, gimeracil 
and oteracil monopotassium salt are lower than the action limit of 0.01 μg/L, respectively. 
Therefore, it is concluded that S-1 15 and 20 mg capsules will not represent a risk to the environment 
following its prescribed usage in patients treated for advanced gastric cancer or metastatic colorectal 
cancer when given in combination with cisplatin in the EU. A Phase II analysis is not applicable in view 
of the extremely low environmental exposures to tegafur, gimeracil and oteracil monopotassium salt. 
2.2.1.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of tegafur, gimeracil and oteracil.  
Considering the above data, tegafur, gimeracil and oteracil should be used according to the 
precautions stated in the SmPC in order to minimize any potential risks to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
Teysuno is an oral combination of three active substances, tegafur (FT), gimeracil (CDHP), and oteracil 
(Oxo). After absorption, tegafur is converted by the liver into 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Gimeracil and oteracil 
are included to reduce the metabolism of 5-FU thereby improving the bioavailability of 5-FU and reducing 
the toxic effects of its metabolites. Each hard capsule contains 15 mg tegafur, 4.35 mg gimeracil and 
11.8 mg oteracil (as monopotassium). 
Teysuno (25 mg/m2) is currently approved for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer when given in 
combination with cisplatin (75 mg/m2). This type II variation is to include the additional indication for 
Teysuno  (30  mg/m2)  given  in  combination  with  cisplatin  (75  mg/m2)  in  patients  with  metastatic 
colorectal cancer. 
The dosage for Teysuno in patients with advanced gastric cancer is as follows: 
The  recommended  standard  dose  of  Teysuno  when  administered  in  combination  with  cisplatin  is  25 
mg/m2  (expressed  as  tegafur  content)  twice  daily,  morning  and  evening,  for  21  consecutive  days 
followed by 7 days rest (1 treatment cycle). This treatment cycle is repeated every 4 weeks. 
The dosage for Teysuno patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is proposed as follows: 
The proposed dose in mCRC is 30 mg/m2 b.i.d. days 1-14 with a one-week pause (± bevacizumab 7.5 
mg/kg  on  day  1).  For  combination  therapy,  25  mg/m2  b.i.d.  d1-14  followed  by  one-week  pause  is 
recommended. 
To  support  this  type  II  variation  an  overview  of  pharmacokinetic  data  in  literature  were  provided  of 
Teysuno. 
Pharmacokinetics in patients 
Pharmacokinetic results with the proposed dosage as presented in the overview provided by Zhang et al 
(2007):

Renal function 
In a Phase 1 study designed to determine the effect of renal function on the pharmacokinetics of Teysuno 
components and metabolites (Study S1111), patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance 
[CrCl] >80 mL/min) and those with mild renal impairment (CrCl 51 to 80 mL/min) received Teysuno 30 
mg/m2 b.i.d., while patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min) received a reduced 
Assessment report  
EMA/2190/2022 
Page 15/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Teysuno dose of 20 mg/m2 b.i.d. The results showed an increase in mean 5-FU AUC0-inf in the mild 
renal  impairment  group  compared  to  the  normal  group  receiving  the  same  dose,  while  there  was  no 
increase  in  mean  5-FU  AUC0-inf  in  the  moderate  renal  impairment  group  (receiving  20  mg/m2  BID) 
relative  to  that  of  the  normal  group  (receiving  30  mg/m2  b.i.d.).  These  results  suggest  that  a  dose 
reduction to 20 mg/m2 is warranted in patients with moderate renal impairment in order to obtain 5-FU 
plasma  concentrations  similar  to  that  obtained  in  patients  with  normal  renal  function  receiving  30 
mg/m2. For patients with mild renal impairment, the results suggest that a dose reduction to 25 mg/m2 
Teysuno  may  be  needed  to  achieve  5-FU  plasma  concentrations  similar  to  those  obtained  in  patients 
with normal renal function receiving 30 mg/m2. 
Hepatic Function 
No  dose  adjustment  is  recommended  for  patients  with  hepatic  impairment.  There  were  no  significant 
differences  in  AUCs  of  5-FU,  tegafur,  gimeracil,  or  oteracil  after  either  single  or  multiple  dose 
administration  of  Teysuno  30  mg/m2  b.i.d.  in  patients  with  mild,  moderate,  or  severe  impairment 
compared to those with normal hepatic function (Study S1112). After single dose administration, there 
was  a  statistically  significant  decrease  in  5-FU  and  gimeracil  Cmax  values  for  the  severe  hepatic 
impairment group relative to that of the normal group, but this difference was not observed after multiple 
dose administration. 
Ethnic differences in pharmacokinetics 
Teysuno has mainly been administered to Asian patients, who have a markedly different tolerability of 
Teysuno  compared  with  Western  populations  and  in  whom  the  standard  dose  used  in  trials  in  mCRC 
patients was 40 mg/m2 b.i.d. (Yamada et al., 2013; Baba et al., 2017; Hong et al., 2012; Kim et al., 
2014;  Yamada  et  al.,  2018;  Muro  et  al.,  2010;  Yasui  et  al.,  2015).  Differences  in  tolerability  of 
fluoropyrimidines in different ethnic populations have previously been observed but the basis for these 
differences  is  unknown  (Haller  et  al.,  2008;  Shirao  et  al.,  2004).  In  Western  patients,  the  maximum 
tolerated dose for Teysuno as monotherapy has been established in a Phase 1 study at 30 mg/m2 twice 
daily, dose-limiting toxicities occurred at dose levels of 35 mg/m2 twice a day (Zhu et al., 2007). On the 
basis of these findings, 30 mg/m2 twice daily is recommended as the starting dose for future studies in 
Western patients.  
2.3.1.  Pharmacodynamics 
No pharmacodynamic data were provided. 
2.3.2.   PK/PD modelling 
No PK/PD modelling was provided. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No new PK data was provided in support of this type II variation. Information on the 30 mg/m2 dose was 
already available in the original dossier, and was confirmed by a published overview article by Zhang et 
al (2007). Presented data supported the original pharmacokinetic data with Teysuno in advanced gastric 
cancer. With regard to the intrinsic factors there is an increase in 5-FU steady state exposure in patients 
with renal impairment. The effects of other intrinsic factors, including age, were generally small with a 
minimal impact on 5-FU AUC. Pharmacokinetics were not found to be different between ethnic groups to 
a clinically relevant extent. It is agreed that the probably the reason for different recommended doses 
of TesyunoS-1 between Western and Japanese patients is the ethnic differences in 5-FU tolerability rather 
than  the  difference  in  pharmacokinetics.  This  trend  is  also  observed  for  other  fluoropyrimidine 
Assessment report

chemotherapies.  With  regard  to  extrinsic  factors,  food  has  a  small  influence  on  the  bioavailability  of 
oteracil (32% decrease with food). 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The results of a phase 1 study to determine the schedule of a combination of S-1 with oxaliplatin and 
bevacizumab  in  a  Caucasian  population  with  advanced  or  metastatic  solid  tumours  for  which  no 
established standard therapy exists (Chung et al., 2011) are used by the MAH to support the indication. 
The results will be discussed in the section “Main studies”. 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
The  MAH  based  the  support  for  the  indication  in  colorectal  cancer  on  published  articles  which  were 
summarised in the clinical overview. In the efficacy part below, the MAH’s summary of each publication 
will be reported. In response to the D120 LoQ, the MAH included the more detailed results as published 
by  the  primary  articles  from  the  Rapporteur’s  comment  boxes  in  the  clinical  overview.  The  comment 
boxes are, therefore, included in the text of the assessment report. A critical assessment of the provided 
literature will be discussed in the clinical efficacy discussion. 
In response to the D120 LoQ, the MAH performed a new meta-analysis of efficacy in all phase 2 and 3 
studies of Teysuno-based regimens compared to 5-FU- and capecitabine-based regimens in mCRC, which 
will be discussed first (Derksen et al., 2021, in preparation), followed by the separate articles. Lastly, 
exploratory  efficacy  results  from  two  additional  studies  will  be  discussed  that  were  performed  in 
European patients who switched to S-1 based therapy due to toxicity on other fluoropyrimidine-based 
therapy. 
Systematic review and meta-analysis on the non-inferiority of S-1 containing 
regimens versus 5-FU/capecitabine-containing regimens in the treatment of 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
Methods 
• 
Literature search 
For the searching of the electronic scientific databases, i.e. MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase and Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), a sensitive search strategy without date restriction was 
applied  using  medical  subject  headings  pertaining  to  the  study  design,  population,  and  intervention 
relevant to this review. In addition, grey literature was searched for using OpenGrey; an online database 
containing  bibliographical  references  of  grey  literature  in  Europe.  Reference  lists  of  review  papers 
included  in  our  search  results  were  screened  for  potentially  relevant  publications.  When  publications 
could not be retrieved online, but contact information was provided, authors were contacted. The full 
search  strategies  for  all  utilized  databased  are  provided  in  Figure  1.  For  this  systematic  review  the 
Preferred  Reporting  Items  for  Systematic  Reviews  and  Meta-analyses  (PRISMA)  statement  was 
considered.

Inclusion criteria 
Studies had to meet the following eligibility criteria: (1) patients with age >18 years; (2) histologically 
proved  colorectal  cancer  with  distant  metastases  (mCRC);  (3)  palliative  S-1  based  (mono  or 
combination) therapy, compared with Fluorouracil (5-FU)- or Capecitabine-based (mono or combination) 
therapy (5FU/Cap); and (4) prospective phase II or phase III randomized clinical trials. 
• 
Statistical analysis 
The  primary  outcome  was  progression  free  survival  (PFS),  secondary  outcomes  were  overall  survival 
(OS) and objective response rate (ORR). For the time-to-event outcomes, PFS and OS, hazard ratios 
(HRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and - to support our main meta-analysis results - median 
survival and time to progression with corresponding p-values were extracted from the individual studies. 
Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population of the included studies with PFS and OS data. 
Pooled HRs are provided for the total population of mCRC patients, and per subgroup of treatment line, 
including 99% CIs. When treatment arms of individual studies compared 5FU or capecitabine with S-1, 
using  the  same  combination  therapy,  a  direct  evaluation  of  5FU/Cap-based  therapy  vs.  S-1  based 
therapy in this meta-analysis is justified. Sensitivity analyses were performed by comparing the observed 
overall effect estimate to the estimate when studies with a divergent design were omitted. The aim of 
this meta-analysis is to show that the effect of S-1 based therapy is not inferior to the effect of 5FU/Cap-

based therapy by a specified amount, called the non-inferiority margin (ΔNI). Here, a pre-defined ΔNI 
of 1.25 for PFS was selected based on the trial with the most conservative ΔNI in this review, i.e. Yamada, 
2018 [3]. Thus, non-inferiority of S-1 based therapy relative to 5FU/Cap-based therapy is established 
when the upper limit of the 99% CI of the pooled HRtotal remains <1.25. 
Data for our meta-analysis on the ORR were extracted from the primary publications of studies included 
in this review. From these publications we extracted the number of patients with a complete or partial 
response and divided this by the total number of patients with evaluable lesions for response analysis. 
Then, risk ratios (RRs) and 99% CIs were calculated. 
Meta-analyses of all outcomes mentioned above were conducted in Review Manager 5.4, using random-
effect models with generic inverse-variance weighing to minimize the imprecision of the pooled effect 
estimate. All tests were two-sided, and heterogeneity was assessed by the Cochran Q-test and quantified 
by the I2 index.

A total of four hundred and fifty-seven unique references were identified through our sensitive systematic 
search in MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and OpenGrey until May 21, 2021, of which 174 review, registry 
registration,  or  duplicate  references  were  removed,  leaving  283  references  for  title  and  abstract 
screening (for full list and decisions, please see Appendix Table A3 Derksen et al., 2021, Meta-analysis 
appendix file). Eligibility screening based on title and abstract led to the exclusion of 267 references. 
Two  additional  potentially  relevant  publications  were  found  in  one  of  the  retrieved  review  articles.  In 
total, 18 publications were sought for retrieval, of which four publications - after contacting two authors 
-  could  not  be  obtained  (Table  2).  The  remaining  14  publications  were  assessed  for  eligibility.  Ten 
publications  with  (updated)  PFS,  OS  or  ORR  outcomes  were  included  [1-10],  and  for  the  analysis  on 
ORR, four corresponding primary publications of the same trials were included [11-14].

Table 2. Publications not obtained 
There were no major differences in study and patient characteristics among the studies included (Table 
3). Two studies with a noticeable difference in study design include the publication by Yamada et al. [3], 
and Kato et al. [8]. First, in the study by Yamada et al., a different combination therapy was used in the 
two  arms,  i.e.  S-1  +  irinotecan  and  bevacizumab  in  the  intervention  arm  vs.  5FU  +  oxaliplatin  and 
bevacizumab, or capecitabine + oxaliplatin and bevacizumab in the control arm. Based on the recent 
meta-analysis by Kawai et al. [15] that showed no significant difference in irinotecan- and oxaliplatin-
based first-line therapies for mCRC, a direct comparison of S-1 based vs. 5FU/Cap-based therapy was 
justified. Second, in the study by Kato et al., patients were treated in both first-line and second-line [8]. 
Since the majority of patients in this study were treated in first-line setting (78%), and no significant 
bias between the two groups was observed according to the authors, this reference was considered a 
first-line study in the current meta-analysis.

Efficacy of S-1 based therapy versus 5FU/Cap-based therapy 
Ten studies (n=2,117) were included in the meta-analysis; 1,062 patients received S-1 based therapy 
and 1,055 patients received 5FU/Cap-based therapy. Nine studies were conducted in Asia, and one study 
was  conducted  in  Europe.  We  were  able  to  extract  HRs  for  PFS  and  OS  from  six  studies  [1-4,6,9], 
whereas ORR data were available from 10 studies [3,5-8,10-14].

Progression-free survival 
As the upper limit of the 99%CI of the HRtotal for PFS does not reach the predefined ΔNI of 1.25, it was 
shown  that  S-1  based  therapy  is  non-inferior  to  5FU/Cap-based  therapy,  in  the  treatment  of  mCRC 
(HRtotal 0.95, 99%CI 0.83–1.08) (Figure 3). When stratified by treatment line, a pooled HRsubgroup of 0.92 
(99%CI 0.80–1.06) was observed for first-line treatment, and a HRsubgroup of 1.06 (99%CI 0.82–1.37) 
for second-line treatment. No significant heterogeneity was detected for PFS (I2 = 12%, P = 0.34).

Sensitivity  analysis  showed  that  the  direction  of  the  estimator  of  the  HRs  for  PFS  and  non-inferiority 
were  not  influenced  by  omission  of  the  study  by  Yamada  et  al.  [3] that  used  a  different  combination 
therapy in the intervention and control arm. 
In addition, median PFS (months) per arm was reported by four other studies; three first-line studies 
[5,7,8] and one second-line study [10]. An overview of studies and median PFS data are presented in 
Table  4.  Except  for  the  study  by  Kim  et  al.  [5],  which  reported  a  median  time  to  progression  of  7.4 
months for the control arm vs. 6.1 months for the S-1 based arm, the other three studies reported a 
numerically longer time to progression in the S-1 based arm, with an increase ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 
months [7,8,10]. All four studies reported no statistically significant difference in PFS between 5FU/Cap 
based vs. S-1 based therapy (P > 0.05).

Note that, based on literature, we selected a slightly less stringent non-inferiority margin as compared 
to the previously used margin of 1.23 for the approval of capecitabine (Xeloda). However, to increase 
preciseness of our meta-analysis results the pooled HRs are presented with corresponding 99% CIs, and

the HRtotal for PFS - with an upper limit of 1.08 – also remains below the previously used margin of 
1.23. 
Overall survival 
Although the endpoint OS was a secondary outcome in all of the included studies, the current results 
indicate that S-1 based therapy is at least as effective as 5FU/Cap-based therapy in terms of OS (HRtotal 
0.93, 99%CI 0.81–1.07) (Figure 4). When stratified by treatment line, a pooled HRsubgroup of 0.94 (99%CI 
0.80–1.10) was observed for first-line treatment, and a HRsubgroup of 0.90 (99%CI 0.68–1.19) for second-
line treatment. No significant heterogeneity was detected for OS (I2 = 0%, P = 0.82).

interval; OS, overall survival. 
Sensitivity analysis showed that the direction of the estimator of the HRs for OS and its significance were 
both  not  influenced  by  omission  of  the  study  by  Yamada  et  al.  [3]  that  used  a  different  combination 
therapy in the intervention and control arm. 
In  addition,  median  OS  (months)  per  arm  was  reported  by  three  other  studies;  two  first-line  studies 
[5,7] and one second-line study [10]. An overview of studies and median OS data are presented in Table 
4. All three studies reported no statistically significant difference in OS between 5FU/Cap based therapy 
vs. S-1 based therapy (P > 0.05). 
Objective response rate 
Based on the pooled risk ratio for response, i.e. a complete or partial response to the received therapy, 
it was shown that S-1 based therapy is at least as effective as 5FU/Cap-based therapy in terms of ORR 
(RRtotal 1.06, 99%CI 0.90–1.24) (Figure 5). When stratified by treatment line, a pooled RRsubgroup of 1.04 
(99%CI 0.87–1.25) was observed for first-line treatment, and a pooled RRsubgroup of 1.19 (99%CI 0.77–
1.84)  for  and  second-line  treatment.  Moderate  heterogeneity  was  detected  for  ORR  (I2  =  48%,  P  = 
0.04).

Methods 
• 
Study participants 
Patients with previously untreated mCRC in the Netherlands were included. The main eligibility criteria 
were age ≥18 years, histologically proven CRC with distant metastases, WHO performance status of 0–
2, adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function, and planned first-line treatment with fluoropyrimidine 
monochemotherapy  with  or  without  bevacizumab.  Patients  were  excluded  if  they  had  prior  adjuvant 
treatment  completed  within  6  months  prior  to  randomisation,  planned  radical  resection  of  metastatic

disease  after  downsizing  by  systemic  treatment,  history  of  a  second  malignancy  in  the  past  5  years, 
previous  intolerance  of  capecitabine,  known  dihydropyrimidine  dehydrogenase  (DPD)  deficiency,  any 
significant cardiovascular disease within 1 year before randomisation, or concomitant administration of 
any other experimental or anti-cancer therapy. 
Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before study entry. 
• 
Treatments 
Patients received oral capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 for <70 years; 1000 mg/m2 for ≥70  years) or oral 
Teysuno (30 mg/m2) twice daily on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle with the option to add bevacizumab 
(7.5 mg/kg IV on day 1) at the discretion of the local investigator. Treatment in both arms was continued 
until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal. 
Detailed dose modification and supportive measures were also described by Kwakman et al., 2017. In 
case  of  grade  2-3  HFS  or  other  grade  ≥2  non-haematological  toxicities,  capecitabine  or  S-1  was 
interrupted until recovery to grade ≤1, or in case of grade ≥2 diarrhoea until complete recovery. At the 
second occurrence of any grade 2 or first occurrence of any grade 3 non-haematological toxicity, the 
dose of capecitabine or S-1 was reduced to 75% and 80% of the original dose, respectively. The dose 
was  reduced to  50%  for  capecitabine  or 70%  for  S-1  at  the  third  occurrence of  any  grade  2,  second 
occurrence  of  any  grade  3,  or  first  occurrence  of  any  grade  4  non-haematological  toxicity.  If  despite 
these dose reductions a given non-haematological toxicity occurred for a fourth time at grade 2, a third 
time  at  grade  3,  or  a  second  time  at  grade  4,  study  treatment  was  discontinued.  In  case  of  grade  4 
haematological toxicity and/or febrile neutropaenia, the dose of capecitabine or S-1 was reduced to 75% 
and 80%, respectively. Upon recurrence of a grade 4 haematological toxicity, doses were further reduced 
to  50%  and  70%,  respectively.  If  grade  4  haematological  toxicity  recurred,  study  treatment  was 
discontinued. Treatment was delayed with a week for a maximum of two weeks if the white blood cell or 
platelet  counts  were  below  3.0  and  75x109/L,  respectively,  at  the  start  of  each  treatment  cycle. 
Bevacizumab  was  administered  each  cycle  when  blood  pressure  did  not  exceed  150/100  mmHg,  a 
diastolic increase was lower than 20 mmHg compared to baseline, and 24-hour urine protein was lower 
than 2 grams (only collected in the presence of a 2+–4+ dipstick). In case of a thrombo-embolic event, 
nephrotic  syndrome,  or  grade  3–4  haemorrhage,  bevacizumab  was  permanently  discontinued.  Dose 
reductions for bevacizumab were not performed and dose reductions for capecitabine or S-1 were not 
re-escalated. Omitted doses were not made up for after resuming treatment. All patients were provided 
with  a  home  prescription  and  instructions  for  prophylactic  anti-emetics  (metoclopramide  or  5-HT3 
antagonists). Supportive measures as specified in the study protocol included emollients in case of HFS, 
loperamide for diarrhoea and amlodipine for hypertension. 
• 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to show an improvement of the incidence of HFS of at least 20%—from 
30% for capecitabine to 10% for S-1. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the incidence of hand-foot syndrome (HFS) and secondary endpoints included 
grade 3 HFS, other toxicity, relative dose intensity (RDI), progression-free survival (PFS), response rate 
(RR), and overall survival (OS). 
The primary endpoint was the incidence of any grade HFS as assessed by the local investigators using 
the  National  Cancer  Institute  Common  Toxicity  Criteria  (NCI-CTC),  version  4.0.  The  results  of  this 
endpoint will be discussed in the safety section. 
Assessment report  
EMA/2190/2022 
Page 26/27 
 
 
 
 
Secondary endpoints included the incidence of grade 3 HFS, any grade and grade 3 HFS as assessed by 
patients, other toxicities, PFS, response rate, OS and RDI. Patient-reported HFS-related symptoms were 
collected in a diary, which was designed specifically for this trial. The symptoms were graded centrally 
according to the NCI-CTC by an investigator who was unaware of treatment. 
Patients in both study groups were evaluated every 3 weeks for toxicity by NCI CTC and every 9 weeks 
for disease status by CT-scan according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
1.1 criteria. Patients were asked to score symptoms associated with HFS in a diary at the end of each 
cycle.  Diaries  were  collected  at  the  end  of  study  treatment,  and  scores  were  unknown  to  local 
investigators.  After  discontinuation  of  treatment  for  reasons  other  than  disease  progression,  patients 
were followed every 3 months until progression or death. 
• 
Sample size 
The primary objective was to show an improvement of the incidence of HFS of at least 20%—from 30% 
for capecitabine to 10% for S-1—based on a previous Asian study (Hong et al., Lancet Oncology, 2012). 
The  study  required  150  patients  to  detect  this  difference  with  90%  power  (two-sided  a=0.05).  The 
intention-to-treat  population  was  defined  as  all  randomised  patients  and  the  safety  population  as  all 
patients who received at least one dose of study medication. 
• 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either capecitabine or S-1 with the use of TENALEA (an online, 
central randomisation service). Minimisation techniques were used with stratification for the planned use 
of bevacizumab (yes versus no), WHO performance status (0–1 versus 2), serum LDH (normal versus 
abnormal) and institution. 
• 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable, this was an open-label trial. 
• 
Statistical methods 
The frequency of HFS and other adverse events were compared with Fisher’s exact test in the safety 
population. The cumulative incidence of grades 2 and 3 HFS was calculated by censoring patients without 
grades  2  and 3  HFS  and  treating  death  and  progression  as  a  competing  risk.  Logistic  regression  was 
used  for  pre-planned  subgroup  analyses  of  cotreatment  with  bevacizumab  (yes  versus  no),  WHO 
performance score (0–1 versus 2), serum LDH (normal versus abnormal), sex (male versus female) and 
age (<70 versus ≥70 years), and for exploratory analyses of prior adjuvant therapy (yes versus no), 
and  localisation  of  metastasis  (liver  only  versus  extrahepatic).  PFS  and  OS  were  calculated  from 
randomisation in the intention-to-treat population and compared with Cox proportional hazard models 
and Kaplan–Meier curves. Patients alive or alive without progression at last follow-up were censored for 
OS and PFS, respectively. 
RDI was calculated as the ratio of the total dose of study medication administered divided by the target 
dose for the total treatment duration (only for patients who completed treatment) and compared with 
Wilcoxon’s rank sum test.

Recruitment 
Between January 2014 and July 2015, 161 patients from 27 Dutch hospitals were randomly assigned in 
either the capecitabine group (n=81) or S-1 group (n=80). The trial was conducted and sponsored by 
the Dutch Colorectal Cancer Group in 27 hospitals in the Netherlands. 
• 
Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted in accordance to the standards of Good Clinical Practice, in agreement with 
the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved centrally by the Ethics Review Committee of the 
Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, and by the local institutional review boards. 
• 
Baseline data 
Median age was 73 years (range 50-86) and co-treatment with bevacizumab was administered to 59% 
of patients (capecitabine, n=47; S-1, n=48). Disease characteristics between the treatment groups were 
similar in terms of the presence of synchronous disease (41% capecitabine, 43% S-1) and site of primary 
tumour (colon 54% capecitabine, 55% S-1; rectum 30% capecitabine, 29% S-1). A majority of patients 
in each group had undergone surgery (60% capecitabine, 64% S-1) of the primary tumour but most had 
not  received  adjuvant  chemotherapy  (83%  capecitabine,  88%  S-1).  See  Table  5  for  more  detailed 
information of the baseline characteristics.

Numbers analysed 
As is shown in the flow diagram of the study population above, 80 patients in both groups were analysed 
(Figure 6). 
• 
Outcomes and estimation 
There were no significant differences in PFS, RR, or OS between the treatment groups. After a median 
follow-up duration of 20.2 months (IQR 17.0-23.5), 73 (90%) patients in the capecitabine group and 70 
(88%) patients in the S-1 group had progressed or died. Median PFS was 8.2 months (95% CI 6.4-10.3) 
in the capecitabine group and 8.4 months (6.4-10.6) in the S-1 group (hazard ratio (HR) 0.99, 95% CI 
0.71-1.37, p=0.93, Figure 7).

OS at 12 months and 18 months was 67% (95% CI 57-78) and 50% (40-63) in the capecitabine group, 
compared to 62% (53-74) and 41% (30-54) in the S-1 group (HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.82-1.86, p=0.32). 
Additional long-term OS results are shown below. 
The overall objective response rate in 146 evaluable patients was 47% in the capecitabine group and 
32% in the S-1 group (n=35 vs n=23, p=0.09). Disease control was observed in 95% of the patients in 
the capecitabine group and 89% in the S-1 group (n=71 vs n=63, p=0.24) (Table 6).

discontinued treatment prior to the planned assessment after nine weeks and no assessments were performed.   
Long-term  survival  results  for  this  study  were  reported  after  a  median  follow-up  of  40.3  months  and 
after 71 (88%) of patients in the capecitabine group and 68 (85%) of patients in the S-1 group had died 
(Kwakman  et  al.,  2019).  Median  PFS  was  8.2  months  (95%  CI  6.4-10.3)  for  patients  treated  with 
capecitabine compared to 8.4 months (95%CI 6.4-10.6) for S-1 (HR1.02, 95%CI 0.75-1.40, p=0.89). 
Long-term results also demonstrated that there were no statistically significant differences in OS between 
the two treatments. OS was 17.1 months (95%CI 14.3-23.5) for capecitabine and 17.0 months (95%CI 
13.0-20.1) for S-1 (HR 1.07, 95%CI 0.76-1.49, p=0.70) (Figure 8).

The following additional results are described in the provided publication by Kwakman et al., 2017. The 
addition of bevacizumab to capecitabine/S-1 was associated with an improved PFS [8.7 months (7.8–
10.8) with bevacizumab (n=95) versus 6.6 months (5.3–8.5) without bevacizumab (n=66), HR 0.74, 
95%  CI  0.53–1.03,  p=0.08].  There  was  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  median  PFS  between 
capecitabine  (n=34)  and  capecitabine  plus  bevacizumab  (n=47)  [6.6  months  (5.5–8.5)  versus  9.2 
months (6.6–13.8); HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38–0.97; p=0.04]. Median PFS for S-1 alone (n=32) and S-1 
plus bevacizumab (n=48) was 6.4 months (4.3–12.8) and 8.7months (6.7–10.6), respectively (HR 0.91, 
95% CI 0.56–1.47; p=0.69). 
Subsequent treatments are listed in the flow chart of Figure 6. Patients in the capecitabine group received 
more subsequent lines of treatment than patients in the S-1 group, although not statistically significant 
(p=0.30). 
Kwakman et al., 2019 present updated results on survival with data cutoff on August 6, 2018. In addition 
to the data described above, this publication also reports that exploratory survival analysis of treatment 
with or without bevacizumab showed a median PFS of 8.7 versus 6.6 months, and median OS of 17.8 
versus 15.1 months, respectively. Forty patients (49%) in the capecitabine group and 41 patients (51%) 
in the S-1 group received 1 or more subsequent treatments (p=0.88). 
Efficacy combination therapies in mCRC patients 
The  proposed  new  indication  will  recommend  the  use  of  S-1  in  the  same  regimens  as  other 
fluoropyrimidines  in  mCRC.  Therefore,  the  MAH  first  discussed  the  data  supporting  the  use  of 
fluoropyrimidines regimens in combination therapies in mCRC. ESMO guidelines currently recommend

intravenous 5-FU or capecitabine as the backbone of cytotoxic therapy in combination with irinotecan 
and/or oxaliplatin, combined with a targeted agent such as bevacizumab or anti-epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) agents such as cetuximab or panitumumab, when appropriate, for first-line treatment 
(Van Cutsem et al., 2016). 
Studies  that  form  the  basis  for  current  approval  of  fluoropyrimidines  (5-FU  and  capecitabine)  in 
combination therapies in mCRC in the EU as provided by the MAH 
FOLFOX (5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin) and FOLFIRI (5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan) were approved by EMA 
for  the  first-line  treatment  of  advanced/metastatic  colorectal  cancer  based  on  the  phase  3  EFC2962 
study (FOLFOX; de Gramont et al., 2000) and a phase 3 randomised trial from Douillard et al. (FOLFIRI; 
Douillard  et  al.,  2000).  Based  on  the  results  from  these  studies,  the  Gruppo  Oncologico  dell’Italia 
Meridionale (GOIM) conducted a randomized trial (GOIM protocol No. 9901) to compare FOLFIRI with 
FOLFOX for first-line treatment of colorectal cancer. This study concluded that “There was no difference 
in  ORR,  TTP,  and  OS  for  patients  treated  with  the  FOLFIRI  or  FOLFOX4  regimen,  and  both  therapies 
seemed effective as first-line treatment in these patients.” (Table 7) (Colucci et al., 2005). 
Table 7. Summary of efficacy data from the GOIM 9901 study 
Therefore, both FOLFOX and FOLFIRI were established as the standard of care for first-line treatment of 
advanced colorectal cancer with equivalent efficacy. 
Additional  studies  have  demonstrated the  efficacy  of  switching  between  various  FOLFOX  and  FOLFIRI 
regimens after disease progression, allowing patients to continue on fluoropyrimidine-based treatment 
in the second line (Tournigand et al., 2004; Bidard et al., 2009). 
XELOX  (capecitabine  plus  oxaliplatin;  also  referred  to  as  CapeOX)  is  a  standard  care  for  first-line 
treatment of colorectal cancer that was approved in several countries based on the NO16966 study, a 
non-inferiority  study  of  XELOX  (+/-  bevacizumab)  vs.  FOLFOX4  (5-FU,  leucovorin,  oxaliplatin)  (+/- 
bevacizumab) for first-line treatment of colorectal cancer (Cassidy et al., 2008). The primary endpoint 
of  NO16966  was  PFS,  which  demonstrated  non-inferiority  with  a  margin  of  1.23,  corresponding  to 
retention  of  at  least  50%  of  the  benefit  that  oxaliplatin  plus  5-FU/LV  had  shown  over  5-FU/LV  alone 
(Cassidy et al., 2008). The non-inferiority margin was set based on the results of the EFC2962 study (de 
Gramont et al., 2000) by which FOLFOX4 was approved as first-line treatment of colorectal cancer by 
the  EMEA  after  comparison  to  infusional  5-FU  plus  leucovorin  alone  (Oxaliplatin  SmPC).  Therefore,  a 
non-inferiority margin of 1.23 has been shown to be acceptable as the non-inferiority measure for first-
line treatment of colorectal cancer with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy according to the MAH. 
In addition, two large observational cohort studies were conducted for bevacizumab containing regimens 
including FOLFIRI, FOLFOX, and XELOX in Europe (BEAT study; Van Cutsem et al., 2009) and the US 
(BRiTE study; Kozloff et al., 2009) (Table 8).

According  to  the  MAH,  these  studies  have  established  FOLFOX,  FOLFIRI,  and  XELOX,  with  or  without 
bevacizumab,  as  equivalent  standard  treatment  in  mCRC  (Van  Cutsem  et  al.,  2016).  ESMO 
recommendations state that the combination of capecitabine plus irinotecan (XELIRI) is less often used 
due to early concerns about its toxicity in comparison to FOLFIRI regimen, but that these results are 
controversial (Van Cutsem et al., 2016). 
Teysuno combination therapy in Asian mCRC patients 
The  MAH  presents  four  supportive  phase  3  non-inferiority  studies  of  Teysuno  in  combination  with 
oxaliplatin or irinotecan, with or without bevacizumab, in metastatic colorectal cancer in Asian patients:

3.  TRICOLORE  study  (IRIS  [irinotecan,  Teysuno]/bevacizumab  vs.  mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab  or

Methods 
• 
Study participants 
This was a non-inferiority study of SOX vs. CapeOX for first-line treatment of mCRC conducted in 340 
patients in South Korea. The study was a randomised, open-label, multicenter phase 3 study. Patients 
were  recruited  from  11  institutions  in  South  Korea.  To  be  eligible,  patients  with  metastatic  colorectal 
cancer were required to have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma, have measurable or assessable 
lesions, have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0–2, be aged 
18 years or older, have had no previous chemotherapy or immunotherapy in the metastatic setting, and 
have  adequate  haematological,  hepatic,  and  renal  functions.  Adjuvant  chemotherapy  or  radiotherapy

was allowed if it had been completed at least 6 months before enrolment. All patients provided written 
informed consent before study entry, and the study protocol was approved by the institutional review 
boards  of  all  participating  institutions.  This  study  is  registered  with  ClinicalTrials.gov,  number 
NCT00677443. 
• 
Treatments 
All treatment cycles were administered every 3 weeks. Oral S-1 (40 mg/m²) was administered twice a 
day  on  days  1–14,  oral  capecitabine  (1000  mg/m²)  twice  a  day  on  days  1–14,  and  oxaliplatin  (130 
mg/m²) on day 1 as a 2-h intravenous infusion. Treatment was continued for as many as nine cycles of 
oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy, except in instances of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, 
or  a  patient’s  refusal.  Maintenance  chemotherapy  with  S-1  or  capecitabine  was  allowed  after 
discontinuation of oxaliplatin (Hong et al., 2012).

No details were provided. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was PFS with a pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 1.43. Secondary endpoints 
were response rate, time to treatment failure (TTF), OS, toxicity, and QoL. Data collection was done by 
the Velos system of the National Cancer Centre, South Korea. 
Treatment responses were assessed every three cycles (9 weeks) during study treatments or sooner if 
needed  for  documentation  of  disease  progression.  Objective  tumour  responses  were  independently 
reviewed according to RECIST; version 1.0. Clinical and laboratory toxicities were monitored according 
to the NCI-CTC for Adverse Events (version 3.0). QoL was assessed before treatment and at every point 
of response assessments with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality 
of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ C30; Korean version). 
• 
Sample size 
PFS at 15 months in both groups was assumed to be 38%, and the lower non-inferiority limit was set as 
–13%, corresponding to a hazard ratio of 1.43. On the basis of these conditions, 192 events were needed 
for a one-sided type-I error of 5% and a power of 80%. Assuming a 10% loss, 344 patients were needed 
(172  per  treatment  group).  The  protocol  was  amended  on  Jan  28,  2009:  initially,  165  events  were 
targeted and accrual of 298 patients (149 per treatment group) of which the upper limit of non-inferiority 
margin was 1.31. 
• 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were randomly assigned to either CapeOX or SOX in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation was 
done  centrally  with  a  computer-generated  sequence  and  a  permutation  block  technique  that  ensured 
equal distribution of patients on the basis of primary tumour sites (colon vs rectum), history of previous 
adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment, and the presence of measurable lesions. Investigators or research 
coordinators  sent  the  randomisation  form  by  fax  to  the  Clinical  Research  Coordination  Centre  of  the 
National Cancer Centre, South Korea. After checking the inclusion criteria, the study coordinator sent 
the  allocated  treatment  back  to  the  investigator  by  fax.  A  web-based  clinical  research  management 
platform  (Velos  Inc,  Fremont,  CA,  USA)  for  randomisation  was  used.  Investigators  who  assessed  the 
response to the treatment were not masked to group assignment.

Statistical methods 
For the primary efficacy analysis, in which it was aimed to assess the non-inferiority of SOX to CapeOX 
in terms of PFS, all patients allocated to treatment were assessed (ITT), and also a per-protocol analysis 
was  performed  in  those  who  received  protocol  treatments  without  major  violations.  For  the  safety 
analysis, data was assessed for all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. OS (time 
to  death),  PFS  (time  to  progression  or  death),  and  TTF  (time  to  treatment  discontinuation  from  any 
cause including disease progression, patients’ refusal, lost to follow-up, chemotherapy-free interval after 
completion of planned nine cycles of study treatment even without evidence of disease progression, and 
intolerability from adverse events), along with 95% CI for median time to event, were assessed with the 
Kaplan-Meier  method.  Patients  who  entered  into  a  chemotherapy-free  interval  after  completion  of 
planned  treatment  were  censored  for  the  PFS  estimations.  The  HR  and  corresponding  95%  CI  were 
estimated using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. The dose intensity was calculated as the 
ratio  of  the  total  dose  divided  by  the  total  treatment  duration.  EORTC  QLQ  C30  score  changes  from 
baseline were compared between treatment groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. SAS (version 9.1) 
and SPSS (version 20.0) was used for all statistical analyses.

The non-inferiority margin for this study was set at a less conservative value (1.43) than the 1.23 used 
in the NO16966 study (Cassidy et al., 2008). Therefore, a post-hoc analysis was performed showing that 
the hazard ratio [95% confidential interval] of SOX to CapeOX in PFS of 0.79 [0.60, 1.04] would meet 
the primary endpoint even if the analysis was carried out using a non-inferiority margin of 1.23. 
For the secondary endpoint of OS, the hazard ratio [95%CI] of SOX to CapeOX was 0.86 [0.68, 1.08]. 
No statistical difference was recorded in the median number of oxaliplatin cycles between the two groups 
(p=0.16). 31 patients in the SOX group entered into maintenance chemotherapy (median duration of 
maintenance 3.7 months, IQR 1.4–6.9 [S-1 alone for eight cycles]) and 20 patients in the CapeOX group 
entered into maintenance chemotherapy (2.3 months, 0.5–4.8 [capecitabine alone for five cycles]). 
At the cut-off date for data collection (Aug 31, 2011), study treatments had been discontinued in 161 
patients in the SOX group and 161 patients in the CapeOX group; median follow-up was 20.6 months 
(IQR 12.0–29.4). In the SOX group, PFS at 15 months was 38.7% (95% CI 31.3–46.1) and the median 
PFS was 8.5 months (7.6–9.3); the corresponding values in the CapeOX group were 32.2% (25.2–39.2) 
and 6.7 months (6.2–7.1; intention-to-treat analysis; Table 10 and Figure 10). The HR comparing PFS 
between the two groups was 0.79 (95% CI 0.60–1.04, p non-inferiority<0.0001, p log-rank=0.09), and 
the upper limit of the CI was below the predefined margin of 1.43. Non inferiority was also shown in the 
per-protocol analysis (Table 10). 
In  both  the  intention-to-treat  population  and  per-protocol  population,  median  TTF  was  statistically 
significantly  longer  in  the SOX  group  than it  was  in the  CapeOX  group,  but  no  statistically  significant 
difference between groups were recorded when comparing overall survival (Table 10 and Figure 10). 
Of 340 randomized patients, 310 patients with measurable lesion(s) were included in the assessment of 
objective  responses.  Overall  objective  response  in  both  the  intention-to-treat  and  per-protocol 
population was greater in the SOX group than it was in the CapeOX group (Table 10). No statistically 
significant difference in disease control rate was recorded in either the ITT or per-protocol population 
(Table 10).

Overall completion of the quality-of-life questionnaire for comparisons between baseline and final visits 
were  >80%  for  both  groups.  No  statistically  significant  differences  were  recorded  between  the  two 
groups with respect to changes in global health status or functioning and symptom scales (see appendix 
Hong et al., 2012). 
Of 325 patients, 215 (66%) received further treatment after SOX or CapeOX (Figure 9). No statistically 
significant  differences  were  observed  between  the  SOX  group  and  the  CapeOx  group  in  terms  of  the 
proportion  of  patients  who  received  all  three  cytotoxic  agents  (irinotecan,  oxaliplatin,  and  S-1  or 
capecitabine)  during  the  whole  treatment  period  (98  [60%]  of  164  patients  vs  104  [65%]  of  161 
patients), or in terms of those subsequently given bevacizumab (10 [6%] of 164 patients vs eight [5%] 
of 161 patients) or cetuximab (27 [17%] of 164 patients vs 32 [20%] of 161 patients). 
In the publication of Kim et al., 2014, updated data were provided. The updated data were collected at 
the cut-off date of December 24, 2013. Median follow-up was 17.91 months in the SOX group and 16.41 
months in the CapeOX group. Updated efficacy outcomes are shown in the table and figures below (Table

Study participants 
The  SOFT  study  was  an  open-label,  non-inferiority,  randomised  phase  2  trial of  SOX/bevacizumab  vs 
mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab for first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in 82 centers in Japan. 
Individuals who met eligibility criteria were enrolled: age 20–80 years; histologically proven colorectal 
adenocarcinoma; curatively unresectable, advanced, or recurrent colorectal cancer; ECOG performance 
status of 0 or 1; presence of assessable lesions as confirmed by CT or MRI; no previous chemotherapy 
or radiotherapy; could take drugs orally; leucocyte count of 3–12×10⁹ per L; neutrophil count at least 
1.5×10⁹  per  L;  platelet  count  at  least 100×10⁹  per L;  haemoglobin  concentration  of  at  least  90 g/L; 
total serum bilirubin concentration of no more than 34.21 μmol/L; serum aspartate aminotransferase 
con centration of no more than 100 U/L, or no more than 200 U/L in patients with hepatic metastasis; 
serum creatinine concentration of no more than 106.08 μmol/L; creatinine clearance of at least 1 mL/s; 
urinary protein score of no more than 1+; and an international normalised ratio of no more than 1.5. 
Patients were excluded if they had active infection, serious concurrent disease, substantially impaired 
cardiac function, gastrointestinal ulcers or bleeding, sensory neuropathy, serious diarrhoea, a history of

gastrointestinal  perforation  in  the  6  months  before  enrolment,  a  history  of  thromboembolism  or 
interstitial pneumonia, or a history of haemoptysis. Patients were also excluded if they had previously 
or were presently receiving oxaliplatin-based regimens as adjuvant chemotherapy. 
When  299  patients  had  been  enrolled,  enrolment  was  temporally  discontinued  because  four  patients 
receiving  SOX  plus  bevacizumab  had  gastrointestinal  perforation.  In  accordance  with  the 
recommendation  of  the  independent  data  monitoring  committee,  other  exclusion  criteria  were  then 
added:  the  presence  of  a  primary  lesion  associated  with  severe  stricture,  precluding  passage  of  an 
endoscope; and substantial peritoneal metastasis as confirmed on imaging studies. Enrolment was then 
resumed. 
The trial is registered with the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center, number JapicCTI-090699. 
• 
Treatments 
On  day  1  of  each  2-week  chemotherapy  cycle,  patients  assigned  to  mFOLFOX6  plus  bevacizumab 
received a 5 mg/kg intravenous infusion of bevacizumab (30–90 min) and a simultaneous intravenous 
infusion of 85 mg/m2 oxaliplatin (2 h), 200 mg/m2 l-leucovorin (2 h), 400 mg/m2 bolus fluorouracil, 
and 2400 mg/m2 infusional fluorouracil (46 h) delivered with an infusion pump. On day 1 of each 3-week 
cycle, patients assigned to receive SOX plus bevacizumab received a 7.5 mg/kg intravenous infusion of 
bevacizumab (30–90 min), followed by an intravenous infusion of 130 mg/m2 oxaliplatin (2 h). S-1 was 
taken orally twice daily from after dinner on day 1 to after breakfast on day 15, followed by a 7-day rest. 
The dose of S-1 was assigned according to body surface area: patients with a body surface area of less 
than 1.25 m2 received 80 mg/day; those with a body surface area of between 1.25 m2 and less than 
1.5  m2  received  100  mg/day;  and  those  with  a  body  surface  area  of  at  least  1.5  m2  received  120 
mg/day. Cycles were repeated for each patient until the criteria for withdrawal of the study treatment 
were met. In view of the neurological toxicity of oxaliplatin, treatment could be skipped when patients 
had received at least 600 mg/m2 overall, even when no grade 3 toxic effects were recorded. If patients 
had grade 2 or higher proteinurea or grade 2 or higher bleeding before the scheduled starting day of 
each  cycle,  they  received only  mFOLFOX6  or  SOX;  treatment  with  bevacizumab  could  be  resumed  in 
subsequent  cycles  if  treatment  criteria  were  satisfied.  Additionally,  investigators  decided  not  to  give 
bevacizumab to some patients to minimise the risk of bleeding immediately after port placement. 
In both treatment groups, the dose of cytotoxic drugs (fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and S-1) was reduced 
by one level if the neutrophil count was less than 0.5×10⁹ per L at any time during a cycle, the neutrophil 
count  was  less  than  1.5×10⁹  per  L  on  the  first  day  of  a  cycle,  grade  3  or  higher  febrile  neutropenia 
developed, or the platelet count was less than 50×10⁹ per L. In the event of grade 3 or higher diarrhoea, 
the dose of fluorouracil or S-1 was reduced by one level. If the platelet count was between 50×10⁹ and 
75×10⁹ per L at any time during a cycle, or between 75×10⁹ and 100×10⁹ per L on the first day of a 
cycle, the oxaliplatin dose was reduced by one level. S-1 was withheld when the neutrophil count was 
less than 1×10⁹ per L; the platelet count was less than 75×10⁹ per L; the serum creatinine concentration 
was at least 132.6 μmol/L; suspected infection was diagnosed with a fever of at least 38°C; or diarrhoea, 
mucositis,  or  stomatitis  of  grade  2  or  higher  developed.  S-1  was  subsequently  reinitiated  when  the 
neutrophil  count  was  at  least  1×10⁹  per  L;  the  platelet  count  was  at  least  75×10⁹  per  L;  the  serum 
creatinine concentration was less than 132.6 μmol/L; no fever of 38°C or higher suggesting infection 
was evident; and diarrhoea, mucositis, and stomatitis were no higher than grade 1.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The SOFT study was a non-inferiority study of SOX/bevacizumab vs mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab for first-
line treatment of 512 patients with mCRC in Japan. The primary endpoint of the SOFT study was PFS 
with a pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 1.33. The primary endpoint PFS was defined as the interval 
from the date of enrolment to the date on which progressive disease was first confirmed or the date of 
death  from  any  cause,  whichever  came  first.  Lesions  were  measured  every  8  weeks  with  diagnostic 
imaging (e.g., CT or MRI). Progressive disease was assessed solely by the investigator in charge of the 
patient.  Progressive  disease,  defined  as  a  greater  than  20%  increase  in  the  sum  of  the  longest 
dimensions of target lesions from baseline, was included in assessment of disease progression for target 
lesions. Exacerbation of underlying disease and appearance of new lesions (a clinical diagnosis of distinct 
disease progression) was included in assessment of disease progression for new non-target lesions. In 
a sensitivity analysis, we also calculated PFS on the basis of progressive disease assessed according to 
RECIST; version 1.0. 
Secondary endpoints were OS (interval from the date of enrolment to the date of death from any cause 
or last follow-up), TTF (interval from the date of enrolment to the date of a  PFS event or withdrawal 
from  the  study  for  any  reason),  proportion  of  patients  achieving  a  response,  proportion  of  patients 
achieving disease control (a complete or partial response or stable disease), proportion of patients having 
a curative resection, and adverse events. Attending physicians assessed response according to RECIST 
(version 1.0). After initiation of study treatment, target and non-target lesions were assessed every 8 
weeks in the same way as at baseline, with the same imaging conditions (e.g., contrast media and slice 
thickness). The best overall response was identified. Because the primary endpoint was PFS, response 
was not confirmed, in accordance with RECIST (version 1.0). Adverse events were graded according to 
CTCAE. Data for lactate dehydrogenase concentrations, whether disease was unresectable or recurrent 
at diagnosis, and disease stage at the time of surgery were not obtained. 
• 
Sample size 
On the basis of results of previous studies, the median PFS associated with mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab 
was estimated to be about 10 months. The study coordinating committee deemed that a median PFS 
with SOX plus bevacizumab that was 2.5 months shorter than that with mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab 
would be acceptable as the lower margin for inferiority, which corresponded to a non-inferiority HR of 
1.33. The required number of progression events was estimated to be 388. With a two-sided α of 0.05 
and a power of 80%, 250 patients would be needed in each group to achieve the required number of 
events by 1.5 years after enrolment of the last patient (3.5 years after initiation of the study). 
• 
Randomisation 
Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab or SOX plus 
bevacizumab.  Randomisation  was  done  centrally  with  the  minimisation  method, with  stratification  by 
institution  and  whether  postoperative  adjuvant  chemotherapy  had  been  given.  To  ensure  allocation 
concealment,  a  minimisation  algorithm  with  an  80:20  random  element  was  used.  The  randomisation 
sequence was generated by a team (EPS Corporation, Tokyo, Japan; independent from the trial sponsor 
and investigators) who used a validated computer system. Local investigators used a web-based system 
during enrolment, which then automatically assigned patients to treatment groups.

individuals  who  underwent  randomisation  but  who  were  subsequently  shown  not  to  meet  inclusion 
criteria were excluded. A per-protocol sensitivity analysis of PFS was also performed. Time-dependent 
events were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. HRs and their CIs were calculated with the Cox 
proportional-hazards model, adjusted for whether postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy had been given 
and  the  treatment  groups  as  covariate.  CIs  for  median  PFS  were  calculated  with  Brookmeyer  and 
Crowly’s method. The follow-up periods for PFS and OS were calculated separately for censored patients 
only. Additionally, interaction tests were done to assess the treatment effects by baseline characteristics, 
such as history of adjuvant chemotherapy. 
Patients who received at least one dose of the assigned study drugs were included in analyses of dose 
intensity  and  safety.  For  bevacizumab,  body  weight  instead  of  body  surface  area  was  used  as  is 
recommended  by  the  manufacturer.  For  the  calculation  of  relative  dose  intensity  and  dose  delays  or 
modifications, up to 24 cycles of mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab and 16 cycles of SOX plus bevacizumab 
were included. All statistical analysis was done in SAS (version 9.2).

The cutoff date for primary analysis of the primary endpoint was June 30, 2012. One patient assigned 
to receive mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab was identified as not having a colorectal adenocarcinoma after 
randomisation and was for that reason excluded from primary analyses.

Outcomes and estimation 
Median PFS was 11.5 months (95% CI 10.7-13.2) for mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab and 11.7 months (95% 
CI 10.7-12.9) for SOX/bevacizumab (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.86-1.27; less than the non-inferiority margin 
of 1.33; p noninferiority=0.014). These data also met a non-inferiority margin of 1.23 for PFS in post-
hoc analysis. 
In  an  updated  analysis  of  the  secondary  endpoint  of  OS,  HR  [95%CI]  of  SOX/bevacizumab  to 
mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab was 1.018 [0.823, 1.258] (median OS: 29.6 months vs. 29.7 months) at the 
final cut-off date. The survival curves are shown in Figure 15. 
Figure 15. OS results SOFT trial (Baba et al., 2017) 
Median follow-up for the PFS analysis was 18.4 months (IQR 13.1–24.9), and 413 events were confirmed 
during this period. In addition to the ITT PFS results reported above (see also Figure 16), results in the 
per-protocol analysis were described: PFS was 11.5 months (95% CI 10.4–13.2) in the group assigned 
to  mFOLFOX6  plus  bevacizumab  and  11.5  months  (10.6–12.7)  in  the  group  assigned  to  SOX  plus 
bevacizumab (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.86–1.27, p non-inferiority=0.015). Median PFS based on RECIST was 
shorter  than  that  solely  based  on  investigator  discretion,  but  non-inferiority  was  confirmed  (p  non-
inferiority=0.0057; Figure 16). In the subgroup analysis of PFS, no significant interactions were recorded 
between the assigned regimen and any factors (Figure 17). 
After a median follow-up of 23.4 months (IQR 19.5–29.6), 105 patients (41%) assigned to mFOLFOX6 
plus bevacizumab had died (98 because of progressive disease, 2 because of other diseases, 3 because 
of other reasons, 2 for unknown reasons) as had 109 (43%) assigned to SOX plus bevacizumab (102 
because  of  progressive  disease,  4  because  of  other  diseases,  1  because  of  other  reasons,  and  2  for 
unknown reasons). Median overall survival did not differ between groups (Figure 16).

Figure 17. Subgroup analysis of PFS SOFT trial 
In the group assigned to mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab, 146 patients (63%) had a complete or partial 
response and 208 (89%) achieved disease control (7 achieved complete response, 139 partial response, 
62 stable disease). In the group assigned to SOX plus bevacizumab, 144 patients (62%) had a complete 
or partial response and 209 (89%) achieved disease control (4 achieved complete response, 140 partial 
response, 65 stable disease). 22 patients (9%) assigned to mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab and 24 (9%) 
assigned to SOX plus bevacizumab underwent curative resection after completion of first-line treatment 
(p=0.77). Four patients in the group assigned to SOX plus bevacizumab and nine in the group assigned 
to  mFOLFOX6  plus  bevacizumab  had  progressive  disease.  16  patients  in  the  group  assigned  to 
mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab and 21 in the group assigned to SOX plus bevacizumab were not assessed. 
Median time to treatment failure was 6.7 months (95% CI 5.9–7.6) in patients assigned to mFOLFOX6 
plus bevacizumab and 6.2 months (5.7–7.1) in those assigned to SOX plus bevacizumab. 
Treatment had been discontinued at data cutoff in 247 patients given mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab and 
246  given  SOX  plus  bevacizumab.  A  few  reasons  for  discontinuation  of  treatment  were  recorded: 
progressive  disease  (95  [38%]  of  the  247  given  mFOLFOX6  plus  bevacizumab;  93  [38%]  of  the  246 
given SOX plus bevacizumab); investigators judged surgery to be possible because of tumour shrinkage 
(25 [10%]; 28 [11%]); and requests from patients and adverse events (127 [51%]; 125 [51%]). 188 
patients given mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab and 198 given SOX plus bevacizumab received second-line 
treatment.  Irinotecan  was  used  as  second-line  treatment  in  122  (65%)  of  the  188  patients  given

mFOLFOX6  plus  bevacizumab,  oxaliplatin  in  nine  (5%),  bevacizumab  in  70  (37%),  cetuximab  in  ten 
(5%), and panitumumab in nine (5%). Irinotecan was used in 116 (59%) of the 198 patients given SOX 
plus  bevacizumab,  oxaliplatin  in  23  (12%),  bevacizumab  in  67  (34%),  cetuximab  in  15  (8%),  and 
panitumumab in nine (5%). 
Due to the immaturity of the data reported by Yamada et al., 2013, updated data were published by 
Baba et al., 2017. As of September 30, 2013, the final cut-off date for data collection, median follow-up 
for the OS analysis was 37.7 months (range, 0.3–52.8). In the mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab group, 169 
patients (66.3%) had died. The causes of death were progressive disease in 161 patients, other diseases 
in 2 patients, other reasons in 3 patients and unknown in 3 patients. In the SOX plus bevacizumab group, 
174 patients (68.0%) were confirmed to have died. The causes of death were progressive disease in 165 
patients, other diseases in 5 patients, other reasons in 2 patients and unknown in 2 patients. In both 
groups combined, a total of 343 patients had died, representing an increase of 129 deaths as compared 
with the primary analysis. 
Median OS was 29.7 months (95% CI 26.5 to 33.1) in the mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab group and 29.6 
months (25.8–34.7) in the SOX plus bevacizumab group (HR, 1.018; 95% CI 0.823 to 1.258; p non-
inferiority=0.0133; Figure 15 as provided by MAH in clinical overview). Median OS did not differ between 
the  groups.  In  the  subgroup  analysis  of  OS,  a  significant  interaction  was  observed  between  assigned 
regimen and number of metastases (1 vs ≥2) (p=0.0247, HR in group with 1 metastasis 1.331 (95% CI 
0.967-1.832) vs HR in ≥2 metastases 0.811 (95% CI 0.610-1.077). When data collection was finally 
cut-off, the median follow-up for PFS analysis was 31.2 months (range, 0.0–51.6), and 465 events were 
confirmed.  Median  PFS  was  11.7  months  (95%  CI  10.9  to  13.3) in  the  mFOLFOX6  plus  bevacizumab 
group and 12.2 months (10.7–13.0) in the SOX plus bevacizumab group (HR, 1.051; 95% CI 0.876 to 
1.262;  p  non-inferiority=0.0115;  Figure  18).  The  response  rates  (62.7%  for  mFOLFOX6  plus 
bevacizumab, 61.5% for SOX plus bevacizumab) were similar to those in the primary analysis.

The waterfall plots represent the individual responses of target lesions evaluated according to RECIST in 
each group (Figure 19). At the first evaluation at 8 weeks, the number of patients with early tumour 
shrinkage (ETS) was 149 (65.9%) of 226 in the mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab group and 145 (64.2%) 
of 226 in the SOX plus bevacizumab group (p=0.6932). The median depth of response was 44.4% in 
the mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab group (230 patients) and 43.5% in the SOX plus bevacizumab group 
(231 patients).

• 
Treatments 
The mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab regimen consisted of bevacizumab (5mg/kg) given as an intravenous 
infusion on day 1 of each 2-week cycle, followed by a simultaneous intravenous infusion of oxaliplatin 
(85mg/m2) plus l-leucovorin (200mg/m2), an intravenous bolus 5-FU (400mg/m2), and a continuous 
intravenous  infusion  of  5-FU  (2400mg/m2).  The  CapeOX  plus  bevacizumab  regimen  consisted  of 
bevacizumab (7.5mg/kg) given as an intravenous infusion on day 1 of each 3-week cycle, followed by 
an intravenous infusion of oxaliplatin (130mg/m2). Capecitabine (1000mg/m2) was taken orally twice 
daily, from after dinner on day 1 to after breakfast on day 15, followed by a 7-day rest. The 3-week S-
1  and  irinotecan  plus  bevacizumab  regimen  consisted  of  bevacizumab  (7.5mg/kg)  given  as  an 
intravenous infusion on day 1 of each 3-week cycle, followed by an intravenous infusion of irinotecan 
(150mg/m2). S-1 (40mg/m2) was taken orally twice daily, from after dinner on day 1 to after breakfast 
on day 15, followed by a 7-day rest. The 4-week S-1 and irinotecan plus bevacizumab regimen consisted 
of bevacizumab (5mg/kg) given as an intravenous infusion on day 1 and day 15 of each 4-week cycle, 
followed by an intravenous infusion of irinotecan (100mg/m2). S-1 (40mg/m2) was taken orally twice 
daily, from after dinner on day 1 to after breakfast on day 15, followed by a 14-day rest. Cycles were 
repeated  for  each  patient  until  criteria  for  withdrawal  of  the  study  treatment  were  met.  For  the 
mFOLFOX6  plus  bevacizumab  and  CapeOX  plus  bevacizumab  regimens,  oxaliplatin-induced  sensory 
neuropathy  was  taken  into  consideration,  and  treatment  could  be  skipped  if  patients  had  received  at 
least 600mg/m2 of oxaliplatin overall.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of the TRICOLORE study was PFS with a pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 1.25. 
The primary endpoint PFS was defined as the period from the date of enrollment to the date of disease 
progression or of death from any cause without progression, whichever came first. Secondary endpoints 
were  OS,  TTF,  response  rate,  adverse  events,  QoL,  quality-adjusted  life  years  (QALYs),  cost-
effectiveness, and biomarker analysis. 
Tumour  assessment  by  means  of  diagnostic  imaging  was  carried  out  every  8  weeks,  and  tumour 
responses  were  assessed  according  to  RECIST  version  1.1.  Observed  adverse  events  were  evaluated 
according to CTCAE  v4.0.  QoL was assessed according to FACT-C TOI scale and FACT/GOG-Ntx scale 
before the start of treatment and at 16 and 24 weeks. 
• 
Sample size 
On the basis of the results of previous studies, the median PFS was estimated to be 11 months for the 
control  group  and  12  months  for  the  experimental  group  [hazard  ratio  (HR),  0.917].  Given  that  the 
permissible limit  for  the  HR  was  1.25,  with  a  statistical  power  of  85%,  an  alpha  level of  0.025  (one-
sided), an enrollment period of 36 months, and a follow-up period of 18 months for the primary end 
point of PFS, it was estimated that 434 patients would be required (required number of events, 374). To 
compensate for ineligible patients, the target number of patients was set at 450.

Randomisation 
Participants  were  randomly  assigned  (1:1) to  receive  either  mFOLFOX6  or  CapeOX  plus  bevacizumab 
(control group) or to receive either a 3-week or a 4-week regimen of S-1 and irinotecan plus bevacizumab 
(experimental group). Each participating institution could select either mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab or 
CapeOX  plus  bevacizumab  and  either  a  3-week  or  4-week  regimen  of  S-1  and  irinotecan  plus 
bevacizumab. After reporting to the data center (AC Medical Inc., Tokyo, Japan), patient enrollment was 
initiated.  Randomisation  was  performed  centrally  using  the  minimisation  method  with  the  following 
stratification  factors:  institution;  adjuvant  chemotherapy  (none,  including  oxaliplatin,  or not  including 
oxaliplatin); and the number of metastatic organs (0 or 1 versus ≥2).

Statistical methods 
The non-inferiority margin for post-hoc analysis of TRICOLORE was set based on previous evidence that 
showed that FOLFIRI is clinically equivalent to FOLFOX or CapeOX in terms of efficacy (i.e. the efficacy 
of irinotecan is equivalent to oxaliplatin for the first-line treatment of colorectal cancer) (Colucci et al., 
2005; Kozloff et al., 2009; Van Cutsem et al., 2009). Therefore, the post-hoc non-inferiority margin for 
the TRICOLORE study was set by the 50% effect retention method using the HR used in the EFC2962 
trial that compared FOLFOX vs infusional 5-FU (non-inferiority margin = 1.23 for PFS) (de Gramont et 
al., 2000). 
Noninferiority would be established if the upper limit of the 95% CI for the HR of the control group versus 
the experimental group was <1.25. If non-inferiority was demonstrated in the study, superiority would 
be  tested.  The  primary  analysis  was  conducted  using  the  full  analysis  set  on  an  ITT  basis.  Time-
dependent events were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. HRs and their CIs were calculated 
with Cox proportional-hazards models and adjusted for stratification factors (excluding institutions) and 
treatment  groups  as  covariates.  Patients  who  received  at least one  dose  of the  assigned  study  drugs 
were included in the analyses of dose intensity and safety. QoL analysis was conducted using data from 
patients  in  the  safety  analysis  population  for  whom  the  pretreatment  QoL  could  be  evaluated.  All 
statistical  analyses  were  carried  out  using  SAS,  version  9.4  (SAS  Institute,  Cary,  NC).  This  trial  is 
registered with UMIN-CTR (http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/) (000007834).

the  secondary  endpoint of  OS  was  0.86  (0.66,  1.13)  with  median  OS  rates of  34.9  months  and  33.6 
months, respectively. 
The median follow-up period was 32.4 months (range 1.5–46.6). During this period, PFS events occurred 
in  426  (88%)  of  484  patients  and  PFS  results  are  shown  in  Figure  21.  The  details  of  PFS  for  each 
chemotherapy regimen are given in Figure 22. In the subgroup analysis of PFS, significant interactions 
were observed between the allocated groups and age (Figure 23). Median TTF in the control group and 
the  experimental  group  was  7.7  months  (95%  CI  7.1–8.2)  and  9.6  months  (95%  CI  8.2–11.0), 
respectively (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59–0.85, p=0.0002; Figure 21). The response rate of target lesions 
was 70.6% in the control group and 66.4% in the experimental group (p=0.34; Table 14). The curative 
resection rate was 8.6% in the control group and 12.4% in the experimental group (p=0.17). OS analysis 
was conducted on the basis of 218 deaths (45%) among 484 patients and results are shown in Figure 
21. The p-value for OS was 0.2841.

Study participants 
The  FIRIS  study  was  a  phase  3  non-inferiority  study  of  IRIS  vs  FOLFIRI  for  second-line  treatment  of 
metastatic colorectal cancer. 
Inclusion  criteria  were  histologically  confirmed  colorectal  adenocarcinoma;  unresectable  metastatic 
disease; age 20–75 years; ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; withdrawal from first-line chemotherapy 
due to toxicity or progressive disease, or relapse within 24 weeks after the final dose of preoperative or 
postoperative  chemotherapy;  no  previous  treatment  with  irinotecan;  sufficient  oral  intake;  adequate 
organ function (white blood cell count 3000–12 000 cells per μL, platelet ≥100 000 per μL, aspartate 
aminotransferase  [AST]  ≤100  IU/L,  alanine  aminotransferase  [ALT]  ≤100  IU/L,  total  bilirubin  ≤25.7 
μmol/L [≤15 mg/L], and creatinine ≤106.1 μmol/L [≤12 mg/L]); and no abnormal electrocardiographic 
findings within 28 days before enrolment. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy or lactation; second non-
colorectal cancer; complications such as ileus, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or hypertension; severe 
diarrhoea;  clinically  evident  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage;  and  ascites  or  pleural  effusion  needing 
treatment. 
• 
Treatments 
Patients in the FOLFIRI group received concurrent folinic acid (200 mg/m2) and irinotecan (150 mg/m2) 
and then a bolus injection of fluorouracil (400 mg/m2) on day 1 and subsequent continuous infusion of 
fluorouracil (2400 mg/m2) over 46 h, repeated every 2 weeks (4 weeks counted as one cycle). In the 
FOLFIRI  group,  the  dose  of  irinotecan  was  150  mg/m2,  the  approved  dose  in  Japan. The  IRIS  group 
received irinotecan (125 mg/m2) on days 1 and 15 and S-1 (40 mg for patients with body surface area 
[BSA] <1.25 m2; 50 mg for patients with BSA 1.25<1.5 m2; 60 mg for patients with BSA ≥1.5 m2) 
twice daily for 2 weeks from days 1–14 and then a 2-week pause, on the basis of results of phase 2 
studies. This regimen was selected from several documented regimens of irinotecan and S-1 to match 
the  regimen  of  FOLFIRI  in  the  control  arm.  Regimens  in  which  irinotecan  is  given  every  2  weeks and 
every 3 weeks are in clinical use in Japan. 
In  both  FOLFIRI  and  IRIS  groups,  treatment  was  delayed  until  recovery  if  white  blood  cell  count  fell 
below than 3000 cells per μL, platelets fell below 100 000 per μL, AST or ALT were over 100 IU/L, total 
bilirubin was higher than 25.7 μmol/L, creatinine was higher than 106.1 μmol/L, the patient experienced 
diarrhoea of grade one or greater, or other non-haematological toxicities greater than grade two. If a 
patient experienced a grade four haematological or grade three or higher non-haematological toxicity, 
the dose was decreased by one level for the next course of treatment, and therapy was resumed.

Treatment was continued until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or patient’s refusal to continue 
treatment.  Because  molecularly  targeted  agents  such  as  bevacizumab,  cetuximab,  and  panitumumab 
were  not  approved  in  Japan  at  the  start  of  the  study,  no  restriction  for  such  agents  was  specifically 
placed on treatment before or after the study. 
• 
Objectives 
The primary objective of our study was to show non-inferiority of IRIS to FOLFIRI for progression-free 
survival in the whole randomised population. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of the FIRIS study was PFS with a pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 1.333. PFS 
was counted from the date of randomisation to the date when the progressive disease was first confirmed 
by  the  investigator’s  assessment.  For  patients  without  documented  progressive  disease,  data  was 
censored  on  the  date  of  the  last  tumour  assessment  with  non-progression  status.  OS  was  calculated 
from the date of randomisation to the date of death or confirmation of survival. Toxicity was evaluated 
on the basis of CTCAE version 3.0. 
Physical  examination,  electrocardiography,  performance  status,  and  laboratory  tests  were  done  at 
baseline  and  repeated  at  least  every  2  weeks  during  treatment.  Tumours  were  assessed  at  baseline 
(within 1 month before enrolment), and at 2, 3, and 4 months after enrolment, and thereafter every 2 
months until progression. Progression was defined as progressive disease on the basis of RECIST version 
1.0, clinical progression judged by the investigator, or death from any cause without progression. 
• 
Sample size 
On the basis of data from previous reports in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who received 
second-line chemotherapy, median PFS with both FOLFIRI and IRIS was assumed to be 4 months. The 
steering committee deemed that response assessment could not be repeated more frequently than once 
a  month,  so  a  difference  in  progression-free  survival  shorter  than  1  month  could  not  be  detected 
precisely. Thus, PFS with IRIS that was 1 month shorter than with FOLFIRI would be acceptable as a 
lower margin for inferiority, given the expected HR of 1.0. The 95% CI upper limit of the HR, calculated 
using Cox regression analysis with stratification factors other than institution, was prespecified as less 
than 1.333, meaning the null hypothesis was that median progression-free survival with IRIS would be 
1 month shorter than with FOLFIRI. Because 379 events were needed to show non-inferiority with a two-
sided α of 0.05 and a power of 80%, a target sample size of 400 patients was required. 
• 
Randomisation 
Investigators  provided  the  patient’s  details  to  the  central  registration  centre  through  a  web-based 
registration  system.  After  an  eligibility  check,  patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  receive  FOLFIRI or 
IRIS at the central registration centre by a computer program, by use of a minimisation method with 
stratification by institution, prior therapy (with or without oxaliplatin), and performance status (0 or 1). 
Assignment  of  patients  was  concealed  from  the  investigator.  Treatment  assignment  was  not  masked 
from the investigators or patients.

Statistical methods 
The  FIRIS  study  was  a  non-inferiority  study  of  IRIS  (Teysuno/Irinotecan)  vs  FOLFIRI  for  second-line 
treatment of mCRC. The primary efficacy analysis was done with all randomised patients. A per-protocol 
analysis in which patients in whom there was a major violation such as inclusion or exclusion criteria or 
protocol treatments were excluded was also performed. Safety was assessed in all patients who received 
at least one dose of the study drug. 
The primary endpoint was PFS. Secondary endpoints were OS, response rate, and toxicity. Subgroup 
analyses were done to establish whether therapeutic efficacy was affected by sex, age, histological type, 
performance  status,  and  prior  chemotherapy  with  or  without  oxaliplatin.  PFS  and  OS  were  estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method. The 95% CI for median PFS and OS was calculated using the method 
of  Brookmeyer  and  Crowley.  All  p  values  were two-sided.  All  statistical  analyses  were  done  with  SAS 
version 8.2. 
This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00284258.

Numbers analysed 
426 patients from 40 institutions in Japan were enrolled in the study from Jan 30, 2006, to Jan 29, 2008, 
and  randomised  either  to  the  FOLFIRI  or  IRIS  group  (213  patients  in  each;  Figure  25).  Of  the  per-
protocol population, 203 patients were in the FOLFIRI group and 198 were in the IRIS group; reasons 
for  exclusion  are  shown  in  Figure  25.  All  patients  who  received  study  treatment  (211  patients  in  the 
FOLFIRI group and 210 patients in the IRIS group) were included in the safety evaluation. 
• 
Outcomes and estimation 
Median PFS for IRIS was 5.8 months compared to 5.1 months for FOLFIRI. The hazard ratio [95% CI] 
for  IRIS  compared  to  FOLFIRI  for  PFS  was  1.077  [0.897,  1.319]  which  met  the  primary  endpoint  of 
noninferiority  (Muro  et  al.,  2010).  The  hazard  ratio  [95%CI]  of  IRIS  to  FOLFIRI  for  the  secondary 
endpoint of OS as was 0.900 [0.728, 1.112]. 
The mean number of cycles of protocol treatment was 4.7 (range 1–20) for FOLFIRI and 4.9 (1–23) for 
IRIS.  Treatments  were  discontinued  because  of  disease  progression  in  68.5%  (146  patients)  in  the 
FOLFIRI group and in 66.2% (141) in the IRIS group, adverse events in 10.8% (23) and in 16.9% (36), 
and patient’s refusal 1.9% (four) and 6.1% (13). 179 patients in the FOLFIRI group and 184 patients in 
the IRIS group needed a dose delay or dose reduction. Treatment after the trial (i.e., treatment after 
failure of second-line regimen) was given to 159 (74.6%) patients in the FOLFIRI group and 147 (69.0%) 
in the IRIS group. As third-line treatment, an oxaliplatin-containing regimen was given to 58 (27.2%) 
patients in the FOLFIRI and 63 (29.6%) in the IRIS group. Molecularly targeted agents as treatments 
after the trial were used in 24 patients in the FOLFIRI group and 16 in the IRIS group.

As of Dec 31, 2008, collection of PFS and OS data was cut off, with 389 confirmed events (194 FOLFIRI 
and 195 IRIS). Median follow-up was 12.9 months (IQR 11.5–18.2). Median PFS was 5.1 months in the 
FOLFIRI group and 5.8 months in the IRIS group. In the entire randomised population, the HR of PFS in 
the IRIS group compared with the FOLFIRI group was 1.077 (95% CI 0.879–1.319, p=0.039). Similar 
results were seen in the per protocol population: median PFS was 5.1 months in the FOLFIRI group and 
5.7 in the IRIS group (HR 1.050, 95% CI 0.851–1.294; Figure 26). 
The data on OS were preliminary according to Muro et al., 2010, because of short follow-up. 117 of the 
213 patients in the FOLFIRI group and 110 of the 213 patients in the IRIS group died due to any cause. 
Median OS in the entire randomised population was 18.2 months in the FOLFIRI group and 19.5 months 
in the IRIS group (HR 0.909, 95% CI 0.699–1.181; Figure 26). In the per protocol population, median 
OS was 18.1 months in the FOLFIRI group and 19.3 months in IRIS group (HR 0.896, 95% CI 0.685–
1.172). 
The overall response rate was 16.7% (one patient had a complete response, 28 patients had a partial 
response) of 174 patients with evaluable response data in the FOLFIRI group and 18.8% (one patient 
had a complete response, 33 patients had a partial response) of 181 in the IRIS group.

Figure 27 shows the results of subgroup analyses of PFS. Although no interaction was identified between 
sex, age, histological type, or performance status and therapeutic effects of IRIS compared with FOLFIRI, 
a statistically significant interaction was noted between prior chemotherapy (with or without oxaliplatin) 
and  therapeutic  effects  (p=0.030).  In  the  subgroup  of  patients  receiving  prior  chemotherapy  with 
oxaliplatin, median PFS was 5.7 months in the IRIS group and 3.9 months in the FOLFIRI group (adjusted 
HR  0.876,  95%  CI  0.677–1.133),  whereas  in  patients  without  prior  oxaliplatin  treatment  it  was  6.0 
months and 7.8 months, respectively (HR 1.490, 95% CI 1.079–2.059). A similar tendency was noted 
in the OS (Figure 28).

After the primary analysis, the follow-up survey was cut off on 29 July 2010, and the final OS data were 
analysed and reported by Yasui et al., 2015. At the final cutoff, 352 deaths (FOLFIRI, 178; IRIS, 174) 
were confirmed with a median follow-up of 39.2 months. A total of 125 censored cases resolved from 
the last cut-off reported. The median OS was 17.4 months in the FOLFIRI group and 17.8 months in the 
IRIS group (HR 0.900; 95% CI 0.728–1.112; p=0.003 for a non-inferiority margin of 1.333; Figure 29). 
In the PPS population, the median OS was 17.4 months in the FOLFIRI group and 17.4 months in the 
IRIS group (HR 0.905; 95 % CI 0.728–1.126). The Bayesian posterior probabilities that the HR of IRIS 
relative  to  FOLFIRI  would  be  <1.333  and  <1.15  were  calculated  to  be  >99.9  %  and  >98.7  %, 
respectively. For PFS, when the data collection was finally cut off, 412 events including an increase of 
23 events from the primary analysis were confirmed. The median PFS was 5.1 months in the FOLFIRI 
group and 5.8 months in the IRIS group. In the ITT population, the HR for IRIS to FOLFIRI was 1.058

(95% CI 0.869–1.289; p=0.022) and consistent with the primary analysis. In the PPS population, the 
median PFS was 5.1 months in the FOLFIRI group and 5.7 months in the IRIS group (HR 1.035; 95 % 
CI  0.843–1.271),  being  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis.  Regarding  subgroup  analyses  for  OS, 
except for the interaction of prior chemotherapy containing oxaliplatin (yes vs no) and therapeutic effect, 
no interaction was observed between sex (male vs female), age (<65 vs 65–75 years), histological type 
(adenocarcinoma, well differentiated vs moderately differentiated vs poorly differentiated), or PS (0 vs 
1), and the therapeutic effect of IRIS was comparable to that of FOLFIRI. In the subgroups of patients 
treated  with  FOLFIRI  (n=128)  or  IRIS  (n=129)  who  had  received  prior  chemotherapy  containing 
oxaliplatin, the median OS was 15.3 months in the IRIS group and 12.7 months in the FOLFIRI group 
(adjusted HR 0.755; 95% CI 0.580–0.983), showing better survival in the IRIS group than in the FOLFIRI 
group. On the other hand, in the subgroups of patients treated with FOLFIRI (n=85) or IRIS (n=84) who 
had received prior chemotherapy without oxaliplatin, the median OS was more favourable in the FOLFIRI 
group than in the IRIS group (26.9 vs. 23.6 months; adjusted HR 1.229; 95 % CI 0.866–1.745).

• 
Study participants 
A phase 1 study was performed to determine the schedule of a combination with S-1 plus oxaliplatin 
(SOX)  with  bevacizumab  in  a  European/Caucasian  population.  Patient  eligibility  criteria  required 
histologically  confirmed  advanced  or  metastatic  solid  tumour(s)  for  which  no  established  standard 
therapy existed at the time of the study. Patients had to be at least 18 years of age and able to take 
oral  medications.  Any  number  of  prior  therapies  for  metastatic  disease  was  allowed,  including  prior 
fluoropyrimidine  treatment;  however,  prior  oxaliplatin  was  excluded.  Only  patients  with  ECOG 
performance status of 0 or 1 were included. Adequate organ function [AST and ALT ≤ 2.5xULN, or 5xULN 
if liver metastasis was required; total bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN; calculated creatinine clearance 1 60 ml/min; 
absolute  granulocyte  count  ≥  1,500/mm3  ;  haemoglobin  ≥  9.0  g/dl;  platelet  count  6  100,000/mm3]. 
The  presence  of  measurable  disease  was  not  required.  Patients  not  yet  recovered  from  prior  cancer 
therapies  were  ineligible.  Any  known  hypersensitivity  to  5-FU,  bevacizumab  or  other  platinum 
compounds was cause for exclusion. 
• 
Treatments 
S-1 was administered orally (20 mg/m2) b.i.d. (with cohort escalation of 5 mg/m2) for 14 days with 
fixed dose bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg) and oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2) on day one of a 3-week cycle or at 
25 mg/m2 b.i.d. for 7 days (cohort escalation by 5 mg/m2) with fixed-dose bevacizumab 5 mg/kg and 
oxaliplatin (85 mg/m2) on day 1 of each 2-week cycle. 
Patients  received  either  schedule  A  or  B  of  S-1,  oxaliplatin  and  bevacizumab  in  a  non-randomized 
fashion. 
Schedule A. S-1 was provided by Taiho Pharma, USA, Inc., Princeton, N.J., USA, in capsules containing 
15 and 20 mg FT. S-1 was administered orally, twice daily for 14 consecutive days followed by a 7-day 
recovery period in a 21-day cycle. Patients were instructed to take S-1 1h before or at least 1h after a 
meal to avoid food effects. The actual S-1 doses for individual patients were calculated based on body 
surface area, and the number of capsules rounded as closely as possible to the calculated dose were 
dispensed.  Oxaliplatin  130  mg/m  2  and  bevacizumab  7.5  mg/kg  were  administered  intravenously  in 
fixed  doses  on  day  1  of  each  3-week  cycle.  Oxaliplatin  was  stopped  after  4  cycles  of  treatment.  A 
minimum of 3 patients were planned for enrollment in each dose level. The starting dose of S-1 in level 
1 was 20 mg/m 2 with a cohort dose escalation by 5 mg/m 2 increments. 
Schedule B. S-1 was administered orally, twice daily on day 1 for 7 consecutive days followed by a 7-
day  recovery  period  in  a  14-day  cycle.  Oxaliplatin  85  mg/m  2  and  bevacizumab  5  mg/kg  were 
administered intravenously in fixed doses on day 1 of each 2-week cycle. Oxaliplatin was stopped after 
6  cycles  of  treatment;  a  minimum  of  3  patients  were  planned  for  enrollment in  each  dose  level.  The 
starting dose of S-1 was 25 mg/m 2 , with a cohort dose escalation by 5 mg/m 2 increments. 
The  MTD  was  the highest dose  level  at  which  <33%  of  patients experienced  a  DLT  during the  first 2 
cycles for schedule A and the first 3 cycles for schedule B. Once the MTD was determined, an additional 
6–12 patients were to be treated at the same level.

Outcomes/endpoints 
All  AEs  were  collected  according  to  the  National  Cancer  Institute  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for 
Adverse Events version 3.0. A DLT that occurred during the first 2 cycles for schedule A and the first 3 
cycles for schedule B was defined as: grade >3 non-haematologic toxicity including nausea, vomiting 
and  diarrhoea  uncontrolled  by  aggressive  treatment,  febrile  neutropaenia,  grade  4  neutropaenia  or 
thrombocytopaenia, or any failure of the patient to take >80% of the planned S-1 treatment. The S-1 
doses as well as oxaliplatin were reduced or delayed if patients experienced unacceptable drug-related 
toxicity. 
Radiological evaluations were obtained at baseline and every 6 weeks thereafter during the course of 
the trial; however, if a patient responded, response confirmation was to be obtained through tumour 
assessments/scans at least 4 weeks after the first documentation of response. Tumour measurements 
and responses were determined according to RECIST criteria.

Baseline data 
Schedule  A.  Most  patients  (67%)  have  been  previously  treated  with  at  least  1  prior  chemotherapy 
regimen. Three patients were treated at the S-1 20-mg/m 2 dose level in combination with fixed doses 
of oxaliplatin and bevacizumab. Fourteen and 7 patients were treated at the S-1 25- and 30-mg/m 2 
dose levels, respectively, in combination with fixed doses of oxaliplatin and bevacizumab. A median of 8 
cycles has been initiated (range 1–40) (Table 16). 
Schedule B. Most patients (83%) have been previously treated with at least 1 chemotherapy regimen. 
Three patients were treated at the S-1 25- and 30- mg/m 2 dose levels. Twelve and 6 patients were 
treated  at  the  S-1  35-  and  the  40-mg/m  2  dose  levels,  respectively.  A  median  of  11  cycles  were 
completed (range 1–45) (Table 16).

Outcomes and estimation 
Of a total of 22 evaluable patients, a disease control rate of 83% was achieved with a median PFS of 7.2 
months [3.8-18.9], and a median OS of 16.9 months [10.3-26.9]. 
DLTs and MTD 
Schedule A. A total of 22 patients completed the first 2 cycles of study treatment and were assessed for 
DLT evaluation. Two patients were excluded from DLT evaluation due to inadequate supportive treatment 
of diarrhoea and non-compliance. Three patients in the 20 mg/m2 dose group and the first 3 patients in 
the 25 mg/m2 dose group experienced no DLTs. In the 30 mg/m2 dose group, 2 out of 6 patients treated 
experienced DLTs: 1 patient with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma experienced grade 3 diarrhoea 
on day 15 of cycle 2 despite aggressive antidiarrhoeal treatment, and 1 patient with recurrent metastatic 
undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma developed grade 3 mucositis after the first cycle, tolerating 
the  subsequent  dose  level  of  S-1  (25  mg/m2  )  without  toxicity.  The  next  3  patients  enrolled  in  the 
reduced 25 mg/m2 S-1 dose level tolerated therapy well without DLT. The 25 mg/m2 S-1 cohort was 
expanded with an additional 7 patients who tolerated therapy well without DLT. For Schedule A MTD was 
determined to be S-1 25 mg/m2 administered orally twice daily for 14 days followed by 7 days of rest 
in a 3-week cycle in combination with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab once every 3 weeks. 
Schedule B. All 24 patients completed the first 3 cycles of study treatment and were assessed for DLT 
evaluation. Three patients in each of the 25, 30 and 35 mg/m2 dose groups experienced no DLTs. Two 
of 6 patients in the 40 mg/m2 dose group developed DLTs (1 patient with grade 3 diarrhoea, fatigue, 
dehydration,  proteinuria,  nausea  and  vomiting,  and  1  patient  with  grade  4  neutropaenia,  grade  3 
diarrhoea,  rectal  bleeding  and  dehydration).  An  additional  9  patients  were  treated  in  the  35  mg/m2 
expansion cohort. Only 2 patients developed DLTs. One patient experienced grade 3 abdominal pain and 
another  patient  experienced  grade  3  diarrhoea.  Hence,  the  MTD  of  schedule  B  was  S-1  35  mg/m2 
administered in combination with 85 mg/m 2 oxaliplatin and 5 mg/kg bevacizumab once every 2 weeks. 
Anti-tumour activity (Table 17) 
Schedule A. The median numbers of cycles received were 11, 7 and 8 in 20, 25 and 30 mg/m2 dose 
groups, respectively. A total of 22 patients with at least 1 postbaseline imaging study were included in 
the tumour response evaluation. Of the total of 22 evaluable patients, 2 patients (9%) achieved a partial 
response  (PR),  17  patients  (74%)  had  stable  disease  (SD)  and  4  patients  (17%)  demonstrated 
progression of disease as the best response, corresponding to a disease control rate of 83%. Two patients 
with  PR  had  metastatic  gastroesophageal  junction  adenocarcinoma:  1  previously  treated  with  2  prior 
regimens and the other chemotherapy naïve. At the data cutoff, the calculated median PFS and OS in 
this  group  with  all  dose  levels  combined  was  7.2  months  (95%CI  3.8–18.9; n=23)  and  16.7  months 
(95%CI 10.3–26.9; n=23), respectively. 
Schedule B. The median numbers of cycles received were 32, 21, 9 and 7 in 25, 30, 35 and 40 mg/m2 
dose groups, respectively. A total of 24 patients with at least 1 post-baseline imaging study were included 
in the tumour response evaluation. Of the 24 evaluable patients, 8 patients (35%) achieved a PR, 10 
patients  (44%)  demonstrated  SD,  and  5  patients  (22%)  demonstrated  progressive  disease  as  best 
response, corresponding to a disease control rate of 78%. At the data cutoff, the calculated median PFS 
and OS for this schedule was 6.9 months (95% CI 2.8–15.0; n=23) and 11.1 months (95% CI 8.2–17.1; 
n=24), respectively.

chemotherapy (S-1 plus oxaliplatin) versus full-dose monotherapy (S-1) in older vulnerable patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer (NORDIC9): a randomised, open-label phase 2 trial. 
Methods 
• 
Study participants 
Patients  older  than  70  years  of  age  who  were  not  candidates  for  full-dose  combination  therapy  were 
included.  Eligible  patients  were  aged  70  years  or  older  and  had  histopathologically  proven  colorectal 
adenocarcinoma, non-resectable metastases, and a WHO performance status of 0–2. Participants had 
received  no  prior  chemotherapy  except  adjuvant  fluoropyrimidine  therapy  completed  more  than  180 
days before randomisation and had a life expectancy of at least 3 months. Additionally, haematological, 
liver,  and  renal  functions  had  to  be  within  normal  range;  glomerular  filtration  rate  (GFR)  had  to  be 
greater than 30 mL/min, bilirubin no higher than 1.5xULN, neutrophil cell count at least 1.5x10⁹ cells 
per L, and platelet count of at least 100x10⁹ per L. Furthermore, patients could not be candidates for 
standard full-dose combination chemotherapy as assessed by the treating physician. Exclusion criteria 
were  evidence  of  CNS  metastasis;  concurrent  history  of  malignant  neoplasm  other  than  colorectal 
adenocarcinoma  within  the  past  5  years;  peripheral  chronic  neuropathy;  current  history  of  chronic 
diarrhoea,  infection,  or  unresolved  bowel  obstruction;  or  contraindications  to  fluoropyrimidine—e.g., 
myocardial infarction within 6 months. All patients provided written informed consent before enrolment. 
• 
Treatments 
Patients  were  randomised  to  receive  full-dose  S-1  (30  mg/m2  b.i.d,  orally,  d1-14  every  3  weeks) 
followed  by  second-line  irinotecan  (250  mg/m2,  IV,  d1  every  3  weeks  or  180  mg/m2  IV,  d1  every  2 
weeks) at progression or reduced-dose Teysuno (20 mg/m2 b.i.d. d1-14 every 3 weeks) plus oxaliplatin 
(100 mg/m2 d1 every 3 weeks) followed by second-line treatment at disease progression with reduced 
dose  S-1  plus irinotecan  (180  mg/m2  d1 every  3  weeks).  Addition of  bevacizumab  was  optional  (7.5 
mg/kg IV d1 every 3 weeks). 
In either group, the S-1 dose was reduced by 5 mg/m² in patients with GFR of 30–49 mL/min. If dose 
reduction  was  needed  during  treatment  due  to  toxicity,  the  S-1  dose  was  reduced  by  5  mg/m²  and 
oxaliplatin or irinotecan were reduced by 25%.

The  protocol  recommended  treatment  until  progression,  unacceptable  toxicity,  or  patients’  wish  for  a 
treatment  break.  In  case  of  progressive  disease  during  a  treatment  break,  treatment  could  be  re-
introduced. Due to potential treatment breaks before the time of progressive disease, the decision was 
made  to  calculate  dose  intensity  for  S-1  and  oxaliplatin  after  nine  treatment  cycles.  Second-line 
treatment according to the protocol was offered after progression of disease on first-line treatment and 
continued until progression on second-line treatment. 
• 
Objectives 
The NORDIC9 trial was designed to evaluate whether dose-reduced combination therapy with S-1 and 
oxaliplatin improves efficacy and is as tolerable as full-dose monotherapy with S-1 in older (>70 years 
of  age)  and  vulnerable  patients  with  metastatic  colorectal  cancer.  Furthermore,  it  was  assessed  if 
geriatric screening tools administered at baseline can predict efficacy and toxicity of the treatments. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was PFS and secondary endpoints included OS, response, toxicity, QoL, and time 
to failure of strategy. The primary endpoint PFS was calculated from the date of randomisation to the 
first date of radiological or clinical progression on first-line treatment, time of death, or censored on the 
cutoff date. Secondary endpoints were OS, defined as deaths of all causes or censored at cutoff date; 
proportion  of  patients  achieving  investigator-evaluated  response;  toxicity;  quality  of  life;  and  time  to 
failure of strategy, calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of progression on planned first-
line  and  second-line  treatment.  If  treatment  was  re-introduced  after  progressive  disease  during  a 
treatment break, the last date for progressive disease in first-line treatment was used to calculate time 
to  failure  of  strategy  for  first-line  treatment.  Correlations  between  pretreatment  characteristics  or 
geriatric screening tool results and efficacy (PFS and OS) and toxicity (at least one grade 3–4 adverse 
event, hospitalisation, or receiving no more than one cycle or fewer than three cycles of treatment) were 
evaluated. 
Toxicity  was  evaluated  after  each  chemotherapy  cycle  and  graded  by  NCI-CTCAE  version  4.0.  Nadir 
haematology was measured on days 10–14 after the first cycle and when indicated. CT scans and clinical 
evaluations were performed every three cycles until progression. Achievement of objective response and 
date of progression were determined by the local investigator according RECIST 1.1. Quality of life was 
assessed  by  the  European  Organization  for  Research  and  Treatment  of  Cancer  Quality  of  Life 
Questionnaire 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) at baseline and after three and six treatment cycles. 
• 
Sample size 
In the power calculation, it was estimated that monotherapy without bevacizumab would result in PFS 
of 4 months whereas the addition of bevacizumab would increase this to 8 months. It was anticipated 
that 50% of the patients would be offered bevacizumab; thus it was estimated that median PFS in the 
full-dose monotherapy group would be 6 months. If median PFS for the reduced-dose combination group 
is 9 months, at least 71 individuals were needed to be treated in the experimental arm and 71 in the 
control arm to reject the null hypothesis that the experimental and control survival curves are equal with 
a  power  of  80%  and  a  type  I  error  probability  of  0.2.  There  was  no  adjustment  for  expected  loss  to 
follow-up or dropouts. 
• 
Randomisation 
Patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  sequential  full-dose  monotherapy  (S-1  followed  by  irinotecan 
monotherapy at progression) or sequential dose-reduced combination chemotherapy (S-1 and oxaliplatin 
followed  by  S-1  and  irinotecan  at  progression).  Bevacizumab  was  optional  in first-line  therapy  at  the

discretion of the treating physician but the decision had to be made before randomisation. Patients were 
randomly assigned (1:1) with block sizes of ten, eight, or four using a web-based tool managed by a 
statistical third part provider (OPEN randomise). Randomisation was stratified by institution and planned 
treatment with bevacizumab. Only trained study nurses at the Data Centre (Odense University Hospital) 
had  access  to  the  electronic  randomization  system.  They  communicated  the  randomisation  to  the 
investigator of the institution who wished to include a patient, when inclusion and exclusion criteria were 
checked and registration papers approved.

Statistical methods 
Categorical binary variables were compared with Fisher’s exact test or χ² test (depending on the number 
of observations) and ordinal variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. OS and PFS curves 
were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, with comparisons between treatment arms done by the 
log-rank test in the intention-to-treat population (consisting of all randomised patients). Hazard ratios 
(HRs) and corresponding 95% CIs were estimated by Cox proportional hazard regression. HRs adjusted 
for treatment with bevacizumab but not for institutions were also calculated. Cox regression (for PFS 
and OS) and logistic regression (for grade 3–4 adverse events, number of cycles, and hospitalisations) 
were used for univariable analyses with respect to pretreatment characteristics and geriatric screening 
results.  A  multivariable  model  used  clinically  relevant  covariates  defined  in  advance  (treatment  arm, 
addition  of  bevacizumab,  performance  status,  number  of  metastatic  sites,  and  resection  of  primary 
tumour) and covariates with p-values of less than 0.10 in univariable analyses. The number of covariates 
took  into  consideration  the  number  of  observations.  For  Cox  regression,  the  proportional  hazards 
assumptions were tested based on Schoenfeld residuals, and for logistic regression the goodness-of-fit 
test  was  performed.  Toxicity  and  treatment-related  characteristics  were  assessed  in  all  patients  who 
received  treatment.  An  interim  safety  analysis  focusing  on  toxicity  and  dose  intensity  was  performed 
when the first 50 patients had received three cycles. In all analyses, a two-tailed p value of less than 
0.05 was deemed statistically significant. Statistical analyses were done in Stata version 15.1.

Recruitment 
A total of 160 patients were randomised and 157 received treatment. Patient recruitment was done in 
23  oncology  clinics  in  four  Nordic  countries:  Denmark,  Finland,  Norway,  and  Sweden.  From  March  9, 
2015,  to  Oct  11,  2017,  160  patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  full-dose  monotherapy  (n=83)  or 
reduced-dose  combination  chemotherapy  (n=77;  Figure  30).  Two  patients  did  not  start  treatment 
because of adverse events, and one patient was excluded due to other cancer; therefore, toxicity and 
treatment-related characteristics were analysed for 157 patients.

Outcomes and estimation 
With a median follow-up of 23.8 months (IQR 18.8-30.9) PFS was 5.3 months (95% CI 4.1-6.8) in the 
full-dose group compared to 6.2 months (95% CI 5.3- 8.3) in the reduced-dose combination therapy 
group (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52-0.99, p=0.047) (Figure 31).

Figure 31. PFS NORDIC9 trial 
Median time to failure of strategy was 6.7 months (95% CI 5.29-10.8) in the full-dose group and 10.5 
months (95% CI 8.61-12.7) in the reduced dose combination therapy group (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52–
1.04; p=0.085). Median OS was 11.5 months (95% CI 8.7-15.9) in the full-dose monotherapy group 
compared to 14.5 months (95% CI 12.1- 20.8 in the reduced-dose combination therapy group (HR 0.82, 
95% CI 0.57-1.19, p=0.302) (Figure 32).

Most patients who had a treatment break of at least 2 months had first-line treatment reintroduced. 85 
(63%)  of  136  patients  who  discontinued  first-line  treatment  started  second-line  treatment,  of  whom 
seven (8%) did not receive therapy according to the protocol. Among those who discontinued first-line 
treatment, a greater proportion of patients in the reduced-dose combination group started second-line

treatment than in the full-dose monotherapy group (44 [70%] of 63 patients vs 41 [56%] of 73 patients; 
p=0.100). 
Median follow-up was 23.8 months (IQR 18.8–30.9). At data cutoff, 81 (98%) patients in the full-dose 
monotherapy group and 71 (92%) patients in the reduced-dose combination group had progressed or 
died. At the cutoff date 114 (71%) patients had died. PFS results are shown above. The difference in 
PFS  was  enhanced  when  adjusted  for  treatment  with  bevacizumab  (0.69,  0.50–0.95;  p=0.025).

Median time to failure of strategy is reported above. Owing to the use of treatment breaks, the median 
time to failure of first-line treatment was calculated, resulting in a median time to failure of 6.0 months 
(4.2–8.2)  in  the  full-dose  monotherapy  group  and  7.4  months  (5.9–9.1)  in  the  reduced-dose 
combination group (0.77, 0.56–1.06; p=0.110). 
Median OS results are shown above. When adjusted for the use of bevacizumab, the HR was 0.82 (0.57–
1.19; p=0.298). At data cutoff, 51 patients had died during or after first-line treatment and 63 patients 
during or after second-line treatment. Exploratory subgroup analyses of OS are shown in Figure 34.

The proportion of patients achieving objective response with first-line treatment was numerically but not 
significantly higher in the reduced-dose combination group (42% [95% CI 30–55; 30 patients] vs 33% 
[23–45; 27 patients] in the full-dose monotherapy group; p=0.257). 
13  (8%)  patients  received  only  one  chemotherapy  cycle,  of  whom  nine  were  treated  with  full-dose

in  situ.  Of  the  nine  patients,  the  reason  for  ending  treatment  prematurely  was  mainly  toxicity  (six 
patients), but also colonic perforation (one) and progressive disease (two), whereas reasons for ending 
treatment prematurely after one cycle were more diverse in the reduced-dose combination group (one 
patient each for toxicity, perforation of rectum, ileus, and progressive disease).

cardiotoxicity on capecitabine- or 5-fluorouracil-based therapy in patients with solid tumours: a multi-
centre retrospective observational cohort study (manuscript draft). 
Methods 
• 
Study participants 
All identified patients with solid tumours experiencing grade 1-4 cardiotoxicity during fluoropyrimidine 
treatment,  who  were  switched  to  S-1-based  therapy  were  included.  Population-based  data  on  S-1 
treatment  was  available  for  Tampere  and  Helsinki  university  hospitals,  and  for  colorectal  cancers  in 
Turku, and cases were included if switch due to cardiotoxicity was the indication. Further, patients with 
switch  due  to  cardiotoxicity  in  the  RAXO  study  (NCT01531621)  were  included.  Additional  cases  were 
retrospectively  identified  and  included  from  the  other  participating  institutions.  The  total  number  of 
patients receiving fluoropyrimidines at all participating centres could not be extracted. Data collected at 
baseline  included  patient  characteristics,  cardiovascular  comorbidities,  current  medications  (with 
anatomical therapeutic chemical [ATC] code), cardiac evaluations, cardiac treatment, cardiotoxicity on 
first  treatment  and  recurrence  on  S-1-based  therapy,  previous  and  concurrent  cancer  therapies. 
Clinically  meaningful  non-cardiac  adverse  events  included  haematologic  toxicity  grade  3-4,  and  non-
haematologic toxicity grade 2-4. 
• 
Treatments 
Included  patients  were  switched  to  S-1-based  therapy  after  cardiotoxicity  during  fluoropyrimidine 
treatment. 
• 
Objectives 
The purpose of the study was to evaluate cardiotoxicity during re-challenge of a different modality of 
fluoropyrimidine  (primary  end-point  S-1  and  secondary  any  other  fluoropyrimidine)  after  having 
perceived  cardiotoxicity  with  a  fluoropyrimidine  based  regimen  previously.  The  patient  population  is 
being treated for solid tumours. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  was  recurrence  of  cardiotoxicity  after  switch  to  S-1-based  treatment  from  any 
other fluoropyrimidine due to cardiotoxicity. Secondary endpoints were cardiac symptoms and alteration 
in cardiac functional parameters during fluoropyrimidine therapy; diagnostic work-up for cardiotoxicity 
in real-world practice; timelines for cardiotoxicity and dose intensity. 
• 
Sample size 
No power calculation was performed. The data cut-off for inclusion was October 7, 2020, upon reaching 
the per protocol target of 200 patients.

Statistical methods 
The primary endpoint was recurrent cardiotoxicity after switch to S-1-based treatment. The cumulative 
incidence with its 95% CI was calculated in a competing risks analysis, where first onset of recurrent 
cardiotoxicity was the event of interest and stopping of S-1 without recurrent cardiotoxicity a competing 
risk. 
Worst grade of cardiotoxicity is presented if multiple events were present. Continuous characteristics are 
presented as median with range and interquartile range (IQR). Systematic missing information for Dutch 
patients (n=28) included ECOG PS, some comorbidities, and survival. Missing values were not imputed. 
Demographic  variables  were  screened  for  associations  with  the  crude  percentage  of  recurrent 
cardiotoxicity  with  Chi-square  tests  with  Bonferroni  correction  for  multiple  comparisons  (data  not 
shown),  and,  if  statistically  significant  differences  were  noted,  odds  ratios  (OR)  and  95%  CIs  were 
calculated using logistic regression. OS from initiation of S-1-based therapy to death of any cause or to 
end of follow-up was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Outcomes and estimation 
Please  refer  to  the  safety  section  for  the  safety  outcomes.  Regarding  efficacy,  median  OS  from  S-1 
initiation (n=170) of the patients with localised disease was not reached and was 22 months (95% CI 
16-28  months)  in  patients  with  metastatic  disease,  with  5-year  survival  rates  of  78%  and  10%, 
respectively (Figure 35). The largest subgroup with colorectal primary (n=133) had a median OS of not 
reached in localised disease and 26 months (95% CI 22-31) in metastatic disease with 5-year survival 
rates of 83% and 12%, respectively (Figure 35).

Methods 
• 
Study participants 
Data  were  retrospectively  collected  from  patients  participating  to  the  Dutch  Prospective  Colorectal 
Cancer  Cohort  (PLCRC)  (Burbach  et  al.,  Acta  Oncol,  2016).  PLCRC  has  been  initiated  in  2015,  and  is 
since then being implemented in an increasing number of Dutch hospitals, with currently 59/80 Dutch 
hospitals  participating  and  more  than  10.000  patient  being  included  (www.plcrc.nl).  All  CRC  patients 
(stage I-IV) are eligible for inclusion in PLCRC, and patients give informed consent to register longitudinal 
clinical data and to use any further clinical data upon approval by the scientific board of PLCRC. Since 
more than 90% of patients who are informed on PLCRC give their informed consent, patients in PLCRC 
are considered to represent daily practice. PLCRC patients in whom S-1 was administered at any stage 
of disease were identified, and patients with mCRC in whom treatment was switched from capecitabine 
to S-1 were eligible. Patients were excluded in case they had been included two previous retrospective 
studies on a treatment switch from capecitabine to S-1 (Kwakman et al., Eur J Cancer, 2017; Kwakman 
et al., Acta Oncol, 2017). 
• 
Treatments 
The  starting  dose  of  capecitabine  was  either  1250  mg/m2  or  1000  mg/m2  when  given  as 
monochemotherapy, and 1000 mg/m2 when given in combination with oxaliplatin. The starting dose of 
S-1 was either 30 mg/m2 when given as monochemotherapy, and 25 mg/m2 when given in combination 
with oxaliplatin. 
The standard procedure for dose reductions for capecitabine is a first dose reduction to 75% of the initial 
dose and a second dose reduction to 50% of initial dose. Dose reductions are commonly performed upon 
the occurrence of grade ≥ 3 toxicity or by recurrence of grade 2. However, given the potential impact of 
prolonged grade 2 HFS on quality of life and daily activities, especially in elderly patients, a switch from 
capecitabine to S-1 was often performed at the occurrence of grade 2 HFS.

To conduct a retrospective analysis of safety data from mCRC patients in the Dutch PLCRC cohort who 
were switched to Teysuno after development of HFS or cardiotoxicity while on capecitabine. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Data were collected from June 1st 2016, and the cut-off date was June 15th 2021. Patients were followed 
from  the  first  administration  of  capecitabine  until  the  end  of  S-1  treatment  for  any  reason  (i.e. 
progression of disease, toxicity, watch-and-wait strategy). 
The electronic records of eligible patients were examined for the following items: patient characteristics 
(age,  gender,  height,  weight,  WHO  performance  status)  at  time  of  switch  to  S-1,  treatment  setting 
before  switch  to  S-1,  schedule  of  capecitabine-containing  regimen,  dates  of  first  and  last  dose  of 
capecitabine,  starting  dose  of  capecitabine,  dose  reduction  of  capecitabine,  and  if  so,  its  underlying 
reason, reason to switch to S-1, date of first dose and total number of cycles of S-1, dose reductions of 
S-1,  and  if  so,  its  underlying  reason,  reason  to  permanently  discontinue  S-1,  date  of  first  disease 
progression after S-1 administration, and any adverse event occurring during treatment of capecitabine 
and S-1 of which the maximal grade was recorded using CTC criteria (CTCAE version 5.0). Data were 
recorded from the start of treatment with capecitabine until the end of treatment with S-1.

Conduct of the study 
Patients gave informed consent to register longitudinal clinical data and to use any further clinical data 
upon approval by the scientific board of PLCRC. The study was approved by the scientific board of PLCRC. 
• 
Baseline data 
A  total  of  53  patients  were  identified  who  were  exposed  to  treatment  with  S-1.  Four  patients  were 
excluded since capecitabine was administered in the adjuvant setting, and two patients were excluded 
because their previous treatment did not contain capecitabine but continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil. 
Therefore 47 patients were eligible for further analysis. 
Patient characteristic are shown in Table 20. Patients were treated in 13 different Dutch hospitals. There 
were 25 males and 22 females, and at the time of switch to S-1 median age was 62 years (range 40-
84), and median WHO PS was 1 (0-2).

Outcomes and estimation 
Please refer to the safety section for the safety results. As stated by the authors, due to the relatively 
small  number  of  patients,  the  heterogeneity  of  treatment  schedules  and  the  varying  timepoints  of 
initiation  of  treatment  with  S-1,  this  cohort  does  not  allow  a  valid  assessment  of  clinical  outcome  in 
terms  of  progression-free  survival.  The  median  time  from  initiation  of  treatment  with  capecitabine  to 
first  documented  progression  of  disease  after  initiation  of  treatment  with  S-1  was  414  days  (95% 
confidence interval 332-568 days), which is in the upper range of outcomes as observed in clinical studies 
on first-line treatment with capecitabine-based regimens in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. 
Although this analysis does not allow assessment of efficacy, a switch to S-1 does not appear to have 
any detrimental effect on progression-free survival, according to the authors. 
When only the 36 patients who switched from capecitabine to S-1 for reason of HFS were considered, 
median duration of capecitabine treatment was 115 days (range 21-454), median time between end of 
capecitabine and start of S-1 treatment was 8 days (range 2-49), median number of S-1 cycles was 8 
(range 1-36), and median PFS was 414 days (95%CI: 332-629). 
Ancillary analyses 
Gimeracil and oteracil single agents 
No  clinical  data  are  available  for  gimeracil  and  oteracil  as  single  agents  as  they  have  never  been 
administered to humans, except when combined with tegafur in Teysuno. This was accepted previously 
for the MAA. 
Extrapolation of Asian efficacy data to Western patients 
The MAH discussed two published meta-analyses that have been conducted that concluded that Teysuno-
based regimens have similar efficacy with better tolerability than 5-FU- and capecitabine-based regimens 
in  Western  patients  and  in  Asian  patients  with  gastric  cancer  (Ter  Veer  et  al.,  2017;  Ter  Veer  et  al., 
2016). 
Subgroup analyses that compared Teysuno regimens to 5-FU regimens did not detect any differences in 
efficacy attributable to ethnicity (Figure 36) (Ter Veer et al., 2016).

Similarly,  a  network  meta-analysis  that  further  compared  Teysuno-based  regimens  to  5-FU  and 
capecitabine regimens, as well as comparing 5-FU to capecitabine regimens, concluded that this method 
of  indirectly  comparing  all  of  the  Asian  and  Western  Teysuno  studies  to  available  comparable 
fluoropyrimidine studies provides confidence that the Teysuno-, capecitabine-, and 5-FU-based regimens 
have equal efficacy in Asian and Western patients (Table 21) (Ter Veer, et al., 2017).

Supportive evidence for rationale posology S-1 in combination with irinotecan 
In addition to the study by Winther et al, 2019,  3 levels of supportive evidence for the posology of the 
S-1 and irinotecan combination: a study of older mCRC patients treated with S-1 (Winther et al., 2016), 
data  from  the  CardioSwitch  study  (Österlund  et  al.,  submitted),  and  clinical  experience  in  Nordic 
European countries. 
Publication Winther et al., Acta Oncologica, 2016 
In this study safety and efficacy of S-1 alone or in combination with oxaliplatin (SOx) or irinotecan (IRIS) 
in mCRC patients of 70 years or older was evaluated. A total of 18 patients received the combination 
IRIS, mainly administered as second- or later-line therapy for metastatic disease with a posology of S-
1 25 mg/m2 orally twice daily on days 1–14 with irinotecan 200 mg/m2 iv on day 1 every three weeks. 
The dose of irinotecan was higher than the applied for 180 mg/m2. 
In the IRIS subgroup, median age was 73 years and ten patients (56%) completed at least six cycles of 
therapy. Reasons for discontinuing chemotherapy included radiological PD (n=5) and toxicity/patient’s 
wish (n=2). Fifteen patients (83%) started with full dose therapy and three patients started with reduced 
dose IRIS (reduced dose in previous line n=2, comorbidity n=1). The median relative dose intensities 
for irinotecan and S-1 were 97% and 87%, respectively. 
In the IRIS group, PR was 28% based on investigator-assessed RECIST 1.1, median PFS was 7.8 months 
and the median OS 16.5 months. 
The  most  common  non-haematological  adverse  events  were  fatigue  (89%),  diarrhoea  (56%),  and 
nausea (44%). Adverse events were generally mild in nature with grade 3 diarrhoea being observed in 
11% of patients. One patient developed grade 1 HFS. Haematological adverse events were mild and one

patient (6%) developed febrile neutropaenia. 
Based on these data and knowledge gained from Asian studies with irinotecan, the authors recommend 
S-1 25 mg/m2 orally twice daily on days 1–14 with IRIS 200 mg/m2 iv on day 1 every three weeks in 
fit patients. 
CardioSwitch study (Österlund et al., submitted 2021) 
In the CardioSwitch trial 17 patients with solid tumours who were switched to Teysuno-based regimens 
after developing cardiotoxicity on another fluoropyrimidine-based regimen were treated with the IRIS 
combination:  12  patients  with  irinotecan  180-200  mg/m2  with  S-1  50  mg/m2  and  5  patients  with 
irinotecan 150-180mg/m2 and S-1 of 40 mg/m2 (of which 4 were frail or had renal impairment). The 
majority  of  patients  received  IRIS  on  this  21-day  schedule,  some  were  also  treated  with  a  28-day 
schedule. 
There were no concerns regarding the toxicity of the 21-day regimen of irinotecan 180 mg/m2 (on day 
1) combined with S-1 50 mg/m2 (25 mg/m2 b.i.d.) on Days 1-14 for non-frail patients. No toxicity issues 
were observed for the reduced dose regimen used for Nordic9-like patients (Winther et al., 2019), that 
were frail or in conjunction with impaired renal function, irinotecan 150-180 mg/m2 (on day 1) combined 
with S-1 40 mg/m2 (20 mg/m2 B.I.D.) on days 1-14. The dose intensities were 100% for S-1 for the 15 
full dose patients and, when corrected for age and renal function, were 100% for 16 of the 17 patients. 
This  demonstrates  that  most  patients  tolerated  and  could  continue  their  initially  planned  treatment 
schedule. The 17 mCRC patients on IRIS had a median treatment time of 168 days (range 42-588) and 
median overall survival of 25 months (range 2-35 months), which are very similar to the full CardioSwitch 
study  population:  147  days  on  treatment  (for  both  localised  and  metastatic  disease,  with  or  without 
recurrent cardiotoxicity) and an OS of 26 months (95% CI 22-31) in mCRC, respectively. 
Clinical experience from Denmark, Sweden, and Finland 
According to MAH there is experience with the combination of S-1 and irinotecan in Nordic countries, for 
example in clinical trials (described in Winther et al., 2016; Winther et al., 2019) or as off label use as 
an alternative for capecitabine. 
The experience at the Odense University Hospital (Denmark) since 2014 of involving 140 patients with 
CRC treated with IRIS was provided per personal communication with a clinical expert. Patients received 
25 mg/m2 S-1 b.i.d. and 200 mg/m2 irinotecan on day 1 in 3-week schedules, most often as second or 
later line of therapy. From the period between 2012-2014 18 patient were reported in the publication by 
Winther et al., 2016. The remaining patients seem to have been treated off label. The median number 
of treatment cycles was 5. The observed PFS was 4 months and was, according to the clinical expert, as 
could be expected considering the target population. The clinical value of this treatment combination is 
demonstrated by the fact that the combination has not been changed since that time and has been used 
as  a  standard  treatment  combination  since  2015  at  the  Odense  hospital,  according  to  personal 
communication provide by a clinical expert. 
In addition, treatment with IRIS is mentioned in a Swedish regimen database as a treatment option for 
colorectal cancer on a 3-week schedule with 25 mg/m2 S-1 (once per day d1, 15 and b.i.d. day 2-14)

(http://www.regimbiblioteket.se/regim.html?id=1915&b=23). It is not reported by the MAH how often 
this combination is actually prescribed. 
Lastly,  on  top  of  those  reported  in  the  CardioSwitch  trial,  13  patients  have  been  treated  with  IRIS 
combinations  in  Finland.  Three  of  these  patients  were  CardioSwitch  patients  who  were  added  to  the 
database after data cut-off in October 2020 and the remaining patients seems to have been treated off 
label. Six received irinotecan 150-180 mg/m2 with S-1 at 28-37 mg/m2, 4 received irinotecan with full

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy  
This application is based on published literature and supported by exploratory pivotal evidence in the 
target  population  and,  mainly,  supportive  evidence  of  patients  who  are  randomised  at  baseline  to 
either  S-1  based  therapy or  another  fluoropyridimine-based  therapy.  As  direct  evidence  in  the  target 
population, exploratory efficacy results are reported from studies in European patients after switching to 
S-1  based  therapy  due  to  toxicity  on  other  fluoropyrimidine-based  therapy.  As  part  of  the  indirect 
evidence,  the  MAH  performed  a  meta-analysis of  efficacy  in  phase 2  and  3  studies  of  Teysuno-based 
regimens compared to 5-FU- and capecitabine-based regimens in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), 
which  will  be  discussed  first  (Derksen  et  al.,  2021,  in  preparation).  Moreover,  the  MAH  discussed  a 
selection of studies included in the meta-analysis comparing S-1 based therapies versus therapies based 
on  another  fluoropyrimidine  in  more  detail.  In  the  efficacy  discussion,  first  the  meta-analysis  and 
individual studies will be discussed, followed by an overall discussion of the data supporting efficacy of 
S-1 as monotherapy or in combination with oxaliplatin or irinotecan, with or without bevacizumab, in 
adult patients with mCRC for whom it is not possible to continue treatment with another fluoropyrimidine 
due to hand-foot syndrome (HFS) or cardiovascular toxicity. 
Discussion of individual studies 
Pivotal evidence 
Regarding available data in the EU target population of patients who switched to S-1 after toxicity on 
another fluoropyrimidine, the MAH provided additional data from a retrospective study (CardioSwitch) 
that included 53 mCRC European patients who were switched to S-1 based therapy after development 
of cardiotoxicity on another fluoropyrimidine). In addition, data is reported from a retrospective analysis 
of data from a prospectively collected Dutch database (PLCRC Switch Cohort Study) that evaluated long-
term  safety  in  47  mCRC  patients  who  were  switched  to  S-1  regimens  after  development  of  either 
cardiotoxicity or HFS on capecitabine. 
The study by Österlund et al., submitted, investigated retrospectively a cohort of patients with solid 
tumours experiencing grade 1-4 cardiotoxicity during fluoropyrimidine treatment, who were switched to 
S-1 based therapy. The main purpose was to evaluate cardiotoxicity during rechallenge, but exploratory 
efficacy data were also provided. For the patient group with mCRC specifically (n=53), median OS was 
26  months  (CI95%  22-31)  with  a  5-year  survival  rate  of  12%.  Median  reported  OS  mCRC  treated  in 
clinical studies is around 30 months (van Cutsem et al., Annals of Oncology, 2016) and population-based 
median OS is approximately 12 months in the total population and 15 months in patients who received 
systemic  therapy  (Hamers  et  al.,  International  Journal  of  Cancer,  2020).  It  is  noted  that  the  5-year 
Assessment report  
EMA/2190/2022 
Page 97/98 
 
 
 
 
survival rate of 12% in patients switched to S-1 due to toxicity described by Österlund et al. is lower 
than the reported 60% in clinical trials (van Cutsem et al., Annals of Oncology, 2016), but based on the 
KM curve in Figure 35 the 5-year survival rate is difficult to interpret due to the low number of patients 
and median OS is regarded as more relevant. 
Furthermore,  the  MAH  provided  retrospective  data  from  Dutch  patients  who  switched  to  S-1  after 
previous intolerance to capecitabine-based treatment for mCRC (Punt et al., in preparation). The main 
objective was to conduct a retrospective analysis of the long-term safety, but also exploratory efficacy 
data were provided for 47 patients. Of these 47 patients, for 10 (21%) the reason to switch to S-1 was 
cardiac toxicity, for 36 (77%) the reason was HFS, and for 1 (2%) there was another reason. Patients 
received a median of 6 cycles of S-1 based therapy. The median time from initiation of treatment with 
capecitabine to first documented progression of disease after initiation of treatment with S-1 was 414 
days  (95%  confidence  interval  332-568  days).  When  only  the  36  patients  who  switched  from 
capecitabine to S-1 for reason of HFS were considered, median PFS was 414 days (95%CI: 332-629). 
As also acknowledged by the authors the interpretation of these data is limited by the small number of 
patients, heterogeneity of the treatment schedules and varying timing of the switch to S-1, next to that 
it’s  difficult  to  draw  conclusions  based  on  cross  study  comparisons  without  matching  for  baseline 
characteristics.  
Supportive evidence 
The majority of the data is indirect evidence in a population that was randomised at baseline between 
therapy based on S-1 or another fluoropyrimidine. The MAH performed a systematic literature search 
using  the  electronic  databases  MEDLINE,  Embase,  and  Cochrane  Register  of  Controlled  Trials  and  a 
search for grey literature using OpenGrey to identify randomised trials comparing S-1 versus 5-FU or 
capecitabine.  
Literature search- With the literature search 457 articles were identified. Articles were included based 
on age of the patients >18 years, histologically proven mCRC, palliative S-1 based therapy compared 
with 5-FU or capecitabine-based therapy, and prospective phase II or III randomised clinical trial. Using 
the inclusion criteria, 14 studies were included for the meta-analysis. For 4 studies the publication could 
not be retrieved, also not after contacting the authors and were excluded. Out of the 14 included studies, 
4 studies had updated publications and the MAH used the updated publications for inclusion in the PFS 
and OS meta-analyses, which is agreed. Based on the characteristics of the study designs and included 
study populations, the MAH concluded that the 10 relevant studies that were identified by the literature 
search could be used for a meta-analysis. The studies investigated first (8) and second line (2) mCRC 
setting. The study by Kato et al., 2012, investigated both first and second line, but was regarded as first 
line study as the majority of patients were treated in first line according to the authors of the original 
publication. Most of the studies were multicenter and performed in Asia between 2008-2018. One study 
investigated  S-1  monotherapy  (+/-  bevacizumab),  the  other  studies  investigated  combinations  with 
oxaliplatin  or  irinotecan  (+/-  bevacizumab).  The  study  of  Yamada  et  al.,  2018,  had  a  different 
combination  in  the  control  (combination  with  oxaliplatin  and  bevacizumab)  versus  the  investigational 
arm  (combination  with  irinotecan).  The  MAH  states  that  based  on  the  results  of  the  meta-analysis  of 
Kawai et al., 2021, it is justified to compare irinotecan- and oxaliplatin-based therapies in first line mCRC. 
Baseline characteristics of the included patients, i.e. gender, age, and ECOG performance scale, were 
comparable between the studies. 
Overall,  the  provided  search  and  selection  strategy  seems  reasonable,  even  though  the  description 
leaves  uncertainties  precluding  to  assess  whether  it  is  on  par  with  Cochrane  systematic  reviews.  For 
instance, it is not clear whether synonyms (e.g., randomis/zation, randomis/zed) were included (applies 
to all databases). Also it is not clear whether only the substance name in EMBASE is sufficient (MeSH is 
not  Emtree)  and  no  details  were  given  on  the  execution  of  the  screening  (e.g.,  if  two  independent 
Assessment report

reviewers  were  used).  However,  the  studies  previously  described  in  the  overview  to  support  the 
indication  were  included  with  additional  studies  that  were  also  described  in  other  published  meta-
analyses (Chionh et al., Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2017; Chen et al., Medicine, 2019; 
Wang et al., International Journal of Colorectal Disease, 2020). It is agreed that based on the included 
studies a meta-analyses reporting on PFS and OS is of additional value. 
Methods for meta-analysis including non-inferiority margin- PFS was the primary outcome for the meta-
analysis with OS and ORR as secondary outcomes, which is acceptable. A non-inferiority margin of 1.25 
was  defined  for  PFS  which  was  selected  based  on  the  trial  with  the  most  conservative  non-inferiority 
margin  (i.e.  Yamada  et  al.,  2018).  This  corresponds  approximately  to  a  loss  of  at  most  20%  in  the 
median. Non-inferiority for S-1 based therapy compared to 5-FU or capecitabine-based therapy was to 
be  concluded  when  the  upper  limit  of  the  99%  CI  of  the  pooled  HR  was  lower  than  1.25,  which  is 
acceptable in view of the likely significant detriment when continuation 5-FU is not possible. The MAH 
used random-effect models with generic inverse-variance weighing to minimise the imprecision of the 
pooled effect estimate. All tests were two-sided, and heterogeneity was assessed by the Cochran Q-test 
and quantified by the I2 index. Overall, the methods described are considered acceptable. 
Results meta-analysis- In total 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis treating 2117 patients: 
1062 with S-1 based therapy and 1055 with 5-FU or capecitabine-based therapy. HRs for PFS and OS 
could be extracted from six studies and ORR data were available from 10 studies. In addition, median 
PFS per arm was reported by 4 other studies and median OS per arm by 3 other studies. 
For the primary endpoint PFS, pooled HR was 0.95 with the upper boundary of the 99% CI being 1.08, 
which is below the non-inferiority margin of 1.25. For first line studies pooled HR was 0.92 with an 99% 
CI upper bound of 1.06. In addition, the results are described for three other studies in first line that 
only reported median PFS. Except for the study by Kim et al., 2015, which reported a median time to 
progression of 7.4 months for the control arm vs 6.1 months for the S-1 based arm, the other studies 
reported a numerically longer time to progression in the S-1 based arm with a difference of 0.2 and 0.7 
months. For second line studies pooled HR was 1.06 with an 99% CI upper bound of 1.37. Although the 
HR for PFS in the second line subgroup has an upper bound of the 99% CI above 1.25, it is noted that 
this is only based on one study (Yasui et al, 2015) and OS is in favour of S-1 in second line (see below). 
Another second line study that only reported on median PFS showed a median PFS of 8.5 months in the 
S-1+irinotecan+bevacizumab  arm  versus  8.2  months  in  the  mFOLFIRI+bevacizumab  arm  (Liu  et  al., 
2015). No suggestion of important heterogeneity was observed for PFS (I2 = 12%, P = 0.34) and all 
studies’ point estimates were well below the non-inferiority margin. 
OS was a secondary outcome in the studies included in the meta-analysis and supported the PFS results. 
For all pooled studies HR was 0.93 with CI99% upper bound of 1.07. For both first and second line HR 
was also <1 with the upper bounds of the CI99% <1.25. No indication of  important heterogeneity was 
observed for OS (I2 = 0%, P = 0.82), most studies point estimates were below or close to one. Additional 
three studies only reporting medians for OS all showed non-relevant differences between S-1 versus 5-
FU or capecitabine-based therapies. 
Based on a pooled risk ratio for response RR was 1.06 with CI99% upper bound of 1.24. When looking 
at the subgroups of first and second line therapy separately, the upper bounds of the CI99% exceed 
1.25 (1.25 for first line and 1.84 for second line). Moderate heterogeneity was detected for ORR (I2 = 
48%, P = 0.04) as was also evident from the larger spread of point estimates of the studies. 
Next to the meta-analysis described above, the MAH presented the results of individual studies, which 
are discussed below.

For  S-1  monotherapy,  one  supportive  study  is  provided  by  the  MAH.  This  concerns the  randomised 
phase 3 trial comparing S-1 versus capecitabine in the first-line treatment of mCRC (Kwakman et al., 
2017; Kwakman et al., 2019). 
Design- Patients with previously untreated mCRC in the Netherlands were included, making this the only 
randomised controlled trial of S-1 versus another fluoropyrimidine provided in a Caucasian population. 
Bevacizumab could be added at the discretion of the local investigator. S-1 was administered at a dose 
of  30  mg/m2.  The  primary  endpoint  was  the  incidence  of  HFS,  efficacy  endpoints  were  amongst  the 
secondary endpoints (PFS, RR, OS). Patients were evaluated via RECIST 1.1. Of note, data of this study 
was previously submitted in fulfilment of the commitment to increase the knowledge about the clinical 
safety  and  efficacy  of  S-1 
in  clinical  practice 
in  advanced  gastric  cancer  (EMEA  001; 
EMEA/H/C/001242/II/0029). 
Results- After randomisation, 81 patients were allocated to the capecitabine arm and 80 to the S-1 arm. 
In 59%, patients also received bevacizumab. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced, only more 
females were treated in the S-1 group (31% of capecitabine treated patients were female versus 44% 
in the S-1 arm). Based on the first analysis published by Kwakman et al., 2017, there were no significant 
differences in PFS, RR, and OS between the treatment groups after a median follow-up of 20.2 months, 
although  responses  were  numerically  higher  in  the  capecitabine  (47%)  versus  S-1  (32%)  group 
(p=0.09).  HR  for  PFS  was  0.99  (95%  CI  0.71-1.37,  p=0.93)  and  for  OS  1.23  (95%  CI  0.82-1.86, 
p=0.32). Additional long-term results were published by Kwakman et al., 2019, after a median follow-
up of 40.3 months. Median PFS was 8.2 months for patients treated with capecitabine compared to 8.4 
months for S-1 (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.75-1.40, p=0.89). Median OS was 17.1 months for capecitabine and 
17.0 months for S-1 (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76-1.49, p=0.70). As also stated by the authors, the study 
was  not  powered  for  non-inferiority  analysis  for  efficacy  measures.  The  proposed  posology  of  S-1 
monotherapy of 30 mg/m2 in the SmPC is based on this study and acceptable. 
In addition, the MAH presents the results of four phase 3 non-inferiority studies of S-1 in combination 
with oxaliplatin or irinotecan with or without bevacizumab in Asian mCRC patients. 
The first study investigated the combination with oxaliplatin for first-line mCRC patients and results are 
published by Hong et al. 2012 and Kim et al., 2014. 
Design-  This  was  a  randomised,  non-inferiority  trial  comparing  S-1  plus  oxaliplatin  (SOX)  with 
capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CapeOX) for first-line mCRC patients in South Korea. The dosing of S-1 
with 40 mg/m2 is higher than as applied for in this MAA (i.e. 25 mg/m2 in combination therapy). This 
study  did  not  include  the  use  of  bevacizumab,  which  is  part  of  a  standard  first-line  regimen  and  the 
representativeness for the applied for EU indication is therefore questioned. The primary endpoint was 
PFS with a predefined non-inferiority margin of 1.43. Secondary efficacy endpoints were RR, TTF, OS, 
and QoL. Tumour responses were reviewed according to RECIST 1.0. 
Results- After randomisation, 168 patients were allocated to the SOX combination and 172 to CapeOX. 
The  reported  baseline  characteristics  were  balanced  between  the  groups.  With  a  median  age  of  ~60 
years, the patients were overall young compared to for example the study by Kwakman et al., 2017 in 
a European population. Median PFS was 8.5 months in the SOX group and 6.7 months in the CapeOX 
group (p noninferiority <0.0001). HR of SOX versus CapeOX in PFS was 0.79 (95% CI 0.60-1.04). For 
the secondary endpoint of OS, HR was 0.86 (95% CI 0.68-1.08). The provided data by the MAH were 
based on the data cutoff as published by Hong et al., 2012 with a median follow-up of 20.6 months. This 
publication  also  reported  that  TTF  was  significantly  longer  in  the  SOX  vs  CapeOX  group  (6.9  vs  5.6 
months) and the number of responses higher (47 vs 36%). Updated data are provided by Kim et al., 
2014,  providing  a  follow-up  exploratory  analysis  of  PFS  and  OS.  Median  follow-up  was  ~17  months, 
which is unexpected as it is shorter than reported in the first publication and might be a typing error.

Both PFS and OS were not significantly different for SOX versus CapeOX in the updated analyses. The 
upper limit of the 95% CI of HR for the primary endpoint PFS was <1.23, which was also the case for 
OS. 
Another  clinical  study  investigating  the  combination  with  oxaliplatin  is  published  by  Yamada  et  al., 
2013 and Baba et al., 2017. 
Design-  In  this  open-label,  non-inferiority,  randomised  phase  3  trial,  SOX  plus  bevacizumab  was 
compared  with  mFOLFOX6  plus  bevacizumab  as  first-line  treatment  of  mCRC  patients  in  Japan.  The 
primary endpoint PFS was tested with a predefined non-inferiority margin of 1.33 according to RECIST 
1.0. Secondary efficacy endpoints were amongst others OS, TT, RR. 
Results-  In  both  groups  256  patients  were  assigned.  Baseline  characteristics  of  this  study  population 
with a median age of 63 years were balanced between the arms. Median PFS was 11.5 months in the 
mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab arm and 11.7 months in the SOX/bevacizumab arm as published by Yamada 
et al., 2013 with a median follow-up of 18.4 months. With a HR of 1.04 and corresponding 95% CI of 
0.86-1.27, this was below the non-inferiority margin of 1.33 (p=0.014). Due to the immaturity of the 
data, Baba et al., 2017, reported the final PFS and OS analysis. With this final data cutoff, median follow-
up for PFS was 31.2 months. Median PFS was 11.7 months in the mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab group and 
12.2  months  in  the  SOX/bevacizumab  group  (HR  1.05;  95%CI  0.88-1.26;  p  non-inferiority=0.0115 
based on the predefined non-inferiority margin). At the final data cutoff, median OS was 29.7 months in 
the  mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab  arm  and  29.6  months  in  the  SOX/bevacizumab  arm  (HR  1.02;  95%  CI 
0.82-1.26).  The  response  rates  were  similar  between  the  treatment  groups  (62.7% 
for 
mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab, 61.5% for SOX/bevacizumab). 
The next study investigated the combination of S-1 with irinotecan plus bevacizumab versus mFOLFOX6 
or CapeOX plus bevacizumab (Yamada et al., 2018). 
Design- This was a randomised, open-label, phase 3, non-inferiority trial in first-line mCRC patients in 
Japan. Dosing of S-1 was again higher (40 mg/m2) compared to the posology as proposed in the SmPC 
for this application. The primary endpoint was PFS with a predefined non-inferiority margin of 1.25 based 
on  RECIST  1.1.  Superiority  would  be  tested  if  non-inferiority  was  demonstrated.  Secondary  efficacy 
endpoints were OS, TTF, RR, and QoL. 
Results- In the mFOLFOX6/CapeOX plus bevacizumab arm 243 patients were analysed for efficacy (66 
mFOLFOX6  and  177  CapeOX)  and  241  in  the  S-1  plus  irinotecan  and  bevacizumab  arm  (136  3-week 
regimen  and  105  4-week  regimen).  Median  PFS  was  10.8  months  in  the  mFOLFOX6/CapeOX  plus 
bevacizumab group and 14.0 months in the S-1 plus irinotecan and bevacizumab group (HR 0.84; 95%CI 
0.70–1.02; p<0.0001 for non-inferiority). The reported p-value for superiority was 0.0815 at a median 
follow-up of 32.4 months. Median TTF in the mFOLFOX6/CapeOX plus bevacizumab group and the S-1 
plus irinotecan and bevacizumab arm group was 7.7 months and 9.6 months, respectively (p=0.0002). 
The response rate of target lesions was 70.6% in the mFOLFOX6/CapeOX plus bevacizumab group and 
66.4% in the S-1 plus irinotecan and bevacizumab arm group (p=0.34). The p-value for OS was 0.2841 
with a median OS in the mFOLFOX6/CapeOX plus bevacizumab group of 33.6 months and 34.9 months 
in the S-1 plus irinotecan and bevacizumab arm (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.66-1.13). 
The  fourth  study  investigated  the  combination  of  S-1  plus  irinotecan  versus  FOLFIRI  as  second-line 
treatment (Muro et al., 2010; Yasui et al., 2015). 
Design- This was a randomised, open-label phase 2/3 study investigating the combination of S-1 plus 
irinotecan (IRIS) versus FOLFIRI as second-line treatment in mCRC patients in Japan. S-1 dosing was 
weight-dependent; 40 mg for patients with BSA <1.25 m2; 50 mg for patients with BSA 1.25<1.5 m2; 
60 mg for patients with BSA ≥1.5 m2. The primary endpoint was PFS with a predefined non-inferiority

margin of 1.333. Patients were evaluated with RECIST 1.0. Secondary efficacy endpoints were OS and 
RR. 
Results-  After  randomisation,  213  patients  each  were  allocated  to  both  treatment  arms.  Reported 
baseline characteristics were balanced between the groups and the median age was ~62 years. Again, 
the  results  of  two  database  cutoffs  were  published.  At  the  first  database  cutoff  median  PFS  was  5.8 
months for IRIS compared to 5.1 months for FOLFIRI (median follow-up 12.9 months). The HR for IRIS 
compared to FOLFIRI for PFS was 1.077 (95% CI 0.897-1.319) which met the primary endpoint of non-
inferiority as defined by the study with a margin of 1.333. The HR for the secondary endpoint of OS as 
was 0.900 (95% CI 0.728-1.112) at the latest data cutoff with a median OS of 17.8 months in the IRIS 
arm  and  17.4  months  in  the  FOLFIRI  arm  (median  follow-up  39.2  months).  At  the  final  data  cutoff, 
median  PFS  was  5.1  months  in  the  FOLFIRI  group  and  5.8  months  in  the  IRIS  group.  In  the  ITT 
population, the HR for IRIS to FOLFIRI was 1.058 (95% CI 0.869–1.289; p=0.022). It should be noted 
that the study population was not representative for a second-line European mCRC population (see also 
commentary  by  Schmoll,  Lancet  Oncology,  2010).  Only  60%  of  the  study  population  received  prior 
chemotherapy with oxaliplatin. As stated by Muro et al., 2010, FOLFOX was already the standard first-
line treatment worldwide when the study started, but oxaliplatin had just been launched in Japan. In the 
subgroup of patients receiving prior chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, median PFS was 5.7 months in the 
IRIS group and 3.9 months in the FOLFIRI group (adjusted HR 0.876, 95% CI 0.677–1.133), whereas 
in patients without prior oxaliplatin treatment it was 6.0 months and 7.8 months, respectively (HR 1.490, 
95% CI 1.079–2.059). A similar tendency was noted in OS results. The subgroup analysis in patients 
with or without prior oxaliplatin are limited by low numbers and it is difficult to draw conclusions based 
on these subgroups, but it seems that pretreatment with or without oxaliplatin influences the results of 
2L treatment.  
In  addition,  the  MAH  provided  the  efficacy  results  in  the  clinical  overview  of  studies  performed  in  a 
Caucasian population. The first study is a phase 1 trial to determine the schedule of a combination of S-
1 with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab in a Caucasian population with advanced or metastatic solid tumours 
for which no established standard therapy existed (Chung et al., 2011). Two treatment schedules were 
tested: schedule A was a 21-day cycle with 14 consecutive dose of S-1 and in schedule B a 14-day cycle 
was used with 7 days S-1 treatment. S-1 was administered in increasing doses. For Schedule A MTD was 
determined to be S-1 25 mg/m2 administered orally twice daily for 14 days followed by 7 days of rest 
in  a  3-week  cycle  in  combination  with  oxaliplatin  and  bevacizumab  once  every  3  weeks.  The  MTD  of 
schedule B was S-1 35 mg/m2 administered in combination with 85 mg/m 2 oxaliplatin and 5 mg/kg 
bevacizumab once every 2 weeks. Of the total of 22 evaluable patients in schedule A, 2 patients (9%) 
achieved PR, 17 patients (74%) had SD and 4 patients (17%) demonstrated PD as the best response 
based on RECIST. For schedule B, 24 patients were evaluable: 8 patients (35%) demonstrated PR, 10 
patients (44%) SD, and 5 patients (22%) PD as best response. The MAH proposed a S-1 posology of 25 
mg/m2 for combination chemotherapy, which can be supported for oxaliplatin based on the results by 
Chung et al., 2011.  
The second study discussed in the clinical overview is a randomised study with both study arms receiving 
S-1 in an older, vulnerable mCRC population (Winther at al., 2019).  
Design- First-line mCRC patients were included of 70 years and older who were not candidates for full-
dose combination therapy. Patients were randomised to receive full-dose S-1 (30 mg/m2 b.i.d, orally, 
d1-14  every  3  weeks)  followed  by  second-line  irinotecan  (250  mg/m2,  IV,  d1  every  3  weeks  or  180 
mg/m2  IV,  d1  every  2  weeks)  at  progression  or  reduced-dose  S-1  (20  mg/m2  b.i.d.  d1-14  every  3 
weeks)  plus  oxaliplatin  (100  mg/m2  d1  every  3  weeks)  followed by  second-line  treatment  at  disease 
progression  with  reduced  dose  S-1  plus  irinotecan  (180  mg/m2  d1  every  3  weeks).  Addition  of 
bevacizumab  was  optional  (7.5  mg/kg  IV  d1  every  3  weeks).  The  primary  endpoint  was  PFS  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/2190/2022

secondary efficacy endpoints included OS, response, QoL, and time to failure of strategy. RECIST 1.1 
was used by the local investigators to determine responses. Patients were recruited in Denmark, Finland, 
Norway, and Sweden. 
Results-  83  patients  were  randomised  to  the  full-dose  monotherapy  and  77  to  the  reduced-dose 
combination  therapy.  Median  age  was  78  years  and  ~20%  had  ECOG  PS2.  Bevacizumab  was 
administered to 22 patients in each group. With a median follow-up of 23.8 months (IQR 18.8-30.9) PFS 
was 5.3 months (95% CI 4.1-6.8) in the full-dose group compared to 6.2 months (95% CI 5.3- 8.3) in 
the reduced-dose combination therapy group (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52-0.99, p=0.047). Median OS was 
11.5 months (95% CI 8.7-15.9) in the full-dose monotherapy group compared to 14.5 months (95% CI 
12.1- 20.8 in the reduced-dose combination therapy group (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.57-1.19, p=0.302). The 
proportion  of  patients  achieving  objective  response  with  first-line  treatment  was  numerically  but  not 
significantly  higher  in  the  reduced-dose  combination  group  (42%)  than  in  the  full-dose  monotherapy 
group (33%, p=0.257). The MAH proposes in section 4.2 of the SmPC that the recommended dose of S-
1 in combination with oxaliplatin in elderly, more vulnerable patients should be reduced to 20 mg/m2, 
which is acceptable. 
Overall discussion 
In this type II variation, the MAH applies for an extension of the indication for the treatment of mCRC 
patients where the current chemotherapy cannot be continued due to the fluoropyrimidine intolerability 
causing cardiotoxicity or HFS. It is agreed with the MAH that there is an unmet medical need in patients 
who cannot continue with other fluoropyrimidines due to HFS and cardiovascular safety issues. Without 
the option to continue an effective therapy with fluoropyrimidines due to toxicity, there is a potential 
loss  of  extended  overall  survival.  S-1  is  designed  to  reduce  the  rate  of  degradation  of  5-FU  and  its 
conversion to its toxic phosphorylated metabolite and can, therefore, hypothetically act as an alternative 
to patients for whom continuation with another fluoropyrimidine is not an option.  
In support of the indication, the MAH performed a literature search and meta-analysis of randomised 
phase II and III clinical trials. The meta-analysis showed that S-1 based therapy was non-inferior to 5-
FU  or  capecitabine-based  therapy  regarding  PFS  using  a  non-inferiority  margin  of  1.25.  This  non-
inferiority applies to patients starting first-line or second line therapy and is as such not direct evidence 
for the indication. Secondary outcomes of OS and ORR supported this finding. Although the HR for PFS 
in the second line subgroup has an upper bound of the 99% CI above 1.25, it is noted that this is only 
based on one study. Another study performed in second line that was not included in the meta-analysis 
as  only  median  PFS  was  reported,  showed  a  median  PFS  of  8.5  months 
in  the  S-
1+irinotecan+bevacizumab arm versus 8.2 months in the mFOLFIRI+bevacizumab arm. Combined with 
the finding that the CI99% upper bound for OS was <1.25 in the second line subgroup, excluding the 
subgroup treated in second line is not considered necessary. 
In addition to the meta-analysis that was performed mainly in Asian patients who were randomised at 
baseline,  the  MAH  also  provided  direct  but  exploratory  efficacy  data  in  European  patients  who 
switched  to  S-1  because  of  cardiotoxicity  or  HFS  on  another  fluoropyrimidine.  Although  the 
interpretation of these data are hampered by the retrospective and non-comparative nature, it seems 
that fluoropyrimidine activity is not lost after switching to S-1. It is also acknowledged that a randomised 
controlled trial in a population that cannot be treated with another fluoropyrimidines is not feasible due 
to lack of a proper control. With the newly performed meta-analysis using published results of clinical 
comparative studies in mainly Asian population supported by exploratory data in an European population 
that switched, the use of bibliographic evidence is considered sufficient for this application. 
The indication only includes S-1 monotherapy or the combination with oxaliplatin or irinotecan with or 
without bevacizumab. With the restriction to patients who developed HFS or cardiovascular toxicity on 
Assessment report  
EMA/2190/2022

another  fluoropyrimidine,  it  can  be  considered  that  the  same  unmet  medical  need  as  identified  for 
metastatic patients also applies to patients who developed these specific toxicities upon fluoropyrimidine 
for colorectal cancer in the adjuvant setting. While only a few patients treated in the adjuvant setting 
were  included  in  the  studies  that  form  the  basis  of  this  application,  it  is  to  be  expected  that  HFS  or 
cardiovascular toxicity will recur when patients will subsequently be treated with 5-FU or capecitabine in 
the metastatic setting. Furthermore, the posology of 5-FU/capecitabine and the combinations in which 
they are used in the adjuvant and metastatic setting are similar. Therefore, it is acceptable to include 
this population in the indication. 
GCP- The clinical studies have been performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH, which is 
acceptable. 
Formulation- The MAH stated that in the European and most of the Japanese and Korean studies the 
Teysuno  formulation  manufactured  by  Taiho  was  investigated.  In  three  phase  2  Japanese  studies  a 
generic, bioequivalent form, also manufactured, by Taiho was used. For three studies conducted in China, 
the formulation was not known. However, as these studies were not included in the meta-analysis, this 
is not considered to be an issue. 
Posology-  The  indication  is  restricted  in  this  round  to  S-1  monotherapy  (+/-  bevacizumab)  or  the 
combination with oxaliplatin (+/- bevacizumab) or irinotecan (+/- bevacizumab). As described above, 
the dosing for S-1 monotherapy (+/- 7.5 mg/kg bevacizumab) is based on the publications by Kwakman 
et al., 2017 and acceptable. The combination of S-1 with oxaliplatin (+/- bevacizumab) is based on the 
publication  by  Chung  et  al.,  2011  and  also  agreed. The  combination  with  irinotecan  was  initially  only 
supported by data in a Caucasian population that is frail with a reduced regimen, i.e. the publication of 
Winther et al., 2019. In the response, the MAH provided 3 additional levels of supportive evidence for 
the posology of the S-1 and irinotecan combination: a study in older mCRC patients treated with S-1 
(Winther  et  al.,  2016),  data  from  the  CardioSwitch  study  (Österlund  et  al.,  submitted),  and  clinical 
experience in Nordic European countries. Based on these data, the MAH concludes that the recommended 
dose of 180 mg/m2 irinotecan dose was chosen as this is the dose used in the CardioSwitch study, it is 
the standard dose in Finland and is the published dose in the observational Scandinavian chart study (by 
Winther et al., 2016). Experiences treating mCRC with this recommended dose of 25 mg/m2 S-1 b.i.d 
combined  with  180  mg/m2  irinotecan  in  3-week  schedules  are  that  it  is  effective  and  tolerable.  It  is 
agreed with the MAH that, albeit limited, most experience of the IRIS combination in European mCRC 
patients is  with  a  3-week  schedule  and  S-1  dosing of  25  mg/m2  with  no  efficacy  or  safety  concerns. 
Regarding the choice of 180 mg/m2 irinotecan, most studies and clinical practices use a higher dose of 
200  mg/m2  though  a  range  of  150-225  mg/m2  is  reported,  which  is  reflected  in  the  SmPC.  The 
recommendation on the dose reduction was updated in section 4.2 of the SmPC. No recommendation 
can be made and dose reduction will be dependent on the starting dose. 
Extrapolation- The first extrapolation is from Asian patients, the population in which most of the clinical 
studies were performed, to the European target population. For this extrapolation, the MAH discusses 
PK,  efficacy  and  safety  data.  Pharmacokinetics  were  not  found  to  be  clinically  significantly  different 
between ethnic groups. It is agreed that probably the reason for different recommended doses of S-1 
between  Western  and  Japanese  patients  is  the  ethnic  differences  in  5-FU  tolerability  rather  than  the 
difference in pharmacokinetics. This trend is also observed for other fluoropyrimidine chemotherapies. 
Regarding efficacy, the MAH describes meta-analyses results from studies in first-line advanced gastric 
cancer (ter Veer et al., Gastric Cancer, 2016; ter Veer et al., Scientific Reports, 2017).The meta-analysis 
published  in  2016  investigated  efficacy  and  safety  of  S-1  based  therapy  compared  to  5-FU  or 
capecitabine-based  therapy  in  advanced  gastric  cancer.  The  authors  concluded  that  there  were  no 
subgroup  differences  in  efficacy  among  Asian  and  Western  patients  (ter  Veer  et  al.,  Gastric  Cancer, 
2016). The network meta-analysis published in 2017 included overlapping studies and also concluded 
Assessment report  
EMA/2190/2022 
Page 104/105 
 
 
 
 
that  effects  were  similar  in  Asian  and  Western  subgroups  (ter  Veer  et  al.,  Scientific  Reports,  2017). 
However,  regarding  safety,  extrapolation 
is  hampered  by 
the  ethnic  differences 
in  S-1 
pharmacodynamics and toxicity reported in the literature and underlined also by the differences in S-1 
posologies  as  monotherapy  and  in  combinations  regimens  applied  in  the  studies  performed  in  the 
different ethnic groups (refer to the safety section of this report). 
For  the  second  extrapolation  from  patients  who  are  randomised  at  baseline  between  S-1  or  another 
fluoropyrimidine to patients who are not able to continue with another fluoropyrimidine, the MAH refers 
to the newly conducted meta-analysis supporting non-inferiority of the efficacy of S-1 based regimens 
compared to 5-FU or capecitabine-based regimens as first or second line treatment in mCRC (Derksen 
et al., 2021, in preparation). In addition, the two previously described retrospective analyses of patients 
who switched to S-1 after toxicity on another fluoropyrimidine, support that S-1 will be an effective and 
better  tolerated  option  in  patients  who  develop  HFS  or  cardiotoxicity  on  another  fluoropyrimidine 
(Österlund  et  al.,  submitted;  Punt  et  al.,  in  preparation).  Although  this  is  formally  no  evidence  of 
comparable efficacy when patients are randomised at baseline between S-1 or another fluoropyrimidine 
to patients who switch to S-1 after fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity, it is not possible to gather this 
information as the treatment options for patients become limited when 5-FU cannot be used. In addition, 
based on the MoA it is not expected that efficacy of S-1 will be different in patients who switch compared 
to start with S-1. Therefore, S-1 can be regarded as a treatment option considering the perspective of 
not being able to use another fluoropyrimidine, and this extrapolation step is considered less relevant in 
the restricted population. 
The  third  extrapolation  part  is  from  the  treatments  studied  to  all  established  combinations  of  mCRC 
therapy in a line agnostic indication. As the MAH narrowed the indication to S-1 monotherapy or specific 
combinations  for  which  data  are  provided,  i.e.  the  combination  with  oxaliplatin  or  irinotecan  with  or 
without bevacizumab, this extrapolation is not applicable anymore. The combination with EGFR inhibitors 
is not included in the adjusted wording of the indication. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
With the restricted indication, exploratory efficacy data in European patients who switched to S-1 after 
toxicity  on  another  fluoropyrimidine  and  the  additional  supportive  meta-analysis,  efficacy  for  patients 
who show intolerable toxicity on current standard mCRC treatment with a 5-FU or capecitabine backbone 
is  supported.  When  another  fluoropyrimidine  cannot  be  continued  due  to  toxicity,  treatment  options 
become limited with the potential loss of extended overall survival. Based on the provided efficacy data 
S-1  demonstrated to  be  a  valuable  treatment option  considering  the  perspective  of  not  being  able  to 
continue fluoropyrimidine treatment. 
With the restriction to patients who developed HFS or cardiovascular toxicity on another fluoropyrimidine, 
it can be considered that the same unmet medical need also applies to patients who developed these 
specific toxicities in the adjuvant setting for colorectal cancer and it is supported to include this population 
in the indication. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of S-1 for the existing indication (i.e., in combination with cisplatin in advanced gastric 
cancer) has been established on the basis of the FLAG study, where S-1 in combination with cisplatin 
was  compared  with  5FU  in  combination  with  cisplatin.  The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  events 
Assessment report  
EMA/2190/2022

associated with S1 were fatigue, gastrointestinal toxicity (i.e., diarrhoea, vomiting, mucositis/stomatitis) 
and haematological toxicity. A lower frequency of HFS and cardiac toxicity was reported in comparison 
with  5FU.  Inter-ethnic  differences  in  S-1  pharmacodynamics  and  toxicity  have  been  reported  in  the 
literature. 
In support for the assessment of the risks related to the type II variation sought according to the revised

Q3W) or S1 (30 mg/m2 orally BID on days 1-14 Q3W) in 27 centres in The Netherlands. Primary endpoint 
was  incidence  of  any  grade  HFS  as  assessed  by  both  physicians  and  patients  (diaries).  Secondary 
endpoints included incidence of grade 3 HFS, incidence of other toxicities, and efficacy (i.e., PFS, ORR 
and  OS).  Toxicity  was  recorded  according  to  NCI  CTCAE  version  4.0.  One  patient  did  not  start  study 
treatment and therefore was not included in the safety database. 
SOFT study 
A total of 512 previously untreated mCRC patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either mFOLFOX6 
plus  bevacizumab  (mFOLFOX6-B,  85  mg/m²  oxaliplatin,  200  mg/m²  l-leucovorin,  400  mg/m²  bolus 
fluorouracil, and 2400 mg/m² infusional fluorouracil, and 5 mg/kg bevacizumab on day 1 Q2W) or SOX 
plus bevacizumab (SOX-B, 130 mg/m² oxaliplatin and bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg Q3W, and assigned dose 
of S-1 BID day 1-15 Q3W) in 82 centres in Japan. Primary endpoint was PFS evaluated in a non-inferiority 
setting. 
SOX vs CAPOX study 
A  total  of  340  previously  untreated  mCRC  patients  were  randomized  1:1  to  receive  either  CAPOX 
(capecitabine 1000 mg/m² BID on days 1–14 and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m² on day 1, bevacizumab 7.5 
mg/kg Q3W) or SOX (S-1 40 mg/m² BID on days 1–14 and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m² on day 1) every 3 
weeks in 11 centres in South Korea. Primary endpoint was PFS evaluated in a non-inferiority setting. 
TRICOLORE study 
A  total  of  487  previously  untreated  mCRC  patients  were  randomized  1:1  to  receive  either  CAPOX 
(capecitabine  1000  mg/m²  BID  on  days  1–14  and  oxaliplatin  130  mg/m²  on  day  1)  or  mFOLFOX6-B 
(oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, leucoverin 200 mg/m2 , 5FU 400 mg/m2 followed by 2400 mg/m2, bevacizumab

S-1  80  mg/m2  BID  for  2 weeks,  followed by  a  1-week  rest;  or  4-weekly:  irinotecan  100  mg/m2  and 
bevacizumab 5 mg/kg on days 1 and 15, S-1 80 mg/m2 BID for 2 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest). 
Patients were enrolled in 53 centres in Japan. Primary endpoint was PFS evaluated in a non-inferiority 
setting. 
FIRIS study 
A total of 426 mCRC patients in need of second-line treatment were randomized 1:1 to receive either 
FOLFIRI  (150  mg/m²  irinotecan,  200  mg/m²  l-leucovorin,  400  mg/m²  bolus  fluorouracil,  and  2400 
mg/m² infusional fluorouracil on day 1 Q2W) or IRIS (125 mg/m² irinotecan on day 1 and 15, S-1 (40-
60 mg according to body surface area) BID day 1-15, Q4W) in 40 centres in Japan. Primary endpoint 
was PFS evaluated in a non-inferiority setting. 
NORDIC9 study 
A total of 157 previously untreated mCRC patients aged ≥ 70 years and not considered candidates for 
full-dose combination chemotherapy were randomized 1:1 to receive either full dose S1 (30 mg/m2 BID 
day 1-14 Q3W) followed by second line treatment at progression with irinotecan (250 mg/m2 Q3W or 
180  mg/m2  Q2W)  vs  reduced-dose  chemotherapy  with  S1  (20  mg/m2  BID day  1-14)  and  oxaliplatin 
(100 mg/m2 Q3W) followed by second line treatment at progression with S1 (20 mg/m2 BID day 1-14) 
and irinotecan (180 mg/m3 Q3W) in 23 Nordic European centres. The use of bevacizumab was allowed 
at discretion of investigator (7.5 mg/kg Q3W). Primary endpoint was PFS. 
Adverse events 
SALTO study

In  the  SALTO  trial,  the  incidence  of  any  grade  HFS  (primary  study  endpoint)  as  assessed  by  local 
investigators was 73% in the capecitabine group and 45% in the S1 group (n=58 vs 36; odds ratio [OR], 
95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31 (0.16-0.60, p=0.0005)). The incidence of grade 3 HFS was 21% for 
capecitabine and 4% for S-1 (n=17 vs n=3, p=0.003) (Kwakman et al., 2017).  
Table 22. Incidence of HFS as assessed by investigators 
Any grade diarrhoea (p=0.01) and grade 3 anorexia (p=0.03) occurred more frequently in the S-1 group.  
Table 23. Treatment-related adverse events in SALTO 
Patients who received S-1 had significantly higher rates of grade 3 anorexia (12.5% vs 2.5%, 
p=0.032), grade 2 anorexia and diarrhea compared to those who received capecitabine. Patients who 
received capecitabine had significantly higher rates of grade 3 HFS (21.3% vs 3.75%, p=0.0013) and 
grade 2 HFS compared with S-1 treated patients.

No relevant differences between the two study arms were observed regarding the percentage and kind 
of post-study treatment received by patients enrolled in the SALTO study. 
SOFT study 
In the SOFT study comparing SOX-B vs mFOLFOX6-B, SOX-B was associated with a significantly lower 
incidence of grade ≥3 neutropenia (9% vs 34%, respectively) and leucopenia (2% vs 8%, respectively) 
compared with mFOLFOX6-B. Nevertheless, frequency of grade ≥3 diarrhoea (9% vs 3%, respectively) 
and anorexia (5% vs 1%, respectively) was increased with SOX-B.

In  the  SOX  vs  CAPOX  study,  patients  in  the  SOX  group  experienced  significantly  more  grade  3-4 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and diarrhoea but less any grade hand-foot syndrome (HFS) than those 
in the CAPOX group (Hong et al., 2012).

TRICOLORE study 
In the TRICOLORE, comparing IRIS-B vs mFOLFOX-B or CAPOX-B, study patients who received IRIS-B 
had  significantly  higher  rates  of  grade  ≥3 
leukopenia,  neutropenia, 
febrile  neutropenia, 
thromboembolism, and diarrhoea but lower rates of grade ≥3 sensory neuropathy, HFS, and paralytic 
ileus than those who received FOLFOX6-B or CAPOX-B (Yamada et al., 2018). 
According to the article published by Yamada et al. (2018), the incidence of all grades anaemia (50.6% 
vs 38%), hyperbilirubinemia (43.5% vs 33.1%), mucositis/stomatitis (53.6% vs 43%), vomiting (24.7% 
vs 15.3%), diarrhoea (62.3% vs 45%), alopecia (59.8% vs 12.4%) was higher in the experimental vs 
the  control  arm.  In  contrast,  a  lower  incidence  of  thrombocytopenia  (31%  vs  62.4%),  AST  increase 
(33.5% vs 49.2%), HFS (51.7% vs 24.7%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (19.7% vs 92.1%) was 
observed in the experimental arm vs the control arm. 
The incidence of grade ≥3 leukopenia (8.8% vs 2.5%, respectively), neutropenia (24.3% vs 13.6%), 
febrile neutropenia (3.3% vs 0%), thromboembolism (3.8% vs 0.8%), and diarrhoea (13.4% vs 6.6%)

was significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group. The incidences of grade ≥3 
sensory neuropathy (0% vs 21.9%), hand–foot syndrome (0.8% vs 6.2%), and paralytic ileus (0% vs 
2.9%) were significantly lower in patients receiving the experimental treatment than in those receiving 
the control treatment.  
Table 26. Adverse events TRICOLORE study 
According to the information presented in the article no cardiac events were observed in the study. 
FIRIS study 
In the FIRIS study, comparing IRIS vs FOLFIRI, patients who received IRIS had higher rates of grade 3 
diarrhoea  and  lower  rates  of  grade  ≥3  neutropenia  than  patients  in  the  FOLFIRI  group  (Muro  et  al., 
2010). 
According to the article published by Muro et al., higher rates of grade ≥ 3 diarrhoea (20.5% vs 4.7%), 
fatigue (8.6% vs 3.3%), anorexia (11% vs 5.2%) and febrile neutropenia (4.8% vs 0.8%) were reported 
in  the  IRIS  group  compared  to  the  FOLFIRI  arm.  In  contrast,  more  patients  in  the  FOLFIRI  group 
experienced  grade  ≥3  neutropenia  than  did  those  in  the  IRIS  group  (52·1%  vs  36·2%,  respectively;

p=0·0012). According to the authors, grade 3 HFS was not observed in the study. Cardiac events were 
also not reported in the article. 
Table 27. Adverse events FIRIS study 
Of note, in the article the authors state that IRIS therapy might be less feasible in non-Asian patients 
and recommend that the optimal dose of S-1 should be explored in this population.  
NORDIC9 study 
In the NORDIC9 trial, exploring full-dose S1 monotherapy versus reduced-dose SOX therapy, 62% of 
patients in the full-dose group experienced at least one grade 3-4 adverse event compared to 43% of 
those on the reduced-dose combination therapy (p=0.014) (Winther et al., 2019). Grade 3-4 diarrhoea 
was  more  frequent  in  the  full-dose  monotherapy  group  compared  to  the  reduced-dose  combination 
therapy  group  (p=0.018).  No  grade  3-4  HFS  was  observed.  Two  patients  in  the  reduced-dose 
combination  therapy  group  experienced  grade  3-4  cardiotoxicity  that  led  to  discontinuation  and  one 
patient in the reduced-dose group had febrile neutropenia. Hospitalization was more common in the full-
dose  monotherapy  group  than  in  the  reduced-dose  combination  therapy  group  (61%  vs  39%, 
p=0.0052).

Table 28. Adverse events NORDIC study 
According to the article published by Winther et al., dose modifications were reported in 44% of patients 
in the full-dose monotherapy arm vs 40% in the reduced-dose combination group. The main reason for 
reduction was impaired renal function (17% in the full-dose S1 arm vs 30% in the reduced dose SOX 
arm), followed by gastrointestinal (17% in both arms) and haematological (19% vs 13%, respectively) 
toxicity. A higher percentage of patients in the S-1 monotherapy arm discontinued study treatment due 
to toxicity (18% vs 12%, respectively) or patient’s decision (4% vs 1%).  
Compared with the SOX arm, patients enrolled in the S-1 monotherapy arm reported a higher incidence 
of all grade diarrhoea (52% vs 43%, respectively), vomiting (29% vs 18%), dehydration (6% vs 0%), 
infection  (31%  vs  19%).  In  contrast,  more  patients  in  the  SOX  arm  experienced  all  grade 
thrombocytopenia (29% vs 17%), nausea (56% vs 45%), and sensory neuropathy (73% vs 22%). All 
grade HFS was slightly higher in the SOX arm (20% vs 16%). 
Grade 3-4 AEs were observed in 53% of patients enrolled in the study, with higher incidence in the S1 
monotherapy arm (62%) compared with the SOX arm (43%). 
No  grade  3-4  HFS  events  were  observed.  Two  patients  in  the  SOX  arm  experienced  grade  3-4 
cardiotoxicity leading to treatment discontinuation; both patients had a history of cardiac ischaemia and 
arrhythmia.

study: 2 patients with sepsis enrolled in the S-1 monotherapy arm and one rectum perforation in the 
SOX arm, all during first line therapy; and one patient with sepsis and one with perforation of the colon 
in the S-1 monotherapy arm and one with suspicion of a thromboembolic event in the SOX arm, in the 
second-line setting.

Safety in special populations 
S-1 after adverse events (HFS or cardiac toxicity) after other fluoropyrimidines in European 
patients: 
a)  Case  series  of  patients  treated  with  S-1  after  capecitabine-induced  coronary  artery 
vasospasm (Kwakman et al., 2017) 
In  this  case  series  of  7  patients  (2  mCRC)  who  experienced  capecitabine-induced  coronary  artery 
vasospasm, all patients were able to switch to full dose S-1 without additional cardiac toxicity.  
In the article published by Kwakman et al. (2017), a case series of 7 cancer patients (of which 2 with 
mCRC)  switching  to  S-1  after  capecitabine-induced  coronary  vasospasm  is  discussed.  Patients  were 
derived  from  4  centres  in  the  Netherlands  and  according  to  the  authors  patients  were  treated  with 
different combinations. Four patients had a history of cardiovascular comorbidities, of which two patients 
used  calcium  channels  blockers.  All  patients  experienced  intermittent  chest  pain  and  in  6  patients 
symptoms occurred within a week of the start of treatment. Re-challenge of capecitabine in combination 
with a calcium channel blocker was tried in one patient with no success, and switch from capecitabine to 
intravenous 5-FU was tried in another patient without success. S-1 was administered at different dosing 
regimens/with different combinations and the time interval between capecitabine discontinuation and S-

1 start varied from 1 week to 2 years. According to the authors a median of 4 cycles (range 2-15) of S-
1 was administered, with none of the patients experiencing any signs or symptoms related to cardiac 
toxicity. 
Table  29.  Patient  and  treatment  characteristics  of  patients  treated  with  S-1  after 
capecitabine-induced coronary artery vasospasm 
b)  Tolerability of  S-1  after  HFS  –  related  discontinuation  of  capecitabine  in western  cancer 
patients (Kwakman et al., 2017). 
In  this  retrospective  study  of  the  tolerability  of  S-1  treatment  after  HFS-related  discontinuation  was 
evaluated in 52 Dutch and Danish cancer patients treated with capecitabine-based regimens, 29 (56%) 
of whom had mCRC, Kwakman et al. reported that 49 (94%) patients had a lower grade of HFS upon 
switching  to  S-1  treatment.  A  total  of  29  (56%)  of  these  patients  had  complete  resolution  of  HFS 
symptoms. Three patients (12%) experienced ongoing grade 2 or 3 HFS that led to discontinuation. 
c) Continuation of fluoropyrimidine treatment with S-1 after cardiotoxicity on capecitabine- 
or 5-fluorouracil-based therapy in patients with solid tumours: a multi-centre retrospective 
observational cohort study (Österlund et al., submitted, 2021, manuscript draft). 
This was a retrospective, cohort study conducted at 13 centres in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, 
The  Netherlands,  and Ireland.  All  identified  patients  with  solid tumours  with  cardiotoxicity  grade  1-4, 
who were switched to S-1-based therapy were included. Population-based data on S-1 treatment was 
available for Tampere, Turku, and Helsinki university hospitals, and all cases were reviewed and included 
if switch due to cardiotoxicity was the indication for S-1-based treatment. Further, patients with switch 
due  to  cardiotoxicity  in  the  RAXO  study  (NCT01531621)  were  included.  Additional  cases  were 
retrospectively  identified  and  included  from  the  other  participating  institutions.  The  total  number  of 
patients receiving fluoropyrimidines could not be extracted. The data cut-off was October 29, 2020, when 
the  per  protocol  target  of  200  patients  was  reached.  Data  collected  at  baseline  included:  patient 
characteristics,  cardiovascular  comorbidities,  current  medications,  cardiac  evaluations,  cardiac 
treatment,  cardiotoxicity  on  first  treatment  and  recurrence  on  S-1-based  therapy,  previous  and 
concurrent  cancer  therapies.  Clinically  meaningful  non-cardiac  adverse  events  included  presence  of 
haematologic  toxicity  grade  3  or  4,  and  non-haematologic  toxicity  grade  2,  3,  and  4.  The  study  was 
approved by each institution and/or local ethics committee at each institution, if required. 
Outcomes/endpoints.  
The  primary  endpoint  was  recurrence  of  fluoropyrimidine-related  cardiac  toxicity  after  switch  to  S-1-
based  treatment  from  any  other  fluoropyrimidine  due  to  cardiotoxicity.  Secondary  endpoints  were: 
Assessment report  
EMA/2190/2022 
Page 116/117 
 
 
 
 
 
cardiac symptoms during fluoropyrimidine therapy; diagnostic work-up for cardiotoxicity in real-world 
practice;  timelines  for  cardiotoxicity;  dose  intensity;  and  alteration  in  cardiac  functional  parameters 
during  fluoropyrimidine  treatment-induced  cardiotoxicity.  Cardiotoxicity  was  defined  according  to  NCI 
CTCAE 4.0 criteria. Cardiotoxicity was graded by two experienced oncologists who sought consensus on 
assessment of each patient. The causal relationship between cardiotoxicity and fluoropyrimidine-based 
treatment was retrospectively determined by the investigator at each institution.  
Statistical analysis.  
The primary endpoint was recurrent cardiotoxicity during switch to S-1-based treatment. The cumulative 
incidence with its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated in a competing risks analysis, where first 
onset  of  recurrent  cardiotoxicity  during  S-1  treatment  was  considered  as  an  event  of  interest  and 
stopping  of  S-1  without  recurrent  cardiotoxicity  as  a  competing  risk.  Worst  grade  of  cardiotoxicity  is 
presented  if  multiple  events  were  present.  Continuous  characteristics  are  presented  as  median  with 
range and interquartile range (IQR). 
Systematic missing information for Dutch patients (n=28) included ECOG PS, some comorbidities, and 
survival information. Demographic variables were screened for associations with the crude percentage 
of recurrent cardiotoxicity with Chi-square tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (data 
not shown), and, if statistically significant differences were noted, odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs were 
calculated using logistic regression. OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
Results 
S-1-based treatment started between November 1, 2011 and October 29, 2020. Data cut-off was May 
10, 2021 when median follow-up was 33 months from S-1 initiation, and minimum 50 days. A total of 
200 patients were included. The median age was 66 years (range 19-86) and 118 (59%) were male. 
Included patients had oesophageal, gastric, small bowel, colon, rectal, anal, biliary, pancreatic, or breast 
cancer,  or  cancer  of  unknown  primary,  and  43%  had  metastatic  disease.  A  total  of  156  (78%)  had 
colorectal  cancer,  53  (27%)  mCRC,  and  101  (51%)  patients  had  no  cardiovascular  comorbidities  at 
baseline (Table 30).

No difference in severity was noted for patients with ongoing cardiac medication including nitrates or 
calcium channel blockers, that were administered to 28 patients at baseline. Median time to onset of 
cardiotoxicity was 5 days (IQR 2-16) from initiation of fluoropyrimidine-containing regimen without any 
difference between fluoropyrimidines, and early in the treatment cycle (Figure 37).

There were only slight differences in time to onset between the cardiac events, evaluated according to 
worst event present if the patient experienced multiple events. Cardiac arrest was the earliest event at 
a median of 2 days (95% CI not evaluable) from treatment initiation. Chest pain, both with or without 
ischemia,  appeared  on  day  4  (95%  CI  3-5),  heart  failure/cardiomyopathy  on  day  5  (0-31),  atrial 
fibrillation  on  day  18  (4-32),  and  other  arrythmias  on  day  41  (0-118)  from  treatment  initiation. 
Cardiotoxicity appeared for the first time in cycle 1 in 153 (77%) patients, in cycle 2 in 24 (12%), and 
later  (cycles  3-14)  in  23  (12%).  The  causal  relationship  between  cardiotoxicity  and  fluoropyrimidine 
treatment was determined by the investigator and categorized as related in 50 (25%), probably related 
in 117 (59%), and possibly related in 33 (17%). Median time to recovery from a cardiac event was 2 
(IQR 0-4) days, with full recovery in 98% of cases.  
Re-challenge with prophylactic medication (calcium-channel blocker and/or nitrates) was performed in 
18 patients before the switch to S-1, and was successful in 0/4 (0%) with capecitabine, in 1/9 (11%) 
with infused 5-FU, and in 4/5 (80%) with bolus 5-FU. Capecitabine or 5-FU was permanently discontinued 
in 192 (96%) patients experiencing cardiotoxicity and temporarily discontinued in 8 (4%) patients, with 
re-challenge  with  prophylaxis  in  3  patients  before  permanent  discontinuation  and  reintroduction  in 
subsequent lines in 5 patients.  
Non-haematologic toxicity grade 2-4 was observed in 15% and haematologic toxicity grade 3-4 in 1% 
during initial fluoropyrimidine treatment, with a short median treatment duration of 5 days (IQR 2–16; 
range 0-466). DPD status was unknown in 162 patients and was not considered relevant to be tested in 
38 patients with grade 2-4 non-cardiac toxicities. 
Table 33. Adverse events during treatment with the fluoropyrimidine causing cardiotoxicity 
and during Teysuno-based therapy 
Switch to S-1-based therapy. Of the 200 patients who were switched to S-1 therapy, 58 (29%) received 
S-1  as  single  agent  therapy,  all  of  whom  initially  had  single-agent  fluoropyrimidine.  Combination 
chemotherapy was administered with the same cytotoxic drug as used initially in 121 (61%) patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/2190/2022

and/or with a biologic in 43 (22%), i.e. three more patients had combination chemotherapy and nine 
more patients had a biologic agent compared with the cardiotoxicity-causing regimen.  
The  median  time  from  first  signs  of  cardiotoxicity  to  the  switch  was  23  days.  Of  patients  who  were 
switched  to  S-1-based  regimens  after  developing  cardiotoxicity  on  another  fluoropyrimidine,  50% 
(99/200) of patients also received oxaliplatin (5% of these had recurrent cardiotoxicity) and 8% (16/200) 
received irinotecan, none of whom had recurrent cardiotoxicity. In colorectal cancer patients (n=141, 53 
mCRC) S-1 was administered at a dose of 25 mg/m2 (b.i.d. d1-14 with 7 days rest) in combination with 
oxaliplatin  (130  mg/m2  d1)  to  77  CRC  patients  with  a  dose  intensity  of  100%  for  S-1.  Combination 
therapy with irinotecan was administered to 17 CRC patients, 12 of whom received S-1 at a dose of 25 
mg/m2 (b.i.d. d1-14 with 7 days rest) with irinotecan (180 mg/m2 day 1) on a 3-week schedule and 5 
of whom were frail and, concordant with Finnish practice, received a lower dose of irinotecan on day 1 
and 15, plus 20 mg/m2 b.i.d. S-1 on a 4-week schedule.  
One-hundred-ninety-two (96%) patients were able to switch to S-1-based treatment without recurrent 
toxicity. Recurrent cardiotoxicity was observed in 8 (4%) patients (with competing risk 95% CI 2·03–
7·89) and included chest pain in 5 patients and tachycardia in 3 patients. Cardiotoxicity appeared after 
a median of 16 days (IQR 7-67) from therapy initiation. The tachycardia episodes appeared earlier than 
chest pain. 
Of  the  8  patients  who  experienced  recurrent  cardiotoxicity,  3  were  on  S-1  monotherapy,  5  on 
combination  therapy  with  oxaliplatin,  and  one  of  these  also  received  bevacizumab.  Cardiac  therapy 
including nitrates or calcium channel blockers had already been administered to 28 patients before and 
continued after the fluoropyrimidine switch. These drugs were given to an additional 47 patients during 
the  cardiac  event  on  the  initial  fluoropyrimidine,  but  their  subsequent  drug  use  after  switch  was  not 
reliably recorded. Of this group of 75 patients known to have used either of these drugs and switched to 
S-1, 5 patients had recurrent cardiotoxicity whereas 70 did not (p= 0.136).  
The patients with recurrent cardiotoxicity had a median age of 64 years (range 51-72), 5 were male, 
and 5 had cardiovascular comorbidities at baseline. There were no differences in terms of age, gender, 
ECOG  status,  baseline  comorbidities,  type  of  S-1-based  therapy  (including  biologics),  relative  dose 
intensity, or severity of previous cardiotoxicity on the initial fluoropyrimidine between the 8 patients with 
recurrent cardiotoxicity compared to those without; only ischemic heart disease (OR 6·18; 95% CI 1·36–
28·11) was more common in patients with recurrent cardiotoxicity. Recurrent cardiotoxicity was grade 
1 in six patients and grade 2 in two patients.  
Regarding the 8 patients with recurrent cardiotoxicity, 5 patients experienced chest pain (4 of these had 
previous  cardiac  comorbidities),  and  3  had  tachycardia,  one  of  which  was  “cured”  with  appropriate 
treatment  for  panic  attacks.  All  recovered  without  sequelae  within  a  median of  1  (IQR  0-3)  day.  The 
causal relationship between S1-based treatment and cardiotoxicity was considered probably related in 2 
patients, possibly related in 3, and not related in 3. Recurrent cardiotoxicity was grade 1 in 6 patients 
and grade 2 in 2 patients. All recovered without sequelae within a median of 1 day. 
In patients with no recurrent cardiotoxicity (n=192, 96%), median duration of S-1-based treatment was 
147 days, for both localised and metastatic disease, during which 139 (72%) patients received four or 
more cycles. 
Median duration of S-1-based therapy was also 147 days in the patients with recurrent cardiotoxicity. S-
1  was  permanently  discontinued  due  to  cardiotoxicity  in  3  patients,  all  receiving  adjuvant  therapy,  5 
patients continued treatment with dose reduction in 1 patient, temporary interruption in 2 patients, and 
no action in 2 patients, for 147, 147+, 217+, 336+, and 357 days, respectively.

The  successful  completion  rate  with  S-1-based  treatment  was  99%  (197  patients).  Treatment  was 
discontinued due to completed adjuvant therapy in 88 patients, completed neoadjuvant therapy in 35 
(including 14 with chemoradiation), or progressive disease in 74 with palliative therapy, and was stopped 
due  to  cardiotoxicity  in  only  the  3  patients  described  above.  Forty-one  patients  continued  S-1-based 
treatment  at  progression  by  intensification  of  the  regimen,  mostly  by  adding  irinotecan.  Non-cardiac 
adverse events during S-1 treatment included grade 3-4 haematologic toxicity in 6%. Grade 2-4 non-
haematologic adverse events occurred in 22%, including neuropathy, nausea, diarrhoea, infection, and 
hand-foot syndrome. 
d) Dutch Prospective Colorectal Cancer Cohort (PLCRC)  
The  MAH  has  presented  a  retrospective  analysis  of  safety  data  from  mCRC  patients  in  the  Dutch 
Prospective Colorectal Cancer Cohort (PLCRC) who were switched to S-1 after development of intolerance 
(related  to  HFS  or  cardiotoxicity)  while  on  capecitabine  treatment  (n=47)  (Punt  et  al.,  2021,  in 
preparation).  Data  were  retrospectively  collected  from  patients  participating  to  the  Dutch  Prospective 
Colorectal Cancer Cohort (PLCRC) (Burbach et al., 2016). PLCRC was initiated in 2015, with currently 
59/80 Dutch hospitals participating and more than 10,000 patients being included (www.plcrc.nl) with 
all CRC stages (I-IV). Patients included in two previous retrospective studies on a treatment switch from 
capecitabine to S-1 (Kwakman et al., 2017b; Kwakman et al., 2017d) were excluded from the analysis. 
Data were recorded from the start of treatment with capecitabine until the end of treatment with S-1. 
Adverse  events  occurring  during  treatment  with  capecitabine  or  S-1  were  recorded  according  to  the 
maximal grade using CTCAE (version 5) criteria.  
A  total  of  53  patients  were  identified  who  were  exposed  to  treatment  with  S-1.  Four  patients  were 
excluded since capecitabine was administered in the adjuvant setting, and two patients were excluded 
because their previous treatment did not contain capecitabine but continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil. 
Therefore  47  patients  were  eligible  for  further  analysis.  Patients  were  treated  in  13  different  Dutch 
hospitals. There were 25 males and 22 females, and at the time of switch to S-1 median age was 62 
years (range 40-84), The starting dose of capecitabine was either 1250 mg/m2 or 1000 mg/m2 when 
given as monotherapy, and 1000 mg/m2 when given in combination with oxaliplatin. In 4 patients, a 
lower  starting  dose  of  capecitabine  was  applied  due  to  partial  DPD  deficiency.  Median  duration  of 
capecitabine  treatment  was  81  days  (range  4-454).  In  17  patients  (41%)  a  dose  reduction  of 
capecitabine was applied prior to switch to S-1. Reasons for capecitabine dose reduction included HFS 
(12 pts), diarrhea (2 pts), HFS + diarrhea (1 pts), HFS + mucositis (1 pts) and HFS + nausea + diarrhea 
(1 pts). Reasons for switch to S-1 was HFS in 36 patients (77%), cardiac toxicity in 10 patients (21%) 
and a combination of dyspepsia, nausea, anorexia and dyspnea in one patient (2%). This latter patient

had  experienced  the  same  combination  of  symptoms  during  previous  adjuvant  treatment  with 
capecitabine (Table 34). 
Table 34. Treatment preceding switch to S-1 
The starting dose of S-1 was either 30 mg/m2 when given as monotherapy, and 25 mg/m2 when given 
in combination with oxaliplatin. In 4 patients, a lower starting dose of S-1 was applied due to partial DPD

deficiency. In 6 patients, S-1 was started as monotherapy at 25 mg/m2 due to ongoing capecitabine-
induced CTC grade 2 HFS. Median number of S-1 cycles was 6 (range 1-36). Median time between last 
dose of capecitabine and first dose of S-1 was 11 days (range 1-49). Reason for discontinuation of S-1 
was progression of disease in 24 patients (51%), toxicity in 6 patients (13%), and other reasons in 11 
patients (23%). Other reasons were a wait-and-see strategy in 9 patients, patient request in one patient 
(patient wished to continue with alternative medicine and was subsequently lost to follow-up), and head 
trauma upon which the clinical condition did not allow to resume treatment in one patient. In 6 patients 
(13%) S-1 treatment was still ongoing at the time of analysis. S-1 treatment discontinuation was due 
to mucositis grade 2, fever grade 2 and ongoing fatigue grade 1 (1 pt) terminal ileitis grade 2, proteinuria 
grade 3, hypertension grade 2 and deterioration of pre-existing renal insufficiency (1 pt), nausea grade 
2 and abdominal cramps grade 1 (1 pt), nausea grade 2 and fatigue grade 2 (1 pt), diarrhea grade 2 
and fatigue grade 2 (1 pt), and interstitial pneumonitis grade 2 (1 pt). Reported events of proteinuria, 
hypertension and renal impairment, which however were all considered related to bevacizumab by the 
local  investigator,  and  interstitial  pneumonitis  which  is  discussed  below  in  further  detail.  All  toxicities 
were reversible. 
Dose reductions of S-1 were applied in 7 patients (15%). Reasons for dose reductions were ongoing HFS 
grade 2 (1 pt), ongoing oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (1 pt), thrombocytopenia grade 1 (1 
pt),  mucositis grade 2 (2 pts), mucositis grade 2 and fever grade 2 and ongoing fatigue grade 1 (1 pt), 
and diarrhea grade 1 and abdominal cramps grade 1 (1 pt). 
Toxicities that occurred during treatment with S-1 which were not observed during prior treatment with 
capecitabine  were  documented  in  26  patients  (55%),  and  were  fever  grade  3  and  ileus  grade  2, 
considered related to progression of primary tumour (one patient), pulmonary embolism grade 3 with 
accompanying chest pain grade 2 (1 pt), pulmonary embolism grade 3 (1 pt), mucositis grade 2 (2 pt), 
mucositis grade 2 and fever grade 2 (1 pt), terminal ileitis grade 2, vomiting grade 1 and fatigue grade 
1 in combination with bevacizumab-related proteinuria, hypertension and impaired renal function (see 
above) (1 pt), nausea grade 2 and fatigue grade 2 (1 pt), diarrhea grade 2 (1 pt), diarrhea grade 1, 
mucositis  grade  2  and  fatigue  grade  1  (1  pt),  diarrhea  grade  2  and  fatigue  grade  2  (1  pt), 
thrombocytopenia grade 2 and mucositis grade 1 (1 pt), diarrhea grade 1, mucositis grade 1, fever grade 
2, and terminal ileitis grade 1 (1 pt), mucositis grade 1 (1 pt), mucositis grade 1, anorexia grade 1 and 
HFS grade 1 (1 pt), thrombocytopenia grade 1 (1 pt), neutropenia grade 1 (1 pt), abdominal cramps 
grade 1 (1 pt), diarrhea grade 1 and abdominal cramps grade 1 (2 pt), diarrhea grade 1 (2 pt), pain 
grade  2  considered  related  to  vertebral  osteoporotic  fracture  (1),  abdominal  cramps  grade  1  (1  pt), 
anorexia grade 1 (1 pt), and fever grade 1 (1 pt). 
According to the results provided, in all patients experiencing HFS during treatment with capecitabine, 
the  severity  of  this  AE  decreased  or  completely  resolved  during  treatment  with  S-1.  Several  patients 
continued to experience the same grade of HFS during the first treatment cycle of S-1, possibly due to 
lack of delay between stop of capecitabine and start of S-1. One patient developed grade 1 HFS during 
treatment with S-1. 
No case of recurrence of cardiac toxicity was reported in any of the 10 patients who switched to S-1 due 
to cardiac adverse events. 
Two patients (4%) experienced terminal ileitis during S-1 treatment, considered probably related to S-
1 in at least one of the two patients. One patient (2%) experienced interstitial pneumonitis that fully 
recovered after discontinuation of S-1. This patient had experienced the same symptoms and radiological 
abnormalities during a capecitabine-based treatment administered one year previously. 
Two patients developed pulmonary embolism.

Extrapolation of Asian patient data to Western patients 
There  are  known  differences  in  the  safety  profile  of  fluoropyrimidines,  particularly  with  respect  to  GI 
toxicity,  in  different  regions  of  the  world  (Haller  et  al.,  2008;  Shirao  et  al.,  2004).  The  reasons  for 
regional differences in toxicity caused by fluoropyrimidines are not completely understood. In terms of 
safety,  two  published  meta-analyses  have  been  presented  by  the  MAH  in  support  of  extrapolation  of 
efficacy between Asian and Western patients. (Ter Veer et al., 2016; Ter Veer et al., 2017). Regarding 
safety, toxicity profiles capecitabine, 5FU and S-1 were different between Asian and Western patients. 
Western patients had lower rates of catheter-related complications, grade 3-4 mucositis and stomatitis, 
febrile neutropenia, and toxicity-related deaths and higher rates of grade 1-2 hand-foot syndrome with 
S-1 compared to 5-FU regimens while Asian patients had more grade 1-2 abdominal pain and grade 3-
4 fatigue but less grade 1-2 nausea, neutropenia, and weight loss with S-1 compared to 5-FU regimens. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new information has been provided on this issue. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
SALTO study 
Seven patients, all treated with capecitabine, discontinued treatment due to HFS (10% vs 0%, p=0.013).  
SOFT study 
Treatment was postponed, discontinued, or skipped, or the dose was reduced or escalated in 51% (1660 
out of 3284) cycles in the mFOLFOX6-B arm (calculated up to 24 cycles) and in 56% (1215 out of 2183) 
cycles in the SOX-B arm. The fluorouracil dose was reduced at least once in 59% (146/249) of patients 
in the mFOLFOX6-B arm compared with 53% (133/250) in the S-1 arm. The rate of discontinuation due 
to AEs and/or patient refusal was similar in both arms (51%). 
SOX vs CAPOX study 
No information over rate of discontinuation due to AEs can be retrieved in the published article (Hong et 
al., 2012).

No information over rate of discontinuation due to AEs can be retrieved in the published article (Yamada 
et al., 2018).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety  
The  safety  database  provided  in  support  of  the  new  indication  sought  by  the  MAH  for  S-1  consists 
essentially  of  a  bibliographic  review  of  articles  and  case  reports.  Information  in  several  of  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/2190/2022 
Page 126/127 
 
 
 
 
articles/case reports/posters is limited, challenging any critical assessment of the S1 related toxicity in 
the intended setting.  
A medical need is recognized for the population covered by the modified wording of indication proposed 
by the MAH, i.e. patients experiencing intolerable HFS and cardiac toxicity during treatment with another 
fluoropyrimidine. UFT has been approved in mCRC as an alternative fluoropyrimidine with reported lower 
incidence  of  HFS  but  it  is  not  available  in  all  EU  Countries.  Reiterating  evidence  is  available  in  the 
literature indicating lower incidence of HFS and cardiac toxicity associated with S-1 in comparison with 
capecitabine/5FU in Asian and Caucasian patients. Differences in production of specific cardiotoxic and 
dermatotoxic  metabolites  have  been  advocated  in  the  literature  as  basis  of  the  observed  diversity  in 
toxicity  profile  of  the  various  fluoropyrimidine  compounds.  The  safety  results of  the  SALTO  study  are 
considered  relevant  on  this  regard,  as  a  prospective  head  to  head  comparison  between  S-1  and 
capecitabine was performed in an European mCRC patient population. Evaluation of HFS was the primary 
study endpoint. In the SALTO study treatment with S-1 was associated with a lower incidence of HFS 
(45% vs 73%, respectively; grade 3: 4% vs 21%, respectively), but higher incidence of diarrhoea (69% 
vs 48%; grade ≥3: 16% vs 12%), anorexia (41% vs 29%; grade ≥3: 13% vs 3%), vomiting (30% vs 
19%), fatigue (79% vs 74%), hypertension (43% vs 35%) and proteinuria (20% vs 9%). The substantial 
S-1  treatment  related  toxicity  in  Western  patients  is  further  underscored  by  the  safety  results  of  the 
NORDIC9 study, in particular related to the full-dose S-1 monotherapy arm. The studies performed in 
Asian mCRC patients comparing combination therapies containing S-1 vs other fluoropyrimidines (i.e., 
capecitabine, 5FU) (i.e., CAPOX vs SOX, SOFT, TRICOLORE, FIRIS) support a lower incidence of HFS and 
sometimes of sensory neuropathy associated with S-1 treatment. However, they also frequently report 
higher  incidence  of  diarrhoea,  anorexia  and  haematological  toxicity  with  S-1  compared  with  other 
fluoropyrimidines. Moreover, extrapolation of safety from Asian to Caucasian is hampered by the well-
known  differences  identified  in  S-1  pharmacodynamics  and  toxicity  between  Asians  and  Caucasians. 
Reiterating warnings for caution on this issue are reported in the studies published in the literature and 
the  safety  results  of  the  two  published  meta-analyses  presented  by  the  MAH  further  underscore  this 
uncertainty.  The  uncertainty  is  reflected  also  by  the  different  doses  of  S-1  as  monotherapy  or  in 
combination regimens implemented in Phase 1-3 studies performed to date in Caucasians compared with 
Asian  population.  Therefore,  from  a  safety  point  of  view,  extrapolation  of  results  and  S-1  dose 
recommendations from Asians to Caucasians merely on the basis of theoretical argumentations is not 
considered acceptable.  
Regarding  the  proposed  switch  from  another  fluoropyrimidine  to  S-1  in  case  of  development  of 
intolerable HFS, the retrospective study published by Kwakman et al (Acta Oncologica 2017) including 
141 western cancer patients supports this strategy. Indeed, according to the results presented in the 
article,  switching  from  capecitabine  to  S-1  was  able  to  reduce  HFS  severity  in  94%  of  patients,  with 
complete resolution of HFS-related symptoms in 56% of patients. Treatment with S-1 in these patients 
was reasonably well-tolerated, as indicated by the median number of cycles received by the patients (5, 
range 1-13) and the percentage of treatment discontinuations (7.6%), dose reductions (21%) and delays 
(15%) due to S-1 related AEs. The retrospective nature of the data remains of concern as well as the 
relatively low number of patients included in the study. Additional supportive evidence is represented by 
the analysis of a subgroup of patients enrolled in the Dutch Prospective Colorectal Cancer Cohort (PLCRC) 
presented by the MAH in the response document to the CHMP’s RSI. 
Regarding the proposed switch from another fluoropyrimidine to S-1 in case of development of cardiac 
toxicity,  the  results  of  the  Cardioswitch  study  presented  by  the  MAH  support  the  feasibility  and 
effectiveness of this strategy. Importantly, the study was performed in a Caucasian population and dose 
regimens  of  S-1  applied  as  monotherapy  or  in  combination  regimens  appear  in  line  with  the  ones 
suggested  for  the  proposed  posology.  According  to  the  presented  results,  after  switch  to  S-1,  96% 
(n=192)  of  patients  were  able  to  continue  treatment  without  recurrent  cardiac  events.  Recurrent 
Assessment report

cardiotoxicity was observed in 8 (4%) patients (competing risk 95 CI 0.02-7.89), with cardiac events at 
recurrence being limited to grade 1-2 severity, allowing continuation of S-1 based treatment in all but 
three patients. The success rate reported in this study is substantially higher than what is expected on 
the  basis  of  alternative  strategies  applied  in  clinical  practice  reported  in  the  literature,  such  as 
rechallenge  with  concomitant  cardiac  medication,  dose  reduction  or  switch  to  a  different  dosing 
regimen/formulation  (e.g.,  from  capecitabine  or  infusional  5-FU  to  bolus  5-FU).  Treatment  with  S-1 
appears to be reasonably tolerated, as also suggested by the number of treatment cycles received by 
patients and the high percentage of patients achieving the number of cycles planned at the beginning of 
treatment. However, it is emphasized that no accurate assessment can be made over the non-cardiac 
safety profile of S-1 in these patients, as according to the provided study protocol only cardiac adverse 
events were systematically collected. This represents a limitation of the submitted database, together 
with the retrospective nature of the analyses presented. Another relevant limitation is the heterogeneity 
of  the  population  enrolled  in  the  dataset  in  terms  of  primary  tumour  type,  as  all  tumour  types  were 
allowed in the study, with CRC representing 78% of the enrolled population (n=156). Further support to 
the proposed strategy is provided by another case series (published by Kwakman) of 7 cancer patients 
(of which 2 with mCRC) switching to S-1 (administered at different dose regimens) after capecitabine-
induced coronary vasospasm, with none of the patients experiencing any signs or symptoms related to 
recurrent cardiac toxicity (Kwakman et al., EJC 2017). 
Overall, S-1 related toxicity reported in the studies presented by the MAH in support of the new indication 
appears in line with the known safety profile of the drug. Two events of terminal ileitis, one of which 
probably related to S1, have been reported, and the specific term is added as an ADR to the SmPC. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Despite the identified limitations of the database presented, the overall body of evidence regarding safety 
is considered sufficient to support the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed switch from another 
fluoropyrimidine to S-1 in patients with mCRC developing intolerable HFS or cardiac toxicity.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Teysuno is indicated in adults as monotherapy or in combination with oxaliplatin or irinotecan, with or 
without bevacizumab, for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer for whom it is not 
possible  to  continue  treatment  with  another  fluoropyrimidine  due  to  hand-foot  syndrome  or 
cardiovascular toxicity that developed in the adjuvant or metastatic setting. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Generally, in the metastatic setting of CRC the typical first-line chemotherapy contains a fluoropyrimidine 
(intravenous fluorouracil (i.v. 5-FU) or oral capecitabine) used in various combinations and schedules 
with  irinotecan  or  oxaliplatin.  Biologicals  (i.e.,  anti-VEGF  and  anti-EGFR)  are  also  indicated  for 
combination in the first-line treatment, unless use is contraindicated. Second-line treatment depends on 
the type of prior therapy administered. According to ESMO guidelines, patients should receive all three 
available cytotoxic agents (fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan) and all targeted treatments (anti-

VEGF and, if RAS wild-type, anti-EGFR) during the course of the treatment whenever possible, although 
the optimal sequence is not known. For third-line therapy, cetuximab or panitumumab monotherapy can 
be  considered  in  RAS  wild-type  and  BRAF  wild-type  patients  not  previously  treated  with  anti-EGFR 
antibodies.  Alternative  options  are  regorafenib  and  trifluridine/tipiracil  (van  Cutsem  et  al.,  Annals  of 
Oncology,  2016).  For  specific  biomarker-defined  subgroups  the  combination  of  encorafenib  and 
cetuximab  (tumours  with  BRAF  V600E  mutation)  or  NTRK-inhibitors  (larotrectinib  and  entrectinib  for 
NTRK gene fusion positive tumours) are approved. Checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab is approved to 
treat MSI-H tumours. 
Despite all new developments, chemotherapy remains the backbone of first-line systemic treatment with 
fluoropyrimidine as basis. As an alternative to i.v. 5-FU, the oral fluoropyrimidine capecitabine has been 
developed. Capecitabine has been shown to be non-inferior compared to i.v. 5-FU regarding efficacy. 
The safety profile is different for oral capecitabine versus the i.v. alternatives, with for example higher 
frequencies of hand-foot syndrome (HFS) and cardiotoxicity with capecitabine. There is therefore still a 
need for the development of alternatives of intravenous 5-FU or capecitabine, especially in patients who 
have to discontinue treatment due to cardiotoxicity or HFS. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
To support the indication, the MAH summarised study results described in literature and performed a 
meta-analysis (Derksen et al., 2021, in preparation). 
As  pivotal  evidence  for  the  target  population,  retrospective  and  exploratory  data  in  the  EU  target 
population of patients who switched to S-1 after toxicity on another fluoropyrimidine were provided. The 
first  results  are  from  the  retrospective  CardioSwitch  study  that  included  53  mCRC  European  patients 
who were switched to S-1-based therapy after development of cardiotoxicity on another fluoropyrimidine 
. In addition, data is reported from a retrospective analysis of data from a prospectively collected Dutch 
database (PLCRC Switch Cohort Study) that evaluated long-term safety in 47 mCRC patients who were 
switched to S-1 regimens after development of either cardiotoxicity or HFS on capecitabine . 
As supportive evidence, data from patients who started first- or second-line treatment at baseline were 
described.  Using  a  systemic  literature  search  for  prospective  phase  II  or  III  randomised  clinical  trials 
comparing S-1 based versus 5-FU or capecitabine-based palliative therapy in adult patients with mCRC, 
10  studies  were  identified  to  be  used  in  the  meta-analysis.  The  included  studies  investigated  first  or 
second line therapy of S-1 monotherapy or in combination with irinotecan or oxaliplatin (with or without 
bevacizumab). In total 1062 patients were treatment with S-1 based therapies and 1055 with 5-FU or 
capecitabine-based therapies. PFS was the primary outcome for the meta-analysis with OS and ORR as 
secondary outcomes. HR for PFS and OS were reported in 6 studies. Non-inferiority for S-1 based therapy 
compared to 5-FU or capecitabine-based therapy was concluded when the upper limit of the 99% CI of 
the pooled HR was lower than 1.25. 
Next to the meta-analysis, supportive efficacy and safety results were provided by the following phase 
3, randomised studies in mCRC patients investigating S-1 versus another fluoropyrimidine, which were 
also included in the meta-analysis:

3.2.  Favourable effects 
Pivotal evidence 
In  support  of  the  target  population,  exploratory  and  retrospective  efficacy  data  of  European  mCRC 
patients  who  switched  to  S-1  based  therapies  after  toxicity  during  treatment  with  another 
fluoropyrimidine is provided.. Median OS was 26 months (95% CI 22-31 months) in 53 mCRC patients 
who  switched  due  to  cardiotoxicity.  In  another  cohort  of  47  mCRC  patients  who  switched  after 
development  of  HFS  or  cardiotoxicity  while  on  capecitabine,  median  time  from  initiation  of  treatment 
with capecitabine to first documented progression of disease after initiation of treatment with S-1 was 
414 days (95% CI 332-568 days). When only the 36 patients who switched from capecitabine to S-1 for 
reason of HFS were considered, median PFS was 414 days (95%CI: 332-629). 
Supportive evidence 
Supportive evidence of patients who are randomised at baseline to either S-1 based therapy or another 
fluoropyridimine-based therapy is also provided. The meta-analysis by Derksen et al. reported a pooled 
HR for the primary endpoint PFS of 0.95 with the upper boundary of the 99% CI being 1.08. OS was a 
secondary outcome in the studies included in the meta-analysis and showed a pooled HR of 0.93 with 
an upper CI99% bound of 1.07. Based on a pooled risk ratio for response, RR was 1.06 with an upper 
CI99% bound of 1.24. No suggestion of important heterogeneity was observed for PFS and OS and a 
moderate heterogeneity for ORR. 
To  support  efficacy  of  S-1  compared  to  another  fluoropyrimidine,  efficacy  results  were  also  provided 
from  individual  studies  performed  in  patients  who  were  randomised  at  baseline  to  a  treatment  arm 
containing S-1 or another fluoropyrimidine. The results of these studies were also included in the meta-
analysis. No significant differences were found for PFS, RR, and OS between the treatment groups. Four 
randomised phase 3 studies investigated S-1 combination therapy with either oxaliplatin or irinotecan in 
Asian  patients  and  supported  that  S-1  had  non-inferior  efficacy  to  combination  therapy  with  5-FU  or 
capecitabine when patients are randomised at baseline. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
First of all, there are limitations inherent to the use of literature as basis for the support of favourable 
effects. These pertain to differences in posology and the need for extrapolation from the patients who 
were studied in the clinical trials to the intended target population. 
Regarding available data in the EU target population of patients who switched to S-1 after toxicity on 
another  fluoropyrimidine,  only  retrospective,  non-comparative  and  exploratory  efficacy  data  are 
provided.  The  interpretation  of these  data  are,  furthermore,  limited  by  the  small  number  of  patients, 
heterogeneity of the treatment schedules and varying timing of the switch to S-1.  
Assessment report  
EMA/2190/2022 
Page 131/132 
 
 
 
 
 
Lastly,  on  the  choice  for  180  mg/m2  irinotecan  as  recommended  posology,  most  studies  and  clinical 
practice use a higher dose of 200 mg/m2 and a range of 150-225 mg/m2 is reported. This is reflected in 
the SmPC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The S-1-related toxicity in mCRC as reported in the submitted application appears at a high level in line 
with  the  already  known  safety  profile  of  the  drug.  The  data  support  the  presence  of  inter-ethnic 
differences in the tolerability of S-1. 
In the SALTO study comparing capecitabine to S-1 (with or without bevacizumab) in a western previously 
untreated mCRC population, treatment with S-1 was associated with a lower incidence of HFS (45% vs 
73%, respectively; grade 3: 4% vs 21%, respectively), and higher incidence of diarrhoea (69% vs 48%; 
grade  ≥3:  16%  vs  12%),  anorexia  (41%  vs  29%;  grade  ≥3:  13%  vs  3%),  vomiting  (30%  vs  19%), 
fatigue (79% vs 74%), hypertension (43% vs 35%) and proteinuria (20% vs 9%).  
Several studies (CAPOX vs SOX, SOFT, TRICOLORE, FIRIS) performed in Asian mCRC patients comparing 
combination therapies containing S-1 vs other fluoropyrimidines (i.e., capecitabine, 5FU) support a lower 
incidence  of  HFS  and  sometimes  of  sensory  neuropathy  associated  with  S-1  treatment  and  a  higher 
incidence of diarrhoea, anorexia and haematological toxicity.  
The  retrospective  study  published  by  Kwakman  et  al  (Acta  Oncologica  2017)  including  141  western 
cancer  patients  switching  from  capecitabine  to  S-1  due  to  HFS  provides  evidence  in  support  of  the 
feasibility of the switch from capecitabine to S-1 in patients experiencing significant HFS. According to 
the results presented in the article, the switching strategy from capecitabine to S-1 was able to reduce 
HFS severity in 94% of patients, with complete resolution of HFS-related symptoms in 56% of patients. 
Treatment with S-1 in these patients was reasonably well-tolerated, as indicated by the median number 
of  cycles  received  by  the  patients  (5,  range  1-13)  and  the  percentage  of  treatment  discontinuations 
(7.6%), dose reductions (21%) and delays (15%) due to S-1 related AEs. 
In a subgroup of 53 mCRC patients, within the Cardioswitch cohort study of 200 patients with different 
solid  tumours,  the  majority  of  these  mCRC  patients  (92%)  who  developed  cardiotoxicity  while  on 
capecitabine-  or  5-FU-based  chemotherapy  could  safely  switch  to  S-1  and  continue  treatment,  with 
recurrent  cardiotoxicity  (grade  1)  seen  in  8%.    Other  adverse  events  during  S-1  treatment  in  this 
subgroup  included  grade  3-4  haematologic  toxicity  in  8%  and  grade  2-4  non-haematologic  adverse 
events in  36% (neuropathy 15%, infection 7%, thromboembolic event 6%, diarrhoea 4%, nausea 2%, 
hand-foot syndrome 2%).  
In another case series of 7 cancer patients (of which 2 with mCRC) switching to S-1 (administered at 
different dose regimens) after capecitabine-induced coronary vasospasm a median of 4 cycles (range 2-
15) of S-1 was administered, with none of the patients experiencing any signs or symptoms related to 
recurrent cardiac toxicity (Kwakman et al., EJC 2017). 
In a retrospective  cohort study of 47 metastatic colorectal cancer patients from the Dutch colorectal 
cancer  registry  (PLCRC  Switch  Cohort  Study)  switching  to  S-1  due  to  capecitabine-induced  hand-foot 
syndrome (n=36) or cardiotoxicity (n=10) the severity of HFS decreased or completely resolved during 
treatment with S-1 and no case of recurrence of cardiac toxicity was reported in any of the 10 patients 
that switched to S-1 due to cardiac adverse events.   
Two cases of terminal ileitis have been identified, one of which considered probably related to treatment 
with S1. Terminal ileitis is added to the SmPC as it represents a specific condition and the terms related 
to gastrointestinal toxicity currently present are not considered sufficient to cover this specific event.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety database as provided consists essentially of a bibliographic review of articles and case reports 
published.  Information  in  several  of  the  articles/case  reports/posters  is  very  limited,  challenging  any 
critical assessment of the S-1 related toxicity in the intended setting. A section has been added to the 
SmPC with a description of the safety database in support of the new proposed indication in order to 
reflect the limitations of the data available. 
Uncertainties are identified based on the retrospective and non-comparative nature of the data presented 
to  support  a  switching  strategy  to  S-1  in  patients  unable  to  continue  treatment  with  another 
fluoropyrimidine due to HFS or cardiac toxicity as well as the limited number of (mCRC) patients included 
in the analyses. 
In the Cardioswitch study, no accurate assessment can be made of the non-cardiac toxicity profile of S-
1  in  this  specific  target  population,  as  according  to  the  provided  study  protocol  only  cardiac  adverse 
events were systematically collected.  
Another limitation of the Cardioswitch study is the heterogeneity of the population enrolled in the dataset 
in terms of primary tumour type (as patients with CRC were 78% of the enrolled population (n=156)) 
and of the different dose regimens and posologies implemented. 
The studies where S-1 combination treatments have been administered to mCRC (i.e., SOX vs CAPOX, 
SOFT, TRICOLORE, FIRIS) have all been performed in non-Caucasian patients. Safety extrapolation from 
Asians  to  Caucasians  (including  the  applicable  S-1  dose  regimens  in  the  different  combinations)  is 
hampered by the reported ethnic differences in S-1 pharmacodynamics and toxicity.  
A  section  has  been  added  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  with  description  of  the  safety  database  in  the 
population covered by this new indication,

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In this type II variation, the MAH applies for an extension of the indication for the treatment of mCRC 
patients  where  the  current  chemotherapy  cannot  be  continued  due  to  fluoropyrimidine  intolerability 
causing cardiotoxicity or HFS. Without the option to continue an effective therapy with fluoropyrimidines 
due to toxicity, there is a potential loss of extended overall survival and the unmet medical need is fully 
acknowledged. S-1 is designed to reduce the rate of degradation of 5-FU and its conversion to its toxic 
phosphorylated  metabolite  and  can,  therefore,  hypothetically  act  as  an  alternative  to  patients  where 
continuation with another fluoropyrimidine is not an option. 
In  support  for  the  indication,  the  MAH  provided  retrospectively  collected  efficacy  data  in  European 
patients who switched to S-1 because of cardiotoxicity or HFS on another fluoropyrimidine. Although the 
interpretation of these data is hampered by the retrospective and non-comparative nature, it provides 
evidence that fluoropyrimidine activity is not lost after switching to S-1. In addition, the MAH performed 
a literature search and meta-analysis of randomised phase II and III clinical trials. The meta-analysis 
showed that S-1 based therapy was non-inferior to 5-FU or capecitabine-based therapy regarding PFS 
in first and second line therapy using a non-inferiority margin of 1.25. Secondary outcomes of OS and 
ORR supported this finding. Although the HR for PFS in the second line subgroup has an upper bound of 
Assessment report  
EMA/2190/2022 
Page 134/135 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the 99% CI above 1.25, this is only based on one study. Another study performed in second line that 
was not included in the meta-analysis as only median PFS was reported, showed a median PFS of 8.5 
months in the S-1+irinotecan+bevacizumab arm versus 8.2 months in the mFOLFIRI+bevacizumab arm. 
Combined with the finding that the 99% CI upper bound for OS was <1.25 in the second line subgroup, 
excluding the subgroup treated in second line is not considered necessary. 
Pharmacokinetics  were  not  found  to  be  clinically  significantly  different  between  ethnic  groups.  In 
addition, based on data from studies with S-1 in gastric cancer, there are no observed differences in 
efficacy between Asian and Western patients due to ethnic variations. However, extrapolation of safety 
remains hampered by the identified ethnic differences in S-1 tolerability. As a consequence, there is still 
an uncertainty regarding the posology for the S-1 combination with irinotecan, which is reflected in the 
SmPC section 4.2. 
It is acknowledged that a randomised controlled trial in a population that cannot be treated with another 
fluoropyrimidines  is  not  feasible  due  to  the  lack  of  a  proper  control.  Although  there  is  formally  no 
evidence  whether  efficacy  is  comparable  between  patients  started  at  baseline  with  S-1  or  another 
fluoropyrimidine  and  patients  who  switch  to  S-1  after  fluoropyrimidine-associated  toxicity,  it  is  not 
possible  to  gather  this  information  as  the  treatment  options  for  patients  become  limited  when  5-FU 
cannot be used. In addition, based on the MoA it is not expected that efficacy of S-1 will be different in 
patients who switch compared to those initiating therapy with S-1. Therefore, S-1 can be regarded as a 
treatment  option  considering  the  perspective  of  not  being  able  to  use  another  fluoropyrimidine.  The 
newly performed meta-analysis supports non-inferiority of the efficacy of S-1 based regimens compared 
to 5-FU or capecitabine-based regimens as first or second line treatment in mCRC. Taken together with 
exploratory data in an European population that switched from another fluoropyrimidine to S-1 due to 
toxicity,  it  is  agreed  that  S-1  is  a  valuable  treatment  option  in  patients  not  able  to  continue 
fluoropyrimidine treatment. 
Regarding safety, relevant limitations of the provided dataset have been identified, essentially related 
to the retrospective and uncontrolled nature of the data, the limited sample size and the heterogeneity 
in terms of cancer population included and regimens/posologies applied. The challenges associated with 
the  known  ethnic  differences  in  S-1  pharmacodynamics  and  safety  further  complicate  the  safety 
assessment.  On  the  other  hand,  the overall  body  of  evidence  supports  an  a  priori  reduced  chance  of 
developing  HFS  during  treatment  with  S-1  compared  with  capecitabine/5FU  (refer  to  SALTO  study 
results) due to intrinsic differences of the safety profile of the drugs. Moreover, the several case series 
presented  consistently  support  the  feasibility  and  effectiveness  of  the  switch  from  another 
fluoropyrimidine to S-1 in case of intolerable HFS and/or cardiac toxicity, where the need for alternative 
strategies in order to continue anticancer treatment is obvious.  
While only a few patients treated in the adjuvant setting were included in the studies that form the basis 
of this application, it is to be expected that HFS or cardiovascular toxicity will recur when patients will 
subsequently be treated with 5-FU or capecitabine in the metastatic setting. Furthermore, the posology 
of 5-FU/capecitabine and the combinations in which they are used in the adjuvant and metastatic setting 
are similar. Therefore, it is supported to include this population in the indication. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy  and  safety  data  in  European  patients  who  switched  to  S-1  after  toxicity  on  another 
fluoropyrimidine is considered established based on the provided data. By providing patients who have 
to  discontinue  another  fluoropyrimidine  with  an  alternative  option  which  has  a  similar  mechanism  of 
action,  patients  will  be  able  to  continue  effective  systemic  treatment  and  the  initiation  of  salvage 
regimens can be postponed. In this population the benefits outweigh the risks and the B/R is considered 
positive. 
Assessment report  
EMA/2190/2022 
Page 135/136 
 
 
 
 
It  is  also  considered  that  the  same  unmet  medical  need  applies  to  patients  who  developed  HFS  or 
cardiovascular toxicity on another fluoropyrimidine in the adjuvant setting for colorectal cancer. As the 
B/R  is  also  positive  in  this  population,  it  is  supported  to  include  in  the  indication  the  patients  who 
developed HFS or cardiovascular toxicity in the adjuvant setting in addition to metastatic patients. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable.

Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Isentress 
Raltegravir 
On 18 October 2012, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product Isentress. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Merck Sharp & 
Dohme Ltd. They may request a re examination of the CHMP opinion, provided that they notify the 
European Medicines Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
The extension adopted by the CHMP is to add two new strengths and a new pharmaceutical form 
(25 mg and 100 mg Chewable tablets) to the existing product range.  
The CHMP also adopted a change to an indication, as follows2: 
“ISENTRESS is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment 
of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adults, adolescents, and children from the 
age of 2 years. (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).” 
Detailed conditions for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after the variation to the 
marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 
within 44 days (Type II variations) and 67 days (Annex II applications) from adoption of the opinion. 
2 The text in bold represents the new or the amended indication.

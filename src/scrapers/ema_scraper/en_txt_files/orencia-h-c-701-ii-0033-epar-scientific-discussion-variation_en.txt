1.  Scientific discussion  
1.1.  Introduction 
Abatacept  is  a  fusion  protein  that  consists  of  the  extracellular  domain  of  human  CTLA-4  linked  to  a 
modified Fc portion of human IgG1. Abatacept reversibly binds to CD 80/86 on antigen presenting cells 
via its CTLA-4 portion preventing the interaction of CD 80/86 with CD28 on T cells and thus inhibiting 
full T-cell activation. 
In the EU, abatacept, in combination with methotrexate, is approved for the treatment of moderate to 
severe  active  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA)  in  adult  patients  who  have  had  an  insufficient  response  or 
intolerance  to  other  disease-modifying  anti-rheumatic  drugs  including  at  least  one  tumour  necrosis 
factor  (TNF)  inhibitor.  A  reduction  in  the  progression  of  joint  damage  and  improvement  of  physical 
function have been demonstrated during combination treatment with abatacept and methotrexate.  
The medicinal product is available as a 250 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion and is 
to be administered intravenously.  
This type II variation was submitted to extend the adult patient population for which abatacept can be 
used  to  include  MTX-naive  patients  with  severe,  active,  and  progressive  early  disease  and  MTX-
inadequate  responders  (IR)  in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  active  rheumatoid  arthritis.  The 
applicant did not request scientific advice in relation to this development. With regard to the paediatric 
development, the applicant has received a waiver for the condition “rheumatoid arthritis”. As abatacept 
is  a  protein  composed  of  natural  amino  acids,  the  product  is  exempt  from  the  preparation  of  an 
Environmental Risk Assessment in accordance with the applicable guideline. 
The initially applied for extension of indication read as follows: 
“ORENCIA  in  combination  with  methotrexate  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe 
active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who responded inadequately to previous therapy with one 
or more disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs including methotrexate (MTX). 
ORENCIA  in  combination  with  methotrexate  is  also  indicated  in  the  treatment  of  severe,  active  and 
progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated with methotrexate.”. 
The finally approved extension of indication reads as follows:  
“ORENCIA  in  combination  with  methotrexate  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe 
active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who responded inadequately to previous therapy with one 
or  more  disease-modifying  anti-rheumatic  drugs  including  methotrexate  (MTX)  or  a  TNF-alpha 
inhibitor.” 
1.2.  Clinical aspects 
3.2.1 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
The pharmacokinetics of abatacept in healthy adults and adults with RA are well characterized and are 
summarized  in  the  current  product  information.  Blood  samples  for  further  evaluation  of  the  PK  of 
abatacept were not collected in the relevant studies supporting this application.  
For  completeness,  additional  pharmacokinetic  data  was  provided  from  several  completed  studies 
(IM101013, IM101128, IM101063, IM101015). None of this data were assessed to have impact on the 
product information.

The  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  abatacept  in  adults  with  moderate  to  severe  RA  have  been 
characterized  and  are  summarized  in  the  current  product  information.  Pharmacodynamic  data  were 
also collected and assessed in IM101023. 
3.2.2 CLINICAL EFFICACY 
The  initial  marketing  authorisation  application  (MAA)  included  data  from  placebo-controlled  clinical 
studies  investigating  the  use  of  abatacept  for  the  treatment  of  rheumatoid  arthritis  after  inadequate 
response  to  DMARDs  including  MTX  (MTX-inadequate  responders  (IR)  and  TNF-antagonists  (TNF-
inadequate  responders  (IR)).  These  previously  assessed  data  are  also  of  relevance  for  the  present 
extension application. The present application is additionally supported by the following studies: 
• 
Efficacy  and  safety  data  from  4,632  subjects  that  have  accumulated,  through  the  long  term  (LT) 
periods of the pivotal Phase 2/3 studies in the MTX-IR and TNF-IR populations representing safety 
experience  with  4,149  subjects  for  up  to  8  years  (11,658  person-years  (p-y)  of  clinical  study 
exposure); see Figure 1 for details about the studies covered. 
•  A  new  pivotal  study  (IM101023)  conducted  in  483  subjects  with  early  RA  (< 2  years  of  disease 
onset)  with  severe  disease,  prognostic  factors  predictive  of  progressive  disease  (erosion  on  x-ray 
and seropositive for RF or CCP, and who have not been previously treated with MTX (MTX-naive); 
•  Data  from  the  post-marketing  experience  (~32,187  p-y  experience),  the  majority  of  which  was 
from  regions  where  abatacept  was  approved  for  use  without  restriction  of  prior  failure  to  other 
therapies.

*Integrated Population = Pooled Studies utilized in 
the Safety Analyses 
Due  to  differences  in  the  subject  population  across  all  studies,  the  efficacy  data  were  not  deemed 
appropriate for pooling. In addition, given that each of the studies was statistically powered, and that 
there  was  consistency  of  efficacy  observed  across  all  the  studies  (within  each  population),  the 
additional value of pooling to interpret efficacy results would be limited. 
The  Clinical  trials  were  performed  in  accordance  with  GCP  as  claimed  by  the  MAH.  The  MAH  has 
provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out 
in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

METHODS 
This  was  a  multi-national,  randomized,  double-blind  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
abatacept in MTX-naïve subjects with early, erosive RA.  
Study Participants  
The  subjects  enrolled  in  this  study  must  have  been  MTX-naïve  prior  to  study  start  or  their  prior 
exposure  to  MTX  must  have  been  ≤  10 mg  per  week  for  not  more  than  3  weeks  and  no  dose  for  3 
months prior to signing the informed consent. The aim of the study was to recruit patients with severe 
progressive RA. The following inclusion criteria highlight the patient population:  
(cid:190)  RA for ≤ 2 years 
(cid:190)  high disease activity as defined by a tender joint count of at least 12, swollen joint count of at 
least 10, and a CRP of ≥ 0.45 mg/dL or ≥ 4.5 mg/L. 
(cid:190)  seropositive RA ( rheumatoid factor- or anti-CCP2 positive) 
(cid:190)  erosive disease (evidence of erosion of the hands, wrists, or feet) 
Treatments and randomisation 
Subjects  were  randomized  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  receive  abatacept  (ABA,  10  mg/kg,  weight-tiered  dose 
based upon the subject’s body weight from the screening visit immediately prior to the Day 1 visit) or 
placebo  (PLA)  for  the  first  12  months  of  treatment.  In  addition,  both  groups  received  methotrexat 
(MTX) and had their dose titrated to at least 15 mg per week not to exceed 20 mg per week. After the 
first  12  months  of  treatment,  all  subjects  received  the  combination  of  ABA  +  MTX;  however,  the 
subjects,  sites,  and  radiographic  laboratory  personnel  remained  blinded  to  the  treatment  received 
during the first 12 months of the study. The first 12 months of data from this study are presented in 
this document.  
Subjects received study medication at every treatment period visit (Days 1, 15, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, 
and every 28 days thereafter). 
No adjustments in MTX or corticosteroids were permitted for the first 6 months of the study (unless the 
dose  needed  to  be  decreased  due  to  toxicity).  After  6  months  of  treatment,  adjustments  in 
corticosteroids  (equivalent  to  a  maximum  dose  of  10  mg/day  prednisone)  were  permitted,  as 
necessary.  In  addition  1  of  the  following  DMARDs  could  have  been  added  at  the  investigator’s 
discretion:  chloroquine,  hydroxychloroquine,  sulfasalazine,  gold,  or  azathioprine.  Analgesics  were 
permitted, although no adjustments to study medication dose or schedule was permitted. 
Objectives 
The  co-primary  objectives  for  this  study  were  to  compare  the  clinical  efficacy  of  abatacept  used  in 
combination with methotrexate (ABA + MTX) vs. placebo in combination with MTX (PLA + MTX) on the: 
•  Proportion  of  subjects  who  achieved  remission  at  Month  12  of  treatment,  as  defined  by  a  DAS  28- 
CRP score < 2.6 
•  Joint  damage  progression  measured  by  radiographic  evaluation  using  the  Genant-modified  Sharp 
total score at Month 12 of treatment. 
The  secondary  objectives  included  proportion  of  subjects  with  an  ACR  50  response  at  Month  12, 
disease  activity  as  measured  by  DAS  28-CRP  score  at  Month  12,  improvement  in  physical  function 
EMA/361627/2010

using  the  HAQ  Disability  Index  defined  by  a  reduction  of  at  least  0.3  from  baseline  at  Month  12, 
improvement in health-related quality of life using the Short Form 36 Questionnaire (SF-36) at Month 
12, and inhibition of joint damage progression measured by radiographic evaluation using the Genant-
modified Sharp erosion, and joint space narrowing (JSN) scores at Month 12. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The DAS 28-CRP remission  was evaluated at screening and at day 1, 15, 29,  57, 85, 113, 141, 169, 
197,  225,  253,  281,  309,  337,  365  (last  visit  of  Year  1).  Radiographs  of  the  hands,  wrists,  and  feet 
were  performed  at  screening,  Month  6,  Month  12,  and  at  the  discontinuation  visit.  Other  efficacy 
assessments (SF-36 and Fatigue VAS) were performed at screening, on days 1, 29, 85, 169, and 253. 
The  Activity  Limitation  Questionnaire  was  completed  at  all  study  days  in  the  first  12  months  of  the 
study except for Day 15.  
Sample size  
The  group  receiving  ABA  +  MTX  was  compared  with the  group  receiving  PLA  +  MTX  in  subjects  that 
were MTX-naïve at Month 12. Sample sizes were based on a 5% level (2-tailed) of significance. A total 
of 500 randomized subjects allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the active ABA + MTX group and the PLA + MTX 
group yielded a 99% power to detect a difference of 20% in DAS 28-CRP remission rate between the 2 
groups at the 5% level. This power estimate assumed a response rate of 15% at Month 12 in the PLA 
+ MTX group and an overall 15% drop-out rate. Based on the hierarchical testing procedure for the co-
primary  endpoints,  this  sample  size  allowed  the  detection  of  a  treatment  difference  of  1.6  (common 
standard deviation of 5) with a power of 90% for the mean change from baseline in total score using 
the Genant-modified Sharp method.  
Blinding (masking) 
The first 12 months of this study was double-blinded. Primary analysis was performed at Month 12, but 
subjects, sites, and the central reading lab remained blinded to the treatment received during the first 
12 months until the end of the study at Month 24.

Co-primary efficacy analysis include, in the order of sequential testing, comparison between abatacept 
in  combination  with  methotrexate  and  a  placebo  control  of  methotrexate  alone  in  remission  rate 
(EULAR-defined  DAS28  remission)  at  twelve  months  (Day  365)  and  total  sharp  scores  using  the 
Genant-modified  Sharp  method  at  twelve  months  (Day  365).  A  sequential  testing  procedure  was 
employed  for  testing  the co-primary  hypotheses  according  to  the  hierarchy  specified  above.  For each 
of  the  tests,  the  nominal  type  I  error  rate  is  set  at  5%,  therefore  this  sequential  testing  procedure 
preserves the overall type I error rate at 5%.

Figure 2 
The  discontinuation  rates  (Table  2  [referred  to  in  the  diagram  as  table  5.1])  were  similar  across 
treatment groups: 9.4% (abatacept) and 10.3% (placebo). This data rule causes no meaningful bias in 
favour of abatacept over placebo. 
Table 2 
The patient follow up rates, for both study groups, are over 90% at 12 months, the time of the primary 
efficacy analysis.  
Conduct of the Study and Numbers analysed 
The original protocol (06-May-2005) was amended eight times.  
During the first 12 months of treatment, 44 subjects (20 subjects on ABA +  MTX and 24 subjects on 
PLA + MTX) had significant protocol deviations. Since fewer than 10% of subjects in either treatment 
group had a significant protocol deviation, a ‘per-protocol’ population was not generated. 
A  scoring  technique  based  on  the  Genant-modified  Sharp  algorithm  was  used  to  assess  the 
radiographic data. Of the 509 subjects randomized and treated, 506 (99%) subjects had radiographic 
data collected at minimally 1 time point during the study. There were 484 (95%) subjects included in 
the primary radiographic analysis with data at both baseline and post-baseline (on Month 6, Month 12, 
and /or on the day of discontinuation).

Baseline data 
The  baseline  demographic  and  disease  and  other  characteristics  were  similar  for  both  treatment 
groups. The majority of subjects were white females, approximately 50 years old (table 3).

With regard to previous and baseline treatments, in general the proportions of subjects who used anti-
rheumatic  medications  at  screening/enrollment  and  at  randomization  (Day  1)  were  generally 
comparable  in  both  treatment  groups.  Most  subjects  in  both  groups  were  exposed  to  prior 
corticosteroids and NSAIDs. The  number of subjects who received MTX prior to screening was ABA  + 
MTX: 8 subjects; PLA + MTX: 2 subjects.  
Regarding  concomitant  therapy,  in  general,  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  received  corticosteroids 
(oral and/or injectable) and NSAIDs during the first 12 months of treatment were comparable for both 
groups. The proportion of subjects who received other DMARDs was higher in the PLA + MTX group at 
Days 1 to 169 (5.1%) and Days 170 to 365 (8.7%) compared with the ABA + MTX group (2.7% and 
3.5%, respectively).  
Outcomes and estimation 
When compared with the PLA + MTX group, the ABA + MTX group met both of the pre-specified clinical 
efficacy co-primary endpoints; the results are summarized below:  
Remission (DAS 28-CRP) at Month 12 
Analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  variable  for  this  study  demonstrated  that  the  percent  of  subjects 
achieving remission, as defined by DAS 28-CRP < 2.6, at Month 12 was significantly higher in the ABA 
+  MTX  group  compared  with  the  PLA  +  MTX  group:  41.4%  vs.  23.3%,  p  <  0.001).  The  statistical 
significance in the remission rate between the 2 groups was noted as early as Day 57 and  continued 
through Day 365 (Figure 2).

Figure 3 
Genant-modified Sharp Total Score at Month 12 
Subjects  in  the  ABA  +  MTX  group  had  significantly  less  progression  of  structural  damage  compared 
with the PLA + MTX group as demonstrated by the mean change from baseline in total score at Month 
12 (p = 0.040). The mean change from baseline in total scores at Month 12 for the ABA + MTX group 
(0.63)  was  almost  half  of  that  in  the  PLA  +  MTX  group  (1.06)  suggesting  an  approximate  50% 
reduction on the evolution of radiographic change when subjects were treated with ABA + MTX.  
The mean change in Total Sharp score (TSS) at 12 months was significantly lower in patients treated 
with  abatacept  plus  methotrexate  compared  to  those  treated  with  methotrexate  plus  placebo.  At 
12 months  61%  (148/242)  of  the  patients  treated  with  abatacept  plus  methotrexate  and  53% 
(128/242) of the patients treated with methotrexate plus placebo had no progression (TSS ≤ 0).  
With reference to other secondary endpoints, the following data was obtained: 
ACR Response 
At Month 12, an ACR 50 response was achieved by significantly more subjects in the ABA + MTX group 
compared  with  the  PLA  +  MTX  group:  57.4%  (CI  51%,  63%)  versus  42.3%  (CI  32%,  48%),  p  < 
0.001.  
A  significantly  greater  proportion  of  subjects  treated  with  ABA  +  MTX  had  greater  improvements  in 
ACR  20,  ACR  50,  ACR  70,  and  ACR  90  than  subjects  treated  with  PLA  +  MTX  at  Days  169  and  365. 
Continued improvement in ACR responder rates was observed between Months 6 and 12.  
Low Disease Activity (LDA) 
Statistical  significance  in  the  LDA  rate  between  the  2  groups  was  noted  as  early  as  Day  29  and 
continued through Day 365 (Figure 4).

Similar to the DAS 28-CRP remission rate and LDA results, a greater proportion of subjects in the ABA 
+ MTX group were in remission or with LDA compared to the subjects in PLA + MTX group during the 
first 12 months of treatment based on DAS 28-ESR. 
Physical Function (HAQ) 
At Month 12, significantly more subjects in the ABA + MTX group compared with the PLA + MTX group 
(71.9%  vs.  62.1%,  p  =  0.024),  achieved  a  HAQ  response  that  was  clinically  meaningful.  Statistically 
significant  responses  were  observed  as  early  as  Day  29  for  the  ABA  +  MTX  group  and  continued 
through Month 12. Greater mean reductions from baseline were observed for the HAQ disability index 
and its subscales at all timepoints for the ABA + MTX group compared with the PLA + MTX group. 
Secondary and Tertiary Radiographic Evaluation Variables  
Subjects  in  the  ABA  +  MTX  group  had  significantly  less  progression  of  structural  damage  compared 
with the PLA + MTX group as demonstrated by the mean change from baseline erosion score at Month 
12  (0.50  vs.  0.89; p  =  0.033).  There  was  less  progression  of  structural  damage  as  demonstrated  by 
the mean change from baseline in the JSN score in the ABA + MTX group (0.13) as compared with the 
PLA  +  MTX  group  (0.17)  at  Month  12;  however,  the  difference  was  not  statistically  significant.  At 
Month 6, subjects in the ABA + MTX group had less progression of structural damage compared with 
the PLA + MTX group as demonstrated by the mean change from baseline erosion (ABA + MTX = 0.40; 
PLA + MTX = 0.62), JSN (ABA + MTX = 0.08; PLA + MTX = 0.12), and total (ABA + MTX = 0.47; PLA 
+ MTX = 0.74 ) scores. A greater proportion of subjects in the ABA + MTX group (155 of 242 subjects; 
64.0%) were without radiographic progression (≤ 0 changes from baseline erosion scores) at Month 12 
as compared with subjects in the PLA + MTX group (133 of 242 subjects; 55.0%).  
Health-related Outcomes 
In the Short Form 36 Questionnaire (SF-36) For subjects treated with ABA + MTX compared with those 
treated with PLA + MTX, significantly greater improvements from baseline were observed in the PCS (p 
= 0.005) and MCS (p = 0.046) summary measures at Month 12. Greater improvements in physical and 
mental subscales were observed at Month 12 for the ABA + MTX group compared with the PLA + MTX 
group.

MTX-inadequate-responders (MTX-IR population) 
In the MTX-IR population, clinically and statistically significant efficacy of abatacept over placebo in the 
MTX-IR  population  was  demonstrated  during  the  ST  (double-blind)  period  of  all  core  RA  as  well  as 
supportive  RA  studies.  The  studies  were  already  assessed  by  the  CHMP  in  the  context  of  the  initial; 
marketing  authorisation  application;  for  further  details  see  this  assessment  report.  In  addition,  the 
following analyses were performed for the present application: 
Comparative ST Response Rates in MTX-IR 
A Bayesian meta-analysis was performed to estimate the efficacy of abatacept relative to other biologic 
DMARDs (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, and rituximab) in the management of patients with RA 
and an inadequate response and/or intolerance to non-biologic DMARDs. A systematic literature search 
was  performed  in  order  to  identify  randomized  controlled  studies  of  abatacept  and  other  biological 
DMARDs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Data were extracted from all qualifying studies (13 in 
total) with the  following features: placebo-controlled studies of at least 24-week duration in adult RA 
patients who have had prior insufficient response and/or intolerance to non-biologic DMARDs.  
The data seem to indicate that abatacept has similar efficacy when compared to infliximab, etanercept, 
and rituximab. There is a suggestion that abatacept may be less efficacious than adalimumab, however 
this  was  not  rigorously  established.  In  addition,  this  higher  efficacy  observed  in  adalimumab  may  be 
driven by 1 small Phase 2 study (n=129) in which adalimumab reported an exceptionally high ACR50 
response relative to its larger Phase 3 studies. 
Comparative LT Response Rates in MTX-IR 
A literature search on the LT efficacy results from open-label extension studies of TNF-antagonists was 
conducted  to  broadly  assess  the  LT  efficacy  of  abatacept  as  compared  to  the  currently  approved 
biologics  for  treatment  of  RA  patients  with  inadequate  response  to  at  least  1  DMARD.  Based  on  this 
comparison, it appears that the retention rate at the end of 4 years of LT therapy were comparable or 
higher in the abatacept study (73%)  compared to the 3 TNF-antagonists (56% to 74%). In addition, 
the  ACR50  and  DAS28  response  rates  were  comparable  or  higher  in  the  abatacept  study  compared 
with the 3 TNF-antagonists. 
The  MAH  concluded  that  indirect  comparison  of  the  efficacy  of  abatacept  to  the  3  TNF-antagonists 
indicates  that  the  relative  benefits  of  abatacept  are  comparable  to  TNF-antagonists  in  the  MTX-naive 
population, differences in subject disease characteristics notwithstanding and in the MTX-IR population 
during  ST  use.  After  4  years  of  LT  therapy,  in  the  MTX-IR  population,  abatacept  demonstrated  more 
favourable maintenance of LT efficacy, as evident both the higher magnitude of the absolute response 
and retention rates.  
TNF-antagonist-inadequate-responders (TNF-IR population) 
Supportive study 
•  Long  term  IM101064LT  A  Phase  3,  multi-centre,  open-label  study  to  evaluate  the 
efficacy,  tolerability,  and  safety  of  abatacept  in  subjects  with  active  rheumatoid 
arthritis  on  background  non-biologic  DMARDs  who  have  an  inadequate  response  to 
anti-TNF therapy and have limited therapeutic options 
This  study  can  be  considered  only  supportive  for  the  assessment  of  efficacy  of  abatacept  because  of 
the methodological limitation (uncontrolled, no formal statistical analysis performed, low retention rate 
of subjects etc).

Patients  included  had  active  RA  and  had  an  inadequate  response  to  previous  (washout  for  at  least 
2 months;  n=449)  or  current  (no  washout  period;  n=597)  TNF-antagonist  therapy  (Study  VII).  The 
primary objective of the long-term extension period is to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of 
abatacept in subjects who have completed the initial 6-month open-label treatment period. The results 
demonstrated  that  the  incidence  of  AEs,  SAEs,  and  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  during  6  months  of 
treatment,  was  similar  between  those  who  were  previous  and  current  TNF-antagonist  users  at 
enrollment, as was the frequency of serious infections. 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Abatacept  has  been  investigated  in  clinical  trials  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  several  active 
rheumatoid  arthritis  in  adult  patients  after  inadequate  response  to  DMARDs  including  MTX  (MTX-
inadequate  responders  (IR)  and  TNF-antagonists  (TNF-inadequate  responders  (IR)).  These  data  have 
been  assessed  in  the  context  of  previous  submissions  and  are  also  of  relevance  for  the  present 
extension application.  
Additionally, with the present application the applicant provided efficacy data from a single controlled 
clinical  trial  (IM101023).  The  aim  was  to  assess  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  abatacept  in  combination 
with  methotrexate  (ABA  +  MTX)  compared  with  placebo  and  MTX  (PLA  +  MTX)  over  the  first  12 
months  of  a  24-month  study  in  MTX-naïve  subjects  with  early,  erosive  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA), 
seropositivity  for  RA,  and  poor  prognostic  factors  for  disease  progression  in  support  of  the  proposed 
indication.  With regard to this study, the CHMP made the following observations: 
A  concern  related  to  the  choice  of  the  control  treatment  was  raised  by  the  CHMP,  namely  whether  it 
was optimal to choose MTX monotherapy over combination treatment (MTX + sulfasalazine + others) 
as the control population may be undertreated. The results of available comparative trials provided by 
the  MAH  support  the  use  of  a  combination  of  DMARDs  as  the  comparator.  However,  given  the 
precedent of other studies using biologic compounds in early RA, the various design and interpretability 
issues of the different DMARD studies, and concerns around the global acceptability of a combination 
regimen,  it  was  considered  acceptable  to  have  MTX  monotherapy  as  the  comparator  arm,  since  it  is 
widely  accepted  as  the  standard  of  care  for  the  treatment  of  RA,  and  its  optimal  use  is  well  defined 
with regard to dosage. The differences, furthermore, between abatacept (abatacept + MTX) and active 
control (MTX + placebo) were robust, making it unlikely that an active control using combined therapy 
would have resulted in no difference. However, using this type of control in IM101023 was considered 
to argue against the use of abatacept as first-line (mono) therapy. 
The  baseline  demographic,  clinical  and  other  characteristics  appear  to  be  well  balanced  between  the 
study  groups  implying  successful  randomisation.  The  study  design,  inclusion  criteria,  selected  end 
points  and  the  undertaken  analysis  are  in  general  considered  relevant  for  the  intended  aim  of  the 
study,  and  comply  with  guidance  and  are  comparable  to  pivotal  studies  for  other  biologic  therapy 
approved  for  the  first  line  indication  and  appear  even  more  stringent  for  abatacept  on  the  criteria 
intended  to  identify  a  population  with  early  progressive  disease  (with  the  exception  that  disease 
duration  in  the  etanercept  study,  which  was  much  longer  than  all  other  studies).  In  addition,  the 
abatacept study involved a patient population with severe disease. Only 11.4% of subjects had DAS28 
of ≤ 5.1 at study entry. The majority of subjects (88.4%) entered the study with severe disease, with 
DAS28 >5.1. The mean (SD) DAS28 (CRP) was 6.3 (1.0) for the entire study population. However, the 
baseline radiographic scores of this study  were not  compared to similar studies with other biologicals 
due to differences in radiographic scoring systems used across the studies. 
The  CHMP  noted  that  the  term  “early  erosive  rheumatoid  arthritis”  is  poorly  defined  in  literature  and 
that  no  official  consensus  of  the  criteria  exits.  To  define  an  “early”  population  and  to  determine  the 
inclusion  criteria,  the  MAH  has  referred  to  other  approved  biological  drugs  with  studies  in  the  “early” 
EMA/361627/2010  
Page 12/26
 
 
 
 
 
population.  In  a  comparison  of  the  inclusion  criteria  for  studies  in  comparable  RA  populations  across 
different biologic therapies the MAH showed that the study IM101023, has similar and even the most 
stringent  inclusion  criteria  for  “early  erosive  rheumatoid  arthritis”  for  the  duration  of  RA,  and 
requirements for factors predictive of severe progressive disease such as positive RF or positive anti-
CCP, CRP and erosion on x-ray at baseline. 
As  it  was  considered  relevant  to  the  design  of  the  indication/target  population,  exploratory  post  hoc 
subgroup  analyses  based  on  the  severity  of  the  disease  (signs  and  symptoms  of  RA,  degree  of 
functional impairment and the rate radiological damage) were requested in an attempt to see whether 
the resulting effect of the combination treatment was more of a result of a certain subgroup of patients 
and  further,  whether  a  subgroup  of  patients  could  benefit  from  the  treatment  more  than  others.  The 
MAH was able to show that the results were not driven by any one subgroup of patients. The fact, that 
the  therapeutic  effect  was  seen  in  all  categories  of  disease  severity,  supported  the  robustness  of  the 
results of the study sample and the homogeneity of the study population.  
In  this  phase  three  clinical  trial  the  MAH  has  chosen  to  use  the  DAS28–CRP  as  the  first  co  primary 
efficacy  endpoint.  This  outcome  measure  is  validated,  clinically  relevant  and  can  be  considered  more 
stringent  than  ACR50  (50%  decrease  in  treatment  activity),  which  has  previously  been  used  as  the 
primary efficacy endpoint in abatacept treatments trials by the MAH.  
DAS28-CRP  remission  showed  significant  effect  at  twelve  month,  the  time  of  the  primary  efficacy 
analysis,  with  the  percent  of  subjects  achieving  remission,  as  defined  by  DAS  28-CRP  <  2.6,  being 
significantly higher in the ABA + MTX group compared with the PLA + MTX group: 41.4% vs. 23.3%, p 
< 0.001. The statistical significance in the remission rate between the 2 groups was noted as early as 
Day  57  and  continued  through  Day  365.  Initiation  of  abatacept  with  MTX  in  MTX  naive  patients  with 
early  and  severe  RA  with  prognostic  factors  predictive  of  progressive  disease  resulted  in  clinically 
meaningful  and  statistically  significant  benefits  compared  to  initiating  MTX  alone  as  assessed  by  the 
different measures of RA disease activity (DAS28CRP, ACR, HQ, SF-36) 
The second structural co primary end point showed consistent results with the first primary outcome, 
although some reservations on the size of the effect and the statistical analyses on this outcome were 
raised. It was subsequently shown that the results on this endpoint were not sensitive to the choice of 
the statistical analysis method, but that the magnitude of the effect appeared small. Evaluation of joint 
damage using the Genant modified Sharp score is well documented in many clinical studies as a robust 
tool.  Less  progress  in  structural  damage  was  found  in  the  patients  treated  with  abatacept  in 
combination with MTX than in the group initially treated with placebo + MTX. The mean change from 
baseline  in  radiographic  total  score  and  erosion  score  in  ABA+MTH  group  was  0.63  and  0.50 
respectively and in the PLA+MTX group 1.06 and 0.89. The prevention of erosions in early rheumatoid 
arthritis  is  more  important  than  the  effect  on  joint  narrowing.  Less  progression  was  seen  also  in  the 
follow  up  period.  The  progression  rate in  both  groups  was  rather  slow,  which  is  a  desired  result.  The 
importance  of  the  result  is  that  early  treatment  with  abatacept  gives  additional  benefit  in  protecting 
joint  damage  than  methotrexate  alone.  This  is  shown  in  the  higher  percentage  of  non-progressors 
(92.8%  for  erosion  score)  in  those  patients  who  were  non-progressors  both  after  the  initial  double-
blind period and after the open-label period in comparison with those patients initially treated with only 
MTX  (87.0%).  In  these  patients  with  early  active  disease  even  rather  small  differences  are  clinically 
meaningful.  Although,  abatacept  +  MTX  was  marginally  superior  to  MTX  alone  in  reducing  joint 
damage as judged by x-rays, reservations on the magnitude of the effect, still remains.  
The  across  study  comparisons  of  the  radiographic  co  primary  endpoints  are,  however,  difficult  to 
conduct  because  of  differences  in  the  methodology  and  the  inherent  inter-study-variability  in  x-ray 
evaluation.  For  these  reasons,  the  MAH  has  not  made  an  attempt  to  compare  the  individual  studies. 
Thus,  the  size  of  the  abatacept  treatment  effect  as  compared  to  other  therapies  cannot  be  fully 
EMA/361627/2010  
Page 13/26
 
 
 
 
 
estimated  on  the  basis  of  this  submission.  Long  term  data  beyond  2  years  are  outstanding. 
Unfortunately  the  one  comparative  trial  (IM101-043),  the  MAH  refers  to  (see  safety  section),  doesn’t 
contain  the  progression  rate  of  erosion  among  the  efficacy  parameters.  However,  according  to  the 
results  of  the  5-year  follow-up  of  IM101102  trial  (see  safety  section),  radiographic  progression 
remained  stable  over  the  observation  period.  On  this  background,  however,  the  first  line  indication 
appears premature. 
Controlled long term data beyond the duration of 12 months of this double blind period of this pivotal 
study  is  lacking,  but  in  the  open  label  follow  up  studies  the  effect  of  abatacept  appears  to  be 
maintained  especially  on  the  primary  efficacy  outcome  measure  of  DAS28CRP  (IM101064LT  and 
IM101023LT). 
In  the  absence  of  direct  comparative  data,  the  MAH  has  compared  the  study  design  and  results  of 
IM101023  to  pivotal  trials  of  other  biological  therapies.  Furthermore,  the  MAH  refers  to  two  new 
independent comparative meta-analyses from the literature, including new data from the Keystone et 
al (abstract), and the Cochrane reviews. The comparison of the study design  and inclusion  criteria of 
the study IM101023 to the corresponding pivotal studies of TNF alpha inhibitors shows that the studies 
are alike in their key features and results. The study IM101023 results support the conclusions of the 
meta-analysis  and  the  Cochrane  reviews,  which  conclude  that  abatacept  is  similar  with  respect  to 
clinical  efficacy  compared  to  other  tested  biologic  agents  (with  the  exception  of  anakinra  that  is 
generally regarded as less effective). While meta-analyses have their limitations, they are extensively 
used  in  the  evidence-based  medicine.  In  such  a  meta-analysis  (Singh  et  al,  2009),  31  studies 
(abatacept  n  =  7  studies;  adalimumab  n  =  8  studies;  anakinra  n  =  5  studies;  etanercept  n  =  4 
studies; infliximab n = 4 studies; rituximab n = 3 studies) were compared. According to this analysis, 
the mean efficacy (in terms of OR - reaching remission, i.e. ACR50) was similar to infliximab and lower 
than adalimumab or rituximab; the safety was similar or better than that of the others. Based on 95% 
CI, these differences, however, are not significant.  
3.2.3 Clinical safety 
The nine clinical studies contributing to the safety assessment are outlined below (see Figure 5):  
1)  Open-label,  LT  period  data  from  5  core  RA  studies  (IM101102,  IM101100,  IM101029,  IM101031, 
and IM101101)  
The  data  from  the  double-blind,  controlled,  ST  period  of  these  studies  were  previously  submitted  as 
part of the initial dossier leading to abatacept’s approval in adult RA. The key focus in this document is 
based on the LT data. The abatacept safety experience for up to 8 years across these studies allow for 
LT  safety  assessment  over  time.  Subjects  who  were  inadequate  responder to  a  prior  DMARD  therapy 
(including MTX and/or TNF-antagonist) were enrolled in these studies. 
2) LT data from 3 supportive studies (IM101043, IM101064, and IM101015) 
These studies were ongoing at the time of the initial submission and, thus, were not part of the clinical 
development  program  that  supported  the  initial  approval  of  abatacept  for  the  treatment  of  RA.  The 
data  from  the  ST  periods  of  these  studies  has  subsequently  been  submitted.  The  key  focus  in  this 
document  is  based  on  the  LT  abatacept  safety  experience  (up  to  3.67  years)  from  these  studies. 
Subjects who were inadequate responder to a prior MTX and/or TNF-antagonist therapy were enrolled 
in these studies. 
3) ST and LT data from IM101023 
This study assessed the safety of abatacept in combination with MTX vs. MTX monotherapy in subjects 
with  early  RA  (<2  years).  The  subjects  were  MTX-naïve  with  erosions  and  seropositivity  (anti-CCP2 
EMA/361627/2010  
Page 14/26
 
 
 
 
 
and/or RF).  The safety data from this study  have not previously been submitted. The data presented 
by  the  MAH  includes  results  from  both  the  ST  and  LT  periods.  Post-marketing  data  are  based  on 
abatacept experience in RA and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients. 
Figure 5 
Safety results of IM101023ST 
•  Overall  AEs:  The  overall  proportion  of  AEs  was  similar  for  both  groups  (ABA  +  MTX:  84.8%; 
PLA + MTX: 83.4%). 
•  Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
Deaths were reported in 2 subjects (0.8%) in the ABA + MTX group and 4 subjects (1.6%) in the PLA 
+  MTX  group  in  the  first  12  months  of  the  study.  In  subjects  receiving  ABA  +  MTX  the  investigator 
reported the relationship to the investigational drug as probable. Two (2) of the 4 deaths in the PLA + 
MTX group were reported to have discontinued due to an AE rather than due to death.  
Other Serious Adverse Events 
A similar proportion of SAEs was observed for the ABA + MTX group (7.8%) compared with the PLA + 
MTX  group  (7.9%).  A  small  number  of  subjects  in  each  group  had  SAEs  considered  related  to  study 
medication (ABA + MTX: 2.0%; PLA + MTX: 2.4%) or were discontinued from the study due to a SAE 
(1.2% of subjects each in the ABA + MTX and PLA + MTX groups). In the ABA + MTX group, no single 
SAE  was  reported  for  >  2  subjects,  the  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  were  in  the  infections  and 
infestations SOC (2.0% incidence in both groups). 
EMA/361627/2010

Infections and infestations were reported as SAEs in the same number of subjects in the ABA  + MTX 
and  PLA  +  MTX  groups  (5  subjects  in  each  group). There  were  more  subjects  with  pneumonia  in  the 
PLA + MTX group (1.2%) compared with the ABA + MTX group (0.4%). Gastroenteritis occurred as a 
single  case  and  was  equally  distributed  in  both  groups.  Cellulitis,  lung  infection  pseudomonal,  and 
postoperative  wound  infection  were  single  cases  in  the  ABA  +  MTX  group  while  breast  cellulitis  and 
staphylococcal infection were single cases in the PLA + MTX group. A malignant neoplasm (pancreatic 
carcinoma) was reported as an SAE in 1 (0.4%) subject in the ABA + MTX group compared with none 
in  the  PLA  +  MTX  group.  This  event  was  considered  not  likely  related  to  study  medication  and  study 
medication  was  discontinued  due  to  this  event,  which  did  not  resolve.  Neoplasms  (benign  and 
unspecified) were reported as SAEs in 2 (0.8%) subjects treated with ABA + MTX and none in the PLA 
+ MTX group.  
•  Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Study Therapy 
A similar proportion of subjects in the ABA + MTX group (91%) compared with the PLA + MTX group 
(90%)  completed  the  first  12  months  of  the  study.  A  similar  number  of  subjects  discontinued  due  to 
AEs  (ABA  +  MTX:  8  [3.1%]  subjects,  PLA  +  MTX:  11  [4.3%]  subjects).  The  categories  of  AEs  that 
most  often  led  to  discontinuation  were:  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  and  skin  and 
subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  (2  [0.8%]  subjects,  each)  in  the  ABA  +  MTX  group.  Respiratory, 
thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (5  [2.0%]  subjects)  and  gastrointestinal  disorders  (2  [0.8%] 
subjects) were the most common AEs leading to discontinuation in the PLA + MTX group.  
•  Adverse Events of Interest 
Infections 
There  was  a  similar  incidence  of  all  serious  infections/infestations  in  the  ABA  +  MTX  and  PLA  +  MTX 
groups  (5  subjects,  2.0%  in  each group).  Infections/infestations  were  reported  by  51.6%  of  subjects 
treated with ABA + MTX compared with 54.9% of subjects treated with PLA + MTX. The most common 
infections  in  both  groups  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (ABA  +  MTX:  10.2%;  PLA  +  MTX: 
10.3%) and nasopharyngitis (ABA + MTX: 8.2%; PLA + MTX: 10.3%). Almost all of the infections were 
mild (ABA + MTX group: 29.7%; PLA + MTX group: 26.5%) or moderate (ABA + MTX group: 20.3%; 
PLA  +  MTX  group:  26.1%).  Severe  infections  were  reported  by  4  (1.6%)  subjects  in  the  ABA  +  MTX 
group  and  5  (2.0%)  subjects  in  the  PLA  +  MTX  group.  Very  severe  infections  were  reported  by  no 
subjects in the ABA + MTX group and 1 (0.4%) in the PLA + MTX group. There were no opportunistic 
infections,  like  TB  or  fungal  infections,  protozoal  infections,  or  atypical  presentations  of  infections 
reported  in  any  subject  receiving  abatacept.  However,  there  was  a  single  case  of  pseudomonas 
pneumonia with ABA + MTX treatment in this study. There were no subjects in the ABA + MTX group 
that discontinued due to infections/infestations during the first 12 months of the study compared with 
1 (0.4%) subject (preferred term: pneumonia) in the PLA + MTX group.  
Neoplasms: Benign, Malignant, and Unspecified 
There  was  1  (0.4%)  malignant  neoplasm  (pancreatic  carcinoma)  reported  in  the  first  12  months  of 
treatment  with  ABA  +  MTX  and  none  reported  for  PLA  +  MTX.  In  addition,  benign  and  unspecified 
neoplasms  were  reported  in  10  subjects:  6  (2.3%)  subjects  in  the  ABA  +  MTX  group  and  4  (1.6%) 
subjects  in  the  PLA  +  MTX  group  in  the  first  12  months  of  treatment.  Skin  papilloma  was  most 
frequently reported in the ABA + MTX group (2 subjects) with no occurrences in the PLA + MTX group. 
Autoimmune Disorders (Pre-specified) 
Autoimmune  related  disorders  (pre-specified)  were  reported  with  similar  frequency  (ABA  +  MTX: 
2.3%;  and  PLA  +  MTX:  2.0%).  The  most  frequent  were  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue 
EMA/361627/2010

disorders (preferred terms: Sjorgen’s Syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]) occurring in 
both groups (1 event [0.4%], in each group). The 2 events of Sjorgen’s Syndrome were considered to 
be mild intensity and unrelated to study medication; subjects were treated and no further action was 
taken.  
Infusional Adverse Events (Pre-specified) 
Acute  Infusional  AEs:  The  overall  frequency  of  acute  infusional  AEs  (pre-specified)  was  higher  in  the 
ABA  +  MTX  group  (6.3%)  compared  with  the  PLA  +  MTX  group  (2.0%).  Nervous  system  disorders 
were reported in 6 (2.3%) subjects in the ABA + MTX group compared with 3 (1.2%) subjects in the 
PLA + MTX group. Specifically, dizziness was reported in a greater proportion of subjects in the ABA + 
MTX group (2.0%) compared with the PLA + MTX group (0.8%). Headache was reported with similar 
frequency (0.4%, in each  group) in both treatment groups. General disorders and administration site 
conditions  were  reported  in  5  (2.0%)  subjects  in  the  ABA  +  MTX  group  and  none  of  the  PLA  +  MTX 
group. The majority of acute infusional AEs (pre-specified) were of mild to moderate severity. A total 
of 1 (0.4%) subject in the ABA + MTX group compared with none in the PLA + MTX group experienced 
acute  infusional  AEs  (pre-specified)  considered  by  the  investigators  to  be  severe  ([preferred  terms] 
urticaria).  
Peri-infusional AEs: The overall frequency of pre-specified peri-infusional AEs was higher in the ABA + 
MTX group (12.5%) compared with the PLA + MTX group (9.9%). The majority of peri-infusional AEs 
(pre-specified) were of mild to moderate severity. A total of 2 (0.8%) subjects in the ABA + MTX group 
compared  with  none  in  the  PLA  +  MTX  group  experienced  severe  peri-infusional  AEs  (pre-specified) 
([preferred terms] urticaria and headache, respectively).  
• 
Laboratory findings 
Blood and urine samples for haematology, serum chemistries, and urinalysis were collected during the 
study.  In  addition,  pregnancy  tests  were  performed.  No  safety  issues  concerning  laboratory  testing 
were identified.   
• 
Immunological events 
Blood samples for immunogenicity assessments were obtained just prior to the start of the IV infusion 
of study medication at the following times during the first 12 months of the study: baseline (Day 1), 
Month  6,  Month  12,  and  again  28,  56,  and  85  days  after  the  last  infusion  for  subjects  who  withdrew 
from the study prematurely during the study drug treatment period.  
Serum  samples  (n  =  795  and  n  =  798)  from  ABA  +  MTX-treated,  MTX-naïve,  early,  erosive  RA 
subjects were analyzed by ELISA to detect antibodies against the whole molecule (i.e., both the CTLA4 
and  Ig  portion  [anti-abatacept  antibody])  or  solely  to  the  CTLA4  portion  (anti-CTLA4-T  antibody).  A 
total  of  4  of  249  subjects  (1.6%)  demonstrated  anti-abatacept  antibodies;  3  of  the  4  subjects  were 
positive for the anti-abatacept antibody response (IgG specificity) and 1 of the 4 subjects was positive 
only for the anti-CTLA4-T antibody response (CTLA4-specificity). Of the 3 subjects with anti-abatacept 
antibodies,  2  subjects  demonstrated  anti-abatacept  antibodies  at  both  Month  6  and  12;  1  subject 
demonstrated  anti-abatacept  antibodies  only  at  Month  12.  Seropositivity  for  the  subject  with  anti-
CTLA4-T antibodies was demonstrated at 2 follow-up visits (Days 56 and 85 post last dose) and these 
2 samples had neutralizing antibody activity. Of the 13 subjects that discontinued from the study and 
were  analyzed  for  the  presence  of  anti-abatacept  and  anti-CTLA4-T  antibodies,  no  subjects  were 
positive  for  the  anti-abatacept  antibody  response  and  1  (7.7%)  subject  was  positive  for  the  anti-
CTLA4-T antibody response.  
A  relationship  between  immunogenicity  and  safety  or  efficacy  was  not  apparent  in  subjects  who 
developed  a  positive  immune  response  to  abatacept  or  CTLA4-T.  The  frequency  and  type  of  pre-

specified infusional AEs, overall AEs (serious and non-serious), and discontinuations were examined in 
subjects  who  developed  an  antibody  response  as  well  as  for  the  subject  who  had  neutralizing 
antibodies.  The  effect  of  immunogenicity  on  efficacy  was  also  examined  by  evaluating  DAS-28  CRP 
response,  ACR  responses,  and  HAQ  responses  in  subjects  with  a  positive  antibody  response. 
Interpretation of these data is limited due to the small number of immunopositive subjects. 
•  Rheumatoid Factor and Anti-CCP2 
Serum samples were collected to measure RF and anti-CCP2 levels at screening and Month 6 and 12. 
All  subjects  randomized  in  this  study  had  to  have  at  least  1  of  the  2  serologic  tests  positive.  The 
number of subjects who seroconverted (were positive at baseline and negative at Days 169 and 365, 
or vice versa) was examined. More subjects treated with ABA + MTX (17.0% and 18.5%, respectively) 
had  a  positive  to  negative  seroconversion  of  RF  from  baseline  to  Days  169  and  365  compared  with 
subjects  treated  with  PLA  +  MTX  (9.5%  and  14.6%,  respectively).  A  greater  proportion  of  subjects 
treated with PLA + MTX (14.3% and 16.7%, respectively) had a negative to positive seroconversion of 
RF from baseline to Days 169 and 365 compared with no subjects in the ABA + MTX group. 
For anti-CCP2, more subjects treated with ABA + MTX (6.6% and 7.1%, respectively) had a positive to 
negative seroconversion from baseline to Days 169 and 365 compared with subjects treated with PLA 
+ MTX (2.9% and 4.5%, respectively). A greater proportion of subjects treated with PLA + MTX (6.1% 
and 13.8%, respectively) had a negative to positive seroconversion of anti-CCP2 from baseline to Days 
169 and 365 compared with no subjects in the ABA + MTX group. Treatment with ABA + MTX resulted 
in  a  greater  reduction  from  baseline  in  anti-CCP2  measures  compared  with  PLA  +  MTX.  Reductions 
from  baseline  were  seen  by  Month  6  and  continued  to  be  observed  at  Month  12.  RF  levels  were 
reduced to a greater degree in the PLA + MTX group compared with the ABA + MTX group at Days 169 
and 365. 
Other Safety Studies  
In  addition  to  the  safety  data  from  the  short  term  period  of  study  IM101023  presented  above,  data 
from long term follow up from the following studies were submitted. 
• 
IM101023LT  (ad  2-year  follow  up)  Two  year  follow  up  of  the  Phase  3,  multi-centre, 
randomized, double-blind study to evaluate remission and joint damage progression 
in  methotrexate-naïve  early,  erosive  rheumatoid  arthritis  subjects  with  abatacept 
plus methotrexate compared with methotrexate 
This addendum reports the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity results for subjects who continued in 
the  open-label  period  of  the  study  (Year  2).  This  includes  subjects  in  the  original  abatacept  in 
combination with MTX group (ABA  + MTX)  who continued this treatment for an additional 12 months 
and subjects in the original placebo in combination with MTX group (PLA + MTX) who added abatacept 
in place of placebo for the open-label period (12 months). 
The  primary  objective  of  the  open-label  period  was  to  assess  the  long-term  safety  and  tolerability  of 
abatacept in subjects with early, erosive RA, including evaluation of immunogenicity.  
Given  the  uncontrolled,  open-label  nature  of  this  study,  there  are  inherent  limitations  to  interpreting 
the  results,  however,  the  high  retention  of  subjects  in  the  open-label  period  of  this  study  allows 
greater confidence in the robustness of the results. 
Abatacept  treatment  at  a  weight-tiered  dose  of  10  mg/kg  (IV)  administered  every  28  days  in 
combination    with  MTX  for  an  additional  12  months  in  the  open-label  period  after  the  12-month 
double-blind  period  was  generally  well  tolerated  in  subjects  with  early  (≤  2  years),  erosive, 
seropositive RA, and similar to the first 12-month controlled period.

With regard to efficacy information on this trial the CHMP noted that:  
Improvements in signs and symptoms (as assessed by DAS 28 and ACR responses) and health related 
outcomes  (as  assessed  by  SF-36,  reduction  of  fatigue  [VAS],  and  activity  limitation),  observed  with 
abatacept  treatment  in  combination  with  MTX  at  the  end  of  Month  12  was  maintained  at  the  end  of 
open-label period (Month 24) in the original abatacept in combination with MTX group; improvements 
were observed for the original placebo in combination with MTX group when treatment with abatacept 
in place of placebo was initiated during the open-label period. ACR responses were assessed at 2 years 
in 232 patients with 85% ACR 20 responses, 74% ACR 50 responses, and 54% ACR 70 responses. 
Radiographic  assessment  indicated  joint  protection  following  24  months  of  abatacept  treatment  in 
combination with MTX with less progression of structural damage at Month 24 relative to treatment for 
only 12 months. Early treatment with the combination of abatacept and MTX gave an additional benefit 
in  protecting  joint  damage  over  starting  with  the  standard  of  care  of  MTX  only.  Among  the  patients 
who  entered  the  open-label  12 month  period,  59%  (125/213)  of  patients  receiving  continuous 
abatacept  plus  methotrexate  treatment  and  48%  (92/192)  of  patients  who  initially  received 
methotrexate and switched to combination with abatacept had no progression. 
No  new  or  unusual  AEs  emerged  during  abatacept  treatment  in  the  open-label  follow  up  periods. 
Evaluation  of  laboratory  data  revealed  no  clinically  significant  trends  or  safety  concerns.  The  overall 
incidence  rates  for  SAEs,  Infections  and  Infestations  SOC  SAEs,  Infections  and  Infestations  SOC  AEs, 
malignant neoplasms, and autoimmune disorders did not increase during the open-label period relative 
to the double-blind period. 
•  Long term follow up IM101102LT A Phase 3, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  abatacept  in 
combination therapy with methotrexate (MTX) vs. MTX alone in subjects with active 
rheumatoid arthritis and inadequate response to MTX. Clinical phase 3 
The  primary  objective  of  the  open-label  period  was  to  assess  the  safety  and  long-term  tolerability  of 
abatacept in subjects who completed the 12-month, double-blind treatment period. 
Abatacept at a weight-tiered dose of 10 mg/kg  (IV) administered monthly for up to 6 years (up to 5 
years  in  open-label  period  after  1-year  double-blind  period)  was  generally  well  tolerated  in  subjects 
with RA. 
With regard to efficacy information on this trial the CHMP noted that:  
Abatacept was effective in improving the signs and symptoms of RA, physical function, and quality of 
life,  and  these  improvements  were  maintained  during  the  open-label  period.  ACR  responses  were 
assessed  at  5 years  in  270 patients  with  84%  ACR  20  responses,  61%  ACR  50  responses,  and  40% 
ACR 70 responses.  
When Erosion, JSN, and Total scores were analyzed by mean change in score from the previous annual 
visit, there was less progression of structural damage in subjects treated with abatacept for the entire 
open-label  treatment  period  relative  to  subjects  initially  treated  with  placebo  for  1  year  and  then 
treated with abatacept. By Year 5, the structural damage progression of the original placebo group, as 
measured by the annual change in Total score from the previous year, was similar to that observed in 
the original abatacept group. Data were analyzed using mean change in total score from the previous 
annual visit. The mean change was, 0.41 and 0.74 from year 1 to year 2 (n=290, 130), 0.37 and 0.68 
from  year  2  to  year  3  (n=293,  130),  0.34  and  0.43  year  from  3  to  year  4  (n=290,  128)  and  the 
change  was  0.26  and  0.29  (n=233,  114)  from  year  4  to  year  5  for  patients  originally  randomized  to 
abatacept + MTX and placebo + MTX respectively.

No  new  safety  concerns  evolved  in  the  5  years  follow  up  period  and  during  this  period  the  monthly 
abatacept dose was generally well tolerated by patients with RA. No new or unexpected AEs emerged 
during  abatacept  treatment  in  the  open-label  period.  Evaluation  of  laboratory  data  revealed  no 
clinically  significant  trends  or  safety  concerns.  The  overall  incidence  rates  for  SAEs,  Infections  and 
Infestations  SOC  SAEs,  Infections  and  Infestations  SOC  AEs,  malignant  neoplasms,  and  autoimmune

receiving methotrexate Clinical phase 2B 
The  primary  objective  of  the  long-term  extension  phase  was  to  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of 
abatacept combined with methotrexate (MTX) during long-term administration in subjects with active 
RA. 
Abatacept at a weight-tiered dose of 10 mg/kg (IV) administered monthly over 7 years including the 
double-blind  period  was  generally  safe  and  well  tolerated  in  subjects  with  RA.  ACR  responses  were 
assessed at 7 years in 43 patients with 72% ACR 20 responses, 58% ACR 50 responses, and 44% ACR

Combination  with  Methotrexate  in  Controlling  Disease  Activity  in  Subjects  with 
Rheumatoid  Arthritis  Having  an  Inadequate  Clinical  Response  to  Methotrexate 
Clinical phase 3 
The  primary  objective  of  the  long-term  extension  phase  was  to  assess  the  safety  and  long-term 
tolerability  of  abatacept  in  subjects  who  had  completed  the  initial  12-month  double-blind  treatment 
period. 
 Long-term  treatment  with  abatacept  for  up  to  44  months  (open-label  and  double-blind  periods)  was 
generally safe and well tolerated in subjects with RA initially showing an inadequate response to MTX. 
No safety concerns were identified in the open-label period. The improvements in signs and symptoms 
of RA, physical function, and quality of life observed in subjects receiving double-blind abatacept were 
maintained  over the  1  year  of  continued  abatacept treatment  in  the  open-label  period.  There  was  no 
evidence  of  a  greater  risk  in  terms  of  infections,  infusional  events,  or  SAEs  associated  with 
transitioning  subjects  directly  from  infliximab  to  abatacept,  and  efficacy  was  increased  after  subjects 
were switched from infliximab to abatacept. 
This  open  label  period  of  the  study  provided  an  assessment  of  the  ability  of  abatacept  to  maintain 
efficacy  for  subjects  originally  randomized  to  abatacept  and  the  efficacy  response  of  those  subjects 
who  were  switched  to  abatacept  following  treatment  with  infliximab.  The  reduction  from  baseline  in 
mean DAS28 score at day 365 (-3.06) was maintained through day 729 (-3.34) in those patients who 
continued  with  abatacept.  In  those  patients  who  initially  received  infliximab  and  then  switched  to 
abatacept, the reduction in the mean DAS28 score from baseline was 3.29 at day 729 and 2.48 at day 
365.

Safety  of  Abatacept  vs.  Placebo  in  Subjects  with  Active  Rheumatoid  Arthritis  on 
Background DMARDs who have Failed Anti-TNF Therapy.  
The  primary  objective  of  the  open-label  period  is  to  assess  the  long-term  safety  and  tolerability  of 
abatacept combined with non-biologic background DMARDs in subjects with active RA. 
Long  term  treatment  with  abatacept  at  a  weight-tiered  dose  of  10  mg/kg  (IV)  administered  monthly 
for  up  to  5  years  after  the  6-month  double-blind  period  was  generally  safe  and  well  tolerated  in 
subjects  with  RA.  Abatacept  was  effective  in  improving  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  RA,  physical 
function,  and  quality  of  life  during  the  double-blind  period.  These  improvements  were  maintained 
during the open-label period. ACR responses were assessed at 5 years in 91 patients with 74% ACR 20 
responses, 51% ACR 50 responses, and 23% ACR 70 responses. 
•  Long term follow- up IM101031LT A Phase 3, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled  clinical  use  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of 
abatacept  administered  intravenously  to  subjects  with  active  rheumatoid  arthritis 
(RA),  with  or  without  medical  co-morbidities,  receiving  disease  modifying 
antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and/or biologics approved for RA (open-label period 
up to 31-Oct-2008) Clinical phase 3 
The  primary  objective  of  the  open-label  period  was  to  assess  the  long-term  safety  and  tolerability  of 
abatacept  in  combination  with  approved background  biologic  and/or  non-biologic  DMARDs  in  subjects 
with RA who had completed the 12-month double-blind treatment period. 
Abatacept, on the current recommended dose, administered monthly for 4 or more years after a 1 year 
period  of  double-blind  therapy,  had  acceptable  tolerance  in  a  population  of  subjects  with  RA,  with  or 
without  medical  co-morbidities,  who  were  receiving  concomitant  non-biologic  disease-modifying  RA 
therapies.  However,  concomitant  therapy  with  abatacept  and  marketed  biologic  anti-rheumatic  drugs 
was associated with an increase in adverse events, particularly infections.  
•  Open-label Period of Study IM101101 A Phase IIb, Multicenter, Randomized, Double 
Blind,  Placebo-Controlled  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Safety  and  Clinical  Efficacy  of 
Intravenous  Infusions  of  Abatacept  (BMS  188667,  2  mg/kg)  Given  Monthly  in 
Combination  with  Subcutaneous  Injections  of  Etanercept  (25  mg)  Given  Twice 
Weekly to Subjects with Active Rheumatoid Arthritis (Open-label Period)  
Assessment of the safety and tolerability of abatacept during long-term administration in subjects with 
active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Open-label  abatacept  administered  monthly  for  up  to  58  months  after  12  months  of  treatment  (at  2 
mg/kg dose) in the double-blind phase was generally safe and well tolerated in subjects with active RA. 
The  overall  safety  profile  for  abatacept  during  the  open-label  period  was  not  different  from  that 
observed during the double-blind period. However, analysis of integrated safety data from other clinical 
studies  involving  abatacept  indicated  an  increased  number  of  SAEs  and  AEs,  including  infections,  in 
subjects  when  using  concomitant  biologics,  and  for this  reason,  background  biologic  therapies  for  RA 
(including  etanercept)  were  no  longer  permitted  after  Jun-2005.  A  low  incidence  of  seropositivity  for 
anti-abatacept antibodies was observed. The presence of antibodies to abatacept did not correlate with 
any clinical findings.

•  Post marketing experience 
The data provided on post marketing indicates that the safety profile of abatacept remains favourable 
in  the  currently  licensed  indication,  is  generally  consistent  with  the  safety  profile  observed  in  the 
clinical studies, and new or unexpected safety signals have emerged. 
Discussion on Clinical Safety 
The  extensive  risk  management  program  for  abatacept  links  several  registries,  post  marketing  and 
clinical  trial  experience.  The  majority  of  these  patients  were  enrolled  to  these  clinical  trials  after  an 
insufficient  response  to  one  or  more  non  biologic  DMARDs  including  MTX.  During  the  cumulative 
period, 1280 patients had an inadequate response to MTX, 1419 patients having previously failed one 
or more anti- TNF agents, and 483 patients were MTX-naive.  
Since  its  initial  approval  in  the  EU  with  the  abatacept  indication  limited  to  the  anti-TNF  failure 
population  (third  line  indication),  additional  safety  data  have  been  collected  from  the  long  term 
extensions  of  the  clinical  trials,  the  established  RA  registries,  and  the  standard  post-marketing 
surveillance, totalling an exposure of approximately 73,882 patient-years (p-y) of exposure (11,657 p-
y  cumulative  trial,  ~  2000  p-y  from  post-marketing  epidemiology  studies,  and  ~60,225  p-y  post 
marketing  pharmacovigilance).  These  safety  data  are  not  limited  to  the  third  line  indication  as 
abatacept  is  marketed  in  the  United  States  and  other  countries  with  an  indication  for  use  in  MTX-
inadequate responders, as well as in MTX-naive patients (over 10000 patients in total). In total 4632 
subjects  have  been  exposed  to  abatacept  in  the  context  of  clinical  trials,  mostly  on  the  fixed  weight 
tiered  dose  of  10 mg/kg  across  the  current  and  the  newly  proposed  indications,  representing  12375 
patient-years of cumulative short and long term exposure. In this population, the number of subjects 
exposed  for  at  least  5  years  exceeds  a  thousand.  These  numbers  are  sufficient  to  meet  ICH 
recommendations, for all indications. 
Overall,  abatacept  is  well  tolerated  by  most  patients.  No  new,  unexpected  adverse  events  were 
detected in the long term follow up studies, the sole randomised controlled trial or in post marketing 
experience.  Compared  to  the  original  application  identified  and  potential  risks  have  also  been  better 
characterised  over  time.  The  frequency  of  overall  adverse  events  and  serious  adverse  event  were 
comparable  over  time.  Considering  the  mode  of  action  of  abatacept,  there  are  several  potential  risks 
associated  with  immunosuppression  including  infections,  autoimmunity  and  malignancies.  Infections 
remained  the  primary  identified  risk  associated  with  the  use  of  abatacept  also  during  the  long  term. 
The  incidence  rate  of  infections  did  not,  however,  increase  over  time  and  serious  and  opportunistic 
infections  were  rare.  Data  on  the  long  term  use  of  abatacept  did  not  suggest  that  the  risk  of 
malignancies as specifically increased and the rates remained stable over time.  
According  to  current  safety  database,  the  safety  profile  of  abatacept  seems  to  be  better  than  that  of 
the TNF-inhibitors and rituximab. This is due to the lower occurrence of serious or other infections. T 
cell  immunosuppression  is  known  to  increase  the  frequency  of  certain  neoplams  (e.g.  skin  and 
lymphoid  system  neoplasms),  and  this  possibility  cannot  be  excluded  for  abatacept  although  there  is 
no  signal  in  the  current  safety  data  base.  According  to  the  present  data,  a  risk  of  PML  has  not  been 
demonstrated. No de novo cases of PML have been detected. The current RMP is considered adequate 
for the detection of rare events and events with latency provided that the exposure and recruitment to 
the pharmacoepidemiological programme is adequate.  
It  is  unfortunate,  that  data  from  the  epidemiology/  registry  studies  in  the  RMP  are  not  yet  able  to 
provide  more  definite  answers  to  the  different  safety  concerns.  The  full  planned  analysis  of  the 
pharmacoepidemiological  data  across  the  registries is  not  expected  to  start  before  2011.  The  current 
extracted data is interim in nature and mainly from unadjusted analysis. As outlined in the RMP, once 
EMA/361627/2010

there are 5000 p-y across all studies, these analyses will be performed, but these data will be available 
at  the  earliest  2011.  Currently  the  exposure  is  approximately  2000  p-y  of  follow-up.  Keeping  these 
limitations  in  mind,  when  comparing  key  events  between  abatacept  and  control  groups,  the  results 
appear reassuring. The current data do not raise signals of unexpected adverse reactions. 
The clinical evidence of an increased risk of organ specific autoimmune diseases (including diabetes or 
autoimmune  thyroiditis)  with  abatacept  is  scarce.  No  new  safety  findings  that  would  raise  concerns 
were  evident  in  the  long  term  follow  up.  As  incidence  of  these  diseases  is  very  low,  in  spite  of  an 
increased  background  rate  in  RA  patients,  risk  estimations  are  difficult  to  perform  between  therapies 
for  which  no  clear  increase  in  incidence  rates  have  been  declared.  Post  marketing  surveillance  has 
associated  TNF-inhibitors  with  certain  specific  autoimmune  diseases  (such  as  autoimmune  hepatitis 
type  1,  aplastic  anemia,  vasculitis  and  exacerbation  of  SLE  or  a  demyelinating  disorder).  The  current 
case reports with abatacept do not suggest such causality to abatacept. For the time being, the data 
on  autoimmunity  from  the  pharmacoepidemiological  programme  are  preliminary,  fully  analysed  data 
will only be available in 2011.  
Against  this  background,  the  RMP  for  abatacept  has  a  paramount  role  as  the  monitoring  of 
autoimmune events remains also an important part of the ongoing safety monitoring of abatacept. The 
risk  management  system  is  extensive,  but  assessment  of  autoimmunity  remains  challenging.  To 
improve  the  evaluation  of  immunogenicity  and  its  significance  for  possible  autoimmune  events,  the 
MAH  has  agreed  to  follow-up  the  antibody  response  up  to  six  months  after  cessation  therapy. 
Immunogenicity  will  also  be  addressed  upon  detection  of  an  autoimmune  event.  This  is  proposed  (in 
addition  to  the  JIA  programme)  for  the  adult  SC  programme,  but  should  also  be  employed  for  other 
part  of  the  adult  development  programme  of  abatacept.  However,  the  utility  of  the  paediatric 
biomarkers for thyroiditis and diabetes (anti-GAD and anti-TPO) in the different adult populations, with 
no definite signal, is not seen as relevant. The use of other biomarkers is considered questionable. The 
current  RMP  is  adequate  for  the  detection  of  rare  events  provided  that  the  abatacept  exposure  and 
recruitment to the pharmacoepidemiological programme are adequate.  
The  methods  used  for  the  determination  of  the  immunogenicity  in  these  studies  have  been  validated 
and  the  validation  reports  have  previously  been  assessed  by  the  CHMP  and  they  are  considered 
acceptable.  In  general,  low  immunogenicity  was  seen  across  all  of  the  clinical  studies.  There  was 
detectable  variation  between  the  different  studies  in  the  numbers  of  positive  individuals,  with  the 
values  shifting  from  2%  to  20%.  To  date,  no  associations  of  abatacept  antibodies  with  infusion 
reactions,  adverse  events,  decreased  efficacy,  or  changes  in  drug  concentration  have  been  detected. 
The  duration  of  the  follow  up  is  important  also  for  autoimmune  disorders  as  they  are  known  to 
manifest  clinically  several  years  after  the  initial  immunological  insult.  In  order  to  cope  with  this 
problem, the MAH proposes to monitor abatacept antibodies in the SC programme.

The currently approved RMP (version 8.0) addresses identified and potential risks in  MTX IR and TNF 
IR  patient  populations.  The  clinical  experience  to  date  in  MTX  naive  patients  did  not  reveal  any 
information  or  safety  issues  that  would  require  changes  to  the  identified  and  potential  risks  in  the 
existing RMP. Therefore, the routine and enhanced pharmacovigilance measures that are established in 
the earlier RMP versions remain sufficient.  
There  is  no  need  for  revision  to  the  RMP  at  this  time  based  on  the  proposed  extension  of  the 
therapeutic indication, but the MAH is required to update the RMP with the new exposure data at the 
time of the next RMP update. The MAH is required to include the following additional data/information 
EMA/361627/2010  
Page 23/26
 
 
 
 
 
to  the  RMP  at  the  time  of  the  next  RMP  update:  Safety  Specifications  and  Clinical  exposure  to  be 
updated with the data pertaining to this variation application (see Attachment 6 - LoU).  
3.4 Benefit Risk Assessment 
Benefits 
The  treatment  paradigm  of  RA  is  changing  towards  more  aggressive  early  intervention  in  order  to 
quench  the  inflammation  that  may  lead  to  irreversible  joint  damage  and  impaired  function.  Even  in 
aggressive,  erosive  RA,  it  is  possible  to  obtain  a  remission,  not  only  relieve  signs  and  symptoms. 
Results of the combination therapies, either with traditional DMARDs or with MTX + biologicals, such as 
abatacept,  are  significantly  better  than  mono  therapy  with  traditional  DMARDs,  including  MTX.  Study 
IM101023 demonstrated that abatacept + MTX provides a clinically significant benefit to patients with 
early RA in terms of disease activity, progression of the disease, physical function and quality of life as 
compared  to  placebo  +  MTX.  These  results  are  in  line  with  previous  studies  in  advanced  RA.  The 
clinical  benefit  of  abatacept  appears  to  be  of  a  similar  magnitude  as  that  provided  by  etanercept, 
infliximab  and  adalimumab.  Data  on  the  long  term  benefits  of  biologicals  are  scarce  and  difficult  to 
evaluate.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The  size  of  the  radiological  abatacept  treatment  effect,  as  measured  by  a  validated  clinical  score, 
appeared, however, modest, although the statistical analysis on this outcome was not sensitive to the 
choice of the analyses method. Across-study comparisons are difficult in this area. 
Risks 
The  tolerability  of  the  combinations  that  include  a  biological  medicinal  product  has  been  relatively 
good. The safety profile of the combinations with infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept is well known. 
The  most  significant  serious  adverse  effects  are  related  to  immunosuppression/host  defence  and 
include  opportunistic  infections,  lymphomas  and  various  autoimmune  disorders.  The  concerns  on  the 
long term safety of abatacept, such as risk of malignancies and autoimmune disorders, are more based 
on the novelty of the mode of action of abatacept and isolated clinical findings than on real reports of 
adverse  effects  in  patients.  Infections  remain  the  primary  identified  risk  associated  with  the  use  of 
abatacept  also  during  the long  term.  The  incidence  rate  of  infections  did  not, however,  increase  over 
time and serious and opportunistic infections were rare. Data on the long term use of abatacept did not 
suggest that the risk of malignancies as specifically increased and the rates remained stable over time. 
Thus,  abatacept  may  offer  a  relative  safety  benefit  to  patients  who  are  susceptible  for  infections  as 
compared 
to  TNF-inhibitors.  Confirmation  on 
this  point  may  come 
from 
the  ongoing 
pharmacoepidemiological studies. 
Because  of  these  concerns,  a  robust  risk  management  program  was  established  for  abatacept  at  the 
time of licensing. This extensive risk management program for abatacept links several registries, post 
marketing  and  clinical  trial  experience.  The  majority  of  these  patients  were  enrolled  after  an 
insufficient  response  to  one  or  more  non  biologic  DMARDs  including  MTX.  During  the  cumulative 
period, 1280 patients had an inadequate response to MTX, 1419 patients having previously failed one 
or  more  anti-  TNF  agents,  and  483  patients  were  MTX-naive.  Since  its  initial  approval  in  the  EU  with 
the  abatacept  indication  limited  to  the  anti-TNF  failure  population  (third  line  indication),  additional 
safety data has been collected from the long term extensions of the clinical trials, the established RA 
registries, and the post-marketing experience, totalling an exposure of approximately 73,882 patient-
years  (p-y)  of  exposure  (11,657  p-y  cumulative  trial,  ~  2000  p-y  from  post-marketing  epidemiology 
studies, and ~60,225 p-y post marketing pharmacovigilance). These safety data are not limited to the 
third  line  indication  as  abatacept  is  marketed  in  the  United  States  and  other  countries  with  an 
EMA/361627/2010  
Page 24/26
 
 
 
 
 
 
indication for use in MTX-inadequate responders, as well as in MTX-naive patients (over 10000 patients 
in total).  
Overall,  abatacept is  well tolerated  by  most  patients.  No  new,  unexpected  adverse  events  have  been 
detected  in  the  long  term  follow  up  studies,  the  sole  new  randomised  controlled  trial  or  in  post 
marketing experience. Compared to the original application, the identified and potential risks have also 
been  better  characterised  over  time.  The  frequency  of  overall  adverse  events  and  serious  adverse 
event did not increase over time.  
Unfavourable effects 
Infections remain the primary identified risk associated with the use of abatacept also during the long 
term.  The  other  concerns  on  the  long  term  safety  of  abatacept,  such  as  risk  of  malignancies  and 
autoimmune disorders, are based on isolated clinical findings and novelty of the mechanism of action.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Abatacept  has  a  comprehensive  risk  management  plan  that  consists  of  extensions  of  clinical  trials, 
pharmacoepidemiological  study  based  of  several  RA  registers  as  well  as  immunological  studies  and 
standard  post-marketing  safety  surveillance.  It  is  unfortunate,  that  data  from  the  epidemiology/ 
registry  studies  in  the  RMP  are  not  yet  able  to  provide  more  definite  answers  to  the  different  safety 
concerns  in  early  RA.  The  full  planned  analysis  of  the  pharmacoepidemiological  data  across  the 
registries  is  not  expected  to  start  before  2011.  The  current  extracted  data  are  interim  in  nature  and 
mainly  from  unadjusted  analysis.  As  outlined  in  the  RMP,  once  there  are  5000  p-y  across  all  studies, 
these  analyses  will  be  performed,  but  these  data  will  available  at  the  earliest  2011.  Currently  the 
exposure is approximately 2000 p-y of  follow-up. Keeping these limitations in mind,  when comparing 
key events between abatacept and control groups, the results appear reassuring. The current data do 
not raise any new safety signals. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Clinically significant benefits of abatacept have been demonstrated both in early and advanced RA. As 
discussed above, the mode of action of abatacept raises some potential risks. Against this background, 
the  RMP  has  a  paramount  role  in  the  ongoing  safety  monitoring  of  abatacept.  The  risk  management 
system is extensive and on the basis of the current know safety data, with no clear new safety signals, 
it is considered adequate (with an update on post treatment follow-up of immunogenicity), also for the 
detection  of  rare  events  and  events  with  latency,  provided  that  the  exposure  and  recruitment  to  the 
pharmacoepidemiological programme is adequate.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
It is generally accepted that the combination of MTX with a biological is more active than methotrexate 
(MTX) alone and this appears true also for the abatacept-MTX combination. It is acknowledged that the 
study  submitted  in  this  application  in  support  of  the  initially  claimed  indication  in  the  MTX  naïve 
population  has  provided  data  on  clinically  significant  short  term  benefits.  It  can  be  seen  that  the 
different  trials  in  early  RA  (abatacept  and  anti-TNF)  are  also  similar  in  their  design  and  results.  The 
size of the radiological abatacept treatment effect appeared, however, small and comparisons to other 
therapies cannot be fully estimated on the basis of this submission, which would argue against the use 
of  abatacept  as  first-line  monotherapy.  In  the  absence  of  a  head-to-head  comparison  to  a  TNF 
inhibitor, there is some uncertainty of the relative benefits as compared to TNF inhibitors. For the time 
being,  the  safety  data  have  not  revealed  clear  safety  signals  other  than  increased  susceptibility  to 
infections.  On  the  basis  of  a  quite  sizable  safety  data  base,  abatacept  appears  to  lack  some  adverse 
effects  associated  with  TNF-inhibitors.  Thus,  the  relative  benefit/risk  of  abatacept  and  TNF-inhibitors, 
especially  in  the  long  term,  remains  somewhat  uncertain.  Therefore,  an  application  for  a  first  line 
EMA/361627/2010  
Page 25/26
 
 
 
 
 
indication (or the use of abatacept as monotherapy in case of methotrexate intolerance) is considered 
premature, which was accepted by the MAH.   
However, based on the available evidence and particularly the safety data generated since the original 
licensure  the  CHMP  recommends  that  abatacept  is  placed  into  the  second  line  for  patients  who  have 
responded  inadequately  to  one  or  more  DMARDs  or  TNF-inhibitors.  In  these  patients,  the  benefits 
outweigh the potential risks. Hence, the proposed therapeutic indication is as follows: 
“ORENCIA  in  combination  with  methotrexate  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe 
active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who responded inadequately to previous therapy with one 
or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist.  
Conclusion 
The  overall  B/R  of  is  positive  for  the  following  indication  with  rewording  (bold-  addition  of  text; 
strikethrough-deletion of text):  
“ORENCIA  in  combination  with  methotrexate  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe 
active  rheumatoid  arthritis  in  adult  patients  who  have  had  an  insufficient  response  or  intolerance 
responded  inadequately  to  other  previous  therapy  with  one  or  more  disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic  drugs  (DMARDs)  including  at  least  one  tumour  necrosis  factor  methotrexate  (MTX) 
or a TNF-alpha inhibitor.” 
4. Conclusion 
On  20  May  2010  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

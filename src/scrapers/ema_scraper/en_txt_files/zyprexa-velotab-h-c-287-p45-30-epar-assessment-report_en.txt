Assessment of paediatric studies according to Art 45 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
(the Paediatric Regulation)

Olanzapine studies in Children and Adolescents 
Introduction:  
As required by the Paediatric Regulation (article 45 of the Regulation 1901/2006, as amended), 
information on three additional olanzapine studies that have included altogether 36 children and 
adolescents were provided in December 2008 by the MAH. The submission consisted of an Abriaviated 
Clinical Study Report for study F1D-MC-HGKL, Synopsis of Study F1D-MC-HGCT and a Publication of 
Study F1D-UT-HGFP. 
Clinical studies with children and adolescents: 
1.  
Long Term Open-Label Trial of Olanzapine in Children with Childhood Onset 
Schizophrenia. [F1D-MC-HGCT] 
The objective was to establish long-term safety of olanzapine in a dose range of 2.5 mg every other 
day to 20 mg/day in a population of children and adolescents, 8 to 19 years of age (n=6), who derived 
significant clinical benefit with olanzapine during study F1D-MC-HGCS or F1D-MC-HGCR. This was a 
multicenter, open-label inpatient or outpatient study. After a 2- to 9-day screening and treatment 
phase, patients could enter an indefinite long-term olanzapine therapy phase. The duration of 
treatment experienced by patients in this study ranged from a minimum of 3 weeks to a maximum of 
40 weeks on olanzapine. 
No serious adverse events or deaths occurred in this study. Five of 6 patients experienced non-serious 
side effects from the drug. 
2.  
Open-Label Study of Olanzapine in Children with Pervasive Developmental 
Disorder (PDD) [F1D-UT-HGFP] 
The objective of this open label study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of olanzapine in the 
treatment of PDD in 25 children, especially with respect to problems in social relationships and 
communication. The study consisted of two periods: a screening and washout period of about 2 weeks 
(period I) and a 12-week open-label therapy period (period II). 
The study results have been published in J Clin Psychopharmacol 2002;22:455–460 According to the 
publication the present study evaluated systematically the safety of olanzapine in children. The most 
important adverse events were weight gain, loss of strength (asthenia), and increased appetite. Three 
children developed an extrapyramidal syndrome that disappeared after the dose was lowered. Thus, 
olanzapine would appear to be a relatively safe medication for children. However, the weight gain 
might interfere with treatment. 
3.  
Efficacy and Safety of Olanzapine in Patients with Borderline Personality 
Disorder (BPD): A Randomized, Flexible-Dose, Double-Blind Comparison with 
Placebo. [F1D-MC-HGKL] 
This was a multicenter, randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, with a 12-week, 
open-label extension. All patients received olanzapine during the open label period. Patients with BPD 
were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups: olanzapine 2.5 to 20 mg/day or placebo. 
Of the patients who were <18yrs of age, 5 enrolled double-blind period, and 4 entered open-label 
period 
This study originally planned to enroll a subpopulation of adolescent BPD patients. Due to concerns 
expressed by ethical review boards about the appropriateness of including adolescents in this trial, the 
study protocol was amended to exclude this subpopulation. Therefore, all reported analyses are limited 
to the adult data. Among adolescents in the olanzapine treatment group, the following AEs were 
reported: weight increased, asthma, headache, rhinitis allergic, and back pain. All were considered to

be of mild severity. There were no serious or potentially clinically significant laboratory findings among 
adolescent patients in either treatment group. 
Conclusion:  
Since olanzapine is not indicated for use in adolescents no efficacy aspect was discussed. None of 
these patients experienced serious, unexpected, possibly causally related adverse events. Based on the 
review of the submitted documents, studies concerning olanzapine in adolescents and children do not 
give any reason for further SPC changes at the moment. The studies have included 36 children and 
adolescents with schizophrenia (6 patients), pervasive developmental disorder (25 patients) 
and borderline personality disorder (5 patients). Drug-related adverse events were of similar 
quality as reported in adults, although based on the submitted studies, the safety of olanzapine in 
children and adolescents cannot be fully evaluated. Olanzapine does not have a treatment indication in 
these age groups currently.

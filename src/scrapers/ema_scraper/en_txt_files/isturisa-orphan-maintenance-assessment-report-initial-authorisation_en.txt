2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2014 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
The sponsor Novartis Europharm Limited submitted on 21 May 2014 an application for designation as 
an orphan medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product containing 4-
[(5R)-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-c]imidazol-5-yl]-3-fluorobenzonitrile phosphate for treatment of 
Cushing's syndrome (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”). The application was submitted on the 
basis of Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products. 
The International Nonproprietary Name (INN) “osilodrostat” was recommended during evaluation and 
the name of the active substance was changed accordingly. 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing osilodrostat was 
considered justified based on preliminary clinical data in patients with Cushing’s disease; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the consequences of 
hypercortisolism, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, clotting disorders, muscular weakness 
and osteoporosis, and psychiatric conditions; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting less than 1 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time the application was made. 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing osilodrostat may be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The 
sponsor has provided preliminary clinical data demonstrating significant effects on 24 hour free urinary 
cortisol levels in patients with Cushing’s disease. The Committee considered that this constitutes a 
clinically relevant advantage. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing osilodrostat, as an orphan medicinal product for the 
orphan indication: treatment of Cushing's syndrome.

3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Cushing’s syndrome is still a recognised condition in the current scientific literature and no changes to 
the classification of this condition were noted since the initial orphan designation.  
Cushing's syndrome is a disease characterised by an excess of the hormone cortisol in the blood. It is 
usually caused by a tumour of the pituitary gland (a gland located at the base of the brain) that 
produces large amounts of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which in turn stimulates the 
production of excess cortisol from the adrenal glands, which are situated above the kidney. Some 
patients with the syndrome have other kinds of tumours that produce ACTH, or tumours that produce 
excess cortisol directly. 
Clinical manifestations of chronic hypercortisolism include metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, 
visceral obesity, glucose intolerance, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and hypercoagulable state. Other 
clinical signs and symptoms of CS include: supraclavicular and dorsal fat pads; proximal muscle 
weakness; osteoporosis with increased risk of fractures; skin changes (wide purple striae, hirsutism, 
acne); impaired immune function with increased risk of infection; neuropsychiatric disorders 
(depression, mood changes, and cognitive impairment), hypogonadism, and menstrual disorders in 
women.  
The approved therapeutic indication “Treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome in adults” falls 
within the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of Cushing's syndrome”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Details of the clinical data submitted by the sponsor and of the benefit/ risk assessment can be found 
in the European public assessment report (EPAR) for Isturisa. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
There have been no changes in the chronically debilitating or life-threatening nature of the condition 
since the initial orphan designation on 15-Oct-2014. The sponsor acknowledged that Ketoconazole HRA 
was approved on 19-Nov-2014 for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome in adults and 
adolescents above the age of 12 years but that this substance has been used in the EU/EEA for this 
indication since the 1980’s.  
Number of people affected or at risk 
The estimate is based on the highest reported prevalence of Cushing’s disease (CD) in population-
based studies in Europe (0.55 per 10,000, Daly et al 2006) and the published observation that CD 
comprises 80% of all cases of Cushing’s syndrome (Newell-Price et al 2006). A recent publication 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
Page 5/13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Lacroix et al 2015) places the estimated incidence of endogenous Cushing's syndrome at 0.2–5.0 per 
million people per year, and the prevalence at 39–79 per million in various populations; median age of 
onset/diagnosis was 41.4 years with a female-to-male ratio of 3:1. The sponsor therefore maintains 
that the estimated prevalence of Cushing’s syndrome in the EU is around 0.69 in 10,000 persons and 
has not changed since this initial orphan designation. Since the definition of the condition is the same, 
and the consulted literature does not indicate changes in incidence, this estimate can be accepted.  
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The main objectives for the treatment of hypercortisolism include: 1) normalization of cortisol 
secretion; 2) reversal of the clinical picture; 3) prevention or recovery of the concomitant comorbidities 
and clinical complications; and 4) long-term disease control without disease recurrence (Pivonello et al 
2015). The achievement of these objectives frequently requires a multimodal treatment approach. 
The sponsor provided a table of all authorised products for treatment of Cushing’s syndrome (Table 1).

Active Substance 
Indication 
Trilostane 
Metyrapone 
Mitotane 
Aminoglutethimide 
Pasireotide 
Ketoconazole 
For the control of the manifestation of adrenal cortical 
hyperfunction in such conditions as hypercortisolism 
and primary aldosteronism. 
As a diagnostic test for ACTH insufficiency and in the 
differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing’s 
syndrome. 
For the management of patients with endogenous 
Cushing’s syndrome. 
Mitotane (Lysodren®) is a steroidogenesis inhibitor 
and an adrenolytic agent used for the symptomatic 
treatment of advanced (unresectable, metastatic or 
relapsed) adrenocortical carcinoma. The effect of 
mitotane (Lysodren®) on non-functional adrenal 
cortical carcinoma is not established. 
Cushing’s syndrome due to: 
- Adrenocortical tumours (adenoma or carcinoma) 
- Adrenocortical hyperplasia 
- ACTH production at sites other than the pituitary 
(ectopic ACTH syndrome) 
In Cushing’s patients, Orimeten can be used as 
premedication prior to surgery, as treatment for 
relapses following subtotal adrenalectomy or as 
treatment for inoperable cases. 
Treatment of adult patients with Cushing’s disease for 
whom surgery is not an option or for whom surgery 
has failed. 
Ketoconazole HRA is indicated for the treatment of 
endogenous Cushing’s syndrome in adults and 
adolescents above the age of 12 years.

The article describing treatment of Cushing’s syndrome cited by the sponsor was superseded by more 
recent but similar publications (e.g. Nieman LK. Recent Updates on the Diagnosis and Management of 
Cushing's Syndrome. Endocrinol Metab (Seoul). 2018;33(2):139–146). 
Significant benefit 
Protocol assistance for the justification of significant benefit has been sought, and the 
recommendations have been followed. The sponsor claims significant benefit of improved efficacy 
based on an indirect comparison to existing treatment options and the results from Phase 3 studies 
showing control of free urinary cortisol, lack of treatment escape phenomenon and improved patient 
quality of life as measured by several standard questionnaires. 
The efficacy and safety of osilodrostat were evaluated in a prospective phase III study (study C2301) 
that used a randomised withdrawal design. The study consisted of a 26-week open-label period of 
single-arm osilodrostat treatment, followed by an 8-week randomised withdrawal period in which 
patients were randomised in 1:1 ratio to either osilodrostat or placebo and a subsequent osilodrostat 
open-label period. 
The eligibility criteria included a mean urinary free cortisol (mUFC, derived from three 24-hour urine 
collections) value greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening, and a 
confirmation of the pituitary source of excess adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). A total of 137 
adult patients were enrolled. The mean age was 41.2 years, and the majority of patients were female 
(77%). Prior therapy included pituitary surgery in 88% of patients and prior medical therapy in 75% of 
patients. The median baseline mUFC was 476.4 nmol/24 h (ULN: 138 nmol/24 h). Comorbidities at 
baseline included hypertension (67.9% of patients), obesity (29.9%), diabetes mellitus (21.9%) and 
osteoporosis (27.7%).

Importantly, no requirement for continuous dose increases to overcome an ACTH-driven “escape” 
phenomenon was observed. After the initial (protocol-mandated) dose escalation phase in the pivotal 
Phase III study, the average dose levels remained consistently in the 5 mg bid range while mean 
mUFC levels remained in the normal range.

Consistent improvements were observed in cardiovascular and metabolic parameters, and 85.6% of 
patients showed an improvement in at least one physical feature of Cushing’s disease (facial rubor, 
dorsal and supraclavicular fat pads, central/abdominal obesity, ecchymosis/bruising, proximal muscle 
wasting/atrophy, striae, and/or female hirsutism) at week 48. 
Improvements from baseline above the established minimal important difference (MID) were 
consistently observed for Cushing’s QoL (total score, Physical Problems subscale and Psychosocial 
issues subscale), EQ 5D Utility index and BDI II (depression) scores. The mean Cushing QoL total score 
improved from 42.2 at baseline to 51.0 (+8.4; +29.1% change from baseline) at week 12 and to 58.3 
(+14.1; +52.4% change from baseline) at week 48. 
As proposed in the protocol assistance letter, the sponsor performed an indirect comparison of own 
data to published clinical data on the relevant comparators.  
With regards to pasireotide the sponsor compared two clinical trials with both products: osilodrostat 
(study C2301) and pasireotide (Study G2304). The inclusion criteria differed between studies, with 
more severe patients (higher mUFC values) included in C2301 study. This study also was longer in 
duration (80.3 vs 67.6 weeks). Based on this comparison, the response rate (ORR 83.5% vs. 53.3%) 
and the durability of response (100% vs. 44% ORR at 12 months) seem to be better for osilodrostat. 
All other aspects, including QOL, physical changes and safety seem comparable between the two 
studies (Table 3).

The indirect comparison to ketoconazole is based on the largest retrospective patient series currently 
available in the literature (Castinetti et al 2014) and on top-level results reported from a study with the 
experimental compound levoketoconazole. The comparability of the populations was difficult to 
establish. However, independent of the inclusion criteria the sponsor concluded that Ketoconazole is 
associated with serious (and in some cases fatal) hepatotoxicity, lower initial control rates and a 
significant loss of efficacy during long-term treatment (up to 15% in Ketoconazole vs. 0% in 
osilodrostat), and an extensive number of clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. In particular, the 
lack of escape cases in the osilodrostat study speaks in favour of this product, which is also associated 
with more manageable safety profile. The results with levoketoconazole (SONICS study) showed 
comparable efficacy to that of enantiomeric mix of ketoconazole.

The sponsor discussed also metyrapone, an orally administered drug which induces normalization of 
cortisol secretion at the end of the treatment period in an average of 50% of patients, with a 
consequent improvement in the clinical features (Daniels et al 2015), but it is affected by an escape 
from the response in up to 18.7% (mean 7.8%) of patients with initial response to treatment 
(Pivonello et al 2015). The sponsor claims lack of escape cases (defined as the first loss of control of 
UFC after at least one instance of UFC normalization, that is not due to treatment interruption or AE) in 
the study of osilodrostat. This comparison should be interpreted with caution based on small sample 
sizes in the studies with metyrapone. Based on the totality of evidence to date, however, this reduction 
of escapes would bring a clear benefit in terms of lasting efficacy. The response rate to metyrapone is 
reported to be around 71% (Pivonello et al 2015) comparable to the complete response rates of 
osilodrostat at Week 24 of 67.9% (ORR 82.5%). 
Mitotane is an adrenolytic drug for the symptomatic treatment of unresectable, metastatic or relapsed 
adrenocortical carcinoma; it has a very slow onset of action and is associated with significant toxicities. 
The sponsor discussed it and concluded that osilodrostat has a significantly broader therapeutic scope 
and this would constitute a clinically relevant advantage. 
Other products used off label in treatment of Cushing’s syndrome were also discussed in terms of their 
significant limitations such as sedative effect in case of etomidate and the withdrawn regulatory status 
of mifepristone.

Taken together the sponsor discussed all authorised products and provided critical appraisal of their 
relative features and efficacies. Taken together, in accordance with the protocol assistance advice, the 
sponsor confirmed the assumption of improved efficacy by presenting data from the pivotal study with 
osilodrostat supported by Phase 2 data. Osilodrostat showed improved efficacy in terms of high rate of 
mUFC levels control in pre-treated patients as well as in treatment-naïve patients and improved 
durability of the treatment effect due to reduced escape rate when using this medicine over a long 
period of time. This was combined by manageable safety profile with reassuring tolerability and 
documented improvement of the patient quality of life.

5.  COMP position adopted on 18 November 2019 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of Cushing's syndrome (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.7 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the consequences of 
hypercortisolism, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, clotting disorders, muscular weakness 
and osteoporosis, and psychiatric conditions; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, the assumption that Isturisa may be of potential significant benefit to those affected by the 
orphan condition still holds. The sponsor provided data to demonstrate that the use of Isturisa 
leads to a high response rate in treatment–naïve and pretreated patients and that the responses 
are maintained, with no treatment escape cases reported in the pivotal clinical study. This 
constitutes a clinically relevant advantage over all existing authorised products as established in 
the pivotal trial and by indirect comparisons. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Isturisa, osilodrostat, 
EU/3/14/1345 for treatment of Cushing's syndrome is not removed from the Community Register of 
Orphan Medicinal Products.

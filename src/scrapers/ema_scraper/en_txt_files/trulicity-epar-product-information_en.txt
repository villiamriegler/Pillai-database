Trulicity is indicated for the treatment of patients 10 years and above with insufficiently controlled 
type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise 
• 
as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or 
contraindications 
in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes.  
• 
For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, 
and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.

4.2   Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Adults 
Monotherapy  
The recommended dose is 0.75 mg once weekly. 
Add-on therapy 
The recommended dose is 1.5 mg once weekly. 
If needed,  
• 
• 
The maximum dose is 4.5 mg once weekly.  
the 1.5 mg dose can be increased after at least 4 weeks to 3 mg once weekly. 
the 3 mg dose can be increased after at least 4 weeks to 4.5 mg once weekly. 
Paediatrics  
The starting dose for paediatric patients 10 years and above is 0.75 mg once weekly.  
If needed, the dose can be increased to 1.5 mg once weekly after at least 4 weeks. The maximum dose 
is 1.5 mg once weekly.  
Combination therapy 
When Trulicity is added to existing metformin and/or pioglitazone therapy, the current dose of 
metformin and/or pioglitazone can be continued. When Trulicity is added to existing metformin 
and/or sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) therapy, the current dose of metformin 
and/or SGLT2i can be continued. When it is added to existing therapy of a sulphonylurea or insulin, a 
reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea or insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of 
hypoglycaemia (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
The use of Trulicity does not require blood glucose self-monitoring. Blood glucose self-monitoring is 
necessary to adjust the dose of sulphonylurea or insulin, particularly when Trulicity therapy is started 
and insulin is reduced. A stepwise approach to insulin dose reduction is recommended. 
Missed doses 
If a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible if there are at least 3 days (72 hours) 
until the next scheduled dose. If less than 3 days (72 hours) remain before the next scheduled dose, 
the missed dose should be skipped and the next dose should be administered on the regularly 
scheduled day. In each case, patients can then resume their regular once weekly dosing schedule. 
Special population 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required based on age (see section 5.2).  
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (eGFR 
< 90 to ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73m2). 
There is very limited experience in patients with end stage renal disease (< 15 ml/min/1.73m2), 
therefore Trulicity cannot be recommended in this population (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of dulaglutide in children aged less than 10 years have not been established 
and no data are available (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Method of administration 
Trulicity is to be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. It should not be 
administered intravenously or intramuscularly. 
The dose can be administered at any time of day, with or without meals.  
The day of weekly administration can be changed if necessary, as long as the last dose was 
administered 3 or more days (72 hours) before. 
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded. 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis 
Dulaglutide should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of 
diabetic ketoacidosis. Dulaglutide is not a substitute for insulin.  
Diabetic ketoacidosis has been reported in insulin-dependent patients after rapid discontinuation or 
dose reduction of insulin (see section 4.2). 
Severe gastrointestinal disease 
Dulaglutide has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including severe 
gastroparesis, and is therefore not recommended in these patients. 
Dehydration 
Dehydration, sometimes leading to acute renal failure or worsening renal impairment, has been 
reported in patients treated with dulaglutide, especially at the initiation of treatment. Many of the 
reported adverse renal events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, 
or dehydration. Patients treated with dulaglutide should be advised of the potential risk of 
dehydration, particularly in relation to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and take precautions to avoid 
fluid depletion.

Acute pancreatitis 
Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. In 
clinical trials, acute pancreatitis has been reported in association with dulaglutide (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is 
suspected, dulaglutide should be discontinued. If pancreatitis is confirmed, dulaglutide should not be 
restarted. In the absence of other signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis, elevations in pancreatic 
enzymes alone are not predictive of acute pancreatitis (see section 4.8). 
Hypoglycaemia 
Patients receiving dulaglutide in combination with sulphonylurea or insulin may have an increased 
risk of hypoglycaemia. The risk of hypoglycaemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of 
sulphonylurea or insulin (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium- free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Dulaglutide delays gastric emptying and has the potential to impact the rate of absorption of 
concomitantly administered oral medicinal products. In the clinical pharmacology studies described 
below, dulaglutide doses up to 1.5 mg did not affect the absorption of the orally administered 
medicinal products tested to any clinically relevant degree. For the 4.5 mg dose, absence of major 
clinically relevant interactions was predicted by physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) 
modelling simulations. 
For patients receiving dulaglutide in combination with oral medicinal products with rapid 
gastrointestinal absorption or prolonged release, there is a potential for altered medicinal product 
exposure, particularly at the time of dulaglutide treatment initiation.   
Sitagliptin 
Sitagliptin exposure was unaffected when coadministered with a single 1.5 mg dose of dulaglutide. 
Following coadministration with 2 consecutive 1.5 mg doses of dulaglutide, sitagliptin AUC(0-τ) and 
Cmax decreased by approximately 7.4 % and 23.1 %, respectively. Sitagliptin tmax increased 
approximately 0.5 hours following coadministration with dulaglutide compared to sitagliptin alone. 
Sitagliptin can produce up to 80 % inhibition of DPP-4 over a 24-hour period. Dulaglutide (1.5 mg) 
coadministration with sitagliptin increased dulaglutide exposure and Cmax by approximately 38 % and 
27 %, respectively, and median tmax increased approximately 24 hours. Therefore, dulaglutide does 
have a high degree of protection against DPP-4 inactivation (see section 5.1, Mechanism of action). 
The increased exposure may enhance the effects of dulaglutide on blood glucose levels. 
Paracetamol 
Following a first dose of 1 and 3 mg dulaglutide, paracetamol Cmax was reduced by 36 % and 50 %, 
respectively, and the median tmax occurred later (3 and 4 hours, respectively). After coadministration 
with up to 3 mg of dulaglutide at steady state, there were no statistically significant differences on 
AUC(0-12), Cmax or tmax of paracetamol. No dose adjustment of paracetamol is necessary when 
administered with dulaglutide. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Atorvastatin 
Coadministration of 1.5 mg of dulaglutide with atorvastatin decreased Cmax and AUC(0-∞) up to 70 % 
and 21 %, respectively, for atorvastatin and its major metabolite o-hydroxyatorvastatin. The mean t1/2 
of atorvastatin and o-hydroxyatorvastatin were increased by 17 % and 41 %, respectively, following 
dulaglutide administration. These observations are not clinically relevant. No dose adjustment of 
atorvastatin is necessary when administered with dulaglutide. 
Digoxin  
After coadministration of steady state digoxin with 2 consecutive 1.5 mg doses of dulaglutide, overall 
exposure (AUCτ) and tmax of digoxin were unchanged; and Cmax decreased by up to 22 %. This change 
is not expected to have clinical consequences. No dose adjustment is required for digoxin when 
administered with dulaglutide. 
Anti-hypertensives 
Coadministration of multiple dulaglutide 1.5 mg doses with steady state lisinopril caused no clinically 
relevant changes in the AUC or Cmax of lisinopril. Statistically significant delays in lisinopril tmax of 
approximately 1 hour were observed on Days 3 and 24 of the study. When a single 1.5 mg dose of 
dulaglutide and metoprolol were coadministered, the AUC and Cmax of metoprolol increased by19 % 
and 32 %, respectively. While metoprolol tmax was delayed by 1 hour, this change was not statistically 
significant. These changes were not clinically relevant; therefore, no dose adjustment of lisinopril or 
metoprolol is necessary when administered with dulaglutide. 
Warfarin  
Following dulaglutide (1.5 mg) coadministration, S- and R-warfarin exposure and R-warfarin Cmax 
were unaffected, and S-warfarin Cmax decreased by 22 %. AUCINR increased by 2 %, which is unlikely 
to be clinically significant, and there was no effect on maximum international normalised ratio 
response (INRmax). The time of international normalised ratio response (tINRmax) was delayed by 
6 hours, consistent with delays in tmax of approximately 4 and 6 hours for S- and R-warfarin, 
respectively. These changes are not clinically relevant. No dose adjustment for warfarin is necessary 
when given together with dulaglutide. 
Oral contraceptives 
Coadministration of dulaglutide (1.5 mg) with an oral contraceptive (norgestimate 0.18 mg/ethinyl 
estradiol 0.025 mg) did not affect the overall exposure to norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol. 
Statistically significant reductions in Cmax of 26 % and 13 % and delays in tmax of 2 and 0.30 hours 
were observed for norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol, respectively. These observations are not 
clinically relevant. No dose adjustment for oral contraceptives is required when given together with 
dulaglutide. 
Metformin 
Following coadministration of multiple 1.5 mg doses of dulaglutide with steady state metformin 
(immediate release formula [IR]), metformin AUCτ increased up to 15 % and Cmax decreased up to 
12 %, respectively, with no changes in tmax. These changes are consistent with the gastric emptying 
delay of dulaglutide and within the pharmacokinetic variability of metformin and thus are not 
clinically relevant. No dose adjustment for metformin IR is recommended when given with 
dulaglutide.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of dulaglutide in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Therefore, the use of dulaglutide is not 
recommended during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether dulaglutide is excreted in human milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be 
excluded. Dulaglutide should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
The effect of dulaglutide on fertility in humans is unknown. In the rat, there was no direct effect on 
mating or fertility following treatment with dulaglutide (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Trulicity has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. When it is used in 
combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid 
hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines (see section 4.4). 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of safety profile 
In the completed phase 2 and phase 3 studies to support the initial registration of dulaglutide 0.75 mg 
and 1.5 mg, 4,006 patients were exposed to dulaglutide alone or in combination with other glucose 
lowering medicinal products. The most frequently reported adverse reactions in clinical trials were 
gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In general, these reactions were mild or 
moderate in severity and transient in nature. Results from the long-term cardiovascular outcome study 
with 4,949 patients randomised to dulaglutide and followed for a median of 5.4 years were consistent 
with these findings. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following adverse reactions have been identified based on evaluation of the full duration of the 
phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies, the long-term cardiovascular outcome study and post-marketing 
reports. The adverse reactions are listed in Table 1 as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class 
and in order of decreasing incidence (very common: ≥ 1/10; common: ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10; uncommon: 
≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100; rare: ≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000; very rare: < 1/10,000 and not known: cannot be 
estimated from available data). Within each incidence grouping, adverse reactions are presented in 
order of decreasing frequency. Frequencies for events have been calculated based on their incidence 
in the phase 2 and phase 3 registration studies.

events were mild to moderate in severity. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Hypoglycaemia 
When dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg were used as monotherapy or in combination with metformin 
alone or metformin and pioglitazone, the incidences of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia were 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.9 % to 10.9 % and the rates were 0.14 to 0.62 events/patient/year, and no episodes of severe 
hypoglycaemia were reported. 
The incidences of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia when dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg, 
respectively, were used in combination with a sulphonylurea and metformin were 39.0 % and 40.3 % 
and the rates were 1.67 and 1.67 events/patient/year. The severe hypoglycaemia event incidences 
were 0 % and 0.7 %, and rates were 0.00 and 0.01 events/patient/year for each dose, respectively. The 
incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia when dulaglutide 1.5 mg was used with 
sulphonylurea alone was 11.3 % and the rate was 0.90 events/patient/year, and there were no episodes 
of severe hypoglycaemia. 
The incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia when dulaglutide 1.5 mg was used in 
combination with insulin glargine was 35.3 % and the rate was 3.38 events/patient/year. The severe 
hypoglycaemia event incidence was 0.7 % and the rate was 0.01 events/patient/year. 
The incidences when dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg, respectively, were used in combination with 
prandial insulin were 85.3 % and 80.0 % and rates were 35.66 and 31.06 events/patient/year. The 
severe hypoglycaemia event incidences were 2.4 % and 3.4 %, and rates were 0.05 and 
0.06 events/patient/year. 
In a phase 3 study through to week 52, when dulaglutide 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg were used in 
combination with metformin, the incidences of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia were 3.1 %, 
2.4 % and 3.1 %, respectively, and rates were 0.07, 0.05 and 0.07 events/patient/year; one episode of 
severe hypoglycaemia was reported with dulaglutide 1.5 mg and 4.5 mg, respectively. 
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions 
Cumulative reporting of gastrointestinal events up to 104 weeks with dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg, 
respectively, included nausea (12.9 % and 21.2 %), diarrhoea (10.7 % and 13.7 %) and vomiting 
(6.9 % and 11.5 %). These were typically mild or moderate in severity and were reported to peak 
during the first 2 weeks of treatment and rapidly declined over the next 4 weeks, after which the rate 
remained relatively constant.  
In a phase 3 study with 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg dulaglutide doses respectively, cumulative reporting 
of gastrointestinal events through to 52 weeks included nausea (14.2 %, 16.1 % and 17.3 %), 
diarrhoea (7.7 %, 12.0 % and 11.6 %) and vomiting (6.4 %, 9.1 % and 10.1 %). In clinical 
pharmacology studies conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus up to 6 weeks, the majority 
of gastrointestinal events were reported during the first 2-3 days after the initial dose and declined 
with subsequent doses. 
Acute pancreatitis  
The incidence of acute pancreatitis in phase 2 and 3 registration studies was 0.07 % for dulaglutide 
compared to 0.14 % for placebo and 0.19 % for comparators with or without additional background 
antidiabetic therapy. Acute pancreatitis and pancreatitis have also been reported in the post-marketing 
setting. 
Pancreatic enzymes 
Dulaglutide is associated with mean increases from baseline in pancreatic enzymes (lipase and/or 
pancreatic amylase) of 11 % to 21 % (see section 4.4). In the absence of other signs and symptoms of 
acute pancreatitis, elevations in pancreatic enzymes alone are not predictive of acute pancreatitis. 
Heart rate increase  
Small mean increases in heart rate of 2 to 4 beats per minute (bpm) and a 1.3 % and 1.4 % incidence 
of sinus tachycardia, with a concomitant increase from baseline ≥ 15 bpm, were observed with 
dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg, respectively.  
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a phase 3 study with 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg dulaglutide doses, the incidence of sinus 
tachycardia, with a concomitant increase from baseline ≥ 15 bpm, was 2.6 %, 1.9 % and 2.6 % 
respectively. Mean increases in heart rate of 1 – 4 beats per minute (bpm) were observed. 
First degree AV block/PR interval prolongation  
Small mean increases from baseline in PR interval of 2 to 3 msec and a 1.5 % and 2.4 % incidence of 
first-degree AV block were observed with dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg, respectively. 
In a phase 3 study with 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg dulaglutide doses, the incidence of first-degree AV 
block was 1.2 %, 3.8 % and 1.7 % respectively. Mean increases from baseline in PR interval of 
3 – 5 msec were observed.  
Immunogenicity  
In registration studies, treatment with dulaglutide was associated with a 1.6 % incidence of treatment 
emergent dulaglutide anti-drug antibodies, indicating that the structural modifications in the GLP-1 
and modified IgG4 parts of the dulaglutide molecule, together with high homology with native GLP-1 
and native IgG4, minimise the risk of immune response against dulaglutide. Patients with dulaglutide 
anti-drug antibodies generally had low titres, and although the number of patients developing 
dulaglutide anti-drug antibodies was low, examination of the phase 3 data revealed no clear impact of 
dulaglutide anti-drug antibodies on changes in HbA1c. None of the patients with systemic 
hypersensitivity developed dulaglutide anti-drug antibodies. 
Hypersensitivity  
In the phase 2 and phase 3 registration studies, systemic hypersensitivity events (e.g., urticaria, 
edema) were reported in 0.5 % of patients receiving dulaglutide. Cases of anaphylactic reaction have 
been rarely reported with marketed use of dulaglutide.  
Injection site reactions  
Injection site adverse events were reported in 1.9 % of patients receiving dulaglutide. Potentially 
immune-mediated injection site adverse events (e.g., rash, erythema) were reported in 0.7 % of 
patients and were usually mild. 
Discontinuation due to an adverse event 
In studies of 26 weeks duration, the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events was 2.6 % 
(0.75 mg) and 6.1 % (1.5 mg) for dulaglutide versus 3.7 % for placebo. Through the full study 
duration (up to 104 weeks), the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events was 5.1 % 
(0.75 mg) and 8.4 % (1.5 mg) for dulaglutide. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to 
discontinuation for 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg dulaglutide, respectively, were nausea (1.0 %, 1.9 %), 
diarrhoea (0.5 %, 0.6 %), and vomiting (0.4 %, 0.6 %), and were generally reported within the first 
4 - 6 weeks.  
In a phase 3 study with 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg dulaglutide doses, the incidence of discontinuation 
due to adverse events through 52 weeks was 6.0 % (1.5 mg), 7.0 % (3 mg) and 8.5 % (4.5 mg). The 
most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation for dulaglutide 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg, 
respectively, were nausea (1.3 %, 1.3 %, 1.5 %), diarrhoea (0.2 %, 1.0 %, 1.0 %), and vomiting 
(0.0 %, 0.8 %, 1.3 %). 
Dulaglutide doses of 3 mg and 4.5 mg  
The safety profile in patients treated with dulaglutide 3 mg and 4.5 mg once weekly is consistent with 
that described above for dulaglutide doses of 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg once weekly. 
Paediatric population 
The safety profile in paediatric patients aged 10 years and above treated with dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 
1.5 mg once-weekly is comparable with that described above for adult patients.  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The immunogenicity profile in paediatric patients treated with dulaglutide is consistent with that 
described above for adult patients. In the paediatric study, 2.1 % and 4.0 % of patients treated with 
placebo and dulaglutide respectively developed treatment emergent dulaglutide anti-drug antibodies.   
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Effects of overdose with dulaglutide in clinical studies have included gastrointestinal disorders and 
hypoglycaemia. In the event of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated 
according to the patient’s clinical signs and symptoms.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, blood glucose lowering drugs, excl. insulins, 
ATC code: A10BJ05 
Mechanism of action 
Dulaglutide is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. The molecule consists 
of 2 identical disulfide-linked chains, each containing a modified human GLP-1 analogue sequence 
covalently linked to a modified human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) heavy chain fragment (Fc) by a 
small peptide linker. The GLP-1 analog portion of dulaglutide is approximately 90 % homologous to 
native human GLP-1 (7-37). Native GLP-1 has a half-life of 1.5 - 2 minutes due to degradation by 
DPP-4 and renal clearance. In contrast to native GLP-1, dulaglutide is resistant to degradation by 
DPP-4, and has a large size that slows absorption and reduces renal clearance. These engineering 
features result in a soluble formulation and a prolonged half-life of 4.7 days, which makes it suitable 
for once-weekly subcutaneous administration. In addition, the dulaglutide molecule was engineered to 
prevent the Fcγ receptor-dependent immune response and to reduce its immunogenic potential. 
Dulaglutide exhibits several antihyperglycaemic actions of GLP-1. In the presence of elevated glucose 
concentrations, dulaglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) in pancreatic beta cells leading 
to insulin release. Dulaglutide suppresses glucagon secretion which is known to be inappropriately 
elevated in patients with type 2 diabetes. Lower glucagon concentrations lead to decreased hepatic 
glucose output. Dulaglutide also slows gastric emptying. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Dulaglutide improves glycaemic control through the sustained effects of lowering fasting, pre-meal 
and postprandial glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes starting after the first 
dulaglutide administration and is sustained throughout the once weekly dosing interval. 
A pharmacodynamic study with dulaglutide demonstrated, in patients with type 2 diabetes, a 
restoration of first phase insulin secretion to a level that exceeded levels observed in healthy subjects 
on placebo and improved second phase insulin secretion in response to an intravenous bolus of 
glucose. In the same study, a single 1.5 mg dose of dulaglutide appeared to increase maximal insulin

secretion from the β-cells, and to enhance β-cell function in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus as 
compared with placebo. 
Consistent with the pharmacokinetic profile, dulaglutide has a pharmacodynamic profile suitable for 
once weekly administration (see section 5.2). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Glycaemic control 
The safety and efficacy of dulaglutide were evaluated in ten randomised, controlled, phase 3 trials 
involving 8,035 patients with type 2 diabetes. Of these, 1,644 were ≥ 65 years of which 174 were 
≥ 75 years. These studies included 5,650 dulaglutide treated patients, of whom 1,558 were treated 
with Trulicity 0.75 mg weekly, 2,862 were treated with Trulicity 1.5 mg weekly, 616 were treated 
with Trulicity 3 mg weekly and 614 were treated with Trulicity 4.5 mg weekly. In all studies, 
dulaglutide produced clinically significant improvements in glycaemic control as measured by 
glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).  
Monotherapy 
Dulaglutide was studied in a 52-week active controlled monotherapy study in comparison to 
metformin. Trulicity 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg were superior to metformin (1500 - 2000 mg/day) in the 
reduction in HbA1c and a significantly greater proportion of patients reached an HbA1c target of 
< 7.0 % and ≤ 6.5 % with Trulicity 1.5 mg and Trulicity 0.75 mg compared to metformin at 26 weeks.

The safety and efficacy of dulaglutide was investigated in a placebo and active controlled (sitagliptin 
100 mg daily) study of 104 weeks duration, all in combination with metformin. Treatment with 
Trulicity 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg resulted in a superior reduction in HbA1c compared to sitagliptin at 
52 weeks, accompanied by a significantly greater proportion of patients achieving HbA1c targets of 
< 7.0 % and ≤ 6.5 %. These effects were sustained to the end of the study (104 weeks).

Combination therapy with metformin and sulphonylurea 
In an active controlled study of 78 weeks duration, dulaglutide was compared to insulin glargine, both 
on a background of metformin and a sulphonylurea. At 52 weeks, Trulicity 1.5 mg demonstrated 
superior lowering in HbA1c to insulin glargine which was maintained at 78 weeks; whereas lowering 
in HbA1c with Trulicity 0.75 mg was non-inferior to insulin glargine. With Trulicity 1.5 mg a 
significantly higher percentage of patients reached a target HbA1c of < 7.0 % or ≤ 6.5 % at 52 and

Combination therapy with titrated basal insulin, with or without metformin 
In a 28-week placebo controlled study, Trulicity1.5 mg was compared to placebo as add-on to titrated 
basal insulin glargine (88 % with and 12 % without metformin) to evaluate the effect on glycaemic 
control and safety. To optimise the insulin glargine dose, both groups were titrated to a target fasting 
serum glucose of < 5.6 mmol/L. The mean baseline dose of insulin glargine was 37 units/day for 
patients receiving placebo and 41 units/day for patients receiving Trulicity 1.5 mg.  The initial insulin 
glargine doses in patients with HbA1c < 8.0 % were reduced by 20 %. At the end of the 28-week 
treatment period the dose was 65 units/day and 51 units/day, for patients receiving placebo and 
Trulicity 1.5 mg, respectively. At 28 weeks, treatment with once weekly Trulicity 1.5 mg resulted in a 
statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared to placebo and a significantly greater 
percentage of patients achieving HbA1c targets of < 7.0 % and ≤ 6.5 % (Table 9).

One patient reported severe hypoglycaemia with dulaglutide 1.5 mg in combination with insulin 
glargine and none with placebo. 
Combination therapy with prandial insulin with or without metformin 
In this study, patients on 1 or 2 insulin injections per day prior to study entry, discontinued their 
prestudy insulin regimen and were randomised to dulaglutide once weekly or insulin glargine once 
daily, both in combination with prandial insulin lispro three times daily, with or without metformin. 
At 26 weeks, both Trulicity 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg were superior to insulin glargine in lowering of 
HbA1c and this effect was sustained at 52 weeks. A greater percentage of patients achieved HbA1c 
targets of < 7.0 % or ≤ 6.5 % at 26 weeks and < 7.0 % at 52 weeks than with insulin glargine.

The rates of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia with dulaglutide 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg, and 
insulin glargine were 31.06, 35.66, and 40.95 episodes/patient/year, respectively. Ten patients 
reported severe hypoglycaemia with dulaglutide 1.5 mg, seven with dulaglutide 0.75 mg, and fifteen 
with insulin glargine. 
Fasting blood glucose 
Treatment with dulaglutide resulted in significant reductions from baseline in fasting blood glucose. 
The majority of the effect on fasting blood glucose concentrations occurred by 2 weeks. The 
improvement in fasting glucose was sustained through the longest study duration of 104 weeks. 
Postprandial glucose 
Treatment with dulaglutide resulted in significant reductions in mean post prandial glucose from 
baseline (changes from baseline to primary time point -1.95 mmol/L to -4.23 mmol/L). 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Beta-cell function 
Clinical studies with dulaglutide have indicated enhanced beta-cell function as measured by 
homeostasis model assessment (HOMA2-%B). The durability of effect on beta-cell function was 
maintained through the longest study duration of 104 weeks. 
Body weight 
Trulicity 1.5 mg was associated with sustained weight reduction over the duration of studies (from 
baseline to final time point -0.35 kg to -2.90 kg). Changes in body weight with Trulicity 0.75 mg 
ranged from 0.86 kg to -2.63 kg. Reduction in body weight was observed in patients treated with 
dulaglutide irrespective of nausea, though the reduction was numerically larger in the group with 
nausea. 
Patient reported outcomes 
Dulaglutide significantly improved total treatment satisfaction compared to exenatide twice daily. In 
addition, there was significantly lower perceived frequency of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia 
compared to exenatide twice daily. 
Blood pressure 
The effect of dulaglutide on blood pressure as assessed by Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring 
was evaluated in a study of 755 patients with type 2 diabetes. Treatment with dulaglutide provided 
reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) (-2.8 mmHg difference compared to placebo) at 16 weeks. 
There was no difference in diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Similar results for SBP and DBP were 
demonstrated at the final 26 week time point of the study. 
Cardiovascular Evaluation 
Meta-analysis of phase 2 and 3 studies 
In a meta-analysis of phase 2 and 3 registration studies, a total of 51 patients (dulaglutide: 
26 [N = 3,885]; all comparators: 25 [N = 2,125]) experienced at least one cardiovascular (CV) event 
(death due to CV causes, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalisation for unstable angina). The 
results showed that there was no increase in CV risk with dulaglutide compared with control therapies 
(HR: 0.57; CI: [0.30, 1.10]). 
Cardiovascular outcome study 
The Trulicity long-term cardiovascular outcome study was a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical 
trial. Type 2 diabetes patients were randomly allocated to either Trulicity 1.5 mg (4,949) or placebo 
(4,952) both in addition to standards of care for type 2 diabetes (the 0.75 mg dose was not 
administered in this study). The median study follow-up time was 5.4 years.  
The mean age was 66.2 years, the mean BMI was 32.3 kg/m², and 46.3 % of patients were female. 
There were 3,114 (31.5 %) patients with established CV disease. The median baseline HbA1c was 
7.2 %. The Trulicity treatment arm included patients ≥ 65 years (n = 2,619) and ≥ 75 years (n = 484), 
and patients with mild (n = 2,435), moderate (n = 1,031) or severe (n = 50) renal impairment.  
The primary endpoint was the time from randomisation to first occurrence of any major adverse 
cardiovascular events (MACE): CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke. 
Trulicity was superior in preventing MACE compared to placebo (Figure 1). Each MACE component 
contributed to the reduction of MACE, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Forest plot of analyses of individual cardiovascular event types, all cause death, and

A significant and sustained reduction in HbA1c levels from baseline to month 60 was observed with 
Trulicity vs placebo, in addition to standard of care (-0.29 % vs 0.22 %; estimated treatment 
difference -0.51 % [-0.57; -0.45]; p < 0.001). There were significantly fewer patients in the Trulicity 
group who received an additional glycaemic intervention compared to placebo (Trulicity: 2,086 
[42.2 %]; placebo: 2,825 [57.0 %]; p < 0.001). 
Combination of dulaglutide 4.5 mg, 3 mg and 1.5 mg therapy with metformin 
The safety and efficacy of dulaglutide 3 mg and 4.5 mg once weekly compared to dulaglutide 1.5 mg 
once weekly as add-on to metformin were investigated in a 52 weeks study. At 36 weeks, both 
Trulicity 3 mg and 4.5 mg were superior to Trulicity 1.5 mg in lowering of HbA1c and body weight. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
A greater percentage of patients achieved HbA1c targets of < 7.0 % or ≤ 6.5 % at 36 weeks with 
Trulicity 3 mg and Trulicity 4.5 mg. The proportions of patients that achieved ≥ 5 % body weight 
reduction from baseline were 31 %, 40 % and 49 % for Trulicity 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg 
respectively. These effects were sustained through 52 weeks.

The rates of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia with dulaglutide 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 4.5 mg were 
0.07, 0.05 and 0.07 episodes/patient/year respectively. One patient reported severe hypoglycaemia 
with dulaglutide 1.5 mg, no patient with dulaglutide 3 mg, and one patient with dulaglutide 4.5 mg. 
Special populations 
Use in patients with renal impairment 
In a 52 week study, Trulicity 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg were compared to titrated insulin glargine as add-on 
to prandial insulin lispro to evaluate the effect on glycaemic control and safety of patients with 
moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (eGFR [by CKD-EPI] < 60 and ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m2). 
Patients discontinued their pre-study insulin regimen at randomisation. At baseline, overall mean 
eGFR was 38 mL/min/1.73 m2, 30 % of patients had eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
At 26 weeks, both Trulicity 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg were non-inferior to insulin glargine in lowering of 
HbA1c and this effect was sustained at 52 weeks. A similar percentage of patients achieved HbA1c 
targets of < 8.0 % at 26 and 52 weeks with both dulaglutide doses as well as insulin glargine.

Insulin glargine doses were adjusted utilizing an algorithm with a fasting plasma glucose target of 
≤ 8.3 mmol/L 
a  HbA1c value of 8.0 % (DCCT) corresponds to 63.9 mmol/mol (IFCC) (average blood glucose: 
10.1 mmol/L) 
The rates of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia with dulaglutide 1.5 mg and dulaglutide 
0.75 mg, and insulin glargine were 4.44, 4.34, and 9.62 episodes/patient/year, respectively. No 
patients reported cases of severe hypoglycaemia with dulaglutide 1.5 mg, six with dulaglutide 
0.75 mg, and seventeen with insulin glargine. The safety profile of dulaglutide in patients with renal 
impairment was similar to that observed in other studies with dulaglutide. 
Use in the paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg once weekly in children and adolescents 
aged 10 years and above were compared to placebo added to diet and exercise alone, with or without 
metformin and/or basal insulin. The double-blind placebo-controlled period lasted for 26 weeks, after 
which patients assigned to placebo started 26 weeks of open-label treatment with dulaglutide 0.75 mg 
once weekly and patients assigned to dulaglutide continued open-label dulaglutide at their assigned 
dose. At 26 weeks, dulaglutide was superior to placebo treatment in lowering HbA1c.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following subcutaneous administration to patients with type 2 diabetes, dulaglutide reaches peak 
plasma concentrations in 48 hours. The mean peak (Cmax) and total (AUC) exposures were 
approximately 114 ng/ml and 14,000 ngh/ml, respectively, after multiple subcutaneous 1.5 mg doses 
of dulaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes. Steady-state plasma concentrations were achieved 
between 2 to 4 weeks of once-weekly administration of dulaglutide (1.5 mg). Exposures after 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subcutaneous administration of single dulaglutide (1.5 mg) doses in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm 
were comparable. The mean absolute bioavailability of dulaglutide following single-dose 
subcutaneous administration of single 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg doses was 47 % and 65 %, respectively. 
Absolute bioavailabilities for 3 mg and 4.5 mg doses were estimated to be similar to 1.5 mg although 
they have not been specifically studied. Over the dose range 0.75 mg to 4.5 mg, the increase in 
dulaglutide concentration is approximately proportional. 
Distribution 
The apparent population mean central volume of distribution was 3.09 L and the apparent population 
mean peripheral volume of distribution was 5.98 L. 
Biotransformation  
Dulaglutide is presumed to be degraded into its component amino acids by general protein catabolism 
pathways. 
Elimination 
Apparent population mean clearance of dulaglutide was 0.142 L/h. and the elimination half-life was 
approximately 5 days. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Age had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of 
dulaglutide. 
Gender and race 
Gender and race had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of dulaglutide. 
Body weight or body mass index 
Pharmacokinetic analyses have demonstrated a statistically significant inverse relationship between 
body weight or body mass index (BMI) and dulaglutide exposure, although there was no clinically 
relevant impact of weight or BMI on glycaemic control. 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of dulaglutide were evaluated in a clinical pharmacology study and were 
generally similar between healthy subjects and patients with mild to severe renal impairment 
(CrCl < 30 ml/min), including end stage renal disease (requiring dialysis). Additionally, in a 52 week 
clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate to severe renal impairment (eGFR [by 
CKD-EPI] < 60 and ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m2), the pharmacokinetic profile of Trulicity 0.75 mg and 
1.5 mg once weekly was similar to that demonstrated in previous clinical studies. This clinical study 
did not include patients with end stage renal disease. 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of dulaglutide were evaluated in a clinical pharmacology study, where subjects 
with hepatic impairment had statistically significant decreases in dulaglutide exposure of up to 30 % 
to 33 % for mean Cmax and AUC, respectively, compared to healthy controls. There was a general 
increase in tmax of dulaglutide with increased hepatic impairment. However, no trend in dulaglutide 
exposure was observed relative to the degree of hepatic impairment. These effects were not 
considered to be clinically relevant. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg using data 
from 128 paediatric patients (10 to < 18 years of age) with type 2 diabetes. The AUC in paediatric 
patients was approximately 37 % lower than that in adult patients. However, this difference was not 
determined to be clinically meaningful. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology or repeat-dose toxicity. 
In a 6 month carcinogenicity study in transgenic mice, there was no tumorigenic response. In a 2 year 
carcinogenicity study in rats, at ≥ 3 times the human clinical exposure following 4.5 mg dulaglutide 
per week, dulaglutide caused statistically significant, dose-related increases in the incidence of thyroid 
C-cell tumours (adenomas and carcinomas combined). The clinical relevance of these findings is 
currently unknown.  
During the fertility studies, a reduction in the number of corpora lutea and prolonged oestrous cycle 
were observed at dose levels that were associated with decreased food intake and body weight gain in 
maternal animals; however, no effects on indices of fertility and conception or embryonic 
development were observed. In reproductive toxicology studies, skeletal effects and a reduction in 
foetal growth were observed in the rat and rabbit at exposures of dulaglutide 5- to 18-fold higher than 
those proposed clinically, but no foetal malformations were observed. Treatment of rats throughout 
pregnancy and lactation produced memory deficits in female offspring at exposures that were 7-fold 
higher than those proposed clinically. Dulaglutide dosing of male and female juvenile rats did not 
produce memory deficits at 38-fold the highest human exposure.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Trulicity is and what it is used for 
Trulicity contains an active substance called dulaglutide and is used to lower blood sugar (glucose) in 
adults and children aged 10 years and above, with type 2 diabetes mellitus and can help prevent heart 
disease. 
Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that  
your body produces does not work as well as it should.  
When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. 
Trulicity is used: 
- 
- 
on its own if your blood sugar is not properly controlled by diet and exercise alone, and you 
can’t take metformin (another diabetes medicine). 
or with other medicines for diabetes when they are not enough to control your blood sugar 
levels. These other medicines may be medicines taken by mouth and/or insulin given by 
injection. 
It is important to continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise given to you by your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Trulicity 
Do not use Trulicity  
- 
if you are allergic to dulaglutide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Trulicity if: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
you are on dialysis as this medicine is not recommended. 
you have type 1 diabetes (the type when your body does not produce any insulin) as this 
medicine may not be right for you. 
you have diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that occurs when the body is unable 
to break down glucose because there is not enough insulin). The signs include rapid weight 
loss, feeling sick or being sick, a sweet smell to your breath, a sweet or metallic taste in your 
mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat. 
you have severe problems with food digestion or food remaining in your stomach for longer 
than normal (including gastroparesis). 
you have ever had pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) which causes severe pain in the 
stomach and back which does not go away. 
you are taking a sulphonylurea or insulin for your diabetes, as low blood sugar 
(hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may need to change your dose of these other 
medicines to reduce this risk. 
Trulicity is not an insulin and should therefore not be used as a substitute for insulin. 
When initiating treatment with Trulicity, you may in some cases experience loss of 
fluids/dehydration, e.g. in case of vomiting, nausea and/or diarrhoea which may lead to a decrease in 
kidney function. It is important to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids. Contact your doctor 
if you have any questions or concerns. 
Children and adolescents 
Trulicity can be used in children and adolescents aged 10 years and above. Data is not available in 
children below 10 years of age. 
Other medicines and Trulicity 
Because Trulicity can slow stomach emptying which could affect other medicines, tell your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicine. 
Pregnancy  
It is not known if dulaglutide could harm your unborn child. Women who could become pregnant 
should use contraception during treatment with dulagutide. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think 
you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, as Trulicity should not be used during 
pregnancy. Talk to your doctor about the best way to control your blood sugar while you are pregnant. 
Breast-feeding  
Talk to your doctor if you would like to or are breast-feeding before taking this medicine. Do not use 
Trulicity if you are breast-feeding. It is not known if dulaglutide passes into human breast milk. 
Driving and using machines  
Trulicity has no to little effect on the ability to drive or use machines. However, if you use Trulicity in 
combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur which may 
reduce your ability to concentrate. Avoid driving or using machines if you get any signs of low blood 
sugar. See section 2, ‘Warning and precautions’ for information on increased risk of low blood sugar 
and section 4 for the warning signs of low blood sugar. Talk to your doctor for further information. 
Trulicity contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
How to use Trulicity 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure how to use this medicine. 
Adults 
Your doctor may recommend a dose of 0.75 mg once a week for the treatment of your diabetes when 
Trulicity is used alone.  
When used with other medicines for diabetes, your doctor may recommend a dose of 1.5 mg once a 
week.  
If your blood sugar is not controlled well enough, your doctor may increase your dose to 3 mg once a 
week.   
If further blood sugar control is needed the dose may be increased again to 4.5 mg once a week.   
Children and adolescents 
The starting dose for children and adolescents aged 10 years and above is 0.75 mg once a week. If 
your blood sugar is not controlled well enough after at least 4 weeks, your doctor may increase your 
dose to 1.5 mg once a week.  
Each pen contains one weekly dose of Trulicity (0.75 mg, 1.5 mg, 3 mg or 4.5 mg). Each pen delivers 
only one dose.  
You can use your pen at any time of the day, with or without meals. You should use it on the same 
day each week if you can. To help you remember, you may wish to tick the day of the week when you 
inject your first dose on the box that your pen comes in, or on a calendar. 
Trulicity is injected under the skin (subcutaneous injection) of your stomach area (abdomen) or upper 
leg (thigh). If the injection is given by someone else, they may inject in your upper arm. 
If you want to do so, you can use the same area of your body each week. But be sure to choose a 
different injection site within that area. 
It is important that you test your blood glucose levels as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse, if you are taking Trulicity with a sulphonylurea or insulin. 
Read the “Instructions for Use” for the pen carefully before using Trulicity. 
If you use more Trulicity than you should  
If you use more Trulicity than you should talk to your doctor immediately. Too much of this medicine 
may make your blood sugar too low (hypoglycaemia) and can make you feel sick or be sick. 
If you forget to use Trulicity  
If you forget to inject a dose, and if there are at least 3 days before your next dose is due, then inject 
your dose as soon as possible. Inject your next dose on your regular scheduled day. 
If there are less than 3 days before your next dose is due, skip the dose and inject the next one on 
your regular scheduled day. 
Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
You can also change the day of the week on which you inject Trulicity if necessary, as long as it has 
been at least 3 days since your last dose of Trulicity. 
75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you stop using Trulicity  
Do not stop using Trulicity without talking with your doctor. If you stop using Trulicity, your blood 
sugar levels can increase. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Severe side effects  
Rare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people  
- 
Severe allergic reactions (anaphylactic reactions, angioedema).  
You should see a doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as rashes, itching and 
rapid swelling of the tissues of the neck, face, mouth or throat, hives and difficulties breathing. 
- 
Inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis) which could cause severe pain in the stomach and back 
which does not go away.  
You should see a doctor immediately if you experience such symptoms.  
Not known: the frequency cannot be estimated from the available data 
- 
Bowel obstruction - a severe form of constipation with additional symptoms such as stomach 
ache, bloating or vomiting.  
You should see a doctor immediately if you experience such symptoms.  
Other side effects  
Very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people 
- 
Feeling sick (nausea) – this usually goes away over time 
-  Being sick (vomiting) – this usually goes away over time 
-  Diarrhoea – this usually goes away over time 
- 
Stomach (abdominal) pain. 
These side effects are usually not severe. They are most common when first starting dulaglutide but 
decrease over time in most patients. 
- 
- 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common when dulaglutide is used with medicines 
that contain metformin, a sulphonylurea and/or insulin. If you are taking a sulphonylurea or 
insulin, the dose may need to be lowered while you use dulaglutide. 
Symptoms of low blood sugar may include headache, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, feeling 
hungry, confusion, irritability, fast heartbeat and sweating. Your doctor should tell you how to 
treat low blood sugar. 
Common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people

Air bubbles are normal. They will not harm you or affect your dose. 
What if I unlock the pen and press the green injection button before pulling off the base cap? 
Do not remove the base cap and do not use the pen. Dispose of the pen as directed by your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse. Inject your dose using another pen.

84 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This is not necessary, but it may help you keep the pen steady and firm against your skin. 
I heard more than two clicks during my injection - two louder clicks and a soft one. Did I get my 
complete injection? 
Some patients may hear a soft click right before the second loud click. That is the normal operation of 
the pen. Do not remove the pen from your skin until you hear the second louder click. 
What if there is a drop of liquid or blood on my skin after my injection? 
This is not unusual and will not affect your dose. 
I’m not sure my pen worked correctly. 
Check to see if you have received your dose. Your dose was delivered correctly if the grey part is 
visible (see step 3.) Also contact your local Lilly office listed in the Information for the patient for 
further instructions. Until then, store your pen safely to avoid an accidental needle stick injury.

ABOUT TRULICITY PRE-FILLED PEN 
Please read these instructions for use and the information for the patient in the package leaflet 
carefully and completely before using your pre-filled pen. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse about how to inject Trulicity correctly. 
• 
• 
• 
The pen is a disposable, pre-filled delivery device that is ready to use. Each pen contains one 
weekly dose of Trulicity (4.5 mg). Each pen delivers one dose only. 
Trulicity is administered once a week. You may want to mark your calendar to remind you 
when to inject your next dose. 
When you press the green injection button, the pen will automatically insert the needle into 
your skin, inject the medicine, and pull back (retract) the needle after the injection is 
complete.

Do not recycle the filled sharps 
container. 
Ask your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse about how to dispose of 
medicines you no longer use. 
COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS 
What if I see an air bubble in my pen? 
Air bubbles are normal. They will not harm you or affect your dose. 
What if I unlock the pen and press the green injection button before pulling off the base cap? 
Do not remove the base cap and do not use the pen. Dispose of the pen as directed by your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse. Inject your dose using another pen. 
What if there is a drop of liquid on the tip of the needle when I remove the base cap? 
A drop of liquid on the tip of the needle is not unusual and will not affect your dose.

Do I need to hold the injection button down until the injection is complete? 
This is not necessary, but it may help you keep the pen steady and firm against your skin. 
I heard more than two clicks during my injection - two louder clicks and a soft one. Did I get my 
complete injection? 
Some patients may hear a soft click right before the second loud click. That is the normal operation of 
the pen. Do not remove the pen from your skin until you hear the second louder click. 
What if there is a drop of liquid or blood on my skin after my injection? 
This is not unusual and will not affect your dose. 
I’m not sure my pen worked correctly. 
Check to see if you have received your dose. Your dose was delivered correctly if the grey part is 
visible (see step 3.) Also contact your local Lilly office listed in the Information for the patient for 
further instructions. Until then, store your pen safely to avoid an accidental needle stick injury. 
OTHER INFORMATION 
• 
If you have vision problems, DO NOT use your pen without help from a person trained to use 
the Trulicity pen.

Summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  for  eptacog  beta  (activated)  recombinant 
coagulation factor VII 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  Cevenfacta®.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of Cevenfacta®, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Cevenfacta®’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).  
Cevenfacta®'s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Cevenfacta® should be used.  
This summary of the RMP of Cevenfacta® should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
Cevenfacta®'s RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for  
CEVENFACTA is  authorised for adults  and adolescents  (12 years of age and older) for the 
treatment of bleeding episodes and for the prevention of bleeding in those undergoing surgery 
or invasive procedures in the following patient groups:  
• in patients with congenital haemophilia with high-responding inhibitors to coagulation factors 
VIII or IX (i.e., ≥5 Bethesda Units (BU);  
• in patients with congenital haemophilia with low-titer inhibitors (BU <5) but expected to have 
a  high  anamnestic  response  to  factor  VIII  or  factor  IX  administration  or  expected  to  be 
refractory to increased dosing of FVIII or FIX.  
Further information about the evaluation of Cevenfacta®’s benefits can be found in 
Cevenfacta®’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/cevenfacta 
II. 
Risks  associated  with  the  medicine  and  activities  to  minimise  or  further 
characterise the risks 
Important risks of Cevenfacta® together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Cevenfacta® risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
•  Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Cevenfacta®, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In  addition  to  these  measures, information  about adverse reactions is  collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Cevenfacta® is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Cevenfacta® are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Cevenfacta®. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Venous and arterial thromboembolic events have been 
observed  in  clinical  trials  and  post-marketing  setting 
with  medicinal  products  of  the  same  therapeutic  class 
[Novoseven EPAR, Novoseven EU PI]. 
Clinical  experience  with  pharmacologic  use  of  FVIIa-
containing products indicates an elevated risk of serious 
thrombotic  events  when  used  simultaneously  with 
activated prothrombin complex concentrates.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Possible risk factors include: 
•  History  of  atherosclerotic  disease,  coronary 
artery  disease,  cerebrovascular  disease,  crush 
injury, septicaemia, or thromboembolism.

In clinical trials of patients with factor VII deficiency, 
formation  of  antibodies  against  NovoSeven  and  FVII 
has  been 
inhibitory 
reported.  Development  of 
antibodies  to  NovoSeven  has  been  reported  in  a 
post-marketing  observational  registry  of  patients  with 
congenital FVII deficiency [Novoseven EU PI]. 
In  post-marketing  experience,  there  have  been  no 
reports of inhibitory antibodies against NovoSeven or 
FVII in patients with haemophilia A or B [Novoseven 
EU PI]. 
As  no  case  of  neutralizing  antibodies  was  observed 
during  clinical  development  with  eptacog  beta 
(activated), no risk factor could be suggested.

II.C.2 Other studies in post-authorisation development plan 
Collaboration with EUHASS registry: 
•  Background:  EUHASS  is  a  pharmacovigilance  program  to  monitor  the  safety  of 
treatments for people with inherited bleeding disorders in Europe. This is a prospective 
adverse  event  reporting  system  for  patients  with  haemophilia  and  inherited  bleeding 
disorders. Haemophilia treatment centres report adverse events directly to the EUHASS 
website and regular surveillance reports are produced [Makris 2011]. 
•  Objectives: to further characterize the safety profile in patients exposed to eptacog beta 
(activated)  and  to  estimate  the  event  rates  of  the  following  important  risks 
(hypersensitivity  reactions,  thromboembolic  events,  immunogenicity,  and  drug-drug 
interactions with activated or non-activated prothrombin complex or other haemostatic 
agents) including patients with hepatic or renal impairment and elderly patients. 
Collaboration with PedNet registry: 
•  Background:  The  PedNet  Haemophilia  Registry  is  a  multicenter,  observational  birth 
cohort followed in one of the participating haemophilia treatment centres (HTC’s) to 
investigate  natural  history,  safety  and  efficacy  of  replacement  and  non-replacement 
therapies in children and adolescents (12 years of age and older) with haemophilia A 
and B. The PedNet Haemophilia registry study group is an established network in the 
31 haemophilia treatment centres (HTCs) from 18 countries specialized in the treatment 
of children and adolescents (12 years of age and older) with haemophilia. The cohort 
population  concerns  children  and  adolescents  (12  years  of  age  and  older)  with  mild 
(FVIII/IX  6  to  25%),  moderate  (FVIII/IX  1  to  5%)  or  severe  (FVIII/IX<1%) 
haemophilia  A  and  B  born  from  January  1st,  2000,  onwards  followed  in  one  of  the 
participating centres. The PedNet Haemophilia Registry is owned and administered by 
the PedNet  Haemophila           Research  Foundation. As of December 1st,  2016, the 
PedNet  Registry  is  registryed  on  http://ClinicalTrials.gov  (n°  NCT02979119).  The 
PedNet Registry is also registered in the European Union electronic Registry of Post-

for 
•  Objective:  to  generate  information  regarding  the  use  and  the  safety  of  eptacog  beta 
(activated)  in  patients  from  12  years  old  (including  those  with  hepatic  or  renal 
impairment) in the post-authorisation setting. The PedNet Haemophilia registry follows 
the  guideline  for  FVIII/IX  of  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA).  At  baseline 
several variables are collected including data on patient, date of diagnosis, co-morbidity, 
gene mutation, family history of haemophilia and inhibitors. For the first 75 exposure 
days,  date,  reason,  dose,  and  product  are  recorded  for  each  infusion.  For  inhibitor 
patients,  results  of  all  inhibitor-  and  recovery  tests  are  collected.  For  continued 
treatment, data on bleeding, surgery, prophylaxis, and clotting factor consumption are 
collected annually.  Detailed information on haemophilia treatment, suspected adverse 
drug  reactions  and  long-term  outcome  are  collected  in  the  centers  from  diagnosis 
onward. Data entry continues throughout the year by data registrars in the participating 
centers using a web-based Case Report Form (CRF).

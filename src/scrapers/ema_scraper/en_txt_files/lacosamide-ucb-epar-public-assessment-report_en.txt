2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Lacosamide was synthesized as a member of a family of functionalized amino acids, more specifically, analogues 
of the endogenous amino acid and NMDA-receptor modulator D-serine. 
The mechanism of action of lacosamide has to be considered still not fully elucidated. In vitro 
electrophysiological studies have shown that lacosamide selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated 
sodium channels (VGSC), resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal membranes.. 
Lacosamide showed an antiepileptic activity in different rodent seizure models for generalized and complex 
partial-onset seizures and status epilepticus. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Epilepsy which is defined by the recurrence of spontaneous/unprovoked seizures – i.e. seizures not provoked by 
systemic, metabolic or toxic disorders – constitutes a vast ensemble of very diverse clinical situations which 
differ by age of onset, type of seizures, aetiological background, resulting handicap, prognosis and response to 
treatment.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
More than 50 million adults and children are estimated to suffer from epilepsy world-wide. The two highest 
peaks of incidence are in children and in the elderly population (above 65 years). A prevalence estimate of 
epilepsy in the total population varies from 4 to 8 per 10000 subjects.  
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The classification of epileptic seizures is based on clinical manifestation. The 3 main types are generalized, 
partial-onset (which may become secondarily generalized), and unclassified. Partial-onset epilepsies, associated 
with a local cerebral lesion, are the most frequent, representing approximately 60% of cases. Generalized 
epilepsies represent approximately 30% of cases. In the remaining 10% of seizures, the classification is 
uncertain. 
2.1.4.  Management 
Although some forms of epilepsy may benefit from surgical treatment and others may not require any treatment 
at all, most patients with epilepsy require chronic pharmacological therapy. In the past decade, several new 
options for the medical treatment of epilepsy have been introduced, including novel antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) 
and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). The new AEDs differ from older agents in several important ways, including 
mechanism of action, spectrum of activity, and pharmacokinetics. However, more than 30% of patients still 
have inadequate seizure control or experience significant adverse drug effects on currently available AEDs. 
Therefore, there is still a need for AEDs with improved effectiveness and tolerability.

2.2.  About the product 
Lacosamide is a member of a series of functionalized amino acids that were specifically synthesized as 
anticonvulsant drug candidates. The mechanism of action for lacosamide is incompletely known but is thought 
to involve an enhancement of the slow inactivation of sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of 
hyperexcitable physiological neuronal excitability. 
Lacosamide was authorised in 2008 with the indication “Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset 
seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients with epilepsy aged 16 years and older”. The 
approval comprised three different pharmaceutical formulations: 
− 
film-coated tablets containing 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg of lacosamide as active substance, 
−  oral solution containing 15 mg/ml of lacosamide as active substance, 
− 
solution for infusion containing 10 mg/ml of lacosamide as active substance 
The indication has been changed twice. In 2017, lacosamide was approved for monotherapy in the treatment of 
partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients with epilepsy aged 16 years and older, 
and later in the same year a paediatric indication was approved. Since then, the indication is  
Monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary 
generalisation in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy.  
The 15 mg/ml oral solution was withdrawn from the marked in 2011 because of precipitation and in the end of 
2011, 10 mg/ml oral solution was approved. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Lacosamide UCB is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC with 
reference made to Vimpat. 
This informed consent application is a complete true duplicate of Vimpat including the same indication, all 
pharmaceutical forms, strengths and presentations as approved for Vimpat. 
2.3.  Quality aspects 
Lacosamide UCB is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC. 
Reference is made to Vimpat (EU/H/C/000863). The applicant refers to module 3 of Vimpat MA. Therefore, the 
quality data in support of Lacosamide UCB MAA are identical to the up-to-date quality data of Vimpat dossier, 
which have been assessed and authorised by the CHMP. No new quality data have been submitted. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Lacosamide UCB is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC. 
Reference is made to Vimpat (EU/H/C/000863). The applicant refers to module 4 of Vimpat MA. Therefore, the 
non-clinical data in support of Lacosamide UCB MAA are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the 
Vimpat dossier, which have been assessed and authorised by the CHMP. No new non-clinical data have been 
submitted.

2.4.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the applicant, no increase in the population exposed to Lacosamide UCB and Vimpat compared to 
the exposure to Vimpat alone is expected because of generic substitution.  
Further, the applicant concludes that a possible significant increase of the environmental exposure to the drug 
substance, is not expected following the launch of Lacosamide UCB product as a generic to the already approved 
Vimpat, and it is therefore justified not to provide a full ERA with this informed consent application. 
2.5.  Clinical aspects 
Lacosamide UCB is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC. 
Reference is made to Vimpat (EU/H/C/000863) including all indications, pharmaceutical forms, strengths and 
presentations, authorised and granted in the EU. The applicant refers to module 5 of Vimpat MA. Therefore, the 
clinical data in support of Lacosamide UCB MAA are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of Vimpat dossier, 
which have been assessed and authorised by the CHMP. No new clinical data have been submitted. 
2.6.  Risk Management Plan 
The applicant has submitted a common RMP for Vimpat and Lacosamide UCB which was updated as part of the 
informed consent procedure (version 14.0, DLP 30 Nov 2015, signed 12 Mar 2019).

Directive 2001/83/EC amended by Directive 2010/84/EU are available, and that the applicant has the services 
of a qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.8.  Product information 
The proposed PI (separately attached) is identical with the currently approved PI for Vimpat. 
Consultation with target patient groups 
The applicant has submitted the user test for Vimpat syrup and bridging reports for Vimpat solution for infusion, 
film-coated tablets and film-coated tablets titration pack.  A Bridging statement confirming that the content and 
layout are identical to Vimpat has been provided. Lacosamide UCB being an informed consent application and its 
product information being consistent with VIMPAT product information, reference to the last user testing results 
for Vimpat is sufficient.  
Braille 
The applicant has committed to express in Braille the tradename and strength on the printed outer cartons for 
the film-coated tablets and syrup. As the solution for infusion is an intravenous formulation meant to be 
administered by health professionals only, there will be no braille inscription on the carton.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
The current application for Lacosamide UCB is an informed consent application according to article 10(c) of 
Directive 2001/83/EC as amended and Article 82(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 , making reference to the 
original product Vimpat (film-coated tablets, syrup and solution for infusion) for which a marketing authorisation 
was granted in the EU under EMA reference number EMEA/H/C/000863, to the same MAH UCB Pharma S.A, 
since 29 August 2008. 
This informed consent application is a complete true duplicate of Vimpat including the same indication, all 
pharmaceutical forms, strengths and presentations as approved for Vimpat. 
The quality, nonclinical, and clinical data for Lacosamide UCB are identical to Vimpat. No new quality, nonclinical 
or clinical data have been submitted and no new data are needed.  
Overall, the benefit/risk balance of the current procedure is considered favourable. 
4.  Recommendations

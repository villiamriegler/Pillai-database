SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
This  module  reflects  the  initial  scientific  discussion  for  the  approval  of  Foscan.  This  scientific 
discussion has been  updated  until 1 January 2005. For information  on  changes after this  date please 
refer to module 8B. 
1. 
Introduction 
Foscan  contains  temoporfin,  a  photosensitising  agent  that  is  activated  with  non-thermal  light  at  652 
nm four days after intravenous administration. It is an oncolytic, intended for palliative photodynamic 
treatment  of  head  and  neck  squamous  cell  carcinoma  lesions  in  patients  not  curable  with  surgery 
and/or  radiotherapy.  The  therapeutic  effect  is  mediated  through  the  generation  of  reactive  oxygen 
species, a process dependent on the intracellular interaction of temoporfin with light and oxygen.  
2. 
Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Composition 
Foscan  is  a  sterile  non-aqueous  formulation  containing  4-mg/ml  temoporfin  with  ethanol  as  solvent 
and  propylene  glycol  as  co-solvent.  The  proposed  formulation  differs  from  the  formulation  used  for 
the majority of the clinical trials in that it does not contain water, since the development programme 
revealed that water reduces temoporfin stability.  
Two  pack  sizes  are  proposed,  a  3.5  ml  vial  (corresponding  to  14  mg  temoporfin)  and  a  5.0  ml  vial 
(corresponding to 20 mg temoporfin). The primary package for both pack-sizes is a 5-ml amber glass 
vial  sealed  with  a  bromobutyl  rubber  stopper  (West  4023/50/GREY)  with  aluminium  crimp  ring.  A 
secondary container of black plastic provides further protection against light. 
Active substance 
Temoporfin  is  a  photosensitive  agent  indicated  for  the  photodynamic  therapy  of  certain  tumours. 
Temoporfin  is  a  chlorin,  a  group  that  differs  from  the  related  porphyrins  only  in  the  presence  of  a 
centre  of  saturation.  Temoporfin  is  a  single  molecule.  Temoporfin  is  well  characterised  physico-
chemically (pKa-values, partition coefficients, solubility in different solvents). NMR, MS, IR, visible 
and UV spectrum provide evidence of structure. Temoporfin is a dark purple, non-hygroscopic, non-
solvated crystalline powder, which is soluble in alcohol/acetone/ethyl acetate and practically insoluble 
in all aqueous media. Temoporfin exists as a mixture of amorphous and crystalline material with the 
latter being a single crystal form. 
Manufacture of the active substance 
Temoporfin is synthesised from non-complex commercially available materials. Crude temoporfin is 
purified by chromatography. Since the choice of sterilisation of the drug  product is by filtration and 
aseptic  fill,  it  is  essential  to  minimise  the  bioburden  of  the  active  substance.  The  final  steps  are 
therefore  conducted  after  submicron  filtration  of  temoporfin  dissolved  in  ethanol.  No  catalysts  are 
used  in  the  synthesis.  Adequate  specifications  are  given  for  all  starting  materials,  intermediates, 
reagents  and  solvents.  Besides  the  intermediate  specifications,  in-process  control  involves  the 
monitoring of impurities during the third stage and the acceptability of the collected eluate fractions 
before the final stage.  
Active substance specifications 
The  proposed  parameters  and  limits  are  justified.  The  parameters  listed  in  the  active  substance 
specification are standard pharmacopoeial parameters. For all other impurities the proposed limits are 
qualified  and  acceptable.  The  limits  for  residual  solvents  are  in  accordance  or  stricter  than  the  ICH 
guideline Residual solvents. A limit for total viable count is included to confirm the low bioburden.

Stability of the active substance 
Basic solutions of temoporfin are not stable and degrade under exposure to light and heat.  
Other ingredients 
Ethanol, anhydrous and propylene glycol comply with Ph. Eur.  
Finished product 
The product is manufactured by an aseptic process due to the incompatibility of the product with the 
normal  range  of  terminal  sterilisation  methods.  The  HPLC  method  used  for  determining  assay  and 
impurities  was  validated  with  respect  to  precision,  specificity,  sensitivity  linearity,  robustness  and 
accuracy.  The  test  to  determine  particulate  matter  was  validated  in  regard  to  accuracy,  due  to  the 
intensity of the colour of the solution. The gel-clot method is performed in accordance with Ph. Eur. 
The test for lysate sensitivity and absence of interfering factors under test conditions was verified. A 
sterility test is performed by the direct inoculation method according to Ph. Eur. and was validated as 
required. The finished dosage form was subjected to light stress testing and to the formal ICH tests at 
25 oC / 60% RH and 40 oC / 75% RH. The data showed no difference in stability between the two fill 
volumes.  Photostability  data  conducted  according  to  CPMP/ICH  guidelines  confirmed  that  amber 
coloured glass gives some but insufficient protection to the product. In view of the light sensitivity of 
the  product,  it  has  to  be  stored  in  a  light  opaque  secondary  container  appropriately  labelled.  A 
secondary container of black plastic is proposed, providing further protection against light. A shelf life 
of 2 years ≤ 25 oC when stored in the secondary container is acceptable. 
Both  glass  and  elastomer  of  the  packaging  material  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  Compatibility  studies 
confirm  that  the  stopper  complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  requirements  for  extractables.  The  level  of 
extractables  was  performed  using  USP  extraction  test  with  isopropyl  alcohol.  The  results  show  that 
stopper residues with vehicle extraction are below that of Ph. Eur. limits for closures.

Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
The anti-tumour activity of temoporfin depends on photo-activation with light of 652 nm from a laser. 
The molecular basis for photodynamic therapy is well understood. The therapeutic effect is mediated 
through the generation of reactive oxygen species, a process dependent on the intracellular interaction 
of temoporfin with light and oxygen. Light of 652nm can penetrate tissues to produce meaningful PDT 
activity at depths of 10-15mm and beyond when the impact of the associated cascade of biological and 
biochemical events are considered. This implies that Foscan can be used effectively to treat tumours to 
a depth of 10-15mm from the illuminated surface. For the clinical studies, the dose 0.15 mg/kg  was 
chosen. Intravenous  doses in the range of 0.1-0.6 mg temoporfin/kg  body weight produced effective 
tumour necrosis in animal models whilst minimising damage to surrounding normal tissues, provided 
that  the  light  dose  was  given  between  72-120  hours  after  administration  of  temoporfin.  Under  these 
conditions, a wavelength of 652 nm, a fluence rate in the range of 50-200 W x cm-2, typically 100 W x 
cm-2 and light doses between 10-20 J x cm-2 are appropriate. 
Safety studies with the complete final formulation are lacking. 
A moderate decrease in pain response at a single dose of 0.5 mg/kg was observed in the mouse Irwin 
test. Intravenous administration of the vehicle caused transient subdued behaviour in rabbits and was 
lethal in two animals when the administration rate was 0.5 or 1.0 ml/minute.  
In  dogs,  administration  of  the  vehicle  increased  arterial  blood  pressure  and  showed  fluctuations  in 
heart rate and respiratory rate. Two dogs died at 12 ml/minute (24 times the recommended dose rate). 
The safety of the vehicle as regards respiratory function was satisfactory. In the rat, there was no effect 
on  cardiovascular  or  respiratory  parameters  when  administering  double  the  clinical  dose  and  double 
the  clinical  infusion  rate.  The  administration  regimen,  both  in  dogs  and  in  rabbits,  was  the 
2/19 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
predominant factor determining the seriousness of the effects. In rabbits, a dose rate of 0.4 ml/minute 
was  tolerated.  In  dogs  0.25  ml/kg  over  3  minutes  was  best  tolerated.  In  rats,  no  adverse  effects  of 
temoporfin administration on renal or gastrointestinal function were observed. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics  after  single  intravenous  dosing  of  14C-temoporfin  was  studied  in  mice,  rats,  dogs 
and  tumour  bearing  rats.  Data  on  pharmacokinetics  after  single  intravenous  administration  of 
unlabelled temoporfin were obtained from toxicokinetic studies in rats, dogs and rabbits performed as 
part  of  the  toxicity  studies,  performed  under  controlled  lighting  conditions.  A  delay  in  tmax  was 
observed,  which  is  atypical  for  an  intravenously  administered  drug,  which  might  indicate  a  depot 
formation  in  tissues  followed  by  a  slow  release  into  the  systemic  circulation.  The  results  from  the 
pharmacokinetic studies with multiple dosing in rats and dogs showed accumulation of temoporfin in 
plasma over the dosing period with accumulation ratios of 1.5-2.5 in the 28-day study in rats and 2.4 
in the 28-day study with dogs. These ratios are indicative for long elimination half-lives.  
Temoporfin exhibited an extensive distribution pattern in the rat, particularly in the liver and also in 
adrenals, spleen, lungs and bone marrow. No measurable binding of 14C-radioactivity to melanin in 
pigmented rat eyes or skin could be demonstrated. Release of the drug from the tissues was prolonged, 
with elimination  half-lives in tissues of rat of 16  h, 137 h, 210 h, 227 h, 295  h, 369 h and  489  h in 
plasma, lung, liver, adrenal, kidney, spleen and muscle, respectively. Several studies in mice and rats 
showed distribution of temoporfin in tumour tissue. Tumour: tissue ratios were high in skeletal muscle 
and  skin.  Protein  binding  in  mouse,  rat,  rabbit  and  dog  were  similar,  ranging  from  approx.  99%.  In 
humans  protein  binding  was  lower  (approx.  86%).  In  vitro  studies  with  rat  and  human  liver 
microsomal  preparations  did  not 
temoporfin.  The 
excretion/metabolic patterns are very similar in the rat, the rabbit and the dog. Plasma radioactivity up 
to at least 24 h post-dose was solely associated with the parent compound. Photobleaching, leading to 
a stable photoproduct of temoporfin appeared an important mechanism to reduce skin levels. 
indicate  oxidative  metabolism  of 
An  in-vitro  study  with  human  liver  tissue  did  not  indicate  potential  for  drug  interaction  through 
inhibition of cytochrome P-450 iso-enzymes. 
Excretion data in rats and dogs demonstrated that temoporfin is predominantly excreted via the faeces 
(approx.  70%  of  the  recovered  dose).  The  majority  of  the  dose  was  excreted  within  21  days  after 
dosing,  but  significant  amounts  (up  to  18%)  remained  in  the  carcass.  Mass  balance  studies  revealed 
long  elimination  half-lives  of  about  250  h  (rats).  There  were  no  indications  for  enterohepatic 
recirculation.  
Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single  dose  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  by  the  intravenous  route  in  mice  and  rats  under  normal 
(∼300/343 lux) and subdued (∼0/14 lux) light conditions. Animals exposed to normal light conditions 
showed phototoxicity like swelling and darkening of the skin in exposed areas (tail, abdomen, scrotal 
sac,  ears,  eyes  and  feet).  The  effects  occurred  at  dose  levels  >  0.85  mg/kg.  Systemic  toxicity  was 
characterised  by  changes  in  haematological  parameters  (red  blood  cells,  haematocrit  and  platelets 
reduced  and  white  blood  cells  increased)  and  increased  liver  and  spleen  weights.  Furthermore,  skin 
inflammation, pycnotic spermatocytes and increased extramedullary haematopoiesis in spleen and the 
lymph nodes were found. Under subdued light, a low degree of phototoxicity was found only in the 
highest dose group. Rats appeared more sensitive than mice.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Studies of 1-4 weeks duration were conducted in rats and dogs. Rats treated intravenously for 7 days 
with  temoporfin  showed  severe  phototoxicity  up  to  1  mg/kg/day  under  normal  light  conditions  and 
less  severe  phototoxicity  under  subdued  light  conditions.  Two  weeks  intravenous  administration  of 
doses of 0.05-0.6 mg temoporfin/kg/day to rats caused inflammatory changes at the injection sites and 
3/19 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
swelling/reddening of the tail or ears at 0.3 mg/kg and higher. Rats treated daily intravenously with 0.3 
-  1  mg/kg  temoporfin  for  4  weeks  under  subdued  lighting,  showed  only  an  increase  of  white  blood 
cells at the highest dose level. No signs of phototoxicity were found. In the 2 and 4 weeks studies, rats 
received a maximum dose of up to 1 mg/kg/day. . 
Dogs received doses up to 3 mg/kg/day under subdued light conditions, which provided substantially 
higher systemic exposure compared to rats. Intravenous administration of temoporfin to Beagle dogs 
for 14 consecutive days caused dose-dependent inflammation at the injection sites at all doses (0.03 –
0.75 mg/kg/day). A reduction in food consumption was also seen at highest doses. Reddening of the 
ears, limbs or abdomen, and increased pigmentation in limbs/ears were indicative of phototoxicity of 
the test drug. In a 4 weeks study in dogs under subdued light conditions severe phototoxic effects were 
seen. In  males, phototoxicity was observed in the pinnae and the prepuce and in females in the area 
around the vulva, anus, and abdomen. Serious injection site damage was found.  
Genotoxicity 
Temoporfin did not cause mutations in the Ames test in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 1535, TA 
1537, TA 98, TA 100 and in Escherichia coli WP2uvrA under various light conditions. Furthermore, it 
did not induce chromosome aberrations or mutations in Chinese hamster ovary cells, or micronuclei in 
the  mouse  in  vivo.  Mutagenic  activity  with  temoporfin  was  observed  in  vitro  at  temoporfin 
concentrations  of  6-16  µg/ml  in  a  mouse  lymphoma  cell  gene  mutation  test.  Under  light  exposure, 
temoporfin  results  in  the  production  of  reactive  oxygen  species.  Hence,  under  these  conditions 
temoporfin may have the potential to be mutagenic. In the clinical situation, the risk may be minimised 
by  avoiding  direct  exposure  of  non-tumour  tissue  to  light,  and  by  maintaining  patients  under  the 
recommended light protection programme. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies were not performed, which is acceptable considering the intended clinical use.  
Reproduction toxicity 
The effects of temoporfin up to 0.6 mg/kg/day on early embryonic development were investigated in 
the  rat.  No  obvious  signs  of  maternal  or  embryo-foetal  toxicity  were  observed  (NOAEL  0.6 
mg/kg/day).  In  rabbits,  slight  maternal  toxicity  was  apparent  at  the  high  dose  as  characterised  by 
reduced food consumption and reduced body weight gain. In the high dose group, an increase in pre-
implantation  loss  and  a  lower  pregnancy  rate  was  recorded,  and  a  decrease  in  ossification  of  the 
occipital  skull  was  observed.  Maternal  and  developmental  NOAEL  during  the  organogenesis  period 
was  0.3  mg/kg/day  in  rabbits.  The  effects  of  temoporfin  on  pre-  and  postnatal  development  were 
investigated in rats. No significant effects were observed that could be related to treatment either in F0 
or F1 generation. Maternal, pre-, and post-natal NOAEL was 0.6 mg/kg/day, which does not provide 
any safety margin compared to the human dose.  
Local tolerance 
The local tolerance studies in animals are relevant only with respect to the local irritant effects of the 
solvent. A slight reversible irritancy to rabbit skin was observed. Slight reversible conjunctival redness 
was  seen  when  temoporfin  was  applied  to  rabbit  eyes.  Intravenous  injection  of  temoporfin  solution 
caused slight to severe erythema, the severity depending on the vehicle used and the amount injected. 
Propylene  glycol/ethanol  at  the  lowest  dose  tested  being  slightly  less  than  the  clinical  dose,  caused 
erythema  at  the  injection  site,  as  well  as  subdued  behaviour  on  the  injection  day.  The  irritation 
appeared  to  be  somewhat  aggravated  when  temoporfin  in  solution  was  injected  as  compared  to 
injection of vehicle only. Paravenous and intra-arterial injection caused severe erythema, oedema, and 
mild to moderate subcutaneous inflammation and haemorrhage.  
Ecotoxicity/Environmental Risk Assessment 
No adverse effects on the environment of the use of temoporfin and its dispersion into the environment 
are anticipated.

Clinical aspects 
Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamics 
Formal dose finding studies and studies in humans to determine a precise mechanism of action were 
not  conducted.  A  phase  I  programme  consisting  of  a  series  of  open  uncontrolled  investigator 
sponsored pilot studies in a variety of cancers and other diseases provided the basis for the drug and 
light dose selected for the Phase II studies. A dose/response relationship has been demonstrated for the 
dose  interval  0.075-0.3  mg/kg  with  a  dose  of  0.15  mg/kg  found  to  be  effective  with  acceptable  and 
manageable skin photosensitivity early in the development programme. The recommended light dose 
20 J/cm2 following a drug light interval of 96 hours was required for complete remission of Tis to T4 
tumours. Data to demonstrate that the depth of necrosis achieved with the proposed dose, light-dose 
and drug-light interval at least covers the depth of the tumour was not provided.   
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of temoporfin after i.v. injection was evaluated in two pharmacokinetic studies 
in healthy volunteers and in patients undergoing photodynamic therapy (Table 1). The main difference 
between  the  two  studies  was  the  solvent  used  for  injection.  Additionally,  five  literature  references 
were included concerning pharmacokinetics in faze I trials in patients.  
Distribution 
After  intravenous  injection  of  a  single  dose  of  0.15  mg/kg,  the  plasma  concentration  of  temoporfin 
decreases rapidly. Then after approximately 45 min  an increase is observed lasting until Cmax (about 
900-1000ng/ml) is reached after 4 - 8 h, after which the concentration follows a slow bi-exponential 
decay with a t½ of the initial phase of about 30 hours. The delayed tmax was observed both in patients 
and in healthy volunteers. Such a delay in tmax is atypical for an intravenously administered drug and 
indicates a delay in full distribution of the dose into the systemic circulation. Plasma clearance values 
are  low  (about  4  ml/h/kg)  demonstrating  that  temoporfin  is  a  low  clearance  drug  in  man.  The 
distribution volume is about 0.5 l/kg, which is between total and extra cellular body water. Temoporfin 
distributes  beyond  the  blood  compartment  and  exhibits  a  reasonably  extensive  distribution  in  man. 
Preclinical  data  showed  that  several  tissues  are  involved  in  the  uptake  of  temoporfin.  The  tissues 
involved in the uptake of temoporfin in humans have not been investigated. Published data show that 
temoporfin preferentially concentrates in tumour tissue relative to other tissues. Mean plasma-protein 
binding ranges around 85-88%.

Metabolism and excretion  
The metabolic profile was not identified in humans. Elimination in healthy volunteers is slow. Plasma 
concentrations decay in a bi-exponential manner with t½ of the initial phase of about 30 hours and a 
terminal half-life of about 90 hours. A linear relationship between temoporfin systemic clearance and 
5/19 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
body  weight  in  animals  and  humans  indicates  that  total  clearance  in  animals  is  predictive  of  that  in 
humans.  According  to  the  preclinical  studies,  temoporfin  is  metabolised  in  the  liver  by  conjugation 
and  eliminated  in  the  bile  for  excretion  in  faeces.  Genetic  polymorphism  and  active  metabolites  are 
therefore not of concern and enzyme induction is not an issue with a single treatment modality. 
Interaction studies 
The  effect  of  Foscan  on  the  cytochrome  P450  isoenzymes  2D6  and  3A4  was  evaluated  in  healthy 
volunteers.  A  tendency  to  a  reduction  in  activity  for  both  isoenzymes  was  observed,  however,  no 
conclusive statements could be made due to a large variation. In the clinical studies with temoporfin, a 
large  number  of  concomitant  medications  were  used  including  dexamethasone,  diclofenac, 
metronidazole,  tramadol,  morphine,  paracetamol,  codeine,  fentanyl,  and  diazepam  among  the  most 
frequently  used.  This  range  includes  substrates  for  CYP’s  3A4,  2C9,  2D6,  and  2C19,  and  the 
glucuronyl transferases. None of the reported adverse events in these studies were attributed to use of 
concomitant  medications,  with  the  exception  of  one  incident  with  topical  5-fluorouracil  where  an 
adverse  event arose due to  the combined  photosensitivity  effects  of this  agent  with temoporfin.  It is 
concluded that special warnings regarding potential drug interactions of this nature are not required in 
the SPC, but a warning is included for topical 5-fluorouracil. 
Special populations 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted on 228 patients with head and neck cancer from 
four studies. These patients were given a single intravenous infusion of 0.15 mg/kg of the Powder for 
Injection  formulation.  The  estimated  clearance  and  volume  of  distribution  values  were  in  good 
agreement  with  those  quoted  previously.  The  analysis  evaluated  any  correlated  differences  in 
pharmacokinetics  with  a  range  of  discrete  covariates  including  age,  weight,  gender,  ethnicity,  and

of clinically significant differences in the adverse event profile in special groups, with the exception of

Clinical efficacy 
Main clinical studies 
The  main  characteristics  of  the  four  pivotal  studies  are  summarised  in  Table  2.  The  studies 
investigated  efficacy  in  3  different  populations.  Study  01  concerned  primary  oral  or  pharyngeal 
cancer,  studies  03  and  08  primary  second  or  recurrent  oral  or  pharyngeal  cancer  and  the  study  08b 
palliative  treatment.  These  original  three  indications  were  later  amended  to  one  proposing  Foscan-
PDT for palliative therapy of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma lesions in patients not curable 
with  surgery  or  radiotherapy.  Thus,  the  study  08b  remained  the  only  relevant  study  for  clinical 
efficacy.  
The  primary  efficacy  parameter  in  the  studies  01,  03,  and  08  was  histologically  confirmed  tumour 
response  after  both  8  and  12  weeks  or  in  case  of  slough  after  both  12  and  16  weeks.  The  primary 
efficacy parameter in the study 08b was clinical benefit. All studies included a short-term phase (12/16 
weeks) and a long-term follow up phase.   
Study 01 
This open, uncontrolled, phase II study, was designed to recruit patients with untreated single discrete 
tumours, easily measured and locally treatable (TisN0, T1N0, T2N0), with a tumour diameter ≤ 2.5 cm 
and estimated depth ≤ 0.5 cm, without metastases and not scheduled for neck dissection in continuity, 
or for neck irradiation. Karnofsky performance status was at least 70%.

Efficacy analysis 
Primary efficacy parameter was histologically confirmed tumour complete response to be measured 12 
weeks  after  illumination  with  response  assessment  limited  to  patients  with  a  technically  successful 
PDT-procedure.  
Efficacy results 
A  total  of  108  patients  were  included,  all  of  who  received  Foscan  The  median  duration  of  response 
could  not  be  calculated  since  loss  of  local  control  occurred  in  less  than  50%  of  the  patients.  The 
estimated CR rate at one year is 82% (95% CI: 72%-92%) and at 2 years 75% (95% CI: 63%-88%). 
Histological response was established in 67 patients with a biopsy, with 55 (82%) patients having no 
evidence  of  tumour  and  12  patients  with  evidence  of  tumour.  Seventy-two  of  the  81  patients  with 
clinical  CR  were  entered  into  the  follow-up  study  02,  however,  no  valid  conclusion  with  regard  to 
survival or loss of control can be drawn from the long-term data.

Studies 03 and 08 
Studies 03 and 08 concerned patients with recurrent or second primary squamous cell carcinoma of the lip, 
oral cavity, or anterior two-thirds of the tongue, that were previously treated with radiotherapy or surgery for 
lesions without nodal or distant metastases (N0M0). Karnofsky performance status was at least 70%. Patients 
could receive a maximum of three treatments with Foscan.  
Efficacy results 
A total of 41 patients were included in the study 03, of whom 40 received Foscan, and a total of 40 patients 
were  included  in  the  study  08,  all  of  whom  received  Foscan.  Efficacy  analysis  was  restricted  to  the  per 
protocol  population  in  both  studies.  Seventeen  patients  were  assessable  for  tumour  response  in  study  03. 
Nine patients (53%) had a complete response. The overall response rate was 59%. Twelve patients entered 
the long term follow up phase of whom nine had a clinical complete response. Duration of response ranged 
from 61-452 days. 
Twenty-eight  patients  with  a  total  of  30  lesions  were  assessable  for  response  in  study  08.  There  was  a 
histologically confirmed response rate by lesion of 53% in the per protocol population. The overall complete 
response rate by lesion was 63% and the overall response rate by lesion 73%. Seventeen patients entered the 
follow up phase, and at the cut off point, no patients had reached the one-year assessment point. Duration of 
response ranged from 55-625 days. Three patients with biopsy confirmed complete response had recurrences 
with a median time to recurrence of 171 days. Mean survival times were 570 days (range 35-551days) for 
study 03, and 520 days (range 12-680 days) for study 08. No valid conclusions with regard to survival or 
loss of control can be drawn from the long-term data.  
Karnofsky  performance  index  was  scored  at  baseline  and  at  week  12/16  in  both  studies.  Taken  together, 
Karnofsky performance index did not differ between baseline and at the end of the short-term phase. 
Study 08b 
This was a multicentre study conducted in India (72 patients), Europe (53 patients), USA (17 patients) and 
Egypt (5 patients). The sites of the primary tumours were buccal mucosa, tongue, floor of the mouth, larynx 
and  tonsil.  The  primary  endpoint  of  the  open  label,  single  group,  single  and  multiple  dose  study  was  the 
individual  clinical  benefit  gained  from  palliative  treatment  with  Foscan-PDT  in  the  management  of 
recurrent, refractory or second primary neck and head squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) in patients for whom 
surgery  or  radiotherapy  was  considered  inappropriate  and  in  whom  palliation  of  a  specific  disease  related 
problem were possible. The tumour response was a secondary endpoint. 
Efficacy analysis 
The  primary  efficacy  parameter  was  the  change  in  a  prospectively  defined  key  symptom  (pain,  eating 
including  swallowing  and  chewing,  disfigurement,  and  speech),  to  be  measured  with  the  University  of 
Washington Head & Neck Questionnaire (UWHNQ), or prevention of a complication of advanced HNSCC 
(objective  response).  Objective  improvement  was  defined  as  normalisation  or  improvement  of  at  least  2 
grades in the severity assessment of the key symptom or prevention of an expected complication (prevention 
of perforation of a fistula, fungation, disintegration of tracheostomy). Secondary efficacy parameters were 
improvement in global, functional and symptomatic measures of QoL, objective tumour response (complete 
and  partial),  one-year  survival  rate,  Karnofsky  Performance  Index,  and  tolerability  and  safety.  The  study 
period for short-term efficacy consisted of 12/16 weeks. After completed treatment, all patients were to be 
followed-up for 1 year for duration of palliative benefit, tumour response and survival.  
Previous surgical and radiotherapy treatments received by patients in Indian and EU/US centres are shown 
in Table 3.

Efficacy results  
A total of 220 patients were enrolled, of which 196 were treated with Foscan. At the time of database cut-off 
49  patients  were  still  on  study,  but  had  not  completed  the  12/16-week  treatment  observation  phase.  The 
12/16  weeks  data  as  considered  for  the  ITT  analysis  included  194  treatments  in  147  patients.  The  patient 
population  was  divided  into  128  patients  in  whom  the  primary  aim  was  tumour  shrinkage  and  symptom 
reduction and 19 patients in whom the aim was prevention of a complication. 
Symptomatic benefit was assessed using the following key items from the UWQOL questionnaire:  
• 
Pain (0 – 4, none – severe pain not controlled by medication) 
Eating-Swallowing (0 – 3, no problem – I cannot swallow) 
Eating-Chewing (0 - 2, no problem – I cannot even chew soft solids) 
Disfigurement (0 – 4, no problems – I cannot be with people due to my appearance) 
Speech (0 – 4, no problem – I cannot be understood) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Symptomatic  response  was  defined  by  at  least  a  two-grade  reduction,  or  normalisation  of  a  prospectively 
defined  symptom  as  scored  by  the  patient.  Altogether  28/128  of  the  patients  fulfilled  these  criteria.  Fifty 
percent  of  these  patients  reported  normalisation  or  a  two-grade  reduction  of  any  of  the  five  UWQOL 
symptom scores. Duration of protocol defined symptomatic response was calculated from the visit at which 
response was first noted to the last visit at which response was recorded and was found to have a mean 44 
days and a median of 21 days.   
Tumour  response  was  observed  in  overall  37/147  (25%)  of  the  patients  after  the  first  treatment  course.

In  the  appeal  documentation,  further  analyses  were  conducted  aiming  at  identifying  baseline  factors  of 
importance  for  tumour  response.    These  analyses  focused  on  patients  treated  with  the  aim  of  symptom 
reduction (n=128). This approach does not inflate response data as there were 4 CR in the group of patients 
(n=19) excluded from further analysis. 
Twenty-five  patients  died  and  8  patients  were  withdrawn  prior  to  the  first  assessment  of  tumour  response 
and  altogether  tumour  mass  reduction  measurements  are  missing  for  36/128  patients.  In  a  total  of  102 
lesions, at least one response assessment was available allowing an analysis relating tumour mass reduction 
to tumour depth (Table 5).

Although  the  data  presented  in  Table  5  may  derive  from  only  one  tumour  mass  assessment  and  they  are 
presented  per  lesion,  it  appears  reasonable  to  conclude  that  tumour  depth  is  of  importance  for  tumour 
response. 
Completeness of illumination was determined by using the surface area of each lesion and the illumination 
spot  diameter.  If  the  illumination  spot  area  was  greater  or  equal  to  the  tumour  area,  illumination  was 
categorised as complete. Of the 128 patients treated for palliation, 95 patients with 112 lesions were judged 
to have received complete illumination (Table 6).

These  results  should  be  interpreted  with  caution,  as  large  tumours  are  more  likely  to  be  incompletely 
illuminated than small tumours. This may be illustrated by the fact that 7/19 tumours with a depth >20 mm 
(5/7 ≥30 mm) were incompletely illuminated vs. 13/83 with a depth ≤ 20 mm.   
The  appeal  documentation  included  also  the  results  for  all  patients  with  a  tumour  depth  ≤  10  mm  and 
completely  illuminated,  non-externalising  lesions  (“optimal  patients”).  There  were  altogether  43  patients 
fulfilling these criteria and the overall response rate (WHO) was 40% (10 CR, 17 PR).   
The assessment of duration of tumour response was not a primary endpoint of the protocol. Due to loss of 
patients from the study (mainly through death) and to tumour necrosis, sloughing and healing, the duration 
of  response  was  difficult  to  estimate.  Duration  was  calculated  from  the  visit  at  which  response  was  first 
recorded  to  the  last  visit  at  which  response  was  noted.  Mean  duration  (SD)  of  overall  response  was  108 
(107) days and for patients obtaining complete response 145 (145) days. 
Clinical safety 
Patient exposure  
The  safety  population  consisted  of  855  persons  (811  patients,  44  volunteers)  with  1064  treatments.  These 
included data from the Integrated Safety Population from the four submitted studies in head and neck cancer 
(ISP,  n=314),  an  additional  phase  II  study  06  in  patients  with  superficial  epidermoid  carcinoma  of  the 
oesophagus,  oral  cavity,  pharynx,  larynx,  trachea  and  bronchi  (n=47),  as  well  as  an  extensive  Expanded 
Access  Programme  which  allowed  named-patient  treatment  with  Foscan-PDT  over  a  wide  range  of 
malignant and other conditions (n=450), and in human volunteers (n=44). During the assessment procedure, 
the  Applicant  submitted  an  update  on  study  08b,  thereby  extending  the  number  of  patients  from  64 
(efficacy)/99  (safety)  to  147  patients.  The  assessment  of  clinical  safety  was  based  on  the  originally 
submitted data. 
Adverse events and serious adverse events/deaths 
Table 7 summarises the adverse events in the ISP (consisting of all four pivotal studies) and study 08b. The 
majority (79%) of adverse events in the ISP were at least possibly related to treatment. The differences in 
incidences between study 08b and the IPS population showed that most adverse events were reflecting the 
site and stage of the disease. The most common adverse events in the IPS population were facial pain, pain 
and mouth necrosis. The most common adverse events in study 08b were injection site pain, haemorrhage 
and dysphagia. After exclusion of injection site pain, the vast majority of adverse events occurred during or 
after the illumination. Besides pain in the face, the adverse events were mild to moderate. Pain in the face 
was  associated  with  treatment  of  the  tumour.  All  patients  who  receive  Foscan  will  become  temporarily 
photosensitive  and  must  observe  precautions  to  avoid  sunlight  and  bright  indoor  light.  Most  toxicity 
associated with this therapy are transient local effects seen in the region of illumination and occasionally in 
surrounding  tissues.  There  is  transient  neutrocytosis  due  to  the  tumour  necrosis  and  acute  inflammatory 
13/19
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
response,  and  a  clinically  insignificant  drop  in  haemoglobin  concentration  has  been  observed  which  may 
persist for 3 months. 
Phototoxicity 
All  patients  who  receive  Foscan  will  become  temporarily  photosensitive  and  must  observe  precautions  to 
avoid sunlight and bright indoor light. Most toxicities associated with this therapy are local effects seen in 
the region of illumination and occasionally in surrounding tissues. In the global safety database, the pattern 
of photosensitivity reactions shows  a maximal incidence around the day of illumination. Fifty-seven  % of 
photosensitivity events were reported in the first 15 days, 11% in the following week, and 13% in the week 
thereafter. In 170 patients, 176 photosensitivity adverse events were reported, including 19 severe reactions. 
The overall incidence of serious phototoxicity is 1.6%. Special attention is paid to the phototoxicity events 
in a phase I study in volunteers. All volunteers in this study (n=14) experienced a photosensitivity reaction 
with 7 classified as serious adverse event. Most events occurred on or after day 15. The cause of events in 
the study was investigated thoroughly and was almost certainly related by insufficient compliance with the 
light avoidance instructions and procedures and not to the formulation. Precautionary measures in the event 
of suspected extravasation of Foscan are included in the SPC, which should minimise or prevent localised 
phototoxicity.  
Laboratory findings 
The most common adverse event was transient increase in white blood cell count observed during the first 
1-2  weeks  after  treatment.  This  was  expected  due  to  the  tissue  necrosis  induced  by  the  treatment.  This 
adverse event was of no clinical significance. In study 01 and 03 an elevation in platelet count was noted 
although of no clinical significance. A mean fall in haemoglobin of 0.5 g/dl, enduring for the entire follow-
up  and  also  occurring  in  volunteers  (who  received  Foscan,  but  no  PDT),  was  very  modest  in  almost  all 
patients. Moreover, serum creatinine and urea rose appreciably (respectively 18 and 20%) which was likely 
to be a consequence of dehydration due to oral discomfort. 
Cardiovascular effects  
These  were  limited  to  a  few  patients  with  hypo-  or  hypertension  of  moderate  severity  or  negative  re-
challenge.

Local effects 
Injection site reactions occurred frequently but were insignificant as long as no extravasation occurred. 
One  patient  developed  post-inflammatory  hyperpigmentation.  The  local  adverse  reactions  probably 
represent an acute tissue inflammatory response induced by photo-activation. There may be transient 
pain during injection, which can be reduced by slowing the infusion rate. There  may be pain due to 
tumour  necrosis,  which  may  require  the  use  of  NSAIDs  or  other  oral  analgesics  for  2-3  weeks 
following treatment. 
Table  8  summarises  the  deaths  and  non-fatal  serious  adverse  events  in  the  global  safety  population. 
One originally treatment-attributed death (carotid artery blow-out) in study 08b was reviewed by the 
Palliative  Assessment  Panel,  who  considered  the  death  as  unlikely  attributable  to  treatment.  The 
remaining treatment-attributed death concerns  a cardiovascular  accident as  a consequence  of sudden 
haemorrhage  from  the  right  carotid  artery.  The  other  4  deaths  were  not  related  to  the  currently 
requested  indication,  or  not  treated  in  accordance  with  the  currently  proposed  parameters.  In  total, 
there were 229 non-fatal serious adverse events reported in 172 Foscan-PDT treated patients from all 
studies in the global safety database. Of these, 71 events were considered as attributable to treatment, 
occurring in 63 patients. Treatment related deaths were very rare (<1%).  
Safety in special populations 
Analyses by demographic sub-populations (age, sex, race, weight, hepatic function, renal function) did 
not  reveal  any  influence  on  the  incidence  of  adverse  events,  with  the  exception  of  pain  in  the  face, 
which occurred more frequently in white patients compared to Asian patients.

Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment 
Quality 
The  quality  of  the  product  is  considered  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the  conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. An in-line 
filtration  should  be  obligatory  during  administration  of  Foscan  and  an  in-line  filter  set-up  assembly 
included  in  the  package,  since  visual  checks  for  particulates  are  not  possible.  Moreover,  the 
administration set to be used for the administration of Foscan should be compatible with the vehicle of 
the product due to the non-aqueous solvents (ethanol, propylene glycol) present.  
Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Overall,  the  primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  indicate  that  by  controlling  light  dose,  light 
wavelength, time interval to light exposure as well as drug dose, the appropriate anti-tumour activity is 
obtained.  There  is  some  uncertainty  as  to  the  safety  pharmacology  of  the  complete  formulation  of 
Foscan  at  dose  volumes  and  rates  above  the  clinically  recommended  volume  and  rate,  since  the 
applied  doses  were  not  in  excess  of  the  human  therapeutic  dose  to  provide  an  adequate  margin  of 
safety. There is also an ambiguity as to whether relevant human metabolites are toxicologically tested 
in the animal  models. The toxicology programme revealed that temoporfin, due to the generation of 
reactive  oxygen  species,  poses  a  minor  risk  of  mutagenicity,  which  should  be  acceptable  due  to  the 
restricted  nature  of  the  target  population.  Local  tolerance  studies  showed  that  the  proposed 
formulation  of  Foscan  was  irritating.  A  slow  rate  of  administration  and  special  care  to  prevent 
extravasation is of great importance. 
Efficacy 
Studies  01,  03  and  08  were  not  considered  adequately  designed  to  support  the  broad  indication 
initially applied for “ … treatment of primary, second primary, recurrent or refractory squamous cell 
carcinoma..”.  The  indication  was  therefore  restricted  at  this  stage  to  patients  with  advanced  disease. 
Due to concerns related to methodology and patient benefit, Foscan was initially not recommended for

licensing. Based on new analyses provided in the appeal procedure, these issues have been reassessed 
by the CPMP and at an expert group meeting.  
The  pivotal  study  (08b)  designed  to  support  the  indication  “palliative  treatment  of  patients  with 
advanced  head  and  neck  squamous  cell  carcinoma  failing  prior  therapies  and  unsuitable  for 
radiotherapy, surgery or chemotherapy” was a non-comparative study. Data to support this indication 
should, however, ideally derive from a randomised, best supportive care comparative study. This was 
discussed  during  the  expert  meetings  and  the  proposed  controlled  study  by  EORTC  to  was  not 
considered feasible due to insufficient inclusion of patients. A chemotherapy-comparative, superiority 
study was also discussed as a possible alternative. Due to difference in side effects and therefore likely 
difference  in  target  populations  in  clinical  practice  and  the  problems  seen  in  general  when  very 
different  treatment  modalities  are  compared,  this  was  not  considered  to  be  a  fully  valid  alternative. 
The uncontrolled nature of the pivotal study was therefore judged to be acceptable. 
The  heterogeneity  of  the  patient  population  in  the  pivotal  study  was  also  discussed  and  it  was 
concluded that it was representative for later stage head and neck cancer patients. Heterogeneity with 
respect to anatomical localisation is unlikely to be associated with different biological properties with 
respect  to  sensitivity  to  photodynamic  therapy.  Available  subgroup  efficacy  analyses  related  to 
localisation of the tumour support this view.  
In the initial evaluation there were concerns raised as to the decision whether the patient was incurable 
by surgery or radiotherapy  was  made solely by the treating  physician, instead  of a  multidisciplinary 
team. Possible differences in local therapeutic facilities were also a matter of concern. In the course of 
the  appeal  procedure,  however,  the  Applicant  clarified  that  all  patients  enrolled  in  the  study  were 
treated  in  oncology  centres,  which  as  a  standard  practice  involved  a  multidisciplinary  team  in 
therapeutic decisions. Moreover, it was concluded that for the assessment of antitumour activity it is 
more  important  that  base-line  co-variates  of  possible  relevance  for  antitumour  activity  such  as  prior 
radiotherapy  are  similar,  than  if  alternative  treatment  options  were  excluded  according  to  particular 
standards.  
The  palliative  aims  of  the  treatment,  i.e.  reduction  and  deterrence  of  tumour  related  symptoms,  are 
fully recognised by the CPMP. Nevertheless, due to the absence of a concurrent control, the 3-week 
interval  between  symptom  scoring,  the  potentially  distorting  effects  of  missing  data  and  the  very 
advanced  stage  of  disease  in  a  large  proportion  of  patients,  the  Expert  group  and  the  CPMP  during 
their  discussions  found  it  reasonable  to  put  more  weight  on  tumour  response  data.  The  tumour 
response rate after one treatment course (overall 26%), higher in patients with a tumour depth less than 
10  mm,  and  a  response  duration  of  median  two,  mean  three  months  were  found  to  be  of  clinical 
interest for selected patients with late-stage head and neck cancer without available treatment options. 
In  the  trial,  a  large  proportion  of  patients  also  had  a  too  large  tumour  burden  to  be  likely  to  benefit 
given  the  physical  restrictions  of  photodynamic  therapy.  In  this  context,  taking  the  methodological 
issues  discussed  above  into  account,  a  symptomatic  response  rate  of  22%  with  respect  to  a  pre-
specified  symptom  and  50%  overall,  is  not  without  interest.  The  short  documented  duration  of 
symptomatic response, mean 6 weeks, however, is a concern. Confirmatory data from a more properly 
selected group of patients were therefore considered essential.   
The Applicant has committed to perform post-marketing studies to confirm the efficacy of the product 
in the proposed indication. The CPMP will be consulted through the Scientific Advice Review Group 
for the design of the studies. 
Safety 
The  safety  database  for  Foscan  contains  855  persons  with  1064  treatments  including  early  and 
advanced stages of head and neck cancer, oesophagus, trachea and bronchial cancer as well as healthy 
volunteers.  The  product  has  an  acceptable  safety  profile,  if  used  in  experienced  hands  and  the 
necessary  infrastructure  is  available.  The  adverse  effects  mainly  relate  to  local  effects  of  tumour 
necrosis  with  pain  and  dysphagia  reported  in  10  and  4%  of  the  patients  respectively.  The  risk  of 
phototoxicity is acceptable if the precautionary measures described in the SPC are adhered to.

Benefit/risk assessment 
At  the  end  of  the  appeal  procedure  the  majority  of  the  CPMP  members  were  of  the  view  that 
temoporfin PDT has an overall positive benefit/risk ratio for the treatment of patients with head and 
neck  cancer  in  the  palliative  setting.  However,  six  CPMP  members  had  a  divergent  opinion.  They 
were of the view that the available phase II study showed major deficiencies regarding design and that 
the duration of response observed in this study cannot be considered as of sufficient clinical relevance. 
Based  on  the  CPMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CPMP  considered  that  the 
benefit/risk profile of Foscan was favourable. As a result the CPMP recommended the granting of the 
marketing  authorisation  under  exceptional  circumstances  for  this  medicinal  product  in  the  following 
indication: “Foscan is indicated for the palliative treatment of patients with head and neck squamous 
cell  carcinoma  failing  prior  therapies  and  unsuitable  for  radiotherapy,  surgery  or  systemic 
chemotherapy.”

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The Applicant seeks the following therapeutic indication for Juluca: 
”Treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults who are virologically 
suppressed (HIV-RNA < 50 copies/ml) without known or suspected resistance to either antiretroviral 
component” 
2.1.2.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 70 million people have been infected with HIV, of 
which about 35 million people have died. Globally, 36.7 million [30.8–42.9 million] people were living 
with HIV at the end of 2016. An estimated 0.8% [0.7-0.9%] of adults aged 15–49 years worldwide are 
living with HIV, although the burden of the epidemic continues to vary considerably between countries 
and regions. Sub-Saharan Africa remains most severely affected, with nearly 1 in every 25 adults 
(4.2%) living with HIV and accounting for nearly two-thirds of the people living with HIV worldwide 
(WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) data). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
HIV-1 infection results in chronic activation of the immune system and a subsequent gradual loss of 
CD4+ T cells eventually leading to a state of acquired immunodeficiency (AIDS). One of the predictors 
for HIV-1 disease progression is the level of HIV-1 RNA in the blood (i.e. viral load). The aim of 
treatment of HIV-1 infection is therefore to suppress, and subsequently maintain, the HIV-1 viral load 
to levels that are at least below the limit of detection of most commonly used assays (50 copies/ml of 
blood). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Acute HIV-1 infection is often missed, as it usually presents with nonspecific signs and symptoms 
(including fever, rash, or diarrhoea), or goes without clinical symptoms. If symptoms are present, 
these generally emerge approximately 2 weeks following HIV infection. Among those presenting with 
symptoms, the number of symptoms correlates with higher pre-seroconversion peak plasma viral load. 
Diagnosis therefore most often occurs during chronic infection. Recent estimates suggest that even in 
high income settings; about 25-35% of people living with HIV starting ART have a CD4 cell count of 
less than 200 cells/mm3. In some settings, up to half of people present to care with advanced HIV 
disease – defined by WHO as having a CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm3 or a WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 
disease. Leading causes of mortality among adults with advanced HIV disease globally include 
tuberculosis (TB), severe bacterial infections, cryptococcal meningitis, toxoplasmosis and Pneumocystis 
jirovecii pneumonia. 
Diagnostic tests for HIV-1 infection include assays for HIV-1 RNA, p24 antigen, and HIV-1 and HIV-2 
antibodies.

Page 10/109 
  
  
2.1.5.  Management 
According to EU HIV treatment guidelines, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended in all patients 
with HIV infection, irrespective of CD4 cell counts. For ART-naïve HIV-infected patients, treatment 
guidelines recommend that initial therapy consists of 2 N[t]RTIs and either a nonnucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), a boosted PI, or an integrase strand-transfer inhibitor (INSTI).  
The main goal of ART is to suppress viral replication to below detectable limits (<50 c/ml), increase 
CD4+ cell counts, and prevent transmission. It is a life-long treatment, as the viral load will rebound 
as soon as an individual stops taking effective antiretroviral therapy. 
Current treatment options are generally considered to be potent, with an overall acceptable toxicity 
profile. Mutations in the viral genome can, however, occur when the virus replicates, which can make 
the virus resistant to antiretroviral drugs or classes of drugs. Therefore, there is a continued need for 
development of new antiretroviral treatment options. 
About the product 
DTG/RPV FDC is a 2-drug, NRTI-sparing regimen, differing from the current standard of care, which 
typically includes 2 NRTIs plus a third agent from the PI, NNRTI, or INSTI class. The proposed new 2-
drug regimen of RPV and DTG targets HIV replication at the early and late stage of the virus life cycle, 
respectively.  
Dolutegravir inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand 
transfer step of retroviral Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integration which is essential for the HIV 
replication cycle. 
Dolutegravir, in combination with abacavir (ABC) and lamivudine (3TC) or in combination with 
emtricitabine (FTC) and tenfovir (either as TDF or TAF), is currently listed as one of the recommended 
initial “2 NRTIs+INSTI” regimens for ART-naïve adults (EACS guideline 2017).  
Rilpivirine is a diarylpyrimidine NNRTI of HIV-1. Rilpivirine activity is mediated by non-competitive 
inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). 
Rilpivirine, in combination with FTC+TDF/TAF is one of the recommended initial “2 NRTIs+NNRTI” 
regimens for ART-naïve adults (EACS guideline 2017). 
Juluca (DTG+RPV) is the first dual antiretroviral therapy, indicated specifically as maintenance therapy 
for HIV-1 infected patients who are already virologically suppressed. The proposed benefits of dual vs 
standard triple therapy would be to reduce (long-term) side-effects, spare drug options for the future, 
reduce costs and improve adherence. However, one of the concerns with dual therapy is the risk of 
virologic failure and subsequent selection of resistance mutations compared with standard triple 
therapy.  
Of note, several independent studies investigating Dolutegravir as monotherapy have been performed 
or were ongoing until recently. Although these studies initially seemed to be successful, the 
development has now been halted due to the development of integrase resistance mutations in the 
patients that failed DTG monotherapy (see for more information the review by Jones et al., CROI 
2017: Advances in Antiretroviral Therapy, Top Antivir Med. 2017 May/Jun;25(2):51-67). It was 
concluded that the genetic barrier of dolutegravir monotherapy is insufficient to allow for maintenance 
monotherapy, and all patients receiving DTG monotherapy were advised to at least add lamivudine to 
their current ART or to return to triple ART.

sodium starch glycollate, sodium stearyl fumarate, lactose monohydrate, croscarmellose sodium, 
povidone K30, polysorbate 20 and silicified microcrystalline cellulose. 
Tablet coating: partially hydrolysed polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol, talc, iron 
oxide yellow (E172) and iron oxide red (E172). 
The product is available in white HDPE bottles containing desiccant, closed with polypropylene child-
resistant closures, with polyethylene faced induction heat seal liners as described in section 6.5 of the 
SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Rilpivirine hydrochloride 
The information on rilpivirine hydrochloride is provided in an ASMF, which is also used in the Edurant 
dossier. 
General information 
The chemical name of rilpivirine hydrochloride is 4-[[4-[[4-[(E)-2-cyanoethenyl]-2,6-
dimethylphenyl]amino]-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]benzonitrile monohydrochloride corresponding to the 
molecular formula C22H18N6.HCl. It has a relative molecular mass of 402.88 g/mol and the following 
structure (Figure 1): 
Figure 1 rilpivirine hydrochloride structure 
Rilpivirine hydrochloride is a white to almost white powder, practically insoluble in aqueous media 
across the physiological pH range. It is milled in order to reduce particle size, increase overall surface

area and thus increase dissolution rate in vivo. The active substance is achiral and is not considered 
hygroscopic. 
The chemical structure of rilpivirine hydrochloride was elucidated by a combination of elemental 
analysis, UV absorption spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and mass 
spectrometry. Three polymorphic forms (A, B and C) and a hydrated form (D) have been identified and 
characterised by a combination of IR spectroscopy, XRD, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), 
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and dynamic vapour sorption (DVS). Form A was found, during 
slurry experiments, to be the most thermodynamically stable form, is the chosen commercial 
polymorphic form, and is routinely produced by the manufacturing process. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing process of the active substance has been provided in the 
restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. There are two manufacturers of the 
active substance listed in the ASMF and both use the same convergent synthetic process which starts 
with 2 well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications and consists of 3 synthetic steps. A 
subsequent salt formation step ensures that the correct polymorphic form of the hydrochloride salt is 
formed, and the subsequent milling step reduces the particle size to the required levels. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The characterisation 
of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new 
active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and 
characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in double, antistatic, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags. Both the 
inner  and  the  outer  bag  are  appropriately  closed  and  placed  in  a  fibreboard  container.  The  materials 
comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended.

The rilpivirine hydrochloride specification ncludes tests for appearance, identity (IR, chloride), assay 
(HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), particle size distribution (laser 
diffraction), heavy metals (USP), and residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. Genotoxic impurities are 
controlled to a level well below the TTC. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 10 production scale batches of the active substance, as well as multiple 
development batches, are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch 
to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 11 production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018

60% RH), for up to 36 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
following parameters were tested: appearance, water content, polymorphism, assay, impurities, 
particle size distribution and microbiological quality. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release, (other than polymorphism which is not a release test, but which is checked by XRD), and were 
stability indicating. No significant trends to any of the measured parameters were observed under any 
of the storage conditions, other than a slight increase in particle size at 40 °C. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 3 batches. A slight increase in 
impurity content and particle size was observed, which means that the active substance should be 
protected from light during storage. 
Forced degradation studies were carried out in aqueous acid, base and peroxide. Degradation was 
observed under the oxidative and basic conditions. The studies demonstrated that the HPLC impurity 
method is stability indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 48 months when in the 
proposed container in order to protect from light. 
Dolutegravir sodium 
The information on dolutegravir sodium is provided in a module 3.S and is identical to the data 
included in the Tivicay dossier. 
General information 
The chemical name of dolutegravir sodium is sodium (4R,12aS)-9{[(2,4difluorophenyl)methyl] 
carbamoyl}-4-methyl-6,8-dioxo-3,4,6,8,12,12a-hexahydro-2H-pyrido[1',2':4,5]pyrazino[2,1-
b][1,3]oxazin-7-olate corresponding to the molecular formula C20H18F2N3NaO5. It has a relative 
molecular mass of 441.36 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 2. Dolutegravir sodium structure 
Dolutegravir sodium is a white to light yellow non-hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is slightly soluble 
in water, but becomes less soluble as pH decreases to 1, at which point, it is practically insoluble. It is 
micronised in order to reduce particle size, increase overall surface area and thus increase dissolution 
rate in vivo. Dolutegravir has 2 chiral centres, one of which originates in a starting material and the 
other of which is formed selectively during the process. Stereoisomers are limited in the active 
substance specification. 
The chemical structure of dolutegravir sodium was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, 
IR spectroscopy, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. A single thermodynamically

stable polymorphic form was identified and characterised by a variety of techniques including x-ray 
powder diffraction (XRPD) and DSC. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Two separate synthetic routes are used to manufacture dolutegravir sodium. Route B is a convergent 
process from three well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. Seven manufacturers 
are responsible for various stages of the synthetic process including the micronisations step. The 
correct polymorphic form of the sodium salt is ensured by the crystallisation conditions, and the 
subsequent milling step reduces the particle size to the required levels. 
Route C is also a convergent process from three well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications, 2 of which are the same as used in route B. Two manufacturers are used, one for the 
synthetic chemistry and one for the micronisations step. Both are also responsible for equivalent parts 
of the route B process. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during both synthetic processes. The specifications and 
control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and 
have been justified based on impurity spike and purge data. The specifications for the only common 
intermediate, dolutegravir free acid, are different depending on the route as the impurities generated 
and solvents and reagents used are different. However, both routes have been shown to produce 
dolutegravir sodium of acceptable and comparable quality. 
The correct polymorphic form of the sodium salt is ensured by the crystallisation conditions, and the 
subsequent milling step reduces the particle size to the required levels. The characterisation of the 
active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active 
substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and 
characterised. 
Both manufacturing processes were developed using QbD principles, including risk assessment, prior 
knowledge, and multivariate experiments (e.g. DoE studies), to define which process parameters (PPs) 
impact the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of dolutegravir sodium. Critical process parameters (CPPs) 
were defined, as appropriate, for different steps of the manufacturing processes. Design spaces are 
claimed for several steps of the manufacturing process. For each design space, CPPs are listed, along 
with ranges based on the results of DoEs. The applicant demonstrated that each CPP included in a 
design space is scale-independent during scale up from lab to pilot scale, and by studying reaction 
kinetics. Thus, no commercial scale design space verification is considered necessary. 
The active substance is packaged in LDPE bags sealed with ties and stored in metal, fibre or plastic 
containers. The materials comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The dolutegravir sodium specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR), sodium content (ICP-
AES), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), enantiomer (chiral HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water 
content (KF), polymorphic form (XRPD), and particle size distribution (laser diffraction). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies. The impurities present differ depending on which route of synthesis is 
used. However, the limits set for each individual impurity are considered acceptable and dolutegravir 
sodium made by either route is considered equivalent and of adequate quality. A risk assessment for 
potentially genotoxic impurities was carried out for both manufacturing routes in line with ICH M7. The 
fate of these impurities is well understood based on spiking studies. They are controlled by limits in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018

specifications of raw materials, intermediates or by control of the manufacturing process, and are 
therefore not included in the proposed active substance specification. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 3 production scale batches of dolutegravir sodium manufactured via route B 
from each of the listed manufacturing sites, as well as 6 production scale batches manufactured via 
route C, are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 production scale batches of dolutegravir sodium manufactured via route B from 
each of the proposed manufacturers stored in the intended commercial package for up to 60 months 
under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), for up to 60 months under intermediate conditions 
(30 ºC / 65% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided. In addition, data was provided on 4 production scale batches of 
dolutegravir sodium manufactured via route C stored under intermediate conditions for up to 12 
months and 3 batches stored under accelerated conditions for up to 6 months. The following 
parameters were tested: appearance, identity, assay, water content, solid state form, impurities 
(including stereoisomer content) and particle size distribution. The analytical methods used were the 
same as for release and were stability indicating as indicated by forced degradation studies. No 
significant trends to any of the measured parameters were observed under any of the storage 
conditions and all were within specification. 
For the stressed stability studies, data was presented following short-term storage under stressed 
conditions for one batch manufactured via route B. Samples were stored exposed to high temperature, 
high humidity, or light according to ICH guideline Q1B. Assay decreased slightly in samples exposed to 
light, whereas impurity content increased slightly in samples stored at high temperature.  
Forced degradation studies were also performed to identify potential degradation products that might 
be formed in active substance and finished product, to elucidate the mechanisms of formation and to 
demonstrate the stability indicating nature of the analytical methods. Degradation products were 
formed under basic, acidic, and photo-oxidative conditions. However, none of the impurities identified 
have been observed at significant levels under long-term or accelerated storage conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. Although limited data is available for some manufacturing sites, the combined 
evidence and the similarity of results at equivalent time-points indicates that there are unlikely to be 
significant differences in the stability profile of dolutegravir sodium manufactured at different sites or 
by different routes. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months protected from 
light. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Juluca is a fixed dose combination, immediate release film-coated tablet containing dolutegravir 
sodium and rilpivirine hydrochloride as active substances. The finished product is a bilayer tablet which 
allows each active substance to be formulated separately and maintain its requisite physicochemical 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 16/109 
  
  
properties during manufacture and storage. The tablets are pink, bioconvex, and debossed with SV J3T 
on one face. 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements and applies the quality risk 
management approach as discussed in ICH Q8-10. The development also draws on prior knowledge of 
two marketed single entity products, Tivicay (which contains dolutegravir sodium) and Edurant (which 
contains rilpivirine hydrochloride). The same container closure system, an HDPE bottle with PP child-
resistant closure, as used for the single entity products is used with addition of a silica gel desiccant. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as a film-coated immediate release tablet 
containing the correct amount of each active substance, of a suitable size such that patients can 
swallow it, for daily dosing. The product should be of suitable quality and meet compendial 
requirements. Each active substance should be bioequivalent to the corresponding single entity tablet. 
The stability of the product should be suitable for worldwide marketing and the container closure 
system should provide adequate protection and be child-resistant. The critical quality attributes 
identified were description, identity, assay, content uniformity, impurities and dissolution. 
Dolutegravir sodium is practically insoluble in aqueous media across the physiological pH range. It is 
slightly soluble in water and above pH 8. The polymorphic form and particle size distribution are 
controlled in its specification following micronisations. Rilpivirine hydrochloride is also practically 
insoluble from pH 1 to 13. The polymorphic form and particle size distribution are controlled in its 
specification following milling. Both active substances are non-hygroscopic BCS class II molecules.  
Since one active substance has an acidic counter ion whereas the other bears a basic counter ion, 
there is potential for disproportionation to the respective free bases during manufacture and storage 
which could adversely impact dissolution characteristics and thus, bioavailability. Therefore, a bilayer 
formulation was pursued, in order to segregate the active substances and prevent disproportionation. 
Compatibility with the excipients was previously demonstrated in the single entity products. 
During development, five prototype bilayer formulations were evaluated against Edurant and Tivicay in 
relative bioavailability studies. All formulations were found to be bioequivalent. One was selected for 
commercialisation and for clinical studies, and a pivotal bioequivalence study was conducted to 
conclusively demonstrate bioequivalence with the co-administered single entity products. 
 Development of the dissolution method took into account prior knowledge from the single entity 
product methods. A method able to monitor dissolution of both active substances was identified is 
considered to be sufficiently discriminatory. 
The  risk  management  process  was  initiated  following  selection  of  the  finished  product  manufacturing 
process.  This  began  with  a  detailed  overview  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  identification  of  risks 
(failure  modes)  and  process  variables  that  could  impact  quality  by  using  risk  identification  tools  and 
prior knowledge. An overall risk priority number was then assigned using failure mode effects analysis 
(FMEA) and  used to guide univariate and multi-factorial DoE studies. Risk assessments were updated 
throughout the development. 
Process  stretching  studies  were  carried  out  on  commercial  scale  in  multi-variate  fashion  in  order  to 
assess potential CPPs and identify design spaces. Although not all combinations of input variables were 
studied, the most extreme conditions, based on risk assessment and prior knowledge, were identified 
and investigated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 17/109 
  
  
A series of DoE studies were undertaken in order to optimise different steps of the process. This 
allowed confirmation of CPPs for individual unit operations and definition of design spaces. The design 
spaces were developed through experimentation at production scale and hence no additional 
verification was required. 
The  finished  product  CQAs  are  controlled  through  the  quality  and  quantity  of  input  materials,  the 
manufacturing  process  and  its  process  parameters  and/or  the  finished  product  specification.  The 
control strategy and design spaces, along with the applied ranges for CPPs are considered acceptable. 
The primary packaging was selected in accordance with the QTPP and is an HDPE bottle, with PP child 
resistant closure. Each bottle contains a silica gel desiccant canister to prevent formation of rilpivirine 
free base. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  3  main  parts  and  is  carried  out  by  a  single  manufacturer: 
production of dolutegravir compression blend; production of rilpivirine compression blend; combination 
of  the  two  into  the  final  film-coated  tablet.  The  overall  process  is  considered  to  be  a  standard 
manufacturing process. 
The production of dolutegravir compression blend consists of 6 main steps: blending of intra-granular 
excipients;  high  shear  wet  granulation;  wet  milling;  drying;  dry  milling;  blending  with  extra-granular 
excipients. The compression blend is used within 30 days so intermediate holding times are defined. 
The  production  of  rilpivirine  compression  blend  consists  of  6  main  steps:  blending  of  intra-granular 
excipients;  fluid  bed  granulation;  drying;  dry  milling;  blending  with  extra-granular  excipients; 
lubrication. Stability data have been provided to justify a holding time for the intermediate of up to 6 
months  at  15-25  oC  at  <  60%  RH,  stored in  double  PE  bags  with  a  desiccant  between  the  layers,  all 
within a suitable secondary container. 
Production of the final tablets consists of 4 main steps: compression of the dolutegravir layer; 
compression of the rilpivirine layer; film-coating; packing. Stability data has been provided to justify a 
bulk holding time for the film-coated tablets of up to 6 months at ≤25 oC when sealed within double 
LDPE bags with desiccant between the layers, all stored within a rigid plastic container. The primary 
bulk packaging material complies with regulation 10/2011 and Ph. Eur. 3.1.3. 
A process validation scheme for a minimum of 3 production scale batches was provided. This is 
acceptable since the manufacturing process is considered standard. The IPCs are adequate for this 
type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Design spaces have been proposed for the following steps of the manufacturing process of the 
medicinal product: dolutegravir granulation and drying; dolutegravir granule blending; rilpivirine 
granulation; compression; film-coating. The design spaces were all developed at commercial scale so 
no further verification is needed. The available development data, the proposed control strategy and 
batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed design space.

Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for this  kind  of  dosage  form  and 
comprise  tests  for  description,  identity  (UV,  HPLC),  dolutegravir  and  rilpivirine  assay  (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (both active substances, HPLC), dissolution (both active substances, UV or 
HPLC), and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
The absence of a test for degradation products has been justified by provision of batch analysis from 
10 production scale batches of finished product, as well as 3 batches manufactured with a slightly 
shallower cup depth during compression. A test for degradation products is included in the shelf-life 
specification. A risk assessment for elemental impurities was carried out in line with ICH Q3D, which 
concluded that no tests for elemental impurities were required. Based on the information and data 
supplied, this is considered justified. Water content is controlled as an IPC and so is not needed in the 
release specification. A desiccant is included in the container closure system and test for water content 
by KF is included in the shelf-life specification. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing (at shelf-life) has been presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided for 3 pilot scale and 6 production scale batches confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  3  approximately  production  scale  batches  of  finished  product  stored  for  up  to  12 
months  under  long  term  conditions  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated 
conditions  (40  ºC  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  are 
representative of those proposed for marketing, differing only slightly in shape, and were packed in the 
primary  packaging  proposed  for  marketing.  Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  degradation 
products,  dissolution,  microbiological  quality,  water  activity,  water  content  and  rilpivirine  free  base 
content. The analytical procedures used are the same as used for release and were demonstrated to be 
stability indicating during forced degradation studies. Additional analytical methods not included in the 
release specifications were suitably validated. 
No  significant  changes  to  any  of  the  measured  parameters  were  observed,  other  than  for  a  slight 
increase in rilpivirine free base content, more so under accelerated conditions, but still below the limit 
of detection. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  No  significant  changes  were  observed.  The  same  batch  was 
exposed to other stressed conditions including freeze/thaw and 50 °C at ambient humidity. Again, no 
changes were observed other than a slight increase in rilpivirine free base at the higher temperature. 
An in-use stability study was carried out by simulating the daily dosing regimen over 30 days. Bottles 
were  opened  daily,  leaving  the  desiccant  in  place,  and  a  tablet  was  removed  and  tested  for 
appearance, assay, related substances, dissolution, water content and rilpivirine free base content. No 
significant  changes  were  observed  for  any  of  the  tested  parameters  other  than  a  slight  increase  in 
rilpivirine free base. The applicant has committed to perform another study on a second batch towards 
the end of its shelf-life. 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months without special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose monohydrate is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same 
condition as those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared 
without the use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on 
Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and 
veterinary medicinal products. 
No other excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The development program was largely based on prior 
knowledge of the two standalone single component products. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and/or finished 
product and their manufacturing process. Design spaces have been proposed for five steps in the 
manufacturing process of the finished product and have been adequately verified. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
The applicant should perform another in-use stability study on a second batch of finished 
product towards the end of its shelf-life. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Dolutegravir (DTG) is a potent, selective and novel integrase inhibitor (INI) and rilpivirine (RPV) is a 
potent non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) against human immunodeficiency virus 
type 1 (HIV-1). 
The structure of DTG and RPV is shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 20/109 
  
  
Figure 3. Structure of DTG 
Figure 4. Structure of RPV 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics 
Dolutegravir is a second generation integrase inhibitor. The IC50 of dolutegravir against the purified 
enzyme HIV-1 integrase ranged from 2.7 nM to 12.6 nM. EC50 in cell-based assays ranged from 0.51 
to 2.1 nM. 
Rilpivirine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. In cell-based assays, EC50 against HIV-1 
was 0.07 – 1.01 nM against group M and 2.88 – 8.45 nM against group O.  
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
For dolutegravir, inhibition was observed only at the melanocortin receptor at concentrations > 100-
fold above the unbound clinical Cmax. 
Rilpivirine has no antiviral activity against various human viruses other than HIV and no potential off-
target activity, but showed low cytotoxic potential in various human cell lines. 
Safety pharmacology 
No significant effects of dolutegravir were observed in safety pharmacology studies with single oral 
doses of dolutegravir up to 500 (rat) and 1000 (monkey) mg/kg on major organ function in brain, 
respiratory and cardiovascular system. 
Results of the in vitro hERG test revealed that rilpivirine has the potential to prolong the QT-interval. 
This QT prolonging potential and its delayed onset was confirmed by the results of additional in vitro 
cardiovascular safety studies. The respiratory and central nervous system were not affected by 
rilpivirine at therapeutic concentrations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 21/109 
  
  
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Dolutegravir and rilpivirine were additive or synergistic in in vitro combination studies with common 
anti-HIV agents. The combination of dolutegravir and rilpivirine was shown to be additive in an in vitro 
study in CEM-SS cells with the HIV-1 strain IIIB. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Bioavailability of dolutegravir in rat and monkey ranged from 25 to 34% and increased to levels of 76 
to 87% after fasting. In non-fasted beagle dogs, bioavailability was 39%. 
After oral administration of rilpivirine base, the absolute oral bioavailability of rilpivirine was 32%, 
54%, 31% and 24% to rats, rabbits, dogs and monkeys, respectively. 
Distribution 
Protein binding of dolutegravir was > 99% in rat, monkey and human and 95% in dog. The highest 
levels of drug-related material were found at 6 h after dosing in liver, adrenal medulla, myocardium, 
pigmented skin, renal cortex and renal medulla, lung and lymph nodes. Dolutegravir crossed the 
placenta of pregnant rats and was excreted into rat milk.  
Protein binding of rilpivirine was > 99% in human, monkey, dog, rat, rabbit and mouse. The highest 
levels of drug-related material were found at 4 h after dosing in the uveal tract, liver and adrenal 
gland. Rilpivirine-related material crosses the blood-brain barrier and was found to be binding to 
melanin. Rilpivirine-related material crossed the placenta barrier in rats. Concentrations of rilpivirine 
were quantifiable in blood samples from rat pups, demonstrating that pups were exposed to rilpivirine 
via the milk. 
Metabolism 
In human hepatocytes, the notable route of metabolism for [14C]-dolutegravir was glucuronidation. 
Metabolite profiles of rat, monkey and human were qualitatively similar. Dolutegravir was the major 
radiolabelled component in plasma of mice, rats and monkeys. 
Rilpivirine is metabolised via Phase I and Phase II reactions and a large number of metabolites were 
detected in all species. The most important pathway is oxidation and hydroxylation and to a minor 
extent conjugation with glutathione and glucuronide. Overall, identified metabolites that were detected 
in human matrices were also detected in at least one animal species except for one, glucuronidated 
metabolite which is expected to be inactive and non-toxic. 
Excretion 
Regarding dolutegravir, drug related material was excreted for the major part via the faeces (91 – 
94% in rats and mice and 67 – 78% in monkeys). Urinary excretion was less than 2% of administered 
dose in mouse, less than 4% in rat and 4 - 6% in monkey. In bile duct cannulated animals, biliary 
excretion accounted for approximately 2.5% of dose in mouse, 7% of the dose in rat and 12% of dose 
in monkey. 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 22/109 
  
  
The predominant route of elimination of rilpivirine drug-related material in all species following oral 
administration was via faeces (>85%), with a small contribution eliminated in urine (<6.2%). The 
majority of the eliminated radioactivity is unchanged rilpivirine (25-47% of the dose). In rats, biliary 
excretion is limited (18-25%).  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Three combination studies were submitted in which dogs were treated orally with either individual 
tablets containing dolutegravir or rilpivirine co-dosed or combination tablets containing dolutegravir 
and rilpivirine. The dog studies show no significant differences in exposure between treatments with 
dolutegravir and rilpivirine as separate tablets and as combination tablets. A clear increase in exposure 
was observed for the fed state compared to the fasted state for both dolutegravir and rilpivirine. 
Gastric emptying seemed somewhat prolonged for the combination tablets compared to the co-dosed 
tablets in one study, but not in the other study where there was less variability in stomach emptying 
and gastrointestinal transit. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose studies were performed with dolutegravir. Investigations for acute effects were 
incorporated in oral repeat dose toxicity studies. Dolutegravir was not tolerated in monkeys at doses ≥  
300 mg/kg (severe gastrointestinal intolerance) and in dogs at doses ≥ 150 mg/kg (vomiting). 
In single dose oral studies with rilpivirine, no relevant effects were observed in mice up to 1600 mg/kg 
and rats up to 800 mg/kg. In dogs, 80 mg/kg was the maximum feasible dose (vomiting and soft 
stool). 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
Dolutegravir induced slight increases in bilirubin and liver transaminases and mucous neck cells in 
stomach in mice. In rats, gastric mucosal changes and lesions were observed which were attributed to 
local irritating properties. In monkeys, liver toxicity, atrophy and haemorrhage of mucosal epithelium 
in the stomach, atrophy of cecum, colon and rectum as well as decreases in red blood cells and 
reticulocytes and lymphocytes were observed.  
Rilpivirine induced liver enzyme induction in rodents and evidence of cholestasis in dogs. Effects on the 
kidney were noted in mice (pale and enlarged/swollen kidneys, (necrotic) nephropathy), dogs (acute 
interstitial nephritis, corticomedullar mineralization) and possibly also rats (reduced weight, changes in 
urine parameters). Inhibition of adrenal steroid synthesis was observed in all species and ascribed to 
inhibition of cytochrome CYP21 and CYP17. This may be the cause of effects on the reproductive 
organs such as early sexual maturation, activation of ovaries, atrophic tubuli and hypertrophy of 
Leydig cells in testes in dogs, and reduced weight/size of ovaries/uterus, absence of ovulation, uterus 
atrophy and hyperkeratosis/mucification of vaginal epithelium in mice. In addition, in mice, rats and 
dogs, small reduction in red blood cell parameters were noted and in rats increases in coagulation 
parameters. 
Toxicity studies with the combination of dolutegravir and rilpivirine have not been performed. This is in 
accordance with a scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/544739/2014, 25 September 2014) in which it 
Assessment report

Page 23/109 
  
  
was concluded that non-clinical studies with the combination are not necessary and that monitoring for 
adverse liver effects should be implemented in clinical studies. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Dolutegravir and rilpivirine tested negative in standard packages of genotoxicity studies. 
No clinically relevant carcinogenicity was observed in long-term carcinogenicity studies with 
dolutegravir in mice and rats. In 2-year carcinogenicity studies with rilpivirine in mice and rats, 
increased tumours were found in liver and/or thyroid, which were considered associated with liver 
enzyme induction and not relevant for humans. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No effects on fertility and early embryonic development were observed for dolutegravir and rilpivirine 
in rats.  
In embryofoetal development studies with dolutegravir and rilpivirine in rats and rabbits, no relevant 
embryotoxicity and teratogenicity were observed.  
Dolutegravir caused no effect on pre- and postnatal development in rats except for a decrease in 
maternal and pup body weight at the highest dose. No marked effects were noted in the peri/post-
natal development study with rilpivirine in the rat. 
Juvenile rats treated with dolutegravir were more sensitive to adverse effects compared to adults, with 
deaths occurring at 75 mg/kg/day while in adult rats no deaths were seen up to 1000 mg/kg/day. No 
effects were observed in juvenile rats treated with rilpivirine. In studies in immature dogs and 
monkeys, rilpivirine had a similar toxicological profile as in adult animals. 
Local tolerance and antigenicity 
Dolutegravir had mild irritant effects on abraded skin and slight ocular irritating effects. Rilpivirine was 
not irritating to skin and a moderate eye irritant in the in vitro bovine corneal opacity-permeability eye 
irritation assay. 
Dolutegravir and rilpivirine showed no potential for sensitization in the local lymph node assay in mice. 
Immunotoxicity 
Dolutegravir had no effect on T-cell dependent antibody formation in rats and on several 
immunological endpoints in juvenile rats.  
No immunotoxic potential was found in rilpivirine-treated rats challenged with sheep red blood cells. 
Impurities 
No changes are reported for the fixed dose combination compared to the impurity profiles in Tivicay 
(dolutegravir) and Edurant (rilpivirine).

Phototoxicity 
Dolutegravir was phototoxic when tested in the Neutral Red Uptake assay using Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts 
but not phototoxic in an in vivo study in pigmented rats. 
Rilpivirine was not phototoxic in the in vitro Balb/c mouse fibroblast assay.

Conclusions on studies for rilpivirine 
Rilpivirine is not a PBT substance and is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Based on the nonclinical data provided on the individual agents, there appears to be no significant 
potential for adverse interactions between the two components. An extensive number of nonclinical 
toxicity studies have been conducted for each of the agents individually in support of the single 
components marketing authorisation applications. No significant toxicological finding was identified for 
either compound that would indicate a concern for dolutegravir and rilpivirine co-administration. 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 27/109 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No new non-clinical studies were submitted except for an in vitro pharmacodynamics interaction study 
and three pharmacokinetic interaction studies in dogs.  
Non-clinically, both dolutegravir and rilpivirine have some potential for liver toxicity. Toxicity studies 
with the combination of dolutegravir and rilpivirine have not been performed. This is in accordance 
with a scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/544739/2014, 25 September 2014) in which it was 
concluded that non-clinical studies with the combination are not necessary and that monitoring for 
adverse liver effects should be implemented in clinical studies. 
The ERA for RPV and DTG are considered complete and acceptable. For DTG, the study on 
adsorption/desorption has been performed on sludge only which is acceptable for use in Phase II Tier 
A. For the risk assessment of the sediment and soil compartment in Phase II Tier B, an 
adsorption/desorption study on 3 soils in accordance with OECD TG 106 with DTG should have been 
provided. However, under consideration of the very low risk quotient for sediment organisms and a 
resulting margin of safety of over 10 000, it is considered very unlikely that a Koc derived on soils will 
be increased by four orders of magnitude compared to the Koc for sludge. Hence, a study on 
adsorption/desorption on soils can be waived in this case. 
DTG and RPV are not PBT substances. Both are not readily biodegradable in sewage treatment plants 
and have to be considered very persistent in water/sediment systems and soils. 
Results from Phase II Tier A and Tier B studies do neither indicate any risk from RPV and DTG to the 
surface water, groundwater and sediment compartment nor to sewage treatment plants. RPV does not 
pose a risk to the soil compartment; data on terrestrial fate and effects for DTG are considered not 
necessary as the cut-off criteria are not fulfilled.  
The evaluation of the bioaccumulation potential is considered not necessary for DTG due to its logDow 
of -2.28 to -3.21 at pH 5-9, however, has been performed for RPV due to its logKow of 4.66. It was 
shown that RPV is not bioaccumulative. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Non clinical safety data from the individual components in addition to the clinical data supports the 
safe use of the applied fixed dose combination of dolutegravir and rilpivirine. 
Considering the above data, RPV and DTG are not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

The primary analysis demonstrated that DTG + RPV is noninferior to CAR, 
with 94% of subjects in both treatment groups 
achieving the primary endpoint of <50 c/mL plasma HIV-1 RNA at Week 48 
based on the (Snapshot) algorithm [adjusted treatment difference and 95% 
CI; 0.2%, -3.9% to 4.2%] for the ITT-E Population. 
Switching to a once daily 2-drug regimen of DTG + RPV demonstrated 
numerical improvement in BMD for virologically suppressed HIV-1-infected 
adults when compared with continuing treatment with a TDF containing ART 
regimen. 
DTG/RPV FDC is bioequivalent to combined administration of the SEs. The 
90% CI of the GLS mean PK parameter ratios was within 80 to 125% for all 
primary PK parameter endpoints (AUC(0-t), AUC(0-∞), and Cmax) for both 
DTG and RPV. 
Part 1: The AUC(0-∞) and Cmax of DTG following administration of various 
FDC tablets in presence of high fat diet were 
comparable to those following the reference DTG single agent co-
administered with RPV. The AUC(0-∞) and Cmax of RPV 
following administration of various FDC tablets in presence of high fat diet 
were comparable to or ranged from 8% lower to 10% higher (depending on 
the FDC tablet) than those of the reference RPV single agent co 
administered with DTG. 
Part 2: Systemic exposure of DTG following all DTG/RPV FDC formulations 
was lower than exposure following co-administration 
of the SE tablets under fasted conditions. Systemic exposure of RPV

Key conclusions 
following all DTG/RPV FDC formulations was comparable to 
or higher than exposure following co-administration of the SE tablets under 
fasted conditions. Food Effect: All test DTG/RPV FDC formulations showed 
increases in DTG and RPV systemic exposures with a moderate fat meal 
(Part 2). This finding is consistent with previous food effect studies of the 
SEs. Cross-cohort comparisons between fed (High Fat Part 1) and fasted 
(Part 2) showed that a high-fat meal increased DTG and RPV systemic 
exposure following administration of 3 FDC formulations (AK, AM and 
AS/AU) and 
as co-administration as the SE tablets. 
Co-administration of DTG with RPV resulted in no change in DTG AUC(0-τ) 
and Cmax, and a 22% increase in Cτ. 
Co-administration of DTG with RPV resulted in no change in RPV AUC(0-τ) 
and Cmax, and a 21% increase in Cτ. 
There was no significant drug interaction between DTG and RPV. 
DTV and RPV can be co-administered without dose adjustment.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Dolutegravir 
Following oral administration of tablet formulations, DTG absorption is rapid with no absorption lag 
time and a median t max of 2 to 3 hours post dose.  DTG concentration declines mono-exponentially 
with an average t½ of approximately 14 hours. 
DTG absorption is increased with co-administration of food and decreased when co-administered with 
polyvalent metal cation-containing products. Following oral administration of tablet formulations, in 
general, DTG exhibits nonlinear PK with less than dose-proportional increases in plasma exposure from 
2 to 100 mg (Study ING111521 and Study ING114005), however, increase in DTG exposure appears 
dose proportional from 25 mg to 50 mg, i.e. the therapeutic doses currently used (as observed in 
Study ING112276). 
The absolute BA of DTG has not been directly measured due to low solubility and its non-specific 
binding, which present significant challenges to an IV formulation for DTG even at very low doses.  
However, based on accumulated data from in vitro permeability, metabolism, and biliary excretion in 
animals, and a human mass-balance study (ING111853), the absolute BA of DTG is estimated to be 
approximately 67% to 80% from the suspension formulation and 49% to 56% from the tablet 
formulation. 
Following single oral administration as a tablet formulation, food was noted to modestly increase 
systemic exposure to DTG (66%) resulting in an estimated fraction absorbed of 81% to 93%. 
Rilpivirine 
The absolute BA of RPV has not been directly measured due to low solubility and its non-specific 
binding, which present significant challenges to an IV formulation for RPV even at very low doses. 
The effect of concomitant food intake on the oral BA of RPV administered as a tablet (study TMC278-
TiDP6-C137) showed that the mean exposure to RPV administered as the 75 mg Phase III tablet was 
higher after a standardized (normal fat or high fat) breakfast than under fasted conditions.  
Administration of RPV after a high-fat breakfast or after a standard breakfast resulted in similar 
exposures.  It is recommended that RPV is always taken with a meal. Administration of RPV under 
fasted conditions decreased RPV AUC0-∞ by 41% and Cmax by 46%.  Administration of RPV (Phase III 
tablet) with only a protein-rich nutritional drink decreased RPV AUC0-∞ by 49% and Cmax by 50% 
compared with a standard meal (study TMC278-TiDP6-C137). 
The highest solubility of RPV is obtained at pH 2.0 (0.003 g/100 mL).  At pH values above 2.0, the 
solubility decreases (< 0.001 g/100 mL).  Drugs that alter intragastric pH affect the solubility of RPV 
and thus indirectly affect the absorption of RPV.  Co- administration of the proton-pump inhibitor 
omeprazole (20 mg once daily) resulted in a 56% decrease in the AUC24h of a single dose of RPV (150 
mg) and a 40% decrease after multiple doses of RPV (150 mg once daily) at steady state compared 
with administration of RPV alone. 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 31/109 
  
  
 
PH-dependent absorption was confirmed in a DDI Study (TMC278-C140) with RPV and famotidine, a 
histamine H2-receptor antagonist that inhibits gastric acid production. When a single dose of RPV was 
administered 2 hours after a single dose of famotidine, RPV AUC0-∞ was decreased by 76% compared 
with administration of RPV alone.  There was an inverse relationship between intragastric pH and RPV 
exposure after famotidine administration.   
Overall, RPV permeation is thought to occur predominantly via a passive transcellular diffusion 
mechanism.  
Although an in vitro P-gp inhibitory effect was seen, an in vivo effect of RPV at the intestinal absorption 
level is unlikely, given that the in vivo RPV total plasma concentrations at the therapeutic dose of 25 
mg are more than 10-fold lower than the IC50 value of 3371 ng/mL. 
Bioequivalence 
Three pharmacokinetic studies pivotal for the development of the fixed dose combination of DTG + RPV 
have been conducted; one dug-drug interaction study, one also investigating the food effect on the 
formulation (Study 201674) and a bioequivalence study (Study  201676).  
Study 201674 
Study Title: A Phase I, 2-Part Relative Oral Bioavailability Study of Different Fixed Dose Combinations 
of Dolutegravir and Rilpivirine in Fasted and Fed Healthy Subjects 
This study evaluated the relative bioavailability of four prototype FDC DTG 50 mg/RPV 25 mg tablet 
formulations and the food effect of single doses of three prototype FDC DTG 50 mg/RPV 25 mg tablet 
formulations (relative to co-administration of the individual components in healthy adult subjects). 
This study served as a guide for pharmaceutical development and provided information on the study 
design and sample size required for the pivotal BE study 201676. Moreover, the food effect on the 
fixed dose formulation was investigated. 
Part I: 
First, the relative bioavailability of a single dose of DTG 50 mg and RPV 25 mg when administered 
together (FDC vs. single tablets) was evaluated under fed conditions. For this, a randomised, open-
label, three-way, crossover, single-center, incomplete-block and Youden square design study was 
conducted. Each subject received the reference treatment A (co-administration of the single tablets 
DTG 50 mg and RPV 25 mg) and two of the four FDC tablet formulations (AS, AM, AQ, AK) with a 
wash-out period of at least 9 days between dosing periods. Reference and test formulations were 
administered with a high-fat meal (about 900 total calories: 150 calories from protein, 250 calories 
from carbohydrate, and 500 calories from fat). 27 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study and 
24 subjects completed the study. 
Part II: 
To  evaluate  the effect  of  food on  the  bioavailability,  the  FDC  tablet  formulations  “AK”  and  “AM”  were 
selected (based on bioavailability results from part I and manufacturing/stability conditions) as well as 
the previously untested FDC formulation “AU”. A randomised, open-label, 3-way crossover study with 
36  subjects  was  performed.  Each  subject  received  a  single  dose  of  one  FDC  formulation  (AK,  AM,  or 
AU) under fasted and fed conditions (moderate fat meal: approximately 625 total calories: 125 calories

from protein, 300 calories from carbohydrate, and 200 calories from fat) and the reference treatment 
(DTG 50 mg and RPV 25 mg as single tablets) under fasted conditions. 
Result: 
1) Relative Bioavailability 
Under fed conditions (high-fat meal), DTG systemic exposure in terms of Cmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ of all 
FDC formulations was comparable to co-administration of the single agent. 90% CIs for all 
comparisons were within the acceptance bioequivalence interval of 80-125%. Under fasted conditions 
systemic exposure of DTG was lower after administration of all FDC formulations tested compared to 
the co-administration of the SE tablets. 
For RPV, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for all FDC formulations were comparable to those for the SE tablets with 
90% CIs within conventional acceptance criteria for bioequivalence. For the formulations “AM” and 
“AQ”, the upper limit of 90% CI (Cmax) was outside of 1.25, and for the formulation “AS”, the lower 
limit of 90% CI (Cmax) was outside of 0.8. However, this study was not designated to assess formal 
bioequivalence between the FDC formulations and co-administration of the single tablets. Under fasted 
conditions systemic exposure of RPV was lower than under fed conditions with comparable or higher 
exposures after administration of all FDC tested compared to the co-administration of the SE tablets. 
The pharmacokinetic data for formulation “AM”, differing only slightly from the formulation “AW” used 
in the pivotal BE study 201676, and the reference treatment are shown in 1.

2)  Food Effect 
Administration of the FDC tablets after a moderate and high fat meal significantly increased the 
systemic exposure of DTG, consistent with what was observed with the reference treatment and 
previous food effect studies of the single agents. 
After a moderate-fat meal DTG AUC0-t/AUC0-∞ was increased by 73% to 88% and Cmax by 75% to 88%.  
A cross-cohort comparison between part I (high fat) and part II (fasted) showed that co-administration 
of the various FDC tablets with a high-fat meal increased DTG AUC0-t/AUC0-∞ by 71% to 89% and Cmax 
by 71% to 85%. 
In case of RPV AUC0-t/AUC0-∞ was increased by 38% to 58% and Cmax by 74% to 94% after 
administration of the different FDC formulations under moderate fat conditions. 
In the cross-cohort comparison between part I (high fat) and part II (fasted) RPV AUC0-t/AUC0-∞ was 
increased by 55% to 85% and Cmax by 73% to 117%. The pharmacokinetic data for formulation “AM”, 
claimed to be similar to formulation “AW” used in the pivotal BE study 201676, are shown in Table 2.

Study 201676 
Study title: An Open-label, Randomized, Two-Way Crossover, Single Dose, Pivotal Bioequivalence 
Study of a Fixed-Dose Combination of Dolutegravir and Rilpivirine in Healthy Volunteers 
The development of a FDC tablet of DTG 50 mg and RPV 25 mg occurred in parallel with the ongoing 
phase 3 studies (SWORD-1 and SWORD-2), which are being conducted with the separate DTG 50 mg

and RPV 25 mg tablets. This pivotal BE study compared the bioavailability of DTG and RPV when 
administered as FDC tablet with co-administration of the individual single entity products to serve as a 
bridge to the clinical efficacy and safety data.  
For this study the formulation “AW” was selected based on in vitro testing, stability, and 
manufacturability considerations, and supported by the results of the relative BA study 201674. The 
formulation “AM” used in the relative BA study 201674 is slightly different from the formulation 
“AW”.The dissolution profiles of these two FDC formulations are comparable under the conditions 
tested. 
Study design 
This was an open-label, randomized, two-period, cross-over, single dose, oral bioequivalence study 
under fed conditions with a wash-out period of 21 days between dosing periods.  
Starting and end date of the study 
Clinical phase: 11th May to 24th October 2016 (first blood sampling on 7th June 2016) 
Bioanalytical phase: 12th July to 20th October 2016 (DTG) 
                              19th July to 7th November 2016 (RPV) 
Applied dose 
FDC tablet formulation “AW” or single tablets of DRV and RPV were administered with 240 ml water 
30 minutes after a moderate fat breakfast (approximately 625 total calories: 125 calories from protein, 
300 calories from carbohydrate, and 200 calories from fat). 
Sample collection 
Blood samples were collected prior to study drug administration and at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 
4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 12.0, 16.0, 24.0, 48.0, 72.0 and 120 hours post-dose into tubes containing 
K2EDTA (DTG) and sodium heparin (RPV) as anticoagulant. Additional blood samples were collected for 
RPV at 168, 216, and 264 hours post-dose. 
Within 45 minutes after collection, the samples were centrifuged and the separated plasma samples 
were stored at -20°C. Samples were shipped frozen on dry ice at the end of each period to the 
bioanalytical sites.

* Although the final film-coated tablet batch of the test formulation comprised only 67,000 tablets, the compression 
batch size comprised 117 kg of tablet cores (corresponding to about 234,000 units which corresponds to about 54% 
of full production scale). 
Population studied 
118 healthy male and female subjects aged between 18 and 55 years with a BMI of 18.5-31 kg/m2 
were enrolled and randomized. 113 subjects completed both treatment periods. A total of 115 subjects 
received treatment A (FDC) and 116 received treatment B (single tablets). 
Five subjects were excluded from the statistical analysis for plausible, not PK-related reasons.   
Initially, 86 subjects were planned for this study based on historical PK data for DTG and RPV (in the 
BA study 201674 and DDI study LAI116181 the highest within-subject coefficient of variation (CVw) 
for RPV Cmax was 26.8% and 28%, respectively). A blinded sample size re-estimation was performed 
after 56 subjects had been dosed to evaluate the appropriateness of the assumed PK parameter 
variability and associated sample size. Based on the higher RPV CVw observed (32.9% for Cmax), 
32 additional subjects were recruited.  
Results  
The pharmacokinetic variables of DTG and RPV for both treatments (A: FDC tablet formulation 
DTG/RPV 50 mg/25 mg; B: DTG 50 mg plus RPV 25 mg) are shown in Table 8 and Table 9 
respectively. DTG and RPV systemic exposure in terms of Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ following 
administration of the FDC tablet formulation were comparable to those of the co-administered single 
agents. The 90% CIs of all PK parameters were within the 80-125% acceptance range. 
Thus, the FDC tablet formulation of DTG/RPV 50 mg/25 mg is considered bioequivalent to co-
administration of the single tablets with the same contents of actives with respect to both rate and 
extent of absorption under moderate-fat conditions.

Commercial formulation 
A slight change to the tablet shape was made between the FDC formulation “AW” used in the BE study 
and the proposed commercial formulation. This change is not expected to have any impact on the 
bioavailability. The dissolution profiles show the two tablet shapes are comparable. 
The bioanalytical methods for studies 201674 and 201676 have been validated and were considered 
satisfactory.  
Distribution 
Dolutegravir 
Apparent  volume  of  distribution  was  estimated  at  17.4  L  following  oral  tablet  dosing  based  on  a 
population  PK  analysis  in  treatment-naïve  subjects.    The  estimated  Vd/F  is  greater  than  the  total 
plasma volume (~3 L for a 70-kg person), but similar to the volume of total water in the extracellular 
space  (~15  L  for  a  70-kg  person).    Total  blood  and  plasma  drug-related  radioactivity  concentration 
ratios, as measured in the human mass balance Study ING111853 were averaged at 0.441 to 0.535, 
indicating minimal association of DTG with blood cellular components.

In vitro, the protein binding of DTG in human serum and plasma is high (approximately 99.3%).  DTG 
appears  to  primarily  bind  to  albumin  based  on  the  hepatic  impairment  Study  ING113097  where  the 
DTG unbound fraction showed better correlation with albumin than AAG. 
DTG  is  present  in  CSF  at  levels  similar  to  the  unbound  concentration  in  plasma.  Median  DTG 
concentrations in CSF were 18 ng/mL at Week 2 and 13 ng/mL at Week 16 in 13 HIV-1 infected male 
subjects receiving DTG (50 mg) + abacavir/lamivudine (600/300 mg) once daily.  Ratios of DTG CSF to 
total  plasma  concentration  were  similar  to  the  unbound  fraction  of  DTG  in  plasma.    Median  changes 
from  baseline  in  CSF  (n  =  11)  and  plasma  (n  =  12)  HIV-1  RNA  were  -3.42  and  -3.04  log10  c/mL, 
respectively.  Nine of 11 subjects (82%) had plasma and CSF HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 c/mL and 10 of 
11 (91%) had CSF HIV-1 RNA levels < 2 c/mL at Week 16 [Letendre, 2014].  
DTG  is  present  in  the  female  and  male  genital  tract.  AUC  in  cervicovaginal  fluid,  cervical  tissue,  and 
vaginal tissue were 6% to 10% of that in corresponding plasma at steady state, and AUC in semen and 
rectal tissue were 7% and 17%, respectively, of that in corresponding plasma at steady state. 
Rilpivirine 
After  a  single  oral  dose  of  150  mg  14C-RPV  in  healthy  adults  (TMC278-C119),  the  blood-to-plasma 
ratios  of  total  14C-radioactivity  were  time-independent,  with  values  ranging  between  0.65  and  0.75, 
indicating  that  RPV  and  its  metabolites  were  not  distributed  to  blood  cells  to  any  significant  extent.  
The in vitro plasma protein binding of RPV, determined by equilibrium dialysis, was on average 99.7%, 
irrespective of the RPV concentration (10-3000 ng/mL).  RPV was extensively bound to human albumin 
and  to  a  lesser  extent  to  AAG.    The  blood-to-plasma  concentration  ratio  was  approximately  0.67, 
irrespective  of  the  RPV  concentration.    A  very  limited  fraction  of  RPV  was  distributed  to  the  plasma 
water  compartment  (0.003).  The  fraction  of  RPV  distributed  to  plasma  proteins  was  0.773  and  the 
fraction distributed to blood cells was 0.224.   
The distribution of RPV into compartments other than plasma (e.g. CSF or genital tract secretions) has 
not  been  evaluated  in  humans  by  the  applicant.    In  the  literature,  individual  RPV  CSF  concentrations 
were above the EC50 in 13 HIV-1 infected male subjects who switched from TDF + FTC + NVP (245 + 
200 + 400 mg) once daily to TDF + FTC + RPV (245 + 200 + 25 mg) once daily and above the EC90 in 
85% (11/13) of the subjects.  HIV-1 RNA in CSF remained undetectable (<5 copies/mL) in all patients 
through  60  days.    The  mean  plasma  RPV  trough  concentration  was  29.7 ng/mL  and  the  mean  RPV 
concentration in CSF was 0.8 ng/mL, representing a CSF/plasma ratio of 1.4% [Mora-Peris, 2014]. 
Elimination 
Excretion 
Dolutegravir 
Renal elimination of unchanged drug is low (<1% of the dose).  Following oral administration of a 14C-
DTG  in  a  suspension  formulation,  31% of  the total oral  dose  is excreted  in  the  urine,  represented by 
three  main  (M1,  M3,  M7)  and  other  minor  metabolites.    Sixty-four  percent  of  the  total  oral  dose  is 
recovered in the faeces, represented mainly by DTG (53% of total dose).  It is unknown if all or part of 
the  parent  compound  in  faeces  is  due  to  unabsorbed  drug  or  biliary  excretion  of  the  glucuronide 
conjugate,  which  can  be  converted  back  to  the  parent  compound  in  the  gut  lumen.    In  bile  duct-
cannulated  animals,  7%  of  the  administered  dose  was  recovered  as  DTG  in  rat  bile,  and  12%  in 
monkey bile; the percentage of administered drug recovered as DTG in faeces was similar for humans 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 39/109 
  
  
(64%)  and  monkeys  (59%),  and  higher  in  rats  (88%).    Other  notable  components  in  faeces  include 
metabolites M13 and M1 (<2% of total dose) (Study ING111853). 
DTG  has  a  terminal  half-life  of  ~14  hours  and  a  low  CL/F  of  0.56  L/hr  (Study  ING111853),  which 
represents  <2%  of  liver  plasma  flow;  therefore,  the  hepatic  extraction  ratio  is  low  (lower  than  2%).  
As CYP3A4 is a secondary route of elimination of DTG, the first-pass metabolism of DTG following oral 
dosing is expected to be very low. 
Rilpivirine 
A  mass-balance  trial  (TMC278-C119)  showed  that  most  of  the  14C-RPV-related  radioactivity  from  a 
single  150-mg  dose  administered  as  an  oral  solution  was  excreted  in  faeces.    At  168  hours  after 
dosing,  a  mean  of  85.1%  of  the  administered  radioactivity  was  recovered  in  faeces,  and  a  mean  of 
6.1% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine.  Unchanged RPV accounted for a mean 
of 25.5% of the dose in faeces.  Only trace amounts (<1%) of unchanged RPV were detected in urine. 
After  oral  administration  of  the  tablet  formulation,  the  Cmax  of  RPV  is  generally  achieved  within  4  to 
5 hours. The mean terminal elimination t 1/2 of RPV is approximately 45 hours. The mean apparent oral 
clearance (CL/F) ranged from 6.89 to 8.66 L/h. 
Metabolism 
Dolutegravir 
Following  oral  administration  of  20  mg  14C-DTG  in  humans,  unchanged  DTG  is  primarily  eliminated 
through  metabolism,  and  renal  elimination  of  unchanged  DTG  represents  less  than  1%  of  the  total 
dose  administered.    The  quantified  metabolites  in  humans  include  an  ether  glucuronide  of  DTG  (M3), 
an  N-dealkylation  metabolite  (M1),  a  product  from  oxidation  at  the  benzylic  carbon  (M7),  and  a 
product of oxidative defluorination with cysteine addition (M13).  M3 is the major metabolite observed 
in  urine,  and  represents  18.9%  of  the  total  dose  administered.    The  total  radioactivity  of  the 
metabolites  formed  through  oxidation  (M1,  M7,  and  M13)  that  are  recovered  in  urine  and  faeces 
accounts for approximately 9.7% (mean) of the total dose administered.  The enzymes responsible for 
the  formation  of  M3  are  UDP  glucuronosyl  transferase  UGT1A1  (major),  and  UGT1A3  and  UGT1A9 
(minor).  The enzyme responsible for forming M7 is CYP3A4, while the enzyme responsible for forming 
M13  is  unknown.    M1  is  formed  by  hydrolysis  of  M7.    Therefore,  UGT1A1  is  the  primary  route  of 
metabolism,  with  CYP3A4  as  a  secondary  metabolic  pathway  in  humans.    DTG  is  the  predominant 
circulating  compound  in  plasma,  representing  97%  of  plasma  total  radiocarbon,  while  M3  represents 
<2.4% (Study ING111853).  These human metabolites were observed in animals. 
The  primary  metabolite,  ether  glucuronide  of  DTG  (M3),  in  plasma  shows  formation  rate-limited 
elimination  following  oral  administration  of  DTG  (Study  ING113125).  Apparent  half-life  of  the  ether 
glucuronide in plasma is similar to the parent compound, DTG, and renal excretion is a primary route 
of elimination of this metabolite (Study ING113125). 
DTG and 11 metabolites were identified in pooled human urine. 
As CYP3A4 is a secondary route of elimination of DTG, the first-pass metabolism of DTG following oral 
dosing is expected to be very low. 
The primary metabolite, M3, is ether glucuronide of DTG, and is not expected to have antiviral activity.  
As M3 is presented at very low concentrations in plasma, it is not expected to exhibit pharmacological 
activity leading to toxicity.

Rilpivirine 
A  major  metabolic  pathway  of  RPV,  representing  the  main  in  vitro  biotransformation,  was  aromatic 
hydroxylation at the pyrimidinyl moiety (to metabolite 42), followed by glucuronidation (to metabolite 
25).  Another major metabolic pathway was aliphatic hydroxylation at one of the methyl groups of the 
cyanoethenyl-2,6-dimethylphenyl moiety (to metabolite 33), followed by dehydration to form a tricyclic 
metabolite (metabolite 27). 
The  metabolites  of  14C-RPV  were  determined  in  faeces,  urine,  and  plasma  collected  from  healthy 
adults  after  a  single  oral  dose  of  150  mg  14C-RPV  (TMC278-C119).  The  most  abundant  metabolite 
originated  from  oxidation  at  the  5-position  of  the  pyrimidinyl  moiety  (metabolite  42),  and  accounted 
for 16.1% of the RPV-related radioactivity in faeces.  Three other metabolites each accounted for 2.2 
to 3.0% of RPV. 
In urine, apart from the carboxylic acid metabolite (metabolite 30, 0.03%), the other metabolites were 
phase-2  metabolites  (glucuronides  or  glutathione  derived  conjugates)  including  2  glycine  conjugates 
(metabolites 13 and 14) and a mercapturic acid conjugate (metabolite 18). 
Unchanged drug accounted for the major part of the total radioactivity in plasma (76% based on Cmax, 
51% based on AUClast).  Several minor plasma metabolites were detected, including the glucuronide of 
RPV  (metabolite  15,  ~10.2%  of  the  sample  radioactivity),  the  tricyclic  metabolite  (metabolite  27, 
~9.7%  of  the  sample  radioactivity),  and  hydroxymethyl  RPV  (metabolite  33,  ~5.1%  of  the  sample 
radioactivity). 
The  primary  RPV  metabolism  was  mainly  catalyzed  by  CYP3A  enzymes,  which  play  the  major  role  in 
the biotransformation of RPV in vitro. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dolutegravir exhibited nonlinear pharmacokinetics with less than dose-proportional increases in plasma 
exposure from 2 to 100 mg. For rilpivirine less than dose proportional increase in exposure at higher 
doses was observed, which is likely due to the limited solubility of the substance. Since the applicant 
applied for only one dose strength of the FDC (50/25 mg) with no dose adjustment, the assessment of 
dose proportionality in patients was not considered essential. 
For  dolutegravir  no  time  dependent  pharmacokinetics  has  been  observed.  For  rilpivirine,  no  time 
dependency  was  obvious.  Based  on  interaction  data  for  rilpivirine,  limited  induction  is  expected  at  a 
dose of 25 mg.  
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
After administration of the Dolutegravir/Rilpivirine HCl 50/25 mg FDC tablet, an inter-subject variability 
is observed for dolutegravir of 24% for AUC(0-inf), 18% for Cmax and 23% for Cl/F and for rilpivirine 
of 40% for AUC(0-inf), 34% for Cmax and 49% for Cl/F (study 201676). 
The intra-subject variability is not evaluated.

Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
Dolutegravir: 
Renal  clearance  of  unchanged  active  substance  is  a  minor  pathway  of  elimination  for  dolutegravir.  A 
study of the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir was performed in subjects with severe renal impairment 
(CLcr  <30  ml/min)  and  matched  healthy  controls.  The  exposure  to  dolutegravir  was  decreased  by 
approximately  40%  in  subjects  with  severe  renal  impairment.  The  mechanism  for  the  decrease  is 
unknown.  No  dosage  adjustment  is  considered  necessary  for  patients  with  renal  impairment. 
Dolutegravir has not been studied in patients on dialysis, but as dolutegravir is highly bound to plasma 
proteins, it is unlikely that they will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis 
Rilpivirine: 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  rilpivirine  have  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  renal  insufficiency.  Renal 
elimination of rilpivirine is negligible. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate 
renal  impairment.  In  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  or  end-stage  renal  disease,  rilpivirine 
should  be  used  with  caution,  as  plasma  concentrations  may  be  increased  due  to  alteration  of  drug 
absorption,  distribution  and/or  metabolism  secondary  to  renal  dysfunction.  In  patients  with  severe 
renal  impairment  or  end-stage  renal  disease,  the  combination  of  rilpivirine  with  a  strong  CYP3A 
inhibitor should only be used if the benefit outweighs the risk. As rilpivirine is highly bound to plasma 
proteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 
Impaired hepatic function 
Dolutegravir: 
Dolutegravir  is  primarily  metabolized  and  eliminated  by  the  liver.  A  single  dose  of  50  mg  of 
dolutegravir  was  administered  to  8  subjects  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  class  B) 
and  to  8  matched  healthy  adult  controls.  While  the  total  dolutegravir  concentration  in  plasma  was 
similar,  a  1.5-  to  2-fold  increase  in  unbound  exposure  to  dolutegravir  was  observed  in  subjects  with 
moderate  hepatic  impairment  compared  to  healthy  controls.  No  dosage  adjustment  is  considered 
necessary  for  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  hepatic  impairment.  The  effect  of  severe  hepatic 
impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Tivicay has not been studied. 
Rilpivirine: 
Rilpivirine  is  primarily  metabolised  and  eliminated  by  the  liver.  In  a  study  comparing  8  patients  with 
mild  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  score  A)  to  8  matched  controls,  and  8  patients  with  moderate 
hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  score  B)  to  8  matched  controls,  the  multiple  dose  exposure  of 
rilpivirine  was  47%  higher  in  patients  with  mild  hepatic  impairment  and  5%  higher  in  patients  with 
moderate  hepatic  impairment.  However,  it  may  not  be  excluded  that  the  pharmacologically  active, 
unbound, rilpivirine exposure is significantly increased in moderate hepatic impairment. 
No dose adjustment is suggested but caution is advised in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 
Rilpivirine  has  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  score  C). 
Therefore, rilpivirine is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

Gender 
No  clinically  relevant  differences  in  the  pharmacokinetics  of  dolutegravir  and  rilpivirine  have  been 
observed between men and women. 
Race 
Population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  of  dolutegravir  and  rilpivirine  in  HIV  infected  patients  indicated 
that race had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure to dolutegravir and rilpivirine. 
Elderly 
Population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  of  dolutegravir and  rilpivirine  using  data  in  HIV-1  infected  adults 
indicated  that  there  was  no  clinically  relevant  effect  of  age  on  dolutegravir or  rilpivirine  exposure.  Of 
note, pharmacokinetic data in subjects >65 years of age were limited. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Dolutegravir 
Dolutegravir is eliminated mainly through metabolism by UGT1A1. Dolutegravir is also a substrate of 
UGT1A3, UGT1A9, CYP3A4, Pgp, and BCRP; therefore medicinal products that induce those enzymes 
may decrease dolutegravir plasma concentration and reduce the therapeutic effect of dolutegravir. Co-
administration of dolutegravir and other medicinal products that inhibit these enzymes may increase 
dolutegravir plasma concentration 
In vitro, dolutegravir demonstrated no direct, or weak inhibition (IC50>50 μM) of the enzymes 
cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 CYP3A, uridine 
diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT)1A1 or UGT2B7, or the transporters Pgp, BCRP, BSEP, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, MATE2-K, MRP2 or MRP4. In vitro, dolutegravir did not induce CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. Based on this data, dolutegravir is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of 
medicinal products that are substrates of major enzymes or transporters. 
In vitro, dolutegravir was not a substrate of human OATP 1B1, OATP 1B3 or OCT 1. 
Rilpivirine 
Rilpivirine is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A. Medicinal products that induce or 
inhibit CYP3A may thus affect the clearance of rilpivirine. Co-administration of rilpivirine and medicinal 
products that induce CYP3A has been observed to decrease the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine, 
which could reduce the therapeutic effect of rilpivirine. 
Co-administration of rilpivirine and medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A has been observed to 
increase the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine. 
Co-administration of rilpivirine with medicinal products that increase gastric pH may result in 
decreased plasma concentrations of rilpivirine which could potentially reduce the therapeutic effect of 
rilpivirine.

Dolutegravir and rilpivirine  
The interaction between dolutegravir and rilpivirine was evaluated in study LAI116181.  
Study LAI116181 
Study Title: A Phase 1, Open-Label, Crossover Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of 
GSK1265744 and Rilpivirine and Dolutegravir and Rilpivirine in Healthy Adult Subjects 
This was a single-center, two-cohort, open-label, three-period, fixed-sequence cross over study in 
healthy adult subjects. In Cohort 1, 16 healthy volunteers, 2 females and 14 males, aged 18 - 50 
years, received dolutegravir 50 mg every 24 hours (q24h) for 5 days (Treatment A) followed by a 7 
day washout period. Subjects were then administered rilpivirine 25 mg q24h for 11 days (Treatment 
B), followed by dolutegravir 50 mg q24h in combination with rilpivirine 25 mg q24h for 5 days 
(Treatment C). All doses were administered within 30 minutes after the start of a moderate fat meal. 
Blood samples were taken over 24 h at the end of each treatment. All subjects completed the study. 
The pharmacokinetic results are shown in Table 6 and 7.

The results of this study support the concomitant use of DTG and RPV from a pharmacokinetic 
perspective.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Dolutegravir inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand 
transfer step of retroviral Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integration which is essential for the HIV 
replication cycle. 
Rilpivirine is a diarylpyrimidine NNRTI of HIV-1. Rilpivirine activity is mediated by non-competitive 
inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). 
Primary pharmacology 
Dolutegravir 
DTG is a second generation integrase inhibitor demonstrating antiviral activity at nanomolar levels to 
HIV 1 of various strains and subtypes (IC50 0.22 to 1.07 nM) and HIV-2 (0.29 nM). The activity of DTG 
is reduced 75-fold in the presence of 100% serum (extrapolated; IC50 38 nM). The selectivity index 
for DTG is >9400. When tested against other viruses, DTG did not exhibit significant antiviral activity. 
Drug combination analysis of DTG with other ARV drugs resulted in additive or synergistic effects.  
Only few substitutions conferring minor FCs on DTG susceptibility in vitro were selected in WT HIV-1 
(112 days, increasing concentration of DTG): S153Y and S153 F (4.1 FC), E92Q (3.1 FC), and G193E 
(3.2 FC), underscoring the relatively high resistance barrier of DTG. However, when starting with Q148 
mutants this barrier was broken down due to selection of further mutations conferring a substantial 
increase in FC (47 to190). Presence of the double mutations G140/Q148 lead to the selection of further 
mutations conferring decrease in antiviral activity: N155H (FC 85-120), E92Q (FC >110), L74M (FC 15 
to 95). The clinical isolates analysis of subtype B mutation R263K and G118R found that FCs for G118R 
varied from 2.5 to 11.2 while R263K had no effect on DTG activity, although selected in 2 ART

experienced, INI naive patients. In vitro DTG retained activity (<10 FC) against 94% of 704 RAL 
resistant clinical isolates and was also active against 91% of Q148+1 and 73% of Q148+≥2 INSTI-
resistance mutations.  
In the clinical studies of treatment-naïve patients, no cases of treatment emergent resistance to the 
IN- or NRTI-class were seen in DTG-treated subjects failing therapy. In treatment-experienced, INI 
naïve subjects, the IN resistance mutations T97, E138, and polymorphic V151, and R263 emerged 
without conferring phenotypic resistance (FC <2.5). This finding supports the in vitro data 
demonstrating that considerable phenotypic resistance for DTG is only seen when Q148 +≥2 INSTI-
RAMs are present while single mutations in IN seem not to confer resistance to DTG. 
Rilpivirine  
RPV is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and exhibits low nanomolar activity for various 
strains and subtypes (EC50 0.07 to 1.01 nM); the median EC50 in PBMCs against all HIV-1 primary 
clinical isolates tested was 0.26 nM. The selectivity index for RPV in MT4-cells is >8000. The antiviral 
activity against HIV-2 is less pronounced (5.22 µM). In human serum the antiviral activity of RPV is 
considerably reduced (19-fold) due to high protein binding (99%). RPV has no antiviral activity against 
various human viruses other than HIV. 
A large-scale evaluation of the antiviral activity of RPV was done in vitro on a panel of 4,786 HIV-1 
clinical isolates resistant to a first-generation NNRTI (FC > 2.5 to EFV or NVP). The results show that 
62% of these HIV-1 clinical isolates retained sensitivity to RPV or ETR (as compared to 11.3% to EFV 
and 4.6% to NVP).  
When testing the antiviral activity of RPV against 216 HIV-1 SDMs containing single, double, triple and 
quadruple RT mutations, RPV retained activity against 63% of all mutants and 96% of single RAMs; 
only RAMs K101P, Y181I/V conferred resistance to RPV (FCs of 51.7, 15.3 and 12.2, respectively) but 
are uncommon in NNRTI-experienced patients (2.04%, 1.05%, 0.63% of>100,000 clinical isolates 
analysed). Cross-resistance was observed between RPV, EFV and NVP. 
Although it was demonstrated in vitro that single mutations could lead to notable changes of FC, in 
vivo this effect was not found. Here, treatment-emergent mutations associated with considerable RPV 
FCs consisted of NNRTI + NRTI RAMs, often E138K + M184I or K101E + M184I/V, conferring a FC of 8. 
Baseline viral load >100.000 c/mL seems to influence RPV viral failure and incidence of treatment-
emergent RAMs while it does not affect the resistance profile itself. This finding is reflected in the 
indication of Juluca as only virologically suppressed patients are included. Considering the in vitro and 
in vivo data, the following RAMs, when present at baseline, may affect the activity of RPV: K101E/P, 
E138A/G/ K/Q/R, V179L, Y181C/I/V, Y188L, H221Y, F227C, M230I/L. 
Cross-resistance is seen in vivo and vitro for RPV and other NNRTIs and could be of relevance for 
patients pre-treated with etravirine, efavirenz and to a lesser extend withnevirapine. The indication 
includes only patients without known or suspected resistance to the NNRTI class. 
RPV + DTG  
The pivotal studies 201636 and 201637 demonstrated that treatment of HIV 1 infected patients with 
HIV-1 <50 c/ml on cART when switching to DTG+RPV did not lead to increased virologic failure 
compared to continued treatment with CAR. In both studies very low level of virologic failures was 
observed (2 patients in each group for 201636, 1 patient on DTG+RPV and 3 patients on CAR in 
201637).  Overall, resistance mutations were seen only in 2 patients treated with DTG+RPV: K101K/E

in RT which was treatment-emergent (due to non-adherence) and G193E in IN which was already 
present at baseline. Both mutations did not confer reduced susceptibility to RPV or DTG. 
Secondary pharmacology 
DTG 50 mg component 
A  phase  I,  randomized,  partial-blind,  single-dose,  three-period,  crossover  thorough  QT  study 
(ING111856)  has  been  performed  to  investigate  the  effect  of  GSK1349572  (DTG)  on  cardiac 
repolarization as compared to placebo and moxifloxacin in healthy adult males and females. The main 
conclusion from this study was that DTG had no effect on cardiac repolarization at a supra-therapeutic 
dose of 250 mg suspension. The study was sensitive enough to detect the effect of moxifloxacin, the 
positive control, on QTcF, which confirmed that this study was valid for assessing the effects of DTG on 
cardiac repolarization. 
RPV 25 mg component 
There is limited information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction between RPV 
and  drugs  that  prolong  the  QTc  interval  in  the  electrocardiogram.  In  a  study  of  healthy  subjects 
(C131),  supratherapeutic  doses  of  rilpivirine  (75  mg  once  daily  and  300  mg  once  daily)  have  been 
shown to prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram; this was not observed with the RPV 25 mg 
dose (C152). RPV should be used with caution when co-administered with a drug with a known risk of 
torsades de pointes. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Apart from studies 201674 and 201676, all pharmacokinetic studies were performed with DTG and RPV 
as single entities only.  
ADME as well as the interaction profiles of DTG and RPV, the individual components of the FDC, have 
been well characterized. 
Based on the interactions study LAI116181 no clinically relevant drug-drug interactions between DTG 
and RPV were reported.  
The relative BA study 201674 showed a difference in the relevant PK parameters of RPV of different 
FDC formulations when administered after a moderate or high fat meal, particularly for the FDC “AM” 
which is claimed to be similar to the formulation “AW” used in the pivotal BE-study 201676. AUC and 
Cmax were higher under high-fat meal conditions as compared to moderate-fat meal conditions. The 
pivotal BE study 201676, which served as the bridge to the clinical efficacy and safety data, was 
conducted under moderate fat conditions as the applicant claims that these are more representative of 
a typical diet in the HIV-infected population.  The CHMP concluded that the use of a moderate fat meal 
in the pivotal bioequivalence study as sufficiently sensitive and discriminatory to detect a difference 
between formulations. 
Virological failure and subsequent development of drug resistance mutations seems to be infrequent in 
the DTG+RPV arms of the SWORD studies, which is reassuring. However, a re-analysis using deep-
sequencing techniques should be performed for all subjects with confirmed or suspected virological 
failure in order to confirm the absence of additional resistance associated mutations in subjects failing 
on DTG+RPV.

Persistence of HIV replication in sanctuary sites can occur despite undetectable viraemia in plasma, 
and this could be more pronounced with dual than with triple therapy. Viral replication in sanctuary 
sites has been associated with persistent systemic inflammation, immune activation and with 
accelerating neurocognitive dysfunction. As a consequence, neurocognitive dysfunction will be 
monitored post-authorisation. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of DTG and RPV as fixed dose combination tablet has been sufficiently 
characterized. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The  efficacy,  safety  and  tolerability  of  the  treatment  regimen  of  DTG  50  mg  /  RPV  25  mg  is  being 
evaluated  in  2  pivotal,  identical,  ongoing,  randomized,  parallel  group,  148-week,  Phase  III  studies 
(201636 [SWORD-1] and 201637 [SWORD-2]). In addition, a safety study for the assessment of bone 
mineral density (BMD) in  a subset of subjects in the 201636 and 201637 studies is being conducted. 
Supportive data on DTG and RPV was provided from the single entity development programs.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Dolutegravir (study ING112276): No major difference in efficacy was seen for the different doses of 
dolutegravir. A numerically higher relapse rate was seen with the lowest dose of dolutegravir than with 
the 50 mg dose. Dolutegravir trough concentration for a single 50 mg dose in integrase inhibitor naïve 
subjects was 1.20 µg/mL; around 20 times higher than the estimated protein adjusted IC90 for WT 
virus. As no major differences were observed with respect to adverse events between the investigated 
doses, 50 mg DTG/d was selected as the dose to be further investigated in INSTI-naïve patients.  
Rilpivirine (study TMC278-C204): A dose-response relationship could not be demonstrated. However, 
initially the 75 mg q.d. dose was selected for the Phase III trials and further development of rilpivirine 
because, though not statistically significant, the proportion of virologic failures in the RPV 25 mg q.d. 
group was 8.6% compared to 5.3% and 6.6% in the 75 mg q.d. and 150 mg q.d. dose groups,

respectively. Furthermore, there was a trend towards lower efficacy of the 25 mg q.d group among 
those with a high baseline viral load. Later, data became available demonstrating a possible dose-
response relationship with respect to QT-prolongation.  
A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between change from baseline in QTcF 
interval and exposure (AUC24h) to rilpivirine (p < 0.001). Thus rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. formulation was 
finally chosen for further evaluation in phase III studies as well as the prolonged arm of this phase IIb 
study. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The DTG+RPV development programme consisted of a 2-drug, “NRTI-sparing” regimen for the 
treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults who are virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) 
without known or suspected resistance to either antiretroviral component. The main studies for this 
application are Study 201636 (SWORD-1) and Study 201637 (SWORD-2). Both are identical 148-week, 
Phase III, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group, non-inferiority 
studies. These are ongoing studies, conducted in 508 (study 201636) and 516 (study 201637) adult 
HIV-1 infected patients who are on stable suppressive cART containing 2 NRTIs (Nucleoside and 
nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors) plus either an INSTI (integrase strand transfer inhibitor), 
an NNRTI (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor), or a PI (protease inhibitor).

Any prior switch, defined as a change of a single drug or multiple drugs simultaneously, must have 
occurred due to tolerability and/or safety concerns or access to medications, or convenience / 
simplification. Also, any current or prior use of etravirine was not allowed. Subjects included in the 
pivotal studies were on cART since a median time of approximately 4.5 years (range 8 - 270 months). 
Treatments 
Following randomization patients were assigned to DTG + RPV or to remain on their CAR for the first 
52 weeks of the study.

Objectives 
Primary Objective 
To  demonstrate  the  non-inferior  antiviral  activity  of  switching  to  DTG  +  RPV  once  daily  compared  to 
continuation of CAR over 48 weeks in HIV-1 infected ART experienced subjects. 
Secondary Objectives 
•  To  evaluate  the  immunological  and  antiviral  activity  of  DTG  +  RPV  once  daily  compared  to 
continuation of CAR; 
•  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of DTG + RPV compared to continuation of CAR over time; 
•  To  evaluate  renal  (in  urine  and  blood),  bone  (in  blood),  cardiovascular  biomarkers  (in  blood)  and 
fasting lipids over time in subjects treated with DTG + RPV compared to continuation of CAR; 
•  To assess viral resistance in subjects that met Virologic Withdrawal Criteria; 
•  To evaluate DTG and RPV trough concentrations and over time during the initial post-switch period 
in the first 20 subjects who switched from EFV or NVP to DTG + RPV; 
•  To  assess  the  impact  of  Baseline  third  agent  treatment  class  (INSTI,  NNRTI,  or  PI)  on  efficacy, 
safety and tolerability of DTG + RPV compared to continuation of CAR; 
•  To assess and compare treatment satisfaction and change in treatment symptom index for the two 
treatment groups 
Exploratory Objectives 
•  To assess change in health-related quality-of-life, willingness to switch, and change in adherence  
•  To  evaluate  the  effect  of  patient  characteristics  (e.g.,  demographic  factors,  Baseline  CD4+)  on 
antiviral and immunological responses to DTG + RPV compared to continuation of CAR 
•  To evaluate the effects of TDF on the change in eGFR using cystatin C and other renal biomarkers in 
subjects  treated  with  DTG  +  RPV  compared  with  continuation  of  TDF-containing  CAR  in  the  Early 
Switch Phase 
•  To evaluate the longer term antiviral/immunological effects, safety and tolerability of DTG + RPV in 
both, patients switching early or late. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  <50  c/mL  at  Week  48 
using  the  Snapshot  algorithm  for  the  ITT-E  Population.  Hypothesis  testing  was  performed  to  confirm 
that maintenance of the suppression of HIV-1 replication by DTG + RPV would be non-inferior to that 
observed in the CAR arm of the study through Week 48.  
A  sub-study,  202094  (DEXA),  is  also  being  conducted  to  evaluate  any  change  from  Baseline  in  bone 
mineral  density  in  subjects  enrolled  in  either  of  the  201636  or  201637  studies  following  the  switch 
from a triple ART regimen containing TDF to DTG + RPV. 
The  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  for  this  study  included  change  from  Baseline  in  CD4+  lymphocyte 
counts  and  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  <50  c/mL  at  Week  24.  These  efficacy 
endpoints were also assessed by Baseline third agent class. 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 51/109 
  
  
Safety endpoints included incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities, 
the  proportion  of  subjects  who  discontinued  treatment  due  to  AEs,  changes  from  Baseline  in  renal, 
bone,  cardiovascular  biomarkers,  and  change  from  Baseline  in  fasting  lipids.  These  safety  endpoints 
were also assessed by Baseline third agent class. 
The virology endpoint was the incidence of observed genotypic and phenotypic resistance to CAR and 
to DTG or RPV for subjects meeting Virologic Withdrawal Criteria. This endpoint was also assessed by 
Baseline third agent class.  
PK  endpoints  included  pre-dose  concentrations  of  DTG  and  RPV  at  Weeks  4,  24,  48,  56,  76,  100,  or 
Withdrawal  in  subjects  switching  to  DTG  +  RPV.  In  addition,  pre-dose  samples  of  DTG  and  RPV 
concentrations were collected at Weeks 2, 4, and 8 in the first 20 subjects who switched from EFV or 
NVP to DTG + RPV. 
Health outcomes endpoints included change from Baseline in pre-specified treatment symptoms (using 
the Symptom Distress Module [SDM]) at Weeks 4, 24, 48, 56, 76, 100, and 148 (or Withdrawal), and 
treatment satisfaction as assessed by the HIV treatment satisfaction questionnaire (HIVTSQ) at Weeks 
4, 24, 48, 56, 76, 100, and 148 (or withdrawal from the study). 
Sample size 
Non-inferiority  of  DTG+RPV  versus  CAR  could  be  concluded  if  the  lower  bound  of  a  2-sided  95% 
confidence interval for the difference in response rates between the 2 treatment arms was greater than 
-10%. If rg is the response rate on DTG + RPV and rr is the response rate on comparator arm then the 
hypothesis can be as follows: 
H0: rg –  rr ≤ -10%    H1: rg –  rr > -10% 
Assuming for each of the two studies a true 87% response rate in each arm, a non-inferiority margin 
of -10%, and a 2.5% one-sided significance level, this study requires 238 subjects per treatment arm 
(per study). This would provide 90% power to show non-inferiority for the proportion of subjects with 
plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 48. If we observe an 87% response rate for the CAR arm then 
non-inferiority would be declared if the observed treatment difference was better than -3.5 percentage 
points.  
Under  the  same  assumptions  described  above,  the pooled  data  from  the  studies  201636  and 201637 
provided  >90%  power  to  show  non-inferiority  for  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  plasma  HIV-1  RNA 
<50 c/mL at Week 48 using a non-inferiority margin of -8%. 
Study  recruitment  was  extended  beyond  the  476  subjects  per  study  to  allow  for  further  recruitment 
into the DEXA sub-study, particularly in underrepresented populations.  
The  final  sample  size  was  increased  in  order  to  recruit  at  least  100  subjects  who  would  consent  to 
participate in the follow-up 202094 sub-study to achieve 77% power in that study. 
Randomisation 
Randomization and study treatment assignment was facilitated by the interactive response technology 
(IRT)  through  the  central  Randomization  and  Medication  Ordering  System  Next  Generation  (RAMOS 
NG). After a screening period of up to 28 days eligible subjects were registered using RAMOS NG and 
randomised  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  DTG  +  RPV  or  to  remain  on  their  CAR  through  Week  52,  in  accordance 
with the computer generated randomization schedule. Subject randomization was stratified by Baseline 
Assessment report

Page 52/109 
  
  
third agent class (INSTI, NNRTI, or PI), age group (< or ≥ 50 years old), and planned participation in 
the DEXA substudy. 
At  Week  52,  subjects  who  were  originally  randomly  assigned  to  continue  their  CAR  and  who 
maintained viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL), were switched to DTG + RPV once daily and were 
followed  until  Week  148.  Subjects  initially  randomly  assigned  to  receive  DTG  +  RPV  during  the  Early 
Switch Phase continued on that treatment arm through Week 148. 
Blinding (masking) 
Administration  of  DTG  +  RPV  and  CAR  was  in  an  open-label  fashion  throughout  the  study.  A  double-
dummy design was not undertaken given the diversity of the comparator regimens, and the logistical 
challenges  of  providing  blinding  for  each  regimen,  and  the  marked  increase  in  pill  burden  that  would 
result  from  this  blinding.  This  marked  increase  in  pill  burden  could  both  substantially  hinder 
compliance, and discourage subject enrolment. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The  ITT  population  consisted  of  all  randomised  subjects.  Subjects  were  assessed  according  to  their 
randomised treatment even if no study treatment was taken or the wrong treatment was received. 
Efficacy  analyses  were  conducted  based  on  the  ITT-E  population,  which  consisted  of  all  randomly 
assigned subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. Subjects were assessed according to 
their randomised treatment, regardless of the treatment they received.  
The PP population was defined as subjects in the ITT-E population with the exception of major protocol 
violators: e.g. violations which could have affected the assessment of antiviral activity, or where study 
drug compliance was known to be less than 90%. 
Primary analysis 
Primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50  c/mL at Week 48 using 
the Snapshot algorithm for the ITT-E Population. 
The Snapshot algorithm as recommended by US FDA is a detailed algorithm to determine a subject’s 
response  in  in  a  time  interval  of  interest  (i.e.,  ‘Virologic  Success’,  ‘Virologic  Failure’,  or  ‘No  Virologic 
Data  at  Week  X’).  The  Snapshot  algorithm  treats  all  subjects  without  HIV-1  RNA  data  at  the  visit  of 
interest, due to missing data or discontinuation of the investigational product prior to the visit window, 
as  non-responders.  Additionally,  since  changes  in  ART  were  not  permitted  in  the  pivotal  studies,  all 
subjects  who  changed  ART  were  considered  non-responders.  Otherwise,  virologic  success  or  failure 
was determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA assessment while the subject was on treatment. 
For the primary endpoint comparison, a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test with strata for age (< 50 
vs.  ≥50  years)  and  baseline  third  agent  class  (PI,  NNRTI,  INI)  was  used.  Adjusted  estimates  of  the 
difference  in  the  rate  of  responders  between  the  two  treatment  arms  were  calculated  together  with 
two-sided  95%  confidence  intervals  based  on  a  stratified  analysis  using  CMH  weights.  The  CMH 
estimate  of  the  common  difference  in  rates  across  strata  was  calculated  as  the  weighted  average  of 
the strata-specific estimates of the difference in response rates between the 2 treatment groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 53/109 
  
  
Non-inferiority was to be concluded if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the 
CMH  adjusted  difference  in  the  proportion  of  patients  who  respond  in  the  DTG+RPV  group  minus  the 
proportion  of  patients  who  respond  in  the  CAR  group  is  greater  than  -10%  for  the  within  study 
analysis,  and  greater  than  -8%  for the  pooled  analysis.  The  primary  statistical  analysis  was  repeated 
using the Per-protocol population and was compared for consistency with the results from the primary 
ITT-E population analysis. If both analyses would show non-inferiority the hypothesis that the antiviral 
effect of treatment with DTG+RPV is superior to treatment with CAR was to be tested at the two-sided 
5% level of significance. 
Non-inferiority margin 
The non-inferiority margin of -10% applied in the pivotal studies could not be justified on a statistical 
basis due to the large number of comparator regimens in the study and the lack of placebo comparison 
data for many of the regimens. A non-inferiority margin -10% is a reasonable non-inferiority margin in 
order to demonstrate adequate preservation of treatment effect. In addition, data from the two studies 
with  the  same  design  were  combined  to  assess  non-inferiority  at  -8%  to  support  regulatory 
assessment. 
After  the  protocol  was  approved,  the  FDA  updated  their  guidance  on  the  choice  of  primary  endpoint 
and associated non-inferiority margin for switch trials. Therefore, a secondary endpoint comparing the 
snapshot virological failure response rates between the DTG + RPV and CAR groups assessed using a 
NI  margin  of  4%  was  included.  Given  that previous  switch  studies  have  shown  a  snapshot  virological 
failure rate of between 1% and 3%, this NI margin was considered stringent for this endpoint. 
Assessment of homogeneity of results in subgroups 
Weighted  least  squares  chi-squared  statistic  according  to  the  textbook  by  Fleiss  JL  (Wiley  1981)  was 
used to test for homogeneity across the levels of categorical variables as one-way test with variables 
considered separately. Following the method proposed by Lui KJ and Kelly C (Biometrics 2000), a value 
of  one  half  was  added  to  each  cell  in  any  strata  for  which  the  stratum-specific  rate  estimates  of 
response rates in the new treatment or control arm were zero. Homogeneity tests were performed as 
one-sided  tests.  Any  heterogeneity  found  to  be  statistically  significant  was  to  be  explored  and  if 
necessary  results  were  to  be  reported  for  each  level  of  the  categorical  variable.  Investigation  of 
heterogeneity  was  confined  to  the  primary  endpoint  using  the  Week  48  Snapshot  analysis.  Tests  of 
homogeneity were assessed at one-sided 10% alpha level. 
Additionally, exploratory analyses for subgroup factors (age, race, gender, country, baseline CD4+ cell 
count,  CDC  center  category,  baseline  vitamin  D,  baseline  calcium,  baseline  smoking,  baseline  alcohol 
consumption,  baseline  BMI,  duration  of  prior  TDF  expose)  were  performed,  partly  in  the  DEXA  sub-
study  patients.  Unadjusted  difference  in  proportions  between  treatment  groups  and  corresponding 
two-sided 95% CI are presented by subgroup. In case of a statistical interaction, a summary of study 
outcomes by subgroup is presented. 
Secondary analyses 
Secondary  analyses  of  efficacy  data  included  a  repeat  of  the  primary  snapshot  analysis  as  described 
above  at  Week  24  (conducted  at  the  primary  Week  48  analysis  time  point)  and  an  analysis  of  the 
difference  in  the  snapshot  virological  failures  using  a  4%  non-inferiority  margin.  Confidence  intervals 
for the difference between the treatment arms in the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL 
at Week 48 using a snapshot analysis are also presented by baseline third agent class. The proportion 
Assessment report

Page 54/109 
  
  
of  subjects  without  virologic  (ERDF)  or  virologic/tolerability  (TRDF)  failure  was  estimated  using  the 
Kaplan-Meier  nonparametric  method  based  on  the  time  to  CVW  or  treatment  related/efficacy  related 
discontinuation  (i.e.,  drug-related  AE,  protocol  defined  safety  stopping  criteria,  or  lack  of  efficacy). 
Subjects  who  had  not  met  CVW  criteria  and  were  ongoing  in  the  study,  or  who  had  discontinued  for 
reasons  other  than  those  related  to  treatment/lack  of  efficacy,  were  censored.  The  estimate  of  the 
standard  error  used  to  derive  CIs  for  the  difference  in  proportions  between  treatment  groups  was 
based on Greenwood’s formula (Kalbfleisch JD and Prentice RL, Wiley 1980). The estimated proportion 
of  subjects  without  CVW  and  not  discontinued  due  to  treatment  related/efficacy  related  reasons  at 
Week  48  was  presented  by  treatment  group,  along  with  estimated  difference  in  proportions  between 
treatment groups and its associated 2-sided 95% CI. 
Interim analysis 
An interim analysis was performed for the IDMC to evaluate the efficacy of DTG + RPV prior to the final 
analysis  with  a  futility  rule,  details  of  assessment  and  operating  characteristics  pre-specified  in  the 
IDMC Charter. The interim futility analysis was performed approximately 9 months after “first subject 
first visit”. The sponsor remained blinded to this analysis.  
The  main  analysis  of  the  pivotal  studies  was  conducted  to  evaluate  the  primary  objective  of  the 
protocol when all subjects completed their Week 48 visit. Additional analyses  will be conducted when 
all subjects have either prematurely withdrawn from the study or completed the study by transitioning 
to commercial supplies.  
DEXA Analyses 
For the population in the DEXA substudy, analyses of total hip BMD assessed by areal density (g/cm2) 
were performed at Week 48 and subgroup analyses for total hip BMD by subgroup were provided.

Recruitment 
Study 201636 (SWORD-1): First Subject First Visit: 14 April 2015, ongoing study.  
Last  Subject  Last  Visit  for  Week  48  analysis:  16  September  2016.  The  data  cut-off  for  the  Week  48 
analysis was 22 November 2016. 
Study 201637 (SWORD-2): First Subject First Visit: 21 April 2015, ongoing study.  
Last  Subject  Last  Visit  for  Week  48  analysis:  16  September  2016.  The  data  cut-off  for  the  Week  48 
analysis was 22 November 2016. 
A  total  of  513  subjects  were  randomized  (1:1)  to  receive  DTG  +  RPV  and  511  subjects  remained  on 
their  CAR.  Similar  proportions  of  subjects  in  each  treatment  group  withdrew  from  the  study  (6% 
compared  to  7%;  (Table  12).  The  most  common  reason  for  withdrawal  was  adverse  events  (DTG  + 
RPV: 3%; CAR: <1%). Less than 1% of subjects from both groups were withdrawn from the study due 
to investigator’s assessment of lack of efficacy

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
There  were  2  amendments  to  the  original  protocols  dated  3  November  2014  for  SWORD-1  and  -2. 
Amendment  No.  1  (26  February  2015)  was  implemented  prior  to  enrolment  of  any  subjects  in  the 
study  and  included  mainly  the  extra  stratification  factor  “planned  participation  in  the  Dexa  substudy” 
and  additional  PK  visits.  Amendment  No.  2  (8  June  2015)  was  implemented  following  study  initiation 
and  included  the  following  edits:  added  reasons  for  switch  for  PI-class  aligned  with  other  ART  class 
switches,  clarification  of  Exclusion  Criterion  10  in  relation  to  evidence  of  HBV  infection,  revisions  to 
stratified  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint,  revisions  to  Virologic  Withdrawal  Criteria,  and  minor 
clarifications and corrections of typographical errors. The risk mitigation strategy around rash and the 
requirement  to  discontinue  study  drug  following  observation  of  Grade  3  or  4  rash  were  revised  and 
clarified.

Protocol deviations 
In SWORD-1 and SWORD-2, 56 subjects (26 in DTG+RPV arm and 30 in CAR arm) and 58 subjects (30 
in DTG+RPV arm and 28 in CAR arm) respectively were excluded from the Per Protocol Population due 
to “important” protocol deviations. The most common important protocol deviations were not meeting 
eligibility criteria and taking prohibited medications.

Antiretroviral Therapy at Screening 
Antiretroviral  therapies  received  by  study  participants  at  Screening  constituted  CAR  for  subjects 
randomized  to  this  group  on  Day  1.  As  per  the  protocol  for  these  studies,  all  subjects  (100%)  were 
receiving  NRTIs  as  part  of  their  ART  regimen  at  screening.  The  most  commonly  reported  individual 
NRTIs were TDF (DTG + RPV: 73%; CAR: 70%) and FTC (DTG + RPV: 69%; CAR: 67%). 
In addition, 54% of subjects in both groups were receiving NNRTIs, 26% of subjects in the DTG + RPV 
group and 27% of subjects in the CAR group were receiving PIs, and 20% in the DTG + RPV group and 
19% of subjects in the CAR group were receiving INSTIs at screening. 
Furthermore,  these  studies  limited  the  enrolment  of  subjects  with  prior  exposure  to  DTG  or  RPV  to 
approximately  10%.  In  the  DTG  +  RPV  group,  6%  and  6%  of  subjects  were  receiving  DTG  or  RPV, 
respectively, at Screening. Similar percentages were noted in the CAR group (8% and 6% of subjects 
were receiving DTG or RPV, respectively). 
No patient on a regimen containing tenofovir alafenamide was included.

Numbers analysed 
Efficacy analyses were conducted based on the ITT-E population, which consisted of all randomly 
assigned subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. Subjects were assessed according to 
their randomized treatment, regardless of the treatment they received. 
The  ITT  population  consisted  of  all  randomized  subjects.  Subjects  were  assessed  according  to  their 
randomized treatment even if no study treatment was taken or the wrong treatment was received. 
The PP population was defined as subjects in the ITT-E population with the exception of major protocol 
violators: e.g. violations which could have affected the assessment of antiviral activity, or where study 
drug compliance was known to be less than 90%.

Outcomes and estimation 
The primary endpoint for both SWORD studies was the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA 
<50 c/ml at Week 48 using the Snapshot algorithm for the ITT-E population. 
Overall, 95% and 94% of subjects in the DTG + RPV group and 96% and 94% of subjects in the CAR 
group achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/ml at Week 48. The analysis 
demonstrated that DTG + RPV is non-inferior to CAR at Week 48 because the lower bound of the 95% 
CI for the adjusted treatment difference for the individual studies (-4.3% and -3.9% for SWORD-1 and 
-2, respectively) is greater than -10%. Also the pooled analysis demonstrated that DTG + RPV is non-
inferior  to  CAR  at  Week  48  because  the  lower  bound  of  the  95%  CI  for  the  adjusted  treatment 
difference (-3.0%) is greater than -8%. 
The  results  from  the  PP  population  were  consistent  with  those  from  the  ITT-E  (primary)  population 
(Table 12).

Secondary endpoints 
Virologic  response  rates  were  the  same  between  the  DTG  +  RPV  and  CAR  treatment  groups  (95%) 
(Table 13) 
For subjects in the Snapshot category of ‘No virologic data’, as would be expected in open-label switch 
studies,  there  were  fewer  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  or  death  in  the  CAR  group  (3  subjects)  where 
subjects have already taken at least 6 months of stable treatment, compared to the DTG + RPV group 
(17  subjects).  In  contrast  there  were  fewer disconnections  due  for  ‘Other’  reasons  in  the  DTG  +  RPV 
group  (7  subjects)  compared  with  the  CAR  group  (16  subjects).  Of  the  16  ‘Other  reasons’  for 
discontinuation in the CAR group, 5 withdrew consent, 6 had protocol deviations, 2 were lost to follow-
up, 2 relocated, and 1 cited burden of travel. Of the 7 ‘Other reasons’ for discontinuation in the DTG + 
RPV group, 3 withdrew consent, 2 relocated, 1 was lost to follow-up, and 1 became pregnant.

The  proportion  of  subjects  who  were  classified  as  Snapshot  virological  failures  at  Week  48  is 
summarized in Table 14. These results indicate that the combined use of DTG + RPV is non-inferior to 
CAR  based  on  snapshot  virologic  failure  with  a  non-inferiority  margin  of  4%.  The  upper  bound  of  the 
95% CI for the adjusted treatment difference (0.5%) is less than 4%.

Ancillary analyses 
To  assess  the  generalizability  of  the  primary  analysis  results,  consistency  of  the  treatment  difference 
was  explored  within  subgroups.  One-way  homogeneity  across  the  levels  of  each  variable  used  to

stratify  randomization  (age  group  [<  or  ≥  50  years  old]  and  Baseline  third  agent  class)  was  tested. 
One-way  homogeneity  across  the  levels  of  gender  and  two  categorizations  of  Race  (White  vs.  non-
White,  African  American/African  Heritage  vs.  non-African  American/African  Heritage)  was  also tested. 
In  addition,  potential  treatment-by-subgroup  interactions  were  considered  via  the  assessment  of 
summaries of the treatment differences across subgroups. 
Age Subgroup analyses 
Treatment differences across age subgroups support the primary endpoint. The test for heterogeneity 
for an effect of age on the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA <50 c/ml was statistically significant 
(p=0.091). This difference was driven by higher numbers of subjects in the “No Virologic Data at Week 
48”  category,  which  includes  subjects  who  were  withdrawn  due  to  both  the  subgroupings  of  “other 
reasons” and “AEs leading to discontinuation” in the <50 years of age subgroup compared to the ≥50 
years of age subgroup. This was not driven by a difference in virologic failure between the age groups.

Race Subgroup analyses 
Figure 7 shows the treatment difference across race subgroup categories.  
The test for heterogeneity for an effect of race for White versus Non-White subjects for the proportion 
of  subjects  with  HIV-1  RNA  <50  c/ml  was  statistically  significant  for  the  pooled  analysis  (p=0.058). 
This difference was also statistically significant for the 201637 study (p=0.06), but not for the 201636 
study (p=0.592). This difference is driven by the 99% response rate in the Non-White race subgroup 
within the DTG + RPV treatment group.

Hypothesis 
H0: rg – rr ≤ -10% H1: rg – rr > -10%. 
Each study is designed to show that the antiviral effect of a regimen 
of  DTG  +  RPV  is  non-inferior  to  standard  INI-,  NNRTI-,  or  PI-based 
ART  regimens  at  Week  48.  Non-inferiority  can  be  concluded  if  the 
lower bound of a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference 
in  response rates between  the  two  treatment  arms  is greater  than  -
10%; in the pooled analysis greater than - 8%.

the vast majority of results very much in line with each other, pooled data is shown under summary of 
main studies and in Table 22. These data were included in Table 3 of the SmPC.

Study  LAI116482  (LATTE)  is  an  ongoing  Phase  IIb  study  evaluating  the  utility  of  a  2-drug,  2-class 
combination of cabotegravir (CAB) + RPV once daily. Data from this study provided proof of principle 
for  RPV  combined  with  an  INSTI  as  an  effective  2-drug  regimen  for  the  maintenance  of  virologic 
suppression [Margolis, 2015]. A rapid and sustained response was observed across all CAB treatment

arms, with ≥ 80% of subjects achieving the primary endpoint of plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/ml by Week 
48. In addition, data at Week 96 (72 weeks on 2- drug therapy) showed that more subjects on CAB + 
RPV  remained  suppressed  (HIV-1  RNA  <50  c/ml)  compared  to  EFV  +2  NRTI  drugs  (CAB  Subtotal: 
76%; EFV: 63%). While the virologic response in the CAB 60 mg arm was numerically higher than the 
10 mg and 30 mg arms, the difference was driven primarily by low level viremia (data in window not 
below threshold) and non-virologic discontinuations (discontinuations for other reasons). Furthermore, 
there were fewer virologic non-responders using the Snapshot algorithm through Week 96 in the CAB 
arm compared to the EFV arm. These data indicate that a 2-drug regimen of RPV, in combination with 
an INSTI, can provide long-term efficacy.

SE study efficacy conclusions 
At Week 48, 88% of study participants on the DTG + ABC/3TC 
regimen were virologically suppressed (<50 c/mL) vs. 81% of 
participants on the single tablet regimen Atripla [difference and 
95% CI; 7.4% (+2.5% to +12.3%); difference in the primary 
endpoint was statistically significant, p=0.003]. 
At Week 96, 80% of study participants on the DTG + ABC/3TC 
regimen were virologically suppressed (<50 c/mL) vs. 72% of 
participants on the single tablet regimen Atripla [difference and 
95% CI; 8.0% (+2.3% to +13.8%); difference in the primary 
endpoint was statistically significant, [p=0.006]. Response rates on 
DTG+ ABC/3TC and Atripla were generally consistent across 
demographic subgroups, including race, gender, age, HIV risk 
factors, and Baseline CDC category. 
At Week 144, 71% of study participants in the DTG + ABC/3TC 
treatment group were virologically suppressed (<50 c/mL) versus 
63% of participants on the single tablet regimen of Atripla 
[adjusted difference and 95% CI; 8.3% (+2.0% to +14.6%); 
difference in the primary endpoint was statistically significant, 
[p=0.010]; therefore, statistical superiority at Week 144 was 
maintained. Differences in the Snapshot analysis were primarily 
driven by a lower rate of discontinuation due to AEs in the DTG + 
ABC/3TC treatment group. Response rates were similar between 
the DTG + ABC/3TC and the Atripla treatment groups across 
demographic subgroups, including race, gender, age, HIV risk 
factors, and Baseline CDC category. 
The longer term end-of-study data support the safety of DTG in 
combination with ABC/3TC once daily in an HIV infected treatment-
naive patient population. The majority of subjects receiving DTG + 
ABC/3TC FDC who entered the continuation phase past Week 144 
maintained viral suppression, based on an observed analysis. In 
the DTG + ABC/3TC FDC arm, antiviral response was sustained 
with 93% (193/207) of subjects with HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 
156 based on the observed data. The data from this completed 
study continue to support the use of DTG 50 mg + ABC/3TC once 
daily for the management of HIV infection in INSTI-naive subjects 
At Week 48, Data through 96 weeks support DTG 50 mg once daily 
for INSTI-naive subjects, and provide evidence for durable efficacy 
and tolerability for DTG in combination therapy. In this study, DTG 
has shown noninferior efficacy and a safety profile similar to RAL 
with no evidence of treatment emergent resistance in virologic 
failure. DTG administered once daily with 2 NRTIs demonstrated 
non-inferiority to RAL at Week 96 and was associated with good 
treatment response. DTG performed as well as RAL regardless of 
baseline viral load or background dual NRTI. DTG performed as 
well as RAL across demographic subgroups, including race, gender, 
age, HIV risk factors, Baseline CD4+ cell count and Baseline CDC 
category. At Week 96, DTG administered once daily with 2 NRTIs 
demonstrated non-inferiority to RAL at Week 96 and was 
associated with good treatment response. The proportion of 
subjects with HIV RNA <50 c/mL (81%) compared favorably with 
RAL (76%) through 96 weeks. DTG performed as well as RAL

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies  
Studies 201636/201637 
The development program for Juluca is primarily based on 2 identical pivotal Phase 3 studies (SWORD-
1  and  -2),  and  a  pivotal  BE  study  to  bridge  from  the  individual  components  administered  in  the 
SWORD studies to the fixed dose product intended for marketing. This is acceptable for this fixed-dose 
combination  tablet  consisting  of  two  known  active  substances.  No  new  dose  response  studies  have 
been  performed,  which  is  acceptable.  Clinical  data  from  study  LAI116181  showed  the  absence  of  a 
drug/drug  interaction  between  DTG  and  RPV  and  hence  that  there  is  no  need  for  a  dose  adjustment 
from approved doses when both products are used in combination. 
The  endpoints,  including  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  <50  c/ml  at  Week  48  as 
primary  efficacy  endpoint,  are  considered  relevant  and  acceptable.  As  the  pivotal  studies  are  switch 
studies,  conducted  in  subjects  who  are  virologically  suppressed,  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  were 
classified  as  Snapshot  virological  failure  at  Week  48  is  considered  the  most  relevant  endpoint  and  is 
therefore a main focus of the assessment. This type of study design is not specifically addressed in the 
CHMP guideline. CHMP, however the applicant obtained scientific advice on this matter. 
Randomisation was stratified according to age (<>50 years), as the upper age group is prone to age- 
related risks such as CVD and might benefit from less NRTI-mediated adverse events. 
Randomisation was also stratified according to class of third agent (NNRTI, PI, INSTI), which was 
considered appropriate. Exploratory analyses according to nucleos(t)ide backbone showed no 
differential outcome between the two study groups depending on nucleoside backbones used at 
baseline. 
The primary endpoint, proportion of subjects at Week 48 with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL, is a well-
established surrogate endpoint for antiviral efficacy and is in line with the recommendations of the 
relevant CHMP guideline. The primary analysis population was the ITT-E population with PP-analysis for 
consistency. Although the ITT-population would have been the preferred analysis population, the ITT-E 
was acceptable, as the factual difference in patient numbers between these two populations is very 
small. The secondary and other exploratory efficacy endpoints were also regarded as appropriate.  The 
study will continue for a total of 148 weeks and no comparative data versus CAR will be available after 
week 48, as all patients have switched to DTG+RPV thereafter.   
For the primary endpoint comparison, a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test with strata for age (< 50 vs. ≤ 
50 years) and baseline third agent class (PI, NNRTI, INI) was used. The statistical methods used for 
the primary analysis are considered adequate. Use of the stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test with 
additional analyses to assess the homogeneity of results in strata used for randomisation and 
subgroups was considered appropriate. Withdrawals were low and numerically similar in both 
treatment arms (about 6%). Withdrawal patterns showed that adverse events were the most common 
reason for study drop-out. The snapshot algorithm was used to determine virologic response; subjects 
with missing data or discontinuation of the investigational product were counted as non-responders. 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 72/109 
  
  
 
 
Changes in ART were not permitted in the pivotal studies and all subjects who changed ART were also 
considered as non-responders. 
The justification of the non-inferiority margin of -10% was considered acceptable. There was no formal 
interim analysis for efficacy. Procedures for the interim analyses for futility by an external IDMC were 
appropriate. 
Formal hypothesis testing for the additional secondary endpoint, rate of virological failures support the 
conclusions from the primary analysis. 
The combined Statistical Analysis Plan for the pivotal studies, covering the pivotal Week 48 analysis, a 
pooled analysis of studies 201636 and 201637 and a sequential analysis plan of data after the Week 
48 analysis until study completion were considered appropriate. Amendments to the study protocol had 
no important impact on the statistical analyses and conclusions 
A routine inspection of study 201636 was conducted and demonstrated the sites had a good level of 
GCP and protocol compliance.  
Study 201674 
In the relative BA study 201674 the bioavailability and the food effect of single doses of different 
prototype FDC DTG/RPV tablet formulations were investigated. To evaluate the food effect, PK data of 
different cohorts were compared. A direct comparison of the PK characteristics of the reference and 
test formulations under different food conditions would have been more appropriate for a reliable 
assessment.  
Study 201676 
The pivotal BE study 201676 which served as a bridge to the clinical efficacy and safety data compared 
the bioavailability of DTG and RPV when administered as FDC tablet with co-administration of the 
individual single entity products under moderate fat conditions.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses  
Studies 201636/201637 
For both studies the point estimates for the difference in the primary endpoint were very close to zero 
with a narrow confidence interval and lower boundaries of up to -4.1 for the individual studies 
(201636) and -2.9 for the pooled analysis. Hence, non-inferiority of DTG+RPV versus CAR was proven, 
not exploiting the predefined non-inferiority margins.  
Virological failures occurred at a very low percentage, in 3 patients in the DTG+RPV and 6 patients in 
the CAR-group, resulting in an adjusted difference in proportion of -0.5 (95% CI: -1.7; 0.6). 
Despite the long mean duration of prior antiretroviral therapy of approximately 5 years CD4+-cell 
counts increased over the course of the studies in both groups and a differential effect between studies 
were observed. When corrected for stratification factors this difference was no longer apparent. 
No subject in the CAR-group and 11 subjects in the DTG+RPV-group reported disease progression or 
recurrence of HIV-1 associated conditions. When disregarding the potentially non-objectively 
diagnosable events, i. e. constitutional symptoms and peripheral polyneuropathy, and otherwise 
confounded events one subject in the in the DTG+RPV group versus none in the CAR-group remain. 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 73/109 
  
  
Further information related to this matter should be provided with the Week 100 SWORD study update 
and during marketing surveillance. Subgroup analyses showed no relevant difference in efficacy for 
gender, race or according to (prior) third line agent.  
However, the dual regimen data indicated a better outcome with the dual regimen in younger age 
groups and in patients with less advanced disease (CDC category A or B), mainly due to more 
discontinuations due to adverse events in those >50 years of age and having CDC category C.  
Adherence to DTG+RPV was assessed according to self-reporting and no objective measure of 
treatment adherence was applied. In none of the PROMs a difference between the treatment groups 
was observed. Hence, the anticipated benefits in terms of efficacy of the dual regimen were not 
substantiated with the submitted data and remain currently theoretical. As only the single entities were 
studied, the study was not suitable for substantiating the assumed benefit of the FDC on adherence. 
A wide range of prior antiretroviral regimens was documented and no difference in efficacy was 
reported based on the baseline third agent used. This is considered reassuring in terms of 
generalizability of the results. However, the study population was highly preselected with respect to 
their therapeutic, virological and disease characteristics with a mean of 5 years of prior antiviral 
therapy, either on the first or second ARV regimen, with no ART change for virological/efficacy 
reasons, harbouring viruses with no evidence of any major PI, INSTI (including R263K), NRTI or NNRTI 
resistance mutation and being virologically suppressed for a minimum of 8 months. Further subgroup 
analyses according to prior ART-use and duration of virological suppression showed that 75% of the 
participants were on the first antiretroviral regimen and that the mean duration of use of the ART-
regimen at screening was almost 4 years. Moreover, relevant comorbidities, such as CHB-infection and 
co-medications were excluded.  
Self-reported adherence to study medications was – with intake of 98% of the doses- unusually high. 
It is not clear, if outside a study setting and in a less stringently selected population the regimen’s 
efficacy would be the same.  
Study 201674 and Study 201676 
The data indicate a difference in the relevant PK parameters of RPV of different FDC formulations when 
administered after a moderate or high fat meal, particularly for the FDC “AM” which is claimed to be 
similar to the formulation “AW” used in the pivotal BE study 201676. For formulation “AM” mean Cmax 
was 20% higher and mean AUC0-t was about 22% higher after a high-fat meal compared to a 
moderate-fat meal, while data generated during the development of RPV SE tablets PK parameters (of 
the 75 mg tablet) under moderate and high fat conditions did not indicate any relevant differences and 
were considered comparable. 
The CHMP concluded that the use of a moderate fat meal in the pivotal bioequivalence study as 
sufficiently sensitive and discriminatory to detect a difference between formulations. 
Special populations 
Children were excluded from the efficacy studies and a paediatric investigational plan is in place. While 
no upper age limit was set for the two SWORD studies and the oldest participant was 79 years old, 
only very few elderlies participated in these studies. Factually no data are available in HBV-co-infected 
patients. In total, only 28 patients with HCV-infection (not in immediate need of treatment) were 
included. Other relevant co-infection and comorbidities were either exclusion criteria or patients were

EMA/243517/2018 
Page 74/109 
  
  
 
not included due to the requirement of non-permitted co-medications.  This is reflected in the product 
information. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on the submitted data, the dual combination of DTG and RPV is similarly efficacious as 
maintenance antiretroviral therapy in patients with stable virological suppression without known or 
suspected resistance to any non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or integrase inhibitor.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety profile for DTG/RPV FDC is supported by two identical, ongoing, pivotal Phase III studies 
(201636 [SWORD-1] and 201637 [SWORD-2]) using DTG 50 mg + RPV 25 mg together as individual 
tablets. Additionally, a pivotal bioequivalence study in healthy adult volunteers (201676), a relative 
bioavailability study (201674) and a Phase I drug interaction study (LAI116181) were conducted. 
Furthermore, a dedicated DEXA sub-study was conducted (202094, ongoing, 48 week CSR completed) 
which enrolled subjects from the two Phase III clinical trials and is evaluating the change in bone 
mineral density of those subjects who have switched from a tenofovir containing regimen to DTG + 
RPV compared to those who remained on a tenofovir containing current regimen. 
Patient exposure 
Safety analyses were conducted based on the Safety Population, defined as all subjects who received 
at least 1 dose of study drug. The safety database consists of safety data from 1024 subjects (DTG + 
RPV 513; CAR 511) from the 2 identical Phase III studies 201636 and 201637 (pooled safety data are 
presented for those studies, cumulative through the Week 48 primary endpoint). The median time of 
exposure to DTG + RPV and CAR was 364 days (52 weeks). In the Early Switch Phase, a nearly equal 
number of patients were exposed for the whole 48 weeks of this study phase in the DTG + RPV and in 
the CAR group (483 (94 %) and 489 (95 %) respectively). 
The safety data package is in line with recommendations outlined in Guideline on the clinical 
development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infection and is therefore considered to be 
adequate. 
Adverse events 
Any AEs were observed in 77% of subjects in the DTG + RPV group and 71% in the CAR group during 
the Early Switch Phase (Table 20). The majority of events reported had an intensity of Grade 1 or 
Grade 2 for both treatment groups (Table 21). There was a greater proportion of subjects reporting 
drug-related events, Grade 2-4 AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, SAEs and drug-related SAEs in the 
DTG + RPV group compared with the CAR group. No drug-related fatal SAEs occurred in any subject on 
treatment. Imbalances in AE-rate become more obvious with increasing severity of the AEs.

Table 21.  Summary of Adverse Events by Maximum Toxicity during the Early Switch Phase for Study 
201636, Study 201637, and Pooled Data (Safety Population) 
The higher incidence of AEs in the DTG + RPV treatment group is most likely attributed to the open 
label and treatment switch design elements in Studies 201636 and 201637:  
Firstly, it can be assumed that many AEs occur at the beginning of therapy so that subjects on stable 
therapy (i.e. subjects in the CAR treatment group) will report less AEs than those randomised to a new 
therapy regimen (i.e. subjects in the DTG + RPV treatment group). Comparing subjects stable on CAR 
with subjects newly switched to DTG+RPV can therefore be expected to create a bias in favour of CAR. 
Secondly, it must be assumed that according to study inclusion criterion, 2 subjects with relevant AEs 
under their previous therapy have been switched to a better tolerated treatment for at least 6 months 
prior to Screening. Therefore, subjects in the CAR group most likely receive a well-tolerated therapy as 
subjects with more severe AEs are no longer included; this condition is not given in the DTG + RPV 
group. Again it can be expected that this creates a bias in favour of CAR. The observation, that more 
serious AEs (grade 3 and 4) seem more imbalanced than less serious AEs (grade 1 and 2), supports 
this view.  
Furthermore, most of the reported drug related events are well known and expected side effects of 
DTG and/or RPV and labelled in the corresponding SmPCs. The investigators were therefore aware 
about possible side effects of DTG and/or RPV. It is plausible, that the occurrence of those adverse

Page 76/109 
  
  
 
 
events in the DTG + RPV treatment arm will then be assessed as related to study treatment DTG + 
RPV by the investigators. 
For a more in depth assessment of possible additive effects when using DTG and RPV in combination 
the Applicant provided comparison between the incidences of adverse events for DTG + RPV co-
administered, and corresponding frequencies for those events for DTG and RPV given as single entities. 
Although it should be considered that a cross comparison between studies may be difficult e.g. 
because of different study populations, it can be overall concluded that based on the data provided 
additive side effects seem to be unlikely.  
A comparison of AE incidences between the Late Switch DTG + RPV subjects and the Early Switch DTG 
+ RPV Subjects to further support the assumption that the higher incidence of AEs in the DTG + RPV 
treatment group compared to CAR is most likely attributed to the open label nature and the treatment 
switch design, elements in Studies 201636 and 201637 will be provided post-authorisation. 
The most commonly reported types of AEs occurring in ≥ 5% of subjects and also the most commonly 
reported more severe types of AEs (Grade 2-4) occurring in ≥ 1% of subjects were largely comparable 
between the DTG + RPV and CAR groups. The following most commonly reported types of AEs 
occurring in ≥ 5% of subjects were observed more frequently in the DTG + RPV group: headache, 
diarrhoea, bronchitis, arthralgia. The following most commonly reported more severe types of AEs 
(Grade 2-4) occurring in ≥ 1% of subjects were observed more frequently in the DTG + RPV group: 
Bronchitis, diarrhoea, depression, gastroenteritis and insomnia (Table 22).

Events by Overall Frequency during the Early Switch Phase for Study 201636, Study 201637, and 
Pooled Data (Safety Population) 
For a more detailed evaluation of all AEs observed the Applicant provided a summary of adverse 
events (Grade 1-4) reported in ≥1% of subjects by overall frequency in the DTG + RPV and CAR 
groups. Overall, it can be concluded that no new safety concerns could be identified based on these 
data. 
Adverse Events by System Organ Class  
The most commonly reported AEs in both treatment groups were from the system organ classes of 
infections and infestations and GI disorders. While events in the infections and infestations SOC and 
Assessment report

musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders occurred at similar frequencies across both treatment 
groups in the pooled analysis, GI-, nervous system-, skin and subcutaneous tissue- , psychiatric- , and 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders events occurred at a higher frequency in the DTG + RPV 
treatment group (see Table 27). AEs from these SOCs are known and common side effects of the 
single entities DTG and/or RPV - with the exception of respiratory disorders - and therefore, no new 
safety concerns became obvious.  
Respiratory events were very heterogeneous in nature so that no specific pattern of respiratory AEs 
became obvious. It can therefore be concluded that respiratory events reported more frequently in the 
DTG + RPV group were likely not related to study treatment. The number of subjects reporting events 
in other SOCs (not listed in detail here) that differed between the treatment groups (e.g., blood and 
lymphatic system disorders and immune system disorders) is too small to draw any conclusions.

With  respect  to  GI  disorders,  the  largest  differences  occurred  for  AEs  of  flatulence,  abdominal 
distention,  and  constipation.  For  nervous  system  disorders,  subjects  from  the  DTG  +  RPV  reported  a 
higher  incidence  of  AEs  of  headache  and  dizziness.  For  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders,  12 
(2%) subjects in the DTG + RPV group versus 3 (<1%) subjects in the CAR group reported rash. For 
psychiatric  disorders,  insomnia,  depression,  and  abnormal  dreams  were  reported  at  higher  rates  for 
the  DTG  +  RPV  group.  For  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders,  the  largest  difference 
occurred for the preferred terms of rhinitis allergic, oropharyngeal pain, and catarrh.

Overall, the observed events in the DTG  + RPV group are known,  common and expected side effects 
for DTG and RPV and the study population. It can therefore be concluded that no new or unexpected 
side effects were detected. 
Drug-Related Adverse Events 
Table 24 gives an overview of the most common drug-related AEs (reported in ≥1% of subjects in any 
treatment group) during the Early Switch Phase. As already mentioned, drug-related AEs were clearly 
more frequently reported for the DTG + RPV group compared with the CAR group in the Early Switch 
phase (97 (19%) vs. 9 (2%)). No individual drug-related adverse event was reported in more than 2% 
of  subjects.  For  both  treatment  groups  the  highest  proportion  of  subjects  reported  a  drug-related  AE 
related to GI disorders, followed by psychiatric disorders and nervous system  disorders. The majority 
of  drug-related  AEs  were  classified  as  Grade  1  in  either  treatment  group.  The  most  common  drug-
related AEs in the DTG + RPV group were headache, diarrhoea, abdominal distension, nausea. Also the 
more severe drug-related AEs Grade 2–4 were observed more frequently in the DTG + RPV group than 
in  the  CAR  group  (29,  6%  vs.  3,  <1%).  The  most  common  Grade  2-4  drug  related  AEs  in  the 
DTG+RPV  group  were  depression  (4  events)  and  a  sampling  of  gastrointestinal  events  (Table  29). 
There was no pattern of drug related Grade 2-4 AEs highlighting any specific SOC.  
For a more detailed evaluation of all drug-related AEs observed the Applicant provided a summary of 
drug-related adverse events (Grade 1-4) reported in ≥1% of subjects by overall frequency in the DTG 
+  RPV  and  CAR  groups.  Overall,  it  can  be  concluded  that  no  new  safety  concerns  could  be  identified 
based on these data: 
No new types of drug related adverse drug reactions were observed during the Early Switch Phase for 
the  safety  population  as  most  of  the  reported  drug  related  events  are  well  known  and  expected  side 
effects  of  DTG  and  RPV  labelled  in  the  corresponding  SmPCs.  The  most  likely  explanations  for  the 
imbalances  with  regard  to  drug-related  AEs  between  the  2  treatment  groups  are  already  discussed 
above  (drug-related  AEs  observed  are  common  and  expected  AEs  form  the  single  substances  so  it  is 
plausible  that  the  occurrence  of  those  adverse  events  will  be  assessed  as  related  to  study  treatment 
DTG + RPV by the investigators).

Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) 
The following AESIs have been determined for DTG + RPV based on non-clinical and/or clinical safety 
data for the SEs: Hypersensitivity, Hepatobiliary Disorders, Psychiatric Disorders Including Depression 
and  Suicidality,  Drug  Resistance,  Skin  and  Subcutaneous  Disorders,  Gastrointestinal  Disorders,  Renal 
Disorders,  Musculoskeletal  and  Connective  Tissue  Disorders,  and  Grade  3  to  4  Lipase  Elevations.

Nervous  system  disorders  were  not  predefined as AESI, although events from this SOC are common, 
known and expected side effects of the single entities. This is considered acceptable because adverse 
events  subsumed  under  this  SOC  (e.g.  headache,  dizziness)  are  less  serious  events  which  do  not 
require any special monitoring.  
The  numbers  of  hypersensitivity  reactions  were  low  with  no  major  differences  in  both  treatment 
groups.  
The  numbers  of  events  in  the  hepatobiliary  disorders  SOC  were  low  with  overall  no  major 
differences  in  both  treatment  groups  (DTG  +  RPV  5  (<1%);  CAR  2  (<1%)).  The  AEs  observed  from 
this  SOC  were  variable  in  nature  and  no  meaningful  AE  pattern  could  be  detected.  In  the  DTG+RPV 
group  2  events  of  drug-induced  liver  injury  (DILI)  (both  of  them  Grade  3)  occurred;  DILI  in  one 
subject  was  the  only  hepatobiliary  event  considered  drug-related  to  study  treatment  DTG  +  RPV. 
According  to  the  information  given,  it  is  reasonable  to  conclude  that  the  DILI  event  in  one  of  the 
subjects seem to be not related to study treatment but to acetaminophen. 
Independent  of  the  events  of  hepatobiliary  disorders  observed  in  the  SWORD  studies,  the  Applicant 
completed the routine review of hepatobiliary disorders for DTG containing products on 2nd February 
2018. As a result, the Applicant updated the company core datasheet for DTG containing products with 
the  addition  of  ‘acute  hepatic  failure’  as  an  rare  adverse  reaction.  Based  on  the  submitted  data  of 
severe  liver  disorders  observed  with  DTG  containing  regimens  it  cannot  be  ruled  out  that  the  DTG-
containing regimen may be the likely causative agent for the small number of severe liver dysfunction 
events.  Therefore,  the  addition  of  ‘acute  hepatic  failure’  as  a  rare  adverse  reaction  in  the  Juluca 
SmPC/PIL is appropriate. 
Psychiatric  AEs  were  overall  reported  more  frequently  in  the  DTG  +  RPV  treatment  group  (DTG  + 
RPV  61  subjects,  12%;  CAR  32  subjects,  6%).  Insomnia,  depression,  anxiety,  and  abnormal  dreams 
were the most commonly reported AEs from this SOC in the DTG + RPV group - the majority of them 
were considered Grade 1 or 2. Related to psychiatric disorders also drug-related AEs and AEs leading 
to withdrawal were reported more frequently in the DTG + RPV treatment group (drug related: DTG + 
RPV  26  subjects  (5%)  vs.  CAR  2  (<1%);  withdrawals:  9  (2%)  vs.  1  (<1%),  see  Tables  30  and  31). 
Psychiatric AEs were the most common observed SOC leading to withdrawal in the DTG + RPV group. 
The majority of the drug-related events were Grade 1.  
The incidence of AEs relating to depression was higher in the DTG + RPV treatment group (22 subjects 
(4%)  vs.  8  (2%));  all  events  were  single  occurrences  in  both  treatment  groups.  Six  AEs  relating  to 
depression were considered drug-related in the DTG + RPV treatment group.  
The  reporting  rate  for  AEs  relating  to  suicidal  behaviors  was  overall  low  and  comparable  across  the 
treatment groups (DTG + RPV 4 [<1%], CAR 3 [<1%]) and all events relating to suicidal behaviors in 
the DTG + RPV group  were single occurrences. One event in the DTG + RPV  group (Grade 3 suicidal 
ideation  in  one  subject  with  past  history  of  depression)  was  considered  drug-related  and  led  to 
withdrawal.  Events  of  suicidal  ideation  and  behavior  were  (additionally  to  the  AE/SAE  forms)  also 
identified via the Possible Suicide Related Adverse Events (PSRAE) forms and  the electronic Columbia 
Suicidality  Severity  Rating  Scale  (eC-SSRS).  Seven  additional  cases  were  identified  herewith.  All 
events  in  the  context  of  suicidal  behaviors  were  reported  as  recovered  or  recovered  with  sequelae. 
None of the events resulted in completed suicide.  
Overall, it can be concluded that the psychiatric AE profile of co-administered DTG + RPV is consistent 
with the psychiatric AE profile of the single entities DTG and RPV. No new types of psychiatric AEs were 
reported.  Reassuringly,  in  the  pivotal  studies  treatment  with  DTG+RTV  did  not  lead  to  increased 
suicidality as compared to control treatment. The higher incidences of any psychiatric AEs in the DTG + 
RPV  group  can  most  likely  be  explained  by  the  already  mentioned  facts  (switch  design  elements  in 
studies  201636  and  201637  where  subjects  in  the  CAR  treatment  group  receive  a  well-tolerated

therapy  in  contrast  to  subjects  in  the  DTG  +  RPV  treatment  group  which  are  randomized  to  new 
therapy regimen; psychiatric side effects observed in DTG + RPV arm are known, expected and labeled 
AEs  for  the  single  entities  DTG  and/or  RPV  and  therefore,  the  occurrence  of  these  events  will  be 
assessed as related to DTG + RPV by the investigators).  
However, use of both single entities is known to be associated with neuropsychological AEs. Moreover, 
it  is  noticed  that  there  are  several  publications  in  literature  reporting  a  higher  rate  of  DTG 
discontinuations  due  to  neuropsychological  events  (including  headache,  insomnia,  suicidal  ideation) 
than  would  have  been  expected  based  on  clinical  trial  data  (e.g.  de  Boer  AIDS  2016  30:2831-2834, 
Bonfanti  AIDS  2017  31:455-457,  Borghetti  AIDS  2017  31:457-459).  Depression  (including  suicidal 
ideation and behaviours particularly in patients with a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric 
illness)  is  listed  as  important  identified  risk  in  the  DTG+RPV  RMP  and  will  be  followed  closely  post 
marketing.  For  a  more  in-depth  assessment  of  the  psychiatric  AEs,  a  comparison  between  the 
incidences of psychiatric AEs observed in the two pivotal studies with the incidences of psychiatric AEs 
observed  in  the  pivotal  studies  with  the  single  entities  DTG  and  RPV  was  provided.  In  addition,  the 
Applicant  was  requested  to  provide  more  detailed  information  on  baseline  characteristics  related  to 
(the  history  of)  psychiatric  disorders  for  the  study  population  included  in  the  SWORD  vs  the  single 
entity  Phase  III  studies.  Based  on  all  data  provided,  there  is  no  indication  that  the  combination  of 
DTG+RPV results in an additive / supra-additive risk for psychiatric ADRs.

It is not possible to quantify the risk of developing clinical resistance to DTG + RPV as the database 
is too small to draw any conclusion. 
With regard to skin and subcutaneous disorders SOC, there was a difference of AE rates related to 
AESI rash in the DTG + RPV group compared with CAR group (pooled analysis) in Studies 201636 and 
201637. However, serious rash was not observed, including any reports of Stevens Johnson syndrome, 
TEN,  or  erythema  multiforme.  Overall,  no  major  imbalances  in  drug-related  AEs  and  no  serious 
adverse events in the skin and subcutaneous disorders SOC were observed. 
GI  events  and  also  drug  related  GI  disorders  were  reported  more  frequently  in  the  DTG  +  RPV 
treatment  group  (any  GI  event:  25%  vs.  16%;  drug-related:  7%  vs.  <1%).  The  most  commonly 
reported  events  in  both  treatment  groups  were  diarrhea  and  dyspepsia  and  the  most  commonly 
reported  drug-related  AEs  in  the  DTG  +  RPV  treatment  group  were  diarrhea  (8  subjects,  2%), 
abdominal  distension,  nausea  (each  7  subjects,  1%),  and  flatulence  (6  subjects,  1%).  There  were  3 
SAEs related to GI events reported in the DTG + RPV group: acute pancreatitis (questionable diagnosis 
according  to  the  case  narrative  (further  information  can  be  found  below  in  section  “Drug-Related 
Serious  Adverse  Events”)),  gastrointestinal  hemorrhage  (considered  not  related  by  the  investigator 
which is endorsed according to case narrative: endoscopic examinations revealed no obvious source of 
bleeding; possible cause for the event of GI bleeding is “rare” ibuprofen use for chronic back pain) and 
gastroesophageal  reflux  (not  related,  most  likely  caused  by  underlying  disease  according  to  the  case 
narrative).  
Altogether, the most commonly reported AEs in the DTG + RPV treatment group are well known and 
expected  side  effects  of  the  single  entities  which  is  a  plausible  explanation  for  the  imbalances  of  GI 
events in the 2 treatment groups (as discussed already above).  
The incidences of events in the renal disorders SOC were low in both treatment groups with a slightly 
higher  number  of  events  reported  in  the  DTG  +  RPV  group  (DTG  +  RPV  15  (3%);  CAR  9  (2%));  the 
majority  of  renal  events  were  classified  as  Grade  1  for  both  treatment  groups.  One  event  of  renal 
failure  in  a  subject  (considered  drug-related,  but  the  subject’s  medical  history  could  also  result  in  an 
increase of creatinine) and 1 event of acute renal impairment in a subject were reported in the DTG + 
RPV group. As both subjects had a Grade 1 creatinine elevation only, the diagnoses of renal failure and 
renal impairment are not fully plausible. However, it is reassuring that both events of mild increases in 
creatinine  were  reversible  so  that  a  chronic  renal  impairment  can  be  excluded.  It  is  agreed  that  the 
other  events  subsumed  under  renal  disorders  SOC  were  most  likely  not  related  to DTG/RPV.  Overall,

data  submitted  so  far  give  no  hints  for  relevant  renal  adverse  effects  for  DTG  +  RPV  compared  with 
CAR. 
The  incidence  of  all  adverse  events  from  the  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders 
SOC  was  comparable  in  both  treatment  groups  whereas  drug  related  AEs  were  more  frequently 
observed  in  the  DTG  +  RPV  group  (all  Grade  1).  However,  the  reported  events  (arthralgia, 
musculoskeletal pain) are known and expected side effects of DTG and/or RPV; this is most likely the 
reason for the observed imbalance with regard to AEs from the musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders SOC. No new types of events related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders were 
observed. 
There  were  only  minimal and  therefore  no  clinically  significant  differences in  changes  in lipid profile 
between the 2 groups. 
Serious adverse events  
The incidence of subjects developing any SAE (DTG + RPV 27 subjects, 5%; CAR 21 subjects, 4%) and 
the  incidence  of  drug-related  SAEs  (DTG  +  RPV  4,  <1%;  CAR,  <1%)  was  similar  between  treatment 
groups during the Early Switch Phase. In the Late Switch Phase additional 14 subjects reported a total 
of  18  SAEs;  according  to  the  data  submitted  it  is  reasonable  that  none  of  which  were  considered 
related to study treatment. According to Table 32, the most frequently reported SAE during the Early 
Switch Phase was pneumonia (3 subjects in the DTG + RPV group, none in the CAR group) and suicide 
attempt (reported in 1 subject each for the DTG + RPV and CAR groups). All other SAEs were reported 
in 1 subject each.  
Overall,  the  incidence  of  SAEs  was  low  in  both  treatment  groups.  The  reported  SAEs  were  highly 
variable  in  nature  and  no  meaningful  pattern  could  be  detected.  There  were  some  numerical 
imbalances for certain types of SAEs, but due to the low number of affected patients, firm conclusions 
cannot be drawn.

a. There was 1 subject (Study 201636) with a Grade 4 event of suicidal ideation that was classified by the site as non-serious and not related to drug; this 
event is not included in the above table, however, the event was later determined by the site to be a suicide attempt. 
b. The events of drug hypersensitivity and Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction occurred in the same subject and were reported for the same reaction in this 
subject. 
Drug-Related Serious Adverse Events  
Four  subjects  in  the  DTG  +  RPV  group  experienced  drug-related  SAEs  (compared  to  1  in  the  CAR 
group):  acute  pancreatitis,  DILI,  depression,  and  acute  eosinophilic  pneumonia  (drug-related  SAE  in 
the  CAR  group:  suicide  attempt).  No  drug-related  SAEs  were  reported  with  an  onset  during  the  Late 
Switch Phase. Narratives are provided for all observed drug related SAEs; only a short summary of the 
cases together with a short discussion of each event will be presented here: 
• 
(SAE  -  Pancreatitis  acute):  Past  medical  history  of  fatty  food  and  alcohol  intake,  including  a 
significantly higher alcohol and fatty food intake than usual reported for the week prior to the 
SAE.  
According  to  the  narrative,  the  diagnosis  of  ‘acute  pancreatitis’  is  very  questionable  as  the 
patient  had  only  an  isolated  increase  of  lipase  with  no  increase  of  amylase,  only  slight 
abdominal pain on one single day and no findings in an abdomen CT examination. 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 87/109 
  
  
 
 
•  SAE  –  Depression:  Past  history  of  depression.  Onset  at  Day  214  of  Grade  3  depression  that 
was considered serious, related to study drug, and led to withdrawal. 27 days later subject was 
hospitalized  due  to  depressive  disorder  with  suicidal  tendencies,  and  DTG  and  RPV  were 
discontinued. The outcome of the depression was not recovered/not resolved at the time of the 
Week 48 analysis cut-off  date although there was improvement as evidenced by the result of 
the MADRS. 
Depression and suicidal ideation are known and labeled ADRs of DTG and RPV. 
•  SAE  –  Eosinophilic  pneumonia  acute:  Onset  of  Grade  3  eosinophilic  pneumonia  acute  on  Day 
195.  Subject  was  hospitalized.  After  3  days  clinical  and  radiological  improvement  of  the 
process. The outcome of eosinophilic pneumonia acute was not recovered/not resolved, but the 
subject  was  discharged  from  the  hospital  with  clinical  and  radiological  improvement  and 
continued on corticoids treatment. DTG and RPV were discontinued.  
As  this  is  a  single  case  it  cannot  be  concluded  that  there  is  a  causal  relationship  between 
DTG/RPV treatment and the event of eosinophilic pneumonia cannot be considered conclusively 
proven. 
•  SAE  -  Drug-induced  liver  injury:  Current  history  of  drug  related  liver  disease  at  baseline.  On 
Day 34 after the first dose of DTG + RPV, subject developed severe Grade 3 drug-induced liver 
injury  (ALT  466  IU/L  [Grade  3],  AST  696  IU/L  [Grade  4],  bilirubin  38  µmol/L  [Grade  2]). 
Subject reported right hypochondrium pain (persistent, not colic), associated with choluria, and 
no other symptoms of hepatitis. DTG and RPV were discontinued 3 days later when laboratory 
results became available. ALT, AST, and bilirubin had returned to within the normal range at a 
subsequent  Follow-up  on  study  Day  45.  According  to  the  Applicant,  this  case  does  not  meet 
criteria  for  serious  hepatotoxicity  as  bilirubin  increased  <2  x  ULN  and  direct  bilirubin  was 
<35%. This conclusion seems to be in contradiction to the fact that the event of ‘Drug-induced 
liver  injury’  in  this  subject  was  reported  and  submitted  as  serious  hepatotoxicity  by  the 
Applicant. However, according to the data submitted the event was obviously not serious since 
the  limits  for  bilirubin  and  direct  bilirubin  failed  to  meet  the  protocol  defined  criterion  for 
serious hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, it is reassuring that this event was reversible.  
Hepatobiliary  disorders  are  already  labelled  in  the  SmPC  of  DTG  and  RPV.  The  possible  risk  of 
hepatotoxicity  should  be  further  monitored  during  post  marketing  period.    Apart  from  the  DILI  event 
reported  in  the  SWORD  studies,  the  Applicant  performed  a  routine  review  of  hepatobiliary  disorders 
observed  during  therapy  with  DTG  containing  regimen.  Based  on  the  submitted  data  of  severe  liver 
disorders  observed  with  DTG  containing  regimens,  ‘acute  hepatic  failure’  was  added  in  section  4.8  of 
the Juluca SmPC as a rare adverse reaction. 
In  conclusion  a  slightly  higher  number  of  serious  drug-related  AEs  was  observed  for  the  DTG  +  RPV 
treatment group, but it must be noted that the incidence of serious drug-related AEs overall could be 
considered  as  low  for  both  treatment  groups  (DTG  +  RPV:  4  subjects;  CAR:  1  subject  (<1%  of 
subjects  in  each  group)).  The  drug  related  SAEs  reported  were  very  heterogeneous  in  nature  and 
always single events,  which are partly to be expected on the basis of the known safety profile of the 
single entities DTG and RPV, and partly to be explained by predisposing conditions. Overall, it can be 
concluded that new safety concerns were not observed. 
Deaths 
In both treatment groups one death each were reported at the time of the cut-off date for the Week 48 
analysis; both occurred in the Early Switch Phase. One subject in the DTG + RPV group died due to an 
AE of Kaposi’s sarcoma and 1 subject in the CAR group died due to an AE of lung neoplasm malignant. 
Neither  event  was  considered  related  to  study  treatment  by  the  investigator.  The  Applicant  provided 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 88/109 
  
  
case  narratives  for  each  of  the  subject’s  death,  confirming  that  the  fatalities  were  most  likely  not 
related to treatment. Overall, no imbalances for mortality were observed. 
Laboratory findings 
Liver Chemistry 
Hepatobiliary AEs in the Early Switch Phase are discussed already above in section ‘Adverse events of 
special interest (AESIs)’. 
In  9  subjects  elevations  of  ALT  >3  x  ULN  were  observed  in  the  DTG  +  RPV  group  during  the  Early 
Switch Phase and 1 subject in the Late Switch Phase. Six of the elevations in the Early  Switch Phase 
and  the  elevation  in  the  Late  Switch  Phase  were  due  to  other  causes;  the  explanations  given  in  the 
submitted documents for these increases are plausible. One subject was diagnosed with drug-induced 
liver  injury  (discussed  above),  and  two  further  subjects  were  withdrawn  from  the  studies  after 
switching  to  DTG  +  RPV  in  the  Late  Switch  Phase  due  to  elevations  in  transaminases  with  no 
alternative  diagnoses  established.  It  can  be  concluded  from  data  provided  that  increases  in  ALT  and 
AST in these both subjects are most likely related to treatment with DTG + RPV. No further action is 
required because increased transaminases are labelled as a very common ADR in the Juluca PIL. 
In the DTG + RPV group bBilirubin increased to a maximum of Grade 2.  
Grade 1 to 4 increases of AST were observed in both treatments groups during the early switch phase 
with  a  higher  incidence  in  the  DTG+RPV  group.  AST-elevations  were  single  episodes  only  with 
spontaneous resolution and most likely be chance findings. The clinically more relevant Grade 2-4 AST-
elevations were more frequently reported in subjects on CAR. “Increases in transaminases” is labelled 
in the Juluca SmPC. No further action is required. 
Overall  it  can  be  concluded  that  increases  in  aminotransferases  are  known  and  very  common  side 
effects  of  both,  DTG  and  RPV.  Altogether,  no  new  risk  with  regard  to  the  liver  chemistries  and  no 
increased risk of hepatic toxicity for DTG + RPV compared with CAR could be detected. 
Renal Function 
Renal disorders AEs in the Early Switch Phase are discussed already above in section ‘Adverse events 
of special interest (AESIs)’. 
Ten (2%) subjects in the DTG + RPV group had Grade 1 maximum post-baseline emergent elevations 
in creatinine; there were no Grade 2 to Grade 4 elevations. The increases in serum creatinine became 
evident at Week 4 (the earliest time point assessed) and remained stable through Week 48. Initial and 
afterwards stable creatinine increase is a known effect of DTG. This is not considered clinically relevant 
but  should  be  labelled  in  the  SmPC.  Consistent  with  the  creatinine  increase,  the  mean  change  from 
Baseline  in  estimated  GFR  from  CKD-EPI  creatinine  equation  showed  a  small  decrease  in  the  DTG  + 
RPV group. CKD-EPI GFR using cystatin C showed no clinical relevant change from Baseline in the DTG 
+ RPV group, confirming that DTG + RPV had no effect on glomerular filtration rate, but only reduced 
creatinine  clearance.  Urine  albumin/creatinine  ratio  and  protein/creatinine  ratio  showed  only  little 
change  in  either  treatment  group  up  to  Week  48  confirming  there  was  no  adverse  effect  on  renal 
tubular function. Additionally, several other renal biomarkers – beside creatinine and cystatin C - were 
evaluated to further assess for any impact of study treatment on renal function. There was a decrease 
in the median urine retinol binding protein and the median urine beta-2-microglobulin concentration in 
both treatment groups with a slightly higher decrease the DTG + RPV group. 
Altogether,  no  safety  concerns  with  regard  to  the  renal  chemistries  and  no  increased  risk  of  renal 
toxicity for DTG + RPV compared with CAR could be detected.

Creatine Phosphokinase increase 
During  the  Early  Switch  Phase  29  subjects  in  the  DTG  +  RPV  group  had  CPK  increases;  3  of  which 
Grade 4. All events were classified as exercise related. Neither event was considered serious or related 
to study treatment.  
Lipase increase 
Post-baseline emergent lipase elevations were observed more frequently in the CAR group (DTG + RPV 
51 subjects, 10%), CAR 73, 14%) - most of them considered Grade 1 or 2 and asymptomatic. In the 
DTG  +  RPV  group  2  increases  in  lipase  up  to  Grade  4  were  reported.  The  Grade  4  increases  were 
isolated  lipase  elevations,  asymptomatic,  not  associated  with  other  symptoms  and  reversible  despite 
continued  study  medication  DTG  +  RPV.  These  data  are  reassuring  and  no  consequences  are 
necessary. 
Lipid Parameters 
A  small  proportion  of  subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  had  treatment-emergent  cholesterol  and 
triglycerides elevation of Grade 2 or higher at Week 48. Grade 4 lipid elevation was not observed in the 
DTG  +  RPV  group.  Overall,  there  were  no  meaningful  differences  in  the  measured  lipid  parameters 
(total  cholesterol,  LDL  cholesterol  and  triglycerides)  between  the  2  treatment  groups.  Also  the  total 
cholesterol/HDL ratio was similar between the 2 groups. Increases in lipid parameters are known from 
RPV (total cholesterol (fasted) and LDL cholesterol). No new safety concern was detected. The changes 
in lipids are not relevantly different between baseline and Week48 when subjects who were using lipid 
modifying agents were excluded. 
Hematology 
The  Applicant  presented  a  tabulated  summary  of  maximum  post-baseline  emergent  hematological 
alterations observed during the Early Switch Phase for the safety population. Overall, there were only 
few  post-baseline  alterations  with  regard  to  hematological  parameters  in  the  DTG  +  RPV  and  CAR 
group.  The  maximum  intensity  of  post-baseline  emergent  hematology  alterations  was  comparable 
across the two treatment groups. A significant higher number of subjects in the DTG + RPV group had 
platelets alterations Grade 1 which is not considered clinically relevant.  
Vital Signs 
Vital signs measurements were recorded at Baseline only. This is considered acceptable as effects on 
blood pressure and/or heart rate are not expected from the single substances. 
Cardiac Evaluations 
A 12-lead ECG was performed at Screening visit only. This is acceptable, because based on data from 
the  TQT  studies  with  the  single  entities  DTG  and  RPV  and  based  on  the  results  of  the  DDI  study 
LAI116181 between both drugs it can be concluded that the doses used in the SWORD studies are not 
associated with a risk for QTc prolongation after combined administration of RPV with DTG.

Cardiovascular Biomarkers 
Cardiovascular biomarkers in blood were assessed and included C-reactive protein, d-dimer, fatty acid 
binding protein-2, glucose, HOMA-IR (insulin resistance), IL-6, oxidized LDL cholesterol, soluble CD14, 
soluble CD163, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and insulin. There was no obvious pattern in 
changes from Baseline to Week 48 and no major differences between the 2 treatment groups for these 
biomarkers. 
Bone Evaluations 
A dedicated, ongoing Phase III DEXA substudy was conducted as part of the 2 pivotal studies (201636 
[SWORD-1] or 201637 [SWORD-2].  
Title:  An  Evaluation  of  Bone  Mineral  Density  in  HIV-1-Infected  Adult  Subjects  Switching  from  a 
Tenofovir-Containing Antiretroviral Therapy Regimen to a Dolutegravir Plus Rilpivirine Regimen 
Primary Objective:  
• 
To evaluate the change in bone mineral density (BMD) assessed by areal density in total hip at 
48 weeks following switch of subjects from an antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen containing 
Tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate  (TDF)  to  dolutegravir  plus  rilpivirine  (DTG  +  RPV)  once  daily 
compared with continued therapy with the TDF-containing regimen. 
Secondary Objectives:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To  evaluate  the  change  in  BMD  assessed  by  areal  density  in  lumbar  spine  at  48  weeks 
following  switch  of  subjects  from  an  ART  regimen  containing  TDF  to  DTG  +  RPV  once  daily 
compared with continued therapy with the TDF-containing regimen. 
To  evaluate  the  change  in  BMD  assessed  by  areal  density  in  lumbar  spine  and  total  hip  over 
time following switch of subjects from an ART regimen containing TDF to DTG + RPV OD. 
To  evaluate  the  change  in  BMD  in  lumbar  spine  and  total  hip  assessed  by  T-scores  and  Z-
scores at 48 weeks following switch of subjects from an ART regimen containing TDF to DTG + 
RPV once daily compared with continued therapy with the TDF-containing regimen. 
To  evaluate  the  change  in  BMD  assessed  by  T-scores  and  Z-scores  in  lumbar  spine  and  total 
hip over time following switch of subjects from an ART regimen containing TDF to DTG + RPV 
once daily. 
To  assess  the  effect  of  baseline  third  agent  class  on  BMD  in  lumbar  spine  and  total  hip  over 
time following switch to the DTG + RPV once daily. 
Study  Design:  This  sub-study  (202094  [DEXA  sub-study])  was  an  open-label,  parallel-group  sub-
study  of  the  2  identical  pivotal,  Phase  III,  randomized,  multicentre,  parallel-group,  non-inferiority 
studies,  201636  and  201637  (SWORD-1  and  SWORD-2),  evaluating  the  efficacy,  safety,  and 
tolerability  of  switching  to  DTG  +  RPV  from  current  integrase  strand  transfer  inhibitor  (INSTI)-,  non-
nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitor  (NNRTI)-,  or  protease  inhibitor  (PI)-based  antiretroviral 
regimen in HIV-1-infected adults who are virologically suppressed. 
This  sub-study  evaluated  any  change  from  baseline  in  the  BMD  in  the  ‘total  hip’,  which  included  the 
femoral  neck,  trochanter,  and  intertrochanter  areas  and  the  lumbar  spine,  which  includes  the  first 
lumbar vertebra (L1) to the fourth lumbar vertebra (L4), in subjects at 3 time points over 148 weeks 
following the switch from a triple ART regimen containing TDF to the NRTI–sparing 2-drug regimen of 
DTG + RPV. 
Number  of  subjects:  Study  202094  could  recruit  up  to  165  eligible  subjects  with  a  goal  of 
approximately 150 evaluable subjects including approximately 75 evaluable subjects from each of the 
DTG  +  RPV  and  current  antiretroviral  regimen  (CAR)  treatment  groups  across  both  parent  studies 
(201636  [SWORD-1]  and  201637  [SWORD-2]).  At  of  the  data  cutoff  for  Week  48  (22  November 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 91/109 
  
  
2016), this sub-study enrolled 102 subjects, who were included in the analyses. 
Study Population: Diagnosis and key inclusion criteria included HIV-1 infected subjects screened 
and eligible for either parent study (201636 or 201637) and received a TDF-containing ART regimen. 
The  main  exclusion  criteria  were  subjects  with  less than  3  vertebra  in  the  LI to  L4  range  suitable  for 
BMD  measurement,  bilateral  hip  replacement,  uncontrolled  thyroid  disease,  male  hypogonadism, 
endocrine diseases, history of fragility fractures, severe osteoporosis, BMI <18 kg/m2 or ≥ 40 kg/m2, 
vitamin D deficiency, and current use of tamoxifen or bone-related treatment. 
Treatment  administration:  Study  202094  recruited  eligible  subjects  from  the  early  switch  DTG  + 
RPV  treatment  group  and  from  the  late  switch  group  who  continued  their  CAR  through  to  Week  52 
across  either  of  the  parent  studies  (201636  or  201637).  Subjects  participating  in  this  sub-study  had 
DEXA scans performed at Day 1 and at study Weeks 48. Subjects in study 202094 received at least 48 
weeks of therapy with DTG + RPV or CAR in the parent study. Subjects who withdrew early prior to the 
last scheduled visit had a DEXA scan performed at their Withdrawal Visit. 
Criteria for evaluation: The primary endpoint was the percent change from Baseline at Week 48 in 
total  hip  BMD  as  assessed  by  areal density  (g/cm2).  The  secondary  endpoints  for  this  study  included 
the percent change from Baseline at Week 48 for lumbar spine BMD, change in lumbar spine BMD and 
total  hip  BMD  over  time  as  assessed  by  areal  density  (g/cm2),  and  change  in  total  hip  and  lumbar 
spine  BMD  as  assessed  by  T-scores  and  Z-scores.  In  addition,  these  secondary  endpoints  were  also 
assessed by Baseline third agent. 
Efficacy Results: No efficacy assessments were conducted as a part of this sub-study 
Safety Results:  
Changes  from  Baseline  in  Total  Hip  BMD  and  in  Lumbar  Spine  BMD  at  Week  48  Assessed  by  Areal 
Density  were  greater  for  subjects  in  the  DTG  +  RPV  group  compared  with  the  CAR  group  (there  was 
almost  no  change  in  the  mean  BMD  in  the  total  hip  in  the  CAR  group).  An  analysis  of  the  difference 
between the treatment groups from Baseline to Week 48 using an ANCOVA model yielded a p-value of 
0.014 for total hip BMD and a p-value of 0.039 for lumbar spine BMD for the DTG + RPV. The Applicant 
wasrequested to perform the main analysis with covariable BMD at baseline and factors treatment, age 
and third agent class.  
Results from the analysis of the secondary endpoints of both total hip and lumbar spine BMD assessed 
as  T-scores  and  Z-scores  were  consistent  with  and  supportive  of  the  primary  analysis.  Analysis  by 
Baseline third agent (INSTI, NNRTI, or PI) for the changes from Baseline at Week 48 in total hip and 
lumbar  spine  BMD  assessed  by  areal  density,  T-scores,  and  Z-scores  were  also  supportive  of  the 
primary and secondary endpoint results. 
For subjects in both treatment groups, FRAX score results showed little change from Baseline at Week 
48 in the 10-year probability of hip fracture (-0.08% and 0.03%, respectively) or 10-year probability 
of osteoporotic fracture (-0.12% and -0.04%, respectively). 
Analysis  of  treatment  differences  in  total  hip  BMD  at  Week  48  across  demographic  subgroups  (age, 
gender,  and  race)  and  Baseline  characteristics  (Baseline  BMI  and  CD4+  lymphocyte  count)  produced 
results  that  were  supportive  of  the  primary  result,  although  the  number  of  subjects  in  several  of  the 
defined sub-populations was too small to make comparisons across subgroups. Of note, there was no 
evidence  of  a  gender  effect  in  changes  in  BMD  from  Baseline  to  Week  48  noted  for  either  treatment 
group. 
Marked  decreases  in  each  of  the  3  bone  biomarkers  examined  (bone  specific  alkaline  phosphatase 
[BSAP],  Procollagen  type  1-N-propeptide  [P1NP],  and  osteocalcin)  was  observed  for  the  DTG  +  RPV 
group  compared  with  the  CAR  group;  all  of  which  were  demonstrated  to  be  statistically  significant. 
Type 1 collagen cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX) bone biomarker results were not available at the time

of this report. For bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin there was a significant interaction 
between treatment group and Baseline third agent class. 
Overall,  the  results  of  this  DEXA  study  show  that  DTG  +  RPV,  compared  to  control,  numerically 
increased  bone  mineral  density  and  decreased  bone  turnover.  It  is  reassuring  that  BMD  is  not 
decreased,  i.e.  BMD  does  not  give  rise  to  a  safety  concern.  On  the  other  hand,  the  data  are  not 
considered  sufficient  to  claim  any  beneficial  effect  on  bone  metabolism,  bone  stability  and  fracture 
rate. The long-term clinical effects of these changes are therefore unknown. 
Safety in special populations 
No  specific  clinical  study  was  performed  with  DTG+RPV  in  paediatric  subjects,  elderly  subjects, 
subjects  with  renal  insufficiency  or  hepatic  impairment,  or  subjects  co-infected  with  HIV-1  and 
hepatitis  B  or  C.  No  adequate  and  well-controlled  studies  of  DTG+RPV  have  been  conducted  in 
pregnant  women.  No  human  experience  of  acute  overdose  with  the  administration  of  DTG+RPV  is 
available.  The  waiver  of  studies  in  special  populations  with  the  FDC  RPV  and  DTG  is  considered 
acceptable as - according to current knowledge - there is no evidence for additional toxicities after co-
administration  of  DTG  and  RPV  and  sufficient  data  are  available  with  respect  to  safety  in  special 
population for the single entities DTG and RPV. 
Regarding  paediatrics,  the  PDCO  agreed  to  the  proposed  paediatric  investigation  plan  for  Juluca 
(EMEA-001750-PIP01-15)  and  has  agreed  on  an  open-label,  randomized,  active  controlled  non-
inferiority  study  to  evaluate  the  maintenance  of  Efficacy  and  Safety  of  dual  therapy,  Dolutegravir 
(DTG)  plus  Rilpivirine  (RPV),  in  anti-retroviral  therapy  (ART)-experienced  HIV-1-Infected  Children, 
from  6  to  less  than  18  years  of  age  who  are  virologically  suppressed  on  their  current  anti-retroviral 
(ARV) regimen (Study 3 in the PIP, completion is deferred to Dec 2022).   
As  there  were  hardly  any  elderly  subjects  enrolled  in  the  SWORD  studies  (aged  65  years  or  older 
(n=18 in the DTG+RPV groups of both studies pooled, n=13 in the CAR groups)), safety in the elderly 
population cannot be reliably assessed and is included as missing information in the RMP.  
In the 201636 and 201637 pooled analysis, there was no significant difference noted in the number of 
AEs reported post baseline between males (77%) and females (78%) in the DTG + RPV group. Events 
occurring  in  subjects  <50  (76%)  years  and  ≥50  (80%)  years  in  the  DTG  +  RPV  group  were  similar. 
Some difference was observed in the number of AEs reported between races in the DTG + RPV group; 
however  the  majority  of  subjects  were  white  and  there  were  relatively  small  numbers  in  the  other 
groups. There seemed to be more discontinuations due to AEs or death in the DTG+RPV vs CAR group 
in subjects over 50 years old.

Table 30.  Summary of Adverse Event Categories by Age group – Early Switch Phase – Pooled – CAR 
Gender, Age, and Race 
No safety concern regarding gender and age was observed.  
As the majority of subjects in studies 201636 and 201637 were white, no meaningful conclusion can be 
drawn regarding differences in white and black race and Asians. 
Hepatic Impairment 
Overall, only few patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment were included in studies 201636 
and 201637 (in the DTG + RPV group 29 subject with chronic hepatitis C at Baseline and 1 subject with 
ALT ≥3xULN at Baseline); all patients in the SWORD studies were Child- Pugh A. There was no 
evidence of any adverse effect following the switch to DTG + RPV in this patient population. Overall, no 
safety concern could be identified in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. However, 
due to the limited number of patients with hepatic impairment enrolled in the SWORD studies, a final 
conclusion on the safety profile in this patient population is not possible. The SmPC states that Juluca 
should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.   
Renal Impairment 
138 (27%) subjects with mild renal impairment (CAR 131 (26%)) and 6 (1%) subjects with moderate 
renal impairment (CAR 4 (<1%)) were enrolled into the DTG + RPV treatment arms in the SWORD 
studies; no subjects with severe renal impairment were enrolled. Overall, it can be concluded that the 
safety profile in patients with mild renal impairment is not different compared to the safety profile in 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 95/109 
  
  
 
patients without renal impairment. Due to the low number of patients with moderate renal impairment 
enrolled in the pivotal studies no adequate conclusions can be drawn from the data provided. Patients 
with severe renal impairment were excluded from SWORD studies. 
Pregnancy and Lactation 
The Applicant provided a comprehensive summary of pregnancy outcomes from clinical trials and post-
marketing use of Dolutegravir (DTG) including latest data from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry 
(APR). The submitted data indicate an increased rate of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortion, 
and still birth after exposure to DTG based regimen in pregnant women.   
Overall, the MAHs of DTG and RPV are committed to continuously generate data related to pregnancy. 
Accordingly, the risk of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortion and still birth after administration 
of Juluca in pregnant women should be further evaluated during post-marketing. The absence of 
adequate and well-controlled studies of the DTG/RPV FDC in pregnant or breastfeeding women is 
addressed in the RMP as missing information and use of Juluca during pregnancy is not recommended. 
Immunological events 
The Applicant did not include a discussion of immunological events. Immunosuppression is not 
described for the single entities DTG or RPV; therefore, immunosuppressive effects are not expected 
for the FDC DTG + RPV either. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In study LAI116181 only AEs Grade 1 - with the exception of 3 Grade 2 AEs – were observed. No new 
safety signals were detected from study.  
Discontinuation due to AEs 
Table 35 shows that 21 (4%) subjects in the DTG + RPV group and 3 (<1%) subjects in the CAR group 
experienced AEs leading to withdrawal/permanent discontinuation of study drug during the Early 
Switch Phase. All AEs leading to withdrawal had an incidence of <1%. AEs leading to withdrawal were 
most frequently reported from the psychiatric disorders (DTG + RPV, 9; CAR, 1) and GI disorders (DTG 
+ RPV, 7) SOCs. During the Late Switch Phase, an additional 6 subjects discontinued due to AEs (1 
randomized to DTG + RPV at Baseline and 5 who switched to DTG + RPV at Week 52). 
Baseline ART third-agent class (PI, INSTI, or NNRTI) did not seem to influence withdrawals in the DTG 
+ RPV treatment group as a similar number of subjects reported AEs leading to withdrawal/ permanent 
discontinuation of study treatment during the Early Switch Phase - irrespective of their prior baseline 
ART third-agent class (7 of 133 (5%) subjects from a PI-containing regimen, 8 of 275 (3%) subjects 
from a NNRTI-containing regimen, and 6 of 105 (6%) subjects from an INSTI-containing regimen). 
Overall, the incidences of the treatment discontinuations were not balanced across the both treatment 
groups with a higher incidence of withdrawals in the DTG + RPV group.  
As already discussed, this is most likely explained by the switch design elements of the SWORD 1 and 
2 studies and by the fact, that most of the AEs leading to withdrawal are known and expected side 
effects of the SEs. Therefore, it is plausible that the investigators will assess the occurrence of these 
events as related to study treatment with DTG and RPV – where applicable with the consequence of a 
Assessment report

treatment withdrawal. Overall, no safety concern can be deduced based on the data submitted with 
regard to discontinuation due to AEs.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The phase III studies 201636 (SWORD-1) and 201637 (SWORD-2) used DTG 50 mg + RPV 25 mg 
together as individual tablets. Additionally, a pivotal bioequivalence study in healthy adult volunteers 
(201676) was conducted to confirm that the DTG/RPV FDC tablet is equivalent to DTG and RPV given 
as two separate tablets together. Also a relative bioavailability study (201674) was conducted with 
different FDC formulations encompassing also investigation of a food effect. A Phase I drug interaction 
study (LAI116181) has evaluated the pharmacokinetics and safety of DTG and RPV in healthy adult 
subjects. An ongoing DEXA sub-study (202094) which enrolled subjects from the 2 Phase III clinical 
trials is evaluating the change in bone mineral density of those subjects who have switched from a 
tenofovir containing regimen to DTG + RPV compared to those who remained on a tenofovir containing 
current regimen. 
The safety database consists of safety data from 1024 subjects (DTG + RPV 513; CAR 511) from 
studies 201636 and 201637. The median time of exposure of 364 days (52 weeks) to DTG + RPV and 
CAR was in line with recommendations outlined in the Guideline on the clinical development of 
medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infection. Overall, the safety data package provided is 
appropriate for an adequate safety evaluation. 
A greater proportion of subjects in the DTG + RPV group compared with those in the CAR group 
reported any AEs, drug-related AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, and SAEs. Imbalances in AE rate 
become more obvious with increasing severity of the AEs. 
The impact of the switch design on the comparative safety, i.e. incidence of AEs is a plausible 
explanation for the imbalances observed: 
Firstly, it can be assumed that many AEs occur at the beginning of therapy so that subjects on stable 
therapy (i.e. subjects in the CAR treatment group) will report less AEs than those randomised to a new 
therapy regimen (i.e. subjects in the DTG + RPV treatment group). Comparing subjects stable on CAR 
with subjects newly switched to DTG+RPV can therefore be expected to create a bias in favour of CAR. 
An analysis of the timing of occurrence of adverse events relative to the start of DTG+RPV / CAR 
treatment shows a shorter median time to onset in the DTG + RPV group compared to the CAR group. 
This observation reinforce the assumption that the higher incidence of AEs in the DTG + RPV treatment 
group vs CAR group is mainly due to the fact that subjects in the DTG+RVP group were not familiar 
with the adverse events of this treatment while the subjects on the CAR arm were already on their 
regimen for at least 6 months and thereby somewhat selected for tolerating the treatment. 
Secondly, it must be assumed that according to study inclusion criterion 2 subjects with relevant AEs 
under their previous therapy have been switched to a better tolerated treatment for at least 6 months 
prior to screening. Therefore, subjects in the CAR group most likely receive a well-tolerated therapy as 
subjects with more severe AEs are no longer included; this condition is not given in the DTG + RPV 
group. Again it can be expected that this creates a bias in favour of CAR. The observation, that more 
serious AEs (grade 3 and 4) seem more imbalanced that less serious AEs (grade 1 and 2), supports 
this view.  
Furthermore, most of the reported drug related events are well known and expected side effects of 
DTG and/or RPV and labelled in the corresponding SmPCs. The investigators are therefore aware about 
possible side effects of DTG and/or RPV. It is plausible, that the occurrence of those adverse events in 
the DTG + RPV treatment arm will then be assessed as related to study treatment DTG + RPV by the 
investigators. 
A comparison between the incidences of adverse events for DTG + RPV co-administered, and 
corresponding frequencies for those events for DTG and RPV given as single entities was proposed to 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 98/109 
  
  
evaluate possible additive effects when using DTG and RPV in combination. Although it should be 
considered that a cross comparison between studies may be difficult e.g. because of different study 
populations, it can be overall concluded that based on the data provided additive side effects seem to 
be unlikely. 
A comparison of AE incidences between the Late Switch DTG + RPV subjects and the Early Switch DTG 
+ RPV subjects to further support the assumption that the higher incidence of AEs in the DTG + RPV 
treatment group compared to CAR is most likely attributed to the open label and treatment switch 
design elements in Studies 201636 and 201637 will be submitted upon availability in 2Q2018. 
The most commonly reported types of AEs were largely comparable between the DTG + RPV and CAR 
groups. AEs were most commonly reported from the system organ classes of infections and 
infestations, GI disorders, nervous system disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, 
psychiatric disorders, and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. No difference was seen in 
the incidence of AEs from the infections and infestations SOC in the 2 treatment groups. The types of 
AEs reported and subsumed under the SOCs with imbalances are overall known and expected side 
effects of the single entities DTG and/or RPV or can be considered as not drug-related. It can therefore 
be concluded that no new adverse reaction became obvious.  
AEs leading to withdrawal were most frequently reported from the system organ class psychiatric 
disorders and GI disorders.  
No new types of drug related adverse events were observed; most of the reported drug related events 
are well known and expected side effects of the single entities labelled in the corresponding SmPCs. 
The AESIs that have been determined for co-administered DTG + RPV are considered adequate and 
sufficient based on non-clinical and/or clinical safety data for DTG and RPV. No relevant new safety 
concerns with regard to hypersensitivity, hepatobiliary disorders, psychiatric disorders including 
depression and suicidality, drug resistance, skin and subcutaneous disorders, gastrointestinal 
disorders, renal disorders, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, and Grade 3 to 4 lipase 
elevations were identified as a result of the special monitoring. 
The psychiatric AE profile (including depression and suicidality) for DTG + RPV was comparable to the 
known safety profile for the single entities.  
According to the data submitted so far, the incidence of SAEs was low in both treatment groups. The 
reported SAEs were highly variable in nature and no meaningful pattern could be detected. There were 
some numerical imbalances for certain types of SAEs, but due to the low number of affected patients, 
firm conclusions cannot be drawn.  
The incidence of serious drug-related AEs overall was low for both treatment groups (again with a 
slightly higher number of events in the DTG + RPV group). The events were very heterogeneous in 
nature and single events each, partly to be expected on the basis of the known safety profile of the 
single entities DTG and RPV, and partly to be explained by predisposing conditions. Overall, no new 
safety concerns were observed.  
No imbalances for mortality were observed between the 2 treatment arms with a low number of deaths 
occurred. The fatalities were most likely not related to treatment. 
No major differences were observed overall in post-baseline emergent toxicities between the DTG + 
RPV and CAR group in the clinical chemistry laboratory parameters. Reassuringly, there seems to be no 
increased risk of renal toxicity or hepatic toxicity for DTG + RPV compared with CAR. 
The Applicant provided additional data to include ‘acute hepatic failure’ as a rare adverse reaction in 
the PI of dolutegravir containing ARVs. Based on the submitted data of severe liver disorders observed 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 99/109 
  
  
with DTG containing regimens it cannot be ruled out that the DTG-containing regimen may be the 
likely causative agent for the small number of severe liver dysfunction events observed. Therefore, the 
addition of ‘acute hepatic failure’ as a rare adverse reaction in the Juluca SmPC/PIL was considered 
appropriate. 
Only few post-baseline alterations with regard to haematological parameters were observed in the DTG 
+ RPV and CAR group. The maximum intensity of post-baseline emergent haematological alterations 
was overall comparable across the two treatment groups.  
The results of this DEXA study show that DTG + RPV, compared to control, numerically increased bone 
mineral density and decreased bone turnover. It is reassuring that BMD is not decreased, i.e. BMD 
does not give rise to a safety concern. On the other hand, the data are not considered sufficient to 
claim any beneficial effect on bone metabolism, bone stability and fracture rate. The long-term clinical 
effects of these changes are therefore unknown.  
There was no evidence for an increased risk of renal toxicity or hepatic toxicity for DTG + RPV 
compared with CAR. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Based on safety data provided it can be concluded that the safety profile of DTG taken in combination 
with RPV seems to be consistent with the established safety profiles of the single agents and no 
additional risks or safety issues due to combination therapy could be identified. 
2.7.  Risk Management Plan

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.3 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The Applicant seeks the following therapeutic indication for Juluca: 
„JULUCA is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in 
adults who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on a stable 
antiretroviral regimen for at least 6 months with no history of virological failure and no known or 
suspected resistance to any non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or integrase inhibitor (see 
section 5.1).” 
HIV-infection has become a manageable chronic disease. In the EU several drugs of different drug 
classes are approved for antiretroviral therapy of HIV-1 infected patients, for both patients not 
previously treated (naïve) and patients in need of a change in therapy.  
For many years the proportion of subjects at Week 48 with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL, has 
been a well-established surrogate endpoint for antiviral efficacy and, hence, prognosis of HIV-1 
infection and disease. 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 103/109 
  
  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current treatment guidelines recommend a combination of 2 nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors plus an agent from a different class, i.e. a triple combination regimen. These NRTI-based 
regimens have been shown to be effective and largely tolerated, however have been associated with 
long-term toxicities, such as lactic acidosis or bone and kidney changes. Use of NRTI-sparing regimens 
has hence been postulated to improve the overall tolerability and hence long-term therapeutic success. 
In addition, over the past years one focus of drug development has become co-formulation of all active 
substances to form single tablet, once daily, antiretroviral regimens.  
Two nucleos(t)ide-free regimens are currently recommended by learned societies (EACS 2017), both 
encompassing the INSTI raltegravir and the boosted PI darunavir. These regimens require twice daily 
dosing of raltegravir and a fixed dose combination tablet of the INSTI and the PI+booster are not 
available. These regimens are not considered “preferred” by the learned society and are recommended 
only in patients with favourable virological and immunological baseline characteristics. These regimens 
are thus not widely used.  
Improved tolerability, safety, and simple dosing regimens are important drivers of good adherence and 
hence lessen the risk of development of drug resistance. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
For confirmation of the efficacy of the applied product the Applicant submitted four key studies: 
• 
A drug-drug interaction and food interaction study with DTG and RPV as single entities and 
different fixed dose formulations (see Study no. 201674),  
• 
A bioequivalence study between DTG and RPV as single entities versus the fixed dose 
combination under fed conditions with moderate fat meal (see Study no. 201676) and 
• 
Two identically designed efficacy and safety studies with DTG and RPV as dual regimen and 
administered as single entities (Study 201636 and 21637), comprising a total of 1024 virologically 
suppressed patients with 513 patients in the investigational arm. These studies were designed as so-
called “switch studies” with the control arm randomised to continuing on the baseline antiretroviral 
regimens and statistical testing for non-inferiority. For methodological issues (many different regimens 
in the control arm) studies were not blinded. After 48 weeks patients from the control arm were 
switched to DTG+RPV. The studies are ongoing and their overall duration will be 148 weeks. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
No relevant DDI between DTG and RPV was observed, which is supportive for combining the two active 
substances. 
As for the single entities an increase in exposure, Cmax and AUC, was seen when the FDC was 
administered with a meal. Bioequivalence of DTG and RPV as single entities and as FDC was shown 
under moderate-fat meal conditions. 
The primary efficacy analyses of the Phase III studies (201636/201637) as well as for the pooled data 
demonstrated that DTG plus RPV administered ad single entities is non-inferior to CAR, with more than 
94% of subjects in both arms achieving the primary endpoint of < 50 copies/mL plasma HIV-1 RNA at 
Week 48 based on the Snapshot algorithm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 104/109 
  
  
Point estimates for the difference were very close to zero with narrow confidence intervals, the worst 
estimates (for study 201636) down to -4.1, i.e. much less than the predefined margin of -10% for the 
individual studies. For the pooled analyses the point estimate was -0.2 (-3.0; 2.5), adjusted for 
baseline stratification factors with the unadjusted analysis showing almost identical results. 
Virological failures occurred only at very low numbers in both groups, with only 1 of these subjects in 
the DTG + RPV arm having genotypic substitution K101K/E mixture in RT. This subject was noted as 
non-adherent and viral load decreased from first measurement to confirmatory visit and further down 
to < 50 c/ml upon withdrawal.  
Increases in CD4+-cell counts from baseline to week 48 were noted in both groups. 
In addition, secondary analyses were supportive for comparative efficacy of DTG+ RPV versus CAR.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The patient population of the studies was highly preselected in terms of numbers/duration of prior 
antiretroviral therapy, comorbid conditions, co-medications and absence of relevant resistance 
mutations. Moreover, patients had been on their first or second therapy for a mean of about 5 years. 
The available data question the generalizability of the study results to a wider target population. The 
approved indication reflects a selected patient population in terms of prior durability of viral 
suppression and presence of resistant mutations. 
Differences in terms of rate of virological suppression, transient increases in viral load and slow 
virological re-suppressions as well as clear differences in terms of CD4+-cell counts between the two 
study groups were not reported. However, one subject in the DTG+RPV group versus none in the CAR-
group experienced disease progression. Further information related to disease progression and 
occurrence of HIV-1 associated conditions is requested with the Week 100 SWORD study update and 
during marketing surveillance.  
Information regarding occurrence of resistant minority variants will be provided post-authorisation. 
The Applicant claims fewer long-term toxicities and better adherence as the major advantages of the 
dual regimen with DTG+RPV. However, so far, no such advantage is evident.  
Persistence of HIV replication in sanctuary sites can occur despite undetectable viraemia in plasma, 
and this could be more pronounced with dual than with triple therapy. As viral replication in sanctuary 
sites has been associated with persistent systemic inflammation and immune activation, as well as with 
accelerating neurocognitive dysfunction, this may have potential consequences on the long term.  
Long-term data will be provided post-authorisation.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety data package for this application consists of safety data of 1024 subjects (DTG + RPV 513; 
CAR 511) from the two ongoing Phase III studies 201636 and 201637. 
Adverse events related to the GI tract were more frequently reported with DTG + RPV (129 subjects, 
25% vs. 82 subjects, 16% in the comparator group). While diarrhoea and dyspepsia were the most 
commonly reported AEs in both treatment groups, differences were seen for flatulence, abdominal 
distention and constipation. 
Nervous system disorders (mainly headache and dizziness) were also more frequently observed with 
DTG + RPV than with comparator (77 subjects, 15% vs 42 subjects, 8%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/243517/2018 
Page 105/109 
  
  
Less frequently, psychiatric side effects were observed in response to DTG + RPV (61 subjects, 12% 
vs. 32 subjects, 6%), mainly consisting of depression, suicidal ideation and behaviour, insomnia and 
abnormal dreams. Psychiatric AEs lead most commonly to withdrawal in the DTG + RPV group. 
All these AEs described above are well known from the individual single entities and are therefore 
expected.  
Furthermore, a higher rate of AEs subsumed under respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (45 
subjects, 9% vs. 24 subjects, 5%) were observed. However, events in the Respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders SOC were very heterogeneous in nature so that no specific pattern of respiratory 
AEs became obvious. It was concluded that respiratory events described in the DTG + RPV group were 
likely not related to study treatment. 
An early small increase of mean serum creatinine levels which remained stable over time was observed 
in subjects in the DTG + RPV group; this is a known effect of DTG. 
In addition, ADRs not observed in the pivotal studies with DTG + RPV but listed in the corresponding 
SmPCs from the single entities are included in the Juluca SmPC (e.g. hypersensitivity, decreased white 
blood cell count, immune reconstitution syndrome, increased pancreatic amylase).  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Based on all safety data submitted it is reasonable to conclude that the safety profile of the combined 
administration of DTG and RPV seems to be consistent with the established safety profiles and the 
current labelling of the single agents. No additional risks or safety issues were identified.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The favourable effects shown in the efficacy studies 201636 and 201637 are reassuring regarding the 
good performance of the dual nucleos(t)ide free regimen consisting of DTG 50 mg and RPV 25 mg as 
compared to continuation of a so far efficacious (and well-tolerated) nucleos(t)ide containing 
antiretroviral regimen. While the study results appear to be quite robust with respect to their internal 
validity, the external validity of the study results is unclear:

Stringent patient selection criteria hamper the generalizability of the study results to a wider target 
population.  
The unfavourable effects seen in studies 201636 and 201637 do not raise a major concern with respect 
to the safety of the dual treatment regimen consisting of DTG 50 mg and RPV 25 mg. The overall 
safety profile of the combination appears comparable to what is known from the single entities. 
Clarification was sought on individual aspects regarding the differential AE-rates between test and 
reference treatment. 
No efficacy and safety data have been obtained with the fixed dose combination tablet Juluca. 
A bioequivalence study (201676) was submitted as bridge for efficacy and safety, which confirmed 
bioequivalence between the single entities and the FDC in moderate fat conditions.  A potential 
differential food effect for the FDC as compared to the SEs with higher mean exposures after a high-fat 
as compared to moderate-fat meal was observed for the FDC.  However, the CHMP concluded that the 
use of a moderate fat meal in the pivotal bioequivalence study is sufficiently sensitive and 
discriminatory to detect a difference between formulations. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The clinical programme as such is appropriate for confirmation of efficacy and safety of the 
combination of DTG and RPV as a dual antiretroviral regimen – as single entities as well as a fixed dose 
combination. However, additional concerns were identified with respect to efficacy/safety of Juluca, 
which will be addressed post-authorisation. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk of Juluca is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Juluca is favourable in the following indication: 
Juluca is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in 
adults who are virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen 
for at least six months with no history of virological failure and no known or suspected resistance to 
any non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or integrase inhibitor 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

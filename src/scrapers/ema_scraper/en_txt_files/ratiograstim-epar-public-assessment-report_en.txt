2  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 
Introduction 
The  current  treatment  of  cancer  with  combination  cytotoxic  therapy  targeting  proliferating  cells 
usually leads to bone marrow damage, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and, most importantly, neutropenia 
resulting in impaired host defence. Severe neutropenia will inevitably lead to serious infections. Life-
threatening gastrointestinal and pulmonary infections as well as sepsis will occur as long as the severe 
neutropenia  prevails.  This  leads  to  delays  in  subsequent  chemotherapy  cycles.  The  recovery  of  the 
bone  marrow  is  stimulated  by  various  growth  factors.  The  most  important  growth  factor  for  the 
recovery of neutrophils is granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, G-CSF. 
G-CSF is a positive regulator of granulopoiesis, acting at different stages of myeloid cell development. 
It  enhances  the  effector  functions  of  normal  mature  neutrophils, including  chemotaxis,  phagocytosis 
and oxidative metabolism. It exerts its effects via a high-affinity G-CSF-specific receptor mechanism, 
which  accounts  for  its  selective  action  as  compared  with  many  other  cytokines.  The  natural  human 
G-CSF is a glycoprotein composed of a single polypeptide chain of 174 or 177 amino acids. 
Filgrastim, the active substance of Ratiograstim (the applicant is using the name XM02, which is also 
being used in this document), is a non-glycosylated recombinant methionyl human granulocyte colony 
stimulating factor expressed in E. coli and consisting of 175 amino acids. 
Ratiograstim,  the  medicinal  product  applied  for,  has  been  developed  as  a  “similar  biological 
medicinal  product”  according 
(4)  and  Annex 1,  Part II,  Chapter 4  of 
Directive 2001/83/EC  as  amended.  The  chosen  reference  medicinal  product  is  Neupogen  sourced 
from Amgen, Germany. 
to  Article 10 
The  medicinal  product  is  indicated  for  reducing  the  duration  of  neutropenia  and  the  incidence  of 
febrile neutropenia in patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy for malignant diseases and 
for  reducing  the  duration  of  neutropenia  in  patients  undergoing  myeloablative  therapy  followed  by 
bone  marrow  transplantation  and  who are  at  risk  of  prolonged  severe  neutropenia.  It  is  also  used  to 
mobilise peripheral blood stem cells as monotherapy or after myelosuppressive chemotherapy as well 
as  in  long  term  treatment  of  severe  congenital,  cyclical  or  idiopathic  neutropenia,  or  neutropenia 
associated with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection. 
Administration is by the subcutaneous or intravenous route, normally at a dose of 1 to 10 μg/kg/day 
depending on the indication. In congenital neutropenia, the starting subcutaneous dose is 12 μg/kg/day 
given as a single dose or in divided doses. 
The  medicinal  product  is  supplied  in  pre-filled  syringes  containing  0.5  (for  the  lower  strength)  or 
0.8 ml (for the higher strength) of sterile, preservative-free solution for injection consisting of 30 or 48 
MIU  (corresponding  to  300  and  480  μg  respectively)  XM02  active  substance  together  with  acidic 
sodium acetate buffer, sorbitol, polysorbate and water for injections. 
2.2 
Quality aspects 
Introduction 
XM02 active substance is a recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor produced in E. 
coli,  yielding  a  non-glycosylated  protein  with  an  N-terminal  methionyl  extension  (INN  filgrastim). 
The protein is expressed in inclusion bodies followed by renaturation of protein and chromatographic 
purification steps. The protein is a single chain of 175 amino acid polypeptide. 
As  required  for  a  similar  biological  medicinal  product,  comparability  to  the  reference  medicinal 
product (Neupogen, sourced from Amgen, Germany) has been demonstrated. 
5/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The medicinal product is presented as solution for injection or infusion in 1 ml glass, single-use, pre-
filled syringes. Two strengths are provided: 30 MIU/0.5 ml and 48 MIU/0.8 ml (corresponding to 300 
and 480 μg respectively). The formulation is similar to Neupogen and only slight differences exist in 
the  concentration  of  polysorbate  and  in  the  pH  value.  The  concentration  of  medicinal  product  bulk 
solution is 0.6 mg/ml and the difference in the two strengths is achieved by the different fill volumes. 
Active Substance 
XM02  active  substance  is  a  recombinant  form  of  human  G-CSF,  expressed  in  E.  coli.  The  native 
human  G-CSF  is  encoded  by  a  gene  on  chromosome  17  that  encodes  two  protein  products  due  to 
differential  splicing;  isoform  A  of  177  amino  acids  and  isoform  B  of  174  amino  acids.  Isoform  A 
differs  from  isoform  B  in  that  it  contains  an  additional  three  residues  (Val-Ser-Gln)  inserted  after 
Leu35.  The  174  amino-acid  form  is  associated  with  greater  biological  activity  and  stability  than  the 
longer isoform and is the basis for commercial pharmaceutical G-CSF products, including Neupogen. 
XM02  active  substance  is  a  recombinant  form  of  the  174  amino-acid  isoform  that  contains  an 
additional  N-terminal  methionine  residue  not  found  in  the  native  human  protein.  The  naturally 
occurring  G-CSF  is  also  glycosylated  at  threonine  residue  133,  a  modification  which  is  absent  in 
XM02 active substance as an E. coli expression product. 
Manufacture 
The XM02 active substance is manufactured at SICOR Biotech UAB, Vilnius, Lithuania. 
The active substance is produced by E. coli fermentation. After a predefined growth time, inductor is 
added  to  fermentation  media.  This  induces  the  start  the  production  phase,  which  continues  for  a 
predefined growth time. The cells are harvested and disrupted, and inclusion bodies are washed with 
buffer  for  removal  of  contaminants.  The  inclusion  bodies  are  dissolved  in  a  chaotropic  agent  and 
refolded  by  reducing-oxidising  system.  After  refolding,  a  series  of  orthogonal  chromatographic 
purification steps are applied. Following purification, the active substance is filtered, filled into bottles 
and stored at 2 to 8°C. 
The  manufacturing  and  purification  processes  were  properly  described  and  the  process  validation 
studies, as well as the in-process control system, were considered acceptable.  
No  major  changes  have  been  introduced  into  the  manufacturing  process  during  development.  All 
batches  of  active  substance  manufactured  at  the  developmental  and  commercial  scales  have  been 
produced using the current WCB. The developmental scale batch was used only during phase I trials. 
Throughout process development, fermentation has been conducted at the same scale, but the site of 
fermentation  and  purification  was  changed  when  the  manufacturing  was  transferred  to  a  GMP 
production facility. 
The  E.  coli  host  strain  was  transformed  with  the  plasmid  using  standard  techniques  to  generate  the 
recombinant strain E. coli for production of G-CSF. The MCB and WCB for the commercial process 
were laid down according to cGMP. The cell banks were adequately addressed and stored. 
•  Specification 
During  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  procedure,  the  applicant  has  amended  the  active 
substance  release-  and  end  of  shelf-life  specifications  according  to  the  requirements  of  the  CHMP. 
The  current  specifications,  including  the  acceptance  limits,  are  thereby  considered  as  justified  and 
acceptable. 
•  Stability 
Data on three batches produced at commercial scale and stored in the current container closure system 
was provided. Therefore, the storage of the active substance for 12 months at 5 ± 3°C was considered 
acceptable. 
6/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Comparability exercise for Active Substance 
Extensive  characterisation  studies  have  been  performed  using  a  large  number  of  batches  of  XM02 
active  substance,  produced  at  the  commercial  scale  process.  Throughout  the  product  development 
programme,  the  applicant  has  simultaneously  with  the  characterisation  of  XM02  active  substance 
conducted comparability studies with Neupogen. 
The XM02 active substance has been characterised for molecular mass, primary amino acid sequence, 
spectral properties (fluorescence emission spectroscopy and circular dichroism), isoform distribution, 
hydrophobic  properties,  purity  and  potency.  The  characteristics  of  XM02  active  substance  were 
compared  to  the  medicinal  reference  product,  Neupogen  and  found  to  be  similar.  The  analytical 
methods used were properly described and validation reports for the methods were provided and found 
acceptable. 
Medicinal Product 
Both the XM02 medicinal product and the reference medicinal product Neupogen are aqueous liquid 
formulations of similar composition. The two formulations differ only in pH and in the concentration 
of filgrastim and of polysorbate 80. 
•  Pharmaceutical development 
A  satisfactory  presentation  of  the  XM02  medicinal  product  pharmaceutical  development  was 
provided.  The  medicinal  product  is  supplied  in  1  ml  glass,  single-use,  pre-filled  syringes  in  two 
strengths: 
- 
- 
30  MIU/0.5  ml  dosage  strength  containing  300  μg  of  filgrastim  active  substance,  to  give  a 
0.5 ml extractable volume 
48  MIU/0.8  ml  dosage  strength  containing  480  μg  of  filgrastim  active  substance,  to  give  a 
0.8 ml extractable volume 
The  liquid  formulation  requires  no  reconstitution  and,  depending  on  the  indication,  it  may  be  given 
subcutaneously or intravenously. 
The  concentration  of  medicinal  product  bulk  solution  is  0.6  mg/ml  and  the  difference  in  the  two 
strengths is achieved by the different fill volumes. The two strengths correspond to those marketed for 
the  reference  medicinal  product,  Neupogen.  However,  Neupogen  syringes  contain  filgrastim  at 
0.6 mg/ml for the 30 MIU/0.5 ml strength and at 0.96 mg/ml for the 48 MIU/0.5 ml strength. 
Each strength is to be supplied in packs of one, five, two x five, or ten pre-filled syringes. The liquid 
formulation  is  an  acetate-buffered,  sterile,  isotonic  solution  for  injection.  The  formulation  of  XM02 
medicinal  product  has  the  same  excipients  as  Neupogen,  i.e  acetic  acid,  polysorbate  80,  sodium 
hydroxide, sorbitol and water for injections. 
If  necessary,  the  XM02  medicinal  product  may  be  used  as  a  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion, 
diluted  in  5%  glucose.  For  patients  treated  with  XM02  medicinal  product  diluted  to  give  filgrastim 
concentrations below 1.5 MIU (15 μg) per ml, human serum albumin (HSA) should be added to a final 
concentration of 2 mg/ml. Neither solution is supplied with the XM02 medicinal product. 
During medicinal product formulation, the excipients are compounded as a buffer prior to mixing with 
the  active  substance.  A  portion  of  the  final  excipient  content  also  derives  from  the  active  substance 
formulation. The product is sterilised by filtration and filled into 1 ml siliconised glass (Ph. Eur. Type 
I)  syringes  with  fixed  needle  and  needle  shield,  Flue  Fluorotec-faced  bromobutyl  rubber  plunger 
stopper  (Ph.  Eur  3.2.9)  and  a  polypropylene  plunger  rod.  The  syringes  are  overfilled  to  ensure  the 
correct expellable volume. 
•  Adventitious agents 
The  risk  assessment  on  adventitious  agents  was  adequately  performed  and  described.  The  raw 
materials  for  the  manufacture  of  XM02  active  substance  and  medicinal  product  are  subject  to 
microbiological  quality  control.  Three  materials  of  biological  origin  are  used  in  routine  production; 
7/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bacterial  host  strain  E. coli,  casamino  acids  used  as  a  fermentation  medium  component  and 
polysorbate 80 used as a component of the formulation. The starting material of the casamino acids is 
bovine milk deemed fit for human consumption from healthy animals of New Zealand origin. As such, 
this  material  is  compliant  with  the  requirements  to  minimise  TSE  risks  laid  out  in  the  Note  for 
Guidance on minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human 
and veterinary medicinal products (EMEA/410/01). Furthermore, the hydrolysis process involves acid 
treatment at pH ≤1.0, 120°C for a minimum of six hours. It is expected that these conditions should be 
more than sufficient to inactivate any adventitious viruses. The polysorbate 80 used as an excipient is 
of vegetable origin, and therefore does not constitute a virus safety risk. Because the fermentation of 
E. coli does not support growth of viruses, no viral clearance studies have been performed. 
•  Manufacture of the product 
Manufacture of XM02 medicinal product pre-filled syringes takes place at Lemery SA de CV, Mexico 
and employs a straightforward process, including compounding, sterile filtrations and aseptic filling. 
The approvable range for control parameters such as mixing times, hold times, temperature, and filling 
rates have been defined and tests for in process control were described. The process validation studies 
were considered acceptable. Results from the validation of shipping of medicinal product to the sites 
used  for  packaging,  labelling  and  release  ensure  that  transportation  is  conducted  under  controlled 
conditions and that the quality of medicinal product is not affected. 
•  Product specification 
The batch release specifications for the medicinal product are based on results from batch consistency 
testing and are considered acceptable. Appropriate tests (including tests for identity, purity, content, 
pharmaceutical tests and microbiological tests) and limits have been provided.  
•  Characterisation of impurities 
The  applicant  has  presented  an  overview  of  product  related  impurities  detected  by  SE-HPLC, 
RP-HPLC,  IE-HPLC,  IEF  and  SDS-PAGE.  The  methods  used  for  impurity  control  are  essentially 
identical for both active substance and medicinal product. Validation of the methods has however been 
appropriately addressed separately for the active substance and the medicinal product.  
•  Stability of the product 
Adequately designed stability studies have been reported, being in compliance with the requirements 
in the ICH Q5C guideline. In these studies, stability of the medicinal product is demonstrated over the 
proposed storage time of 24 months at 5±3°C. 
The results from cool-chain interruption, freeze/thaw and transport deviation confirms the stability of 
the  XM02  medicinal  product  under  the  conditions  studied.  Thus,  the  proposed  storage  time  of  24 
months at 5 ± 3°C is considered acceptable. 
•  Comparability exercise for Medicinal Product 
The  applicant  performed  extensive  state-of-the-art  characterisation  studies  to  show  biosimilarity 
between XM02 medicinal product and the chosen reference medicinal product. The composition, the 
physical properties, the primary and higher order structures and the biological activity of XM02 and 
Neupogen sourced from Amgen Germany have been assessed and found to be similar. 
The  applicant  has  characterised  XM02  medicinal  product  related  impurities  in  comparison  with  the 
reference medicinal product Neupogen to support the claim of biosimilarity of the two products. The 
product related impurity profiles between XM02 medicinal product and Neupogen were shown to be 
similar. The conclusion is based on impurity testing in stability studies as well as on the experimental 
evidences from comparability studies. 
A major objection was raised regarding the source of the reference medicinal product, as the applicant 
appeared  to  have  used  Neupogen  from  three  different  sources:  Amgen  Germany;  Amgen  Lithuania 
and Roche Lithuania. The reference medicinal product must be a medicinal product authorised in the 
Community  on  the  basis  of  a  complete  dossier  and  at  the  time  of  the  study,  Lithuania  was  not  a 
member of the EU. It was unclear whether an EU authorised medicinal product was used as reference 
in  the  analyses  for  product-related  impurities  by  RP-HPLC  and  IE-HPLC.  In  the  responses,  the 
8/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
applicant provided both a summary of the data provided in the original dossier and new data regarding 
the product-related impurity profile as detected by RP-HPLC and IE-HPLC. The data confirmed that 
the  XM02  medicinal  product  contains  comparable  or  fewer  product-related  impurities  compared  to 
Neupogen sourced from Amgen, Germany. Together with the comparability exercise submitted in the 
original  dossier,  the  comparability  between  XM02  medicinal  product  and  Neupogen  has  been  fully 
demonstrated  using  an  EU  authorised  medicinal  product  as  reference  (i.e.  Neupogen  sourced  from 
Amgen, Germany). All data produced with Neupogen from Lithuania can be regarded as supportive. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The dossier was found to be of good quality, fulfilling the requirements for marketing authorisation of 
a  similar  biological  medicinal  product.  Extensive  comparability  studies  were  performed  using 
Neupogen,  sourced  from  Germany,  as  the  reference  medicinal  product.  The  characterisation  of  the 
active substance and the comparability studies are considered acceptable. 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

•  Primary pharmacodynamics 
Primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  (key  elements  described  in  Table  1)  comprised  in  vitro  studies 
assessing  comparability  of  receptor  binding  and  biological  activity  between  XM02  and  Neupogen 
(Studies  XM02-PPD-0.01,  XM02-PPD-0.02,  XM02-PPD-0.03)  and  in  vivo  studies  in  neutropenic 
mice 
rats 
(Study XM02-RT4w-2.01)  and  monkeys  (Study  XM02-PKPD-6.01)  to  support  similar/equivalent 
pharmacological activity of XM02 compared to Neupogen. 
(Studies  XM02-PPD1-01  and  XM02-PPD1-02) 
in  healthy 
as  well 
as 
In vitro studies 
Comparison  of  the  binding  of  XM02  and  Neupogen  to  the  human  G-CSF  receptor 
(Study XM02-PPD-0.01) 
The  results  demonstrate  that  the  binding  of  human  G-CSF  receptor  and  XM02  or  Neupogen  was 
specific  and  dose  dependent.  In  addition,  the  binding  affinities  for  XM02  and  Neupogen  to  the 
receptor were similar. 
Relative  potency  determination  of  XM02  and  Neupogen  with  M-NFS-60  cell 
(Studies XM02-PPD-0.02 and XM02-PPD-0.03) 
The data indicate that both, XM02 and Neupogen bind to the murine cellular G-CSF receptors with the 
same affinity and that both preparations are equally effective in inducing a cellular proliferation.

In vivo studies 
Effects  of  XM02  and  Neupogen  in  a  cyclophosphamide-induced  neutropenic  mouse  model 
(Studies XM02-PPD1-01) 
Blood  sampling  on  Day  3  was  suboptimal  and  only  1-4/6  samples  per  treatment  group  could  be 
analysed, therefore Day 3 results cannot be regarded as appropriate. 
On Day 5, neutrophil counts in cyclophosphamide (CPA) group were significantly lower than in the 
control  group.  XM02-  and  Neupogen–treatments  increased  neutrophil  counts  in  CPA-deprived 
animals;  in  both  XM02  and  Neupogen  groups  the  effect  of  the  highest  dose  (5.0 µg/kg)  was  also 
statistically  significant.  The  dose-response  curves  of  XM02  and  Neupogen  were  very  similar.  There 
were no deaths during the study and no abnormal clinical observations were noted. 
Effects  of  XM02  and  Neupogen  in  a  cyclophosphamide-induced  neutropenic  mouse  model 
(Study  XM02-PPD1-02)  including  results  of  meta-analysis  of  Studies  XM02-PPD1-01  and 
XM02-PPD1-02 
The study had an identical protocol as the Study XM02-PPD1-01 which was repeated due to problems 
in blood sampling on Day 3. 
On Days 3 and 5, neutrophil counts in CPA group were significantly lower than in the control group. 
XM02-  and  Neupogen–treatments  increased  neutrophil  counts  in  CPA-deprived  animals.  On  Day  3, 
there  was  a  linear  relationship  between  the  neutrophil  count  and  the  log10  dose  level,  and  that 
dose-response relationship was not significantly different between XM02 and Neupogen. On Day 5, 
there was a linear relationship between log10 neutrophil count and the log10 dose level and it was found 
that the dose-response relationship was significantly different between Neupogen and XM02 (XM02 
having a smaller effect) but they were parallel. There were no deaths during the study and no abnormal 
clinical observations were noted. 
Since the protocols in Studies XM02-PPD1-01 and XM02-PPD1-02 were similar, a meta-analysis of 
the results was carried out. According to relative potency estimation for Day 3, it can be estimated that 
the  effect  on  neutrophil  count  of  1.0  µg/kg  of  XM02  is  equivalent  to  the  effect  of  2.4  µg/kg  of 
Neupogen.  The  value  of  1.0  was  included  in  the  95%  CI  (0.98,  7.42)  of  the  relative  potency.  For 
Day 5, the dose-response relationships were not significantly different between Neupogen and XM02 
but were parallel. Therefore, the relative potency between Neupogen and XM02 cannot be assessed for 
Day 5.  The  results  of  the  meta-analysis  were  not  unequivocal  but  XM02  and  Neupogen  induced 
neutrophilia  to  a  similar  extent  in  neutropenic  mice  and  there  was  a  tendency  towards  comparable 
potencies in terms of the in vivo biological activity of XM02 and Neupogen.

Comparison of pharmacological response between XM02 and Neupogen in healthy rats after s.c. 
administration (Study XM02-RT4w-2.01) 
Although  low-  and  high-dose  XM02  treated  male  animals  had  a  statistical  significant  lower  mean 
ANC  at  the  end  of  the  first  treatment  period  than  males  treated  with  a  corresponding  doses  of 
Neupogen,  there  were  no  consistent  differences  in  ANC  between  XM02  and  Neupogen-treated 
animals. A clear difference was noted between male and female animals treated with either XM02 or 
Neupogen. 
Regardless  of  the  medicinal  product  and  the  dose  level,  the  pharmacodynamic  response  was 
substantially lower in females than in males. 
Effects  of  XM02  on  haematology  in  monkeys  upon  single  s.c.  or  i.v.  administration 
(Study XM02-PKPD-6.01) 
No treatment-related changes of behaviour, external appearance, faeces or body weight were recorded. 
None of the monkeys died prematurely. Two monkeys showed a haematoma of 0.5 cm diameter and 
one monkey showed a haematoma of 1.0 cm diameter after the 2nd and 3rd test days at the site of i.v. 
injection,  respectively.  Monkeys  that  received  s.c. injections  of  XM02  showed  no  local  tolerance 
reactions at the injection site. 
Treatment with XM02 resulted in increases in leukocytes, neutrophilic granulocytes and monocytes. 
The  number  of  lymphocytes  was  decreased.  Maximum  changes  were  evident  4  to  8 hours  after 
administration  and  lasted  for  > 48 hours.  No  significant  differences  were  observed  between  i.v.  and 
s.c. administration. A significant increase in neutrophils was observed in both i.v. and s.c. groups. The 
response appeared to be somewhat stronger in the animals that had received the drug by the s.c. route. 
This  difference  was  not,  however,  statistically  significant.  A  decreasing  trend  in  haemoglobin,  RBC 
and  haematocrit  values  could  be  seen  but  these  changes  were  not  statistically  significant.  The 
lobularity  index  fell  close  to  zero  at  8  hours  in  the  s.c.  treatment  group  but  was  normalised  by 
48 hours. No treatment-related effect was determined for the number of platelets, the thromboplastin 
time, the mean corpuscular volume and the mean corpuscular haemoglobin. 
•  Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Determination  of  the  proliferation  promoting  effects  of  XM02  in  comparison  to  Neupogen  on 
human malignant cell lines (Study XM02-SPD-0.01) 
G-CSF  stimulates  the  proliferation  and  differentiation  of  granulocytic  progenitor  cells  and  mature 
neutrophils. G-CSF can also affect non-haematopoietic tumour cells which express functional G-CSF 
receptors. In this study, the effects of XM02 and Neupogen as a control compound were investigated 
on cell proliferation in 5 human tumour cell lines. 
All  the  cell  lines  originate  from  the  ATCC.  Using  treatment  times  of  72  or  144 hours  and  G-CSF 
concentrations of 10 pg/ml–100 µg/ml and assaying cell proliferation with MTS/PMS viable cell dye, 
no effect on cell proliferation by the G-CSF products was found. 
•  Safety pharmacology programme 
Despite  the  absence  of  a  recommendation  in  the  CHMP  guidance  on  similar  medicinal  product 
containing  rG-CSF  (EMEA/CHMP/BWP/31329/2005),  in  vivo  studies  were  conducted  to  assess  the 
potential  of  XM02  to  affect  vital  functions  using  classical  safety  pharmacology  tests.  The  safety 
pharmacology studies (key elements described in Table 1) included evaluation of the effects of XM02 
on  the  respiratory  system  in  rats  (Study  XM02-SPRS-2.01),  on  the  central  nervous  system  in  rats 
(Study XM02-SPCNS-2.01)  and  on  the  cardiovascular  system  in  dogs  (Study XM02-SPCV-5.01). 
These studies were conducted in compliance with GLP regulations. 
Effect of XM02 on the respiratory system in rats (Study XM02-SPRS-2.01) 
No  overall  treatment-related  change  in  the  measured  respiratory  parameters  was  found.  Minor  but 
statistically significant differences between treated and control animals were found in absolute values 
of  tidal  volume  at  pre-dose  and  120  min  post-dose  and  in  baseline-adjusted  (change  from  pre-dose) 
values and occasionally respiratory minute volume at 120, 150, 180, 210, 225, 240 and 360 minutes 
13/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
post-dose.  There  were  no  unscheduled  deaths  or  adverse  clinical  signs  observed  following 
administration of a high dose of XM02. 
Effects of XM02 on the central nervous system in rats (Study XM02-SPCNS-2.01) 
The  modified  Irwin  screen  test  was  performed  once  pre-treatment  and  at  1,  2,  4,  24  and  48  hours 
post-treatment  and  the  following  parameters  were  examined:  body  position;  restlessness;  writhing; 
stereotypic behaviour; convulsions; twitches and tremors; grooming; ease of removal; gait; palpebral 
closure;  piloerection;  respiratory  rate/pattern;  locomotor  activity  level;  defecation/urination;  escape 
response;  lacrimation;  pupil  size;  salivation;  diarrhoea;  body  tone;  staub  tail;  cutaneous  blood  flow; 
corneal  reflex;  pinna  reflex;  tail  pinch;  auricular  startle;  righting  reflex;  positional  passivity; 
vocalisation;  and  geotropism.  No  pharmacologically  significant  differences  between  XM02-treated 
and control animals were detected. 
Blood  and  urine  samples  were  collected  for  analysis  on  days  3  and  14/15.  No  toxicologically 
significant changes were detected in the analysed parameters. However, significant increases in total 
white blood cell counts, neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes were found in males and females on 
day 3  but  the  changes  were  no  longer  apparent  on  day  15.  Neither  deaths,  treatment-related  clinical 
signs, nor treatment-related gross histopathological findings were detected. 
Effects of XM02 on the cardiovascular system in the dog (Study XM02-SPCV-5.01) 
Haemodynamic  measures  remained  within  normal  ranges  throughout  the  observation  period  in  all 
animals. Electrocardiograms showed no treatment-related changes. No mortality or treatment-related 
clinical signs were noted. 
•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies are not required for biosimilar products. 
Pharmacokinetics 
According to the guideline EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005, pharmacokinetic experiments are not 
required  for  the  development  of  biosimilar  products.  However,  pharmacokinetic  studies  with  XM02 
(key  elements  described  in  Table  1)  were  performed.  A  monkey  study  investigated  the  plasma 
disposition of XM02 after a single i.v. or s.c. administration (Study XM02-PK-6.01). This was also 
documented in conjunction with a 26-week s.c. toxicity study (Study XM02-RT26w-6.01). In rats, the 
plasma  pharmacokinetics  was  documented  after  a  single  dose  and  after  28  daily  s.c.  doses 
(Study XM02-PK-2.01).  In  conjunction  with  a  comparative  immunogenicity  study  in  rats,  the 
pharmacokinetics of XM02 was compared to that of Neupogen (Study XM02-RT4w-2.01). 
Toxicokinetic results are reported in the toxicology section. 
Methods of analysis 
An  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  was  used  to  quantify  XM02  in  rat  plasma  in 
Studies  XM02-PK-2.01,  XM02-SPCNS-2.01  and  XM02-RT26w-6.01.  A  human  G-CSF 
immunoassay was used to quantify XM02 in monkey plasma in the Study XM02-PK-6.01.

Since Cmax and AUC parameters were virtually identical following repeated dosing and the half-lives 
were  considered  similar,  it  was  considered  that  the  kinetics  of  XM02  in  rat  plasma  remained 
unchanged following repeated s.c. dosing. 
Pharmacokinetics of XM02 following s.c. injection in rats (Study XM02-RT4w-2.01) 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  XM02  and  Neupogen  were  also  investigated  in  rats  in  association  with  a 
comparative  immunogenicity  study  (key  elements  described  in  Table 1).  The  plasma  concentration 
time  profiles  of  XM02  over  the  three  dose  levels  (single  dose)  are  given  in  Figure 2  and

The  pharmacokinetics  after  a  single  s.c.  injection  of  XM02  were  linearly  related  to  dose  with  an 
absorption Tmax of 1 or 2 hours and a mean elimination half-life of approximately 2.5 hours in males 
and  somewhat  shorter  half-life  (1.6  hours)  in  females.  At  day  42,  the  elimination  half-life  became 
shorter  and  the  relative  exposure  tended  to  increase  with  dose.  In  females,  a  slightly  decreased 
clearance with time and, hence, a slight accumulation with time was noted.

to  the  requirements  in  the  guideline  EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005,  the  repeat-dose  toxicity 
studies were non-comparative. However, the applicant had sought scientific advice and CHMP was of

•  Repeat-dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity study (with a 4-week interim study) in rats (Study XM02-RT26w-2.01) and 
repeat-dose toxicity study (with a 4-week interim study) in monkeys (Study XM02-RT26w-6.01) 
In  rats,  the  main  toxicological  finding  was  swelling  of  hindlimbs/hindpaws  and/or  forepaws, 
necessitating  premature  sacrifice  in  mid-  and  high-dose  animals.  Macroscopically,  all  dose  groups 
showed enlargement of the tarsal joint with histological findings of osteopathy primarily in mid- and 
high-dose  males  but  also  occasionally  in  females.  An  increased  incidence  of  hyperostosis, 
osteodystrophy  and/or  physeal  dystrophy  was  observed  also  in  the  femoro-tibial  joint  of  mid-  and 
high-dose  animals.  Dose-related  increases  in  serum  alkaline  phosphatase  were  consistent  with  the 
increased bone turnover. 
Bone changes following G-CSF treatment have been observed in rodents and humans, as a result of 
increased bone resorption mediated by osteoclast activation. The effect is regarded as an extension of 
the pharmacological effect of G-CSF. 
Findings  more  clearly  related  to  the  primary  pharmacological  effect  consisted  of  a  dose-related 
increase  in  neutrophil  count  and  increases  in  other  white  blood  cells  in  mid-and  high-dose  animals. 
These groups also showed reductions in red blood cell count, haemoglobin concentration and increases 
in reticulocyte count consistent with observations made in other rat studies with rG-CSF. 
In  monkeys,  a  drug-related  but  not  strongly  dose-related  local  irritant  effect  was  observed  at  the 
injection  sites.  Effects  on  bone  were  less  marked  than  in  the  rat  study  with  no  clinical  symptoms 
linked  to  the  observed  hyperostosis  that  affected  the  periosteum  and/or  endosteum  of  high-dose 
animals.  Dose-related  increases  in  the  primary  pharmacodynamic  parameter,  neutrophil  count,  were 
generally  similar  at  the  4-,  12-  and  26-week  readings  with  increases  in  other  white  blood  cells  and 
smaller decreases in red blood cell count and haemoglobin as also observed in the rat study. 
Table  6  summarises  the  comparative  findings  in  toxicology  studies  with  XM02  and  those  from  a 
review of existing data for Neupogen.

Exposure was slightly higher in males. Elimination half-time was clearly increased from Days 1 to 28 
in  both  males  and  females.  Concomitant  increase  in  exposure  indicates  accumulation  of  XM02. 
Although Cmax from Days 1 to 28 decreased slightly, exposure as assessed by AUC increased. This, 
together  with  changes  in  t1/2  and  clearance  measurements  from  Days  1  to  28  suggested  a  slight 
decrease in XM02 elimination from plasma over time. In general, the Cmax and AUC in high-dose were 
approximately 19 and 5-fold higher than the corresponding exposures in humans given a s.c. dose of 
10 μg/kg.

Generally,  the  exposure  (AUC)  was  3-  to  5-fold  higher  in  humans  than  in  rats  at  the  corresponding 
dose level 5 µg/kg (Table 9). Toxicokinetics in monkeys were measured only in high-dose (125 µg/kg) 
animals. In both rats and monkeys, a slightly increased exposure was observed in males. Many of the 
toxicological  findings  in  rats  were  clearly  more  profound  in  males  than  in  females.  Also,  the 
pharmacological  response  appeared  to  be  different  in  male  and  female  rats,  females  being  less 
responsive. In monkeys this effect was not evident.

•  Local tolerance 
Local tolerance of XM02 following a single administration to rabbits (Study XM02-LT-4.01) 
Evaluation of the injection sites according to the Draize criteria up to 4 days post-dose revealed no test 
article-related  irritant  potential  after  intravenous,  intramuscular,  intra-arterial,  subcutaneous  or 
peri-venous administration, either through macroscopic or microscopic evaluation.

Similarly  to  the  first  study,  no  irritant  potential  of  XM02  after  intravenous,  intramuscular, 
intra-arterial, subcutaneous and peri-venous administration either through macroscopic or microscopic 
evaluation was observed. 
•  Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Repeat-dose  toxicity  study  on  XM02  vs.  Neupogen  daily  s.c.  injection  in  rats  (Study 
XM02-RT4w-2.01) 
The administration scheme (2 weeks of treatment followed by a 2-week treatment-free period and then 
followed by another 2 weeks of treatment) was chosen following Scientific Advice from the EMEA in 
order to fulfil several requirements: 
•  overall treatment duration of 28 days 
•  daily administrations 
• 
treatment interruption of 2 weeks: 
o 
imitates the clinical situation of a chemotherapy patient treated in a chemotherapy cycle 
with a duration of 4 weeks 
is applied in standard immunisation protocols and could therefore possibly stimulate the 
immune response to the proteins 
o 
• 
antibody  determination  after  a  treatment-free  interval  avoids  interference  of  the  test  serum 
antigen, minimises immune complexes and therefore the antibody results are more reliable. 
The  s.c.  route  was  chosen  because  this  is  the  predominant  route  for  administration  of  XM02  to 
humans.  Main  study  animals  were  left  for  a  treatment-free  period  of  2  weeks  after  the  final  drug 
administration. 
The assessment of antibody formation was done sequentially where initially all samples were screened 
for anti-XM02 and anti-Neupogen IgG and IgM antibodies. The qualitative assessment of the antibody 
response  showed  a  higher  antibody  response  to  XM02  compared  to  Neupogen  in  the  lowest  dose  at 
Day 56 but a lower antibody response in the highest dose at both time points (Figure 3).

In  the  quantitative  xMAP  assay,  76  out  of  the  92  samples  that  tested  positive  in  the  screening  test 
could be quantified for their IgG anti-XM02 and anti-Neupogen antibodies. This would suggest that 
the non-quantifiable antibodies (approximately 17%) were IgM antibodies. The median concentration 
of IgG antibodies in the Day 28 samples was similar for the two compounds but somewhat higher in 
samples  from  Neupogen  treated  animals  collected  on  Day 56.  The  maximum  IgG  antibody 
concentration was also higher in Neupogen-treated animals at the last sampling time (Table 10).

Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The lack of an environmental risk assessment for XM02 is justified by three reasons: 
4  According to EMEA guideline CHMP/SWP/4447/00 proteins in general are unlikely to result in 
significant risk to the environment. 
5  XM02  active  substance  is  a  recombinant  protein,  which  is  very  similar  to  naturally  occurring 
human G-CSF. Therefore no potentially harmful effects to the environment are expected. 
6  XM02  is  a  biosimilar  product  of  existing  G-CSF.  It  is  intended  to  substitute  for  other  identical 
products  on  the  market.  The  approval  of  XM02  should  not  result  in  an  increase  of  the  total 
quantity released into the environment.

2.4  Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Filgrastim  (recombinant  human  granulocyte  colony  stimulating  factor,  rG-CSF)  is  a  haematopoietic 
growth  factor  that  regulates  the  production  and  function  of  neutrophils.  Filgrastim  controls  the 
proliferation  of  committed  progenitor  cells  and  influences  their  maturation  into  mature  neutrophils. 
Filgrastim also stimulates the release of neutrophils from bone marrow storage pools and reduces their 
maturation  time.  Filgrastim  acts  to  increase  the  phagocytic  activity  of  mature  neutrophils.  The  first 
filgrastim product was introduced in 1991 under the trade name Neupogen. 
Of  note,  throughout  the  report,  XM02  will  be  used  to  identify  the  filgrastim  under  evaluation  and 
Neupogen (manufactured by Roche or Amgen) for the reference product. 
The formulation of XM02 has the same excipients as Neupogen and is quantitatively very similar. In 
order to show the biosimilarity between XM02 and Neupogen, the clinical programme is composed of 
5 clinical studies, summarised in Table 11 and focuses on showing the clinical equivalence of XM02 
and  Neupogen  in  all  respects,  i.e.  clinical  pharmacology  in  2 phase I  studies,  efficacy  and  safety  in 
3 phase III studies.

Pharmacokinetics 
According  to  the  Annex  to  the  Guideline  on  Similar  Biological  Medicinal  Products  containing 
Biotechnology-Derived Proteins as Active Substance: Non-Clinical and Clinical Issues - Guidance on 
Biosimilar  Medicinal  Products  containing  Recombinant  Granulocyte-Colony  Stimulating  Factor 
(CHMP/31329/05), the pharmacokinetic properties of the similar biological medicinal product and the 
reference medicinal product should be compared in single-dose cross-over studies using subcutaneous 
and  intravenous  administration.  The  primary  pharmacokinetic  parameter  should  be  AUC  and  the 
secondary PK parameters Cmax and t½. 
Comparative  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  designed  to  demonstrate  clinical  comparability  between 
the  similar  biological  medicinal  product  and  the  reference  medicinal  product  with  regard  to  key 
and

Data analysis 
The  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  calculated  from  serum  concentrations  of  r-MetHuG-CSF  (test 
and reference product) using non-compartmental procedures. The primary pharmacokinetic objective 
was AUC0-t and secondary objectives were Cmax, AUC0-inf, tmax, T1/2, and λz. 
The equivalence between the test and reference products was tested by parametric and non-parametric 
approaches.  Parametric  (normal-theory)  methods  (analyses  of  variance  [ANOVA])  were  applied  for 
the  analysis  of  log-transformed  parameters  (AUC0-t,  AUC0-inf,  Cmax,  t1/2).  Non  log-transformed 
parameters (tmax) were evaluated by nonparametric tests. ANOVA point estimates with coefficients of 
variation  (CV)  and  90%  confidence  intervals  (CI)  are  given  in  for  the  test/reference  ratios  of  the

On the basis of the primary target parameter AUC0-t, the equivalence between XM02 and Neupogen in 
both dose groups after either s.c. or i.v. administration was demonstrated. 
After i.v. administration, there was a dose-proportional increase of AUC0-t and Cmax from the 5 to the 
10 µg/kg dose. After s.c. administration, there was a 3-fold increase of AUC0-t and Cmax from the 5 to 
the 10 µg/kg dose. The absolute bioavailability of s.c. XM02 was 33 and 45% for the 5 and 10 µg/kg 
doses, respectively.

Study objectives 
The  primary  study  objective  was  the  comparison  of  the  pharmacodynamic  parameters  (ANCmax, 
ANCAUC,  ANCtmax)  of  XM02  and  Neupogen  after  s.c.  administration  of  5  μg/kg  or  10 μg/kg  ,  in 
healthy male subjects. 
The secondary study objectives were: 
- 
comparison  of  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  (Cmax,  AUC,  Tmax,  T1/2,  λz  )  of  XM02  and 
Neupogen after s.c. administration of 5 μg/kg in healthy male subjects; 
comparison  of  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  (Cmax,  AUC,  Tmax,  T1/2,  λz  )  of  XM02  and 
Neupogen after s.c. administration of 10 μg/kg in healthy male subjects; 
collection of tolerability and safety data; 
calculation of the relative bioavailability (F) of XM02 formulation versus Neupogen; 
comparison of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters of 5 and 10 μg/kg doses of 
XM02.

In  both  dose  and  treatment  groups,  mean  G-CSF  serum  concentrations  rapidly  increased,  reached  a 
maximum around 5 hours, and decreased to pre-dose values at 24 hours. 
ANOVA demonstrated equivalence of XM02 and Neupogen with regard to pharmacokinetic variables 
in both 5 and 10 μg/kg dose groups after a single s.c. injection. CIs for all log-transformed and non 
log-transformed variables  (AUC0-t, AUC0-∝, Cmax and tmax, λz, respectively) were enclosed  within the 
80-125%  acceptance  intervals  for  both  dose  regimens.  The  variable  t1/2  was  enclosed  within  the  80-
125% acceptance interval for the 5 μg/kg but not for the 10 μg/kg dose. 
The relative bioavailability of XM02 versus Neupogen was estimated to be 1.12 for the 5 μg/kg dose 
and  1.04  for  the  10  μg/kg  dose.  Serum  concentrations  and  AUC  of  G-CSF  increased  over-
proportionally after a 10 μg/kg dose compared to a 5 μg/kg dose.

In all cycles and profiles, mean G-CSF serum concentrations reached a maximum around 4 to 6 hours 
and decreased to pre-dose values at 24 hours (as in healthy volunteers). Mean AUC and Cmax values of 
G-CSF in cycle 1 were slightly higher in the cancer patients compared to healthy volunteers, as might 
be  expected  for  patients  with  poor  clinical  condition.  There  were  no  signs  of  accumulation  after 
repeated dosing in cancer patients (in all 3 studies, mean serum concentrations of G-CSF were lower 
in cycle 4 than in cycle 1). 
•  Special populations 
According to the guidance, PK investigations in special populations (e.g., hepatic or renal impairment, 
elderly, etc.) are not required for products claimed to be biosimilar. 
Pharmacodynamics 
•  Mechanism of action 
Endogenous  G-CSF  is  a  haematopoietic  cytokine  and  is  a  lineage-specific  colony-stimulating  factor 
that  is  produced  by  monocytes,  fibroblasts  and  endothelial  cells.  G-CSF  regulates  the  production  of 
neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor proliferation, differentiation, and 
selected  cell-functional  activation  (including  enhanced  phagocytic  ability,  priming  of  the  cellular 
metabolism associated with respiratory burst, antibody-dependent killing, and the increased expression 
of some functions associated with cell-surface antigens). G-CSF is not species-specific and has been 
shown to have minimal direct in vivo or in vitro effects on the production of haematopoietic cell types 
other than the neutrophil lineage. 
The  human  form  of  G-CSF  is  a  glycoprotein  composed  of  a  single  polypeptide  chain  of  174  or 
177 amino  acids.  XM02  is  a  recombinant  human  granulocyte-colony  stimulating  factor  produced  in 
E. coli,  yielding  a  protein  without  glycosylation  and  with  an  N-terminal  methionyl  extension 
(rmetHuG-CSF,  INN  filgrastim).  It  stimulates  the  proliferation,  differentiation  and  activation  of  late 
progenitor cells of the granulocyte lineage, as well as enhances the activity of mature neutrophils. 
•  Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Primary  and  secondary  pharmacology  is  based  on  the  two  phase I  studies  that  compared  the 
pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  XM02  and  Neupogen  in  healthy  volunteers 
(Studies XM02-05-DE and XM02-01-LT).

As for the i.v. administration, in both treatment and dose groups a peak was observed around 72 hours 
after dosing following a single i.v. infusion. Values returned to baseline after 336 hours. 
ANOVA  demonstrated  equivalence  of  XM02  and  Neupogen  with  regard  to  the  pharmacodynamic 
variable CD34+ count in both the 5 and 10 μg/kg dose groups after both single s.c. injection and i.v. 
infusion.  CI  for  the  target  variables  CD34+  AUC0-t,  and  CD34+  Cmax  were  enclosed  within  the 
predefined 70-143% acceptance intervals for both dose regimens and administrations. 
Study XM02-01-LT 
The study objectives and design are described in the pharmacokinetics section. 
Results 
Median  age  was  21.5  years  (range  19  to  40  years).  Four  subjects  in  Group  A,  and  two  in  Group  B 
withdrew prematurely. 
In  both  treatment  groups,  there  was  an  initial  decrease  at  0.5–1  hour,  then  peak  ANC  values  were 
observed about 12 and 16 hours after a single s.c. injection of 5 or 10 μg/kg, respectively. ANC values 
returned to baseline values after 96 hours. 
ANOVA  demonstrated  equivalence  of  XM02  and  Neupogen  with  regard  to  the  pharmacodynamic 
variables in both the 5 and 10 μg/kg dose groups after single s.c. injection. CIs for all log transformed 
variables  (ANC  AUC0-t,  ANC  AUC0-inf,  ANCmax)  were  enclosed  within  the  80-125%  acceptance 
intervals for both dose regimens. The non-log-transformed variable ANCtmax was enclosed within the 
80-125%  acceptance  interval  for  the  5  μg/kg,  but  not  for  the  10  μg/kg  dose.  Administration  of  10 
μg/kg compared to 5 μg/kg of G-CSF did not yield a proportional increase in ANC. 
Clinical efficacy 
Clinical  efficacy  was  investigated  in  one  pivotal  study  (Study  XM02-02-INT)  concerning  efficacy, 
which  was  performed  in  patients  with  breast  cancer.  Two  other  studies  in  patients  with  lung  cancer 
and non-Hodgkin lymphoma focused on safety. 
In  all  3  studies,  blinding  of  the  investigator  and  patient  was  ensured.  Only  the  “drug  administrator” 
and the pharmacist were unblinded, due to the different volumes of formulated XM02 and Neupogen 
and body weight-dependent dosing. 
•  Dose response study(ies) 
As  this  application  concerns  a  biosimilar  product  and  the  bioequivalence  with  Neupogen  has  been 
demonstrated, no dose-response studies are needed. 
•  Main study(ies) 
There  is  one  pivotal  study  (Study  XM02-02-INT)  performed  in  patients  with  breast  cancer  with  the 
following  title:  Efficacy  and  Safety  of  XM02  compared  to  filgrastim  in  patients  with  breast  cancer 
receiving chemotherapy. A multinational, multicentre, randomised, controlled study 
METHODS 
Study participants 
This was a multicentre study conducted at 52 centres in 10 countries. 
Main inclusion criteria were: Adult female or  male patients of any ethnic origin with a diagnosis of 
breast cancer meeting all of the criteria listed below, could be included in the study: 
- 
breast  cancer  high  risk  stage  II,  III  or  IV  (classification  according  to  American  Joint 
Committee on Cancer [AJCC]); 
eligible to receive treatment with docetaxel/doxorubicin as routine CTX; 
- 
-  CTX naïve; 
-  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2; 
-  ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/l; 
32/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
adequate cardiac, hepatic and renal functions. 
Main non-inclusion criteria were:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
previous exposure to filgrastim, pegfilgrastim or lenograstim; 
underlying neuropathy of Grade 2 or higher; 
treatment with systemically active antibiotics within 72 hours before CTX; 
treatment with lithium; 
chronic use of oral corticosteroids; 
prior radiation therapy within 4 weeks before randomisation; 
prior bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. 
Treatments 
Patients  were  randomised  to  treatment  with  either  XM02,  Neupogen  or  placebo.  Patients  in  the 
placebo group switched to XM02 after completion of CTX cycle 1 (Figure 12). The CTX regimen in 
this study consisted of doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) i.v. bolus and docetaxel (75 mg/m2) at least 1 hour i.v. 
infusion on day 1 of each cycle (3 weeks per cycle). Up to 4 CTX cycles were given. Both drugs are 
known  to  cause  neutropenia  frequently.  The  study  drug  was  administered  daily  starting  1 day  after 
CTX was completed as an s.c. 5 μg/kg injection for at least 5 days and a maximum of 14 days in each 
cycle. The study drug was stopped, if an ANC of ≥ 10 x 109/l was reached after nadir.

Objectives 
The main study objective was to demonstrate the equivalence of XM02 and Neupogen in patients with 
breast  cancer  during  the  first  cycle  of  CTX  on  DSN  confirmed  by  assay  sensitivity  in  comparing 
XM02 versus placebo. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) during cycle 1. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
-  DSN,  defined  as  the  number  of  days  with  Grade  4  neutropenia  (ANC  < 0.5  x  109/l),  for 
- 
- 
cycles 2, 3 and 4; 
depth  of  ANC  nadir,  defined  as  the  patient’s  lowest  ANC  for  each  cycle,  for  cycles  1,  2,  3 
and 4; 
time to ANC recovery, defined as the time in days from CTX administration until the patient’s 
ANC increased to ≥ 2.0 x 109/l after the expected nadir, for cycles 1, 2, 3 and 4; 
33/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  (FN)  by  cycle  and  across  all  cycles.  FN  was  defined*  as 
“observed” FN when body temperature was > 38.5°C for > 1 hour (axillary measurement with 
a  calibrated  standard  device)  and  ANC  < 0.5  x  109/l,  both  measured  on  the  same  day  or 
“protocol-defined  FN”  for  patients  receiving  systemic  antibiotics  in  a  cycle  (since  intake  of 
antibiotics could have masked an otherwise occurring high body temperature); 
-  mortality. 
Sample size 
In order to show equivalence between XM02 and Neupogen, the two-sided 95% CI for the difference 
in DSN had to lie within the equivalence range  [-1  day, +1 day]. A sample size of 109 patients per 
active  treatment  group  was  necessary  to  have  90%  power  for  rejecting  the  null  hypothesis  of  a 
difference  in  mean  DSN  is  larger  than  1 day)  that  XM02  is  different  to  Neupogen  in  favour  of  the 
alternative  hypothesis  assuming  an  expected  difference  in  mean  DSN  of  < 0.25  days  and a  standard 
deviation of 1.7 days. 
Therefore,  it  was  planned  to  randomise  140  patients  into  each  active  treatment  group,  taking  into 
account the fact that there would be an attrition rate of about 20% for the PP analysis with respect to 
the  primary  endpoint.  An  additional  70  patients  were  randomised  into  the  placebo  arm  to  allow 
demonstration  of  sensitivity,  assuming  a  difference  of  2  days  between  XM02  and  placebo,  a  larger 
standard deviation of 5 days in the placebo arm, and 90% power. 
Randomisation 
Patients  were  randomly  assigned  in  a  2:2:1  ratio  to  receive  XM02,  Neupogen  or  placebo  using  an 
Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). 
Blinding (masking) 
Due to different fill volumes of XM02 and Neupogen and body-weight-dependent dosing, full double-
masking was not possible, but the following steps were undertaken to reduce possible bias: 
•  The  study  drug  was  administered  after  blood  sampling  (for  determination  of  the  ANC)  and  body 
temperature measurement had taken place. 
•  The  unmasked  drug  administrator  injected  the  exact  volume  of  the  study  drug  that  had  been 
calculated  with  respect  to  the  patient’s  body  weight  and  had  been  made  known  to  the  drug 
administrator via the IVRS. 
•  The drug administrator documented in the drug dispensation log the type of study drug administered 
(XM02, Neupogen or placebo), the volume prepared and administered and the batch number, and 
attached the tear-off label in the log. The investigator did not have access to the drug dispensation 
log. 
•  In a separate source document (“drug administrator’s diary”), the drug administrator documented all 
measured body temperature values, blood samples and study drug administrations. The diary did not 
contain information about the administered volume or the type of study drug (XM02, Neupogen, or 
placebo).  The  diary  was  provided  to  the  investigator  on  a  daily  basis,  and  the  investigator 
documented his or her review of this information. 
Statistical methods 
ANCOVA  was  applied  using  “DSN  in  Cycle  1”  as  dependent  variable,  including  the  factors 
“treatment”,  “country”  and  “adjuvant  vs.  metastatic  therapy”,  and  with  the  baseline  ANC  value  as 
covariates (last non-missing ANC value before chemotherapy, either at day 1 or at screening). 
Assay sensitivity was evaluated by comparing XM02 versus placebo for the full analysis set with the 
ANCOVA. At the next step, equivalence of XM02 and Neupogen was assessed based on the PP set, 
using  the  ANCOVA  model  to  calculate  a  two-sided  95%  confidence  interval  for  “XM02  minus 
*  These criteria were derived from the recommendations of the ESMO concerning primary G-CSF prophylaxis 
and were introduced into the XM02 clinical Phase III programme following scientific advice from the EMEA 
in June 2004, and discussed within a follow-up SAWG procedure in December 2004 
34/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                      
Neupogen”.  Equivalence  was  to  be  concluded  if  this  confidence  interval  lay  entirely  within  the 
equivalence rage [−1 day, +1 day], provided that assay sensitivity was confirmed in step 1. 
A  sequential  testing  procedure  was  used  to  assess  assay  sensitivity  and  equivalence.  First,  assay 
sensitivity was evaluated by comparing XM02 versus placebo for the FA Set with the ANCOVA. If 
the upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI for “XM02 minus placebo” was ≤ 0, assay sensitivity could 
be confirmed. Note that this was equivalent to the p-value for treatment comparison being ≤ 0.05 and 
mean DSN being smaller in the XM02 group. This sequential procedure guaranteed an overall type I 
error level of 5% at most. All other analyses of the primary or secondary endpoints were considered to 
be exploratory. 
Analysis Populations 
The statistical analysis was based on the following populations: 
•  Full Analysis (FA) Set: All randomised patients. 
•  Safety Set (SF): All patients who received at least one dose of study treatment (XM02, Neupogen 
or placebo). 
•  Per Protocol (PP) Set: All patients included the FA Set, who received at least one cycle of CTX, 
who  received  their  study  treatment  (XM02,  Neupogen  or  placebo)  and  who  did  not  have  any 
major protocol violations including violations of eligibility criteria. 
•  Pharmacokinetic (PK) Set: All patients selected for PK analyses. 
In the FA and PP Set, data from cycle 2 onwards of patients randomised to placebo, i.e., data of these 
patients after having switched to XM02, were only summarised descriptively as a separate study arm 
(i.e.,  they  were  not  pooled  with  the  original  XM02  treatment  arm)  and  were  not  used  for  formal 
efficacy comparisons of XM02 versus Neupogen.

Recruitment 
The  enrolment  period  started  on  30  December  2004  (first  patient  enrolled)  to  16  June  2005  and  the 
study was completed on 26 September 2005 (last patient’s final visit). 
Most  patients  were  enrolled  at  study  centres  in  Russia.  One  investigational  centre  was  the 
highest-enrolling  centre  (7.2%).  The  other  study  centres  enrolled  between  0.3  and  6.0%  of  patients 
overall. 
Conduct of the study 
The  protocol  for  this  study,  originally  dated  26 April 2004,  was  amended  3  times.  The  first 
amendment was dated 31 August 2004, i.e. prior to the initiation of the trial, and was based on CHMP 
Scientific  Advice.  Amendments  2  and  3  were  dated  January  2005,  were  based  on  CHMP  follow-up 
advice  and  did  not  affect  the  integrity  of  the  study,  even  though  the  study  had  been  ongoing  since 
December 2004. The final statistical analysis plan was dated December 2005.

Secondary endpoints 
Data of the secondary efficacy endpoints are presented for the FA set. 
Duration of severe neutropenia in cycles 2 to 4 
The  mean  DSN  in  cycles  2  to  4  was  similar  in  all  treatment  groups.  The  majority  of  patients  had  a 
DSN  of  0  days.  Overall,  DSN  ranged  from  0  to  6  days.  Mean  DSN  ranged  from  0.5  to  0.7  days  in 
cycles  2  to  4  in  all  treatment  groups.  In  cycle  4,  the  mean  DSN  was  0.7,  0.7,  and  0.6  days  in  the 
XM02, Neupogen and placebo/XM02 groups, respectively. 
ANC over time 
In  cycle  1  in  the  placebo  group,  mean  ANC  values  decreased  after  day  2  and  reached  a  nadir  on 
day 11,  whereas  in  the  XM02  and  Neupogen  groups,  mean  values  distinctly  increased,  reaching  a 
maximum  on  day  3  and  then  decreased  to  a  nadir  on  day  7.  Thereafter,  mean  values  in  the  active 
treatment groups increased again, reaching a maximum on day 11. On day 21, mean values returned to 
values as observed on day 1 in all treatment groups (Figure 13). 
Figure 13 
Study XM02-02-INT –Mean of absolute neutrophil count over time in cycle 1, full 
analysis set 
In  the  subsequent  cycles,  all  treatment  groups  demonstrated  the  same  trends  as  for  XM02  and 
Neupogen in cycle 1.

Depth of ANC nadir 
In  cycle  1,  the  mean  ANC  nadir  was  deeper  in  the  placebo  group  (0.163  x  109/l)  compared  to  the 
XM02 and Neupogen groups (0.655 x 109/l and 0.651 x 109/l, respectively). In cycles 2, 3 and 4, the 
mean ANC nadir was not as deep as in cycle 1 and was similar across treatment groups with a mean 
value of approximately 1.0 x 109/l. In cycle 4, mean ANC nadir was 1.0, 1.0, and 1.1 x 109/l in the 
XM02, Neupogen and placebo/XM02 groups, respectively. 
Time to ANC recovery 
In cycle 1, the mean time to ANC recovery was shorter in the XM02 and Neupogen groups (8.0 and 
7.8 days) compared to the placebo group (14.0 days). In cycles 2, 3 and 4, mean time to ANC recovery 
were similar in all treatment groups with a median of 8.0 days. In cycle 4, mean time to ANC recovery 
was 7.6, 7.1, and 7.2 days in the XM02, Neupogen and placebo/XM02 groups, respectively. 
Incidence of FN 
The overall incidence of observed or protocol defined FN across all cycles was lower in the XM02 and 
Neupogen groups (20.7 and 22.1%, respectively) compared to the placebo/XM02 group (41.7%). 
Table 21 gives the detailed results for cycle 1.

In  cycles  2, 3,  and  4, the incidence  of  observed  or protocol  defined  FN  was  similar  in  all  treatment 
groups. Between the 3 treatment groups, the incidence ranged from 6.9 to 8.0% in cycle 2, from 1.4 to 
9.9% in cycle 3, and from 5.9 to 8.5% in cycle 4. 
Mortality 
There were 3 deaths during cycle 1 (2 in the placebo group, 1 in the XM02 group) and 1 death after 
the end of study visit (XM02 group). None of the  deaths were  considered to be related to the study 
drug.  There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  patients  treated  with  XM02  or 
Neupogen with respect to the mortality rate. 
Ancillary analyses 
No ancillary analyses were performed. 
•  Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies have been conducted in special populations (the elderly, children or patients with impaired 
renal or hepatic function). 
All subjects in the Phase I studies and 86-95% of patients in the Phase III studies were Caucasian. 
•  Supportive study(ies) 
There were 2 supportive studies: Study XM02-03-INT and Study XM02-04-INT. 
Study XM02-03-INT 
This was a phase II, multinational, multicentre, randomised, controlled study to enrol 240 lung cancer 
(either small cell or non-small cell lung cancer) patients. Patients were randomly allocated to treatment 
with  XM02  or  Neupogen  in  a  2:1  ratio  in  the  first  CTX  cycle.  In  the  subsequent  cycles  all  patients 
40/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
received  XM02.  Patients  were  stratified  by  country,  previous  CTX  and  lung  cancer  type.  The 
reference product was the same as in study XM02-02-INT, i.e. Neupogen, German trade ware. 
The main inclusion criteria were adult female and male patients of any ethnic origin with a diagnosis 
of lung cancer meeting following criteria: 
•  SCLC, histologically or cytologically documented or patients with advanced NSCLC disease; 
•  planned/eligible 
in 
to  receive  a  platinum-based,  myelosuppressive  CTX  requiring, 
the 
investigator’s opinion, G-CSF support; 
life-expectancy of at least 6 months; 
• 
•  CTX-naïve  or  had  received  no  more  than  1  previous  regimen  of  CTX  completed  more  than 
4 weeks before randomisation; 
•  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2; 
•  ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/l; 
• 
adequate hepatic, cardiac and renal functions for the chosen CTX regimen. 
The main non-inclusion criteria were: 
•  previous exposure to filgrastim, pegfilgrastim or lenograstim; 
• 
• 
• 
treatment with systemically active antibiotics within 72 hours before CTX; 
treatment with lithium; 
candidate  for  combined  CTX/radiotherapy  or  prior  radiation  therapy  within  4  weeks  before 
randomisation; 
chronic  use  of  oral  corticosteroids  (except  low  dose  chronic  treatment  with  ≤ 20  mg/day 
prednisolone or equivalent dose for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease); 
• 
•  prior bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. 
The patients had to undergo a maximum of 6 CTX cycles of 3 or 4 weeks per cycle, depending on the 
CTX protocol), each cycle beginning with a CTX infusion on day 1. Starting 1 day after the last CTX 
infusion day, the patients received daily s.c. injections of 5 μg/kg/day (based on actual body weight) 
XM02 or Neupogen (first cycle only) for at least 5 days and a maximum of 14 days. Study drug was 
stopped earlier, when an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 10 x 109/l after nadir was reached. 
The  primary  study  objective  was  to  demonstrate  of  safety  of  XM02  when  administered  for  up  to  a 
maximum of six cycles of CTX in patients with lung cancer. 
The secondary study objectives were to: 
•  demonstrate  the  efficacy  of  XM02  during  cycle  1  compared  to  Neupogen  in  patients  with  lung 
• 
cancer; 
evaluate  the  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  XM02  in  comparison  to  Neupogen  in  a  subset  of 
patients.

Study XM02-04-INT 
This  was  a  multinational,  multicentre,  randomised,  controlled  phase  III  study in  CTX-naïve  patients 
with  aggressive  NHL  (allowed  subtypes:  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma,  mediastinal  large  B-cell 
lymphoma, follicular lymphoma grade 3, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma) undergoing CTX. 
Patients were randomised to treatment with either XM02 or Neupogen in a 2:1 ratio in the first CTX 
cycle.  In  the  subsequent  cycles,  all  patients  received  XM02.  Patients  were  stratified  by  country  and 
concomitant treatment with rituximab. The reference product was the same as in study XM02-02-INT, 
i.e. Neupogen, German trade ware. 
The main inclusion criteria were adult female and male patients of any ethnic origin with a diagnosis 
of  aggressive  NHL  defined  as  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma,  mediastinal  large  B-cell  lymphoma, 
follicular  lymphoma  grade  3,  or  anaplastic  large  cell  lymphoma  meeting  the  additional  following 
criteria: 
•  CTX-naïve; 
•  planned/eligible  to  receive  a  CHOP  regimen  as  routine  CTX  for  their  NHL  requiring  G-CSF 
support in the investigator’s opinion; 
• 
life-expectancy of at least 6 months as judged by the investigator; 
• 
International Prognostic Index (IPI) score ≤ 3; 
•  ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/l and platelets ≥ 100 x 109/l; 
• 
adequate hepatic, cardiac and renal function. 
The main non-inclusion criteria were: 
• 
lymphoblastic  lymphoma,  Burkitt's  lymphoma,  transformed  lymphoma,  central  nervous  system 
lymphoma; 
•  previous exposure to filgrastim, pegfilgrastim or lenograstim; 
•  underlying neuropathy of Grade 2 or higher; 
• 
• 
• 
•  prior bone marrow or stem cell transplantation; 
•  HIV infection, positivity for hepatitis B surface antigen and/or hepatitis C virus. 
treatment with systemically active antibiotics within 72 hours before CTX; 
treatment with lithium; 
chronic use of oral corticosteroids; 
The study drug was administered daily starting 1 day after CTX as an s.c. 5 μg/kg injection for at least 
5 days and for a maximum of 14 days in each cycle. The s.c. administration site was chosen by the 
drug administrator reflecting daily clinical practice. The CTX regimen in this study was according to 
the  CHOP  protocol:  cyclophosphamide  i.v.  750  mg/m2,  doxorubicin  i.v.  50 mg/m2,  vincristine  i.v. 
1.4 mg/m2
 (maximum 2 mg) on day 1 of each cycle and prednisolone 100 mg/day orally from day 1 to 
day 5. Patients on CHOP could receive rituximab (stratification criterion). Up to 6 CTX cycles were 
given. 
The  primary  study  objective  was  to  demonstrate  the  safety  of  XM02  when  administered  for  up  to  a 
maximum  of  6 cycles  in  patients  with  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (NHL)  receiving  CTX  (CHOP 
regimen). 
The secondary study objectives were to: 
•  demonstrate the efficacy of XM02 during cycle 1 compared to Neupogen in patients with NHL; 
• 
evaluate pharmacokinetic properties of XM02 in comparison to Neupogen a subset of patients.

In  Study  XM02-03-INT,  more  patients  discontinued  the  study  prematurely  compared  to  the  other 
studies. This was probably due to the poor health status of the patients in the lung cancer study since 
the  most  frequent  reason  for  discontinuation  was  underlying  disease  progression  and  death.  No 
patients discontinued the study prematurely due to lack of efficacy.

Duration of severe neutropenia 
During  cycles  1  and  4,  the  mean  DSN  was  slightly  longer  in  the  pivotal  study  XM02-02-INT 
compared to the 2 supportive studies XM02-03-INT and XM02-04-INT. The longer DSN observed in 
the  pivotal  study  can  be  explained  by  the  CTX  regimen  used  in  this  study  (docetaxel/doxorubicin), 
which is considered to have a higher myelotoxic potency in comparison with the CTX regimens used 
in the other 2 studies. There were no statistically significant differences between XM02 and Neupogen 
with regard to the mean DSN in any study. 
Absolute neutrophil count over time 
In  all  three  studies,  in  the  XM02  and  Neupogen  groups,  mean  ANC  values  had  a  similar  profile, 
increasing after day 1, reaching a first maximum on days 3 to 5 and then decreasing to a nadir on day 7 
to day 12. Thereafter, mean values increased again, reaching a second maximum on days 11 to 14. On 
day 21, mean values returned to those observed on day 1. 
Depth of absolute neutrophil count nadir 
In  both  cycles  1  and  4,  the  mean  ANC  nadir  was  deeper  in  the  pivotal  study  compared  to  the 
2 supportive studies. There were no statistically significant differences between XM02 and Neupogen 
with regard to the mean ANC nadir in the studies, except for the difference of 2.1 versus 2.9 x 109/l in 
cycle 1 of Study XM02-03-INT. This is not considered clinically significant due to the high absolute 
ANC values in both groups. 
Time to absolute neutrophil count recovery 
In both cycles 1 and 4, the mean time to ANC recovery was longer in the pivotal study compared to 
the  2  supportive  studies.  There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  XM02  and 
Neupogen with regard to time to ANC recovery in the studies, except for the difference of 6.3 versus 
4.5 days in cycle 1 of Study XM02-03-INT.

Incidence of febrile neutropenia 
The incidence of observed or protocol defined FN across all cycles ranged from 20.7 to 41.7% across 
the treatment groups of the studies. There were no statistically significant differences between XM02 
and  Neupogen  with  regard  to  incidence  of  FN  in  any  study.  The  estimated  common  risk  difference 
(XM02 minus Neupogen) of observed or protocol-defined FN, adjusted by study, was 1.7% [-3.8, 7.1] 
across studies, a difference, which was not statistically significant. 
Mortality 
Mortality  rates  were  distinctly  higher  in  Study  XM02-03-INT  (lung  cancer)  compared  to  the  other 
studies (possibly reflecting the clinical course of patients with advanced NSCLC and an overall poor 
prognosis)  but  the  mortality  observed  in  this  study  was  within  the  expected  range.  There  were  no 
statistically significant differences counted between XM02 and Neupogen with regard to mortality in 
any study. 
Clinical safety 
lung  cancer 
[Study  XM02-03-INT]  or  non-Hodgkin’s 
Safety evaluations of XM02 have included analyses of five clinical studies: two phase I studies with 
healthy  volunteers  and  three  studies  in  cancer  patients  (i.e.  in  patients  with  breast  cancer 
[Study XM02-02-INT], 
lymphoma 
[Study XM02-04-INT]).  Studies  XM02-03-INT  and  XM02-04-INT  were  designed  primarily  to 
investigate the safety of XM02. In the pivotal efficacy breast cancer study, patients were treated with 
the  reference  product  Neupogen  for  up  to  4  cycles  of  chemotherapy.  In  the  primary  safety  studies 
(Studies XM02-03-INT  and  XM02-04-INT)  patients  initially  randomised  to  the  Neupogen  group  for 
cycle 1 (to allow for a comparative determination of efficacy) received XM02 in all subsequent CTX 
cycles to ensure maximal patient exposure to XM02 for the determination of safety. Therefore, there 
was no Neupogen (reference) group over the enitre duration of these studies. 
A pooled analysis of safety was performed for the 3 cancer patient studies and separately for the two 
phase I studies. Due to the study design, the most relevant comparison concerns the first cycle of CTX. 
Safety  assessments  included  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs),  laboratory  tests,  physical 
examinations,  vital  signs  assessments,  injection  site  reactions  and  immunogenicity.  All  safety 
variables  were  analysed  using  descriptive  statistics.  In  addition,  the  incidence  of  TEAEs  was 
compared  between  treatment  groups  using  Fisher's  exact  test  (2-sided  p-values)  and  changes  in 
laboratory  parameters  from  baseline  were  compared  between  treatment  groups  using  the  Wilcoxon 
test. 
•  Patient exposure 
In  the  3  cancer  patient  studies  all  patients  received  XM02  or  Neupogen  at  a  dose  of  5 μg/kg/day. 
Overall, the median duration of exposure to the study drug for a patient was 40 days (1 to 84 days). In 
each cycle, patients were exposed to the study drug for approximately 9 to 11 days. Table 27 provides 
details on patient exposure.

Within  each  cycle,  mean  doses  were  approximately  3200  to  3600 μg.  Differences  between  the 
treatment groups in exposure were due to differences in number of cycles, and duration of treatment 
within cycles.

Studies XM02-02-INT and XM02-04-INT included a homogeneous patient population with regard to 
the  severity  of  malignant  disease  and  CTX,  whereas  XM02-03-INT  was  performed  with  a 
heterogeneous patient population – including CTX pre-treated patients. 
The completion rate was distinctly lower in Study XM02-03-INT (52.5%) compared to the other two 
studies (95.7 and 82.6%), due to the poor health status and high rate drop-out rate of patients in the 
lung cancer study. 
In the cancer patient studies, median time from the first diagnosis of cancer disease to the study start 
was 22 days (range 0 to 9879 days). A prior radiation therapy was performed in 61 (9.0%) patients. 
Median  time  between  radiation  therapy  and  study  start  in  these  patients  was  194  days  (range  26  to 
10809 days). No patient had a prior bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. The treatment groups 
46/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were different with regard to cancer history due to different inclusion criteria in the studies, e.g. in the 
breast cancer study, a homogeneous patient population with stage II to IV disease without prior CTX 
was included, and in the lung cancer study, one previous CTX-regimen was allowed. 
•  Adverse events 
In the pooled analysis of the 3 studies in cancer patients, 543 (80.2%) of the patients experienced at 
least  one  TEAE  in  the  Cycle  1.  TEAEs  were  considered  study  drug-related  in  16.7%  (113  patients) 
and CTX-related in 70.5% (477 patients). 
An overview of adverse events in the cancer patient set (Cycle 1) is presented in Table 29.

In the pooled analysis across all cycles, 93.5% (633 patients) experienced at least one TEAE, of which 
27.3% (185 patients) were considered to be study drug-related and 86.1% (583 patients) CTX-related. 
The  3  studies  in  cancer  patients  were  similar  with  regard  to  the  most  common  TEAEs  (Table 30), 
which  were  nausea  (27.3%  of  patients  in  cycle  1  and  46.2%  across  all  cycles),  alopecia  (25.0%  in 
cycle  1  and  33.8%  across  all  cycles),  neutropenia  (16.1%  in  cycle  1  and  22.6%  across  all  cycles), 
diarrhoea (13.0% in cycle 1 and 20.4% across all cycles), asthenia (12.9% in cycle 1 and 28.7% across

p < 0.001 Fisher’s exact test comparing first 3 groups 
The incidence of several TEAEs (in cycle 1: alopecia, neutropenia, diarrhoea, asthenia, bone pain and 
abdominal pain) were statistically significantly higher in the Neupogen-only group than in the XM02-
only group. However, these differences are unlikely to be of clinical relevance. 
The incidence of febrile neutropenia was much higher in the placebo/XM02 group, as expected due to 
an  higher  incidence  during  cycle 1.  In  the  placebo/XM02  group,  the  incidence  of  stomatitis, 
pharyngitis, and pharyngolaryngeal pain was also higher compared to the other groups. 
The most commonly reported drug-related TEAEs across all studies in cancer patients during cycle 1 
(Table  31)  were  bone  pain  (3.4%),  diarrhoea  (2.2%),  asthenia  (2.2%),  myalgia  (1.9%),  arthralgia 
(1.5%),  headache  (1.2%)  and  pyrexia  (1.0%).  These  are  expected  adverse  events  from  the  known 
pharmacological profile of G-CSF. A similar profile was seen for all cycles. The overall incidence of 
possibly drug-related TEAEs across all cycles was higher in the breast cancer study.

p < 0.001 Fisher’s exact test comparing first 3 groups 
When  analysed  by  system  organ  class  (SOC),  the  data  were  consistent  with  the  above-mentioned 
analyses  of  TEAEs  by  preferred  term.  The  most  commonly  reported  SOCs  in  cycle 1  were 
gastrointestinal  disorders,  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders,  and  blood  and  lymphatic  system 
disorders.  Looking  at  drug-related  events,  the  most  commonly  reported  SOCs  in  cycle 1  were 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, general disorders, administration site conditions, and 
gastrointestinal disorders. 
Bone  pain:  Within  individual  studies,  the  treatment  groups  were  similar  with  regard  to  incidence  of 
bone pain when all the cycles were counted (20% of patients in XM02 group vs. 28% of patients in 
Neupogen group). In cycle 1, the overall incidence of bone pain was 13.7%, with a higher incidence in 
the Neupogen-only group (20.9%) compared to the XM02-only and Neupogen/XM02 groups (12.6% 
and 11.3%, respectively; p = 0.049). The overall incidence of study drug-related bone pain was 6.9%, 
with  a  higher  incidence  in  the  Neupogen-only  group  (14.2%)  compared  to  the  XM02-only  and 
Neupogen/XM02  groups  (6.2%  and  4.3%,  respectively;  p = 0.007).  There  was  a  lower  incidence  of 
bone pain in the placebo/XM02 group. 
(including 
angioneurotic  oedema,  dermatitis 
Allergic  reactions:  In  the  pooled  analysis  of  XM02  studies  in  cancer  patients,  “potential  allergic 
reactions” 
allergic,  drug  hypersensitivity, 
hypersensitivity,  rash,  pruritic  rash  and  urticaria)  occurred  in  12  (1.8%)  of  the  patients  in  cycle  1 
(1.4% in the XM02-only and 2.2% in the Neupogen-only groups, respectively) and in 25 (3.7%) of the 
patients  across  all  cycles  (4.5%  in  the  XM02-only  and  3.7%  in  the  Neupogen-only  groups, 
respectively).  Of  the  reactions  across  all  cycles,  8  (1.2%)  of  the  patients  had  reactions  that  were 
considered drug-related. Only 1 allergic reaction was serious, i.e. bronchospasm in cycle 1 requiring 
temporary interruption of the study drug (XM02 group in Study XM02-02-INT). 
Anaemia: In cycle 1, the overall incidence of anaemia was 5.0% and comparable across the treatment 
groups (5.2, 4.7 and 4.2% in the XM02, Neupogen and placebo groups, respectively). Most of these 
anaemia TEAEs were considered to be CTX-related (4.1, 3.9 and 4.2% in the XM02, Neupogen and 
placebo groups, respectively). One patient (0.4%) experienced a study drug-related anaemia TEAE, in 
the Neupogen group. There were no severe or serious anaemia TEAEs, and no patients stopped study 
drug due to a TEAE. 
Across all cycles, the overall incidence of anaemia was 20.4% with a lower incidence in the Neupogen 
only  group  (6.7%)  compared  to  the  XM02  only  and  Neupogen/XM02  groups  (22.8  and  33.9%, 
49/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
respectively;  p < 0.001).  Most  of  the  anaemia  was  CTX-related  (6.0,  21.3  and  31.3%  in  the  XM02, 
Neupogen and placebo groups, respectively). The higher incidence of anaemia in the XM02 group was 
driven by TEAEs reported in the lung cancer study (Study XM02-03-INT), which had no reference 
group. There were 7 patients whose anaemia was considered to be drug-related (1 each in the breast 
cancer and NHL studies and 5 in the lung cancer study). 
Injection  site  reactions:  The  injection  site  was  assessed  for  signs  of  redness,  swelling,  bruising  and 
tenderness.  The  incidence  of  injection  site  reactions  was  low  in  all  cancer  patient  studies  (1.5%  of 
patients overall across all cycles). There were no differences between the treatment groups or within 
individual studies. 
Immunogenicity: The development of antibodies against XM02 and Neupogen was investigated in the 
3 cancer  patient  studies.  Immunogenicity  was  assessed  by  a  predefined  characterisation  cascade  of 
antibody assays using XM02 as test antigen: 
1.  Screening with Anti-XM02 (IgG) ELISA and Anti-XM02 (IgG-IgM) Luminex assay. 
If positive or questionable: 
2.  IgG- and IgM-specific Western Blot Confirmation Assays. 
Western-Blot positive or questionable - three assays in parallel: 
3.  Quantitative Anti-XM02 (IgG) Luminex assay using polyclonal calibrator sera and relative 
assay units (RU-MFI IgG); 
4.  Neutralising antibodies (NAB) using a G-CSF-depended NFS-60 cell-based assay; 
5.  Binding antibodies using a BIAcore total antibody assay.

The  incidence  of  binding  and  neutralising  antibodies  was  low.  As  expected  for  G-CSF  and  as 
described  in  the  EMEA  guidance  CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005[12],  there  were  no  immunogenicity 
findings of clinical relevance which had “major consequences for efficacy and safety”. 
•  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In  cycle  1,  74  (10.9%)  patients  reported  a  serious  adverse  event  (SAE)  with  more  patients  in  the 
placebo/XM02 group (22.2%) than in the other groups. Across all cycles, 135 (19.9%) of the patients 
reported an SAE. There was an overall higher incidence of SAEs in the lung cancer study (30%) than 
in the breast cancer study (14%) and the NHL study (15%). 
Five patients had SAEs that were considered to be drug-related across all 3 studies. These were: 
an allergic reaction (bronchospasm) in cycle 1 (XM02 group) in the breast cancer study; 
syncope in cycle 3 (placebo/XM02 group) in the breast cancer study; 
• 
• 
•  myocardial infarction in cycle 2 (Neupogen/XM02 group) in the lung cancer study; 
• 
thrombocytopenia in cycle 5 (Neupogen/XM02 group) in the lung cancer study; 
• 
thrombocytopenia  in  cycle  1  and  hyperuricaemia  in  Cycle  2  (XM02  group)  in  the  lung  cancer 
study. 
With exception of syncope, these events were also considered to be CTX-related. 
Deaths 
In the 3 studies in cancer patients, 26 (3.8%) of the patients died, 11 (1.6%) of whom during cycle 1. 
No  differences  in  the  incidence  of  death  were  observed  between  the  treatment  groups.  Of  the  26 
deaths, 22 occurred in the study involving patients with lung cancer and 4 in the study conducted in 
patients with breast cancer. About 25% of these TEAEs were CTX-related. None were judged to be 
related to the study drug. 
•  Laboratory findings 
The laboratory safety parameters alkaline phosphatase (AP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid, 
leukocytes,  haemoglobin  and  platelets  were  of  special  interest.  There  were  no  clinically  relevant 
differences between the treatment groups. 
•  Safety in special populations 
No differences in safety profile with regard to age, gender, race or body weight were observed. Only a 
few  patients  with  renal  (n = 1)  and  hepatic  impairment  (n = 13)  were  included  in  the  studies.  Thus, 
assessment of influence of these co-morbidities on G-CSF use is limited. 
•  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No studies on drug interactions were performed. 
Recommendations from the Neupogen SPC: 1) Neupogen should not be administered from 24 hours 
before  up  to  24  hours  after  chemotherapy  as  neutropenia  may  be  increased  with  concomitant 
treatment,  2)  potential  interactions  with  other  haematopoietic  growth  factors  and  cytokines  have  not 
been investigated as part of clinical studies and 3) lithium may potentiate the effects of Neupogen. 
•  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall in cycle 1, 15 (2.2%) of the patients discontinued the study drug due to a TEAE (11 cases in 
the XM02 group and 4 in the Neupogen group). Across all cycles, 40 (5.9%) of the patients withdrew 
from  the  study  drug  due  to  a  TEAE  (27,  5,  6  and  2  in  XM02,  Neupogen,  Neupogen/XM02  and 
placebo/XM02  groups,  respectively).  The  majority  of  TEAEs  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation 
were classified as CTX-related. Overall, 6 (0.9%) of the patients had a study drug-related TEAE that 
led to study drug discontinuation. There was a higher incidence  of withdrawal due to TEAEs in the 
lung cancer study than in the other studies.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no 
additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 
Further considerations following positive opinion in February 2008 
Following the positive opinion in February 2008 for Ratiograstim, the European Commission referred 
the  opinion  back  to  the  CHMP  on  29  April  2008.  This  was  due  to  concerns  over  available  safety 
information for the filgrastim-containing medicinal product Grasalva authorised in Lithuania in 2003 
(by  Sicor  Biotech  UAB,  part  of  the  Teva  group)  and  a  relevance  for  Ratiograstim.  The  CHMP  was 
requested to consider whether any data provided for the authorisation of Grasalva, or collected post-
authorisation,  are  relevant  for  the  assessment  of  the  marketing  authorisation  application  for 
Ratiograstim. 
Upon request from the EMEA/CHMP, the Applicant provided the full Grasalva dossier, including data 
on quality, safety and efficacy. The Applicant confirmed that the active substances for Grasalva and 
Ratiograstim  are  the  same  and  manufactured  using  to  the  same  process.  However,  there  are  some 
differences on the level of the drug product, which, according to the Applicant, provide evidence that 
the  two  products  are  not  the  same.  Nevertheless,  the  differences  between  the  drug  products  were 
considered by the CHMP to be  minor and therefore the assessment of the Grasalva data focused on 
clinical aspects in order to address the request from the European Commission. 
54/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The clinical data provided for Grasalva included one phase I study in healthy male volunteers (GCSF-
BQL-02)  and  one  pivotal  study  (GCSF-IV-03)  in  patients  with  metastatic  breast  cancer.  The 
evaluation  of  safety  included  analyses  of  adverse  events,  serious  adverse  events  and  deaths, 
discontinuation  due 
in  special  populations, 
immunogenicity, post-marketing experience, identified and potential risks, and missing information. 
laboratory  findings,  safety 
to  adverse  events, 
Among the limited data included in the Grasalva dossier, a single death and a number of other serious 
adverse  events  were  reported.  As  details  in  the  Grasalva  dossier  were  limited  in  some  areas,  a 
thorough assessment of these adverse events was difficult. However, a satisfactory review of the safety 
data for Grasalva has been provided by the Applicant. The CHMP concluded that the events reported 
were not unexpected in the patient population (oncology) being studied. 
The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  data  provided  in  the  Grasalva  dossier  do  not  affect  the  opinion  for 
Ratiograstim. As a result, the benefit-risk profile for Ratiograstim and the Risk Management Plan at 
the time of opinion remain unchanged following consideration of the data submitted on Grasalva. 
In a letter dated 18 June 2008, the European Commission requested that the CHMP consider the need 
for  GCP  inspections  of  the  clinical  studies  carried  out  for  Ratiograstim.  The  Applicant  provided 
further clarifications in writing 22 July 2008 as to why a GCP inspection of the Ratiograstim clinical 
trial sites would not be needed. In particular, the Applicant provided reassurance regarding the quality 
control of the clinical trials conducted for Ratiograstim, which were performed in adherence with GCP 
standards. In addition, the Applicant presented its position to the CHMP at an oral explanation on 23 
July 2008.  
The CHMP considered that the documentation presented for Ratiograstim does not indicate a need for 
a  GCP  inspection.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  the Applicant  had  demonstrated  satisfactorily  that  the 
clinical development for Ratiograstim was clearly separate from the clinical development of Grasalva 
and  conducted  by  two  separate  companies,  i.e.  Biogenerix  for  Ratiograstim  and  Sicor  Biotech  for 
Grasalva.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  information  provided  for  Grasalva  did  not  raise  any  concerns 
regarding the GCP compliance of clinical trials conducted for the Ratiograstim application.  
In  conclusion,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  data  generated  for  the  medicinal  product  Grasalva  did  not 
affect  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  Ratiograstim.  In  addition,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the 
documentation  submitted  for  the  Ratiograstim  application  does  not  indicate  a  need  for  a  GCP 
inspection.  
3  OVERALL CONCLUSIONS, RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT AND 
RECOMMENDATION 
Quality 
The dossier was found to be of good quality, fulfilling the requirements for marketing authorisation of 
a  similar  biological  medicinal  product.  Extensive  comparability  studies  were  performed  using 
Neupogen,  sourced  from  Germany,  as  the  reference  medicinal  product.  The  characterisation  of  the 
active substance and the comparability studies are considered acceptable. 
During  the  evaluation,  two  major  objections  were  raised.  The  first  concerned  the  lack  of  real-time 
stability  results  to  support  the  proposed  shelf  life  of  the  active  substance  and  medicinal  product. 
Appropriate data were however provided by the applicant in their responses and the major objection 
was  considered  resolved.  The  second  major  objection  related  to  the  sourcing  of  the  reference 
medicinal  product  as  it  was  unclear  whether  an  EU-authorised  medicinal  product  was  used  as 
reference throughout the comparability exercise. It was clarified as part of the responses to the List of 
Questions that comparability had been fully demonstrated using an EU-authorised medicinal product 
as the reference (i.e. Neupogen sourced from Amgen, Germany). Thus, the major objection regarding 
the  origin  of  the  medicinal  product  used  for  impurity  profiling  by  RP-HPLC  and  IE-HPLC  was 
adequately addressed. 
55/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other concerns have also been adequately addressed. However, four commitments have been made by 
the applicant to provide further information post-approval. 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Non-clinical  studies  have  not  demonstrated  any  differences  between  XM02  and  Neupogen  with 
respect to the primary or secondary pharmacodynamic activities. 
Non-clinical  data  revealed  no  special  hazards  for  humans  based  on  conventional  studies  of  safety 
pharmacology, genotoxicity or local tolerance.

No  effects  on  the  fertility  of  male  and  female  rats  or  gestation  in  rats  were  observed.  There  is  no 
evidence from studies in rats and rabbits that XM02 is teratogenic. An increased incidence of embryo 
loss was observed in rabbits but no malformations have been seen. 
Efficacy and safety 
Randomised,  single-blind,  single  dose,  crossover  studies  in  196  healthy  volunteers  showed  that  the 
pharmacokinetic  profile  of  XM02  was  comparable  to  that  of  the  reference  product,  Neupogen 
(filgrastim), after subcutaneous and intravenous administration. 
Clearance  of  XM02  has  been  shown  to  follow  first-order  pharmacokinetics  after  both  subcutaneous 
and intravenous administration. The serum elimination half life of XM02 is approximately 3.5 hours, 
with  a  clearance  rate  of  approximately  0.6 ml/min/kg.  Continuous  infusion  with  filgrastim  over  a 
period of up to 28 days in patients recovering from autologous bone-marrow transplantation resulted 
in no evidence of drug accumulation and comparable elimination half-lives. There is a positive linear 
correlation  between  the  dose  and  the  serum  concentration  of  XM02,  whether  administered 
intravenously  or  subcutaneously.  Following  subcutaneous  administration  of  recommended  doses, 
serum concentrations were maintained above 10 ng/ml for 8 to 16 hours. The volume of distribution in 
blood is approximately 150 ml/kg. 
In cancer patients, the pharmacokinetic profiles of XM02 and the reference product were comparable 
after single and repeated subcutaneous administration. 
The  efficacy  and  safety  of  XM02  have  been  assessed  in  randomised,  controlled  phase  III  studies  in 
breast cancer, lung cancer and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. There were no relevant differences between 
XM02  and  the  reference  product  with  regard  to  duration  of  severe  neutropenia  or  the  incidence  of 
febrile neutropenia. 
From  the  safety  database,  all  the  adverse  reactions  reported  in  clinical  trials  have  been  taken  into 
account in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
User consultation 
The  Patient  Information  Leaflet  (PIL)  for  Ratiograstim  (filgrastim)  has  been  tested  in  English  in 
accordance  with  Articles  59(3)  and  61(1)  of  Directive 2001/83/EC,  as  amended  by 
Directive 2004/27/EC.  The  PIL  for  Ratiograstim  (filgrastim)  was  found  to  contain  all  the  necessary 
information in a form that is accessible and understandable to those who participated in this test. 
It is considered that the tested PIL meets the requirements set for User Testing.

Risk-benefit assessment 
Since  Ratiograstim  as  biosimilar  product  has  shown  a  comparable  quality,  safety  and  efficacy 
compared  with  the  reference  product,  it  is  expected  that  Ratiograstim  provides  the  same  benefits  as 
Neupogen in the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in 
patients  treated  with  established  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  for  malignancy  and  in  patients  undergoing 
myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation both in adults and children, as well as 
in  mobilisation  of  peripheral  blood  progenitor  cells.  Finally,  the  long-term  benefits  in  children  or 
adults  with  severe  congenital,  cyclic  or  idiopathic  neutropenia  and  in  neutropenic  HIV-positive 
individuals are expected to be the same as with Neupogen. 
The only area of uncertainty is the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells because it is not 
known whether the efficacy in oncology can be fully extrapolated to this area of use. The uncertainty 
is  due  to  the  lack  of  complete  understanding  of  the  mechanism  of  peripheral  blood  progenitor  cell 
mobilisation from the bone marrow. This issue has now been satisfactorily addressed by the RMP. 
The development programme has not revealed unexpected safety issues. The adverse event profiles of 
the  test  and  the  reference  products  appeared  to  be  comparable  and  this  has  been  fully  taken  into 
account in the SPC and RMP. 
In principle, the potential additional risks of a biosimilar product must be related to differences in the 
quality  of  the  test  and  the  reference  products.  The  observed  major  deficiencies  in  the  quality 
documentation pertained to insufficient demonstration of the stability of the active substance and the 
medicinal product. The applicant was asked for more information according to these questions and the 
responses were adequate. 
Immune-related  problems  have  been  rare  for  the  reference  product  Neupogen.  Immune-mediated 
neutropenia has been demonstrated in animal experiments. The immunological studies conducted did 
not  provide  any  signals  for  enhanced  immunogenicity.  Unfortunately,  the  documentation  of  the 
immunoassays and assay strategy was incomplete during the first assessment. The Applicant provided 
further information which supported the application and the final decision is now positive. 
Screening  for  rare  immunological  adverse  effects  in  the  post-marketing  setting  is  difficult.  In 
principle,  it  must  be  driven  by  reported  adverse  events  that  have  a  potential  immunological  origin. 
These events should be investigated for immunogenicity as agreed in the Risk Management Plan. 
The present Marketing Authorisation Application is based on appropriate studies and the test product 
is comparable to the reference product. The observed major deficiencies have been resolved and the 
granting of a marketing authorisation is recommended. In conclusion, the overall B/R is positive. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion  that  routine  pharmacovigilance  was  adequate  to  monitor  the  safety  of  the  product.  No 
additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information. 
Following  a  positive  opinion  in  February  2008  the  CHMP,  upon  request  from  the  European 
Commission, assessed data generated for the medicinal product Grasalva and concluded that these data 
did  not  affect  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  Ratiograstim.  In  addition,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the 
scientific  data  collected  in  the  clinical  trials  conducted  for  the  Ratiograstim  application  does  not 
indicate a need for a GCP inspection.  
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Ratiograstim in the indication: 
Ratiograstim is indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of 
febrile neutropenia in patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy 
57/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the 
reduction  in  the  duration  of  neutropenia  in  patients  undergoing  myeloablative  therapy 
followed  by  bone  marrow  transplantation  considered  to  be  at  increased  risk  of  prolonged 
severe  neutropenia.  The  safety  and  efficacy  of  filgrastim  are  similar  in  adults  and  children 
receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
Ratiograstim is indicated for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). 
In patients, children or adults, with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 0.5 x 109/l, and a history of severe or recurrent infections, 
long  term  administration  of  Ratiograstim  is  indicated  to  increase  neutrophil  counts  and  to 
reduce the incidence and duration of infection-related events. 
Ratiograstim is indicated for the treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC less than or equal 
to 1.0 x 109/l) in patients with advanced HIV infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial 
infections when other options to manage neutropenia are inappropriate. 
was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

Scientific conclusions  
The MAH has performed a pooled analysis of relevant data including data from the aclidinium bromide 
monotherapy program and the aclidinium bromide 400 µg BID and placebo data coming from the 
combination program of acldinium bromide with formoterol fumarate. It includes clinical trials with 
aclidinium bromide 400 µg BID of more than 1 month duration.  
A total of 2,167 patients were exposed to Aclidinium Bromide 400 µg BID, doubling the size of the 
previous pooling in terms of number of patients and exposure time (2,167 vs. 1,005 patients and 1,258 
vs. 526.2 years for the new pooling and previous pooling, respectively). 
According to this pooled data analysis, the incidence of patients with drug hypersensitivity events in 
the aclidinium bromide 400 µg BID was equal to placebo, being lower when adjusting by the exposure 
time 3.2 vs. 4.2 per 1000 patient-years, respectively. Two out the four events in aclidinium bromide 
treated patients were hypersensitivity reactions to concomitant drugs (fluoxetine and meloxicam).  
With respect to patients reporting rash events, the raw incidence was similar between aclidinium 
bromide and placebo, and it became lower when adjusting by the exposure time 18.3 vs.  25.2 per 
1,000 patient-years, respectively.   
The incidence of patients with pruritus events were slightly higher in aclidinium bromide compared to 
placebo, being similar when taking into account the exposure time 12.7 vs.  12.6 per 1,000 
patient-years, respectively.   
No cases of angioedema were reported in the clinical trials. 
According to the SmPC guideline, frequency of ADRs detected in post-marketing should consider crude 
incidence rates of reactions seen in clinical development. In addition, adverse events without at least 
a suspected causal relationship should not be included in section 4.8.   
There were no significant differences in the incidence of AEs (independently of the causality 
assessment given by the investigator) of hypersensitivity, rash and pruritus in clinical trials. These 
events have been detected as a signal in post-marketing. Frequencies based on reporting rates from a 
spontaneous reporting system should not be used to assign frequency category and adverse events 
without at least a suspected causal relationship should not be included in SmPC section 4.8. Therefore, 
the following adverse events and frequencies were included in section 4.8 ‘Undesirable effect’ of the 
SmPC:

Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Bretaris Genuair, the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance aclidinium bromide is 
favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

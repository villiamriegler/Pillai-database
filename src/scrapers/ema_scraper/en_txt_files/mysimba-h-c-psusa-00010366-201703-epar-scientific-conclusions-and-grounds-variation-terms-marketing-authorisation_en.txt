During this review swellings in the facial area have been determined as expressions of an angioedema 
and as a consequence “angioedema” should be included in the SmPC as ADR of the combination 
naltrexone / bupropion and not only of the mono-component bupropion. There are a total of 10 cases of 
symptoms resembling angioedema with a reasonable assumption of a causal relationship to treatment. 
Therefore, the product information should be changed in a way, that angioedema is associated with the 
combination and not only with the mono-products.

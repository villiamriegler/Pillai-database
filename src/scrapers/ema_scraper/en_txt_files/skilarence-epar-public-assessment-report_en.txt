2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease, predominantly involving the skin, where it is characterised 
by the presence of erythematous plaques, usually covered by white silvery scales (Griffiths, 2007; 
Nestle, 2009), but joints may also be affected (psoriatic arthritis). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Psoriasis is more frequent in countries further away from the equator and has an estimated worldwide 
prevalence of 1% to 2% (Cohen, 2012; Chong, 2013). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
An altered balance between the T helper Type (Th) cells, Th1 and Th2, may play a critical role in the 
psoriatic lesions (Szegedi, 2003; Jacob, 2003), leading to a predominance of Th1-cell cytokines over 
the Th2-cell cytokines (Del Prete, 1998). The key element that seems to be initially responsible for the 
imbalance between inflammatory cells and the cytokine profile is a dysregulation of the NF-κB, which 
has been shown to be activated in lesional psoriatic skin (Gesser, 2007; Johansen, 2005). The increase 
in Th1 cytokines has been related to keratinocyte hyperproliferation and chemoattraction of neutrophils 
(Guenther, 2002; McKay, 1995; Barker, 1991). Also, stimulated keratinocytes produce vascular 
endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (Detmar, 1994) that together with tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha promotes angiogenesis, dilation and tortuosity of capillaries, conferring the 
characteristic vascular changes to the psoriatic lesion in the dermis (Guenther, 2002). Another 
consequence from stimulation of Th1 cells and keratinocytes is the up-regulation of intercellular 
adhesion molecule 1 in vascular endothelial cells (Detmar, 1992), which enhances the inflammatory 
infiltrate into the affected skin. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
Psoriasis is a stigmatising condition that can have a major impact on quality of life, to a similar extent 
as cancer, heart disease and diabetes (Menter, 2007; Cohen, 2012; Chong, 2013). Psoriatic lesions 
can be itchy and painful and cause extreme physical and emotional discomfort to patients (Menter, 
2007; Nestle, 2009; Cohen, 2012; Chong, 2013). In addition, in its most severe presentations, 
patients with psoriasis have an increased risk of developing other comorbidities such as depression, 
diabetes and cardiovascular disease (Cohen, 2012; Chong, 2013), which can eventually increase the 
overall risk of mortality (Nestle, 2009; Salahadeen, 2015). 
2.1.5.  Management 
At present there is no definitive cure for psoriasis. Available treatments focus primarily on the use of 
anti-inflammatory  or  immunomodulatory  agents  to  control  the  symptoms  of  the  disease  and  prevent 
further  relapses.  The  management  of  mild  psoriasis  usually  consists  of  topical  treatments  (e.g. 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 8/108 
 
 
 
 
corticosteroids,  calcipotriene,  retinoids,  salicylic  acid,  coal  tar,  dithranol,  and  emollients)  (Krueger, 
2005; Menter, 2007; Nestle, 2009). Treatments for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis include 
phototherapy and systemic treatment with oral agents (methotrexate, ciclosporin, retinoids, FAEs) and 
injectable  biotechnology-derived  products  such  as  infliximab,  etanercept,  and  adalimumab  (Cohen, 
2012;  Chong,  2013).  More  recent  additions  to  the  therapeutic  armamentarium  include  the  biologics 
ustekinumab and secukinumab, and the small molecule apremilast.  
The “European S3-Guidelines on the Systemic Treatment of Psoriasis Vulgaris” (Pathirana et al., 2009), 
which  was  supported  by  the  European  Dermatology  Forum  in  cooperation  with  the  European 
Association  for  Dermatology  and  Venereology  and  the  International  Psoriasis  Council  and  the  “S3  – 
Guidelines on the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris (English version). Update” (Nast et al. 2012) refers to 
the  use  of  FAE  (Fumaric  acid  esters),  particularly  to  Fumaderm.  Amongst  others  dimethyl  fumarate 
(DMF) and monoethyl fumarate (MEF) are fumaric acid esters.  
In Germany Fumaderm gastro-resistant tablet for oral use was approved in 1994 for the treatment of 
moderate to severe forms of psoriasis vulgaris if external treatment alone is not sufficient. Fumaderm 
is a fixed combination medicinal product which is available in two strengths.  The tablets contain DMF 
30 mg resp. 120 mg, as well as the calcium, magnesium, and zinc salts of monoethyl fumarate (MEF 
(also known as ethyl hydrogen fumarate (EHF) as three further active ingredients each.  
Table 1 – Active substances of Fumaderm initial and Fumaderm 
The gastro-resistant tablet formulation was designed to improve tolerability by avoiding dissolution in 
the  gastric  media  of  the  stomach  and  enabling  release  of  the  active  substance  in  the  intestinal  fluid, 
and  it  has  been  reported  to  decrease  the  rate  of  gastrointestinal  adverse  effects  (Rostami-Yazdi, 
2008). 
Fumaderm initial and Fumaderm are the most commonly prescribed oral therapy in Germany for the 
systemic treatment of psoriasis. Current German guidelines recommend a gradual increase in FAE 
dosage to determine optimal efficacy and tolerability for each patient. Although Fumaderm products 
are only approved in Germany, special provisions allow FAEs to be prescribed in a number of other 
countries, e.g. UK and Ireland. 
About the product 
Almirall S.A., has developed dimethyl fumarate (DMF) 30 mg and 120 mg gastro-resistant tablets 
intended for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults in need of systemic drug 
therapy. 
The applied and approved indication is: 
Skilarence is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults in need of 
systemic medicinal therapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 9/108 
 
 
 
 
 
The  active  ingredient  in  Skilarence  30  mg  and  120  mg  gastro-resistant  tablets  is  DMF,  the  dimethyl 
ester of fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid), a simple, unsaturated dicarbonic acid compound that is 
an  intermediate  in  the  mammalian  citric  acid  cycle.  FAEs,  including  DMF,  are  immunomodulating 
agents that are effective in the treatment of psoriasis. 
The  anti-inflammatory  and  immunosuppressive  effects  of  dimethyl  fumarate  and  its  metabolite 
monomethyl fumarate are not fully elucidated but are thought to be mainly due to the interaction with 
the  intracellular  reduced  glutathione  of  cells  directly  involved  in  the  pathogenesis  of  psoriasis,  as 
dendritic cells, lymphocytes, keratinocytes and endothelial cells. This interaction with glutathione leads 
to the  inhibition  of  the  translocation  into the  nucleus  and  the  transcriptional  activity of  nuclear  factor 
‘kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells’ (NF-κB). 
The  development  rationale  for  Skilarence  30  mg  resp.  120  mg  gastro-resistant  tablets  was  based  on 
the  proven  efficacy  and  safety  of Fumaderm  and  evidence  suggesting  that  DMF  is  mainly  responsible 
for the anti-psoriatic activity of these products, as understood by the applicant from data published in 
literature. 
Consequently, the only active ingredient in Skilarence is DMF (30 mg resp. 120 mg). Skilarence does 
not contain the MEF salts. The DMF content is quantitatively the same as in Fumaderm initial and 
Fumaderm respectively.  
To improve tolerability, it is recommended to begin treatment with a low initial dose with subsequent 
gradual increases, i.e. starting with DMF 30 mg/day and increasing the dose week by week to a 
maximum of DMF 720 mg/day. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The present application for Dimethylfumarate for the treatment of psoriasis, is a full-mixed Article 8(3) 
application  using  both  company-sponsored  non-clinical  and  clinical  studies  including  a  pivotal  study 
and evidence from published literature.  
The  development  rationale  for  DMF  gastro-resistant  tablets  in  this  application,  was  based  on  the 
proven  efficacy  and  safety  of  Fumaderm  and  evidence  suggesting  that  DMF  is  mainly  responsible  for 
the  anti-psoriatic  activity  of  these  products,  as  supported  by  clinical  data  (Nieboer,  1989;  Nieboer, 
1990;  Ormerod,  2004;  Rostami  Yazdi,  2008;  Lijnen,  2015).  As  a  result,  DMF  gastro-resistant  tablets 
contains  DMF  alone  as  the  active  ingredient,  in  a  gastro-resistant  tablet  formulation,  available  in  two 
strengths (30 mg and 120 mg), corresponding to the DMF content of Fumaderm initial and Fumaderm 
respectively. In addition, the same dosage regimen is recommended with respect to the DMF content 
of Fumaderm initial and Fumaderm, and this has been used for the clinical development of DMF 30 mg 
and 120 mg gastro-resistant tablets. 
The  evaluation  of  new  medicinal  products  in  the  indication  psoriasis  should  follow  the  “Guideline  on 
Clinical 
Investigation  of  Medicinal  Products 
indicated 
for 
the  Treatment  of  Psoriasis” 
(CHMP/EWP/2454/02 corr, 2004). 
Other relevant guidelines are amongst others: 
- Dose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration (ICH E4), 
- Points to Consider on Application with 1. Meta-Analysis; 2. One Pivotal Study (CPMP/EWP/2330/99) 
- Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials (ICH topic E9), 
- Choice of Control Group in Clinical Trials (ICH E10)

Scientific  Advice  on  the  clinical  development  programme  was  received  from  European  Medicines 
Agency (EMA)/Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) on 17 February 2011 and 11 
September 2014.  
In general, the scientific advice was followed for the clinical development program. The conduct of one 
pivotal  trial only  was  principally  agreed to,  provided  the  requirements  set  out  in  the  CHMP  “Points  to 
Consider  on  Application  with  1.  Meta-Analysis;  2.  One  Pivotal  Study  (CPMP/EWP/2330/99)”  would  be 
met.  For  the  non-inferiority  of  Skilarence  compared  with  Fumaderm  for  PASI  75  after  16  weeks  of 
treatment, a non-inferiority margin of 15% was set in line with EMA/CHMP Scientific Advice. 
The  phase  III  clinical  trial  was  conducted  and  analysed  in  general  in  accordance  with  the  “CHMP 
Guideline  on  the  Clinical  Investigation  of  Medicinal  Products  indicated  for  the  Treatment  of  Psoriasis 
(CPMP/EWP/2454/02,  Nov  2004)”  and  with  the  clinical  scientific  advice  from  EMA/CHMP  on  17 
February 2011.  
With  regard  to  evaluation  of  long-term  efficacy  the  Guideline  on  Psoriasis  recommends  the 
randomisation  of  responders  either  to  active  drug  or  placebo  in  order  to  explore  the  duration  of 
remission/response,  rebound  and  time  to  relapse.  EMA  Scientific  Advice  in  2011  stated  furthermore 
that “placebo patients may be shifted to the test drug, but also patients on the active arms should be 
shifted  to  the  placebo  to  allow  gaining  the  necessary  2  further  months  of  comparative  data  on 
maintenance of effect, safety and rebound in the end (refer to Guideline)…”  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as gastro-resistant tablets containing 30 mg or 120 mg of dimethyl 
fumarate as active substance.  
Other ingredients of the tablet core are lactose monohydrate, cellulose microcrystalline, croscarmellose 
sodium,  colloidal  anhydrous  silica  and  magnesium  stearate.  The  film  coating  is  composed  of 
methacrylic  acid-ethyl  acrylate  copolymer  (1:1),  talc,  triethyl  citrate,  titanium  dioxide  (E171)  and 
simethicone  for  both  strengths.  The  film  coating  of  Skilarence  120  mg  also  contains  indigo  carmine 
(E132) and sodium hydroxide.

Figure 1. Structure of dimethyl fumarate 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of 1H-NMR and IR spectroscopy, 
by elemental analysis and by the route of synthesis.  
Dimethyl  fumarate  appears  as  a  white  crystalline  powder,  slightly  soluble  in  pH  range  from  1-6.8, 
soluble in acetone, slightly soluble in ether and poorly soluble in ethanol.  
Dimethyl fumarate does not contain chiral centres. Dimethyl fumarate is the trans (or E) isomer. X-Ray 
Powder  Diffraction  (XRPD)  and  Differential  Scanning  Calorimetry  (DSC)  data  confirm  the  existence  of 
only one crystal form. Polymorphism has not been observed for dimethyl fumarate.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed  information  on  the  manufacturing  of  the  active  substance  (AS)  has  been  provided  in  the 
restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Dimethyl  fumarate  is  synthesized  in  one  synthesis  step  followed  by  crystallisation,  purification  and 
drying. 
Critical  steps  and  critical  process  parameters  have  been  identified.  Adequate  in-process  controls  are 
applied during the synthesis.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on  chemistry  of  new  active  substances.  The  fate  and  carry  over  of  genotoxic  impurities  have  been 
discussed satisfactorily.  
All  components  used  as  primary  packaging  material  have  been  described  and  are  food  grade  and 
comply with the requirements of Ph. Eur. and European Directive 10/2011 as amended.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for appearance (visual), clarity 
and  colour  of  the  solution,  pH,  identity  (IR,  HPLC),  water  content,  sulphates,  sulphated  ash,,  heavy 
metals, related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), particle size distribution and residual solvents (GC). 
The  overall  control  strategy  for  the  related  impurities  is  acceptable;  sufficient  information  has  been 
provided  on  the  control  of  the  potential  impurities  (including  genotoxic)  and  to  demonstrate  that 
potential impurities arising from the described route of synthesis are adequately removed.  
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately  validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch  analysis  data  from  three  production  scale  batches  of  the  active  substance  were  provided.  The

Stability 
Stability  studies  on  three  production  scale  batches  of  dimethyl  fumarate  from  the  proposed 
manufacturer  stored  in  the  intended  commercial  package  under  long  term  conditions  (5  ºC  ±  3 ºC) 
have  been  performed.  Data  up  to  36  months  for  all  primary  batches  except  one  (for  which  up  to  24 
months  data  are  available)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (25 ºC / 60% RH), 
according to the ICH guidelines, were provided.  
In  addition,  supportive  stability  data  on  another  three  production  scale  batches  of  dimethyl  fumarate 
from the proposed manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 48 months under 
long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC 
/ 75% RH, according to the ICH guidelines, were provided. The stability results indicate the material is 
stable for 48 months without storage conditions in the tested container closure systems.  
Samples  were  tested  for  description,  water  content,  assay,  organic  impurities,  residual  solvents  and 
particle  size  distribution.  The  analytical  methods  and  acceptance  criteria  are  the  same  as  applied  for 
release testing and have been shown to be stability indicating. 
Results  on  stress  conditions  (heat,  humidity,  UV  radiation,  basic  and  acidic  conditions  and  oxidation) 
were also provided. The conclusion of the forced degradation studies was that dimethyl fumarate is a 
stable molecule that can only be degraded at extreme conditions. 
Photostability information was also provided and showed that dimethyl fumarate is photostable.  
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently  stable.  The  stability  results  justify  the  proposed  retest  period  of  36  months  of  dimethyl 
fumarate stored in a refrigerator (2-8 ºC) in the two proposed container closure systems. Measures are 
in  place  to  ensure  that  the  overall  retest  period  for  dimethyl  fumarate,  calculated  from  the 
manufacturing  date  onwards  will  not  exceed  the  total  period  of  48  months  established  by  the 
manufacturer of dimethyl fumarate. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as round and biconvex gastro-resistant tablets, white for 30 mg 
tablets and blue for 120 mg tablets, intended for oral administration. 
Dimethyl fumarate is known to cause gastrointestinal irritation; hence the aim of the development was 
a gastro-resistant tablet product to protect the gastric mucosa. The aim was the gastro-resistant tablet 
cores to only contain 30 mg or 120 mg dimethyl fumarate as active substance and followed by 
subsequent coating.  
During development, different excipients were tested and some changes in the formulation were 
introduced to achieve the most suitable formulation and to improve the stability and target dissolution 
profile of the final product. The coating composition and applied amount on the tablets has been 
optimised 
The tablets are obtained from the same blend but tableted at different weights to obtain two 
proportional cores of different strengths. Each tablet is coated with a different coating dispersion to 
obtain the final dimethyl fumarate 30 mg and 120 mg film-coated tablets. 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017

The influence of the particle size distribution of the active substance was studied in order to assess its 
impact on the manufacture and the performance of the 30 mg and 120 mg drug products. Based these 
test results about the manufacturability and dissolution the particle size distribution limits for the 
active substance were established. 
The gastro-resistant coating is necessary, in order to improve the gastrointestinal tolerability by 
avoiding dissolution in the gastric media and enabling the release of the active substance in the 
intestinal tract. 
The manufacturing process development was focused on 3 main stages: manufacturing of the blend 
(blending), blend compression into tablet cores (tableting) and coating of the tablet cores. The 
manufacturing process was adjusted and adapted during the scale-up stage, to afford a finished 
product within the proposed specifications. 
A standard blending process was designed considering the rheological properties of the active 
substance and the excipients, in order to achieve good active content homogeneity as well as an 
optimal distribution of the excipients for the best process performance.  
The tableting conditions were defined to obtain the optimal values of the target parameters (weight, 
thickness, hardness, friability, disintegration time and appearance) and to ensure suitable content and 
mass uniformity. Robustness studies on tableting speed and pressures have been performed to identify 
critical aspects impacting the different processes and to confirm the scale-up feasibility.  
Enteric coating was carried out under standard conditions. The coating process is considered the most 
critical manufacturing step as it is the responsible of the gastro resistance performance. Therefore, 
during the development phase, once the formulation showed the desired dissolution profile, a set of 
trials applying design of experiments (DoE) were carried out to guarantee the gastro-resistance of the 
film-coated tablets, and to study the limits for process parameters in relation with coating solution and 
coating process. Taking into account all the results, the critical parameters for the coating process 
were defined and limits were established.  
Manufacture of the product has been successfully transferred and scaled up to production scale batch 
size at the proposed site for manufacture of commercial batches. The clinical development batches 
were manufactured by the development site. The batches used in the clinical studies are of identical 
composition and manufactured by the same process. The in vitro drug dissolution profile of the batches 
used in the clinical study have been adequately characterised in accordance with the Bioequivalence 
guideline and the Guideline on quality of oral modified release products. In vitro dissolution 
equivalence of clinical batches and full scale batches manufactured at the commercial site has been 
demonstrated.  
The choice of the routine in vitro dissolution test in neutral buffer after the acid stage is regarded 
justified. The discriminating properties of the dissolution method are deemed demonstrated. 
The primary packaging of Skilarence 30 mg and 120 mg gastro-resistant tablets is 
PVC/PVDC-Aluminium blisters. The primary packaging is of food grade and complies with Ph.Eur. and 
EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process follows the conventional approach for solid dosage forms, employing widely 
used,  non-specialized  manufacturing  equipment,  consistent  with  that  available  within  the  proposed 
manufacturer’s facilities.  
Assessment report

The manufacturing process of gastro-resistant tablets comprises the following four main steps: 
1. Blending. The active substance and the excipients are blended. 
2. Tableting. This blend is compressed to manufacture cores of different strengths (30 mg and 120 
mg). 
3. Coating. The cores are coated with the enteric coating mixture.  
4. Packaging. The coated tablets are packaged into blisters. 
The  pharmaceutical  form  is  considered  a  specialised  form  as  per  the  process  validation  guideline 
however the manufacturing process employs conventional methods for this type of product and it has 
been described satisfactorily. 
Holding time for the bulk product is supported based on stability data. 
Critical  steps  have  been  identified  and  critical  process  parameters  were  defined  to  control  the  critical 
steps.  The  IPCs  during  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  presented  and  are  adequately  justified. 
The control strategy ensures that the manufacturing process consistently delivers a product that meets 
the defined criteria for all release specifications. 
The  manufacturing  process  has  been  satisfactorily  validated.  It  is  also  considered  that  the 
manufacturing  process  is  sufficiently  robust  to  provide  assurance  that  gastro-resistant  tablets  of 
consistent quality, complying with the designated specification, are produced. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  and  shelf  life  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  and  limits  for  this 
kind  of  dosage  form:  description  (visual),  active  substance  identification  (HPLC,  IR),  colorants 
identification (Ph.  Eur.) assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), dissolution (Ph.  Eur.), uniformity 
of mass and content (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.) and microbial purity (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  reference  standards  used  in  the  routine  analysis  of 
finished product has been presented. 
The dissolution test has been set, based on the Guideline on Quality of oral modified release products 
(EMA/CHMP/QWP/428693/2013) and Ph. Eur. 2.9.3.  
The  microbial  purity  is  specified  according  to  the  requirements  of  Ph.  Eur.  5.1.4  for  non-aqueous 
preparations for oral use. Based on the batch results and stability data, skip testing is proposed, once 
the validation of the manufacturing process is completed. 
Batch analysis data for 6 pilot scale and 4 production scale batches of 120 mg strength and for 4 pilot 
scale and 3 production scale batches of 30 mg strength, manufactured with the proposed commercial 
formulation  of  Dimethyl  fumarate  were  presented.  All  batches  are  representative  of  the  process  and 
the results show that the finished product meets the proposed specification limits.  
Stability of the product 
Stability  studies  on  4  pilot  batches  and  one  commercial  scale  batch  for  the  30  mg  strength  of  the 
finished product and 4 pilot batches and two commercial scale batches for the 120 mg strength of the 
finished  product,  have  been  conducted  in  line  with  the  ICH  Stability  Guidelines  under  long  term 
conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH for up to 36 months and accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH for 6

months.  Appropriate  post-approval  stability  commitments  are  provided.  The  stability  batches  are 
identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for 
marketing.  
Stability  of  the  bulk  intermediate  (coated  tablets)  product  in  the  proposed  containers  has  also  been 
investigated. The proposed holding time is supported by the presented data. 
The  following  parameters were  investigated:  description,  water  content,  assay,  degradation  products, 
dissolution  test  and  microbial  purity.  The  shelf-life  specification,  acceptance  criteria  and  analytical 
procedures, which were shown to be stability-indicating, were applied. No significant change in any of 
the tested parameters was observed during the study, as all the parameters tested met the acceptance 
criteria  for  all  samples  stored  at  long  term  and  accelerated  storage  conditions,  and  no  appreciable 
differences  between  batches  manufactured  with  different  drug  substance  batches  were  observed  for 
any of the parameters studied. No trends were observed. 
A photostability study was conducted on one pilot scale batch of each strength according to ICH Q1B 
Guideline.  No  significant  change  was  observed  in  any  of  the  tested  parameters  (description,  assay, 
degradation  products  and  dissolution  test)  and  the  results  confirm  that  the  product  is  not 
photosensitive  and  the  immediate  pack  proposed  for  marketing  provides  adequate  protection  to  light 
exposure.  
Based  on  the  provided  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf  life  of  36  months  with  no  special  storage 
conditions, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable.

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
All pivotal non-clinical toxicity studies with LAS190046 (DMF active ingredient) were consistent with 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Nonclinical Testing Guidelines and in compliance with 
the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Regulations. 
The non-clinical development programme for DMF consists of company-sponsored studies 
complemented with publicly available published data on Fumaderm, FAEs in general, and DMF in 
particular. 
At  different  stages  of  DMF  development,  the  applicant  has  obtained  scientific  advice  from  different 
regulatory  authorities.  Non-clinical  advice  primarily  concerned  the  requirements  to perform  additional 
non-clinical bridging studies to supplement the published literature on the safety profile of DMF. 
Since DMF is contained within Fumaderm for which there is considered to be a long history of clinical 
use (19 years in Germany), the safety and efficacy of DMF was generally considered to be adequately 
documented  and  toxicologically  well  defined,  as  supported  by  the  available  literature  data.  A  brief 
summary  of  existing  non-clinical  toxicology  data  for  DMF  has  therefore  been  provided  in  the 
submission, but in order to address any gaps in the non-clinical data and to provide comparative safety 
data  with  Fumaderm,  a  non-clinical  testing  programme  for  DMF  has  also  been  conducted  to  support 
the marketing authorisation for Skilarence. Furthermore, supporting information was also derived from 
clinical studies or publications of clinical studies with DMF. 
The  applicant  has  conducted  one  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  study  (absorption)  of  DMF  (LAS190046  [DMF 
active  ingredient])  and  DMF  in  combination  with  monoethyl  fumarate  (MEF  [i.e,  LASW1837  (Blend  of 
active ingredients, DMF + MEF salts at the same proportion presented in the Fumaderm formulation)]) 
in mice; and several in vitro and in vivo toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs, with DMF, DMF + MEF 
salts  or  monomethyl  fumarate  (MMF),  the  main  metabolite  of  DMF.  All  in  vivo  studies,  except  one 
study in dogs where a tablet administration method was investigated, were conducted via oral gavage 
using aqueous suspensions on 0.5% methylcellulose. 
Supporting information was also derived from the literature and direct human experience via three 
Phase I PK clinical trials in healthy subjects and one Phase III efficacy and safety clinical trial in 
patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. In the Phase III clinical trial, DMF was 
administered at a starting dose of 30 mg daily and titrated up to a maximum of 720 mg daily.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The  pharmacology  of  fumaric  acid  esters  (FAEs)  including  DMF  is  generally  well  known,  and  the 
applicant has not conducted primary/secondary pharmacodynamic, pharmacodynamic drug interaction 
or  stand-alone  safety  pharmacology  studies  with  either  DMF  or  other  FAEs.  Instead,  a  review  of  the 
known pharmacology of DMF alone, DMF in combination with MEF salts, MMF and fumaric acid from the 
published literature has been provided.  
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 17/108 
 
 
 
 
There  are  numerous  published  reports  supporting  the  proposed  mechanism  of  action  of  DMF  and  its 
metabolite  MMF  in  the  treatment  of  psoriasis,  mainly  through  its  anti-inflammatory  and  immune-
modulating  effects  on  lymphocytes,  keratinocytes  and  endothelial  cells.  Central  to  these  effects  is 
believed to  be  the interaction  with  intracellular  reduced  GSH,  which  induces  hemoxygenase-1  (HO-1) 
and inhibits the transcriptional activity of NF-κB, which results in a shift in cytokine/chemokine profile 
towards  an  anti-inflammatory  and  anti-proliferative  response.  This  includes  down-regulation  of  pro-
inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-1), inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation, inhibition 
of  expression  of  adhesion  molecules  (e.g.  ICAM-1  on  keratinocytes  and  endothelial  cells),  which  is 
believed to reduce trafficking and accumulation of leukocytes within the psoriatic plaque.  
No  stand-alone  safety  pharmacology  studies  have  been  conducted,  but  the  applicant  included  a 
functional  observational  battery  assessment  (FOB),  a  visual  respiratory  assessment,  ECG  evaluation 
and  renal  assessment  as  part  of  the  pivotal  13  week  oral  (gavage)  toxicity  study  in  beagle  dogs  to 
compare  any  safety  pharmacological  effects  with  DMF  (LAS190046)  to  those  of  DMF  +  MEF  salts 
(55.8%  and  44.2%  respectively;  the  same  proportion  as  presented  in  the  Fumaderm  formulation; 
LASW1837) at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day. In this study, there was no effect  on the measured safety 
pharmacology  endpoints  with  either  DMF  or  DMF  +  MEF  salts.  Furthermore,  clinical  studies  (studies 
1102, 1103 and 1104) submitted by the applicant conducted with the DMF gastro-resistant tablets did 
not show any changes in vital signs. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  DMF  has  been  primarily  supported  by  published  literature,  but  the  applicant 
has conducted one pharmacokinetic study in mice and several in vitro studies primarily to characterise 
the potential for drug interactions.  
The human plasma protein binding of MMF was shown to be between 42-51% over the concentration 
range  studied.  Pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic  studies  of  DMF  and  its  primary  active  metabolite  (MMF) 
have been conducted in animals using protein precipitation followed by LC-MS/MS. DMF is rapidly pre-
systemically  hydrolysed  to  MMF  after  oral  administration  and  therefore,  PK  analysis  was  only 
performed on MMF.  
Absorption  of  DMF  following  administration  of  a  single  oral  dose  of  DMF  (LAS190046)  or  DMF  +  MEF 
salts  (LASW1837)  was  measured  as  the  level  of  MMF  (and  MEF  in  LASW1837  dose  groups)  in  mouse 
plasma  in  a  GLP-compliant  pharmacokinetic  study  conducted  by  the  applicant.  Plasma  concentrations 
of MMF suggested rapid absorption of DMF following oral administration (between 2-15 min post dose), 
and also rapid biotransformation in plasma of DMF to MMF. Several published studies have confirmed 
that  DMF  is  hydrolysed  to  MMF  in  the  GI  tract,  primarily  in  the  small  intestine.  In  addition,  rapid 
conjugation  of  DMF  with  GSH  further  explains  the  lack  of  detectable  amounts  of  DMF  in  the  plasma 
after  oral  administration.  GSH  conjugation  is  likely  to  occur  in  the  portal  vein  and/or  in  the  small 
intestine.  In  the  applicants  study,  there  were  no  appreciable  differences  in  exposure  between  DMF 
(LAS190046) or DMF + MEF salts (LASW1837) when dosed at the same dose level (140 mg/kg). DMF, 
MMF (and MEF in LASW1837-treated animals) were detected in the stomach content, and generally the 
profiles for MMF and DMF in the stomach and intestinal contents were similar following administration 
of DMF or DMF + MEF salts. However, DMF, MMF and MEF levels were low or absent in the duodenum 
contents.  Absorption  of  FAE  from  the  small  intestine  into  the  circulation  has  been  reported  to  be 
dependent on the permeability of the intestinal membrane and the stability of the various FAEs in the 
small  intestine.  In  addition,  pre-systemic  hydrolysis  of  DMF  to  MMF  is  dependent  on  the  pH  of  the 
environment,  the  lipophilicity  of  the  monoester  fumarates  themselves  and  the  activities  of  esterases 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 18/108 
 
 
 
 
such  as  carboxyl-  and  cholinesterases.  Monocytes/lymphocytes  have  also  been  implicated  in  the 
hydrolysis of DMF to MMF.  
Apart from the serum protein binding capacity of DMF (absent) and MMF/MEF (low), there is no non-
clinical  information  on  the  distribution  profile  of  DMF  and  its  metabolites.  The  absence  of  this 
information is generally considered acceptable, given the long history of clinical experience with FAEs. 
There  is  also  no  information  on  whether  DMF  or  its  metabolites  are  excreted  in  the  breast  milk  in 
animals or humans. The absence of this information is adequately reflected in section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
Apart from a study to evaluate the hydrolysis process in human whole blood, the applicant has not 
conducted additional non-clinical metabolism studies. DMF is very rapidly hydrolysed in human blood 
with DMF levels below the lower limit of quantification after 5 minute incubation. Based on limited 
literature data, there is no evidence for the involvement of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the 
metabolism of FAEs in the liver. MMF is metabolised into fumaric acid and, in the tricarboxylic acid 
(TCA) cycle, into water and CO2. A smaller proportion is excreted in the urine and faeces. No drug 
interaction studies have been conducted, and clinical drug interactions have not been reported. From a 
clinical perspective, further data have been requested on the possible effect of DMF and the major 
metabolite MMF on cytochrome P450s and on drug transporters. Fumarate has been shown to be a 
substrate for the renal transporter, OAT1, which is located on proximal tubular cells and its cis isomer, 
maleate, has been shown to cause proximal tubular damage in rodents, through depletion of coenzyme 
A, ATP and glutathione. It has been suggested that this mechanism may also be responsible for the 
known renal FAE side effects observed in humans. Additional data provided during the assessment 
shows that MMF (up to 750 μM) is not an inhibitor of P450 enzymes, or an inducer of CYP3A4 (up to 
250 μM), CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 (up to 200 μM). In addition, MMF only showed inhibition of BCRP at 
1000 μM, and only limited inhibition of OAT1-, OAT3-, OCT-1 and OCT-2-mediated probe transport at 
1000 μM, indicating that interactions at clinically relevant concentrations are unlikely. Finally, MMF was 
shown not to be a P-gp substrate or inhibitor (at concentrations up to 7.38 mM) 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The  toxicological  profile  of  DMF+MEF  salts  can  be  considered to  be  clinically  well-established  through 
long  term  use  of  FAEs  (mainly  Fumaderm  in  Germany),  and  the  primary  aim  of  the  applicant’s  non-
clinical acute and repeat dose toxicity studies was therefore to elucidate whether administration of DMF 
alone would result in a different toxicological response in comparison to DMF + MEF salts.  
Single dose toxicity 
The comparative acute toxicity between DMF and DMF + MEF salts was investigated by utilising 
information generated from in vivo genotoxicity studies in mice and exploratory toxicity studies in 
dogs. In mice, both components, DMF and MEF salts, appeared to contribute similarly to the observed 
acute toxicity. However, in dogs, slightly more severe clinical signs and body weight losses were 
evident in animals receiving DMF + MEF salts compared to DMF alone at equivalent doses of DMF. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In an exploratory toxicity study in dogs, tablet administration of DMF and DMF + MEF salts was 
generally associated with clinical signs of poor GI tolerance (mortality 1♀, diarrhoea and emesis, non-
digested tablets in faeces), with detrimental effects on food consumption and body weights, and highly 
variable exposure. Tablet administration in dogs was not pursued further, and the subsequent studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 19/108 
 
 
 
 
employed aqueous suspensions. Microscopic lesions were observed in the proximal straight tubules 
(minimal to moderate tubular hypertrophy, increased incidence/severity of tubular vacuolation, 
minimal to slight tubular degeneration) of the kidney, with tubular degeneration considered to be 
adverse. The findings appear to be consistent with those reported for FAEs both clinically and non-
clinically, but appeared to be slightly more pronounced and was more frequently adverse in dogs 
treated with DMF + MEF salts than those treated with DMF. In the subsequent exploratory dog study 
(DMF or DMF + MEF salts, up 75 mg/kg/day for up to 8 days), clinical signs included flushing (redness 
of ears, redness of eyes and/or of gums), emesis and salivation. Again, clinical signs and effects on 
body weights (up to +3.4% for DMF, up to -17.3% for DMF + MEF salts) were generally more severe 
in animals given DMF + MEF salts. In the pivotal 13-week toxicity study, DMF and DMF + MEF salts 
were well tolerated when administered to dogs at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day. Clinical signs included 
emesis and abnormal faeces, together with redness of the abdomen and ears, which appeared more 
marked or frequent in animals given DMF + MEF salts, but were considered non-adverse. A moderate 
increase in kidney weights in most treated groups (up to +39% relative to body weight) was noted at 
necropsy, which in males given either DMF or DMF + MEF salts at 30 mg/kg/day, correlated 
microscopically with minimal tubular hypertrophy in the kidney. This finding was fully reversible after a 
4 week treatment-free period, and was not considered adverse. Increases in NGAL values, a renal 
biomarker, were noted in some animals, but were not deemed toxicologically significant in the absence 
of morphological changes. Since NGAL is currently not considered to be a validated biomarker for early 
detection of renal damage in patients, its inclusion in clinical practice is not justified. In this study, the 
NOAEL was 30 mg/kg/day for DMF and DMF + MEF salts. The DMF exposure margins (males and 
females combined expressed as MMF, Day 1 and 90) compared to human exposure (assuming a 
human dose of 240 mg TID (720 mg total dose); Cmax = 2151 ng/ml and AUC0-24 = 10497 ng·h/ml) 
were 6.53 for Cmax and 2.91 for AUC0-24. Similar exposure margins can be calculated for DMF + MEF 
salts (Cmax = 9.7, AUC0-24 = 3.0). 
Genotoxicity 
The genotoxicity of DMF, DMF + MEF salts and MMF was evaluated by the applicant in in vitro and in 
vivo tests. There was no evidence of mutagenic activity in bacteria. However, in vitro micronucleus 
tests consistently showed an increased frequency in micronucleated cells in human peripheral blood 
monocytes at some or all experimental conditions, confirmed to be through a clastogenic mechanism. 
However, subsequent in vivo micronucleus studies in mice conducted with DMF (doses up to 1400 
mg/kg) and DMF + MEF salts (up to 700 mg/kg), failed to reproduce the in vitro findings, and in vivo 
Comet studies confirmed an absence of DNA damage in the liver, stomach and duodenum. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted, and the applicant has provided a position paper which 
reviews the available literature data with relevance to determining the potential for carcinogenicity of 
DMF, with particular focus on whether there could be a link between the well-characterised chronic 
nephrotoxicity and development of renal cell carcinomas. On the basis that fumarate has been shown 
to be a substrate for the basolateral organic anion transporter (OAT1) expressed on proximal tubular 
cells, fumarate accumulation may occur in these cells. Conversion of fumarate by fumarase to the cis 
isomer, maleate, may lead to proximal necrosis, though co-enzyme A, ATP and GSH depletion. In 
addition, activation of cellular pathways involved in oncogenesis (e.g. HIF-1α and Nrf2) has been 
described in the context of the congenital metabolic disorder, fumarate hydratase (FH) deficiency. FH 
has been described as a tumour suppressor, and FH deficiency leads to accumulation of endogenous 
fumaric acid, which has been linked to the activation of oncogenic pathways and the development of

leiomyomas and renal cells carcinomas. The mechanism of tumorigenesis may be related to the 
inhibition of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases, stabilising the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) 
complex and subsequent activation of oncogenic target genes, and to the activation of Nrf2 as a 
consequence of succination of cysteine residues, which is associated with tumour promoting activity. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
With respect to reproductive and developmental toxicity, the applicant has only completed embryo-
fetal development studies in rats.  
In the applicant’s 13-week study, there was no evidence of changes in male and female reproductive 
organs as a result of treatment with either DMF alone or DMF + MEF salts. In addition, no signals for 
fertility effects have been raised from clinical use of DMF+MEF salts.  
The NOAEL for DMF in the rat pivotal EFD study was 40 mg/kg/day for both maternal and embryo-fetal 
toxicity. At this dose level, the exposure margins compared to human exposure (assuming a human 
dose of 240 mg TID) were 2.0 for Cmax and 0.2 for AUC0-4. 
Other toxicity studies 
There  are  no  toxicological  concerns  relating  to  drug  substance  and  drug  product  impurities  and 
excipients.  While  the  main  DMF  metabolite,  MMF,  has  been  shown  to  induce micronuclei  formation in 
vitro, this finding is not likely to biologically relevant, as an absence of micronuclei were confirmed in 
vivo  for  DMF  and  DMF  +  MEF  salts.  The  proposed  limit  of  MMF  at  1%  in  LAS190046  is  considered 
acceptable in the light of the absence of genotoxic potential, and the fact that it is a major metabolite 
of DMF.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant provided an environmental risk assessment for the active ingredient dimethyl fumarate 
being not in line with the respective guidelines. However, the applicant agreed to perform an 
experimental log Kow study and a Phase II, Tier A environmental risk assessment for DMF. It should be 
noted that in dependence on the study outcomes further investigations on the environment could be 
necessary. The study results will be provided post-authorisation. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Due to the established clinical experience with DMF + MEF salts, only an abridged non-clinical package 
of studies have been completed by the applicant, primarily to establish whether any differences exist in 
the  toxicological  profile  of  DMF  alone  compared  to  the  combination  of  DMF  +  MEF  salts,  currently 
marketed in Germany as Fumaderm. The majority of other non-clinical information in the dossier has 
been supported by published literature. This approach is generally considered acceptable from the non-
clinical perspective.  
There  are  numerous  published  reports  supporting  the  proposed  mechanism  of  action  of  DMF  and  its 
metabolite  MMF  in  the  treatment  of  psoriasis.  However,  certain  aspects  of  the  DMF  pharmacology 
have, not been fully elucidated. Oral administration of DMF does not result in detectable DMF plasma 
concentrations, which questions whether DMF actually reaches the intended site of action in the skin. 
MMF is, however, detected in plasma.

Overall, the applicant has provided an adequate discussion of the primary pharmacology of FAEs 
including DMF in relation to the treatment of psoriasis. 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  DMF  has  been  primarily  supported  by  published  literature,  but  the  applicant 
has conducted one pharmacokinetic study in mice and several in vitro studies primarily to characterise 
the  potential  for  drug  interactions.  This  is  considered  acceptable,  and  any  missing  non-clinical 
pharmacokinetic information may be superseded by clinical experience with other FAEs.  
The  methods  of  analysis  to  determine  levels  of  DMF  and  MMF  (and  MEF  in  mouse  and  dog)  from 
mouse,  rat  and  dog  plasma  have  been  provided.  Validation  reports  for  these  plasma  assays  are 
considered  adequate,  and  the  methods  are  considered  to  be  suitably  validated  with  an  acceptable 
dynamic range. 
The Pharmacokinetic data obtained is consistent with the available literature data. 
Administration of DMF in repeat dose toxicity studies of up to 13 weeks duration in dogs did not reveal 
any  new  or  different  toxicities  compared  to  administration  of  DMF  +  MEF  salts,  given  at  equivalent 
doses  of  DMF.  Flushing  and  signs  of  local  GI  tolerance  issues  (diarrhoea,  emesis,  body  weight 
decreases) were present following dosing or either DMF alone and DMF + MEF salts, with evidence of a 
slight  worsening  in  animals  given  DMF  +  MEF  salts.  Adverse  degeneration  in  the  proximal  straight 
tubules of the kidney was present in an exploratory toxicity study of shorter duration (up to 10 days), 
and appeared to be slightly more pronounced and more frequently adverse in dogs treated with DMF + 
MEF  salts  than  those  treated  with  DMF  alone.  The  observed  non-clinical  findings  are  consistent  with 
those  reported  for  FAEs  both  clinically  and  non-clinically.  In  the  RMP,  flushing  and  gastrointestinal 
events  have  been  identified  as  important  identified  risks,  and  renal  injury  and  proteinuria  has  been 
identified as an important potential risk, with regular renal function monitoring required in patients. 
Overall, there appears to be no significant difference in toxicological profile between DMF and DMF + 
MEF  salts,  when  given  at  equivalent  doses  of  DMF.  It  is  noted  that  only  non-adverse  renal  changes 
(tubular hypertrophy) was demonstrated in the pivotal 13 week study, where the highest dose tested 
was 30 mg/kg. However, adverse renal findings were observed at higher doses in an exploratory study 
of  shorter  duration,  and  generally  systemic  toxicity,  as  evidenced  primarily  renal  findings,  appears 
similar  between  animals  given  DMF  and  DMF  +  MEF  salts.  Importantly,  nephrotoxicity  has  previously 
been  reported  both  non-clinically  and  clinically  with  DMF  +  MEF  salts,  and  kidney  function  should 
therefore be monitored in patients. In contrary to  what has previously been  reported, the addition of 
MEF  salts  may  slightly  worsen  GI  tolerance  in  dogs  compared  to  DMF  alone.  Although  testicular 
changes have previously been reported in rats treated with DMF and MEF salts, there was no evidence 
of macroscopic or microscopic changes in reproductive organs in the 13-week dog study conducted by 
the  applicant.  Overall,  the  applicant  has  provided  sufficient  evidence  from  their  repeat  dose  toxicity 
studies to confirm that the toxicity profile between DMF alone and DMF + MEF salt does not appear to 
be different.  
Similar  to  DMF  +  MEF  salts  and  MMF,  DMF  was  concluded  not  to  be  genotoxic  in  a  series  of  studies 
conducted by the applicant.  
No DMF carcinogenicity studies were conducted, and the applicant has provided a position paper which 
reviews the available literature data with relevance to determining the potential for carcinogenicity of 
DMF,  with  particular  focus  on  whether  there  could  be  a  link  between  the  well-characterised  chronic 
nephrotoxicity and development of renal cell carcinomas. 
Since, DMF seems to stabilise HIF-1α and to activate Nrf2, which is also associated with tumour-
promoting activity, the development of renal tumours should be considered as a potential risk of the 
administration of DMF. It can be agreed that while activation of these pathways as observed in FH 
Assessment report

Page 22/108 
 
 
 
 
deficiency may substantially differ from those occurring with normally functioning Krebs cycle 
enzymes, a potential tumorigenic activity of exogenous administration of DMF cannot be ruled out. The 
potential risk relating to DMF carcinogenicity has been adequately reflected in section 5.3 of the 
Skilarence SmPC. 
With respect to reproductive and developmental toxicity, an increased incidence of fetal variations 
(supernumerary liver lobes and abnormal iliac alignment) was observed in a pivotal EFD study 
conducted in rats by the applicant. Based on these findings, which occurred with no margins to clinical 
exposure, coupled with the lack of clinical experience in pregnant women, Skilarence is contra-
indicated in pregnancy, and not recommended in women of child-bearing potential not taking 
appropriate contraception. 
The absence of the fertility and early embryonic development study and the prenatal and postnatal 
development study is considered acceptable and their absence has been adequately reflected in section 
5.3 of the SmPC. 
Due to the uncertainty regarding whether DMF and/or MMF are excreted in the breast-milk, a risk to 
new-borns/infants cannot be excluded. This has been adequately reflected in section 4.3 and 4.6 of the 
SmPC. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data is considered acceptable by CHMP. 
However, the environmental risk assessment for DMF is currently incomplete and does not allow a 
definitive conclusion on the potential risk to the environment. The CHMP recommended that additional 
studies shall be conducted post-authorisation and the results should be submitted by the end of Q4 
2018. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is a full-mixed Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for Skilarence (dimethylfumarate) 30mg 
and  120mg  gastro-resistant  tablets  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe plaque  psoriasis  in  adult 
patients needing systemic therapy.  
Scientific  Advice  on  the  clinical  development  programme  was  received  from  the  European  Medicines 
Agency (EMA)/Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) on 17 February 2011 and 11 
September 2014.  
During  scientific  advice  procedures,  both  the  appropriate  regulatory  strategy  and  the  planned  clinical 
development program to support authorisation of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) 30mg and 120 mg tablets 
were discussed. The final outcome agreed that the strategy of an Article 8(3) – full mixed application 
with  own  clinical  data  supported  by  evidence  from  published  literature  would  be  acceptable.  The 
discussed  development  program  involved  characterising  the  PK,  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  proposed 
product and simultaneously comparing it to Fumaderm (currently authorised in Germany, containing a 
mixture  of  DMF  and  other  mono  ethyl  fumarate  salts)  with  the  objective  of  supporting  the 
extrapolation of literature with Fumaderm and other fumarate products to the proposed DMF product, 
Skilarence. In particular, the phase III comparative clinical efficacy and safety study was discussed and

the  planned  study  design,  patient  population,  primary  &  secondary  endpoints  and  the  statistical 
comparisons including the interim analysis was agreed with EMA/CHMP. 
In general, the scientific advice was followed for the clinical development program and there are no 
significant deviations from the discussed program. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

seems - were thus excluded from the fed analysis set. In addition, for one subject (# 006, sequence T1-R1-T2-R2),

no  valid  results  could  be  obtained  in  Period  2  and  Period  3  at  10  h  a.a.  and  9.5  h  a.a.,  respectively.  Thus,  the 
subject was excluded from PK analyses at those time points. 
3 two subjects were excluded from the analysis because they did not complete all treatments. In addition, 6 
subjects in the LAS41008 arm, and 10 in the Fumaderm arm, had to be excluded from the analysis for anomalous 
Cmax and AUC data 
The  first  two  pilot  studies  (study  1103  and  1104)  characterise  the  PK  and  compare  it  to  Fumaderm, 
while  the  pivotal  study  1102  compares  and  characterises  the  efficacy  of  DMF  with  both  placebo  and 
Fumaderm.  In  addition  to  the  above  prospective,  controlled  studies,  the  applicant  has  submitted  an 
overview  which  includes  data  from  published  literature  on  other  DMF  containing  products, 
predominantly  with  Fumaderm  (which  contains  DMF  in  the  same  quantities  as  in  the  proposed 
formulation and in addition contains 3 salts of monoethyl fumarate).

As the PK characterisation of Skilarence was considered to be inadequate particularly to properly 
characterise the PK of the proposed formulation and to support the bridging to literature evidence on 
Fumaderm, the applicant submitted an additional comparative PK Study (study 08) - A randomised, 
open label, single centre four way crossover study to investigate the pharmacokinetics of LAS41008 
120 mg gastro resistant tablet and Fumaderm120 mg gastro resistant tablet under fasting and fed 
conditions in healthy subjects, during the procedure. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
After oral intake, no DMF was detected in plasma because it is rapidly hydrolysed by esterases to MMF 
and/or interacts with GSH to form conjugates.  
In the Litjens (Litjens, 2004b) in vitro study, DMF was almost completely hydrolysed to MMF at pH 8, 
but not at an acidic pH, suggesting that this hydrolysis occurs mainly within the small intestine and not 
in the stomach, while MMF and MEF remained stable. Although the pH of blood and serum is the same 
(pH 7.4), the t1/2 of DMF in whole blood was significantly shorter than that in serum, which is 
explained by the presence of monocytes/lymphocytes, cells that hydrolyse DMF to MMF. The different 
interactions between these FAEs and the various cell types (including cells in the psoriatic lesions) may 
explain the beneficial effects of FAEs in psoriasis. 
When  taken  with  food  the  PK  of  DMF  may  be  even  more  variable  (please  refer  to  discussion  of  the 
three PK-studies). 
From the results of study 08, it is seen that the difference in exposure of MMF between Skilarence and 
Fumaderm in the fasted state is higher than in the fed state. 
Distribution 
Following oral administration, DMF arrives in the small intestine where it is mainly hydrolysed (Litjens, 
2004a;  Litjens,  2004b).  The  mucosa  and  intestinal  alkaline  milieu  represent  a  strong  pre-systemic 
metabolic barrier for DMF on its way into the systemic circulation, as it is evidenced that DMF cannot 
penetrate through this layer (Werdenberg, 2003); however, the mercapturic acid of DMF has recently 
been detected in urine of psoriasis patients. This suggests that in the event that any DMF penetrates 
through  the  mucosa  without  being  metabolised,  this  DMF  enters  the  portal  vein  blood  to  either  be 
hydrolysed  by  esterases  present  in  plasma,  resulting  in  MMF,  or  reacts  with  GSH  to  form  a  GSH-
conjugate (Rostami-Yazdi, 2009; Schmidt, 2007). As no DMF is detected in the plasma, this indicates 
the presence of strong first-pass metabolism (Rostami-Yazdi, 2008).  
While  MMF  displays  a  protein  binding  of  50%  (Mrowietz,  1999),  DMF  does  not  show  any  binding 
activity  to  serum  proteins,  which  may  further  contribute  to  its  rapid  turnover  in  the  circulation  (Lee, 
2008). 
Elimination 
Applicant-sponsored  PK  studies  and  published  data  have  shown  that  MMF  concentrations  rise  sharply 
and  decline  very  rapidly  in  plasma,  with  a  t1/2  of  less  than  1  hour  (Litjens,  2004a;  Litjens,  2004b; 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 26/108 
 
 
 
 
 
Mrowietz,  2009;  Rostami-Yazdi,  2008);  no  circulating  MMF  is  present  at  9  hours  or  13  hours  in  the 
majority of subjects under fasted and fed conditions, respectively (Clinical Study Report 1103, Section 
11.4.1.1).  Due  to  the  short  half-life  of  MMF,  no  accumulation  of  MMF  in  plasma  is  expected.  The 
mercapturic acid of DMF has been detected in urine of psoriasis patients, indicating renal excretion of 
DMF metabolised to GSH-conjugates (Rostami-Yazdi, 2009).  
DMF  is  hydrolysed  to  MMF,  then  it  is  metabolized  into  FA  and  it  is  further  converted  to  water  and 
carbon  dioxide  in  the  tricarboxylic  acid  cycle  (Lee,  2008).  These  metabolic  products  are  primarily 
excreted  through  breathing  with  small  amounts  excreted  in  urine  and  faeces  (reported  by  Mrowietz, 
1999). There is some renal elimination of DMF as conjugates. 
Following oral administration, DMF arrives in the small intestine where it is mainly hydrolysed (Litjens, 
2004a;  Litjens,  2004b).  The  mucosa  and  intestinal  alkaline  milieu  represent  a  strong  pre-systemic 
metabolic barrier for DMF on its way into the systemic circulation, as it is evidenced that DMF cannot 
penetrate through this layer (Werdenberg, 2003); however, the mercapturic acid of DMF has recently 
been detected in urine of psoriasis patients. This suggests that in the event that any DMF penetrates 
through  the  mucosa  without  being  metabolised,  this  DMF  enters  the  portal  vein  blood  to  either  be 
hydrolysed  by  esterases  present  in  plasma,  resulting  in  MMF,  or  reacts  with  GSH  to  form  a  GSH-
conjugate (Rostami-Yazdi, 2009; Schmidt, 2007). As no DMF is detected in the plasma, this indicates 
the presence of strong first-pass metabolism (Rostami-Yazdi, 2008). 
Studies  have  shown  that  the  metabolism  of  FAEs  is  dependent  on  pH  and  enzymes  (Litjens,  2004b). 
Following  oral  administration,  DMF  undergoes  a  basic  hydrolysis  to  MMF  in  the  small  intestine. 
Concurrently,  DMF  is  exposed  to  various  esterases  associated  with  the  intestinal  lumen  and  mucosa 
(Werdenberg, 2003), which can also hydrolyse DMF to MMF (Rostami-Yazdi, 2008).  
Some DMF also enters the portal vein blood. This is supported by data from Rostami-Yazdi (2010), that 
the mercapturic acid of DMF is excreted in the urine of psoriasis patients (Rostami-Yazdi, 2009). Some 
of  the  absorbed  DMF  is  hydrolysed  by  esterases  present  in  plasma  (Werdenberg,  2003),  resulting  in 
MMF, and some reacts with GSH, forming a GSH-adduct that is metabolised further to the mercapturic 
acid of DMF and excreted in the urine. Finally, MMF is metabolised into FA and further metabolised to 
water and carbon dioxide in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Lee, 2008).  
There is no metabolism of FAEs through CYP-dependent pathways. This is in line with the fact that, to 
date, there are no relevant interactions with other drugs or metabolism-induced organ toxicities 
(Mrowietz, 2005; Mrowietz, 2009; Rostami-Yazdi, 2008). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
No specific dose proportionality studies with DMF were conducted. Only single dose studies were 
performed. 
Special populations 
No formal studies were conducted in special populations.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
From the cited literature it appears that there is no relevant hepatic metabolism and renal excretion 
also seems to play a minor role. According to the applicant studies on the long-term use of FAEs for 
the treatment of psoriasis have not found any relevant interactions with other drugs including those

frequently used for comorbid conditions such as agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, lipid 
modifying agents, drugs used in diabetes, calcium channel blockers, antithrombotic agents, beta-
blockers and diuretics (Thaçi, 2013, Mrowietz, 2005; Rostami-Yazdi, 2008). Only one interaction with a 
vitamin K antagonist acenocoumarol has been described. This shall be followed in the context of 
routine pharmacovigilance activities such as PSURs. 
Comparative Pharmacokinetics 
Pilot  studies  1103  and  1004  provided  some  data  on  the  comparative  pharmacokinetics  of  the  DMF 
metabolite, MMF after administration of a single dose of Skilarence and Fumaderm in both the fed and 
fasted state.  
Table 4 – Pharmacokinetic parameters of MMF in studies 1103 and 1104 following a single dose of drug 
administration under fasted and fed conditions 
The applicant performed an additional 4–way cross-over study to compare the PK of Skilarence and 
Fumaderm in both fed and fasted condition . Thirty-two subjects were included and 30 completed the 
study.  Unfortunately the time points taken were not sufficient to fully characterise the PK in all fed 
subjects and 6 subjects in the LAS41008 arm, and 10 in the Fumaderm arm, had to be excluded from 
the analysis because the characterisation of the PK is not complete.  The PK results and the 
comparative statistics between Fumaderm and Skilarence are shown in the below tables.

* Statistical analysis performed using all evaluable AUC0-t values according to the criteria previously described. 
However, 10 subjects showed ascending PK profiles at 24 h and, therefore, the AUC0-t values used in the analysis 
may be considered as truncated AUCs rather than true AUC0-t values. In a post hoc analysis these subjects were 
excluded and the ratio is around 1. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
While the mechanism of how DMF and its metabolite MMF work clinically has not been fully elucidated, 
pharmacodynamic  studies  have  shown  that  both  interfere  with  intracellular  and  extracellular  thiols, 
resulting  in  increased  levels  of  reduced  glutathione  (GSH)  after  prolonged  exposure  (Nelson,  1999). 
Shifting  the  balance  of  oxidised  to  reduced  GSH  is  known  to  induce  the  anti-inflammatory  stress 
protein hemoxygenase-1, resulting in the attenuation of cellular damage and inflammation (Ghoreschi, 
2011),  and  to  inhibit  redox-sensitive  kinases,  which  subsequently  inhibits  phosphorylation  and 
ubiquitination  of  IκB.  This  leads  to  a  diminished  translocation  of  NF-κB  and  so  an  inhibition  of 
transcription  of  NF-κB  target  genes,  which  affects  the  regulation  of  the  expression  of  inflammatory 
cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules (Stoof, 2001; Vandermeeren, 2001; Lehmann, 2007). 
This would result in the main effects by which DMF is known to improve the clinical manifestations of 
psoriasis  including:  downregulation  of  several  inflammatory  cytokines  (Lehmann,  2007),  inhibition  of 
keratinocyte  proliferation  (Sebok,  1994;  Sebok,  1998;  van  der  Schroeff,  1989),  inhibition  of  the 
expression  of  adhesion  molecules  (Stoof,  2001;  Vandermeeren,  1997;  Vandermeeren,  2001)  and 
induction of proapoptotic events (Treumer, 2003; Holins, 2006; De Jong, 1996). 
The  reviewed  literature  provides  ample  evidence  for  the  effects  of  DMF  in  cell  types  associated  with 
psoriasis.  As  summarized  by  Meissner  (Meissner,  2012),  an  overview  of  the  effects  of  DMF  in 
lymphocytes, dendritic cells, keratinocytes and endothelial cells is presented in the table below (table 
7).

Table 7  - Overview of the effects of DMF in lymphocytes, dendritic cells, keratinocytes and endothelial 
cells 
The  main  activity  of  DMF  and  MMF  is  considered  to  be  immunomodulatory,  resulting  in  a  shift  in  T 
helper  cells  (Th)  from  the  Th1  and  Th17  profile  to  a  Th2  phenotype  and  thus  reducing  inflammatory 
cytokine  production  with  induction  of  proapoptotic  events,  inhibition  of  keratinocyte  proliferation, 
reduced  expression  of  adhesion  molecules,  and  diminished  inflammatory  infiltrate  within  psoriatic 
plaques. 
To  justify  supportive  evidence  from  published  literature  which  mainly  refers  to  Fumaderm,  the 
pharmacodynamics  of  MEF  was  discussed.  In  vitro  study  data  indicate that  DMF  is  considerably  more 
potent  compared  to  MEF  in  the  test  systems).  DMF,  MMF,  as  well  as  monoethyl  fumarate  (MEF) 
inhibited the proliferation of keratinocytes (Thio, 1994). In this study DMF was the most potent, MMF 
and  MEF  intermediate,  and  FA  and  malonic  acid  the  least  potent  growth  inhibitors.  Also  van  der 
Schroeff, 1989, found a strong inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation by DMF and moderate inhibition 
by MMF and MEF, respectively. In the study by Sebök, 1994, inhibitory effects on keratinocytes were 
observed for MEF salts at clearly higher concentrations compared to DMF.   
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The  applicant  has  not  presented  any  discussion  of  the  clinical  data  on  the  primary  or  secondary 
pharmacology  of  DMF  except  for  an  expert  report  on  its  potential  to  cause  QTc  prolongation.  No 
“thorough  QT”  studies  have  been  conducted  by  the  applicant  during  the  development  of  dimethyl 
fumarate  gastro-resistant  tablets.  The  expert  report  was  performed  by  using  scientific  data  bases 
information, clinical experience and data generated in 2 of the Almirall- sponsored clinical PK studies. 
Up to now, there is no evidence in medical scientific data bases (Pubmed; Cochrane; 3 January 2014) 
that  FAE-induced  prolongation  of  ventricular  repolarisation  (QT  or  QTC  interval  prolongation)  or  even 
arrhythmias  such  as  torsades  de  pointes  tachycardia.  Furthermore,  9  suspected  cases  of  undesirable 
side effects have been reported so far to the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) 
after taking Fumaderm which have been associated with syncope, collapse-like states or arrhythmias. 
The “surrogate symptoms” of torsades de pointes tachycardias reported in these patients do not show 
in any of the cases a direct indication of QT interval prolongation or torsades de pointes tachycardia. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017

the  majority  of  cases,  the  states  of  collapse  can  be  explained  by  the  flush  and/or  gastrointestinal 
symptoms.  In  the  remaining  cases,  the  symptoms  /cardiac  arrhythmia  can  be  explained  by  the 
underlying cardiovascular  disease, the cardiovascular co-medication or by accidental intoxication. The 
Expert (Professor Bonnemeier) concluded that, on the basis of the current literature and the cases with 
adverse events reported to the BfArm, it is not possible to identify any causal relationship between the 
use of FAEs and QT prolongation, or even the induction of torsades de pointes tachycardia. 
In  addition,  the  effects  of  30  mg  and  120  mg  of  dimethyl  fumarate  on  the  stimulus  conduction  and 
repolarisation  in  the  12-lead  standard  electrocardiogram  were  analysed  in  2  independent  Phase  I  PK 
studies.  In  both  studies,  12  healthy  subjects  were  exposed  to  a  single  dose  of  multiple  tablets  of  30 
mg (Study 1103) or 120 mg (Study 1104) of Fumaderm and DMF. Under respective dose ingestion, as 
well as before and after the series of tests, a 12-lead ECG was carried out in each case and stimulus 
conduction  and  repolarisation  times  determined.  Heart  rate,  PR  interval  duration,  QRS  complex 
duration,  QT  interval  duration,  Bazett’s  corrected  QT  interval  duration  (QTC  interval)  and  RR  interval 
were recorded. The Expert (Professor Bonnemeier) was not able to find in either study any significant 
influence of Fumaderm or DMF ingestion on the duration of the ventricular repolarisation. Neither after 
the  ingestion  of  Fumaderm  nor  after  the  ingestion  of  DMF  is  QTc  interval  prolongation  observed.  The 
Expert  (Professor  Bonnemeier,  2014)  concluded  that  the  systemic  therapy  with  either  Fumaderm  or 
DMF gastro-resistant tablets did not suggest any concern with respect to the potential development of 
life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pontes tachycardias. 
Given the lack of publications in the scientific data bases and that the data obtained from the Phase I 
studies  show  no  significant  cardiovascular  safety  concerns,  no  other  studies  to  investigate 
cardiovascular safety of DMF, such as a “thorough QT” study, are warranted.  
No data or discussion on the relationship between, dose-plasma-concentration-response for the effects 
of DMF has been provided.  However in the context of the vast clinical experience with fumarates in 
psoriasis as evidenced from the submitted literature, this lack of information is considered acceptable 
by CHMP. 
Only  one  possible  drug-drug  interaction  has  been  suggested  between  DMF  (a  pharmacy  DMF 
monotherapy preparation) and the vitamin K antagonist, acenocoumarol, which was observed in a 56-
year-old  female  patient  (Lijnen,  2015).  This  patient  was  regularly  treated  with  2  to  3  mg 
acenocoumarol  daily  but  required  substantially  higher  doses  after  commencing  DMF  treatment;  this 
normalised  after  discontinuation  of  DMF.  It  was  not  clear  whether  this  was  caused  by  the  excipients 
and  no  further  reports  of  drug-drug  interaction  between  DMF-containing  products  and  vitamin  K 
antagonists have been reported in published literature. 
Studies on the long-term use of FAEs for the treatment of psoriasis have not found any relevant 
interactions with other drugs including those frequently used for comorbid conditions such as agents 
acting on the renin-angiotensin system, lipid modifying agents, drugs used in diabetes, calcium 
channel blockers, antithrombotic agents, beta-blockers and diuretics (Thaçi, 2013, Mrowietz, 2005; 
Rostami-Yazdi, 2008). Metabolic organ toxicities have also not been observed (Werdenberg, 2003). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In line with the legal basis of the application (Article 8(3) of Directive of 2001/83/EC, full mixed) the 
PK  data  is  based  on  three  applicant  sponsored  PK  studies  (1103,  1104  and  08)  and  supporting 
published literature on PK data. The three PK studies 1103, 1104 (pilot studies) and 08 provide data on 
the characterisation of the PK of DMF from the proposed formulations (Skilarence 30 mg and 120 mg 
tablets) in healthy volunteers after administration in both fed and fasted state and comparative PK to

Fumaderm.  The  remaining  aspects  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of  the  active  substance  are  mainly  from 
published studies and there is indirect support on the adequacy of the pharmacokinetics of the active 
substance from the number of years of clinical use of DMF containing products (mainly Fumaderm) in 
psoriasis. 
For  an  Article  8(3)  –  full  mixed  application,  demonstration  of  bioequivalence  to  Fumaderm  is  not 
required.  However,  the  PK  studies  that  were  requested  should  allow  adequate  comparison  of  two 
differently  composed  products  in  terms  of  their  biopharmaceutical  characteristics,  in  particular  since 
recommendations  concerning  the  dosing  and  the  intake  with  food  are  the  same  for  Fumaderm  and 
Skilarence. It is agreed that the primary PK-focus is on MMF and not DMF as DMF may not be detected 
systemically  due  to  the  rapid  pre-systemically  cleavage  to  MMF.  It  is  noted  that  PK  of  MEFs  was  not 
determined in the two PK studies. 
The  applicant  had  performed  two  comparative  PK  studies  initially  to  compare  the  exposure  of 
Skilarence  with  Fumaderm,  however  the  conclusions  of  two  these  studies  were  not  clear  due  to  the 
small sample size of these studies and the high variability in pharmacokinetics seen. So the applicant 
conducted another comparative PK study in a relatively larger sample size to better characterise the PK 
and relative bioavailability of Skilarence in comparison to Fumaderm.    
The  PK  results  from  three  prospective  PK  studies  would  not  meet  the  criteria  for  bioequivalence  and 
nor  was  this  the  objective  of  these  PK  studies.  For  an  Article  8(3)  –  full  mixed  application,  it  is 
acknowledged that it is not necessary to demonstrate bioequivalence to a comparator and as such this 
is not an issue in this application.  
It is noted that the results from PK study 1103 (30mg DMF) (higher overall exposure in fed and fasted 
state)  and  study  1104  (120mg  DMF)  (lower  overall  exposure  in  fasted  state)  point  into  different 
directions.  The  applicant  commented  that  the  individual  plasma  concentrations  after  intake  of  both 
formulations differed highly between subjects. However, in cross-over designs the intra-subject rather 
than inter-subject variability is most relevant.  
Moreover  the  90%  confidence  intervals  are  quite  broad  in  these  studies,  which  is  due  to  the  low 
number  of  subjects  (n=11  in  study  1103  and  n=12  in  study  1104)  in  these  studies.  Therefore  any 
inferences drawn from these studies are not very robust. These results cannot exclude with confidence 
the potential for a different efficacy/safety of DMF as compared to Fumaderm at equivalent doses. The 
details  of the  validation  of  the  PK  macros  or the  equations  used  in  these  studies  have  been  provided 
and these are appropriate.  
Although  bioequivalence  assessments  are  not  required  here  as  the  PK  characterisation  against 
Fumaderm is meant to be supportive information to strengthen the applicability of the public literature 
on  this  product  for  Skilarence,  general  requirements  to  fully  characterize  newly  developed  modified 
release products are to be considered. This includes comprehensive biopharmaceutic characterization, 
all the more as the applicant’s product has no MEFs as compared to the reference used in the pivotal 
clinical  Phase  3  study  but  the  same  dosing  recommendations.  To  address  these  issues,  the  applicant 
provided  the  results  of  a  new  PK  study  (study  08)  during  the  procedure.  In  the  recently  conducted, 
more  robust  PK  study  (study  08)  in  a  larger  sample  size  with  the 120mg DMF  formulation,  it  is  seen 
that the exposure with Skilarence is relatively higher than Fumaderm in both fasted and fed states. A 
review of the complete study documentation shows that the study was well conducted and the results 
are reliable. The clinical overview and the relevant clinical summaries have been updated to include the 
results of the study 08.  
In addition, to the above three PK studies and in order to support the PK of the active substance DMF, 
the  applicant  had  submitted  published  studies  (Litjens,  2004a;  Rostami-Yazdi,  2010).  There  is  no 
intravenous  data  available  and  so  absolute  bioavailability  is  not  known.  In  order  to  show  that  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 33/108 
 
 
 
 
published data from Fumaderm is relevant to Skilarence the applicant addressed the point whether the 
MEFs  also  impact  on  the PK/PD  of  DMF.  A  review  of  the  in-vitro,  ex-vivo  and  in-vivo  studies  of  MEFs 
showed that they do not have a clinically significant effect at least in the systemic exposure levels of 
MMF anticipated in psoriasis patients.  
Food appears to delay absorption. In addition data is more variable which is  attributed to the enteric 
coated  formulations.  From  the  results  of  the  recently  conducted  PK  study  it  appears  that  the  food 
effect  on the  Skilarence  formulation is  higher  than  in  the  Fumaderm  formulation.  This  however  tends 
to bring the relative systemic exposure closer to each other in the recommended administration state, 
which  is  with/after  food.  This  recommendation  is  in  order  to  improve  gastric  tolerability  which  is 
acceptable  in  spite  of  the  higher  variability  as  the  dose  is  individually  titrated  based  on  patient’s 
tolerability  and  the  effects  seen  (section  4.2  of  the  proposed  SmPC:  “Skilarence  tablets  must  be 
swallowed whole with fluid during or immediately after a meal.”).   
After oral intake, no DMF was detected in plasma because it is rapidly hydrolysed by esterases to MMF 
in the intestine and/or interacts with GSH to form conjugates. The active metabolite MMF is measured 
in the plasma and it is seen after oral administration, the tmax is around 3.5 hours in the fasted state 
and 9 hours in the fed state. MMF concentrations rise sharply and decline rapidly in plasma with a half-
life  of  1  hour  and  MMF  has  a  moderate-low  protein  binding  of  50%.  Due  to  this  short  half-life,  no 
circulating  MMF  is  present  at  9  hours  or  13  hours  in  the  majority  of  subjects  under  fasted  and  fed 
conditions, respectively. However no data (either own or from literature) is available on the exposures 
following multiple dosing. However based on clearance and short elimination half-life, time dependency 
in PK is unlikely.  
MMF is then metabolized to fumaric acid and further converted to water and CO2, and these metabolic 
products are primarily excreted through breathing and small amounts of mercapturic acid of DMF are 
excreted through urine and faeces. 
The  applicant  asserts  that  as  DMF  is  not  metabolised  through  CYP  enzymes  the  potential  for  drug 
interactions  is  low.  The  applicant  also  proposes  that  due  to  the  rapid  hydrolysis  of  DMF  in  the 
gastrointestintestinal tract inhibition of CYP 3A4, Pgp and BCRP would not impact on DDIs.  This is not 
acceptable,  particularly  given  the  apparent  permeability of  DMF.    Data  should  be  provided  to  exclude 
DMF  as  an  inhibitor  of  Pgp,  BCRP  and  CYP  3A4  at  concentrations  relevant  for  CYP3A4  inhibition. 
However,  the  risk  of  this  uncertainty  is  considered  acceptable  and  the  issue  will  be  followed  up  post 
authorisation (recommendation).  
The  data  provided  for  inhibition  of  OATP1B3  can  be  accepted  to  exclude  MMF  as  an  inhibitor  of 
OATP1B3.  As  MMF  does  not  induce  CYP  enzymes,  the  applicant’s  assertion  that  an  interaction  study 
with oral contraceptives is not necessary is accepted in the context of the large clinical experience with 
fumarates. 
However,  it  is  recognised  that  a  potential  loss  in  efficacy  of  contraceptive  could  occur  due  to  GI  side 
effects  and  therefore  appropriate  warning  statements  have  been  included  in  the  SmPC  (see  section 
4.5) and an important potential risk has been included in the RMP. 
Based  on  the  understanding  of  the  PK  of  DMF,  it  is  not  anticipated  to  be  greatly  affected  by  mild  to 
moderate renal or hepatic impairment. As such no dose-alterations are recommended. However due to 
the  lack  of  data  in  severe  hepatic  and  severe  renal  impairment,  the  use  of  DMF  in  these  patients  is 
contra-indicated.  
Age has not been adequately explored and an analysis of under and above 40 years and ≥65 years 
was performed.  This is reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC: ‘Clinical studies of Skilarence had limited 
exposure to patients aged 65 years and above, and did not include sufficient numbers of patients to 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 34/108 
 
 
 
 
determine whether they respond differently than patients under 65 years (see section 5.2). Based on 
the pharmacology of dimethyl fumarate, no need for dosage adjustments in the elderly is expected.’ 
No data is available in children. This is considered acceptable as Skilarence is only indicated for adults. 
A  PK-PD  relationship  for  DMF  in  psoriasis  is  not  established  and  small  differences  in  PK  between 
Skilarence and Fumaderm are unlikely to result in interpretable differences in efficacy or safety.  
The  mechanism  of  action  of  DMF/MMF  has  not  been  well  elucidated.  However,  DMF  containing 
medicinal products have been in clinical use for the treatment of psoriasis for a number of years where 
it has proven efficacy. There are a number of published reports on the in-vitro and ex-vivo effects of 
DMF  and  MMF  which  show  that  they  are  immunomodulators  with  effects  on  various  cell  types 
associated  with  inflammation.  They  can  interfere  with  intracellular  and  extracellular  thiols  shift  the 
balance  of  oxidised  and  reduced  GSH  which  affects  the  expression  of  inflammatory  cytokines, 
chemokines and adhesion molecules through IκB and NF-κB. The overall effect of DMF/MMF is thought 
to  be  a  shift  in  T  helper  cells  from  the  Th1  and  Th17  profile  to  a  Th2  phenotype  which  has  an  anti-
inflammatory  and  pro-apoptotic  effect  in  addition  to  inhibition  of  keratinocyte  proliferation,  reduced 
expression of adhesion molecules and diminished inflammatory infiltrate within psoriatic plaques.  
Overall, the in vitro data presented for FAEs indicate that the antipsoriatic activity of fumaric therapies 
is mainly driven by DMF.  
No specific pharmacodynamic studies on possible interactions of DMF with other medicinal products or 
substances were performed or submitted from literature. The applicant has found one reported 
interaction with vitamin K antagonist in literature; however it is not clear if this is a PK or PD 
interaction. Although a review of the available literature has not found any reports of other clinically 
relevant interactions which is reassuring, this does not exclude the potential for interactions. However 
DMF containing products have been used in the treatment of psoriasis for a number of years and the 
absence of any significant reports of interactions provides sufficient reassurance to not require further 
specific studies in this regard. The lack of information on interactions and the appropriate precautions 
have been appropriately reflected in the SmPC (see section 4.5).  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  applicant  has  performed  three  PK  studies  to  compare  the  exposure  of  their  product  with 
Fumaderm.  The  initially  conducted  two  comparative  PK  studies  were  small  and  the  relative 
bioavailability between Skilarence and Fumaderm were inconsistent in these studies. So the applicant 
conducted and submitted a larger, more robust PK study during the procedure which showed that the 
exposure  of  MMF  with  Skilarence  is  relatively  higher  than  Fumaderm  in both  fasted  and  fed  states. A 
strict  bioequivalence  approach  was  not  planned  and  not  needed  for  this  full-mixed  application. 
Nevertheless  it  is  agreed  that  the  comparable  exposure  demonstrated  in  these  studies  contribute  to 
the bridging to Fumaderm literature.  
The available data can be considered adequate, in combination with the knowledge on the PK of DMF 
from published literature, to support this application. This is especially so as Fumaderm and other DMF 
containing products have been used in psoriasis with this knowledge base. In this context, the three PK 
studies submitted by the applicant can be deemed sufficient to characterise the PK from the presented 
formulation and to support the bridging to the literature data on Fumaderm.  
The available data on the pharmacodynamics is limited to published literature and the exact 
mechanisms are still unknown. However, there is adequate data to suggest that DMF can modulate the 
immune system by influencing the inflammatory cell types and other cytokine mediators of 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 35/108 
 
 
 
 
inflammation. Although the exact mechanism of action of DMF for its beneficial effects on psoriasis is 
not known, these immunomodulatory effects provide an acceptable biological basis to support the 
observed clinical effects in psoriasis. Given that DMF is a known active substance and there is 
significant clinical experience with Fumaderm and other DMF containing products, the lack of detailed 
information on its PD activity and interactions is considered acceptable. There are no outstanding 
concerns on pharmacodynamics of DMF. 
Overall, the data submitted is acceptable to support this application. 
However, as the potential for drug interaction of DMF has not been satisfactorily addressed, the CHMP 
recommended that a study will be conducted post-authorisation in order to exclude DMF as an inhibitor 
of CYP3A4, Pgp and BCRP at concentrations relevant to those in the intestine (recommendation). 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose-response study has been conducted with Skilarence (DMF). The DMF content in Skilarence and 
Fumaderm is the same. The dosing scheme used in the pivotal study was based on the dosing 
recommendation of the comparator product Fumaderm. Both Skilarence and Fumaderm are gastro-
resistant tablets. DMF 30 mg is the starting dose, which is increased week by week. The maximum 
dose is DMF 720 mg/day. According to pharmacodynamic and clinical data the main antipsoriatic effect 
is driven by DMF resp. its metabolite MMF. Moreover, in the pivotal study Skilarence was compared to 
Fumaderm. Therefore, in the context of this full-mixed application a dose-response study with 
Skilarence is not considered necessary, particularly as the dosing regimen is individualised. There is 
sufficient evidence from literature to support the proposed starting dose, the maximum daily dose and 
the proposed weekly dose-escalation regimen. In addition, the conclusive evidence of acceptability of 
this dose is based on the results of the pivotal study (study 1102) where similar dosing regimens was 
used for Skilarence and Fumaderm. Therefore and because the dose is titrated based on treatment 
response and tolerability, an independent dose finding study was not considered necessary for 
Skilarence. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
The  applicant  has  submitted  a  placebo  and  active  (Fumaderm)  comparator,  randomized,  controlled, 
pivotal  study  (study  1102)  in  support  of  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  proposed  DMF  formulation 
supported by published literature.  
The outline of the pivotal study is given in the table below.

Treatments 
The  treatment  scheme  was  the  same  for  each  treatment  group.  In  order  to  achieve  an  optimum 
efficacy and tolerability profile, tablets containing 30 mg DMF were administered during the first three 
treatment weeks. During the subsequent 13 weeks (Week 4 until Week 16) the patients received up to 
3  x  2  visually  identical  tablets  each  containing  120  mg  DMF,  either  as  LAS41008  or  as  Fumaderm, 
leading to  a  maximum  of 720  mg/day,  or  matching placebo.  In  case  of  individual  intolerability  of the 
increased dosage the patient was to receive the last tolerated dose, which was then to be maintained 
until  the  end  of  the  treatment  period,  i.e.  individual  doses  were  applied.  During  the  first  week  of 
treatment  with  the  maintenance  dose  (week  4)  no  dose  reduction  was  possible.  If  treatment  success 
(patient  achieved  a  score  of  “clear”  =  0  or  ”almost  clear”  =  1  in  the  PGA  or  >90%  improvement  in 
PASI  from  baseline)  was  reached  before  administration  of  the  maximum  dose  of  720  mg/day,  no

further  dose  increase  was  necessary  and  the  dosage  was  to  be  steadily  reduced  to  an  individual 
maintenance dose. 
During the treatment period the patients visited the study centre at baseline (Day 1, Visit 1) and at 
Weeks 1 (Visit 2), 3 (Visit 3), 5 (Visit 4), 8 (Visit 5), 12 (Visit 6) and 16 (Visit 7). After the 16 week 
visit, treatment was stopped and the patients were to be followed up for a further 12 months including 
3 visits after 2, 6 and 12 months (F1, F2 and F3, respectively). In case of relapse and a need for new 
systemic therapy during the follow-up period, a final follow-up visit would be conducted prior to 
initiation of the therapy. 
The same dosing schedule as shown in table 10 was used in each treatment group. 
Table 10 – Dosing schedule 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of Study 1102 were:  
• 
• 
To demonstrate superiority of DMF gastro-resistant tablets vs. placebo based on the Psoriasis 
Area  Severity  Index  (PASI)  75  and  Physician’s  Global  Assessment  (PGA)  after  16  weeks  of 
treatment and  
To demonstrate non-inferiority of DMF gastro-resistant tablets to Fumaderm based on the PASI 
75. This was in accordance with the EMA guideline for the treatment for psoriasis. 
The secondary objectives were: 
•  Superiority  of  LAS41008  versus  placebo  based  on  changes  in  PASI,  PGA  after  3  and  8  weeks 
and body surface area (BSA) after 3, 8 and 16 weeks. 
•  Non-inferiority of LAS41008 compared to Fumaderm regarding PASI 75 after 3 and 8 weeks of 
treatment. 
•  Assessment of the safety of LAS41008 compared to Fumaderm and placebo for both treatment 
periods (30/120mg DMF). 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 41/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Assessment of the safety and efficacy of LAS41008 and Fumaderm when administered 
concomitantly with medicines known to have potential nephrotoxic effects, e.g. angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II inhibitors and statins. 
Outcomes/endpoints

Proportion  of  patients  achieving  a  score  of  “clear”  =  0  or  ”almost  clear”  =  1  in  the  PGA  at 
Week16 
Both these endpoints were tested to show superiority of LAS41008 over placebo but only PASI 75 was 
tested to show non-inferiority of LAS41008 versus Fumaderm. 
Secondary efficacy variables 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of patients achieving PASI 75 at Week 3 and 8 
Proportion of patients achieving PASI 50 and PASI 90 at Week 3, 8, and 16

Treatment success rate at Week 3, 8, and 16 
Treatment success was defined as patients achieving either a “clear” or “almost clear” score in 
the PGA and/or PASI 90. 
•  Remission rate at Week 3, 8, and 16 - Remission was defined as a score of “clear” in the PGA. 
• 
• 
• 
Time to relapse - Relapse was defined as the event when the achieved maximal improvement 
from  baseline  was  subsequently  reduced  by  ≥ 50%  based  on  PASI.  Two  time-to-relapse 
analyses  were  conducted:  a)  relapse  occurring  at  any  time  during  the  study  duration  (on-
treatment + 12 months off treatment [in the initial report only data up to F1 were available]) 
and b) relapse occurring within 2 months after last study drug intake. 
Time  to  rebound  -  Rebound  was  defined  as  a  worsening  of  psoriasis  over  baseline  value 
(PASI≥ 125%) 
Patient Benefit Index (PBI) based on the Patient Need Questionnaire (PNQ) and Patient Benefit 
Questionnaire (PBQ) at Week 16 and F1

Sample size 
The  multiple  primary  hypotheses  were  to  be  tested  each  on  a  5%  significance  level  based  on  the 
testing  procedure.  A  power  of  90%  was  required  in  the  sample  size  calculation.  The  ratio  between 
LAS41008 and placebo patients was 2:1. For PASI 75, a difference of 40% between LAS41008 versus 
placebo  was  assumed,  based  on  a  LAS41008  response  rate  of  50%  and  a  placebo  response  rate  of 
10%. This would have required a sample size of 44 patients for the LAS41008 and 22 patients for the 
placebo group. 
For the proportion of patients achieving a score of “clear” or ”almost clear” in the PGA, a difference of 
30% between LAS41008 versus placebo was assumed based on a LAS41008 response rate of 40% and 
a  placebo  response  rate  of  10%.  This  would  have  required  a  sample  size  of  70  patients  for  the 
LAS41008 and 35 patients for the placebo group. 
For  the  non-inferiority  for  LAS41008  compared  to  Fumaderm  regarding  PASI  75  after  16  weeks  of 
treatment a non-inferiority margin of 15% was set in line with the EMA Scientific Advice. This margin 
was  well  within  the  effect  size  compared  to  placebo  but  was  also  considered  a  reasonable  maximal 
difference  that  was  judged  to  be  not  clinically  relevant.  Based  on  a  proportion  of  patients  achieving 
PASI  75  of  50%  for  LAS41008,  an  expected  difference  to  Fumaderm  of  0,  a  power  of  90%  and  a 
significance level of 5%, this would have given a sample size of 234 patients per treatment group. 
A sample size of 234 + 234 + 117 (2:1 ratio between active and placebo groups) of 585 patients was 
necessary.  Based  on  an  estimated  drop-out  rate  of  15%  during  the  treatment  phase,  a  total  sample 
size of 690 patients was set. 
The assumptions for the effect size of the proportions achieving PASI75 and PGA of ‘clear; or ‘almost 
clear’ were based on literature research for Fumaderm.

Randomisation 
The randomization list was drawn up for 1400 patients by SynteractHCR using blocks of 5 and no 
stratification factors.  
Blinding (masking) 
Double-blind study. 
Statistical methods 
Primary endpoint  
One-sided  p-values  (for  further  use  in  the  adaptive  interim  analysis)  for  the  superiority  testing  were 
calculated.  The  decision  was  based  on  the  one-sided  p-values  for  superiority  at  Week  16  comparing 
LAS41008 and placebo.  
For  the  non-inferiority  testing,  one-sided  p-values  for  the  test  decision  were  calculated  comparing 
Fumaderm and LAS41008. 
Additional  descriptive  CIs  with  adjusted  confidence  level  were  calculated.  The  CIs  and  p-values  were 
calculated based on an asymptotic Wald test. 
A  hierarchical  approach  was  used  to  deal  with  multiple  comparisons.  The  non-inferiority  testing  for 
PASI  75  was  ordered  hierarchically  after  the  two  primary  superiority  endpoints,  i.e.,  only  if  both 
superiority comparisons led to a rejection of the null hypothesis (in the FAS and PPS population), non-
inferiority for PASI 75 was to be tested (a priori-order of hypotheses). As long as the first two primary 
hypotheses could be rejected, this non-inferiority testing could be done at a 5% significance level. 
This approach was combined and integrated into the adaptive design concept. The Bauer P. and Köhne 
method,  based  on  the  Fisher's  combination  test,  was  used  to  combine  the  results  of  each  of  the  two 
stages. The statistical significance threshold was set to 0.00380 according to this method. This was a 
conservative approach as no penalty was needed as no adaptation of sample size was done.  
Interim analysis 
An  interim  analysis  was  planned  after  data  from  at  least  1/3  of  the  690  subjects  (i.e.  230  evaluable 
subjects) were available for the two primary efficacy variables. 
It  was  agreed  to  include  all  patients  randomised  until  31  July  2013  into  the  interim  analysis 
(~240patients). The interim analysis was based on the PPS population as well as the FAS population. 
Prior  to  unblinding  by  the  independent  statistician  undertaking  the  interim  analysis,  a  data  review 
meeting was performed by the sponsor to classify patients into the various population subsets. 
Two possible outcomes were possible as a result of this interim analysis: 
a)  to  increase  the  sample  size  up  to  a  maximum  of  1160  patients  if  the  initial  sample  size  of  690 
patients was considered insufficient to meet the primary efficacy objectives (resulting p-values of the 
interim  between  0.0090  and  0.6).  By  contrast,  if  success  seemed  likely  even  with  a  smaller  sample 
size, no early termination at lower subject numbers was allowed in order to continue to collect safety 
data. 
b) to stop the study for futility if the (resulting p-values of the interim >0.6)

Adjusted confidence intervals and combined final analysis 
The following adjusted confidence intervals for descriptive purposes were used: 
1st stage: Two-sided confidence intervals at a 1-2*0.0090 = 0.982 (or 98.2%) confidence level 
2nd stage: Two-sided confidence intervals at a 95% confidence level 
Overall combined confidence intervals at a 1-2*0.00380 = 0.9924 (or 99.24%) confidence level 
It  should  be  noted  that  the  95%  CI  given  at  the  second  part  and  final  (first  and  second  parts 
combined) are for reference only and not decisional. 
One-sided p-values resulting from analysis of stage 1 and stage 2 are combined based on the Fisher's 
combination test as the product of both p-values and comparing this product with a significance level 
of 0.00380. The overall significance level by using this method is controlled and limited at 5%. 
Secondary endpoints: 
For the comparisons of proportions of patients with PASI 75 at Week 3 and 8 and PASI 50 and PASI 90 
at  Week  3,  8,  and  16  and  the  proportions  of  patients  with  a  score  of  “clear”  or  “almost  clear”  in  the 
PGA  at  Week  3  and  8,  two-sided  95%  CIs  for  the  differences  between  treatments  were  calculated. 
Corresponding one-sided p-values were also presented. The CIs and p-values were calculated based on 
an asymptotic Wald test for the risk difference. 
An ANCOVA using LOCF with factors treatment and centre and baseline as covariate was used to test 
differences between treatments for the percent change in PASI from baseline.  
The PGA score (LOCF) was compared between treatments using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. 
BSA  at  Week  3,  8  and  16  was  compared  between  treatments  using  an  Analysis  of  Covariance 
(ANCOVA) with factors treatment and centre and BSA at baseline as covariable. 
The treatment success and remission rates at Week 3, 8 and 16 were compared between treatments 
using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by centre. 
Time to rebound and time to relapse was based on the observed cases of PASI score. Time to relapse 
(since  first  intake  of  study  drug)  and  time  to  rebound  (since  stop  of  study  drug)  was  analysed  using 
Kaplan-Meier estimates. 
The  PBI  score  was  analysed  with  an  ANCOVA  model  including  treatment  and  centre  as  factors  and 
baseline values as covariate.

The decision whether or not a protocol deviation was relevant for the exclusion of patients from the per 
protocol  set  (PPS)  set  was  made  in  the  blind  data  review  meetings  (BDRM)  prior  to  the  interim  and 
final analyses.  
The  efficacy  analysis  was  based  on  the  full  analysis  set  (FAS)  and  the  PPS  with  both  being  of  equal 
importance. The safety analysis was based on the safety set (SAS). 
Missing values 
In  case  of  drop-outs,  for  all  efficacy  analyses  derived  from  PASI  and  PGA  assessments  the  last 
assessment  prior  to  withdrawal  was  carried  forward  for  the  subsequent  (missing)  assessments  (last 
observation- carried-forward [LOCF]). 
If  the  last  visit  (excluding  the  follow-up  visits)  was  done  more  than  7  days  after  last  intake,  then 
assessments for the primary efficacy parameters, PASI and PGA, from such visits were not used for the 
analysis  of  on-treatment  study  visits.  LOCF  up  to  Week  16  was  applied  using  the  last  on-treatment 
assessment or assessment where the visit took place ≤ 7 days after the last IMP intake. 
For the primary efficacy analysis of responders, an alternative approach for handling missing data was 
applied,  setting  patients  with  missing  examinations  as  non-responders  (sensitivity  analysis). 
Additionally, analyses of the total PASI score (continuous data) and the percent change from baseline 
and the PGA were performed based on observed cases. 
Analysis of other efficacy variables was done on observed cases approach, i.e., no imputation 
technique was applied for missing observations.

Outcomes and estimation 
An  interim  analysis  was  performed  after  data  for  the  two  primary  efficacy  variables  for  1/3  of  the 
planned 690 patients, i.e., 230 evaluable patients, was available in order to address the implications of 
continuing  with  the  original  sample  size  and  to  check  if  there  were  any  safety  concerns.  After 
consideration  of  this  interim  analysis,  the  decision  was  that  no  change  would  be  made.  This  period 
from study start to the time of the interim analysis is defined as stage 1 of the study.  
The  Data  Monitoring  Committee  suggested  increasing  the  sample  size  from  690  patients  up  to  1070 
patients. The recommendation was not implemented and the original sample size remained. In spite of 
not  conducting  any  adaptation  into  the  sample  size  the  threshold  for  statistical  significance  was 
penalised to be less or equal than 0.0038. 
After  the interim  analysis the  study  continued:  the period  comprising  the  remaining  treatment period 
up  to  Week  16  for  all  subjects  continuing  in  the  study  was  defined  as  stage  2.  Data  of  a  further  441 
patients was available for this stage.  
Results  of  the  primary  variables  for  the  individual  stages  are  provided  in  table  15.  Otherwise,  the 
following  results  derive  from  the  final  analyses  only,  i.e.  when  data  from  both  stages  have  been 
combined.

As the superiority of LAS41008 to placebo in both the proportion of patients achieving PASI 75 and the 
proportion  of  patients  achieving  a  score  of  “clear”  or  “almost  clear”  in  the  PGA  at  Week  16  was 
confirmed  in  the  FAS  and  PPS  populations,  in  a  second  step  the  non-inferiority  of  LAS41008  to 
Fumaderm  in  the  proportion  of  patients  achieving  PASI  75  at  Week  16  was  assessed  using  a  non-
inferiority margin of -15% (see Table below).

The treatment phase was completed by 450 of the 699 patients and 369 of these have entered into the 
follow-up phase. A total of 110 patients – that means only 24.4% of those who completed the 
treatment phase - completed the 1-year follow-up.  Common reasons given for premature study 
termination after completion of the treatment phase were lack of efficacy (numerically more frequent 
in the Fumaderm group compared to LAS41008; 32% vs. 25%), withdrawal of consent for personal 
reasons, and reasons within the category “other”.

Primary Objectives:  
The proportion of subjects achieving PASI 75 and the proportion of subjects 
achieving a score of “clear” or ”almost clear” in PGA (Physician’s Global 
Assessment) at Week 16 were tested to show superiority of Skilarence 
versus placebo.  
Further, PASI 75 was tested to show non-inferiority of Skilarence versus 
Fumaderm.

Nevertheless in both the test product and 
active control group individual doses were 
applied. The maximum dose was DMF 720 
mg/day. In case of intolerance reduction to 
the last tolerated dose and maintenance of 
this dose until week 16. In case of treatment 
success before DMF 720 mg (PGA “clear” or 
“almost clear”) → then no further increase 
and reduction to individual maintenance dose. 
In week 1 to 4 no dose reduction was 
possible.

The study had an adaptive two-stage design applying the Bauer and Köhne 
method allowing for sample size adjustment after stage 1. One-sided p-
values resulting from analysis of stage 1 and stage 2 were combined based 
on the Fisher's combination test as the product of both p-values and 
comparing this product with a significance level of 0.0038. The 99.24% 
Wald confidence intervals are provided for descriptive purposes and are not 
consistent with Fisher's combination test. 
The analyses based on the FAS and PP were considered of equal importance. 
Missing values were replaced by last observation carried forward (LOCF). 
The non-inferiority margin for the comparison of Skilarence (DMF) vs. 
Fumaderm was -15%.

Analyses of missing DLQI values were done using an observed cases 
approach, i.e., no imputation technique was applied for missing 
observations. In addition, as a post-hoc analysis for DLQI, 2 different 
methods for handling missing data were applied as sensitivity analyses 
(baseline observation carried forward [BOCF] and multiple imputation).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
There  is  only  one  pivotal  study  (study  1102)  evaluating  efficacy  and  safety  of  DMF  gastro-resistant 
tablets, as such no pooled analyses and meta-analysis were performed. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
There  are  no  clinical  studies  in  special  populations  (e.g.  elderly,  children)  and  no  discussion  in  this 
regard  has  been  presented  as  there  is  no  significant  data  in  special  populations  from  published 
literature as well. 
Supportive studies 
Placebo controlled studies with DMF 
Nieboer  1989,  study  III  –  is  a  double-blind,  16-week  study  that  assessed  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
DMF  240  mg/day  (22  patients)  with  placebo  (20  patients)  for  the  treatment  of  plaque  psoriasis 
(Nieboer, 1989, Study III). All patients in the DMF group were treated with capsules filled with 60 mg 
enteric coated granulate of DMF. The proportion of patients with improved psoriasis measured by PASI 
25 to 50 and PASI >50 scores was significantly greater in the DMF group (27% and 27%, respectively) 
compared with placebo (5% and 0%, respectively; p<0.01), and improvement started within 6 weeks 
of  treatment.  Two  of  3  patients  with  psoriatic  arthritis  also  reported  improvement.  Pre-existing  nail 
lesions were observed in 9 patients in the DMF group; an improvement was observed in 2 patients. 
Another study by the same author Nieboer (Nieboer, 1990) which was not a placebo controlled study 
but compared DMF to DMF/MEF, using a higher dose of 480 mg/day DMF in both groups. This study is 
an  active-controlled  study,  but  has  been  discussed  here  as  it  was useful  to  compare  and  present the 
results of the studies from the same author together. This study showed that roughly 50% of patients 
achieved  PASI  50  in  both  the  DMF  and  DMF/MEF  groups  (table  26),  which  was  higher  than  the 
response to DMF 240mg/day. There were no statistically significant differences between the DMF group 
(22 patients) and the DMF/MEF (87 mg calcium, 5 mg magnesium and 3 mg zinc) group (23 patients) 
in the proportion of patients with improved psoriasis from baseline to Week 16, measured by PASI <25 
(22%  vs.  4%,  respectively),  PASI  25-50  (14%  vs.  9%,  respectively),  and  PASI  >50  (45%  vs.  52%, 
respectively) (the p-value was not provided in the article).

Table 26 – Percentage improvement in PASI after Treatment with DMF or DMF/MEF (Nieboer studies) 
Placebo controlled studies with Fumaderm and/or other preparations containing DMF 
The  Altmeyer  (1994)  study  was  a  German  multicentre  randomized,  double-blind  study  conducted  in 
100  patients  with  psoriasis  (predominantly  male)  randomised  (1:1)  to  either  Fumaderm  or  placebo. 
Patients were treated with ascending doses of Fumaderm (30 mg in Week 1, 60 mg in Week 2, 120 mg 
in  Week  3,  up  to  a  maximum  of  720  mg  in  Week 16)  or  matching  placebo.  In  the  Fumaderm  group, 
the  reduction  in  PASI  score  from  baseline  (21.57)  to  Week  16  (10.77)  was  statistically  significant 
compared with placebo (approximately 24 at baseline to approximately 23 at endpoint; p<0.0001). A 
significant improvement in clinical symptoms of arthralgia was observed in the Fumaderm group by the 
end  of  the  study  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (p<0.002);  however,  no  statistically  significant 
differences were observed between treatment groups for changes in nail deformities

The  Nugteren-Huying  (1990)  study  was  conducted  in  39  patients  randomised  to  a  non-specified 
DMF/MEF combination (120 mg DMF, 87 mg calcium MEF, 5 mg magnesium MEF and 3 mg zinc MEF) 
or an octyl hydrogen fumarate (OHF)/MEF combination (284 mg OHF, 5 mg magnesium MEF, and 3 mg 
zinc  MEF)  or  placebo.  However  the  dose  of  DMF  evaluated  is  not  in  line  with  the  proposed  dose. 
Further  a  comparison  of  the  proposed  formulation  to  the  formulation  studied  is  not  available.  The 
number of patients randomised to each arm was not reported. Of the 34 patients who completed the 
study, the mean percentage of the BSA with psoriasis was reduced in the DMF/MEF group from 21% at 
baseline  to  6.7%  at  Week  16;  this  effect  was  significantly  larger  than  the  reductions  obtained  in  the 
other  treatment  groups  (p<0.01).  At  Week  16,  the  mean  scores  for  infiltration  and  scaling  were 
significantly  lower  in  patients  in  the  DMF/MEF  group  compared  with  the  other  treatment  groups 
(p<0.01). Complete clearance was achieved in 6 DMF/MEF-treated patients and 3 patients showed an 
improvement,  whereas  no  placebo  or  OHF/MEF  patients  had  complete  clearance,  and  only  1  placebo 
patient showed improvement 
Active comparator controlled studies with DMF or other DMF-containing preparations 
In  the  Kolbach  (Kolbach,  1992)  2-year,  non-randomised  study  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
DMF monotherapy (240 mg/day, 129 patients) with Fumaderm (480 mg/day, 67 patients), PASI >75 
was  achieved  in  48%  of  the  Fumaderm  patients  and  32%  of  DMF  patients  after  3  to  6  months  of 
treatment.  The  percentage  of  responders  declined  to  18%  in  the  DMF  group  after  24  months  but 
remained  about  the  same  in  the  Fumaderm  group  (46%).  These  differences  were  statistically 
significant.  The  first  signs  of  improvement  were  noted  after  3  weeks.  Improvement  of  nail  dystrophy 
occurred  in  about  half  the  patients  after  several  months  of  therapy.  A  decrease  in  arthralgias  was 
noted in 27% of the DMF group and 50% of the Fumaderm group.

Table 29 – Results of treatment with DMFAE or FAC per observation after 3 months 
Table 30 – Data of patients treated with DMFAE (n=129) and FAC therapy (n=67) 
In  the  Fallah  Arani  (2011)  study,  Sixty  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  psoriasis  vulgaris  were 
randomly assigned to treatment for 16 weeks with either methotrexate (30 patients; 15 mg per week) 
or  fumarates  (30  patients;  30  mg,  followed  by  120  mg  according  to  a  standard  progressive  dosage 
regimen) and were followed up for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint with respect to the efficacy was the 
difference in mean change from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) after 12 weeks of 
treatment.  There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  DMF/MEF  group  and  MTX 
groups for the change in PASI score from baseline to Week 12 or the proportion of patients with PASI 
≥ 50,  PASI  ≥ 75  or  PASI  ≥ 90  from  baseline  to  Week  12.  A  total  of  24  patients  (89%)  treated  with 
DMF/MEF and all MTX patients reported AEs during the study. More DMF/MEF patients (48%) than MTX 
patients  (7%)  reported  flushing,  while  more  MTX  patients  (26%)  than  DMF/MEF  patients  (4%) 
reported  influenza-like  symptoms.  Four  (15%)  MTX  patients  had  to  stop  treatment  due  to  highly 
elevated liver enzymes (200-300% over baseline), which returned to normal within 4 to 8 weeks after 
stopping treatment.

Gollnick (2002) reported a prospective, randomised, double-blind, 13-week, multicentre (Germany and 
the  Netherlands)  study  assessing  Fumaderm  treatment  (up  to  1075  mg/day)  with  or  without 
calcipotriol  ointment  in  134  patients  with  severe  psoriasis.  In  both  treatment  groups  the  PASI  was 
lower at the end of treatment compared with baseline. The mean percentage change in PASI (adjusted 
for  the  effect  of  centre  and  baseline  PASI)  was  -76.1%  in  the  combination  group  and  -51.9%  in  the 
group  with  Fumaderm  alone  (p<0.001  for  the  difference  between  groups).  While  both  treatment 
groups improved based on the investigators’ assessment and the patient’s assessments at the end of 
treatment,  the  results  showed  that  Fumaderm  plus  calcipotriol  had  a  more  favourable  effect  than 
Fumaderm alone (p≤ 0.001 for the difference between groups). 
Figure 9 – Percentage change in PASI at each visit (ITT population) 
Persistence of efficacy and/or tolerance effects 
There  is  no  evidence  of  tolerance  and/or  reduction  in  the  effect  achieved  with  DMF  gastro-resistant 
tablets over 16 weeks of treatment in Study 1102, nor in any of the published long-term studies with 
FAEs. The percentage reduction in PASI total score over time that was achieved during the 16 weeks of 
treatment with DMF in Study 1102 persisted after stopping treatment for a further 8 weeks of follow-
up  (Figure  2.7.3-3).  Published  reports  confirmed  the  ability  of  FAEs  to  achieve  and  maintain  the 
beneficial effects for up to 5 years of treatment, by looking at clinical assessments, reductions in PASI, 
and  improvements  in  PGA  and/or  BSA  (Kolbach,  1992;  Thio,  1995;  Lijnen,  2015;  Raschka,  1999; 
Thaçi,  2013;  Reich,  2009;  Brewer,  2007;  Fika,  2006;  Harries,  2005).  In  addition,  some  of  the 
retrospective  studies  reported  on  patients  who  had  been  refractory  to  previous  anti-psoriatic 
treatments  and  who  achieved  full  clearance  of  their  psoriasis  with  FAE  treatment  that  persisted  over 
years  of  continuous  treatment  (Fika,  2006;  Harries,  2005).  The  brief  overview  of  published  studies 
providing long-term efficacy data is provided below.

In  fact,  the  published  literature  provides  data that  indicate  sufficient  treatment  duration  is  needed to 
achieve  the  full  effect  of  DMF  treatment.  The  Kolbach  (1992),  Brewer  (2007),  and  Harries  (2005) 
papers  reported  that  an  initial  response  became  apparent  after  between  3  weeks  and  3  months. 
However,  several  studies  have  reported  that  the  efficacy  continues  to  improve  over  time.  After  an 
initial  response,  Harries  (2005)  reported  a  mean  time  to  clearance  of  15.2  weeks.  Boesken  (1998) 
reported that the skin status improved from grade 6 for all patients to grade 2.5 within 3 months and 
to  grade  1.8  after  6  months.  The  Lijnen  (2015)  paper  reports  that  patients  had  achieved  sufficient 
effect  and  established  a  maintenance  dose  after  8  months  of  treatment  with  DMF  monotherapy.  The 
Inzinger  (2013),  Reich  (2009),  and  the  Kolbach  (1992)  studies  show  that  the  proportion  of  patients 
achieving PASI 75/PASI 90 or a PGA score of markedly improved or clear peaked only after 12 months 
and persisted with long-term treatment. 
Data  on  the  incidence  of  relapse  and  rebound  up  to  the  F1  follow-up  visit,  2  months  after  stopping 
treatment  showed  that  the  DMF  gastro-resistant  tablets  group  had  a  similar  incidence  of  either  a 
relapse  (10.1%)  or  a  rebound  (1.1%)  to  that  of  the  Fumaderm  group  (relapse:  12.5%,  rebound: 
2.2%)  and  the  incidence  in  both  active  treatment  groups  was  much  less  that  that  with  placebo 
(relapse: 27.5%, rebound: 9.3%). The percent change in PASI total score in study 1102 is depicted in 
the below diagram. Additional follow-up data for up to one year showed a similar trend with substantial 
efficacy retained up to 12 months follow-up off-treatment (treatment stopped-week16); however this 
should be interpreted with caution as only a small proportion (around 24%) of patients completed one 
year follow-up.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This application is supported by a single pivotal study. 
The  dosing  regimen  in  both  the  LAS41008  and  Fumaderm  arms  was  identical  and  in  line  with  the 
approved dose of Fumaderm and included a dose-titration phase to improve tolerability. The maximum 
dose  allowed  was  720mg/day  of  DMF  for  both  active  treatments.  There  are  no  dose-finding  studies 
conducted  by  the  applicant.  The  dose  regimen  of  Fumaderm  appears  to  be  empirical  and  there  is 
sufficient evidence from literature to support the proposed starting dose, maximum daily dose and the 
weekly  dose-escalating  regimen.  Nevertheless,  as  according  to  in  vitro  and  clinical  data  the  main 
antipsoriatic  activity  is  driven  by  DMF,  LAS41008  and  Fumaderm  have  the  same  content  of  DMF  and 
the pivotal study compares LAS41008 to Fumaderm, a dose-finding study is not considered necessary.    
The  study  design  is  appropriate  for  the  objectives.  It  is  generally  in  line  with  the  CHMP  guideline  on 
psoriasis and is in line with the design agreed in the Scientific Advice procedures. Although Fumaderm 
is  only  approved  in  Germany  and  not  as  widely  used  as  other  authorised  systemic  therapies  like 
methotrexate,  ciclosporin  and  retinoids,  the  choice  of  the  active  comparator  is  understood  and 
accepted as the objective is to establish a bridge to the existing literature with Fumaderm to support 
extrapolation  of  certain  aspects  of  this  evidence.  The  proposed  treatment  duration  of  16  weeks  is 
adequate for demonstration and comparison of efficacy.

The  study  was  in  moderate  to  severe  psoriasis  with  minimum  criteria  for  baseline  severity  based  on 
PASI,  PGA  and  BSA.  The  study  excluded  patients  with  significant  gastrointestinal  problems,  active 
infectious disease, immunosuppression, severe liver or kidney disease, haematological abnormality and 
if on systemic treatment without adequate washout. While these are appropriate in terms of avoiding 
confounding  of  the  findings  due  to  the  known  safety  profile  of  DMF,  the  applicant  has  appropriately 
reflected the available information from literature in the SmPC.  
The study sample size for demonstration of superiority was around 175, however to fulfil the objective 
of  demonstrating  non-inferiority,  the  study  planned  to  include  a  far  greater  sample  size  of  690 
patients. 
The efficacy analyses based on the full analysis set (FAS) including all patients with at least one post-
baseline measurement of PASI, PGA and the per protocol set (PPS) excluding major protocol violators 
were considered of equal importance. Discontinuation of study was not considered a protocol violation. 
A  completer  analysis  for  the  primary  endpoints  as  an  additional  sensitivity  analysis  was  provided 
during the procedure. 
The  co-primary  efficacy  variables  (the  proportion  of  patients  achieving  PASI  75  at  Week  16  and  the 
proportion  of  patients  achieving  a  score  of  “clear”  or  “almost  clear”  in  the  PGA  at  Week  16)  were 
analysed using the Wald test for risk differences (difference in the proportion of responders). The study 
had  a  two-stage  adaptive  design  applying  the  Bauer  and  Köhne  method  with  two  stages  allowing  for 
sample  size  adjustment  after  stage  1.  The  Bauer  and  Köhne  method  controls  the  type  1  error 
adequately  taking  the  two-stage  design  into  account.  Further,  confidence  intervals  taking  the  two-
stage  design  into  account  consistent  with  the  Bauer-Köhne  method  were  provided  during  the 
procedure. 
Superiority of DMF vs. placebo in both co-primary endpoints and non-inferiority of DMF vs. Fumaderm 
in PASI 75 were the primary comparisons (only if both superiority comparisons led to a rejection of the 
null hypothesis (in the FAS and PPS population), non-inferiority for PASI 75 was to be tested). For the 
non-inferiority  of  DMF  compared  with  Fumaderm  for  PASI  75  after  16  weeks  of  treatment,  a  non-
inferiority  margin  of  15%  was  set  in  line  with  EMA/CHMP  Scientific  Advice.  A  similar  non-inferiority 
margin was used for PGA.  
As substantial drop-out was observed, Kaplan-Meier plots of time to drop-out by treatment arm were 
provided during the procedure to support assessment of the influence of missing data on the results. 
Last observation carried forward (LOCF) up to Week 16 was used for missing data from PASI and PGA 
assessments. For the primary efficacy endpoints, a sensitivity analysis was performed setting patients 
with missing data as non-responders,  which  yielded  similar  results  as  the  analysis  using  the  LOCF 
method.  As  considering  drop-outs  as  non-responders  does  not  assume  benefit  from  treatment  after 
treatment  discontinuation  and  most  drop-outs  for  DMF  and  Fumaderm  were  due  to  adverse  events, 
which  probably  reflect  clinical  reality,  considering  drop-outs  as  non-responders  is  probably  most 
adequate both for superiority and NI analysis.   
Missing values for the secondary endpoint DLQI were not replaced in the statistical analysis, however, 
for the dropouts the DLQI values reported at Week 16 represent the data obtained from the last visit. 
A  sensitivity  analysis  where  DLQI  values  for  all  patients  who  discontinued  treatment  before  week  16 
was replaced by BOCF was submitted during the procedure. In addition, a placebo multiple imputation 
analysis was also submitted.  
The  randomisation  was  not  stratified  by  centre  and there  is  no  requirement to  adjust the  analysis  by 
centre  either,  particularly  if  the  number  of  subjects  per  centre  is  quite  small.  The  applicant  also 
submitted the analyses for absolute and percent change in PASI and for DLQI scores without adjusting 
for centre.

Overall, the statistical analyses were conducted in the following data sets with the Full analysis set pre-
designated as the primary analysis.  
Table 33 – Analysis sets 
Although  a  number  of  published  studies  with  DMF  containing  formulations  including  Fumaderm  were 
submitted,  these  studies  were  varied  in  design  and  many  of  these  studies  did  not  have  all  the 
information  that  is  needed  to  do  a  robust  assessment.  Many  of  these  studies  were  uncontrolled  or 
open-labelled  or  retrospective  observational  studies  which  cannot  provide  pivotal  evidence  in  support 
of the proposed DMF formulation. Only two studies Altmeyer 1994 and Gollnick 2002 were randomized, 
double  blind  controlled  studies.  While  Altmeyer  1994  was  a  placebo  controlled  study,  Gollnick  2002 
compared Fumaderm monotherapy against a combination treatment of Fumaderm+calcipitriol. Further 
the Gollnick 2002 study did not have a placebo arm and allowed higher than the proposed maximum of 
720mg/day.  
Although these studies have been selected for discussion under main studies, these published studies 
do not have sufficient details and the study designs are not adequately robust to provide pivotal data 
on efficacy. While these limitations of published studies are acknowledged, it is also recognised that a 
number of studies by different investigators, across different centres and over the years are available 
to support the efficacy of fumarates in psoriasis. Therefore, these are considered as useful supportive 
studies for replication of results, extent of clinical experience, evidence of maintenance of efficacy at 
relevant dose-range in a wider patient population. In conclusion, the overall evidence on efficacy is 
deemed adequate particularly for a known active substance, especially as the single pivotal study is 
adequately large to provide compelling evidence of superiority in efficacy over placebo. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  overall  treatment  discontinuation  rate  was  around  36%  which  is  higher  than  the  15%  planned 
during the sample size estimation, which is a concern particularly for the non-inferiority comparison to 
Fumaderm.  Although  the  overall  rate  of  patients  completing  the  treatment  is  lower  (63.1%)  in  the 
LAS41008  as  compared  to  placebo  (71.5%),  this  is  comparable  to  the  completion  rate  in  the  active 
control,  Fumaderm  arm  (62.2%).  The  main  reasons  for  discontinuation  in  the  active  treatment  arms 
were adverse events and in the placebo arm it was lack of efficacy. The baseline characteristics in the 
three treatment arms appeared to be balanced.  
Co-Primary Endpoints 
All  3  primary  objectives  of  the  pivotal  study  in  moderate to  severe  chronic  plaques  psoriasis  at  week 
16  were  met.  The  study  demonstrated  that  Skilarence  (DMF)  is  statistically  significant  superior  to 
placebo  in  regard  to  PASI  75  responders  (37.5%  vs.  15.3%)  and  clear/almost  clear  PGA  responders 
(33.0%  vs.  13.0%).  Additionally,  it  was  demonstrated  that  Skilarence  (DMF)  is  non-inferior  to 
Fumaderm  (DMF/MEF)  according  to  the  pre-specified  non-inferiority  margin,  in  the  proportion  of 
patients achieving PASI 75 at Week 16 (37.5% vs. 40.3%). In a post-hoc comparison of PGA response 
Assessment report

between Skilarence (DMF) and Fumaderm (33.0% vs. 37.4% (FAS)), the lower limit of the one-sided 
97.5% CI for the difference was at the size of -13% (FAS) and -16% (PP).  
For the comparison of PASI75 responders against placebo the 99.24% CI (10.7, 33.7) and the p-value 
(<0.0001) provided convincing evidence of superiority. For the comparison of PGA against placebo the 
99.24%  CI  (9.0,  31)  and  the  p-value  (<0.0001)  provided  convincing  evidence  of  superiority.  These 
results were consistently seen in the FAS, SAS and PPS with two different approaches for missing data 
(designated as LOCF or non-responders). The observed risk difference between LAS41008 and placebo 
is  22.2.  This  is  much  lower  than  the  risk  difference  of  40  that  was  anticipated  in  the  sample  size 
calculation  which  was  based  on  review  of  literature  of  the  efficacy  of  Fumaderm.  Although  formally 
non-inferiority can be claimed based on the pre-specified margins, this may not be considered robust 
given  the  lower  than  anticipated  effect  size.  However  for  this  full  mixed  application,  where  the 
evidence  of  short-term  efficacy  of  Skilarence  is  convincingly  demonstrated  in  comparison  to  placebo 
and  where  the  non-inferiority  comparison  is  to  bridge  to  the  information  from  Fumaderm  for  aspects 
like maintenance of efficacy and long term safety, this level of comparability is considered adequate. It 
is agreed that the evidence from literature on Fumaderm is relevant for this product.  
The  inferences  drawn  on  the  primary  endpoints  were  generally  supported  by  the  results  in  the 
secondary  endpoints of  change  in  PASI  75  and  PGA  at  week  3  and  8  as  well as  assessments  on  BSA 
and  DLQI  with  one  exception.  A  slight  numerical  advantage  of  Fumaderm  compared  to  LAS41008  in 
the  primary  and  most  secondary  efficacy  parameters  is  noted,  whereas  the  change  from  baseline  in 
the affected BSA was more favourable in Skilarence, and mean PASI and Patient Benefit Index at week 
16  were  identical  in  both  active  treatment  groups.  However  the  applicant  attributes  this  to  the 
subjective  nature  of  the  scales  and  justifies  that  this  is  within  the  normal  range  of  variability  for  this 
scale.  This  efficacy  is  much  lower  than  the  efficacy  reported  with  biological  agents  where  PASI75 
responses  of  up  to  80%  have  been  reported.  Further  the  biological  agents  are  supported  by  larger 
clinical database of good quality. Nevertheless the demonstrated efficacy of DMF is considered clinically 
meaningful. The results of study 1102 are adequate in themselves for inferring the short-term efficacy 
of the proposed DMF product without replication of evidence, particularly in the context of the existing 
knowledge of the efficacy of DMF containing products from published literature.   
For  the  non-inferiority  comparison  between  LAS41008  and  Fumaderm,  the  difference  in  proportion  of 
patients  achieving  PASI  75  was  -2.8  (99.24%  CI  -14.0.  8.4;  p-value  -0.0003)  with  the  lower limit of 
the  confidence  interval  within  the  pre-specified  non-inferiority  limit  of  15%.  Given  the  absolute 
difference  in  proportion  of  responders  by  PASI  75  between  LAS41008  and  placebo  was  22.2%,  the 
non-inferiority margin of 15% in this parameter (which constitutes 68% of the response) may not be 
appropriate.  Nevertheless,  it  is  agreed  that  this  demonstrates  sufficient  comparability  to  support 
bridging to the evidence from literature on Fumaderm. This is probably due to the less than anticipated 
effect  size  [anticipated  a  benefit  of  40%  over  placebo  on  PASI  75  while  the  observed  benefit  was 
22.2%  over  placebo]  and  the  decision  of  not  accepting  the  recommendation  to  increase  the  sample 
size from 690 to more than 1000 patients based on the results at the interim analysis.  
Overall the results from study 1102 can be accepted to demonstrate a convincing evidence of superior 
efficacy  of  LAS41008  as  compared  to  placebo  and  a  comparable  efficacy  to  Fumaderm.  Further 
sufficient comparability in terms of efficacy has been demonstrated between Skilarence and Fumaderm 
to contribute to the bridging to the evidence from literature on Fumaderm.  
The  follow-up  of  2  months  after  stopping  treatment  showed  that  the  rebound  or  loss  of  treatment 
response  was  lower  in  the  treatment  arms  as  compared  to placebo.  Further  follow-up  visits  until one 
year also demonstrated that considerable maintenance of effects was retained for this follow-up period, 
nevertheless  these  results  have  to  be  interpreted  with  caution  due  to  substantial  drop-out  and 
replacement of missing values by LOCF.

Despite the individual short-comings with the published studies, collectively these studies with different 
formulations  containing  DMF  (but  mainly  including  Fumaderm),  conducted  by  different  investigators 
across  different  centres/countries  across  time,  consistently  have  reported  significantly  better  efficacy 
as  compared  to  placebo  or  clinically  significant  improvement  from  baseline.  Around  28  published 
studies have evaluated the efficacy of DMF containing products in nearly 2700 psoriasis patients which 
is substantial. Many of these studies followed up patients for beyond 12 months and it was seen that 
there was no tolerance or loss in efficacy with long-term treatment. Some studies even demonstrated 
that the peak effects of treatments can take up to 12 months thus supporting the efficacy of long-term 
treatment.  
The  evidence  to  bridge  the  data  (efficacy  and  safety)  from  Fumaderm  to  this  product  is  based  on 
comparability  of  quantitative  composition  of  DMF  coupled  with  relative  bioavailability  studies  and  the 
pivotal  study  comparing  Skilarence  to  Fumaderm  showing  non-inferiority/comparability.  Given  this 
strength  of  evidence  to  bridge  between  Skilarence  and  Fumaderm  it  is  accepted  that  the  literature 
evidence on efficacy and safety of Fumaderm is highly relevant and supportive for Skilarence.  
Despite  the  number  of  years  of  clinical  use,  the  acceptability  of  the  use  of  DMF  containing  products 
with concomitant medications or co-morbidities have not been well documented in literature. However 
the absence of significant safety concerns with long-term clinical use offers indirect reassurance. Given 
this situation, the applicant has clearly described the limitations of the data in the SmPC and provided 
appropriate cautionary advice.  
A  total  of  28  patients  aged  ≥65  years  were  included  in  the  pivotal  study.  The  efficacy  of  LAS41008 
seen  in  the  study’s  main  analysis  was  also  demonstrated  in  the  elderly  subpopulation.  Statistically 
significant  superiority  was  shown  for  LAS41008  vs.  placebo,  as  well  as  a  comparable  effect  in  the 
elderly (PASI 75 response in 38.5% resp. 33.3% of the elderly). 
In study 1102, a follow-up visit two months after stop of treatment showed the treatment effects to be 
maintained as assessed by PASI and PGA. Additional follow-up data at 6 months and 12 months after 
stopping treatment at 16 weeks, showed the benefits were substantially maintained. Nevertheless the 
results  have  to  be  interpreted  with  caution  due  to  substantial  drop  out  during  the  follow  up 
phase. A significantly greater mean percentage change from baseline in PASI was observed in the 
Skilarence  compared  to  the  placebo  group  at  week  16  (-50.8  vs.  -27.0)  and  at  the  2  months 
follow-up visit (-48.5 vs. -27.5).  
Thus,  results  of  the  follow-up  have  to  be  interpreted  with  caution  due  to  substantial  drop-out  and 
replacement of missing values by LOCF for the most of the analyses. However, as deterioration during 
the  follow-up  without  treatment  appears  plausible,  LOCF  may  lead  to  imputation  of  too  optimistic 
values,  particularly  for  active  treatment  arms  where  larger  improvements  than  under  placebo  were 
observed during the treatment phase. Therefore, deterioration may be larger for active treatment such 
that the difference between active treatments and placebo after 12 months follow-up may have been 
overestimated. 
The  percentage  of  patients  with  a  PGA  “clear”  or  “almost  clear”  was  significantly  greater  in  the 
Skilarence  compared  to  the  placebo  group  at  week  16  (33%  vs.  13%)  and  at  the  2  months 
follow-up  visit  (27%  vs.  15,3%).  Both  the  mean  percentage  change  in  PASI  and  the  percentage 
of  patients  with  a  PGA  “clear”  or  “almost  clear”  at  each  of  these  visits  was  numerically  slightly 
greater with Fumaderm compared to Skilarence (non-significant). 
In  general,  for  the  long-term  maintenance  of  treatment  effects,  placebo  controlled  direct  comparison 
data is not needed. Usually single arm open-label extension studies with long term treatment showing 
maintenance of efficacy observed at the end of controlled phase is considered sufficient. In this dossier 
although  there  is  no  long-term  data  with  the  proposed  formulation  beyond  16  weeks,  the  active

substance is DMF and the long-term efficacy of DMF/MEF as well DMF is clearly supported by published 
literature.  There  are  several  studies  with  DMF/MEF  covering  treatment  duration  of  up  to  24  months, 
some  studies  even  cover  longer  treatment  duration.  The  studies  indicated  maintenance  of  treatment 
effects during long-term treatment with acceptable tolerability and there were no signs of development 
of  tolerance  to  benefits.  Moreover,  some  of  them  evaluated  effects  over  several  years  and  they 
indicated that with long-term treatment an increase of the effect can be anticipated beyond treatment 
duration of 3 months and peak of the effect is anticipated after 12 months of treatment (e.g. Thaci et 
al., 2013). Given that the proposed product also contains DMF in the same quantities as in Fumaderm 
and has shown comparable systemic exposures when administered in the fed state (particularly at the 
120mg  dose  strength)  which  taken  in  consideration  with  the  evidence  from  study  1102  showing 
comparable short-term efficacy, it is considered reasonable to extrapolate the long-term maintenance 
of treatment effects seen with different DMF containing formulations to the proposed DMF formulation. 
Moreover,  the  open-label  study  by  Linjen  et  al,  2016,  investigated  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of 
DMF  monotherapy.  Median  treatment  duration  was  28  months.  DMF  monotherapy  reduced  PGA  from 
3.3/5 to 1.6/5 in 122 patients (69%) that reached the median maintenance dose of 480 mg/day after 
a median of 8 months.  
Therefore,  it  is  agreed  that  the  proposed  formulation  can  be  expected  to  maintain  the  treatment 
benefits seen at 16 weeks in the patients if treated over the long term of up to 24 months. From the 
clinical study 1102, it is seen that the majority of the patients who completed the treatment phase of 
week 16 were on the maximum dose of 720 mg (72.5% for LAS41008 and 71.02% for Fumaderm). A 
detailed  analysis  of  the  doses  used  in  both  the  treatment  arms  shows  that  these  were  comparable, 
providing support for the extrapolation of efficacy and safety from Fumaderm to Skilarence. 
There is a lack of direct comparator data with other first-line systemic therapies, with only one small 
study comparing Fumaderm to methotrexate available from the literature. In addition, there is a high 
rate of treatment discontinuations (36% in study 1102 and exceeding 40% in published studies) with 
Fumaderm and lack of substantial evidence from studies of high quality to compare against other more 
widely established first line systemic therapies of psoriasis. In this context, the proposed indication 
which implies a first line systemic therapy for Skilarence was questioned. However from the applicant’s 
justification, it is seen that Fumaderm is widely used in the first line systemic therapy of psoriasis in 
Germany, where it is authorised. Importantly, the European treatment guidelines also recommend the 
use of fumarates in first line systemic therapy. The predominant evidence of efficacy and safety for the 
use of Fumaderm in published literature and in study 1102 is also in patients receiving first line 
systemic therapy. Further the data on the efficacy of DMF containing products in patients who were 
treatment resistant to other systemic therapies is not available. Taking in to consideration these 
factors, a first line systemic therapy for Skilarence is agreed. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In  the  pivotal  study  1102,  LAS41008  has  convincingly  demonstrated  superior efficacy  to  placebo  and 
similar but  numerically  slightly  lower  efficacy  than  the  active  comparator,  Fumaderm.  The  superiority 
over  placebo  was  with  very  significant  p-values  <0.0001.  The  secondary  endpoints  also  indicated 
superiority  of  LAS41008  over  placebo.  The  superiority  of  LAS41008  to  placebo  in  various  sub-group 
analyses  was  also  significant,  as  the  study  sample  size  was  based  on  the  objective  of  demonstrating 
non-inferiority  to  Fumaderm,  which  resulted  in  a  large  study  for  the  comparison  against  placebo. 
Taking  all  this  into  account  the  results  are  compelling  enough  to  be  acceptable  as  a  single  pivotal 
study.

A  formal  conclusion  of  non-inferiority  of  the  proposed  DMF  formulation  to  Fumaderm  was 
demonstrated.  However,  considering  the  observed  effect  size  a  strict  non-inferiority  cannot  be 
concluded. Nevertheless it is agreed that adequate comparability of efficacy has been demonstrated to 
support bridging to the evidence from literature on Fumaderm. The evidence to support comparability 
includes a) the equal quantities of DMF in both Fumaderm and Skilarence b) relative bioavailability and 
c)  comparable  efficacy  and  safety  seen  in  study  1102.  Therefore,  it  is  agreed  that  the  evidence  of 
efficacy  and  safety  of  Fumaderm  in  the  published  literature  is  highly  relevant  and  supportive  of  the 
efficacy and safety of Skilarence. 
This is especially so as the dosing in both treatment arms were not fixed equal doses but were titrated 
based on tolerability and response but nevertheless was comparable in both treatment arms. Further it 
was seen that the majority of the patients in the two treatment arms were on the maximum dose of 
720mg/day  by  week  16,  which  provides  adequate  support  for  the  upper  end  of  the  proposed  dosing 
regimen. 
Taking in to consideration the established information on the active substance - DMF, the comparable 
exposure and efficacy to Fumaderm and the supporting literature on the long-term efficacy from other 
DMF  containing  products,  it  is  reasonable  to  infer  that  the  demonstrated  efficacy  at  16  weeks  of 
treatment  in  study  1102  would  be  maintained  in  patients  on  long-term  treatment.  Further  in  study 
1102,  16  weeks  of  treatment  were  followed  by  a  period  of  12  months  without  treatment  in  order  to 
asses  relapse,  rebound  and  maintenance  of  effects.  It  was  seen  that  a  considerable  extent  of  the 
treatment  effects  are  retained  during  this  extended  off-treatment  follow-up  period;  however  these 
results have to be interpreted with caution as there were a number of drop-outs.  
An  indication  in  the  first  line  systemic  therapy  for  psoriasis  is  adequately  justified  by  the  evidence  of 
efficacy,  the  fact  that  Fumaderm  is  approved  as  first  line  systemic  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe 
psoriasis in Germany and the use of fumarates are established in first line systemic therapy in clinical 
practice.  Further  support  is  provided  by  the  recommendation  of  European  S3-gudeline  on  psoriasis 
where DMF containing products are recommended for first line systemic therapy for both induction and 
long-term  treatment.  More  importantly,  the  pivotal  study  was  pre-dominantly  in  systemic  therapy 
naïve patients. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The data which provide the basis for the safety assessment of DMF gastro-resistant tablets in this 
clinical development programme are derived from 4 clinical studies with DMF (3 Phase I studies [Study 
1103, Study 1104 and Study 08] and 1 pivotal Phase III study [Study 1102]) and 52 published studies 
and case reports in patients with psoriasis. 
Patient exposure 
A  total  of  3659  patients  and  56  healthy  subjects  were  treated  with  FAEs  (DMF  alone  and  DMF/MEF 
combinations including Fumaderm) in the 4 clinical studies and 56 published studies and case reports 
presented  in  this  dossier:  562  in  the  pivotal  Study  1102  (Table  34);  56  healthy  subjects  in  the  PK 
Studies 1103, 1104, and 08; and 3097 patients in the published articles.

Table 34 – Extent of Exposure in study 1102 (SAS) 
The overall safety population in the published literature comprised subjects aged ≥ 11 years, who were 
healthy or who had a medical history of psoriasis (mild, moderate or severe). The population available 
for the assessment of safety from the published literature was broader than the target population. In 
the prospective controlled and uncontrolled studies in patients with psoriasis, patients were exposed to 
study treatment up to 6 years. In retrospective studies, exposure data are available for up to 14 years 
of treatment. 
In  addition,  there  is  a  considerable  clinical  experience  with  Fumaderm  (>  5  million  packs  sold  in  the 
last 15 years). 
However, the number of patients exposed to the proposed formulation alone is small and includes 279 
patients exposed with 189 exposed for 3 months or more. 
Adverse events 
In  Study  1102,  more  patients  reported  any  TEAEs  in  the  DMF  gastro-resistant  tablets  (83.9%)  and 
Fumaderm (84.1%) groups compared with the placebo group (59.9%).

Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 77/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The majority of TEAEs were of mild to moderate intensity. A TEAE of severe intensity was reported by 
15.1% of DMF gastro-resistant tablets patients and 12.0% of Fumaderm patients, compared to 7.3% 
of placebo patients.  
Related Treatment Emergent Adverse Events 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  related  TEAEs  was  also  higher  in  the  DMF  gastro-resistant  tablets 
(73.8%)  and  Fumaderm  (73.9%)  groups  compared  to  placebo  (40.1%);  again,  this  was  mainly 
attributable to gastrointestinal disorders. 
The percentage of related TEAEs to the investigational product as per investigator judgment that were 
reported in at least 2% of patients by SOC and PT is presented in Table 36. 
Table 36 – Related treatment-emergent adverse events in ≥2% (in any treatment group) of patients by 
system organ class and preferred term in study 1102 
Published studies 
There were 5 prospective controlled studies that reported on overall incidence of AEs in which patients 
were  treated  for  between  12  and  16  weeks.  The  incidence  of  patients  with  any  AE  was  similar  in  all 
groups  treated  with  DMF/MEF  or  Fumaderm,  which  was  higher  than  in  patients  treated  with  placebo 
and lower than patients treated with MTX (Table 37).

Table 37 - Summary of adverse events in prospective controlled published studies in psoriasis 
In general, the relationship of the AE to the investigational product was not reported in the published 
studies  and  therefore  the  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  reported  in  published  studies  are 
presented below.  
Table 38 – Common adverse events in the prospective controlled studies 
The safety profile from prospective uncontrolled published studies and in retrospective published 
studies was also presented. These were consistent with the safety profile as established in other 
studies but showed much more variability in the frequency of reported events

Immunological events 
No cases of hypersensitivity have been reported in the prospective clinical studies and none have been 
described by the applicant in the published literature. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Based on the known safety profile of Fumaderm and other DMF containing products, TEAEs considered 
to  be  of  special  interest  were  decrease  in  total  leukocyte  and  lymphocyte  counts,  flushing, 
gastrointestinal events, serious and opportunistic infections, malignancies, renal injury and proteinuria, 
and hepatic injury. These events were specifically monitored and reported in study 1102. All reported 
TEAEs of special interest in Study 1102 were assessed as non-serious. 
Decreases in Leukocyte and Lymphocyte Count 
Leukocytopenia  and  lymphopenia  were  common  during  treatment  with  either  of  the  DMF  containing 
treatments. The proportion of patients who reported decreased leukocyte and lymphocyte count TEAEs 
in the DMF gastro-resistant tablets (13.3%) and Fumaderm (13.1%) groups were higher compared to 
placebo  (1.5%).  Lymphopenia  was  the  most  commonly  reported  TEAE  in  the  DMF  gastro-resistant 
tablets (10.0%) and Fumaderm (10.6%) groups, of which 89.3% and 93.3% were assessed as related 
to study treatment, respectively. No TEAEs of lymphopenia were reported in the placebo group. 
Lymphopenia  was  not  defined  in  a  standardized  way  across  publications  and  for  the  purpose  of  full 
disclosure, whatever publications referred to as lymphopenia is reported here. The reported incidence 
of patients with lymphopenia in published studies is highly variable with no apparent dose relationship, 
and ranged from 0% to 64% in studies with treatment duration of between 12 and 16 weeks, and 86% 
with treatment duration of up to 24 months. As the incidence of the AEs was not reported for placebo 
groups, a comparison to placebo is not possible.  
Flushing 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  reported  flushing  TEAEs  (flushing  or  hot  flush  TEAEs)  in  the  DMF 
gastro-resistant  tablets  (20.8%)  and  Fumaderm  (17.3%)  groups  were  higher  compared  to  placebo 
(2.2%).  All  but  2  TEAEs  of  flushing  were  assessed  as  related  to  study  treatment.  Most  patients 
experienced  flushing  during  the  early  treatment  phase/weeks.  Flushing  was  also  one  of  the  most 
common  AEs  reported  in  the  published  studies,  with  an  incidence  of  up  to  92%  of  patients  that 
generally  increased  with  increasing  dose.  Flushing  usually  occurred  in  the  first  few  months  of 
treatment and resolved or became less problematic with time. 
Gastrointestinal Disorders 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  reported  gastrointestinal  disorder  TEAEs  in  the  DMF  gastroresistant 
tablets  (62.7%)  and  Fumaderm  (63.3%)  groups  were  higher  compared  to  placebo  (29.9%).  The 
majority of gastrointestinal disorders were assessed as related to study treatment. 
Gastrointestinal disorders were one of the most common AEs reported in the published studies, with an 
incidence of up to 100% of patients that generally increased with increasing dose. The gastrointestinal 
disorders  usually  occurred  in  the  first  few  months  of  treatment  and  resolved  or  became  less 
problematic with time.

Hepatic Injury 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  reported  hepatic  injury  TEAEs  in  the  DMF  gastro-resistant  tablets 
(7.5%)  and  Fumaderm  (9.2%)  groups  were  similar  to  the  placebo  (7.3%)  group.  The  majority  of 
hepatic  injury  TEAEs  were  assessed  as  related  to  study  treatment  and  the  majority  were  mild  or 
moderate  in  intensity  in  the  DMF  gastro-resistant  tablets  (20/21  patients)  and  Fumaderm  (25/26 
patients) groups. 
Malignancies 
A  systematic  literature  review  with  meta-analysis  was  performed  on  the  risk  of  cancer  in  psoriasis, 
accompanied by evidence-based recommendations (Beyaert, 2013). The authors concluded that there 
is a slightly increased risk of some cancers in patients with psoriasis (upper aero-digestive tract, liver, 
lung, pancreatic and urinary tract cancers), that the highest increased risk is for skin carcinoma, that 
there  is  no  increased  risk  of  melanoma  and  that  regarding  lymphoma,  misdiagnosis  of  primary  skin 
lymphoma as psoriasis might have overestimated the risk. 
Very few malignancies were reported with DMF-containing treatments. Only 1 patient (22- 005 in the 
Fumaderm group) in Study 1102 had a TEAE of malignancy (dysplastic naevus assessed as mild, non-
serious  and  not  related  to  treatment).  Few  published  studies  reported  malignancies.  Squamous  cell 
carcinoma  was  reported  in  1  patient  who  had  been  treated  with  Fumaderm  for  6  weeks  (Jennings, 
2009),  carcinoma  of  the  breast  was  reported  in  1  patient  shortly  after  starting  Fumaderm  treatment 
(Brewer,  2007),  and  malignancies  including  breast  cancer,  prostate  cancer,  basal  cell  carcinoma  and 
an  oligodendroglioma  were  reported  by  3%  of  patients  in  the  long-term  with  treatment  of  up  to  74 
months  (Lijnen,  2015).  No  malignancies  were  reported  in  any  of  the  other  long-term  studies  with 
treatment  of  up  to  14  years  (Thio,  1995;  Reich,  2009;  Hoefnagel,  2003).  There  is  thus  no  indication 
that long-term FAE treatment is associated with an increased risk of malignancies. 
Renal Injury and Proteinuria 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  reported  renal  injury  and  proteinuria  TEAEs  was  low  (<3%)  in  all 
treatment  groups,  and  the  majority  of  TEAEs  were  assessed  as  not  related  to  study  treatment. 
Between  1972  and  2013,  12  individual  cases  have  been  published  as  case  reports  describing  the 
development  of  renal  toxicity  associated  with  local  and  systemic  FAE  treatment  (Reid,  2013;  Ogilvie, 
2011;  Raschka,  1999;  Dalhoff,  1990;  Stühlinger,  1990;  Roodnat,  1989;  Dubiel,  1972).  Several  of 
these  cases  of  renal  toxicity  occurred  with  doses  of  FAEs  that  are  much  higher  than  the  dose 
recommended for the DMF gastro-resistant tablets. In all of these cases, the renal function returned to 
normal after stopping treatment. 
Serious and Opportunistic Infections 
The proportion of patients who reported infection TEAEs was low (<5%) in all treatment groups in 
Study 1102. None of the patients in the DMF gastro-resistant tablets group, 2/6 patients in the 
Fumaderm and 3/6 patients in the placebo groups had TEAEs assessed as related to study treatment. 
All infection TEAEs had resolved by the end of the study or the 2-month follow-up period. No 
relationship was found between blood disorders such as leukopenia and lymphopenia and the onset of 
infections during the 16 weeks of treatment duration of Study 1102.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
One patient in the Fumaderm group died due to recent sub endocardial ischaemia which was assessed 
as ‘not related’ to the study drug by the investigator and sponsor.  
Among  the  52  published  studies  and  case  reports  included  in  the  safety  section  there  were  2  deaths 
reported.  One  patient  died  due  to  oligodendroglioma  during  treatment  with  DMF  monotherapy  in  the 
long-term  Lijnen  (2015)  study.  No  further  details  were provided in the publication. The second death 
was  due  to  Progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  (PML)  in  a  psoriasis  patient  treated  with  DMF 
and  presented  in  a  case  report  (Nieuwkamp,  2015).  This  was  a  64-year-old  female  patient  with 
psoriasis who presented treatment-related PML that occurred after receiving DMF (Psorinovo pharmacy 
preparation)  for  2  years  in  which  lymphocyte  numbers  were  not  monitored  for  nearly  2  years.  The 
patient  was  discontinued  from  treatment  after  being  diagnosed  with  PML,  which  was  considered  as 
DMF-associated. 
Other serious adverse events 
Study  1102  -  A  total  of  22  non-fatal  TESAEs  were  reported  in  22  patients  in  Study  1102:  9  (3.2%) 
DMF  gastro-resistant  tablets  patients,  8  (2.8%)  Fumaderm  patients,  and  5  (3.6%)  placebo  patients. 
The  only  TESAE  reported  for  more  than  1  patient  in  any  treatment  group  was  atrial  fibrillation  (2 
patients  in  the  DMF  gastro-resistant  group).  Two  patients  had  TESAEs  assessed  as  related  to  study 
treatment (both in the Fumaderm group): gastritis erosive and gastro duodenitis. 
Published  studies  -  Only  7  publications  with  456  patients  treated  with  FAEs  explicitly  mentioned  the 
incidence of SAEs (Fallah Arani, 2011; Gollnick, 2002; Wain, 2010; Schmieder 2015; Altmeyer 1996; 
Burden-Teh, 2013; Harries, 2005): no patients were reported to have SAEs in 6 of these studies and in 
the  other  study  (Gollnick  2002),  only  1  patient  was  reported  as  having  an  SAE  (adnexitis)  during 
treatment with a combination of Fumaderm plus topical calcipotriol. 
Other  publications  did  not  give  a  comprehensive  overview  of  all  SAEs  that  occurred,  but  did  report 
some individual events of sufficient medical interest to be considered SAEs. These were cardiovascular 
events  including  myocardial  infarction,  angina  pectoris,  percutaneous  coronary  intervention,  atrial 
fibrillation  and  heart  valve  replacement  (3%  of  patients  in  the  long-term  Lijnen  study  [2015],  8% 
[4/50]  of  patients  in  the  Balak  study  [2015]),  and  malignancies  including  breast  cancer,  prostate 
cancer,  basal  cell  carcinoma  and  an  oligodendroglioma  (3%  of  patients  in  the  long-term  Lijnen  study 
[2015]). 
In  addition,  among  case  report  studies,  squamous  cell  carcinoma  was  reported  in  1  patient  who  had 
been treated with Fumaderm for 6 weeks (Jennings 2009), and tuberculosis was reported in 1 patient 
after treatment with FAEs for 7 months (Ahmad, 2007). PML was reported in 8 case reports in patients 
treated  with  FAEs  (Stoppe,  2014;  Ermis,  2013;  Dammeier,  2015;  Sweetser  2013;  van  Kester,  2015; 
Bartsch, 2015; Nieuwkamp, 2015; Hoepner, 2015; van Oosten 2013).

Of the 8 case reports, there was one fatality, 2 had stable disease, 1 recovered with mild to moderate 
residual symptoms and the rest recovered fully. All of these PML patients had lymphocyte levels of 
<0.8 x109/L prior to the onset of PML symptoms. Except for 1 patient where the duration of 
lymphopenia was stated to be 1 month (where monitoring was sporadic), all other cases had recorded 
a duration of lymphopenia which was more than a year. 
Laboratory findings 
In Study 1102, blood samples for safety laboratory tests were taken at all visits throughout the study 
(screening, Visits 1-7 over the 16 weeks of treatment, and follow-up visits F1, F2, and F3). 
Mean serum creatinine levels decreased slightly during the study in all treatment groups. Additionally, 
neither  the  estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate  nor  the  results  of  urinalysis  indicate  a  decrease  in 
kidney function in any of the 3 treatment groups. 
A  transient  increase  in  eosinophils  was  observed  with  DMF  gastro-resistant  tablets  and  Fumaderm 
treatment,  and  the  mean  changes  from  baseline  after  16  weeks  of  treatment  were  generally 
comparable  between  the  DMF  gastro-resistant  tablets  (100/μL)  and  Fumaderm  groups  (40/μL), 
although  there  were  some  numerical  differences  in  favour  of  Fumaderm  at  some  time  points  of 
measurement. Such eosinophilia has been noted in respect of Fumaderm treatment previously and has 
not been associated with clinical consequences. However, it was seen that there was a higher incidence 
of  potentially  eosinophil-related  disorders:  GI  disorders  (diarrhoea,  abdominal  pain  nausea  and 
vomiting),  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  (erythema  and  pruritus),  vascular  disorders 
(flushing) and general disorders (asthenic conditions) in patients with eosinophilia. 
Treatment with DMF gastro-resistant tablets and Fumaderm also led to comparable decreases in 
leukocytes (DMF: -730/μL and Fumaderm: -690/μL) and lymphocytes (DMF: -520/μL and Fumaderm: 
-520/μL). Twelve months after stop of treatment (=F3 visit) where data were available, all patients 
(n=30) had leukocyte counts above the lower limit of normal (3.0x109/L). However, lymphocyte levels 
had still not recovered and were below the lower limit of normal (1.0x109/L) in 3/28 patients (10.7%), 
which would represent 3/279 (1.1%) of the patients started on Skilarence. For lymphocytes, the 
LAS41008 mean baseline was 1.98 to 1.53 at F3 (n=28/272, 10%) and for Fumaderm the mean 
baseline was 2.02 to 1.70 at F3 (n=38/277, 14%).  
Severe  lymphopenia  (<500  lymphocytes/mm3)  is  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  developing  PML.  A 
Rote Hand (“Dear Doctor”) letter was issued by BfArM in June 2013 warning of a suspected association 
between  severe  lymphopenia  known  to  occur  with  Fumaderm  treatment  and  PML.  Although  PML  was 
not reported in Study 1102, the BfArM database reports 9 cases of PML in association with Fumaderm 
treatment  and  there  are  6  case  reports  of  PML  in  patients  treated  with  FAEs  (Stoppe,  2014;  Ermis, 
2013; Dammeier, 2015; van Kester, 2015; Bartsch, 2015; Nieuwkamp, 2015). 
Vital  signs:  In  Study  1102,  there  were  no  clinically  meaningful  changes  in  blood  pressure,  pulse,  or 
body temperature  
From published studies, the reported laboratory findings include leucopenia, lymphopenia, eosinophilia, 
liver abnormalities, creatinine abnormalities and proteinuria. 
Safety in special populations 
Subgroup  analyses  by  intrinsic  factors  were  only  performed  for  Study  1102.  Subgroup  analyses  of 
TEAEs were performed to identify any safety concerns associated with age (<40 years vs. >40 to <65 
years, and ≥ 65 years), race (Caucasian vs. non Caucasian), and disease severity at baseline assessed 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 84/108 
 
 
 
 
by  PASI  (moderate  vs.  severe  [PASI  >10])  and  PGA  (moderate  [score of  3] vs.  severe  [score of  5]). 
No new safety concerns were identified in any of the subgroup analyses. 
Table 40 – Subgroup analyses of TEAEs in study 1102 
During  the  Phase  III  Study  1102,  a  32-year-old  female  in  the  DMF  gastro-resistant  tablets  group 
realised  she  was  pregnant  after  receiving  study  treatment  for  3  days.  The  study  treatment  was 
stopped immediately. After 38 weeks gestation, the patient gave birth to a healthy boy (weight 3,790 
grams, height 54.0 cm). 
The safety of DMF in human pregnancy or in nursing mothers has not been established in controlled 
clinical studies. Pregnancy was an exclusion criterion in the published studies. There were 2 
pregnancies reported in the published literature during treatment with FAEs and treatment was 
stopped during the course of pregnancies in both cases (Reid 2013; Balak, 2015).

TEAE: treatment-emergent adverse event including all events that occurred up to 30 days after the 
last IMP intake. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No  drug-disease  interactions  were  reported  in  patients  from  any  of  the  clinical  studies  or  published 
studies. 
Due  to  the  potential  risk  for  DMF  to  cause  kidney  damage,  MTX,  retinoids,  psoralens,  cyclosporin, 
immunosuppressive  agents,  cytostatic  agents  and  drugs  with  known  harmful  effect  on  kidneys  must 
not be administered concomitantly with DMF. 
No drug-drug interactions were reported in patients from any of the clinical studies. One case of a 
possible drug-drug interaction between DMF and vitamin K antagonist acenocoumarol was observed in 
a 56-year-old female patient (Lijnen, 2015). This patient was regularly treated with 2-3 mg 
acenocoumarol daily but required substantially higher doses after commencing DMF monotherapy 
treatment, which normalised after discontinuation of DMF. No information was available on the type of 
DMF product used. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
TEAEs  leading  to  study  drug  withdrawal  were  reported  in  144  patients  (20.6%).  The  incidence  was 
similar  in  the  DMF  gastro-resistant  tablets  (67  patients  [24.0%])  group  and  the  Fumaderm  (69 
patients [24.4%]) groups, and lower in the placebo group (8 patients [5.8%]). 
The  most  common  TEAEs  (≥ 2%  of  patients)  by  SOC  were  gastrointestinal  disorders  (17.9%  of  DMF 
gastro-resistant  tablets  patients  and  14.8% of  Fumaderm  patients  vs  2.2%  of  placebo  patients),  and 
skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  (2.2%  of  DMF  gastro-resistant  tablets  patients  and  3.2%  of 
Fumaderm patients vs 0.7% of placebo patients). 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 86/108 
 
 
 
 
 
In the 4 prospective controlled studies that reported on the incidence of discontinuation due to AEs, 
treatment duration was between 12 and 16 weeks and the incidence in DMF treatment groups ranged 
from 7% to 32%. In general, the most common AEs leading to withdrawal of DMF, Fumaderm or other 
DMF combination treatments in the psoriasis studies were gastrointestinal events. 
Post marketing experience 
There  is  no  post-marketing  experience  with  Skilarence.  However  the  safety  profile  of  DMF  containing 
products  is  relevant  to  Skilarence  and  the  submitted  information  from  published  literature  has  been 
reviewed under each section above.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  evidence  on  safety  comes  from  the  prospective  studies  with  Skilarence  and  published  studies 
where  the  latter  predominantly  includes  studies  with  Fumaderm.  Treatment  with  FAEs  (DMF+MEFs; 
Fumaderm)  is  an  established  treatment  for  psoriasis  and  as  such  has  been  widely  used  in  Germany. 
The main safety issues refer to GI-AE, flushing, leuko- and lymphopenia with the risk of opportunistic 
infections  and  renal  AEs.  The  applicant  has  developed  a  gastro-resistant  tablet  (Skilarence)  that 
contains only DMF in the same amount as Fumaderm. 
It is pointed out that Skilarence and Fumaderm contain the same amount of DMF i.e. 30mg or 120 mg 
per tablet, respectively. However, Fumaderm in addition contains monoethylfumaric acids (MEFs), i.e. 
each Fumaderm 120 mg tablet contains 95 mg of MEFs (120 DMF + 95 MEFs = in total 215 mg FAEs). 
Therefore, if comparing the (adverse) effects of Skilarence containing equal amounts of DMF (i.e. 120 
mg DMF) to Fumaderm, it has to be considered, that Fumaderm in addition contains MEFs (95 mg per 
120  mg  tablet),  which  may  additionally  to  DMF  impact  on  the  safety/tolerability/PK  profile  of  
Fumaderm.  Based  on  the  comparative  quality,  PK,  efficacy  and  safety  data  between  Skilarence  and 
Fumaderm,  it  is  agreed  that  the  main  effects  in  psoriasis  seem  to  be  from  the  DMF  component  and 
therefore  the  evidence  on  efficacy  and  safety  of  Fumaderm  from  literature  is  highly  relevant  and 
supportive of Skilarence. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 3659 patients and 56 healthy subjects (3 PK studies 1103, 1104, and 08) were treated with 
FAEs  (DMF  alone  and  DMF/MEF  combinations  including  Fumaderm)  in  the  4  clinical  studies  and  56 
published studies and case reports presented in this application: i) 562 in the pivotal study 1102 (plus 
n=137 in the placebo arm (SAS)), and ii) 3.097 in the published articles.  
The  vast  majority  of  the  safety  data  from  literature  refers  to  Fumaderm  (DMF+MEF).  The  population 
which was treated with DMF-only in studies published mostly about 25 years ago (except for the Lijnen 
study  (2015))  was  also  small  (around  n=375)  if  compared  to  Fumaderm  which  contains  DMF+MEF. 
Hence,  the  long  term  safety  data  for  DMF  mono-treatment  in  psoriasis  may  be  considered  to  be 
associated  with  some  uncertainties  and  thus  the  long  term  safety  profile  is  considered  missing 
information  in  the  proposed  safety  specification.  In  this  regard  a  PASS,  included  in  the  RMP,  will  be 
conducted. 
Adverse events 
In  the  pivotal  study  1102  a  similar  proportion  of  patients  reported  at  least  1  TEAE  in  the  DMF  group 
(83.9%)  and  the  Fumaderm  group  (84.1%),  compared  to  a  smaller  proportion  of  patients  in  the 
placebo  group  (59.9%):  however,  this  was  mainly  attributable  to  gastrointestinal  disorders  (such  as 
diarrhoea,  abdominal  cramps,  and  nausea),  which  are  known,  common  AEs  that  occur  during 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 87/108 
 
 
 
 
treatment with DMF mono- and combination treatments, and are consistent with the established safety 
profile of DMF treatment, with essentially no difference in either the profile or the frequency of the AEs 
reported. 
The same accounts  for treatment-related TEAEs in the DMF group (73.8%) and the Fumaderm group 
(73.9%), compared to a smaller proportion (40.1%) of the patients in the placebo group.  
With regard to published literature it is noted that most of the studies refer to Fumaderm and not DMF 
monotherapy.  However,  the  range  of the  incidence of  AEs  reported  in  the  different  (types  of)  studies 
(62-100%)  is  broadly  in  accordance  with  the  incidence  reported  in  study  1102  (DMF:  83.9%; 
Fumaderm: 84.1%). 
In the pivotal study 1102 the most frequently reported ADRs refer among others to GI-events (TEAEs 
by SOC: 62.7% (DMF) vs. 63.3% (Fumaderm)) and flushing (TEA by PT (DMF: 18.3% vs. Fumaderm: 
16.3%)).  
Decreases in lymphocytes (in varying degrees) are known for Fumaderm and were seen in DMF treated 
(10%) and Fumaderm treated patients (10.6%) in study 1102 [concerning the parameter “at any visit” 
numerically  more  often  with  DMF  (54/266  (20.3%)  than  with  Fumaderm  (45/276  (16.3%)].    It  is 
noted  that  there  were  cases  of  decrease  in  lymphocytes  in  the  placebo  group  during  the  follow  up 
period  and  the  reason  for  this  is  not  clear.  The  applicant  clarified  that  none  of  these  patients  were 
known to be on other immunosuppressive therapy and so the reasons remain unclear.  
However, it is clear that lymphopenia is an expected side effect of treatment with DMF gastro-resistant 
tablets. Clinically, lymphopenia is a risk factor for serious and/or opportunistic infections, and therefore 
blood  cell  counts  should  be  monitored  regularly  as  per  the  recommendations  in  the  Summary  of 
Product Characteristics in order to minimise the risk. 
The applicant presented analyses with different definitions for decreased leukocytes (<3000/mm3 and 
<4000/mm3)  and  the  relative  leukopenia  in  both  treatments  were  comparable  regardless  of  the 
definition.  With  a  definition  of  <3000/mm3,  transient  leukopenia  ccurred  in  9%  (DMF)  and  6% 
(Fumaderm) [31.2% (DMF) vs. 27.9% (Fumaderm) at any visit]. 
The  clinical  concern  due  to  the  occurrence  of  decrease  in  lymphocytes  relates  to  the  occurrence  of 
serious opportunistic infections and the main identified risk includes PML. Based on the evidence from 
literature  submitted  by  the  applicant,  there  have  been  8  case  reports  of  PML  occurring  after  use  of 
fumarates  in  psoriatic  patients.  All  these  cases  were  associated  with  lymphopenia  <0.8x109/L  and 
most of them (7 out of 8) for prolonged lymphopenia. Of the 8 case-reports, there was 1 fatality and 2 
stable  diseases,  with  the  rest  recovering.    A  review  by  the  CHMP  for  PML  risks  associated  with 
fumarates  irrespective  of  the  indication,  made  recommendations  for  risk  mitigation  by  regular 
monitoring for lymphocyte counts and treatment stop.  
For  this  application,  the  applicant  proposes  monitoring  periods  for  complete  blood  count  with 
differential of 3 months for people with normal lymphocyte count and a more frequent (once every 4 
weeks) monitoring for patients with lymphocyte count below 1x109/L. This is less conservative than the 
recommendations  from  the  CHMP  review  (which  recommends  every  4  weeks),  however  this  is 
considered  a  more  rational  approach  to  provide  a  practical  and  adequate  risk  mitigation  measure, 
particularly as a more conservative criterion for stopping treatment is proposed.  
The thresholds of lymphocytes for stopping the treatment is 0.7x109/L (see SmPC section 4.4). If the 
lymphocyte  count  falls  below  0.7x109/L,  the  blood  test  must  be  repeated  and  if  the  levels  are 
confirmed  to  be  below  0.7x109/L,  then  treatment  must  be  stopped  immediately.  This  is  more 
conservative  as  compared  to  the  CHMP  recommendations  which  recommends  halving  the  dose  when 
the  levels  are  below  0.7x109/L  and  stopping  treatment  only  if  after  4  weeks  at  half  the  dose,  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 88/108 
 
 
 
 
lymphocyte  levels  remain  below  0.7x109/L.  In  these  recommendations,  the  threshold  for  a  straight 
stop without any dose reduction is <0.5x109/L. 
In  the  different  types  of  published  studies  the  percentage  of  patients  experiencing  GI  disorders, 
flushing,  lymphopenia,  and  eosinophilia  is  rather  heterogenous  between  the  studies.  Due  to  the  wide 
ranges  reported  in  the  different  types  of  studies,  the  percentages  reported  for  common  AEs  in  study 
1102 fit in the percentages that have been reported for the different published studies. The applicant 
states  that  GI  (gastrointestinal)  AEs  were  most  frequent  in  the  first  2  months  after  starting  therapy 
and subsided thereafter.  
In  general  the  adverse  events  reported  with  LAS41008  in  the  pivotal  study  1102,  their  frequency, 
severity  and  causality  assessment  were  along  expected  lines  based  on  the  known  safety  profile  of 
Fumaderm and other DMF containing products.  
The  most  common  adverse  events  associated  with  DMF  treatment  are  gastrointestinal  disturbance 
(including  diarrhoea,  abdominal  pain,  nausea,  flatulence  and  vomiting),  skin  and  subcutaneous 
disorders  (pruritus,  erythema  and  skin  burning  sensation),  flushing  and  haematological  abnormalities 
(lymphopenia  and  eosinophilia).  Other  common  adverse  events  included  headache,  paraesthesia, 
fatigue,  decreased  appetite  and  raised  hepatic  enzymes.  Other  uncommon  adverse  events  include 
proteinuria.  Some  events/potential  safety  concerns  based  on  safety  information  of  Fumaderm  which 
have not been identified in the limited data from study 1102 include increased serum creatinine, renal 
failure,  serious  opportunistic  infections  especially  PML,  malignancies  and  Fanconi  syndrome.  All  of 
these  have  now  been  included  in  the  proposed  safety  profile  of  the  proposed  DMF  product.  For  the 
safety  events  of  haematological  abnormalities,  renal  injury  and  hepatic  injury  recommendations  are 
made in the SmPC to have regular monitoring and appropriate treatment discontinuation if significant 
changes are noted to prevent unacceptable consequences (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Most of the discontinuations early in treatment are due to tolerability issues leading to GI disturbances, 
flushing and skin related adverse events. This is planned to be managed by the gradual dose-titration 
which  has  kept  the  discontinuation  rates to  acceptable  limits  with  Fumaderm.  A  similar  dose-titration 
scheme  is  therefore  proposed  with  this  product.  Overall  the  incidence  of  adverse  events  was  83.9% 
with  LAS41008  as  compared  to  59.9%  in  placebo.  Most  of  them  were  mild;  however  adverse  events 
were  the  reason  for  24.4%  of  patient  discontinuing  treatment  in  LAS41008  as  compared  to  5.8%  in 
placebo. The discontinuation rate due to adverse events in published literature is wide and ranges from 
7 to > 40% (even up to 80% in some reports) but a reasonable expectation from the diverse literature 
would be up to 40%.  
There  were  no  deaths  considered  related  to  study  treatment  or  any  serious  adverse  events  that 
occurred in more than 2 patients. Likewise, the reports from published literature have not given rise to 
any significant concerns in relation to serious adverse events. However, there are potential significant 
safety concerns particularly with long-term use of malignancies and serious opportunistic infections like 
PML. These potential concerns have been identified with Fumaderm and other DMF containing products 
as well and there are case-reports of PML in the literature after Fumaderm treatment. There is a strong 
mechanistic basis for the potential for serious opportunistic infections as there have been some reports 
of severe lymphopenia with long-term treatment. However, from literature it is not clear if Fumaderm 
can increase the risk of PML to an unacceptable level as the data is from spontaneous reporting. This is 
of  particular  importance  as  a  substantial  amount  of  the  safety  data  from  published  literature  is  with 
Fumaderm  and  as  most  of  these  data  is  by  spontaneous  reporting  and  probably  from  patients  who 
have not used recently authorised monoclonal antibodies that also modulate the immune system, and 
the risks of DMF in the current therapeutic setting could well be different. A post-authorisation registry 
based safety study to evaluate the rare but significant risks over long-term use will be performed. 
Assessment report

The overall clinical experience with the proposed DMF product is limited (279 patients treated with 189 
patients  treated  for  3  months  or  more).  Although  reassurance  can  be  obtained  from  published 
literature  with  Fumaderm (literature  describes  around  3200 patients treated  with  Fumaderm  and it  is 
known that more than 5 million packs of Fumaderm have been sold in Germany in the last 15 years) 
that the anticipated uncommon and rare events are likely to be acceptable, the frequency and severity 
of these events reported with Fumaderm cannot be extrapolated directly to the proposed DMF product 
due  to  Fumaderm  containing  monoethylfumarate  salts  in  addition  to  DMF  which  can  potentially  alter 
the safety profile. Therefore to address the long-term safety concerns and to evaluate the frequency of 
rare  but  serious  adverse  events,  a  PASS  is  required.  The  applicant  has  submitted  the  PASS  protocol 
and the draft timelines for agreement.   
With  respect  to  interactions,  there  were  only  6  published  studies  that  provided  general  details  of 
concomitant  medication  use  in  patients  treated  with  DMF  (Lijnen,  2016)  or  DMF/MEF  (Schmieder, 
2015; Ismail, 2014; Thaçi, 2013; Reich, 2009; Harries, 2005), all of which were uncontrolled studies. 
The concomitant medications most commonly reported were treatments for hypertension, coagulation 
disorders and dyslipidaemia, which is consistent with the medical history and co-morbidities described 
in these patients. In addition, as the PK and PD interactions data have not been well characterised and 
the  available  clinical  data  with  Fumaderm  from  published  literature  is  not  detailed,  the  clinical  data 
from  special  sub-groups  of  population  like  elderly,  patients  with  hepatic  or  renal  impairment, 
immunosuppressed patients, patients with other concomitant co-morbidities especially those that were 
excluded  from  the  pivotal  clinical  study  is  limited  and  the  applicant  will  address  these  in  the  post-
marketing safety study and/or by appropriate wording in the SmPC. This is acceptable.  
According to the applicant the extent of exposure for patients with renal impairment based on GFR was 
n=117  patients  (mild  renal  impairment),  and  n=12  (moderate  renal  impairment).  Taking  in  to 
consideration the known PK of DMF, the applicant asserts that there is no need for change in dose in 
these  patients.  With  regard  to  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  a  contraindication  has  been 
proposed. This was considered to be appropriate. 
Likewise  there  were  only  3  patients  with  medical  history  of  hepatic  impairment  that  were  included  in 
the  trial.  Nevertheless  based  on  the  PK  of  DMF,  a  dose-modification  is  not  proposed  for  mild  to 
moderate  hepatic  impairment.  For  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment,  a  contraindication  was 
proposed and considered to be appropriate. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of the proposed DMF product as characterised in the pivotal study 1102 is acceptable 
and comparable to the safety profile of Fumaderm. In addition, this safety profile is consistent with the 
known  safety  profile  of  other  DMF  containing  products  including  Fumaderm  as  evidenced  from 
published literature. However the safety data with the proposed DMF product is limited (n=279) and is 
inadequate  to  sufficiently  characterise  uncommon  and  rare  adverse  events.  In  addition,  the  potential 
significant  safety  concerns  of  increased  risk  of  serious  and  opportunistic  infections  including  PML  and 
malignancies  with  long-term  treatment  have  not  been  accurately  ascertained  with  the  clinical  use  of 
fumarates. Educational materials will be distributed to the health care professionals, about the risk of 
serious  infections,  mainly  opportunistic  infections  such  as  progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy 
(PML), and to provide guidance on the monitoring of lymphocyte and leukocyte count abnormalities. 
Although  it  is  acknowledged  that  there  is  considerable  safety  experience  with  Fumaderm  and  other 
DMF-containing products and that this experience is relevant to Skilarence, it cannot be excluded that 
the  lack  of  MEF  salts  in  Skilarence  and  the  small  differences  in  exposure  to  MMF  may  result  in  some 
differences  in  long-term  safety  profiles  and/or  rare  ADRs.  However,  despite  this  inadequate 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 90/108 
 
 
 
 
characterisation  of  the  safety  profile  with  the  proposed  DMF  product  there  is  reassurance  on  the 
acceptability  of  its  safety  profile  as  it  is in  general  similar  to  that  of  Fumaderm,  for  which  the  safety 
profile  is  well  characterised  including  the  long-term  safety  profile  as  evidenced  from  published 
literature.  In  addition,  based  on  the  overall  evidence vis-a-vis  Fumaderm  that  has  been  submitted  in 
this  dossier,  it  is  agreed  that  the  established  safety  profile  of  Fumaderm  is  highly  relevant  for  this 
product. However as the characterisation of the rare but serious adverse events of Fumaderm are not 
well characterised in the published literature, the applicant is required to conduct a post-authorisation 
safety study included in the RMP.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Skilarence is intended for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults in need of 
systemic drug therapy. 
Dimethyl fumarate is a fumaric acid ester (FAE). 
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease, predominantly involving the skin, where it is characterised 
by the presence of erythematous plaques, usually covered by white silvery scales, but joints may also 
be affected (psoriatic arthritis). Psoriasis is more frequent in countries further away from the equator 
and has an estimated worldwide prevalence of 1% to 2%. 
Psoriasis is a stigmatising condition that can have a major impact on quality of life, to a similar extent 
as cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Psoriatic lesions can be itchy and painful and cause extreme 
physical and emotional discomfort to patients. In addition, in its most severe presentations, patients 
with psoriasis have an increased risk of developing other comorbidities such as depression, diabetes 
and cardiovascular disease, which can eventually increase the overall risk of mortality. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
At present there is no definitive cure for psoriasis. Available treatments focus primarily on the use of 
anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory agents to control the symptoms of the disease and prevent 
further relapses. The management of mild psoriasis usually consists of topical treatments. Treatments 
for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis include phototherapy and systemic treatment with oral 
agents and injectable biotechnology-derived products. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This  is  an  Article  8(3)-  full  mixed  application  and  is  supported  by  the  applicant’s  own  studies  and 
substantial  supportive  evidence  from  published  literature  where  the  efficacy/safety  of  Fumaderm  has 
been well documented.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
In  the  pivotal  study,  treatment  with  the  proposed  DMF  product  using  the  proposed  dose-titration 
scheme  resulted  in  37.5%  of  the  treated  patients  achieving  PASI  75  (a  >75%  reduction  in  the  PASI 
score from baseline) after 16 weeks of treatment as compared to placebo where 15.2% of the patients 
achieved PASI 75. Twenty percent more patients in the treatment arm achieved a clear or almost clear 
score in PGA (33.0% vs. 13.0%) at week 16 as compared to placebo. The proportion of patients with 
PASI  90  was  18.4%  with  LAS41008  as  compared  to  4.6%  with  placebo.  The  mean  DLQI  score  at 
baseline of 11.3 (indicating a very large effect of the disease on patient’s life) was improved to a mean 
of  5.4  (indicating  a  moderate  effect  on  patient’s  life).  The  probability  of  relapse  within  two  months 
after end of treatment was smaller than 20% in the Skilarence and the Fumaderm group. Additionally, 
it was demonstrated that Skilarence (DMF) is comparable to Fumaderm (DMF/MEF) in the proportion of 
patients achieving PASI 75 at Week 16 (37.5% vs. 40.3%). 
Most  of  the  patients  who  completed  treatment  of  16  weeks  had  been  titrated  to  the  maximum 
720mg/day dose in both treatment arms (72.25% for LAS41008 and 71.02% for Fumaderm).  
In addition to the benefits as ascertained in the pivotal study with the proposed DMF product, there are 
also  supportive  studies  from  published  literature  ranging  over  a  wide  time-span  with  different  DMF 
containing formulations (most of them referring to Fumaderm, but also DMF-monotherapy) by different 
authors from different centres which all suggest a clinically relevant and significant treatment benefit in 
psoriasis.  In  two  published  randomised,  double-blind,  controlled  studies  with  grade  A2  evidence  level 
(high-quality comparative study) according to the S3-guidelines a reduction of PASI of 50.2% at week 
16 resp. 51.9% at week 13 was reported with Fumaderm. 
The onset of treatment effects was seen at weeks 3/8 in some of the sensitive endpoints but not in all 
the endpoints. With continued treatment the benefits of treatment continued to increase as compared 
to placebo showing a maximum difference at week 16 in this pivotal study. In this study the benefits of 
DMF were seen to be comparable to Fumaderm (which contains DMF in the same quantities and in 
addition three other salts of monoethyfumarate). Published literature suggests with other DMF 
containing products show that there is maintenance of treatment effects with long-term treatments > 
24 months. Some published studies also suggest that the peak effect of treatment could take up to 12 
months to achieve. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Given the small size of the overall efficacy data available with the proposed DMF product, there are a 
number  of  specific  sub-groups  of  the  patient  population  with  co-morbidities  (renal  and  hepatic 
impairment) who were excluded from these studies.  
The potential for PK and PD interactions has not been well characterised. Only indirect assurance from 
the  long-term  clinical  use  of  other  DMF  products  (mainly  Fumaderm)  is  available.  As  this 
predominantly  depends  on  publications  and  spontaneous  reporting  there  are  uncertainties  about  the 
extent of benefit that can be seen in different sub-groups of the target population. 
It is acknowledged that there is considerable published literature to support the efficacy, however, the 
estimates of the efficacy (effect size) varies widely and there are limitations with respect to the lack of 
detailed data to allow precise description of the effect size in various sub-groups of patients other than 
those studied in the study 1102.  
Non-inferiority of DMF vs. Fumaderm was evaluated for PASI75 and PGA. A formal non-inferiority was 
established  based  on  the  pre-specified  non-inferiority  margin;  however  although  the  pre-specified 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 99/108 
 
 
 
 
margin of +/-15% has been generally accepted in this setting, this is considered broad particularly due 
to the observed effect size in this study.   
The  effects  in  regard  to  the  co-primary  endpoints  were  numerically  slightly  lower  in  the  Skilarence 
group compared to Fumaderm although this could be due to variability, a limited PD and the efficacy 
effect of MEFs in Fumaderm may also be contributing to an anti-psoriatic effect.  
The evidence for long-term efficacy has been extrapolated from the evidence in published literature 
with other DMF containing products mainly Fumaderm and there is no direct evidence for long-term 
maintenance of effect with the proposed product. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Around  84%  of  treated  patients  experienced  an  adverse  event  with  the  proposed  DMF  product  as 
compared  to  60%  of  patients  on  placebo.  The  majority  of  TEAEs  were  of  mild  to  moderate  intensity. 
The  common  adverse  events  included  gastrointestinal  (GI)  disorders  (diarrhoea,  abdominal  pain, 
nausea,  vomiting,  dyspepsia,  constipation,  flatulence),  flushing,  erythema,  pruritus,  skin  burning 
sensation,  fatigue,  decreased  appetite,  haematological  abnormalities  (lymphopenia,  eosinophilia, 
leukopenia) and increase in hepatic enzymes. The most frequently reported ADRs were among others 
to GI-events (TEAEs by SOC: 62.7% (DMF) vs. 63.3% (Fumaderm) in study 1102) and flushing (TEAE 
by PT (DMF: 18.3% vs. Fumaderm: 16.3%) in study 1102). 
Decreases  in  lymphocytes  (in  varying  degrees)  are  known  for  Fumaderm  and  were  reported  in  DMF 
treated (10%) and Fumaderm treated patients (10.6%) in study 1102 [concerning the parameter “at 
any  visit”  numerically  more  often  with  DMF  [54/266  (20.3%) than  with  Fumaderm  45/276  (16.3%)]. 
From  literature  it  is  known  that  the  decrease  in  lymphocytes  can  be  stopped  on  stopping  treatment 
and the time for the lymphocytes to return to baseline can be long. From the results of the long-term 
follow up study 1102, the time for lymphocyte count to return to baseline can be longer than 46 weeks 
as  evidenced  by  the  mean  number  of  lymphocytes  at  52  week  follow-up  visit.  However  despite  the 
high  incidence  of  decrease  in  lymphocyte  counts,  the  number  of  ‘clinical  events’  due  to  the  low 
lymphocyte count is very low.   
The  most  significant  clinical  event  due  to  reduced  lymphocyte  count  is  PML  and  8  case  reports  have 
been found in the literature with the use of fumarates in psoriasis.  These events of PML described in 
association with Fumaderm treatment have generally occurred when treatment was continued despite 
significant  reduction  in  low  lymphocyte  counts  contrary  to  the  current  recommendations  to  stop 
treatment.  Of  the  8  reports,  the  clinical  outcomes  reported  were  1  fatality,  2  stable  disease,  1 
recovered with mild sequelae and the remaining recovered. Serious infections (including opportunistic 
infections such as PML) are currently classified as important identified risks in the safety specification 
for Skilarence.  
Other uncommon/rare/very rare/frequency unknown events based on safety information of Fumaderm 
include proteinuria, increased serum creatinine, renal failure, other serious opportunistic infections and 
Fanconi syndrome. Twelve cases of renal toxicity associated with local or systemic FAE treatment have 
been described in the literature. In the Lijnen (2015) study which investigated DMF-mono therapy with 
higher DMF doses, proteinuria was reported in 25/176 (14%) of patients which compares poorly with 
regard  to  proteinuria  of  4/279  (1.4%)  in  DMF  patients  and  6/283  (2.1%)  of  Fumaderm  patients 
reported  in  the  study  1102.  Renal  injury  and  proteinuria  is  currently  classified  as  an  important 
potential risk in the proposed safety specification of Skilarence. 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 100/108 
 
 
 
 
Treatment  related  adverse  events  resulted  in  treatment  discontinuation  in  24%  of the  patients  in the 
DMF treatment group as compared to around 6% in the placebo group; however most of the adverse 
events resolved on discontinuation of treatment.  
Based  on  literature,  the  intolerability  to  GI  disorders  and  flushing  can  be  reduced  by  dose-titration, 
which  has  resulted  in  the  proposed  dose-titration  scheme  at  treatment  initiation.  The  risk  of  serious 
consequences  of  renal,  hepatic  and  haematological  abnormalities  can  be  managed  by  regular 
monitoring  of  the  function  of  these  organ  systems  and  appropriate  actions  with  respect  to  treatment 
withdrawal have been included in the SmPC. 
Overall, the submitted clinical data from the phase III study and from the few and limited published 
studies that refer to DMF mono therapy as well as the substantial literature of Fumaderm (which 
contains DMF+MEF salts) do not indicate critical differences in the ADR profile of Skilarence compared 
to the DMF containing products, although some numerical differences are noted. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The  overall  safety  data  set  with  the  proposed  DMF  product  is  around  280  patients  with  around  190 
patients  exposed  for  12  weeks  or  more.  The  overall  treatment  duration  was  for  16  weeks  and  this 
number is too small to detect rare ADRs or adverse events which occur after long-term treatments.  
Although  there  is  sufficient  information  (around  3200  patients  exposed)  on  safety  with  other  DMF 
containing products including Fumaderm, which can provide reassurance with respect to an acceptable 
safety  profile  for  this  product,  data  from  published  literature  is  not  fully  reliable.  With  regard  to 
published  literature,  483/3.051  (16%)  of  treated  patients  were  included  in  prospective  controlled 
studies, 787/3.051 (26%) in prospective uncontrolled studies, and the majority 1.781/3.051 (58%) in 
retrospective  and  observational  studies.  In  addition,  only  a  small  number  of  these  patients  was 
exposed to DMF-only treatment of psoriasis (around n=375). Hence, the long term safety data for DMF 
mono-treatment  of  psoriasis  may  be  considered  missing  and  has  been  included  as  such  in  the 
proposed safety specification and will be further investigated in a PASS as outlined in the RMP.  
In addition, there is the safety data from spontaneous reports due to the long duration of clinical use 
(more than 20 years) of DMF containing products, mainly Fumaderm in Germany but also from other 
EU  countries.  However  these  data  by  their  very  nature  cannot  provide  a  fully  accurate  description  of 
the safety profile of DMF containing products. However it is acknowledged that these data provide very 
useful supportive data to give reassurance on an acceptable profile. 
With regards to the frequent adverse reactions of GI upset, flushing, erythema, pruritus, skin burning 
sensation,  fatigue,  decreased  appetite,  haematological  abnormalities  (lymphopenia,  eosinophilia, 
leukopenia)  and  increase  in  hepatic  enzymes,  the  frequency  is  reasonably  characterised  but  not  fully 
accurate as there is a range of incidences that is reported. 
With  respect  to  the  lymphopenia,  from  the  limited  data  available  from  the  long-term  follow-up  study 
1102, it is noted that although the treatment was stopped at week 16, the lymphocyte levels had still 
not  recovered  and  were  below  the  lower  limit  of  normal  (1.0x109/L)  in  3/28  patients  (10.7%)  at  12 
months after stopping treatment. However there were a number of drop-outs and only around 15% of 
the  patients  stayed  in  the  study  till  week  52.  This  persistent  low  lymphocyte  count  is  taken  into 
account  in  the  design  of  the  PASS  study  to  evaluate  the  occurrence  of  events  of  interest  due  to 
lymphocyte count even after stopping treatment with DMF containing products.  
The important clinically significant consequence of persistent, prolonged lymphopenia is the occurrence 
of  serious  opportunistic  infection  of  PML.  Although  the  total  number  of  case  reports  in  psoriasis 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 101/108 
 
 
 
 
patients  with  use  of  fumarates  is  low  (n=8)  over  the  number  of  years  of  its  clinical  use,  the 
denominator with regards to the total number of patient exposure years for this incidence is not known 
and  the  reliability  of  the  actual  number  of  case  reports  is  also  not  robust  as  these  are  from 
spontaneous  case  reports.  In  addition,  there  are  more  cases  of  PML  reported  with  use  of  DMF  in 
multiple sclerosis. However, the risk cannot be directly extrapolated as the risk is probably different in 
patients with multiple sclerosis, where patients are treated with other immunomodulators and the risk 
acceptance for the occurrence of PML is different. Nevertheless this provides additional information to 
support the fact that occurrence of PML is an identified risk with use of DMF. 
In  addition,  the  long-term  safety  for  potential  significant  safety  concerns  of  serious  opportunistic 
infections  including  PML  and  malignancies  are  not  well  characterised  in  the  published  literature  for 
Fumaderm. In any case, the safety profile of Fumaderm cannot be directly attributed to the proposed 
DMF  product  because  of the  difference  in  the  therapeutic  moieties  as  Fumaderm  contains  DMF  and  3 
other  salts  of  monoethyl  fumarate.  Therefore  a  postmarketing  safety  study  will  be  conducted  to 
address the above deficiencies.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The  pivotal  study  has  demonstrated that  the  proposed  DMF  product  has  a  statistically  significant  and 
clinically  relevant  benefit  over  placebo  on  co-primary  endpoints  of  PASI75  (proportion  of  patients 
showing  >75%  reduction  in  baseline  PASI  score)  and  PGA  (greater  proportion  of  patients  who  had 
clear/almost clear) after 16 weeks of treatment. The beneficial effects were slow in onset and evidence 
from  literature  suggests  that  there  will  be  continued  improvement  beyond  week  16  week  with 
continued  treatment.  Similar  superiority  was  shown  on  other  secondary  endpoints  including  PASI  90 
(proportion of patients showing >90% reduction from baseline PASI score) and in the mean reduction 
of  the  affected  body  surface  area  from  baseline.  In  addition,  the  patients’  quality  of  life  improved 
significantly as compared to placebo. Moreover from literature it is seen that fumarates can be used for 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 103/108 
 
 
 
 
 
both induction and long-term maintenance treatment of psoriasis and there are reports of successfully 
managing psoriasis with fumarates over a period of a number of years with acceptable tolerability.  
With  regard  to  safety,  the  study  showed  that  common  adverse  events  were  gastrointestinal  (GI) 
disorders (diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, constipation, flatulence), flushing, 
erythema,  pruritus,  skin  burning  sensation,  fatigue, decreased  appetite,  haematological  abnormalities 
(lymphopenia,  eosinophilia,  leukopenia)  and  increase  in  hepatic  enzymes.  Twenty  four  percent  of  the 
patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events. However, most events were resolved following 
treatment  discontinuation.  Furthermore  these  events  are  easily  detected  by  clinical  monitoring  or  lab 
investigations and have generally not led to clinically unacceptable sequelae. There is some uncertainty 
on  the  rates  of  these  events  as  a  range  of  incidence  rates  have  been  reported  in  literature. 
Nevertheless,  this  uncertainty  is  acceptable  due  to  the  fact  that  these  can  be  monitored  by  routine 
investigations  and  development  of  undesirable  clinical  consequences  can  be  prevented.  Appropriate 
information to the prescriber in order to control these risks is given in the SmPC. 
While lymphopenia is quite common and this could be a risk factor for serious opportunistic infections, 
the  number  of  events  of  serious  infection  including  PML  is  low  as  seen  from  published  literature 
(especially  considering  the  number  of  years  of  use  of  fumarates).  However,  compared  to  the  high 
incidence of lymphopenia reported with fumarate use, the number of cases of serious infections is very 
low.  Further,  it  is  seen  that  after  stopping treatment,  the lymphocyte  counts gradually  increased  and 
moreover  the  persistent  decreased  lymphocyte  count  did  not  result  in  clinically  significant  adverse 
events in the study 1102 or as seen from literature. 
The number of cases of PML with use of fumarates in psoriasis patients that is reported in literature is 
low  (n=8)  with  one  case  report  of  fatality  and  one  case  report  of  ‘recovery  with  sequelae’.  This  is  in 
comparison to  the  reported  mortality  rate  of  30-50%  within  first  three  months  of  diagnosis, if  PML  is 
not  managed.  Therefore,  from  the  case-reports  it  is  seen  that  the  PML  cases  after  treatment  with 
fumarates were manageable and the unacceptable consequences can be limited. It is acknowledged by 
the  nature  of  the  reports,  the  reliability  of  the  total  cases  of  PML  with  use  of  fumarates  in  psoriatic 
patients  and  the  uncertainty  on  the  total  exposure  of  patients  for  this  incidence  rate,  no  reliable 
estimate on the incidence rate of this significant clinical event cannot be currently estimated.  
The  risk  of  PML  with  other  DMF  containing  products  was  reviewed  recently  by  CHMP  and  appropriate 
recommendations  for  monitoring  and  treatment initiation,  maintenance  &  discontinuation  were  made. 
The  applicant  has  taken  in  to  consideration  these  recommendations  and  proposed  appropriate  risk 
mitigation  measures  including  educational  materials  for  the  healthcare  professionals.  Considering  the 
implementation  of  these  risk  minimization  measures,  regular  monitoring  and  treatment  withdrawal 
(please  see  SmPC),  the  risk  of  increased  incidence  of  PML  with  use  of  fumarates  is  considered 
acceptable given the current knowledge of its rate of incidence. 
On efficacy and safety parameters, DMF (Skilarence) was shown overall to have a comparable effect to 
Fumaderm  (which  contains  DMF  in  the  same  quantities  as  in  this  proposed  product  and  additionally 
contains 3 other salts of monoethyl fumarate). Although a conclusion on non-inferiority to Fumaderm 
cannot  be  reliably  drawn  based  on  the  data  of  the  pivotal  study,  supporting  literature  suggests  that 
DMF  is  the  main  active  component  with  respect  to  its  efficacy  and  safety  profile  in  psoriasis  which 
explains the comparability of the two products observed in study 1102. Further the dossier has shown 
the  systemic  exposure  of  the  active  metabolite  of  DMF  is  comparable  between  the  proposed  product 
and Fumaderm, although bioequivalence was not demonstrated.  
Literature shows that Fumaderm and other DMF containing products maintain efficacy with long term 
treatment for periods greater than 24 months. Some studies suggest that the peak treatment benefits 
need  treatment  duration  of  1  year.  The  prospective,  open-label  study  by  Linjen  et  al,  2016, 
Assessment report  
EMA/412737/2017  
Page 104/108 
 
 
 
 
investigated  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  DMF  monotherapy.  Median  treatment  duration  was  28 
months. DMF monotherapy reduced PGA  from 3.3/5 to 1.6/5 in 122 patients (69%) that reached the 
median maintenance dose of 480 mg/day after a median of 8 months. 
The  uncommon/rare/very  rare/frequency  unknown  events  based  on  safety  information  available  with 
Fumaderm  include  proteinuria,  increased  serum  creatinine,  renal  failure,  serious  opportunistic 
infections  especially  PML  and  Fanconi  syndrome.  Although  the  safety  profile  indicates  potential  for 
renal  and  hepatic  injury  as  well  as  haematological  abnormalities  which  may  have  potential  serious 
consequences  of  infection,  it  has  been  shown  with  Fumaderm  that  these  have  been  managed  by 
regular  monitoring  and  treatment  withdrawal  as  appropriate.  Given  the  extent  of  comparability 
between  Skilarence  and  Fumaderm  that  was  presented  in  this  dossier  (comparative  PK,  efficacy  & 
safety data) and overall evidence to suggest that DMF is the main substance for the efficacy and safety 
in  psoriasis,  this  evidence  on  long-term  maintenance  of  efficacy  and  safety  with  Fumaderm  is 
considered relevant and supportive of Skilarence, at least in broad terms. 
Because of the small dataset with this product there are remaining uncertainties on the incidence of 
safety events. Also supporting information on potentially serious safety concerns such as malignancy 
and increased risk of serious opportunistic infections including PML on long-term use with other DMF 
containing products is sparse. Whereas the risks can be managed by appropriate warnings and 
recommendations included in the SmPC further characterisation of Skilarence in terms of uncommon, 
rare and very rare events (with respect to frequency, severity and any potential differences from other 
DMF containing products including Fumaderm) in the post authorisation phase will be done by means 
of a Post-authorisation safety study (PASS) as outlined in the RMP. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Short-term  efficacy  of  Skilarence  is  considered  to  have  been  convincingly  demonstrated  in 
comparison to placebo. All 3 primary objectives of the pivotal study in moderate to severe chronic 
plaques psoriasis at week 16 were met.  
The long-term maintenance of efficacy with continued treatment comes from published literature 
of DMF containing products (mainly Fumaderm).  
There  are  some  uncertainties  for  the  proposed  DMF  product  in  that  although  comparability  to 
Fumaderm  has  been  shown  a  strict bioequivalence  has  not  been  demonstrated  nor  is  it  required 
for  an  Article  8(3)  application.  However,  any  impact  is  likely  to  be  only  on  some  numerical 
differences in effect size and a major difference in effects is not anticipated, as these effects have 
been  demonstrated  consistently  by  different  DMF  containing  formulations  in  literature  and 
sufficient  comparability  between  Skilarence  and  Fumaderm  have  been  demonstrated  in  the 
studies submitted in this dossier. 
The safety profile of Skilarence after 16 weeks of treatment has been characterised and has been 
shown to be comparable to that of Fumaderm in study 1102. The majority of TEAEs were of mild 
to  moderate  intensity.  The  common  adverse  events  included  gastrointestinal  (GI)  disorders 
(diarrhoea,  abdominal  pain,  nausea,  vomiting,  dyspepsia,  constipation,  flatulence),  flushing, 
erythema,  pruritus,  skin  burning  sensation, 
fatigue,  decreased  appetite,  haematological 
abnormalities (lymphopenia, eosinophilia, leukopenia) and increase in hepatic enzymes. The most 
common reasons for treatment discontinuation were GI disturbances and flushing.

Most  of  the  reported  adverse  events  resolved  without  sequelae.  More  importantly  most  of  these 
events  are  easily  identified  clinically  or  by  laboratory  monitoring  and  patients  can  be 
appropriately  managed  including  measures  of  treatment  withdrawal.  These  measures  prevent 
development of unacceptable clinical consequences.  
The  long-term  safety  profile  with  continued  treatment  comes  from  published  literature  of 
Fumaderm.  The  significant  clinical  adverse  events  that  have  been  reported  with  treatment  of 
fumarates  in  psoriasis include  serious  opportunistic  infections  like  PML.  However,  the  risk  can  be 
mitigated by monitoring for lymphopenia and stopping treatment when appropriate.  
It  is  also  considered  that  fumarates  may  have  the  potential to  increase the  incidence  of  rare but 
clinically  significant  events  like  renal  damage,  malignancies  and  other  serious  infections. 
However, the numbers of case reports are very low in comparison to the extent of use and these 
potential risks are yet to be confirmed despite a number of years of clinical use of fumarates. To 
address  the  identified  risk  of  PML  and  the  uncertainties  with  regards  the  incidence  rate  of  PML 
and  other  serious  infections  as  well  as  the  incidence  of  other  potential  rare  adverse  events,  the 
applicant is committed to conduct a PASS. This is considered adequate.  
Based on the overall evidence of benefits, which are clearly significant and meaningful for a 
significant proportion of the treated patients and the known safety profile which can generally be 
monitored and appropriate risk mitigation measures can be used including treatment withdrawal 
to successfully prevent unacceptable clinical consequences, the benefit-risk balance of Skilarence 
in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis is considered to be positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Skilarence is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Skilarence is favourable in the following indication: 
Skilarence is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults in need of 
systemic medicinal therapy. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2).

updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Skilarence in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must 
agree about the content and format of the educational programme, including communication media, 
distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent 
Authority.  
The objectives of the educational programme are to inform health care professionals about the risk of 
serious infections, mainly opportunistic infections such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML), and to provide guidance on the monitoring of lymphocyte and leukocyte count abnormalities.  
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Skilarence is marketed, healthcare 
professionals who are expected to prescribe and dispense Skilarence have access to the following 
educational package.  
•  The guide for healthcare professionals shall contain the following key elements: 
o  Relevant information on PML (e.g. seriousness, severity, frequency, time to onset, 
reversibility of the AE as applicable) 
o  Details of the population at higher risk for PML

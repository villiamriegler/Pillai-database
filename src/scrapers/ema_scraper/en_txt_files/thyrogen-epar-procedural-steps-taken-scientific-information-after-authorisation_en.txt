SmPC, Annex 
Following two reports of stroke in women after Thyrogen 
II and PL 
administration and an additional earlier similar report, the 
Product Information was updated to include stroke as an 
Adverse Drug Reaction of Thyrogen. As all reports came 
from the post-marketing setting, the frequency of stroke 
can only be indirectly inferred, but it is expected that 
stroke only occurs very rarely after Thyrogen 
administration. 
as an adverse reaction based on post-marketing 
data. The PL and the RMP have been updated 
accordingly. In addition, minor changes were made 
to sections 4.4 and 5.3 of the SmPC and to the PL to 
improve comprehension of the document, the PSUR 
statement was deleted from Annex II, the list of local 
representatives in the PL was updated and changes 
were made throughout the PI to bring it in line with 
the latest version of QRD template (v 7.3.1, March 
2010).

The scope of this variation is to extend the ablation 
of thyroid tissue remnants indication of Thyrogen 
from low risk patients to patients who have 
undergone a near-total or total thyroidectomy for 
well-differentiated thyroid cancer and who do not 
have evidence of distant metastatic thyroid cancer. 
As a consequence, changes were made to sections 
4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics. Annex II has been updated to 
include the agreed version of the RMP and the 
change to the PSUR cycle. Minor editorial changes

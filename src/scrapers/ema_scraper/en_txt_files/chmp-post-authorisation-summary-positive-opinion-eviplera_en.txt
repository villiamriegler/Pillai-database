Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Eviplera 
EMTRICITABINE / RILPIVIRINE / TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL 
On 24 October 2013 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product Eviplera. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Gilead Sciences 
International Ltd. They may request a re-examination of the CHMP opinion, provided that they notify 
the European Medicines Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
The CHMP adopted a change to the indication as follows: 
"Eviplera is indicated for the treatment of adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 
(HIV-1) without known mutations associated with resistance to the non-nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) class, tenofovir or emtricitabine, and with a viral load ≤100,000 
HIV-1 RNA copies/mL (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
As with other antiretroviral medicinal products, genotypic resistance testing and/or historical 
resistance data should guide the use of Eviplera (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).". 
Detailed conditions for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after the variation to the 
marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 
within 44 days (Type II variations) and 67 days (Annex II applications) from adoption of the opinion.

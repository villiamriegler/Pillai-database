Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for semaglutide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on angioedema from clinical trials and spontaneous reports including in some 
cases a close temporal relationship and a positive de-challenge, the PRAC considers a causal 
relationship between s.c. semaglutide and angioedema is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC 
concluded that the product information of products containing s.c. semaglutide (Ozempic) should be 
amended accordingly.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for semaglutide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing semaglutide is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

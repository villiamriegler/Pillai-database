Vyxeos  liposomal  is  approved  for  the  treatment  of  adults  with  newly-diagnosed  therapy-related  acute 
myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The MAH is proposing the following extension of the approved AML indication: the treatment of relapsed or 
refractory AML in paediatric and young adult patients aged 1 to 21 years old. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Acute myeloid leukaemia is a form of leukaemia – i.e., cancer of the white blood cells – characterised by 
infiltration  of  proliferative,  clonal,  abnormally  differentiated,  and  occasionally  poorly  differentiated 
haematopoietic cells of myeloid lineage in the bone marrow, blood, and other tissues. 
In AML, leukaemic blasts replace normal blood cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood, which leads to 
anaemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. This is associated with symptoms of fatigue, shortness of 
breath, disturbed wound healing, infections and bleedings. If left untreated, AML results in death within a 
few weeks to months. 
AMLs are classified according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) classification from 2001, revised in 
2008 and in 2016 (2). The classification incorporates morphological criteria, cytogenetic data, molecular 
genetics, immunophenotype data and clinical information into a diagnostic algorithm to delineate clinically 
significant disease entities. 
Management 
Leukaemia  accounts  for  approximately  30%  of  all  paediatric  malignancies,  of  which  15–20%  comprises 
AML. Long-term survival rates of pediatric AML patients are currently 70% or even higher. Compared to 
adults, children with AML have superior outcomes due to fewer adverse genetic mutations and the ability 
to  tolerate  the  high-intensity  chemotherapy  currently  necessary  for  cure.  Regarding  novel  agents  and 
treatment  modalities,  drugs  such  as  venetoclax,  monoclonal  antibodies,  and  cellular  therapies  are 
investigated in AML.  
Assessment report  
EMA/665588/2022 
Page 8/96 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment decisions, namely the need for hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in pediatric AML 
are primarily driven by genetic risk classification which is quickly evolving. However, in 24 - 40% of children 
the  AML  relapses,  with  a  probability  of  long-term  survival  of  approximately  40%.  These  poor  outcomes 
indicate the need for improved treatment, including innovative drugs and treatment modalities. Due to a 
relatively small patient population, studies on pediatric relapsed AML mostly consist of case reports and 
only a few large cohort-based studies have been performed.  
For  patients  who  relapse,  or  are  refractory  to  first-line  therapy,  there  is  a  limited  number  of  effective 
therapeutic agents available. Optimal treatment for paediatric relapsed AML is not well defined, regarding 
optimal chemotherapy, the need for allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT), the timing of an allo-HSCT and risk group 
stratified  treatment  based  on  prognostic  factors.  However,  allo-HSCT  in  the  second  complete  remission 
after  reinduction  chemotherapy  is  associated  with  better  outcome  than  chemotherapy  only,  and  once  a 
paediatric patient relapses, working towards an allo-HSCT is currently a rule. 
1.3.2.  About the product 
Vyxeos liposomal is a liposomal formulation of a fixed combination of daunorubicin and cytarabine in a 1:5 
molar ratio. The 1:5 molar ratio has been shown in vitro and in vivo to maximise synergistic antitumour 
activity in AML. 
Daunorubicin  has  antimitotic  and  cytotoxic  activity,  which  is  achieved  by  forming  complexes  with  DNA, 
inhibiting  topoisomerase  II  activity,  inhibiting  DNA  polymerase  activity,  affecting  regulation  of  gene 
expression, and producing DNA-damaging free radicals.  
Cytarabine is a cell cycle phase-specific antineoplastic agent, affecting cells only during the S-phase of cell 
division.  Intracellularly,  cytarabine  is  converted  into  cytarabine-5-triphosphate  (ara-CTP),  which  is  the 
active metabolite. The mechanism of action is not completely understood, but it appears that ara-CTP acts 
primarily  through  inhibition  of  DNA  synthesis.  Incorporation  into  DNA  and  RNA  may  also  contribute  to 
cytarabine cytotoxicity. Cytarabine is cytotoxic to proliferating mammalian cells in culture. 
Based  on  data  in  animals,  Vyxeos  liposomes  accumulate  and  persist  in  high  concentration  in  the  bone 
marrow, where they are preferentially taken up intact by leukaemia cells in an active engulfment process. 
In  leukaemia-bearing  mice,  the  liposomes  are  taken  up  by  leukaemia  cells  to  a  greater  extent  than  by 
normal  bone  marrow  cells.  After  internalisation,  Vyxeos  liposomes  undergo  degradation,  releasing 
daunorubicin and cytarabine within the intracellular environment, enabling the medicinal products to exert 
their synergistic antineoplastic activity.  
The currently approved indication is the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed therapy-related acute 
myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC).  
1.3.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
No  scientific  advice  was  given  by  CHMP  with  regard  to  paediatric  studies  CPX-MA-1201,  AAML1421  and 
1831. 
A paediatric investigational plan (PIP) for CPX-351 (EMA-001858-PIP01-15) was approved on 23 June 2018 
(P/0200/2017).  There  have  been  3  PIP  modifications  submitted  to  the  EMA.  The  current  PIP  strategy 
Assessment report  
EMA/665588/2022

includes  Study  CPX-MA-1201,  and  Study  AAML1421,  which  are  both  included  in  this  application.  It  also 
includes a newly initiated paediatric Study 1831 in paediatrics patients with newly-diagnosed AML. 
1.3.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
No  scientific  advice  was  given  by  CHMP  with  regard  to  paediatric  studies  CPX-MA-1201,  AAML1421  and 
1831. 
A paediatric investigational plan (PIP) for CPX-351 (EMA-001858-PIP01-15) was approved on 23 June 2018 
(P/0200/2017).  There  have  been  3  PIP  modifications  submitted  to  the  EMA.  The  current  PIP  strategy 
includes  Study  CPX-MA-1201,  and  Study  AAML1421,  which  are  both  included  in  this  application.  It  also 
includes a newly initiated paediatric Study 1831 in paediatrics patients with newly-diagnosed AML. 
A PIP compliance report was approved by PDCO 29.1.2021 (EMA/656343/2020). 
1.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
1.4.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH submitted an updated ERA for Vyxeos liposomal according to the active CHMP “Guideline on the 
Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” and the Questions and Answers on 
the  Guideline  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  corr2,  2006;  EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010  Rev.,  2016).  It 
includes both active components of Vyxeos liposomal (cytarabine and daunorubicin) and updates regarding 
the dosing regimen in adults and the addition of the paediatric population to include the sought paediatric 
indication in relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML. 
Phase I: Estimation of Exposure 
Screening for Persistence, Bioaccumulation, and Toxicity 
The  octanol-water  partition  coefficient  (log  Kow  log  P)  of  cytarabine  was  determined  by  the  shake-flask 
method. The log Kow of cytarabine at 21°C, determined for 3 different water:octanol ratios from 0.5 to 2 
using  the  shake  flask  method,  was  determined  to  be  -2.02  ±  0.04.  For  daunorubicin,  the  experimental 
value of log Kow reported in the literature is 1.83. The experimental log Kow values for the drug substances 
cytarabine  and  daunorubicin  are  below  4.5;  therefore,  further  screening is  not  considered necessary  for 
persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity. 
Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) 
Only a maximum number of doses of Vyxeos liposomal can be received over a lifetime by adult patients 
(n=9 doses), and by children and adolescent patients (n=3 doses) according to the approved and proposed 
labelling. The use of daunorubicin (and other anthracycline preparations) as monotherapy is also limited 
Assessment report  
EMA/665588/2022 
Page 10/96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
primarily due to the intrinsic cardiotoxicity associated with daunorubicin, one of Vyxeos liposomal active 
components.  Therefore,  the  fraction  of  market  penetration  (Fpen)  calculations  accounts  for  the  limited 
number  of  doses  that  can  be  received  by  patients  over  their  lifetime.  The  predicted  environmental 
concentration (PEC) was calculated for each of the active components (cytarabine and daunorubicin) for 
the adults and children/adolescent patient populations separately, and was then be summed to obtain the 
overall PEC. The Fpen was refined based on prevalence of the disease and treatment regime among each 
patient population. 
Adult Patients 
The approved regimen for Vyxeos liposomal is 44 mg/m2 daunorubicin and 100 mg/m2 cytarabine on days 
1, 3, and 5 for the first induction; 44 mg/m2 daunorubicin and 100 mg/m2 cytarabine on days 1 and 3, for 
the second induction; and 29 mg/m2 daunorubicin and 65 mg/m2 cytarabine on days 1 and 3 for up to 2 
consolidation  cycles.  The  maximum  lifetime  number  of  doses  in  adults  is  9  (5  induction  doses  and  4 
consolidation doses), corresponding to a total maximum lifetime dose of 336 mg/m2 daunorubicin and 760 
mg/m2  cytarabine.  Using  a  maximum  body  surface  area  of  2.5  m2  these  doses  correspond  to  840  mg 
daunorubicin and 1900 mg cytarabine. 
Fpen Calculation 
Fpen  was  calculated  using  the  formula  given  in  EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010  Rev.,  2016  and  yearly 
incidence of disease (39881 cases in 2017, a conservative assumption that includes all adult AML patients).  
Fpen Daunorubicin = 1.9 x 10-6 
Fpen Cytarabine = 1.9 x 10-6 
PECSW Calculation 
Because the doses used for the induction and consolidation cycles are different, the defined daily dose is 
the average of the maximum total dose (i.e., induction plus consolidation) divided by the maximum total 
of  dosing  days  (for  daunorubicin  840  mg/9  days  =  93.3  mg/day  and  for  cytarabine  1900  mg/9  days  = 
211.1 mg/day). 
Using the formula given in EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2: 
PECSW Daunorubicin = 0.000090 µg/L 
PECSW Cytarabine = 0.00020 µg/L 
Paediatric Patients 
In children and adolescents, the regimen consists of a single induction cycle with 59 mg/m2 daunorubicin 
and  135  mg/m2  cytarabine  on  days  1,  3,  and  5.  Therefore,  the  maximum  number  of  lifetime  doses  in 
children is 3 (3 induction doses) for a maximum total dose of 177 mg/m2 daunorubicin and 405 mg/m2 
cytarabine. Assuming a body surface area of 2 m2 the maximum daily doses on dosing days are 118 mg 
daunorubicin and 270 mg cytarabine. 
Fpen Calculation 
Fpen  was  calculated  using  the  formula  given  in  EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010  Rev.,  2016  and  yearly 
incidence of disease (R/R paediatric AML yearly incidence is estimated to a maximum of 40% of 2 cases 
per  million  inhabitants,  or  approximately  410  cases  per  year  and  a  conservative  assumption  that  all 
paediatric R/R AML patients take Vyxeos liposomal).

Fpen Cytarabine = 6.6 x 10-9 
PECSW Calculation 
Because the doses used for the induction cycles in children are constant, it corresponds to the defined daily 
dose. 
Using the formula given in EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2: 
PECSW Daunorubicin = 0.00000039 µg/L 
PECSW Cytarabine = 0.00000089 µg/L 
Daunorubicin Use with Other Patients 
The  QuintilesIMS  database  search  provided  an  estimate  of  daunorubicin  use  (in  mg)  from  23  different 
European Union countries for 2Q2017. The QuintilesIMS used data for daunorubicin for 1 quarter (37390 
mg),  which  was  then  multiplied  by  4  in order  to  predict  the  yearly  use  of  daunorubicin  (149560  mg)  in 
medicinal  products  other  than  Vyxeos  liposomal.  Based  on  the  SmPC  for  Cerubidin  20  mg  Powder  for 
Solution for Injection (daunorubicin hydrochloride), daunorubicin is used for the induction of remission in 
acute lymphoblastic or lymphatic leukaemias (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemias (AML). The maximum 
lifetime  cumulative  dose  for  daunorubicin  is  550  mg/m2  due  to  the  potential  for  cardiotoxicity.  Per  the 
SmPC, the recommended daily dose in adults is 45 mg/m2 and the maximum dose is 60 mg/m2. Assuming 
a  body  surface  area  of  2.5  m2  the  recommended  and  maximum  doses  are  112  mg  and  150  mg  of 
daunorubicin, respectively for one treatment day. 
Fpen Calculation 
Fpen was calculated using the formula given in EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev., 2016, the daily dose of 
45 mg/m2 and consumption of 149560 mg/year.  
Fpen Daudorubicin = 1.1 x 10-8. 
PECSWr Calculation 
Using the formula given in EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2: 
PECSW Daunorubicin = 0.0000006 µg/L. 
Total PECsurfacewater 
PECSW Daunorubicin = PECSW for adults + PECSWr for children and adolescents + PECSWr for other use 
PECSW Daunorubicin = 0.000090 μg/L + 0.00000039 μg/L + 0.0000006 μg/L = 0.000091 
μg/L 
PECSW Cytarabine = PECSW for adults + PECSW for children and adolescents 
PECSW Cytarabine = 0.00020 μg/L + 0.00000089 μg/L = 0.00020 μg/L 
Therefore, the PECSW  for either drug substances are below the action limit threshold of 0.01 μg/L and a 
Phase II environmental-fate and effect analysis is not required.

1.4.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of daunorubicin and cytarabine. 
Considering the above data, daunorubicin and cytarabine are not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment.

1.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics in adults 
Non-liposomal cytarabine and daunorubicin have markedly different PK parameters from one another. In 
contrast,  when  administered  as  components  of  daunorubicin  and  cytarabine  powder  for  concentrate  for 
solution for infusion (referred to thereafter also as CPX-351 in this report), the PK parameters for cytarabine 
and  daunorubicin  are  similar  (Table  1).  The  convergence  of  PK  parameters  suggests  that  most  of  the 
cytarabine  and  daunorubicin  in  the  circulation  remains  trapped  within  the  liposomes  that  are  slowly 
eliminated.  Therefore,  the  measured  PK  parameters  for  cytarabine  and  daunorubicin  following  CPX-351 
administration  mostly  reflect  the  PK  of  the  liposomes.  Small  volume  of  distribution  (~7  litres  in  adults) 
indicates that the liposomes are highly confined in the vascular space. The accumulation ratio is 1.3 and 
1.4 for daunorubicin and cytarabine, respectively, following IV administration at days 1, 3, and 5, consistent 
with the elimination half-lives.

Pharmacokinetics in the paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetics of Vyxeos in the paediatric and young adult population (age 1 to 21 years old, inclusive) 
were investigated in two clinical trials (CPX-MA-1201 and AAML1421). For both studies, the MAH was not 
involved in study conduct, but has received the data from the Sponsors and summarized the results of the 
study for the purposes of regulatory submission. The studies are described in detail in section 5.4 Clinical 
efficacy of this AR. The PK results are summarised below. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis in individual paediatric studies 
In study 1201, the PK Analysis Set included all subjects who received at least 1 infusion of CPX-351 and 
had at least 1 evaluable PK concentration. This analysis set was used for all descriptive PK summaries.  
In study 1421, the PK population includes all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug 
treatment and provided enough PK samples to estimate at least one PK parameter. The PK analysis was 
performed using the PK population. 
Plasma concentration data used in the PK analyses corresponded to “total” concentrations of cytarabine or 
daunorubicin,  where  “total”  corresponds  to  the  sum  of  encapsulated  drug  (ie,  drug  retained  within  the 
liposomes) plus free drug (i., drug released from the liposomes). Given that >99% of the cytarabine and 
daunorubicin in the circulation remains encapsulated within the CPX-351 liposomes (see initial marketing 
authorisation application assessment report), PK analyses based on total plasma concentrations basically 
describe the plasma kinetics of the encapsulated drugs. The MAH considers PK based on encapsulated drugs 
relevant  to  clinical  benefits,  because  uptake  of  intact  liposomes  by  leukemia  cells  is  central  to  the 
mechanism of action for CPX-351 in antileukemic effects. 
Plasma concentration-time profiles were generated for cytarabine and daunorubicin for each subject. All 
plasma PK parameter calculations were performed using actual or nominal times (when actual time was 
not  available),  calculated  relative  to  the  start  of  study  drug  infusion  in  hours.  Concentration  values  of 
plasma cytarabine and daunorubicin that were reported as below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) were set 
to zero for PK parameter calculation and concentration summary statistics. 
PK  parameters  were  determined  using  non-compartmental  (NCA)  methods  based  on  individual  plasma 
concentration-time  data  for  cytarabine  and  daunorubicin  following  Day  5  CPX-351  administration.  PK 
parameters were estimated from the plasma concentration-time profile of all evaluable subjects using non-
compartmental methods in Phoenix WinNonlin 7.0 (Pharsight, St. Louis, MO, USA).  
Study CPX-MA-1201 
Study  CPX-MA-1201  was  a  phase  1  pilot  study  to  assess  the  PK,  toxicity  and  tolerability  of  CPX-351  in 
paediatric and young adult patients (age 1 to 21 years old, inclusive) with relapsed / refractory hematologic 
malignancies. This study was conducted in two phases: Dose Exploration Phase and Expanded Phase (Table 
2).

Blood  samples  for  the  determination  of  the  concentrations  of  plasma  cytarabine  and  daunorubicin  were 
collected following Day 5 infusion, as follows: at predose (0), 45 min, 90 min (end of infusion), 2, 5, 8, 12, 
24, 72 and 120 h post start of CPX-351 infusion. 
A total of 27 patients were enrolled and included in the PK analysis. No doses were missed on Day 1, Day 
3 and Day 5. 
At Day 5, peak plasma concentrations of cytarabine and daunorubicin were observed at the end of or soon 
after the end of infusion. Measurable concentrations were observed until the end of PK follow-up (120 hours 
after dosing) for both analytes (Figure 1). The PK parameters for cytarabine and daunorubicin (calculated 
using noncompartmental analyses) are summarized in Table 3.

cytarabine:daunorubicin (C:D) AUC0-48 for the 100 units/m2 dose was 7.95 (CV 37.2%). A similar value was 
observed  for  the  134  units/m2  dose  (7.03;  CV  23.3%).  GeoMean  molar  ratios  for  AUC0-48 were  slightly 
lower,  and  closer  to  the  expected  5:1  C:D  ratio,  during  the  Expanded  Phase  for  the  100  units/m2  dose

Study AAML1421 
This study comprised 2 phases: Dose-finding Phase (n=6) and an Efficacy Phase (total n=32). All patients 
received a dose of 135 units/m2 CPX-351. 
Frequent plasma PK samples were collected in the Dose-finding Phase at the following times: Day 5: pre-
dose, and 45 minutes, 90 minutes, 2, 5, 8, 12, 24, 72 and 120 hours after the start of the infusion. For one 
subject (#861842, the dose record was not consistent with treatment plan and other treatment record and 
the data were excluded from PK summary statistics. 
Sparse plasma PK samples were collected in the Efficacy Phase in 22 patients at the following times: Cycle 
1, Day 1: 2 hours after the start of the infusion; Day 5: pre-dose, 2 and 6 hours and 72 hours (± 24 hours) 
after the start of the Day 5 infusion. 
The observed PK data are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 4.

Report  JAZP-PMX-CPX351-1032_PPK:  Population  PK  Analysis  of  CPX-351  (Liposomal  Cytarabine  and 
Daunorubicin)  in  Children,  Adolescents  and  Young  Adults  with  Recurrent  or  Refractory  Hematologic 
Malignancies (2020-Jul-14) 
Objectives 
The  objective  was  to  perform  a  population  PK  analysis  of  cytarabine  and  daunorubicin  in  children, 
adolescents  and  young  adults  with  AML  in  study  AAML1421  and  CPX-MA-1201  and  assess  sources  of 
variability in exposure. The analysis was performed to support dosing in paediatric patients with AML. 
The final population PK models were subsequently used for exposure response modelling. 
Methods 
The  dataset  included  information  from  paediatric  studies  AAML1421  and  CPX-MA-1201  and  previously 
conducted  adult  studies  101,  206  and  301.  Individual  concentration  values  were  excluded  from  the 
population  PK  analysis  if  the  actual  collection  time  was  not  available  or  was  evidently  inaccurate,  if  the 
value corresponded to measurable drug in a Day 1 pre-dose sample, or (in rare cases) if inclusion of the 
value prohibited the PK model from providing a covariance matrix. Plasma concentrations below the limit 
of quantification (BLQ) of the assay were flagged and set to missing. All concentrations excluded from the

PK analysis were retained in the dataset and reasons for the exclusions were documented. Concentration 
data were log-transformed before the population PK analysis. 
Prior  cytarabine  and  daunorubicin  population  PK  models  developed  for  adult  patients  with  hematologic 
malignancies were used as initial models; the models were developed using data from studies 101, 206 
and 301.  
The prior model for cytarabine was a 2-compartment model, with an OMEGA block on CL and central volume 
of distribution (Vc), a residual error model (log additive with ETA), and an allometric model of BSA on CL, 
Vc, peripheral clearance (Q), and peripheral volume of distribution (Vp). The CL, Vc, and Vp were mainly 
dependent  upon  BSA.  The  effect  of  bilirubin  on  CL  was  statistically  significant,  but  the  relationship  was 
shallow,  with  an  exponent  of  0.197.  Dose,  formulation,  and  other  intrinsic  covariates  did  not  exert  a 
significant effect on the PK parameters. 
The prior model for daunorubicin was a 2-compartment model, with an OMEGA block on PK parameters 
(CL, Vc, Q, and Vp), a residual error model (log additive with ETA); and an allometric model of BSA on CL, 
Vc, Q, and Vp was previously used to assess the concentration-time profiles of daunorubicin in adult patients 
with hematologic malignancies. The CL, Vc, and Vp of daunorubicin were mainly dependent upon BSA. The 
model also included an effect of bilirubin on CL and formulation (frozen) effect on all PK parameters (CL, 
Vc, Q, and Vp). 
In the first step, data from the paediatric studies (CPX-MA-1201 and AAML142) were included in the dataset 
and population PK parameters were re-estimated using the prior models. In the second step, residual effects 
of  age  were  explored  (after  taking  into  account  differences  in  BSA  by  including  BSA  as  a  covariate  for 
clearance and volume parameters) and the effect of age was formally evaluated within the models. 
Modelling  was  performed  using  (FOCE  and/or  the  mu-referencing  method  (SAEM/IMP  methods  with  ITS 
pre-estimation  if  possible)  in  NONMEM  (Version  VII  [Level  7.4];  ICON  plc,  Dublin,  Ireland).  Data  set 
preparation, exploration, and visualization of the data will be performed using the statistical package in R 
(Version  3.5.2).  Perl-Speak-NONMEM  (PsN,  Version  4.4.8)  was  used  for  modeling,  stepwise  analysis  of 
covariates, and visual predictive checks (VPC). 
Results 
A total of 250 patients with AML were included in the analysis. The population included a total of 46 (18.4%) 
paediatric patients (1-17 years) and 204 (81.6%) adults (≥ 18 years). Overall, 22 (8.8%), 10 (4.0%) and 
14 (5.6%) patients were in age category 1-5 years, 6-11 years and 12-17 years, respectively. The median 
age (range) in study CPX-MA-1201 and AAML1421 were 5.0 years (1 to 19 years) and 13.0 years (1 to 21 
years), respectively. The median (range) BSA in study CPX-MA-1201 and AAML1421 were 0.74 m2 (0.44 
to 2.09 m2) and 1.55 m2 (0.45 to 2.75 m2), respectively. Overall, the PK population included 148 (59.2%) 
male and 102 (40.8%) female patients, mainly of white origin (82.4%). All paediatric patients received the 
lyophilized formulation of CPX-351. 
Cytarabine 
Of 2614 samples assayed for cytarabine, a total of 2490 (95.3%) were included in the PK analysis. Most of 
the excluded samples (64; 2.4%) were BLQ first predose; only 19 (0.7%) were BLQ post dose. 
The  concentration-time  profile  of  cytarabine  declined  in  a  bi-exponential  manner.  Using  the  previously 
developed model (run001), the PK parameters were robustly estimated with RSE values less than 20%. 
However, the goodness-of-fit (GOF) plots suggested that the population predictions (PRED) over-estimated 
the  observed  concentrations  in  children  and  young  adults  (CPX-MA-1201  and  AAML1421)  and  under-
estimated the observed concentrations in adults.

A  covariate  analysis  was  performed  to  assess  the  potential  effects  of  age  as  categorical  and  continuous 
covariates. In addition, populations defined as children, adolescents and young adults (CPX-MA-1201 and 
AAML1421) vs adults were evaluated with and without age effects. Results of the covariate analysis are 
presented  in  Table  5.  A  model  integrating  the  effect  of  populations  (run003)  defined  as  children, 
adolescents and young adults (CPX-MA-1201 and AAML1421) vs. adults (study 101, 206, and 301) resulted 
in the lowest reduction in objective function (ΔOFV = -21.3).

Typical population PK parameters of cytarabine derived with the final model are presented in Table 6. The 
population estimates of CL and Vc for cytarabine in adults were 0.101 L/h and 4.76 L, respectively. The 
population estimates of CL and Vc for cytarabine in children, adolescents and young adults were 0.0731 
L/h and 3.91 L, respectively. 
The  population  PK  model  included  an  allometric  component  that  accounted  for  differences  in  BSA.  The 
exponent for the effect of BSA on CL was 0.948 suggesting faster clearance in patients with higher BSA. 
For  example,  typical  patients  with  BSA  values  of  0.44  and  2.8  m2  (corresponding  to  the  minimum  and 
maximum in the population) would be expected to have CL values 75% lower and 44% higher, respectively 
(0.0252 and 0.146 L/h, respectively) relative to a typical subject with a BSA of 1.9 m2 (0.101 L/h). These 
differences in CL are expected to be offset by the BSA-based dosing of CPX-351. For example, relative to 
the dose administered in a typical subject with a BSA of 1.9 m2, doses administered to patients with BSA 
values  of  0.44  and  2.8  m2  would  be  77%  lower  and  47%  higher,  respectively.  As  expected,  BSA  was 
identified as statistically significant covariates describing the variability of Vc.

GOF plots for the whole population indicated that the model structure of run003 was appropriate (Figure 
3).    A  visual  predictive  check  (VPC)  of  predicted  vs.  observed  concentrations  of  cytarabine  in  children, 
adolescents  and  young  adults  (CPX-MA-1201  and  AAML1421)  and  in  adults  are  presented  in  Figure  4. 
Observed median and upper/lower 95th percentiles of cytarabine concentrations were contained within the 
model-predicted ranges, indicating that the model could reproduce the observed data.

Daunorubicin 
Of 2613 samples assayed for daunorubicin, a total of 2469 (94.5%) were included in the PK analysis. Most 
of the excluded samples (63; 2.4%) were BLQ first predose; only 39 (1.5%) were BLQ post dose. 
The  concentration-time  profile  of  daunorubicin  declined  in  a  bi-exponential  manner.  The  population  PK 
model previously developed in adults (run001) was used in a first step to assess the concentration-time 
profiles in this expanded dataset. Population PK parameters were robustly estimated with RSE values less 
than 20%. However, the GOF plots suggested that the population predictions (PRED) over-estimated the 
observed  concentrations  in  children,  adolescents  and  young  adults  (CPX-MA-1201  and  AAML1421)  and 
under-estimated the observed concentrations in adults. 
A  covariate  analysis  was  performed  to  assess  the  potential  effects  of  age  as  categorical  and  continuous 
covariates. In addition, populations defined as children, adolescents and young adults (CPX-MA-1201 and

presented  in  Table  7.  A  model  integrating  the  effect  of  populations  (run003)  defined  as  children, 
adolescents and young adults (CPX-MA-1201 and AAML1421) vs. adults (study 101, 206, and 301) resulted 
in the lowest reduction in objective function (ΔOFV = -11.2).

Typical population PK parameters of daunorubicin derived with the final model are presented in Table 8. 
The population estimates of CL and Vc for daunorubicin in adults were 0.140 L/h and 4.04 L, respectively. 
The  population  estimates  of  CL  and  Vc  for  daunorubicin  in  children,  adolescents  and  young  adults  were 
0.0932 L/h and 3.28 L, respectively. 
The  population  PK  model  included  an  allometric  component  that  accounted  for  differences  in  BSA.  The 
exponent  for  the  effect  of  BSA  was  0.876  suggesting  faster  clearance  in  patients  with  higher  BSA.  For 
example, CL values in typical patients with BSA values of 0.44 and 2.8 m2 (corresponding to the minimum 
and maximum in the population) would be expected to have CL values 72% lower and 40% higher (0.0389 
and 0.197 L/h, respectively) than a typical subject with a BSA of 1.90 m2 (0.140 L/h). These differences in 
CL are expected to be largely offset by BSA-based dosing of CPX-351. For example, relative to the dose 
administered to a typical subject with a BSA of 1.9 m2, doses administered to patients with BSA values of 
0.44 and 2.8 m2 would be expected to be 77% lower and 47% higher, respectively. In addition, bilirubin 
and  formulation  (frozen  vs  lyophilized)  remained  statistically  significant  covariates  on  the  CL  of 
daunorubicin. Patients treated with the frozen formulation that was used in early studies would be expected 
to  display  a  18%  lower  CL  relative  to  the  current  lyophilized  formulation  that  was  used  in  the  pediatric 
studies. BSA was identified as statistically significant covariate describing the variability of Vc, as expected.

Predicted exposures 
The final population PK models were used to derive post hoc estimates for PK parameters, simulated dense 
concentration-time  profiles  and  exposure  parameters  for  cytarabine  (Table  9)  and  daunorubicin  (Table 
10).  
The predicted exposure parameters (Cmax; AUC over 48 hours (AUC0-48); concentration at 48 hours after 
the  dose  (C48))  were  highly  correlated,  especially  AUC0-48  and  C48  but  also  Cmax  and  the  other  two 
parameters.

•  Exposure-response analyses  
Pharmacometrics  report:  Exposure-Response  Analysis  of  CPX-351  (Liposomal  Cytarabine  and 
Daunorubicin)  in  Children,  Adolescents  and  Young  Adults  with  Recurrent  or  Refractory  Hematologic 
Malignancies (JAZP-PMX-CPX351-1032_ER; 14-Jul-2020) 
The  objective  was  to  perform  exposure-response  (ER)  analysis  of  key  efficacy  and  safety  endpoints  in 
paediatric and young adult patients with AML treated with CPX-351. 
Exposure-Response Analysis of Efficacy  
Methods 
The dataset was constructed by combining data from children, adolescents and young adults (Studies CPX-
MA-1201 and AAML1421) and adult patients with relapsed and refractory AML (Studies 101 and 206). For 
Study 101, only therapeutic doses (i.e., approximately 100 and 134/135 units/m2) were included in the 
analysis.  The  following  exposure  parameters  of  cytarabine  and  daunorubicin  were  derived  based  on  a 
population PK model: 
•  Area under the curve up to 48 hours post dose on Day 5 Cycle 1 (AUC0-48) 
•  Maximum concentration on Day 5 Cycle 1 (Cmax) 
•  Concentration at 48 hours post dose on Day 5 Cycle 1 (C48) 
In addition, the observed predose concentration on Day 5, Cycle 1 (Cpredose) was also considered in the ER 
analysis. 
Exposure parameters were merged with the following response endpoints (see Table 5.3.4.5): 
•  Complete response (CR) 
•  CR + CRp (complete response with partial recovery of platelet count) 
•  CR + CRp + CRi (complete response with partial recovery of platelet count and incomplete blood 
count recovery) 
The following covariates were tested in efficacy analyses. 
•  Age, as

categorical (pediatric vs. adults): 1-17 vs. ≥18 years 
categorical (pediatric vs. young adults, adults and elderly): 18 to 29, 30 to < 60, and ≥60

A logistic regression model was developed to link cytarabine and/or daunorubicin exposures to response 
criteria. The model tested the effect of cytarabine and daunorubicin separately and for the combined effect 
assuming additive properties. Finally, the logistic regression model tested the combined effect of cytarabine 
and daunorubicin with an interaction term to potentially capture a less than or more than additive effect. 
The best fitting model according to Akaike information criterion (AIC) was selected.  
The statistical significance of covariates was tested in the logistic regression models with a p-value of 0.05. 
Data set preparation, exploration, visualization of the data and exposure-response analyses were performed 
using R (Version 3.5.2) with comprehensive R archive network (CRAN) and Certara Strategic Consulting 
(CSC) package. 
Results 
Dataset:  Exposure-response  analysis  of  efficacy  was  performed  based  on  response  criteria  in  children, 
adolescents and young adults (study CPX-MA-1201 and AAML1421) and adult patients with relapsed and 
refractory AML (study 101 and 206). A total of 81 patients were included in the analysis. The population 
included a total of 43 (53.1%) pediatric patients (1-17 years) and 38 (46.9%) adults (≥ 18 years). Baseline 
characteristics are summarized in Table 12 and Table 13). Of the 81 patients included in the analysis, a 
total  of  28  (30.9%)  patients  presented  CR,  16  (24.6%)  patients  presented  CRi  and  1  (1.92%)  patient 
presented CRp, while 39 (48.1%) presented a negative response (Table 14).

The probability of response (CR, CRi or CRp) as a function of the C48 of cytarabine on Day 5 is presented in 
Figure 7. The effect of cytarabine exposure (C48) on the probability of response was statistically significant 
(p=0.0144)  with  an  odds  ratio  of  1.057.  These  results  suggest  that  the  odds  of  response  increased  by 
approximately 5.7% for each 1 unit increment of cytarabine C48 (i.e., 1 μg/mL).

For both cytarabine and daunorubicin, model-predicted C48 and AUC0-48 were highly correlated with each 
other and both predicted parameters were highly correlated with the observed Day 5 predose concentration 
(Cpredose) as well (r=0.88 to r=0.95 for each comparison). Daunorubicin C48 and cytarabine and daunorubicin 
AUC0-48 and Cpredose were statistically significant predictors of response (CR, CRi or CRp).

Probability of (CR): Various exposure-response models were developed to assess the effect of cytarabine 
and/or daunorubicin exposures on the probability of response (CR) obtained in in all studies (Studies CPX-
MA-1201, AAML1421, 310-206 and 310-101). In all, 28 of 81 patients were classified as responders (CR). 
None of the exposure parameters of cytarabine or daunorubicin were statistically significantly associated 
with the probability of response (CR). 
Exposure-response analyses for safety 
Methods 
Exposure-response analysis of safety was performed based on data collected in all studies (0305-101, 310-
206,  310-301,  CPX-MA-1201  and  AAML1421).  The  exposure-safety  population  included  patients  with  at 
least 1 measurable concentration of cytarabine and daunorubicin on Day 5, Cycle 1. 
In a first step, treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) were merged with Cmax and classified according 
to the quartile of exposure for the overall safety population and for only pediatric patients in the safety 
population. Descriptive statistics were derived according to the following toxicity grade and severity. 
•  Adverse events grades (grades 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 according to NCI-CTC toxicity grade) 
•  Adverse events grade ≥3 (according to NCI-CTC toxicity grade) 
•  Serious treatment-emergent adverse events (SAE) 
Then, descriptive statistics were derived for adverse events (AEs) according to the “body system or organ 
class” (AEBODSYS, e.g., blood and lymphatic system disorders) and “dictionary derived” terms (AEDECOD, 
e.g., febrile neutropenia). Only AEs associated with a “definite” or “possible” causality with CPX-351 were 
included  in  the  analysis.  Based  on  the  descriptive  statistics  results,  key  AEs  were  selected  for  a  formal 
exposure-response analysis. Predicted exposure parameters of cytarabine and daunorubicin (AUC0-48, Cmax 
or C48 on Day 5, Cycle 1) were merged with AEs of interest.  
Logistic regression models were developed to link cytarabine and/or daunorubicin exposures to the above 
probability of AEs. 
Results 
The  exposure-safety  population  included  a  total  of  46  (18.5%)  pediatric  patients  (1-17  years)  and  204 
(81.5%) adults (≥ 18 years). The population included 147 (59.3%) male and 101 (40.7%) female patients, 
mainly of white origin (82.3%). The Phase III study (310-301) contributed the largest number of patients 
in the exposure-safety population (130 patients; 52.4%). 
Of a total of 178 patients who presented an adverse event associated with the “blood and lymphatic system 
disorders” preferred term, 141 (79.2%) presented neutropenia. Of a total of 203 patients who presented 
an adverse event associated with the “skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders” preferred term, 79 (38.9%) 
presented  a  rash.  Based  on  the  above,  exposure-response  analyses  were  performed  to  determine  the 
impact of drug exposure on the probability of neutropenia or rash. 
Neutropenia 
Various ER models were developed to assess the effect of cytarabine and/or daunorubicin exposures on the 
probability  of  neutropenia.  Of  all  models  tested,  the  Cmax  of  cytarabine  and  AUC  of  daunorubicin  were 
associated with the best statistical goodness-of-fit (AIC = 332.057 and 332.522, respectively). The Cmax of 
cytarabine  was  used  in  subsequent  analyses  for  consistency  with  analyses  for  rash  (see  below).  The 
probability of neutropenia as a function of the Cmax of cytarabine on Day 5 is presented in Figure 9.

Figure 9. Probability of Neutropenia as a Function of Cytarabine Cmax on Day 5 
The effect of cytarabine Cmax on the probability of neutropenia was statistically significant (p=0.0011) with 
an odds ratio of 1.015. These results suggest that the odds of response increased by approximately 1.5% 
for each 1 unit increment of cytarabine Cmax (i.e., 1 μg/mL). 
A covariate analysis was performed to identify potential risk factors for the probability of neutropenia. After 
taking  into  account  drug  exposure  in  the  logistic  regression  model,  no  tested  covariate  (age,  sex,  bone 
marrow blast count, WBC count, platelet count) explained the probability of neutropenia. 
Parameters  derived  with  the  final  exposure-response  model  of  cytarabine  Cmax  on  the  probability  of 
neutropenia are presented in Table 19.

Rash 
Various ER models were developed to assess the effect of cytarabine and/or daunorubicin exposures on the 
probability  of  a  rash  event.  Of  all  models  tested,  the  Cmax  of  cytarabine  was  associated  with  the  best 
statistical  goodness-of-fit  based  on  the  AIC  values.  The  probability  of  rash  as  a  function  of  the  Cmax  of 
cytarabine on Day 5 is presented in Figure 10.  
Figure 10. Probability of rash as a function of cytarabine Cmax  
The effect of cytarabine Cmax on the probability of rash was statistically significant (p=0.0092) with an odds 
ratio of 1.012. These results suggest that the odds of a rash increased by approximately 1.2% for each 1 
unit increment of Cmax (i.e., 1 μg/mL). 
A covariate analysis was performed to identify potential risk factors for the probability of rash. After taking 
into account drug exposure in the logistic regression model, no tested covariate (age, sex, bone marrow 
blast count, WBC count, platelet count) explained the probability of rash. Parameters derived with the final

Time to neutrophil recovery and platelet recovery 
Longitudinal measures of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and platelet count were available in study CPX-
MA-1201 and AAML1421 (total N=51). No statistically significant effect of cytarabine Cmax was observed on 
the time to recovery of ANC or platelet count. Results should be interpreted with caution due to the low 
number of patients. 
Distribution of TEAEs by exposure 
The distribution of TEAEs across quartiles of cytarabine Cmax for all studies are presented in Table 21. A 
gradual increase in frequency of Grade 3 to 5 TEAEs was observed across quartiles of cytarabine Cmax. The 
probabilities of Grade 3 to 5 TEAEs for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartiles of cytarabine Cmax were 11.3%, 
13.1%,  18.0%  and  53.2%,  respectively.  The  frequency  of  severe  adverse  events  was  low  (n=11)  with 
apparent gradual increases in frequencies across quartiles of exposure. Similar results were observed for 
daunorubicin Cmax.

1.5.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Two  investigator-sponsored  paediatric  studies  (CPX-MA-1201  and  AAML1421)  have  been  conducted  in 
paediatric and young adult patients from 1 to 21 years of age with r/r AML. The studies were conducted 
independently and without input on design of the MAH. 
Observed PK 
Frequent plasma PK samples following the Day 5 dose were collected in 27 and in 5 paediatric and young 
adult patients in studies CPX-MA-1201 and AAML1421, respectively. In addition, sparse PK samples were 
available for 22 subjects in study AAML1421. The observed exposure (AUC over 48 hours following the Day 
5  dose)  in  paediatric  patients  following  intravenous  doses  100  and  135  units/m2  was  approximately 
comparable to the exposure observed previously in adult patients at similar dose levels. This is expected, 
because  the  dose  is  adjusted  by  body  surface  area.  Moreover,  when  cytarabine  and  daunorubicin  are 
administered  as  components  of  Vyxeos  liposomal,  the  liposomes  govern  their  disposition  kinetics:  the 
volume of distribution is close to the blood volume and the rate of drug release from the liposomes becomes 
the factor that determines the rate of elimination. 
No major deviations from dose proportionality were observed over the dose range 100 to 135 units/m2 in 
the paediatric studies, which is in line with previous data in adult patients. 
Population PK analyses 
Population  PK  (PPK)  analyses  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  pre-specified  pharmacometric  analysis 
plan. The analysis plan was included in the dossier, which is appreciated. 
PPK analyses were conducted using previously developed adult PPK models for cytarabine and daunorubicin 
as the starting point. The proportion of paediatric subjects in the updated dataset was moderate (46/250 
subjects; 18.4%). After the PPK parameters were re-estimated, the effects of age on PK parameters were 
further  investigated.  At  this  point,  the  PPK  models  over-estimated  concentrations  for  paediatric  studies 
(CPX-MA-1201 and AAML1421) population and under-estimated the concentrations in adult studies (101, 
206  and  301)  population.  For  both  cytarabine  and  daunorubicin  models,  “paediatric  study”  categorical 
covariate  effect  on  CL  and  Vc  parameters  improved  the  fits  more  than  age-based  covariates.  The 
introduction of a study effect on paediatric studies led to lower estimates for CL and Vc. This effect appeared 
Assessment report  
EMA/665588/2022 
Page 44/96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to be only driven by the unexpectedly high exposure observed in young adults (18-21 years old) in studies 
CPX-MA-1201 and AAML1421. 
One weakness of the PPK analysis is that serum bilirubin level data were not available for studies CPX-MA-
1201 and AAML1421; bilirubin was a covariate for clearance for both cytarabine and daunorubicin in adult 
PPK models. It is acknowledged that the MAH does not have the data and the issue is not pursued; it is 
unlikely that the overall conclusions regarding the current variation application are affected by this lack of 
data given that the effect of bilirubin level on clearance was modest.  
The  MAH  withdrew  the  application  for  the  paediatric  indication  during  the  procedure.  The  responses  to 
questions  on  PPK  analyses  were  deemed  sufficient  for  the  final  scope  of  the  variation  application. 
Simulations  using  the  PPK  models  indicated  that  the  predicted  exposures  following  the  Day  5  dose  in 
patients  1-5,  6-11,  and  12-17  years  of  age  following  the  135  units/m2  dose  were  very  similar,  and 
approximately 40% higher than the exposure in adults (≥ 18 years of age) following the 100 units/m2 dose, 
i.e.  exposure  increased  by  40%  for  a  35%  dose  increase.  However,  the  predicted  exposures  for  young 
adults  (18-21  years)  from  studies  CPX-MA-1201  and  AAML1421  were  markedly  higher  compared  with 
paediatric patients. As expected, the predicted exposure parameters (Cmax; AUC over 48 hours (AUC0-48); 
concentration at 48 hours after the dose (C48)) were highly correlated, especially AUC0-48 and C48 but also 
Cmax and the other two parameters. 
The MAH is reminded that because the final population PK models for cytarabine and daunorubicin have 
empirical  covariate  “paediatric  study  effect”  on  clearance  and  central  volume  parameters,  use  of  the 
presented population PK models to predict PK in other populations is not recommended. The MAH should 
consider  to  re-develop  the  PPK  models  in  future  as  more  data  become  available;  re-evaluation  of  the 
“formulation effect” on the PK of daunorubicin at that time is also recommended. 
Exposure-response analyses 
Exposure-response (ER) analyses for efficacy and safety were conducted in accordance with pre-specified 
pharmacometric analysis plan. The analysis plan was included in the dossier, which is appreciated. 
ER analyses for efficacy were conducted for paediatric and adult patients with relapsed and refractory AML 
from  studies  CPX-MA-1201,  AAML1421,  101  and  206.  Various  efficacy  endpoints  were  tested.  Because 
some  endpoints  were  not  monitored  in  the  adult  studies  (101  and  206),  the  number  of  subjects  in  the 
efficacy ER analyses was variable.  
For the strict [complete response (CR)] endpoint, no statistically significant association between predicted 
exposure  and  efficacy  was  observed;  CR  was  observed  in  28  of  81  (30.9%)  patients.  The  least  strict 
endpoint [CR, or response with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), or response with partial recovery of 
platelet  count  (CRp)]  was  monitored  only  in  the  paediatric  and  young  adult  studies  (CPX-MA-1201  and 
AAML1421). This joint endpoint was observed in 29 of 52 (55.8%) patients, and exposure to cytarabine or 
daunorubicin was a statistically significant predictor of response.  
Of note, only dose levels 100-101 and 134-135 units/m2 were investigated in the ER analyses for efficacy, 
and  data  for  the  higher  dose  are  mainly  from  studies  CPX-MA-1201  and  AAML1421.  Therefore,  the 
sensitivity to detect exposure-efficacy relationships may be decreased when data from studies 101 and 206 
are  included  in  the  analyses.  On  the  other  hand,  the  number  of  patients  in  studies  CPX-MA-1201  and 
AAML1421 was relatively low (N=52), and the results should, therefore, be interpreted with caution. 
A total of 250 patients, mostly (204/250) adults, were included in the ER analyses for safety. Treatment 
emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  “neutropenia”  and  “rash”  were  frequently  reported  (in  79.2%  and  in 
38.9% of patients, respectively) and were selected for ER analyses.  
Probability  of  neutropenia  increased  approximately  linearly  with  increasing  predicted  cytarabine  (or 
daunorubicin) Cmax and the association was statistically significant. The result is expected, because both 
Assessment report

Page 45/96 
 
 
 
 
cytarabine and daunorubicin are known to cause bone marrow depression. Probability of rash also increased 
statistically significantly with increasing predicted cytarabine (or daunorubicin) Cmax.  
The probability of any TEAE of grade 3-5 increased with increasing predicted cytarabine (or daunorubicin) 
Cmax in the overall safety population, whereas in the paediatric and young adult population (studies CPX-
MA-1201 and AAML1421; N=53) this association was not observed. Because the number of paediatric and 
young adult patients was low, results for this subset should be interpreted with caution. 
1.5.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
A question on pharmacokinetics and exposure in young adult patients, which was initially raised as part of 
the MO on the proposed indication, as well as several other concerns on clinical pharmacology were not 
further pursued since MAH withdrew the application for the paediatric indication.  
Information on paediatric PK will be added to section 5.2 of the SmPC within the current variation. See the 
annexed product information document for details.  
1.6.  Clinical efficacy 
1.6.1.  Dose response studies 
Dose response in study CPX-MA-1201 
Study Design 
Study CPX-MA-1201 was a phase 1, single-center pilot study to assess the PK, toxicity and tolerability of 
CPX-351 in paediatric and young adult patients with relapsed / refractory hematologic malignancies. The 
primary  efficacy  objectives  included  determination  of  a  safe  and  tolerable  dose  of  CPX-351  (defined  as 
maximum tolerated dose, MTD) that could be given to patients with advanced hematologic malignancies, 
recommended a dose of CPX-351 for future studies in young patients with previously untreated AML, and 
PK after CPX-351 administration to young patients with recurrent or refractory hematologic malignancies 
The secondary efficacy objective of this study was to estimate the overall response rate (ORR) to a single 
course of CPX-351 to young patients with recurrent or refractory hematologic malignancies. 
This study comprised 2 phases: a Dose Exploration Phase and an Expanded Phase.  
The Dose Exploration Phase was used to determine a safe and tolerable dose of CPX-351 in patients between 
1 and 21 years of age with hematologic malignancies in first or greater relapse or with disease refractory 
to  standard  induction  chemotherapy.  Two  dose  levels  of  CPX-351  were  explored:  100  units/m2 
administered intravenously (IV) once daily on Days 1, 3 and 5 (dose level 1), and 134 units/m2 IV once 
daily  on  Days  1,  3  and  5  (dose  level  2).  After  completion  of  the  Dose  Exploration  Phase,  the  Expanded 
Phase enrolled 3 to 18 patients between 1 and 30 years of age to collect additional toxicity / tolerability 
information and to estimate the ORR of CPX-351 using the dose determined during the Dose Exploration 
Phase. 
At  specific  time  points  during the treatment  course, all  patients underwent  PK  assessments.  Consenting 
patients also participated in a cardiotoxicity biomarker study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/665588/2022

Throughout the study, patients were monitored for safety and adverse events (AEs); documentation began 
from  day  1  of  study  treatment  and  continued  through  the  30-day  follow-up  period  after  treatment  was 
discontinued. Patients continued to be followed for 6 months after completing their treatment course. 
Results 
A total of 27 patients were enrolled in the study, received at least 1 dose of study drug, and comprised the 
safety population. A total of 9 patients were included in the Dose Exploration Phase. Of these, 5 patients 
received a dose of 134 units/m2 CPX-351 and 4 patients received a dose of 100 units/m2 CPX-351. All 9 
patients (100.0%) completed course 1 of therapy and entered the follow-up period. 
Among patients who received 134 units/m2 CPX-351, 4/5 (80.0%) patients completed the 6-month follow-
up period, and 1/5 (20.0%) subject died during follow-up. Among patients who received 100 units/m2 CPX-
351, 2/4 (50.0%) patients completed the 6-month follow-up period, and 2/4 (50.0%) patients died during 
follow-up. 
A total of 18 patients were included in the Expanded Phase, and all received a dose of 100 units/m2 CPX-
351. A total of 17/18 patients (94.4%) completed course 1 therapy and entered the follow-up period. One 
subject went off protocol therapy because of disease progression and pursuit of other therapy. A total of 
11/18 (61.1%) patients completed the 6-month follow-up period, and 7/18 (38.9%) patients died during 
follow-up. 
The  majority  of  patients  were  white  (77.8%)  and  there  were  slightly  more  female  (51.9%)  than  male 
(48.1%) patients . Patients had a mean (SD) age of 6.7 (5.90) years, ranging from 1 to 19 years, with 
most patients (59.3%) in the age group 2 to < 12 years. No patients aged < 1 year were enrolled. The 
majority of patients enrolled had AML (23/27 patients, 85.2%) and 4/27 patients (14.8%) had ALL.  
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
A minimum of 2 evaluable patients was entered at each dose level for determination of MTD. Once the MTD 
was defined, up to 3 to 18 additional patients were enrolled. The minimum number of patients required to 
determine a MTD was 5 patients; the maximum was 12. 
During  the  Dose  Exploration  Phase,  a  rolling  6  trial  design  was  employed.  Two  to  6  patients  were 
concurrently enrolled onto a dose level, dependent upon 1) the number of patients enrolled at the current 
dose level, 2) the number of patients who experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at the current dose 
level, and 3) the number of patients with tolerability data pending at the current dose level. Accrual was 
suspended when a cohort of 6 had enrolled or when the study endpoints were met. 
Dose level assignment was based on the number of patients enrolled in the cohort at the time, the number 
of DLTs observed, and the number of patients at risk for developing a DLT.  
The MTD of CPX-351 observed in adults with AML was 100 units/m2, and it was projected to be tolerable 
in children based upon previous experience with liposomal anthracycline preparations in pediatric patients. 
If the 100 units/m2 dose was tolerable, then patients were entered into the study at 134 units/m2. This 
dose was chosen since it would deliver a total daunorubicin dose of 177 mg/m2, which is comparable to 
the dose of liposomal daunorubicin administered with fludarabine and high-dose cytarabine by the AML-
Berlin / Frankfurt/ Muenster (BFM) study group during re-induction therapy for children with relapsed AML 
(Sander 2010).  
The 134 unit/m2 dose resulted in DLTs in 2 patients; therefore, the 100 unit/m2 dose was administered to 
all patients in the Expansion Phase.

Dose response in study AAML1421 
Study  AAML1421  was  a  phase  1/2,  multicenter  study  of  CPX-351  for  children  with  AML  in  first  relapse, 
conducted and sponsored by Children’s Oncology Group (COG). The primary objectives of this study were 
to determine a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and the toxicities associated with CPX-351 in pediatric 
and  young  adult  patients  with  relapsed/refractory  AML  and  to  estimate  the  response  rate  (complete 
remission [CR] + complete remission with partial platelet recovery [CRp]) after CPX-351 (Cycle 1) followed 
by fludarabine/cytarabine/G-CSF (FLAG; Cycle 2) in children with AML in first relapse. 
This  study  comprised  2  phases:  a  Dose-finding  Phase  and  an  Efficacy  Phase.  The  Dose-finding  Phase 
employed a modified rolling 6 design. Patients were assigned a dose of CPX-351 at the time of enrollment. 
The starting dose was 135 units/m2/dose on Days 1, 3 and 5. If 135 units/m2/dose was not tolerated, a 
single dose de-escalation to 100 units/m2/dose was allowed. After completion of the Dose-finding Phase, 
the Efficacy Phase employed a single arm 2-stage design with patients enrolled at the RP2D determined in 
the Dose-finding Phase. The number of patients enrolled was dependent on the number of responses. In 
both phases of the trial, CPX-351 was administered intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on Days 1, 3, and 
5 in Cycle 1 and FLAG was administered in Cycle 2. 
Pharmacokinetic sampling during the first cycle of treatment was required for patients enrolled in the Dose-
finding Phase, and optional for patients enrolled in the Efficacy Phase of this study. 
Optional studies of biomarkers of cardiac injury, novel biochemical and imaging markers of cardiotoxicity, 
and rare coding variants as risk factors for anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy were also included in the 
study design. 
Throughout the study, patients were monitored for safety and adverse events (AEs); documentation began 
from  day  1  of  study  treatment  and  continued  through  the  30-day  follow-up  period  after  treatment  was 
discontinued. 
Results 
A total of 38 patients provided informed consent and were enrolled in this study. All patients received a 
dose of 135 units/m2 CPX-351 and were included in the Safety Analysis Set. 
A  total  of  6  patients  were  included  in  the  Dose-finding  Phase;  of  these,  4  patients  (66.7%)  completed 
planned therapy and entered the follow-up period. One subject (16.7%) experienced treatment failure, and 
1 subject (16.7%) did not complete the planned therapy because the physician determined it was in the 
subject’s best interest. 
Thirty-two patients were included in the Efficacy Phase; of these, 21 patients (65.6%) completed planned 
therapy  and  entered  the  follow-up  period.  Two  patients  (6.3%)  experienced  treatment  failure,  and  9 
patients  (28.1%)  did  not  complete  the  planned  therapy  because  the  physician  determined  it  was  in  the 
subject’s best interest. Overall, most patients (25/38 patients, 65.8%) completed the study. 
In the Safety Analysis Set (N = 38), the majority of patients were white (68.4%) and there were slightly 
more female (52.6%) than male (47.4%) patients. Patients had a mean (SD) age of 10.6 (6.42) years, 
ranging from 1 to 21 years, with most patients (44.7%) between the ages of 2 and 12 years. 
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
Dose limiting toxicities were defined as any of the following events that occurred after the first dose of CPX-
351 during the first cycle of therapy. DLT assessment occurred during the Dose Finding Phase.

Non-hematologic DLT 
Non-hematologic DLTs were defined as any ≥ Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity that occurred after the first 
dose of CPX-351 that was possibly, probably or definitely related to CPX-351, and with the specific exclusion 
of: 
a)  Alopecia 
b)  Grade 3 fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea 
c)  Grade 3 or 4 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or ALT elevation that improved to ≤ Grade 2 within 14 
days 
d)  Grade 3 or 4 isolated electrolyte abnormalities that resolved, with or without intervention, to ≤ Grade 
2 within 72 hours 
e)  Tumor lysis syndrome 
f)  Grade 3 or 4 fever, febrile neutropenia, or infection with or without hospitalization 
g)  Grade 3 rash 
h)  Grade 3 mucositis that resolves (with or without supportive care) to ≤ Grade 2 elevation within 14 
days 
i)  Early  nutritional  intervention  with  total  parenteral  nutrition  or  enteral  tube  feeding  for  anorexia, 
nausea, or concern for poor nutritional status will not be considered a DLT 
j)  Grade 3 troponin elevations without EKG or other evidence of myocardial ischemia 
k)  Grade 3 or greater pain due to leukemia, mucositis, typhlitis, infection, or obvious injury. 
Hematologic Dose-Limiting Toxicity 
Hematologic DLTs were defined as failure to recover a peripheral ANC > 500/μL and non- transfusion 
dependent platelet count > 20,000/μL due to documented bone marrow aplasia/hypoplasia (i.e., not 
due to malignant infiltration) for ≥ 50 days from the start of the therapeutic cycle. Failure to recover 
peripheral counts due to disease involvement of the bone were not considered dose-limiting. 
A pediatric phase 1 trial of CPX-351 at Cincinnati Children's Hospital (Study CPX-MA-1201) completed the 
initial dose level of 100 units/m2/dose on Days 1, 3, 5 with no DLTs. However, enrollment on AAML1421 
began at 135 units/m2/dose on Days 1, 3, 5. 
The rationale for studying this dose level included:  
1. No DLTs observed with CPX-351 at 100 units/m2/dose on Days 1, 3, 5 in the Study CPX-MA-1201.  
2. The DLTs in the adult Study 101 that were observed at 134 units/m2 were persistent cytopenia > 56 
days (1 subject), congestive heart failure (1 subject), and hypertensive crisis (1 subject). One episode of 
congestive heart failure occurred during a period of sepsis and was transient. Hypertensive crises are very 
rare in the pediatric / adolescent and young adult population; therefore, this toxicity was not considered to 
be relevant to the eligible patients in this study. The FDA agreed to a starting dose of 134 units/m2/dose 
(this study rounds the dose to 135 units/m2) upon review of the phase 1 protocol for Study CPX-MA-1201.  
3. CPX-351 at a dose of 135 units/m2/dose delivers a total daunorubicin dose of approximately 180 mg/m2, 
which is comparable to the liposomal daunorubicin delivered in studies with daunoxome (Kaspers 2013). 
Also,  this  dose  is  comparable  to  the  150  mg/m2  cumulative  dose  of  daunorubicin  administered  during 
Induction I of COG studies AAML0531 and AAML1031, thus providing a dose that is comparable to published 
literature and potentially translatable to a randomized phase 3 study.

4. If 135 units/m2/dose is not tolerated, a single dose de-escalation to 100 units/m2/dose was allowed.  
The Dose-finding Phase of Study AAML1421 demonstrated that CPX-351 at 135 units/m2/dose given on 
Days 1, 3, and 5 was identified as the RP2D. This dose was used in the Efficacy Phase.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy Variables 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  patients  with  CR  or  CRp  after  CPX-351  (cycle  1) 
followed  by  FLAG  (cycle  2).  The  summary  was  done  by  dose  level  (100  units/m2/dose  and  135 
units/m2/dose). 
Response criteria employed revised AML International Working Group criteria (Cheson 2003) and included: 
Overall Response (OR): OR rate is defined as the sum of the number of patients with CR plus those with 
CRp divided by the total number of evaluable enrolled patients. 
Complete Remission (CR): Attainment of an M1 bone marrow (< 5% blasts) with no evidence of circulating 
blasts or extramedullary disease and with recovery of peripheral blood counts (ANC ≥ 1000/μL and platelet 
count  ≥  100,000/μL).  Flow  cytometry  may  also  be  useful  to  distinguish  between  leukemia  and  a 
regenerating bone marrow. There is no requirement for bone marrow cellularity. 
CR with Partial Recovery of Platelet Count (CRp): Attainment of an M1 bone marrow (< 5% blasts) and no 
evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease and with recovery of ANC ≥ 1000/μL and platelet 
transfusion independence (defined as: no platelet transfusions x 1 week). 
Complete Remission with Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CRi): Attainment of an M1 bone marrow (< 
5%  blasts)  and  no  evidence  of  circulating  blasts  or  extramedullary  disease  and  with  ANC  <  1000/μL  or 
platelet count < 100,000/μL without platelet transfusion independence (defined as: no platelet transfusions 
x 1 week). 
Partial Response (PR): M2 bone marrow (5% to 25% blasts) and at least a 50% decrease in bone marrow 
blast  percent  from  baseline.  Bone  marrow  must  have  adequate  cellularity  (eg,  ≥  10%,  if  a  biopsy  is 
performed) to determine response. PR status will not be included in calculation of response to the regimen. 
A repeat bone marrow aspiration within 14 days may be required to distinguish between a PR and increased 
blasts caused by bone marrow regeneration nd is left to the discretion of the investigator. 
Treatment Failure (TF): In the Efficacy Phase, if after Cycle 1 (CPX-351) a subject has a hypoplastic bone 
marrow for ≥ 60 days and failure to recover a peripheral ANC > 500/μL and a non-transfusion dependent 
Assessment report  
EMA/665588/2022 
Page 53/96 
 
 
 
 
 
platelet  count  >  20,000/μL  not  due  to  malignant  infiltration  or  severe  infection  (defined  as  ≥  Grade  3), 
they will be considered a treatment failure and will go off protocol therapy. 
The definition of treatment failure includes: 
a)  An increase in the extent of bone marrow infiltration by leukemic cells (absolute increase of ≥ 20% 
blasts), OR 
b)  Development of extramedullary disease, OR 
c)  M2 marrow that does not qualify for PR status, OR 
d)  An M1 marrow with circulating blasts, OR 
e)  > 25% blasts in the bone marrow after Cycle 1 of therapy. 
Relapse:  Morphologic  relapse  after  CR/CRp/CRi  is  defined  as  a  reappearance  of  leukemic  blasts  in  the 
peripheral blood or ≥ 5% blasts in the bone marrow not attributable to any other cause (eg, bone marrow 
regeneration after therapy). In the setting of recent treatment, if there are no circulating blasts and the 
bone marrow contains 5% to 20% blasts, a repeat bone marrow performed at least a week later is necessary 
to  distinguish  relapse  from  bone  marrow  regeneration.  Should  flow  cytometric  or  molecular  analyses 
suggest relapse (by the reappearance of a similar immunophenotype or mutation to the original leukemia) 
in  the  presence  of  <  5%  blasts,  or  ≥  5%  blasts  in  a  regenerating  marrow,  a  repeat  bone  marrow(s) 
performed at least a week later is necessary to confirm relapse by morphologic methods. In such instances 
the date of recurrence is defined as the first date that more than 5% blasts were observed in the marrow. 
The  reappearance  or  development  of  cytologically  proven  extramedullary  disease  also  indicates  relapse. 
Molecular  and/or  genetic  relapse  is  characterized  by  reappearance  of  a  cytogenetics  or  molecular 
abnormality. 
Bone Marrow Classification: 
M1 is < 5% blasts M2 is 5 to 25% blasts M3 is > 25% blasts 
Evaluability for Response 
A subject was considered evaluable for response if: 
2.  The subject met the eligibility criteria for the Efficacy Phase; 
3.  The subject received at least 1 dose of CPX-351 at the RP2D; and 
4.  The subject was under follow-up for a sufficient period to evaluate the disease at the end of Cycle 1 
or met the definition of Treatment Failure. 
Patients  who  demonstrated  a  CR  or  CRp  were  considered  to  have  experienced  a  response.  All  other 
evaluable patients were considered non-responders. A subject who died as a result of toxicity during Cycle 
1 after receiving all or part of protocol therapy were considered as non-responders. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 
The secondary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with CR or CRp after CPX-351 (cycle 1).   
Sample size 
Up  to  50  evaluable  patients  (12  for  the  Dose-finding  Phase,  38  for  the  Efficacy  Phase)  were  planned. 
Allowing for 10% of patients being inevaluable, enrollment of up to 56 patients was planned. 
Study AAML1421 was designed to evaluate a minimum of 6 patients and a maximum of 12 potential patients 
in the Dose-finding Phase of the study. During the course of the study, the Dose-finding Phase only needed 
Assessment report  
EMA/665588/2022 
Page 54/96 
 
 
 
 
6 patients at Dose Level 1 and the RP2D was deemed to be 135 units/m2/dose on Days 1, 3, 5. There was 
no need to further expand this portion of the study and the final 6 patients were not accrued. 
In the Efficacy Phase of the study, a total of 38 evaluable patients were required. All 6 patients entering 
the Dose-finding Phase of the study met the criteria to be considered evaluable for response in the Efficacy 
Phase and were therefore included in the efficacy analysis. The study organizers and the COG statistician 
considered the Dose-finding Phase of the study to be complete. Similarly, the Efficacy Phase evaluation was 
also  considered  complete,  with  a  total of  38  evaluable  patients  (6  patients  form  the  Dose-finding  Phase 
plus 32 additional patients from the Efficacy Phase). As a consequence, the final 6 patients were not accrued 
because they were not necessary for the evaluation of efficacy. 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label, single-arm study. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy Phase 
The Efficacy Phase is a single arm two-stage design. The following optimal Simon two-stage design was 
used to test the null hypothesis that the overall response rate is ≤ 40% versus the alternative hypothesis 
that the response rate is ≥ 60%. 
If the therapy is associated with a 40% response rate (CR+CRp) after up to 2 cycles of therapy, the therapy 
will be identified as effective with probability 0.10. If the therapy is associated with a 60% response rate, 
the therapy will be identified as effective with probability 0.80. 
All efficacy endpoints will be presented at a 0.05 level of significant without multiplicity adjustment. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint and Analysis 
Definition 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients with CR or CRp after CPX-351 (cycle 1) followed 
by FLAG (cycle 2). The summary will be done by Dose-Finding Phase and Efficacy Phase. 
Primary Analysis 
The proportion of patients with CR or CRp will be estimated using the Jung and Kim’s method (Jung and 
Kim, 2004).  
The 90% confidence intervals were calculated using the approach of Koyama and Chen (Koyama and Chen 
2008).  
Assessment report  
EMA/665588/2022 
Page 55/96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For example, if m = 2 and s = 20, then the p-value = 0.0607 and the 90% CI is (0.3923, 0, 6923). No 
sensitivity analyses or subgroup analyses were planned. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  CR  or  CRp  or  CRi  was  estimated  after  1  cycle  of  CPX-351  similar  to  the 
primary efficacy endpoint using Jung and Kim’s method.

Recruitment 
Between 26 April 2016 and June 2018, a total of 38 patients were randomized at 9 study centres in the 
USA.  
Conduct of the study 
The original study protocol was issued on 02 March 2016. It was subsequently amended twice: Amendment 
1 was finalized on 23 February 2017, and Amendment 2 was finalized on 22 February 2018 (Version 3). 
Protocol Amendment 1 (23 February 2017) 
a)  Results of Study 301 in adults with de novo high risk AML / MDS were added to the background. 
b)  The  Dose-finding  Phase  of  the  study  had  completed  as  of  12  December  2016,  and  results  were 
summarized and added, including: 
•  One DLT was experienced among the 6 patients who received 135 units/m2 CPX-351 (and no pain 
related DLTs were observed). 
• 
The RP2D was determined to be 135 units/m2 CPX-351 and this dose was recommended for further 
study in the Efficacy Phase. 
•  Updated information in the background regarding early results from the cardiac biomarker data 
collected  in  the  CPX-MA-1201  study,  and  added  a  justification  to  modify  the  serial  time  points 
collected for patients on AAML1421. 
•  Updated the time points for the blood samples to be drawn for the optional biomarker studies, 
including optional miRNA studies. (A justification for longer monitoring of miRNA was also added.) 
•  Added  information  regarding  the  optional  PK  that  is  included  in  the  Efficacy  Phase  of  the  trial, 
including information about updated time points and the analysis of the PK samples to be drawn. 
•  Clarified diagnosis / disease status required for study eligibility and removed the exclusion of prior 
allergy to liposomal lipids. 
• 
In eligibility criteria for the Efficacy Phase, clarified that patients must be in first marrow relapse 
and that donor lymphocyte infusion was considered a re-induction attempt. 
•  Updated schedule of required observations for the first cycle of treatment to clarify timing of CBC 
and  differential  with  platelets,  timing  for  ECHO  and  optional  biomarker  specimens  (including 
cardiotoxicity), and timing of the optional PK blood draws. 
•  Added guidance to have both ejection fraction and shortening fraction calculated from the ECHO, 
and added a timeline for submitting CDs with ECHOs exams. 
Protocol Amendment 2 (22 February 2018) 
•  Clarified that yearly echocardiograms should be repeated annually from the start of therapy. 
•  Clarified the time points for the echocardiograms and EKG. 
•  Updated criterion for removal from protocol therapy for the Efficacy phase from 50 to 60 days for 
hypoplastic marrow so that it matched the definition of Treatment Failure in Section 10.2. 
•  Updated the warning about concomitant use of cardiotoxic and hepatotoxic agents with CPX-351, 
and  reformatted  and  updated  toxicity  table  to  match  side  effects  outlined  in  the  most  current 
investigator brochure. 
Assessment report  
EMA/665588/2022 
Page 57/96 
 
 
 
 
•  Added definition of treatment failure in the Efficacy Phase of the study. 
•  Clarified that specimens for cytogenetic analysis were required and must have been obtained prior 
to initiating therapy. 
• 
The following information regarding PK was updated: blood samples during the Efficacy phase of 
the study and for ordering PK kits; the Jazz contact for PKs; the blood draw volume was updated 
to to 2 mL since the tubes provided in the kits were 2 mL; and shipping information for PK samples. 
•  Added a ± of 1 hour for the Day 5, hour 6 specimen time point. 
•  Clarified oversight for the biomarkers of cardiotoxicity and the miRNA studies. 
•  Clarified time points for echocardiograms and blood biomarkers. 
Baseline data 
In the Safety Analysis Set (N = 38), the majority of patients were White (68.4%) and there were slightly 
more female (52.6%) than male (47.4%) patients (Table 23). Patients had a mean (SD) age of 10.6 (6.42) 
years, ranging from 1 to 21 years, with most patients (44.7%) between the ages of 2 and 12 years. 
Most  patients  enrolled  in  the  study  had  ECOG  performance  score  of  0  (78.9%),  and  CNS  status  of  1 
(86.8%). At enrollment, patients had AML WHO Disease Classifications in a number of categories, but the 
the category ‘AML, other or unclassifiable’ included the highest proportion of patients (36.8%). Mean (SD) 
cumulative  prior  anthracycline  exposure  was  344.51  (96.461)  mg/m2,  which  is  as  expected  given  the 
heavily pretreated relapsed AML population. Baseline bone marrow and hematology results were consistent 
with  what  would  be  expected  for  patients  with  AML.  Two  patients  (5.3%)  presented  with  non-CNS 
extramedullary disease (Table 24).

The MAH states that “Data on prior and concomitant medications were noted in the subject records but 
were not collected on the CRF. Therefore, for the purposes of this CSR, no data on prior and concomitant 
medications are available in the datasets”. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 38 patients provided informed consent and were enrolled in this study. All patients received CPX-
351 and were included in the Safety Analysis Set.  
The Efficacy Evaluable Analysis Set included all patients who 1) met the eligibility criteria for the Efficacy 
Phase;2) received at least 1 dose of CPX-351 at the RP2D; and 3) were under follow-up for a sufficient 
period to evaluate the disease at the end of Cycle 1 or met the definition of treatment failure (TF). 
A total of 37 patients were included in the Efficacy Evaluable Analysis Set. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint: Overall Response Rate (ORR) After CPX-351 (Cycle 1) followed by FLAG (Cycle 
2). 
The ORR (CR + CRp) after CPX-351 (Cycle 1) followed by FLAG (Cycle 2) was 68% using Jung and Kim’s 
method (90% CI: 53% to 78%; p-value: < 0.001, using the approach of Koyama and Chen; Table 25). 
When examining best response (defined as CR or CRp or CRi) after CPX-351 (Cycle 1) followed by FLAG 
(Cycle 2), the best response rate was 81% using Jung and Kim’s method (90% CI: 67% to 89%; p-value: 
< 0.001, using the approach of Koyama and Chen). Best response was achieved by 21/37 patients (56.8%) 
after Cycle 1 and by 9/37 patients (24.3%) after Cycle 2.

Secondary efficacy endpoint: Response Rate After CPX-351 (Cycle 1)  
As a secondary objective of Study AAML1421, the response rate (CR + CRp + CRi) after 1 cycle of CPX-
351 was 76% using Jung and Kim’s method (90% CI: 61% to 85%; p-value: < 0.001, using the approach 
of  Koyama  and  Chen)  (5.4.2.3). A  total of  7/37  patients  (18.9%) had  a  partial  response  (PR)  and 2/37 
patients (5.4%) were diagnosed with treatment failure (TF). 
During  Cycle  2,  13/27  patients  (48.1%)  achieved  CR,  7/27  patients  (25.9%)  achieved  CRp,  and  2/27 
patients (7.4%) achieved CRi. No patients had a PR and 5/27 patients (18.5%) were diagnosed with TF 
(Table 26). 
Table 26. Summary of Best Response  
Of the patients classified as responders (i.e., those whose best response over 2 cycles was CR or CRp or 
CRi),  10/30  patients  (33.3%)  had  cytogenetics  classified  as  other,  6/30  patients  (20.0%)  had  inv(16); 
t(8;21), and 6/30 patients (20.0%) had unknown cytogenetics.

Exploratory Analysis: Overall Survival  
The median OS was estimated as 32.5 months for all 37 efficacy evaluable patients using the Kaplan-Meier 
method  (26/37  patients  [70.3%]  survived  at  the  time  of  analysis;  Figure  12).  The  median  OS  was 
estimated as 32.5 months for the 30 responders (ie, patients with best response of CR or CRp or CRi over 
2 cycles; 23/37 patients [62.2%] survived at the time of analysis). The median OS was estimated as 10.1 
months  for  the  7  non-responders  (i.e.,  patients  who  had  a  PR  or  were  diagnosed  with  TF;  3/37  [8.1%] 
survived at the time of analysis).

Cycle 1: CPX-351 was administered at a dose of 
135 units/m2* by central venous catheter over 
90 minutes on Days 1, 3, and 5. 
*1 unit of Vyxeos contains 0.44 mg 
daunorubicin and 1 mg cytarabine. 
Cycle 2: Subjects received 5 µg/kg Filgrastim 
(G-CSF) administered IV or subcutaneously on 
Days 1-5 one hour prior to each dose of 
fludarabine. Dosing was restarted on Day 15 
and continued until the post-nadir ANC ≥ 
500/μL.  Fludarabine was given at a dose of 30 
mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes on Days 1-5.  High 
dose cytarabine at a dose of 2000 mg/m2 was 
administered by IV infusion over 1 to 3 hours 
on Days 1-5 (4 hours after the start of 
fludarabine).

The details of this study have been presented previously both in the PK section and Dose response studies 
section in this report. 
Study Design 
Study CPX-MA-1201 was a phase 1, single-center pilot study to assess the PK, toxicity and tolerability of 
CPX-351 in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed / refractory hematologic malignancies.  
The secondary efficacy objective of this study was to estimate the overall response rate (ORR) to a single 
course of CPX-351 to young patients with recurrent or refractory hematologic malignancies. 
Study population 
A total of 27 patients were enrolled in the study, received at least 1 dose of study drug, and comprised the 
safety population. A total of 9 patients were included in the Dose Exploration Phase. Of these, 5 patients 
received a dose of 134 units/m2 CPX-351 and 4 patients received a dose of 100 units/m2 CPX-351. All 9 
patients (100.0%) completed course 1 of therapy and entered the follow-up period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/665588/2022

Among patients who received 134 units/m2 CPX-351, 4/5 (80.0%) patients completed the 6-month follow-
up period, and 1/5 (20.0%) subject died during follow-up. Among patients who received 100 units/m2 CPX-
351, 2/4 (50.0%) patients completed the 6-month follow-up period, and 2/4 (50.0%) patients died during 
follow-up. 
A total of 18 patients were included in the Expanded Phase, and all received a dose of 100 units/m2 CPX-
351. A total of 17/18 patients (94.4%) completed course 1 therapy and entered the follow-up period. One 
subject went off protocol therapy because of disease progression and pursuit of other therapy. A total of 
11/18 (61.1%) patients completed the 6-month follow-up period, and 7/18 (38.9%) patients died during 
follow-up. 
The  majority  of  patients  were  white  (77.8%)  and  there  were  slightly  more  female  (51.9%)  than  male 
(48.1%) patients. Patients had a mean (SD) age of 6.7 (5.90) years, ranging from 1 to 19 years, with most 
patients (59.3%) in the age group 2 to < 12 years. No patients aged < 1 year were enrolled. The majority 
of patients enrolled had AML (23/27 patients, 85.2%) and 4/27 patients (14.8%) had ALL. 
Efficacy 
A secondary objective of Study CPX-MA-1201 was to estimate the ORR to a single course of CPX-351. 
Among  patients  with  AML who  received  100  units/m2  CPX-351,  3/18  patients (16.7%)  achieved  CR  and 
3/18 patients (16.7%) achieved CRi for an ORR of 33.3% (6/18 patients; table 5.4.2.6). 
Among patients with AML who received 134 units/m2 CPX-351, 2/5 patients (40.0%) achieved CR and no 
patients achieved CRi for an ORR of 40.0% (2/5 patients; Table 5.4.2.6). 
No patients with ALL responded to treatment (Table 28).

1.6.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
With  this  application,  the  MAH  was  initially  seeking  approval  for  the  following  indication  for  Vyxeos 
Assessment report  
EMA/665588/2022 
Page 66/96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
liposomal: “Vyxeos liposomal is indicated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML in paediatric and 
young  adult  patients  aged  1  to  21  years  old.”.  After  receiving  the  questions  from  the  CHMP,  the  MAH 
decided  to  not  pursue  the  request  for  the  paediatric  indication  in  Relapse  or  Refractory  Acute  Myeloid 
Leukaemia (R/R AML). Therefore, the MAH is only proposing updated text within Sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 
5.2 of the SmPC. Consequently, the MAH provided responses only to questions related to data proposed to 
be included in the SmPC.  
Clarifications  in  relation  to  proposed  indication  were  considered  necessary.  The  data  provided  could  be 
possibly acceptable for the relapsed, paediatric population. However, there are data currently from only 8 
relapsed,  young  adults.  The  proposed  upper  age limit  of  21  years  was  not  clinically  justified,  but  rather 
driven  by  age  range  of  the  available  data.  In  addition  to  that,  no  specific  efficacy  and  safety  results 
according to different age groups were provided and suitability of the proposed dosing for young adults was 
questioned.  Therefore,  the  proposed  indication  (including  also  young  adult  relapsed  patients)  was  to  be 
further justified or the wording of the indication to be modified accordingly.  
Moreover, the MAH was asked to justify the inclusion of refractory patients into proposed indication because 
the information with regard to exact number of patients with either relapsed AML or with refractory AML 
was missing. Specifically, as cytarabine and anthracycline combination therapies are already standard part 
of  first  line  therapy,  the  MAH  was  asked  to  discuss  whether  patients,  who  were  refractory  to  first  line 
therapy, may still respond to second line cytarabine-daunorubicine therapy. In its response, the MAH has 
clarified that all patients were with relapsed AML.  However, the MAH has not provided requested efficacy 
and  safety  data  per  age  cohort  nor  provided  justification  regarding  the  acceptability  of  the  proposed 
posology for young adults or refractory paediatric patients. Since the MAH no longer pursuing the indication 
for paediatric patients with R/R AML these issues are not pursued further.  
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a biologically heterogeneous disease that can be classified into 3 distinct 
categories based on clinical ontogeny: de novoAML which arises in the absence of an identified exposure or 
prodromal  stem  cell  disorder  (like  in  MDS).  Secondary  AML  (s-AML)  represents  transformation  of  an 
antecedent  diagnosis  of  myelodysplastic  syndrome  (AML-MRC)  or  myeloproliferative  neoplasm  (MPN), 
therapy-related  AML  (tAML)  develops  as  a  late  complication  in  patients  with  prior  exposure  to 
leukaemogenic therapies. 
Long-term survival rates of paediatric AML patients are currently 70% or even higher. Compared to adults, 
children with AML have superior outcomes due to fewer adverse genetic mutations and the ability to tolerate 
the  high-intensity  chemotherapy  currently  necessary  for  cure.  Regarding  novel  agents  and  treatment 
modalities, drugs such as venetoclax, monoclonal antibodies, and cellular therapies are investigated also 
in paediatric AML. 
Relapse after initial AML therapy is associated with poor prognosis and the only consistently curative therapy 
for relapsed AML is a HSCT. 
The MAH has provided data from pivotal phase II study (AAML1421) and supportive phase I study (CPX-
MA-1201). The dose of CPX-351 used in study AAML1421 was 135 units/m2 versus 100 unit/m2 in study 
CPX-MA-1201, respectively. Due to that, direct comparison of efficacy results (after 1 cycle of CPX-351) 
between these two studies is not possible. 
Study AAML1421 (phase II) enrolled patients paediatric and young adult patients with relapsed AML. Study 
CPX-MA-1201  (phase  I)  on  the  other  hand  enrolled  paediatric  and  young  adult  patients  with  relapsed  / 
refractory hematologic malignancies (AML and ALL). 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study AAML1421 
Assessment report  
EMA/665588/2022 
Page 67/96 
 
 
 
 
The efficacy of CPX-351 in paediatric and young adult patients with relapsed AML (up to 21 years old) is 
based  mainly  on  one,  open-label,  single-arm  study  AAML1421.  It  was  conducted  and  sponsored  by  the 
Children’s Oncology Group (COG) and the MAH was not involved in the study conduct but received the data 
from the Sponsors and summarized the results of the study for the purposes of regulatory submission. The 
study  is  considered  of  adequate  design  with  appropriate  clinical  endpoints  for  the  target  indication  of 
relapsed, paediatric AML [(with the primary efficacy endpoint of the proportion of patients with CR or CRp 
after CPX-351 (cycle 1) followed by FLAG (cycle 2)].  
This study comprised 2 phases: a dose-finding phase and an efficacy phase. During the dose-finding phase, 
a  modified  rolling  6  design  was  employed.  Subjects  were  assigned  a  dose  of  CPX-351  at  the  time  of 
enrollment.  The  starting  dose  was  135  units/m2/dose  (i.e.  59  mg/m2  daunorubicin  and  135  mg/m2 
cytarabine) on Days 1, 3 and 5. If the starting dose was not tolerated, a single dose de-escalation to 100 
units/m2/dose was allowed.  
Targeting HSCT should have been given considerably more value. The only long-term curative treatment 
option in relapsed AML patients is HSCT (HSCT is recommended as post-remission (CR2) management in 
all suitable relapsed AML patients). Due to that, all possible patients eligible for this procedure should be 
offered and targeted to proceed to this treatment.  The MAH has clarified that  prior HSCT was recorded in 
10 out of 38 patients (26.3%). 
The MAH has used a method from Jung and Kim to calculate the number of responders (both with regard 
to primary and secondary efficacy endpoints).  However, the response rate has now been presented as a 
simple proportion of responders and the corresponding Clopper-Pearson confidence interval in the SmPC 
as requested.  
The  study  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  reflect  the  target  population  of  relapsed  AML  patients.  10  out  38 
patients did not complete the study because the physician determined it was in the subject’s best interest 
not to continue in the study. The MAH has clarified that seven patients with CR, CRi, or CRp after cycle 1 
had HCT after discontinuing study treatment. One patient had treatment failure and for the remaining two 
patients there is no further information. The MAH`s response is considered adequate. The MAH`s reasoning 
that the treatment approach to relapsed/ refractory pediatric AML between US and European investigators 
is essentially the same, is also acceptable.  
Additional data from one phase 1 study has been presented to further support the efficacy of CPX-351: 
Study  CPX-MA-1201.  In  this  phase  I  (PK,  MTD)  single  arm  study,  a  total  of  23  relapsed,  pediatric  AML 
patients were treated with single course of CPX-351.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 38 subjects were enrolled in this study:  
•  Six subjects were included in the dose-finding phase, all of whom received a CPX-351 dose of 59 
mg/m2 daunorubicin and 135 mg/m2 cytarabine (i.e. 135 units/m2/dose). Of the 6 subjects in the 
dose-finding  phase,  1  subject  experienced  a  DLT  (a  serious  adverse  event  of  Ejection  fraction 
decreased) at the dose level of 135 units/m2/dose. The remaining subjects did not experience DLTs, 
and 135 units/m2/dose (i.e. 59 mg/m2 daunorubicin and 135 mg/m2 cytarabine) was the RP2D.  
• 
Thirty-two  subjects  were  included  in  the  Efficacy  Phase,  and  all  received  CPX-351  135 
units/m2/dose. 
In the pivotal study AAML1421, the primary efficacy endpoint (after CPX-351 (Cycle 1) followed by FLAG 
(Cycle 2)) displayed an ORR (CR + CRp) of 68% and the best response rate (CR + CRp + CRi) of 81%. 
However, the MAH has used an unconventional method to calculate the number of responders and should 
Assessment report  
EMA/665588/2022 
Page 68/96 
 
 
 
 
 
provide  the  response  rate  as  a  simple  proportion  of  responders  and  the  corresponding  Clopper-Pearson 
confidence interval.  
In addition, to justify the potential benefit of the treatment, the MAH was asked to provide data with regard 
to the use of HSCT as consolidation in patients achieving response. The MAH has not provided the requested 
data. However, since the MAH no longer pursuing the indication for pediatric patients with R/R AML, this 
issue is not actual any more. 
The secondary efficacy endpoint (after 1 cycle of CPX-351) displayed a response rate (CR + CRp) of 43.2 
% and the best response rate (CR + CRp + CRi) of 76%. The same concern applies also here with regard 
to actual response rates: the MAH was requested to provide the response rate as a simple proportion of 
responders and the corresponding Clopper-Pearson confidence interval. Thus, while treatment with CPX-
351 seem to achieve substantial results on its own, the second treatment course with FLAG increases the 
efficacy  even  further.  However,  there  are  similar  concerns  with  regard  to  missing  information  and 
contextualisation  of  the  results  as  mentioned  with  the  interpretation  of  results  of  the  primary  efficacy 
endpoint. 
The median OS was estimated as 32.5 months for all 37 efficacy evaluable subjects. The result of this post-
hoc  exploratory  analysis  should  be  further  contextualised  by  the  MAH.  Updated  follow-up  data  and 
especially outcome data of patients treated with allo-HSCT as consolidation to establish the clinical benefit 
of  the  proposed  treatment  with  Vyxeos  liposomal  should  be  provided.  The  MAH  has  not  provided  the 
requested long-term efficacy data which is acceptable since the MAH is no longer pursuing the indication 
for paediatric patients with R/R AML. 
Study CPX-MA-1201 
With the 100 unit/m2 dose the ORR was 33.3% and 16.7% of the patients achieved CR. The MAH has only 
briefly contextualised these results by stating that “the observed ORR values were consistent with children 
and young adults with relapsed/refractory AML who were predominantly heavily pre-treated (Gorman 2010; 
Quarello 2015; Cooper 2017; Jaiswal 2016)”. 
Due to limited number of patients in this study, the efficacy results of this small SAT could be regarded 
descriptive at best. 
1.6.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the pivotal clinical study AAML1421, treatment with CPX-351 resulted in an ORR (CR + CRp) of 68% and 
the best response rate (CR + CRp + CRi) of 81% in relapsed paediatric patients. The reported CR rate of 
54%, supported by the CR/CRp/CRi rate, is considered promising for the high-risk AML study population. 
The indication for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML in paediatric and young adult patients aged 
1 to 21 years old is no longer pursued, and only updating the text within Section 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC  is  proposed.    The  response  rate  is  presented  as  a  simple  proportion  of  responders  and  the 
corresponding Clopper-Pearson confidence interval.  
Since the MAH no longer pursuing the indication for paediatric patients with R/R AML all outstanding issues 
that were raised during the evaluation of the clinical efficacy are not further pursued.

1.7.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
To  support this  variation,  the  MAH  has  submitted  safety  data  from  the  following  2 studies  in  paediatric/ 
young  adult  subjects  with  AML  (and  ALL)  and  Study AAML1421  and  Study CPX-MA-1201,  described  in 
Section 1.6 of this report.  
For the key baseline demographic patient and disease characteristics and the patient flow for the pivotal 
study AAML1421, see efficacy section Table 23 and Figure 11., respectively.  
Pooling of  paediatric  safety  data  from  the  two  studies  was  not  performed,  because  of  differences  in the 
characteristics of the two available studies.  
Patient exposure 
Study AAML1421 
In  Study  AAML1421  all  38  subjects  (100%)  received  1  cycle  of  therapy  with  CPX-351  followed  by  FLAG 
(Cycle 2). All but 1 subject (37/38 subjects, 97.4%) received 3 CPX-351 doses of 59 mg/m2 daunorubicin 
and 135 mg/m2 cytarabine; 1 subject received 2 CPX-351 doses of 59 mg/m2 daunorubicin and 135 mg/m2 
cytarabine. Overall, the mean (SD) cumulative doses of daunorubicin and cytarabine received were 220.1 
(106.50) mg and 500.1 (242.04) mg, respectively. 
Recommended phase 2 dose: During the Dose-finding Phase, CPX-351 dosing was initiated at 59 mg/m2 
daunorubicin and 135 mg/m2 cytarabine administered once daily to subjects on Days 1, 3, and 5. A total 
of 1/6 subjects experienced a DLT (ejection fraction decreased) and this dose was determined to be the 
RP2D. 
Study CPX-MA-1201 
A total of 22 subjects received a CPX-351 dose of 44 mg/m2 daunorubicin and 100 mg/m2 cytarabine (4 in 
the Dose Exploration Phase and 18 in the Expansion Phase), and 5 subjects (all in the Dose Exploration 
Phase)  received  a  CPX-351  dose  of  59  mg/m2  daunorubicin  and  134  mg/m2  cytarabine.  All  27  subjects 
(100%)  received  1  course  of  therapy.  Overall,  the  mean  (SD)  cumulative  dose  of  daunorubicin  and 
cytarabine received were 135.7 (80.41) mg and 308.5 (182.75) mg, respectively. 
Maximum tolerated dose: During the Dose Exploration Phase, CPX-351 dosing was initiated at 44 mg/m2 
daunorubicin and 100 mg/m2 cytarabine in 9 subjects. No DLTs were observed and dosing was escalated 
to 59 mg/m2 daunorubicin and 134 mg/m2 cytarabine. At this dose, 2/5 subjects experienced DLTs (1 
DLT of Grade 3 headache and 1 DLT of Grade 3 pain). Therefore, the MTD was declared to be a CPX-351 
dose of 44 mg/m2 daunorubicin and 100 mg/m2 cytarabine administered IV once daily on Days 1, 3 and 
5. This dose was used in the Expanded Phase. One subject in the Expanded Phase experienced a DLT PT 
Platelet count decreased (Grade 4) which resolved in 2 days. The investigator considered the event to be 
probably related to CPX-351. 
Premedications and Concomitant Medications 
Paediatrics and Young Adults 
Subjects  were  not  routinely  premedicated  for  hypersensitivity  or  for  potential  infusion-related  reactions 
prior to the first infusion of the first treatment course. If a subject developed a hypersensitivity reaction, 
then the subject should have been premedicated at subsequent infusions. Subjects were also allowed to 
Assessment report  
EMA/665588/2022 
Page 70/96 
 
 
 
 
receive ongoing supportive and palliative care (e.g., pain control) as clinically indicated throughout each 
study.  
As expected, the RR-AML subject populations were heavily pre-treated. For AAML1421, the baseline mean 
prior anthracycline use is reported as 344.51 (96.461) mg/m2. For Study CPX-MA-1201, based on protocol 
inclusion  criteria,  all  subjects  reported  receiving  prior  therapy  to  treat  their  AML  or  ALL.  Specifically,  all 
subjects  reported  receiving  chemotherapy;  10/23 subjects  with  AML  (43.5%)  and  1/4 subject  with  ALL 
(25.0%)  reported  receiving  a  transplant;  and  1/23 subjects  with  AML  (4.3%)  and  3/4 subjects  with  ALL 
(75.0%) reported receiving radiation. 
Considering  the  study  population  of  subjects  with  RR-AML  undergoing  aggressive  chemotherapy 
concomitant medications used across the paediatric Studies AAML1421 and CPX-MA-1201 were as expected 
in this context. For these studies the subjects were allowed to receive ongoing supportive care as clinically 
indicated throughout the study, however, no data on concomitant medications are available in the datasets. 
Adverse events  
A summary of AEs that occurred on or after the first dose of study medication administration is provided 
below for the pediatric RR-AML studies (AAML1421 and CPX-MA-1201). 
Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  that  occurred  after  study  medication  administration  (regardless  of 
relatedness to study medication) were reported for each dose level.  
Study AAML1421 
The majority of subjects experienced TEAEs and related TEAEs during the study. More than half of subjects 
experienced  serious  TEAEs,  and  related  serious  TEAEs.  The  majority  of  subjects  (89.5%)  experienced 
events  categorized  as  ≥ Grade 3,  with  4 subjects  (10.5%)  experiencing  Grade 4  TEAEs,  and  1 subject 
(2.6%) experiencing a Grade 5 TEAE. No subjects went off protocol therapy due to unacceptable toxicity.

Note: Relationship to study drug was identified using a scale of definite, probable, possible, unlikely, and unrelated and was assessed by the investigator 
and captured in  the  CRF question “AE  attribution to  CPX-351.”  A  related TEAE  was a  response of “possible, probable,  and  definite”  to  the CRF 
question “AE attribution to CPX-351”. 
Note: Percentages are based on N. Note: Subjects received Cycle 1 CPX-351 dose of 59 mg/m2 daunorubicin and 135 mg/m2 cytarabine treatment in 
Dose-finding Phase and Efficacy Phase.  
Study CPX-MA-1201 
All  subjects  experienced  TEAEs  during  the  study  (Table  30).  In  the  Dose  Exploration  Phase,  all  subjects 
who  received  Dose  Level 1  (CPX-351  dose  of  44 mg/m2  daunorubicin  and  100 mg/m2  cytarabine) 
experienced TEAEs and related TEAEs. A total of 2/4 subjects (50.0%) experienced SAEs and 2/4 subjects 
(50.0%) experienced related SAEs. No subjects experienced DLTs. Dosing was subsequently escalated to 
test Dose Level 2 (CPX-351 dose of 59 mg/m2 daunorubicin and 134 mg/m2 cytarabine). At this Dose Level 
all  5 subjects  experienced  TEAEs,  SAEs,  or  related  TEAEs  or  related  SAEs.  Two  subjects  (40.0%) 
experienced events classified as DLTs. Therefore, all subjects in the Expanded Phase received Dose Level 1 
(CPX-351 dose of 44 mg/m2 daunorubicin and 100 mg/m2 cytarabine). 
In  the  Expanded  Phase,  all  18 subjects  experienced  TEAEs  and  related  TEAEs.  A  total  of  16 subjects 
(88.9%)  experienced  SAEs  and  15 subjects  (83.3%)  experienced  related  SAEs.  One  subject  in  the 
Expanded Phase experienced an event classified as a DLT. 
Among the 22 subjects who received a CPX-351 dose of 44 mg/m2 daunorubicin and 100 mg/m2 cytarabine 
(regardless of whether it was in the Dose Exploration Phase or the Expanded Phase), all experienced TEAEs 
and  related  TEAEs.  A  total  of  18/22 subjects  (81.8%)  experienced  SAEs,  and  17 subjects  (77.3%) 
experienced related SAEs. 
All subjects experienced Grade 3 and Grade 4 events. No subjects experienced Grade 5 TEAEs. 
The  AEs/SAEs  at  a  higher  dose  of  CPX-351  dose  of  59 mg/m2  daunorubicin  and  135 mg/m2  cytarabine 
(Study AAML1421)  were  similar  to  those  at  a  CPX-351  dose  of  44 mg/m2  daunorubicin  and  100 mg/m2 
cytarabine (Study CPX-MA-1201) in the pediatric population and young adults up to 21 years of age.

Abbreviations: AE = adverse event, CRF = case report form; DLT = dose limiting toxicity; TEAE = treatment-emergent 
adverse event.  Error! Reference source not found.A TEAE was defined as any event with onset date on or after the first dose of 
study drug until 30 days after the last dose, or any ongoing event that worsened in severity after the date of the first 
dose of  study drug  up  to  and  including  30 days  after  the  last  dose of study drug.  ii) A  TEAE  was  classified  as  related 
based  on  a  response  of  “Possible”,  “Definite”,  “Probably”  to  the  CRF  question  “AE  attribution  to  CPX-351”.  Note: 
Percentages were based on N. 
Note: 1 unit CPX-351 = 1 mg cytarabine and 0.44 mg daunorubicin. Note: Treatment-emergent adverse event severity 
was graded by the investigator as Grade 1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe or medically significant but not immediately 
life-threatening, 4: life-threatening, or 5: death. Maximum grade was captured in the CRF. 
Common Adverse Events 
Study AAML1421 
Overall (N = 38 subjects), the reported TEAEs were most frequently categorized in the SOCs Infections and 
Infestations  (20 subjects,  52.6%),  Blood  and  Lymphatic  System  Disorders  (19 subjects,  50.0%), 
Investigations  (18 subjects,  47.4%),  and  Skin  and  subcutaneous  (SC)  Tissue  Disorders  (18 subjects, 
47.4%) (Table 31.). The most frequently reported TEAEs (i.e., those occurring in ≥ 25% of subjects) listed 
by  decreasing  frequency  were  Febrile  neutropenia,  Rash  maculopapular,  and  Electrocardiogram  QT 
prolonged.  
The high incidences of TEAEs related to myelosuppression were expected given the known consequences 
of intensive chemotherapy and are consistent with the known safety profile for this agent. Of note, subjects 
were  on  concomitant  therapy  with  other  drugs  known  to  prolong  the  QT  interval  (e.g.,  azole  antifungal 
prophylaxis).

Serious Adverse Events 
Study AAML1421 
Serious TEAEs (SAEs) occurred in 21/38 subjects (55.3%). The majority of SAEs were reported in the SOCs 
Blood  and  Lymphatic  System  Disorders  and  Infections  and  Infestations  (11/38 subjects,  28.9%  in  each 
class). As expected in this subject population, and consistent with results of other studies of CPX-351, the 
most commonly reported SAE was febrile neutropenia (11/38 subjects, 28.9%; Table 35).

Deaths 
Study AAML1421 
No  deaths  occurred  while  subjects  received  protocol  therapy.  A  total  of  12 deaths  occurred  during  the 
protocol-defined Follow-up Phase (i.e., after subjects had completed the Treatment Phase of the study); 
none  of  these  were  considered  related  to  protocol  therapy.  A  total  of  8 deaths  were  due  to  progressive 
disease and 4 were due to other causes. Half of the deaths (6/12 deaths) were reported within the 6-month 
Follow-up  Period  (FU 1),  4 deaths  were  reported  within  the  1-year  FU 2,  and  death  was  reported  for 
1 subject each at the 2-year (FU 3) and 3-year (FU 4) periods.  
Study CPX-MA-1201 
No deaths occurred while subjects received protocol therapy. A total of 10 subjects died during the protocol-
defined follow-up period and were due to disease progression. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Study AAML1421 and study CPX MA 1201: there were no AEs of special interest (AESIs) prespecified for 
the RR-AML paediatric studies.   
Laboratory findings 
According to the MAH, routine laboratory monitoring of haematology, electrolytes, blood chemistry and 
urine and regular assessments of vital signs and physical condition were performed by Investigators for 
monitoring the safety of all subjects but were not collected as part of the study data. These routine 
laboratory assessments were recorded in the subjects’ medical record. AEs identified from laboratory 
parameters were to be reported on the AE CRF. Therefore, routine lab results are not included or 
discussed in the CSRs. 
Hematology 
Transfusions of platelets and red blood cells can ameliorate the worst consequences of thrombocytopenia 
and anaemia in most, but not all cases; during the CPX-351 clinical program transfusions were administered 
frequently. 
Absolute Neutrophil Count 
Study AAML1421 
Although ANC values were not provided in the datasets for AAML1421, responses were verified based on 
data  available  in  the  CRF,  including  marrow  blast  percentage  and  threshold  levels  for  ANC  and  platelet 
counts at the end of induction (ANC ≥ 1 × 109/L versus < 1 × 109/L and platelets ≥ 100 × 109/L versus 
< 100 × 109/L, respectively). 
Additionally, the time to peripheral ANC recovery is as follows: at the end of Cycle 1, the mean (SD) time 
to  ANC  recovery  overall  among  subjects  with  CR  or  CRp  was  44.3 (7.21)  days.  The  mean  time  to  ANC 
recovery was similar for subjects participating in the Dose-finding Phase and the Efficacy Phase. 
Assessment report  
EMA/665588/2022 
Page 81/96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At the end of Cycle 2, the mean (SD) time to ANC recovery overall among subjects with CR or CRp was 
74.2 (11.16) days. 
Study CPX-MA-1201 
Among  subjects  who  received  a  CPX-351  dose  of  44 mg/m2  daunorubicin  and  100 mg/m2  cytarabine 
(regardless of whether it was in the Dose Exploration Phase or the Expanded Phase), most subjects had 
Grade 4 abnormal ANC levels. The exceptions included 1 subject with Grade 0 ANC levels (within normal 
limits) at baseline and during treatment, and 2 subjects with abnormal Grade 4 ANC levels at baseline who 
improved to Grade 2 and Grade 3 during treatment. 
During  treatment,  among  subjects  who  received  CPX-351  at  a  dose  of  59 mg/m2  daunorubicin  and 
134 mg/m2 cytarabine in the Dose Exploration Phase, all subjects had Grade 4 abnormal ANC levels. 
Platelet Count 
Study AAML1421 
Although  laboratory  values  for  AAML1421  are  not  presented  in  the  datasets,  of  note,  hematologic  DLTs 
were defined as failure to recover a peripheral ANC > 500/μL and non-transfusion dependent platelet count 
> 20,000/μL due to documented bone marrow aplasia/hypoplasia (that is, not due to malignant infiltration) 
for ≥ 50 days from the start of the therapeutic cycle. Failure to recover peripheral counts due to disease 
involvement of the bone marrow were not considered dose-limiting. 
In the Efficacy Phase, if after Cycle 1 a subject had a hypoplastic bone marrow for ≥ 60 days and failure to 
recover a peripheral ANC > 500/μL and a non-transfusion dependent platelet count > 20,000/μL not due 
to  malignant  infiltration  or  severe  infection  (defined  as  ≥ Grade 3  infection),  they  were  considered  a 
treatment failure and went off protocol therapy. 
Study CPX-MA-1201 
Among  subjects  who  received  a  CPX-351  dose  of  44 mg/m2  daunorubicin  and  100 mg/m2  cytarabine 
(regardless of whether it was in the Dose Exploration Phase or the Expanded Phase), 6 subjects had normal 
platelet levels at baseline. Three subjects had Grade 4 abnormal platelet levels at baseline, and all but 1 of 
these subjects improved to Grade 3 during study treatment. 
During treatment, among subjects who received a CPX-351 dose of 59 mg/m2 daunorubicin and 134 mg/m2 
cytarabine in the Dose Exploration Phase, most subjects had ≤ Grade 2 abnormal platelet levels at baseline. 
During study treatment, platelet levels remained relatively stable for most subjects, with the exception of 
1 subject who had Grade 1 abnormal platelet levels at baseline and had Grade 3 abnormal platelet levels 
during treatment. 
Hemoglobin 
Study AAML1421 and Study CPX-MA-1201 
Regular assessments of haemoglobin were performed by Investigators to monitor subject safety, but were 
not collected as part of the study data. These routine assessments were recorded in the subject medical 
records. Adverse Events identified from assessments of haemoglobin were to be reported on the AE CRF 
but were not reported in the laboratory datasets.

Study AAML1421 and Study CPX-MA-1201 
Serum creatinine levels were performed by Investigators to monitor the safety of all subjects but were not 
collected as part of the study data. These routine laboratory assessments were recorded in the subjects’ 
medical records. Adverse event identified from the assessments of serum creatinine were to be reported 
on  the  AE  CRF.  Therefore,  these  results  are  not  included  or  discussed  for  Study AAML1421  and  Study 
CPX-MA-1201. 
Serum Bilirubin 
Study AAML1421 and Study CPX-MA-1201 
Serum bilirubin levels were performed by Investigators for monitoring the safety of all subjects, but were 
not collected as part of the study datasets for AAML1421 and Study CPX-MA-1201. These routine laboratory 
assessments were recorded in the subjects’ medical record. Adverse Events identified from assessments of 
serum bilirubin were to be reported on the AE CRF. Therefore, these results are not included or discussed 
for these studies. 
Urinalysis 
Urinalysis was conducted in each of the clinical trials within the CPX-351 clinical development program. No 
remarkable findings of any clinical concern were reported. 
Serum Copper  
Since CPX-351 contains copper encapsulated in the liposome, which acts as a chelating agent to maintain 
a slow release rate for daunorubicin, subjects were monitored for serum copper concentrations during each 
of the clinical studies conducted in the CPX-351 development program.  
Study AAML1421 
Serum copper values were not reported for AAML1421. 
Study CPX-MA-1201 
Serum copper levels increased from Baseline by Day 5 up to a mean of 800 μg/dL. Of note, the upper limit 
of  quantitation  of  serum  copper  concentration  by  the  clinical  laboratory  assay  was  800 μg/dL.  Values 
≥ 800 μg/dL were reported as 800 μg/dL. Serum copper levels generally returned to baseline levels by the 
completion of course 1.  
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Vital Sign Data  
For  the  paediatric  studies AAML1421  and  CPX-MA-1201,  regular  assessments  of  vital  signs  and  physical 
condition were performed by Investigators for monitoring subject safety, but were not collected as part of 
the study data. These routine assessments were recorded in the subjects’ medical record. Adverse events 
identified  from  assessments  of  vital  signs  and  physical  condition  were  to  be  reported  on  the  AE  CRF. 
Therefore, these results were not available for inclusion or discussion in this submission.  
Electrocardiogram Data  
Inclusion criteria in both studies required adequate cardiac function, defined as: Shortening fraction of 
≥ 27% by echocardiogram, or Ejection fraction of ≥ 50% by radionuclide angiogram or echocardiogram. 
Study 1421 additionally required a Bazett’s corrected QT (QTcB) interval < 500 msecs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/665588/2022 
Page 83/96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study AAML1421 
Measures  of  left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  (LVEF)  and  left  ventricular  shortening  Fraction  (LVSF)  over 
time were assessed by ECHO. In addition, QT interval was assessed by ECG over 2 cycles of therapy and 
follow-up. The highest corrected QT interval (QTc) was summarized. Measures of cardiac function revealed 
limited impact of CPX-351 during the course of the study. Mean and median LVSF and LVEF values assessed 
during ECHO remained near or within normal limits.  
Study AAML1421 Corrected QT Interval 
Treatment with CPX-351 did not significantly impact QTc intervals during the course of the study. While a 
trend towards increasing mean and median QTcs was seen through Follow-up 1, values returned to baseline 
(study entry) by the time of Follow-up. Results of mean and median QTcs at Follow-up 3 and Follow-up 4 
should be interpreted with caution due to the low number of subjects with ECG evaluations. 
There were 7 events of QTc prolongation in the Cycle 1 reporting period; all were Grade 1, and 3/7 were 
related  to  study  medication.  One  subject  recorded  a  corrected  QT  > 500 msec  during  Follow-up 1.  The 
event was reported as an AE (CTCAE Grade 3) with the PT Electrocardiogram QT prolonged. Eight additional 
subjects recorded a corrected QT ≥ 480 msec and 11/38 subjects overall (28.9%) experienced TEAEs with 
the PT Electrocardiogram QT prolonged. None of these 11 events was ≥ Grade 3.  
Of note, subjects were on concomitant therapy with other drugs known to prolong the QT interval (e.g., 
azole antifungal prophylaxis). Three events (2 unrelated and 1 related) occurred during concurrent infection 
events (pneumonia in 2 subjects and mucosal infection in 1 subject).

Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors  
Exposure-response in Pediatrics and Young Adults 
An exposure-response (ER) analysis of safety was performed to include the paediatric population based on 
data  from  a  total  of  46 (18.5%)  paediatric  subjects  (1  to  17 years  old)  from  Study CPX-MA-1201  and 
Study AAML1421  and  204 (81.5%)  adults  (≥ 18 years)  from  Study 101,  Study  206,  and  Study 301. 
Subjects  were  dosed  with  either  44 mg/m2  daunorubicin  and  100 mg/m2  cytarabine  or  59 mg/m2 
daunorubicin and 135 mg/m2 cytarabine. Exposure-response analysis in this combined adult and paediatric

population determined the impact of drug exposure on the probability of the most frequent TEAEs reported 
which included the PT Neutropenia reported in 141/178 (79.2%) subjects with the “blood and lymphatic 
system  disorders”  SOC  and  the  PT  Rash  reported  in  79/203 (38.9%)  of  subjects  with  “skin  and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders” SOC. The effect of cytarabine maximum concentration (Cmax) or area under 
the concentration-time curve 0 to 48 (AUC0-48) on the probability of neutropenia were statistically significant 
(p = 0.0011  and  p = 0.0354,  respectively).  The  odds  ratio  for  the  Cmax  of  cytarabine  was  1.015,  which 
suggests  that  the  odds  of  response  increased  by  approximately  1.5%  for  each  1 unit  increment  of 
cytarabine  Cmax  (i.e.  1 µg/mL).  The  Cmax  and  AUC0-48  of  cytarabine  was  also  a  statistically  significant 
predictor of the probability of rash (p = 0.0092 and p = 0.0354, respectively), with and odds ratio of 1.012.  
These results suggest that both the Cmax or AUC0-48 of cytarabine are predicative of neutropenia and rash. 
Similar to what observed in previous ER analysis for safety, when assessing the probability of any Grade 3 
to 5 TEAE in the paediatric population only (Study CPX-MA-1201 and Study AAML1421), no apparent ER 
relationship  was  observed.  Additionally,  in  the  paediatric  population,  no  statistically  significant  effect  of 
cytarabine Cmax was observed on the time to recovery of ANC or time to platelet recovery.  
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
No clinical data are available regarding the safety of CPX-351 during pregnancy or lactation.  
Women  of  childbearing  potential  should  avoid  becoming  pregnant  while  receiving  CPX-351.  Women  of 
childbearing  potential  should  use  effective  contraception  while  they  or  their  male  partner  undergo 
treatment. Women of childbearing potential should not receive treatment until pregnancy is excluded. 
Women of childbearing potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of CPX-351. Men with 
sexual partners of reproductive potential, and women should use effective contraception during treatment 
and for 6 months following the last dose of CPX-351. 
Extrinsic Factors 
Specific data extrinsic factors were not collected during clinical studies of CPX-351. A relationship between 
these factors and CPX-351 exposure is unknown.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal assessments of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between CPX-351 and other agents have 
been conducted. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In study AAML1421, there were no TEAEs leading to discontinuation.  
In study CPX-MA-1201, AE data was not collected to enable reporting of discontinuations due to TEAEs.

Estimated  cumulative  exposure  in  ongoing  and  completed  Jazz  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.-sponsored 
interventional  clinical  trials  is  Vyxeos  (CPX-351)  n = 475  through  02 August 2020.  Vyxeos  Periodic 
Benefit-risk Evaluation Report (PBRER), dated 06 October 2020, is the 6th semi-annual report submitted to 
the US and the 4th PBRER (PSUR) submitted to the EU. It summarizes the cumulative safety profile from 
clinical trials and post marketing data covering the period 03 February 2020 through 02 August 2020 (MAA 
EMEA/H/C/004282 SN-0039, submitted 09 October 2020). The PBRER details benefit-risk information for 
Vyxeos  including  a  cumulative  and  interval  summary  tabulation  of  serious  and  non-serious  adverse 
reactions from post marketing data sources.  
As of the current PBRER (dated 03 April 2020), no actions (e.g., failure to obtain or apply for marketing 
approval  renewal,  withdrawal  or  suspension  of  a  marketing  approval,  or  suspension  of  supply)  by  Jazz 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. due to a safety reason have been taken.  
Literature search 
Given that the cytarabine and daunorubicin components of CPX-351 have been marketed for over 40 years, 
a literature search (March 2017 using EMBASE, MEDLINE; via Embase.com) was conducted by the MAH to 
summarize the known safety contributions of the individual agents. The following summarizes specific areas 
of literature search regarding known safety effects of cytarabine and daunorubicin.  
Myelosuppression 
Administration of anthracyclines is associated with significant bone marrow suppression, frequent infections 
(as a result of neutropenia), increased risk for bleeding events (resulting from thrombocytopenia) (Atallah 
et el 2007) (Moreau et al. 2009) (Gupta et al. 2010). 
Cardiotoxicity 
Administration of anthracyclines is associated with cardiac toxicity (specifically associated with higher doses 
of  daunorubicin  administered  for  longer  durations)  (Volkova,  2011),  (Von  Hoff,  1979).  Total  cumulative 
doses  of  greater  than  550mg/m2  have  been  associated  with  an  increased  incidence  of  drug  induced 
congestive  heart  failure.  This  limit  appears  lower  in  patients  who  received  radiation  therapy  to  the 
mediastinum. 
Total cumulative doses of daunorubicin greater than 550mg/m2 have been associated with an increased 
incidence  of  drug  induced  congestive  heart  failure  (Tan  2015).  Prior  therapy  with  anthracyclines,  pre-
existing cardiac disease, previous mediastinal radiotherapy or concomitant use of cardiotoxic drugs may 
increase the risk of daunorubicin induced cardiac toxicity. (Volkova, 2011; Menna 2012). 
The use of adjuvant chemotherapeutic agents known to be cardio-toxic increases the risk of heart failure 
among  radiation-treated  patients  (Senkus-Konefka  and  Jasseem  2007)  History  of  chest  irradiation  is  a 
cardiac risk factor (Anderson and. Sawyer 2008). 
Risk factors for cardiotoxicity include cumulative dose and concomitant treatment with cyclophosphamide, 
trastuzumab or paclitaxel (Volkova, 2011). 
Myocarditis 
Rare  instances  of  pericarditis-myocarditis,  not  dose-related,  can  occur  with  the  use  of  anthracyclines. 
Clinically,  early  cardiac  side  effects  are  typically  reversible  and  self-limiting  and  include  dysrhythmia, 
repolarization changes in the electrocardiogram, pericarditis, and less frequently myocarditis (Senkus and 
Jassem 2011). These complications do not preclude further anthracycline use (Suter and Ewer 2013).

Renal and Hepatic Impairment 
Significant  hepatic  or  renal  impairment  may  increase  the  risk  of  toxicity  associated  with  cytarabine  and 
daunorubicin. Renal insufficiency is a risk factor in the development of cerebral toxicity during cytarabine 
treatment (Hasle 1990) (Damon et al. 1989). Anthracyclines are primarily metabolized by the liver with 
approximately 50% excreted via bile (Barker et al. 2016). 
Hyperuricemia 
Metabolic abnormalities characteristic of Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) include abnormally high serum uric 
acid  levels  (hyperuricemia).  TLS  typically  occurs  after  the  initiation  of  anticancer  therapies,  including 
cytotoxic  drugs,  biological  agents,  corticosteroids,  hormones,  and  radiation  therapy,  in  patients  with 
hematologic  malignancies  or  solid  tumours  that  are  highly  treatment  sensitive.  Daunorubicin  has  a 
nephrotoxic potential (Mughal et al. 2010) 
Tissue Necrosis 
Anthracyclines  can  persist  in  tissues  for  weeks  or  even  months  after  extravasation.  The  local  area  of 
extravasation is at high risk of infection, because of both the local necrosis and in general by the impaired 
immunological  state  of  most  patients  receiving  this  kind  of  treatment.  For  significant  anthracycline 
extravasations, there is a high risk of ulceration and a possible need for surgery (Langer et al. 2009, Jordan 
et al. 2009) 
Hypersensitivity and Rash 
Hand-foot syndrome (palmoplantar erythrodysesthesia) may result from liposomal anthracyclines (Reyes 
et al. 2014)). Studies show that liposomal formulations of anticancer drugs are less toxic than the non-
encapsulated formulations, although some liposome-specific adverse effects such as various skin reactions, 
and also hypersensitivity reactions have been reported (Slingerland et al. 2012).  
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have been reported with daunorubicin 
and cytarabine (Cytarabine PI; Daunorubicin PI). 
Gastrointestinal events 
Administration of anthracyclines is associated with GI side effects (such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea). 
Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (Hesketh 2008; Peric and Reeves, 2015.)  
1.7.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In support of this variation and safety, the MAH submitted two paediatric studies. Study AAML1421 was a 
phase 1/2, open label, single-arm, dose escalating study of CPX-351 followed by fludarabine, cytarabine 
and filgrastim (FLAG) in 38 paediatric and young adult patients (age range from 1 to 21 years) with RR-
AML; study CPX-MA-1201 was a phase 1, open label, single arm, dose escalating, pilot study of CPX-351 
in paediatric and young adult patients (age range from 1 to 19 years), with RR-AML or acute lymphocytic 
leukaemia (ALL).  
In general, the safety findings in paediatric studies were relatively consistent with those observed in adult 
patients. Within serious and serious related TEAEs, febrile neutropenia occurred at a significantly higher 
rate in both paediatric studies than in the adult studies: in study 1421, frequency was 28.9%, all were 
considered related, whereas in the pooled adult population, frequency was 10.1%, considering induction 
only 5.3%. The MAH further clarified, that no new or unexpected safety findings were evident from the 
Assessment report  
EMA/665588/2022 
Page 87/96 
 
 
 
 
 
analysis of the paediatric data compared to safety data obtained from adult studies and the post 
marketing experience. 
Increasing the intensity of induction chemotherapy to enhance overall survival often comes at the cost of   
high treatment-related toxicity. As such, mortality rates following initiation of therapy are considered 
important measures of SAEs. Specifically, mortality rates at day 30 and day 60 are generally considered 
as markers of early death associated with treatment. 
No deaths occurred while subjects received protocol therapy. In study AAML1421 total of 12 deaths 
occurred during the protocol-defined Follow-up Phase (i.e., after subjects had completed the Treatment 
Phase of the study); none of these were judged to be related to protocol therapy. A total of 8 deaths were 
due to progressive disease and 4 were due to other causes. Half of the deaths (6/12 deaths) were 
reported within the 6-month Follow-up Period, 4 deaths were reported within the 1 year, and death was 
reported for 1 subject each at the 2 year and 3-year periods. 
The MAH clarified that all deaths appeared not to be related to treatment with Vyxeos. Clustering on any 
certain age strata was not clearly evident.  
According to the MAH, in study AAML1421, there were no TEAEs leading to discontinuation and such data 
was not accrued in the pilot study.  
Administration of anthracyclines is associated with cardiac toxicity, specifically with higher doses of 
daunorubicin administered for longer period of time. Rare instances of pericarditis-myocarditis, not dose-
related, can also occur. It can also be associated with reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 
and congestive heart failure. Acknowledging the inherent high morbidity of the patients under study, the 
results of ECHO and ECG measurements appeared not to cause any specific, major concerns in this 
limited study sample (study AAML1421). ECG and QT results suggest only a minor effect on the QTc 
interval with 1 QT prolongation >500ms (grade 3) at the 135 U/m² dose of CPX-351 in paediatrics, which 
overall confirms conclusions in adults. Regarding cardiac function it appeared that LVSF remained stable, 
whereas LVEF appeared to decrease slightly from BL. Nearly 25% of patients (8 of 35) experienced 
reduced LVEF ≤ 50% during the study. However, follow-up data are from 1-2 patients only. 1 SAE of 
decreased ejection fraction (36%, grade 3) was reported as DLT during cycle 1. Overall, frequency of 
cardiac/QT-related TEAEs was higher in both paediatric studies than in adult studies. It is deemed 
appropriate to explore exposure-response for cardiotoxicity-related TEAEs, also considering cumulative 
doses. Further, for study 1201 cardiac no ECG and ECHO results are available. 
Furthermore, drug-induced prolongation of the QT/QTc interval is usually asymptomatic, and an increased 
rate of certain adverse events in patients taking an investigational agent can signal potential 
proarrhythmic effects. In study AAML1421 one event was reported as an TEAE (CTCAE Grade 3) with the 
PT Electrocardiogram QT prolonged. Eight additional subjects recorded a corrected QT ≥ 480 msec and 
11/38 subjects overall (28.9%) experienced TEAEs of QT prolongation. None of these 11 events was ≥ 
Grade 3. Firm conclusions on the basis of the results, including the incidences of AE/SAE on cardiac 
safety, cannot, however, be made. Confounding by concomitant therapy with other drugs known to 
prolong the QT interval may, according to the MAH, also be present.  
Available evidence of the cardiotoxic potential of Vyxeos liposomal has been reflected in the product 
information which states that  cardiac disorders (including sinus tachycardia, QT prolongation and ejection 
fraction decreased ) were observed in studies in anthracycline pre-treated children with relapsed or 
refractory AML treated with a single induction cycle (Cycle 1) of Vyxeos liposomal.  Several other long-
term studies of treatment with anthracycline/ anthracenedione in children suggest that congestive 
cardiomyopathies with a latency of many years may occur 
Patients with AML or ALL suffer from impaired hematopoietic function and often present with anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia and abnormal neutrophil counts prior to receiving treatment. Due to the nature of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/665588/2022 
Page 88/96 
 
 
 
 
disease, treatment-related myelosuppression is an important safety concern monitored by evaluation of 
laboratory parameters including absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and platelet counts. Reductions in ANC 
and platelet production directly influence the frequency of acute myelosuppression-related downstream 
AEs, such as susceptibility to infections and increased risk of bleeding/anaemia. Furthermore, due to the 
nature of the disease and intensive treatment required, monitoring renal and hepatic function enables 
optimization of treatment and clinical management of patients with AML.  
The impact of intrinsic factors including demographic subgroups of age, race, gender, renal impairment 
and hepatic impairment on the safety of CPX-351 were not evaluated in the paediatric patients. Also, any 
possible relationship between extrinsic factors and CPX 351 exposure is unknown, as specific data were 
not collected during the clinical studies. No data on transfusions were provided other than that they were 
frequent. Furthermore, there were no AEs of special interest (AESIs) prespecified for the RR-AML 
paediatric studies.  
Further uncertainties remain with respect the safety of Vyxeos liposomal in the treatment of paediatric 
and young adult patients with RR-AML. Even acknowledging the orphan status of Vyxeos liposomal, the 
overall numbers of patients under study are small and derive mainly from a sole phase 1/2 study 
AAML1421. The open label, single arm design also limits the interpretation of the safety results. In 
addition, the long-term safety data derives mainly from this single, open label, single arm, phase 1/2 
study and are, to date, partly pending, as the LTE of this study is still ongoing. The MAH clarified that the 
current CSR is to be considered as the final one. A sentence on lack of long-term data especially on 
cardiac safety has been added to the PI and is acceptable. The requested text on the lack of overall 
paediatric safety data beyond the duration of the provided clinical trials has also been added, on request. 
The effects of Vyxeos liposomal on growth and maturation was not evaluated in the submitted studies. A 
sentence on the lack of these data has been added to the SmPC. 
The number of reported AEs and SAEs is high; however, high toxicity can be expected in the target 
population given the known consequences of intensive chemotherapy in a heavily pre-treated patient 
population. Based on the provided data from these 2 investigator-initiated trials, the overall clinical safety 
of CPX 351 seems tolerable and acceptable for the treatment of paediatric patients > 1 years with R/R 
AML, notwithstanding the limitations of the provided safety data. It is advantageous that both drug 
substances in non-liposomal intravenous formulations are known and used for years in the treatment of 
paediatric AML. Safety concerns pertains also to the question of anthracycline pre-treatment and maximal 
cumulative dose of daunorubicin to prevent long-term cardiotoxicity. Studies excluded patients above 
certain pre-dose thresholds, but it is unclear whether current recommendations for upper limits were 
followed.  
It is, furthermore, noted that at the time of the original MAA the data submitted was not considered 
sufficient for the indication of adult RR-AML. This inherently means that there is no adequate trial for 
Vyxeos liposomal with a positive benefit-risk in the treatment of adults with RR-AML. Text on this issue 
has been adequately added to the SmPC.  
Some question concerning safety were raised based on the original documentation submitted to support 
the extension of the Vyxeos indication to paediatric and young adult patients with RR-AML. The MAH 
chose mostly not to answer these questions on the basis that it was no longer pursuing the extension of 
the indication and these data are thus not needed.  
The current paediatric safety data concern a different indication compared to the approved adult 
indication. However, relevant safety information has been reflected in Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
On the basis of the submitted data on the safety profile of Vyxeos liposomal in the treatment of RR-AML 
in paediatric patients no major objections concerning safety were raised. All open safety issues, OCs, 
Assessment report

have been resolved; no unresolved issues remain thus, this variation  is considered approvable from the 
safety point of view. 
1.7.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  of  Vyxeos  liposomal  in  the  paediatric  pre-treated  R/R  AML  population,  appeared,  in 
general,  to  be  comparable  to  that  of  the  treatment-naïve  adult  population.  There  are  no  outstanding 
concerns regrading the safety of the product from the available data and thus the variation of the marketing 
authorisation for Vyxeos liposomal to update sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC is considered from a 
safety point of view, approvable.  
1.7.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
1.8.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 1.1 with this application. As the new proposed indication was 
withdrawn the submitted updated RMP is no longer applicable. 
1.9.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this variation, sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed indication was initially for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML in paediatric and young 
adult patients aged 1 to 21 years old. The aim of treatment for patients with relapsed AML is to prolong 
survival.  
2.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Long-term  survival  rates  of  pediatric  AML  patients  are  currently  70%  or  even  higher.  Current  first  line 
treatment strategy that includes four to five courses of intensive myelosuppressive chemotherapy, mainly 
based on anthracyclines and cytarabine with or without (HSCT). 
Regarding  novel  agents,  treatment  modalities,  targeted  therapies  and  drugs  such  as  venetoclax, 
monoclonal antibodies, and cellular therapies are investigated in AML.  
However,  up  to  40%  of  the  children  the  AML  relapses,  with  a  probability  of  long-term  survival  of 
approximately 40%. These poor outcomes indicate the need for improved treatment, including innovative 
drugs and treatment modalities.  
Assessment report  
EMA/665588/2022 
Page 90/96 
 
 
 
 
For patients who relapse, or are refractory to first-line therapy there is a limited number of effective agents 
available. For the reinduction therapy, several agents have used, including re-introduction of anthracyclines 
and  cytarabine.  Other  possibilities  include  use  of  mitoxantrone  (alone  or  in  combination  therapy), 
clofarabine (alone or in combination therapy) and FLAG (alone or in combination therapy). 
Optimal treatment for paediatric relapsed AML is not well defined, regarding optimal chemotherapy, the 
need  for  allo-HSCT,  the  timing  of  an  allo-HSCT  and  risk  group  stratified  treatment  based  on  prognostic 
factors.  However,  allo-HSCT  in  second  complete  remission  (CR2)  after  reinduction  chemotherapy  is 
associated  with  better  outcome  than  chemotherapy  only,  and  once  paediatric  patient  relapses,  working 
toward an allo-HSCT is currently a rule. 
Relapsed paediatric AML carries a poor prognosis and represents an unmet medical need. 
2.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study  AAML1421  was  a  phase  1/2,  multicenter  study  of  CPX-351  for  children  with  AML  in  first  relapse, 
conducted and sponsored by Children’s Oncology Group (COG). The primary objectives of this study were 
to determine a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and the toxicities associated with CPX-351 in pediatric 
and  young  adult  patients  with  relapsed/refractory  AML  and  to  estimate  the  response  rate  (complete 
remission [CR] + complete remission with partial platelet recovery [CRp]) after CPX-351 (Cycle 1) followed 
by fludarabine/cytarabine/G-CSF (FLAG; Cycle 2) in children with AML in first relapse. The MAH was not 
involved in the study conduct, but received the data from the Sponsors and summarised the results of the 
study for the purposes of current regulatory submission. 
This  study  comprised  2  phases:  a  dose-finding  and  an  efficacy  phase  and  altogether  38  patients  were 
included into the study (6 in the dose-finding and 32 in the efficacy phase). In both phases of the study, 
Cycle 1 treatment consisted of 2 doses of intrathecal (IT) cytarabine (age-based dosing) along with CPX-
351 administered IV over 90 minutes on Days 1, 3, and 5. Cycle 2 of therapy consisted of FLAG. All patients 
were treated at the same CPX-351 dose, namely 135 units/m2/dose (i.e. 59 mg/m2 daunorubicin and 135 
mg/m2 cytarabine).  
2.2.  Favourable effects (study AAML1421) 
The primary efficacy endpoint displayed an overall response rate (CR + CRp) of 68% and the best response 
rate (CR + CRp + CRi) of 81% after CPX-351 (cycle 1) followed by FLAG (cycle 2). 
The secondary efficacy endpoint displayed a response rate (CR + CRp) of 43.2% and the best response 
rate (CR + CRp + CRi) of 76% after CPX-351 (cycle 1). 
The  median  OS  was  32.5  months  for  all  37  efficacy  evaluable  patients  and  10.1  months  for  the  7  non-
responders, respectively. In all 26/37 subjects (70.3%) were alive at the time of analysis, or were censored 
before or at the time of analysis. 
2.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The efficacy claims are based on a single, uncontrolled, phase I/II pivotal study. 
Because of the unconventional method to calculate the number of responders (both with regard to primary 
and secondary efficacy endpoint) used in this SAT, the MAH should provide the response rate as a simple 
proportion of responders with the corresponding Clopper-Pearson confidence interval.

Due to the large heterogeneity of the targeted population and the low sample size being included into the 
single pivotal study (n=37), uncertainties regarding efficacy in subgroups of clinically relevant prognostic 
value remain due to incomplete information provided:

time-to-relapse 
CR rate and CR/CRi/CRp rate are not considered established or validated surrogate markers for OS in AML. 
The clinical relevance of CR/CRp/CRi is based on the fact that blast reduction is a prerequisite of a HSCT 
after  (re-)induction  therapy,  being  the  only  therapeutic  option  with  curative  intent  in  a  high-risk  AML 
setting. Data on patients proceeding to a HSCT is incomplete, and follow-up data on OS was not provided, 
and therefore it was not possible to assess the clinical relevance of the reported outcomes. 
2.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In study AAML1421, the majority of subjects experienced TEAEs and related TEAEs during the study. More 
than  half  of  subjects  experienced  serious  TEAEs,  and  related  serious  TEAEs.  The  majority  of  subjects 
(89.5%)  experienced  events  categorized  as  ≥ Grade 3,  with  4 subjects  (10.5%)  experiencing  Grade 4 
TEAEs, and 1 subject (2.6%) experiencing a Grade 5 TEAE.  
The most frequently reported TEAEs by PT (those occurring in ≥ 25% of subjects) were febrile neutropenia, 
maculopapular rash and electrocardiogram QT prolonged. Frequency of TEAEs related to myelosuppression, 
such as anaemia, were seen more often at both doses in the chemotherapy pre-treated paediatrics than in 
treatment  naïve  adult  patients.  The  most  common  TEAE  was  febrile  neutropenia.  Cardiac  TEAEs  (QT 
prolongation, sinus tachycardia, ejection fraction decreased) and rash occurred more often at the higher 
dose.  
For related TEAEs in study 1421, febrile neutropenia was observed at comparable frequency (44.7% vs. 
48.3%) whereas rash was more frequent than in adults (42.1% vs. 32.3%). 
Serious TEAEs (SAEs) occurred in 21/38 subjects (55.3%). The majority of SAEs were reported in the SOCs 
Blood  and  Lymphatic  System  Disorders  and  Infections  and  Infestations  (11/38 subjects,  28.9%  in  each 
class).  The  most  commonly  reported  SAE  was  febrile  neutropenia  (11/38 subjects,  28.9%).  Rash 
maculopapular was reported in 6 subjects (15,8%) and pyrexia in 2 subjects (5.3%).  
Treatment-related SAEs occurred in 20/38 subjects (52.6%). The majority of treatment-related SAEs were 
reported in the SOCs Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (11/38 subjects, 28.9%) and Infections and 
Infestations  (9/38 subjects,  23.7%).  The  most  commonly  reported  treatment-related  SAEs  by  PT  were 
febrile neutropenia (11/38 subjects, 28.9%), rash maculopapular (6/38 subjects, 15.8%) and colitis (2/38 
subjects, 5.3%).  
Within serious and serious related TEAEs, febrile neutropenia occurred at a significantly higher rate in both 
paediatric  studies  than  in  the  adult  studies:  in  study  1421,  frequency  was  28.9%,  all  were  considered 
related, whereas in the pooled adult population, frequency was 10.1%, considering induction only 5.3%. 
LVEF appeared to decrease slightly from BL. Nearly 25% of patients (8 of 35) experienced reduced LVEF 
≤ 50% during the study. 1 SAE of decreased injection fraction (36%, grade 3) was reported as DLT during 
cycle 1.

No deaths occurred while subjects received protocol therapy in either study. A total of 12 deaths occurred 
during the protocol-defined Follow-up Phase (i.e., after subjects had completed the Treatment Phase of the 
study); none of these were considered related to protocol therapy.  
2.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
•  Acknowledging the orphan status of AML, the numbers of paediatric patients are small and derive 
mainly from a sole, single arm, open label study, with 38 paediatric patients (from 1 to 21 years of 
age)  with  relapsed  AML  (phase  1/2  study  AAML1421).  Consequently,  numbers  in  the  different 
paediatric age strata are also small.   
•  No paediatric safety data have been presented, analysed or discussed according to the age strata. 
• 
Long-term safety data derives from this single study: only preliminary data has been provided for 
the events of death and cardiovascular safety. According to the MAH further data is not available.  
• 
Long-term data on subsequent treatments are not available. These data are prerequisite for the 
interpretation of long-term safety.    
•  Considering cumulative exposure to anthracyclines, studies excluded patients above certain pre-
dose thresholds, but due to missing data it is unclear whether current recommendations for upper 
limits,  i.e.  higher  than  the  Vyxeos-SmPC-recommended  maximal  cumulative  anthracycline  dose, 
were followed.

2.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
2.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Vyxeos liposomal has demonstrated that majority of study population (study AAML1421) with relapsed AML 
achieved substantial response and ended up with CR. This is important given the extremely poor prognosis 
of these patients and their unmet medical need. Secondary endpoint supports the primary outcome.  
There is no direct clinical relevance of CR in AML treatment. Its clinical relevance is based on the fact, that 
CR/CRp/CRi  is  normally  aimed  for  as  the  basis  for  HSCT  after  (re-)induction  therapy,  being  the  only 
therapeutic  option  with  curative  intent  in  a  high-risk  AML  setting  as  RR  AML.  However,  while  it  is 
acknowledged that targeting CR2 is of utmost importance, the long-term outcome and contextualisation of 
the observed efficacy results is difficult. This is due limited data available regarding the use of HSCT as 
consolidation in patients achieving response (CR2). Importantly, chemotherapy on its own is not likely to 
have major long-term benefit in patients with relapsed AML.

Since the MAH is no longer pursuing the indication for paediatric patients with R/R AML, it has not provided 
the requested data to assess the clinical relevance of the efficacy results nor provided the requested long-
term efficacy data. Thus, while this data would be of interest, these issues are not pursued further. 
The pivotal study (study AAML1421) included also patients 18-21 years. This issue somewhat complicates 
the  assessment  of  the  efficacy  because  for  these  “young  adult”  patients  there  are  possible  therapeutic 
options, like gilteritinib, available. Efficacy results have not been presented by age category, and therefore 
B/R  cannot  currently  be  assessed.  PopPK  analyses  suggested  that  exposures  increased  significantly  in 
young adults 18-21 years. Based on current PK data, the proposed dose is questionable for young adults 
aged 18-21 years. However, since the MAH is no longer pursuing the indication for paediatric patients with 
R/R AML the acceptability of the proposed indication (wording, patient population, posology) is not relevant 
anymore.  
Considering the limitations of the current paediatric data, deriving mainly from a small, single arm study, 
with limited long-term data and the lack of adequate safety data in adult RR-AML patients, the interpretation 
and  contextualisation  of  the  submitted  paediatric  safety  data  is  somewhat  restricted.  However,  the 
adequacy and sufficiency of the totality of the submitted data for the assessment of the overall safety of 
Vyxeos  liposomal  in  the  treatment  of  paediatric  patients  with  RR-AML  is  considered  acceptable,  in  the 
current setting of a PI texts variation, to inform the prescriber, as per guidance, of the availability of the 
such data.  
2.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Benefit-risk balance of Vyxeos liposomal in paediatric and young adult patients from 1 year of age to 21 
years  of  age  in  the  treatment  of  relapsed  or  refractory  AML  is  negative  but  remains  positive  for  the 
treatment of adults with newly diagnosed, therapy-related   acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) or AML with 
myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). 
2.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The MAH has withdrawn the application for the 1-year additional data marketing exclusivity. 
2.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Vyxeos liposomal remains positive for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed, 
therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-
MRC).

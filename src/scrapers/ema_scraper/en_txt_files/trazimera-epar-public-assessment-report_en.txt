2.1.  Problem statement 
This application concerns a centralised procedure for the marketing authorisation of Trazimera 
(PF-05280014, trastuzumab), developed as a similar biological medicinal product to the innovator product 
Herceptin for intravenous (IV) use, which was approved in the European Union (EU) in August 2000 
(EMEA/H/C/000278). 
Pfizer developed PF-05280014 as a potential biosimilar to the trastuzumab products marketed globally as 
Herceptin (reference product) for the same indications as the reference product, including HER2-positive 
early breast cancer (EBC), metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and metastatic gastric cancer (MGC). 
About the product 
Trastuzumab is a recombinant humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2). Trastuzumab selectively binds to the extracellular domain of HER2 and thereby 
preventing HER2 signalling. In addition trastuzumab binds to fragment crystallizable (Fc) receptors on 
immune effector cells, facilitating immune destruction of HER2-expressing cancer cells.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
The marketing authorisation application of Trazimera is an abridged application for a biosimilar under Article 
10 (4) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC. 
The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 17/02/2011 pertaining to quality, non-clinical and 
clinical aspects of the dossier, and on 27/06/2013 pertaining to quality and clinical aspects. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
PF-05280014 (trastuzumab) is a humanized immunoglobulin 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed 
against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu receptor) that has been developed as a 
biosimilar for Herceptin for the treatment of early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic 
gastric cancer. 
The PF-05280014 finished product is supplied as a lyophilized powder for concentrate solution for infusion in 
a dosage strength of 150 mg. Reconstitution with 7.2 mL of sterile water for injection (SWFI) yields a 
solution containing 21 mg/mL of PF-05280014 at a pH of approximately 6 with the excipients L-histidine, L-
histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, polysorbate 20 and sucrose. The finished product is supplied in a 15 mL 
glass vial sealed with a stopper and an aluminium seal with flip-off plastic cap. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
PF-05280014 (trastuzumab) active substance is a humanised monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 subclass. It is 
a glycoprotein with one N-linked glycosylation site on the Asn300. Trastuzumab selectively binds to the 
extracellular domain of HER2 and thereby preventing HER2 signalling. The known mechanisms of action of 
trastuzumab are binding to HER2 leading to inhibition of cell proliferation, as well as target cell killing via 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity. 
PF-05280014 is an IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody with two identical 450 amino acid (aa) heavy (H) chains 
and two identical 214 aa light (L) chains, covalently linked with four inter-chain disulfide bonds. The N-linked 
glycosylation consensus sequence, NST, in the CH2 region is essentially fully occupied with asialo, core-
fucosylated, complex-type biantennary N-linked glycans with zero and one terminal galactose residues, 
abbreviated as G0F and G1F, respectively. C-terminal lysine (K) is encoded by the H chain expression vector 
cDNA sequence, but is observed only at low levels in the mature, secreted form of PF-05280014, presumably 
due to intracellular processing by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cellular proteases. Therefore, the 
penultimate glycine (G) residue is the predominant H chain C terminus in PF-05280014.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The trastuzumab active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described. The manufacturing 
process for PF-05280014 active substance uses a recombinant CHO cell line. Cells are grown in suspension 
culture using chemically-defined (CD), animal-derived component-free (ACF) media. The main steps of the 
manufacturing process are cell culture, recovery and purification. The process begins with the thawing of cells 
from the working cell bank (WCB) followed by expansion. The purification of PF-05280014 comprises several 
chromatography steps and orthogonal dedicated virus clearance steps  
Active substance is provided in appropriate container closure systems which are compliant with required 
monographs.  
Cells from the working cell bank (WCB) are thawed, and the culture is progressively expanded. During culture 
expansion and maintenance in seed bioreactors critical process parameters and critical material attributes are 
identified and justified with acceptable ranges (alert and termination limits). A production bioreactor culture 
is harvested and clarified by centrifugation and depth filtration to remove cells and debris. Inoculum culture 
from a seed bioreactor is added to production medium in the production bioreactor to a pre-defined target 
seed density.  
After this harvest step, the product is purified by an affinity chromatography step, a virus inactivation step 
followed by ion exchange chromatography steps. The product is then processed through a virus retaining 
filter (VRF) followed by concentration and buffer exchange in an ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) step. The 
excipients are added to the product to achieve the final formulation of active substance, followed by final 
filtration and freezing. For the purification process “process inputs” and “process controls” have been 
provided.  
The process controls include a combination of critical process parameters (CPP), non-critical process 
parameters (non-CPP), critical material attributes (CMA), and in-process tests. Acceptable ranges for input 
process controls (CPP, non-CPP and CMA) have been stated. If the results of these controls are outside of the 
acceptable ranges or control limits, an evaluation of the deviation is performed and the disposition decision 
will be determined based on the outcome of the investigation. The filtered PF-05280014 active substance is 
filled into a suitable container closure system, labeled, frozen, and shipped frozen to the finished product 
manufacturing site.  
Control of Materials 
Sufficient information on the materials used in the manufacture of PF-05280014 active substance have been 
provided. The acceptance criteria for non-compendial raw materials used in the manufacture of PF-05280014 
have been provided. The active substance manufacturing process uses a cell culture media which contains no 
proteins or peptide components of animal, plant, or synthetic origin. The chromatography resins used in the 
purification process of PF-05280014 are standard materials.  
A two-tier cell bank system, consisting of a master cell bank (MCB) and Working Cell Bank (WCB) was 
generated. MCB and WCB were characterised according to ICH requirements, e.g. Q5A (R1), Q5B and Q5D. 
The adventitious agents assays test results indicate that the cell bank is sterile and free of detectable 
mycoplasma and viruses. During routine production, cell culture age is controlled to less than the limit of in 
vitro cell age (LIVCA). The provided data support the proposed PF-05280014 LIVCA. This is supported by 
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018 
Page 12/73 
  
  
 
several assays demonstrating phenotypic and genotypic stability. Data have been provided to indicate that 
the cell line is robust with respect to critical parameters MCB and WCB stability under the defined storage 
conditions will be monitored. All newly prepared WCBs will also be manufactured in accordance with a pre-
specified protocol and cGMP guideline and qualified, complying with ICH Q5D and Q5A (R1).  
Adequate process controls with their control limits for the upstream and downstream process have been 
provided.  
Process Validation 
The validation of the PF-05280014 active substance manufacturing process included three successful process 
performance qualification (PPQ) batches from three independent, consecutive thaws of the WCB. Process 
parameters (inputs) were maintained within pre-defined limits. The process validation was demonstrated by 
meeting pre-determined acceptance criteria for product quality and performance parameters. The 
PF-05280014 manufacturing process has been shown to effectively and consistently remove process-related 
impurities to levels which do not pose a safety risk to patients. The impurities include host cell proteins 
(HCP), DNA, trace elements and organic compounds that were derived from the host cells, medium, or 
purification process.  
In-process pool hold times were validated to demonstrate biochemical stability of PF-05280014 over a 
defined period of time. The active substance is frozen and shipped for finished product manufacture. Testing 
results met the specified acceptance criteria and support shipments of frozen PF-05280014 active substance. 
The establishment of the resin lifetimes was performed at small scale for each of the chromatographic steps.  
In general, the data provided support that the process is well established and robust enough as to yield a 
consistent product. Several other aspects have also been validated or evaluated, including impurity clearance 
(from commercial manufacturing process), in-process hold times and shipping validation.  
Additional process evaluation studies have been carried out, including bioreactor data and impurity data for 
additional batches manufactured before the process validation campaign. The information presented is 
considered adequate.  
Manufacturing process development 
The PF-05280014 active substance manufacturing process was developed using the applicant’s platform 
Chinese hamster ovary host cell line and cell culture and purification mAb processes. All batches executed 
during development were identified as representative of the intended commercial process. Product quality 
results (together with the relative potency) from batches defined as representative are comparable and 
acceptable, meeting the acceptance criteria in place at time of release and the commercial acceptance 
criteria. 
The control strategy for PF-05280014 active substance is linked to finished product. Prior to finalisation of the 
control strategy, both active substance and finished product elements were considered in totality to ensure 
that final finished product quality through shelf life is met. The quality attributes (QAs) have been categorized 
as critical and non-critical, and the output of the criticality risk assessments together with the requirement to 
demonstrate similarity were considered when defining the control strategy applied to the individual 
attributes. The QAs within the control strategy were selected specifically to both monitor process consistency 
and to ensure that the PF-05280014 profile is maintained. For QAs that have been ranked as critical quality

attributes (CQAs), most are controlled through release and stability testing. The relationship between process 
parameters and each of the CQAs was assessed by cause and effect analysis to understand which parameters 
were likely to affect CQAs.  
Risk assessment was performed by assessing the parameters for severity, detectability and occurrence based 
on the potential impact of each parameter on product quality. A final risk priority number (RPN) number was 
assigned to each process parameter evaluated based on multiplying the scores for severity, occurrence and 
detection (SEV x OCC x DET). Lower RPN scores are indicative of acceptable manufacturing ranges and that 
they are controlled with minimal risk to product quality and/or process performance. The production 
bioreactor unit operation was identified as the most important cell culture unit operation affecting product 
quality attributes. Multivariate design of experiments (DoE) studies were executed on the production 
bioreactor unit operation resulting in acceptable process parameters ranges and criticality classification.  
Characterization 
A range of state-of-the-art orthogonal methodologies was used in order to elucidate the primary and higher 
order structures, as well as the purity/impurity, charged variants and glycan structures. Multiple biological 
assays were employed addressing multiple putative mechanisms of action of trastuzumab, in order to assess 
the potency and binding affinity of PF-05280014. The results demonstrate that PF-05280014 has the 
expected structure and functional properties. 
Forced degradation conditions were used to reveal potential PF-05280014 degradation pathways. The 
removal of process-related impurities was validated through testing during process validation. Product-
related impurities are included in the overall control strategy. 
Specification 
Adequate active substance specifications have been provided. The list of test parameters for the active 
substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity, purity, adventitious agents, potency and 
general tests. The set of specifications proposed covers the characteristics of the molecule including post-
translational modifications.  
Analytical methods 
A summary of each analytical procedure has been provided. Standard methods for biophysical and 
biochemical testing are used. The potency assay reflects one of the major mechanism of action (MoA). 
Compendial methods are performed in accordance with current pharmacopoeia. The validation and suitability 
of the analytical procedures was performed according to ICH Q2 (R1): Validation of Analytical Procedures: 
Text and Methodology. Both, compendial and in-house methods have been described in detail. Compendial 
analytical procedures were verified and confirmed suitable for its intended use. The validation of non-
compendial methods has been conducted using pre-approved validation protocols in accordance with the 
principles of ICH Q2 (R1).

Batch analysis 
Release results from several PF-05280014 active substance batches have been presented which demonstrate 
that manufacturing generates a consistent active substance, and all results were within the acceptance 
criteria.  
Reference material  
A two-tiered system for in-house PF-05280014 reference material has been implemented to support the 
commercial product. The existing primary reference material (PRM) and working reference material (WRM) 
have been suitably manufactured and characterised for their purpose. The acceptance criteria for the 
qualification of the future working reference material will be based on product specification at the time of 
manufacture. Characterization tests will also be performed on the future working reference material.  
Container Closure 
The active substance is filled in containers designed for freeze/thaw. Leachable studies were completed for 
the PF-05280014 active substance in the commercial container closure systems. The containers are designed 
and qualified to appropriately protect the active substance from the environment throughout storage. 
Biocompatibility tests have been performed by the vendor to demonstrate that all components used for 
manufacture are biocompatible and meet or exceed the current ISO 10993 requirements on “Biological 
Evaluation of Medical Devices”.  
Stability 
A suitable shelf life is proposed for active substance stored at the intended storage conditions. This shelf life 
claim is based on an ICH compliant stability programme, including long term and accelerated conditions and 
photostability. Based on the data presented, the proposed active substance shelf life is supported. The 
proposed stability protocol containing adequate stability-indicating test parameters is considered appropriate.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
PF-05280014 (Trazimera) is supplied as a lyophilized finished product in a dosage strength of 150 mg. The 
excipients present are L-histidine, L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, polysorbate 20 and sucrose. The 
finished product is supplied in a 15 mL glass vial sealed with a stopper and an aluminium seal with flip-off 
plastic cap.  
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018 
Page 15/73 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Prior to use, the lyophilized finished product is reconstituted with sterile water for injections (SWFI) to form a 
solution that is further diluted with sterile 0.9% sodium chloride for administration by intravenous infusion. 
Lyophilized finished product reconstituted with SWFI contains no preservative and is for single use only.  
Pharmaceutical development  
The composition of the final formulation is different from the reference product. The predominant difference 
between the two formulations is the substitution of trehalose with sucrose, both of which are disaccharides. 
When lyophilized PF-05280014 finished product was stored at elevated temperatures, the finished product 
was observed to be more stable in the sucrose formulation than in the trehalose formulation.  
The active substance is formulated in L-histidine, L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sucrose, 
polysorbate 20, and water for injections (WfI). Container closure integrity testing has been performed using a 
dye ingress test method and microbial ingress test method. All sealed vials remain free of dye ingress or 
microbial growth. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of the finished product is a standard aseptic process for lyophilised product. 
Initially the active substance is thawed using controlled thaw equipment. Thawed active substance is 
transferred to a manufacturing vessel to continue finished product manufacture. The bulk finished product is 
then sterile filtered and aseptically filled into vials. Vials are partially stoppered prior to lyophilisation. Upon 
completion of the lyophilisation cycle, the vials are fully stoppered and capped with a crimp seal. Following 
this capping operation, the vials are visually inspected. The different steps have been sufficiently described. 
Critical process parameters (CPPs) are highlighted, and hold times have been defined. The reason for 
potential re-processing has been defined and accepted. Process controls with their control limits for the 
finished product manufacturing process have been provided and are acceptable.  
The manufacturing process has been validated. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is 
capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. Process controls with 
their control limits for the finished product manufacturing process have been provided and are acceptable. 
All excipients present in the PF-05280014 active substance and finished product (L-histidine, L-histidine 
hydrochloride monohydrate, sucrose, polysorbate 20) are well-established pharmaceutical excipients. 
Specifications and analytical procedures have been provided. No excipients of human or animal origin, as well 
as no novel excipients are used in the manufacture of the product. 
Product specification 
The list of test parameters for the finished product specification contains tests  for appearance, residual 
moisture, reconstitution time, pH, osmolality, content uniformity, protein concentration, sub-visible particles, 
charge heterogeneity, identity, impurities, potency, endotoxins and, sterility. The acceptance criteria are 
applicable from lot release to end of shelf-life. The specification for the finished product release has been set 
in accordance with Ph. Eur. Requirements and ICH Q6B.  
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018 
Page 16/73 
  
  
 
 
Analytical methods 
Sufficiently detailed summary of the analytical procedures used to test the finished product have been 
provided. Validation summaries for analytical procedures used to test both the active substance and finished 
product have been provided. Analytical procedures were validated in accordance with the ICH Q2(R1) 
Guideline, Validation of Analytical Procedures: Text and Methodology.  
Compendial methods were appropriately verified for their intended use. All lots met the acceptance criteria in 
place at the time of release.  
Reference standard 
The reference standard used for analysis of finished product is the same as that used for active substance. 
Container closure 
The PF-05280014 finished product, 150 mg is packaged in a 15 mL Type I clear glass vial with a butyl rubber 
stopper laminated with a fluoro-resin film. The glass vial and the stopper, which are in product contact, meet 
the requirements of the Ph. Eur. 3.2.1 and Ph. Eur. 3.2.9 respectively. 
Stability of the product 
The stability program followed the relevant ICH guidelines for stability of the finished product.  
The shelf life claim is based on the long term stability programs with lots of 150 mg finished product stored 
at 5 ± 3 ºC through 48 months and thermal cycling stability programs. The accumulated data demonstrated 
that the quality attributes remain in conformance with the commercial acceptance criteria for the 
corresponding analytical procedures throughout the time points tested.  
Results from an ICH photostability study demonstrate that the product is photolabile. Photostability testing 
resulting in the protoype commercial package was acceptable, therefore it should be stored in the original 
package in order to protect from light.  
Based on the stability results provided the claimed shelf life for the finished product of 48 months when 
stored at the recommended temperature of 2 - 8 ºC is supported. After reconstitution with sterile water for 
injections the reconstituted solution is physically and chemically stable for 48 hours at 2°C – 8°C. Any 
remaining reconstituted solution should be discarded. 
Unopened vials of Trazimera may also be stored at a maximum of 30 ºC for a single period up to 3 months, 
but not exceeding the original expiration date.  
From a microbiological point of view, the reconstituted solution and Trazimera infusion solution should be used 
immediately. The product is not intended to be stored after reconstitution and dilution unless this has taken 
place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.  
Biosimilarity 
A 3-way comparability exercise was performed comparing PF-05280014 to US-licensed Herceptin (further 
listed as trastuzumab-US), PF-05280014 to EU-approved Herceptin (further listed as trastuzumab-EU), and 
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018 
Page 17/73 
  
  
 
 
US-licensed Herceptin to EU-approved Herceptin. The primary focus is the comparison of PF-05280014 to EU-
approved Herceptin taking the other as potentially supportive into account. 
Data from a sufficient number of lots of trastuzumab-EU (150 mg presentation) and of trastuzumab-US (440 
mg presentation) were purchased and included as licensed trastuzumab product in the similarity assessment. 
These licensed product lots represent nearly the full 48-month expiry period (stored at 2 to 8ºC) of the 
licensed trastuzumab product; and at the time of analysis, the individual lots had between 3 and 44 months 
remaining prior to expiry. 
PF-05280014 active substance batches and finished product lots were included in the similarity assessment. 
A shift in total afucosylation, terminal galactosylation and G0 species for both EU and US reference product 
manufactured with expiry beyond December 2016 was been observed. The impact of this on biosimilarity 
assessment has been considered.  
The data set obtained on primary structure, molecular mass, and posttranslational modifications by 
application of orthogonal, in-depth mass spectrometric methods support that these attributes of 
PF-05280014 are highly similar to trastuzumab-EU.  
PF-05280014, trastuzumab-US, and trastuzumab-EU samples have been characterized, side-by-side, for the 
secondary structure by far-UV CD and FTIR spectroscopy, the tertiary structure by near-UV CD and intrinsic 
fluorescence emission spectroscopy, and the thermal stability of higher order structure by DSC. The data 
support the similarity between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU. The SE-HPLC, CGE (reducing and non-
reducing), and SDS-PAGE (reducing) purity profiles were similar for PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU. 
Similar levels of monomer and high molecular mass species (HMMS) (SE-HPLC) were observed as well as 
similar levels of HC + LC and fragments (CGE reducing). Lower level of intact IgG was observed for 
PF-05280014 in comparison to trastuzumab-EU and –US, which can be attributed to slightly higher levels of 
PF-05280014 fragments.  
To assess the contribution of basic species containing C-terminal lysine on the H chain to the overall charge 
profile, PF-05280014 active substance batches were assessed after treatment with carboxypeptidase B. 
In conclusion, the extensive similarity assessment of PF-05280014, trastuzumab-US, and trastuzumab-EU 
showed highly similar biological activity of both the fragment antigen-binding (Fab) and Fc-based 
functionality when pre-glycan shift batches were used for comparison. Any minor differences seen in 
structural assays had no impact on biological activity. Based on the biological activity similarity assessment, 
PF-05280014 is highly similar to trastuzumab-US and trastuzumab-EU, and trastuzumab-EU is highly similar 
to trastuzumab-US.  
The similarity assessment of PF-05280014, trastuzumab-US, and trastuzumab-EU glycan structures was 
performed using orthogonal analytical methods. The profiles and the relative quantity of major and minor 
glycan species were evaluated by HILIC with fluorescence detection. The distribution of main glycoforms is 
considered similar across PF-05280014, trastuzumab-US, and trastuzumab-EU. The criteria for similarity 
were met.  
Afucosylated and terminal galactosylated N-linked glycans are structural attributes linked to effector function 
of antibodies. The influence of varying levels of afucosylated Fc glycan content on ADCC activity and binding 
to FcγRIIIa was investigated. The levels of afucosylated and terminal galactosylated N-linked glycans were 
determined to be well within the originators range.  
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018

The MoA of trastuzumab involves both, the Fab antigen binding domain and the Fc domain with its effector 
functions. Binding to HER2 and inhibition of downstream signaling and cell proliferation was assessed by 
multiple functional and binding assays. Similar binding to HER2 target antigen on tumor cell surface was 
confirmed and similar HER2 signaling pathway was demonstrated. Comparable ADCC activity in primary NK 
cell ADCC assay was demonstrated and confirmed in an orthogonal PBMC ADCC assay. Binding to FcγRIIIa, 
both 158V and 158F, was demonstrated to be similar. Binding to FcγRIIa 131H and 131R was similar. It is 
acceptable to consider the binding to FcγRIIa as a surrogate for antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis 
(ADCP) function. No differences were found between PF-05280014, trastuzumab-US, and trastuzumab-EU 
with regard to binding to FcγRI, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIb, fragment crystallizable receptor neonatal (FcRn), and C1q 
protein. Absence of CDC activity was also demonstrated.  
The applicant noted a shift in the N-linked glycan profile, beginning in early 2015, in trastuzumab-US and 
trastuzumab-EU lots. Given the correlation of afucosylated structures, FcγRIIIa binding and ADCC activity 
pre-glycan shift and post-glycan shift lots have distinct activity profiles. Despite the shift observed for the 
originator lots the overall similarity assessment of PF-05280014, trastuzumab-US, and trastuzumab-EU 
showed similar biological activity of both the Fab and Fc-based functions. No significant differences were 
detected. In addition it is noted that pre-glycan shift and post-glycan shift trastuzumab-EU lots were used in 
clinical Study B3271002. The clinical data in patients with HER 2 positive metastatic breast cancer 
demonstrated no clinically meaningful difference between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU product. 
Forced degradation studies 
In addition to the physicochemical and biological comparison, the applicant has conducted comparative 
forced degradation studies. The treatment conditions include elevated temperature, light exposure, forced 
deamidation and oxidation. Similar degradation profiles were seen for PF-05280014, trastuzumab-US and 
trastuzumab-EU thereby confirming the similarity between these products. 
The outcome of the physicochemical and biological comparability exercise between Trazimera and Herceptin 
is summarised in the tables below.

Adventitious agents 
Compliance with the TSE Guideline (EMEA/410/01, current version) has been sufficiently demonstrated. The 
active substance is produced in a serum-free culture medium. No material of bovine origin is added during 
cell culture. The MCB which has been established is free from TSE-risk substances. 
The cells used for production of PF-05280014 have been extensively screened for viruses. These tests failed 
to demonstrate the presence of any viral contaminant in the MCB with the exception of intracytoplasmic A-
type as well as C-type retroviral particles which are well known to be present in rodent cells. This is 
acceptable since there is sufficient capacity within the manufacturing process for reduction of this type of 
viral particles. 
The purification process of PF-05280014 includes several steps for inactivation/removal of enveloped viruses 
and the removal of non-enveloped viruses. The effectiveness of these steps has been sufficiently 
demonstrated.  
In summary, the virus safety of PF-05280014 has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Development, characterisation, manufacture and control of trastuzumab active substance and finished 
product have been adequately and sufficiently described. 
The specifications established are appropriate and covers the relevant characteristics of monoclonal 
antibodies. Acceptance limits have been well justified and mostly reflect manufacturing experience. 
Appropriate studies were conducted to further support the quantitative composition of the finished product 
and the selected finished product manufacturing process. The commercial manufacture of Trazimera has 
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018 
Page 21/73 
  
  
 
 
been sufficiently described, controlled and verified to ensure a consistent production of the finished product. 
Finished product stability studies were adequately performed and the results support the claimed shelf life for 
Trazimera.  
Biosimilarity 
An extensive analytical similarity study has been conducted. The comparative testing included analysis of 
primary structure and posttranslational modifications, biological activity, N-linked glycan structure, charge 
heterogeneity, purity, protein concentration, disulfide bonds and higher order structure, as well as 
comparative forced degradation at elevated temperature storage, light exposure, forced deamidation and 
forced oxidation.  
The biosimilarity assessment is considered adequate displaying PF-05280014 a high degree of similarity to 
trastuzumab-EU and trastuzumab-US. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Biosimilarity to the reference 
product has been satisfactorily demonstrated at the quality level. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) to take due account of technical 
and scientific progress, the CHMP recommended an additional following point for further investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
PF-05280014 has been developed as a biosimilar mAb to the trastuzumab products marketed globally as 
Herceptin.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The nonclinical pharmacology of PF-05280014 was compared with trastuzumab-US and trastuzumab-EU in a 
number of in vitro functional and binding assays reflective of the MoA of trastuzumab. 
The MoA of trastuzumab involves both the Fab antigen binding domain and the Fc domain with its effector 
functions. Binding to HER2 and inhibition of downstream signaling and cell proliferation was assessed by 
multiple functional and binding assays. Similar binding to HER2 target antigen on tumour cell surface was 
confirmed and similar HER2 signaling pathway was demonstrated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018

Comparable ADCC activity in primary NK cell ADCC assay was demonstrated and confirmed in an orthogonal 
PBMC ADCC assay. Binding to FcγRIIIa, both 158V and 158F, was demonstrated to be similar. Binding to 
FcγRIIa 131H and 131R was similar. It is acceptable to consider the binding to FcγRIIa as a surrogate for 
ADCP function.  
No differences were found between o PF-05280014, trastuzumab-US, and trastuzumab-EU with regard to 
binding to FcγRI, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIb, FcRn, and C1q protein. A shift in the N-linked glycan profile, beginning in 
early 2015, was observed in trastuzumab-US and trastuzumab-EU (reference Herceptin) lots. Therefore data 
were presented as “All lots” as well as datasets excluding post-glycan shift lots. Despite the shift observed for 
the originator lots the overall similarity assessment of PF-05280014, trastuzumab-US, and trastuzumab-EU 
showed similar biological activity of both the Fab and Fc-based functions. No significant differences were 
detected. In addition it is noted that pre-glycan shift and post-glycan shift trastuzumab-EU lots were used in 
clinical Study B3271002. The clinical data in patients with HER 2 positive metastatic breast cancer 
demonstrated no clinically meaningful difference between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU product.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The toxicokinetics (TK) and antidrug antibodies (ADA) of PF-05280014, trastuzumab-US, and trastuzumab-
EU were evaluated in male CD-1 mice when administered as a single dose via bolus intravenous. The 
applicant provided a comparison of the Cmax and AUCinf values for trastuzumab-PF relative to trastuzumab-
US and trastuzumab-EU expressed as a ratio of trastuzumab-PF to trastuzumab-US (PF:US) or trastuzumab-
EU (PF:EU). Study 11GR301 was conducted to determine the toxicokinetics of three test articles, 
trastuzumab-PF (PF-05280014), trastuzumab-US, and trastuzumab-EU, when administered as a single dose 
via bolus intravenous injection to male mice. Systemic exposure of trastuzumab-PF, trastuzumab-US, and 
trastuzumab-EU increased with increasing dose from 1 to 100 mg/kg. Comparing AUCinfand Cmax no 
significant differences could be observed between PF-05280014, trastuzumab-US, and trastuzumab-EU. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicology program with PF-05280014 and trastuzumab included a comparative 1-month TK study in 
male mice, a 2-week IV toxicity study in male and female CD-1 mice. In line with guidance on biosimilars 
single dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and developmental and reproductive toxicity studies are 
not warranted. 
In the 2-week IV toxicity study, male and female CD-1 mice (10/sex/group) were administered PF-05280014 
twice weekly at 10 or 100 mg/kg/dose (for a total of 5 doses). There was no test article-related mortality, 
clinical observations, effects on body weights or food consumption, ophthalmologic findings, or clinical 
laboratory measurements. There were no test article-related changes in organ weights, or gross or 
microscopic findings. Serum concentrations of PF-05280014 confirmed systemic exposure to the test article 
and increased with increasing dose in a less than dose proportional manner. Mean serum concentrations at 
24 hours following the last dose were comparable. 
Overall the toxicology data indicate that PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU and trastuzumab-US can be 
considered comparable.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the CHMP guidance EMEAlCHMP/SWP/4447/00 entitled, "Guideline on the Environmental 
Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use" published 01 June 2006, amino acids and proteins are 
exempted because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. PF-05280014 is a 
humanized IgG 1 monoclonal antibody consisting of naturally occurring amino acids, therefore, it is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
PF-05280014 has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product to the innovator product Herceptin 
(trastuzumab). The marketing authorisation of PF-05280014 is an abridged application for a biosimilar under 
the scope of the Article 10(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC. According to Guideline on similar biological medicinal 
products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues, 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1, the applicant used a stepwise approach in order to demonstrate that 
PF-05280014 is comparable to Herceptin with respect to pharmacodynamics (PD)/pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
toxicity. Studies regarding safety pharmacology, reproduction toxicology, and carcinogenicity and on local 
tolerance are not required for non-clinical testing of biosimilars. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The overall data on PD/PK and toxicology indicate that PF-05280014 can be considered similar to the 
reference product Herceptin. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PF-05280014 PK program consists of one pivotal comparative single-dose study carried out in healthy 
subjects (Study B3271001) and 2 supportive studies in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer 
in combination with Paclitaxel (Study B3271002) and in early breast cancer patients in combination with 
Carboplatin and Taxotere (Study B3271004).

The PK analytical method to quantify the concentration of trastuzumab in human plasma and in patients with 
HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer consists of a capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
including an acid dissociation step. This step is expected to separate all possible complexes between drug and 
HER2 as well as between drug and ADAs present in serum samples (determination of total drug 
concentration). Validation results showed acceptable accuracy and precision for all three test compounds 
(PF-05280014, EU- and US-Herceptin) versus EU-Herceptin as calibrator.  
PK comparability of PF-05280014 to each of the reference products (trastuzumab-EU or trastuzumab-US) 
was shown at the dose of 6 mg/kg body weight in healthy volunteers (Study B3271001), given that the 90% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for the test-to-reference ratios of Cmax, AUCt, and AUCinf were within the pre-
specified equivalence margin of 80% to 125%. A similar result was obtained for the comparison of 
trastuzumab-EU to trastuzumab-US.  
Geometric mean levels of AUCinf for PF-05280014 (36650 µg*h/mL) and EU-Herceptin (39770 µg*h/mL) 
were as expected from the mean levels obtained for Herceptin in similar studies after 6 mg/kg IV in healthy 
subjects (e.g. Wynne et al. 2013: 38640 µg*h/mL). The test-to-reference ratio for AUCinf between 
PF-05280014 and EU-Herceptin was 92.15% [90% CI: 86.03, 98.69]. 
PK results in patients with HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer in the first-line metastatic treatment 
setting using the 4 mg/kg + 2 mg/kg qw dosing regimen (Study B3271002) comprised Ctrough values up to 
cycle 5 day 8, which is the day of administration of the 18th weekly dose of trastuzumab. Mean Ctrough 
values increased continuously from 27.6 µg/mL (pre-dose 2) to 60.3 µg/mL (pre-dose 18) in the 
PF-05280014 group, and from 28.8 to 62.3 µg/mL in the EU-Herceptin group. This is consistent with the 
expected time course (time to ss: 12 weeks) and steady state level of Ctrough for Herceptin in MBC after the 
weekly dosing regimen (Median trough minimum concentration (Cmin),ss: 63.1 µg/mL; Herceptin SmPC, 5.2, 
Table 15).  
PK results in patients with operable HER2-positive, breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting using the 
8 mg/kg + 6 mg/kg q3w dosing regimen (Study B3271004) showed comparable geometric mean Ctrough 
values of 21.7, 30.5, 32.0, 34.6 ng/mL (PF-05280014) and 25.7, 34.9, 36.4, 34.6 ng/mL (EU-Herceptin) at 
the end of cycle 1, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Serum HER2 was evaluated as an exploratory biomarker of trastuzumab effect in Studies B3271002 and 
B3271004. A high interindividual variability (IIV) of baseline HER2 serum levels between the patients was 
observed in both studies (range from 6.0 to 6700 ng/mL, coefficient of variation [CV] 160 - 330%). Mean 
baseline values were 159.8 vs. 184.4 ng/mL in Study B3271002 and 24.7 vs. 20.4 ng/mL in Study B3271004 
for PF-05280014 vs. EU-Herceptin, respectively.  
The mean percent change from baseline at Cycle 8, Day 1 in Study B3271002 was -58.9% for PF-05280014 
and (39.98) for trastuzumab-EU. The mean percent change from baseline at end of treatment (EOT) in Study 
B3271004 was -28.8% for PF-05280014 and -28.5% for trastuzumab-EU. This indicates a similar mean 
percentage change from baseline between the 2 treatments in both studies. 
Immunogenicity profiles of PF-05280014 have been investigated in all 3 clinical studies, i.e. a single-dose 
study in healthy subjects (Study B3271001) and 2 multidose studies in patients with HER2-positive breast 
cancer (Study B3271002 and Study B3271004). 
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018 
Page 26/73 
  
  
For screening of ADA independent drug-specific electrochemiluminescent (ECL) bridging immunoassays were 
used. Drug tolerance levels were different depending on the drug and the matrix (normal serum or patient 
serum).  
Low to zero immunogenicity was found in healthy male volunteers after a single IV dose of 6 mg/kg 
EU-Herceptin or PF-05280014 (1/35 vs. 0/35).  
In MBC patients receiving adjuvant treatment (Study B3271002) a high incidence of pre-existing antibodies 
(many of them neutralizing) was observed (8.6% and 4% in PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU, 
respectively), about 10% of these patients experienced IRRs. Of the 44 patients with baseline ADA, only 4 (3 
in the PF-05280014 group and 1 in the trastuzumab-EU treatment group) had prior known exposure to 
trastuzumab. All except two patients were ADA negative post treatment. For both patients (one in each 
treatment group) the positive ADA result was observed at the end of the treatment visit in the final sample 
collected for the study. Final data (up to Week 53) on immunogenicity show an overall ADA incidence of 
0.3% (1/336 and 1/338) in both arms. 
None of 225 EBC patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment (Study B3271004) was tested positive for ADAs. 
Only 1 pre-treatment sample was positive (EU-Herceptin group). In comparison, a rate of 7.1% was 
observed in the IV arm of the HannaH trial for Herceptin (Jackisch et al. Future Oncology 2014; 8.1% 
reported in Herceptin SmPC).  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In general, the Applicant´s development program to demonstrate the similarity between PF-05280014 and 
EU-Herceptin with respect to PK is considered adequate and was performed in general according to the 
guidance on biosimilars and the recommendations given in the Scientific Advices.  
The acid dissociation step in the PK assay leading to measurement of total drug is not usual and might hinder 
comparison with PK data in historical studies with Herceptin. Sensitivity of the method was 0.5 µg/mL, which 
is acceptable. Validation of the method is considered sufficient. 
PK similarity in healthy volunteers is considered as demonstrated between PF-05280014 and each of 
trastuzumab-EU and trastuzumab-US, and between trastuzumab-EU and trastuzumab-US. 
PF-05280014 and trastuzumab levels in MBC patients after the weekly dosing regimen were as expected and 
comparable to EU-Herceptin supporting PK similarity of PF-05280014 in MBC patients. A population PK 
analysis using data from Study B3271002 was submitted to show that the population PK profiles of 
PF-05280014 versus trastuzumab-EU were not different in patients with HER2-positive MBC. The level of 
steady state trough concentrations of trastuzumab in the EBC neoadjuvant setting (3 weekly regimen) was 
also highly similar between the drugs. As expected, accumulation from cycle 1 to 5 is observed, however, 
median Ctrough levels after cycle 5 of 35.6 (PF-05280014) and 39.8 µg/mL (trastuzumab-EU) were lower 
than expected in this patient population (EBC neoadjuvant, 3 weekly regimen, population predicted median 
Cmin,ss:  53.8 µg/mL;  Herceptin SmPC, 5.2, Table 15). This difference is suggested to be attributed to 
cross-study variability and to the fact that after cycle 5, steady state has not been fully reached. 
Overall, the PK findings of similarity between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU are consistent across all 3 
studies. 
Mean baseline values of serum HER2 were higher in Study B3271002 (159.8 vs. 184.4 ng/mL) than in Study 
B3271004 (24.7 vs. 20.4 ng/mL). This is considered as reflective of the higher tumour burden in metastatic 
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018 
Page 27/73 
  
  
disease in Study B3271002, which is consistent with data in the literature. The comparable mean percentage 
change from baseline between the 2 treatments in both studies supports PD similarity. However, as no 
validated pharmacodynamics biomarker has been established for Herceptin so far, the results can be only 
considered as exploratory. They are not conclusive. 
Low incidence of ADA in healthy volunteers is not unexpected, especially in view of the small number of 
subjects. Results on Day 43 and 71 were conclusive with respect to drug tolerance and support the 
conclusion that incidence of immunogenicity in healthy volunteers was low and comparable in the 3 
treatment groups. The high number of MBC patients in Study B3271002 having pre-existing ADAs could 
partially be attributed to the low false-positive rate of 1%, to pre-existing antibodies caused by innate 
response or prior exposure to trastuzumab, or other biologics sharing the same immunogenicity-inducing 
epitopes. As only 4 patients had known prior exposure of trastuzumab, the impact of the inclusion of 
trastuzumab pre-treated patients on the evaluation of immunogenicity is considered negligible.  
The discrepancy between ADA incidence expected in the EBC neoadjuvant setting (7-8%, HannaH study) and 
the very low incidence observed in Study B3271004 (1/224, 0 and 0.9%) might be partially attributed to 
assay methodology. More importantly, 98% (EU-Herceptin group) and 3.5% (PF-05280014 group) of the 
samples from Study B3271004 were inconclusive due to present drug concentrations > drug tolerance level 
(DTL) of the assay. Furthermore, in contrast to Study B3271004, in the HannaH study ADA samples were 
collected throughout the follow-up phase at 3, 6, and 12 months. Therefore, the lack of sampling time points 
in the follow-up period after end of treatment, i.e. in the absence of drug interference, might have 
contributed to an underestimation of ADAs in both groups of Study B3271004. However, at least the very low 
(0%) incidence of ADAs in the PF-05280014 group can be regarded as conclusive result. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In conclusion, from a PK and PD perspective, the data provided support the biosimilarity of PF-05280014 and 
EU-Herceptin. 
The totality of immunogenicity data in healthy volunteers and two patient populations also support 
comparability of immunogenicity between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU reference product. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Two clinical efficacy studies were conducted: Study B3271002 in patients with HER2-positive metastatic 
breast cancer (ongoing) and Study B3271004 in early breast cancer patients (completed). The cut-off date 
(24 August 2016) of the data included in this dossier was based on when all patients had either completed 
the Week 33 visit (to collect data for primary endpoint analysis) or discontinued study drug earlier than the 
Week 33 visit, and include data up to 378 days post randomization. Unless otherwise noted, the cutoff date 
(11 January 2017) of the data included in this dossier was based on when all patients had either completed 
at least 53 weeks of treatment or discontinued the study earlier. The primary efficacy analysis was based 
upon all available central radiology data as of the cutoff date of 24 August 2016, when all patients had either 
completed the Week 33 tumor assessment or discontinued study drug earlier than the Week 33 visit. All 
patients had data available for the primary analysis.

2.5.1.  Main study 
Study B3271002 
The efficacy of PF-05280014 has been evaluated in Study B3271002 (primary comparative efficacy and 
safety study) in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients. This study was a Phase III, randomized, 
double-blind, multicentre study evaluating the similarity of efficacy (as a primary endpoint), safety, PK, and 
immunogenicity of PF-05280014 versus trastuzumab-EU in combination with 
paclitaxel.

was a loading dose of 4 mg/kg. Subsequent 2 mg/kg q2w. After Week 33 the regimen could be changed at 
the discretion of the investigator to every 3 weeks at a dose of 6 mg/kg. Dose reductions for trastuzumab 
were not permitted. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare the objective response rate (ORR) in patients with metastatic HER2-
positive breast cancer who received PF-05280014 in combination with paclitaxel to those who received 
trastuzumab-EU in combination with paclitaxel. 
Secondary objectives identified in the protocol included: 
• To evaluate the safety of PF-05280014 plus paclitaxel versus trastuzumab-EU plus paclitaxel; 
• To evaluate secondary measures of tumour control; 
• To evaluate the population PK of PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU; 
• To evaluate the immunogenicity of PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR defined as the percent of patients within each treatment group 
that achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by Week 25 of the study (window ± 14 days) 
and confirmed on a follow-up assessment (Week 33 ± 14 days) in accordance with RECIST 1.1.  
Secondary efficacy evaluations included: 
• 1-year PFS rate, analyzed based on the time from date of randomization to first documentation of 
PD, or death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD;  
• Duration of response (DOR, defined as the time from date of the first documentation of objective 
tumor response [CR or PR] to the first documentation of progressive disease [PD], or to death due to 
any cause in the absence of documented PD); 
• 1-year survival rate where time to death was defined as the time from date of randomization to 
death due to any cause while the patient was on the study. 
Sample size 
The hypothesis to be tested in this study was that the risk ratio of ORR of PF-05280014 versus that of 
trastuzumab-EU by Week 25 was within a pre-specified margin of 0.80 to 1.25. A sample size of 630 patients 
(315 per treatment group) provided approximately 85% power for achieving equivalence under the specified 
margin with a 2.5% type I error rate assuming an ORR of 60% in both treatment groups. Considering a 
possible 10% attrition rate for patients reaching evaluation for ORR, a total sample size of approximately 690 
patients (345 per treatment group) were planned to be randomized to achieve the target sample size of 630.

Randomisation 
Patients were randomized (1:1) using an automated interactive web based response system (IWRS) to 
receive PF-05280014 plus paclitaxel or trastuzumab-EU plus paclitaxel. 
Randomization was stratified by: 
• Prior trastuzumab exposure (Yes/No) (protocol Amendment 2) 
• ER status (ER positive versus ER negative). 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was double-blinded. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analyses were done for the intent-to-treat (ITT) population of all randomized patients. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed using the per-protocol (PP) population excluding patients with major 
protocol violations. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving ORR (according 
RECIST 1.1, central radiology assessment). Non-responder imputation was applied in case of missing 
endpoint information. 
The estimated risk ratio in ORR between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab including the corresponding 95% CI 
was calculated. Equivalence was concluded in case the 95%-CI fell completely within the pre-defined 
biosimilar margin [0.80 to 1.25]. The margin derivation was based on a meta-analysis including 3 
randomized studies of taxanes 7, 10, 12. Using a random effect model, the overall estimated log transformed 
risk ratio of ORR of chemotherapy alone over trastuzumab plus chemotherapy was -0.54 with a 1-sided 90% 
upper confidence bound of -0.32. A 75% fraction of the upper bound was taken resulting in a numerical value 
of log risk ratio equal to -0.24. This value of -0.24 was exponentiated to be a risk ratio of 0.79 which 
corresponded to a margin of 0.79 to 1.27 for equivalence testing. However, the traditional bioequivalence 
bounds of 0.80 to 1.25 were used to be more conservative. The primary analysis was repeated with the 
stratification variables used for randomisation (i.e. prior adjuvant trastuzumab exposure and/or ER status). 
As a sensitivity analysis the primary analysis was repeated using the PP population. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included DOR, 1-year PFS rate, and 1-year survival rate. For these time-to-
event endpoints, a Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess covariates of interest. These analyses 
were primarily performed with the ITT population. As a confirmatory analysis, these analyses were repeated 
with the PP population.  
Descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage) for CR, PR, and ORR were presented by treatment group. 
The 95% CI of these response rates was calculated. The estimated risk ratio in ORR between PF-05280014 
and trastuzumab-EU was computed, and the asymptotic 95% CI of the ratio, as proposed by Miettinen and 
Nurminen (1985), was constructed. 
The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method was used to estimate the PFS rate at 1-year; the 2-sided 95% CI of the rate 
using Greenwood’s formula was reported. A 1-sided stratified log-rank test was used to compare the PFS 
curve between the 2 treatment groups.

Conduct of the study 
The final protocol (dated 28 March 2013) had 4 amendments. Amendment 1 (29 July 2013) was 
implemented in response to recommendations made by regulatory agencies during reviews performed prior 
to Health Authority, IRB or EC submissions; no patients had been screened or randomized at the time of the 
amendment. Amendment 2 (dated 10 July 2014) was implemented due to feedback from a retrospective 
review by Parexel Informatics of randomized patients to determine if they had measurable disease (following 
investigator assessment), and subsequent to feedback from regulatory agencies. Amendment 3 (27 
September 2016) was implemented to update the study design to end patient treatment after the completion 
of Week 53 visit assessments, following communication with regulatory agencies. Amendment 4 (dated 16 
March 2017) was issued to address regulatory responses to protocol Amendment 3, and delineated 2 
treatment periods (TP1 and TP 2). The amendment allowed for continued treatment beyond Week 53 
(PF-05280014 or trastuzumab-EU monotherapy every 3 weeks at a dose of 6 mg/kg), but with limited 
protocol-required assessments. In total, 276 patients were screened under protocol Amendment 1, with the 
remainder (431 patients) screened under protocol Amendment 2. All data included in this report (using the 
data cutoff date of 11 January 2017) was from patients enrolled and managed prior to implementation of 
Amendment 3. 
Approximately half (54.6%) of all patients had an important (as defined by the sponsor) protocol deviation, 
with a comparable number and category of protocol deviations reported across both treatment groups. The 
most frequently reported important deviations were those related to procedures/tests (215 [30.4%] patients) 
and informed consent (166 [23.5%] patients). 
Baseline data 
Overall, the demographic and baseline characteristics were relatively balanced between the treatment 
groups. About 67% of patients were white, 27% were Asian and 2% black. 
Slightly more patients with longer prior disease duration were randomized to the PF-05280014 arm (median 
6.7 vs 6.1 months), but this would rather be to a disadvantage. Otherwise baseline characteristics (age, 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG], histopathologic disease, IHC results, left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) status, ER status, prior trastuzumab) appear balanced between the groups. There were 
slightly more liver metastases in the trastuzumab-EU arm (47% vs 42%) and slightly more lung metastases 
in the PF-05280014 arm (53% vs 52%). 
Previous systemic therapy for breast cancer in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting reported in ≥5% of patients 
included cyclophosphamide (255 [36.1%] patients), doxorubicin (211 [29.8%] patients), fluorouracil (147 
[20.8%] patients), docetaxel and trastuzumab (72 [10.2%] patients each), tamoxifen (69 [9.8%] patients), 
and paclitaxel (55 [7.8%] patients), with comparable proportions reported in both treatment groups. The 
incidence of prior radiation was comparable across treatment groups (115 [32.7%] patients in the 
PF-05280014 group and 117 [33.0%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group). 
Numbers analysed 
Of the 707 patients randomized, 536 patients remained ongoing in the study at the data cutoff date:  171 
and 165 patients still actively treated with PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU, respectively; 97 and 103

patients, respectively, no longer received study drug but remained in the long-term follow-up (LTFU) phase 
of the study. 
A total of 32 patients completed the study at the time of the data cutoff (including all follow-up as required 
according to the protocol), 42 (5.9%) patients discontinued the study prior to the completion of LTFU and 92 
(13.0%) patients discontinued during LTFU.  
The ITT population (707 [100.0%] patients) was used for the efficacy analysis and the safety population was 
used for the analyses of adverse events (AEs) (702 [99.3%] patients) and laboratory data (699 [98.9%] 
patients). The PP population (565 [79.9%] patients) was used for sensitivity analyses of the primary and 
secondary efficacy and biomarker analyses. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The data provided in Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) (13 July 2017) were based on the cutoff 
date 24 August 2016 when all patients had either completed the Week 33 visit (to collect data for primary 
endpoint analysis) or discontinued study drug earlier than the Week 33 visit.  
Primary endpoint 
Similarity between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU was statistically demonstrated for the primary efficacy 
endpoint, ORR (defined as the percent of patients within each treatment group that achieved CR or PR by 
Week 25 [±14 days] and confirmed on a follow-up assessment).  
The analysis of ORR derived from central radiology assessments showed a risk ratio of 0.940 (PF-05280014 
over trastuzumab-EU), with a 95% CI of (0.842, 1.049), which fell entirely within the 0.80 to 1.25 
equivalence margin. 
Table 5 Analysis of Objective Response Rate Derived From Central Radiology Assessments - ITT 
Population 
In the PF-05280014 treatment group, 220 patients (62.5%) had PR or CR, 76 patients (21.6%) had Stable 
Disease, and 18 patients (5.1%) had PD. In the trastuzumab-EU treatment group, the corresponding 
numbers (%) of patients were 236 (66.5%), 74 (20.8%), and 11 (3.1%). Overall, 72 patients (10.2%) had 
an Indeterminate response (38 [10.8%] and 34 [9.6%] in the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU groups, 
respectively).

Table 6 Summary of Best Overall Response Derived from Central Radiology Assessments – ITT 
Population  
The ORR was 62.5% and 66.5% in PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU treatment groups, respectively. The 
risk difference of the ORR between the 2 treatment groups was -3.979% (95% CI: -11.005%, 3.080%) 
(PF-05280014 minus trastuzumab-EU). The 95% CI was within the equivalence margin of -13% to 13% 
recommended by Scientific Advice.   
Sensitivity analyses 
An additional analysis for equivalence of ORR adjusting for covariates (prior adjuvant trastuzumab exposure 
and/or ER status) indicated similarity between the 2 treatment groups; the risk ratio of ORR was 0.940 with 
a 95% CI of (0.839, 1.044), which also fell within the specified equivalence margins of 0.80 to 1.25. 
The ORR Derived From Central Radiology Assessments – Per Protocol Population was 71.1% and 73.7% in 
PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU treatment groups, respectively. The risk difference of the ORR between 
the 2 treatment groups was -3.315% (95% CI: -10.656%, 4.039%) (PF-05280014 minus trastuzumab-EU). 
The 95% CI is within the recommended equivalence margin of -13% to 13%. These results are consistent 
with the analysis in the ITT population. 
The ORR Derived From Investigator Assessments - ITT Population was 65.3% and 65.9% in PF-05280014 
and in trastuzumab-EU treatment groups, respectively. The risk difference of the ORR between the 2 
treatment groups was -0.570% (95% CI: -7.537%, 6.400%) (PF-05280014 minus trastuzumab-EU). The 
95% CI is within the recommended equivalence margin of -13% to 13%. 
In order to assess the homogeneity of treatment effects across relevant subgroups, a Forest Plot of Risk 
Difference of ORR Derived From Central Radiology Assessments (Risk Difference) - ITT Population by 
stratification factors, main demographic and disease characteristics was provided:

The Risk difference is different from 0 and/or the CIs are wide when only few patients are observed, as 
e.g. patients with ECOG 2, black race and patients from West Europe. 
Otherwise the Forest plots of the ITT population (and PP population, data not shown) largely demonstrate 
homogeneity of treatment effects across relevant subgroups, i.e. stratification factors and main 
demographic and disease characteristics. 
Secondary endpoints 
Analyses for the secondary endpoints include all available radiology data up to Week 53 and all available data 
up to 378 days post-randomization.  
1-Year Progression-Free Survival Rate 
Using all available data in the data snapshot up to 1-year post randomization, there were 144 (40.9%) and 
148 (41.7%) patients who had disease progression or had died in the PF-05280014 group and the 
trastuzumab-EU group, respectively. The median time to PFS was 12.16 months in the PF-05280014 group 
and 12.06 months in the trastuzumab-EU group.

disease progression or had died in the PF-05280014 group and the trastuzumab-EU group, respectively.  
The 1-year (95% CI) survival rate was 89.31% (85.48%, 92.17%) compared with 87.36% (83.27%, 
90.51%) for the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU groups, respectively. The median time to death was not 
estimable due to too few deaths.

Supportive study 
Study B3271004 
This was an international, double-blind, randomized, Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the PK, efficacy, safety, 
and immunogenicity of PF-05280014. Patients were randomized (1:1) to PF-05280014 plus Taxotere and 
carboplatin or trastuzumab-EU plus Taxotere and carboplatin. Randomization was stratified by primary tumor 
size (<5 cm, or ≥5 cm), ER status by investigator report (ER positive versus ER negative) and by 
progesterone receptor status (progesterone receptor positive versus progesterone receptor negative).

Treatments 
PF-05280014/trastuzumab-EU (IV): first administration on Day 1, Cycle 1 was a loading dose of 8 
mg/kg; subsequent infusions followed with a dose of 6 mg/kg q3w for 6 cycles 
Taxotere (IV): 75 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each Cycle 
Carboplatin (IV): AUC 6, IV on Day 1 of each Cycle. 
Patients were to undergo a definitive surgical resection of their primary tumor, as part of their standard of 
care 3 to 7 weeks after completion of the last dose at Cycle 6. 
Statistics  
The hypothesis to be tested in this study is the percentage of patients with steady state Cycle 5 Ctrough 
(Cycle 6 pre-dose) >20 µg/mL of trastuzumab-Pfizer is similar to EU-approved trastuzumab, using a lower 
limit of -12.5%. 
To test for non-inferiority of PF-05280014 to trastuzumab-EU, the null hypothesis will be tested with α=0.025 
(one-sided). A 95% confidence interval for the difference (PF-05280014 minus trastuzumab-EU) between the 
two treatment groups will be calculated. If the lower limit of the confidence interval is greater than -12.5%, 
the null hypothesis is rejected and PF-05280014 is considered non-inferior to trastuzumab-EU. 
Efficacy endpoints were analyzed using 2 populations: 
- 
The PP population was the primary analysis set. The PP population was defined as all patients who: 
1. Had HER2-positive breast cancer and randomized into the study; 
2. Received 6 cycles of PF-05280014 or trastuzumab-EU treatment; 
3. Had no temporary delays of PF-05280014 or trastuzumab-EU treatment lasting more than 1 week; 
4. Had no other significant protocol deviations. 
- 
The ITT population was defined as all patients who were randomized to study drug assignment 
designated according to initial randomization. The ITT population was used as sensitivity analyses of the 
efficacy endpoints. 
• 
The percentage of patients in each treatment group who have pathologic complete response (pCR) as 
well as ORR was determined, using the denominator as the number of patients in the analysis 
population for each treatment group, excluding patients who were never going to receive surgery. 
The difference in percentage of patients between the 2 treatment groups was estimated, along with a 
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018 
Page 46/73 
  
  
95% CI, using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, adjusting for the randomization 
strata. These analyses were performed in the PP population, with a sensitivity analysis being 
performed in the ITT population using the same methods. 
•  Randomization 
Patients were randomized (1:1) to PF-05280014 plus Taxotere and carboplatin or trastuzumab-EU plus 
Taxotere and carboplatin. Randomization was stratified by primary tumor size (<5 cm or ≥5 cm), ER status 
(ER positive versus ER negative) and by progesterone receptor status (progesterone receptor positive versus 
progesterone receptor negative), as per investigator report. 
• 
Participant flow 
There were 226 patients randomized to the double-blind treatment (Table 11); 1 patient was randomized but 
did not receive study drug. Of the 225 patients treated, 215 patients (109 patients in the PF-05280014 group 
and 106 patients in the trastuzumab-EU group) completed the study. 
All randomized patients (n=226) were included in the ITT population. Of these, 190 patients (101 patients in 
the PF-05280014 group and 89 patients in the trastuzumab-EU group) met the requirements for the PP 
population, which was used for the primary endpoint analysis. For the safety population, 225 patients (113 
patients in the PF-05280014 group and 112 patients in the trastuzumab-EU group) were included. 
Table 11 Patient Evaluation Groups 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with steady state (Cycle 5) Ctrough (Cycle 6 pre-dose) 
>20 μg/mL between PF-05280014 versus trastuzumab-EU.  
Secondary endpoints included pCR, ORR, safety, immunogenicity, and selected trough drug concentrations.

Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics were comparable across treatment groups). All patients were female and over 
18 years of age, in accordance with the protocol requirements. Over half of all patients were 45 to 64 years 
of age (54.4%) and 97.8% had the reported race of White. 
Table 12 Demographic Characteristics – ITT Population 
Further, there were 112 patients (58 patients [50.9%] in the PF-05280014 group and 54 patients [48.2%] in 
the trastuzumab-EU group) with positive ER status and 81 patients (41 patients [36.0%] in the PF-05280014 
group and 40 patients [35.7%] in the trastuzumab-EU group) with positive progesterone receptor status. 
Investigator-reported medical history (other than the primary diagnosis) was reported for 91 (79.8%) 
patients in the PF-05280014 group and 78 (69.6%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU group. The most 
commonly reported conditions were pancreatitis chronic, cholecystitis chronic, obesity, uterine leiomyoma 
and hypertension. 
Outcomes and estimation 
pCR  
Pathological response assessments in the PP population revealed that the pCR for PF-05280014 and 
trastuzumab-EU was 47.0% (95% CI: 36.9% to 57.2%) and 50.0% (95% CI: 39.0% to 61.0%), 
respectively. The estimated stratified difference between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU was -2.81%

(95% CI: -16.58% to 10.96%). Analysis of patients with pCR in the ITT population (pCR for PF-05280014 
and trastuzumab-EU was 45.4% [95% CI: 35.8% to 55.2%] and 49.1% [95% CI: 39.2% to 59.0%]). Data 
on tumor stage of patients (i.e. disease stage [I-IV], T-stage, N-stage) and also breast conservation surgery 
are presented and are comparable. The results of pathological response assessments are summarized in 
Table 13 for the PP population. In the PF-05280014 treatment group, 47 patients (46.5%; 95% CI: 36.9% to 
57.2%) had a pCR, 51 patients (50.5%) had a pPR, 2 patients (2.0%) had no pathological response, and 1 
patient (1.0%) was not assessed, as the patient completed the study but did not have surgery. In the 
trastuzumab-EU treatment group, 43 patients (48.3%; 95% CI: 39.0% to 61.0%) had a pCR, 40 patients 
(44.9%) had a pPR, 3 patients (3.4%) had no pathological response, and 3 patients (3.4%) were not 
assessed; 1 patient completed the study but did not have surgery, and 2 patients completed treatment but 
were lost-to-follow-up prior to surgery.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy similarity evaluation in the framework of the current application for marketing authorization for 
the PF-05280014 trastuzumab biosimilar of Herceptin in the indications of metastatic breast cancer, early 
breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer was conducted based on two trials. The Applicant aims to show 
similarity only for IV administration; SC administration is not applied for. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study B3271002 
The pivotal trial, B3271002 was a multicentre, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, study to compare 
the efficacy and safety of PF-05280014 plus paclitaxel versus Herceptin plus paclitaxel in patients with HER2-
positive MBC with continuation of single-agent PF-05280014 or combination treatment versus Herceptin or 
combination treatment for patients who had at least stable disease (SD) in order to evaluate continued safety 
and immunogenicity. After discontinuation of treatment, patient survival status was and further will be 
collected by telephone contact every 2 months (±14 days) until death or 1 year from patient randomization 
and at least 6 months following receipt of last study drug, whichever is longer. 
The trial itself was split in two parts, with the D80 data package containing only data from the first part as 
only 2% of patients have actually completed the study and 79% of patients are still being followed. 
Treatment in Part 1 was foreseen for 25 weeks during which PF-05280014 plus a taxane or Herceptin plus a 
taxane was administered for a minimum of 6 treatment cycles of 4 weeks each. The hypothesis to be tested 
in this study was that the risk ratio of ORR of PF-05280014 versus that of trastuzumab-EU by Week 25 (and 
subsequently confirmed by Week 33) was within a pre-specified margin of 0.80 to 1.25. Tumour assessments 
were conducted Weeks 9, 17, 25, 33, 41 and 53 and then every 12 weeks.  
Concomitant chemotherapy 
Only paclitaxel was allowed as taxane treatment which supports homogeneity of patient population. However, 
the chemotherapy regimen used in this pivotal trial was 80 mg/m2 paclitaxel and not as in the label 
paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 over 3 hours every 21 days for at least six cycles), however, dosage was aligned with 
Gasparini et al.. 
Dosing 
Dosing of the treatments was based on the dosing of the reference product as prescribed in the product’s 
SmPC. Taxanes were dosed as per Gasparini et al. 
Eligibility criteria 
The patients that were deemed eligible for enrollment had to have histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast 
cancer with at least 1 metastatic targetable lesion, and not having received prior systemic therapy in the 
metastatic disease setting. Particularly observance of maximum anthracycline doses is appreciated and 
adequate. HER2 assays had to be either approved by the FDA or be a Sponsor-provided central laboratory; 
OR HER2 local testing using both an IHC and an in-situ hybridization analytical test which ensured proper 
identification of biomarker positive patients. 
The choice for MBC as target in a biosimilarity exercise could be considered as not being the most optimal in 
terms of homogeneity or sensitivity. A setting in neoadjuvant early breast cancer evaluating the pCR might 
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018 
Page 51/73 
  
  
be more appropriate in regards to those aspects, the choice of MBC is not wrong per se as long as effort is 
made to control and minimise heterogeneity.  
Sample size & randomization 
A sample size of 630 patients (315 per treatment group) would provide approximately 85% power for 
achieving equivalence for the risk ratio of ORR of PF-05280014 versus that of trastuzumab-EU by Week 25 
with a 2.5% type I error rate (1-sided) and an equivalence margin of [0.8, 1.25] assuming an ORR of 60% in 
both treatment groups. The equivalence margin was based on a meta-analysis of the 3 randomized studies of 
taxanes vs. taxanes plus trastuzumab.  
The ITT population (707 [100.0%] patients) was used for the efficacy analysis and the safety population was 
used for the analyses of AEs (702 [99.3%] patients) and laboratory data (699 [98.9%] patients).  
The PP population (565 [79.9%] patients) was used for sensitivity analyses of the primary and secondary 
efficacy and biomarker analyses.  
Randomization was stratified according to two covariates; ER status and prior trastuzumab therapy. This is 
considered too restricted and additional factors should have been included. 
Overall, the demographic and baseline characteristics were relatively balanced between the treatment 
groups. About 67% of patients were white, 26% were Asian and 2% black, largely balanced between 
treatmentgroups. 
Slightly more patients with longer disease duration were randomized to the PF-05280014 arm (median 6.7 vs 
6.1 months), but this would rather be to a disadvantage. 
Otherwise baseline characteristics (age, ECOG, histopathologic disease, IHC results, LVEF status, ER status, 
prior trastuzumab) appear balanced between the groups. 
There were slightly more liver metastases in the trastuzumab-EU arm (47% vs 42%) and slightly more lung 
metastases in the PF-05280014 arm (53% vs 52%).  
A summary of previous systemic therapy for breast cancer in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting and also prior 
radiation therapy for the primary diagnosis was provided and is similar at baseline.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Primary endpoint 
Similarity between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU was statistically demonstrated for the primary efficacy 
endpoint as specified for this trial, ORR derived from central radiology assessments, and showed a risk ratio 
of 0.940 (PF-05280014 over trastuzumab-EU), with a 95% CI of (0.842, 1.049), which fell entirely within the 
0.80 to 1.25 equivalence margin. 
However, the primary biosimilar assessment only relates to the risk ratio. The ORR derived from central 
radiology assessments for the ITT population was 62.5% and 66.5% in PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU 
treatment groups, respectively. The risk difference of the ORR between the 2 treatment groups was -3.979% 
(95% CI: -11.005%, 3.080%) (PF-05280014 minus trastuzumab-EU). The 95% CI was within the 
recommended equivalence margin of -13% to 13%.  
The results from primary analysis are supported by the results of several sensitivity analyses. 
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018

Secondary endpoints 
Using all available data in the data snapshot up to 1-year post randomization, there were 144 (40.9%) and 
148 (41.7%) patients who had disease progression or had died in the PF-05280014 group and the 
trastuzumab-EU group, respectively. The median time to PFS was 12.16 months in the PF-05280014 group 
and 12.06 months in the trastuzumab-EU group and the KM curves overlap which confirms similarity of the 
two products. 
There were 224 (63.6%) and 238 (67.0%) patients who had confirmed response without subsequent 
progression or death in the PF-05280014 group and the trastuzumab-EU group, respectively. The median 
DOR was observed as 11.27 months for the PF-05280014 group and 10.58 months for the trastuzumab-EU 
group. The percentage of all patients who achieved confirmed response (CR or PR, with or without 
subsequent progression or death) was comparable between the 2 treatment groups and the KM curves 
overlap further supporting similarity. 
The percentage of patients who died was comparable across the 2 treatment groups. There were 42 (11.9%) 
and 43 (12.1%) patients who died in the PF-05280014 group and the trastuzumab-EU group, respectively 
(up to 378 days post-randomization) and the KM curves are largely superimposable thus further supporting 
similarity. 
In summary, all analyses done in this regard fell within the predefined primary endpoint margins, thus 
supporting that the primary analysis findings are robust. 
Supportive Study B3271004 
The supportive study, Study B3271004, was an international, double-blind, randomized, Phase 3 clinical trial 
in patients with operable HER2-positive breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting. 
The primary endpoint was a PK endpoint, i.e. the percentage of patients with steady state (Cycle 5) Ctrough 
(Cycle 6 pre-dose) >20 μg/mL between PF-05280014 versus trastuzumab-EU in patients with operable 
HER2-positive breast cancer who received therapy together with Taxotere and carboplatin in the neoadjuvant 
setting. A central bioanalytical laboratory conducted the PK sampling required for analysis of the primary 
endpoint.  
Secondary endpoints were not statistically powered to evaluate similarity in efficacy between PF-05280014 
and the reference product and included pCR, ORR, safety, immunogenicity, and selected trough drug 
concentrations. The most frequently published definition of pCR (absence of invasive neoplastic cells in the 
breast and lymph nodes following neoadjuvant therapy= tpCR) was used in this study consistent with 
previous studies in this setting and is acceptable.  
All randomized patients (n=226) were included in the ITT population. Of these, 190 patients (101 patients in 
the PF-05280014 group and 89 patients in the trastuzumab-EU group) met the requirements for the PP 
population, which was used for the primary endpoint analysis. For the safety population, 225 patients (113 
patients in the PF-05280014 group and 112 patients in the trastuzumab-EU group) were included. 
Analyses of activity of both trastuzumab products in patients regarding the secondary endpoint pCR appear 
similar in the PP and ITT population and these results support clinical comparability. Pathological response 
assessments in the PP population revealed that the pCR for PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU was 47.0% 
(95% CI: 36.9% to 57.2%) and 50.0% (95% CI: 39.0% to 61.0%), respectively. The estimated stratified 
difference between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU was -2.81% (95% CI: -16.58% to 10.96%), thus 
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018 
Page 53/73 
  
  
 
 
supporting similarity. Results obtained for secondary endpoint ORR, also compared by type of response (CR, 
PR, SD, PD), central versus investigator review and also percentage of patients with breast conservation 
surgery (PF-05280014 vs trastuzumab-EU being 13.2% vs 17.0%, respectively) also appear similar. The 
difference in terms of the secondary endpoint of ORR for PP was 5.96 (PF-05280014 minus trastuzumab-EU) 
with a 95% CI of (-4.01 to 15.94).  
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the confirmatory Study B3271002, the similarity in terms of ORR at Week 25 (and subsequently confirmed 
by Week 33) has been shown for risk ratio within the a priori defined margins of similarity (0.80 and 1.25), 
even for the risk difference falling within EMA recommended margins (-13%, 13%). 
In this pivotal trial, equivalence with regards to efficacy has also been confirmed both with regard to risk 
ratio and risk difference and when accounting for stratification factors. These results were confirmed by way 
of sensitivity analyses and secondary endpoints. PFS, TTP and OS have been fully confirmed by an analysis 
with data cut off January 2017. 
The supportive B3271004 trial was not powered to investigate similarity in efficacy and had a different design 
and endpoints. Nonetheless, on sufficiently broad level its findings were in line with those of the pivotal trial. 
Though the similarity investigation was done in metastatic breast cancer patients, the confirmed similarity in 
efficacy, as well as the non-clinical, pharmacodynamic and -kinetic similarity between PF-05280014 and 
Herceptin support extrapolation towards all other indications currently approved for the latter. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety of PF-05280014 was evaluated in 2 single-dose studies (healthy subjects, Studies B3271001 and 
B3271006) and 2 multidose studies (patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, Study B3271002, 
and patients with operable HER2-positive, early breast cancer, Study B3271004).  
Study B3271006 was initiated to estimate the relative risk of pyrexia due to the observation of a higher 
incidence of pyrexia in Study B3271001. 
In studies B3271002 and B3271004 safety was evaluated as part of the secondary objectives. Patients who 
received at least 1 dose of study drug were included in the safety evaluation. AEs were collected from the 
time the patient had taken at least 1 dose of study treatment through and including 6 months after the last 
dose of the study drug. SAEs were recorded from the time that the patient provided informed consent 
through and including 6 months after the last dose of the study drug. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 1194 patients/subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug in the 4 studies (PF-05280014 
[n=578], trastuzumab-US [n=116], and trastuzumab-EU [n=500]). Of the 1194 patients/subjects, 906 
received 2 or more infusions of the study drug (PF-05280014 [n=452] and trastuzumab-EU [n=454]). 
Study B3271002 (MBC) 
702/707 patients received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Assessment report

Page 54/73 
  
  
The mean (SD) duration of treatment for patients receiving either PF-05280014 or trastuzumab-EU treatment 
was 41.1 (16.51) weeks and 41.2 (15.83) weeks, respectively. The mean (SD) relative dose was 96.3% 
[8.08] in the PF-05280014 group and 96.2% [8.40] in the trastuzumab-EU group. The mean duration of 
paclitaxel treatment was 29.5 (12.28) weeks and 30.8 (12.59) weeks, respectively. 
There were 204 patients in the PF-05280014 group and 194 patients in the trastuzumab-EU group who had 
their treatment regimen switched to 3-weekly trastuzumab monotherapy. There were 9 (2.6%) patients in 
the PF-05280014 group and 3 (0.8%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU group who were switched to a 3-
weekly regimen prior to Cycle 9, Day 1. 
Study B3271004 (EBC) 
225/226 patients received at least 1 dose of the study drug. Of these, 215 (95.1%) completed the study. A 
total of 10 (4.4%) patients discontinued from study treatment and 11 (4.9%) patients discontinued from the 
study. 
109 patients in each group received 6 treatment cycles (PF-05280014: 96.5%; trastuzumab-EU: 97.3%) and 
a mean (SD) relative dose of 100.1% [0.73] in the PF-05280014 group and 100.2% [0.91] in the 
trastuzumab-EU group, respectively. 
Studies B3271001 and B3271006 (HV) 
In both studies all subjects received the assigned study drug. 
Demographic characteristics 
In studies B3271001 and B3271006, patients presented similar demographic characteristics in all arms. In 
both studies, the majority of subjects were Black, followed by White.  
In studies B3271002 and B3271004, baseline characteristics were similar in both treatmentgroups. Although 
patients treated with PF-05280014 in Study B3271004 were older than patients treated with trastuzumab. 
The proportion of patients aged 45-64 was 57.5% and 51.8% and patients aged ≥65 was 22.1% and 15.2% 
in the PF-05280014 group and trastuzumab-EU group, respectively. In Study B3271002, the proportion of 
Asian patients was higher in the PF-05280014 group (29.5%) than in the trastuzumab-EU arm (23.5%).  
Adverse events 
Study B3271002 (MBC) 
The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was comparable between the treatment groups 
(337 (96.6%) patients in the PF-05280014 and 339 (96.0%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU group, 
respectively) with some slight imbalances in favour of PF-05280014 regarding treatment-related Grade ≥3 
events (N=74 [21.2%] vs. N=88 [24.9%]) and in favour of trastuzumab-EU regarding serious and related 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) resulting in treatment discontinuation (N=10 [2.9%] vs. N=6 
[1.7%] and N=5 [1.4] vs. N=3 [0.8%], respectively).

The most frequently reported TEAEs (≥20% in either treatment group) were alopecia (189 [54.2%] patients 
in the PF-05280014 group and 185 [52.4%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group), anaemia (120 [34.4%] 
patients in the PF-05280014 group and 131 [37.1%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group), neutropenia (99

[28.4%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 91 [25.8%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group), and 
peripheral sensory neuropathy (93 [26.6%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 83 [23.5%] patients in 
the trastuzumab-EU group). 
A total of 120 (34.4%) patients in the PF-05280014 group and 129 (36.5%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU 
group reported a TEAE of Grade 3 or higher. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or higher TEAE was 
neutropenia in both the PF-05280014 group (35 [10.0%] patients) and in the trastuzumab-EU group (28 
[7.9%] patients). TEAEs of Grade 3 or higher were comparable across the 2 treatment groups. 
Treatment-related TEAEs were AEs considered by the investigator as related to trastuzumab or paclitaxel or 
both. A total of 315 (90.3%) patients in the PF-05280014 group and 314 (89.0%) patients in the 
trastuzumab-EU group experienced at least 1 treatment-related TEAE. The most frequently reported (>20% 
in either treatment group) treatment-related TEAEs were alopecia (185 [53.0%] patients in the PF-05280014 
group and 184 [52.1%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group), anaemia (98 [28.1%] patients in the 
PF-05280014 group and 112 [31.7%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group), neutropenia (97 [27.8%] 
patients in the PF-05280014 group and 89 [25.2%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group), and peripheral 
sensory neuropathy (91 [26.1%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 81 [22.9%] patients in the 
trastuzumab-EU group). 
Treatment-related TEAEs ≥ Grade 3 occurred less often in the PF-05280014 group (74 [21.2%] vs. 88 
[24.9%]) with anaemia and neutropenia as the leading PTS. Trastuzumab-related TEAEs were considered by 
the investigator as related to trastuzumab only. Trastuzumab-related TEAEs were observed in 104 (29.8%) 
patients in the PF-05280014 group and in 101 (28.6%) patients the trastuzumab-EU group. The most 
frequent trastuzumab-related TEAEs were ejection fraction decreased, IRR, cardiac failure, and rash; with no 
notable differences in severity, seriousness or reason for treatment discontinuation/ interruption. The rate of 
Grade ≥3 trastuzumab-related TEAEs were 2.6% and 3.1% in the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU arms, 
respectively. The most frequent Grade ≥3 trastuzumab-related TEAEs were ejection fraction decreased and 
cardiac failure with similar incidence between treatmentgroups. 
Study B3271004 (EBC) 
109 (96.5%) and 106 (94.6%) patients in Study B3271004 experienced at least 1 TEAE in the PF-05280014 
group and the trastuzumab-EU group, respectively. The greatest differences between the treatment groups 
were observed for patients with Grade 3 or 4 AEs (N=43 [38.1%] vs. N=51 [45.5%]) and patients with AEs 
leading to reduction of dose or temporary discontinuation of treatment (N=37 [32.7%] vs. N=30 [26.8%]).

Table 18 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, All Causalities – Safety Population (Study 
B3271004) 
The most frequently reported TEAEs in both treatment groups were alopecia (72 [63.7%] patients in the 
PF-05280014 group and 69 [61.6%] patients in the trastuzumab- EU group), anaemia (56 [49.6%] patients 
in the PF-05280014 group and 51 [45.5%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group), neutropenia (38 [33.6%] 
patients in the PF-05280014 group and 41 [36.6%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group), and nausea (38 
[33.6%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 34 [30.4%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group). 
A total of 44 (38.9%) patients in the PF-05280014 group and 51 (45.5%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU 
group experienced a TEAE of Grade 3 or higher. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or higher TEAE was 
neutropenia in both the PF-05280014 group (29 [25.7%] patients) and in the trastuzumab-EU group (34 
[30.4%] patients). The rate of Grade ≥3 TEAE was comparable in both arms for all the categories, except for 
alopecia that was slightly higher in the PF-05280014 arm (6.2%) compared to the trastuzumab-EU arm 
(2.7%). The overall number of patients with Grade ≥3 alopecia was low: 7 (6.2%) patients in the 
PF-05280014 group and 3 (2.7%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU group. 
The overall number of patients with pre-existing medical conditions of musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders was comparable between the treatment groups despite a slightly higher number of patients with 
osteoarthritis and osteochondrosis at enrollment. It is understood that arthralgia and myalgia are associated 
with taxane-based chemotherapy. However, as taxanes were likewise administered in the trastuzumab group 
a similar incidence should be expected. 
When looking at the data from the larger pivotal efficacy trial these differences are not as apparent between 
the treatment groups although still slightly increased in the PF-05280014 group. However, these events were 
mainly Grade 1 or 2 and did not result in permanent discontinuation of the study drug. 
Treatment-related TEAEs were AEs considered by the investigator as related to trastuzumab, docetaxel, or 
carboplatin, either individually or in combination. A total of 108 (95.6%) patients in the PF-05280014 group 
and 106 (94.6%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU group experienced at least 1 treatment-related TEAE. The 
most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs were alopecia (72 [63.7%] patients in the PF-05280014 
group and 69 [61.6%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group), anaemia (55 [48.7%] patients in the 
PF-05280014 group and 48 [42.9%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group), neutropenia (38 [33.6%] 
patients in the PF-05280014 group and 41 [36.6%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group), and nausea (37 
[32.7%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 33 [29.5%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group). 
Assessment report

A total of 41 (36.3%) patients in the PF-05280014 group and 49 (43.8%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU 
group experienced at least 1 treatment-related TEAE of Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
Grade 3 or higher with neutropenia and leukopenia as the most frequent PTs. Only few TEAEs were 
considered related to trastuzumab (4 [3.5%] in the PF-05280014 group and 3 [2.7%] in the trastuzumab-EU 
group). 
Studies B3271001 and B3271006 (HV) 
The majority of subjects in Study B3271001 experienced a TEAE: 28 (80.0%) subjects in the PF-05280014 
group, 29 (82.9%) subjects in the trastuzumab-EU group, and 29 (82.9%) subjects in the trastuzumab-US 
group. Most of the TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Five patients experienced Grade ≥3 TEAEs in studies 
B3271001 (trastuzumab-EU arm: 2) and B3271006 (PF-05280014 arm: 3 [3.7%], trastuzumab-US arm: 1 
[1.2%]). There were no AEs of Grade 4 or higher in any treatment group. The incidence of pyrexia was 
higher in the PF-05280014 group (n=10, 28.6%) than in the trastuzumab-EU group (n=3, 8.6%) and in the 
trastuzumab-US group (n=2, 5.7%). In order to investigate this higher incidence Study B3271006 was 
carried out.  
The rate of palpitations was 8.6%, 2.9%, and 0%; the rate of abdominal pain was 8.6%, 2.9%, and 2.9%; 
and the rate of dyspepsia was 5.7%, 0%, and 0%; for the PF-05280014, trastuzumab-EU and trastuzumab-
US groups, respectively. 
The rate of eye disorders was 22.9% (8 subjects), 2.9% (1 subject), and 14.3% (5 subjects) for the 
PF-05280014, trastuzumab-EU and trastuzumab-US groups, respectively. In 4 of the 8 subjects in the PF-
05280014 group and in 1 of 5 subjects in the trastuzumab-US group , the observed eye disorders were 
symptoms of IRRs occurring at Day 1. All of the observed eye disorders were Grade 1 and resolved. 
Study B3271006 was conducted to estimate the relative risk of pyrexia for PF-05280014 compared to 
trastuzumab-US. In contrast to Study B3271001 no increased rate of pyrexia was observed for PF-05280014 
(5 patients [6.2%] vs. 11 patients [13.6%] in the trastuzumab-US group). 
Adverse events of Special Interest (AESIs) 
TEAEs of IRRs 
In Study B3271002 (MBC) signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions were observed in 33 (9.5%) and 
30 (8.5%) of patients in the PF-05280014 and the trastuzumab-EU groups, respectively. Most of the IRR 
events were Grade 1-2 in severity. Only 1 patient in the PF-05280014 and 3 patients in the trastuzumab-EU 
arm experienced Grade ≥3 IRR events. 
In Study B3271004 (EBC) no patients experienced IRR events in the PF-05280014 arm compared to 2 
patients (1.8%) who did experienced IRR events in the trastuzumab-EU arm.  
A slightly higher rate of some IRR events was observed in Study B3271001 in patients treated with 
PF-05280014 (37.1%) compared to patients treated with trastuzumab-EU (28.6%), and to those treated with 
trastuzumab-US (20.0%). The rates of pyrexia were 28.6%, 8.6%, and 5.7% for the PF-05280014, 
trastuzumab-EU, and trastuzumab-US groups, respectively.  
Given the high rate of pyrexia found in Study B3271001, a double-blind (Sponsor unblinded), randomized 
(1:1), single-dose study was performed to compare pyrexia (body temperature ≥38.0°C) between 
PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-US as the primary objective (Study B3271006). The rate of IRR events in 
Assessment report

Study B3271006 were balanced between treatmentgroups. This study, did not find differences in pyrexia 
between the treatmentgroups. However, tachycardia AEs which were determined by the investigator as 
treatment related and IRRs were also slightly higher in the PF-05280014 arm (11.1%) compared to the 
trastuzumab-EU arm (7.4%).  
Hypersensitivity and Anaphylactic Reactions 
In Study B3271002 the incidence of drug hypersensitivity was comparable between the treatment groups: 3 
(0.9%) patients in the PF-05280014 group and 5 (1.4%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU group. Of these, 2 
(0.6%) patients in the PF-05280014 group and 1 (0.3%) patient in the trastuzumab-EU group had Grade 3 
drug hypersensitivity events. All were considered related to paclitaxel; an event in 1 patient in the 
trastuzumab-EU group was considered related to both paclitaxel and trastuzumab. 
There were 10 (1.4%) patients with a TEAE of (non-drug) hypersensitivity (4 [1.1%] and 6 [1.7%] patients 
in the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU groups, respectively. All were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. 
In Study B3271004 small differences were seen in Study B3271004 with higher rates of hypersensitivity 
events (3.5% vs. 1.8%) and anaphylactic reactions (0.9% vs. 0%) in the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU 
arms, respectively; but all of them were Grade 1 or Grade 2.  
No hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions were reported in studies B3271001 and B3271006. 
TEAEs of cardiac toxicity 
Studies B3271002 and B3271004 showed comparable rates cardiac disorders between the two 
treatmentgroups, including cardiac failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and ejection fraction decreased. The 
most frequently reported cardiac disorders were cardiac failure, tachycardia, and palpitations in Study 
B3271002 and sinus tachycardia and palpitations in Study B3271004. The rate of Grade ≥3 cardiac disorders 
was also comparable between treatmentgroups.  
The assessment of cardiac disorders and ejection fraction decreased revealed higher rates of palpitations 
(8.6% vs. 2.9%) and tachycardia (11.1% vs. 7.4%) in patients treated with PF-05280014 in studies 
B3271001 and B3271006, respectively. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study B3271002 (MBC) 
The overall incidence of serious adverse events was comparable between the treatment groups (70 [20.1%] 
patients in the PF-05280014 group and 73 [20.7%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group) with a slightly 
higher incidence of disease progression (32 [9.2%] vs. 27 [7.6%]). The system organ class (SOC) 
Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders occurred in 3.2% of patients in the PF-05280014 arm 
compared to 1.4% in the trastuzumab-EU arm. 
73 (10.4%) patients (34 [9.7%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 39 [11.0%] patients in the 
trastuzumab-EU group) died during the study or within 183 days (6 months) of discontinuing study drug. In 
addition, 12 (1.7%) patients (8 [2.3%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 4 [1.1%] patients in the 
trastuzumab-EU group) died more than 183 days (6 months) after discontinuing study drug. The most 
frequent reason for death was disease progression. 3 patients in the trastuzumab-EU arm died due to cardiac 
toxicity caused to study treatment toxicity. In the Week 33 CSR it is stated that one (0.3%) patient in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018 
Page 60/73 
  
  
PF-05280014 arm died from a septic shock due to study treatment toxicity. This however was assessed not 
to be attributed to PF-05280014. Thirteen additional patients (1.9%) died due to other reasons. 
With the responses to the D120 LoQ the applicant provided tables comparing demographic and baseline 
characteristics between the two treatment groups for all patients who died during the study. Overall, there 
are some slight differences (e.g. age, metastatic sites, prior radiation). In the PF-05280014 group fewer 
patients received prior radiation therapy and surgery and had more liver metastases. These factors might 
have contributed to a less favourable disease profile resulting in more disease progression. However, due to 
the small numbers no final conclusion can be drawn. It is however reassuring that the difference decreased 
with the updated safety dataset. 
Study B3271004 (EBC) 
There were 7 (6.2%) patients in the PF-05280014 group who experienced 7 SAEs and 6 (5.4%) patients in 
the trastuzumab-EU who experienced 10 SAEs (Febrile neutropenia was experienced by 1 (0.9%) patient in 
the PF-05280014 group and 2 (1.8%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU group. All other SAEs were reported by 
no more than 1 patient in each group. All SAEs were considered by the sponsor as unrelated to study 
treatment except for the Grade 5 pancytopenia experienced by 1 (0.9%) patient in the PF-05280014 group. 
This patient, a 37-year old woman with right breast infiltrative ductal carcinoma, experienced pancytopenia 
on study day 6 after only 1 infusion cycle of trastuzumab (8 mg/kg, taxotere (75 mg/m2) and carboplatin 6 
AUC on 27 Nov 2014 (study Day 1). The case of pancytopenia was attributed to both PF-05280014 and 
chemotherapy (docetaxel and carboplatin).  
Studies B3271001 and B3271006 (HV) 
One subject in Study B3271006 experienced 2 SAEs (bipolar disorder and psychotic behaviour) 7 days after 
PF-05280014 administration. The SAEs were Grade 4 in severity and were considered not related to study 
treatment. No deaths were reported in the single dose studies (B3271001 and B3271006). 
Laboratory findings 
Study B3271002 (MBC) 
No notable differences in haematology and chemistry results were observed between the treatment groups. 
One patient in the PF-05280014 arm of Study B3271004 died due to pancytopenia. 
Study B3271004 (EBC) 
Haematology results were overall comparable in both treatment groups (beside the above described Grade 5 
pancytopenia). Grade 4 chemistry abnormalities only occurred in the PF-05280014 group. Some differences 
were found for renal function and electrolytes parameters. The proportion of patients with urea > 1.3 x ULN 
was higher in the PF-05280014 arm (23.8%) compared to the trastuzumab-EU arm (15.4%), as well as the 
proportion of patients with creatinine > 1.3 x ULN (5.4% vs. 3.6%). Moreover, the proportion of patients with 
sodium levels > 1.05 x ULN (2.7 vs. 0.9) and calcium levels < 0.9 x LLN (6.3 vs. 2.7) were higher in the 
PF-05280014 arm, and Grade 4 clinical chemistry abnormalities of hypocalcemia (7 [6.3%] patients), 
hypercalcemia (1 [0.9%] patient), and hypokalemia (1[0.9%] patient) were reported in the PF-05280014 
arm compared to no Grade 4 events in the trastuzumab-EU arm. Of the 7 patients with hypocalcemia at 
Cycle 1 in the PF-05280014 group only 1 patient had a decreased calcium value compared to the screening 
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018

value. All other patients either remained at their (low) calcium level or increased. One event of each Grade 4 
hypercalcemia and Grade 4 hypokalemia was observed in the PF-05280014 group. 
Studies B3271001 and B3271006 (HV) 
There were no notable differences in laboratory parameters between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU in 
healthy volunteers. 
Immunological events 
Immunogenicity of the study drug was evaluated in 3 studies: B3271001, B3271002, and B3271004. 
Study B3271002 (MBC) 
30 and 14 patients in the PF-05280014 group and the trastuzumab-EU group, respectively, had baseline ADA 
(predose). Of the 44 patients with a positive ADA result at Baseline 41 had post-treatment ADA tested. For 
the remaining 3 patients no samples were collected. Of the 41 patients with post-treatment ADA data, 1 
patient in the PF-05280014 group had a positive post-treatment ADA test at the EOT visit. None of these 44 
patients experienced anaphylactic or allergic reactions to trastuzumab in this study. 
Of the patients who tested positive for ADA at Baseline, 66.7% (20/30) also tested positive for neutralizing 
antibodies (NAb) in the PF-05280014 group and 64.3% (9/14) also tested positive for NAb in the 
trastuzumab-EU group. Of the 26 patients who had post-treatment NAb samples collected, none were 
reported as NAb positive. 
Of the 30 patients randomized in the PF-05280014 group with a positive ADA result at Baseline, 4 patients 
experienced an AE of IRR. All of the AEs of IRR in patients with positive ADA findings at Baseline were Grade 
1 or 2 in severity with the exception of Patient 11961003 in the PF-05280014 group who had a Grade 3 IRR 
(signs and symptoms of Grade 2 chills and dyspnea) that resolved in 1.4 hours. All 6 of these patients with 
pre-dose ADA positive samples and an IRR continued to receive further treatment, with no further reported 
ADA and IRRs. 
Following initiation of study drug, all patients with the exception of 2 (each in one treatment group) tested 
negative for ADA (titer <1.00) from Cycle 1, Day 1 post-treatment through 378 days post-randomization. For 
both patients, the positive ADA result was observed at the EOT visit in the final sample collected for the 
study; no events of IRR or anaphylactic reaction were reported. 
Study B3271004 (EBC) 
Of the 225 treated patients, none tested positive for ADA during the study. 
Studies B3271001 and B3271006 (HV) 
Of the 105 subjects, only 1 subject (in the trastuzumab-EU group) tested positive for ADA with low titer at a 
single time point post dosing. This subject tested negative for NAb. There were no unexpected AEs or SAEs 
reported for the one ADA-positive patient. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study B3271002 (MBC) 
16 (4.6%) patients in the PF-05280014 group and 12 (3.4%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU group 
permanently discontinued from trastuzumab treatment due to AEs during the study. Of these patients, there 
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018 
Page 62/73 
  
  
were 8 (2.3%) patients from PF-05280014 and 4 (1.1%) patients from trastuzumab-EU who were 
permanently discontinued from both trastuzumab and paclitaxel due to AEs. The most frequent reason for 
discontinuing trastuzumab treatment was ejection fraction decreased (6 [1.7%] and 4 [1.1%] patients in the 
PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU groups, respectively). There were no apparent differences in the number 
of patients with temporary discontinuation from trastuzumab due to TEAEs and IRRs as well as reduction of 
infusion rate due to IRR. 
Study B3271004 (EBC) 
In Study B3271004, 1 patient in the PF-05280014 group and 3 patients in the trastuzumab-EU group 
discontinued the study due to AEs: 1 patient in the PF-05280014 group was discontinued from the study due 
to a Grade 5 (fatal) SAE of pancytopenia. In the trastuzumab-EU group, 1 patient discontinued due to a 
Grade 3 SAE of hypokalemia, 1 patient discontinued due to a Grade 2 non-serious AE of erythema, and 1 
patient discontinued due to Grade 3 anaemia. All AEs leading to discontinuation in the trastuzumab-EU group 
resolved. There were 4 (3.5%) patients in the PF-05280014 group and 3 (2.7%) patients in the trastuzumab-
EU group who were permanently discontinued from any treatment due to AEs during the double-blind 
treatment period of Study B3271004. 
Studies B3271001 and B3271006 (HV) 
In both studies 2 subjects each permanently stopped study treatment due to AEs (3 due to Grade 2 IRR and 
1 due to Grade 3 back pain determined as IRR). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data for PF-05280014 are derived from 4 clinical trials conducted in patients with metastatic and early 
breast cancer (multidose studies B3271002 and B3271004, respectively) as well as in healthy male subjects 
(single dose studies B3271001 and B3271006, respectively). 3 of the 4 studies have been completed. At the 
time of initial submission, 558 (78.9%) patients (279 patients each in the PF-05280014 group and the 
trastuzumab-EU group) were still ongoing in Study B3271002 at the time of data cutoff (24 August 2016). 
The applicant provided updated safety and immunogenicity data with cutoff 11 January 2017. 
Breast Cancer Patients 
Study B3271002 (MBC) 
707 patients were randomized of which a total of 702 (349 in the PF-05280014 group and 353 in the 
trastuzumab-EU group) received at least 1 dose of the study drug. The mean (SD) duration of treatment for 
patients receiving either PF-05280014 or trastuzumab-EU treatment was comparable between the 
treatmentgroups.  
337 (96.6%) patients in the PF-05280014 group and 339 (96.0%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU group 
experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event. 
The most frequently affected SOCs were skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and nervous system 
disorders. The most commonly observed AEs by preferred term were alopecia, anemia, neutropenia and 
peripheral sensory neuropathy with similar incidences among the treatment groups. TEAEs ≥ Grade 3 were 
noted for 120 (34.4%) patients in the PF-05280014 group and 129 (36.5%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU 
group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018 
Page 63/73 
  
  
Treatment-related TEAEs (ie. either trastuzumab or paclitaxel related) occurred in 315 (90.3%) and 314 
(89.0%) patients of the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU groups, respectively. The SOCs with the greatest 
difference between the treatment groups were investigations and nervous system disorders. For the latter 
the leading preferred term was peripheral sensory neuropathy of which none was related to 
PF-05280014/trastuzumab-EU. Trastuzumab-related TEAEs were observed equally in both treatment groups 
with no notable differences in severity, seriousness or reason for treatment discontinuation/interruption. 
The number of patients who experienced serious adverse events was comparable between the treatment 
groups with a slightly higher incidence of disease progression in the PF-05280014 treatment group (32 
[9.2%] vs. 27 [7.6%]). 
A similar number of deaths was reported for both treatment groups. The observed difference with more 
patients in the PF-05280014 group dying from disease under study decreased with the updated safety 
dataset. In the Week 33 CSR it is stated that one (0.3%) patient in the PF-05280014 arm died from a septic 
shock due to study treatment toxicity. This, however, was assessed not to be attributed to PF-05280014. 
No notable differences in laboratory findings were observed between the treatment groups.  
The overall rate of patients discontinuing trastuzumab treatment was comparable between the treatment 
groups. There were also no major differences in the number of patients with temporary discontinuation from 
trastuzumab due to TEAEs and IRRs as well as reduction of infusion rate due to IRR. 
TEAEs of special interest (ie. IRR, cardiac disorders, drug hypersensitivity) were reported with comparable 
incidences between the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU treatment groups. 
Study B3271004 (EBC) 
109 patients in each group received 6 treatment cycles with similar mean relative doses. 
109 (96.5%) and 106 (94.6%) patients in Study B3271004 experienced at least 1 TEAE in the PF-05280014 
group and the trastuzumab-EU group, respectively. 
The most frequently affected SOCs were blood and lymphatic system disorders and skin and subcutaneous 
tissue disorders. SOCs with a difference >5% between the treatment groups were mainly Grade 1 and 2 and 
not considered related to PF-05280014. The most commonly observed AEs by preferred term were alopecia, 
anemia, neutropenia and nausea. 
The proportion of treatment-related TEAEs and trastuzumab-related TEAEs was similar between the 
treatment groups. The SOCs with the greatest difference between the treatment groups were general 
disorders and administration site conditions with asthenia as the most frequent PT and nervous system 
disorders. More ≥ Grade 3 treatment-related TEAEs were observed in the PF-05280014 group (N=41 
[36.3%]) compared to the trastuzumab-EU group (N=49 [43.8%]) with neutropenia and leukopenia as the 
most frequent PTs. 
There was no notable difference for patients experiencing SAEs in both treatmentgroups. 1 SAE Grade 5 was 
reported. This single death occurred in a 37-year old woman with right breast infiltrative ductal carcinoma 
who experienced pancytopenia on study day 6 after only 1 infusion cycle of trastuzumab (8 mg/kg, taxotere 
(75 mg/m2) and carboplatin 6 AUC on 27 Nov 2014 (Study Day 1). The case of pancytopenia was attributed 
to both PF-05280014 and chemotherapy (docetaxel and carboplatin). 
Overall, laboratory findings were comparable between the treatment groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018 
Page 64/73 
  
  
1 patient in the PF-05280014 group (Grade 5 SAE of pancytopenia) and 3 patients in the trastuzumab-EU 
group (Grade 3 SAE of hypokalemia, Grade 2 non-serious AE of erythema, Grade 3 anemia) discontinued the 
study due to AEs. 
10.7% (N=12 patients) and 5.4% (N=6 patients) experienced TEAEs of special interest in the PF-05280014 
group and the trastuzumab-EU group, respectively. This difference is however not driven by a specific PT. No 
IRRs were observed in the PF-05280014 group. The incidence of cardiac SOCs was overall comparable 
between the treatment groups. 1 patient in the PF-05280014 group experienced an anaphylactic reaction. 
The provided narrative of this event indicated that the event of anaphylactic reaction occurred on Day 1 
during the Docetaxel infusion. The event was Grade 2, resolved the same day and did not preclude the 
subsequent Carboplatin administration. Docetaxel was never re-administered and the patient did not 
experience another anaphylactic reaction. 
The narrative gives no cause for concern. However, the assessor was not able to locate the mentioned 
patient ID number (10641001) in any of the submitted documents. 
Immunogenicity 
In Study B3271002 30 and 14 patients in the PF-05280014 group and the trastuzumab-EU group, 
respectively, had baseline ADA (predose). None of the ADA positive patients experienced anaphylactic or 
allergic reactions to trastuzumab in this study. 20 and 9 patients in the PF-05280014 group and the 
trastuzumab-EU group, respectively, tested positive for NAb, none of which were post-treatment positive. 
Of the 30 patients randomized in the PF-05280014 group with a positive ADA result at Baseline, 4 patients 
experienced an AE of IRR. All of the AEs of IRR in patients with positive ADA findings at Baseline were Grade 
1 or 2 in severity with the exception of one patient in the PF-05280014 group who had a Grade 3 IRR (signs 
and symptoms of Grade 2 chills and dyspnea) that resolved in 1.4 hours. No events of IRR or anaphylactic 
reaction were reported for the 2 patients (one in each group) who tested ADA positive at EOT visit. 
Healthy Volunteers 
In both studies the incidence of TEAEs, SAEs and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation/interruption was 
comparable between the treatment groups. No deaths were reported in both single dose studies. There were 
no notable differences in laboratory parameters between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU in healthy 
volunteers. 
In Study B3271001 28 patients (80.0%) in the PF-05280014 group and 29 (82.9%) patients each in the 
trastuzumab-EU and trastuzumab-US groups reported TEAEs. The increased rate of pyrexia in the 
PF-05280014 group (10 patients [28.6%]) compared to the trastuzumab-EU group (3 patients [8.6%]) and 
the trastuzumab-US group (2 patients [5.7%]) led to the conduct of Study B3271006. The observed 
increased incidence of pyrexia in the PF-05280014 arm in Study B3271001 was not confirmed in Study 
B3271006. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profiles of PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU appear to be comparable among all four 
clinical studies. The available safety data support biosimilarity between Trazimera and Herceptin and 
extrapolation to other indications of the reference product is acceptable.

se as this has been shown for the reference product. The benefits and risks are inferred from the similarity of 
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018 
Page 67/73 
  
  
 
the test product to the reference product in terms of the totality of evidence collected from the quality, non-
clinical and clinical data. 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Trazimera (PF-05280014) has been developed by Pfizer Europe MA EEIG, as a similar biological medicinal 
product to Herceptin for IV use which was approved in the EU in August 2000 (EMEA/H/C/000278).  
The therapeutic indications, dosage and route of administration proposed for Trazimera are identical to those 
approved for Herceptin for IV use in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, early breast cancer and 
metastatic gastric cancer. 
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
Overall, the clinical development program for PF-05280014 includes 2 completed Phase 1 clinical studies in 
healthy subjects (Studies B3271001 and B3271006), 1 completed Phase 3 trial in patients with EBC (Study 
B3271004) and 1 ongoing Phase 3 study in patients with MBC (Study B3271002) and safety data is reported 
for all four studies. 
Study B3271001 was designed to demonstrate the similarity between CT-P6 and Herceptin with respect to 
the PK profile but also in terms of comparative safety and tolerability. Study B3271006 was initiated to 
estimate the relative risk of pyrexia due to the observation of a higher incidence of pyrexia in Study 
B3271001. 
Study B3271002 was designed to characterize and detect clinically meaningful differences in the efficacy and 
safety of PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (with 
ORR as primary endpoint) and to collect other comparative efficacy, PK/PD, safety and immunogenicity data 
for both treatment groups.  
Study B3271004 was conducted based on a request from medical oncologists’ feedback to generate data with 
PF-05280014 in early breast cancer patients. 
All studies, with the exception of Study B3271002, had been completed at the time of initial submission. 
Study B3271002 was ongoing at that time. The cutoff date (24 August 2016) of the data included in the 
dossier was based on when all patients had either completed the Week 33 visit (to collect data for primary 
endpoint analysis) or discontinued study drug earlier than the Week 33 visit, and include data up to 378 days 
post randomization. 
With the responses to the D120 LoQ the applicant provided an updated safety and immunogenicity dataset 
up to 1 year (Week 53 CSR).

3.2.  Favourable effects 
Quality  
A 3-way comparability exercise was performed comparing PF-05280014 to US-licensed Herceptin, 
PF-05280014 to EU-approved Herceptin, and US-licensed Herceptin to EU-approved Herceptin. The primary 
focus was the comparison of PF-05280014 to EU-approved Herceptin taking the other as potentially 
supportive into account. The similarity assessment was performed using orthogonal analytical methods. The 
overall similarity assessment of PF-05280014, trastuzumab-US, and trastuzumab-EU showed similar 
biophysical, biochemical characteristics and biological activity. No significant differences were detected. 
Non-Clinical  
The overall data on PD/PK and toxicology indicate that Trazimera can be considered similar to the reference 
product Herceptin. 
Clinical 
Study B3271002 
The primary endpoint was met:  
•  ORR was observed in 220 (62.5%) patients in the PF-05280014 group and in 236 (66.5%) patients in 
the trastuzumab-EU group and within the ±13% interval (difference calculated by the assessor:  
-0.033 [PF-05280014 minus trastuzumab-EU] with a 95% CI of [-0.106,0.040]). 
• 
The risk ratio was 0.940 (PF-05280014 over trastuzumab-EU), with a 95% CI of (0.842, 1.049), 
which fell entirely within the 0.80 to 1.25 equivalence margin. 
Sensitivity analyses support the results of the primary analysis. 
The median PFS (12.16 months in the PF-05280014 group and 12.06 months in the trastuzumab-EU group) 
and the percentage of patients who progressed/died or were censored (144 [40.9%] and 148 [41.7%] 
patients in the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU group, respectively) were comparable between the 2 
treatment groups. 
The percentage of all patients who achieved confirmed response (CR or PR, with or without subsequent 
progression or death) and duration of response was comparable between the 2 treatment groups. 
The percentage of patients who died was comparable across the 2 treatment groups (42 [11.9%] and 43 
[12.1%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and the trastuzumab-EU group, respectively [up to 378 days 
post-randomization]). 
PF-05280014 levels in MBC patients after the weekly dosing regimen were as expected and comparable to 
EU-Herceptin supporting PK similarity of PF-05280014 in MBC patients. 
•  Mean Ctrough values increased continuously from 27.6 µg/mL (pre-dose 2) to 60.3 µg/mL (pre-dose 
18) in the PF-05280014 group, and from 28.8 to 62.3 µg/mL in the EU-Herceptin group. 
Study B3271004 
Comparable pCR results (secondary endpoint) for PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU was 47.0% (95% CI: 
36.9% to 57.2%) and 50.0% (95% CI: 39.0% to 61.0%), respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018 
Page 69/73 
  
  
Comparable ORR results (secondary endpoint) by type of response (CR, PR, SD, PD), central versus 
investigator review and also percentage of patients with breast conservation surgery (PF-05280014 vs 
trastuzumab-EU being 13.2% vs 17.0%, respectively) support robustness of clinical similarity data. 
•  ORR: 88.1% (95% CI: 80.2% to 93.7%) and 82.0% (95% CI: 72.5% to 89.4%) for PF-05280014 
and trastuzumab-EU, respectively. 
PK results showed comparable geometric mean Ctrough values of 21.7, 30.5, 32.0, 34.6 ng/mL 
(PF-05280014) and 25.7, 34.9, 36.4, 34.6 ng/mL (EU-Herceptin) at the end of cycle 1, 3, 4, and 5, 
respectively. 
Study B3271001 and Study B3271006 
Study B3271001: For PK similarity comparisons of PF-05280014 to each of the reference products 
(trastuzumab-EU or trastuzumab-US), the 90% CIs for the test-to-reference ratios of Cmax, AUCt, and 
AUCinf were within the equivalence margin of 80% to 125%. It seems as if the variability has been calculated 
from all three treatments combined. The mean values of Cmax, AUCt, and AUCinf for the trastuzumab-EU 
group were slightly higher (approximately 6% to 9%) in comparison to the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-
US groups. This could be explained by the higher dose administered to this group due to their higher body 
weight. Consequently, the mean values of Cl and Vss were both slightly lower for the trastuzumab-EU group, 
while half-life (t1/2) values were numerically higher, although no statistical analysis has been performed for 
these parameters. 
As supportive data in patients, in Study B3271004, the mean trough concentration at each study cycle in 
PF-05280014 group was comparable to the respective mean trough concentration in trastuzumab-EU group. 
PD findings do not contradict the available data for the overall comparability exercise. 
Immunogenicity was overall low and comparable between PF-05280014 and Herceptin across clinical trials. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no important uncertainties. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Study B3271002 
The safety data set (including immunogenicity) is complete with data up to 1 year (Week 53 CSR). 
Overall, the safety profile of PF-05280014 is comparable to trastuzumab-EU. There were no major differences 
between the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU group with regards to TEAEs (337 [96.6%] and 339 [96.0%] 
patients), treatment-related TEAEs (315 [90.3%] and 314 [89.0%] patients), patients discontinuing due to 
AEs (16 [4.6%] and 12 [3.4%] patients) and TEAEs of special interest. 
73 (10.4%) patients (34 [9.7%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 39 [11.0%] patients in the 
trastuzumab-EU group) died during the study or within 183 days (6 months) of discontinuing study drug. The 
most frequent reason for death was disease progression.

Study B3271004 
The safety findings were overall comparable between the treatment groups. There were no major differences 
between the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU group with regards to TEAEs (109 [96.5%] and 106 [94.6%] 
patients), treatment-related TEAEs (108 [95.6%] and 106 [94.6%] patients), patients discontinuing due to 
AEs (1 vs. 3 patients) and TEAEs of special interest. One patient died in the PF-05280014 arm due to 
pancytopenia attributed by the investigator to both PF-05280014 arm and chemotherapy. 
Study B3271001 and Study B3271006 
In both studies the incidence of TEAEs, SAEs and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation/interruption was 
comparable between the treatment groups. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

3.7.1.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Quality 
A 3-way comparability exercise was performed comparing PF-05280014 to US-licensed Herceptin, 
PF-05280014 to EU-approved Herceptin, and US-licensed Herceptin to EU-approved Herceptin. The primary 
focus was the comparison of PF-05280014 to EU-approved Herceptin taking the other as potentially 
supportive into account. The similarity assessment was performed using orthogonal analytical methods. The 
overall similarity assessment of PF-05280014, trastuzumab-US, and trastuzumab-EU showed similar 
biophysical, biochemical characteristics and biological activity. No significant differences were detected. 
Non-Clinical  
The overall data on PD/PK and toxicology indicate that PF-05280014 can be considered similar to the 
reference product Herceptin. 
Clinical 
Efficacy and safety data indicate overall similarity between PF-05280014 and Herceptin. In Study B3271002 
(MBC) the primary endpoint was met and is supported by results from sensitivity and secondary analyses.  
In Study B3271004 (EBC) comparable pCR and ORR results were observed. However, no statistical 
assumptions for pCR have been defined and the sample size is not sufficient for formal equivalence testing. 
Therefore, this study may only be viewed as supportive. In addition, the steady state trough concentration at 
cycle 5 for both treatment groups is lower than expected. 
In Study B3271001 (HV) PK data overall support similarity between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU.

The safety profile was overall comparable between the treatment groups in all studies. The safety dataset 
(including immunogenicity data) up to 1 year has been provided with the responses to the D120 LoQ.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
Trazimera is considered biosimilar to Herceptin and the overall B/R of Trazimera is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Trazimera is favourable in the following indication: 
Metastatic breast cancer 
Trazimera is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC): 
- 
as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two chemotherapy 
regimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at least an 
anthracycline and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. Hormone receptor 
positive patients must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these 
treatments. 
- 
- 
- 
in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received 
chemotherapy for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable. 
in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received 
chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. 
in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with 
hormone-receptor positive MBC, not previously treated with trastuzumab. 
Early breast cancer 
Trazimera is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer (EBC): 
- 
- 
- 
- 
following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable) (see 
section 5.1). 
following adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, in combination with 
paclitaxel or docetaxel. 
in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin. 
in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant Trazimera therapy, for locally 
advanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumours > 2 cm in diameter (see sections 4.4 and 
5.1). 
Trazimera should only be used in patients with metastatic or early breast cancer whose tumours have either 
HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay (see 
Assessment report  
EMA/414095/2018 
Page 72/73 
  
  
sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Metastatic gastric cancer 
Trazimera in combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of 
adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-oesophageal junction 
who have not received prior anti-cancer treatment for their metastatic disease. 
Trazimera should only be used in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) whose tumours have HER2 
overexpression as defined by IHC2+ and a confirmatory SISH or FISH result, or by an IHC 3+ result. 
Accurate and validated assay methods should be used (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

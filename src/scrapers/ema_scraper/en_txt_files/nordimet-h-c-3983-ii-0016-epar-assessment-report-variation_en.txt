Methotrexate is an established drug which has been used for over 50 years in the European Union (EU) 
and USA. It is currently authorised for long-term use in children and adults by oral and parenteral 
routes of administration. It is indicated in the treatment of cancers such as acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL) and various inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis and as steroid sparing adjunctive therapy in 
Crohn’s disease. Each group of indications has a different administration schedule: 
Assessment report  
EMA/56247/2021  
Page 7/46 
 
 
 
 
• 
For the treatment of cancer, various administration schedules including daily dosage may be 
used; 
• 
For the treatment of autoimmune diseases, which require immunosuppressive therapy like 
rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn’s disease and other autoimmune diseases, it is prescribed as a 
single low-dose, once a week. 
The product in this application, Nordimet, was authorised 18/08/2016 as a hybrid medicinal product as 
defined in Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC referring to the reference product Lantarel FS 25mg/ml 
from  Pfizer  Pharma  GmbH.  Nordimet  is  supplied  in  prefilled  pens  for  subcutaneous  use  containing 
volumes ranging from 0.3 to 1ml. One ml of solution contains 25 mg of methotrexate. 
Nordimet is indicated for the treatment of  
- 
- 
- 
active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients,  
polyarthritic forms of severe, active juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), when the response to 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been inadequate,  
severe  recalcitrant  disabling  psoriasis,  which  is  not  adequately  responsive  to  other  forms  of 
therapy  such  as  phototherapy,  psoralens  and  ultraviolet  A  (PUVA),  and  retinoids,  and  severe 
psoriatic arthritis in adult patients.  
The Marketing authorisation holder applies in this extension of Indication application for the indication 
“treatment of mild to moderate Crohn's disease either alone or in combination with corticosteroids in 
patients refractory or intolerant to thiopurines”. 
The reference product does not include the proposed therapeutic indication.  
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Crohn’s disease is a chronic relapsing, remitting inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, the 
cause of which remains unknown. Some patients may have a continuously clinically active disease. 
Claimed the therapeutic indication 
The MAH applied for an indication in the “Treatment of mild to moderate Crohn's disease either alone 
or in combination with corticosteroids in patients refractory or intolerant to thiopurines” 
The proposed dosing regimen were as follows: 
Dosage in adult patients with Crohn's disease:  
• 
Induction treatment: 25 mg/week administered subcutaneously.  
Response to treatment can be expected after approximately 8 to 12 weeks.  
•  Maintenance treatment: 15 mg/week administered subcutaneously.  
Dosage in children and adolescents with Crohn's disease:  
• 
Induction treatment: 15 mg/m2 BSA/week to a maximum of 25 mg administered 
subcutaneously. 
Assessment report  
EMA/56247/2021  
Page 8/46 
 
 
 
Response to treatment can be expected after approximately 8 to 12 weeks.  
•  Maintenance treatment: Children: 10 mg/ m2 BSA/week to a maximum of 15 mg administered 
subcutaneously. 
The safety and efficacy of Nordimet in children < 3 years of age have not been established (see section 
4.4). No data available. 
Epidemiology 
Crohn Disease disease affects the gastrointestinal tract discontinuously from mouth to anus, but most 
commonly the disease is located both in ileum and colon (approximately 40%), followed by a disease 
in the small bowel only (approximately 30%), in the colon only (approximately 25%), and other 
locations (approximately 5%). It occurs in all ages with a higher incidence in the younger population 
and there is no marked sex difference. The incidence of CD in European countries is estimated to be 6-
8.5/100.000. Recent epidemiological studies have found increased mortality risk in patients with 
severe CD and most individuals experience an impact of the disease on their daily life. 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
In the absence of specific markers or aetiological mechanisms, a diagnosis is usually based on 
composite clinical and pathological features and the exclusion of alternative disease states. CD has 
been classified by disease phenotype into primarily inflammatory disease, stricturing disease or 
penetrating disease modified by the presence of upper gastrointestinal or perianal disease (Montreal 
classification 2005). Over the course of the disease, phenotype commonly changes from predominantly 
inflammatory disease to stricturing and/or penetrating disease. 
Clinical presentation 
The symptoms are partly determined by the anatomical location and the severity of the disease and 
there may be no direct correlation between an individual’s symptoms and endoscopic and radiological 
findings. The major signs and symptoms are diarrhoea, abdominal pain and weight loss. Physical 
findings reflect the site and severity of the pathology. Abdominal tenderness or presence of an 
abdominal mass reflects serosal inflammation or abscess formation. Perianal manifestations are 
common (up to 20% of patients). Extraintestinal manifestations include ocular inflammation, 
arthropathies, skin lesions and a spectrum of hepatic diseases. Due to their transmural nature, 
inflammatory lesions can result in the formation of strictures, fistulae and penetration, which can lead 
to obstruction and abscesses, respectively. 
Management 
Remission can be achieved either by medical treatment or surgery. Medical therapy recommended by 
clinical guidelines includes corticosteroids, immunosuppressant drugs and biologics (anti-tumour 
necrosis factor (TNF) α agents and adhesion molecule inhibitors). Nutritional support also has a role as 
primary therapy (in children) or as adjunct to other treatment. When medical treatment is 
unsuccessful or with certain complications, surgery is indicated. More than 70% of patients with ileal 
disease will require surgery at least once during the course of their disease.

2.1.2.  About the product 
The antimetabolite, anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX) has been shown to be efficacious at a low 
dosage (25 mg or less once a week) for several chronic inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and psoriasis. These observations led to the empiric use of low-dose MTX as a treatment 
for refractory IBD [Kozarek et al (1989) in Egan et al (1996)]. MTX inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, 
resulting in impaired DNA synthesis. Additional anti- inflammatory properties may be related to 
decreased IL-1 production. Intramuscular or subcutaneous MTX (25 mg/week) is effective in inducing 
remission and reducing glucocorticoid dosage; 15 mg/week is effective in maintaining remission in 
active CD [Friedman and Blumberg (2015)].  
Optimal treatment for CD involves controlling the immune response and reducing the inflammatory 
cascade. Immune-modifier and anti- inflammatory effects of low-dose MTX that could potentially be 
therapeutic for patients with Crohn’s disease therefore include antiproliferative effects on leukocytes; 
decreased immunoglobulin production; decreased eicosanoid production, especially leukotriene B4 
[Eliakim et al (1992) in Egan et al (1996)]; decreased production of pro- inflammatory cytokines; and 
local release of adenosine at sites of inflammation. The beneficial effect of MTX therapy for IBD is likely 
mediated by a combination of these, and possibly other actions [Egan et al (1996)]. 
2.1.3.  The development program 
No new pre-clinical tests or clinical trials were conducted in support of this variation. The MAH 
submitted a new Clinical Overview with more recent literature data for methotrexate use in CD in adult 
and paediatric patients. These studies are retrospective, clinically based studies, including paediatric 
data. The MAH did not seek Scientific advice at the CHMP. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
Not applicable the application is based on literature data. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant determined the PEC value for this indication and recalculated the total PEC surface water 
based on the sum of the single PEC for each indication described in the updated SmPC. The total PEC 
surface water is below 0.01 μg/L and Phase II assessment is not considered necessary. Therefore, this 
medicinal product is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The total PEC surface water is below 0.01 μg/L and Phase II assessment is not considered necessary. 
This medicinal product is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Searches were carried out in bibliographic (EMBASE from 1995, MEDLINE/TOXLINE from 1966) 
databases. Specific search criteria were used, adjusted to the specific database terminology, scope and 
structure, covering all aspects required for this overview. Primarily English language peer-reviewed 
literature was selected initially on the basis of search results including abstracts, and subsequently on 
the basis of original publications acquired. Where necessary, reference lists of original publications 
were searched manually for complementary publications. Moreover, recent issues of authoritative 
textbooks were used as well as Professional Drug Reference sources. 
GCP 
Not applicable, the application is based on published literature. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Methotrexate 25 mg/ml solution for injection in pre-filled syringe is administered intramuscularly, 
intravenously or subcutaneously. Since the test product Methotrexate 25 mg/ml solution for injection is 
to be administered as an aqueous parenteral (subcutaneous, intravenous or intramuscular) solution 
containing the same concentration of the same active substance and the same excipients in similar 
amounts as the medicinal product currently approved no bioequivalence studies are required. 
The following characteristics of the product under consideration are compared with the characteristics 
of the products used in the literature references and with approved products: 
Administration route 
Available evidence and recommendations from the second European evidence-based consensus on the 
diagnosis and management of Crohn’s disease indicate that intramuscular or subcutaneous 
methotrexate administration in a dosage of 25 mg/day may be used in adult patients with active 
Crohn’s disease (CD) who do not respond to or who do not tolerate thiopurine or anti-tumour necrosis 
factor (TNF) treatment. 
Consensus guidelines from ECCO/ESPGHAN on the medical management of paediatric Crohn’s disease 
state that methotrexate is usually administered via SC injection. SC injection is likely as effective as IM 
injection and associated with increased adherence. The bioavailability of oral methotrexate is highly 
variable and there are no comparative studies with the parenteral route. 
The currently valid ECCO Guideline/Consensus paper published in November 2016, states that the 
prospective controlled trials that demonstrated efficacy in CD used an intramuscular or subcutaneous 
route. A significant reduction of drug levels and variability in the absorption of oral methotrexate as 
compared to subcutaneous administration has been demonstrated, which may explain why parenteral 
administration seems to be more effective. However, for practical reasons relating to the reconstitution 
of parenteral cytotoxic drugs, oral dosing is more convenient and often preferred by patients. 
Consequently, treatment should usually be started via the intramuscular or subcutaneous routes. A 
Assessment report  
EMA/56247/2021  
Page 11/46 
 
 
 
switch to oral administration may be attempted for maintenance while carefully monitoring the clinical 
response, although no trials are available to support this approach. 
The product under consideration, Methotrexate 25 mg/ml solution for injection, is administered via SC 
injection. Therefore, Methotrexate 25 mg/ml solution for injection has the same administration route 
as what is recommended in current evidence-based European consensus guidelines. 
Type of solution, concentration, dosage and qualitative composition 
The Bioequivalence (BE) guideline states the following for parenteral solutions: 
“In the case of other parenteral routes, e.g. intramuscular or subcutaneous, and when the test product 
is of the same type of solution (aqueous or oily), contains the same concentration of the same active 
substance and the same excipients in similar amounts as the medicinal product currently approved, 
bioequivalence studies are not required. Moreover, a bioequivalence study is not required for an 
aqueous parenteral solution with comparable excipients in similar amounts, if it can be demonstrated 
that the excipients have no impact on the viscosity.” 
Table 1 A summary table of the type of solution, dosage and concentration of the products used in the 
studies demonstrating the efficacy of MTX in Crohn’s disease 
As shown in the table above, a number of studies that demonstrated the efficacy of methotrexate in 
Crohn’s disease used an intramuscular or subcutaneous delivery route. In particular, the studies 
conducted by Feagan et al (1995 and 2000) used an aqueous solution administered by IM injection and 
the study by Feagan et al (2014) also used an aqueous, which was subcutaneously injected. (For the 
other studies in which methotrexate was administered parenterally, it was not possible to determine 
the type of solution used.) 
As indicated in the table above, the products used in the pivotal studies by Feagan et al (1995, 2000), 
belong to the same global marketing authorization from Pfizer. As the reference product for the 
product under consideration (Lantarel FS 25 mg) also belongs to Pfizer, the products used in the 
pivotal studies by Feagan et al (1995, 2000) belong to the same global marketing authorization as to 
which this application refers to. 
The product under consideration, Methotrexate 25 mg/ml solution for injection, is also an aqueous 
solution for injection to be administered SC. 
Concentration 
The concentration of the products used in the pivotal studies by Feagan et al (1995, 2000) was not 
included in the references. Also, for the pivotal study by Feagan et al (2014), the concentration of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/56247/2021  
Page 12/46 
 
 
 
 
products used was not included. However, the names of the products used are mentioned as 
MaynePharma, Bedford laboratories and Novopharm. 
The concentrations of these products are: 
•  Bedford Laboratories: 25 mg/ml 
•  Maynepharma: 25 mg/ml 
•  Novopharm: 25 mg/ml 
Therefore, it can be assumed that the concentration of the products used in the pivotal studies is the 
same as the concentration of the product under consideration. 
Composition 
Based on the table below, the applicant concludes that the qualitative composition of the product 
under consideration is comparable to the reference product Lantarel and also to the products used in 
the pivotal studies by Feagan et al (1995, 2000, 2014). 
Table 2 The composition of the products used in the pivotal studies by Feagan and al (1995, 2000, 
2014), as stated in the product information compared with the composition of methotrexate 25mg/ml 
solution for injection and the reference product Lantarel FS 25mg 
The quantitative composition is not known for the products used in the pivotal studies by Feagan et al 
(1995, 2000, 2014). However, the function of the excipients used is to either dissolve the 
methotrexate or to prepare an isotonic solution. Therefore, as long as the solution is isotonic and the 
methotrexate is dissolved completely, the applicant is of the opinion that any deviations in the 
quantitative composition of the excipients will not affect the efficacy and safety of the product. 
The Applicant considered that there is sufficient evidence available that support a bridge between 
clinical data from literature to a methotrexate solution for injection with a concentration between 10 
mg/ml and 50 mg/ml. As the product under consideration has a 25 mg/ml concentration, the bridge 
between clinical data available in the literature and the product under consideration is established. 
The pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous methotrexate were comparable with those of intramuscular 
methotrexate, the former mode of administration being more convenient and less painful. The drug is 
absorbed more rapidly and reaches higher serum concentrations after intramuscular or subcutaneous 
administration compared with the oral route. The bioavailability of methotrexate is 11% to 15% lower 
after oral administration than those of the intramuscular or subcutaneous administration; but on the 
other hand, no differences between intramuscular and subcutaneous dosing exist. Nevertheless, the 
mean absolute bioavailability is very similar, suggesting that the routes of low dose pulse 
methotrexate administration are interchangeable. Factors such as sex, age, body weight, creatinine 
clearance, dose, and concomitant medications may also contribute to methotrexate variability.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Methotrexate is an antimetabolite that exerts its action by competing with folic acid for the enzyme 
dihydrofolate reductase. By inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase methotrexate interferes with DNA 
synthesis by reducing purine and pyrimidine supply in rapidly dividing cells. 
Methotrexate has shown that is causes a dose-dependent suppression of T-cell activation and adhesion 
molecule expression. The suppression of intercellular adhesion molecule-l was adenosine and folate 
dependent, while methotrexate suppression of the skin-homing cutaneous lymphocyte-associated 
antigen was adenosine independent [Johnston et al (2005) in Niehues et al (2006)]. 
When administered at the high doses used for cancer chemotherapy, MTX has both anti-proliferative 
and immunomodulating activity [Jolivet et al (1983a), Otterness et al (1976) in Egan et al (1996)]. 
Researchers have sought to identify the cellular and physiologic effects of low-dose MTX therapy, 
which underlie its efficacy in chronic inflammatory diseases [Cronstein et al (1992) in Egan et al 
(1996)]. In particular, whether low-dose MTX therapy has pronounced anti-proliferative activity is 
unclear; however, if it does, the efficacy of MTX for chronic inflammation could be due to 
immunomodulation mediated by inhibition of leukocyte proliferation and function. Alternatively, MTX 
efficacy could relate to some anti-inflammatory action independent of its inhibition of DNA, RNA, and 
protein synthesis. The physiologic effects of MTX reported to date are summarized in the table below.

Primary and secondary pharmacology 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been performed. This was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In this application, no new studies were presented and the rationale is based on published clinical 
studies. The limited information on the MTX pharmacokinetics in patients with Crohn’s disease is in line 
with what has been already described in the other disease populations.  
The applicant performed an extensive search on the literature on the use of MTX for Crohn’s disease, 
administered by SC injection. The applicant also identified the products used in the literature studies 
and the concentrations used. Similar concentration and similarity in qualitative composition was 
observed between the formulations used. Although quantitative composition of the formulations used 
in the published studies is not known, their function is simply to prepare an isotonic solution and, as 
such, all formulations are expected to perform similarly. Overall, the conclusions observed in the 
published clinical studies can be extrapolated to the current formulation for Nordimet.  
Immune-modifier and anti-inflammatory effects of low-dose MTX that could have an therapeutic impact 
on  patients  with  Crohn’s  disease  include  antiproliferative  effects  on  leukocytes,  decreased 
immunoglobulin  production,  decreased  eicosanoid  production,  especially  leukotriene  B4  [Eliakim  et  al 
(1992) in Egan et al (1996)], decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines and local release of 
adenosine at sites of inflammation. The beneficial effect of MTX therapy for IBD is likely mediated by a 
combination of these, and possibly other actions. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In the published studies submitted with this application, aqueous solutions were administered by SC 
route, with same concentrations and very similar qualitative compositions to the Nordimet formulation. 
From the biopharmaceutical perspective, the CHMP concluded that the conclusions observed in those 
studies can be extrapolated to Nordimet.    
The beneficial effect of MTX therapy for Crohn Disease is likely mediated by a combination of immune-
modifier and anti-inflammatory effects.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Clinical efficacy of methotrexate in Crohn´s disease is based on literature review. 
-  RCT (Feagan et al, 1995; Feagan et al, 2000) 
-  Open label studies 
-  Retrospective studies 
-  Cochrane reviews (Mcdonald, 2014 and Patel,2014) 
-  Clinical guidelines from ECCO, AGA  
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dose response studies were submitted. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
RCT studies for methotrexate efficacy in CD were presented for induction of response/or remission and 
for maintenance therapy. 
Feagan et al (1995) 
Feagan et al (1995) conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study of weekly 
injections of methotrexate in patients who had chronically active CD despite a minimum of three 
months of prednisone therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with intramuscular 
methotrexate (25 mg once weekly) or placebo for 16 weeks. The patients also received prednisone (20 
mg once a day), which was tapered over a period of 10 weeks unless their condition worsened. The 
primary outcome measure was clinical remission at the end of the 16-week trial. Remission was 
defined by the discontinuation of prednisone and a score of <150 points on the Crohn's Disease 
Activity Index (CDAI). A total of 141 patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to methotrexate 
(94 patients) or placebo (47 patients). After 16 weeks, 37 patients (39.4%) were in clinical remission 
in the methotrexate group, as compared with 9 patients (19.1%) in the placebo group (p = 0.025; RR, 
1.95; 95% CI, 1.09 to 3.48). The patients in the methotrexate group received less prednisone overall 
than those in the placebo group (p = 0.026). The mean (±SE) score on the CDAI after 16 weeks of 
treatment was significantly lower in the methotrexate group (162±12) than in the placebo group 
(204±17, p = 0.002). The changes in quality-of-life scores and serum orosomucoid concentrations 
were similar. In the methotrexate group, 16 patients (17 %) withdrew from treatment because of 
adverse events (including asymptomatic elevation of serum aminotransferase in 7 and nausea in 6), as 
compared with 1 patient (2 %) in the placebo group. The conclusion of Feagan et al (1995) was that in 
a group of patients with chronically active CD, methotrexate was more effective than placebo in 
improving symptoms and reducing requirements for prednisone.

Design 
A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of patients with 
chronically active Crohn’s disease who had entered remission after 16 to 24 
weeks of treatment with 25 mg of methotrexate given intramuscularly once 
weekly. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either methotrexate at a 
dose of 15 mg intramuscularly once weekly or placebo for 40 weeks. No 
other treatments for Crohn’s disease were permitted. The efficacy of 
treatment was compared by analyzing the proportion of patients who 
remained in remission at week 40. Remission was defined as a score of 150 
or less on the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index.

Results and Analysis  
Primary endpoint: 
Fewer patients in the methotrexate group than in the placebo group discontinued treatment before the 
40-week study ended (17 of 40 [42%] vs. 23 of 36 [64%], P=0.06). After 40 weeks, the proportion 
of patients who remained in remission was higher in the methotrexate group than in the placebo group 
(26 of 40 [65%] vs. 14 of 36 [39%]; unadjusted P=0.04; P=0.01 after adjustment for the route of 
entry into the trial and study center; absolute reduction in the risk of relapse, 26.1 percent; 95 percent 
confidence  interval,  4.4%  to  47.8%).  Seventy-eight  percent  of  the  relapses  met  both  criteria  for 
relapse;  22  percent  met  only  the  criterion  of  the  need  for  treatment  of  active  disease.  None  of  the 
potential  prognostic  variables  evaluated  were  significantly  associated  with  relapse.  The  median 
duration of remission was estimated to be 22 weeks in the placebo group. Fewer than 50 percent of 
the patients in the methotrexate group had relapsed by the end of the study. Therefore, the median 
duration of remission in this group could not be determined, but it was longer than 40 weeks. In the 
Cox regression model, treatment with methotrexate was significantly associated with the duration of 
remission with or without adjustment for the effects of study center and route of entry into the study 
(adjusted and unadjusted P=0.04). 
Use of Prednisone for Relapses 
Patients in the methotrexate group had fewer relapses than those in the placebo group and thus were 
less  likely  to  receive  prednisone.  Eleven  patients  (28%)  in  the  methotrexate  group  received 
prednisone, as compared with 21 patients (58%) in the placebo group (P=0.01). Among the patients 
who received prednisone, the total dose of prednisone and the average duration of use were similar in 
the  two  groups:  2242  g  and  126  days  in  the  methotrexate  group  and  2071  g  and  122  days  in  the 
placebo group. 
Treatment with Methotrexate after Relapse 
Of  the  36  patients  who  relapsed  (14  in  the  methotrexate  group  and  22  in  the  placebo  group),  22 
patients (61 percent) were subsequently given 25 mg of methotrexate once weekly, usually in addition 
to prednisone. Twelve of these 22 patients (55 percent) successfully discontinued prednisone and were 
in remission at week 40. Conversely, of the 14 patients who did not receive methotrexate after relapse, 
only 2 patients (14 percent) were in remission at week 40. 
Adverse Events 
None of the patients in the methotrexate group had a severe adverse event, as compared with two in 
the placebo group (one had cervical dysplasia, and the other had a viral respiratory tract infection). 
One  patient  who  received  methotrexate  withdrew  from  the  trial  prematurely  because  of  nausea. 
Although nausea and vomiting occurred more frequently among patients in the methotrexate group, 
none  of  the  symptoms  were  severe,  and  only  one  patient  discontinued  treatment  because  of  these 
symptoms.  No  patient  had  leukopenia  that  was  severe  enough  to  require  withholding  treatment  or 
withdrawal from the study. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups.

The authors found methotrexate to be an effective and safe maintenance 
therapy for patients with Crohn’s disease. Before enrolling in this study, the 
patients had entered clinical remission and had stopped taking prednisone 
after 16 to 24 weeks of therapy with methotrexate. Over the next 10 
months significantly more patients in the methotrexate group than in the 
placebo group remained in remission. Moreover, 72 percent of the patients 
in the methotrexate group did not require prednisone treatment for 
recurrent symptoms, as compared with 42 percent of those in the placebo 
group. In addition, re-treatment with a higher dose of methotrexate (25 
mg), usually in combination with prednisone, induced remission in over half 
the patients who had relapsed. Although these data are observational and 
thus should be interpreted with caution, these findings suggest that many 
patients who relapse while receiving low-dose maintenance therapy with 
methotrexate might ultimately be able to discontinue prednisone therapy if 
the dose of methotrexate is increased. Because of the long-term 
consequences of prolonged corticosteroid therapy, maintenance therapy 
with methotrexate may be preferable 
The authors estimated that 80 percent of the patients in the placebo group 
would have a relapse. Randomization of 110 patients would give the study a 
power of 80 percent to detect a clinically important absolute difference of 25 
percent in the primary outcome between the study groups. However, the 
rate of recruitment was slower than expected, since many patients who had 
been successfully treated with open-label methotrexate were unwilling to 
participate in a placebo-controlled trial. For administrative reasons 
(primarily the impending unavailability of the study drugs because the 
authors were unable to locate a manufacturer that could continue to supply 
methotrexate and placebo according to the necessary specifications), 
enrollment was stopped after 76 patients had undergone randomization. 
This number of patients gave the study a power of 68 percent to detect an 
absolute difference of 25 percent between the treatment groups. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The Cochrane collaboration 
Mcdonald et al (2014)  
Systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methotrexate for induction of remission in 
patients with active Crohn’s disease in the presence or absence of concomitant steroid therapy. They 
selected randomised controlled trials of methotrexate compared to placebo or an active comparator for 
treatment of active refractory CD in adult patients (> 17 years). The primary outcome was failure to 
enter remission and withdraw from steroids. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, withdrawal 
due to adverse events, serious adverse events and quality of life. Seven studies (495 patients) were 
included in the review [Ardizzone et al (2003), Arora et al (1999), Feagan et al (1995), Feagan et al 
(2014), Maté-Jiménez et al (2000), Oren et al (1997), and Schröder et al (2006) in Mcdonald et al 
(2014)]. Four studies were rated as low risk of bias. Three studies were rated as high risk of bias due 
to open label or single-blind designs. The seven studies differed with respect to participants, 
intervention, and outcomes to the extent that meta-analysis was considered to be inappropriate. 
Assessment report  
EMA/56247/2021  
Page 20/46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
GRADE analyses indicated that the quality of evidence was very low to low for most outcomes due to 
sparse data and inadequate blinding.  
Conclusions: 
“Based on presented above data, there seems to be an evidence from a single large randomised trial 
by Feagan et al (1995), that intramuscular methotrexate (25 mg/week) provides a benefit for 
induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids in patients with refractory CD. Lower 
dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any significant benefit relative to placebo or active 
comparator. However, these trials were small and further studies of oral methotrexate might be 
justified. Comparative studies of methotrexate to drugs such as azathioprine or 6- mercaptopurine 
would require the randomisation of large numbers of patients. The addition of methotrexate to 
infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infliximab monotherapy, 
although it leads to statistically significant lower anti-IFX antibody levels potentially resulting in fewer 
instances of infusion reactions or secondary non-response to IFX beyond 50 weeks. These studies were 
relatively small and further research would be needed to determine the role of methotrexate when 
used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies [Mcdonald et al (2014), Feagan et al 
(1995)].” 
Methotrexate for maintenance of remission in Crohn’s disease  
Once remission in CD is induced, patients often require long-term maintenance therapy in order to 
prevent relapse and avoid chronic corticosteroid use. This generally requires the use of 
immunosuppressive agents (as steroid sparing agents). 
The Cochrane collaboration  
Patel et al (2014) performed a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methotrexate 
for maintenance of remission in patients with CD. Randomised controlled trials that compared 
methotrexate to placebo or any other active intervention for maintenance of remission in CD were 
eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients maintaining clinical 
remission as defined by the studies and expressed as a percentage of the total number of patients 
randomized (intention-to-treat analysis). Five studies (n = 333 patients) were included in the review 
[Feagan et al (2000), Feagan et al (2014), Maté-Jiménez et al (2000), Oren et al (1997), 
and Schröder et al (2006) in Patel et al (2014)]. Three studies were judged to be at low risk of 
bias. Two studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to blinding. Intramuscular methotrexate 
was superior to placebo for maintenance of remission at 40 weeks follow-up. Sixty-five per cent of 
patients in the intramuscular methotrexate group maintained remission compared to 39% of placebo 
patients (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.67; 76 patients). The number needed to treat to prevent one 
relapse was four. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of evidence supporting this 
outcome was moderate due to sparse data (40 events). There was no statistically significant difference 
in maintenance of remission at 36 weeks follow-up between oral methotrexate (12.5 mg/week) and 
placebo. Ninety per cent of patients in the oral methotrexate group-maintained remission compared to 
67% of placebo patients (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.67; 22 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that 
the overall quality of evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (17 events). A 
pooled analysis of two small studies (n = 50) showed no statistically significant difference in continued 
remission between oral methotrexate (12.5 mg to 15 mg/week) and 6-mercaptopurine (1 mg/kg/day) 
for maintenance of remission. Seventy-seven per cent of methotrexate patients-maintained remission 
compared to 57% of 6-mercaptopurine patients (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.00). A GRADE analysis 
indicated that the overall quality of evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to high risk of 
bias in one study (no blinding) and very sparse data (33 events). One small (13 patients) poor quality 
study found no difference in continued remission between methotrexate and 5-aminosalicylic acid (RR 
Assessment report  
EMA/56247/2021  
Page 21/46 
 
 
 
2.62, 95% CI 0.23 to 29.79). A pooled analysis of two studies (n = 145) including one high quality 
trial (n = 126) found no statistically significant difference in maintenance of remission at 36 to 48 
weeks between combination therapy (methotrexate and infliximab) and infliximab monotherapy. Fifty-
four percent of patients in the combination therapy group-maintained remission compared to 53% of 
monotherapy patients (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.38, P = 0.95). A GRADE analysis indicated that the 
overall quality of evidence supporting this outcome was low due to high risk of bias in one study (no 
blinding) and sparse data (78 events). Adverse events were generally mild in nature and resolved 
upon discontinuation or with folic acid supplementation. Common adverse events included nausea and 
vomiting, symptoms of a cold, abdominal pain, headache, joint pain or arthralgia, and fatigue.  
Patel et al (2014) conclude that moderate quality evidence indicates that intramuscular methotrexate 
at a dose of 15 mg/week is superior to placebo for maintenance of remission in CD. Intramuscular 
methotrexate appears to be safe. Low dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15mg/week) does not appear 
to be effective for maintenance of remission in Crohn’s disease. Combination therapy (methotrexate 
and infliximab) does not appear to be any more effective for maintenance of remission than infliximab 
monotherapy. The results for efficacy outcomes between methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine and 
methotrexate and 5-aminosalicylic acid were uncertain. Large-scale studies of methotrexate given 
orally at higher doses for maintenance of remission in CD may provide stronger evidence for the use of 
methotrexate in this manner. These findings are consistent across all the studies.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
Children 
In the clinical review article on the use of MTX in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases by 
Herfarth et al (2016) it is acknowledged that there are no placebo-controlled, randomized trials of MTX 
for the treatment of paediatric CD. However, the use of MTX in this population is increasing and the 
body of published observational studies is growing. Djuric et al (2018) provided a tabulated overview 
of 10 retrospective and 1 prospective studies that showed that MTX was effective in the maintenance 
of remission for 1 year, in 25–69% of thiopurine-resistant and thiopurineintolerant paediatric patients 
with CD (table on the next page). The only difference in the review by Djuric et al (2018) compared to 
Herfarth et al (2016) is the addition of the studies by Hosjak et al (2015) and Weiss et al (2009) in the 
overview of Djuric et al (2018) 
Djuric et al (2018) conclude that MTX demonstrates high effectiveness as a second line 
immunomodulator in children with CD after thiopurine discontinuation. Although the initial experiences 
are encouraging, future prospective studies with a larger number of patients are needed to generate a 
definite conclusion, both on MTX effectiveness as a first line immunomodulator as well as on its 
efficacy in mucosal healing. Further studies should also clarify the optimal MTX dose and the route of 
administration in the case of concomitant use of MTX with anti-TNF agents in children.

Table 6  Effectiveness of Methotrexate in pediatric Crohn’s disease (from Djuric et al (2018)) 
Haisma et al (2015) identified consecutive children and teenagers with CD who were treated with MTX 
on second instance between 2002 and 2012. Those who used MTX primarily to treat a non-IBD 
indication (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) and those on anti-TNF-alpha co-treatment were excluded from 
analysis. A total of 113 patients were eligible for inclusion, of which 42% were female. The median age 
at diagnosis was 13 years. Two thirds were initially treated with exclusive enteral nutrition, and AZA 
was the immunomodulator of choice (88%). MTX was initiated at a median age of 14 years and after a 
median disease duration of 2 years. Most common reason to start MTX was failure of TPs (n=73). Most 
patients received MTX subcutaneously (93%) at initiation, with a median dosage of 15mg/wk.  
Eighteen months after introduction over 50% of the cohort was still using MTX. At 3, 6, 12 and 24 
months, the proportions of patients with ongoing use of MTX were 94% (95% CI: 89 to 98), 83% 
(95% CI: 76 to 90), 65% (95% CI: 56 to 73) and 44% (95% CI: 35 to 54). A fifth of the cohort used 
MTX for more than 3 years.  
The proportion of children with clinical benefit at 6, 12 and 24 months was respectively 73%, 52% and 
29%. Four patients intentionally discontinued successful therapy before the end of the observation 
period. At the end of the observation period 11 patients still experienced clinical benefits on MTX 
monotherapy.  
No differences in outcome were noted in patients who failed previous thiopurine therapy (66%) 
compared with those who did not tolerate TPs (34%). However, ineffectiveness of TPs did predict 
subsequent early MTX failure.

Feagan et al (2000) conducted a double-blind, placebo controlled, multicentre study of patients with 
chronically active CD who had entered remission after 16 to 24 weeks of treatment with 25 mg of 
methotrexate given intramuscularly once weekly. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness 
of MTX in maintaining remission in patients with CD. The patients were randomly assigned to receive 
weekly intramuscular injections of either 15 mg of methotrexate or placebo for 40 weeks. No other 
treatments for CD were permitted, excepting hydrocortisone ointment for perianal condition. The 
authors compared the efficacy of treatment by analysing the proportion of patients who remained in 
remission at week 40. Remission was defined as a score of ≤ 150 on the CDAI. Forty patients received 
methotrexate, and 36 received placebo. At week 40, 26 patients (65%) were in remission in the 
methotrexate group, as compared with 14 (39%) in the placebo group (p=0.04; absolute reduction in 
the risk of relapse, 26.1%; 95% CI, 4.4% to 47.8%). Fewer patients in the methotrexate group than 
in the placebo group required prednisone for relapse (11 of 40 [28%] vs. 21 of 36 [58%], p=0.01). 
None of the patients who received methotrexate had a severe adverse event; one patient in this group 
withdrew because of nausea. The conclusion of Feagan at al (2000) was that in patients with CD who 
enter remission after treatment with methotrexate, a low dose of methotrexate could maintain 
remission.  
Another study by Oren et al (1997), also compared methotrexate to placebo. They used oral 
methotrexate at a lower dose (12.5 mg weekly) and showed no difference between patients treated 
with methotrexate or placebo. The lower dose of methotrexate, oral route of administration, and small 
patient population may have been factors contributing to the lack of benefit seen with methotrexate.  
An open label prospective study by Lemann et al (2000) evaluated the durability of MTX for 
maintenance of remission in a population of patients who had (mostly) failed or were intolerant to AZA 
and had already been treated with MTX for period of at least 6 months were followed for an additional 
18 months. Out of 49 patients, 42 had previously failed AZA (85%). Out of the 41 achieving remission, 
36 had previously failed AZA (87%). Most of the patients were administered 25 mg/wk im MTX, but 
some physicians changed the dose to oral administration, and some were even able to taper it. Despite 
some patients with oral MTX dosing and despite a heavy proportion of AZA failures, 71% of the study 
population remained in remission for 1 year and up to 52% remained in remission after 3 years. 
Among patients who initially did well on MTX after AZA failure, they were likely to remain well on that 
therapy over the next several years.  
Two studies compared methotrexate to 6-mercaptopurine. Maté-Jiménez et al (2000) was a 
randomized, controlled trial that used oral methotrexate 10 mg weekly in patients that had achieved 
remission on a higher dose (15 mg orally weekly). When compared to patients treated with 6-
mercaptopurine, there was no statistically significant difference with respect to maintenance of 
remission. Oren et al (1997) also did not show a statistically significant difference in continued 
remission between the methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine groups.  
The efficacy of oral MTX (10-20 mg po) for maintenance of remission in CD and ulcerative colitis was 
evaluated by a retrospective review by Fraser et al (2002). Although one-year remission rates 
approached 90%, the data for CD and UC were combined and the clinical definition of remission was 
vague.  
Retrospective studies 
Wang et al (2018) A Chinese cohort retrospective study investigated the use of intramuscular MTX 
treatment in Chinese CD between January 2012 and December 2017. All patients had a history of AZA

use and intolerance to the drug or not achieving disease remission. Twenty-two (81.5%) patients 
received MTX treatment for at least 12 months. and 13 (48.1%) at 24 months. In the 14 (51.9%) 
patients who failed to maintain remission, 4 (14.8%) had a clinical response, 4 (14.8%) experienced 
relapse, and the other 6 (22.2%) discontinued MTX due to adverse events.  
Huang et al (2017) performed a retrospective non-head-to-head controlled study assessing the 
efficacy and safety of MTX (20 mg/wk, subcutaneous) compared with TPs for refractory CD. Fifty-one 
consecutive patients who were refractory or intolerant to TPs and steroid-dependent were 
retrospectively analysed. The study concluded that MTX is effective in inducing and maintaining CR and 
achieving mucosal healing in patients with refractory CD, and its efficacy is comparable to that of TPs 
for naive patients.  
Kopylov et al (2016) performed a retrospective cohort analysis, aimed to describe the efficacy of 
MTX for maintenance of remission in CD and to identify the factors associated with the probability of 
steroid- free clinical remission. A total of 49.2% of included patients were refractory or intolerant to 
TPs. The administration route for maintenance of clinical remission was intramuscular in 50.9% of 
patients. The study concluded that MTX treatment induced steroid-free clinical remission in over a third 
of CD patients and maintained it for a year in almost two-thirds of the responders.  
Wahed et al (2009) evaluated clinical response of 99 CD patients retrospectively who were placed on 
MTX due to azathioprine (AZA) intolerance or nonresponse. The study suffers from a non-homogenous 
doses and method of administration of MTX for induction and maintenance. The range of induction 
dose of MTX was 2.5-25 mg/week and administration varied as either intra-muscular (IM) or per os 
(po). Improvement was based on multiple variables as available from the charts but was not 
standardised. With these caveats, clinical response occurred in 18 of 29 patients (62%) refractory to 
AZA/MP and 42 of 70 patients (60%) intolerant to AZA/MP. This suggests that MTX is effective in CD 
patients previously treated with AZA who experienced failure or nonresponse.  
Case series: 
Charpignon and Beau (2008) reported the experience of 35 patients with MTX administered 
parenterally at an induction dose of 25 mg per week for the first three months, then tapered to 15-25 
mg per week, depending on the clinical response. Thirty-five patients with steroid-dependent CD were 
included in the study after failure of AZA in 34 cases. The rate of clinical remission was 50% at three 
months, 36% at six months, and 28% at one and two years. The rate of clinical response was 90% at 
three months, 56% at one year and 51% at two years. The rates of complete steroid withdrawal at 
three, six, 12 and 24 months in responders were, respectively: 39, 68, 69 and 100%. The efficacy of 
MTX was not statistically different among patients exhibiting AZA intolerance (47%, 8/17 patients) or 
no response (59%, 10/17 patients). The authors note that a fraction of patients appear to respond 
favourably to long-term MTX therapy, although the characteristic features of these potential 
responders have not been clearly identified. 
Other supportive information  
MAH included as support literature clinical guidelines for CD from European Crohn’s and Colitis 
Organisation (ECCO) and American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) 2013. Both guidelines 
include methotrexate in the management of CD. 
Two studies looked at the efficacy of methotrexate compared to azathioprine [Ardizzone (2003) in 
Mcdonald et al (2014)], 6-mercaptopurine [Maté-Jiménez et al (2000) in Mcdonald et al (2014)], and 
5-ASA [Maté-Jiménez et al (2000) in Mcdonald et al (2014)]. These trials included small numbers of 
patients and the failure to show a difference between treatment groups may be due to a lack of 
statistical power. The statistically significant result favouring methotrexate over 5-ASA for induction of

remission reported by Maté-Jiménez et al (2000) needs to be interpreted with caution due to the small 
numbers of patients enrolled. According to Mcdonald et al (2014) none of these trials provide sufficient 
evidence to assess the efficacy of oral or intravenous methotrexate compared to other active 
medications used for the treatment of CD. To compare the relative efficacy of azathioprine and 6-
mercaptopurine to methotrexate the randomization of large numbers of patients would be required. 
Combination with Infliximab 
Feagan et al (2014) conducted a 50-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (COMMIT) to 
evaluate potential superiority of combination therapy methotrexate-infliximab (IFX) over IFX alone in 
patients with Crohn’s disease (CD). The study was conducted in 126 patients with CD who had initiated 
prednisone induction therapy (15-40 mg/day) within the preceding 6 weeks. Patients were assigned 
randomly to groups given methotrexate at an initial weekly dose of 10 mg, escalating to 25 mg week 
(n = 63), or placebo (n = 63). Both groups received IFX (5 mg/kg of body weight) at weeks 1, 3, 7, 
and 14, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Prednisone was tapered, beginning at week 1, and discontinued 
no later than week 14. The primary outcome was time to treatment failure, defined as a lack of 
prednisone-free remission (CD Activity Index, <150) at week 14 or failure to maintain remission 
through week 50. By week 50, the actuarial rate of treatment failure was 30.6% in the combination 
therapy group compared with 29.8% in the IFX monotherapy group (p = 0.63; hazard ratio, 1.16; 
95% CI, 0.62-2.17). Prespecified subgroup analyses failed to show a benefit in patients with short 
disease duration or an increased level of C-reactive protein. No clinically meaningful differences were 
observed in secondary outcomes. Nevertheless, the MTX combination group did achieve statistically 
significant lower antibody levels (4% compared with 20%, p = 0.01) and demonstrated higher median 
serum trough levels of IFX (6.35μg/mL vs 3.75 μg/mL, p = 0.08). Whether this would result in fewer 
instances of infusion reactions or secondary non-response to IFX beyond 50 weeks remains to be seen. 
Combination therapy was well tolerated. The conclusion of Feagan et al (2014) was that the 
combination of infliximab and methotrexate, although safe, was no more effective than infliximab 
alone in patients with CD receiving treatment with prednisone.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH provided literature from studies showing efficacy for methotrexate in CD. The main limitation 
for most of the provided studies including Feagan in 1995 and 2000 is on the population included in 
the studies as these trials were conducted more than 20 years ago and before the introduction of 
biologics for the treatment of CD. The proposed dose and posology is based on the presented Feagan 
studies (1995 and 2000) i.e. for induction treatment: 25 mg/week administered subcutaneously, once 
patients have adequately responded to combination therapy, the corticosteroids should be tapered and 
for maintenance treatment: 15 mg/week administered subcutaneously, as monotherapy, if the patient 
has entered remission after 16 – 24 weeks of 25 mg methotrexate per week.  
These studies included a steroid dependent population and were designed in the early 90s. 
Feagan et al 1995 study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study of weekly injections 
of methotrexate in patients who had chronically active CD despite a minimum of three months of 
prednisone therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with intramuscular methotrexate 
(25 mg once weekly) or placebo for 16 weeks. The patients also received prednisone (20 mg once a 
day), which was tapered over a period of 10 weeks unless their condition worsened. The primary 
outcome measure was clinical remission at the end of the 16-week trial. 
Assessment report  
EMA/56247/2021  
Page 26/46 
 
 
 
As a placebo-controlled trial, using a parenteral methotrexate solution the trial included an adequate 
number of patients and the trials duration can be considered acceptable as such for demonstrating 
induction of remission in CD. The dose supports the proposed posology. However, the CHMP noted that 
CD treatment, namely induction of remission has changed in recent years with use of monoclonal 
antibodies, so the population included in this study as “chronically active after prednisolone” may be 
different from the present CD population. 
Feagan et al (2000) conducted a double-blind, placebo controlled, multicentre study of patients with 
chronically active CD who had entered remission after 16 to 24 weeks of treatment with 25 mg of 
methotrexate given intramuscularly once weekly. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness 
of MTX in maintaining remission in patients with CD. This study could be considered suitable to support 
the use of MTX for maintenance of remission. 
The remaining data come only from observational studies found in peer reviewed literature. Moreover, 
the paediatric studies provided do not include any RCT being only small open label studies, case series 
or retrospective studies. The CHMP therefore considered that they were inadequate to provide reliable 
evidence of efficacy in this population. 
Further submitted literature review included more recent retrospective studies and case series that are 
intended to support MTX use in CD. These studies used parenteral MTX for induction of remission in 
the proposed dose ranges but due to the use in mild disease and various second line settings and the 
open-label design these studies do not provide sufficient evidence for MTX benefit. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The only RCT data on the use of parenteral methotrexate in Crohn’s disease patients refractory or 
intolerant to thiopurines come from a single publication from Feagan et al., 1995. This was a double-
blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study of weekly injections of methotrexate in a group of patients 
with chronically active Crohn’s disease, showing that methotrexate was more effective than placebo in 
improving symptoms and reducing requirements for prednisone. The study was conducted in patients 
who had chronically active Crohn’s disease despite a minimum of three months of prednisone therapy. 
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with intramuscular methotrexate (25 mg once weekly) 
or placebo for 16 weeks. The patients also received prednisone (20 mg once a day), which was tapered 
over a period of 10 weeks unless their condition worsened. A total of 141 patients were randomly 
assigned in a 2:1 ratio to methotrexate (94 patients) or placebo (47 patients). After 16 weeks, 37 
patients (39.4%) were in clinical remission in the methotrexate group, as compared with 9 patients 
(19.4%, P=0.025;) in the placebo group. The patients in the methotrexate group received less 
prednisone overall than those in the placebo group (P=0.026). The mean score on the Crohn’s Disease 
Activity Index after 16 weeks of treatment was significantly lower in the methotrexate group (162) 
than in the placebo group (204, P=0.002). [Feagan et al (1995)].  
The indication applied for was “treatment of mild to moderate Crohn's disease either alone or in 
combination with corticosteroids in patients refractory or intolerant to thiopurines”. 
Considering the population included in this study (patients who had chronically active CD despite a 
minimum of three months of prednisone therapy), the CHMP was of the opinion that the use of MTX in 
induction of remission in Crohn´s disease was only supported in steroid treated patients, trying to 
decrease the steroid dose. In particular, the CHMP considered that no claim could be supported for use 
of MTX as monotherapy in induction of remission in Crohn´s disease. 
The CHMP also noted that the recent revision of the recommendations of the European Crohn’s and 
Colitis Organisation (ECCO) from 2020 (Torres et al., 2020) now excludes the use of parenteral 
methotrexate for induction of remission as well as thiopurines as the positive effects (induction of

remission and only in combination with steroids) could not be definitely attributed to treatment with 
parenteral Methotrexate given as add-on therapy on top of 12.5-40 mg/day prednisone. Still, the 
guideline acknowledges “however MTX may be considered as an option in steroid-dependent patients 
with moderate to severe disease when alternative options (including surgery) cannot be used.” 
Parenteral MTX is still included in the recommendations for maintenance treatment. Furthermore, the 
ACG guideline reviewed in 2018, includes parenteral methotrexate therapy as effective to maintain 
remission in steroid-dependent moderate to severe CD.  
The CHMP also noted that based in the current evidence and available treatment options, as proposed 
in the ECCO 2020 guideline, MTX may be considered for induction of remission “as an option for 
steroid-dependent patients with moderate-to-severe disease when alternative options [including 
surgery] cannot be used.” 
The population included also seems more steroid resistant than “thiopurine intolerant or resistant”. The 
recent Feagan et al 2014 study did not confirm any benefit of the association of Infliximab with 
methotrexate besides a lower level of antibodies in the IFX+ MTX arm. In this context it should be 
noted, that the medical need in the indication of CD has changed considerably in the recent years. 
While, there were no/limited alternatives in the population with failed thiopurines treatment before the 
treatment with biologics became broadly available variable treatment options are available today. 
Thus, the place of pMTX in the treatment of CD has narrowed considering the broad spectrum of 
treatment options. 
In line with the above and at the CHMP’s request, the MAH amended the first part of the claimed 
indication to “Induction of remission in moderate steroid-dependent Crohn's disease in adult patients, 
in combination with corticosteroids”. 
[Feagan et al (2000)] was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of patients with 
chronically active Crohn’s disease. The study showed that a low dose of methotrexate maintains 
remission. The study included patients who had entered remission after 16 to 24 weeks of treatment 
with 25 mg of methotrexate given intramuscularly once weekly. Patients were randomly assigned to 
receive either methotrexate at a dose of 15 mg intramuscularly once weekly or placebo for 40 weeks. 
No other treatments for Crohn’s disease were permitted. Of the included patients, 40 received 
methotrexate, and 36 received placebo. At week 40, 26 patients (65%) were in remission in the 
methotrexate group, as compared with 14 (39%) in the placebo group (P=0.04). Fewer patients in the 
methotrexate group than in the placebo group required prednisone for relapse (28% versus 58%, 
P=0.01).  
The study Feagan, 2000 included only 76 patients that had previously responded to MTX 25mg/ week. 
Patients were given either methotrexate 15 mg/week intramuscularly (n = 40) or identical placebo (n 
= 36) for a total of 40 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of relapse at 40 
weeks; secondary outcomes included the need for prednisone and adverse drug reactions. The patients 
were assessed every 4 weeks for a total of 40 weeks. The study medication was discontinued if a 
patient required treatment for active Crohn's disease. However, of the 36 patients that relapsed in the 
study, 22 were previously given methotrexate 25 mg intramuscularly once weekly, in addition to 
prednisone for treatment of an exacerbation. As such maintenance of remission should only be 
accepted for patients who have responded to MTX in the induction of remission phase. 
In line with the data above and at the CHMP’s request, the MAH amended the second part of the 
indication on maintenance of remission to “as monotherapy, in patients who have responded to 
methotrexate”. 
Assessment report  
EMA/56247/2021  
Page 28/46 
 
 
 
Two other trials [(Oren et al (1997); Arora et al (1999) in Mcdonald et al (2014)] showed no 
statistically significant difference between low dose oral methotrexate and placebo treated patients. 
These trials may have failed to show a benefit of methotrexate in refractory CD because they used 
lower doses of the drug (12.5 to 15 mg/week compared to 25 mg/ week) and oral administration. Both 
studies included relatively small numbers of patients and the failure to show a difference between the 
treatment and control groups may have been due to insufficient statistical power. It is noted that Oren 
et al and Arora et al studies were evaluated in the Cochrane review and classified as low evidence due 
to the small numbers of patients included. The CHMP acknowledged that methotrexate oral formulation 
in lower dose was used in both studies.  
Studies from the paediatric population were also submitted by the Applicant. These data confirm that 
MTX is being used but most of the data are open-label series, retrospective, non-randomised, non-
controlled studies in variable population, with variable prior/concomitant treatments, variable doses of 
MTX and routes of administration applied. Based on such heterogeneous data, the CHMP was of the 
opinion that no conclusions can be drawn for dosage, route of administration and CD paediatric 
population. Consequently, the CHMP concluded that the use of Nordimet for treatment of CD in 
paediatric population is not recommended. The MAH agreed to amend the product information 
accordingly. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  proposed  dose  and  posology  is  based  on  the  presented  Feagan  studies  (1995  and  2000).  These 
studies included a steroid dependent population and were designed in the early 90s, most of the patients 
had not used thiopurines. 
Patients included in these main studies do not represent the proposed population to be included in the 
indication, i. e. “mild to moderate Crohn's disease either alone or in combination with corticosteroids in 
patients refractory or intolerant to thiopurines”. Patients included in Feagan et al (1995) on induction 
of remission had chronically active CD despite a minimum of three months of prednisone therapy 
accordingly the trial can only be used to support MTX treatment in steroid treated patients, trying to 
decrease the steroid dose. In particular, no claim could be supported for its use as monotherapy. It is 
also noted that based in the current evidence and available treatment options, as proposed in the 
ECCO 2020 guideline, MTX may be considered for induction of remission “as an option for steroid-
dependent patients with moderate-to-severe disease when alternative options [including surgery] 
cannot be used.”  
Furthermore, there is no mentioning of the “response status” or “tolerability status” to thiopurines” and 
the statement “refractory or intolerant to thiopurines” was deleted from the claimed indication 
accordingly. 
[Feagan et al (2000)] which included 76 patients that had previously responded to MTX 25mg/ week  
showed that low dose of methotrexate maintains remission in CD. In this study patients were randomly 
assigned to receive either methotrexate at a dose of 15 mg intramuscularly once weekly or placebo for 
40 weeks. No other treatments for Crohn’s disease were permitted. As such, the CHMP considered that 
the indication can only be accepted on maintenance of remission for patients who have responded to 
MTX in the induction of remission phase. 
Studies in paediatric patients confirmed that MTX is being used but most of the data are open-label 
series, retrospective, non-randomised, non-controlled studies in variable population, with variable 
prior/concomitant treatments, variable doses of MTX and routes of administration applied. Based on 
such heterogeneous data, no conclusions can be drawn for dosage, route of administration and CD

paediatric population. Consequently, the CHMP concluded that the use of Nordimet for treatment of CD 
in paediatric population is not recommended. 
Based on above considerations and at the CHMP’s request, the MAH agreed to amend the indication as 
follows: 
“Induction of remission in moderate steroid-dependent Crohn's disease in adult patients, in 
combination with corticosteroids and for maintenance of remission, as monotherapy, in patients who 
have responded to methotrexate.” 
This revised indication was considered acceptable considering the submitted data on efficacy. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In general, the incidence and severity of acute side effects of methotrexate are related to dose, 
frequency of administration, and the duration of the exposure to significant blood levels of 
methotrexate to the target organs. The most common dose-related toxic effects of methotrexate are 
on the bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract. Bone-marrow depression can occur abruptly, and 
leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia may all occur. The nadir of the platelet and white-blood 
cell counts is usually around 5 to 10 days after a bolus dose, with recovery between about 14 to 28 
days, but some sources suggest that leucocytes may show an early fall and rise, followed by a second 
nadir and recovery, within this period. Ulceration of the mouth and gastrointestinal disturbances are 
also early signs of toxicity: stomatitis and diarrhoea during treatment indicate that it may need to be 
interrupted, otherwise haemorrhagic enteritis, intestinal perforation, and death may follow.  
Methotrexate is associated with liver damage, both acute (notably after high doses) and, more 
seriously, chronic (generally after long-term use). Hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis may develop without 
obvious signs of hepatotoxicity and have led to eventual death. Other adverse effects include renal 
failure and tubular necrosis after high doses, pulmonary reactions including life-threatening interstitial 
lung disease, skin reactions (sometimes severe), alopecia, and ocular irritation.  
Patient exposure 
The application was based on scientific literature. 
Adverse events 
Chande et al (2011) performed a retrospective chart review of CD patients in their practice treated 
with methotrexate. Data related to the safety and tolerance of methotrexate was extracted and 
analysed. Of 92 patients treated with methotrexate, there was enough data for 79 patients for analysis 
(49 women and 30 men; mean age 28.8 years). Forty- two patients (53%) had previously received 
azathioprine. Overall, 40 patients (51%) achieved and maintained remission on methotrexate, 
including 13 of 30 (43%) who concomitantly received anti-TNF therapy. The mean total accumulated 
dose of methotrexate was 1727 mg [SD 1572 mg], with a mean total duration of methotrexate use of 
25.4 months (SD 43.1 months). The most common adverse events were nausea (22%) and elevated 
liver enzymes (10%). Only 6% of patients stopped methotrexate therapy because of persistently 
abnormal liver enzymes. No patients underwent liver biopsy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/56247/2021  
Page 30/46 
 
 
 
Feagan et al (1995) showed in their landmark randomized controlled trial that adverse events were 
observed in approximately equal frequency in the methotrexate treated (45%) and control (42%) 
groups. However, 17% of the methotrexate treated patients were withdrawn from treatment because 
of adverse events, compared to 2% in the placebo group (p = 0.012). The most common reasons for 
withdrawal were nausea and vomiting (6 patients) and asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes (7 
patients). No serious adverse effects were observed. Although the design of this study resulted in 
withdrawal of these patients, in clinical practice in patients with rheumatoid disease, adverse effects 
such as nausea are often dealt with or prevented by the concomitant administration of folic acid 
[Griffith et al (2000), Lorenzi et al (2000) in McDonald et al (2014)], and asymptomatic elevations of 
transaminases are not considered to reflect or predict existing or future hepatic disease [Kremer et al 
(1994) in McDonald et al (2014)].  
In Feagan et al (2000) study there were no severe adverse events reported in the methotrexate group. 
In the three trials that employed lower doses of oral methotrexate no serious adverse effects were 
observed [Arora et al (1999); Maté-Jiménez et al (2000); Oren et al (1997)]. However, in one trial ALT 
levels were increased in 53% of patients receiving methotrexate, compared to 22% of patients 
receiving placebo [Arora et al (1999)]. No clinically significant hepatotoxicity was observed in any 
patient.  
Schröder et al [2003] provided a literature overview of the use of low-dose methotrexate, including a 
discussion on the toxicity of low-dose methotrexate. According to Schröder et al [2003], frequency and 
severity of adverse effects during low dose MTX therapy in irritable bowel disease (IBD) are relatively 
small, requiring withdrawal of medication in approximately 10% of patients (table below). The most 
common adverse effects of low dose MTX therapy for IBD include GI symptoms (nausea and vomiting, 
diarrhoea, abdominal distension and pain), elevated serum transaminases, central nervous system 
effects, and infections. Most side effects are transient and resolve with either continuation of therapy 
or dose reduction.

Table 7 Details of adverse events occurring on more than one occasion in trials of low dose 
methotrexate in the treatment of 465 patients with IBD [Schröder et al (2003)] 
Conway et al (2015) performed a systematic literature review, and a meta-analysis of randomised 
controlled trials on patients with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis. The 
authors had the aim to evaluate the relative risk of pulmonary disease among patients with psoriasis, 
psoriatic arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease treated with methotrexate. The inclusion criteria for 
study selection were: double blind randomised controlled trials; patients with psoriasis, psoriatic 
arthritis, or inflammatory bowel disease; studies in English; studies consisting of a minimum of two 
arms, at least one receiving methotrexate and at least one not receiving methotrexate; studies 
including only adults (≥18 years); trials of 12 weeks or more duration; studies of 50 patients or more; 
and studies reporting respiratory side effects for methotrexate and comparator groups separately. 
Seven studies met the inclusion criteria, six with placebo as the comparator. Overall, 504 respiratory 
adverse events were documented in 1630 participants. Methotrexate was not associated with an 
increased risk of adverse respiratory events (relative risk 1.03, 95% confidence interval CI 0.90 to 
1.17), respiratory infections (1.02, 0.88 to 1.19), or non-infectious respiratory events (1.07, 0.58 to 
1.96). No pulmonary deaths occurred.  
According to the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) practical guidelines for CD 
management [Dignass et al (2010)], early toxicity from methotrexate is primarily gastrointestinal 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and stomatitis) and can be limited by co-prescription of folic acid 5 mg 
two or three days apart from the methotrexate. Treatment is discontinued in 10–18% of patients 
because of side-effects (Fraser et al. 2003).  
A study of liver biopsies in IBD patients taking methotrexate showed only mild histologic abnormalities, 
despite cumulative doses of up to 5410 mg [Te et al (2000)]. Surveillance liver biopsy is not 
warranted, but if the AST doubles then it is sensible to withhold methotrexate until it returns to normal

before a rechallenge. The prevalence of pneumonitis has been estimated to be 2–3 cases per 100 
patients-years of exposure, but large series have not reported any cases (Fraser et al. 2003).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Methotrexate side-effects incidence and severity may be acute, related to dose, frequency of 
administration, and the duration of the exposure to significant blood levels of methotrexate to the 
Assessment report

target organs. The most common dose-related toxic effects of methotrexate are on the bone marrow 
and gastrointestinal tract. Bone-marrow depression can occur abruptly, and leukopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, and anaemia may all occur. Long term side-effects besides vigilance of 
haematological values are mainly GI related: nausea, elevated liver enzymes and progression to 
fibrosis. Pulmonary side-effects are also known. The proposed dose is within the posology for the other 
therapeutic indications. Data included in the proposed population included in the indication are mainly 
from case series and retrospective studies. 
The MAH provided an extended review based on the available data for CD in adults and children. The 
studies presented support a similar safety profile in the proposed indication. The CHMP considered that 
the information in the product information adequately describes the safety profile. The MAH took the 
opportunity to delete from the package leaflet the influenza vaccine from the examples of live vaccines 
as most influenza vaccines are not live vaccines. 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version v5.3 with this application. Among other changes, the 
combination of the products Nordimet (EMEA/H/C/00398) and Imeth (NL/H/2607/001-008/MR) into a 
single EU RMP was proposed with this version.  
In view of the well-established safety profile and long-term experience with the use of methotrexate, 
the MAH was requested to delete the following important/potential risks from the RMP: 
• 
Increased risk of neoplasia 
•  Bone growth defects in the paediatric population  
• 
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy 
(“Lymphoma”  is  considered  included  in  “increased  risk  of  neoplasia”.  It  can  therefore  also  be  deleted 
from the list of safety concerns.)  
The above mentioned risks do not require additional pharmacovigilance activities. The important risk 
(Increased risk of neoplasia) and potential risks (Bone growth defects in the paediatric population, 
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy) will be assessed within future PSUSA procedures. 
Additionally, the following was aligned in the updated RMP: 
• 
• 
“Leukoencephalopathia” was deleted from important identified risks. 
“Medication  error,  including  overdose  from  inadvertent  daily  instead  of  weekly  dosing”  was 
reworded to “Medication errors due to inadvertent daily instead of once weekly dosing”. 
During the assessment it was noted that the RMP of Imeth states that “intestinal perforation” is 
included as a warning in the SmPC but not for Nordimet and the applicant was asked for clarification. 
The company clarified that there are no non-clinical findings confirmed by clinical data. In the MAHs 
safety database, one case was retrieved corresponding to one event (PT= diverticular perforation). 
This event was serious due to hospitalization criteria. The outcome was recovered with sequelae. The 
MAH assessed this event as possibly related to methotrexate; however, other etiologies cannot be 
ruled out (e.g relevant history included sickle cell disease).  
This case report was not considered strong evidence of causal relationship and a pharmaco-
epidemiological study performed by Curtis et al (2011) investigated the incidence of GI perforation in 
patients with RA using a database of a large US health plan. They assessed the rate of GIP in relation 
to a variety of medications commonly used for the treatment of RA. Among 40,841 RA patients, 37 
hospitalizations with GI perforation were identified. The rate of GI perforation among current biologic 
users concomitantly exposed to oral glucocorticoids was higher (rate=1.12 per 1,000 patient-years, 
95% CI 0.50, 2.49) than for biologic users who were not glucocorticoid users (rate=0.47 per 1000 
Assessment report  
EMA/56247/2021  
Page 35/46 
 
 
 
patient-years , 95% CI 0.22, 0.98) or MTX users using glucocorticoids (rate=0.87 per 1000 patient-
years , 95% CI 0.36, 2.10). Neither biologics nor MTX were significantly associated with perforation, in 
contrast to current use of glucocorticoids and NSAIDs together (hazard ratio =4.7, 95% CI 1.9, 12.0) 
or glucocorticoids alone (hazard ratio=2.8, 95% CI 1.3, 6.1). Diverticulitis also was a strong risk factor 
(hazard ratio = 9.1, 95% CI 3.1, 26.4). Seventy percent of perforation cases used glucocorticoids, had 
antecedent diverticulitis, or both. A majority of patients were either glucocorticoid users or had 
previously recognized diverticulitis, these individuals should be considered at higher risk. Whilst no 
causal association with methotrexate can be concluded the MAH proposed to align the existing warning 
on diarrhea and stomatitis following dehydration with the SmPC of other MTX containing products 
adding in 4.4 “Diarrhoea and ulcerative stomatitis can be toxic effects and require interruption of 
therapy, otherwise haemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. If 
haematemesis, black discoloration of the stool or blood in stool occur, therapy is to be interrupted.” 
which was endorsed by the CHMP. No additional information on intestinal perforation was included in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC, which was acceptable to the CHMP as it is in line with other MTX containing 
products.  
Additionally,  the  RMP  was  updated  with  information  on  the  DHPC  as  circulated  after  the  Referral 
procedure  EMEA/H/A-31/1463  as  an  additional  Risk  minimization  measure  which  was  considered 
acceptable. 
The posology section for children and adolescents below 16 years with polyarthritic forms of juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis includes a statement that the safety and efficacy of Nordimet in children < 3 years 
of age have not been established and that no data are available. Accordingly, the MAH added the use 
in children < 3 years as missing information for the therapy of polyarthritic forms of severe, active 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in the RMP. This point should be further monitored by routine 
pharmacovigilance. The respective data should be provided and discussed in future PSURs, especially 
with regards to whether the safety profile differs from that characterized so far. At the CHMP request, 
section 4.4 of the SmPC was aligned to include the following information: “Use in children < 3 years of 
age is not recommended as insufficient data on efficacy and safety are available for this population. 
(see section 4.2).” 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Methotrexates known side-effects incidence and severity may be acute, related to  dose, frequency of 
administration, and the duration of the exposure to significant blood levels of methotrexate to the target 
organs.  The  most  common  dose-related  toxic  effects  of  methotrexate  are  on  the  bone  marrow  and 
gastrointestinal tract. Bone-marrow depression can occur abruptly, and leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, 
and anaemia may all occur. Long term side-effects besides vigilance of haematological values are mainly 
GI related: nausea, elevated liver enzymes and progression to fibrosis. Pulmonary side-effects are also 
known. The proposed dose is within the posology for the other therapeutic indications.  
The data submitted with the present application are mainly from retrospective studies and case series; 
however, based on the extended review of available data for CD provided a similar safety profile  in the 
indication  “Induction of remission in moderate steroid-dependent Crohn's disease in adult patients, in 
combination with corticosteroids and for maintenance of remission, as monotherapy, in patients who 
have responded to methotrexate”  can be concluded. The CHMP considered that the information in the 
product information adequately describes the safety profile.

2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version v5.3 with this application. The main proposed RMP 
changes were the following: 
• 
Update of RMP in line with the Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP) Module V 
(EMA/838713/2011 Rev 2) including review of safety concerns. 
• 
Combination of the products Nordimet (EMEA/H/C/00398) and Imeth (NL/H/2607/001-
008/MR) into a single EU RMP.  
• 
Inclusion of a new indication for Nordimet: Mild to moderate Crohn's disease either alone or in 
combination with corticosteroids in patients refractory or intolerant to thiopurines. 
• 
Addition of risk minimisation measures as an outcome of the methotrexate Referral procedure 
(EMEA/H/A-31/1463) regarding medication errors. 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan:

basis of a bridging report making reference to Nordimet PEN. The bridging report submitted by the 
MAH has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The  MAH  claimed  an  indication  for  methotrexate  solution  for  injection  in  the  “treatment  of  mild  to 
moderate  Crohn's  disease  either  alone  or  in  combination  with  corticosteroids  in  patients  refractory  or 
intolerant to thiopurines”. 
The dosing recommendations were as follows: 
Dosage in adult patients with Crohn's disease:  
• 
Induction treatment: 25 mg/week administered subcutaneously.  
Response to treatment can be expected after approximately 8 to 12 weeks.  
•  Maintenance treatment: 15 mg/week administered subcutaneously.  
Dosage in children and adolescents with Crohn's disease:  
• 
Induction treatment: 15 mg/m2 BSA/week to a maximum of 25 mg administered 
subcutaneously. 
Response to treatment can be expected after approximately 8 to 12 weeks.  
•  Maintenance treatment: Children: 10 mg/ m2 BSA/week to a maximum of 15 mg administered 
subcutaneously. 
The safety and efficacy of Nordimet in children < 3 years of age have not been established (see section 
4.4). No data available. 
CD is a chronic relapsing, remitting inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, the cause of 
which remains unknown. Some patients may have a continuously clinically active disease.  
Nordimet, was authorised 18/08/2016 as a hybrid medicinal product as defined in Article 10(3) of 
Directive 2001/83/EC referring to the reference product Lantarel FS 25mg/ml from Pfizer Pharma 
GmbH. Nordimet is supplied in prefilled pens for subcutaneous use containing volumes ranging from 
0.3 to 1ml. One ml of solution contains 25 mg of methotrexate. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Remission in CD can be achieved either by medical treatment or surgery. Medical therapy 
recommended by clinical guidelines includes corticosteroids, immunosuppressant drugs and biologics 
(anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α agents and adhesion molecule inhibitors). 
Thiopurines are used for induction of remission in milder patients, maintenance therapy and 
association with biologics for induction of remission. Methotrexate is used as a second line agent for 
induction of remission when other alternatives cannot be used and for maintenance of remission in 
Assessment report  
EMA/56247/2021  
Page 41/46 
 
 
 
steroid dependent CD.  For moderate to severe patients induction of remission is recommended with 
biologics.  
Methotrexate parenterally has been included in clinical guidelines as a second line option (ACG) but the 
more recent guidelines from ECCO 2020 (Torres et al) only includes a reference for its use  in 
moderate to severe disease, for induction of clinical remission when other alternatives cannot be used 
and for maintenance of remission in patients with steroid-dependent CD, due to an increased number 
of medicines approved for CD. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application is solely based on published literature. The pivotal evidence provided is based on two 
publications: 
Feagan et al 1995 study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study of weekly 
injections of methotrexate in patients who had chronically active CD despite a minimum of three 
months of prednisone therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with intramuscular 
methotrexate (25 mg once weekly) or placebo for 16 weeks. The patients also received prednisone (20 
mg once a day), which was tapered over a period of 10 weeks unless their condition worsened. The 
primary outcome measure was clinical remission at the end of the 16-week trial. 
Feagan et al (2000) was a double-blind, placebo controlled, multicentre study of patients with 
chronically active CD who had entered remission after 16 to 24 weeks of treatment with 25 mg of 
methotrexate given intramuscularly once weekly. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness 
of MTX in maintaining remission in patients with CD. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Feagan et al (1995) showed that methotrexate was more effective than placebo in improving 
symptoms and reducing requirements for prednisone. The study was conducted in patients who had 
chronically active Crohn’s disease despite a minimum of three months of prednisone therapy. Patients 
were randomly assigned to treatment with intramuscular methotrexate (25 mg once weekly) or 
placebo for 16 weeks. The patients also received prednisone (20 mg once a day), which was tapered 
over a period of 10 weeks unless their condition worsened. A total of 141 patients were randomly 
assigned in a 2:1 ratio to methotrexate (94 patients) or placebo (47 patients). After 16 weeks, 37 
patients (39.4%) were in clinical remission in the methotrexate group, as compared with 9 patients 
(19.4%, P=0.025;) in the placebo group. The patients in the methotrexate group received less 
prednisone overall than those in the placebo group (P=0.026). The mean score on the Crohn’s Disease 
Activity Index after 16 weeks of treatment was significantly lower in the methotrexate group (162) 
than in the placebo group (204, P=0.002).  
Feagan et al (2000) showed that a low dose of methotrexate maintains remission. The study 
included patients who had entered remission after 16 to 24 weeks of treatment with 25 mg of 
methotrexate given intramuscularly once weekly. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 
methotrexate at a dose of 15 mg intramuscularly once weekly or placebo for 40 weeks. No other 
treatments for Crohn’s disease were permitted. Of the included patients, 40 received methotrexate, 
and 36 received placebo. At week 40, 26 patients (65%) were in remission in the methotrexate group, 
as compared with 14 (39%) in the placebo group (P=0.04). Fewer patients in the methotrexate group 
than in the placebo group required prednisone for relapse (28% versus 58%, P=0.01).

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Efficacy of methotrexate in Crohn´s disease is mainly based in small studies or studies started in the 
90s. A double blind placebo-controlled trial, multicentre and randomized (Feagan et al 1995) is 
submitted as the pivotal basis for this application in induction therapy, and a similarly sized study 
(Feagan et al 2000) is submitted as the pivotal basis for this application in maintenance therapy. These 
studies included a steroid dependent population and were designed in the early 90s. Patients were 
requested not to take immunosuppressives concomitantly (presumably due to the increased risks 
associated with dual immunosuppression), but there is no mentioning of the “response status” or 
“tolerability status” to thiopurines. 
Patient enrolled in the study by Feagan et al., 1995 had chronically active Crohn’s disease despite a 
minimum of three months of prednisone therapy. A claim on monotherapy can therefore not supported 
based on this data. 
Patient enrolled in the study by Feagan et al 2000 had entered remission after 16 to 24 weeks of 
treatment with 25 mg of methotrexate given intramuscularly once weekly. No other treatments for 
Crohn’s disease were permitted. Accordingly, the study can only support an indication in patients who 
have responded to MTX in the induction of remission phase.  
The population included also seems more steroid resistant than “thiopurine intolerant or resistant”. The 
recent Feagan et al 2014 study did not confirm any benefit of the association of Infliximab with 
methotrexate besides a lower level of antibodies in the IFX+ MTX arm. In this context it should be 
noted, that the medical need in the indication of CD has changed considerably in the recent years. 
While, there were no/limited alternatives in the population with failed thiopurines treatment before the 
treatment with biologics became broadly available variable treatment options are available today. 
Thus, the place of pMTX in the treatment of CD has narrowed considering the broad spectrum of 
treatment options. 
Several other studies submitted used methotrexate but with different administration routes (ev and oral) 
inferior dose and with mixed population included most of them with small numbers. Most of the patients 
were treated with steroids, with variation in dosages.  
Studies from the paediatric population have also been included confirming that MTX is being used but 
most of the data are open-label series, retrospective, non-randomised, non-controlled studies in 
variable population, with variable prior/concomitant treatments, variable doses of MTX and routes of 
administration applied. Based on such heterogeneous data, no conclusions can be drawn for dosage, 
route of administration and CD paediatric population.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Methotrexate known side-effects incidence and severity may be acute, related to dose, frequency of 
administration, and the duration of the exposure to significant blood levels of methotrexate to the 
target organs. The most common dose-related toxic effects of methotrexate are on the bone marrow 
and gastrointestinal tract. Bone-marrow depression can occur abruptly, and leukopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, and anaemia may all occur. Long term side-effects besides vigilance of 
haematological values are mainly GI related: nausea, elevated liver enzymes and progression to 
fibrosis. Pulmonary side-effects are also known. The proposed dose is within the posology for the other 
therapeutic indications. Data included in the proposed population included in the indication are mainly 
from case series and retrospective studies. 
The MAH provided an extended review based on the available data for CD. The studies presented due

support to a similar safety profile in the proposed indication.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Methotrexate Nordimet has been approved as a Hybrid application for treatment of RA, Psoriasis when 
a systemic therapy is needed and polyarticular arthritis. The reference product is Lanctarel, Pfizer. The 
MAH has applied for an extension of Indication to include the treatment of mild to moderate Crohn's 
disease either alone or in combination with corticosteroids in patients refractory or intolerant to 
thiopurines. The reference product does not have this indication and this application is based on 
submitted literature. 
Methotrexate in parenteral dosing has been used since de 90s and similar methotrexate parenteral 
formulations authorised in the EU have an indication in the treatment of Crohn’s disease. 
The data presented by the MAH are mostly from old studies and no RCT completely reflects the 
proposed indication. Design of most of the studies is limited either by the numbers of patients included 
or by bias such as steroid dosage. Data in children are very heterogeneous and lack robust evidence. 
Most of the studies are case series or retrospective studies from the literature. Detailed review of 
safety data in the proposed indication based on literature was provided and confirmed the well-known 
safety profile of Methotrexate containing products.

The CHMP considered that the evidence provided is far from robust: pivotal trials (reported by Feagan 
et al) are from 1995 and 2000 and the standard of care changed in the recent years. The current ECCO 
guideline (Torres et al., 2020) excludes MTX but keeps the possibility of its use in a population 
"steroid-dependent, moderate to severe with no indication for surgery”. The same guideline removes 
tiopurines as induction of remission therapy. The British guidelines from the Society of 
Gastroenterology (Lamb et al, Gut, 2019) still recommend MTX for induction of remission and 
maintenance of remission.  
The CHMP considered that the indication claim “in patients intolerant or refractory to thiopurines” has 
not been justified based on submitted data. Patients in the Feagan studies (Feagan et al 1995 and 
2000) were requested not to take immunosuppressives concomitantly (presumably due to the 
increased risks associated with dual immunosuppression), but there is no mentioning of the “response 
status” or “tolerability status” to thiopurines. Furthermore, the patients were classified as 
corticosteroid resistant/dependent based on the concomitant steroid dose received. In the 
maintenance study Feagen et al (2000) the same patients were treated with MTX monotherapy after 
achieving remission with a combined MTX/corticosteroid treatment. 
The paediatric studies provided do not include any RCT being only small open label studies, case series 
or retrospective studies, which does not support the use of MTX for the treatment of paediatric 
population with Crohn’s Disease. 
The CHMP was of the opinion that the claimed indication “mild to moderate Crohn's disease either 
alone or in combination with corticosteroids in patients refractory or intolerant to thiopurines” was not 
justified based on the results and the study conditions (patient population, concomitant medication) of 
the pivotal studies by Feagan et al (1995, 2000).  
However, the CHMP acknowledged that the pivotal studies did show efficacy in the population studied 
which was comprised of adult patients who had moderate chronically active Crohn’s disease despite a 
minimum of three months of prednisone therapy during induction and were treated for maintenance 
with MTX without other treatments for Crohn’s disease permitted.  
In line with the above and at the CHMP’s request, the MAH agreed to amend the indication as follows: 
“Induction of remission in moderate steroid-dependent Crohn's disease in adult patients, in 
combination with corticosteroids and for maintenance of remission, as monotherapy, in patients who 
have responded to methotrexate” 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on above consideration the benefit risk balance for Nordimet for induction of remission in 
moderate steroid-dependent Crohn's disease in adult patients, in combination with corticosteroids and 
for maintenance of remission, as monotherapy, in patients who have responded to methotrexate is 
positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Nordimet is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of Indication to include the new indication “Induction of remission in moderate steroid-
dependent Crohn's disease in adult patients, in combination with corticosteroids and for maintenance 
of remission, as monotherapy, in patients who have responded to methotrexate” for Nordimet; as a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated 
in accordance. The RMP version 5.3 has been adopted. The MAH took the opportunity to update the 
RMP with changes related to GVP V version 2 template and the outcome of MTX referral. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for betaine anhydrous, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Cerebral oedema is listed as a potential important risk for betaine anhydrous. During this reporting 
period, a new case of brain oedema was reported in a patient with cystathionine beta-synthase 
(CBS) deficiency. Cumulatively, a total of six cases of brain oedema were reported. A review of 
these cases showed that only this subpopulation of patients with CBS deficiency treated with betaine 
anhydrous present a risk of hypermethioninemia, associated with brain oedema. 
Therefore, in view of the available data, the PRAC considered that changes to the product 
information were warranted.The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for betaine anhydrous the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing betaine anhydrous is favourable subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.

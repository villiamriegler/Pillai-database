2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2018 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
The sponsor Astellas Pharma Europe B.V. submitted on 22 September 2017 an application for 
designation as an orphan medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product 
containing gilteritinib for treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (hereinafter referred to as “the 
condition”). The application was submitted on the basis of Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of Regulation 
(EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products. 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing gilteritinib was considered 
justified based on preliminary clinical data demonstrating that patients responded to treatment; 
• 
the condition is life threatening and chronically debilitating due to the consequences of bone 
marrow dysfunction, such as intracranial or gastro-intestinal haemorrhagic episodes, disseminated 
intravascular coagulation, and the risk of severe infections. The condition progresses rapidly and is 
fatal within days to weeks or a few months if left untreated. The overall 5-year relative survival 
with the currently available treatments is approximately 22%; 
• 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 1 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European Union, 
the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product 
containing gilteritinib will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The sponsor has 
provided preliminary clinical data that demonstrate that relapsed or refractory patients responded to 
treatment. There are currently no authorised treatments for this patient population. The Committee 
considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing gilteritinib as an orphan medicinal product for the 
orphan indication: treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia.  
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
Page 4/11 
 
 
 
 
Condition 
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a disease characterised by rapid, uncontrolled proliferation of 
malignant clonal haematopoietic stem cells that accumulate as immature, undifferentiated cells 
(blasts) and lead to impaired production of normal haematopoietic elements, which in turn leads to 
anaemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. The COMP continues to accept AML as orphan condition 
for the purpose of orphan designation and maintenance. 
Xospata (gilteritinib) is a small molecule FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and AXL tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor for oral administration. 
The currently proposed therapeutic indication “Xospata is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment 
of adult patients who have relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with a FLT3 mutation 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.1)” falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of 
acute myeloid leukaemia”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Please refer to the European public assessment report (EPAR) of Xospata. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
At the time of initial designation, the COMP agreed that the condition was chronically debilitating and 
life-threatening. At the time of this review, AML is presented to the COMP to remain chronically 
debilitating and life threatening. The most recent reported data from the US SEER database reports an 
annual age-adjusted mortality rate of AML of 2.8 per 100,000. Outcomes are worse for patients aged ≥ 
60 years, with CR rates in the range of 40% to 55% and poor long-term survival rates. 
The COMP concluded that the condition remains life threatening and chronically debilitating due to the 
consequences of bone marrow dysfunction, such as intracranial or gastro-intestinal haemorrhagic 
episodes, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and the risk of severe infections. The condition 
progresses rapidly and is fatal within a few months if left untreated. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
At the time of designation the prevalence was agreed to be approximately 1 per 10,000.  
For this review the prevalence was presented to the COMP to remain less than 5 per 10,000 and was 
estimated to be 1.36 per 10,000. The sponsor provided an overview of various population based 
registries reporting on the prevalence of AML in Europe (table 1). The RARECAREnet data were 
relatively outdated with data collection up to 2008. The Swedish and NORDCAN datasets provide the 
more recent prevalence figures. The NORDCAN project, a database of epidemiological cancer data for 
Denmark, Finland, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, reported an overall 
AML prevalence of 1.35 per 10,000 at the end of 2016 for the 5 Nordic countries collectively (Denmark, 
Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden). On the basis of the provided data, the COMP accepted a 
prevalence estimate of approximately 1.4 per 10,000.

Table 1.  Prevalence data overview as provided by the sponsor 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The following products were identified to be authorised for the treatment of the orphan condition: 
histamine dihydrochloride, decitabine, azacitidine, daunorubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone, etoposide, 
cytarabine (Ara-C), thioguanine, L-asparaginase, doxorubicin, vincristine sulphate, cyclophosphamide.  
Rydapt (midostaurin) has been authorised in combination with standard daunorubicin and cytarabine 
induction and high dose cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy, and for patients in complete response 
followed by Rydapt single agent maintenance therapy, for adult patients with newly diagnosed acute 
myeloid leukaemia (AML) who are FLT3 mutation positive.  
Vyxeos (daunorubicin and cytarabine) has been authorised for the treatment of adults with newly 
diagnosed, therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related 
changes (AML-MRC).  
Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) has recently been authorised and is indicated for combination 
therapy with daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (AraC) for the treatment of patients age 15 years and 
above with previously untreated, de novo CD33-positive acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), except acute 
promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). 
The COMP also took into consideration the latest European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 
treatment guideline from Fey and Buske 2013 discussing the current treatment options for AML in 
adult patients (Ann Oncol 2013; 24 (Suppl 6): vi138-vi143).  
Significant benefit 
The COMP noted that Xospata is a small molecule FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and AXL tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor for oral administration for authorisation in the R/R AML setting. EMA protocol 
assistance prior to marketing authorisation was requested, however the demonstration of significant 
benefit was not prospectively discussed with the COMP. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
Page 6/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Significant benefit had to be demonstrated in adult patients who have relapsed or refractory acute 
myeloid leukaemia (R/R AML) with a FLT3 mutation. For this patient population, the latest ESMO 
guideline outlines that carefully selected patients with an HLA-matched donor may be offered 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation, albeit with limited chances of success and at the cost of 
considerable morbidity from this procedure. For patients unsuited to this approach, best standard of 
care (BSC) or palliative systemic treatment is often a reasonable option with, at least, limited toxic 
effect. Taking into consideration the ESMO guideline and the authorisation status of medicinal products 
in AML, it was considered that significant benefit would need to be established over medicinal products 
that are authorised in leukaemia and/or AML and are used in the salvage therapy of R/R AML.  
The results of study 2215-CL-0301 (ADMIRAL) have been presented to demonstrate significant benefit 
over the currently authorised salvage therapies.  ADMIRAL was a phase 3, open-label, multicenter, 
randomised study of Xospata versus salvage chemotherapy in patients with FLT3 positive AML 
refractory to or relapsed after first-line treatment with or without HSCT consolidation. The results of 
this clinical trial were assessed as pivotal evidence by the CHMP (please also refer to the EPAR of 
Xospata).  
A total of 371 patients were enrolled and randomised to gilteritinib (247 subjects) or salvage 
chemotherapy (124 subjects). Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive gilteritinib 120 mg 
once daily (the dose could be titrated according to protocol or to one the 4 salvage chemotherapy 
regimens (high-intensity chemotherapy [MEC or FLAG-IDA] or low-intensity chemotherapy [LoDAC or 
azacitidine]). All patients in the ITT previously received induction chemotherapy for AML, which 
included known and investigational anticancer agents.   
In detail, the comparator chemotherapy regimens were: 
1.  LoDAC:  low intensity chemotherapy, 20 mg cytarabine was administered twice daily by 
subcutaneous (sc) or intravenous (iv) injection for 10 days.  
2.  Azacitidine: low intensity chemotherapy, 75 mg/m2 azacitidine was administered daily by sc or iv 
injection for 7 days.  
3.  MEC: high intensity chemotherapy 
-  Mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2 per day was administered by iv for 5 days (days 1 through 5). 
- 
Etoposide 100 mg/m2 per day was administered by iv for 5 days (days 1 through 5). 
-  Cytarabine 1000 mg/m2 per day was administered by iv for 5 days (days 1 through 5). 
4.  FLAG-IDA: high intensity chemotherapy 
-  G-CSF 300 µg/m2 per day was administered by sc/iv for 5 days (days 1 through 5).  
Additional   G-CSF by sc/iv was recommended 7 days after completing chemotherapy until 
absolute   neutrophil count (ANC) > 0.5 X 109/L. 
- 
Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 per day was administered by iv for 5 days (days 2 through 6). 
-  Cytarabine 2000 mg/m2 per day was administered by iv for 5 days (days 2 through 6). 
- 
Idarubicin 10 mg/m2 per day was administered by iv for 3 days (days 2 through 4). 
The co-primary endpoints were (a) overall survival (OS) defined as the time from the date of 
randomisation until the date of death from any cause, and (b) complete remission/complete remission 
with partial hematological recovery (CR/CRh), defined as the number of patients who achieved either 
CR or CRh at any of the postbaseline visits divided by the number of patients in the analysis

population. Key and other secondary endpoint included event-free survival (EFS) and CR rate. For the 
CHMP assessment, the final OS analysis was considered the primary efficacy outcome measure. 
The primary endpoint (OS) in the ITT population showed a statistically significant increase in OS, with 
a HR of 0.637 (95% CI: 0.490- to 0.830, p=0.0004 one-sided log rank test) and a median OS of 9.3 
months and 5.6 months in the gilteritinib and salvage chemotherapy arms, respectively (table 1 and 
figure 1).

Figure 1.  Study 2215-CL-0301 (ADMIRAL): Kaplan-Meier Plot of Overall Survival by Treatment Arm 
(ITT) 
Subgroup analyses were provided comparing overall survival, complete remission rate and composite 
complete remission rate between the gilteritinib arm and the four different treatment selections on the 
control arm in study 2215-CL-0301 (ADMIRAL): low-dose cytarabine (LoDAC), azacitidine, MEC 
(mitoxantrone, etoposide, cytarabine) and FLAG-IDA (G-CSF, fludarabine, cytarabine, idarubicin). The 
subgroup comparisons included patients randomised to the gilteritinib arm that were pre-selected for 
low intensity chemotherapy (LIC) versus LoDAC and azacitidine respectively, and patients randomised 
to the gilteritinib arm that were pre-selected for high intensity chemotherapy (HIC) versus MEC and 
FLAG-IDA respectively. It should be noted that these are post-hoc subgroup analyses and the trial was 
not formally powered to show improved effects in the subgroups. Nevertheless, the results suggest a 
consistent treatment effect on OS across the analysed subgroups. For gilteritinib (preselected LIC) vs 
LoDAC, the median OS was 6.4 months vs 2.8 months (HR 0.567 [95% CI: 0.306, 1.050]), with a 
composite complete remission (CRc) rate of 49% vs 0. For gilteritinib (preselected LIC) vs azacitidine, 
the median OS was 6.4 months vs 5.1 months (HR 0.557 [95% CI: 0.353, 0.879]), with a CRc rate of 
49% vs 6.3%. For the gilteritinib (preselected HIC) vs MEC, the median OS was 10.5 months vs 5.0 
months (HR 0.408 [95% CI: 0.260, 0.641), with a CRc rate of 57.7% vs 39.4%. For the gilteritinib 
(preselected HIC) vs FLAG-IDA the median OS was 10.5 months vs 7.5 months, (HR 0.891 [95% CI: 
0.577, 1.377]), with a CRc rate of 57.7% vs 28.6%.  
The COMP considered that most of the authorised salvage therapies in R/R leukaemia and AML were 
used in the comparator arm of the ADMIRAL study. Anthracyclines like doxorubicin and daunorubicin 
have been authorised as salvage therapies in the R/R AML setting and were not studied in the 
ADMIRAL trial. However, the anthracycline idarubicin was used as part of the comparator regimen 
FLAG-IDA. Therefore, the COMP considered that significant benefit over this class of medicines in R/R 
AML salvage therapy was sufficiently justified on the basis of the presented comparative clinical data of 
Xospata over the FLAG-IDA regimen. 
In conclusion, the pivotal study 2215-CL-0301 (ADMIRAL) provided evidence that Xospata extended 
overall survival when directly compared against commonly used salvage regimens in the intensive and 
non-intensive setting. The COMP considered that the observed improvement in overall survival

constitutes a clinically relevant advantage over current satisfactory methods in adult R/R AML patients 
with FLT3 mutation.

4.  COMP position adopted on 23 September 2019 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
• 
the prevalence of acute myeloid leukaemia (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 1.4 in 10,000 
persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
• 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the consequences of bone 
marrow dysfunction, such as intracranial or gastro-intestinal haemorrhagic episodes, disseminated 
intravascular coagulation, and the risk of severe infections. The condition progresses rapidly and is 
fatal within a few months if left untreated; 
• 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, Xospata is of significant benefit to adult patients who have relapsed or refractory (R/R) 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a FLT3 mutation. Significant benefit over currently authorised 
intensive and non-intensive salvage regimens was demonstrated in an open-label, multicenter, 
randomised phase 3 study in patients with FLT3 positive R/R AML comparing Xospata with salvage 
chemotherapy, with the option of two different non-intensive salvage chemotherapies (low dose 
cytarabine and azacitidine) or two different commonly used intensive chemotherapies MEC 
(mitoxantrone, etoposide, cytarabine) and FLAG-IDA (G-CSF, fludarabine, cytarabine, idarubicin). 
The data demonstrated that Xospata treatment resulted in a statistically significant improvement in 
overall survival compared to salvage chemotherapy. The COMP concluded that this constitutes a 
clinically relative advantage in patients affected by the condition due to an improvement in clinical 
efficacy. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Xospata, gilteritinib, 
EU/3/17/1961 for treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia is not removed from the Community Register 
of Orphan Medicinal Products.

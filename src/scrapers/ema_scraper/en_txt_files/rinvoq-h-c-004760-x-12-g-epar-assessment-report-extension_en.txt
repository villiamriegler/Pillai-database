2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Problem statement
2.1.1.  Disease or condition
Ulcerative colitis is one of the two primary forms of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) along 
with Crohn’s Disease (CD).  It is postulated that UC is caused by unregulated and exaggerated local 
immune response to environmental triggers in genetically susceptible individuals.
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Studies conducted in various geographic regions have found an increasing trend in the prevalence of 
UC over time, with the highest prevalence (cases per 100,000 persons) of 505.0 in Europe, 286.3 in 
North America, and 106.2 in Asia and the Middle East.  In a 2017 report, the annual incidence of UC 
(cases per 100,000 person-years) was 57.9 in Europe, 23.1 in North America, and 6.5 in Asia and the 
Middle East.
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis
UC is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disease of the large intestine characterized by inflammation 
and ulceration of mainly the mucosal and occasionally submucosal intestinal layers. The hallmark 
clinical symptoms include bloody diarrhea associated with rectal urgency and tenesmus.  The diagnosis 
of UC is suspected on clinical grounds and supported by diagnostic testing, and elimination of 
infectious causes. 
Ulcerative colitis is a serious disease that, in some cases, may cause life-threatening complications that 
can be fatal. The most severe intestinal manifestations of UC are toxic megacolon and perforation.  
Extra-intestinal complications include arthritis, dermatological conditions, uveitis, and primary 
sclerosing cholangitis.  Subjects with UC are at an increased risk for colon cancer, and the risk 
increases with the duration of disease as well as extent of colon affected by the disease.
2.1.4.  Management
The aim of medical treatment in UC is to control inflammation, reduce symptoms and heal the mucosa.  
Available pharmaceutical therapies are limited, do not always completely abate the inflammatory 
process, and may not heal the mucosa.
Conventional therapies include oral aminosalicylates (e.g., mesalamine, sulfasalazine, olsalazine, 
balsalazide) and corticosteroids. These therapies are recommended for mild to moderate active UC.  
Corticosteroids are used in subjects with more severe symptoms but are not recommended for longer 
term therapy due to their side effects. The frequency and severity of corticosteroid toxicities are 
significant, including infections, emotional and psychiatric disturbances, skin injury, and metabolic 
bone disease. Corticosteroids are not effective for the maintenance of remission, and the UC practice 
guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology state that the optimal goal of management 
is a sustained and durable period of steroid-free remission. Similarly, the European Medicines Agency 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 9/195
(EMA) guideline for Development of new medicinal products for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis 
recommend against chronic steroid treatment. 
Subjects with moderate to severe symptoms may derive some benefits from conventional therapy with 
immunomodulatory agents (azathioprine [AZA], 6 mercaptopurine [6-MP], or methotrexate [MTX]); 
however, the use of these agents is limited as induction treatment due to a slow onset of action (3 to 6 
months) and as maintenance therapy due to adverse events (AEs), including bone marrow 
suppression, infections, hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, and malignancies. 
Biologics agents targeting specific immunological pathways have demonstrated efficacy in treating 
subjects with UC.  Anti tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents (infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab) 
were the first biologics to be used for IBD, followed by vedolizumab, an integrin receptor antagonist, 
and ustekinumab, an interleukin-12 and -23 antagonist. 
Only 17% to 45% of subjects who receive biologics achieve clinical remission.  For some biologics the 
onset of efficacy can be slow and take over 3 months to achieve maximal efficacy, with response rate 
to induction treatment of only about 50%. In addition, anti drug antibodies can lead to loss of response 
and hypersensitivity reactions. 
Even with availability of these therapies, up to 25% of subjects with UC may require hospitalization 
and approximately 15% of subjects develop acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC), a life-threating 
condition where hospitalization and inpatient treatment is advised and where a fast onset of response 
is crucial. Over a decade, approximately 10% to 15% of UC subjects experience an aggressive clinical 
course leading to high rates of relapse, and 10% to 15% of UC subjects require removal of the 
colon/rectum, to eliminate the source of the inflammatory process, although colectomy is accompanied 
by significant morbidity. Thus, there remains a clear medical need for additional therapeutic options in 
UC for subjects with inadequate response to or intolerance to conventional therapies and biologic 
therapies.
The Janus kinases or JAKs are a family of intracellular tyrosine kinases that function as dimers in the 
signaling process of many cytokine receptors. The JAKs play a critical role in both innate and adaptive 
immunity, making them attractive targets for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Targeting the 
JAK signaling pathway for autoimmune diseases is supported by the involvement of various 
proinflammatory cytokines that signal via JAK pathways in the pathogenesis of these immune-
mediated inflammatory disorders.
Pro-inflammatory cytokines (primarily IL-6, IL-7, IL-15, and IFN-γ) transduce signals via the JAK1 
pathway and are involved in ulcerative colitis pathogenesis. 
Tofacitinib, the first drug studied in this class, is an oral JAK inhibitor that inhibits JAK1, JAK2, and 
JAK3 with high in vitro functional specificity for kinases 1 and 3.  Tofacitinib has been approved in the 
United States, Europe, and in other countries for treating moderately to severely active RA and 
subsequently for the treatment of PsA and UC.  Filgotinib is an oral JAK1 inhibitor with high in vitro 
functional specificity for kinases 1 over 2 and is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost 
response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent.
2.2.  About the product
Upadacitinib is a selective and reversible Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that is being developed for the 
treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) in adults. Upadacitinib was approved 
for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the US in August 2019 and in EU in December 2019. It 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 10/195
was approved for treatment of psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis in the EU in January 2021, 
and for atopic dermatitis (AD) in August 2021. 
This proposed new indication is:
Ulcerative colitis
RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative 
colitis who have had an inadequate response, lost response or were intolerant to either conventional 
therapy or a biologic agent.
EMA’s safety committee, PRAC, has started a review of the safety of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors used 
to treat several chronic inflammatory disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis). 
The review was prompted by the final results from a clinical trial (study A3921133) of the JAK inhibitor 
Xeljanz (tofacitinib). The results showed that patients taking Xeljanz for rheumatoid arthritis and who 
were at risk of heart disease were more likely to experience a major cardiovascular problem (such as 
heart attack, stroke or death due to cardiovascular disease) and had a higher risk of developing cancer 
than those treated with medicines belonging to the class of TNF-alpha inhibitors. The study also 
showed that compared with TNF-alpha inhibitors, Xeljanz was associated with a higher risk of death 
due to any cause, serious infections, and blood clots in the lungs and in deep veins (venous 
thromboembolism, VTE). 
In addition, preliminary findings from an observational study involving another JAK inhibitor, Olumiant 
(baricitinib), also suggest an increased risk of major cardiovascular problems and VTE in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis treated with Olumiant compared with those treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors. 
In the treatment of inflammatory disorders, Olumiant and other JAK inhibitors work in a similar way to 
Xeljanz. PRAC is therefore carrying out a review to determine whether these risks are associated with 
all JAK inhibitors authorised in the EU for the treatment of inflammatory disorders and whether the 
marketing authorisations for these medicines should be amended.
The review of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of inflammatory disorders has been initiated at the 
request of the European Commission (EC) under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and is 
currently on-going. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development
The Phase 3 program includes two replicate Phase 3 induction studies (Study M14-234 Substudy 2 and 
Study M14-675), a Phase 3 maintenance study (Study M14-234 Substudy 3), and a Phase 3 long-term 
extension (LTE) study (Study M14-533) (Figure 1).  In addition, a Phase 2b placebo-controlled, dose-
ranging induction study (Study M14-234 Substudy 1) was conducted.

Note: 
Subjects received Upadacitinib 30 mg QD or 45 mg QD in Study M14-234 SS1 who achieved clinical response at the 
end of induction study can also enter Study M14-234 SS3.  Subjects who did not achieve clinical response at the end of 
the induction study from the Phase 2 Study M14-234 SS1, or achieved clinical response per Partial Adapted Mayo 
Score but with missing endoscopy at Week 8/16 of Study M14-234 SS1 or Study M14-675 due to COVID 19 can also 
enter Study M14-533.

Overview of the Upadacitinib UC Phase 3 Program
The MAH received Scientific Advice at the CHMP (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/336739/2016 
EMEA/H/SA/3190/2/2016/II), where the rather complex study design of study M14-234 (a three part 
study with a seamless design including one dose finding part (substudy 1), one induction study 
(substudy 2) and a maintenance study (substudy 3) was discussed and approved. Most of the CHMP 
advices were followed with some minor deviation that are discussed in relevant sections.
2.4.  Quality aspects
2.4.1.  Introduction
The scope of this line extension grouped application is to introduce a higher dose strength of 45 mg to 
the currently approved strengths 15 mg and 30 mg, in order to support a new indication (treatment of 
adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate 
response, lost response or were intolerant to either conventional therapy of a biologic agent). 
The finished product is presented as prolonged-release film-coated tablet containing upadacitinib 
hemihydrate as active substance, equivalent to 45 mg upadacitinib.
Other ingredients are:
-in tablet core: hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol, tartaric acid, silica colloidal 
anhydrous, magnesium stearate;
-in the film-coating: poly(vinyl alcohol), macrogol, talc, titanium dioxide, iron oxide yellow, iron oxide 
red.
The product is available in HDPE bottles with desiccant and propylene cap or in polyvinyl chloride/ 
polyethylene/polychlorotrifluoroethene-aluminium blisters.

EMA/575056/2022 
Page 12/195
2.4.2.  Active Substance
The active substance (AS) upadacitinib has already been assessed in the centralised procedure during 
the initial Marketing Authorisation Application and subsequent variation applications. No new 
information relating to the active substance has been presented in the application for the new 45 mg 
tablet strength; this is acceptable.
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development
The finished product (FP) is presented as an oblong, biconvex film-coated prolonged-release tablet 
containing 45 mg of upadacitinib. The tablet has a yellow colour, and the dimensions are 14.0 mm x 
8.0 mm. The tablet is plain on one side and has “a45” debossed on the other side.
The description and composition of the finished product is satisfactory. The pharmaceutical 
development of the 45 mg prolonged-release tablet was based on the extensive knowledge gained 
during development of the lower strengths (15 mg and 30 mg). The 15 mg and 30 mg prolonged-
release film-coated tablets were co-developed with the 7.5 mg (not marketed in Europe). Development 
information was provided in Module 3 about all the strengths of upadacitinib prolonged-release tablets 
in the original market application EMEA/H/C/004760. 
The release rate of upadacitinib tablets is controlled through the use of hypromellose (hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose, HPMC). Tablets are made using a granulation process where the AS is granulated with 
microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and HPMC. The granules are dried, milled and then blended with the 
extragranular excipients prior to compression into tablets.
Upadacitinib prolonged release 45 mg tablet were developed with the same upadacitinib granules and 
the same extragranular excipients as used in the already assessed 7.5 mg (not marketed in Europe), 
and already authorised 15 and 30 mg tablets. The same granulate blend is used for all tablet 
strengths. All dose strengths of upadacitinib tablets have identical tablet core weight, size and shape 
(15 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg). HPMC is used as a binder and release controlling polymer. The granulate 
blend contains HPMC, where it also serves as a binder. The remaining portion of the HPMC is added 
during preparation of tablet blends. Tablets of various strengths differ in the amount of AS and the 
corresponding amount of filler (MCC) and cosmetic film coating used in the tablets.
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. The quality and function of 
each excipient, their quality and quantity have been sufficiently discussed.
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing bar a change in 
the film-coating colour and debossment of the tablets. Since the new strength subject of this 
application has been developed for a new indication no bioequivalence study was performed.
There were two major goals for developing an appropriate Upadacitinib 45 mg Prolonged Release 
Tablet dissolution method: (1) clinically relevant discrimination between the 30 mg formulations used 
to establish IVIVC for the upadacitinib lower strengths, and (2) complete release from the 45 mg 
Upadacitinib Tablet. The dissolution method for 7.5, 15 and 30 mg is not appropriate for the 45 mg 
tablet because it does not provide clinically relevant results and it does not enable complete in vitro 
release. The development of the proposed dissolution method waError! Reference source not

found.s described in detail in the dossier and the proposed dissolution conditions were scientifically 
justified. 
The discriminatory power of the proposed 45 mg dissolution method was primarily based on the Level 
A Linear IVIVC established across the 15, 30 and 45 mg tablets. The discriminatory power of the 
dissolution method was demonstrated using 30 mg tablet dissolution data (generated using the 
proposed 45 mg method). It is agreed that these data also can be representative for the 45 mg tablet 
because it was sufficiently demonstrated that the method can distinguish non-bioequivalent batches 
from the commercial formulation. The use of the 30 mg tablets to demonstrate the discriminatory 
properties of the proposed 45 mg dissolution method is further justified based on the similarity in the 
formulation design and the release mechanism for all dosage strengths. In addition, this dissolution 
method was used to establish a Level A IVIVC including the 45 mg strength. The Level A IVIVC has 
been acceptably established and further justify the discriminatory properties of the 45 mg method.
The Level A IVIVC is acceptably designed and validated across 15, 30 and 45 mg dosage strengths and 
supports the future use of a biowaiver for the 45 mg strength.
Dissolution results demonstrating that there is no risk for dose dumping in the presence of alcohol had 
been presented for the 30 mg tablets; it is agreed that these data also are applicable for the 45 mg 
tablet strength.
A summary of the manufacturing process development history is included in the dossier. 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. A summary of the 
systematic quality risk management (QRM) process utilised during development was presented in the 
dossier. The quality target product (QTPP) of this higher strength is identical to that of the already 
assessed 7.5 mg and already authorised, 15 mg and 30 mg strengths. 
The process covers definition of the quality target product profile (QTPP), identification of critical 
quality attributes (CQAs) risk assessment and evaluation of risk factors on the drug product CQAs. The 
critical quality attributes identified are: assay, uniformity of dosage units, degradation products, 
dissolution, microbiological quality, water content, and appearance.The risk factors evaluated were 
found to be related to formulation, process and packaging. For the initial risk assessment, an overall 
risk rating was given for the impact of each risk factor on each CQA based on early development, 
clinical manufacturing, scientific rationale, mathematical modeling, previous experience with similar 
products and/or literature sources. 
Based on the initial risk assessment, areas for development were identified and development work was 
carried out. All of the risk factors were mitigated to low in the final risk assessment. A discussion of the 
risks associated with each CQA was presented in the dossier.
Overall, the manufacturing process development has been described in sufficient details. Critical 
Process Parameters (CPPs) were discussed in relation to Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) identified 
during formulation development. The acceptable ranges applied for CPPs and in process controls (IPCs) 
are justified. 
Design spaces covering granulation and coating of the finish product were evaluated and found 
acceptable in the initial MAA application (EMEA/H/C/004760). For the current procedure, the same 
granules are utilised as for 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, and an identical design space covering the 
granulation process is suggested. As the new strength uses a different coating in a slightly different 
amount, the design space covering the coating process has been slightly modified compared to the 
design space already approved for 15 mg and 30 mg tablets. 
The design space granulation parameters have been sufficiently justified in the dossier. The coating 
parameters design space is also accepted based on the finished product manufacturers extensive 
Assessment report

Page 14/195
knowledge regarding the manufacturing process and acceptable batch data. As mentioned above, the 
coating is for cosmetic purpose only and that it has no function in the prolonged-release mechanism of 
the formulation. Furthermore, none of the process parameters associated with coating is found to be 
critical. Therefore, the proposed design spaces covering the granulation and the coating steps are 
found to be acceptable for the new strength too.
The product is available in HDPE bottles with desiccant and a child resistant polypropylene (PP) cap or 
in polyvinyl chloride/ polyethylene/ polychlorotrifluoroethene polymer blisters with push through 
aluminium foil.
This is the same packaging material used for the authorised strengths. Specifications were provided for 
all packaging materials and compliance with relevant EU legislation has been confirmed for the blister 
packaging materials and the bottle pack. At the time of initial approval, it has also been confirmed that 
the bottle with child resistant closure complies with ISO8317. 
The critical attributes of the container closure have been discussed in relation to product CQAs and it 
has been concluded that the packaging should protect the product from moisture. Moisture uptake 
modelling studies were presented, the selected packaging configurations have been evaluated in 
stability studies and confirmed suitable. The information provided is assessed as sufficient to support 
the use of the selected container closures.
2.4.3.1.  Manufacture of the product and process controls
The manufacturing process consists of six unit operations: granulation, milling, blending, tableting, 
cosmetic coating and packaging. An acceptable process description has been provided.
A summary of the full finished product control strategy has been presented. The in-process controls 
(IPCs) and their applied limits have been justified and acceptable ranges have been set. The blending 
unit operation was identified as the only critical step in the process and is controlled by an appropriate 
IPC (total number of revolutions in the blending unit operation). No other critical process parameters 
have been identified.
Design spaces were developed and proposed for the granulation and coating steps of the 
manufacturing process of the medicinal product at commercial scale; these steps of the process are 
common for all the strengths as they are produced from a common blend. 
Process hold times were already established at the time of initial approval for the milled granulate, 
final blend, uncoated and coated tablets based on relevant stability studies.
The process would be considered a non-standard process as per the process validation guideline 
because it concerns a modified release formulation. However, as with the authorised strength, it has 
been claimed that the manufacturing site has previous experience with similar types of products and in 
the meantime with the authorised RINVOQ tablets as well (150 batches). It is therefore, accepted that 
the applicant has sufficiently justified that the product process can be considered standard for the 
proposed particular manufacturer in line with the relevant guideline.
Process validation will be conducted on three consecutive production-scale batches of the 45 mg 
tablets following a traditional approach at the commercial manufacturing facilities before 
commercialisation of the product. A validation plan including the additional sampling proposed is 
provided in the dossier; this is acceptable.

2.4.3.2.  Product specification
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for 
description (visual), identification (UV, HPLC), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), water 
content (loss on drying - in-house), dissolution (Ph. Eur.) and uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.).  
The specifications are outlined in accordance with ICH Q6A. Limits for degradation products are in line 
with ICH Q3B. The proposed dissolution a three-point specification limits are in line with the 
requirements stated in “Guideline on quality of oral modified release products” and the Level A IVIVC 
further justify the proposed limits.
It is noted that the specifications cover the same tests as the approved 15 mg and 30 mg tablets. 
The exclusion of tests for microbiological quality, residual solvents, elemental impurities and mutagenic 
impurities have been acceptably justified based on the previously assessed information on the already 
approved strength.
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and 
answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed 
necessary
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of 
finished product has been presented.
Batch analysis data covering 11 batches of the 45 mg prolonged-release tablet was presented, 3 of 
them using the commercial formulation manufactured by the commercial site. All batches including 
those for clinical use meet the commercial specification acceptance criteria.
2.4.3.3.  Stability of the product
Stability data on three representative batches of Rinvoq 45 mg tablets stored in the proposed blisters 
and bottles packaging for up to 12 months under long-term conditions (25 ± 2 °C / 60% ± 5% RH) 
and at intermediate (30 ± 2 °C / 75% ± 5% RH), and under accelerated conditions (40 ± 2 °C / 
75% ± 5% RH) for six months has been presented according to ICH guideline. One batch is at 
approximately 80% of the commercial launch batch size and two batches are at 180% of commercial 
launch batch size. If the batch size was scaled up to the maximum commercial batch size, these 
batches would be at 20 and 45% of maximum batch size, respectively. 
Samples were tested for description, assay, degradation products, water content, and dissolution. At 
selected intervals, the tablets were also tested for water activity, total aerobic microbial count (TAMC) 
and total combined yeasts and molds count (TYMC) as per Ph. Eur. methods.
No significant change in any of the quality attributes monitored were seen at either long term, 
intermediate or accelerated conditions. Some out of trend (and out of specification) results were 
recorded for dissolution in both bottle and blister presentations at the 3-month timepoint only, which 
was not observed at later timepoints. The observed higher results was caused by insufficient 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 16/195
preparation of the dissolution medium. After update of the method (more vigorously mixed dissolution 
medium) all subsequent time points have met the dissolution acceptance criteria.
Tablets stored in the bulk package configuration of a single polyethylene bag inside a heat-sealed 
laminate foil bag at -20°C and 50°C/75% RH for 2 weeks, 30°C/75% RH for up to 12 months (2 
batches) and 40°C/75% RH for up to 1 month showed no change in description, assay, degradation 
products and dissolution data compared to initial values. No change was observed for TAMC and TYMC 
at 30°C/75% RH for up to 12 months.
A photostability study as per ICH Q1B for 3 batches was performed. No meaningful changes were 
observed for assay, degradation products, description and dissolution in tablets exposed without the 
primary packaging (3 batches). Based on these stability data, no restrictions will be used to control 
light exposure.
In-use studies were performed for the bottle packaging by removing one tablet at a time over a 60-day 
period after 9 months of storage at 30 °C/ 75% RH (2 batches). The 60-day in-use studies equal to 
twice the expected in-use period and was performed without desiccant representing a worst case 
scenario. No meaningful changes were observed for description, degradation products, assay and 
dissolution. As expected, water content increased as a result of opening and closing the bottle 
repeatedly in the 75% RH environment. Water content values up to 7.6% were observed in the in-use 
studies performed without desiccant. All the other parameters remained within the specification 
acceptance criteria. Therefore, it is concluded that no in-use shelf life is warranted to be defined in line 
with the authorised strengths.
Forced degradation studies were performed on the 7.5 mg strength because they represent the worst 
case in terms of drug loading. Samples were exposed to heat, heat/humidity, light, hydrolysis 
(exposure to acid and base in conjunction with heat) and oxidation (exposure to hydrogen peroxide 
and Iron (III)). Following exposure to each stress condition, the samples were analysed for assay and 
impurities. At each stress condition, the degradation products were separated from the upadacitinib 
peak. The forced degradation data indicate that the method is stability indicating.
In a temperature cycling study no meaningful changes were observed for description, degradation 
products, assay, and dissolution data during the 35 day temperature cycling period (2 batches stored 
in blister and bottle). Based on the stability data, temperature cycling of -20°C for 15 days, and 50°C 
for 15 days is justified for Rinvoq tablets stored in blisters and bottles with desiccant.
Based on the overall data presented, a shelf life of 2 years for tablets stored in blisters and bottles with 
desiccant without any special temperature storage conditions but with the precaution “Store in the 
original blister or bottle in order to protect from moisture. Keep the bottle tightly closed.” as per SmPC 
sections 6.3 and 6.4, are acceptable. 
2.4.3.4.  Adventitious agents
No excipient or materials of animal or human origin are used. Magnesium stearate are derived from 
vegetable source.
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects
The active substance information was assessed and found acceptable in the initial MAA application for 
Rinvoq 15 mg prolonged-release tablets (EMEA/H/C/004760). No new information is provided for the 
current application. 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 17/195
Information on development, manufacture and control of the finished product has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner. The new strength of 45 mg prolonged-release film-coated tablets is introduced to 
support a new indication. The new strength was developed based upon the already approved 15 mg 
and 30 mg tablets (and the lower not marketed strength of 7.5 mg). Extensive development 
information was provided about all three strengths (7.5 mg 15 mg and 30 mg) of Rinvoq prolonged-
release tablets. The information specific for the 45 mg tablets has been assessed in the current 
procedure and found satisfactory. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product 
should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The applicant has applied QbD 
principles in the development of the finished product and their manufacturing process. Design spaces 
have been proposed for two steps in the manufacture of the finished product (granulation and 
coating). The design spaces have been adequately verified.
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development
None. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects
2.5.1.  Introduction
No new non-clinical studies were submitted which was considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.5.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
The MAH has provided an ERA, but no new data for the environmental risk assessment were included 
with this application. The submitted ERA was updated from the original ERA submitted for the MAA for 
RA approval, and the updates to support the indications psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and 
atopic dermatitis.
In the original ERA the results of the Phase I assessment triggered a Phase II Tier A assessment and 
the standard suite of fate and effect studies were completed.
Upadacitinib is very persistent in sediment according to the OECD 308 study. A Phase II Tier B 
extended effects on water sediment was thus triggered.
Phase I
The maximum daily dose for the indication UC is 45 mg/day, resulting in PECSURFACEWATER values of 
0.225 µg/L, for each of the indications RA, PsA and AS, with the maximum daily dose of 15 mg/day, 
the PECSURFACEWATER values was 0.075 µg/L and for the indication AD with the maximum daily dose of 15 
mg/day, the PECSURFACEWATER values was 0.15 µg/L, when using the default Fpen value of 0.01.
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 18/195
A PECSW-TOTAL was calculated (0.6 µg/L) and was used to re-calculate the Phase II Tier A and Tier B 
PEC/PNEC ratios. 
The Log Pow and Log D were 2.50 (pH 7) using the shake flask method (OECD 107). Since the values 
were below the criteria of 3 no PBT assessment was needed.
Phase II
For this application, the same PNEC values were presented as for the original ERA submitted for the 
MAA. In the table below the updated PEC/PNEC ratios are presented, based on the PEC value obtained 
for all five indications. These ratios remain far below 0.1, and the conclusion remains: The clinical use 
of upadacitinib is not expected to be a risk for the environment.
The PEC values in relevant environmental compartments are compared to the PNEC values for these 
compartments by calculation of PEC/PNEC ratios.

2.5.3.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects
The non-clinical aspects of upadacitinib were thoroughly evaluated during the original approval 
procedure for Rinvoq. No new non-clinical studies were submitted in support of the present application 
which was considered acceptable to the CHMP.
Section 5.3 of the SmPC was updated in line with the SmPC guideline to limit the information to the 
findings.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics
The characterization of upadacitinib pharmacokinetics after single and multiple doses, absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) characteristics, drug-drug interaction potential, and 
pharmacokinetics in special populations were included in the regulatory submission dossier for the use 
of upadacitinib in the treatment of RA. To support the PK information in this application the MAH has 
provided a BA-study and a cocktail DDI study using multiple doses of 45 mg upadacitinib. Further a 
level A IVIVC has been submitted. Data from the Phase 2b and 3 studies (Studies M14-234 and M14-
675) were utilized to characterize upadacitinib pharmacokinetics (popPK) and exposure-response 
relationships in subjects with UC.
Population pharmacokinetic analysis
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 20/195
Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using data from Studies M14-234 SS1, M14-234 
SS2, and M14-675 for Induction. The model was developed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling 
approach in NONMEM 7.4.4. A total of 525 of these records (3.6%) were below the LLOQ. Given the 
small fraction of concentrations below the LLOQ, the M5 imputation method was used by imputing BLQ 
concentrations with LLOQ/2. The first LLOQ/2 after last dose was included in the analysis, while the 
rest were excluded. Additional 4.5% of data were excluded after applying the pre-decided exclusion 
rules. All concentrations greater than the computed upper limit or below the computed lower limit were 
flagged as outlier concentrations and thus excluded from the analysis dataset (4.3%). 
Statistically significant covariates identified in the previous model (subject population [HV versus 
AD/UC/CD and RA versus AD/CD/UC], creatinine clearance, and sex on apparent oral clearance  
(CL/F), and sex and body weight on apparent volume of distribution of central compartment (Vc/F) 
were retained as the basis for the current model development. The effect of additional covariates on 
upadacitinib pharmacokinetics was evaluated using the stepwise forward inclusion backward 
elimination approach. All model parameters, including covariate effects, from the original model were 
re-estimated based on the data included in the current analysis. Standard model evaluation and 
qualification methods were used, i.e. graphical and numerical methods to assess model goodness of-
fit.
The final model was a two-compartment model with first-order absorption with lag time for the IR 
formulation, mixed zero- and first-order absorption with lag time for the ER formulation and linear 
elimination adequately described upadacitinib plasma concentration-time profiles. The final parameter 
estimates are presented in Table 1. The inter-subject variability for upadacitinib CL/F and apparent 
volume of distribution of the central compartment (Vc/F) were 35% and 27% respectively. Shrinkage 
on CL/F, Vc/F, Extended-Release KA and Immediate-Release KA were 16%, 43%, 59% and 62%, 
respectively. Statistically significant covariates that were included in the final model were creatinine 
clearance, RA, HV, sex and AST on CL/F; and sex and body weight on Vc/F. Baseline UC disease 
severity and UC-specific concomitant medications demonstrated negligible impact on upadacitinib 
pharmacokinetics. Upadacitinib plasma exposures were comparable between Japanese and non-
Japanese subjects with UC. The Visual Predictive Checks (VPCs) of Upadacitinib Concentration in 
Subjects with UC (Studies M14-234 and M14-675) Stratified by Dose Group is shown in Figure 2. 
To evaluate the consistency of upadacitinib pharmacokinetics between induction and maintenance 
treatment in UC the developed model was used to describe observed upadacitinib plasma 
concentrations from Phase 3 Study M14-234 SS3 using a post hoc approach (Figure 3). Population 
parameter estimates of the fixed effects and estimates for the random effects (inter-individual 
variability) of this previously established population pharmacokinetic model were used to generate 
individual post hoc estimates for subjects from the Phase 3 Study M14-234 SS3. Model parameters 
were not re-estimated.

IVIVC
A linear IVIVC model was established using in vivo and in vitro data for the 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg 
tablet formulations as well as variants of the 30 mg tablet formulations with different in vitro release 
rate. The model showed acceptable predictability and predicted the plasma concentration-time curves 
well. Furthermore, internal and external validation resulted in prediction errors within the acceptance 
criteria defined in the EMA guideline. The developed IVIVC was used to predict upadacitinib plasma 
exposures following the administration of the planned 45 mg strength commercial and the phase 3 
formulations. There are issues raised regarding the IVIVC from a quality perspective.
Bioequivalence
Study M19-376 was a Phase 1 single-dose, open-label, randomized, four-period, four-sequence, 
crossover design to assess the bioavailability of upadacitinib 45 mg commercial formulation (ER19) 
relative to the reference 45 mg Phase 3 formulation (ER19P). The study also characterized the effect of 
a high-fat/high-calorie meal on upadacitinib 45 mg commercial formulation. 
65 subjects completed the study. Three subjects had upadacitinib plasma concentrations that were 
below or close to the LLOQ at all time points during one or more study periods. Thorough investigation 
was conducted for the records for Study M19-376 related to clinical operation, drug supply, drug 
dispensing, monitoring, adverse events, sample collection, sample analysis but no recording could 
explain the aberrant concentrations in these individuals. Results from both excluding and including 
outlier observations from the three subjects are presented. Primary results driving the conclusion are 
based on the analyses excluding the outlier observations.

Study M19-376 also evaluated the effect of food on the commercial formulation of the 45 mg strength. 
The outliers discussed above are excluded in the data presented below.
Table 4 Excluding outlier data from three subjects: bioavailability of upadacitinib 45 mg market-image 
formulation under fasting or fed conditions
The effect of food on other strengths of the ER-formulation has been investigated previously. 
Coadministration of upadacitinib with a high-fat/high-calorie meal increased upadacitinib AUCinf by 
approximately 30% and Cmax by 18% to 60% across the different studies and strengths. Upadacitinib 
15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg strength tablets were administered in UC Phase 3 studies without regard to 
food.
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies
Study M19-139 evaluated the effect of repeated doses of upadacitinib 45 mg QD ER on the 
pharmacokinetics of sensitive probe substrates of different CYP enzymes. This was a cocktail drug 
interaction study similar in design as the cocktail study performed for the initial MAA in RA. 20 healthy 
adults were enrolled and 19 subjects completed the study.
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 24/195
 
Overall, administration of upadacitinib 45 mg QD doses resulted in only a limited effect on midazolam, 
a sensitive CYP3A substrate, exposures (approximately 25% decrease in Cmax and AUC) and 
dextromethorphan, a sensitive CYP2D6 substrate, exposures (35% increase in AUC and 30% increase 
in Cmax).  Upadacitinib 45 mg QD had no relevant effects on the sensitive probe substrates/markers 
for CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. These results are in line with those obtained for 30 mg Upadacitinib 
in the original application, only for CYP2D6 are the point estimates higher for 45 mg. However, the 
magnitude of the observed effect is within the typical range of intra-subject variability in CYP2D6 drug 
substrates (~40%).
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics
Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics-Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) 
Upadacitinib exposure-response relationships for efficacy and safety parameters were evaluated using 
quartile plots and logistic regression analyses. Upadacitinib doses of 7.5, 15, 30 and 45 mg were 
included in the analyses for the induction phase and 7.5, 15 and 30 mg for the maintenance phase. 
Non-linear and linear logistic regression analyses for the efficacy and safety parameters were 
evaluated to characterize the relationship between upadacitinib Cavg (the predicted average 
concentration in subject i, based on the population pharmacokinetic model) as a predictor variable and 
the different endpoints as binary variables. The covariates were investigated in the exposure-response 
analyses in an exploratory fashion by adding each covariate to the primary model and evaluating the 
impact on the coefficient estimate for upadacitinib effect in the model.
Relationship between exposure and efficacy
The week 8 efficacy endpoints were clinical remission per Adapted Mayo score, clinical Response per 
Adapted Mayo score, endoscopic improvement, endoscopic remission. There was an incremental 
increase in efficacy with increasing upadacitinib plasma exposures up to Cavg of ~40 ng/mL. Maximal 
upadacitinib efficacy appeared to be approached at approximately Cavg of 40 ng/mL, which is 
approximately equivalent to the median Cavg for 45 mg QD.  Biologic therapy-intolerant or inadequate 
responder (Bio-IR) status, baseline corticosteroid use, baseline Adapted Mayo Score and study effect 
were accounted for in the models. Statistically significant exposure-response relationships with 
upadacitinib Cavg were observed for all evaluated efficacy endpoints. Based on the exposure-response 
models, upadacitinib 45 mg QD is predicted to result in 3% to 5% greater percentage of subjects 
achieving the different evaluated efficacy endpoints compared to a 30 mg QD regimen using the 
extended-release formulation; the higher efficacy of 45 mg QD compared to lower doses (e.g., 30 mg 
QD) was consistent across both bio-IR and non-bio-IR populations.
Week 52 exposure-response models were developed to describe the observed increase in percentage 
of subjects achieving clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, histo-endoscopic mucosal 
improvement, or steroid-free clinical remission with increasing upadacitinib concentrations. Across 
these efficacy endpoints, model-predicted response rates demonstrated 8% to 10% greater efficacy 
with the upadacitinib 30 mg dose compared to 15 mg. No exposure-response relationship beyond 
treatment effect was identified for endoscopic remission. 
Clinical remission status per Adapted Mayo score at Week 0 was a statistically significant factor for all 
endpoints and age was a statistically significant covariate for clinical remission per Adapted Mayo score 
and steroid-free clinical remission.  However, neither of the two covariates (Bio-IR and Corticosteroid 
Use at Week 0 ) had a statistically significant interaction with the upadacitinib exposure effect in any of 
the evaluated endpoints, indicating consistency of upadacitinib efficacy exposure-response 
relationships at Week 52 across the different patient subgroups.

Relationship between exposure and safety
No events occurred for lymphopenia ≥ Grade 4 and neutropenia ≥ Grade 4 at Week 8 (LOCF), 
therefore no analysis was performed. For lymphopenia ≥ Grade 3 (Week 8; LOCF), neutropenia ≥ 
Grade 3 (Week 8; LOCF), hemoglobin < 8 g/dL (Week 8; LOCF), Herpes Zoster infections (anytime up 
to Week 8) and pneumonia (anytime up to Week 8), there were no more than 10 events, therefore no 
further analysis beyond quartile plots was performed. The exposure-response quartile plots for the 
percentage of subjects who experienced the different safety endpoints versus maximum upadacitinib 
concentration showed no trend.
Week 8 exposure safety models were developed for the endpoints hemoglobin (2 g/dL decrease from 
baseline, 2 g/dL decrease from baseline and less LLN, < 8 g/dL) and serious infections. No trend for 
exposure-response relationships was observed between upadacitinib average concentrations and any 
of the evaluated safety endpoints at Week 8, indicating that increasing upadacitinib plasma exposures 
(within the 7.5 mg to 45 mg extended-release exposure range) is not associated with a significant 
increase in any of the evaluated safety endpoints the first 8 weeks. The exposure-response quartile 
plots for the percentage of subjects who experienced the different safety endpoints versus maximum 
upadacitinib concentration showed no trend.
At week 52, no events had occurred for neutropenia ≥ Grade 3, lymphopenia ≥ Grade 4 and 
neutropenia ≥ Grade 4, therefore no analysis was performed for these endpoints. The incidence of the 
evaluated safety endpoints (> 2 g/dL Decrease in Hemoglobin, herpes zoster infections, serious 
infections) was generally low and none of the endpoints showed trends for exposure-dependent 
increases with increasing upadacitinib average concentrations.
Relationship between exposure and effects on QT Interval 
The relationship between QT interval prolongation for upadacitinib was investigated through exposure-
response analyses of data from single (1-48 mg) and multiple ascending (3-24 mg) dose Phase 1 
studies, previously submitted in the original regulatory application for upadacitinib in RA 
(R&D/17/1139).  
The range of upadacitinib exposures evaluated in the QT exposure-response analyses were compared

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
Population PK analysis
The MAH has conducted population pharmacokinetic (popPK) and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic 
(PKPD) analyses of Upadacitinib in subjects with RA, CD, UC or AD. The popPK analysis dataset 
included data from the UC studies M14-234 and M14-675, and data from other studies (RA, CD, AD 
studies and studies in healthy subjects). 
A total of 525 of these records (3.6%) were below the LLOQ. Given the small fraction of concentrations 
below the LLOQ, the M5 imputation method was used by imputing BLQ concentrations with LLOQ/2. 
The first LLOQ/2 after last dose was included in the analysis, while the rest were excluded. This is 
acceptable. All concentrations greater than the computed upper limit or below the computed lower limit 
were flagged as outlier concentrations and thus excluded from the analysis dataset (4.3%). At total of 
3.1% and 5.7% of the concentrations below and above the upper limit, respectively, were excluded for 
the UC population within the population PK analysis dataset. The UC population constituted 50.8% of 
the total dataset including all populations (HV 9.2%, RA 24.1%, CD 9.3%, and AD 6.5%), whereof 
78.8% (40% of total dataset) received 45 mg induction dose. Based on the high number of subjects 
with UC included in the dataset, and that the percentage of excluded data is similar between the 
populations, while the exclusion is not agreed with the issue is not pursued further. In addition, the 
final parameters did not change drastically when the final model was rerun on the full dataset including 
the outliers. 
The MAH has used popPK analysis to support the dose selection and to simulate exposures (Caverage) 
to be used in PKPD analysis. Standard model evaluation and qualification methods were used, i.e., 
graphical and numerical methods to assess model goodness of-fit. Presented prediction corrected VPCs 
were stratified on induction dose group, maintenance dose group and indication and formula. The 
figures demonstrate that the model can describe all data adequately.
The final model was a two-compartment model with first-order absorption with lag time for the IR 
formulation, mixed zero- and first-order absorption with lag time for the ER formulation and linear 
elimination. The model adequately described upadacitinib plasma concentration-time profiles. The 
inter-subject variability for upadacitinib CL/F and apparent volume of distribution of the central 
compartment (Vc/F) were 35% and 27% respectively. The shrinkage was high for Vc/F, ER-KA and IR-
KA (43%, 59% and 62%, respectively). Statistically significant covariates that were included in the 
final model were CrCL, RA, HV, sex and AST on CL/F; and sex and body weight on Vc/F. Upadacitinib 
plasma exposures were comparable between Japanese and non-Japanese subjects with UC. The 
goodness-of-fit plots of the final population pharmacokinetic model for subjects with moderate to 
severely active UC indicate some trends in the individual predicted versus observed concentration. At 
the CHMP’s request, the Visual Predictive Checks (VPCs) of Upadacitinib Concentration in Subjects with 
UC (Studies M14-234 and M14-675) were provided and the CHMP considered that they were 
acceptable. 
The pharmacokinetic model was used to describe observed upadacitinib plasma concentrations from 
Phase 3 Study M14-234 SS3 (maintenance phase) using a post hoc approach. Trendlines are missing 
in the GOF plots. There appears to be a small trend in observed vs predicted concentrations. Figures of 
dose normalised observed concentrations in subjects with UC (including SS3 data) vs other indications, 
and a table of predicted Cmin, Cmax and Caverage across the different indications and doses indicates 
that the exposure in the UC population is similar to the exposure in other populations.

Absorption
The study M19-376 design is appropriate, given a half-life of 9-14 hours the washout is sufficient. 
Upadacitinib does not accumulate significantly, and it has in previous applications (see initial marketing 
authorisation application for discussion) been concluded that no multiple dose BE-study is necessary. 
Three (3) subjects had upadacitinib plasma concentrations close to zero at all timepoints in one or 
several different periods of the study. The MAH has thoroughly investigated the cause of this, but no 
recording could explain the aberrant results. According to the Guideline on investigation of 
bioequivalence exclusion of data could be allowed for a subject with lack of any measurable 
concentrations or only very low plasma concentrations for reference medicinal product. In this case 
there is no approved reference product; however, the phase-3 formulation is supported by clinical data 
and hence the reference product in this setting. However, there are results close to zero for both 
formulations and the MAH has omitted all these data from the main statistical analysis. In the main 
analysis, results are within BE criteria. With all subjects included, results are not within BE criteria. No 
analysis has been presented where only subjects with low concentrations of the phase 3 formulation 
are excluded. However, the phase-3 and commercial formulation differ only in colour, the core 
composition is the same. Thus, there is no obvious reason why the two formulations would not be 
bioequivalent. In this particular case the cause of the very low concentrations in three subjects is no 
concern needed to pursue further and the commercial formulation is considered to achieve similar 
exposure of upadacitinib as the phase-3 formulation. This is further supported by the IVIVC predicted 
exposures.
The effect of food on the commercial 45 mg strength has been investigated. The effect on AUC was in 
line with previous results for other formulations and strength while the effect on Cmax was higher than 
previous results. Also this analysis is affected by the exclusion of outlier-data. The analysis including all 
data reveals a lesser effect of food on both Cmax and AUC. Section 5.2 of the SmPC has been updated 
with the results from the analysis with excluded data, which is the “worst” scenario. Even with this 
larger effect of food, especially on Cmax, it is agreed that no food restriction is necessary.
DDI
The interaction potential of the 45 mg dose has been appropriately evaluated. A clinical cocktail DDI 
study has been performed with substrates for the main CYPs and other relevant interactions has been 
adequately discussed in the provided documentation.
Compared to the 30 mg dose evaluated for DDI potential in the original MAA, the only difference is 
that the 45 mg dose is a mild inhibitor of CYP2D6. 
Section 4.5 of the SmPC has been updated as follows: “Administration of multiple 45 mg once daily 
doses of upadacitinib to healthy subjects led to a limited increase in AUC and Cmax of 
dextromethorphan (sensitive CYP2D6 substrate) by 30% and 35%, respectively, indicating that 
upadacitinib 45 mg once daily has a weak inhibitory effect on CYP2D6. No dose adjustment is 
recommended for CYP3A substrates, CYP2D6 substrates, rosuvastatin or atorvastatin when 
coadministered with upadacitinib.”
Upadacitinib exposure is increased when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, and clarithromycin). Sections 4.2 and 4.5 of 
the SmPC have been updated to reflect that for patients with ulcerative colitis using strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors, the recommended induction dose is 30 mg once daily (for up to 16 weeks) and the 
recommended maintenance dose is 15 mg once daily.

EMA/575056/2022 
Page 28/195
PK/PD
The exposure-response relationships for upadacitinib efficacy and safety following 8 and 52 weeks of 
treatment were evaluated in subjects with moderately to severely active UC using data from the Phase 
2b Study M14-234 SS1, the Phase 3 Study M14-234 SS2, Phase 3 Study M14-675 and Study M14-234 
SS3. Upadacitinib doses of 7.5, 15, 30 and 45 mg were included in the analyses for the induction 
phase and 7.5, 15 and 30 mg for the maintenance phase. 
For both week 8 and week 52 exposure-efficacy analyses, the predicted percentage of subjects 
achieving clinical endpoints (improvement and remission) increased with increasing upadacitinib 
plasma exposures while no clear trend was observed for exposure-safety relationships, indicating that 
safety events did not increase with increasing upadacitinib plasma exposures. Overall results indicate 
that upadacitinib plasma exposures associated with the 45 mg QD regimen achieves therapeutic 
benefit at Week 8 without a clear trend for increase in safety events. 
This support the dosing recommendation in Section 4.2 of the SmPC: The recommended induction 
dose of upadacitinib is 45 mg once daily for 8 weeks. See also discussions in 2.6.6. 
Relationship between exposure and effects on QT Interval 
The exposure-QTcF analysis submitted in the original regulatory application for upadacitinib in RA 
(R&D/17/1139) was based on data form SAD and MAD studies where doses up to 48 mg Upadacitinib 
IR tablet was given. The mean Cmax with a 48 mg IR tablet was 314 ng/mL, which is approximately 
2.5-fold higher compared to the mean Cmax,ss in UC patients receiving 45 mg ER QD (126 ng/mL). In 
the concentration-QTc analysis, the upper bound of the 2-sided 90% confidence interval of the 
predicted ΔΔQTcF was below 3.33 msec for the highest exposure level which is below the upper cut-off 
of 10 msec. Subsequently it is concluded that upatacitinib has no clinically relevant effect on the QT 
interval at exposures reached with 45 mg QD ER-tablet treatment. However, subjects with moderate 
HI are expected to have a on average 43% higher Cmax, limiting the concentration-QTc analysis with 
regards to the covered exposure range, prohibiting a conclusion based on only this analysis for this 
subpopulation (see Clinical Safety section). 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
Relevant PK-studies have been provided in support of this submission. The pharmacokinetics of 
upadacitinib in subjects with UC is adequately described by the population PK model and indicates that 
the exposure in the UC population is similar to the exposure in other populations.
The CHMP concluded that the clinical pharmacology data was adequate to support the new strength of 
45mg and the new indication in the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active 
ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response, lost response or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a biologic agent. The SmPC has been updated with the new pharmacology 
information.

Substudy 1 Design Schematic – Actual Numbers Enrolled and Dosed
Approximately 250 subjects were planned to be randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to the placebo group and 4 
upadacitinib doses. Randomization was stratified by previous biologic therapy use (yes/no), 
Baseline corticosteroid use (yes/no), and Baseline Adapted Mayo score (≤ 7 or > 7).  
Approximately 75% of subjects enrolled in Substudy 1 were bio-IR and 25% of subjects 
were non-bio-IR.  Bio-IR is defined as subjects who had inadequate response, loss of 
response, or intolerance to biologic therapy.  Non-bio-IR is defined as subjects who had 
inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to conventional therapy but had not 
failed biologic therapy. The study duration included a Screening Period of up to 5 weeks and an 8-week 
double-blind (DB) Induction Period.
During the analysis period, when the first 250 randomized subjects completed the study, 132 
additional subjects were randomized into Groups 3 and 4 of Substudy 1 (upadacitinib 30 mg and 45 
mg dose groups; approximately 66 subjects per dose group).  The objectives of enrolling these 
additional subjects were to avoid interrupting the study activities during the analysis period and to 
support a sufficient number of subjects with clinical response to be re-randomized into the 
maintenance portion in Substudy 3.
Study participants
Subjects enrolled in this study were between 16 and 75 years old who have been inadequate 
responders or intolerant to immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, and/or biologic therapies. Subjects 
enrolled had a diagnosis of UC for 90 days prior to Baseline, confirmed by colonoscopy 
during the Screening Period, with exclusion of current infection, colonic dysplasia and/or 
malignancy.  Eligible study subjects must have had an Adapted Mayo score of 5 to 9 
points and endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3.  During the time that subjects were enrolled in 
Substudy 1, the eligibility criteria included subjects age 18 to 75 years.
Treatments:
Subjects were assigned to 1 of 5 groups and received 2 tablets of blinded 
study drug daily:  2 placebo tablets; or 1 upadacitinib 7.5, 15, or 30 mg tablet + placebo

tablet; or 1 upadacitinib 30 mg tablet + 15 mg tablet (subjects in the upadacitinib 45 mg 
group).
Objectives and endpoints
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved clinical remission per Adapted Mayo 
score (defined as SFS ≤ 1, RBS of 0, and endoscopic subscore ≤ 1) at Week 8.
Ranked secondary efficacy variables were:
1. Proportion of subjects with endoscopic improvement (defined as an endoscopic 
subscore ≤ 1) at Week 8
2. Proportion of subjects achieving clinical remission per Full Mayo score (defined as 
a Full Mayo score ≤ 2 with no subscore > 1) at Week 8
3. Proportion of subjects achieving clinical response per Adapted Mayo score 
(defined as decrease from Baseline in the Adapted Mayo score ≥ 2 points and 
≥ 30% from Baseline, PLUS a decrease in RBS ≥ 1 or an absolute RBS ≤ 1) at 
Week 8
4. Proportion of subjects achieving clinical response per Partial Mayo score (using the 
Mayo Scoring System for Assessment of Ulcerative Colitis Activity, excluding 
endoscopic subscore; clinical response defined as decrease from Baseline in the 
Partial Mayo score ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from Baseline, PLUS a decrease in 
RBS ≥ 1 or an absolute RBS ≤ 1) at Week 2
5. Change in Full Mayo score from Baseline to Week 8
6. Proportion of subjects with endoscopic remission (defined as an endoscopic 
subscore of 0) at Week 8
7. Proportion of subjects who achieved histologic improvement (defined as decrease

Disposition of Subjects
Substudy 1 main subjects (intent-to-treat [ITT] 1A Population) are defined as those first randomized 
250 subjects who completed the 8-week induction.  Substudy 1 additional subjects (ITT1B Population) 
are defined as any subject who was randomized after the main subjects.
250 subjects were planned to be randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to the placebo and upadacitinib groups in the 
main subject group; 250 subjects were actually randomized, with approximately 50 subjects per 
group.  Totals for the upadacitinib 30 and 45 mg groups in the main subject group included 12 subjects 
who were randomized with only 2 options (upadacitinib 30 mg or 45 mg) due to an error.
One hundred additional subjects were planned (50 subjects each in the upadacitinib 30 [Group 3] and 
45 mg [Group 4] groups), and 132 additional subjects were actually randomized to receive 
upadacitinib 30 or 45 mg after the original 250 subjects were enrolled.

After all randomized subjects completed the 8-week induction, a dose-selection analysis 
of efficacy and safety (selected laboratory parameters) of upadacitinib versus placebo was 
performed.  Based on this dose-selection analysis, one induction dose (upadacitinib 
45 mg) was identified for further evaluation in Substudy 2 and a second Phase 3 induction 
study, Study M14-675.  The results of this analysis were reviewed and discussed with 
regulatory authorities, as applicable, prior to initiation of enrollment of subjects in 
Substudy 2 and/or Study M14-675.

M14-234 Substudy 2 and Study M14-675 was a two-part Phase 3 dose-confirming studies designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral administration of upadacitinib 45 mg compared to placebo as 
induction therapy for up to 16 weeks in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. The study 
included a Screening Period of up to 5 weeks, Part 1, and Part 2. In Part 1 subjects were randomized 
2:1 to double-blind (DB) upadacitinib or matching placebo for an 8-week induction period.  
Randomization was stratified by bio-IR status (bio-IR vs non-bio-IR), corticosteroid use (yes or no), 
and Adapted Mayo score (≤ 7 or > 7) at Baseline. Within bio-IR, the randomization was further 
stratified by number of prior biologic treatments (≤ 1 or > 1).  Within non-bio-IR, the randomization 
was further stratified by previous biologic use (yes or no).  
Subjects who did not achieve clinical response per Adapted Mayo score at Week 8 in Part 1 could 
continue in Part 2. Part 2 was an open-label, 8-week extended treatment period for clinical non-
responders from Part 1.

Study M14-234 Substudy 3 is a Phase 3 maintenance study designed to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of upadacitinib 15 and 30 mg QD compared to placebo in achieving 
clinical remission per Adapted Mayo score in subjects with moderately to severely active 
UC who achieved clinical response per Adapted Mayo score following induction therapy 
from Study M14-234 Substudy 1, Substudy 2, or Study M14-675.  
The only eligibility check required for a subject to enter Study M14-234 Substudy 3 was to have 
achieved clinical response at Week 8 or 16 of Induction Study and not to meet any study 
discontinuation criteria. Clinical response per Adapted Mayo score is defined as a decrease from 
baseline in the Adapted Mayo score ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from baseline, PLUS a decrease in RBS ≥ 1 
or an absolute RBS ≤ 1. The Baseline Visit of Substudy 3 was to be completed on the same day as the 
final visit in the Induction Phase (either at Week 8 or Week 16) for subjects who were eligible. 
The treatment assignment in Substudy 3 depended on the treatment received in Substudy 1, Substudy 
2, or Study M14-675, as detailed below.
Cohort 1:  847 subjects who achieved clinical response in Study M14-234 Substudy1, Substudy 2, or 
Study M14-675 at either Week 8 or Week 16, and received 1 of the following treatments were re-

Absolute lymphocytes count < 750/μL; Hemoglobin < 9 g/dL
Treatments
Induction studies:
Study drug was to be taken orally once daily with or without food at approximately the 
same time each day, beginning at the Baseline Visit. All subjects received 1 tablet daily.  
In Part 1, subjects received 1 tablet of upadacitinib 45 mg or matching placebo; treatment assignment 
was blinded.  
In Part 2, subjects received 1 tablet open-label upadacitinib 45 mg beginning on Day 1 (Entry of Part 
2)
Allowed concomitant UC-related medication Oral Corticosteroids, Antibiotics, Aminosalicylates, and/or 
Methotrexate
In maintenance study patients received Upadacitinib 15 mg, 30 mg or placebo. A small number of 
patients continued on 7.5 mg, but these patients were not included in the main analysis.
Rescue therapy and steroid tapering
At or after Week 4 in Substudy 3 maintenance period, subjects who demonstrate loss of response and 
require medical treatment but have not yet met the criteria to enter Study M14-533 Cohort 1, may 
receive rescue therapy. Rescue therapy may be provided in the form of initiation or increased dosage, 
at the investigator's discretion, of any allowed UC-related medications to treat new or worsening UC 
symptoms.  The allowed UC-related medications are locally acting, oral, or intravenous corticosteroids, 
aminosalicylates, MTX or UC-related antibiotics. Azathioprine (AZA), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), 
cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and thalidomide are prohibited medications during the study and could not be 
used as rescue treatment
  At baseline, (week 8 or week 16 of Substudy 1, 2, or Study M14-675) subjects who are taking 
corticosteroid had their corticosteroid dose tapered had their corticosteroid dose 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 43/195
tapered according to the following proposed schedule or based on investigators' 
discretion:
Table 11 Corticosteroid Dose Taper
If a subject should experience worsening of disease during the corticosteroid taper, the 
subject may have their corticosteroid dose increased, per the investigator's discretion 
during the study.  Subjects in whom the maximum steroid dose equivalent exceeds the 
dose used at Baseline will be considered non-responders and will be censored for efficacy 
assessments from that point forward through the end of the study.  These subjects will 
continue to be evaluated in the safety analysis set.

Per Partial Adapted Mayo score:  decrease from Baseline ≥ 1 points and ≥ 30% from Baseline, plus a 
decrease in RBS ≥ 1 or an absolute RBS ≤ 1
Endoscopic and histologic assessments were centrally read by external physicians who 
were not study investigators
Geboes Index:  A common histologic index for UC composed of 7 categories.
Qualitative UC histological assessment of acute inflammation and chronicity was 
performed using Geboes histologic activity score (Geboes 2000).  Grade 0 indicates 
structural change only; Grade 1 indicates chronic inflammation; Grade 2 indicates a 
finding of lamina propria neutrophils; Grade 3 indicates finding of neutrophils in 
epithelium; Grade 4 indicates crypt destruction; and Grade 5 indicates erosions or ulcers.
Endoscopy:  Based on Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0-3 where 0 = normal or inactive 
disease; 1 = mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern); 2 = moderate disease 
(marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, any friability, erosions); 3 = severe disease 
(spontaneous bleeding, ulceration).  Evidence of friability during endoscopy in subjects 
with otherwise "mild" endoscopic activity conferred an endoscopic subscore of 2.
The endoscopic and histologic endpoint definitions for these efficacy variables were:
Endoscopic remission:  Endoscopic subscore of 0
Endoscopic improvement:  Endoscopic subscore ≤ 1
Histologic improvement:  Decrease from Baseline in Geboes score
Histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement:  Endoscopic subscore ≤ 1 and Geboes 
score ≤ 3.1
Mucosal healing:  Endoscopic score = 0 and Geboes score < 2.
Symptoms
Abdominal Pain:  Abdominal pain is a scale of measures with response options: 0 = no 
abdominal pain, 1 = mild (aware but tolerable), 2 = moderate (interferes with usual 
activity), 3 = severe (intolerable) and a recall period of 24 hours.
Bowel Urgency:  Bowel urgency is an item with response option of Yes or No for feeling 
the need for a bowel movement and having to rush to the toilet to avoid an accident, and a 
recall period of 24 hours.
Sample size
Induction study M14-675 and M14-234 substudy 2
For each of the Induction Studies, approximately 462 subjects are expected to be randomized to 
upadacitinib 45 mg QD or placebo in a randomization ratio of 2:1. The sample size for this study is 
based on the expected proportion of subjects who achieve clinical remission per Adapted Mayo score at 
Week 8. Based on the results from Phase 2b upadacitinib Study M14-234 (Substudy 1), clinical 
remission rate is assumed to be 5% in the placebo group and 18% in the upadacitinib 45 mg QD 
treatment group. Based on these assumptions, a sample size of 154 subjects in placebo and 308 
subjects in upadacitinib dose will have > 95% power to detect the 13% treatment difference in the 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 47/195
primary endpoint between upadacitinib 45 mg QD group and placebo group using two-sided Fisher's 
exact test at a 0.05 significant level.
Maintenance study M14-234 substudy 3
The sample size for the Maintenance Study is based on the expected proportion of subjects who 
achieve clinical remission per Adapted Mayo score at Week 52. The assumptions of clinical remission 
rates were based on the historical data from other compounds with similar or different MOAs.  In 
vedolizumab Phase 3 UC study, the clinical remission rate was 16% in placebo group and 42% in 
treatment group. In tofacitinib Phase 3 UC study, the clinical remission rate was 11.1% in placebo 
group and 40.6% in 10 mg BID treatment group. Considering the factors that may influence the 
clinical remission rate (e.g., differences in MOAs, patient population, and clinical remission definition), 
clinical remission rates are assumed to be 12% in the placebo group and 40% in the upadacitinib 
treatment group at Week 52.
Assuming clinical remission rate of 12% in the placebo group and 40% in one of the upadacitinib QD 
treatment groups at Week 52, a sample size of 150 subjects in placebo and 150 subjects in each of the 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD treatment groups will have > 95% power to detect the 28% 
treatment difference in the primary endpoint between an upadacitinib dose and placebo using two-
sided Fisher's exact test at a 0.025 significant level with multiplicity adjustment. Under the assumption 
that average response rate in upadacitinib doses at the end of induction treatment in the Induction 
Studies is 50%, a total of approximately 450 subjects will be re-randomized to upadacitinib 15 mg QD 
or 30 mg QD treatment groups or placebo in a randomization ratio of 1:1:1 if they achieved clinical 
response from upadacitinib 45 mg QD in the Induction Studies. The assumption of an average 
response rate of 50% in upadacitinib doses after induction is based on the Phase 2b results.
Randomisation and blinding (masking)
Induction study M14-675 and M14-234 substudy 2
Approximately 462 subjects per induction study will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to double-blind 
upadacitinib 45 mg QD or matching placebo for 8 weeks. The randomization will be stratified by bio-IR 
status (bio-IR vs. non-bio-IR), corticosteroid use (yes vs. no) and Adapted Mayo score (≤ 7 vs. > 7) at 
Baseline. Within bio-IR, the randomization will be further stratified by number of prior biologic 
treatments (≤ 1 vs. > 1). Within non-bio-IR, the randomization will be further stratified by previous 
biologic use (yes vs. no). All eligible subjects entering Part 2 will receive open label upadacitinib 45 mg 
QD for an additional 8 weeks (until Week 16).
Treatment assignments of induction will be unblinded to AbbVie for statistical analyses when all 
subjects have completed the induction study. The study sites and subjects will remain blinded to the 
double-blind induction treatment assignments until all subjects have completed the Maintenance 
Study.
Maintenance study M14-234 substudy 3
Cohort 1: Subjects will be re-randomized to one of the three treatment groups in Cohort 1 
(upadacitinib 15 mg QD, upadacitinib 30 mg QD, or placebo). For subjects who are from Study M14-
234 SS2 or Study M14-675 the randomization will be stratified by Bio-IR status (Bio-IR or Non-Bio-IR) 
at the Baseline of Study M14-234 SS2 or Study M14-675, clinical remission status at Week 0 (yes or 
no) and corticosteroid use at Week 0 (yes or no). For subjects who are from Study M14-234 SS1 the 
randomization will be stratified by previous biologic use (yes or no) at the Baseline of Study M14-234 
SS1 and induction dose received. Approximately 25 subjects who achieved clinical response and 
received double-blind induction treatment of upadacitinib 15 mg QD in Study M14-234 Substudy 1 will 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 48/195
be enrolled in this cohort. These subjects will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive upadacitinib15 
mg QD or placebo QD (Treatment Group 1 or 3). The randomization will be stratified by previous 
biologic use (yes or no) at the Baseline of Study M14-234 Substudy 1.
Cohort 3: Subjects will be re-randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment groups in Cohort 3 (upadacitinib 15 
mg QD and upadacitinib 30 mg QD). Randomization will be stratified by Bio-IR status (Bio-IR or Non-
Bio-IR) at the Baseline of Study M14-234 SS2 or Study M14-675, clinical remission status at Week 0 
(yes or no) and corticosteroid use at Week 0 (yes or no).
Cohort 2 and cohort 4 are non-randomized.
The primary analysis will be performed after the first 450 subjects in the Maintenance Study Cohort 1 
who were upadacitinib 45 mg QD induction responders have completed the Maintenance Study 
activities (i.e., completed Week 52 or prematurely discontinued prior to Week 52) and the database 
has been locked, for the purpose of regulatory submission. This is the only and final analysis for the 
52-week efficacy analyses. Treatment assignments for the Maintenance Study will be unblinded to 
AbbVie for statistical analyses. Additional subjects in any cohort who have not completed the 
Maintenance Study at the time of database lock will be kept on the same blinded treatment until study 
completion. The study sites and subjects will remain blinded to the maintenance treatment 
assignments until all subjects have completed the Maintenance Study. Once all subjects have 
completed the Maintenance Study, the data collected from these subjects will be used to update the 
safety analysis only.
Statistical methods
Induction study M14-675 and M14-234 substudy 2
All efficacy summaries presented for study M14-675 were based on analyses conducted on primary 
efficacy data (version K; interim database lock; 09 February 2021). All efficacy summaries presented 
for Study M14-234 SS2 were based on analyses conducted on primary efficacy data (version S: 
database lock; 25 November 2020). The statistical methods were documented in separate SAPs for 
each of the induction studies, dated 19 January 2021 and 13 November 2020 respectively.
All tests will be at the α level of 0.05 (2-sided). The primary analysis will be performed after all 
ongoing subjects have completed the induction study activities and the database has been locked.
Analysis Populations
Significant non-compliance was identified at a site (Investigator ID 527969). As a result of this finding, 
efficacy data for the subjects enrolled at this investigational site will be excluded from the statistical 
analyses. There were 6 subjects enrolled at this site in study M14-675 and 1 subject in study M14-234 
SS2.
The ITT population for the 8-week double-blind induction period (Part 1) (denoted by ITT1) includes all 
randomized subjects who received at least one dose of double-blinded study drug in Part 1. The ITT1 
population will be used for all efficacy and baseline analyses for Part 1. For ITT1 population, subjects 
will be included in the analysis according to the treatment groups that they are randomized to. The ITT 
population for the 8-week open label extended treatment period (Part 2) (denoted by ITT2) includes all 
subjects who received at least one dose of upadacitinib 45 mg QD in Part 2.
Estimands
The estimand corresponding to the primary efficacy objective is defined as follows:
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 49/195
Difference in the percentage of subjects achieving clinical remission per Adapted Mayo score at Week 8 
regardless of premature discontinuation of study drug and without initiation or dose escalation of UC-
related corticosteroids in the upadacitinib 45 mg QD and placebo groups in the ITT population.
The estimands corresponding to the secondary efficacy objectives are defined for each of the binary 
ranked secondary endpoints as follows: 
Difference in the percentage of subjects achieving binary endpoints regardless of premature 
discontinuation of study drug and without initiation or dose escalation of UC-related corticosteroids in 
the upadacitinib 45 mg QD and placebo groups in the ITT population.
The estimands corresponding to the secondary efficacy objectives are defined for each of the 
continuous ranked secondary endpoints as follows: 
Difference in the mean change from baseline regardless of premature discontinuation of study drug 
and if subjects would not initiate or escalate dose of UC-related corticosteroids in the upadacitinib 45 
mg QD and placebo groups in the ITT population.
Intercurrent events
Potential intercurrent events include 1) premature discontinuation of study drug and 2) initiation or 
dose escalation of UC-related corticosteroids. Intercurrent events will be handled using the following 
methods for the efficacy analysis:
Premature Discontinuation of Study Drug:  Data collected will be used regardless of premature 
discontinuation of study drug.
Initiation or dose escalation of UC-related corticosteroids:  Subjects will be considered as "non-
responder" for binary endpoints at or after the occurrence of the UC-related corticosteroids intercurrent 
event through the end of the Induction Study. For continuous endpoints, all measurements at or after 
the occurrence of the UC-related corticosteroids intercurrent event through the end of the Induction 
Study will not be used in the analysis.
Missing Data
For binary efficacy endpoints, missing data will be handled using the following approaches:
The primary approach for handling missing data in the analysis of binary endpoints will use Non-
Responder Imputation while incorporating Multiple Imputation (MI) to handle missing data due to 
COVID-19 (NRI-C). This includes non-responder imputation at or after the occurrence of UC-related 
corticosteroids intercurrent event.
A sensitivity analysis for categorical endpoints will use NRI with No special data handling for missing 
due to COVID-19 (NRI-NC).
A Sensitivity analysis will be performed using hybrid multiple imputation method (HMI) for the primary 
endpoint. Subjects who discontinue study drug prior to Week 8 due to lack of efficacy or AEs and have 
no available measurements will be considered as "non-responder" for clinical remission. Subjects who 
discontinue for other reasons and have no available measurements will be categorized according to the 
data from multiple imputations.
An As Observed (AO) analysis will also be performed. This analysis will not impute values for missing 
evaluations, and thus a subject who does not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit will be excluded 
from the AO analysis for that visit. AO will include all values collected in the study.
Multiple Imputation (MI) for NRI-C and HMI: PROC MI will be used to generate 30 datasets using the 
regression method. The variables to be included in the imputation model are: treatment group, 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 50/195
stratification factors, Baseline measurement, and if applicable, post-baseline measurements at each 
visit up to the end of the analysis period. The imputed post-baseline measurements will be rounded to 
the same precision as the observed data before the determination of responder status. Subjects will be 
characterized as responders or non-responders based on MI imputed datasets. Note that 
measurements will be set to missing at or after the occurrence of the UC-related corticosteroids 
intercurrent event before applying MI.
For continuous endpoints, missing data will be handled using Mixed-Effect Model Repeat Measurement 
(MMRM). The MMRM will be conducted using mixed model including observed measurements at all 
visits, except that measurements at or after the occurrence of UC-related corticosteroids intercurrent 
event will be excluded.
Efficacy Analyses
Categorical variables will be analyzed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by bio-IR 
status (bio-IR vs. non-bio-IR), Baseline corticosteroid use (yes vs. no) and Baseline Adapted Mayo 
score (≤ 7 vs. > 7). Any subject who was randomized under the wrong stratum will be analyzed 
according to the actual stratum the subject belongs to. Continuous variables collected longitudinally 
will be analyzed using Mixed-Effect Model Repeat Measurement (MMRM) method. Continuous variables 
collected at only one post-baseline visit (such as Mayo score) will be analyzed using an Analysis of 
Covariance (ANCOVA) model.
The primary analysis will compare the proportion of subjects achieving clinical remission in upadacitinib 
treatment group and placebo group in the ITT1 population. The difference between the treatment 
groups in the primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed using the CMH test as specified above and a 
CMH based two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between treatment groups will be 
calculated. For the primary efficacy endpoint, the same CMH analysis will be performed using As 
Observed (AO) data handling without any imputation as an additional analysis. The analysis will be 
conducted on the ITT1 population who have the efficacy measurement at Week 8 visit. Furthermore, a 
supplementary analysis will be conducted to evaluate the potential impact of deviations. In this 
analysis, subjects with deviations that could potentially impact the analysis of primary endpoint will be 
excluded. Treatment difference between upadacitinib 45 mg QD and placebo with point estimate and 
95% CI will be presented using NRI-C approach with the CMH method.
Secondary efficacy endpoints in Part 1 will be analyzed by comparing upadacitinib treatment group and 
placebo group. The binary secondary endpoints will be analyzed by CMH. The NRI-C will be the primary 
approach for missing data handling in the analyses of binary secondary efficacy endpoints. The NRI-NC 
approach will be used as sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, an analysis using As Observed (AO) data 
handling without any imputation will also be performed.
The continuous secondary endpoints will be analyzed by MMRM with an AO analysis as sensitivity 
analysis.
Overall Type-I Error Control
The overall type I error rate of the primary and the ranked secondary endpoints will be strongly 
controlled using the fixed-sequence multiple testing procedure. Specifically, the testing will utilize the 
endpoint sequence of the primary and ranked secondary endpoints in the order specified. The analysis 
for additional efficacy endpoints will be performed at the nominal α level of 0.05 (two-sided).

Analysis populations
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 51/195
Significant non-compliance was identified at an investigational site (original Investigator ID 527969).  
There were 6 subjects enrolled at this site in the Induction Studies who continued into the Maintenance 
Study.  As a result of this finding, efficacy data for these subjects will be excluded from the statistical 
analyses for the Maintenance Study.
The following ITT populations were analyzed in Substudy 3:
ITT population:  All subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Maintenance Study.
ITT_A population:  The subset of ITT population who were the first randomized 451 (actual) 
upadacitinib 45 mg QD 8-week induction responders and who were enrolled under the protocol for 52-
week maintenance treatment period in Cohort 1. The ITT_A population is the primary analysis 
population in Cohort 1 for efficacy endpoints.  The planned number of subjects in the ITT_A population 
was 450; however, the actual number of subjects is 451 due to the tie in enrollment date of subjects 
#450 and #451.
ITT_B population:  The subset of ITT population in Cohort 3 who were upadacitinib 45 mg QD 16-week 
induction responders.
ITT_C population:  The subset of ITT population who were enrolled under the original protocol, 
Amendment 1 or 2 for 44-week maintenance treatment period.
ITT_D population:  The subset of ITT population who were upadacitinib 45 mg QD 8-week induction 
responders and who were enrolled under the protocol for 52-week maintenance treatment period in 
Cohort 1.
ITT_E population:  The subset of ITT who were placebo, upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD, 15 mg QD, or 30 mg 
QD 8-week induction responders and who were enrolled under the protocol for 52-week maintenance 
treatment period.
The above populations were annotated as ITT3, ITT3_A, ITT3_B, ITT3_C, ITT3_D and ITT3_E in the 
protocol.
For ITT populations, subjects were included in the analysis according to the treatment groups that they 
were randomized to, as applicable.
Estimands
The estimand corresponding to the primary efficacy objective is defined as follows:

Intercurrent events
Intercurrent events will be handled using the following methods for the efficacy analysis:
Premature Discontinuation of Study Drug: If the subjects prematurely discontinued study drug but 
stayed in the study, data collected after premature discontinuation of study drug will be used.
Use of UC-related rescue medications (UC-Related corticosteroids or UC-related non-corticosteroid 
rescue medications): For categorical endpoints, subjects will be considered as "non-responder" at or 
after the occurrence of the UC-related rescue medication intercurrent event through the end of the 
Maintenance Study except for the As Observed (AO) analysis.  For continuous endpoints, all 
measurements from the date of UC-related rescue medications intercurrent event through the end of 
the Maintenance Study will not be used in the analysis except for the As Observed (AO) analysis.
Missing data
For binary efficacy endpoints, missing data will be handled using the following approaches:

The primary approach for handling missing data will be Non-Responder Imputation while 
incorporating Multiple Imputation (MI) to handle missing data due to COVID-19 (NRI-C). This 
includes non-responder imputation at and after the UC-related rescue medications intercurrent 
event.

A sensitivity analysis will use NRI with No special data handling for missing due to COVID-19 
(NRI-NC). Subjects at or after the occurrence of the UC-related rescue medications 
intercurrent event will still be counted as non-responders.

A Sensitivity analysis will be performed using Hybrid Multiple Imputation Method (HMI) for the 
primary endpoint. Subjects who discontinue study drug prior to Week 52 due to lack of efficacy 
or AEs and have no available measurements will be considered as "non-responder" for clinical 
remission. Subjects who discontinue for other reasons and have no available measurements, or 
subjects who has missing Week 52 evaluations will be categorized according to the data from 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 53/195
multiple imputations. In addition, at and after the UC-related rescue medications intercurrent 
event subjects will be counted as non-responders.

An As Observed (AO) analysis will also be performed. This analysis will not impute values for 
missing evaluations, and thus a subject who does not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit 
will be excluded from the AO analysis for that visit. AO will include all values collected in the 
study regardless the occurrence of UC-related rescue medication intercurrent event.
Multiple Imputation (MI) for NRI-C and HMI: PROC MI will be used to generate 30 datasets using the 
regression method. The variables to be included in the imputation model are: treatment group, 
stratification factors, Baseline measurement, and if applicable, post-baseline measurements at each 
visit up to the end of the analysis period. The imputed post-baseline measurements will be rounded to 
the same precision as the observed data before the determination of responder status. Subjects will be 
characterized as responders or non-responders based on MI imputed datasets. Note that 
measurements will be set to missing at or after the occurrence of the UC-related rescue medications 
intercurrent event before applying MI.
For continuous endpoints, missing data will be handled using the following approaches:

The primary approach is Multiple Imputation Incorporating Return-to-Baseline to Handle Visits 
After UC-related Rescue Medication Use (RTB-MI). To assess the potential departures from the 
missing-at-random (MAR) assumptionfor visits after the intercurrent event of UC-related 
rescue medication use, the Return-to-Baseline (RTB) approach which assumes subjects 
received UC-related rescue medication will have a washout "return to baseline" of any potential 
treatment effect, will be performed as following:
o
o
Step 1:  after setting data after the intercurrent event of UC-related rescue medication 
use as missing, missing values due to all causes will first be imputed via MI under the 
MAR assumption.
Step 2:  subject's efficacy assessments after the intercurrent event of UC-related 
rescue medication will be assumed to have returned to baseline. For each imputed 
dataset, missing change from baseline data due to the intercurrent event of UC-related 
rescue medication will be replaced by a value from a normal distribution (0, V), where 
V is the variance of change from baseline estimated from all observed values 
regardless of treatment groups, excluding those after UC-related rescue medication 
use. 
o
Step 3:  For each imputed dataset, the MMRM/ANCOVA model will be applied to each 
completed set and the inference will be drawn using Rubin's combination rules (SAS 
proc MIANALYZE).
 MMRM/ANCOVA:  Assuming any unobserved data (including the missing due to the intercurrent 
event of UC-related rescue medication use) can be considered as MAR, an MMRM/ANCOVA 
model excluding data after the intercurrent event of UC-related rescue medication use will be 
performed as a sensitivity analysis.
 Delta-Based Multiple Imputation (DBMI).  A missing-not-at-random (MNAR) model that varies 
assumptions for data after the intercurrent event of UC-related rescue medication use will be 
implemented through Delta-Based Multiple Imputation (DBMI). The DBMI is two-dimensional, 
i.e., assumptions about the missing outcomes on the upadacitinib treatment groups and the 
placebo group are allowed to vary independently. After setting data after the intercurrent event 
of UC-related rescue medication use as missing, missing values due to all causes will first be 
imputed via MI under the MAR assumption, and then a shift parameter (i.e., delta) will be 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 54/195
applied to the imputed values for the missing data due to UC-related rescue medication use. 
For each pair of deltas, the MMRM/ANCOVA model will be applied to each completed set and 
the inference will be drawn using Rubin's combination rules (SAS proc MIANALYZE). For each 
endpoint to be analyzed, the analysis will be repeated for a range of delta values corresponding 
to 0 to ±100% of the unadjusted mean observed for all subjects.

As Observed (AO):  The AO analysis will not impute values for missing evaluations, and thus a 
subject who does not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit will be excluded from the AO 
analysis for that visit.  AO will include all values collected in the study regardless the 
occurrence of UC-related rescue medication intercurrent event.
Efficacy analysis
Categorical variables will be analyzed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by Bio-IR 
status (Bio-IR or Non-Bio-IR) at the Baseline of Induction Study, clinical remission status at Week 0 
(yes or no), and corticosteroid use at Week 0 (yes or no).  Any subject who was randomized under the 
wrong stratum will be analyzed according to the actual stratum the subject belongs to.  Continuous 
variables collected longitudinally will be analyzed using Mixed-Effect Model Repeat Measurement 
(MMRM) model.  Continuous variables collected at only one post-baseline visit will be analyzed using 
an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model.  MMRM model includes the categorical fixed effects of 
treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, randomization stratification factors (Bio-IR status 
(Bio-IR or Non-Bio-IR) at the Baseline of the Induction Study, clinical remission status a Week 0 (yes 
or no), and corticosteroid use at Week 0 (yes or no)), and the continuous fixed covariates of Baseline 
measurements.  An unstructured variance covariance matrix (UN) will be used.  If the model cannot 
converge, autoregressive (1) covariance structure matrix will be used.  The parameter estimations are 
based on the method of restrictive maximum likelihood (REML).  The fixed effects will be used to report 
model-based means at corresponding visits.  ANCOVA model includes the categorical fixed effects of 
treatment, randomization stratification factors (Bio-IR status:  Bio-IR or Non-Bio-IR) at the Baseline of 
the Induction Study, clinical remission status at Week 0 (yes or no), and corticosteroid use at Week 0 
(yes or no)), and the continuous fixed covariates of Baseline measurements.
Type I error control
The overall type I error rate of the primary and ranked secondary endpoints for the two upadacitinib 
doses will be strongly controlled using iterative graphical testing procedure described in the figure. 
Specifically, the testing will utilize the sequence of hypothesis testing for the primary endpoint followed 
by the ranked key secondary endpoints in the order as specified, and will begin with testing the 
primary endpoint using α of 0.025 for each upadacitinib dose compared to placebo.  Continued testing 
will follow a pre-specified weight of α allocation between the single hypothesis within the family, as 
well as between the families of hypotheses across the doses (denoted as node). In the graph, the 
arrows specify the weight of α allocation between nodes.  Once a hypothesis is rejected (i.e., deemed 
the endpoint is significant) at its assigned significance level, its significance level will be allocated to 
the subsequent node.  If more than one arrow originates from a node, the significance level will be 
split between multiple subsequent nodes following the pre-specified weight.

2.6.5.4.  Supportive study
Long-Term Extension Study M14-533
The study includes 2 cohorts:
Cohort 1:  562 subjects who had not responded at the end of the induction period in Study M14-234 
Substudy 1 or who had loss of response during the maintenance period of Study M14-234 Substudy 3.  
Subjects received OL upadacitinib 15 mg beginning at Week 0 (last visit in Study M14-234 or up to 14 
days later).  At or after Week 2, subjects receiving upadacitinib 15 mg who experienced inadequate 
response and no safety concerns identified by the investigator could have been escalated to 
upadacitinib 30 mg.
Cohort 1 also included subjects who reached Week 44 of Study M14-234 Substudy 3 prior to protocol 
amendment 3 (21 August 2018), based on the previous protocol requirements for entry into Study 
M14-533.
Cohort 2:  All subjects who completed M14-234 Substudy 3 through Week 52 (136 subjects [15 mg 
upadacitinib], 178 subjects [30 mg upadacitinib], 36 [placebo]) were eligible to enroll in Cohort 2 
(Figure 14).
In Cohort 2, at Week 0, all subjects who achieved clinical remission in Study M14-234 Substudy 3 
continued to receive their original assigned double-blind treatment (placebo, upadacitinib 7.5, 15, or 
30 mg).
Subjects who were not in clinical remission at Week 0 were eligible to dose escalate in a blinded 
manner and receive:


Upadacitinib 15 mg for those originally assigned to placebo or upadacitinib 7.5 mg
Upadacitinib 30 mg for those originally assigned to upadacitinib 15 mg treatment in Study 
M14-234 Substudy 3


Upadacitinib 30 mg treatment if they were already receiving that dose
Figure 14 Long-Term Extension Study M14-533 Subject Distribution
The ITT population included subjects who entered Cohort 1 (ITTA1 and ITTB1); and subjects who 
entered Cohort 2 (ITTA2 and ITTB2) (Figure above).  The ITTA population included subjects who were 
upadacitinib 45 mg QD 8-week induction responders and who were enrolled under the protocol for 52-
week maintenance treatment period in Cohort 1 of the Maintenance Study.  ITTA1 and ITTA2 are 
subsets of ITTA in Cohort 1 and 2 of the LTE Study, respectively. The ITTB population included 
subjects who were upadacitinib 45 mg QD 16-week induction responders in Cohort 3 of the 
Maintenance Study.  ITTB1 and ITTB2 are subsets of ITTB in Cohort 1 and 2 of the LTE Study, 
respectively. To support the continued long-term efficacy following the induction and maintenance 
treatment, this efficacy presentation is focused on ITTA2 (highlighted in the figure above) among 
subjects who have successfully completed the induction and maintenance treatment.  Only Week 48 
data from the LTE study are presented as there are too few patients who have reached later time 
points at the date of the data cut off to be evaluable.

With this submission, the MAH seeks to add a new indication for Rinvoq (Upadacitinib) for the 
treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an 
inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic 
agent. This application is supported by data from two replicate phase 3 induction studies (M14-234 
Substudy 2 and M14-675) and one ongoing phase 3 maintenance study (M14-234 Substudy 3) which 
were all double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled multi-centre studies. Additional information is 
provided from the dose finding study (M14-234 Substudy 1) and the long term extension study (M14-
533). As stated in the EMA Guideline (CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Rev.1 Guideline on the development of 
new medicinal products for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis) “to fulfil a claim for the treatment of 
ulcerative colitis, it is expected that at least two confirmatory trials are provided”. This is considered as 
fulfilled. The MAH also received Scientific Advice at the CHMP (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/336739/2016 
EMEA/H/SA/3190/2/2016/II), where the rather complex study design of study M14-234 (a three part 
study with a seamless design including one dose finding part (substudy 1), one induction study 
(substudy 2) and a maintenance study (substudy 3) was discussed and approved. Most of the CHMP 
advices were followed with some minor deviations discussed below. 
The dose finding study (M14-234 Substudy 1) was a Phase 2b dose-ranging study designed to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of 4 oral doses of upadacitinib (7.5 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg) compared to 
placebo as 8-week induction therapy in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. The study 
duration included a Screening Period of up to 5 weeks and an 8-week double-blind (DB) Induction 
Period. 
The two replicate induction studies (M14-234 Substudy 2 and M14-675) were two-part Phase 3 dose-
confirming studies designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral administration of upadacitinib 
45 mg compared to placebo as induction therapy for up to 16 weeks. The studies included a Screening 
Period of up to 5 weeks followed by a placebo controlled part with a duration of 8 weeks where 
patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive Upadacitinib 45 mg once daily or placebo. The 
studies also included a second part were patients who did not achieve a clinical response at week 8 
received Upadacitinib 45 mg open label for additional 8 weeks.
Subjects who completed either one of the three studies (M14-234 substudy 1, M14-234 substudy 2 or 
study M14-675) and achieved a clinical response per adapted mayo score at week 8 (or week 16) were 
rerandomized into the Maintenance Study. Clinical response per adopted mayo score was defined as a 
decrease from baseline in the Adapted Mayo score ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from baseline, PLUS a 
decrease in RBS ≥ 1 or an absolute RBS ≤ 1. The subjects were randomized into four different cohorts 
depending on the treatment received in the induction studies. Cohort 1 included subjects who received 
Upadacitinib 15 mg, 30 mg or 45 mg in the M14-234 Substudy 1, Upadacitinib 45 mg for 8 weeks in 
the M14-234 substudy 2 or in study M14-675 (either blinded for 8 weeks in part 1 or placebo in part 1 
followed by open label 45 mg upadacitinib for 8 weeks). Patients were rerandomized 1:1:1 to receive 
eighter upadacitinib 15mg, upadacitinib 30 mg or placebo except for the 15 mg group, which only 
received 15 mg or placebo. Cohort 2 included placebo patients with a clinical response from the three 
studies. These patients were not rerandomized but continued to receive placebo during the 
maintenance phase. Cohort 3 included patients who received upadacitinib 45 mg for 16 weeks in study 
M14-234 substudy 2 or in study M14-675. These patients were rerandomized 1:1 to upadacitinib 15 
mg or 30 mg. Cohort 4 included patients who received upadacitinib 7.5 mg during Study M14-234 
Substudy 1 and continued to receive blinded treatment of upadacitinib 7.5 mg in the maintenance 
study.
The primary analysis regarding the maintenance phase is conducted in a subgroup of patients from the 
Cohort 1 defined as “the subset of ITT population who were the first randomized 451 (actual) 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 113/195
upadacitinib 45 mg QD 8-week induction responders and who were enrolled under the protocol for 52-
week maintenance treatment period in Cohort 1”. This is acceptable.
Subjects who had not responded at the end of the induction period in Study M14-234 Substudy 1, had 
loss of response during the maintenance period of Study M14-234 Substudy 3, or had completed Study 
M14-234 Substudy 3 could proceed to the long term extension study. Only limited data is provided 
from this study regarding efficacy.
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar in the two induction studies and the dose-finding study 
and uses Adapted Mayo Score (Adapted Mayo Score of 5 to 9 and endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3) to 
define patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. The Adapted Mayo score uses 
three parts of the 4 part Mayo score, excluding the physician global assessment (PGA). It is 
acknowledged that several previous studies for approved UC treatments have used a Mayo score 6-12 
to define moderate to severe disease (with inclusion of and endoscopy subscore of ≥2 and in later 
studies also a definition of a minimal level of symptom burden). Although it would have been preferred 
to have a definition also regarding a minimal level of symptoms (as also stated in the EMA UC GL), it 
was concluded in the CHMP SA that “using the modified Mayo definition to recruit subjects with 
moderately or severely active UC into a registration trial can be acceptable but the interchangeability 
with the full Mayo score should be demonstrated convincingly with a view on common clinical practice 
and external validity of trial results”. Upon request the MAH verified that almost all patients (>99%) 
also fulfilled the full Mayo score definition of moderate to severe disease. In addition, >75% of the 
patients had a RBS ≥ 1 and SFS >1 at baseline, indicating a relevant amount of symptom burden at 
inclusion, and in these patients, the results were in line with the whole population. 
Patients should also demonstrate inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to at least one 
of the following treatments including, oral aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants 
and/or biologic therapies. It is noted that although the doses and timespan defined for corticosteroid 
and bio-therapy treatment seems adequate, the doses for 5-ASA and thiopurines seem low, especially 
in active disease. Concomitant stable medication with aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and Mtx were 
allowed during the study; however, thiopurines were not allowed during the study. At the CHMP’s 
request, the patient description in section 5.1 of the SmPC has been updated accordingly. Since the 
concomitant use of thiopurines, including 6-mercaptopurin, has not been evaluated in clinical studies, 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect this information at the CHMP’s request. 
The suggested indication text “Upadacitinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or 
were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent” adequately reflects the intended 
population and is in line with other products with the same indication.
The primary endpoint used in the studies “clinical remission per adapted mayo score” is a composite 
endpoint evaluating symptoms and endoscopic features of UC, using 3 parts of the well-known Mayo 
Score, however with exclusion of the Physician global scale. To be a responder the patient should have 
a stool frequency score (SFS) ≤1 and not greater than baseline, a rectal bleeding score (RBS) of 0, and 
endoscopic subscore ≤ 1 (with no friability). Similar (but not identical) endpoints have been used in 
other studies of approved treatments for UC, however a composite endpoint such as this is not fully in 
line with the EMA UC GL (CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 rev 1), which states that clinical (symptoms) and 
endoscopic remission should be evaluated as co-primary endpoints to ensure a beneficial effect over 
placebo in both parts. However, the sub-scoring levels chosen are consistent with the guideline, which 
states that a score of 0 or 1 may be used for defining endoscopic healing and symptomatic remission 
should include cessation of rectal bleeding. The study also started before the publication of the updated 
EMA guideline, and the endpoint was accepted during the SA, although with some comments. 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 114/195
Nonetheless, some additional analyses were requested to further evaluate the contributions of the 
different parts of the composite endpoint to the overall results (see further below). 
The studies have several ranked secondary outcomes, evaluating different levels of endoscopic 
remission/response, histologic remission/response, time to response, partial response and for long 
term also corticosteroid free remission and maintenance of remission. The CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 
guideline requires that for a claim of “maintenance of remission”, it needs to be demonstrated that 
patients being in complete remission at study entry remain in remission throughout a full 52-week 
study period. As the maintenance study included both responders and remitters after induction, the 
most relevant endpoints in the assessment of the maintenance study are therefore the key secondary 
endpoints maintenance of remission and corticosteroid-free remission. The study also includes IBDQ 
and FACIT-F (a fatigue score) and two new endpoints regarding abdominal pain and bowel urgency.
In induction study M14-234 Substudy 2, 667 patients were screened, and 474 subjects were 
randomized (319 patients to 45 mg upadacitinib and 155 patients to placebo). 
In induction study M14-675, 769 patients were screened, and 522 subjects were randomized (345 
patients to 45 mg upadacitinib and 177 patients to placebo). 
The numbers of screening failures were between 29% and 35% in the three induction studies. The 
predominant reason for screening failure was disease activity that did not meet the criteria for 
moderately to severely active UC. 
The percentage of subjects who discontinued study drug in the induction studies was low (3.8% and 
3.2% for Upadacitinib 45 mg and 12.3% and 7.5% for placebo). Study drug discontinuation due to lack 
of efficacy and due to AEs was more frequent in the placebo group. 
A total of 1046 patients continued to the M14-234 substudy 3 maintenance study. Among all enrolled 
subjects, 445 subjects have completed the study, 413 subjects have prematurely discontinued from 
the study at the time of the data cut-off date, and 188 subjects were still ongoing. More patients in the 
placebo group discontinued the study drug (65.8%), than in the Upadacitinib 15 mg group (33.1%) 
and Upadacitinib 30 mg group (21.4%). The main reason for discontinuation were lack of efficacy 
(49.7%, 23.6% and 7.8%) and adverse events (9.4%, 2.7% and 5.2%) in placebo, Upadacitinib 15 
and Upadacitinib 30 group respectively.
Among the 1044 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug, 6 were excluded from the ITT 
population and efficacy analysis due to site non-compliance, which are not supposed to alter the study 
conclusion. The prespecified primary analysis cohort ITT-A consisted of a subpopulation of the whole 
ITT population: the first randomized 451 upadacitinib 45 mg QD 8-week induction responders and who 
were enrolled under the protocol for 52-week maintenance treatment period in Cohort 1. Upon request 
the MAH clarified that 21 patients (4.7%) from M14-234 substudy 1, 278 patients (61.6%) from M14-
234 Substudy 2 and 152 patients (33.7%) from study M14-675 were included in analyses of the 
maintenance study. 
In the induction studies (M14-234 substudy 2 and M14-675 respectively), demographics was well 
balanced between the treatment groups and similar in both induction studies. The majority of patients 
were male (62%) and mean age was 42 and 44 years. In study M14-675, 9 persons (1.7%) were <18 
years, however none of the participants were <16 years. The MAH does not make any claims for 
treating adolescents which is acceptable. The majority of patients were white. Baseline disease 
characteristics were also well balanced between the treatment groups and similar in both induction 
studies. In the M14-234 substudy 2 and M14-675 study respectively, the mean disease duration was 
8.8 and 7.3 years, 52% and 50.7% were Bio IR (intolerant or inadequate responders). Around 30% in 
both studies had tried >2 biologics. 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 115/195
Around 49% and 52% had a Mayo score >9 at baseline, indicating severe disease.  Thus, the study 
population comprises of patients with an active moderate to severe disease which are in line with the 
proposed indication. However, the definition of moderate UC in the SmPC as adapted mayo score < 7 
was not correct and upon request, the MAH corrected this to a score ≥5 and ≤7. 
With respect to concomitant UC medications use, the proportions of subjects taking 
immunosuppressive treatment at baseline were few, and it should be noted that thiopurines (eg 
azathioprine and 6-MP) were not allowed during the studies. Immunosuppressive treatment was 
received by 5 patients (1.1%) in the M14-234 substudy 2 and 4 patients (0.8%) in study M14-675. 
From the tables regarding concomitant medication provided by the MAH the immunosuppressive 
treatment are referring mainly to Methotrexate. Since immunosuppressive/immunomodulator 
treatment in UC usually refers to thiopurines (methotrexate is not commonly used in UC), using the 
term immunomodulators when describing concomitant medication in the SmPC could therefore be 
misleading and, at CHMP request, the MAH corrected the wording in the SmPC. Aminosalicylates were 
taken by 68% in both studies and corticosteroids were taken by 38% and 36% in study M14-234 
substudy 2 and M14-675 respectively. The proportion of subjects with concomitant use of systemic 
corticosteroids, aminosalicylates or immunosuppressive at baseline was evenly distributed across 
treatment groups. However, since the patients were not allowed to continue with thiopurines, there 
were some concerns regarding insufficient treatment in the placebo group and thus, the MAH was 
asked to report the doses of concomitant medication in respective group including the cumulative use 
of steroids. The results provided show that, although a baseline standard dose of aminosalicylates 
could not be provided, only a few patients received aminosalicylates as rescue treatment.  Regarding 
corticosteroid treatment, corticosteroids use were balanced across treatment arms at baseline of the 
induction studies and also at the beginning of the maintenance study. Corticosteroids was as expected 
the most commonly used rescue therapy and subjects on placebo were more likely to receive rescue 
corticosteroids (17.4% of subjects) compared to those on 15 mg (4.7%) and 30 mg (4.5%) 
upadacitinib treatment. Cumulative steroid dose were lowest in the group receiving Upadacitinib 30 
mg.  
Baseline characteristics for patients that proceed to the maintenance studies were similar to the 
patients in the induction studies. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses
In the induction studies, clinical remission per adapted Mayo score at week 8 were reached in 83/319 
(26.1%) and 114/341 (33.5%) in the Upadacitinib 45 mg group and 7/154 (4.8%) and 7/174 (4.1%) 
in the placebo group. The between group difference was 21.6 % (95% CI 15.8, 27.4 p<0.001) and 
29.0% (95% CI 23.2, 34.7, p<0.001) in the M14-234 substudy 2 and the M14-675 study respectively. 
The results are considered highly statistically significant and clinically relevant and well in line with 
other approved products with the same indication. In addition, all ranked secondary endpoints were 
statistically significant (p<0.001) and supports the results from the primary endpoint. According to the 
EMA UC guideline, efficacy should be apparent on both symptoms and endoscopic evaluation and the 
secondary endpoints provides several reassurances that a beneficial efficacy is achieved also regarding 
improvement/healing of the mucosa.  Endoscopic improvement (endoscopic mayo score ≤1) was seen 
in 116/319 (36.3%) vs 11/154 (7.4%), (difference 29.3%, p<0.001) and 150/341 (44%) vs 14/174 
(8.3%) (difference 35.7%, p<0.001) and endoscopic remission (endoscopic mayo score 0) was seen in 
44/319 (13.7%) vs 2/154 (1.3%), (difference 12.4%, p>0.001) and 62/341 (18.2%) vs 3/174 (1.7%) 
(difference 16.4%, p<0.001). Also, the strictest endpoint “Mucosal healing”, which required both 
endoscopic and histological normalisation of the mucosa (Endoscopic score = 0 and Geboes score < 2) 
were in favour of Upadacitinib. Regarding symptomatic response, the ranked secondary endpoint 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 116/195
“subjects with clinical response per partial adapted Mayo score at Week 2” revealed that symptom 
relieve was seen in a higher proportion of Upadacitinib treated patients than placebo already at week 
2; however, this endpoint allows the patients to still have some rectal bleeding (RBS score ≤1), which 
is not in line with the EMA UC GL. 
Additional analysis provides information regarding both “subjects with RBS of 0 over time” and 
“subjects with SFS ≤1 over time”. In these analyses 234/319(73.4%) and 235/341 (68.9%) vs 43/154 
(27.9%) and 57/174 (32.8%) had no rectal bleeding at week 8 and 191/319 (59.9%)  211/341 
(61.9%) vs 40/154 (26.0%) and 34/174 (19.5%) had a SFS ≤1 at week 8. This is reassuring. 
However, to substantiate the contributions of the clinical (symptomatic) part to the composite 
endpoint, the MAH was asked to evaluate the numbers and proportions of patients in clinical 
symptomatic remission (ie patients with stool frequency score ≤1 (and also with the stricter endpoint 
SFS=0)  and a rectal bleeding score 0). In addition, as suggested in the CHMP SA, since RBS and SFS 
are calculated from subjects’ diaries’ entries as an average of subscores based on 3 days prior to each 
study visit, the MAH was asked to use an alternate calculation method using worst score instead of 
average score and/or an alternate timeframe to ensure that the study results are robust. These 
additional analyses confirms that improvements were observed compared to placebo also when only 
symptomatic components (SFS and RBS) were evaluated, and the results were similar when using 
average or worst report of SFS and RBS of 3 days. The MAH initially included information in the 
proposed SmPC regarding clinical (symptomatic) remission over time, using a definition which not only 
includes PGA, but also allows the patient to have some rectal bleeding (i.e an EBS score 0-1). At 
CHMP’s request, a new figure of symptomatic remission over time using the definitions SFS≤1 and 
EBS=0 was included instead in the SmPC.
The MAH has also analysed two other symptoms as ranked secondary endpoints: abdominal pain and 
bowel urgency, and both endpoints were statistically in favour for upadacitinib. Although both 
endpoints could be of clinical relevance, these are new outcome measures. The validation of these 
endpoints is not considered sufficiently robust for these endpoints to be included in the SmPC. Two 
PROs, rectal bleeding and stool frequency, are already included in the composite primary endpoint and 
will provide some information regarding the patient’s symptoms. In addition, both abdominal pain and 
bowel urgency are in some aspects covered in the questionaries of IBDQ. Regarding the IBDQ, 
additional analyses provided by the MAH showed that the results are robust, with a difference between 
the Upadacitinib treated patients and the placebo group seen in all four domain scores (Bowel 
Symptoms, Systemic Symptoms, Emotional Functioning, and Social Functioning). The result is clinically 
relevant with 80%–81% of subjects on treatment compared to 44% placebo achieving a change of 
≥ 16 points on the IBDQ total score, and 61%–62% of subjects on treatment vs 23%–28% in the 
placebo group had a total score associated with remission (≥ 170) at Week 8.  Similar results were 
demonstrated in the Phase 3 maintenance study. Regarding the fatigue score FACIT-F, the results seen 
with the additional treatment policy analysis are in line with the results from the primary analysis and 
the results seems to be clinically relevant. However, since the validation regarding FACIT-F for UC 
patients in a long term perspective is sparce, and some aspects of fatigue are already covered within 
the IBDQ questionaries, additional information regarding a change in fatigue score does not seems to 
be crucial for the prescribers. Hence, it is not included in the SmPC.
For both the induction studies the data bases were locked before the respective SAPs were finalised. 
In total seven subjects were excluded from efficacy analysis based on significant non-compliance at 
one site. This is not expected to have altered any conclusions and is hence accepted. Randomised 
subjects who did not receive any study treatment were to be excluded from ITT population; however, 
no such cases occurred.

The primary estimand for the primary endpoint handles the intercurrent Event (ICE) treatment 
discontinuations with a treatment policy approach and initiation or dose escalation of UC-related 
corticosteroids with a composite approach. This is in accordance with the EMA Guideline 
(CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Rev.1 Guideline on the development of new medicinal products for the 
treatment of Ulcerative Colitis) and hence acceptable as the primary estimand. For secondary 
endpoints, binary endpoints are handled in the same way as the primary whereas for continuous 
endpoints a hypothetical approach is used for the ICE initiation or dose escalation of UC-related 
corticosteroids. This is a somewhat inconsistent approach. No true treatment policy estimand has been 
defined neither for binary nor for continuous endpoints. However, this issue was not further pursued by 
the CHMP.
The handling of missing data due to covid-19 is acceptable since it seems reasonable to assume such 
data to be missing at random (MAR). The missing data handling for binary endpoints is in line with the 
composite estimand with sensitivity analyses with a hybrid approach and an observed cases approach. 
The MMRM method used for continuous endpoints is dependent on the MAR assumption. No sensitivity 
analysis challenging this assumption has been presented.
Upon request the MAH was asked to define a supplementary estimand for each of the pivotal induction 
studies for primary and ranked secondary endpoints (both binary and continuous), that handles 
intercurrent events with a treatment policy approach. The results are consistent with and support the 
results of the primary analyses of the primary and ranked secondary endpoints.
The overall type I error rate of the primary and the ranked secondary endpoints are controlled using 
the fixed-sequence multiple testing procedure. This is acceptable.
A beneficial efficacy in favour for Upadacitinib was seen also in all prespecified subgroups, suggesting a 
beneficial efficacy in different age groups, disease stages and races. Results of the subgroup analysis 
by bio-IR status shows a clinically important and robust efficacy in both patients with previous 
failure/intolerance to biological treatment (bio-IR) and patients with previous failure/intolerance to 
conventional therapy only (bio-non IR). It should be noted that also the bio non-IR group could have 
received a biologic treatment before (but should not had failed it but could have discontinued it 
because of insurance reason or remission). Only a few patients in the bio non-IR group had received 
previous biologic treatment. In the biologic-IR group clinical remission per adapted Mayo score at week 
8 was achieved by 17.9% and 29.6% in the Upadacitinib group, and 0.4% and 2.4% in the placebo 
group. Also, all the key secondary endpoints were in favour for upadacitinib in both groups. 
The findings from the two induction studies support the suggested posology of 45 mg upadacitinib for 
an 8 week induction treatment. See 2.6.3. However, the MAH also suggests additional 8 weeks of 45 
mg induction treatment for patients who did not achieve a clinical response at week 8. This suggestion 
is based on the results from the second part of the induction studies, where 125 patients who did not 
achieve a clinical response at week 8 on 45 mg Upadacitinib continued to receive the same dose open 
label for in total 16 weeks. Integrated data from the two pivotal induction studies showed that 48.3% 
of these patients achieved a clinical response per Adapted Mayo at Week 16 although only 5.6% 
achieved clinical remission per adapted Mayo score at week 16. Endoscopic response at week 16 were 
seen in only 14.3% patients. Of the 45 patients that continued to the maintenance phase, 8/24 
(33.3%) of the patients randomised to 30mg Upadacitinib and 4/21 (19%) of the patients randomised 
to 15 mg were in clinical remission at week 52. At CHMP’s request, the MAH was asked to explore 
whether any clinical features could identify patients who may require the 16 week induction treatment. 
Most of the patients represented a difficult to treat patient population, with 66.4% of patients previous 
failed biologics. Since some patients without any evidence of initial response at all could benefit of a 
prolonged treatment, the MAH’s suggestion to provide this for all patients who may require it per the 
physician's judgment based on the condition of each patient was agreed by the CHMP. At CHMP’s 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 118/195
request, a cross-reference to available efficacy and safety data in sections 4.8 and 5.1 has been 
included in section 4.2. The dosing recommendation in the SmPC reads as follows: “For patients who 
do not achieve adequate therapeutic benefit by week 8, upadacitinib 45 mg once daily may be 
continued for an additional 8 weeks (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). Upadacitinib should be discontinued in 
any patient who shows no evidence of therapeutic benefit by week 16.”
In the maintenance study, statistically significant (<0.001) and clinically relevant treatment differences 
between both Upadacitinib doses (15 mg and 30 mg) and placebo were observed for the primary and 
all key secondary endpoints. The primary endpoint, clinical remission per adapted Mayo score at week 
52, was reached by 42.3% of the upadacitinib 15 mg patients, 51.7% of the upadacitinib 30 mg 
patients and 12.1% of the placebo patients. Difference in proportion between the 15 mg group and the 
placebo group was 34.7% (CI: 20.3, 54.6, p<0.001) and between the 30 mg group and placebo group 
47% (CI: 30.7,63.3, p<0.001). Maintenance of remission was seen in 59.2% of the 15 mg upadacitinib 
patients, 69.7% of the 30 mg upadacitinib patients and 22.2% of the placebo patients. Similar 
numbers were seen when analysing corticosteroid-free sustained remission (corticosteroid free for > 
90 days before week 52); however this number is based on the population in clinical remission at the 
end of the induction studies. Upon request, the MAH provided additional information regarding 
corticosteroid free symptomatic remission and corticosteroid free endoscopic remission. In the whole 
population, corticosteroid free (for >90 days preceding week 52) symptomatic remission was seen in 
17.4% of the placebo patients, 54.7% of the upa 15mg patients and 61.8% of the upa 30 mg patients. 
Corticosteroid free endoscopic remission (ES=0) was seen in 7/149 (4.9%) of the placebo patients, 
34/148 (22.9%) of the upa 15mg patients and 39/154 (25.1%) of the upa 30 mg patients. In patients 
with corticosteroids at the beginning of the maintenance study, 6/54 (11.1%) of the placebo patients, 
22/49 (44.9%) of the upa 15mg patients and 26/49 (53.1%) of the upa 30 mg patients were in 
corticosteroid free symptomatic remission, and no patient in the placebo group, 6/49 (12.7%) in the 
upa 15 mg and 9/49 (19.1%) were in corticosteroid free endoscopic remission. These results confirm a 
clinically relevant effect both in clinical symptoms and mucosal healing.  Section 4.2 of the SmPC was 
updated to state that, in patients who have responded to treatment with upadacitinib, corticosteroids 
may be reduced and/or discontinued in accordance with standard of care.
To further explore the benefit of maintenance treatment in responders only, the MAH was asked to 
provide numbers and proportion of patients with adapted mayo response at week 8 (without being in 
remission) who achieved adapted mayo remission at week 52. Of the patients who were clinical 
responders and non-remitters at Week 8 of induction studies, 34.4% and 40.8% of patients 
randomized to upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg achieved clinical remission in the maintenance study at 
Week 52.
The treatment effects of both the 15 mg and 30 mg doses were superior compared with placebo with a 
difference in point estimate of >20% in both the primary and several ranked secondary endpoints. This 
supports the MAH’s conclusion that both doses are effective in treating UC. Also, when analysing the 
subgroups with regards to the primary endpoint, a beneficial efficacy compared to placebo was seen 
with both doses. For bio IR patients clinical remission was seen in 40.5% and 49.1%. The 30 mg dose 
appears to provide a slightly better efficacy in the majority of the subgroups; however, in most of the 
groups the difference in proportion between the two doses were less than 10%. This indicates that a 
15 mg maintenance dose is good enough to provide efficacy in the majority of the population, but a 
higher dose could be of value in some population (e.g., patients with higher disease activity or disease 
severity). The MAH clarified that patients with high disease burden (severe disease, pancolitis or extra-
intestinal manifestations) as well as patients who needed a prolonged induction might benefit from a 
higher 30 mg maintenance dose. At CHMP’s request, section 4.2 of the SmPC was updated 
accordingly:
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 119/195
“The recommended maintenance dose of upadacitinib is 15 mg or 30 mg once daily based on individual 
patient presentation:



A dose of 30 mg once daily may be appropriate for some patients, such as those with high 
disease burden or requiring 16-week induction treatment.
A dose of 30 mg once daily may be appropriate for patients who do not show adequate 
therapeutic benefit to 15 mg once daily.
The lowest effective dose for maintenance should be considered.”
The estimands and intercurrent events are defined in similar manner as in the induction studies. No 
true treatment policy estimand has been defined. For the maintenance study, a supplementary 
estimand was asked to be defined for primary and ranked secondary endpoints (both binary and 
continuous), that handles intercurrent events with a treatment policy approach using all available data  
in the analysis and with missing data imputed using MI with occurrence of corticosteroid related ICEs 
included in the model. The results are consistent with and support the results of the primary analyses 
of the primary and ranked secondary endpoints. The only exception being the ”No abdominal pain” 
endpoint for which the placebo responder rate increased from 21 % with NRI to 44 % with MI.  Upon 
request the MAH also confirmed that the database lock of the study was 08 Jun 2021. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
The two pivotal induction studies demonstrated a clinically relevant and statistically significant 
superiority of Upadacitinib 45 mg compared to placebo in inducing remission in patients with moderate 
to severe ulcerative colitis after 8 weeks of induction treatment. A prolonged induction for additional 8 
week (in total 16 week) may be useful for patients without an initial response, but the safety concerns 
regarding e.g herpes zoster should be taken into consideration and the treatment should be stopped if 
no response is seen at week 16.
In the maintenance study statistically significant (<0.001) and clinically relevant treatment differences 
between both Upadacitinib doses (15 mg and 30 mg) and placebo were observed for the primary and 
all key secondary endpoints at week 52. The additional beneficial effect seen with the higher 30 mg 
dose could be of clinical importance in some patients, and the SmPC has been updated to include a 
statement that the lowest effective dose for maintenance should be considered. 
The CHMP concluded that the efficacy data was adequate to support the new strength of 45mg and the 
new indication in the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis 
who have had an inadequate response, lost response or were intolerant to either conventional therapy 
or a biologic agent.
The following dosing recommendations were endorsed by the CHMP:
Induction
The recommended induction dose of upadacitinib is 45 mg once daily for 8 weeks. For patients who do 
not achieve adequate therapeutic benefit by week 8, upadacitinib 45 mg once daily may be continued 
for an additional 8 weeks (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). Upadacitinib should be discontinued in any 
patient who shows no evidence of therapeutic benefit by week 16.
Maintenance
The recommended maintenance dose of upadacitinib is 15 mg or 30 mg once daily based on individual 
patient presentation:
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022 
Page 120/195
•
A dose of 30 mg once daily may be appropriate for some patients, such as those with high 
disease burden or requiring 16 week induction treatment.
•
A dose of 30 mg once daily may be appropriate for patients who do not show adequate 
therapeutic benefit to 15 mg once daily.
•
The lowest effective dose for maintenance should be considered.
2.6.1.  Clinical safety
Rinvoq was approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in December 2019, and 
subsequently for treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and atopic 
dermatitis (AD). The recommended dose in RA, PsA and AS is 15 mg once daily, while in AD the 
recommended dose is either 15 or 30 mg once daily. In UC, the proposed induction dose is 45 mg for 8 
weeks (with the option to prolong induction for additional 8 weeks) followed by 15 or 30 mg as 
maintenance treatment. Thus, the induction dose proposed for UC is higher than the recently approved 
dose.
The global clinical development program includes a Phase 2b dose-ranging induction study (Study 
M14-234 Substudy 1), two Phase 3 induction studies (Study M14-675 and Study M14-234 Substudy 
2), a Phase 3 maintenance study (Study M14 234 Substudy 3, currently ongoing), and a Phase 3 long-
term extension (LTE) study (Study M14-533). A summary of the overall clinical studies is provided in 
the efficacy section.
The safety profile of upadacitinib was characterized based on the following datasets:
•
Placebo-Controlled Induction (PC_IND) Analysis Set:  to evaluate induction dosing in subjects 
who received up to an 8-week treatment with upadacitinib 45 mg or placebo;
•
Extended Induction (EXT_IND) Analysis Set:  to evaluate induction dosing in subjects who 
received up to a 16-week treatment with upadacitinib 45 mg; and
•
Responders Maintenance (RESP_MAIN) Analysis Set:  to evaluate maintenance dosing in 
subjects who responded to upadacitinib 45 mg 8-week induction treatment and were re-randomized to 
upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg or placebo during the maintenance period.  This set also evaluates long-
term data of maintenance dosing with continuous exposure to upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg during 
the maintenance period through the LTE period in subjects who responded to either upadacitinib 45 mg 
8-week or 16-week induction treatment for which data were censored at dose switching.
The patients are assigned to the following cohorts based on the treatment they achieved in the 
induction studies:




Cohort 1: Responders on 8-week induction with UPA 15 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg, re-randomised to 
UPA 15 mg, UPA 30 mg or placebo in the maintenance phase
Cohort 2: Responders on 8-week induction with placebo, continuing placebo in the 
maintenance phase
Cohort 3: Responders on 16-week induction with upadactinib 45 mg, re-randomised to UPA 15 
mg or UPA 30 mg in the maintenance phase
Cohort 4: Responders on 8-week induction with UPA 7.5 mg, continuing UPA 7,5 mg in the 
maintenance phase

2.6.1.1.  Patient exposure
A total of 1,304 subjects received at least 1 dose of upadacitinib in the UC global Phase 2b and Phase 3 
studies, representing a total of 1,821.1 patient-years (PY) of upadacitinib exposure included in the 
safety analyses. 
For induction treatment, a total of 987 subjects received at least 1 dose of upadacitinib 45 mg, 
representing a total of 169.2 PY of upadacitinib 45 mg exposure.  
Among subjects who responded to upadacitinib 45 mg induction or extended induction treatment, a 
total of 285 subjects received at least 1 dose of upadacitinib 15 mg as maintenance treatment, 
representing a total of 316.9 PY of combined upadacitinib exposure during maintenance treatment and 
any additional exposure during LTE treatment while maintaining the same dose (Table 46)
Likewise, among subjects who responded to upadacitinib 45 mg induction or extended induction 
treatment, a total of 291 subjects received at least 1 dose of upadacitinib 30 mg as maintenance 
treatment, representing a total of 304.0 PY of combined upadacitinib exposure during maintenance 
treatment and any additional exposure during LTE treatment while maintaining the same dose.  Of the 
576 subjects who received either upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg maintenance treatment, 242 (84.9%) 
and 237 (81.4%) had exposure to upadacitinib 15 mg or upadacitinib 30 mg treatment, respectively, 
for at least 26 weeks, and 131 (46.0%) and 137 (47.1%) had exposure to upadacitinib 15 mg or 
upadacitinib 30 mg treatment, respectively, for at least 52 weeks.

Maintenance phase
Between the RESP_MAIN and ALL_TRT Analysis Sets and across upadacitinib treatment groups, the 
rates of overall AEs and most AESIs were generally similar or there was no consistent trend based on 
induction period length, Table 49 and 
Assessment report

Table 50 respectively. The rates of TEAEs of anaemia were higher in subjects who received up to 16 
weeks of induction treatment compared to those who received up to 8 weeks.

Table 50. AESIs by induction period length (responders maintenance analysis set)
In Cohort 1 of the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, the EAERs of TEAE categories, including TEAEs overall, 
SAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug, severe TEAEs, and TEAEs with a reasonable 
possibility of being related to study drug, were lower in both upadacitinib treatment groups compared 
with the placebo group (Table 51). There was a higher rate of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of 
study drug in the upadacitinib 30 mg compared with the upadacitinib 15 mg group.  
In Cohorts 1 and 3 of the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, the EAERs of the TEAE categories were generally 
comparable between the upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg groups (Table 51). 
There was 1 death that occurred within 30 days after the subject's last dose of study drug (i.e., 
treatment-emergent).  The subject received upadacitinib 15 mg in Study M14-234 Substudy 3 and 
rolled over to LTE Study M14-533 while maintaining the same dose.  The death was due to a brain 
injury and was considered by the investigator to have no reasonable possibility of being related to 
study drug.

2.6.1.2.2.  Common adverse events
Induction phase
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, the most frequent TEAEs by SOC (≥ 10% of subjects) were infections and 
infestations, GI disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, and investigations in the 
upadacitinib 45 mg group, and GI disorders, infections and infestations, and musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders in the placebo group.
The most frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 5% of subjects) were acne and blood CPK increased in the 
upadacitinib 45 mg group and worsening of UC in the placebo group (Table 53).

Maintenance phase
In Cohort 1 of the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, the most frequent TEAEs by SOC (≥ 25 E/100 PY) were 
infections and infestations, investigations, and GI disorders in the upadacitinib 15 mg group, infections 
and infestations, investigations, GI disorders, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders in the 
upadacitinib 30 mg group, and GI disorders, infections and infestations, musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders in the placebo group.
The most frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 10 E/100 PY) were nasopharyngitis and worsening of UC in the 
upadacitinib 15 mg group, nasopharyngitis and blood CPK increased in the upadacitinib 30 mg group, 
and worsening of UC, arthralgia, nasopharyngitis, and anaemia in the placebo group. In Cohorts 1 and 
3 of the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, the overall pattern observed of most common TEAEs by SOC and by

Herpes zoster
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, the percentage of subjects with TEAEs of herpes zoster was 0.6% in the 
upadacitinib 45 mg group; no subject reported a TEAE of herpes zoster in the placebo group. There 
were 4 cases reported: 3 herpes zoster and 1 disseminated herpes zoster (cutaneous, unknown 
number of dermatomes, resolved after 12 days while upadacitinib was continued). According to the 
study physician, none were considered severe or serious. 
In the EXT_IND Analysis Set, the EAER of TEAEs of herpes zoster in the upadacitinib 45 mg group 
increased with longer duration of exposure to study drug (15.3 E/100 PY [6 events cumulative] during 
16 weeks of treatment compared with 5.0 E/100 PY [1 event] during the initial 8 weeks of treatment). 
All events of herpes zoster were reported as involving only 1 dermatome.  None of the events were 
considered severe or serious or led to discontinuation of study drug.
In Cohorts 1 and 3 of the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, the EAER of herpes zoster was the same in the 
upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg groups; no event was reported in the placebo group (Table 58).

Venous thromboembolism
Subjects were excluded from the upadacitinib UC global Phase 2b and Phase 3 studies if they had a 
prior history of thrombotic events including DVT and PE or known inherited conditions that predispose 
to hypercoagulability; however, most (> 90%) subjects had already enrolled in the induction studies 
by the time this exclusion criteria was added to the upadacitinib UC protocols.
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, 2 subjects experienced a TEAE of adjudicated VTE; both subjects 
experienced events of non-fatal concurrent DVT and PE (1 subject [0.1%] in the upadacitinib 45 mg 
group and 1 subject [0.3%] in the placebo group). 
A summary of the VTE cases in subjects who received upadacitinib 45 mg induction treatment and 
continued into the maintenance period during the UC clinical studies is shown below.

In the ALL_TRT Analysis Set (ALL_TRT[subj] categorization), the EAER of treatment-emergent SAEs 
was slightly higher in the upadacitinib 45 mg/15 mg compared with the upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg 
cohort (Table 61).  The most commonly reported SAEs (≥ 1.0 E/100 PY in either the upadacitinib 45 
mg/15 mg or upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg cohort) were worsening of UC in the upadacitinib 45 mg/15

b. Both events occurred in 1 subject, 8 days apart, and were confounded by recent treatment with ferric carboxymaltose (ISS 
Table 2.4__4.7.1).
Note:
Rates are displayed by decreasing frequency in the upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg cohort.
There were two deaths reported in the clinical studies in the initial application:

A subject who received upadacitinib 45 mg as induction treatment, followed by upadacitinib 15 
mg as maintenance treatment, and rolled over to LTE Study M14-533 while maintaining the 
same DB dose. The subject died due to a TEAE of brain injury leading to acute respiratory 
failure and hypoxia.  The subject experienced an opiate overdose 6 days prior to the death. 
Both events of overdose and brain injury were considered by the investigator to have no 
reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. The patient had a history of opioid abuse 
and overdose.

A subject who received upadacitinib 30 mg as induction therapy, followed by upadacitinib 15 
mg as maintenance therapy, and upadacitinib 30 mg in LTE Study M14-533.  The subject died 
due to a TEAE of pancreas adenocarcinoma on Day 862, and the fatal event was considered by 
the investigator as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug.

pulmonary embolism in a patient receiving updacitinib 30 mg.
2.6.1.4.  Laboratory findings
Hepatic disorders
In the upadacitinib UC global Phase 2b and Phase 3 studies, the inclusion criteria for transaminases 
were AST and ALT < 2 × ULN at Screening.  The protocol mandated interruption of study drug if a 
subject experienced:  a confirmed elevation of ALT or AST > 3 × ULN in combination with either 
TBL > 2 × ULN or an international normalized ratio > 1.5 or, in combination with relevant clinical 
symptoms, and/or eosinophilia (> 5%); ALT or AST > 5 × for more than 2 weeks or ALT or AST > 8 × 
ULN, in which case the subject was to be evaluated for an alternative aetiology and managed 
medically, as appropriate.
Treatment with upadacitinib is associated with an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation and 
both ALT increased and AST increased are included in the product labelling as ADRs.
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, mean increases in ALT and AST at Week 8 from Baseline were observed 
for the upadacitinib 45 mg group (ALT:  5.6 U/L, AST:  5.8 U/L), while values of ALT and AST generally 
remained unchanged from Baseline for the placebo group (ALT:  –0.1 U/L, AST:  –0.4 U/L).
Figure 15. Plot of Mean Change from Baseline in ALT (Placebo-Controlled Induction Analysis Set)
The percentages of subjects with ALT ≥ 5 × ULN and subjects with AST ≥ 5 × ULN were higher in the 
upadacitinib 45 mg group compared with the placebo group although all percentages were ≤ 1%). No 
subject treated with upadacitinib 45 mg met biochemical criteria for Hy's Law.
One subject in the upadacitinib 45 mg group receiving treatment for latent TB experienced a 
nonserious TEAE of liver damage due to isoniazid (PT of drug-induced liver injury [DILI]) on Day 15 
(ALT was 117 U/L and AST was 55 U/L).  With continued upadacitinib treatment, ALT and AST levels 
returned to normal on Day 28 and the event resolved on Day 42.  The event of DILI was considered by 
the investigator as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug.
In the EXT_IND Analysis Set, mean increases in ALT and AST at Week 8 and Week 16 from Baseline 
were observed in the upadacitinib 45 mg group (ALT:  7.0 and 7.8 U/L, and AST:  7.5 and 8.6 U/L, 
respectively).  The percentages of subjects with ALT ≥ 5 × ULN and AST ≥ 5 × ULN were 1.6% 
(2 subjects) each. No subject treated with upadacitinib 45 mg for up to 16 weeks met biochemical 
criteria for Hy's Law.
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022
Page 138/195
In Cohort 1 of the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, mean increases in ALT and AST at Week 52 from Baseline 
were observed in all treatment groups, with larger increases occurring in the upadacitinib 15 mg 
(7.2 U/L and 6.2 U/L, respectively) and 30 mg (9.3 U/L and 9.9 U/L, respectively) groups compared 
with the placebo group (1.9 U/L and 3.6 U/L, respectively). One subject treated with upadacitinib 30 
mg met biochemical criteria for Hy's Law.
Figure 16. Plot of Mean Change from Baseline in ALT (Responders Maintenance Analysis Set)
In the ALL_TRT Analysis Set, four subjects treated with upadacitinib met biochemical Hy's Law criteria 
based on elevated ALT and/or AST > 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN at any post-Baseline visit during 
upadacitinib dosing.  None of the cases were confirmed as true Hy's Law cases.
Anaemia
Anaemia is listed in section 4.8 of the Rinvoq SmPC. In the upadacitinib UC global Phase 2b and Phase 
3 studies, all subjects at study entry were required to have a haemoglobin value ≥ 90 g/L.  The 
protocols mandated interruption of study drug if a subject's haemoglobin value (confirmed by repeat 
testing) was < 80 g/L or decreased ≥ 30 g/L from Baseline without an alternative aetiology, until the 
haemoglobin values returned to the normal reference range or its Baseline value.
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, mean decreases in haemoglobin at Week 8 from Baseline were observed 
which were numerically greater in the upadacitinib 45 mg group (–1.6 g/L) compared with the placebo 
group (–0.7 g/L). The percentage of subjects with TEAEs of anaemia was numerically lower in the 
upadacitinib 45 mg group (3.5%) compared with the placebo group (5.6%). 
In the EXT_IND Analysis Set, a mean decrease in haemoglobin from Baseline, observed in the 
upadacitinib 45 mg group through Week 8 (–3.8 g/L), was maintained through Week 16 (–3.7 g/L).
Neutropenia
Neutropenia is listed in section 4.8 of the Rinvoq SmPC. In the UC studies, Clinical haematology 
laboratory test results for neutrophil count were evaluated.  Subjects with absolute neutrophil count 
(ANC) < 1,200/µL were excluded from the UC studies.  The protocols mandated interruption of study 
drug if a subject's neutrophil count (confirmed by repeat testing) was < 1000 cells/µL until the 
neutrophil count returned to the normal reference range or its Baseline value.  Study drug 
discontinuation criterion for confirmed ANC was < 500/µL without an alternative aetiology.
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, a mean decrease in neutrophil count at Week 8 from Baseline were 
observed for the upadacitinib 45 mg group (–1.172 × 109/L), which was larger than the placebo group 
(–0.103 × 109/L). The percentage of subjects with TEAEs of neutropenia was higher in the 
upadacitinib 45 mg group (4.6%) compared with the placebo group (0.3%). According to the MAH, in 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022
Page 139/195
the EXT_IND Analysis Set, a mean decrease in neutrophil count from Baseline was generally 
maintained with extended induction treatment with upadacitinib 45 mg. 
Lymphopenia
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, no notable mean changes from Baseline in lymphocyte count over the 8-
week induction treatment was observed in both the upadacitinib 45 mg and placebo groups. 
The percentage of subjects with TEAEs of lymphopenia was higher in the upadacitinib 45 mg group 
(2.5%) compared with the placebo group (0.5%).
In Cohorts 1 and 3 of the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, the percentage of subjects with Grade 3 
lymphocyte count decreases was slightly higher in the upadacitinib 15 mg compared with the 
upadacitinib 30 mg group (Table 62).
In the ALL_TRT Analysis Set, a total of 2 (0.2%) subjects receiving upadacitinib had a Grade 4 
lymphocyte count decrease which occurred at a single time point.  No SAE of lymphopenia was 
reported and discontinuation of upadacitinib due to a TEAE of lymphopenia was infrequent (0.1 E/100 
PY).

Creatine Phosphokinase Elevation
CPK increase is an ADR for upadacitinib in the current product labelling.
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, Grade ≥ 3 CPK increases and TEAEs of CPK elevation were reported in a 
higher percentage of subjects receiving upadacitinib 45 mg treatment compared with placebo. Grade 3 
and 4 CPK increases were infrequent.
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022
Page 140/195
In the EXT_IND Analysis Set, no Grade 4 CPK increase was reported during the extended induction 
period with upadacitinib 45 mg treatment.
In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, the percentage of subjects with Grade ≥ 3 CPK increases and rate of 
TEAEs of CPK elevation were higher with upadacitinib in a dose-dependent manner compared with 
placebo.
In the ALL_TRT Analysis Set, no TEAE of CPK elevation was serious and discontinuation of upadacitinib 
due to TEAEs of CPK elevation was infrequent (0.2 E/100 PY).
Renal Dysfunction
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, a small mean increase at Week 8 from Baseline was observed for 
creatinine in the upadacitinib 45 mg group (4.6 µmol/L), which was higher than the placebo group 
(0.8 µmol/L). Grade 2 creatinine increases were reported at similar frequencies in the upadacitinib 
45 mg (1.0%) and placebo (1.1%) groups. 
In Cohort 1 of the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, throughout the 52 weeks, increases in creatinine were 
higher in the upadacitinib 30 mg group compared to the 15 mg group. The highest levels were 
observed at Week 52, with higher mean increases in creatinine from Baseline for the upadacitinib 15 
mg and 30 mg groups (6.9 and 7.4 µmol/L, respectively) compared with the placebo group 
(2.8 µmol/L).
Lipids
In the RA, PsA, and AD programs, a dose-dependent lipid increase was observed with upadacitinib 
treatment.  However, the impact of increased lipid parameters with JAK inhibitors on CV morbidity and 
mortality is currently unknown. Information on lipid elevations is included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The mean change from baseline in HDL and HDL levels during the maintenance phase is shown below.
A Includes all subjects who responded to upadacitinib 45 mg during induction and were re-randomized to placebo, upadacitinib 
15 mg, or upadacitinib 30 mg and entered into Study M14-234 Substudy 3 (Cohort 1).
Least square mean is based on analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment as a main factor, and Baseline and 
study/substudy number as covariates.  Error bars are based on the standard error (SE) of the mean.

2.6.1.5.  Safety in special populations
Gender
Across the PC_IND, RESP_MAIN, and ALL_TRT Analysis Sets and across treatment groups, the rates of 
TEAEs overall were higher in females compared with males, while the rates of TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug were generally similar.  There was no consistent pattern or trend 
observed for serious TEAEs and severe TEAEs across analysis sets and treatment groups.
Across the PC_IND, RESP_MAIN, and ALL_TRT Analysis Sets and across treatment groups, the rates of 
most AESIs were generally similar or there was no consistent trend between males and females.  The 
rates of TEAEs of hepatic disorder were higher in males compared with females across analysis sets 
and upadacitinib treatment groups.
Renal impairment
Due to a very limited number of patients with GFR<40 mL/min/1.73 m2 (n=4), the data presented 
below are for subjects with screening eGFR ≥ 60 – < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (mild renal impairment) and 
those with eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (normal renal function).
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022

Table 63. TEAEs by GFR (placebo-controlled induction analysis set)
Across the PC_IND, RESP_MAIN, and ALL_TRT Analysis Sets and across treatment groups, there was 
no consistent pattern or trend observed for TEAEs overall, SAEs, TEAEs leading to study drug 
discontinuation, and severe TEAEs between subjects with normal renal function and those with renal 
impairment.
Prior biologic response status
According to the MAH, the safety profile was generally similar between non-Bio-IR and Bio-IR subjects.
Number of prior biologics
Across the PC_IND, RESP_MAIN, and ALL_TRT Analysis Sets and across treatment groups, there was 
no consistent pattern or trend observed for the rates of TEAEs overall, SAEs, and TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug in subjects who received > 1 prior biologic and those who received ≤ 1 
prior biologic.
Baseline steroid use
Across the PC_IND, RESP_MAIN, and ALL_TRT Analysis Sets and across treatment groups, there was 
no consistent pattern or trend observed for TEAEs overall, SAEs, TEAEs leading to study drug 
discontinuation, and severe TEAEs with respect to Baseline steroid use.
Baseline aminosalicylate use
The majority of subjects in the UC clinical studies were on aminosalicylates at Baseline. Across the 
PC_IND, RESP_MAIN, and ALL_TRT Analysis Sets and across treatment groups, there was no 
consistent pattern or trend observed for TEAEs overall, SAEs, TEAEs leading to study drug 
discontinuation, and severe TEAEs between subjects on aminosalicylates at Baseline and those who 
were not.
Across the PC_IND, RESP_MAIN, and ALL_TRT Analysis Sets and across treatment groups, the rates of 
TEAEs of serious infection, neutropenia, and lymphopenia were generally higher in subjects on 
aminosalicylates at Baseline compared to those who were not.
Use in pregnancy and lactation
Upadacitinib has been shown to be teratogenic in animal studies, and is contraindicated during 
pregnancy. Neither, upadacitinib should be used during lactation. 
As of 31 May 2021, there were a total of 93 pregnancies reported in female subjects in upadacitinib 
clinical studies.  The majority were reported in RA studies.  Of the 64 unblinded pregnancies with 
known exposure to upadacitinib, 8 were from UC studies (Table 64).

Includes 1 infant born premature at 28 weeks gestation and 1 born premature at 34 weeks gestation, neither with reported 
complications.
Note:
Based on cumulative exposure through 31 May 2021.
The 14 reports of spontaneous abortion in the upadacitinib clinical program translates to a reporting 
rate of 22% (14 of 64 pregnancies).  Of the 14 pregnancies which resulted in a spontaneous abortion, 
all had other risk factors contributing to an increased risk of miscarriage, including concomitant MTX 
use, advanced maternal age, prior history of miscarriage, obesity, current smoking, or poorly 
controlled diabetes mellitus.  The majority of the spontaneous abortion cases were from the RA clinical 
program and on concomitant MTX at the time of the pregnancy (10 of the 14 spontaneous abortions).  
Thus, the rate of spontaneous abortion observed in the upadacitinib clinical program was not higher 
than what was reported in literature in pregnant patients with exposure to MTX or other risk factors.
The 8 pregnancies reported in UC studies included 3 live births without congenital anomaly, 2 elective 
terminations (no foetal defects or unknown), 2 ongoing, and 1 lost to follow-up.  The subject with a 
pregnancy lost to follow-up received upadacitinib 45 mg while the other 7 subjects received 
upadacitinib 15 mg.
Age
An overview of AEs in patients >=65 years is presented in Table 65 (induction) and Table 66 
(maintenance).

The MAH concludes that the elderly (≥ 65 years of age) who received upadacitinib 45 mg induction 
treatment and upadacitinib 30 mg as maintenance treatment showed higher rates of SAEs, TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation of study drug, and herpes zoster compared to the lower maintenance dose 
and/or younger population. Only patients aged <75 years were included in the studies.

2.6.1.6.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
According to the MAH, the potential for drug-drug interactions between upadacitinib and commonly 
used concomitant medications as well as probe substrates for cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes was 
characterized in several Phase 1 studies.  Based on the results of these studies, strong inducers of 
CYP3A (e.g., rifampin) reduce upadacitinib plasma exposures by approximately half while strong CYP3A 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022
Page 146/195
inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increase upadacitinib area under the concentration-time curve by 75% 
and maximum observed concentration (Cmax) by 70%.  Concomitant administration of strong CYP2D6 
inhibitors, OATP1B inhibitors, MTX, pH modifying medications, or statins have no effect on upadacitinib 
plasma exposures.  Upadacitinib has no clinically relevant effects on plasma exposures of MTX, 
ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel, statins, or drugs that are substrates for metabolism by CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, or CYP3A.
2.6.1.7.  Post marketing experience
Upadacitinib 15 mg daily dose was first approved for the treatment of RA on 16 August 2019 
(international birth date) in the US.  Upadacitinib has been approved in RA in over 60 countries and 
was approved for treatment of PsA and AS in the European Union on 25 January 2021 and in additional 
countries.  Through 30 June 2021, the estimated cumulative post marketing exposure is 
88,004 patient treatment years.
The overall safety of upadacitinib 15 mg QD therapy was evaluated through review of post marketing 
reports (spontaneous, solicited, literature) received from 16 August 2019 through 30 June 2021.  
Search of the AbbVie global safety database retrieved 42,580 reports, which include 4,440 serious 
reports and 38,140 nonserious reports.  Of the 38,140 nonserious reports, 96% (36,699 reports) were 
from solicited sources.
According to the MAH, review of the post marketing safety data reported for upadacitinib to date 
demonstrated a similar safety profile as observed in the clinical studies for RA.  The most frequently 
reported AEs were in the SOC of general disorders and administration site conditions.  Overall, the 
most common reported AEs include arthralgia, pain, and RA (4% each); and drug ineffective and pain 
in extremity (3% each).  Most of the post marketing events are either expected for upadacitinib or 
commonly seen in the general population or patients with RA.  
The most common reported SAEs by PT include surgery and hospitalization (3% each); and 
pneumonia, COVID-19, and cataract (2% each).  The reports of COVID-19 infection were reflective of 
the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during the review period.  Of the cataract reports, review of the 
available information provided that most of the patients were elderly (average age 66 years), which is 
a patient population with high prevalence and incidence of cataract.  Additionally, many of these 
patients with cataracts were also on concomitant medications, such as steroids, which are known to 
cause cataract.  Surgery and hospitalization are not unexpected in patients with RA.  Thus, excluding 
COVID-19, the type and pattern of SAEs reported were similar to what has been observed in the RA 
clinical trials for upadacitinib. 
Although many of the post marketing reports did not provide sufficient information to allow for an 
adequate assessment, review of the available data did not suggest any unusual findings on mortality, 
malignancy, and CV events including MACE and VTE. Besides the underlying medical condition, 
generally, the patients had at least 1 other risk factor observed for the development of these events 
while receiving upadacitinib.
The MAH concludes that analysis of the safety data available from the post marketing experience has 
not confirmed any new clinically important safety risks for upadacitinib.
2.6.2.  Discussion on clinical safety
Rinvoq was approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in December 2019, and 
subsequently for treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and atopic 
dermatitis (AD). The recommended dose in RA, PsA and AS is 15 mg once daily, while in AD the 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022
Page 147/195
recommended dose is either 15 or 30 mg once daily. In UC, the proposed induction dose is 45 mg for 8 
weeks (with the option to prolong induction for additional 8 weeks) followed by 15 or 30 mg as 
maintenance treatment. Thus, the induction dose proposed for UC is higher than the recently approved 
dose.
The main questions for the safety assessment in the present application are as follows:
 whether the safety of the 45 mg induction dose is acceptable, since this is higher than the 
currently approved doses, and 
 whether the use of the 30 mg maintenance dose is sufficiently justified considering that this 
dose was associated with a less favourable safety outcome in the rheumatoid arthritis studies.
The clinical development program is complex, but the main studies are:

Two separate 8-week induction studies (M14-234 substudy 2 and M14-675), with the 
possibility to prolong induction treatment to a total of 16 weeks
 One common 52-week maintenance study (M14-234 substudy 3). The study is currently 
ongoing, and 445/1046 patients had completed the study at data cut-off for this application. 
 One long-term extension (M14-533) for patients who left the maintenance study due to loss of 
response, or who completed the maintenance study. The long-term extension continues up to 
288 weeks. The study is listed as a category 3 study in the RMP, with final study report 
expected in Q1 2025.
Cut-off date for the maintenance and long-term extension studies is 30 April 2021.
The patients are assigned to the following cohorts based on the treatment they achieved in the 
induction studies:




Cohort 1: Responders on 8-week induction with UPA 15 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg, re-randomised to 
UPA 15 mg, UPA 30 mg or placebo in the maintenance phase
Cohort 2: Responders on 8-week induction with placebo, continuing placebo in the 
maintenance phase
Cohort 3: Responders on 16-week induction with upadacitinib 45 mg, re-randomised to UPA 15 
mg or UPA 30 mg in the maintenance phase
Cohort 4: Responders on 8-week induction with UPA 7.5 mg, continuing UPA 7,5 mg in the 
maintenance phase


All Treated UC (ALL_TRT) Analysis Set: to evaluate the safety of treatment regimens over the 
entire treatment course (induction, maintenance, and LTE) in subjects who received at least 1 
dose of study drug in the clinical trials.  This analysis set contains the largest subject numbers 
and PY of upadacitinib exposure.  Safety data were not censored at treatment switching and 
thus, all events, including rare and uncommon events in upadacitinib exposed subjects, are 
captured in this analysis set.  However, because dose switching is part of the study design of 
this clinical program, certain cohorts, as defined for this dataset, contain data from subjects 
who may have been exposed to various doses during the treatment course. Therefore, this 
analysis set is complementary or supportive to the findings in the other datasets as well as 
aids in detection of potential rare events.
The total exposure in the RESP_MAIN analysis set is 316.9 PYs for UPA 15 mg (n=285, mean 
treatment duration 58 weeks) and 304.0 PYs for UPA 30 mg (n=291, mean treatment duration 54.5 
weeks).
Overview of adverse events
During the placebo-controlled 8-week induction period, the frequency of adverse events (AEs) was 
52.6% in the placebo group and 55.4% in the UPA group. SAEs occurred in 5.8% in the placebo group 
and 3.1% in the UPA group. The frequency of patients with AEs leading to discontinuation was higher 
in the placebo group. There were no deaths in either group.
In patients who received an additional 8-week induction, the exposure-adjusted incidence rates of AEs, 
SAEs and SAEs were similar as during the first 8 weeks of induction.
In cohort 1 in the maintenance phase, the exposure-adjusted incidence rate (EAIR) of AEs was lower in 
both UPA groups (UPA 15 mg: 328.4 E/100PYs and UPA 30 mg: 320 E/100PYs) than in the placebo 
group (509E/100PYs). Also SAEs and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were less frequent in 
the UPA arms than for placebo. AEs and serious adverse events were more frequent in the UPA 15 mg 
group (AE: 328.4E/100PYs, SAE: 13.2E/100PYs) than in the UPA 30 mg group (AE: 320 E/100PYs, 
SAE:10.6 E/100PYs). Thus, no clear dose-dependency was observed.
In the combined cohorts 1 and 3 (including also patients who underwent a 16-week induction period), 
a dose-dependency was observed for AEs and SAEs although the differences between the groups was 
quite small. When making a direct comparison of AEs in the maintenance phase between patients 
receiving 8-week induction and 16-week induction, the EAIR of AEs were equally frequent in the 15 mg 
group (294.4E/100PYs) and 30 mg group (297.3E/100 PYs) among patients receiving 8-week 
induction, however AEs were less frequent in the 15 mg group (231.2E/100PYs) than in the 30 mg 
group (337.8E/100 PYs) among patients receiving 16-week induction. It should be noted though, that 
only 35 patients in the 15 mg group and 40 patients in the 30 mg group who needed a prolonged 
induction were included in the maintenance phase and the results should therefore be interpreted with 
caution. 
In the all analysis set, the EAIR of AEs was slightly lower for the UPA 15 mg group (323.3E/100PYs) 
than for the UPA 30 mg group (364E/100PYs), but SAEs were not more frequent in the higher dose 
group. Although the overall risk for AEs was not higher for UPA 30 mg than for the lower 15 mg dose, 
a dose-dependent increase in the risk for CPK increase, neutropenia and folliculitis was observed.
Common adverse events
Frequent AEs reported more frequently in the UPA than in the placebo group during the induction 
phase were acne, increased CPK, nasopharyngitis, neutropenia, pyrexia, rash, folliculitis and upper 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022
Page 149/195
respiratory tract infection. These are all listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC and does not constitute any 
new safety signals. 
Three new AEs have been included in the table of adverse reactions in Section 4.8 of the SmPC with a 
frequency “common”: lymphopenia, hyperlipidaemia, and rash. 
The following summary has been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC:
In the placebo-controlled ulcerative colitis induction and maintenance clinical trials, the most 
commonly reported adverse reactions (≥3% of patients) with upadacitinib 45 mg, 30 mg or 15 mg 
were upper respiratory tract infection (19.9%), blood CPK increased (7.6%), acne (6.3%), 
neutropaenia (6.0%), rash (5.2%), herpes zoster (4.4%), hypercholesterolemia (4.0%), folliculitis 
(3.6%), herpes simplex (3.2%), and influenza (3.2%).
The frequencies are the highest frequencies observed in the induction or maintenance phases for the 
UPA 15 mg, UPA 30 mg or UPA 45 mg dose which was considered acceptable.
Prolonged induction
In patients receiving a prolonged induction, the rates of herpes zoster and increased liver enzymes was 
higher during week 0-16 than during week 0-8. These are the most serious concerns with the 
prolonged induction, in the short term. 
The prolonged induction should only be used for patients who do not achieve adequate therapeutic 
benefit by week 8, i.e., where there is a clear clinical need for more intense treatment. In these 
patients, the safety of this regimen can be considered acceptable and guidance is adequately reflected 
in the SmPC.
Deaths and serious adverse events
There were two deaths reported in the original submission, one in the UPA 15 mg arm and one in the 
UPA 30 mg arm. The first case (opioid overdose with anoxic brain injury) is considered unrelated to 
upadacitinib treatment. In the other case (pancreatic cancer), causality is possible but cannot be firmly 
concluded. Malignancy is listed as important potential risk in the RMP and will be further studied with 
the data from the ongoing PASS studies (see 2.7. ).
In the all-treated dataset, the frequency of SAEs was higher in the placebo group than in the 
upadacitinib groups. SAEs reported as infections were more frequent in the upadacitinib arms. These 
include COVID-19 and herpes zoster. There were 4 cases of malignancy reported in the UPA 30 mg 
group: 2 basal cell carcinoma and 2 cervical dysplasia. Malignancies are further discussed below.
At CHMP’s request, the MAH presented un update of the available safety data from study M14-234 to 
date. This include one new death due to COVID-19 and pulmonary embolism reported in a patient 
receiving updacitinib 30 mg. Apart from this, there were no new safety signals identified.
Adverse events of special interest
During the induction phase, serious infections occurred with a similar frequency in the placebo and UPA 
45 mg groups. During the maintenance phase, the frequency of serious infections was similar in UPA 
15 mg and 30 mg groups, and more frequent in the placebo group. In the all-treated dataset, the EAIR 
of serious infections was slightly higher in the upadacitinib groups, but no dose-dependency was 
observed. No new safety signals were observed.
There were no reports of hepatitis B reactivation in the UC studies. Patients with hepatitis B infection 
were excluded from the study. There is a recommendation in section 4.4 of the SmPC to screen for 
hepatitis B before start of Rinvoq treatment. This is acceptable.
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022
Page 150/195
Opportunistic infections excluding TB and herpes zoster occurred with a similar frequency in the 
upadacitinib and placebo groups during the induction phase, and were more frequent in the placebo 
group during the maintenance phase. No dose-dependent risk was observed.
In the upadacitinib UC studies, herpes zoster vaccination was not mandatory and 3.7% of subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of upadacitinib indicated a prior history of zoster vaccination. During the 
induction phase, there were 4 cases of herpes zoster, all in the UPA 45 mg arm. Among these was one 
case of disseminated herpes zoster. Of concern, during the prolonged induction phase, the EAIR 
increased from 5.0 E/100PYs to 15.3E/100PYs. All events involved only 1 dermatome, and none were 
serious. The increased risk for herpes zoster is considered manageable through herpes zoster 
vaccination as recommended in the SmPC. 
During the maintenance phase, there were five serious cases of HZ reported, all in the upadacitinib 
arms. These include Bell’s palsy and HZ meningitis. Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to 
reflect this information.
One case of active TB was reported in a patient switching from placebo to upadacitinib 15 mg in the 
long-term extension phase. Of note, he was found to have latent TB but did not receive TB treatment 
as recommended. Although it is a serious case, the SmPC includes clear recommendations for TB 
screening and treatment of latent TB before initiating upadacitinib treatment. This is considered 
sufficient.
There were 3 gastrointestinal perforations reported, 2 in subjects receiving placebo and 1 in a subject 
receiving upadacitinib 15 mg (due to a complication of a routine study colonoscopy). No SmPC updates 
were considered needed.
The EAIR for malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) was lower in the UPA 15 mg 
group than in the placebo group. Of some concern, there is a dose-dependent increase in EAIR; 
however, the number of malignancies were few hampering firm conclusions. It is agreed with the MAH 
that the there is no specific pattern observed with regards to type of malignancy. Also regarding 
NMSC, it is of concern that the EAIR is higher for the UPA 30 mg group. The SmPC includes the 
following text in section 4.4: NMSCs have been reported in patients treated with upadacitinib. Periodic 
skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer. This is 
considered acceptable.
There were no cases of MACE reported in the UPA 15 mg group, and 3 cases in the UPA 30 mg group.  
A dose-dependency is observed; however, the total number of cases are few (n=3 in the UPA 30 mg 
group) hampering firm conclusions.
Regarding venous thromboembolism (VTE), there is a current class effect warning in section 4.4. 
During the induction phase, there was one VTE case reported in the placebo and UPA 15 mg arms, 
respectively. Throughout the whole study, the EAIR for VTE was slightly higher for the UPA 15 mg 
(0.6E/100PYs) and UPA 30 mg groups (0.5E/100PYs) than for the placebo group (0 cases).
The MAH argues that no upadacitinib dose relationship in the rates of adjudicated VTE and patterns in 
the time to onset of the events was observed, and that all subjects who experienced VTE receiving 
upadacitinib had at least 1 risk factor identified for thrombosis (e.g., including underlying UC or other 
risk factors). The argumentation is followed, but not completely supported. UC as a risk factor applies 
to all patients in the studies and should not explain the difference between the UPA and placebo arms 
in a randomised trial. When looking at the narratives, there are also cases without underlying risk 
factors.  At the CHMP’s request, the MAH presented a thorough discussion on the need to update 
section 4.8 to include VTE as an adverse event for Rinvoq, and concluded that an update was not 
warranted. The MAH clarified that in most cases, there were risk factors for VTE other than UC, and 
that the overall rates of adjudicated VTE in the upadacitinib UC program did not appear higher than the 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022
Page 151/195
anticipated background rate in the UC population. The observed difference in frequency between 
Rinvoq and placebo was based on very few cases. Further, no dose dependency was observed. The 
CHMP agreed that the inclusion of VTE as an adverse drug reaction is not warranted at present. 
However, this risk will be further assessed within the on-going JAK inhibitor referral procedure 
(EMEA/H/A-20/1517).
In the latest PSUR, there were higher number of PTs reporting various fractures with upadacitinib in 
comparison with active comparator or placebo in clinical trials. At CHMP’s request, the MAH presented 
all cases of fractures occurring in the UC studies, including frequencies and exposure-adjusted 
incidence rates for upadacitinib and placebo respectively. Furthermore, exposure-adjusted incidence 
rates in pooled data from all upadacitinib clinical studies was requested. When assessing the risk for 
fractures, the following needs to be taken into consideration:

The risk for fractures might differ across indications, with patients with high inflammatory 
burden and/or concomitant use of steroids (i.e. RA and PsA populations) are at high risk for 
fractures. While the AS population might possibly be less confounded by concomitant 
corticosteroid treatment, on the other hand the more fragile RA and PsA population might be 
more sensitive to detect possible differences in fracture rates. 

The placebo-controlled period of the studies were normally around 3 months, and the risk for 
fractures might increase over time since entry of the study. Therefore, comparisons with this 
short placebo-controlled period, even if using exposure adjusted figures, are not the most 
reliable comparisons in this case but rather the active comparator data which is obtained 
during longer time periods within the studies (i.e. MTX in study M13-545 and adalimumab in 
study M14-465 and M14-572).
When looking at these studies with active comparators throughout the full study, it is noted that in RA 
study M13-545, the risk for fractures was higher for MTX than for upadacitinib (both 15 and 30 mg). In 
RA study M14-465, on the other hand, the risk was higher for upadacitinib 15 mg than for 
adalimumab. A similar pattern was observed in PsA study M14-572, where a dose-dependent increase 
in the risk for fracture was observed for upadacitinib, with EAIRs for both strengths of upadacitinib 
being higher than the EAIR for adalimumab. 
Although there are some signals from the RA and PsA data indicating a higher risk for fractures for 
upadacitinib compared to adalimumab, the increased risk is not consistent across indications and 
compared to other comparators (placebo in the UC study and MTX in the RA study). It should be noted 
that stress fractures are included in section 4.8 of the SmPC of methotrexate-containing products 
which adds some uncertainty to the reliability of this comparison. Overall, the CHMP concluded that 
there is not enough evidence to conclude on a causal relation between upadacitinib and fractures. 
However, fracture has been added to the list of important potential risk in the RMP. Furthermore, 
additional data will be gained from the proposed post-authorization safety study for AD aiming to 
investigate growth in adolescents receiving upadacitinib. See 2.7. 
Laboratory findings
Liver transaminases increased more in the upadacitinib arms than in the placebo arms. According to 
the MAH, few events were serious and led to study drug discontinuation. Both ALT and AST increases 
are included in the SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8. Also, monitoring recommendations (although not very 
specific) are included in section 4.2. This is considered acceptable.
Anaemia is a known AE for upadacitinib, and monitoring recommendation and dose interruption 
recommendations are included in the SmPC. A decrease in neutrophil levels was observed during the 
first 4 weeks of the study, with quite stable levels thereafter. Neutropenia is a known risk with Rinvoq 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022
Page 152/195
treatment, and no SmPC updates are considered needed. The MAH proposed to add lymphopenia to 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. This was considered acceptable (see above).
According to the MAH, small mean increases in serum creatinine, which were not considered clinically 
meaningful, were observed with upadacitinib treatment, while grade 3 increases in serum creatinine 
and TEAEs of renal dysfunction were infrequent. The CHMP agreed that no SmPC updates are needed.
Regarding lipids, the MAH proposed to include additional text in the SmPC section 4.8 which was 
accepted by the CHMP after some modifications in the wording.
Vital signs
Increased diastolic blood pressure was observed in a higher percentage of subjects with upadacitinib 
45 mg (3.1%) vs. placebo (1.9%) during induction. With maintenance treatment, both systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure increases were observed in a higher percentage of subjects with upadacitinib 
30 mg, while no difference was seen between upadacitinib 15 mg and placebo.
ECG
In the concentration-QTc analysis from the original MAA, the exposures are limited with respect to the 
subpopulation with moderate HI (2.4.4. ). However, overall the preclinical, PK and clinical data do not 
raise any concern that Rinvoq would have a QT prolongating effect with the exposures reached with a 
45 mg QD ER treatment. 
Safety in special populations
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) who received upadacitinib 45 mg induction treatment and 
upadacitinib 30 mg as maintenance treatment showed higher rates of SAEs, TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug, and herpes zoster compared to the lower maintenance dose and/or 
younger population. Therefore, a 15 mg dose is recommended in this population which was considered 
acceptable. Section 4.2 of the SmPC states that, for ulcerative colitis, doses higher than 15 mg once 
daily for maintenance therapy are not recommended in patients aged 65 years and older. In addition, 
Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC reflect that there is an increased risk of adverse reactions with the 
upadacitinib dose of 30 mg once daily in patients aged 65 years and older. At the CHMP’s request, it is 
also reflected in this section that the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib in patients aged 75 and older 
have not yet been established.
In patients with renal impairment, the proportion of patients with AEs increased with decreasing GFR 
during the induction phase, both in the upadacitinib and placebo groups. No specific pattern was 
observed during the maintenance phase. For patients with severe renal impairment, a 30 mg induction 
dose and a 15 mg maintenance dose is recommended. This is acceptable and adequately reflected in 
the SmPC. 
Upadacitinib is contraindicated during pregnancy. As of 31 May 2021, there were a total of 93 
pregnancies reported in female subjects in upadacitinib clinical studies. No congenital anomalies were 
identified.
15 vs 30 mg as maintenance dose
In the RA studies which led to the approval of upadacitinib 15 mg, a less favourable safety profile was 
observed for the 30 mg dose (n=1204 patients) than for the 15 mg dose (n=1213 patients). This 
included serious infections, opportunistic infections, herpes zoster, malignancy, MACE, and deaths. 
In the UC studies, it is not obvious that the 30 mg dose is associated with a less favourable safety 
outcome. Although the frequency of overall AEs was higher for the 30 mg dose, SAEs occurred more 
frequently in the 15 mg arm. There was one death in each of the 15 and 30 mg arms. With regards to 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022
Page 153/195
adverse events of special interest, the frequency of serious infections and opportunistic infections were 
similar in both groups, while the frequencies of herpes zoster, malignancy, MACE, and increased liver 
enzymes were higher in the 30 mg group. Thus, in some aspects the 30 mg dose seems less 
favourable, although the trend is not consistent for all safety outcomes. Although it is acknowledged 
there are significant differences between the RA and UC population regarding for example age and 
concomitant medication, safety data from the RA studies are important for this assessment because of 
a larger sample size (~2400 patients in the RA program vs ~600 patients in the pooled “all treated” UC 
population). 
Given the recent concern on potential dose-dependent class effects of the JAK inhibitors which is 
currently being assessed as part of the referral (EMEA/H/A-20/1517), the MAH was requested to 
further justify why the observed effects for the 30 mg dose outweighs the potential risks and to 
provide a clearer guidance in section 4.2 to include a more detailed description on which patients that 
might benefit from the higher 30 mg dose. In their response, the MAH clarified that patients with high 
disease burden (severe disease, pancolitis or extra-intestinal manifestations) as well as patients who 
needed a prolonged induction might benefit from a higher 30 mg maintenance dose, Section 4.2 of the 
SmPC was revised accordingly. This was considered acceptable to the SmPC, see also 2.6.6. 
The safety of upadacitinib 15 and 30 mg has been characterised in previous studies in the RA, psoriatic 
arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and atopic dermatitis indications. Safety data for the 45 mg induction 
dose is more limited, since it is currently not approved for any indication and data are limited to the 
719 upadacitinib-treated patients in the UC inductions studies. Safety data for the prolonged 16-week 
induction is even more scarce, since only 127 patients received this regimen in the UC studies. 
Overall, long-term data for upadacitinib are still limited, since upadacitinib was first approved in 2019. 
Interim long-term data through Week 156 from the RA studies have recently been assessed within 
variation II/14. Long-term data from the UC studies needs to be submitted post approval. This is 
particularly important with regards to the risk for malignancy, since patients with UC are at increased 
risk for malignancy. The long-term extension study M14 533 is included in the RMP with final report in 
2026, as well as an observational long-term safety study of upadacitinib use in UC patients. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.
2.6.3.  Conclusions on the clinical safety
In the placebo-controlled ulcerative colitis induction and maintenance clinical trials, the most 
commonly reported adverse reactions (≥3% of patients) with upadacitinib 45 mg, 30 mg or 15 mg 
were upper respiratory tract infection (19.9%), blood CPK increased (7.6%), acne (6.3%), 
neutropaenia (6.0%), rash (5.2%), herpes zoster (4.4%), hypercholesterolemia (4.0%), folliculitis 
(3.6%), herpes simplex (3.2%), and influenza (3.2%).
The overall safety profile observed in patients with ulcerative colitis was generally consistent with that 
observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 
A higher rate of herpes zoster was observed with an induction treatment period of 16 weeks vs 
8 weeks.
Based on the limited data in ulcerative colitis patients aged 65 years and older, there was a higher rate 
of overall adverse reactions with the upadacitinib 30 mg dose compared to the 15 mg dose with 
maintenance treatment.
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022
Page 154/195
Long-term data from the UC studies needs to be submitted post approval. This is particularly important 
with regards to the risk for malignancy, since patients with UC are at increased risk for malignancy. 
The long-term extension study M14 533 is included in the RMP with final report in 2026, as well as an 
observational long-term safety study of upadacitinib use in UC patients.
Based on the safety data submitted as part of this application, the CHMP concluded that the safety of 
upadacitinib 45 mg as induction and 15 mg or 30 mg as maintenance treatment in the ulcerative colitis 
population is considered acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
3.1.1.  Disease or condition
UC is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disease of the large intestine characterized by diffuse and 
continuous inflammation and ulceration of mainly the innermost lining of the colon starting from the 
rectum.  Subjects are typically diagnosed with UC in their 20s or 30s during prime productivity years.  
The hallmark clinical symptoms include abdominal pain, bloody diarrhoea associated with rectal 
urgency and tenesmus with moderate to severe UC having at least 5 bowel movements per day 
frequently associated with blood. The clinical course is marked by exacerbation and remission. Without 
appropriate treatment UC results in profound clinical symptoms requiring physician visits, 
hospitalizations, surgery, all resulting in a decreased quality of life.
The most severe intestinal manifestations of UC which are life threatening and can be fatal are toxic 
megacolon and perforation.  Extraintestinal complications include arthritis (peripheral or axial 
involvement), dermatological conditions (erythema nodosum, aphthous stomatitis, and pyoderma 
gangrenosum), inflammation of the eye (uveitis), and liver dysfunction (primary sclerosing 
cholangitis).  Subjects with UC have a modest increased risk of cancer overall and are at an increased 
risk for colon cancer during the first year after diagnosis. 
Medical therapy is used initially however about 15% of subjects still require surgery due to failure of 
medical therapy to control the disease or development of colonic dysplasia. Subjects with newly 
diagnosed UC have a 5-year colectomy risk of approximately 10 – 35%. The burden of UC on the 
patient and healthcare system remains high (physician visits and hospitalization) reflecting the need 
for better management of this disease. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
The therapeutic goal in UC is to induce and maintain a long-term corticosteroid-free remission.  
Corticosteroids while effective for induction cannot be used long-term due to toxicities, thus as new 
systemic therapies are developed, they should be effective without the need for long-term 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022
Page 180/195
corticosteroids.  Conventional therapies such as immunomodulators may be effective for maintenance 
but have no role in induction and may require monitoring of leucocytes and hepatic function. TNF 
inhibitors are effective for both induction and maintenance; however, have been associated with 
serious infections and malignancies.  Over the past decade, there is an emerging need for new 
therapies for subjects who have previously experienced inadequate efficacy or intolerance to TNF 
inhibitors.  Recently approved therapies for moderate to severe UC have incorporated study 
populations including subjects with inadequate response to TNF inhibitors and/or inadequate response 
to conventional therapies.

Vedolizumab is an anti-integrin recommended by American Gastroenterological Association 
(AGA) for subjects naïve to biologic agents. GEMINI included a population of approximately 1/3 
previously treated with anti-TNFs. Clinical remission (rate of 41.8% for vedolizumab) and 
endoscopic improvement rates (rate of 52% for vedolizumab) for vedolizumab were 26% and 
32% higher than placebo at Week 52.

Ustekinumab is an inhibitor of IL-12 and IL-23 and recommended by AGA following infliximab 
failure.  UNIFI included a population of approximately 50% who failed at least 1 biologic. 
Clinical remission (rate of 43.8% for ustekinumab) and endoscopic improvement rates (rate of 
51.1% for ustekinumab) for ustekinumab were 19% and 20% higher than placebo at Week 44.

Tofacitinib (JAK inhibitor) is indicated in the EU after failure or intolerance to conventional 
therapy or biologics, whereas in the US it is indicated after failure of TNF inhibitors.  OCTAVE 
included a population of approximately 50% who previously failed or were intolerant to TNF 
blockers. Clinical remission (rate of 34% for tofacitinib) and endoscopic improvement rates 
(rate of 37% for tofacitinib) for tofacitinib (5 mg twice daily) were 23% and 24% higher than 
placebo at Week 52.

Filgotinib is an oral JAK1 inhibitor with high in vitro functional specificity for kinases 1 over 2 
and is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active 
ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were 
intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent.
 Ozanimod (sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator) is currently approved in the US only, 
for the treatment of moderate to severe UC. The Phase 3 study population included 30% of 
subjects who had previously failed or were intolerant to TNF blockers and of these subjects, 
63% received at least two biologics including TNF blockers.  Clinical remission (rate of 37% for 
ozanimod) and endoscopic improvement rates (rate of 46% for ozanimod) for ozanimod were 
19% and 19% higher than placebo at Week 52.
While the recent approvals of multiple therapies for UC (vedolizumab, ustekinumab, tofacitinib, etc.) 
are encouraging, clinical trial remission rates for both induction and maintenance treatment in UC 
remain limited with up to 18% of subjects achieving clinical remission during induction and up to 44% 
achieving clinical remission during maintenance. In addition, each has risks and challenges for some 
patients. Therefore, additional therapeutic options are needed. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies
The global clinical development program includes a Phase 2b dose-ranging induction study (Study 
M14-234 Substudy 1), two Phase 3 induction studies (Study M14-675 and Study M14-234 Substudy 
2), a Phase 3 maintenance study (Study M14 234 Substudy 3), and a Phase 3 long-term extension 
study (Study M14-533).
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022
Page 181/195
The dose finding study (M14-234 Substudy 1) was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 4 
oral doses of upadacitinib (7.5 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg) compared to placebo as 8-week 
induction therapy in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. The study duration included a 
Screening Period of up to 5 weeks and an 8-week double-blind (DB) Induction Period.
The pivotal induction studies (Study M14-675 and Study M14-234 Substudy 2) were phase 3, 
randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo controlled, multicenter studies designed to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of oral administration of upadacitinib 45 mg compared to placebo as induction 
therapy for up to 16 weeks. The studies included a Screening Period of up to 5 weeks  followed by a 
placebo controlled part with a duration of 8 weeks where patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 
receive Upadacitinib 45 mg once daily or placebo. The studies also included a second part were 
patients who did not achieve a clinical response at week 8 received Upadacitinib 45 mg open label for 
additional 8 weeks. 
Subjects who completed either one of the three studies (M14-234 substudy 1, M14-234 substudy 2 or 
study M14-675) and achieved a clinical response per adapted mayo score at week 8 (or week 16) were 
rerandomized into the Maintenance Study (Study M14 234 Substudy 3). Clinical response per adopted 
mayo score was defined as a decrease from baseline in the Adapted Mayo score ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% 
from baseline, PLUS a decrease in RBS ≥ 1 or an absolute RBS ≤ 1. The subjects were randomized into 
four different cohorts depending on the treatment received in the induction studies, however the 
primary analysis for the main result were conducted in a subgroup of these patients who were 
randomized to either 15 mg or 30 mg upadacitinib or placebo. 
Eligible subjects in the study were 16-75 years old with an active UC with an Adapted Mayo score of  5 
to 9 points and endoscopic subscore of 2 to 3. The patients should have demonstrated an inadequate 
response, loss of response, or intolerance to at least one of the following treatments including, oral 
aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants and/or biologic therapies.
Primary efficacy endpoint was clinical remission per adapted mayo score, a composite endpoint. To 
achieve the primary endpoint “clinical remission per adapted mayo score” the patient must have a 
stool frequency score (SFS) ≤1 and not greater than baseline, a rectal bleeding score (RBS) of 0, and 
endoscopic subscore ≤ 1 (with no friability).
A total of 988 patients were included in the analysis of the induction studies (319 and 341 Upadacitinib 
45 mg patients and 154 respective 174 placebo patients. In the maintenance study 451 patients were 
included in the analysis  (148 upadacitinib 15 mg, 154 Upadacitinib 30 mg and 149 placebo). Prior 
treatment failure to at least 1 biologic therapy was seen in around 50% of the patients.
3.2.  Favourable effects
In the induction studies, the primary endpoint clinical remission per adapted mayo score at week 8 was 
reached in 83/319 (26.1%) and 114/341 (33.5%) in the Upadacitinib 45 mg groups and 7/154 (4.8%) 
and 7/174 (4.1%) in the placebo groups. The between group difference was 21.6 % (95% CI 15.8, 
27.4 p<0.001) and 29.0% (95% CI 23.2, 34.7, p<0.001) in the M14-234 substudy 2 and the M14-675 
study respectively.
All ranked key secondary endpoints were significantly in favour of Upadacitinib 45 mg (p<0.001).

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
The study uses an Adapted Mayo Score (Adapted Mayo Score of 5 to 9 and endoscopy subscore of 2 to 
3), excluding the PGA to define patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis for 
inclusion in the study. Although this can be acceptable, no minimal level of symptom burden was 
defined in the study and the relation to the full mayo score previous used in clinical studies are not 
fully explored. Upon request the MAH provided additional information confirming that >99% of the 
patients also fulfilled the full mayo score definition of moderately to severe active disease and that the 
result is valid also in the populations with a clinically relevant symptom burden at baseline. This was 
considered acceptable to the CHMP.
With respect to concomitant UC medications use, the proportions of subjects taking 
immunosuppressive treatment at baseline were few (<2%), and thiopurines (eg azathioprine and 6-
MP) were not allowed during the studies. In addition, the doses of 5-ASA and thiopurines acceptable 
for the patient to have tried before inclusion were low, and no doses for concomitant medication were 
reported, raising a concern of undertreatment in the placebo population. However, upon request  
additional information were provided confirming that baseline concomitant treatment were similar in 
the treatment groups and the SmPC was updated to inform that thiopurine were not allowed during the 
studies. 
The primary endpoint used in the studies “clinical remission per adapted mayo score” is a composite 
endpoint evaluating symptoms and endoscopic features of UC, using 3 parts of the well-known Mayo 
Score, however with exclusion of the Physician global scale. Similar (but not identical) endpoints have 
been used in other studies of approved treatments for UC, however a composite endpoint such as this 
is not in line with the EMA UC GL (CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 rev 1), which states that clinical 
(symptoms) and endoscopic remission should be evaluated as co-primary endpoints to ensure a 
beneficial effect over placebo in both parts. Additional information provided by the MAH confirmed that 
a clinically relevant effect was seen in both clinical symptoms and healing of the mucosa. 
The MAH also suggests additional 8 weeks of 45 mg induction treatment for patients who have not 
achieve a clinical response at week 8. This suggestion is based on the results from the second part of 
the induction studies, were 125 patients who did not achieve a clinical response at week 8 on 45 mg 
Upadacitinib continued to receive the same dose open label for in total 16 weeks. Integrated data from 
the two pivotal induction studies showed that 48.3% of these patients achieved a clinical response per 
Adapted Mayo at Week 16 although only 5.6% achieved clinical remission per adapted Mayo score at 
week 16. Endoscopic response at week 16 were seen in only 14.3% patients. Of the 45 patients that 
continued to the maintenance phase, 8/24 (33.3%) of the patients randomised to 30mg upadacitinib 
and 4/21 (19%) of the patients randomised to 15 mg were in clinical remission at week 52. A majority 
of the patients in need of a prolonged treatment represented a difficult to treat patient population, with 
66.4% of patients previous failed biologics. Since no relevant clinical features could identify the 
patients more likely to respond after a prolonged induction treatment, the MAH’s suggestion to provide 
this for all patients who may require it per the physician's judgment based on the condition of each 
patient was agreed with a cross-reference to available efficacy and safety data in sections 4.8 and 5.1 
of the SmPC. 
Also, although both maintenance doses of Upadacitinib were statistically significantly better than 
placebo, the proportion of patients achieving mucosal healing and endoscopic remission at week 52 
were similar between the two Upadacitinib doses (24.2% and 25.9% in endoscopic remission). 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022
Page 184/195
Additional information regarding corticosteroid free symptomatic remission and corticosteroid free 
endoscopic remission confirmed efficacy in both doses. The MAH clarified that patients with high 
disease burden (severe disease, pancolitis or extra-intestinal manifestations) as well as patients who 
needed a prolonged induction might benefit from a higher 30 mg maintenance dose. At the CHMP 
request, this was adequately reflected in the section 4.2 of the SmPC with a statement that the lowest 
effective dose should be considered.
3.4.  Unfavourable effects
Overview of adverse events
During the placebo-controlled 8-week induction period, the frequency of AEs was 52.6% in the placebo 
group and 55.4% in the UPA 45 mg group. SAEs occurred in 5.8% in the placebo group and 3.1% in 
the UPA group. There were no deaths in either group.
During the maintenance phase, the EAIR of AEs was lower in both UPA groups (UPA 15 mg: 328.4 and 
UPA 30 mg: 320 E/100PYs) than in the placebo group (509E/100PYs). AEs and serious adverse events 
were more frequent in the UPA 15 mg group (AE: 328.4E/100PYs, SAE: 13.2E/100PYs) than in the UPA 
30 mg group (AE: 320 E/100PYs, SAE:10.6 E/100PYs). 
When comparing patients receiving 8-week induction and 16-week induction, the EAIR of AEs were 
equally frequent during the maintenance phase in the 15 mg group (294.4E/100PYs) and 30 mg group 
(297.3E/100 PYs) among patients receiving 8-week induction, however AEs were less frequent in the 
15 mg group (231.2E/100PYs) than in the 30 mg group (337.8E/100 PYs) among patients receiving 
16-week induction. 
In the all analysis set, the EAIR of AEs was slightly lower for the UPA 15 mg group (323.3E/100PYs) 
than for the UPA 30 mg group (364E/100PYs), but SAEs were not more frequent in the higher dose 
group. 
Three new AEs have been included in the table of adverse reactions in Section 4.8 of the SmPC with a 
frequency “common”: lymphopenia, hyperlipidaemia, and rash. 
Common adverse events
Frequent AEs reported more frequently in the UPA than in the placebo group during the induction 
phase were acne, increased CPK, nasopharyngitis, neutropenia, pyrexia, rash, folliculitis and upper 
respiratory tract infection. These are all listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC and does not constitute any 
new safety signals. 
Deaths and serious adverse events
There were two deaths reported, one in the UPA 15 mg arm (opioid overdose with anoxic brain injury) 
and one in the UPA 30 mg arm (pancreatic cancer). One additional death was reported due to COVID-
19 and pulmonary embolism in a patient receiving updacitinib 30 mg.
Adverse events of special interest
During the induction phase, serious infections occurred with a similar frequency in the placebo and UPA 
45 mg groups. During the maintenance phase, the frequency of serious infections was similar in UPA 
15 mg and 30 mg groups, and more frequent in the placebo group. In the all-treated dataset, the EAIR 
of serious infections was slightly higher in the upadacitinib groups, but no dose-dependency was 
observed.
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022
Page 185/195
Opportunistic infections excluding TB and herpes zoster occurred with a similar frequency in the 
upadacitinib and placebo groups during the induction phase, and were more frequent in the placebo 
group during the maintenance phase. No dose-dependent risk was observed.
During the induction phase, there were 4 cases of herpes zoster, all in the UPA 45 mg arm. Among 
these was one case of disseminated herpes zoster. During the prolonged induction phase, the EAIR 
increased from 5.0 E/100PYs to 15.3E/100PYs. During the maintenance phase, there were five serious 
cases of HZ reported, all in the upadacitinib arms. These include Bell’s palsy and HZ meningitis. A 
higher rate of herpes zoster was observed with an induction treatment period of 16 weeks vs 8 weeks. 
This is adequately reflected in the SmPC.
The EAIR for malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) was lower in the UPA 15 mg 
group than in the placebo group. A dose-dependent increase in EAIR is observed, however the number 
of malignancies were few. Also regarding NMSC, the EAIR is higher for the UPA 30 mg group. 
Malignancy is listed as important potential risk in the RMP and will be further studied with the data 
from the ongoing PASS studies (see 2.7. ).
There were no cases of MACE reported in the UPA 15 mg group, and 3 cases in the UPA 30 mg group.  
A dose-dependency is observed; however, the total number of cases are few (n=3 in the UPA 30 mg 
group) hampering firm conclusions.
There were 3 gastrointestinal perforations reported, 2 in subjects receiving placebo and 1 in a subject 
receiving upadacitinib 15 mg (due to a complication of a routine study colonoscopy).
During the induction phase, there was one case of venous thromboembolism (VTE) reported in the 
placebo and UPA 15 mg arms, respectively. Throughout the whole study, the EAIR for VTE was slightly 
higher for the UPA 15 mg (0.6E/100PYs) and UPA 30 mg groups (0.5E/100PYs) than for the placebo 
group (0 cases).
Laboratory findings
Liver transaminases increased more in the upadacitinib arms than in the placebo arms. In patients 
receiving a prolonged induction, the rate of hepatic disorders was higher during week 0-16 than during 
week 0-8. 
A decrease in neutrophil levels was observed during the first 4 weeks of the study, with quite stable 
levels thereafter. The percentage of subjects with TEAEs of lymphopenia was higher in the upadacitinib 
45 mg group (2.5%) compared with the placebo group (0.5%).
According to the MAH, small mean increases in serum creatinine, which were not considered clinically 
meaningful, were observed with upadacitinib treatment, while grade 3 increases in serum creatinine 
and TEAEs of renal dysfunction were infrequent. The CHMP agreed that no SmPC updates are needed.
Regarding lipids, an increase in LDL and HLD levels were observed during upadacitinib treatment.
The CHMP concluded that the overall safety profile observed in patients with ulcerative colitis was 
generally consistent with that observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects
The safety of upadacitinib 15 and 30 mg has been characterised in previous studies in the RA, psoriatic 
arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and atopic dermatitis indications. Safety data for the 45 mg induction 
dose is more limited, since it is currently not approved for any indication and data are limited to the 
719 upadacitinib-treated patients in the UC inductions studies. Safety data for the prolonged 16-week 
induction is even more scarce, since only 127 patients received this regimen in the UC studies. 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022
Page 186/195
Overall, long-term data for upadacitinib are still limited, since upadacitinib was first approved in 2019. 
Interim long-term data through Week 156 from the RA studies have recently been assessed within 
variation II/14. Long-term data from the UC studies needs to be submitted post approval. This is 
particularly important with regards to the risk for malignancy, since patients with UC are at increased 
risk for malignancy. The long-term extension study M14 533 is included in the RMP with final report in 
2026, as well as an observational long-term safety study of upadacitinib use in UC patients. 
Based on the limited data in ulcerative colitis patients aged 65 years and older, there was a higher rate 
of overall adverse reactions with the upadacitinib 30 mg dose compared to the 15 mg dose with 
maintenance treatment. Therefore, a 15 mg dose is recommended in this population which was 
considered acceptable.
There are no data in UC patients aged 75 years and above. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC.
Although there are some signals from the RA and PsA data indicating a higher risk for fractures for 
upadacitinib compared to adalimumab, the increased risk is not consistent across indications and 
compared to other comparators (placebo in the UC study and MTX in the RA study). It should be noted 
that stress fractures are included in section 4.8 of the SmPC of methotrexate-containing products 
which adds some uncertainty to the reliability of this comparison. Overall, the CHMP concluded that 
there is not enough evidence to conclude on a causal relation between upadacitinib and fractures. 
However, fracture has been added to the list of important potential risk in the RMP. Furthermore, 
additional data will be gained from the proposed post-authorization safety study for AD aiming to 
investigate growth in adolescents receiving upadacitinib. See 2.7.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
The two pivotal induction studies demonstrated a clinically relevant and statistically significant 
superiority of Upadacitinib 45 mg compared to placebo in inducing remission in patients with moderate 
to severe ulcerative colitis. A superior efficacy was seen in symptomatic relieve already at week 2, and 
after 8 weeks of induction treatment, >70% of the patients in the Upadacitinib group had achieved a 
clinical response. Also, when assessing endoscopic and histologic features of the mucosa at this early 
timepoint, Upadacitinib provided a beneficial effect compared to placebo regarding the strictest 
endpoint, mucosal healing (endoscopic and histologic remission) in a few patients and 36% 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022
Page 189/195
respectively 44% of the Upadacitinib treated patients had evidence of an endoscopic improvement 
(endoscopic subscore of ≤1), compared with less than 10% of the placebo treated patients. This is an 
important finding. 
In the maintenance study statistically significant (<0.001) and clinically relevant treatment differences 
between both Upadacitinib doses (15 mg and 30 mg) and placebo were observed for the primary and 
all key secondary endpoints. Clinical remission, maintenance of remission and endoscopic improvement 
were achieved by around 42%, 59% and 49% of the upadacitinib 15 mg treated patients at week 52, 
with a treatment difference compared to placebo of >30% in these endpoints. This treatment effect is 
clearly clinically relevant and in line with other approved products with the same indication, although it 
is acknowledged that a formal comparison between products are not possible. In the patients treated 
with 30 mg upadacitinib, clinical remission, maintenance of remission and endoscopic improvement 
were achieved by an even higher proportion of patients, around 52%, 70% and 62%, however the 
proportion of patients achieving endoscopic remission at week 52 were similar between the two 
upadacitinib doses (24.2% and 25.9%). Especially in patients with a high disease burden and in 
patients in need of a prolonged induction regimen, the 30 mg dose seemed to provide a more 
pronounced beneficial effect over the 15 mg dose.     
The safety profile of Rinvoq has been well characterised through studies in the currently approved 
indications. Also the safety profile of the recently proposed 45 mg induction dose is considered 
acceptable, since during the placebo-controlled induction phase the frequency of AEs and SAEs were 
less frequent among upadacitinib-treated patients than among placebo-treated patients. There are 
some concerns on the prolonged 16-week induction, primarily because an increased short-term risk for 
herpes zoster, and an increased long-term risk for serious infections, CPK elevation and anaemia. At 
CHMP’s request, adequate guidance and information were provided in the SmPC.
Regarding the long-term risks, special attention is needed regarding the risk for malignancy since 
patients with UC are at increased risk for malignancy. Long-term data will be important for further 
understanding of this risk. This is adequately captured in the RMP.
The trade-off between the benefits and the risks with the 30 mg maintenance dose was discussed 
during the assessment. Although this dose is currently approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, 
there were concerns that the additional benefits gained with the 30 mg dose compared to the 15 mg 
dose in the current indication did not outweigh the potential risks with this higher dose. Previous 
experience from the RA studies have shown a dose-dependent risk for serious infections, opportunistic 
infections, herpes zoster, malignancy, MACE, and deaths. Since then, we have gained more knowledge 
on the safety of JAK inhibitors, indicating a possible dose-dependent risk for in particular MACE. With 
that data at hand, it seems reasonable to strive for the lowest effective dose. Although the 30 mg dose 
might be acceptable in certain selected patients, the 15 mg dose is probably sufficient for most 
patients. At the CHMP’s request, the SmPC has been updated to indicate that the lowest effective dose 
for maintenance should be considered and that the 30 mg dose once daily may be appropriate for 
some patients, such as those with high disease burden or requiring 16-week induction treatment or 
patients who do not show adequate therapeutic benefit to 15 mg once daily.
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks
The two pivotal induction studies demonstrated a clinically relevant and statistically significant 
superiority of Upadacitinib 45 mg compared to placebo in inducing remission in patients with moderate 
to severe ulcerative colitis after 8 weeks of induction treatment.  A prolonged induction for additional 8 
week (in total 16 week) may be useful for patients without an initial response, but the safety concerns 
Assessment report 
EMA/575056/2022
Page 190/195
regarding e.g. herpes zoster should be taken into consideration and the treatment should be stopped if 
no response is seen at week 16.
In the maintenance study statistically significant (<0.001) and clinically relevant treatment differences 
between both Upadacitinib doses (15 mg and 30 mg) and placebo were observed for the primary and 
all key secondary endpoints at week 52. The additional beneficial effect seen with the higher 30 mg 
dose could be of clinical importance in some patients, and the SmPC has been updated to include a 
statement that the lowest effective dose for maintenance should be considered. 
The CHMP concluded that the efficacy data was adequate to support the new strength of 45mg and the 
new indication in the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis 
who have had an inadequate response, lost response or were intolerant to either conventional therapy 
or a biologic agent.
The following dosing recommendations were endorsed by the CHMP:
Induction
The recommended induction dose of upadacitinib is 45 mg once daily for 8 weeks. For patients who do 
not achieve adequate therapeutic benefit by week 8, upadacitinib 45 mg once daily may be continued 
for an additional 8 weeks (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). Upadacitinib should be discontinued in any 
patient who shows no evidence of therapeutic benefit by week 16.
Maintenance
The recommended maintenance dose of upadacitinib is 15 mg or 30 mg once daily based on individual 
patient presentation:
•
A dose of 30 mg once daily may be appropriate for some patients, such as those with high 
disease burden or requiring 16 week induction treatment.
•
A dose of 30 mg once daily may be appropriate for patients who do not show adequate 
therapeutic benefit to 15 mg once daily.
•
The lowest effective dose for maintenance should be considered.
The overall safety profile observed in patients with ulcerative colitis was generally consistent with that 
observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 
Long-term data from the UC studies needs to be submitted post approval. This is particularly important 
with regards to the risk for malignancy, since patients with UC are at increased risk for malignancy. 
The long-term extension study M14-533 is included in the RMP with final report in 1Q 2025 , as well as 
an observational long-term safety study of upadacitinib use in UC patients.
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance
EMA’s safety committee, PRAC, has started a review of the safety of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors used 
to treat several chronic inflammatory disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis). Rinvoq is part of the 
products reviewed in the on-going referral. The review of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of 
inflammatory disorders has been initiated at the request of the European Commission (EC) under 
Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
The recommendation on the present application is without prejudice to the final conclusions of the 
ongoing referral procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 resulting from 
pharmacovigilance data.

3.8.  Conclusions
The overall benefit/risk balance of RINVOQ is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’.
4.  Recommendations

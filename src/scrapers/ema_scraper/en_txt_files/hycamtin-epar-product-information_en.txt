CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Topotecan monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of: 
• 
• 
patients with metastatic carcinoma of the ovary after failure of first-line or subsequent therapy. 
patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) for whom re-treatment with the first-line 
regimen is not considered appropriate (see section 5.1). 
Topotecan in combination with cisplatin is indicated for patients with carcinoma of the cervix 
recurrent after radiotherapy and for patients with Stage IVB disease. Patients with prior exposure to 
cisplatin require a sustained treatment-free interval to justify treatment with the combination (see 
section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
The use of topotecan should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. Topotecan should only be administered under the supervision of a physician 
experienced in the use of chemotherapy (see section 6.6). 
Posology 
When topotecan is used in combination with cisplatin, the full prescribing information for cisplatin 
should be consulted.

Prior to administration of the first course of topotecan, patients must have a baseline neutrophil count 
of ≥1.5 x 109/l, a platelet count of ≥100 x 109/l and a haemoglobin level of ≥9 g/dl (after transfusion if 
necessary). 
Ovarian and small cell lung carcinoma 
Initial dose 
The recommended dose of topotecan is 1.5 mg/m2 body surface area per day administered by 
intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily for five consecutive days with a three-week interval 
between the start of each course. If well tolerated, treatment may continue until disease progression 
(see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
Subsequent doses 
Topotecan should not be re-administered unless the neutrophil count is ≥1 x 109/l, the platelet count is 
≥100 x 109/l, and the haemoglobin level is ≥9 g/dl (after transfusion if necessary). 
Standard oncology practice for the management of neutropenia is either to administer topotecan with 
other medicinal products (e.g. G-CSF) or to reduce the dose to maintain neutrophil counts. 
If dose reduction is chosen for patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil count 
<0.5 x 109/l) for seven days or more or severe neutropenia associated with fever or infection, or who 
have had treatment delayed due to neutropenia, the dose should be reduced by 0.25 mg/m2/day to 
1.25 mg/m2/day (or subsequently down to 1.0 mg/m2/day if necessary). 
Doses should be similarly reduced if the platelet count falls below 25 x 109/l. In clinical studies, 
topotecan was discontinued if the dose had been reduced to 1.0 mg/m2/day and a further dose 
reduction was required to manage adverse effects. 
Cervical carcinoma 
Initial dose 
The recommended dose of topotecan is 0.75 mg/m2/day administered as a 30-minute intravenous 
infusion on days 1, 2 and 3. Cisplatin is administered as an intravenous infusion on day 1 at a dose of 
50 mg/m2/day and following the topotecan dose. This treatment schedule is repeated every 21 days for 
six courses or until progressive disease. 
Subsequent doses 
Topotecan should not be re-administered unless the neutrophil count is ≥1.5 x 109/l, the platelet count 
is ≥100 x 109/l, and the haemoglobin level is ≥9 g/dl (after transfusion if necessary). 
Standard oncology practice for the management of neutropenia is either to administer topotecan with 
other medicinal products (e.g. G-CSF) or to reduce the dose to maintain neutrophil counts. 
If dose reduction is chosen for patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil count 
<0.5 x 109/l) for seven days or more or severe neutropenia associated with fever or infection, or who 
have had treatment delayed due to neutropenia, the dose should be reduced by 20% to 0.60 mg/m2/day 
for subsequent courses (or subsequently down to 0.45 mg/m2/day if necessary). 
Doses should be similarly reduced if the platelet count falls below 25 x 109/l. 
Special populations 
Patients with renal impairment 
Monotherapy (ovarian and small cell lung carcinoma): 
There is insufficient experience with the use of topotecan in patients with severely impaired renal 
function (creatinine clearance <20 ml/min). Use of topotecan in this group of patients is not 
recommended (see section 4.4). 
Limited data indicate that the dose should be reduced in patients with moderate renal impairment. The 
recommended monotherapy dose of topotecan in patients with ovarian or small cell lung carcinoma 
and a creatinine clearance between 20 and 39 ml/min is 0.75 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Combination therapy (cervical carcinoma): 
In clinical studies with topotecan in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of cervical cancer, 
therapy was only initiated in patients with serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl. If, during 
topotecan/cisplatin combination therapy, serum creatinine exceeds 1.5 mg/dl, it is recommended that 
the full prescribing information be consulted for any advice on cisplatin dose reduction/continuation. 
If cisplatin is discontinued, there are insufficient data regarding continuing monotherapy with 
topotecan in patients with cervical cancer. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
A small number of hepatically impaired patients (serum bilirubin between 1.5 and 10 mg/dl) were 
given intravenous topotecan at 1.5 mg/m2/day for five days every three weeks. A reduction in 
topotecan clearance was observed. However, there are insufficient data available to make a dose 
recommendation for this patient group (see section 4.4). 
There is insufficient experience with the use of topotecan in patients with severely impaired hepatic 
function (serum bilirubin ≥10 mg/dl) due to cirrhosis. Topotecan is not recommended to be used in 
this patient group (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
Currently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology 
can be made. 
Method of administration 
Topotecan must be reconstituted and further diluted before use (see section 6.6). 
4.3  Contraindications 
− 
− 
− 
Severe hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
Severe bone marrow depression prior to starting first course, as evidenced by baseline 
neutrophils <1.5 x 109/l and/or a platelet count of <100 x 109/l. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Haematological toxicity is dose-related and full blood count including platelets should be determined 
regularly (see section 4.2). 
As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan can cause severe myelosuppression. 
Myelosuppression leading to sepsis and fatalities due to sepsis have been reported in patients treated 
with topotecan (see section 4.8). 
Topotecan-induced neutropenia can cause neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis have 
been reported in clinical studies with topotecan. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia and a 
compatible pattern of abdominal pain, the possibility of neutropenic colitis should be considered. 
Topotecan has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of which have been 
fatal (see section 4.8). Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, 
thoracic exposure to radiation and use of pneumotoxic substances and/or colony stimulating factors. 
Patients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD (e.g. cough, fever, dyspnoea 
and/or hypoxia), and topotecan should be discontinued if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 
Topotecan monotherapy and topotecan in combination with cisplatin are commonly associated with 
clinically relevant thrombocytopenia. This should be taken into account when prescribing 
HYCAMTIN, e.g. if patients at increased risk of tumour bleeds are considered for therapy. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As would be expected, patients with poor performance status (PS >1) have a lower response rate and 
an increased incidence of complications such as fever, infection and sepsis (see section 4.8). Accurate 
assessment of performance status at the time therapy is given is important, to ensure that patients have 
not deteriorated to PS 3. 
There is insufficient experience of the use of topotecan in patients with severely impaired renal 
function (creatinine clearance <20 ml/min) or severely impaired hepatic function (serum bilirubin 
≥10 mg/dl) due to cirrhosis. Use of topotecan in these patient groups is not recommended (see 
section 4.2). 
A small number of hepatically impaired patients (serum bilirubin between 1.5 and 10 mg/dl) were 
given intravenous topotecan at 1.5 mg/m2/day for five days every three weeks. A reduction in 
topotecan clearance was observed. However, there are insufficient data available to make a dose 
recommendation for this patient group (see section 4.2). 
Hycamtin contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium free”. However, if a solution of common salt (0.9% w/v sodium chloride solution) is used for 
the dilution of Hycamtin prior to administration then the dose of sodium received would be higher. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No in vivo human pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been performed. 
Topotecan does not inhibit human P450 enzymes (see section 5.2). In a population study using the 
intravenous route, the co-administration of granisetron, ondansetron, morphine or corticosteroids did 
not appear to have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of total topotecan (active and inactive 
form). 
When combining topotecan with other chemotherapy agents, reduction of the doses of each medicinal 
product may be required to improve tolerability. However, when combining with platinum agents, 
there is a distinct sequence-dependent interaction depending on whether the platinum agent is given on 
day 1 or 5 of the topotecan dosing. If either cisplatin or carboplatin is given on day 1 of the topotecan 
dosing, a lower dose of each agent must be given to improve tolerability compared to the dose of each 
agent which can be given if the platinum agent is given on day 5 of the topotecan dosing. 
When topotecan (0.75 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days) and cisplatin (60 mg/m2/day on day 1) were 
administered in 13 patients with ovarian cancer, a slight increase in AUC (12%, n = 9) and Cmax (23%, 
n = 11) was noted on day 5. This increase is considered unlikely to be of clinical relevance. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females 
Topotecan has been shown to cause embryo-foetal lethality and malformations in preclinical studies 
(see section 5.3). As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan may cause foetal harm and 
therefore women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during 
therapy with topotecan. 
As with all cytotoxic chemotherapy, patients being treated with topotecan must be advised that they or 
their partner must use an effective method of contraception. 
Pregnancy 
If topotecan is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during therapy with 
topotecan, the patient must be warned of the potential hazards to the foetus. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
Topotecan is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). Although it is not known whether 
topotecan is excreted in human breast milk, breast-feeding should be discontinued at the start of 
therapy. 
Fertility 
No effects on male or female fertility have been observed in reproductive toxicity studies in rats (see 
section 5.3). However, as with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan is genotoxic and effects 
on fertility, including male fertility, cannot be excluded. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, 
caution should be observed when driving or operating machines if fatigue and asthenia persist. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
In dose-finding studies involving 523 patients with relapsed ovarian cancer and 631 patients with 
relapsed small cell lung cancer, the dose-limiting toxicity of topotecan monotherapy was found to be 
haematological. Toxicity was predictable and reversible. There were no signs of cumulative 
haematological or non-haematological toxicity. 
The safety profile of topotecan when given in combination with cisplatin in the cervical cancer clinical 
studies is consistent with that seen with topotecan monotherapy. The overall haematological toxicity is 
lower in patients treated with topotecan in combination with cisplatin compared to topotecan 
monotherapy, but higher than with cisplatin alone. 
Additional adverse events were seen when topotecan was given in combination with cisplatin; 
however, these events were seen with cisplatin monotherapy and were not attributable to topotecan. 
The prescribing information for cisplatin should be consulted for a full list of adverse events 
associated with cisplatin use. 
The integrated safety data for topotecan monotherapy are presented below. 
Adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and absolute frequency (all reported events). 
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon

The adverse events listed above have the potential to occur with a higher frequency in patients who 
have a poor performance status (see section 4.4). 
The frequencies associated with the haematological and non-haematological adverse events listed 
below represent the adverse event reports considered to be related/possibly related to topotecan 
therapy. 
Haematological 
Neutropenia 
Severe (neutrophil count <0.5 x 109/l) during course 1 in 55% of patients, with duration ≥ seven days 
in 20%, and overall in 77% of patients (39% of courses). In association with severe neutropenia, fever 
or infection occurred in 16% of patients during course 1 and overall in 23% of patients (6% of 
courses). Median time to onset of severe neutropenia was nine days and the median duration was 
seven days. Severe neutropenia lasted beyond seven days in 11% of courses overall. Among all 
patients treated in clinical studies (including both those with severe neutropenia and those who did not 
develop severe neutropenia), 11% (4% of courses) developed fever and 26% (9% of courses) 
developed infection. In addition, 5% of all patients treated (1% of courses) developed sepsis (see 
section 4.4). 
Thrombocytopenia 
Severe (platelets <25 x 109/l) in 25% of patients (8% of courses); moderate (platelets between 25.0 and 
50.0 x 109/l) in 25% of patients (15% of courses). Median time to onset of severe thrombocytopenia 
was day 15 and the median duration was five days. Platelet transfusions were given in 4% of courses. 
Reports of significant sequelae associated with thrombocytopenia, including fatalities due to tumour 
bleeds, have been infrequent. 
Anaemia 
Moderate to severe (Hb ≤8.0 g/dl) in 37% of patients (14% of courses). Red cell transfusions were 
given in 52% of patients (21% of courses). 
Non-haematological 
Frequently reported non-haematological effects were gastrointestinal, such as nausea (52%), vomiting 
(32%), diarrhoea (18%), constipation (9%) and mucositis (14%). The incidence of severe (Grade 3 or 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4) nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and mucositis was 4, 3, 2 and 1%, respectively. 
Mild abdominal pain was reported in 4% of patients. 
Fatigue was observed in approximately 25% and asthenia in 16% of patients receiving topotecan. 
Severe (Grade 3 or 4) fatigue and asthenia both occurred with an incidence of 3%. 
Total or pronounced alopecia was observed in 30% of patients and partial alopecia in 15% of patients. 
Other severe events that were recorded as related or possibly related to topotecan treatment were 
anorexia (12%), malaise (3%) and hyperbilirubinaemia (1%). 
Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been 
reported rarely. In clinical studies, rash was reported in 4% of patients and pruritus in 1.5% of patients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdoses have been reported in patients being treated with intravenous topotecan (up to 10 fold of 
the recommended dose) and topotecan capsules (up to 5 fold of the recommended dose). The signs and 
symptoms observed following overdose were consistent with the known undesirable events associated 
with topotecan (see section 4.8). The primary complications of overdose are bone marrow suppression 
and mucositis. In addition, elevated hepatic enzymes have been reported with intravenous topotecan 
overdose. 
There is no known antidote for topotecan overdose. Further management should be as clinically 
indicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre, where available.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, plant alkaloids and other natural products, ATC 
code: L01CE01. 
Mechanism of action 
The anti-tumour activity of topotecan involves the inhibition of topoisomerase-I, an enzyme intimately 
involved in DNA replication as it relieves the torsional strain introduced ahead of the moving 
replication fork. Topotecan inhibits topoisomerase-I by stabilising the covalent complex of enzyme 
and strand-cleaved DNA which is an intermediate of the catalytic mechanism. The cellular sequela of 
inhibition of topoisomerase-I by topotecan is the induction of protein-associated DNA single-strand 
breaks. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Relapsed ovarian cancer 
In a comparative study of topotecan and paclitaxel in patients previously treated for ovarian carcinoma 
with platinum-based chemotherapy (n = 112 and 114, respectively), the response rate (95% CI) was 
20.5% (13%, 28%) versus 14% (8%, 20%) and median time to progression 19 weeks versus 15 weeks 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(hazard ratio 0.7 [0.6, 1.0]), for topotecan and paclitaxel, respectively. Median overall survival was 
62 weeks for topotecan versus 53 weeks for paclitaxel (hazard ratio 0.9 [0.6, 1.3]). 
The response rate in the whole ovarian carcinoma programme (n = 392, all previously treated with 
cisplatin or cisplatin and paclitaxel) was 16%. The median time to response in clinical studies was 
7.6-11.6 weeks. In patients refractory to or relapsing within 3 months after cisplatin therapy (n = 186), 
the response rate was 10%. 
These data should be evaluated in the context of the overall safety profile of the medicinal product, in 
particular of the significant haematological toxicity (see section 4.8). 
A supplementary retrospective analysis was conducted on data from 523 patients with relapsed 
ovarian cancer. Overall, 87 complete and partial responses were observed, with 13 of these occurring 
during cycles 5 and 6 and 3 occurring thereafter. Of the patients who received more than 6 cycles of 
therapy, 91% completed the study as planned or were treated until disease progression, with only 3% 
withdrawn for adverse events. 
Relapsed SCLC 
A Phase III study (Study 478) compared oral topotecan plus best supportive care (BSC) (n = 71) with 
BSC alone (n = 70) in patients who had relapsed following first-line therapy (median time to 
progression [TTP] from first-line therapy: 84 days for oral topotecan plus BSC, 90 days for BSC 
alone) and for whom re-treatment with intravenous chemotherapy was not considered appropriate. In 
the oral topotecan plus BSC group there was a statistically significant improvement in overall survival 
compared with the BSC alone group (Log-rank p = 0.0104). The unadjusted hazard ratio for the oral 
topotecan plus BSC group relative to the BSC alone group was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.90). Median 
survival in patients treated with oral topotecan plus BSC was 25.9 weeks (95% CI: 18.3, 31.6) 
compared to 13.9 weeks (95% CI: 11.1, 18.6) for patients receiving BSC alone (p = 0.0104). 
Patient self-reports of symptoms using an unblinded assessment showed a consistent trend for 
symptom benefit for oral topotecan plus BSC. 
One Phase II study (Study 065) and one Phase III study (Study 396) were conducted to evaluate the 
efficacy of oral topotecan versus intravenous topotecan in patients who had relapsed ≥90 days after 
completion of one prior regimen of chemotherapy (see Table 1). Oral and intravenous topotecan were 
associated with similar symptom palliation in patients with relapsed sensitive SCLC in patient self-
reports on an unblinded symptom scale assessment in each of these two studies.

In another randomised Phase III study which compared intravenous (IV) topotecan to 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and vincristine (CAV) in patients with relapsed, sensitive SCLC, the 
overall response rate was 24.3% for topotecan compared to 18.3% for the CAV group. Median time to 
progression was similar in the two groups (13.3 weeks and 12.3 weeks, respectively). Median 
survivals for the two groups were 25.0 and 24.7 weeks, respectively. The hazard ratio for survival with 
IV topotecan relative to CAV was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.40). 
The response rate to topotecan in the combined small cell lung cancer programme (n = 480) for 
patients with relapsed disease sensitive to first-line therapy was 20.2%. Median survival was 
30.3 weeks (95% CI: 27.6, 33.4). 
In a population of patients with refractory SCLC (those not responding to first-line therapy), the 
response rate to topotecan was 4.0%. 
Cervical carcinoma 
In a randomised, comparative Phase III study conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG 
0179), topotecan plus cisplatin (n = 147) was compared with cisplatin alone (n = 146) for the treatment 
of histologically confirmed persistent, recurrent or Stage IVB carcinoma of the cervix where curative 
treatment with surgery and/or radiation was not considered appropriate. Topotecan plus cisplatin had a 
statistically significant benefit in overall survival relative to cisplatin monotherapy after adjusting for 
interim analyses (Log-rank p = 0.033).

Paediatric population 
Topotecan was also evaluated in the paediatric population; however, only limited data on efficacy and 
safety are available. 
In an open-label study involving children (n = 108, age range: infant to 16 years) with recurrent or 
progressive solid tumours, topotecan was administered at a starting dose of 2.0 mg/m2 given as a 
30-minute infusion for 5 days repeated every 3 weeks for up to one year depending on response to 
therapy. Tumour types included were Ewing’s sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumour, 
neuroblastoma, osteoblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Anti-tumour activity was demonstrated 
primarily in patients with neuroblastoma. Toxicities of topotecan in paediatric patients with recurrent 
and refractory solid tumours were similar to those historically seen in adult patients. In this study, 
forty-six (43%) patients received G-CSF over 192 (42.1%) courses; sixty-five (60%) received 
transfusions of packed red blood cells and fifty (46%) of platelets over 139 and 159 courses (30.5% 
and 34.9%), respectively. Based on the dose-limiting toxicity of myelosuppression, the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) was established at 2.0 mg/m2/day with G-CSF and 1.4 mg/m2/day without G-
CSF in a pharmacokinetic study in paediatric patients with refractory solid tumours (see section 5.2). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration of topotecan at doses of 0.5 to 1.5 mg/m2 as a 30-minute 
infusion daily for five days, topotecan demonstrated a high plasma clearance of 62 l/h (SD 22), 
corresponding to approximately 2/3 of liver blood flow. Topotecan also had a high volume of 
distribution, about 132 l (SD 57), and a relatively short half-life of 2-3 hours. Comparison of 
pharmacokinetic parameters did not suggest any change in pharmacokinetics over the 5 days of 
dosing. Area under the curve increased approximately in proportion to the increase in dose. There is 
little or no accumulation of topotecan with repeated daily dosing and there is no evidence of a change 
in the pharmacokinetics after multiple doses. Preclinical studies indicate plasma protein binding of 
topotecan is low (35%) and distribution between blood cells and plasma was fairly homogeneous. 
Biotransformation 
The elimination of topotecan has only been partly investigated in man. A major route of clearance of 
topotecan was by hydrolysis of the lactone ring to form the ring-opened carboxylate. 
Metabolism accounts for <10% of the elimination of topotecan. An N-desmethyl metabolite, which 
was shown to have similar or less activity than the parent in a cell-based assay, was found in urine, 
plasma and faeces. The mean metabolite:parent AUC ratio was <10% for both total topotecan and 
topotecan lactone. An O-glucuronidation metabolite of topotecan and N-desmethyl topotecan has been 
identified in the urine. 
Elimination 
Overall recovery of topotecan-related material following five daily doses of topotecan was 71 to 76% 
of the administered IV dose. Approximately 51% was excreted as total topotecan and 3% was excreted 
as N-desmethyl topotecan in the urine. Faecal elimination of total topotecan accounted for 18% while 
faecal elimination of N-desmethyl topotecan was 1.7%. Overall, the N-desmethyl metabolite 
contributed a mean of less than 7% (range 4-9%) of the total topotecan-related material accounted for 
in the urine and faeces. The topotecan-O-glucuronide and N-desmethyl topotecan-O-glucuronide in 
the urine were less than 2.0%. 
In vitro data using human liver microsomes indicate the formation of small amounts of N-
demethylated topotecan. In vitro, topotecan did not inhibit human P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, 
CYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E, CYP3A or CYP4A, nor did it inhibit the human cytosolic 
enzymes dihydropyrimidine or xanthine oxidase. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When given in combination with cisplatin (cisplatin day 1, topotecan days 1 to 5), the clearance of 
topotecan was reduced on day 5 compared to day 1 (19.1 l/h/m2 compared to 21.3 l/h/m2 [n = 9]) (see 
section 4.5). 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Plasma clearance in patients with hepatic impairment (serum bilirubin between 1.5 and 10 mg/dl) 
decreased to about 67% when compared with a control group of patients. Topotecan half-life was 
increased by about 30% but no clear change in volume of distribution was observed. Plasma clearance 
of total topotecan (active and inactive form) in patients with hepatic impairment only decreased by 
about 10% compared with the control group of patients. 
Renal impairment 
Plasma clearance in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 41-60 ml/min.) decreased to 
about 67% compared with control patients. Volume of distribution was slightly decreased and thus 
half-life only increased by 14%. In patients with moderate renal impairment topotecan plasma 
clearance was reduced to 34% of the value in control patients. Mean half-life increased from 1.9 hours 
to 4.9 hours. 
Age/weight 
In a population study, a number of factors including age, weight and ascites had no significant effect 
on clearance of total topotecan (active and inactive form). 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of topotecan given as a 30-minute infusion for 5 days were evaluated in two 
studies. One study included a dose range of 1.4 to 2.4 mg/m2 in children (aged 2 up to 12 years, 
n = 18), adolescents (aged 12 up to 16 years, n = 9) and young adults (aged 16 to 21 years, n = 9) with 
refractory solid tumours. The second study included a dose range of 2.0 to 5.2 mg/m2 in children 
(n = 8), adolescents (n = 3) and young adults (n = 3) with leukaemia. In these studies there were no 
apparent differences in the pharmacokinetics of topotecan among children, adolescents and young 
adult patients with solid tumours or leukaemia, but data are too limited to draw definite conclusions. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Resulting from its mechanism of action, topotecan is genotoxic to mammalian cells (mouse lymphoma 
cells and human lymphocytes) in vitro and mouse bone marrow cells in vivo. Topotecan was also 
shown to cause embryo-foetal lethality when given to rats and rabbits. 
In reproductive toxicity studies with topotecan in rats there was no effect on male or female fertility; 
however, in females super-ovulation and slightly increased pre-implantation loss were observed. 
The carcinogenic potential of topotecan has not been studied.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
HYCAMTIN capsules are indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed 
small cell lung cancer (SCLC) for whom re-treatment with the first-line regimen is not considered 
appropriate (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
HYCAMTIN capsules should only be prescribed and therapy supervised by a physician experienced in 
the use of chemotherapeutic agents. 
Posology 
Prior to administration of the first course of topotecan, patients must have a baseline neutrophil count 
of ≥1.5 x 109/l, a platelet count of ≥100 x 109/l and a haemoglobin level of ≥9 g/dl (after transfusion if 
necessary). 
Initial dose 
The recommended dose of HYCAMTIN capsules is 2.3 mg/m2 body surface area per day administered 
for five consecutive days with a three-week interval between the start of each course. If well tolerated, 
treatment may continue until disease progression (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
The capsule(s) must be swallowed whole, and must not be chewed crushed or divided. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hycamtin capsules may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). 
Subsequent doses 
Topotecan should not be re-administered unless the neutrophil count is ≥1 x 109/l, the platelet count is 
≥100 x 109/l, and the haemoglobin level is ≥9 g/dl (after transfusion if necessary). 
Standard oncology practice for the management of neutropenia is either to administer topotecan with 
other medicinal products (e.g. G-CSF) or to reduce the dose to maintain neutrophil counts. 
If dose reduction is chosen for patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil count 
<0.5 x 109/l) for seven days or more or severe neutropenia associated with fever or infection, or who 
have had treatment delayed due to neutropenia, the dose should be reduced by 0.4 mg/m2/day to 
1.9 mg/m2/day (or subsequently down to 1.5 mg/m2/day if necessary). 
Doses should be similarly reduced if the platelet count falls below 25 x 109/l. In clinical studies, 
topotecan was discontinued if the dose needed to be reduced below 1.5 mg/m2/day. 
For patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea, the dose should be reduced by 0.4 mg/m2/day for 
subsequent courses (see section 4.4). Patients with Grade 2 diarrhoea may need to follow the same 
dose modification guidelines. 
Proactive management of diarrhoea with anti-diarrhoeal agents is important. Severe cases of diarrhoea 
may require administration of oral or intravenous electrolytes and fluids, and interruption of topotecan 
therapy (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Special populations 
Patients with renal impairment 
The recommended monotherapy dose of oral topotecan in patients with small cell lung carcinoma with 
creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 ml/min is 1.9 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days. If well 
tolerated, the dose may be increased to 2.3 mg/m2/day in subsequent cycles (see section 5.2). 
Limited data in Korean patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 ml/min suggest a further 
lowering of dose may be required (see section 5.2). 
Insufficient data are available to make a recommendation for patients with a creatinine clearance 
<30 ml/min. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Pharmacokinetics of HYCAMTIN capsules have not been specifically studied in patients with 
impaired hepatic function. There are insufficient data available with HYCAMTIN capsules to make a 
dose recommendation for this patient group (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
Currently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology 
can be made. 
Elderly 
No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between patients aged over 65 years and 
younger adult patients. However in the two studies in which both oral and intravenous topotecan were 
administered, patients over 65 years old receiving oral topotecan experienced an increase in drug-
related diarrhoea compared to those younger than 65 years of age (see section 4.4 and 4.8). 
4.3  Contraindications 
− 
− 
− 
Severe hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
Severe bone marrow depression prior to starting first course, as evidenced by baseline 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
neutrophils <1.5 x 109/l and/or a platelet count of <100 x 109/l. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Haematological toxicity is dose-related and full blood count including platelets should be determined 
regularly (see section 4.2). 
As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan can cause severe myelosuppression. 
Myelosuppression leading to sepsis and fatalities due to sepsis have been reported in patients treated 
with topotecan (see section 4.8). 
Topotecan-induced neutropenia can cause neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis have 
been reported in clinical studies with topotecan. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia and a 
compatible pattern of abdominal pain, the possibility of neutropenic colitis should be considered. 
Topotecan has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of which have been 
fatal (see section 4.8). Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, 
thoracic exposure to radiation and use of pneumotoxic substances and/or colony stimulating factors. 
Patients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD (e.g. cough, fever, dyspnoea 
and/or hypoxia), and topotecan should be discontinued if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 
Topotecan monotherapy and topotecan in combination with cisplatin are commonly associated with 
clinically relevant thrombocytopenia. This should be taken into account when prescribing 
HYCAMTIN, e.g. if patients at increased risk of tumour bleeds are considered for therapy. 
As would be expected, patients with poor performance status (PS >1) have a lower response rate and 
an increased incidence of complications such as fever, infection and sepsis (see section 4.8). Accurate 
assessment of performance status at the time therapy is given is important, to ensure that patients have 
not deteriorated to PS 3. 
Topotecan is partly eliminated via renal excretion and renal impairment might lead to increased 
exposure to topotecan. Dosing recommendations for patients receiving oral topotecan with creatinine 
clearance less than 30 ml/min have not been established. Use of topotecan in these patients is not 
recommended (see section 4.2). 
A small number of hepatically impaired patients (serum bilirubin between 1.5 and 10 mg/dl) were 
given intravenous topotecan at 1.5 mg/m2/day for five days every three weeks. A reduction in 
topotecan clearance was observed. However, there are insufficient data available to make a dose 
recommendation for this patient group. There is insufficient experience of the use of topotecan in 
patients with severely impaired hepatic function (serum bilirubin ≥10 mg/dl). Use of topotecan in 
these patients is not recommended (see section 4.2). 
Diarrhoea, including severe diarrhoea requiring hospitalisation, has been reported during treatment 
with oral topotecan. Diarrhoea related to oral topotecan can occur at the same time as drug-related 
neutropenia and its sequelae. Communication with patients prior to drug administration regarding 
these side effects and proactive management of early and all signs and symptoms of diarrhoea is 
important. Cancer treatment-induced diarrhoea (CTID) is associated with significant morbidity and 
may be life-threatening. Should diarrhoea occur during treatment with oral topotecan, physicians are 
advised to aggressively manage diarrhoea. Clinical guidelines describing the aggressive management 
of CTID include specific recommendations on patient communication and awareness, recognition of 
early warning signs, use of anti-diarrhoeals and antibiotics, changes in fluid intake and diet, and need 
for hospitalisation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Intravenous topotecan should be considered in the following clinical situations: uncontrolled emesis, 
swallowing disorders, uncontrolled diarrhoea, clinical conditions and medication that may alter 
gastrointestinal motility and drug absorption.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No in vivo human pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been performed. 
Topotecan does not inhibit human P450 enzymes (see section 5.2). In a population study using the 
intravenous route, the co-administration of granisetron, ondansetron, morphine or corticosteroids did 
not appear to have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of total topotecan (active and inactive 
form). 
Topotecan is a substrate for both ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) and ABCG2 (BCRP). Inhibitors of ABCB1 
and ABCG2 administered with oral topotecan have been shown to increase topotecan exposure. 
Cyclosporin A (an inhibitor of ABCB1, ABCC1 [MRP-1], and CYP3A4) administered with oral 
topotecan increased topotecan AUC to approximately 2-2.5-fold of control. 
Patients should be carefully monitored for adverse reactions when oral topotecan is administered with 
a substance known to inhibit ABCB1 or ABCG2 (see section 5.2). 
When combining topotecan with other chemotherapy agents, reduction of the doses of each medicinal 
product may be required to improve tolerability. However, when combining with platinum agents, 
there is a distinct sequence-dependent interaction depending on whether the platinum agent is given on 
day 1 or 5 of the topotecan dosing. If either cisplatin or carboplatin is given on day 1 of the topotecan 
dosing, a lower dose of each agent must be given to improve tolerability compared to the dose of each 
agent which can be given if the platinum agent is given on day 5 of the topotecan dosing. Currently 
there is only limited experience in combining oral topotecan with other chemotherapy agents. 
The pharmacokinetics of topotecan were generally unchanged when co-administered with ranitidine. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females 
Topotecan has been shown to cause embryo-foetal lethality and malformations in preclinical studies 
(see section 5.3). As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan may cause foetal harm and 
therefore women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during 
therapy with topotecan. 
As with all cytotoxic chemotherapy, patients being treated with topotecan must be advised that they or 
their partner must use an effective method of contraception. 
Pregnancy 
If topotecan is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during therapy with 
topotecan, the patient must be warned of the potential hazards to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
Topotecan is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). Although it is not known whether 
topotecan is excreted in human breast milk, breast-feeding should be discontinued at the start of 
therapy. 
Fertility 
No effects on male or female fertility have been observed in reproductive toxicity studies in rats (see 
section 5.3). However, as with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan is genotoxic and effects 
on fertility, including male fertility, cannot be excluded.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, 
caution should be observed when driving or operating machines if fatigue and asthenia persist. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
In clinical studies involving patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer, the dose-limiting toxicity of 
oral topotecan monotherapy was found to be haematological. Toxicity was predictable and reversible. 
There were no signs of cumulative haematological or non-haematological toxicity. 
The frequencies associated with the haematological and non-haematological adverse events presented 
are for adverse events considered to be related/possibly related to oral topotecan therapy. 
Adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and absolute frequency (all reported events). 
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon

Safety data are presented based on an integrated data set of 682 patients with relapsed lung cancer 
administered 2,536 courses of oral topotecan monotherapy (275 patients with relapsed SCLC and 407 
with relapsed non-SCLC). 
Haematological 
Neutropenia 
Severe neutropenia (Grade 4 - neutrophil count <0.5 x 109/l) occurred in 32% of patients in 13% of 
courses. Median time to onset of severe neutropenia was day 12 with a median duration of 7 days. In 
34% of courses with severe neutropenia, the duration was >7 days. In course 1 the incidence was 20%, 
by course 4 the incidence was 8%. Infection, sepsis and febrile neutropenia occurred in 17%, 2%, and 
4% of patients, respectively. Death due to sepsis occurred in 1% of patients. Pancytopenia has been 
reported. Growth factors were administered to 19% of patients in 8% of courses. 
Thrombocytopenia 
Severe thrombocytopenia (Grade 4 - platelets <10 x 109/l) occurred in 6% of patients in 2% of courses. 
Median time to onset of severe thrombocytopenia was day 15 with a median duration of 2.5 days. In 
18% of courses with severe thrombocytopenia the duration was >7 days. Moderate thrombocytopenia 
(Grade 3 - platelets between 10.0 and 50.0 x 109/l) occurred in 29% of patients in 14% of courses. 
Platelet transfusions were given to 10% of patients in 4% of courses. Reports of significant sequelae 
associated with thrombocytopenia including fatalities due to tumour bleeds have been infrequent. 
Anaemia 
Moderate to severe anaemia (Grade 3 and 4 – Hb ≤8.0 g/dl) occurred in 25% of patients (12% of 
courses). Median time to onset of moderate to severe anaemia was day 12 with a median duration of 
7 days. In 46% of courses with moderate to severe anaemia, the duration was >7 days. Red blood cell 
transfusions were given in 30% of patients (13% of courses). Erythropoietin was administered to 10% 
of patients in 8% of courses. 
Non-haematological 
The most frequently reported non-haematological effects were nausea (37%), diarrhoea (29%), fatigue 
(26%), vomiting (24%), alopecia (21%) and anorexia (18%). All cases were irrespective of associated 
causality. For severe cases (CTC Grade 3/4) reported as related/possibly related to topotecan 
administration the incidence was diarrhoea 5% (see section 4.4), fatigue 4%, vomiting 3%, nausea 3% 
and anorexia 2%. 
The overall incidence of drug-related diarrhoea was 22%, including 4% with Grade 3 and 0.4% with 
Grade 4. Drug-related diarrhoea was more frequent in patients ≥65 years of age (28%) compared to 
those less than 65 years of age (19%). 
Complete alopecia related/possibly related to topotecan administration was observed in 9% of patients 
and partial alopecia related/possibly related to topotecan administration in 11% of patients. 
Therapeutic interventions associated with non-haematological effects included anti-emetic agents, 
given to 47% of patients in 38% of courses and anti-diarrhoeal agents, given to 15% of patients in 6% 
of courses. A 5-HT3 antagonist was administered to 30% of patients in 24% of courses. Loperamide 
was administered to 13% of patients in 5% of courses. The median time to onset of Grade 2 or worse 
diarrhoea was 9 days. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
Overdoses have been reported in patients being treated with topotecan capsules (up to 5 fold of the 
recommended dose) and intravenous topotecan (up to 10 fold of the recommended dose). The signs 
and symptoms observed following overdose were consistent with the known undesirable events 
associated with topotecan (see section 4.8). The primary complications of overdose are bone marrow 
suppression and mucositis. In addition, elevated hepatic enzymes have been reported with intravenous 
topotecan overdose. 
There is no known antidote for topotecan overdose. Further management should be as clinically 
indicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre, where available.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, plant alkaloids and other natural products, ATC 
code: L01CE01. 
Mechanism of action 
The anti-tumour activity of topotecan involves the inhibition of topoisomerase-I, an enzyme intimately 
involved in DNA replication as it relieves the torsional strain introduced ahead of the moving 
replication fork. Topotecan inhibits topoisomerase-I by stabilising the covalent complex of enzyme 
and strand-cleaved DNA which is an intermediate of the catalytic mechanism. The cellular sequela of 
inhibition of topoisomerase-I by topotecan is the induction of protein-associated DNA single-strand 
breaks. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Relapsed SCLC 
A Phase III study (Study 478) compared oral topotecan plus best supportive care (BSC) (n = 71) with 
BSC alone (n = 70) in patients who had relapsed following first-line therapy (median time to 
progression [TTP] from first-line therapy: 84 days for oral topotecan plus BSC, 90 days for BSC 
alone) and for whom re-treatment with intravenous chemotherapy was not considered appropriate. In 
the oral topotecan plus BSC group there was a statistically significant improvement in overall survival 
compared with the BSC alone group (Log-rank p = 0.0104). The unadjusted hazard ratio for the oral 
topotecan plus BSC group relative to the BSC alone group was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.90). Median 
survival in patients treated with oral topotecan plus BSC was 25.9 weeks (95% CI: 18.3, 31.6) 
compared to 13.9 weeks (95% CI: 11.1, 18.6) for patients receiving BSC alone (p = 0.0104). 
Patient self-reports of symptoms using an unblinded assessment showed a consistent trend for 
symptom benefit for oral topotecan plus BSC. 
One Phase II study (Study 065) and one Phase III study (Study 396) were conducted to evaluate the 
efficacy of oral topotecan versus intravenous topotecan in patients who had relapsed ≥90 days after 
completion of one prior regimen of chemotherapy (see Table 1). Oral and intravenous topotecan were 
associated with similar symptom palliation in patients with relapsed sensitive SCLC in patient self-
reports on an unblinded symptom scale assessment in each of these two studies.

Paediatric population 
The safety and effectiveness of oral topotecan in paediatric patients have not been established. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Distribution 
The pharmacokinetics of topotecan after oral administration have been evaluated in cancer patients 
following doses of 1.2 to 3.1 mg/m2/day and 4 mg/m2/day administered daily for 5 days. The 
bioavailability of oral topotecan (total and lactone) in humans is approximately 40%. Plasma 
concentrations of total topotecan (i.e. lactone and carboxylate forms) and topotecan lactone (active 
moiety) peak at approximately 2.0 hours and 1.5 hours, respectively, and decline bi-exponentially with 
mean terminal half-life of approximately 3.0 to 6.0 hours. Total exposure (AUC) increases 
approximately proportionally with dose. There is little or no accumulation of topotecan with repeated 
daily dosing and there is no evidence of a change in pharmacokinetics after multiple doses. Preclinical 
studies indicate plasma protein binding of topotecan is low (35%) and distribution between blood cells 
and plasma was fairly homogeneous. 
Biotransformation 
A major route of clearance of topotecan is by hydrolysis of the lactone ring to form the ring-opened 
carboxylate. Other than hydrolysis, topotecan is cleared predominantly renally, with a minor 
component metabolised to the N-desmethyl metabolite (SB-209780) identified in plasma, urine and 
faeces. 
Elimination 
Overall recovery of topotecan-related material following five daily doses of topotecan was 49 to 72% 
(mean 57%) of the administered oral dose. Approximately 20% was excreted as total topotecan and 
2% was excreted as N-desmethyl topotecan in the urine. Faecal elimination of total topotecan 
accounted for 33% while faecal elimination of N-desmethyl topotecan was 1.5%. Overall, the N-
desmethyl metabolite contributed a mean of less than 6% (range 4-8%) of the total topotecan-related 
material accounted for in the urine and faeces. O-glucuronides of both topotecan and N-desmethyl 
topotecan have been identified in the urine. The mean metabolite: parent plasma AUC ratio was less 
than 10% for both total topotecan and topotecan lactone. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In vitro, topotecan did not inhibit human P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, CYP2E, CYP3A or CYP4A, nor did it inhibit the human cytosolic enzymes 
dihydropyrimidine or xanthine oxidase. 
Following co-administration of the ABCB1 (P-gp) and ABCG2 (BCRP) inhibitor, elacridar 
(GF120918) at 100 to 1000 mg with oral topotecan, the AUC0-∞ of topotecan lactone and total 
topotecan increased approximately 2.5-fold (see section 4.5 for guidance). 
Administration of oral cyclosporine A (15 mg/kg), an inhibitor of transporters ABCB1 (P-gp) and 
ABCC1 (MRP-1) as well as the metabolising enzyme CYP3A4, within 4 hours of oral topotecan 
increased the dose normalised AUC0-24h of topotecan lactone and total topotecan approximately 
2.0- and 2.5-fold, respectively (see section 4.5). 
The extent of exposure was similar following a high-fat meal and in the fasted state, while tmax was 
delayed from 1.5 to 3 hours (topotecan lactone) and from 3 to 4 hours (total topotecan). 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of oral topotecan have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment (see 
section 4.2 and 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
Results of a cross-study analysis suggest that the exposure to topotecan lactone, the active moiety 
following topotecan administration, increases with decreased renal function. Geometric mean 
topotecan lactone dose-normalised AUC(0-∞) values were 9.4, 11.1 and 12.0 ng*h/ml in subjects with 
creatinine clearance values of more than 80 ml/min, 50 to 80 ml/min and 30 to 49 ml/min, 
respectively. In this analysis, creatinine clearance was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault method. 
Similar results were obtained if glomerular filtration rate (ml/min) was estimated using the MDRD 
formula corrected for body weight. Patients with creatinine clearance >60 ml/min have been included 
in efficacy/safety studies of topotecan. Therefore, use of the normal starting dose in patients with a 
mild decrease in renal function is considered established (see section 4.2). 
Korean patients with renal impairment had generally higher exposure than non-Asian patients with the 
same degree of renal impairment. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. Geometric mean 
topotecan lactone dose-normalised AUC(0-∞) values for Korean patients were 7.9, 12.9 and 
19.7 ng*h/ml in subjects with creatinine clearance values of more than 80 ml/min, 50 to 80 ml/min 
and 30 to 49 ml/min, respectively (see section 4.2 and 4.4). There are no data from Asian patients with 
renal impairment other than Koreans. 
Gender 
A cross-study analysis in 217 patients with advanced solid tumours indicated that gender did not affect 
the pharmacokinetics of HYCAMTIN capsules to a clinically relevant extent. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Resulting from its mechanism of action, topotecan is genotoxic to mammalian cells (mouse lymphoma 
cells and human lymphocytes) in vitro and mouse bone marrow cells in vivo. Topotecan was also 
shown to cause embryo-foetal lethality when given to rats and rabbits. 
In reproductive toxicity studies with topotecan in rats there was no effect on male or female fertility; 
however, in females super-ovulation and slightly increased pre-implantation loss were observed. 
The carcinogenic potential of topotecan has not been studied.

1.  What Hycamtin is and what it is used for 
Hycamtin helps to destroy tumours. A doctor or a nurse will give you the medicine as an infusion into 
a vein in hospital. 
Hycamtin is used to treat: 
• 
• 
ovarian cancer or small cell lung cancer that has come back after chemotherapy. 
advanced cervical cancer if surgery or radiotherapy treatment is not possible. When treating 
cervical cancer, Hycamtin is combined with another medicine called cisplatin. 
Your doctor will decide with you whether Hycamtin therapy is better than further treatment with your 
initial chemotherapy. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Hycamtin 
You should not receive Hycamtin 
• 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to topotecan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you are breast-feeding. 
if your blood cell counts are too low. Your doctor will tell you whether this is the case, based on 
the results of your last blood test. 
Tell your doctor if any of these applies to you. 
Warnings and precautions 
Before you are given this medicine your doctor needs to know: 
• 
• 
if you have any kidney or liver problems. Your dose of Hycamtin may need to be adjusted. 
if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. See section “Pregnancy and breast-feeding” 
below.

any herbal products or medicines obtained without a prescription. 
Remember to tell your doctor if you start to take any other medicines while you are on Hycamtin. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Hycamtin is not recommended for pregnant women. It may harm a baby conceived before, during or 
soon after treatment. You should use an effective method of contraception. Ask your doctor for advice.

free”. If your doctor uses a solution of common salt to dilute Hycamtin, the dose of sodium received 
would be larger. 
3. 
How Hycamtin is used 
The dose of Hycamtin you are given will be worked out by your doctor, based on: 
• 
• 
• 
your body size (surface area measured in square metres) 
the results of blood tests carried out before treatment 
the disease being treated. 
The usual dose 
• 
• 
Ovarian and small cell lung cancer: 1.5 mg per square metre of body surface area per day. 
You will have treatment once a day for 5 days. This pattern of treatment will normally be 
repeated every 3 weeks. 
Cervical cancer: 0.75 mg per square metre of body surface area per day. You will have 
treatment once a day for 3 days. This pattern of treatment will normally be repeated every 
3 weeks. 
When treating cervical cancer, Hycamtin is combined with another medicine, called cisplatin. 
Your doctor will determine the correct dose of cisplatin. 
The treatment may vary, depending on the results of your regular blood tests. 
How Hycamtin is given 
A doctor or nurse will administer Hycamtin as an infusion into your arm lasting about 30 minutes.

SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR ZONISAMIDE MYLAN 
Overview of disease epidemiology 
(ZONISAMIDE) 
Zonisamide is an anti-epileptic which is indicated for the treatment of partial seizures with or 
without secondary generalisation in adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy or as an adjunctive 
therapy in the treatment of partial seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in adults, 
adolescents and children aged 6 years and above. 
Epilepsy is a chronic disorder that affects people of all ages all around the world, it is estimated 
that around 50 million people in the world have epilepsy, however being more predominant in 
developing  countries  where  the  estimated  proportion  of  the  general  population  with  active 
epilepsy is  between 6 to  10 per 1000 in  comparison to  4 to  10 per 1000 in  non-developing 
countries. Unfortunately in developing country three fourths of the affected people do not get 
the treatment they require. The risk of premature death in people with epilepsy is two or three 
times higher than it is for general population.  
Summary of treatment benefits 
Zonisamide is  used as  an anti-epileptic medicine.  Zonisamide is  used to treat  seizures that 
affect  one  part  of  the  brain  which  is  known  as  a  partial  seizure,  which  may  or  may  not  be 
followed by a seizure affecting all of the brain which is known as secondary generalisation. 
The medicinal product can be used on its own to treat seizures in adults or with other similar 
medications to treat seizures in adults, adolescents and children aged 6 years and above.   
Studies have been performed to confirm the efficacy of zonisamide to treat seizures that affect 
one  part  of  the  brain  with  or  without  a  seizure  affecting  all  of  the  brain.  The  study  was 
performed in 583 adults who had recently been diagnosed with partial seizures with or without 
seizures affecting all of the brain. The consisted of treatment with zonisamide in comparison 
to another known anti-epileptic drug called carbamazepine. The adult subjects at random were 
either given zonisamide or carbamazepine for a course of 24 months.  
Overall, 79.4% of patients treated with zonisamide compared to 83.7% patients treated with 
carbamazepine were seizure- free for more than 26 weeks.  
Furthermore, as an add on therapy with other similar medications to treat seizures in adults, 
adolescents and children aged 6 years and above, zonisamide has shown positive efficacy of in 
many studies, resulting in a median decrease in seizures affecting one part of the brain at doses 
of 300-500mg per day.  
These studies were conducted for innovator product by Innovator Company and not by Mylan. 
 
Unknowns relating to treatment benefits 
The  use  of  zonisamide  has  not  been  has  not  been  studied  adequately  in  patients  with  liver 
impairments  and  in  paediatric  patients  below  the  age  of  6.  As  the  safety  and  efficacy  of 
zonisamide has not be established in these special populations caution should be taken when 
being treated. Furthermore, as for now routine Pharmacovigilance activities are sufficient to 
monitor these risks.

Risk 
What is known (Including reason why it is considered a 
potential risk) 
Use in renal impairment 
It  has  been  identified  that  zonisamide  can  have  some 
nephrotoxic  effects  such  as  kidney  stones  furthermore 
studies  have  shown  that  there  is  a  positive  correlation 
between  plasma  AUC  of  zonisamide  with  creatinine 
clearance.  Therefore  caution  should  be 
taken  when 
prescribing doses to renal impaired patients.  
Pregnancy issues.  
As per studies there is no strong correlation that zonisamide 
can  have  toxic  effects  during  pregnancy  or  on  the  fetus. 
However, toxic effects have been observed in animal studies, 
potential risk to humans is unknown. Therefore, zonisamide 
use in pregnancy is contraindicated and only should be used 
if the physician feels that the potential benefit of zonisamide 
use is considered to justify the risk to the fetus.  
Use in elderly.  
Generally elderly people have reduced kidney function and 
zonisamide  is  primarily  digested  through  the  kidneys 
therefore caution should be taken when prescribing its  use 
within  this  population.  Furthermore,  some  adverse  events 
have been observed at a higher incidence rate in the elderly 
population such as skin rash (pruritus).

weight loss and a dietary supplement or increased food intake 
should be considered if the patient is failing to gain weight 
in  accordance  with  growth  charts,  otherwise  zonisamide 
should be discontinued.

Summary of risk minimisation measures by safety concern 
All medicines have a Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) which provides physicians, 
pharmacists and other health care professionals with details on how to use the medicine, the 
risks and recommendations for minimising them. An abbreviated version of this in lay language 
is provided in the form of the package leaflet. The measures in these documents are known as 
routine risk minimisation measures. 
Planned post authorisation development plan 
No studies planned.

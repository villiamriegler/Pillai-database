CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
DIFICLIR film-coated tablets is indicated for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) 
also known as C. difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) in adult and paediatric patients with a body 
weight of at least 12.5 kg (see section 4.2 and 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidelines on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Adults 
Standard dosing 
The recommended dose is 200 mg (one tablet) administered twice daily (once every 12 hours) for 
10 days (see section 5.1). 
DIFICLIR 40 mg/ml granules for oral suspension may be used in adult patients with difficulties in 
swallowing tablets. 
Extended-pulsed dosing 
Fidaxomicin 200 mg tablets administered twice daily for days 1-5 (no intake of a tablet on day 6) then 
once daily on alternate days for days 7-25 (see section 5.1). 
If a dose has been forgotten, the missed dose should be taken as soon as possible or, if it's nearly time 
for the next dose, the tablet should be skipped altogether. 
Special populations 
Elderly population 
No dose adjustment is considered necessary (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is considered necessary. Due to the limited clinical data in this population, 
fidaxomicin should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is considered necessary. Due to the limited clinical data in this population, 
fidaxomicin should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The recommended dose in paediatric patients weighing at least 12.5 kg is 200 mg administered twice 
daily (once every 12 hours) for 10 days using the film-coated tablets or the granules for oral 
suspension. 
Reduced doses are recommended for patients with a body weight of less than 12.5 kg. See the SmPC 
of DIFICLIR 40 mg/ml granules for oral suspension. 
Method of administration 
DIFICLIR is intended for oral use. 
The film-coated tablets should be administered whole with water. 
They can be taken with or without food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypersensitivity reactions  
Hypersensitivity reactions including severe angioedema have been reported (see section 4.8). If a 
severe allergic reaction occurs during treatment with fidaxomicin, the medicinal product should be 
discontinued and appropriate measures taken. 
Some patients with hypersensitivity reactions reported a history of allergy to macrolides. Fidaxomicin 
should be used with caution in patients with a known macrolides allergy. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Due to limited clinical data, fidaxomicin should be used with caution in patients with severe renal 
impairment or moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Pseudomembranous colitis, fulminant or life threatening CDI 
Due to limited clinical data, fidaxomicin should be used with caution in patients with 
pseudomembranous colitis, fulminant or life threatening CDI. 
Co-administration of potent P-glycoprotein inhibitors 
Co-administration of potent P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as cyclosporine, ketoconazole, 
erythromycin, clarithromycin, verapamil, dronedarone and amiodarone is not recommended (see 
sections 4.5 and 5.2). In case fidaxomicin is administered concomitantly with potent P-glycoprotein 
inhibitors, caution is advised. 
Paediatric population 
Only one paediatric patient below 6 months of age has been exposed to fidaxomicin in clinical trials. 
Therefore, patients below 6 months of age should be treated with caution. 
3 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Testing for C. difficile colonization or toxin is not recommended in children younger than 1 year due 
to high rate of asymptomatic colonisation unless severe diarrhoea is present in infants with risk factors 
for stasis such as Hirschsprung disease, operated anal atresia or other severe motility disorders. 
Alternative aetiologies should always be sought and C. difficile enterocolitis be proven. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effect of P-gp inhibitors on fidaxomicin 
Fidaxomicin is a substrate of P-gp. Co-administration of single doses of the P-gp inhibitor 
cyclosporine A and fidaxomicin in healthy volunteers, resulted in a 4- and 2-fold increase in 
fidaxomicin Cmax and AUC, respectively and in a 9.5 and 4-fold increase in Cmax and AUC, 
respectively, of the main active metabolite OP-1118. As the clinical relevance of this increase in 
exposure is unclear, co-administration of potent inhibitors of P-gp, such as cyclosporine, ketoconazole, 
erythromycin, clarithromycin, verapamil, dronedarone and amiodarone is not recommended (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Effect of fidaxomicin on P-gp substrates 
Fidaxomicin may be a mild to moderate inhibitor of intestinal P-gp. 
Fidaxomicin (200 mg twice daily) had a small but not clinically relevant effect on digoxin exposure. 
However, a larger effect on P-gp substrates with lower bioavailability more sensitive to intestinal P-gp 
inhibition such as dabigatran etexilat cannot be excluded. 
Effect of fidaxomicin on other transporters 
Fidaxomicin does not have a clinically significant effect on the exposure of rosuvastatin, a substrate 
for the transporters OATP2B1 and BCRP. Co-administration of 200 mg fidaxomicin twice daily with 
a single dose of 10 mg rosuvastatin to healthy subjects did not have a clinically significant effect on 
the AUCinf of rosuvastatin.  
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data available from the use of fidaxomicin in pregnant women. Animal studies did not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. As a precautionary 
measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of fidaxomicin during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether fidaxomicin and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Although no 
effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated since the systemic exposure to fidaxomicin is 
low, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to 
discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from fidaxomicin therapy, taking into account the 
benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.  
Fertility 
Fidaxomicin had no effects on fertility when evaluated in rats (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DIFICLIR has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions are vomiting (1.2%), nausea (2.7%) and constipation (1.2%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 1 displays adverse reactions associated with twice daily administration of fidaxomicin in the 
treatment of C. difficile infection, reported in at least two patients, presented by system organ class. 
The frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to 
<1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse 
reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Acute hypersensitivity reactions, such as angioedema and dyspnea, have been reported during 
post-marketing (see section 4.3 and 4.4).  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of fidaxomicin has been evaluated in 136 patients from birth to less than 18 
years of age. Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same 
as in adults. In addition to the ADRs shown in table 1, two cases of urticaria were reported. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

No adverse reactions for acute overdose have been reported during clinical studies or from 
post-marketing data.  However, the potential for adverse reactions cannot be ruled out and general 
supportive measures are recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antidiarrheals, intestinal antiinflammatory/antiinfective agents, 
antibiotics, ATC code: A07AA12 
Mechanism of action 
Fidaxomicin is an antibiotic belonging to the macrocyclic class of antibacterials. 
Fidaxomicin is bactericidal and inhibits RNA synthesis by bacterial RNA polymerase. It interferes 
with RNA polymerase at a distinct site from that of rifamycins. Inhibition of the Clostridial RNA 
polymerase occurs at a concentration 20-fold lower than that for the E. coli enzyme (1 μM vs. 20 μM), 
partly explaining the significant specificity of fidaxomicin activity. Fidaxomicin has been shown to 
inhibit C. difficile sporulation in vitro.  
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship 
Fidaxomicin is a locally acting drug. As a topical agent, systemic PK/PD relationships cannot be 
established, however in vitro data show fidaxomicin to have time-dependent bactericidal activity and 
suggest time over MIC may be the parameter most predicative of clinical efficacy. 
Breakpoints 
Fidaxomicin is a topically acting drug that cannot be used to treat systemic infections; therefore the 
establishment of a clinical breakpoint is not relevant. The epidemiological cut-off value for 
fidaxomicin and C. difficile, distinguishing the wild-type population from isolates with acquired 
resistance traits, is ≥1.0 mg/L. 
Antimicrobial spectrum 
Fidaxomicin is a narrow spectrum antimicrobial drug with bactericidal activity against C. difficile. 
Fidaxomicin has an MIC90 of 0.25 mg/L versus C. difficile, and its main metabolite, OP-1118, has an 
MIC90 of 8 mg/L. Gram negative organisms are intrinsically not susceptible to fidaxomicin.  
Effect on the intestinal flora 
Studies have demonstrated that fidaxomicin treatment did not affect Bacteroides concentrations or 
other major components of the microbiota in the faeces of CDI patients.  
Mechanism of resistance 
There are no known transferable elements that confer resistance to fidaxomicin. Also no cross-
resistance has been discovered with any other antibiotic class including β-lactams, macrolides, 
metronidazole, quinolones, rifampin, and vancomycin. Specific mutations of RNA polymerase are 
associated with reduced susceptibility to fidaxomicin. 
Clinical efficacy in adults 
The efficacy of fidaxomicin was evaluated in two pivotal, randomised, double-blind Phase 3 studies 
(Study 003 and 004). Fidaxomicin was compared with orally administered vancomycin. The primary 
endpoint was clinical cure assessed after 12 days.

Non-inferiority of fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin was demonstrated in both studies (see

The rate of recurrence in the 30 days following treatment was assessed as a secondary endpoint. The 
rate of recurrence (including relapses) was significantly lower with fidaxomicin (14.1% versus 26.0% 
with a 95% CI of [-16.8%, -6.8%]), however these trials were not prospectively designed to prove 
prevention of reinfection with a new strain. 
Description of the patient population in the pivotal clinical trials in adults 
In the two pivotal clinical trials of patients with CDI, 47.9% (479/999) of patients (per protocol 
population) were ≥65 years of age and 27.5% (275/999) of patients were treated with concomitant 
antibiotics during the study period. Twenty-four percent of patients met at least one of the following 
three criteria at baseline for scoring severity: body temperature >38.5°C, leukocyte count >15,000, or 
creatinine value ≥1.5 mg/dl. Patients with fulminant colitis and patients with multiple episodes 
(defined as more than one prior episode within the previous 3 months) of CDI were excluded from the 
studies. 
Trial with the extended-pulse fidaxomicin dosing (EXTEND) 
EXTEND was a randomised, open-label study that compared extended-pulse fidaxomicin dosing with 
orally administered vancomycin. The primary endpoint was sustained clinical cure 30 days after end 
of treatment (Day 55 for fidaxomicin, day 40 for vancomycin). The sustained clinical cure 30 days 
after end of treatment was significantly higher for fidaxomicin vs. vancomycin (see Table 3).

Description of the patient population in extended-pulse fidaxomicin dosing trial 
The trial was conducted with adults aged 60 years and older. The median age of the patients was 75. 
72% (257/356) received other antibiotics within the last 90 days. 36.5% had a severe infection. 
Paediatric population 
 The safety and efficacy of fidaxomicin in paediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age 
was investigated in a multicentre, investigator-blind, randomised, parallel group study where 148 
patients were randomised to either fidaxomicin or vancomycin in a 2:1 ratio. A total of 30, 49, 40 and 
29 patients were randomised in the age groups of birth to < 2 years, 2 to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years and 
12 to < 18 years, respectively. Confirmed clinical response 2 days after end of treatment was similar 
between the fidaxomicin and vancomycin group (77.6% vs 70.5% with a point difference of 7.5% and 
95% CI for the difference of [-7.4%, 23.9%]). The rate of recurrence 30 days after end of treatment 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was numerically lower with fidaxomicin (11.8% vs 29.0%), but the rate difference is not statistically 
significant (point difference of -15.8% and 95% CI for the difference of [-34.5%, 0.5%]). Both 
treatments had a similar safety profile. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The bioavailability in humans is unknown. In healthy adults, Cmax is approximately 9.88 ng/ml and 
AUC0-t is 69.5 ng•hr/ml following administration of 200 mg fidaxomicin, with a Tmax of 1.75 hours. In 
CDI patients, average peak plasma levels of fidaxomicin and its main metabolite OP-1118 tend to be 
2- to 6-fold higher than in healthy adults. There was very limited accumulation of fidaxomicin or 
OP-1118 in plasma following administration of 200 mg fidaxomicin every 12 hours for 10 days. 
Cmax for fidaxomicin and OP-1118 in plasma were 22% and 33% lower following a high fat meal vs 
fasting, but the extent of exposure (AUC0-t) was equivalent. 
Fidaxomicin and the metabolite OP-1118 are substrates of P-gp. 
In vitro studies showed that fidaxomicin and the metabolite OP-1118 are inhibitors of the transporters 
BCRP, MRP2 and OATP2B1, but were not found to be substrates. Under conditions of clinical use, 
fidaxomicin has no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of rosuvastatin, a substrate for OATP2B1 
and BCRP (see section 4.5). The clinical relevance of MRP2 inhibition is not yet known. 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution in humans is unknown, due to very limited absorption of fidaxomicin. 
Biotransformation 
No extensive analysis of metabolites in plasma has been performed, due to low levels of systemic 
absorption of fidaxomicin. A main metabolite, OP-1118, is formed through hydrolysis of the 
isobutyryl ester. In vitro metabolism studies showed that the formation of OP-1118 is not dependent 
on CYP450 enzymes. This metabolite also shows antimicrobial activity (see section 5.1). 
Fidaxomicin does not induce or inhibit CYP450 enzymes in vitro. 
Elimination 
Following a single dose of 200 mg fidaxomicin, the majority of the administered dose (over 92%) was 
recovered in the stool as fidaxomicin or its metabolite OP-1118 (66%). The main elimination 
pathways of systemically available fidaxomicin have not been characterized. Elimination through 
urine is negligible (<1%). Only very low levels of OP-1118 and no fidaxomicin was detectable in 
human urine. The half life of fidaxomicin is approximately 8-10 h.  
Special populations 
Elderly 
Plasma levels appear to be elevated in the elderly (age ≥ 65 years). Fidaxomicin and OP-1118 levels 
were approximately 2 times higher in patients ≥ 65 years compared to patients < 65 years. This 
difference is not considered clinically relevant. 
Paediatric population 
After administration of film-coated tablets, the mean (SD) plasma levels in the paediatric patients from 
6 to less than 18 years was 48.53 (69.85) ng/ml and 143.63 (286.31) ng/ml for fidaxomicin and its 
main metabolite OP-1118, respectively, at 1 to 5 hours postdose. 
Inflammatory bowel disease 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Data from an open label, single arm study in adult CDI patients with concomitant inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD) indicated no major difference in plasma concentrations of fidaxomicin or its main 
metabolite OP-1118 in patients with IBD as compared with patients without IBD in other studies. The 
maximum fidaxomicin and OP-1118 plasma levels in CDI patients with concomitant IBD were within 
the range of levels found in CDI patients without IBD. 
Hepatic impairment 
Limited data from adult patients with an active history of chronic hepatic cirrhosis in the Phase 3 
studies showed that median plasma levels of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 may be approximately 2- and 
3-fold higher, respectively, than in non-cirrhotic patients. 
Renal impairment 
Limited data from adult patients suggest that there is no major difference in plasma concentration of 
fidaxomicin or OP-1118 between patients with reduced renal function (creatinine clearance 
< 50 ml/min) and patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min). 
Gender, weight and race 
Limited data suggest that gender, weight and race do not have any major influence on the plasma 
concentration of fidaxomicin or OP-1118. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Nonclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeat dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity. 
Reproductive and fertility parameters showed no statistically significant differences in rats treated with 
fidaxomicin at doses up to 6.3 mg/kg/day (intravenous). 
No target organs for toxicity were observed in juvenile animals, and no important potential risks have 
been observed in the nonclinical studies that might be relevant for paediatric patients.

sections 4.5 and 5.2). In case fidaxomicin is administered concomitantly with potent P-glycoprotein 
inhibitors, caution is advised. 
DIFICLIR contains sodium 
DIFICLIR contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 5 ml suspension, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Paediatric population 
Only one paediatric patient below 6 months of age and no patients with a body weight below 4 kg 
have been exposed to fidaxomicin in clinical trials. Therefore, fidaxomicin should be used with 
caution in these patients. 
Testing for C. difficile colonization or toxin is not recommended in children younger than 1 year due 
to high rate of asymptomatic colonisation unless severe diarrhoea is present in infants with risk factors 
for stasis such as Hirschsprung disease, operated anal atresia or other severe motility disorders. 
Alternative aetiologies should always be sought and C. difficile enterocolitis be proven. 
Sodium benzoate content 
This medicine contains 2.5 mg sodium benzoate (E 211) in each ml oral suspension. Sodium benzoate 
(E 211) may increase jaundice in newborn babies (up to 4 weeks old). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effect of P-gp inhibitors on fidaxomicin 
Fidaxomicin is a substrate of P-gp. Co-administration of single doses of the P-gp inhibitor 
cyclosporine A and fidaxomicin in healthy volunteers, resulted in a 4- and 2-fold increase in 
fidaxomicin Cmax and AUC, respectively and in a 9.5 and 4-fold increase in Cmax and AUC, 
respectively, of the main active metabolite OP-1118. As the clinical relevance of this increase in 
exposure is unclear, co-administration of potent inhibitors of P-gp, such as cyclosporine, ketoconazole, 
erythromycin, clarithromycin, verapamil, dronedarone and amiodarone is not recommended (see 
section 4.4 and 5.2). 
Effect of fidaxomicin on P-gp substrates 
Fidaxomicin may be a mild to moderate inhibitor of intestinal P-gp. 
Fidaxomicin (200 mg twice daily) had a small but not clinically relevant effect on digoxin exposure. 
However, a larger effect on P-gp substrates with lower bioavailability more sensitive to intestinal P-gp 
inhibition such as dabigatran etexilat cannot be excluded. 
Effect of fidaxomicin on other transporters 
Fidaxomicin does not have a clinically significant effect on the exposure of rosuvastatin, a substrate 
for the transporters OATP2B1 and BCRP. Co-administration of 200 mg fidaxomicin twice daily with 
a single dose of 10 mg rosuvastatin to healthy subjects did not have a clinically significant effect on 
the AUCinf of rosuvastatin.  
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are no data available from the use of fidaxomicin in pregnant women. Animal studies did not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. As a precautionary 
measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of fidaxomicin during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether fidaxomicin and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Although no 
effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated since the systemic exposure to fidaxomicin is 
low, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to 
discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from fidaxomicin therapy, taking into account the 
benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.  
Fertility 
Fidaxomicin had no effects on fertility when evaluated in rats (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
DIFICLIR has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions are vomiting (1.2%), nausea (2.7%) and constipation (1.2%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 2 displays adverse reactions associated with twice daily administration of fidaxomicin in the 
treatment of C. difficile infection, reported in at least two patients, presented by system organ class. 
The frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to 
<1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse 
reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Acute hypersensitivity reactions, such as angioedema and dyspnea, have been reported during 
post-marketing (see section 4.3 and 4.4).  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of fidaxomicin has been evaluated in 136 patients from birth to less than 18 
years of age. Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same 
as in adults. In addition to the ADRs shown in table 2, two cases of urticaria were reported. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No adverse reactions for acute overdose have been reported during clinical studies or from 
post-marketing data.  However, the potential for adverse reactions cannot be ruled out and general 
supportive measures are recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antidiarrheals, intestinal antiinflammatory/antiinfective agents, 
antibiotics, ATC code: A07AA12 
Mechanism of action 
Fidaxomicin is an antibiotic belonging to the macrocyclic class of antibacterials. 
Fidaxomicin is bactericidal and inhibits RNA synthesis by bacterial RNA polymerase. It interferes 
with RNA polymerase at a distinct site from that of rifamycins. Inhibition of the Clostridial RNA 
polymerase occurs at a concentration 20-fold lower than that for the E. coli enzyme (1 μM vs. 20 μM), 
partly explaining the significant specificity of fidaxomicin activity. Fidaxomicin has been shown to 
inhibit C. difficile sporulation in vitro.  
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship 
Fidaxomicin is a locally acting drug. As a topical agent, systemic PK/PD relationships cannot be 
established, however in vitro data show fidaxomicin to have time-dependent bactericidal activity and 
suggest time over MIC may be the parameter most predicative of clinical efficacy. 
Breakpoints 
Fidaxomicin is a topically acting drug that cannot be used to treat systemic infections; therefore the 
establishment of a clinical breakpoint is not relevant. The epidemiological cut-off value for 
fidaxomicin and C. difficile, distinguishing the wild-type population from isolates with acquired 
resistance traits, is ≥1.0 mg/L. 
Antimicrobial spectrum 
Fidaxomicin is a narrow spectrum antimicrobial drug with bactericidal activity against C. difficile. 
Fidaxomicin has an MIC90 of 0.25 mg/L versus C. difficile, and its main metabolite, OP-1118, has an 
MIC90 of 8 mg/L. Gram negative organisms are intrinsically not susceptible to fidaxomicin.  
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effect on the intestinal flora 
Studies have demonstrated that fidaxomicin treatment did not affect Bacteroides concentrations or 
other major components of the microbiota in the faeces of CDI patients.  
Mechanism of resistance 
There are no known transferable elements that confer resistance to fidaxomicin. Also no cross-
resistance has been discovered with any other antibiotic class including β-lactams, macrolides, 
metronidazole, quinolones, rifampin, and vancomycin. Specific mutations of RNA polymerase are 
associated with reduced susceptibility to fidaxomicin. 
Clinical efficacy in adults 
In the pivotal clinical trials in adult patients using the tablet formulation the rate of recurrence in the 
30 days following treatment was assessed as a secondary endpoint. The rate of recurrence (including 
relapses) was significantly lower with fidaxomicin (14.1% versus 26.0% with a 95% CI of [-16.8%, -
6.8%]), however these trials were not prospectively designed to prove prevention of reinfection with a 
new strain. 
Description of the patient population in clinical trials in adults 
In the two pivotal clinical trials of patients with CDI, 47.9% (479/999) of patients (per protocol 
population) were ≥65 years of age and 27.5% (275/999) of patients were treated with concomitant 
antibiotics during the study period. Twenty-four percent of patients met at least one of the following 
three criteria at baseline for scoring severity: body temperature >38.5°C, leukocyte count >15,000, or 
creatinine value ≥1.5 mg/dl. Patients with fulminant colitis and patients with multiple episodes 
(defined as more than one prior episode within the previous 3 months) of CDI were excluded from the 
studies. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of fidaxomicin in paediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age 
was investigated in a multicentre, investigator-blind, randomised, parallel group study where 148 
patients were randomised to either fidaxomicin or vancomycin in a 2:1 ratio. A total of 30, 49, 40 and 
29 patients were randomised in the age groups of birth to < 2 years, 2 to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years and 
12 to < 18 years, respectively. Confirmed clinical response 2 days after end of treatment was similar 
between the fidaxomicin and vancomycin group (77.6% vs 70.5% with a point difference of 7.5% and 
95% CI for the difference of [-7.4%, 23.9%]). The rate of recurrence 30 days after end of treatment 
was numerically lower with fidaxomicin (11.8% vs 29.0%), but the rate difference is not statistically 
significant (point difference of -15.8% and 95% CI for the difference of [-34.5%, 0.5%]). Both 
treatments had a similar safety profile. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The bioavailability in humans is unknown. After administration of fidaxomicin film-coated tablets in 
healthy adults, Cmax is approximately 9.88 ng/ml and AUC0-t is 69.5 ng•hr/ml following administration 
of 200 mg fidaxomicin, with a Tmax of 1.75 hours. In CDI patients, average peak plasma levels of 
fidaxomicin and its main metabolite OP-1118 tend to be 2- to 6-fold higher than in healthy adults. 
There was very limited accumulation of fidaxomicin or OP-1118 in plasma following administration 
of 200 mg fidaxomicin every 12 hours for 10 days. 
Cmax for fidaxomicin and OP-1118 in plasma were 22% and 33% lower following a high fat meal vs 
fasting, but the extent of exposure (AUC0-t) was equivalent. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fidaxomicin and the metabolite OP-1118 are substrates of P-gp. 
In vitro studies showed that fidaxomicin and the metabolite OP-1118 are inhibitors of the transporters 
BCRP, MRP2 and OATP2B1, but were not found to be substrates. Under conditions of clinical use, 
fidaxomicin has no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of rosuvastatin, a substrate for OATP2B1 
and BCRP (see section 4.5). The clinical relevance of MRP2 inhibition is not yet known. 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution in humans is unknown, due to very limited absorption of fidaxomicin. 
Biotransformation 
No extensive analysis of metabolites in plasma has been performed, due to low levels of systemic 
absorption of fidaxomicin. A main metabolite, OP-1118, is formed through hydrolysis of the 
isobutyryl ester. In vitro metabolism studies showed that the formation of OP-1118 is not dependent 
on CYP450 enzymes. This metabolite also shows antimicrobial activity (see section 5.1). 
Fidaxomicin does not induce or inhibit CYP450 enzymes in vitro. 
Elimination 
Following a single dose of 200 mg fidaxomicin, the majority of the administered dose (over 92%) was 
recovered in the stool as fidaxomicin or its metabolite OP-1118 (66%). The main elimination 
pathways of systemically available fidaxomicin have not been characterized. Elimination through 
urine is negligible (<1%). Only very low levels of OP-1118 and no fidaxomicin was detectable in 
human urine. The half life of fidaxomicin is approximately 8-10 h.  
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
After administration of the oral suspension, the mean (SD) plasma levels in the paediatric patients 
from birth to less than 18 years was 34.60 (57.79) ng/ml and 102.38 (245.19) ng/ml for fidaxomicin 
and its main metabolite OP-1118, respectively, at 1 to 5 hours postdose. 
Elderly 
Plasma levels appear to be elevated in the elderly (age ≥ 65 years). Fidaxomicin and OP-1118 levels 
were approximately 2 times higher in patients ≥ 65 years compared to patients < 65 years. This 
difference is not considered clinically relevant. 
Inflammatory bowel disease 
Data from an open label, single arm study in adult CDI patients with concomitant inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD) using the tablet formulation indicated no major difference in plasma concentrations of 
fidaxomicin or its main metabolite OP-1118 in patients with IBD as compared with patients without 
IBD in other studies. The maximum fidaxomicin and OP-1118 plasma levels in CDI patients with 
concomitant IBD were within the range of levels found in CDI patients without IBD. 
Hepatic impairment 
Limited data from adult patients with an active history of chronic hepatic cirrhosis using the tablet 
formulation in the Phase 3 studies showed that median plasma levels of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 may 
be approximately 2- and 3-fold higher, respectively, than in non-cirrhotic patients. 
Renal impairment 
Limited data from adult patients using the tablet formulation suggest that there is no major difference 
in plasma concentration of fidaxomicin or OP-1118 between patients with reduced renal function 
(creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min) and patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance 
≥ 50 ml/min). 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gender, weight and race 
Limited data suggest that gender, weight and race do not have any major influence on the plasma 
concentration of fidaxomicin or OP-1118. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Nonclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeat dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity. 
Reproductive and fertility parameters showed no statistically significant differences in rats treated with 
fidaxomicin at doses up to 6.3 mg/kg/day (intravenous). 
No target organs for toxicity were observed in juvenile animals, and no important potential risks have 
been observed in the nonclinical studies that might be relevant for paediatric patients.

Instructions for reconstitution: 
1.  Shake the glass bottle to ensure the granules move around freely and no caking of the granules has 
occurred. 
2.  Measure 105 ml of purified water and add to the glass bottle. Note that the stability of fidaxomicin 
granules suspended in mineral water, tap water, or other liquids has not been established. 
3.  Close the glass bottle and shake vigorously for at least 1 minute.  
4.  Verify that the resulting liquid has no remaining caked granules left at the bottom of the bottle or 
any lumps. If caked granules or any lumps are observed, shake the glass bottle vigorously again 
for at least 1 minute. 
5.  Let the bottle stand for 1 minute. 
6.  Verify if a homogenous suspension is obtained. 
7.  Write the date of expiration of the reconstituted suspension on the bottle label (the shelf-life of the 
reconstituted suspension is 12 days). 
8.  Store the bottle at refrigerated temperature (2-8°C) before and during use. 
9.  Select an appropriate oral syringe and bottle adaptor suitable for dispensing liquid medicinal 
product to measure the correct dose. 
After reconstitution, the suspension (110 ml) will appear as white to yellowish white. 
An appropriate commercially available oral syringe and adaptor suitable for dispensing of liquid 
medicines should be selected by the healthcare professional in order to allow the patient or caregiver 
to measure the correct dose. The adaptor should be suitable for use in combination with the selected 
oral syringe and fits the bottle neck size, for example a press-in bottles adaptor (27 mm) or universal 
bottle adapter. 
In case the treatment with fidaxomicin started in a hospital setting and the patient is discharged before 
the end of the treatment at the hospital, the patient should be provided with the oral suspension and a 
suitable oral syringe and adaptor. Patients or caregivers should not prepare the oral suspension at 
home.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What DIFICLIR is and what it is used for 
DIFICLIR is an antibiotic which contains the active substance fidaxomicin. 
DIFICLIR film-coated tablets are used in adults, adolescents and children with a body weight of at 
least 12.5 kg to treat infections of the lining of the colon (large intestine) with certain bacteria called 
Clostridioides difficile. This serious illness can result in painful, severe diarrhoea. DIFICLIR works by 
killing the bacteria that cause the infection and helps to reduce the associated diarrhoea.  
2.  What you need to know before you take DIFICLIR 
Do not take DIFICLIR 
− 
If you are allergic to fidaxomicin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking DIFICLIR. 
If you feel that you might have a severe allergic reaction such as trouble breathing (dyspnea), swelling 
of the face or throat (angioedema), severe rash, severe itching (pruritus) or severe hives (urticaria), 
stop taking DIFICLIR and seek medical advice urgently from your doctor, pharmacist or at your local 
hospital emergency department (see section 4). 
If you are allergic to macrolides (a class of antibiotics), ask your doctor for advice before using this 
medicine. Your doctor will tell you whether this medicine is suitable for you. 
If you have kidney or liver problems, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine. Your 
doctor will tell you whether this medicine is suitable for you.

There are limited data available on the use of fidaxomicin in severe cases of the disease (e.g. 
pseudomembranous colitis). Your doctor will know whether your disease falls in the severe categories 
and will tell you whether this medicine is suitable for you. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children with a body weight below 12.5 kg, because these children 
require a reduced dose. For appropriate dosing in these patients, DIFICLIR granules for oral 
suspension may be used. 
Other medicines and DIFICLIR 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
DIFICLIR blood levels can be affected by other medicines you take, and blood levels of other 
medicines can be affected by taking DIFICLIR. Examples of such medicines are: 
− 
cyclosporin (a medicine used to dampen down the body’s immune reactions, used e.g. after an 
organ or bone marrow transplant, for psoriasis or eczema, or for rheumatoid arthritis or 
nephrotic syndrome) 
ketoconazole (a medicine used to treat fungal infections) 
erythromycin (a medicine used to treat ear, nose, throat, chest and skin infections) 
clarithromycin (a medicine used to treat chest infections, throat and sinus infections, skin and 
tissue infections and Helicobacter pylori infections associated with duodenal or stomach ulcer) 
verapamil (a medicine used to treat high blood pressure or to prevent chest pain attacks, or used

you otherwise. If you use one of these medicines, please ask your doctor for advice before taking this

taking this medicine.

4.  Verify that the resulting liquid has no remaining caked granules left at the bottom of the bottle or 
any lumps. If caked granules or any lumps are observed, shake the glass bottle vigorously again 
for at least 1 minute. 
5.  Let the bottle stand for 1 minute. 
6.  Verify if a homogenous suspension is obtained. 
7.  Write the date of expiration of the reconstituted suspension on the bottle label (the shelf-life of the 
reconstituted suspension is 12 days). 
8.  Store the bottle at refrigerated temperature (2-8°C) before and during use. 
9.  Select an appropriate oral syringe and bottle adaptor suitable for dispensing liquid medicinal 
product to measure the correct dose. 
After reconstitution, the suspension (110 ml) will appear as white to yellowish white. 
An appropriate commercially available oral syringe and adaptor suitable for dispensing of liquid 
medicines should be selected by the healthcare professional in order to allow the patient or caregiver 
to measure the correct dose. The adaptor should be suitable for use in combination with the selected 
oral syringe and fits the bottle neck size, for example a press-in bottles adaptor (27 mm) or universal 
bottle adapter. 
In case the treatment with fidaxomicin started in a hospital setting and the patient is discharged before 
the end of the treatment at the hospital, the patient should be provided with the oral suspension and a 
suitable oral syringe and adaptor. Patients or caregivers should not prepare the oral suspension at 
home. 
Recommended oral syringe capacity for measuring the dose of the oral suspension is presented in the 
table below.

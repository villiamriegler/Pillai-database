Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Atazanavir Krka 
atazanavir 
On 31 January 2019, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Atazanavir Krka, 
intended for for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and children 6 years of age and older. The 
applicant for this medicinal product is KRKA, d.d., Novo mesto. 
Atazanavir Krka will be available available as hard capsules (150 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg). The active 
substance of Atazanavir Krka is atazanavir, an inhibitor of the viral protease enzyme which is key for viral 
replication (ATC code: J05AE08). 
Atazanavir Krka is a generic of Reyataz, which has been authorised in the EU since 2 March 2004. Studies 
have demonstrated the satisfactory quality of Atazanavir Krka, and its bioequivalence to the reference 
product Reyataz. A question and answer document on generic medicines can be found here. 
The full indication is:  
“Atazanavir Krka capsules, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, are indicated for the treatment 
of HIV-1 infected adults and paediatric patients 6 years of age and older in combination with other 
antiretroviral medicinal products (see section 4.2). 
Based on available virological and clinical data from adult patients, no benefit is expected in patients 
with strains resistant to multiple protease inhibitors (≥ 4 PI mutations).  
The choice of Atazanavir Krka in treatment experienced adult and paediatric patients should be 
based on individual viral resistance testing and the patient’s treatment history (see sections 4.4 and 
5.1).” 
It is proposed that Atazanavir Krka be prescribed by physicians experienced in the management of HIV 
infection. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and made 
available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been granted by the 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 days 
from adoption of the opinion

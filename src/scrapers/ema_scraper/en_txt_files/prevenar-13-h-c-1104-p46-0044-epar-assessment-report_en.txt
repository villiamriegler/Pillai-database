I. 
INTRODUCTION 
On June 23, 2011 the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Prevenar 13, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric use. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Prevenar 13 
and that there is no consequential regulatory action. 
This study was assessed in procedure EMEA/H/C/1104 P46 042. Two questions were raised in the final 
AR  of  that  procedure,  to  which  the  MAH  has  no  responded.  The  responses  to  these  questions  are 
assessed below.  
II. 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Clinical aspects 
QUESTION 1 
With  regard  to  the  pre-challenge  serological  data:  From  the  supportive  tables  (Section  15,    tables 
12/15, 23/25, 41/43) it appears that OPA antibody titres and [geometric mean titers] GMTs are very 
similar  between  both  groups  on  visit  1  (prior  to  vaccination),  except  for  serotypes  6B,  18C  and  23F. 
For  the  latter  three  the  7vPnC  group  consistently  shows  better  protective  values.  The  company  is 
asked to comment on this and on the fact that there  is no apparent difference  in protection between 
groups with regard to the serotypes 4, 9V, 14 and 19F. 
Response 
In Study 3016, baseline serum levels of pneumococcal serotype-specific immunoglobulin  G (IgG) and 
opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) were determined in children who had been vaccinated approximately 
10  years  previously  with  a  4-dose  series  of  either  7vPnC  or  MnCC  (doses  at  2,  4,  6,  and  12  to  15 
months of age). At the time of enrollment in Study 3016, all subjects were between 11 and 14 years 
old. By this age, serum levels of anti-pneumococcal antibody are the result of a combination of infant 
vaccination  as  well  as  natural  exposure,  and  it  is  not  known  whether  vaccination  in  infancy  is  an 
important determinant of protection against pneumococcal disease among children in this age group. 
Indeed,  most  children  will  have  developed  some  degree  of  immunity  to  pneumococcal  disease  as  a 
result of natural exposure by 5 years of age, as is evidenced by the fact that pneumococcal disease is 
relatively rare in children over 5 years of age, even in the absence of infant vaccination. Thus, it is not 
unexpected  that  children  from  the  7vPnC  and  the  MnCC  groups  in  Study  3016  would  have  similar 
levels of pneumococcal IgG and OPA. 
Assessor’s  comment:  The  response  of  the  MAH  is  endorsed,  and  the  explanation  given  considered 
plausible. Issue resolved. 
QUESTION 2 
There appears very little difference in quality and quantity of the immune response upon vaccination of 
both groups with Prevenar 13. The company is asked to comment on the apparent lack of anamnestic 
response, with regard to the 7vPnC serotypes, upon vaccination of the 7vPnC group with Prevenar 13. 
Response  
As  discussed  above,  prior  to  entry  into  Study  3016,  children  in  both  vaccine  groups  had  likely 
developed protective antibodies to a range of pneumococcal serotypes as a result of vaccination and/or 
natural  exposure.  Therefore,  the  similarity  of  the  immune  response  in  the  2  vaccine  groups  post-
vaccination would not be unexpected. 
The  substantial  response  to  a  single  vaccination  of  13vPnC  also  reflects  the  status  of  the  immune 
system among the children entering Study 3016. Because of the immaturity of the immune system in 
children less than 2 years of age, 2 to 3 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine given by 6 months 
of age plus a booster dose in the second year of life are required to achieve protective and persistent 
antibody  concentrations  in  this  age  group.  However,  by  the  time  children  are  11  to  14  years  of  age 
(the age of the subjects in Study 3016), the immune system has fully matured, such that a single dose

of  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  should  be  sufficient  to  provide  a  robust  and  protective  immune 
response.  Indeed,  this  is  what  the  immunogenicity  results  from  Study  3016  demonstrate:  ie,  that 
among children in this age group, a single dose of 13vPnC is strongly immunogenic, regardless of prior 
vaccination with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. 
Assessor’s  comment:  The  response  of  the  MAH  is  endorsed  and  the  explanation  given  considered 
plausible. Issue resolved. 
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
No further data have been presented. The MAH has provided plausible explanations for the results seen 
in study 3016.

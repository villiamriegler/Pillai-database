Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan     
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Coagadex. The RMP details important 
risks of Coagadex, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Coagadex’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Coagadex’s Summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Coagadex should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Coagadex should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Coagadex’s 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Coagadex is authorised for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding episodes and for 
perioperative management in patients with hereditary Factor X deficiency (see SmPC for the full 
indication). It contains human coagulation factor X as the active substance and it is given by 
intravenous route.   
Further information about the evaluation of Coagadex’s benefits can be found in Coagadex’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/coagadex  
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the 
risks  
Important  risks  of  Coagadex,  together  with  measures  to  minimise  such  risks  and  the  proposed 
studies for learning more about Coagadex’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Coagadex is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Coagadex are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Coagadex. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. use in pregnancy);

Important Potential risk : Inhibitor development 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
•  Coagadex SmPC 
No evidence of inhibitor development has been 
identified in BPL clinical trials.  In addition, little 
published data on inhibitor development in Factor X 
deficient patients has been identified. 
In theory, any Factor X-deficient patient receiving the 
BPL factor X product could develop an inhibitor.  
Accordingly, the following language is provided in the  
SmPC (section 4.4) for Coagadex : 
In general, all patients treated with Coagadex® should 
be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors 
by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory 
tests.  If expected factor X activity levels are not 
attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an 
expected dose, perform an assay that measures factor X 
inhibitor concentration.

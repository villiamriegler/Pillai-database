2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
17 October 2019 
Head and neck squamous cell carc inoma (HNSCC) describe an anatomically heterogeneous group of 
cancers encompassing a variety of tumours originating in the lip, oral cavity, hypopharynx, oropharynx, 
nasopharynx or larynx, oral cavity and laryngeal cancers being the most common. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/591139/2019  
Page 7/150 
 
 
 
 
Epidemiology and risk fac tors, screening tools/prevention 
It is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide, accounting for 6% of all cancer cases and responsible 
for an estimated 1–2% of all cancer deaths123. In Europe, approximately 140.000 new cases of HNSCC 
were diagnosed in 2014, corresponding to an annual incidence of 43/100.000. Median age of diagnosis is 
in the late 60s and 70s45. Tobacco, alcohol, male gender and older age are risk factors for HNSCC, 
together with HPV infection for cancers located in the oropharynx. Tobacco-related HNSCC disease has 
declined, whereas HPV-positive disease has increased6. 
Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
More than 90% of head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, originating from the epithelium 
of the mucosal lining of the upper aerodigestive tract. These neoplasms are aggressive in their biologic 
behaviour, resulting in significant destructive disease above the clavicle, with the development of local 
(cervical) lymph node metastases and distant metastases, even after effective local therapy. 
Significantly, 10 to 30% of patients with cancer of the lip or oral cavity subsequently develop second 
primary neoplasms of the upper aerodigestive tract. 
HPV-related oropharyngeal cancers represent a distinct entity in terms of biology, where HPV-negative 
HNSCC disease is driven by stepwise accumulation of mutations whereas HPV-positive disease is driven 
by the integration of 2 viral oncogenes that target the P53 tumour suppressor gene. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Tumours have different clinical behaviour, with HPV-positive disease having better prognosis and better 
response to treatment compared to HPV-negative cancers. Classical presentation of HNSCC includes pain, 
dysphagia, odynophagia, dysphonia, otalgia, hoarseness, and citrus intolerance. Human 
papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal disease is characterized with early cervical lymph node 
metastases. A significant number of patients with HNSCC initially present with locoregionally advanced 
disease (American Joint Committee on Cancer stages I-IVB) and the rate of recurrence is up to 50%. 
Common sites of metastases include lymph nodes, bone, and lung. The challenges of recurrent or 
metastatic (R/M) HNSCC include pain, speech, swallowing, breathing, and social function. Survival is 
predicted primarily by stage, anatomical site and HPV status. Patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) 
HNSCC have a poor prognosis with median overall survival of under 1 year7. 
Management 
Treatment options for patients with this disease vary according to the disease setting as well as other 
clinical characteristics. Patients with localized HNSCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer stages I-IVB) 
are treated with potentially curative therapy using ≥1 treatment modalities (surgery, radiation therapy, 
chemotherapy, and biologic therapy).  In the first-line treatment of R/M HNSCC, combination therapy 
with cetuximab plus cisplatin/carboplatin plus 5-fluorouracil followed by maintenance cetuximab (the

“EXTREME” regimen) has shown the best results so far, with median survival of 10-14 months8. In clinical 
practice, other combinations, such as a taxane or cisplatin plus cetuximab, are also sometimes used as 
first-line treatment for R/M HNSCC when patients are not fit enough for the EXTREME regimen. After 
disease progression on or after 1L therapy in R/M HNSCC, the treatment options are participation in a 
clinical trial, systemic therapy or best supportive care. Systemic therapies may include 
cisplatin/carboplatin, 5-FU, cetuximab, docetaxel, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, methotrexate, 
capecitabine nivolumab and pembrolizumab.

About the product 
Keytruda  (pembrolizumab)  is  a  humanized  monoclonal  anti-PD-1  antibody  that  blocks  the  interaction 
between programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligands, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 
(PD-L1)  and  programmed  cell  death  1  ligand  2  (PD-L2).  The  PD-1  pathway,  especially  the  PD-1 
receptor-ligand interaction, represents a major immune-control switch that may be engaged by ligands 
expressed  in  the  tumour  microenvironment  to  overcome  active  antitumour-specific  T  cell  immune 
surveillance. A variety of cancers, unlike healthy organs, express abundant levels of PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 
and PD-L2. Binding of either PD-1 ligand to PD-1 inhibits T cell activation triggered through the T cell 
receptor. The high expression of PD-L1 on tumour cells has been found to correlate with poor prognosis 
and survival in various cancers and suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumour 
evasion and is, thus, an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. 
Keytruda was recently approved as monotherapy of recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma (R/M HNSCC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 TSP ≥ 50% and progressing on or after

platinum-containing chemotherapy (EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0042).  
The scope of this variation is to include a new indication for Keytruda for the first-line treatment of R/M 
HNSCC in adults, as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. The proposed indication is based 
on the results from KEYNOTE-048, a randomized, multi-center, open-label phase 3 study investigating 
pembrolizumab, or pembrolizumab plus platinum plus 5-FU chemotherapy versus platinum plus 5-FU plus 
cetuximab  in  subjects  with  first-line  recurrent  or  metastatic  HNSCC.  A  total  of  882  patients  were 
randomized to one of the 3 treatment arms. 
The MAH applied for the following indications: 
KEYTRUDA, as monotherapy or in combination with platinum and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy, is 
indicated for the first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
(HNSCC) in adults. 
The CHMP agreed to the following indications: 
KEYTRUDA, as monotherapy or in combination with platinum and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy, is 
indicated for the first-line treatment of metastatic or unresectable recurrent head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma (HNSCC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 1 (see section 5.1). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The MAH received Scientific Advice from the CHMP in 2014 on the design elements of the clinical trial 
KEYNOTE-048 (EMEA/H/SA/2437/5/2014/II). The MAH did follow some of the advice given (e.g. OS as 
most convincing proof of benefit (later upgraded from secondary to dual primary endpoint), pre-planned 
subgroup analyses by PD-L1 status).  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Pembrolizumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not be a significant 
risk to the environment. As an unaltered protein, being extensively degraded in the patient’s body by 
regular proteolytic mechanisms before excretion, pembrolizumab is unlikely to result in a significant 
environmental exposure. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of 
Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), pembrolizumab is exempt from 
submission of Environmental Risk Assessment studies as the product and excipients do not pose a 
significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
No new nonclinical data has been provided to support this application. The applicant did not submit 
studies for the ERA. According to the relevant guideline, in the case of products containing proteins as 
active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), this is acceptable.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic data from KEYNOTE-048 suggest that pembrolizumab exposures in 1L HNSCC 
participants administered with 200 mg Q3W pembrolizumab as monotherapy or in combination with 
platinum and 5-FU are consistent with the historical reference PK dataset from melanoma and NSCLC 
participants (KEYNOTE-001, KEYNOTE-002, KEYNOTE-006, KEYNOTE-010, and KEYNOTE-024) in Cycle 1 
and at steady state (Figure 1). This supports the use of the recommended pembrolizumab dose of 200 mg 
Q3W. Additional justifications for the use of the newly proposed dosing regimen of 400 mg Q6W in 1L 
HNSCC participants are provided below.

for 200 mg Q3W dose regimen 
Moreover, observed pembrolizumab serum concentration values in KEYNOTE-048 are found to be 
consistent with other approved studies in different tumour types (KEYNOTE-024 in NSCLC, KEYNOTE-045 
and KEYNOTE-052 in UC, KEYNOTE-055 in HNSCC, KEYNOTE-087 in HL, KEYNOTE-158 and

An additional dosing regimen of 400 mg Q6W has been approved in the EU on 28 March 2019 for all 
monotherapy  indications  approved  at  the  time  based  on  PK  and  exposure-response  bridging  using 
modeling and simulations analyses (procedure number EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0062). The inferences from 
these analyses support the dosing regimen of 400 mg Q6W across indications, including 1L HNSCC, given 
the similarity in PK (as outlined above) and based on the following additional rationale: 
• 
• 
• 
Pembrolizumab  acts  via  binding  to  PD-1  on  immune  cells,  not  tumour  cells;  hence  meaningful 
differences in exposure/dose-response are not expected across cancer types. 
Consistent,  flat  exposure-response  relationships  are  seen  for  pembrolizumab  in  multiple  tumour 
types 
o  Efficacy  is  seen  at  the  same  dosing  regimen  across  multiple  indications  (melanoma,  NSCLC, 
HNSCC, UC, cHL, GC, MSI-H cancers, PMBCL, HCC and cervical cancer). 
Clearance  is  similar  across  tumour  types,  suggesting  saturation  of  the  target  on  immune  cells  in 
circulation  is  achieved  at  the  clinical  dose,  which  is  the  same  across  tumour  types;  this  further 
supports that PK/exposures and exposure-response are consistent across indications. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A dosing regimen of 200 mg Q3W is recommended for pembrolizumab treatment in patients with R/M 
HNSCC, as pharmacokinetic and clinical pharmacology properties remain similar across indications.  
A robust characterization of the PK and immunogenicity of pembrolizumab has been provided in previous 
submissions in other monotherapy indications in the non-adjuvant settings. A description of the clinical 
pharmacology  of  pembrolizumab  in  subjects  with  previously  treated  HNSCC  was  included  in  the 
KEYNOTE-040 submission to support 200 mg Q3W as the recommended dose of pembrolizumab in this 
patient population (see EPAR for EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0042). 
A description of the pharmacology of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy was included in 
the KEYNOTE-021-G/KEYNOTE-189 submission (see EPAR for EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0043). This analysis 
demonstrated  that  the  PK  and  immunogenicity  of  pembrolizumab  are  not  impacted  by  concomitant 
chemotherapy. 
Considering  the  consistency  in  exposure  between  subjects  with  1L  HNSCC  tumour  treated  with 
pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W in monotherapy and subjects with other tumour type treated with the same 
regimen, the use of 400 mg Q6W as additional dosing option for pembrolizumab as monotherapy in the 1L 
HNSCC is supported by the already proposed modelling and simulation approach.  
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology data and rationale submitted support the use of the currently authorised dosing 
regimens for the first-line treatment of metastatic or unresectable recurrent HNSCC as monotherapy or in 
combination with platinum and 5 FU chemotherapy. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No specific dose-response study was conducted. The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this trial is 200 
mg every 3 weeks (Q3W). Based on the totality of data generated in the Keytruda development program, 
200 mg Q3W dose is justified by: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/591139/2019  
Page 14/150 
 
 
 
•  Clinical  data  from  eight  randomized  studies  demonstrating  flat  dose-  and  exposure-  efficacy 
relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg every two weeks (Q2W) 
• Clinical data showing meaningful improvement in benefit-risk including overall survival at 200 mg Q3W 
across multiple indications 
•  Pharmacology  data  showing  full  target  saturation  in  both  systemic  circulation  (inferred  from 
pharmacokinetic  [PK]  data)  and  tumour  (inferred  from  physiologically  based  pharmacokinetic  [PBPK] 
analysis) at 200 mg Q3W 
Among  the  eight  randomized  dose-comparison  studies,  a  total  of  2262  subjects  were  enrolled  with 
melanoma and NSCLC. All of these studies demonstrated flat dose- and exposure-response relationships 
across the doses studied representing an approximate 5 to 7.5 fold difference in exposure. Subsequently, 
flat dose-/exposure-response relationships were also observed in other tumour types including head and 
neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, confirming 200 mg Q3W as 
the appropriate dose independent of the tumour type.  
Additionally, pharmacology data show target saturation at 200 mg Q3W. 
Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, which characterized the influence of body weight and 
other  subject  covariates  on  exposure,  has  shown  that  the  fixed–dosing  provides  similar  control  of  PK 
variability as weight based dosing, with considerable overlap in the distribution of exposures from the 200 
mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. 
Supported  by  these  PK  characteristics,  and  given  that  fixed-dose  has  advantages  of  reduced  dosing 
complexity  and  reduced  potential  of  dosing  errors,  the  200  mg  Q3W  fixed-dose  was  selected  for 
evaluation across all pembrolizumab protocols.

Recurrent/Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (KEYNOTE-048) 
Methods 
Study participants 
Key inclusion criteria included: 
1.  Histologically or cytologically-confirmed R/M HNSCC that was considered incurable by local therapies. 
•  No prior systemic therapy in the recurrent or metastatic setting. Systemic therapy which was 
completed  more  than  6  months  prior  to  signing  consent  if  given  as  part  of  combination 
therapy for locally advanced disease was allowed. 
• 
• 
The eligible primary tumour locations were oropharynx, oral cavity, hypopharynx, and larynx.

administered treatment. 
4.  Had  a  life  expectancy  of  less  than  3  months  and/or  had  rapidly  progressing  disease  (e.g.  tumor 
bleeding, uncontrolled tumour pain) in the opinion of the treating investigator. 
5.  Had a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or was receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of 
immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study intervention. Corticosteroid 
use as pre-medication for allergic reactions (e.g. IV contrast), or as a prophylactic management of 
AEs related to the chemotherapies specified in the protocol was allowed.

Subjects  may  receive  a  maximum  of  6  cycles  (infusions)  of  the  chemotherapy  agents  (carboplatin, 
cisplatin, and 5-FU).  
After  platinum  and  5-FU  are  discontinued,  for  subjects  with  at  least  stable  disease,  cetuximab 
monotherapy may continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Treatment  on  trial  continued  until  disease  progression  is  verified  by  the  central  imaging  vendor, 
unacceptable AEs, intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, investigator’s 
decision, noncompliance, subject receives 24 months of study medication (pembrolizumab arms only), 
pregnancy,  or  administrative  reasons.  Subjects  on  either  pembrolizumab  arm  who  attain  a  complete 
response (CR) may consider stopping trial treatment if they meet criteria for holding therapy. Subjects 
receiving  pembrolizumab  who  stop  trial  treatment  after  receiving  24  months  of  study  medication  for 
reasons  other  than  disease  progression  or  intolerability,  or  subjects  who  attain  a  CR  and  stop  trial 
treatment may be eligible for up to one year of retreatment upon experiencing centrally-verified disease 
progression at investigator’s discretion. 
Investigators may switch subjects from cisplatin to carboplatin during the course of the study if toxicities 
occur. If the cisplatin dose was modified prior to switching, the subject may start at a carboplatin dose of 
AUC 5 and will be eligible to receive an additional 2 dose modifications of carboplatin. 
If  subjects  on  the  cetuximab  +  platinum  +  5-FU  arm  are  required  to  have  the  platinum  and/or  5-FU 
discontinued  for  toxicity,  the  subject  and  may  continue  to  receive  cetuximab  alone.  In  the  case  of 
cetuximab toxicity, subjects may continue on chemotherapy alone.  
The first on-study imaging was performed at 9 weeks after the date of randomization and then every 6 
weeks  thereafter  or  more  frequently  if  clinically  indicated.  After  1  year,  imaging  time  point  will  occur 
every  9  weeks.  Progressive  disease  should  be  verified  by  the  central  imaging  vendor  prior  to  subject 
discontinuation from treatment. Local reading (investigator assessment with site radiology reading) were 
used to determine eligibility and for subject management.

For the interim analyses, the actual timing is determined by the minimum follow-up; and for the final analysis, the actual timing is 
determined by both the expected event numbers and minimum follow-up.  However, to prevent the trial form continuing to an 
unreasonable duration, if the the expected number of deaths for a hypothesis is not observed by the time that the trial is open for 44 
months, the timing of the final analysis may be delayed for up to 2 months or when the target death event numbers are observed, 
whichever occurs first.

0.6 vs. standard treatment at alpha = 0.02% (one-sided).

The PFS sample size calculation was based on the following assumptions: 1) progression-free survival 
following an exponential distribution with a median of 6 months in the standard treatment arm; 2) hazard 
ratios equal to 0.58 for subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥20, 0.59 for subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 and 0.6 for all 
subjects; 3) an enrolment period of 21 months; 4) at least 9 months follow-up at interim analysis 1, and 
17 months follow-up at interim analysis 2; and 5) a yearly dropout rate of 5%. 
At the time of the final OS analysis: 
• 
• 
• 
for subjects with PD-L1 CPS≥20, it is expected that approximately 222 deaths will have been 
observed between one experimental treatment and standard treatment. The study has 90.5% 
power  with  each  experimental  treatment  (pembrolizumab  monotherapy  or  pembrolizumab  in 
combination with chemotherapy) to detect a hazard ratio of 0.6 vs. standard treatment at alpha 
= 0.7% (one-sided). 
for  subjects  with  PD-L1  CPS≥1,  it  is  expected  that  approximately  359  deaths  will  have  been 
observed between one experimental treatment and standard treatment. The study has 94.3% 
power  with  each  experimental  treatment  (pembrolizumab  monotherapy  or  pembrolizumab  in 
combination with chemotherapy) to detect a hazard ratio of 0.65 vs. standard treatment at alpha 
= 0.7% (one-sided). 
for all subjects, it is expected that approximately 455 deaths will have been observed between 
one experimental treatment and standard treatment. The study has 87.85% power with a hazard 
ratio  of  0.85  to  establish  non-inferiority  (NI  margin  =  1.2)  for  each  experimental  treatment 
(pembrolizumab  monotherapy  or  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy)  vs. 
standard treatment at alpha = 0.7% (one-sided) (that is, the treatment could be considered as 
non-inferior to the standard treatment arm in terms of OS if the upper bound of the CI, based on 
the alpha level allocated to the analysis for the HR is <1.2). 
• 
for all subjects, it is expected that approximately 455 deaths will have been observed between 
one  experimental  treatment  and  standard  treatment.  The  study  has  90.4%  power  with  each 
experimental  treatment  (pembrolizumab  monotherapy  or  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy)  to  detect  a  hazard  ratio  of  0.7  vs.  standard  treatment  at  alpha  =  0.7% 
(one-sided). 
The OS sample size calculation was based on the following assumptions: 1) overall survival following an 
exponential distribution with a median of 10 months in the standard treatment arm; 2) the hazard ratios 
equal to 0.6 for subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥20, 0.65 for subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥1, 0.7 for all subjects for 
the superiority hypotheses, and 0.85 for all subjects for the non-inferiority hypotheses; 3) an enrollment 
period of 21 months; 4) at least 23 months follow-up at the final analysis; and 5) a yearly dropout rate of 
2%. 
The assumptions for median PFS of 6 months and median OS of 10 months in the standard treatment arm 
were based on the median PFS and median OS estimates from the EXTREME trial. The assumptions do not 
take  into  account  potential  prognostic  implications  in  a  biomarker  selected  population.  As  such,  the 
median  of  the  standard  treatment  arm  for  the  PD-L1  positive  subgroups  may  be  more  or less  than  6 
months for PFS and more or less than 10 months for OS. 
Randomisation 
Randomization occurred centrally using an interactive voice response system / integrated web response 
system (IVRS/IWRS). Subjects were assigned randomly in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the 3 treatment arms. 
Randomization was stratified according to the following factors: 
1.  PD-L1 tumour expression by TPS (≥50% vs not ≥50%)  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/591139/2019  
Page 22/150 
 
 
 
2.  HPV status (positive vs. negative); HPV status for oropharynx cancer was determined by p16 IHC. 
HPV status for subjects without oropharynx cancer (e.g. cancers of the oral cavity, hypopharynx and 
larynx) was considered HPV negative. 
3.  ECOG Performance Scale (0 vs. 1) 
Blinding (masking) 
Study was open-label.  
PD-L1 status of all participants was blinded to both Investigators and the Sponsor. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy population  
The analysis of primary efficacy endpoints were based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, i.e., 
subjects were included in the treatment group to which they were randomized.  
Statistical methods 
Table 5: Efficacy analysis methods 
The  non-parametric  Kaplan-Meier  method  was  used  to  estimate  the  PFS/OS  curve  in  each  treatment 
group. The treatment difference in PFS/OS was assessed by the stratified log-rank test. A stratified Cox 
proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling was used to assess the magnitude of the 
treatment difference (i.e., hazard ratio) between the treatment arms. The hazard ratio and its 95% CI 
from the stratified Cox model with a single treatment covariate was reported.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/591139/2019  
Page 23/150 
 
 
 
 
The same stratification factors used for randomization were used as the stratification factors in both the 
stratified log-rank test and the stratified Cox model (as well as in the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen 
method) for the analyses in all subjects and in subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥1. For analyses in the PD-L1 CPS 
≥20 subgroup, HPV status and ECOG status were used as the stratification factors. In case the event 
count in any stratum is <5, for the analysis purpose, stratification factors would be combined in the order 
of ECOG->HPV status->PD-L1 status (defined by TPS) until event count in every stratum is ≥5. 
Sensitivity analyses 
To  account  for  the  possible  non-proportional  hazards  effect  associated  with  immunotherapies,  two 
sensitivity analyses were conducted, the first based on the weighted log-rank test with parameter (0,1), 
the other using the restricted mean survival time (RMST) method. 
Adjustment for the effect on OS of crossover (of subjects in the standard therapy arm that may switch to 
another anti PD-1 treatment following confirmation of progressive disease) is planned based on methods 
such  as  Rank  Preserving  Structural  Failure  Time  (RPSFT)  model,  two  stage  model,  etc.,  based  on  an 
examination of the appropriateness of the data to the assumptions required by the methods. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed for PFS, ORR and DOR based on investigator's assessment. 
In order to evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint per RECIST 1.1 by central imaging vendor, two 
sensitivity analyses with a different set of censoring rules were performed. The censoring rules for PFS 
primary endpoint and sensitivity analyses are summarized in the following table:

Two interim efficacy analyses and a final analysis are planned in this study. A summary table of PFS and 
OS analysis strategy is shown in section “sample size”.  
At first interim analysis (IA1), PFS/OS analyses took place when all subjects have been followed up for at 
least  9  months.  Assuming  21  months  enrolment  period  for  825  all  subjects,  interim  analysis  1  was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/591139/2019  
Page 24/150 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
projected  to  occur  ~30  months  after  study  start,  with  the  primary  objective  to  demonstrate  PFS 
superiority of pembrolizumab (monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy). 
The second interim analysis (IA2), which is the final PFS analysis, took place when all subjects have been 
followed up for at least 17 months.  Assuming 21 months enrolment period for 825 all subjects, interim 
analysis  2  was  projected  to  occur  ~38  months  after  study  start,  with  the  primary  objective  to 
demonstrate OS superiority of pembrolizumab (monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy). A 
PFS  hypothesis  was  to  be  tested  only  if  superior  PFS  was  not  declared  for  that  hypothesis  at  interim 
analysis 1 (IA1). 
Subgroup analyses 
To determine whether the treatment effect is consistent across various subgroups, the estimate of the 
between-group treatment effect (with a nominal 95% CI) for the primary endpoint was estimated and 
plotted by treatment group within each category of the following classification variables: 
PD-L1 expression level defined by CPS (≥20 vs. not ≥20; and ≥1 vs. not ≥1) 
•  Stratification factors 
• 
•  Age category (<65 vs. ≥65 years) 
•  Sex (female vs. male) 
•  Race (white vs. all others) 
•  Region (North America [NA] vs European Union [EU] vs Rest of the World [ROW]) 
•  Smoking status (never vs. former vs. current) 
•  Disease status (recurrent vs. metastatic) 
Subgroup analyses did not use stratified analyses. The consistency of the treatment effect was assessed 
descriptively. 
Multiplicity 
The overall type I error rate was strongly controlled at 2.5% (one-sided) with: 
•  0.19% allocated to each PFS hypothesis of pembrolizumab monotherapy vs. standard treatment 
(H1)  and  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  vs.  standard  treatment  (H4)  in 
subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥20; 
•  0.02%  allocated  to  PFS  hypothesis  of  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  vs. 
standard treatment in all subjects (H6); 
•  0.7% allocated to each OS hypothesis of pembrolizumab monotherapy vs. standard treatment 
(H7)  and  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  vs.  standard  treatment  (H11)  in 
subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥20; 
•  0.7%  allocated  to  OS  non-inferiority  hypothesis  of  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy vs. standard treatment in all subjects (H13). 
The alpha reallocation strategy followed the graphical approach of Maurer and Bretz, as reported in the 
following figure:

The stratified Miettinen and Nurminen’s method was used for comparison of the objective response rates 
between the treatment groups.  
For subjects who demonstrate CR or PR, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR 
or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. DOR was assessed using 
RECIST 1.1 separately by BICR and by investigator’s assessment.

The PRO analyses are based on the PRO FAS population, defined as all randomized participants who have 
at least 1 PRO assessment available and have received at least 1 dose of the study medication. PROs were 
evaluated using the EORTC QLQ-30, EORTC QLQ-H&N35 and the EQ-5D questionnaires.  
Results 
Participant flow 
Note:  “Completed”  in  the  Follow-up  phase  indicates  the  participant  completed  24  months  (initial 
treatment phase) of treatment with pembrolizumab. 
Recruitment 
This study was conducted at 228 centres in 37 countries. First participant first visit was on 01-APR-2015, 
last patient was randomized on 17-JAN-2017. 
Enrolment in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group was paused on 13 August 2015 and reopened 
on 2 October 2015, based on the external DMC recommendation after 20 participants were randomized to 
that group, following the review of the first 3 death events in 14 participants enrolled in that group as of 
24-JUL-2015. After the DMC completed their safety assessment of those 20 subjects who had completed 
2 cycles of study treatment, the DMC recommended lifting the enrolment pause.  
Interim Analysis 2 (IA2): data cut-off is 13-JUN-2018, data-base lock is 29-JUN-2018.  
At the IA2, the median duration of follow-up was 13.0 months (range: 0.1, 36.6) in the pembrolizumab 
plus  chemotherapy  group  and  10.7  months  (range:  0.1,  35.3)  in  the  standard  treatment  group.  The 
Assessment report

median  follow-up  duration  for  all  subjects  was  11.7  months  (range:  0.2,  37.3)  in  the  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy group and 10.7 months (range: 0.1, 35.3) in the standard treatment group. 
Final Analysis (FA): data cut-off is 25-FEB-2019, data-base lock is 25-MAR-2019. The median duration of 
follow-up was 13.0 months (range: 0.1, 43.4) in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 10.7 
months  (range:  0.1,  40.7)  in  the  standard  treatment  group.  The  median  follow-up  duration  for  all 
subjects was 11.5 months (range: 0.2, 45.7) in the pembrolizumab monotherapy group and 10.7 months 
(range: 0.1, 41.8) in the standard treatment group.

Original protocol. 
Increased sample size from 750 to 780 subjects, including the first 600 
subjects with any level of PD-L1 expression and the remaining 180 
subjects with strongly positive PD-L1 expression 
Enrollment target was updated from 780 to 825 subjects, OS was added 
to the primary objectives and hypotheses, and the description of the 
biomarker selected population was updated. In addition, the SAP was 
updated to: 1. Move OS from a secondary efficacy endpoint to primary, 2. 
For PD-L1 positive sub-populations, updated strongly positive and 
positive as defined by tumour proportion score (TPS) to PD-L1 ≥20% 
CPS, PD-L1 ≥10% CPS, and PD-L1 ≥ 1% CPS. 3. Updated analysis 
populations, statistical methods, power and sample size calculation, 
multiplicity strategy, interim analysis plan, and subgroup analyses, 
accordingly. 
CPS 10% was removed from the analyses plan.  Only the 20% and 1% 
CPS cutpoints will be analyzed. Therefore, references to PD-L1 10% CPS 
were removed. Hypothesis numbering was modified accordingly. 
Increased follow-up time at the interim and final analyses by 3 months, 
and updated timing of each analysis. Power calculations and analysis 
plan (expected timing, required number of events and boundary 
properties) were updated accordingly. 
Updated the dose modifications table for pembrolizumab including the 
addition of guidelines for the management of myocarditis based upon 
health authority feedback; added hypotheses for PFS and OS superiority 
in the biomarker positive subpopulation for comparison of 
pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy versus standard 
treatment; increased the follow-up period by 3 months for the second 
interim analysis and final analysis with power calculations and analysis 
plan updated accordingly, moved DOR to an exploratory endpoint; added 
OS and PFS hypotheses in the biomarker-positive subpopulation for 
pembrolizumab combination therapy, and updated the multiplicity 
strategy accordingly; and added language to allow for collection of 
survival status for subjects in all phases of the study at time points 
specified by the Sponsor. 
Modified to indicate the number of expected events, rather than required 
events; references to “event-driven” were removed and text was 
modified to describe the timing of the final analysis to account for the 
scenario if the number of deaths for 1 hypothesis accumulates slower 
than expected to prevent the trial continuing for an unreasonable period 
for the final analysis.

Change from TPS to CPS score 
TPS is defined by the percentage of neoplastic cells expressing PD-L1 at any intensity (weak, moderate, 
or strong), and only takes into account the expression of PD-L1 on neoplastic cells. 
CPS is defined by the number of tumour cells and mononuclear inflammatory cells within the 
tumourtumour nests and the adjacent supporting stroma expressing PD-L1 at any intensity divided by 
number of tumourtumour cells, then multiplied by 100. 
In  KEYNOTE-048,  with  protocol  amendment  05  (dated  05-AUG-2016),  the  pre-specified  biomarker 
scoring method for the analysis of efficacy was updated from TPS to CPS, and the biomarker cut point for 
efficacy analyses was changed from strongly positive PD-L1 (TPS ≥50%) to CPS ≥20, CPS ≥10, and CPS 
≥1 (and subsequently limited to CPS ≥20 and CPS ≥1 in protocol amendment 07, dated 17-MAR-2017). 
Similarly, the PD-L1 biomarker analysis population and cutoff in KEYNOTE-040 (2L HNSCC study) was 
changed from TPS ≥50% to CPS ≥1 during the study (protocol amendment 10, dated 10-MAR-2016).  
Based on data from KEYNOTE-012 for BOR, PFS, and OS, the MAH considered that PD-L1 expression in 
both  tumour  and  infiltrating  immune  cells  (CPS  scoring)  showed  improved  association  with  clinical 
outcome under pembrolizumab treatment when compared with PD-L1 expression in tumour cells alone 
(TPS scoring). In KEYNOTE-012, patients whose tumours were CPS ≥1 showed increased response rates 
relative to patients whose tumours were CPS<1. In contrast, the 1% and 50% TPS cutoffs showed fairly 
similar response rates above and below the cutoff and there seemed to be poor sensitivity in general 
when scoring tumour alone. 
In  addition,  based  on  clinical  utility,  sensitivity,  specificity,  as  well  as  the  prevalence  of  patients 
associated with various PD-L1 cut points evaluated in this analysis, the MAH selected CPS ≥1 and CPS 
≥20 as the biomarker cutoffs for PD-L1 assessment in KEYNOTE-048. The CPS assay was analytically 
validated and the testing site personnel appropriately trained on CPS ≥20 and ≥1 before implementation 
to determine PD-L1 status in the KEYNOTE-048 study. Furthermore, the MAH considered that the survival 
benefit in CPS ≥1 and CPS ≥20 populations at the IA2 of KEYNOTE-048 demonstrated clinical validation 
for the scoring method. Additionally, the MAH reported that the method has been extensively analytically 
validated  in  HNSCC  by  the  MAH’s  IHC  partner,  Agilent,  to  demonstrate  sensitivity,  robustness  and 
reproducibility.  
PD-L1 expression was based on the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDxTM Kit. 
Protocol deviations 
A total of 308 (34.9%) of the 882 randomized participants had one or more important protocol deviations 
(ie, those that may significantly impact the quality or integrity of key study data or that may significantly 
affect a participant’s rights, safety, or wellbeing): 85 patients (28.2%) in the pembro mono, 116 (41.3%) 
in the pembro combo, and 107 (35.7%) in the control arm.  
Important protocol deviations were reported across the following categories: 
•  Had no documented initial consent to enter the trial, or did not have their consent form updated per 
the  Informed  Consent  implementation  plan  following  a  significant  safety  change  to  the  Risk 
Language/Informed Consent (following site/regional approval of the ICF), 
•  Entered into the study (ie, progressed beyond screening) and did not meet key inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, 
•  Received incorrect study intervention and/or were administered improperly stored study intervention, 
•  Received prohibited concomitant intervention, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/591139/2019  
Page 29/150 
 
 
 
•  Experienced an SAE/ECI/pregnancy and information was not reported as required per the protocol, 
•  Missed key safety or efficacy procedures which may impact participant safety or data integrity. 
No important protocol deviations were classified as GCP compliance issues. 
Changes Following Study Unblinding 
Following the DMC review on 23-JUL-2018 and the unblinding of the study team and program statisticians 
on  26-JUL-2018,  it  was  identified  that  one  participant  randomized  to  the  pembrolizumab  plus 
chemotherapy  group  was  erroneously  excluded  from  the  analyses  comparing  the  efficacy  of 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy to standard treatment. After the discovery and following confirmation 
of the error, the analysis dataset was updated to subsequently include this participant. No data points 
were altered in the clinical database or the SDTM source data to fix this error, and that the change was 
implemented only in the analysis dataset.  
On 11-OCT-2018, several cases of measurement discrepancy were reported by independent reviewers 
and  PAREXEL  Medical  Imaging  (PXL)  staff,  where  the  value  presented  in  ALICE  (Medical  Imaging 
proprietary viewing software) differed from the value captured in the ANALYSIS eCRF. A decision was 
made to remediate measurement discrepancies through a modified re-review in a consistent manner for 
all MSD studies where PXL was utilized as the central imaging vendor. In KEYNOTE-048, 16 participants 
were  identified  by  PXL’s  assurance  tool  with  measurement  discrepancies  in  scope  for  the  remediation 
process.  Following  remediation,  a  change  in  assessment  occurred  with  4  participants.  A  sensitivity 
analysis performed with these 4 new assessments showed minimal impact to IA2 PFS assessment for 
KEYNOTE-048. The findings do not impact the OS outcomes.

The choice of platinum compound in KEYNOTE-048 was made by the investigator before randomization, 
which  was  documented  in  IVRS.  Overall,  approximately  60%  received  carboplatin  and  40%  received 
cisplatin  at  first  dose  in  the  pembrolizumab  +  chemo  group  and  standard  treatment  group.  In  the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and standard treatment group, 119 (43.1%) and 119 (41.5%) 
participants  were  assigned  to  receive  cisplatin,  respectively.  During  the  study,  33.6%  (40  of  119 
participants)  and  30.3%  (36  of  119  participants)  switched  from  cisplatin  to  carboplatin  in  the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and standard treatment groups, respectively. For participants who 
switched from cisplatin to carboplatin, the median number of cycles of cisplatin and carboplatin received 
in  the  pembrolizumab  plus  chemotherapy  group  was  2  cycles  and  2 cycles,  respectively,  and  in  the 
standard treatment group was 2 cycles and 3 cycles, respectively.

pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus standard treatment 
pembrolizumab monotherapy versus standard treatment. 
No  comparisons  were  conducted  between  the  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  and  pembrolizumab  plus 
chemotherapy group. 
A total of 882 participants were randomized to either pembro mono (301) or pembro combo (281) or to 
the control arm (300).  
Due to an enrolment pause in the pembro combo arm recommended by the external DMC that occurred 
between 13-AUG-2015 and 02-OCT-2015, 22 subjects enrolled in the control arm during the pause were 
excluded  for  the  comparison  between  the  pembro  combo  vs  control,  according  to  ITT  principle.  As  a 
result, the primary efficacy analyses were based on the ITT population which included:  
•  559 participants in the pembro combo (n=281) versus control (n=278) analysis; 
•  601 participants in the pembro mono (n=301) versus control (n=300) 
Efficacy endpoints have been analyzed for three populations: 
• 
• 
• 
ITT (all participants regardless of PD-L1 status),  
PD-L1 CPS ≥1 population,  
PD-L1 CPS ≥20 population.  
Quality-of-life endpoints in the treatment group comparisons have been analyzed for three populations: 
• 
patient  reported  outcomes  FAS  population  (referred  to  as  the  “PRO  FAS”  population  and 
consisting of all participants regardless of PD-L1 status who were randomized and treated and 
had at least one PRO assessment)

The  MAH  provided  the  results  of  the  second  interim  analysis  (IA2)  of  this  study,  which  was  a 
time-driven analysis, occurring approximately 38 months from study start (data cut-off 13-Jun-2018, 
all participants were followed for at least 17 months) (results are from IA2 unless differently indicated).  
During the procedure, the MAH provided the final analysis (FA) data (data cut-off 25-Feb-2019). At 
FA, only Hypotheses 11, 12, and 10 were tested for statistical significance and the corresponding p-values 
were  used  for  statistical  inference.  For  the  other  tables  in  this  section,  p-values  were  provided  for 
descriptive purpose only.

§ Alpha spending at IA1 and IA2 was determined using the spending function, and the information fraction (ratio of the 
actual number of events at the interim analyses relative to the targeted events at the final analysis as specified in the 
protocol). The final analysis used the remaining Type I error not spent at earlier analyses, regardless of the number of 
events observed at the final analysis. The p-value boundary at final analysis was calculated by considering the correlation 
between the test statistics as determined by the actual number of OS events at the previous and current analysis.

Primary endpoints 
OS – pembro combo vs control 
At IA2 in the ITT population, treatment with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy resulted in a statistically 
significant and clinically meaningful benefit in OS over standard treatment (HR 0.77 [0.63, 0.93], p = 
0.00335). The OS results at the FA confirmed the results at IA2 (HR 0.72 [0.60, 0.87]). In the population 
of participants whose tumors express PD-L1 CPS ≥1 or PD-L1 CPS ≥20, at the final analysis, statistically 
significant superiority in OS was demonstrated for pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy over standard 
treatment. Overall, OS HR point estimates improved compared to the IA2 in the ITT population and all 
CPS subgroups, with the exception of CPS<1 population (from 1.07 to 1.21).

PFS - pembro combo vs control 
PFS was not tested at FA, as prespecified in the protocol. PFS did not show improvement; however, PFS 
rates at 9 and 12 months were higher in pembrolizumab combination compared to control.

PFS sensitivity analysis 1 and PFS sensitivity analysis 2, yielded results similar to the primary analysis for 
the overall population. A comparison of PFS based on investigator’s assessment for the overall population 
performed as sensitivity analyses yielded similar results as the analyses based on BICR.

Analysis of objective response with both confirmed and unconfirmed responses yielded similar results as 
analysis with confirmed responses, in all three populations analysed. 
Overall, no relevant changes in ORR are observed at the updated cut-off date for the final analysis 
compared to the results at the IA2.  
Patients Reported Outcomes - pembro combo vs control 
The PRO FAS population (i.e. all participants regardless of PD-L1 status who were randomized and treated 
and  had  at  least  one  PRO  assessment)  included  270  participants  in  the  pembrolizumab  plus 
chemotherapy group and 260 participants in the standard treatment group who completed the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The compliance rates for the EORTC QLQ-30 were similar in both pembro combo 
and  control  arm  at  baseline  (94.4%  vs  93.8%)  and  remained  high  at  Week  15  (82%  vs  78.9%). 
Compliance rates at baseline through Week 15 were similar for the EORTC QLQ H&N35 and EQ-5D.

Proportional Hazards (PH) assumption for OS  
The PH assumption for OS was examined using both graphical and analytical methods. From both the 
plots  and  p-value  from  the  test,  there  is  evidence  of  departure  from  the  PH  assumption  in  the  ITT 
population of pembro combo vs control. 
Plot  of  log(-log(survival))  against  log(time)  was  generated  for  pembro  combo  vs  control  in  the  ITT 
population. If the PH assumption was satisfied then the curves should be approximately parallel to each 
other. Plot of Schoenfeld residuals versus survival time was generated for pembro combo vs control in the 
ITT population. If the PH assumption was satisfied then the plot of scaled residuals over time should be 
randomly distributed at either side of the “zero” line.

The PH assumption was also tested at the 0.1 significance level by including treatment*time as a factor in 
the model (see table below). Nonsignificance (p-value >0.1) of this factor would suggest proportionality. 
Table  29:  Assessment  of  proportional  hazard  assumption  for  overall  survival  Cox  PH  Model  with 
treatment-by-time interaction 
To  account  for  the  non-proportional  hazards  effect  associated  with  immunotherapies,  two  sensitivity 
analyses were conducted: 
1)  Weighted log-rank test with parameter (0,1) (which puts more weight on the late differences between 
the survival curves, commonly seen with immunotherapy, rather than early differences)

PFS2 (IA2: cutoff date 13-JUN-2018) 
PFS2 was defined as the time from randomization to subsequent disease progression after initiation of an 
anti-cancer  therapy  subsequent  to  discontinuation  of  study-specified  treatments,  or  death  from  any 
cause, whichever occurs first. If progression after next-line therapy cannot be measured, a PFS event is 
defined as end or discontinuation of next-line treatment or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. 
Subjects alive and for whom a PFS event has not been observed should be censored at the last time 
known to be alive and without second disease progression.

Primary endpoints 
OS – pembro mono vs control 
OS benefit in the ITT population did not reach statistically significant superiority at FA (HR 0.83 [0.70, 
0.99], p=0.01985).  
In the population of participants whose tumours express PD-L1 CPS ≥1 or PD-L1 CPS ≥20, comparing 
pembrolizumab monotherapy to standard treatment, FA OS results confirmed the statistically significant 
OS benefit observed at IA2. 
Overall,  OS  HR  point  estimates  improved  compared  to  the  IA2  in  the  ITT  population  and  all  CPS 
subgroups, with the exception of CPS<1 population (from 1.37 to 1.51).

Analysis of objective response with both confirmed and unconfirmed responses yielded similar results as 
analysis with confirmed responses. 
ORR results at the updated FA cut-off date were consistent with the results at the IA2. ORR was lower in 
pembrolizumab monotherapy responders; however, more responders achieved a complete response. 
Patient Reported Outcome – pembro mono vs control 
The PRO FAS population (i.e. all participants regardless of PD-L1 status who were randomized and treated 
and had at least one PRO assessment) included 294 and 280 participants in the pembrolizumab and in the 
control group, respectively. The compliance rates for the EORTC QLQ-30 were similar in both pembro

The PH assumption for OS was examined using both graphical (not shown) and analytical methods (see 
above “ancillary analyses” in pembro combo comparison section). From both the plots and p-value from 
the test, there is evidence of departure from the PH assumption in all the three population (ITT, CPS≥1, 
CPS≥20) of pembro mono vs control.

To  account  for  the  non-proportional  hazards  effect  associated  with  immunotherapies,  two  sensitivity 
analyses were conducted: 
1)  Weighted  log-rank  test  with  parameter  (0,1)  (see  above  “ancillary  analyses”  in  pembro  combo 
comparison section) 
2)  Restricted mean survival time (RMST) method

A third or higher lines of therapy was administered to a similar rate of subjects in both arms: 56 (18.6%) 
vs 54 (18%) in pembro mono vs control.  
The  most  frequently  used  2L  therapy  was  carboplatin  in  21.3%  of  pembrolizumab  monotherapy 
participants, and paclitaxel in 13.0% of standard treatment participants, and the most frequently used 3L 
therapy being paclitaxel in 8.0% of pembrolizumab monotherapy participants, and nivolumab in 5.7% of 
standard treatment participants.

The study was designed to compare pembro combo to standard treatment, and to compare pembro 
mono to standard treatment. No comparison was conducted between pembro mono and pembro 
combo groups.  
22 subjects enrolled in the control arm during an enrollment pause in the pembro combo arm were 
excluded for the comparison between the pembro combo vs control, according to ITT principle.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
KEYNOTE-048  is  an  ongoing,  Phase  3,  randomized,  multicenter,  active-controlled,  3  arms,  open-label 
clinical study in first line patients with R/M HNSCC considered incurable by local therapies. 
The eligibility criteria of the study are considered acceptable, and the enrolled population appears overall 
representative of real life, although data are restricted to patients with good performance status (ECOG 
0-1). 
Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to three arms: pembro combo (pembrolizumab + cisplatin/carboplatin + 
5FU), pembro mono (pembrolizumab) or standard treatment (cetuximab + cisplatin/carboplatin + 5FU, 
known  as  EXTREME  regimen).  The  EXTREME  regimen  is  considered  an  appropriate  comparator  in 
accordance with current treatment guidelines, and overall, the control arm performed as expected based 
on the EXTREME pivotal study (Vermorken, 2008).  
The  use  of  cisplatin  or  carboplatin  based  on  investigator’s  decision  (taken  before  randomization)  is 
considered  clinically  appropriate.  The  use  of  platinum  compounds  appeared  balanced  in  the  ASaT 
population (approximately 40% received cisplatin and 60% carboplatin in both chemo-containing arms). 
While the use of platinum compound was quite balanced in the two arms of CPS≥1 population, in CPS<1 
~10% more subjects started with cisplatin in the control group, on the contrary more patients (~8%) 
received cisplatin at first dose in the pembro combo arm of CPS≥20 population. During the study, 33.6% 
(40 of 119 participants) and 30.3% (36 of 119 participants) switched from cisplatin to carboplatin in the 
pembrolizumab  plus  chemotherapy  and  standard  treatment  groups,  respectively,  with  no  overall 
imbalances in exposure to each platinum compound in those subjects.

The study was designed to compare pembro combo to standard treatment, and to compare pembro mono 
to  standard  treatment.  No  comparison  was  conducted  between  the  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  and 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy groups.  
Participants were stratified according to PD-L1 (TPS≥50% vs not ≥50%), HPV (positive vs negative) and 
ECOG (0 vs 1). Stratification factors appear appropriate.  
OS and PFS (by BICR per RECIST 1.1) were the primary efficacy endpoints in KEYNOTE-048. They were 
tested  for  superiority  of  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  and  pembrolizumab  plus  chemotherapy  over 
standard treatment, respectively, in 3 populations: 1) PD-L1 CPS ≥20, 2) PD-L1 CPS≥1, and 3) ITT. The 
choice  of  OS  and  PFS  as  primary  endpoints  are  considered  of  relevance  for  the  evaluation  of  clinical 
efficacy.  
KEYNOTE-048  is  an  event  and  time  driven  trial.  The  sample  size  was  chosen  to  achieve  the  required 
number of PFS and OS events at the time of the 1st planned analysis, followed by time driven analysis at 
a 2nd interim and final timepoints.  
Most common reason for non-eligibility was ECOG ≥2 (20.8%). A total of 882 patients were recruited and 
randomized in 228 centers worldwide from 1-APR-2015 to 17-JAN-2017.  
Overall, the important protocol deviations occurred in a similar rate in each of the 3 treatment arms, thus 
not raising concern on relevant impact on study results. 
Several changes to the sample size and to the follow-up have been made with respect to the original 
protocol. Likely due to these changes regarding the extension of the sample size and of the follow-up 
time, more PFS/OS events than planned have been observed in all populations (except for the CPS ≥20 
population), inflating the power and affecting minimal detectable HRs that slightly shift toward the null 
hypothesis.  Expected  timing  of  the  analyses  was  updated  to  reflect  changes  in  follow-up  time,  and 
efficacy boundaries used to control the type I error were adjusted according to the alpha level spent at the 
actual  time  of  IA2  (following  the  predefined  spending  function)  and  to  the  number  of  PFS/OS  events 
actually observed at the cut-off date. 
As occurred in study KEYNOTE-040, leading to the approval of pembrolizumab in the 2LR/M HNSCC (see 
Keytruda EPAR var II/42), the PD-L1 scoring method was changed from TPS (tumor proportion score, i.e. 
PD-L1 expression on tumor cells only), used as stratification factor, to CPS (combined  positive score, 
considering PD-L1 expression on tumour and immune cells infiltrating the tumour stroma), applied for the 
analysis of efficacy. In both KEYNOTE-040 and KEYNOTE-048, the choice of the new scoring system was 
based on external data from the single arm study KEYNOTE-012, showing that CPS with cut-off 1 was able 
to discriminate patients with worse and better outcome compared to TPS. The biomarker cut point for 
efficacy analyses was also changed from strongly positive (TPS≥50%) to CPS≥20, CPS≥10, and CPS ≥1, 
although  subsequently  the  cut-point  of  10  was  removed  with  protocol  amendment  n.7  (dated 
17/03/2017). The final analyses were therefore conducted according to the new CPS score with cut-offs 
≥20 and ≥1. 
The evaluation of the proportional hazards assumption indicates that there is evidence of departure from 
the PH assumption, commonly seen with immunotherapy.  
Overall, approximately half of the subjects in the control arm received a subsequent anticancer therapy 
after being treated within the trial (18% at least 2 further lines). Subsequent checkpoint inhibitors were 
used by participants in the KEYNOTE-048 study (no crossover was pre-specified). In the ITT population, 
a much larger number of participants crossed over to checkpoint inhibitors in the standard treatment 
group (about 25%) compared with the number of participants who crossed over to checkpoint inhibitors 
in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group (5.3%) or in the pembrolizumab monotherapy group 
(4.3%). Sensitivity analyses performed to analyse the phenomenon of switching showed OS results in the

ITT  as  well  as  in  subgroups  according  to  PD-L1  score  for  both  comparisons  similar  to  the  respective 
primary analyses (with the exception of the method that censors patients crossing over, suggesting a 
different timing of switching occurring in the two treatment arms).   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The results originally submitted by the MAH were based on the pre-planned IA2 (i.e. final for PFS and 
interim for OS) with a data cut-off date 13-JUN-2018. During the procedure, the MAH provided the results 
relative to the Final Analysis with a data cut-off date 25-FEB-2019. 
The two comparisons are reported separately below. 
1) PEMBRO COMBO vs CONTROL 
Baseline characteristics in the ITT population appeared overall well balanced. Median age was 61, with 
about 35% of patients over 65 in both arms. About 40% of subjects had ECOG 0 and 60% ECOG 1. A 
higher  proportion  of  female  (20.3%  vs  12.9%)  and  current  smoker  (19.9%  vs  12.9%)  was  however 
observed  in  the  pembro  combo  compared  to  the  control  arm.  Approximately  33%  of  patients  were 
enrolled in EU region. Overall, 70% of patients had metastatic disease and 30% recurrent. Baseline tumor 
size  appeared  slightly  higher  in  the  pembro  combo  compared  to  control  (median  67.3  vs  58.7  mm, 
tumor≥ITT  median  52%  vs  44.6%).  A  shorter  time  from  the  latest  platinum  therapy/prior  systemic 
therapy in the pembro combo compared to control is also observed. Overall, approximately half of the 
subjects in both arms had received a prior systemic therapy for primary/locally advanced/with curative 
intent. When analysing PD-L1 expression, 23% of patients overall had TPS≥50% (stratification factor). 
The distribution according to CPS appeared also quite well balanced for CPS≥1 (~85% in both arms), 
while there was 5% more patients of CPS≥20 tumors in the pembro combo compared to the control arm 
(44.8% vs 39.6%). For comparison, a similar rate of TPS≥50% (25%) and CPS≥1 (80%) tumors was 
seen in the 2L study KEYNOTE-040.   
The distribution of patients with CPS scores (≥1 and ≥20) were overall balanced between the treatment 
arms.  However,  when  considering  the  CPS≥1  and  CPS≥20  populations,  some  imbalances  (>5% 
difference) in baseline characteristics among the two treatment arms are noted (e.g. in both populations: 
more  female,  more  metastatic  disease,  higher  disease  tumour  burden  and  shorter  time  from  latest 
platinum/prior systemic therapy in pembro combo vs control; in CPS≥1 population: more current smoker 
in pembro combo vs control; in CPS≥20 population: older and more ECOG 1 subjects in pembro combo vs 
control). Overall, additional analyses to explore the potential impact of factors with relevant imbalance 
between treatment arms in the two populations CPS≥1 and CPS≥20 show that the imbalances observed 
have not had a relevant impact on the treatment HR estimates. 
Overall,  at  the  IA2,  an  OS  event  occurred  in  about  76%  of  the overall  population.  In  the  comparison 
pembro combo vs control, OS reached statistical significance in the ITT population only (HR 0.77, 95%CI 
0.63, 0.93, p=0.00335), although this result was of borderline statistical significance (p-value boundary 
0.0041). Gain in median OS was 2.3 months in the ITT population. The OS result in the higher PD-L1 
expression population of CPS≥20 resulted to be not statistically significant, although the HR estimate (HR 
0.69, 95%CI 0.51, 0.94) as well as the appearance of the KM curve seems to suggest a clinical benefit in 
this population. As per the multiplicity analysis strategy, because the OS hypothesis for CPS≥20 was not 
statistically significant, the CPS≥1 hypothesis could not be tested (OS HR was 0.71 (95%CI 0.57, 0.88) 
p=0.00072 in CPS≥1). At visual inspection, in all three populations analysed (ITT, CPS≥1 and CPS≥20) 
the  survival  KM  curves  of  the  two  arms  appear  to  overlap  up  to  month  8,  then  divide  and  remain 
separated in favour of pembro combo, with a difference in OS rate at 15 months of ≥10%. Extensive 
censoring in the OS curves is seen from month 16 onward.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/591139/2019  
Page 89/150 
 
 
 
 
Compared to the IA2, OS at the final analysis resulted to be statistically significant superior for pembro 
combo compared to control in the CPS≥1 and CPS≥20, while at the IA2 statistical significance superiority 
was demonstrated in the ITT only. OS HRs point estimates tend to improve from the IA2 to the FA in the 
ITT as well as in all subpopulation according to PD-L1 expression (with the exception of worsening result 
in CPS<1, see below). 
The RMST sensitivity analyses showed that the benefit of pembrolizumab over standard treatment seems 
to  increase  over  time  in  term  of  OS,  according  which,  based  on  the  confidence  intervals,  there  is  an 
indication  of  a  difference  in  terms  of  RMST  based  on  24  months  of  follow  up  in  the  ITT  and  CPS≥1 
populations in pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy vs standard treatment comparison.  
No PFS advantage with the experimental treatment is observed (not statistically significant in the ITT and 
in  the  CPS≥20,  while  not  tested  in  the  CPS≥1  per  multiplicity  strategy).  PFS  curves  are  mostly 
overlapping, although a separation in the PFS curve is seen after month 6, particularly in the CPS≥20 
subgroup.  
There was no observed ORR advantage for pembro combo over the EXTREME regimen. ORR (according to 
BICR per RECIST 1.1, with confirmation) was around 35% in each treatment arm, although in pembro 
combo a higher rate of complete responses is seen (3% in chemotherapy vs 6% in pembro combo, rising 
to 9% in CPS≥20). On the contrary, there was about 5% more PD as best response in the pembro combo 
arm. While ORR and median time to response were similar, median DOR was longer (6.7 vs 4.3 months) 
in  the  pembro  combo  arm,  with  a  higher  rate  of  responses  that  last  ≥6  months  (53%  vs  37%).  The 
advantage in duration of response does not appear however remarkable, and lower than what observed 
when pembrolizumab is used a single agent (see below). This lower duration of response in pembro in 
association  with  chemotherapy  compared  to  pembro  monotherapy  has  also  been  observed  in  indirect 
comparison in the NSCLC setting (see Keytruda II/60), likely due to some responses with pembro combo 
being (solely) attributable to the chemotherapy component.  
The MAH was requested to provide exploratory statistics in the populations according to PD-L1 expression 
CPS<1, CPS 1-19 and CPS<20. Based on the data provided, the main concern pertains to the negative 
PD-L1 subgroup (i.e. CPS<1), representing 15% of the ITT population (39 vs 43 pts in pembro combo vs 
control, respectively). In this subgroup, no advantage in OS is seen (HR=1.07) with KM curves totally 
overlapping;  PFS  appears  clearly  negative  (HR=1.49).  Response  rate  is  lower  with  pembro  combo 
compared to standard treatment (ORR 30.8% vs 39.5%) and no advantage in duration of response is 
evident either (median DOR 5.7 vs 4.3 months, responses ≥6 months duration 47% vs 49%). At the final 
analysis the longer follow-up indicated a trend for worse OS results in the CPS<1 population [HR=1.21 
(95% CI 0.76, 1.94)], which is of concern. As pointed out by the MAH, some patients with CPS<1 disease 
could benefit from the use of immunotherapy in combination with chemo upfront, such as ECOG 0 or HPV 
positive patients. However, on the other hand, the standard treatment could be a better option in subjects 
with ECOG 1 or HPV negative. Numbers are however too limited to draw conclusion in this regard. It is 
acknowledged that the CPS<1 is a small and exploratory subgroup for which the study was not powered 
for, and that OS was statistically significant superior in the CPS≥1 subgroup and in the ITT population. 
However, it is considered that the lack of biological plausibility in using pembrolizumab in CPS<1 disease, 
together  with  the  overall  similar/slightly  inferior  results  in  CPS<1  population  for  pembrolizumab 
combination  over  EXTREME,  do  not  satisfactorily  support  the  substitution  of  cetuximab  with 
pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  platinum/5-FU  chemotherapy,  which  represents  a  potentially  less 
active combination, with no clear advantage in terms of tolerability for patients with PD-L1 CPS<1. Thus, 
the indication of pembrolizumab combination is restricted to patients whose disease expresses PD-L1 with 
CPS score ≥1. 
Baseline  global  health  status/QoL  scores  were  similar  between  the  pembrolizumab  and  standard 
treatment groups in the PRO FAS population. Over 15 weeks of follow-up, participants showed overall 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/591139/2019  
Page 90/150 
 
 
 
 
stable global health status/QoL in both arms. The K-M curves of time to deterioration for global health 
status and pain indicate a detrimental effect of the pembrolizumab combination compared to the standard 
treatment.  K-M  curves  for  swallowing  are  instead  overlapping.  The  open-label  design  hampers  the 
interpretation of data. No proposal for inclusion of PRO data in the SmPC has been made, which is agreed. 
Relevant differences in efficacy according to age (<65, 65-74, 75-84 years) are not seen in the ITT or in 
the CPS≥1 and CPS≥20 populations. However, results in the older age subgroup (75-84 years) should be 
interpreted with caution because of the small sample size (14 and 26 in the pembro combo and control 
arm, respectively). The limited amount of data available in over 75 subjects has been reflected in the 
SmPC. 
Subgroup analyses according to disease status suggest an apparent very limited benefit of pembro combo 
over standard treatment in recurrent disease in the ITT population as well as in the CPS≥1 subjects (but 
not in the CPS≥20 population). 
In  the  HPV  positive  subgroup  a  pembro  combo  benefit  is  observed  in  OS,  PFS  and  ORR. For  the  HPV 
negative subgroup the median OS was only slightly higher, PFS results were similar and ORR was slightly 
less compared to the control arm. 
2) PEMBRO MONO vs CONTROL 
For  the  comparison  pembro  mono  vs  control,  the  ITT  population  included  301  and  300  patients 
randomized  to  pembrolizumab  and  to  chemotherapy  arm,  respectively.  89.3%  vs  96.5%  had 
discontinued trial medications in the two arms at the cut-off date, main reason being radiological disease 
progression (62% vs 64.8%). Clinical progressions were however more common in the pembrolizumab 
arm: so, when considering discontinuation due to radiological and clinical progression and death, this is 
slightly  higher  in  the  pembro  arm  (216/301=72%,  204/300=68%).  Discontinuations  due  to  adverse 
events were more commonly observed in the chemotherapy arm (11% vs 15.3%) as expected. Overall, 
patient disposition appears similar in the CPS≥1 and CPS ≥20 populations.   
Baseline characteristics in the ITT population appeared overall well balanced. In the pembro monotherapy 
arm, a shorter median time from the latest platinum therapy/prior systemic therapy compared to the 
control arm is observed, similarly to pembro combo. Overall, approximately half of the subjects in both 
arms  had  received  a  prior  systemic  therapy  for  primary/locally  advanced/with  curative  intent.  When 
analysing PD-L1 expression, 22% of patients overall had TPS≥50% (stratification factor). The distribution 
according to CPS appeared also quite well balanced for CPS≥1 (~85% in both arms). CPS≥20 subjects 
were 44.2% and 40.7% in the pembro mono and the control arm, respectively. 
However, when considering the CPS≥1 and CPS≥20 populations, some imbalances (>5% difference) in 
baseline  characteristics  among  the  two  treatment  arms  are  noted,  particularly  in  the  higher  PD-L1 
expression  subgroup  (in  CPS≥1  population:  less  EU  subjects,  shorter  time  from  latest  platinum 
therapy/prior systemic therapy in pembro mono vs control; in CPS≥20 population more female, higher 
median  age,  more  HPV  negative,  shorter  time  from  prior  systemic  therapy  in  the  pembro  mono  vs 
control). Overall, additional analyses to explore the potential impact of factors with relevant imbalance 
between treatment arms in the two populations CPS≥1 and CPS≥20 show that the imbalances observed 
have not had a relevant impact on the treatment HR estimates.  
Overall, at the IA2 approximately 75% of the total population has experienced an OS event. In the ITT 
population,  OS  in  the  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  arm  resulted  non-inferior,  but  not  statistically 
significantly superior, compared to the control arm (OS HR=0.85, 95% CI 0.71, 1.03, median OS 11.6 vs 
10.7 months). Statistically significant OS superiority was instead demonstrated in both positive PD-L1 
subgroups (CPS≥1: HR 0.78 [0.64, 0.96], p = 0.00855, gain in median OS of 2 months; CPS≥20: HR 0.61 
[0.45, 0.83], p=0.00074, gain in median OS of 4.2 months). While the H7 hypothesis (i.e. OS in CPS≥20) 
is most compelling from a statistical perspective, the H8 hypothesis (CPS≥1 superiority in mono vs. SOC 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/591139/2019  
Page 91/150 
 
 
 
 
comparison) resulted to be statistically significant due to the α-shift from H14 hypothesis (OS combo) to 
H7 hypothesis (OS mono). At the final analysis, OS superiority for mono vs SOC in the ITT population was 
again not demonstrated. 
As  repeatedly  observed  with  anti-PD1/PDL1  agents,  a  worse  early  performance  of  pembro  mono 
compared to the standard treatment is seen, with KM curves crossing around month 8. While this crossing 
is evident in the ITT and in the CPS≥1 populations, this appears less definite in the CPS≥20 group. After 
the crossing of the KM curves, the pembrolizumab monotherapy curve lies above the control arm one, 
with long-term advantage for some patients more pronounced the higher PD-L1 expression is (difference 
in OS rate at 12 months: 5% in the ITT, 7% in CPS≥1, 12% in CPS≥20). Instantaneous hazard rates 
between 0 and 6 months generally favour the chemotherapy arm in the CPS≥1 and CPS≥20 populations. 
This issue is of particular concern for CPS≥1 patients. Indeed patients who died over the first 6 months 
were 73 in pembro mono arm and 54 in EXTREME arm; of those, 52 vs 27 died due to PD (i.e. 20% vs 10% 
of the overall population in each arm). In the 1≤CPS<20 population, subjects dying due to PD during the 
first 6 month of treatment have more than doubled in pembro mono vs standard treatment (29 vs 13). 
The  data  provided  confirmed  an  early  detrimental  effect  with  pembro  mono  vs  chemotherapy. 
Considering  the  results  obtained  from  specific  analyses  performed  to  explore  the  issue  of  the  early 
detrimental effect of immunotherapy compared with chemotherapy, it is believed that at the moment no 
specific  recommendation  can  be  included  in  the  SmPC,  since  consistency  of  results  obtained  from 
different studies is needed to make the results strong and convincing.   
The OS RMST sensitivity analyses underline that the benefit of pembrolizumab over standard treatment 
increases over time and based on the confidence intervals, for the pembro mono comparison, there is an 
indication of a difference in terms of RMST based on 24 months of follow up in the CPS≥20 population 
only. 
PFS did not show statistically significant improvement (HR 1.34, 95%IC 1.13, 1.59). It is observed that 
the KM curves of PFS2 in the ITT population are crossing as well, with a very late separation after month 
10. 
Although  slightly  improving  with  higher  PD-L1  expression,  the  ORR  to  pembrolizumab  monotherapy 
remains steadily below the response rate achieved with chemotherapy (ORR in the ITT population: 17% 
vs 36%). Rate of stable disease is lower for pembro mono than for standard treatment as well. Few more 
complete responses are however observed with pembrolizumab monotherapy compared to chemo. On 
the  contrary,  as  known  with  immunotherapy,  the  median  DOR  was  substantially  longer  (21  vs  4.5 
months), and patients who achieve tumour response with pembro mono have high chance to respond for 
a long time (response duration ≥6 months 75% vs 39% in the ITT population). Median time to response 
was similar in both arms (2.1 months).  
Exploratory  analyses  of  the  complementary  PD-L1  populations  CPS<1,  1≤CPS<20  and  CPS<20  have 
been provided, showing no benefit from the use of pembrolizumab over standard treatment in all the 
subgroups, and clearly negative results for pembrolizumab monotherapy in the CPS<1 population.  
Therefore, the demonstration of a non-inferiority (and lack of superiority) in the ITT population is not 
considered supporting the clinical benefit of pembro mono in this 1L HNSCC setting (moreover based on 
NI margin which has not been justified), in light also of a (not so early) crossing of OS curve (at month 8). 
This is further corroborated by negative PFS and ORR data. An indication in the overall population was 
therefore not agreed by the CHMP. The MAH subsequently decided to restrict the sought indication for 
pembrolizumab monotherapy to CPS≥1 population only. 
For the 1≤CPS<20 population, representing about 40% of the overall population, the OS HR for pembro 
mono  is  0.86  (95%  CI  0.66,  1.12),  OS  KM  curves  cross  at  about  8  months,  then  overlap  and  clearly 
separate only at around month 15 in favour of pembrolizumab; the separation of the curves is rather

Page 92/150 
 
 
 
 
small; however a small proportion of patients appear to derive a long-term benefit compared to SOC also 
in this subgroup. The early inferior OS of pembrolizumab is also reflected by a 10% lower OS rate at 
month 6 (68% vs. 78%). In the 1≤CPS<20 population, an indication for pembrolizumab monotherapy 
could be acceptable as a treatment alternative, if taking the considerable better safety profile compared 
to the SOC into account.  
Quality  of  life  evaluation  showed  similar  baseline  global  health  status/QoL  scores  between  the 
pembrolizumab  and  standard  treatment  groups  in  the  PRO  FAS  population,  with  overall  stable  global 
health status/QoL over 15 weeks of follow-up. The K-M curves of time to deterioration for global health 
status and pain indicate a detrimental effect of the pembrolizumab combination compared to the standard 
treatment. An opposite tendency is seen for swallowing. 
The  apparent  trend  towards  decreasing  effect  of  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  compared  to  standard 
treatment is observed with increasing age in the ITT and in the CPS≥1 populations (not evident in the 
CPS≥20 subgroup, where however 75-84 years patients are only 12 overall). Data in patients over 75 are 
limited, based on a small sample size.  
According to subgroup analysis, there is no clear benefit of pembro mono over standard treatment in the 
recurrent setting in CPS≥1 population.  
The OS result appears less convincing in female patients compared to male in subgroup analyses, 
however definitive conclusions are hampered by the small sample size of female subjects, which is by the 
way expected based on the epidemiology of the disease. Among subjects who died within the first 6 
months from randomization a higher rate of female is seen in pembro mono compared to control in CPS≥1 
and ≥20 populations.  
A small benefit in median OS in favour of pembro mono is observed in HPV negative patients. KM curves 
cross around month 9 indicating an early favourable effect for standard treatment. For HPV positive 
patients the KM curves are similar between the treatment arms. No PFS advantage is observed compared 
to standard treatment regardless of HPV status. Higher response rates were observed in the standard arm 
compared to Pembro Mono. The ORR difference between the treatment arms is smaller in the HPV positive 
subgroup. 
KEYNOTE-048 study was not statistically powered to compare the two pembrolizumab-containing arms. 
This is acknowledged. However, the MAH was requested to provide a descriptive comparison between 
pembrolizumab monotherapy and pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy. OS in pembro mono and pembro 
combo arms appear overall quite similar. However, while KM OS curve of the pembro mono lies slightly 
below the one of pembro combo in the ITT population, curves appear closer in CPS≥1 up to completely 
overlapping in the CPS≥20 subgroup. Across all 3 populations (ITT, CPS≥1, CPS≥20), PFS and ORR were 
clearly in favour of the pembro combo. Conversely, mDOR and the number of durable (i.e. ≥6 months) 
responses were higher in the pembrolizumab monotherapy group. Median time to response was similar.  
When taking the data for the pembro combo into account in the 1≤CPS<20 population, a higher risk of 
early  death  is  observed  with  pembro  mono  vs  SOC  but  not  with  pembro  combo  vs  SOC,  reflected  by 
similar 6 months OS rates for both treatment arms; the OS HR improves to 0.71 and the curves separate 
earlier and slightly more pronounced in the later parts compared to observations for monotherapy. Thus 
lastly, the considerably improved safety profile of the monotherapy has to be weighed against the better 
efficacy outcome for the pembro combination therapy. Regarding long-term efficacy, the difference is not 
so prominent anymore (OS rates at 18 months 34.5% vs. 31.8% and OS rates at 24 months 25.9% vs. 
22% for pembro combo vs. pembro mono, respectively). From a regulatory point of view, it is acceptable 
to allow individual treatment decisions based on patients preferences if a clear presentation of efficacy 
data  in  the  SmPC  in  a  comparative  way  is  included  in  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  for  the  subgroups 
1<CPS<20 and CPS≥20. 
Assessment report

Page 93/150 
 
 
 
 
In patients with CPS≥20, the relevance for the addition of chemotherapy to pembrolizumab monotherapy 
appears questionable in view of the added toxicity of the chemotherapy. However, individual patients 
might benefit from combination therapy especially when a response with tumour shrinkage is needed, 
due to the higher ORR of pembro combo. Information regarding the B/R evaluation being dependent on 
CPS status has been included in section 4.4, as well as efficacy data for the CPS ≥20 subgroup in section 
5.1 of the SmPC. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Pembrolizumab  combination  demonstrated  statistically  significant  superiority  compared  to  EXTREME 
regimen in all the 3 pre-specified populations (ITT, CPS≥1 and CPS≥20). As opposed to the ITT and the 
other biomarker subpopulations, the longer follow-up indicated a trend for worse OS results in the CPS<1 
population, together with inferior results for PFS and ORR, and the lack of DOR benefit. Acknowledging 
that the CPS<1 is a small and exploratory subgroup for which the study was not powered, the lack of 
biological plausibility in using pembrolizumab in CPS<1 disease, together with the overall similar/slightly 
inferior results in CPS<1 population for pembrolizumab combination over EXTREME, do not satisfactorily 
support  the  substitution  of  cetuximab  with  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  platinum/5-FU 
chemotherapy. Thus, the indication of pembrolizumab combination is restricted to patients whose disease 
expresses PD-L1 with CPS≥1 score. 
For  pembrolizumab  monotherapy,  an  indication  restricted  to  the  CPS≥1  population  is  considered 
acceptable. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The overall safety profile of pembrolizumab, evaluated across clinical studies in patients with different 
solid tumours, is mainly associated with immune-related adverse reactions, and characterised by general 
(fatigue, decreased appetite), gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhoea, constipation), respiratory (cough, 
dyspnoea), and skin (pruritus and rash) disorders.  
The safety profile to support the claimed indications for use of pembrolizumab in combination with 
chemotherapy based on platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and 5-FU, and as monotherapy for 1L 
treatment of patients with R/M HNSCC is based on the second interim analysis (IA2) in all subjects as 
treated (ASaT) of the KEYNOTE-048 study.  
The IA2 was a time-driven analysis with data cut-off date 13-JUN-2018 (database lock date 
29-JUN-2018), when all the participants had the opportunity to be followed for at least 17 months. Out of 
the 882 randomized subjects, 863 participants were included in all safety comparisons (the ASaT 
population). 
Supportive data is provided by the pooled safety databases of HNSCC Safety DS for pembrolizumab and 
Pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD.  
The pooled HNSCC Safety DS for pembrolizumab is used to reflect existing safety information of 
pembrolizumab monotherapy for HNSCC in the 2L+ treatment setting (N=609).  
The pooled safety data from the Pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD enable comparison of safety of 
Pembrolizumab + Chemotherapy and of Pembrolizumab monotherapy for HNSCC with the established 
safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy across all the other indications (N=3830).

Adverse events 
AEs were coded using MedDRA (Version 21.0). All safety analyses were conducted using data from the 
ASaT population (i.e. all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment) for 
each study or cohort as of the data cut-off dates. 
The analysis of safety results followed a tiered approach. No Tier 1 safety parameters were pre-specified 
in the protocol.

Total numbers (%) of Overall Survival events in the ITT population are higher than the numbers of death 
given in the Tables “Disposition of Subjects” above: 
•  197 of 281 (70.1%) in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group versus  
•  223 of 278 (80.2%) in the standard treatment group, and 
•  213 of 301 (70.8%) in the pembrolizumab monotherapy group versus 
•  240  of  300  (80.0%)  in  the  standard  treatment  group  (see  respective  Tables  in  section  4.4.2

Narratives  were  provided  for  all  the  57  deaths  occurring  in  the  two  pembrolizumab-treated  arms  of 
KEYNOTE-048 (i.e. 25 in the pembro mono arm and 32 in the pembro combo arm).  
Based on the listing provided (data not shown), the AEs leading to death considered as drug-related by 
investigator in each arm were:  
-  in  the  pembro  mono  arm  (n=3):  pneumonitis,  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation  (DIC), 
autoinflammatory disease (1 patient each) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/591139/2019  
Page 118/150 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- in the pembro combo arm (n=10): septic shock (5 patients), sepsis, interstitial lung disease, tumour 
hemorrhage, hemorrhage, cerebral ischemia (1 patient each).   
At the final analysis cut-off date (25  February 2019), there was one additional patient  in the pembro 
combo arm who died due to a AE (bronchitis) which was classified as treatment related. However, the 
investigator considered bronchitis (Grade 5) related to carboplatin, but not related to pembrolizumab, or 
5-FU.) 
-  in  the  control  arm  (n=8):  pneumonia  (3  patients),  sepsis  (2  patients),  hypoxia,  osteomyelitis,  and 
pulmonary artery thrombosis (1 patient each). 
AEOSIs 
A prespecified list of PTs was developed to consistently characterize the nature and frequency of each 
AEOSI across the clinical program, regardless of causality as reported by investigators. These PTs are 
considered to be medically equivalent to the immune-mediated events and infusion-related reactions.

- Treatment-emergent hypothyroidism 
Table 94: Adverse event summary AEOSI – Hypothyroidism (ASaT population) 
Among  the  participants  with  treatment-emergent  hypothyroidism  in  the  pembrolizumab  plus 
chemotherapy and the Pembrolizumab monotherapy datasets, a higher proportion was male and with 
prior radiation therapy. Median time to onset of hypothyroidism was 83 days in the Pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy  dataset  and  104  days  in  the  Pembrolizumab  monotherapy  dataset  (it  was  106  days  in 
HNSCC pembrolizumab dataset). Three subjects receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy required dose 
interruption. Hypothyroidism requires long-term thyroid replacement therapy and therefore the median 
duration has not been reached in any of the safety datasets. 
Oedema 
The following preferred terms were selected: auricular swelling, ear swelling, eye oedema, eye swelling, 
orbital oedema, eyelid oedema, periorbital oedema, face oedema, swelling face, laryngeal oedema, 
laryngotracheal oedema, tracheal oedema, lip oedema, lip swelling, mouth swelling, oedema mouth, 
circumoral oedema, oedema mucosal, gingival oedema, gingival swelling, oropharyngeal swelling, 
pharyngeal oedema, epiglottic oedema, palatal oedema, palatal swelling, nasal oedema, swollen tongue, 
tongue oedema, localized oedema, local swelling, and oropharyngeal oedema.

 Every subject is counted once for each specific Renal Toxicity Events according to the worst outcome; the ordering of the 
outcomes is as follows: Fatal>Not Resolved>Resolving>Unknown>Sequelae>Resolved. 
 “Subjects in population” is used for percentage calculation for the Overall row in each section. Within each section, the 
overall total is used for percentage calculation for each outcome. 
 Outcome: Resolved = RECOVERED/RESOLVED, Resolving = RECOVERING/RESOLVING, Sequelae = 
RECOVERED/RESOLVED WITH SEQUELAE, Not resolved = NOT RECOVERED/NOT RESOLVED.

Laboratory findings 
Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy versus Standard Treatment 
The proportion of most abnormal laboratory findings was comparable among the Pembrolizumab plus 
Chemotherapy  and  the  Standard  Treatment  datasets:  Glucose  increased  54.9%  and  65.6%; 
Haemoglobin  decreased  89.4%  and  78.3%;  Leucocytes  decreased  79.3%  and  84.8%;  Neutrophils 
decreased 67.2% and 71.1%; Platelets decreased 73.2 and 76.3%. Creatinine increased was found more 
commonly in combination arm than in the standard of care (36% vs 27%). 
Pembrolizumab monotherapy versus Standard Treatment 
The  proportion  of  participants  with  abnormal  laboratory  findings  was  either  lower  (Haemoglobin

Drug-related AEs Leading to Treatment Discontinuation 
Table 112: Subjects with drug-related adverse events resulting in treatment discontinuation (incidence 
>0% in one or more treatment groups) by decreasing frequency of preferred term from KN048 Combo 
(ASaT population) 
In  the  Pembrolizumab  +  Chemotherapy  arm,  the  most  frequently  reported  (≥1.0%  incidence) 
drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation of Pembrolizumab plus Chemotherapy were Blood creatinine 
increased (5 patients; 1.8%, vs 0.3% in control arm), Mucosal inflammation, Neutropenia, Septic shock, 
Pneumonia (4 patients each; 1.4%), Pneumonitis, Thrombocytopenia, Nausea, Tinnitus and peripheral 
sensory  neuropathy  (3  patients  each;  1.1%).  Rate  of  renal  and  urinary  disorders  SOC  was  similar  in 
pembro combo and standard treatment arm (1.8% vs 2.1%). 
In  the  Pembrolizumab  monotherapy  arm,  the  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation of pembrolizumab included Pneumonitis and Autoimmune hepatitis reported in 0.7% (2 
patients) each. Of the 2 Grade 4 autoimmune hepatitis events, 1 had resolved and 1 was resolving. Of the 
2 pneumonitis events, 1 was not resolved and 1 was fatal.  
The  most  common  drug-related  AE  resulting  in  the  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  was  infusion 
related reaction and rash and anemia in the standard treatment group. 
All AEs leading to Treatment Interruption 
While proportions of subjects with AEs resulting in interruption of study intervention were 64.1% and 
63.4%  in  the  Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy  and  the  Standard  Treatment  arms,  it was 30.7%  in  the 
Pembrolizumab monotherapy arm.  
Drug-related Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Interruption 
Table 113: Subjects with drug-related adverse events resulting in treatment interruption (incidence >0% 
in one or more treatment groups) by decreasing frequency of preferred term from KN048 Combo (ASaT 
population) 
The  most  common  drug-related  AEs  leading  to  interruption  of  study  intervention  were  Neutropenia 
(15.9% 
and 
15.3%) 
and 
Thrombocytopenia 
(11.6% 
and 
6.6%) 
in 
both 
the 
Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy  and  the  Standard  Treatment  arms.  Drug-related  Anaemia  (11.6%  vs 
4.5%),  Platelet  count  decreased  (7.6%  vs  2.8%),  Neutrophil  count  decreased  (7.2%  vs  5.9%)  White 
blood cell count decreased (2.9% vs 1.0%), Blood creatinine increased (2.5% vs 0.0%) resulted more 
often cause of treatment interruption in the Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy  group compared with the 
Standard treatment group. A higher proportion of participants with drug-related Infusion-related reaction 
(3.5% vs 0.4%), Nausea (2.8% vs 0.4%), Rash (2.8% vs 0.4%), and Dermatitis acneiform (2.8% vs 
0.0%)  resulted  in  study  intervention  interruption  in  the  standard  treatment  versus  the  combination 
group.

In the Pembrolizumab monotherapy arm compared to the Standard Treatment arm, Pneumonitis (2.3% 
vs 0.0%) was the only AE leading to treatment interruption in more than 2% of subjects. 
Post marketing experience 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab was summarized in the Periodic Safety Update Report covering the 
period 4 March 2018 to 3 September 2018. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy versus Standard Treatment  
Proportions  of  subjects 
in 
the  adverse  event  summary  show  consistent  results 
in 
the 
Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy  and  the  Standard  Treatment  study  arms  for  overall  AEs  (98.2%  and 
99.7%),  drug-related  AEs  (98.2%  and  99.7%),  Grade  3-5  AEs  (95.3%  and  96.9%),  Grade  3-5 
drug-related  AEs  (84.8%  and  83.6%).  Differently,  the  rates  of  SAEs  (58.7%  vs  49.1%)  and  of 
drug-related  SAEs  (37%  vs  25.4%),  overall  deaths  (11.6%  vs  9.4%),  deaths  due  to  drug-related  AE 
(3.6%  vs  2.8%),  drug  discontinuation  due  to  AE  (30.8%  vs  27.2%),  drug  discontinuation  due  to 
drug-related  AE  (22.8%  vs  19.9%),  drug  discontinuation  due  to  SAE  (19.6%  vs  11%),  and  drug 
discontinuation due to drug-related SAE (11.2% vs 3.8%) were increased in subjects treated with the 
pembrolizumab  combination  treatment  than  in  those  receiving  standard  of  care.  After  adjusting  for 
exposure and including multiple occurrence of events, the higher incidence rates in SAEs (179 vs 158/100 
person-years)  and  in  drug-related  SAEs  (86  vs  69/100  person-years)  among  subjects  receiving 
Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy in respect to those treated with Standard Treatment were confirmed.  
In the Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy and the Standard Treatment arms, the pattern and frequency of 
most  common  AEs  were  similar  and  consistent  with  that  expected  for  platinum-based  chemotherapy. 
Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy  compared 
favourably 
to  chemotherapy 
in  skin-related  AEs, 
Hypomagnesaemia, and Hypokalaemia. This is consistent with the known toxicity profile of cetuximab, 
used in the control arm. The standard treatment was of advantage for Anaemia, Hypothyroidism, and 
Blood creatinine increased. Other AEs with a higher incidence in the pembrolizumab chemotherapy group 
compared  to  the  standard  treatment  group  were  acute  kidney  injury  (6.5%  versus  3.1%),  peripheral 
neuropathy (5.8% versus 2.8%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (5.8% versus 2.4%) and paraesthesia 
(4.0% versus 2.8%).  
The overall proportion of Grade 3-5 AEs (84.8% and 83.6%) as well as exposure-adjusted incidence rates 
(238 and 289/100 p-y) were comparable among the Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy and the standard 
treatment datasets. When adjusted for exposure, rates of Grade 3 to 5 events, stomatitis and mucosal 
inflammation were higher (events/100 person-years) in subjects on pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
compared to subjects on standard treatment, 13.1 versus 6.6 and 15.7 versus 8.9, respectively.  
The incidence of drug-related AEs was comparable in the two arms (95.3% vs 96.9%). Drug-related AEs 
more frequently reported in the pembrolizumab-combination arm when compared to Standard Treatment 
were: Anaemia (48.2% vs 41.1%), Thrombocytopenia (27.2% vs 22.0%), Hypothyroidism (12.7% vs 
0.3%), Blood creatinine increased (10.9% vs 5.2%), Peripheral sensory neuropathy (5.4% vs 2.1%), 
Malaise (6.5% 3.1%), and Acute kidney injury (5.4% vs 2.1%). On the contrary, chemotherapy-treated 
subjects  compared  to  those  receiving  pembro  combo  treatment  displayed  an  increased  frequency  of 
various  skin  -related  PTs  (e.g.  Rash  35.2%  vs  8.0%),  electrolyte  alterations,  and  infusion-related 
reactions.  
Proportions of subjects with Grade 3-5 drug-related AEs and median time to first event were comparable 
in the Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy and the Standard Treatment (71.0% and 69.0%) datasets. In the 
pembrolizumab combination arm, Acute kidney injury (4 patients, 1.4%) and Septic shock (6 patients, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/591139/2019  
Page 136/150 
 
 
 
 
2.2%) were reported more often than in the standard treatment arm (0.3% and 0.0%, respectively).  
Incidences  of  SAEs  and  exposure-adjusted  SAE  rates  were  higher  in  the  pembrolizumab  plus 
chemotherapy group than in the standard treatment group (58.7% and 179.40 events/100 person-years, 
respectively, versus 49.1% and 158.49 events/100person-years). Febrile neutropenia (5.8% vs 4.9%), 
Pneumonia (5.4% vs 6.3%), Anaemia (5.1% vs 3.1%), and Lung infection (3.3% vs 0.7%) were the most 
commonly observed SAEs in the pembrolizumab combination arm. Incidences of drug-related SAEs were 
higher  in  pembrolizumab-treated  subjects  (37.0%  versus  25.4%).  The  most  frequently  reported 
drug-related  SAEs  (≥2.0%  incidence)  in  the  pembrolizumab  plus  chemotherapy  group  were  febrile 
Neutropenia (5.1%), Anaemia (4.0%), Stomatitis (2.9%), Neutropenia (2.5%), Mucosal inflammation, 
Nausea,  Septic  shock  and  Thrombocytopenia  (2.2%  each)  in  the  pembrolizumab  plus  chemotherapy 
group.  
There were few more deaths due to AEs in the Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy arm than in the Standard 
Treatment arm [11.6% (32 patients) vs 9.4% (27 patients)]. When adjusted for exposure, event rates 
were similar (16.79 versus 16.68 events/100 person-years).  
Drug-related AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (22.8% and 19.9%) or interruption (53.6% and 
50.5%) were equally frequent among the Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy and the Chemotherapy arms.  
Based on the overall data provided, a concern was raised regarding the renal toxicity of pembrolizumab 
in  combination  with  chemotherapy,  in  particular  related  to  higher  frequencies  of  blood  creatinine 
increased, Acute kidney injury and Acute renal failure in the pembro combo arm compared to standard 
chemotherapy.  Review  of 
renal 
toxicity  by  SMQ  showed 
in  participants 
treated  with 
pembrolizumab+chemotherapy compared to subjects receiving standard of care, higher proportions of 
overall Renal AEs (27.9% vs 19.5%, respectively) as well as of all related AE categories. When stratifying 
for type of platinum compound, differences between combination treatment and standard of care were 
larger in participants treated with cisplatin than in those with carboplatin. No baseline factor predictive of 
renal toxicity was identified, but average time to onset was longer for the pembrolizumab+chemotherapy 
arm  in  comparison  to  the  cetuximab+chemotherapy  arm,  leading  to  the  hypothesis  of  a  diverse 
etiopathogenesis  (proximal  tubule  cell  toxicity  vs  immune-mediated).  In  light  of  the  above  described 
findings,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  more  detailed  information  for  renal  toxicity  events  with 
unfavourable outcome (not resolved or resolved with sequelae) [data not shown]. Overall, the proportion 
of subjects with renal toxicity were higher in patients treated with pembrolizumab+cisplatin (14/119; 
11.8%)  or  with  pembrolizumab+carboplatin  (9/197;  4.5%)  when  compared  to  those  receiving 
cetuximab+carboplatin (6/202; 2.9%) or cetuximab+cisplatin (3/120; 2.5%). However, when looking at 
exposure-adjusted incidences the difference between treatment arms was small. Among subjects with 
unfavourable  renal  events,  the  vast  majority  reported  non-immune-related  events  (none  was  treated 
with corticosteroids) and had events of mild to moderate grade in maximum toxicity. Further, a similar 
proportion  of  subjects  among  treatment  arms  received  subsequent  antineoplastic  treatment,  and 
generally the cause of death was not due to renal events. Thus, it is agreed with the MAH that evidences 
are insufficient to support changes to the SmPC. 
Regarding  the  safety  profile  of  the  pembrolizumab  combination  treatment  in  relation  to  type  of 
chemotherapy  used  (cisplatin/carboplatin),  also  within  each  platinum  compound  strata  a  higher 
proportion of SAEs (Carboplatin: 51.3% vs 43.6%; Cisplatin: 61.3% vs 45.8%) and of drug-related SAEs 
(Carboplatin:  26.4% 
vs  15.8%;  Cisplatin:  45.5% 
vs  35.0%) 
are 
found 
in 
the 
Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy  in  respect  to  Standard  of  Care  group.  Furthermore,  regardless  of 
pembrolizumab  use,  almost  all  AEs 
frequencies  were  higher 
in  subjects 
treated  with 
pembrolizumab-cisplatin than in those receiving pembrolizumab-carboplatin. As these findings seem to 
reflect  known  tolerability  differences  between  platinum  agents  and  due  to  limitations  (a  priori 
investigator’s  selection  of  chemotherapeutic  agent,  limited  sample  size,  and  post  hoc  analysis),  no 
Assessment report

definitive  conclusions  can  be  drawn  on  pembrolizumab’s  safety  when  combined  with  different 
chemotherapeutic agent.  
Pembrolizumab monotherapy versus Standard Treatment  
In the adverse event summary, although the proportion of patients who experienced AEs was similar in 
pembro mono vs the control arm, the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm showed lower rates of almost all 
AE  categories.  Adverse  Event  rates  adjusted  for  exposure  confirmed  the  favourable  safety  profile  of 
pembrolizumab monotherapy compared to chemotherapy.  
In the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm, most common AEs with incidence >20% were Fatigue (27.7% 
vs 35.5%) and Anaemia (21.0% vs 46.0%). A clear advantage of pembro mono over standard treatment 
is seen for most the AEs with exception of Hypothyroidism, as already expected for pembrolizumab.  
The  proportion  of  Grade  3-5  AEs  was  considerably  lower  in  the  Pembrolizumab  monotherapy  dataset 
compared with in the Standard Treatment (54.0% versus 83.6%, respectively). The most common Grade 
3-5 AEs in the Pembrolizumab monotherapy dataset (>5% incidence) were Hyponatremia (5.7%) and 
Pneumonia  (5.3%),  whereas  Neutropenia,  Anaemia,  and  Neutrophil  count  decreased  were  the  most 
commonly  reported  events  in  the  Standard  Treatment  dataset  (>10%  incidence).  Exposure-adjusted 
rates (34.33 and 265.74/100 p-y) confirmed the better safety profile of Pembrolizumab monotherapy 
compared to Standard Treatment. 
Frequency of drug-related AEs (58.3% vs 96.9%) and Grade 3-5 drug-related AEs (16.7% vs 69%) was 
clearly  lower  for  Pembrolizumab  monotherapy  in  respect  to  standard  treatment.  The  most  common 
drug-related  AEs  recorded  with  pembrolizumab  were  Hyponatraemia  (5.7%)  and  Pneumonia  (5.3%). 
However,  with  the  exception  of  Hypothyroidism  (13%  vs  0.3%),  overall  single  drug-related  AEs were 
more frequently observed with chemotherapy than with pembrolizumab; all hypothyroidism events were 
grade  1-2.  Few  more  events  of  grade  3-5  drug-related  pneumonitis  were  reported 
in 
pembrolizumab-treated  patients  [1.3%  (4  cases)  vs  0.3%  (1  case)].  Median  time  to  first  Grade  3-5 
drug-related  AE  was  considerably  longer  in  the  Pembrolizumab  monotherapy  arm  in  respect  to  the 
Standard Treatment arm (62.5 vs 22 days).   
Both SAEs (40.3% vs 49.1%) and drug-related SAEs (9.0% versus 25.4%), were less common in the 
Pembrolizumab monotherapy arm when compared to the Standard Treatment arm. The most common 
drug-related SAEs in the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm were pneumonitis (1%, 3 patients) and acute 
kidney injury (0.7%, 2 patients). Both events occurred in only 1 patient each in the SOC arm (0.3%). 
AEs  resulting  in  death  were  less  frequently  observed  in  participants  assigned  to  the  Pembrolizumab 
monotherapy arm when compared to standard treatment [8.3% (25 patients) vs 9.4% (27 patients)]. 
The most common SOC was Infections (3.0% vs 4.5%), with Sepsis (1.0% vs 0.7%) as the most common 
PT in the pembro arm, and Pneumonia (1.7% vs 2.1%) the most common PT in the chemotherapy arm. 
Three fatal events were classified as due to pembrolizumab-related AEs by the investigator (Pneumonitis, 
disseminated  intravascular  coagulation  (DIC)  and  autoinflammatory  disease).  The  MAH  will  continue 
monitoring  of  DIC  cases  through  routine  pharmacovigilance  activities  in  clinical  studies  and  the 
post-marketing environment.  
With  regard  to  the  event  “autoinflammatory  disease”,  this  occurred  in  a  subject  after  1  cycle  of 
pembrolizumab. In this complex case, the subject experienced also a grade 3 encephalitis, considered a 
treatment  related  AEOSI  by  the  MAH  (already  included  as  ADR  in  Keytruda  SmPC),  and  a  possible 
diagnosis of Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). The risk of HLH has been added to the list of 
ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC with the frequency of “rare” following the most recent PSUR procedure 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010403/201809, CHMP opinion adopted on 28 March 2019).   
Drug-related AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (4.7% versus 19.9%) were less frequent in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/591139/2019  
Page 138/150 
 
 
 
 
Pembrolizumab  monotherapy  arm  if  compared  to  standard  of  care  and  most  common  PTs  were 
Pneumonitis and Autoimmune hepatitis reported in 0.7% (2 patients) each. Both events are known ADR 
for  pembrolizumab.  Drug-related  AEs  leading  to  treatment  interruption  mirrored  the  same  finding: 
Pembrolizumab monotherapy 17.7% versus Standard Treatment 50.5%.  
AEOSIs 
Frequency  of  overall  AEOSIs,  SAEs  and  deaths  due  to  AEOSIs  were  not  noticeably  dissimilar  among 
KEYNOTE-048 arms. Type and frequency of specific AEOSIs were consistent with known safety profiles, 
showing  as  most  common  events  Hypothyroidism  (15.2%  and  18.0%  in  pembro  combo  and  pembro 
mono, respectively), Pneumonitis (5.4% and 6.0%), and Hyperthyroidism (4.7% and 2.7%).  
Drug-related  hypothyroidism  occurred  in  approximately  13%  of  pembrolizumab-treated  subjects 
regardless whether chemotherapy was given in association. Male gender and prior radiation therapy were 
more frequently observed in subjects experiencing this event. With the exception of a slightly shorter 
median time to onset of hypothyroidism in patients receiving pembro combo compared to pembro mono 
(83 and 104 days, respectively), overall the addition of chemotherapy to pembrolizumab did not change 
the  pattern  of  hypothyroidism  in  HNSCC.  As  seen  in  the  HNSCC  pembro  monotherapy  RSD,  in 
KEYNOTE-048 study the higher incidence of this AEOSI in the HNSCC setting compared to other disease 
site is confirmed and this has been reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Incidences  of  Pneumonitis  were  higher  in  the  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  and  pembrolizumab  plus 
chemotherapy  groups  (6.0%  and  5.4%)  compared  to  the  standard  treatment  group  (1.0%)  in  study 
KN048. These incidences were also higher when compared to the pembrolizumab monotherapy HNSCC 
and  RSD  datasets  (3.8%  and  3.7%,  respectively).  The  frequency  of  pneumonitis  was  higher  in  the 
pembrolizumab and the pembro combo arm in participants that had prior radiation (general). Numbers of 
participants  with  explicit  prior  radiation  to  the  lung  were  far  too  small,  8  of  863,  to  be  meaningful. 
Radiation  of  advanced  HNSCC  may  involve  intrathoracic  radiation,  which  is  associated  with  a  risk  of 
pneumonitis. Thus, the higher frequency of pneumonitis recorded in participants with prior radiation is 
considered to be in line with the observed increases of pneumonitis events after prior thoracic radiation 
across several other indications (also reflected in section 4.8. of the SmPC). Considering the overall data 
for KN048, a special wording with regard to the frequencies of pneumonitis in HNSCC is not warranted 
(updated frequency of pneumonitis in SmPC now 4.3%). 
Other events 
Facial  oedema  (Face  oedema  and  Swelling  face)  occurred  with  higher  rates  in  the  Pembrolizumab 
monotherapy  arm  (pembro  mono  6.0%,  pembro  combo  3.6%,  standard  treatment  3.1%),  although 
comparable with the HNSCC pembrolizumab monotherapy dataset (7.2%). Severity was Grade 1-2 in 
most cases.  
The  proportion  of  participants  with  events  of  Bleeding  from  the  tumour  site  was  higher  in  the 
Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy  (8.7%)  and  Pembrolizumab  monotherapy  (6.3%)  datasets 
in 
comparison  with  Standard  treatment  (5.6%)  arm.  Monitoring  of  fatal  hemorrhages  through  routine 
pharmacovigilance activities in clinical studies and the post-marketing environment is recommended. 
Airway obstruction events with dyspnea occurred rarely but were more common in pembrolizumab-based 
treatments 
[1% 
(3  patients) 
in  Pembrolizumab  monotherapy,  0.7% 
(2  patients) 
in 
Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy])  than  in  Standard  Treatment  arm  (0.3%,  1  patient).  Longer  time  to 
onset than in standard of care and partial or complete treatment response at the time of event in most 
subjects are not suggestive of causal relationship with drug exposure. 
Laboratory findings 
Incidence  of  most  all-grades 
abnormal 
laboratory 
findings  was 
comparable  among

Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy and Standard Treatment arms. Notably however, Creatinine increased 
was  more  often  reported  for  subjects  receiving  pembrolizumab  combination  treatment  in  respect  to 
standard of care (36% vs 27%, respectively).  
When  compared  to  Standard  Treatment,  while  none  of  the  abnormal  laboratory  findings,  except  for 
Calcium  increased,  exceeded  in  the  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  arm,  abnormalities  related  to 
myelotoxicity were all strongly reduced (Haemoglobin decreased 51.7% vs 78.3%; Leukocyte decreased 
11.2% vs 74.4%; Neutrophils decreased 7.3% vs 71.1%; Platelets decreased 11.5% vs 76.3%).   
Safety in special populations 
Comparison  of  safety  profiles  by  intrinsic  factors,  showed  enlarging  proportions  of  subjects  in  both 
pembrolizumab-containing  arms  who  discontinued  treatment,  experienced  SAEs,  and  who  died  with 
increasing  age  groups  (<65,  65-74,  75-84).  Similar  observation  is  made  in  the  control  group  when 
considering patients <65 years and between 65-74 years, while no relevant differences are seen between 
65-74 and 75-84. This could be related to a more limited number of subjects in the 75-84 class.  
Also  keeping  in  mind,  the  proportions  of  females  enrolled  in  KEYNOTE-048  study  arms  (56% 
pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy, 51% Pembrolizumab monotherapy, 38% Standard Treatment), analysis 
by Gender showed that female versus male participants of the Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy arm had 
higher  frequency  of  Grade  3  to  5  drug-related  AEs  (78.6%  vs  69.1%),  SAEs  (69.6%  vs  55.9%),  and 
drug-related SAEs (42.9% vs 35.5%). The same trend was observed in the standard chemotherapy arm, 
and  not  in  the  Pembrolizumab  monotherapy  arm,  suggesting  a  contribution  of  chemotherapy  to  the 
observation. 
As expected, participants with an ECOG status of 1 displayed a higher proportion of subjects with SAEs 
and AEs leading to study intervention discontinuations. AEs summary by Region of enrolment did not 
document significant differences among KEYNOTE-048 study arms.  
Comparison of KEYNOTE-048 study with pooled datasets 
Median duration of exposure was longest in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group (5.78 months), 
whereas the median duration of exposure was shorter in the pembrolizumab monotherapy group (3.50 
months)  than  in  the  Reference  Safety  Dataset  (4.71  months),  but  longer  than  in  the  HNSCC  Safety 
Dataset (2.83 months). This may reflect the progression of disease in subjects treated second-line for 
HNSCC, and the different indications in the RSD. 
While frequency of overall AEs was comparable across datasets, proportions of all other AE categories in 
the  Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy  arm,  being  comparable  to  those  of  the  Chemotherapy  arm,  were 
higher  than  in  pooled  datasets.  Drug-related  AEs  were  95.3%  in  Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy  and 
lower  in  the  Pembrolizumab  monotherapy  RSD  (71.8%)  and  HNSCC  pembrolizumab  monotherapy 
(63.5%)  datasets.  Incidence  and  pattern  of  common  drug-related  AEs  reported 
for  the 
Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy arm differed from those found for pooled pembrolizumab datasets. Most 
common drug-related AEs observed in the KEYNOTE-048 Pembrolizumab monotherapy arm were similar 
to the Pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD, with the exception of a higher rate of Hypothyroidism events 
(13%  vs  8.1%),  which  instead  was  consistent  with  the  HNSCC  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  dataset 
(11.2%).  
Overall incidence of drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs (71%, 15.1%, and 13.6%) and of drug-related SAEs 
(37.0%,  10.5%,  and  9.9%)  was  higher  in  the  Pembrolizumab  plus  Chemotherapy  dataset  when 
compared  to  the  Pembrolizumab  monotherapy  RSD  and  HNSCC  pembrolizumab  datasets.  In  the 
Pembrolizumab  monotherapy  dataset,  incidences  of  drug-related  Grade  3  to  5  AEs  (16.7%)  and  of 
drug-related SAEs (9.0%) were similar.  
In  comparison  to  the  Pembrolizumab  monotherapy  RSD  (4.1%)  and  HNSCC  pembrolizumab 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/591139/2019  
Page 140/150 
 
 
 
 
monotherapy  (8.9%)  datasets,  the  overall  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  death  was  higher  in  the 
Pembrolizumab  plus  Chemotherapy  dataset  (11.6%).  Event  frequency  was  in  the  Pembrolizumab 
monotherapy arm (8.3%) higher compared to the Pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD, but comparable to 
the HNSCC pembrolizumab monotherapy dataset.   
Proportions  of  deaths  were  higher  in  the  indication  R/M  HNSCC  (KN048  pembrolizumab  monotherapy 
group  [8.3%],  KN048  pembrolizumab  plus  chemotherapy  group  [11.6%]  and  in  the  HNSCC  Safety 
Dataset [8.9%]) when compared to the Reference Safety Dataset (4.1%).  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In  the  1L  treatment  of  subjects  with  R/M  HNSCC,  Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy  compared  to 
cetuximab-based  chemotherapy  showed  an  overall  similar  safety  profile.  The  toxicity  pattern  of  the 
combination  pembrolizumab  +  platinum/5-FU  appears  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of 
pembrolizumab  monotherapy  and  the  cytotoxic  agents  used.  Of  note  is  the  higher  incidence  of  SAEs 
recorded  with  pembrolizumab  plus  chemotherapy  compared  to  standard  treatment.  SAEs  which 
contributed to the higher overall incidence were distributed across several SOCs with no individual SAE 
raising special concern. Incidences of Grade 3 to 5 adverse events and of drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs 
were comparable. When adjusted for exposure, hypothyroidism, pyrexia, and blood creatinine increase 
were higher in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy than in the standard treatment group. 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy in 1L R/M HNSCC is consistent with the established 
safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy in 2L R/M HNSCC and other indications. Pembrolizumab 
monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  1L  R/M  HNSCC  favourably  compared  to  standard  treatment,  as 
expected, taking also into account the known toxicity of the poly-chemotherapy regimen EXTREME used 
as control.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. Particularly, a new warning with regard to the higher frequency of ADRs reported with 
pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy or 
chemotherapy alone has been added to the product information together with a recommendation to 
consider available treatment options before initiating treatment. The Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The only change in the leaflet is the addition of one paragraph regarding the combination products in 
section 1 “What KEYTRUDA is and what it is used for”. There are no other proposed changes to the content 
of the package leaflet; in particular the key messages for the safe use of the medicinal product are not 
impacted. Furthermore the design, layout and format of the package leaflet will not be affected by the 
proposed revisions. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Head and neck cancers describe an anatomically heterogeneous group of cancers characterized by an 
aggressive behaviour and very high mortality rate, usually with squamous histology (i.e. HNSCC), and 
overall accounting for 6% of cancer cases. Median age of diagnosis is in the late 60s and 70s, prevalently 
Assessment report

Page 144/150 
 
 
 
 
 
in male. Tobacco, alcohol, male gender and older age are considered risk factors for HNSCC, together with 
HPV infection for cancers located in the oropharynx. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the first-line treatment of R/M HNSCC, combination therapy with cetuximab plus cisplatin/carboplatin 
plus  5-fluorouracil  followed  by  maintenance  cetuximab  (the  “EXTREME”  regimen)  has  shown  the  best 
results so far, with median survival of 10-14 months. In clinical practice, other combinations, such as a 
taxane or cisplatin plus cetuximab, are also sometimes used when patients are not fit enough for the 
EXTREME regimen. For patients who are asymptomatic, treatment is usually monotherapy to balance the 
side-effects  recorded  with  combination  regimens.  Options  for  first-line  single  agent  treatment  include 
platinum-based chemotherapy, 5-FU, paclitaxel, docetaxel, methotrexate, cetuximab, gemcitabine and 
capecitabine. 
In the EXTREME study, the addition of cetuximab to cisplatin/carboplatin plus 5 FU resulted in a significant 
increase in OS compared to cisplatin/carboplatin plus 5 FU (10.1 months versus 7.4 months, respectively, 
HR of 0.80, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.99; p=0.04). The cetuximab combination regimen was associated with a 
frequency  of  Grade  3  to  4  AEs  comparable  to  the  comparator  regimen  (82%  versus  76%,  p=0.19, 
respectively). The EXTREME regimen is the only Category 1 evidence-supported combination regimen 
recommended by NCCN as 1L treatment for subjects with R/M HNSCC. The EHNS-ESMO-ESTRO Clinical 
Practice Guidelines also recommend the 1L option of cetuximab with carboplatin or cisplatin plus 5-FU. 
Although  the  EXTREME  study  resulted  in  an  improved  OS,  it  is  still  palliative,  as  the  disease  remains 
incurable,  and  newer  therapeutic  options  are  necessary  to  address  the  unmet  medical  needs  of  this 
incurable population of R/M HNSCC patients with poor prognosis. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The evidence submitted for the new indication is KEYNOTE-048, a randomized, multi-centre, open-label 
trial investigating pembrolizumab, or pembrolizumab plus platinum plus 5-FU chemotherapy versus 
platinum plus 5-FU plus cetuximab in subjects with first-line recurrent or metastatic HNSCC.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Pembrolizumab plus platinum/5FU:  
Statistically significant OS superiority was demonstrated for pembro combo vs control in all the 3 
pre-specified populations: ITT: HR 0.72 (0.60, 0.87); median OS 13.0 vs 10.7 months; CPS≥1: HR 0.65 
(0.53, 0.80); median OS 13.6 vs 10.4 months and CPS≥20: HR 0.60 (0.45, 0.82); median OS 14.7 vs 11 
months.  
In the CPS<20 and CPS≥1 to <20 populations, OS results were slightly in favour of Pembro Combo with, 
respectively, a median OS of 11.8 months vs 10.2 months (HR 0.83 [95%CI: 0.65, 1.05]) and median OS 
12.7 months vs 9.9 months (HR 0.71 [95%CI: 0.54, 0.94]). 
For the CPS ≥ 1 population, median PFS was 5.1 vs 5.0 months in Pembro Combo vs standard arm 
(HR=0.84, 95% CI: 0.69, 1.02. In the ITT PFS rates at 6 months were similar in both arms, while PFS 
rates at 9 and 12 months were in favour of Pembro Combo. In the CPS ≥1 and CPS ≥20 populations PFS 
rates at 6, 9 and 12 months were in favour of Pembro Combo. 
In the CPS ≥1 population, ORR was 36% in both arms. In the ITT, CPS ≥1 and CPS ≥20 populations, a 
higher CR rate was observed. Median DOR and higher proportion of responders ≥6 months observed in 
Pembro Combo arm in the ITT, CPS ≥1 and CPS ≥20 populations.

Pembrolizumab monotherapy: 
OS was non-inferior for Pembro Mono compared to standard treatment in the ITT population (HR=0.83, 
95% CI: 0.70, 0.99). OS rate at 12 months was 48.7% vs 44.4%.  
In the CPS≥1 population, statistically significant OS benefit for the Pembro Mono was shown with median 
OS 12.3 months (95% CI: 10.8, 14.3) versus 10.3 months (95% CI: 9.0, 11.5). The HR was 0.74 (95% 
CI: 0.61, 0.90). OS rate at 12 months was 50.4% versus 43.6%. OS rate at 24 months was 28.9% versus 
17.4%. Median response duration was longer in the Pembro Mono arm compared to standard treatment 
(22.6  vs  4.5  months)  in  the  ITT,  (23.4  vs  4.5  months)  CPS≥1  and  (22.6  vs  4.2  months)  CPS≥20 
populations, with higher proportion of long (≥6 months) responders (ITT: 77.8% vs 38.8% of those with 
a response). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Pembrolizumab plus platinum/5FU:  
In the CPS<1 population, no OS benefit was observed. Compared to the IA2, OS results seem to worsen 
with longer follow-up at the final analysis (median OS of 11.3 vs 10.7 months; at the final analysis OS 
HR=1.21, 95%CI: 0.76, 1.94; OS rate at 12 months 41.0% vs 46.5%, OS rate at 24 months 20.5% vs 
25.6% in favour of the standard arm. 
There was no statistically significant improvement in PFS in the ITT or CPS ≥20 populations, therefore, 
PFS in the CPS ≥1 population was not tested as per the multiplicity strategy. For the CPS<1, CPS≥1 to 
<20 and CPS<20 populations, no PFS benefit was observed (HR 1.46, HR 0.93 and HR 1.05, 
respectively).  
A slightly higher rate of PD was observed in the Pembro Combo for the ITT (17.1% vs 11.9%), CPS ≥ 1 
(17.4% vs 12.3%) and CPS ≥ 20 (15.1% vs 8.2%) populations. In the CPS<20, CPS≥1 to <20, CPS<1 
populations, ORR was lower in the Pembro Combo arm compared to standard treatment. For the CPS<1 
population, the median duration of response was higher in the Pembro Combo arm, however  the 
estimated response duration ≥6 months was lower in the Pembro Combo compared to standard.  
As a consequence of these results the indication was restricted to patients with CPS≥ 1. 
Pembrolizumab monotherapy: 
Pembro mono did not show statistical superiority on OS in the ITT population, but was associated with a 
higher risk of early death compared to standard treatment as reflected in the KM curves crossing at month 
8. Although OS was statistically significant in the PD-L1 expressing populations (CPS≥1 and CPS≥20), a 
higher risk of early death during the first 6 months after randomization was confirmed / also seen in this 
subset of pembro mono treated patients, compared to patients receiving EXTREME.  
At the moment no specific recommendation can be included in the SmPC, since consistency of results 
obtained from different studies is needed to make the results strong and convincing. OS and all efficacy 
results were in favour of standard treatment in the CPS<1 population. The pembro mono indication was 
therefore restricted to CPS≥1. 
For all populations, PFS results were in favour of standard treatment. The ORR was lower in the Pembro 
Mono arm compared to standard treatment in the ITT, CPS<1, CPS≥1 to <20 and CPS<20 populations. 
The median duration of response of pembro mono was shorter for the CPS<1.  
Both pembrolizumab combo and mono:

No direct comparison was performed between pembrolizumab when used as monotherapy or in 
combination with chemotherapy. Appropriate information to help physicians in the choice among the two 
alternative treatments has been included in sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The availability of only limited data on patients over 75 years has been reflected in the SmPC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Pembrolizumab plus platinum/5FU:  
Pembrolizumab combination showed an overall comparable safety profile with the SOC, with higher 
incidence of SAE (both all causality and drug-related), AE (both all causality and drug related) leading to 
deaths and leading to drug discontinuation in the pembrolizumab combination arm compared to 
chemotherapy alone. Such trend was confirmed in the exposure-adjusted analysis for all SAEs and 
drug-related SAEs. 
Most common AEs were Anaemia (58.3% vs 46.7%), Nausea (51.1% vs 51.2%), Constipation (37% vs 
33.1%), Fatigue (34.4% vs 35.5%), Neutropenia (33.7% vs 32.8%), Vomiting (32.6% vs 27.9%), and 
Mucosal inflammation (30.8% vs 28.2%). 
Higher incidence of hypothyroidism, anaemia and blood creatinine increase was seen in the pembro 
combo arm vs control. When adjusted for exposure, hypothyroidism, pyrexia, and blood creatinine 
increase were higher in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy than in the standard treatment group. On 
the contrary, increased frequency of skin-related AEs, electrolyte alterations, and infusion-related 
reactions was observed with standard treatment vs pembro combo, consistent with the known toxicities 
of cetuximab included in the control regimen.  
Pembrolizumab monotherapy: 
A favourable safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy as compared to the EXTREME regime was 
demonstrated, with the exception of hypothyroidism (reflected in the SmPC). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The interpretation of safety data in the age group ≥75 years is limited by the low number of elderly 
subjects included in the ASaT population (15 in pembro combo and 16 subjects in pembro mono group).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Pembrolizumab plus platinum/5FU:  
When cetuximab is replaced by pembrolizumab in the association with platinum/5FU for the 1L treatment 
of R/M HNSCC, a statistically significant advantage in overall survival is seen in the ITT population at the 
final analysis. KM OS curves are overlapping up to month 8, but reassuringly a crossing is not visually 
apparent. Lack of PFS and ORR advantages does not fully support the positive OS trend, but there is some 
advantage in duration of response for pembro combo vs standard treatment. 
The  benefit  of  the  pembrolizumab  combination  over  EXTREME  regimen  appear  more  pronounced  the 
higher the PD-L1 expression by CPS score is (of the ITT population, about 85% of subjects had CPS≥1 
score  and  42%  were  CPS≥20).  In  both  populations,  a  statistically  significant  advantage  in  OS  was 
reached.  Overall,  imbalances  observed  between  treatment  arms  in  the  two  populations  CPS≥1  and 
CPS≥20 had no relevant impact on the treatment HR estimates. However, although acknowledging the 
small sample size of an exploratory subgroup for which the study was not powered, concern is raised by 
the absence  of an observable OS improvement / negative results in the exploratory CPS<1 subgroup 
(15% of the ITT population). OS worsened in CPS<1 population with longer follow-up from the IA2 to the 
FA. In addition, inferior PFS and ORR results, together with no DOR advantage were observed. The lack of 
biological  plausibility  of  using  pembrolizumab  in  PD-L1  negative  patients  and  the  negative  results  of 
pembrolizumab monotherapy and combination therapy in CPS<1 subjects, do not satisfactorily support 
the  substitution  of  cetuximab  with  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  platinum/5-FU  chemotherapy, 
representing a potentially less active combination, with no clear advantage in terms of tolerability. 
Toxicity of both experimental and control arms appears substantial. The safety profile of pembro combo 
is overall consistent with the known toxic effects of each agent used in the combination. While lacking of

the typical AEs associated with cetuximab, the pembro combo arm appears characterized by a higher 
incidence of hypothyroidism (known ADR of pembrolizumab), as well as pyrexia and renal toxicity. 
Pembrolizumab monotherapy: 
Pembrolizumab monotherapy, although statistically non-inferior to the EXTREME regimen, demonstrated 
a detrimental effect during the first 8 months from randomization, and a small OS benefit afterwards. 
During the procedure, the MAH restricted the sought indication of pembrolizumab monotherapy from all 
patients to those whose tumour express PD-L1 with CPS≥1 score. A statistically significant OS benefit was 
observed  in  the  CPS≥1  and  CPS≥20  populations.  Nevertheless,  crossing  survival  curves  in  the  PD-L1 
expressing  patients  (more  pronounced  in  CPS≥1)  display  that  OS  is  in  favour  of  standard  treatment 
during the first 7-8 months. Only in patients surviving longer than 7-8 months, OS rates favour Pembro 
Mono at months 12 and 18. The higher risk of death within 6 months from randomization in subjects 
treated with pembro mono vs standard treatment was confirmed. In the CPS >1 to <20 population, the 
number of subjects who died from PD in the first 6 months of treatment was double in pembro mono 
compared to control. However, at the moment no specific recommendation can be included in the SmPC, 
since  consistency  of  results  obtained  from  different  studies  is  needed  to  make  the  results  strong  and 
convincing.  PFS  failed  to  show  improvement,  and  ORR  was  lower  in  pembrolizumab-treated  patients, 
although the patients who respond showed considerably higher chance to have durable response.  
As expected, the safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy compares favourably with the toxicity of 
the EXTREME regimen. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
For the pembrolizumab combination, acknowledging the small sample size of the exploratory subgroup of 
PD-L1  CPS<1,  for  which  the  study  was  not  powered,  the  lack  of  biological  plausibility  in  using 
pembrolizumab  in  negative  PD-L1  disease,  together  with  the  overall  similar/slightly  inferior  results  in 
CPS<1  population  for  pembrolizumab  combination  over  EXTREME,  do  not  satisfactorily  support  the 
substitution of cetuximab with pembrolizumab in combination with platinum/5-FU chemotherapy, which 
represent  a  potentially  less  active  combination,  with  no  clear  advantage  in  terms  of  tolerability.  In 
patients whose disease expresses PD-L1 with CPS score ≥1, the B/R of pembrolizumab when used in 
combination with platinum/5-FU chemotherapy is favourable since the survival benefits outweighed the 
risk in this population with dismal prognosis.  
For pembrolizumab monotherapy, an indication restricted to CPS≥1 patients is considered acceptable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of pembrolizumab as monotherapy and in combination with platinum/5-FU chemotherapy 
for the first line treatment of R/M HNSCC PD-L1 expressing CPS≥1 is positive.

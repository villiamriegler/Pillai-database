2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
TImmune  (idiopathic)  thrombocytopenia  (ITP)  is  an  autoimmune  disorder  characterised  by  a  low 
circulating  platelet  count  (thrombocytopenia),  decreased  platelet  production  and  increased  platelet 
destruction.  Thrombocytopenia  places  patients  at  risks  for  bruising,  mucocutaneous  bleeding  and  more 
seriously  intracranial  hemorrhage.  Although  its  basic  pathophysiology  has  been  elucidated,  no  clinically 
apparent cause has been established for ITP. 
TIn the US and EU, paediatric ITP (acute and chronic) occurs at an overall incidence rate of between 4.0 
and  5.3  cases  per  100,000  per  year  in  otherwise  healthy  children  <  15  years  of  age,  with  a  peak 
incidence between ages 2 and 10 and affecting boys and girls equally. Prevalence of pediatric ITP is 7.2 
cases  per  100,000  per  year.  Unlike  adult  ITP  in  which  the  majority  of  cases  are  chronic  in  duration, 
9
pediatric ITP most commonly occurs in the acute form (platelet count < 150 x 10P
P/L for < 6 months from 
diagnosis),  accounting  for  70  to  80%  of  ITP  cases  in  children.  Many  children  with  acute  ITP  require  no 
treatment  and  in  approximately  60%  to  75%  of  cases,  the  thrombocytopenia  resolves  within  2  to  4 
months  regardless  of  therapy.  Twenty  to  30%  of  paediatric  ITP  cases  are  considered  chronic  (platelet 
count < 150 x 10P
PL for > 6 months from diagnosis) and may become refractory to standard treatments. 
9/
Chronic ITP in childhood has an estimated incidence of 0.46 per 100,000 children per year. Predictors for 
chronicity  among  children  include  older  age  (>  10  years)  and  an  insidious  presentation.  In  addition, 
chronic  ITP  in  children  is  also  associated  with  higher  presenting  platelet  count  (>  20  000/μL),  lack  of 
mucosal bleeding at presentation and lack of a previous acute illness. 
TThe  risk  of  intracranial  hemorrhage  is  <  0.5%  and  increases  with  age;  this  risk  is  proportional  to  the 
9
severity  (<  10  x  10P
P/L)  and  duration  of  severe  thrombocytopenia.  One  review  of  332  medical  records 
revealed  that  17%  of  children  had  major  haemorrhage  defined  as  intracranial  bleeding,  epistaxis 
requiring cautery or nasal packing, gross haematuria, or other bleeding causing a decline in haemoglobin 
concentration.  Approximately  75%  of  bleeding  episodes  in  this  review  occurred  in  children  with  platelet 
counts < 10 x 10P
9
P/L. 
TThe  most  commonly  used  therapeutic  agents  for  pediatric  ITP  include  corticosteroids,  intravenous 
immunoglobulin  and  anti-D  immunoglobulin.  Repeated  treatments  may  postpone  the  need  for 
splenectomy, but the responses are generally transient, lasting a median time of 5 weeks. The principal 
aim  of  treating  children  with  chronic  ITP  is  to  maintain  a  haemostatically  safe  platelet  count  (>  50  x 
9
10P
P/L) and thus improve quality of life of the patient, instead of trying to normalise platelet counts. While

these  therapies  have  been  shown  to  result  in  increased  platelet  counts,  the  potential  toxicity  of  these 
agents  compels  physicians  to  weigh  the  likelihood  of  clinical  efficacy  against  the  likelihood  of  the 
occurrence of clinically relevant adverse events. 
TThe  American  Society of Haematology  (ASH)  guidelines  incorporate  both  clinical  and  platelet  count  data 
to arrive at specific treatment recommendations; for instance, children either with platelet counts < 20 x 
9
10P
9
P/L and significant mucous membrane bleeding or with platelet counts < 10 x 10P
P/L and minor purpura 
should  be  treated  with  specific  regimens  of  immunoglobulin  (IVIg)  or  glucocorticoids.  When  ITP 
symptoms  persist  after  primary  treatment  (glucocorticoid,  IVIg)  and  splenectomy,  further  treatment  is 
indicated in children with platelet counts < 30 x 10P
9
P/L and who have active bleeding. 
TThe BCSH guidelines (2003) recommend that splenectomy is rarely indicated in childhood, given that the 
risk of dying from ITP in childhood is extremely low (less than 1 in 500), and that the mortality associated 
with splenectomy is 1.4 to 2.7%. Moreover, splenectomy is not warranted in younger patients who are at 
relatively high risk for infection with encapsulated organisms. 
TThe  management  of  children  with  ITP  who  either  fail  to  respond  after  splenectomy  or  relapse  following 
splenectomy  is  often  challenging.  Rituximab  has  been  used  in  children  with  severe  chronic  ITP  who  are 
refractory  to  standard  agents,  and  treatment  with  4  weekly  doses  of  375  mg/m2  resulted  in  response 
rates  ranging  from  31  to  68%.  However,  rituximab  carries  warnings  with  regards  to  infusion  reactions, 
severe  mucocutaneous  reactions,  and  progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy,  and  5  to  10%  of 
children  with  ITP  may  develop  serum  sickness.  In  addition,  hepatitis  B  virus  reactivation  with  fulminant 
hepatitis,  hepatic  failure,  and  death  can  occur  in  patients  with  haematologic  malignancies  treated  with 
rituximab. 
TThe  MAH  applied  for the  following  indication  which  was  agreed:  “Nplate  is indicated  for  chronic  immune 
(idiopathic)  thrombocytopenic  purpura  (ITP)  patients  one  year  of  age  and  older  who  are  refractory  to 
other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).” 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The purpose of this extension of indication application is to introduce a new presentation of Nplate 
finished product with lower-strength to the currently approved range, Nplate 250 µg and 500 µg powder 
for solution for injection, for the new indication in paediatric chronic ITP patients 1 year of age and older 
who are refractory to other treatments. 
The finished product (Nplate 125 µg) is presented as powder for solution for injection containing 125 µg 
romiplostim as active substance. 
Other ingredients are: Mannitol, Sucrose, L-histidine, Hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) and 
Polysorbate 20. 
Nplate 125 µg powder for solution for injection is available only as a vial presentation consisting of a 
single-dose vial (type 1 clear glass) with a stopper (chlorobutyl rubber), seal (aluminium) and a flip-off 
cap (polypropylene). These are the same container closure system components of the currently marketed 
Nplate 250 µg and 500 µg presentations; however Nplate 250 µg and 500 µg strengths also have an 
additional presentation consisting of a vial and reconstitution kit including solvent. Prior to administration, 
Nplate 125 µg powder for solution for injection is reconstituted in the vial to give 0.5 mg/mL romiplostim 
solution, which is the same concentration of the currently approved Nplate presentations of 250 µg and 
500 µg. If the calculated individual patient dose is less than 23 µg, the solution is further diluted with

0.9% saline. The final calculated solution volume is drawn into a syringe (not supplied) for subcutaneous 
injection.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
There are no changes declared for the active substance part of Module 3. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Nplate 125 µg is supplied for single use in a glass vial containing 230 µg of romiplostim, providing 125 µg 
of deliverable romiplostim. The qualitative and quantitative composition for Nplate 125 µg vial is 
presented in Table 1 below.

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation.  
The  buffer  formulation  used  for  manufacture  of  the  125  µg  presentation  is  the  same  as  that  used  for 
Nplate  250  µg  and  500  µg.  In  line  with  Nplate  250  µg  and  500  µg,  to  ensure  that  the  final  finished 
product  post-reconstitution  is  within  the  protein  concentration  specified  in  the  label,  a  manufacturing 
concentration overage has been applied to the 125 µg presentation, . This is accomplished by diluting the 
active  substance  to  a  target  concentration  of  ,  as  established  during  process  characterization  studies, 
which will result in a  of romiplostim vial content.  
The  primary  container  closure  system  consists  of  a  3  mL  Type  I  borosilicate  glass  vial  with  a  13  mm 
elastomeric  stopper  (chlorobutyl  rubber)  and  an  aluminum  seal  with  flip  off  dust  cover  (polypropylene). 
The  material  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  container  closure  system  was  tested  for 
organic  extractables.  Overall,  there  was  no  toxicological  concern  for  the  extractable  profile  generated 
under the experimental conditions, which was similar to that of the current 5 mL vial used for Nplate 250 
µg and 500 µg. The functionality of the vial system was tested according to Ph.Eur 3.2.9 and showed the 
stopper meets the acceptable limits for functionality and was acceptable for use with the finished product. 
Container  closure  integrity  was  demonstrated  by  the  .  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Prior to use, the lyophilised product is reconstituted with with 0.44 mL water for injection (WFI), forming 
a solution for injection at 0.5 mg/mL romiplostim in histidine,  mannitol,  sucrose, and  polysorbate 20 at 
a pH of 5.0. The reconstituted product is a clear, colourless solution practically free from particles.

If the calculated individual patient dose is less than 23 µg, an additional dilution step to 125 µg/mL with 
preservative-free,  sterile,  sodium  chloride  9 mg/mL  (0.9%)  solution  for  injection  is  required  to  ensure 
accurate volume and that the isotonicity of the dose is maintained. The dose is administered with suitably 
graduated syringes for subcutaneous administration by a qualified health care professional. The company 
is  recommended  to  develop  a  reconstitution  and  dilution  kit  for  the  preparation  and  administration  of 
paediatric doses by a qualified health care professional. 
The  stability  of  these  diluted  preparations  was  assessed  after  storage  in  a  disposable  syringe  at  25°C 
(and expulsion from a 27G needle) for 0, 4 or 8 hours to support an upper limit of a 4-hour hold time in 
the clinical setting. The stability of the 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125 mg/mL samples in disposable syringes was 
compared to control samples at the same three protein concentrations that were stored in glass vials at 2 
to 8°C. Holding diluted material for up to 4 hours was supported by testing to 8 hours. 
Nplate 125 µg powder for solution for injection is stable () when reconstituted with WFI and diluted with 
saline  to  0.125  mg/mL  and  stored  in  disposable  syringes  at  25°C  for  up  to  four  hours  followed  by 
expulsion though a 27G needle, or when stored in glass vials at 2 to 8°C for up to four hours. 
No other diluents have been tested. Dextrose (5%) in water or WFI should not be used for the dilution of 
the reconstituted product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Nplate  125  µg  will  be  manufactured  at  the  currently  approved  Nplate  finished  product  manufacturing 
facility,  ,  using  the  same  equipment  used  for  the  approved  Nplate  250  µg  and  500  µg.  The  processing 
steps  (active  substance  thawing,  formulation,  bioburden  reduction  filtration,  bulk  product  hold,  sterile 
filtration,  aseptic  filling,  lyophilisation,  stoppering  and  capping)  are  the  same as  those  for the  approved 
Nplate 250 µg and 500 µg, with minor modifications made to support the 125 µg presentation ().  
The in-process controls (IPCs) for Nplate 125 µg are the same as those for the approved Nplate 250 µg 
and 500 µg with the exception of control at the filtered formulated bulk step, which was has action limits  
to ensure proper nominal romiplostim concentration upon reconstitution. 
Process validation was performed on three consecutive romiplostim finished product batches following a 
batch size bracketing approach (testing the extremes of the intended batch size range: intermediate, 
maximum and minimum batch size), using pre-defined acceptance criteria on those process steps that 
differed from the previously validated 250 µg and 500 µg strengths. Validation data demonstrate 
consistency and reliability of the Nplate 125 µg formulation, filling, lyophylisation manufacturing process 
at, showing that the manufacturing process is in a state of control. 
Comparability 
Comprehensive analytical comparability studies were executed to support the introduction of the 125 µg 
presentation. The batch analysis results on three commercial batches demonstrate that the molecular size 
distribution,  charge  heterogeneity,  potency,  biological  activity,  impurity  profiles  and  general  product 
characteristics  of  post-change  product  are  highly  similar 
to  pre-change  product.  Additional 
characterization  methods  were  included.  The  results  for  the  product  characterization  methods  all  met 
comparability assessment criteria. These results provide orthogonal and supplemental evidence to batch 
analysis results that post-change product is highly similar to pre-change product.  
Additionally, pre-  and post-change degradation rates under  accelerated  stability  conditions were studied 
for  purity  by  potency  and  subvisible  particles  and  forced  degradation  rates  were  studied  using.  For  the 
parameter,  pre-  and  post-  change  degradation  rates  were  similar  and  no  new  peaks  were  observed. 
There  was  no  change  in  results  for  either  the  pre-change  or  post-change  material.  The  statistical 
evaluation of the main peak and potency by determined that the 125 µg presentation showed degradation 
at  a  rate  statistically  equivalent  to  the  250  µg  and  500  µg  presentations.  Subvisible  particle  results 
Assessment report

demonstrated consistent results of the particle distribution for the pre-change and post change lots. The 
levels  of    ,  process  related  impurities  for  the  125  µg  finished  product  batches  are  the  same  after  3 
months and fall well within tolerance intervals established to assess comparability. Pre- and post-change 
chromatographic  profiles  and  degradation  rates  under  forced  degradation  conditions  for  the    parameter 
were similar.  
All comparability assessment criteria were met. The results demonstrate analytical comparability between 
the 125 µg presentation and the two commercially approved presentations: 250 µg and 500 µg. 
Product specification  
The  specification  for  the  lyophilised  product  consist  of  moisture  content  (colometric  or  spectroscopic 
analysis),  appearance  and  colour  .  The  specification  for  the  reconstituted  finished  product  consist  of 
appearance and colour (), clarity (), identity (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)), purity (Size 
Exclusion  High  Performance  Liquid  Chromatography  (SE-HPLC),  Cation  Exchange  HPLC  (CEX-HPLC), 
Reverse  Phase  (RP-HPLC)),  sterility  (),  bacterial  endotoxin  ,  potency  (),  protein  concentration  );  pH  (); 
polysorbate  20  ();  subvisible  particles  ();  osmolality  ().  The  finished  product  specification  acceptance 
criteria and test methods for Nplate 125 µg  are  aligned with the currently approved Nplate 250 µg  and 
500  µg  finished  product  specifications,  with  the  exception  of  appearance  and  colour:  for  the  125  µg 
presentation, the appearance, colour, and clarity attributes are tested by individual methods, to align with 
current  Amgen  practices,  whilst  for  Nplate  250  µg  and  500  µg  these  attributes  are  tested  with  a  single 
method. There is no change to the methodology as a result of this change and the methods are compliant 
with Ph.Eur. A specification for the extractable volume  is not applicable for the reconstituted product as 
there is a considerable overfill of the product and the volume that needs to be extracted is much smaller 
than the total volume.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data have been provided for three production scale batches. The provided batch data 
comply with the release specifications. 
Reference materials 
The reference materials are identical to those already approved presentations.  
Stability of the product 
Based on available stability data, on the fact that the proposed presentation has the same protein 
concentration and product contact materials and on the comparability study, the proposed shelf-life (60 
months) and storage conditions (“Store in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze. Store in the original 
carton in order to protect from light. May be temporarily removed from the refrigerator for a maximum 
period of 24 hours at room temperature (up to 25C)”), which is the same as the registered shelf life for 
the currently approved 250 µg and 500 µg presentations, is supported.  
Real time/real condition (5°C) stability data of three commercial scale batches of finished product for up 
to 24 months and for up to 6 months under accelerated (37°C) conditions were provided. The batches of 
Nplate 125 µg are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging 
proposed for marketing. The currently available stability data meet the pre-defined acceptance criteria 
under the recommended storage. The batches will remain in the real time/real condition stability program 
through the 60 month time point. Any confirmed out of specification results will be reported to the 
Regulatory Authorities.

Photostability testing for Nplate 125 µg powder for solution for injection is derived from the 250 µg and 
500 µg presentations data. This is considered acceptable.  The reported stability data are considered 
sufficient to support the application of a 60 month shelf-life at 5°C with an additional storage allowance 
for up to 24 hours at room temperature (≤ 25°C). After dilution, chemical and physical in-use stability 
has been demonstrated for 4 hours at 25C when the diluted product was held in a disposable syringe, or 
4 hours in a refrigerator (2C – 8C) when the diluted product was held in the original vial. 
The proposed post-approval stability protocol is the same as that for Nplate 250 and 500 µg 
presentations with the exceptions of some tests A minimum of one lot of drug product from the 125, 250 
or 500 µg romiplostim containing vial will be added to the ongoing post-approval stability program 
annually, as is the current practice. Vial presentations selected will vary from year to year to ensure a 
balanced program. n view of the similarity of Nplate 125 µg with Nplate 250 µg and 500 µg, this is 
considered acceptable.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality information provided to support this extension of indication has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of the new presentation Nplate 125 µg powder for solution for injection is considered to be 
acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
TIn the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
following measures related to quality aspects are recommended for further investigation: 
The company is recommended to develop a reconstitution and dilution kit for the preparation and 
administration of paediatric doses by a qualified health care professional. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant justifies the ERA omission in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental 
Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 1*, 1 June 2006). 
Romiplostim meets the criteria for compounds that may be exempted from testing because of their 
chemical structure and constituents (amino acids and proteins) which should degrade into their amino 
acid or constitutive elements in the environment. The conclusion of the applicant on environmental risk 
assessment is accepted. This medicinal product is unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
Considering the above data, romiplostim is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The MAH has conducted a paediatric ITP development program to seek approval for the use of 
romiplostim in paediatric subjects with chronic ITP. The development program for romiplostim in the 
setting of paediatric ITP consists of 3 completed studies (Studies 20060195 and 20080279, which were 
placebo controlled, and Study 20030213, which was a long-term safety and efficacy study) and 2 ongoing 
studies (Studies 20090340 and 20101221, which are both long term safety and efficacy studies).   
•Tabular overview of clinical studies 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
UPharmacokinetic characteristics of romiplostim in adults with ITP: 
The pharmacokinetics of romiplostim involves target mediated disposition, which is presumably mediated 
by TPO receptors on platelets and other cells of the thrombopoietic lineage such as megakaryocytes. This 
may explain the lack of correlation between romiplostim serum concentrations and the dose 
administered. In adults, romiplostim serum levels appear inversely related to platelet counts. 
UPharmacokinetics in paediatric patients: 
Data on PK have been collected for the paediatric studies Studies 20060195 and 20090340 and the data 
from these subjects (subjects providing PK data; N = 17 for Study 20060195 and N = 4 for Study 
20090340) are described. 
The objectives of the clinical pharmacology evaluation supporting this supplemental marketing application 
are as follows: 
• To characterise PK and pharmacodynamics (platelet count) of romiplostim in paediatric subjects 
with ITP and examine their consistency with those observed in adults; 
Assessment report  
EMA/302907/2018 
Page 14/110 
 
  
  
 
 
 
• To evaluate paediatric dosing regimen. Paediatric subjects were monitored throughout all studies 
to characterise the development of anti-romiplostim antibodies and to explore the impact of any 
positive anti-romiplostim antibodies on the PK of romiplostim. 
Study 20060195 
Study 20060195 is a multi-center randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase ½ Study to 
determine the safety and efficacy of Romiplostim in Thrombocytopenic Pediatric Subjects with Chronic 
Immune (Idiopathic) Thrombocytopenic Purpura.  
This study consisted of a screening period, a 12-week treatment period, a 4-week PK assessment period 
for responding subjects only (all responding subjects were from the romiplostim group), and an end-of-
study visit. 
Subjects between the ages of 12 months and below 18 years who had been diagnosed with ITP according 
to the ASH Guidelines at least 6 months before enrolment were eligible to screen for this study. Eligible 
subjects must have had severe thrombocytopenia, defined by a mean of 2 platelet counts ≤ 30 x 10P
9
P/L 
with no single count > 35 x 10 P
9
P/L, within 21 days of the enrolment visit. Subjects were allowed entering 
in the study while receiving concurrent corticosteroid therapy, reductions in which were allowed at any 
time during the study after a platelet count of > 50 x 10 P
9
P/L had been achieved. 
A total of 22 subjects were randomized to romiplostim or placebo (3:1); randomization was stratified by 
age as follows: 12 months to < 3 years, 3 to < 12 years, and 12 to< 18 years to allow for an equal 
distribution of subjects. Subjects initially entered a 12-week treatment period during which each subject 
received an initial dose of blinded investigational product SC at 1.0μg/kg with each subsequent weekly 
dose adjusted based on individual platelet count before dosing to produce platelet responses within the 
target range of 50 x 10 P
9
9
P/L to 250 x 10P
P/L. The maximum permitted dose of investigational product was 
10.0μg/kg. At the end of the 12-week treatment period, responding subjects (i.e. subjects achieving 
platelet count > 20 x 10 P
9
P/L above baseline for 2 consecutive weeks in the absence of rescue therapy at 
any point during the 12-week treatment period) were enrolled into a 4-week PK assessment period. 
For PK sample collection, at week 12, samples were obtained from all subjects regardless of platelet 
counts on day 1 (before investigational product dosing) and day 3. During the PK assessment period, PK 
samples were drawn weekly at pre-dose (day 1) and 2 days post-dose (day 3). 
Disposition 
Of the 22 subjects enrolled, 17 subjects were randomized to romiplostim and 5 subjects were randomized 
to placebo. 
Enrolment by age was as follows: 
• 12 months to < 3 years: 4 subjects (3 romiplostim, 1 placebo) 
• 3 years to < 12 years: 10 subjects (8 romiplostim 2 placebo) 
• 12 years to < 18 years: 8 subjects (6 romiplostim, 2 placebo) 
All 22 subjects received at least 1 dose of blinded investigational product and completed the study. Blood 
samples were collected for romiplostim concentration determination at week 12 for all subjects (N = 17 
romiplostim treated) and during the 4-week PK assessment period for responding subjects (N = 14, all 
romiplostim treated). The romiplostim dose ranged from 1 to 7μg/kg, 3 to 10μg/kg, and 1 to 10μg/kg for 
age cohorts of 12 months to< 3 years, 3 to < 12 years, and 12 to < 18 years, respectively. In total, 8 
subjects received the same dose over time for 5 weeks. A total of 136 serum PK samples (including 1 
unscheduled sample) from 22 subjects were analysed for romiplostim concentrations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/302907/2018

PK results 
The romiplostim serum concentrations were highly variable both at pre-dose and at 2 days post-dose for 
each romiplostim dose level and no apparent difference among the 3 age cohorts was observed (Figure 2 
and Figure 3). No obvious association between romiplostim dose and serum concentration was observed 
in all 3 age cohorts (Figure 3), suggesting that factors other than the dose affect the clearance of 
romiplostim. One of those factors as previously shown in adult subjects is the circulating platelet count, 
since romiplostim clearance partly is mediated by the TPO receptors on megakaryocytes and platelets. 
Therefore, higher platelet counts would result in higher romiplostim clearance and lower romiplostim 
concentration. As shown, for the oldest age cohort (12 to < 18 year), higher platelet counts were 
associated with lower romiplostim concentrations either at pre-dose or 2 days post-dose (Figure 4); 
however, this type of relationship was not as apparent for the 2 younger cohorts.

Study 20090340 
This study was an open label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of long-term dosing of romiplostim 
in thrombocytopenic pediatric subjects with immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP). This is 
a long-term extension study for paediatric subjects from Study 20030213 or Study 20080279 (pivotal).  
The primary objective of Study 20090340 was to evaluate the safety of romiplostim as a long-term 
treatment in paediatric thrombocytopenic subjects with ITP.  
The secondary objectives were to evaluate the long-term platelet response to romiplostim and possible 
reductions in the dose of concurrent ITP therapies while receiving romiplostim. Subjects enrolled in Study 
20090340 were also eligible to participate in an optional PK portion of the study, designed to evaluate the 
PK profile of romiplostim in paediatric subjects. In this PK portion, serial blood samples were collected 
from each participating individual during week 1 and week 2 of the study. 
Disposition 
As of the data cut-off date of 24 February 2016, 66 subjects entered the extension; 12 were from Study 
20030213 and 54 were from Study 20080279. A total of 65 subjects received romiplostim for median 
duration of 100 weeks (range: 5 to 321 weeks); 1 subject withdrew consent before romiplostim 
treatment. 
Four subjects had measurable serum romiplostim concentrations. Two subjects received the romiplostim 
dose at 7 μg/kg, while the other 2 received at 9 μg/kg. The PK profiles and the PK parameters for these 
subjects are presented in Figure 5 and Table 3, respectively. The exposure to romiplostim was highly 
variable. Based on the limited data, after SC administration of romiplostim, the maximum concentration 
of romiplostim was reached by 24 hours post dose.

Comparison and analyses of results across studies 
Comparison between Study 20060195 and Study 20090340: 
PK Comparison between Adult Subjects With ITP and Paediatric Subjects With ITP 
The PK profiles from paediatric subjects with ITP from Study 20090340 were compared with those from 
adult subjects with ITP from Study 20030213 in a similar dose range (Figure 7). The adult subjects 
received at least 3 weekly romiplostim doses before the PK profile was collected, whereas the paediatric 
subjects received 1 romiplostim dose before the PK profile was collected. High inter-subject variability 
was observed for both populations. Based on visual inspection, the romiplostim concentrations for 
pediatric subjects generally fell within the range observed in adult subjects with ITP. Similar to adults 
with ITP, large variability in romiplostim PK in these pediatric subjects with ITP also suggested that serum 
romiplostim concentration is not reliable in predicting the platelet responses.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
TIn  adults  with  ITP,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  romiplostim  involved  target-mediated  disposition,  which  is 
presumably mediated by TPO receptors on platelets and other cells of the thrombopoietic lineage such as 
megakaryocytes. There was a correlation between serum exposure (AUC and C RmaxR) and pre-dose platelet 
counts:  romiplostim  exposure  was  low  when  the  pre-dose  platelet  counts  were  high,  and  vice  versa. 
Romiplostim, as a protein, is expected to be cleared for a major part by proteolysis.Pharmacokinetics of 
romiplostim  in  paediatric  subjects  was  investigated  following  the  first  administration  in  subjects  4-17 
years old and by sparse data sampling following repeated dosing in patients with a platelet response aged 
1-17 years old. Similar to the pharmacokinetics of romiplostim in adults with ITP, the romiplostim serum 
concentrations  were  highly  variable  in  paediatric  patients  both  at  pre-dose  and  at  2  days  post-dose 
ranging from below the limit of quantitation (< 15 pg/mL) to 51.1 pg/mL pre-dose and up to 1710 pg/mL 
post-dose, respectively. There was no dose-exposure correlation, apparently suggesting that factors other 
than  the  dose  affect  the  clearance  of  romiplostim.  One  of  those  factors,  as  previously  shown  in  adult 
subjects, is the circulating platelets, since romiplostim clearance partly is mediated by the TPO receptors 
on  megakaryocytes  and  platelets.  Higher  platelet  counts  were  associated  with  lower  romiplostim 
concentrations  either  at  pre-dose  or  2 days  post-dose  for  the  oldest  age  cohort  (12  to  <18 year); 
however such a relationship was not as apparent for the 2 younger cohorts. There might be a trend for a 
faster  elimination  of  romiplostim  in  younger  children  and  younger  children  had  a  higher  percentage  of 
very  low  romiplostim  trough  levels.  Insufficient  data  are  available,  especially  in  the  group  <3  years  of 
age,  to  draw  conclusions  regarding  the  effect  of  age  on  pharmacokinetics.  This  has  been  reflected  in 
section 5.2 of the SmPC as follows: “Pharmacokinetic data of romiplostim were collected from two studies 
in 21 paediatric subjects with ITP. In study S5 (195), romiplostim concentrations were available from 17 
subjects at doses ranging from 1 to 10 mcg/kg. In Study S6 (340), intensive romiplostim concentrations 
were available from 4 subjects (2 at 7 mcg/kg and 2 at 9 mcg/kg). Serum concentrations of romiplostim 
in  paediatrics  with  ITP  were  within  the  range  observed  in  adult  ITP  subjects  receiving  the  same  dose 
range  of  romiplostim.  Similar  to  adults  with  ITP,  romiplostim  pharmacokinetics  are  highly  variable  in 
paediatric subjects with ITP and are not reliable and predictive. However, the data are insufficient to draw 
any  meaningful  conclusion  relating  to  the  impact  of  dose  and  age  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
romiplostim.”   
TThe starting dose 1 µg/kg and weekly dose increments with 1 µg/kg until the patient achieves a platelet 
count ≥ 50 x 10P
9
P/L, are similar in paediatric and adult subjects with ITP. At the starting dose of 1 µg/kg, 
romiplostim  serum  concentrations  were  very  low  (<15  pg/ml)  in  paediatric  patients.  Two  out  of  17 
paediatric  patients  achieved  a  stable  platelet  count  (≥ 50 x 10P

P/L  for  at  least  2 weeks  without  dose

adjustment)  with  this  starting  dose,  whereas  higher  doses  were  needed  for  the  other  patients.  The 
platelet response in paediatric subjects with ITP is in line with that of adult subjects with ITP supporting 
that the same dosing algorithm as for adults can be applied. These dosing recommendations have been 
applied in the pivotal paediatric phase 3 Study 20080279.  
TIn addition, there are no data in the literature to support that there are any differences in equilibrium of 
platelet production/destruction in paediatric ITP patients compared with adult ITP patients. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
TThe  limited  pharmacokinetic  data  in  paediatric  patients  with  ITP  1-17  years  of  age  preclude  conclusions 
with  regards  to  the  effect  of  age  on  pharmacokinetics  of  romiplostim.  Similar  to  adults  with  ITP, 
romiplostim pharmacokinetics are highly variable in paediatric subjects with ITP and are not reliable and 
predictive, this is considered acceptable as the dose for an individual patient is calculated based on body 
weight, dose required, and concentration of product as reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC.

Baseline subject demographics were balanced across the treatment groups. Mean (standard deviation 
[SD]) age was 9.5 (5.1) years, reflective of most subjects being enrolled into the > 11- to 17-years-old 
age group. Most subjects (72.7%) were boys, and most (59.1%) were white. Mean (SD) weight was 45.1 
(28.5) kg, and mean (SD) BMI was 22.2 (7.4) kg/m2 
The mean (SD) baseline platelet count for the romiplostim group was similar to that for the placebo group 
(13.5 [6.3] x 10 P

(range) time since ITP diagnosis was 2.4 (0.8 to 14.0) years in the romiplostim group and 4.1 (0.6 to 
8.6) years in the placebo group. 
Six subjects (35.3%) in the romiplostim group and 2 subjects (40.0%) in the placebo group had 
previously undergone splenectomy; median (range) time since splenectomy was 5.4 (0.4 to 12.0) years 
for the romiplostim group and 3.6 (0.4 to 6.7) years for the placebo group. Sixteen romiplostim-treated 
subjects (94.1%) and 5 placebo-treated subjects (100%) had received prior ITP treatments with a 
median (range) number of prior ITP treatments of 5 (0 to 9) for the romiplostim group and 3 (2 to 8 for 
the placebo group. 
Outcomes and estimation 
22 subjects were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to receive romiplostim (n = 17) or placebo (n = 5). Doses 
9
were increased in increments of 2 mcg/kg every 2 weeks and the target platelet count was ≥ 50 x 10P
P/L. 
Treatment with romiplostim resulted in statistically significantly greater incidence of platelet response 
compared with placebo (p = 0.0008). Of those 22 subjects, 17 subjects had ITP > 12 months of duration 
(14 subjects received romiplostim and 3 subjects received placebo). Treatment with romiplostim resulted 
in statistically significantly greater incidence of platelet response compared with placebo (p = 0.0147). 
-Immunogenicity Assessment 
One of the 17 subjects from the romiplostim-dosed group tested positive for binding antibodies to the 
TMP component of romiplostim at week 13 post-dose. No baseline sample was available for this subject. 
The subject was negative for neutralising antibodies to romiplostim in the bioassay. The sample drawn 
from the end-of-study time point from this subject was negative for binding antibodies to romiplostim and 
TMP, indicating a transient antibody response. No subject was positive for binding antibodies to TPO. 
-Subjects Achieving a Platelet Count ≥ 50 x 10P
9
P/L for 2 consecutive weeks during the 12-week treatment 
period 
Of the 17 subjects who received romiplostim, 15 achieved a platelet count ≥ 50 x 10P
9
P/L for 2 consecutive 
weeks (after excluding platelet counts within 4 weeks following rescue medication use) during the 
treatment period (88.2%, 95% CI: 63.6%, 98.5%). None of the subjects treated with placebo achieved 
either endpoint. Treatment with romiplostim resulted in statistically significantly greater incidence of 
platelet response compared to placebo (p = 0.0008). 
Of these 15 subjects, 3 subjects (3/3, 100.0%, exact 97.5% CI: 29.2%, 100.0%) were in the 12-month- 
to < 3-years-old age group, 7 subjects (7/8,87.5%, 95% CI: 47.3%, 99.7%) were in the 3- to < 12-
years-old age group and 5 subjects (5/6, 83.3%, 95% CI: 35.9%, 99.6%) were in the 12- to < 18-years-
old age group. 
When platelet response for 4 weeks following any administration of rescue medications was included, 
similar results were observed for the romiplostim group and 1 of the 5 subjects in the placebo group 
(20.0%, 95% CI: 0.5%, 71.6%) met this endpoint.

-Subjects achieving an increase in platelet count > 20 x 10P

during the 12-week treatment period  
The same 15 subjects also achieved an increase in platelet count ≥ 20 x 10 P
9
P/L above baseline for 2 
consecutive weeks (after excluding platelet counts within 4 weeks following rescue medication use) 
during the treatment period (88.2%, 95% CI: 63.6%, 98.5%). Two of the 5 subjects (40.0%) in the 
placebo group (1 in the 12-months- to < 3-years-old age group, 1 in the 12- to < 18-years-old age 
group) received rescue medication during the treatment period (2 subjects received immunoglobulins and 
1 subject received prednisone). 
-Subjects requiring rescue therapy during the 12-week treatment period 
Two of 17 subjects (11.8%) in the romiplostim group (both in the 3- to < 12-years-old age group) 
received rescue medication during the treatment period (1 subject received dexamethasone, 1 subject 
received immunoglobulins). 
-Total number of bleeding events (Clinical Grade ≥ 2) for each subject during weeks 2 to 13 
Bleeding was the only event of interest observed in this study. During the treatment period, 12 subjects 
(70.6%) in the romiplostim group and 2 subjects (40.0%) in the placebo group had bleeding adverse 
events of any grade. These results should be interpreted with caution given the limited subject numbers 
per group. Events with incidence > 1 subject were (romiplostim, placebo) epistaxis (6 subjects [35.3%], 
1 subject [20.0%]), contusion (3 subjects [17.6%], 1 subject [20.0%]), and petechiae (2 subjects 
[11.8%], 1 subject [20.0%]). Most bleeding adverse events were of CTCAE grade 1 (mild). Twelve 
(70.6%) romiplostim-treated subjects had events of grade 1; 1 subject in the romiplostim group (5.9%) 
had bleeding adverse events that were grade 2 (subject: epistaxis, contusion, petechiae). The 2 (40.0%) 
placebo-treated subjects had events of worst grade 1. 
No bleeding adverse events were considered to be serious or treatment related and the majority of the 
bleeding adverse events for the romiplostim-treated subjects (i.e. those for 10 of the 12 subjects who 
had an event) occurred in the first 6 weeks of the treatment period. 
When adjusted for exposure duration, the rate of bleeding was 7.3 events per 100 subject-weeks in the 
romiplostim arm and 11.9 events per 100 subject-weeks in the placebo arm. For the placebo group, all 
bleeding events occurred when the platelet count was < 30 x10P
9
P/L. For the romiplostim group, the 
majority of the bleeding adverse events occurred in the first 6 weeks of the treatment period and most 
events (14 of 17) correlated to a platelet count < 30 x10 P

P/L. As most occurred in the first 6 weeks of treatment, these events were observed before the 
maximum dose allowed on study (10 μg/kg) was reached. The mean (SD) number of bleeding events

(clinical grade ≥ 2) was 0.4 (1.0) for the romiplostim group and 0.0 (0.0) for the placebo groups, with a 
median (range) number of bleeding events of 0.0 (0, 4) for the romiplostim group and 0.0 (0, 0) for the 
placebo group. One romiplostim-treated subject and no placebo-treated subjects experienced bleeding 
events of clinical grade > 2 severity. Subject, a 16-year-old girl, had a moderate (clinical grade 3;

Treatments 
Investigational product (romiplostim; placebo) was administered weekly, over a 24-week treatment 
period, in the clinic by a qualified healthcare provider as a subcutaneous injection. The starting dose of 
romiplostim was 1 μg/kg; weekly dose increases continued in increments of 1 μg/kg/week to a maximum 
dose of 10 μg/kg in an attempt to reach a target platelet count of >50 x 10P
9
P/L.  
At any time during the 24-week treatment period, if a subject demonstrated the onset of a sustained 
platelet response (defined as a continuous platelet count of ≥  50 x 10P
P/L in the absence of romiplostim 
9
and all other therapies dosed with the intent to treat ITP) the subject was monitored for a period of up to 
6 months beginning with the first platelet count ≥  50 x 10P
P/L. If a subject experienced the onset of a 
9
sustained platelet response at the End of Study (EOS) visit they continued platelet count monitoring for 6 
months beginning with the first count ≥  50 x 10P

the subject completed the End of Follow-up visit (EOF) which represented the completion of study 
participation. A subject who completed the EOF visit was immediately eligible to screen for entry into the 
romiplostim pediatric open-label extension study (Study 20090340). 
At pre-defined time points during the course of the study an independent DMC monitored the ongoing 
safety. The first DMC was to occur when 10 subjects were enrolled for at least 4 weeks and continued to 
meet approximately every 6 months as long as there were active subjects on study. 
Subjects who weigh < 50 kg may require a decreased concentration of IP to ensure accurate dosing. In 
such situations, dilution of IP in a 1:2 ratio (a protein concentration of 0.25 mg/mL) or a 1:4 ratio (a 
protein concentration of 0.125) may be made with 0.9%saline to ensure an appropriate dispensable 
volume is delivered. Dosing was to be stopped at any time during the study if neutralizing antibodies to 
romiplostim or to eTPO were detected.

Objectives 
UPrimary Objective: 
 
To evaluate the efficacy of romiplostim in the treatment of thrombocytopenia in paediatric 
subjects with ITP as measured by durable platelet response. USecondary Objectives: 
 
To evaluate overall and weekly platelet response (≥ 50 × 10 P
9
P/L during weeks 2 through 25 of the 
treatment period). To evaluate the use of rescue ITP medications;  
 
To evaluate a combined bleeding event and rescue medication use endpoint (composite bleeding 
episodes).  
 
To evaluate the overall safety of romiplostim. 
UExploratory Objectives:U   
 
To evaluate the discontinuation of ITP medications; the incidence of sustained platelet response; 
the incidence of splenectomy; the incidence of haematuria and any association with intracranial 
haemorrhage events; changes in Patient-reported Outcomes (PRO) due to treatment with 
romiplostim and to estimate the minimal important difference (MID) of the Kids ITP Tool (KIT). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
UPrimary Endpoint: 
 
The primary endpoint is the incidence of durable platelet response. A subject with durable platelet 
response is defined as achieving at least 6 weekly platelet counts of ≥  50 x 10P
P/L during weeks 
9
18 through 25 of treatment. 
USecondary Endpoints: 
  Subject incidence of overall platelet response. Overall responders are defined as subjects who 
achieve a platelet count ≥  50 x 10P
9
P/L at a minimum of 4 times during weeks 2 to 25 of the 
treatment period.  
  Number of weekly platelet counts ≥  50 x 10P
9
P/L during weeks 2 to 25 of the treatment period. 
  Subject incidence of rescue ITP medications used 
 
The number of composite bleeding episodes. The composite bleeding episode is defined as 
clinically significant bleeding events or the use of a rescue medication to prevent a clinically 
significant bleeding event during weeks 2 to 25 of the treatment period. A clinically significant 
event is defined as a grade ≥ 2 per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 3.0 grading scale.  
 
Incidence of adverse events, including thromboembolic events and hematologic malignancies, 
clinically significant changes in laboratory values and the incidence of antibody formation

Sample size 
60 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive IP (40 romiplostim vs. 20 placebo).  
The sample size of 60 subjects with a 2:1 randomization ratio (40 romiplostim, 20 placebo) was chosen 
to provide adequate power to demonstrate that the efficacy, measured by the durable platelet response, 
of romiplostim is significantly better than placebo. The probability of achieving durable platelet response 
with romiplostim and placebo is estimated at 60% and 5%, respectively. The sample size will have 
approximately 99% power to detect the difference in the incidence of durable platelet response between 
romiplostim and placebo using a 2-sided Mantel-Haenszel test at a significance level of 0.05. 
Randomisation 
2:1 randomization ratio (40 romiplostim, 20 placebo).  
Subjects were stratified into 1 of 3 age categories:  
· 
· 
· 
≥  1 - < 6 years (8 subjects [19%] romiplostim; 4 subjects [20%] placebo); 
≥  6 - < 12 years (18 subjects [43%] romiplostim; 9 subjects [45%] placebo); and 
≥  12 - < 18 years (16 subjects [38%] romiplostim; 7 subjects [35%] placebo). 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was a double blinded study. 
Statistical methods 
The incidences of durable and overall platelet responses were compared by the Mantel-Haenszel test 
stratified by the baseline age group. Exact 95% confidence intervals for the incidence were provided for 
each treatment group and for the difference between treatment groups. The common odds ratios were 
estimated along with its 95% confidence interval.  
The number of weeks with a platelet response for both treatment groups were summarised and compared 
by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with treatment and age category in the model. To mitigate 
violation of the model assumptions, Mantel-Haenszel test (row mean score differ) will be performed as a 
secondary analysis to ensure the robustness of the result. 
The number of composite bleeding episodes were summarised and compared by the Mantel-Haenszel test 
(row mean score differ) stratified by the baseline age group. 
A sequential testing scheme will be employed as follows to adjust for multiplicity for the primary and key 
secondary endpoints in comparing romiplostim vs. placebo. 
• Test incidence of durable platelet response, if significant and in the positive direction of romiplostim 
then 
• Test incidence of overall platelet response, if significant and in the positive direction of romiplostim then 
• Test number of weeks with platelet response, if significant and in the positive direction of romiplostim 
then 
• Test the subject incidence of rescue ITP medications used, if significant and in the positive direction of 
romiplostim then

Outcomes and estimation 
UPrimary endpoint: Incidence of durable platelet response 
In the Efficacy Analysis Set, a total of 22 subjects (52%) had durable platelet responses in the 
romiplostim arm compared with 2 subjects (10%) in the placebo arm. The Mantel-Haenszel common odds 
ratio for achieving durable platelet response was estimated to be 9.1 (romiplostim vs placebo, 95% CI: 
1.9, 43.2). 
Within each baseline age group, a higher percentage of subjects in the romiplostim arm had durable 
platelet responses compared with subjects in the placebo arm: ≥ 1 to< 6 years 38% vs 25%; 6 to < 12 
years 56% vs 11%; 12 to < 18 years 56% vs 0. 
Assessment report  
EMA/302907/2018

A sensitivity analysis using the LOCF for missing platelet count resulted in similar p-values.  
In the subset of subjects with ITP > 12 months of duration, the incidence of durable response was also 
significantly greater in the romiplostim arm compared with the placebo arm (p = 0.0022). A total of 17 
subjects (53.1%) had durable platelet response in the romiplostim arm compared with 1 subject (6.3%) 
in the placebo arm: ≥  1 to < 6 years 28.6% versus 25%; ≥  6 to < 12 years 63.6% versus 0%; ≥  12 to 
< 18 years 57.1% versus 0%. 
The composite bleeding episode was defined as clinically significant bleeding events or the use of a rescue 
medication to prevent a clinical significant bleeding event during weeks 2 through 25 of the treatment 
period. A clinically significant bleeding event was defined as a Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 grade ≥  2 bleeding event. The mean (SD) number of composite bleeding 
episodes was 1.9 (4.2) for the romiplostim arm and 4.0 (6.9) for the placebo arm with a median (Q1, Q3) 
number of bleeding events of 0.0 (0, 2) for the romiplostim arm and 0.5 (0, 4.5) in the placebo arm. In 
the subset of subjects with ITP > 12 months of duration, the mean (SD) number of composite bleeding

episodes was 2.1 (4.7) for the romiplostim arm and 4.2 (7.5) for the placebo arm with a median (Q1, Q3) 
number of bleeding events of 0.0 (0, 2) for the romiplostim arm and 0.0 (0, 4) in the placebo arm. 
Because the statistical testing for the incidence of rescue medication use was not significant, no statistical 
test was done for the number of composite bleeding episodes endpoint. 
USecondary endpoints 
-Subject incidence of overall platelet response 
Overall platelet response is defined as either a durable platelet response or transient platelet response. A 
transient platelet response was defined as weekly platelet count ≥ 50 x 10P
9
P/L for 4 or more times during 
weeks 2 through 25 measurements, but without durable platelet response. In the Efficacy Analysis Set, a 
total of 30 subjects (71%) had an overall platelet response in the romiplostim arm compared with 4 
subjects (20%) in the placebo arm. The Mantel-Haenszel common odds ratio of romiplostim vs. placebo 
was estimated to be9.0 (95% CI: 2.5, 32.3). 
Within each baseline age group, a higher percentage of subjects in the romiplostim arm had an overall 
platelet response compared with subjects in the placebo arm: ≥ 1 to< 6 years 63% vs 50%; 6 to < 12 
years 83% vs 11%; 12 to < 18 years 63% vs 14%,respectively. 
- Number of weekly platelet counts ≥ 50 x 10P
9
P/L during weeks 2 to 25 of the treatment period 
The primary statistical test, analysis of variance for treatment difference, resulted in a significant p-value 
(p = 0.0004) in favor of romiplostim treatment and the secondary statistical test, Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel controlling for baseline age group also resulted in a significant p-value (p = 0.0001) (Table 7).

Table 7: Number of weeks with platelet response (efficacy analysis set) 
-Subject incidence of rescue ITP medications used  
In the Efficacy Analysis Set, 17 of 42 subjects (41%) in the romiplostim arm and 9 of 20 subjects (45%) 
in the placebo arm received rescue medication during the treatment period. The Mantel-Haenszel 
common odds ratio of romiplostim vs. placebo was estimated to be 0.8 (95% CI: 0.3, 2.4). 
In the baseline age group of 1 to < 6 years, 4 of 8 subjects in the romiplostim arm used rescue 
medication compared with 1 of 4 subjects in the placebo arm (50% vs 25%); however, subjects in the 
baseline age groups of 6 to < 12 years and 12 to < 18 years used more rescue medications in the 
placebo arm than in the romiplostim arm (romiplostim vs. placebo; 28% vs 44% and 50% vs 57%, 
respectively). The primary statistical test, Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by age group, did not result in a 
significant p-value (p = 0.710). The secondary statistical test, exact test stratified by age group, also did 
not result in a significant p-value (p = 0.9160).

-Total number of composite bleeding episodes in the 24-week treatment period 
In the Efficacy Analysis Set, the mean (SD) number of composite bleeding events (clinical grade ≥ 2) was 
1.9 (4.2) for the romiplostim arm and 4.0 (6.9) for the placebo arm with a median (Q1,Q3) number of 
bleeding events of 0.0 (0, 2) for the romiplostim arm and 0.5 (0, 4.5) in the placebo arm. Because the 
statistical testing for the incidence of rescue medication use was not significant, no statistical test was 
done for the number of composite bleeding episodes endpoint according to the pre-specified sequential 
testing scheme for multiplicity adjustment. The overall duration-adjusted rate per100 subject-years was 
80 (8.1) in the romiplostim arm and 79 (18.4) in the placebo arm (p = <0.0001, ad hoc). 
The subject incidence of bleeding treatment-emergent adverse events was 35 subjects (83%) in the 
romiplostim arm and 14 subjects (74%) in the placebo arm. The most frequently reported (≥ 10%) 
bleeding adverse events were (romiplostim; placebo) epistaxis (20 subjects [48%]; 10 subjects [53%]), 
contusion (19 subjects [45%];7 subjects [37%]), petechiae (11 subjects [26%]; 6 subjects [32%]); 
mouth hemorrhage(11 subjects [26%]; 4 subjects [21%]), and gingival bleeding (8 subjects [19%];4 
subjects [21%]) (Table 14-6.2.1.25). 
Serious adverse events were experienced by 4 subjects in the romiplostim arm; they were epistaxis (2 
subjects) and petechiae and contusion (1 subject, each). Two subjects in the placebo arm had serious 
bleeding adverse events; they were animal bite (1 subject) and hematuria (1 subject). An additional 
subject in the romiplostim arm had 2 serious adverse events at screening (gingival bleeding and 
contusion). No subject discontinued romiplostim because of a bleeding adverse event. A summary of the 
serious bleeding events and associated platelet counts are provided below (Table 12-6).

UExploratory endpoints: 
-Proportion of subjects who reduced or discontinued concurrent ITP therapies 
-Incidence of sustained platelet response  
This was defined as every platelet count ≥ 50 × 10 P
9
P/L for at least 6 months in the absence of the 
investigational product and all other therapies dosed with the intent-to-treat ITP). No subjects in either 
treatment arm achieved a sustained platelet response. 
-Incidence of splenectomy  
No subjects in either treatment arm were splenectomised during the 24-week treatment period. Two 
subjects, 1 in each treatment arm, were splenectomised before enrolment into this study. 
-Change in subjects’ quality of life through PRO 
Improvement in health-related quality of life as measured in KIT scores (child self-report score, parent-
proxy score, and parent impact score) from baseline to the EOS was numerically greater in the 
romiplostim treatment arm compared with the placebo treatment arm, but the differences were not 
statistically significant in the descriptive analysis. In the mixed-effects analysis, statistically significant 
improvement in the romiplostim treatment arm compared with the placebo arm was found for parent 
impact score, but not for the child self-report score.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
An integrated efficacy analysis evaluated the platelet response to romiplostim, bleeding and rescue 
medication usage rate, the rate of composite bleeding episodes and the use of concurrent ITP therapies 
while receiving romiplostim. The paediatric ITP efficacy set was used to summarise efficacy endpoints,

and consists of all paediatric subjects who received at least one dose of romiplostim in an ITP study 
(20060195, 20080279, 20030213, 20090340 or 20101221). For subjects who received placebo in a 
parent study and romiplostim in an extension study, only data from the extension study were included. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics of subjects in the integrated analysis are described in the safety 
section of this AR.  
Platelet count data since the first dose of romiplostim were included in the integrated analysis. To 
discount the possible effect associated with rescue medications, platelet counts measured within 4 weeks 
following use of rescue medication or any time after an on-study splenectomy were deemed as non-
evaluable. 
-Incidence of Platelet Response 
A total of 188 of 224 subjects (83.9%; 95% CI: 78.5%, 88.5%) had a platelet response, defined as at 
least 1 platelet count ≥ 50 x 10 P
9
P/L without any use of rescue medication within 4 weeks prior to date of 
the platelet measurement. Of which a total of 187 of 224 subjects (83.5%; 95% CI: 78.0%, 88.1%) had 
at least 1 platelet count between 50 x 10P
9
P/L and 200 x 10P
9
P/L, without any use of rescue medication within 
4 weeks prior to date of the platelet measurement. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the time to first platelet 
response (50P
th
P percentile) was 6.0 weeks (95% CI: 5.0, 7.0). 
Table 9 Time to First Platelet Response (Paediatric ITP Efficacy Set) 
-Average Weekly Platelet Count Over Time 
The mean (SD) platelet count was 19.7 (29.8) x 10 P
9
P/L at week 1 and increased to 47.7 (89.1) x 10 P
9
P/L at 
week 2. At week 6, the mean (SD) platelet count was above the platelet response threshold of ≥ 50 x

P/L from week 6 to week 428 (excluding week 392). 
-Sustained Platelet Response 
A total of 129 of 224 subjects (57.6%; 95% CI: 50.8%, 64.1%) had sustained platelet response, defined 
as at least 9 weeks with platelet response within a 12-week period. The KM estimate of the time to first 
sustained platelet response (50th percentile) was 20.0 weeks (95% CI: 15.0, 26.0) (time to first

sustained platelet response was defined as the time from initiation of romiplostim to the start of the 12-
week period in which a sustained response was seen). 
Table 10: Time to First Sustained Platelet Response (Paediatric ITP Efficacy Set) 
Platelet Response Over Time 
A Month with platelet response was defined as the median (platelet counts measured in the study month) 
≥ 50 x 10P
9
P/L. Platelet counts measured within 4 weeks following a rescue medication use or any time 
after an on-study splenectomy were excluded in this definition. If > 50% of platelet counts within the 
month were excluded due to rescue medication use then the month was considered as no platelet 
response regardless of the median value of any platelet counts not excluded for rescue medication. 
Months without any platelet count measurement were imputed as platelet response if no rescue 
medication was taken and closest months with platelet counts before and after both showed response. 
Otherwise, they were imputed as no platelet response.  
Based on the evaluation of platelet response by month, the subject incidence of platelet response showed 
a trend toward increasing over time. The incidence was 25.7% (95% CI: 20.1%, 31.9%) at month 1, 
42.5% (95% CI: 35.7%, 49.4%) at month 2, ranged from 58.0% (95% CI: 50.8%, 64.9%) to 65.6% 
(95% CI: 58.4%, 72.3%) from month 3 to month 6, and was > 70.0% (range 70.7% to 100.0%) from 
month 7 through month 111.

P/L increased 
from 25.7% (95% CI: 20.1%, 31.9%) at month 1 to > 50% at month 3 and remained ≥ 50% (range 
50.0% to 100.0%) from month 3 through month 111. 
The median (range) number of months with platelet response ( ≥ 50 x 10 P
9
P/L) was 5.0 months (0,109). 
The median (range) percentage of months with platelet response was 69.14% (0, 100%).The median 
(range) number of months with platelet counts between 50 x 10 P

-Maximum Number of Consecutive Months With Platelet Response Without Concomitant Medications 
The median (range) maximum number of consecutive months with platelet response without any 
romiplostim or concomitant medication use was 0 months (0, 5). The median (range) maximum number 
of consecutive months with platelet response without any concomitant ITP medications use other than 
romiplostim was 4.0 months (0, 108).

-Bleeding Events 
Only treatment-emergent bleeding events were included. Overall, the subject incidence of at least one 
bleeding event was 63.8% (143 of 224 subjects) at any time during treatment (Table 11). 
Table 11 Subject Incidence of Bleeding Events by Grade and Time Period (Paediatric ITP Efficacy Set) 
Bleeding Episodes 
A bleeding episode was defined as a group of treatment-emergent bleeding adverse events with overlap 
or partial overlap so that there was at least 1 bleeding-free day between episodes. The duration-adjusted 
event rate for all bleeding episodes (per 100 subject-years) at any time during treatment was 874.2.  A 
trend towards a reduction in the duration-adjusted event rate over time was observed for grade 2 or 
above and grade 3 or above bleeding events; there were no grade 4 or above or grade 5 or above 
bleeding events.

Composite Bleeding Episodes 
A composite bleeding episode was defined as a group of clinically significant (CTCAE grade ≥ 2) 
treatment-emergent bleeding events or the use of a rescue medication with overlap or partial overlap so 
that there was at least one bleeding-free day between episodes. The incidence of subjects with at least 
one composite bleeding episode at any time during treatment was 37.9%, which corresponded to a 
duration-adjusted rate of composite bleeding episodes (per 100 subject-years) at any time of 317.3. The 
incidence and duration-adjusted rate of composite bleeding episodes showed a trend towards reduction 
over time. The incidence of composite bleeding episodes decreased from 28.6% during month 1 to 6 to 
12.5% with during year 4. There were no composite bleeding episodes recorded in year 5 through year 9. 
Concomitant and Rescue Medication Use 
The subject prevalence of concurrent ITP therapy use was 39.7% (89 of 224 subjects) at any time during 
treatment, and there was a trend towards a reduction in concomitant medication use over time. The 
prevalence of concurrent ITP therapy use was 33.0% from months 1 to 6, 22.9% from months 7 to 12, 
23.8% in year 2, 20.5% in year 3, 8.3% in year 4, and 0% from year 5 through year 9 (with the 
exception of use of concomitant medications reported in 1 subject [12.5%] in year 7). 
The subject incidence of rescue medication use was 32.6% (73 of 224 subjects) at any time during 
treatment, and there was a trend towards a reduction in rescue medication use over time. The incidence 
of rescue medication use was 26.3% from months 1 to 6, 15.3% from months 7 to 12, 17.5% in year 2, 
13.6% in year 3, and 4.2% in year 4. There was no reported rescue medication use in years 5 through 9. 
Subgroup analysis 
The integrated analyses for efficacy included evaluation of selected efficacy variables by the following 
subgroups: Age at baseline (≥ 1 to < 6 years, ≥ 6 to < 12 years, ≥ 12 to < 18 years), Sex, Race 
(Whites, Blacks, Other), Geographic Region, Years since ITP diagnosis (≤ 1, > 1), baseline bleeding 
status (Yes, No), Prior splenectomy, Number of prior ITP treatments.  
• 
Time to First Platelet Response: The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the time to first response was 
generally similar across the subgroup comparisons. For all subgroups analysed, the Kaplan-Meier 
estimate of the time to first response (50th percentile) ranged from 5.0 weeks to 8.5 weeks 
• 
Time to First Sustained Platelet Response: Differences are found with respect to the subgroup 
analysis of the time to first sustained platelet response (Table 13).

TStudy 20030213 
TThis was a multicenter, open-label, extension study evaluating the safety and efficacy of long-term dosing 
of  romiplostim  in  thrombocytopenic  subjects  with  ITP.  Subjects  who  completed  a  romiplostim  ITP  study 
(Study 20060195) were eligible to screen for inclusion in this study. Both adult (n = 292) and paediatric 
(n = 21) subjects were enrolled.  
TRomiplostim was administered SC once weekly. Dosing started either at the same dose being received at 
the end of treatment in the previous study or at a dose of 1 μg/kg (for subjects who had received placebo 
in a previous study). Subjects for whom the dose of romiplostim was stable (for at least 3 weeks) were 
allowed to self-administer romiplostim  away  from  the study  centre  and returned to the  study  centre  for 
ongoing  evaluation  at  designated  study  visits.  Dose  adjustment  was  allowed  throughout  the  studies

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Results from Studies 20060195 (n = 22) and 20080279 (n = 62) provide efficacy data reflecting the 
claimed indication (second-line treatment of chronic ITP in paediatric patients 1 year of age and older 
who are refractory to other treatments (e.g., corticosteroids, immunoglobulins). Both studies were 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies and enrolled paediatric subjects (≥ 1 year to < 18 
years of age) with thrombocytopenia (defined by a mean of 2 platelet counts ≤ 30 x 10P
9
P/L with neither 
count > 35 x 10 P
9
P/L in both studies) with ITP, regardless of splenectomy status. Platelet study entry 
criteria were according to the CHMP ITP guideline (EMA/CHMP/153191/2013, dated February 2014). 
Romiplostim was administered weekly by SC injection in both studies using a starting dose of 1 μg/kg. 
Individual dose adjustments were employed based on platelet counts to a maximum permitted dose of 10 
μg/kg. The target platelet count was ≥ 50 x 10P

P/L in both studies. 
Study 20060195 
The design and conduct of this study was considered appropriate. 
Study 20080279 
The  CHMP  guidance  “Guideline  on  the  clinical  development  of  medicinal  products  intended  for  the 
treatment  of  chronic  primary  immune  thrombocytopenia”  (EMA/CHMP/153191/2013,  dated  February 
2014) came into effect after the development of the EU PIP and the start of the pivotal Study 20080279. 
In general, the pivotal Study 20080279 protocol meets the recommendations of the CHMP guidance with 
some exceptions; patients were not screened for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) prior to entering the study, 
although  patients  with  a  true/clinically  significant  positive  ANA  were  excluded  during  screening. 
Additionally, the inclusion criteria allowed patients with ITP lasting > 6 months since diagnosis to enroll, 
since this was defined as chronic ITP at the time of study design (ASH guideline 2011). According to the 
International Working Group Report and the CHMP guideline the term “chronic ITP” is to be reserved for 
patients with ITP lasting for more than 12 months (Rodegheiro et al, 2009). Therefore a proportion of the 
study  subjects  do  not  meet  the  criteria  of  chronic  disease.  The  MAH  has  clarified  that  Study  20060195 
protocol  was  written  before  the  IWG  recommendations  on  the  definition  of  chronic  ITP  were  published 
(Rodegheiro  et  al,  2009)  and  this  study  was  the  parent  study  for  several  other  studies  (subjects  from 
Study  20060195  rolled  over  into  Study  20030213  and  subjects  from  Study  20030213  and  Study 
20080279  rolled  over  into  Study  20090340).  Therefore,  the  inclusion  criteria  were  maintained  between 
these protocols for consistency. A total of 69 of 282 (24.4%) subjects who received at least one dose of 
romiplostim  were  6  months  to  12  months  since  ITP  diagnosis  at  the  date  of  their  first  dose  of 
romiplostim. Of them, 7  met the criteria for remission (at least 24 weeks with platelet response and no 
ITP treatment including romiplostim). Information on the actual number of patients with ITP <12 months 
from  diagnosis,  including  efficacy  and  safety  results  from  this  population  have  been  provided  as 
requested. The data showed that subjects with ITP of 6 to 12 months duration experienced long periods 
of  remission  or  treatment  free  periods.  Since  based  on  current  clinical  practice  guidelines  only  patients 
with  >12  months  since  diagnosis  will  be  treated,  the  most  relevant  efficacy  results  for  this  subset  of 
patients are reflected in Section 5.1 of the SmPC in addition to the total study results as this is deemed 
relevant information for prescribers.  
In  addition,  the  age  limit  of  1  year  is  accepted  since  a  waiver  for  children  under  1  year  of  age  is 
applicable.

Results from the uncontrolled studies 20030213 (n = 21), 20090340 (n = 66), and 20101221 (n = 147) 
provided  long-term  efficacy  data  with  a  median  (range)  duration  of  treatment  of  89  weeks  (6,  109 
weeks) in Study 20030213, 100 weeks (5, 321 weeks) in Study 20090340 (as of 24 February 2016) and 
25.0 weeks (1, 67 weeks) in Study 20101221 (data cutoff 15 March 2016). Subjects in Study 20030213 
were  enrolled  from  Study  20060195,  and  subjects  in  Study  20090340  were  enrolled  from  Studies 
20030213 and 20080279. 
A  post  hoc  integrated  efficacy  analysis  was  conducted  to  evaluate  the  platelet  response  to  romiplostim, 
bleeding  and  rescue  medication  usage  rate,  the  rate  of  composite  bleeding  episodes  and  the  use  of 
concurrent  ITP  therapies  while  receiving  romiplostim.  For  the  integrated  analyses,  the  Paediatric  ITP 
Efficacy  Set  consisted  of  all  paediatric  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  romiplostim  in  an  ITP 
study 20060195, 20080279, 20030213, 20090340 or 20101221. For subjects who received placebo in a 
parent study and romiplostim in an extension study, only data from the extension study were included.  
Subjects  for  whom  the  dose  of  romiplostim  was  stable  (for  at  least  3  weeks  in  Study  20030213  and  4 
weeks  in  Studies  20090340  and  20101221)  were  allowed  to  self-administer  romiplostim  (or  be 
administered  by  a  caregiver)  away  from  the  study  center  and  returned  to  the  study  center  for  ongoing 
evaluation at designated study visits. 
RESULTS 
 
Pivotal Study 20080279 
In  general  baseline  demographics  were  well  balanced  between  treatment  arms  and  of  which  most 
received > 2 prior treatments, no treatment naïve patients were included and 1 patient in either arm has 
been splenectomised. Baseline platelet counts were slightly lower in the romiplostim group as compared 
to the placebo patients (19.9 x 109/L for placebo and 17.5 x 109/L for romiplostim), this was mainly due 
to a higher number of subjects in the lower quartile of platelets counts. In the romiplostim group, 76.2% 
of patients had a bleeding event (of unknown grade) in the 30 days prior to the first IMP versus 73,7% in 
the placebo group; this together with the low platelet counts indicates the need for a treatment in these 
patients. 
The  primary  endpoint  of  the  pivotal  study  is  durable  platelet  response,  as  a  primary  endpoint  this  is 
acceptable  as  the  platelet  blood  count  is  generally  used  as  a  valid  surrogate  endpoint  in  ITP  since  it 
measures  treatment  activity  and  is  believed  to  be  a  reliable  predictor  of  clinical  benefit.  Romiplostim  is 
intended  for  long  term  treatment  as  such  the  durability  of  the  response  is  of  interest.  The  primary 
objective  of  durable  platelet  response  was  statistically  significant  (p  =  0.0018),  a  total  of  52%  (22 
subjects)  had  a  durable  platelet  response  in  the  romiplostim  arm  compared  to  10%  (2  subjects)  in  the 
placebo arm, this was also reflected in the separate age groups (≥ 1 to< 6 years 38% vs 25%; 6 to < 12 
years 56% vs 11%; 12 to < 18 years 56% vs 0), differences among groups are likely due to low subjects 
numbers per group. The Mantel-Haenszel common odds ratio for achieving durable platelet response was 
estimated to be 9.1 (romiplostim vs placebo, 95% CI: 1.9, 43.2). 
Efficacy  was  supported  in  the  secondary  and  supportive  endpoints  of  overall  platelet  response  (p  = 
0.0002); 30 subjects (71%) in the romiplostim arm compared with 4 of 20 subjects (20%) in the placebo 
arm;  as  well  as  the  number  of  weeks  with  platelet  response  (p  =  0.0004);  the  median  (minimum; 
maximum) 12 weeks (0; 24) in the romiplostim arm and 1 week (0; 22) in the placebo arm. Subjects ≥ 1 
to  <  6  years  had  a  lower  rate  of  durable  platelet  response  with  romiplostim  (38%)  than  the  older  age 
groups (56% [≥ 6 to < 12 years] and 56% [≥ 12 to < 18 years], respectively. The subject incidence of 
rescue  medication  use,  a  secondary  objective,  was  not  statistically  significant  different  between  placebo 
and  romiplostim  (p  =  0.7103),  even  though  platelet  counts  were  low  (romiplostim  group  41%  and 
placebo  45%).  Therefore,  the  total  number  of  composite  bleeding  episodes  (defined  as  clinically 
significant  bleeding  events  or  the  use  of  a  rescue  medication  to  prevent  a  clinical  significant  bleeding

event  during  weeks  2  through  25)  was  not  tested  according  to  the  sequential  testing  procedure.  The 
mean (SD) number of composite bleeding episodes (clinical grade ≥ 2) was 1.9 (4.2) for the romiplostim 
arm and 4.0 (6.9) for the placebo arm. The overall duration-adjusted rate per 100 subject-years was 8.1 
in  the  romiplostim  arm  and  18.4 in  the  placebo  arm  (p  =  <  0.0001,  ad  hoc). The  incidence  of  bleeding 
events  adjusted  by  exposure  and  the  timing  where  these  events  occurred  in  relation  to  the  start  of 
treatment  have  been  provided.  The  graphical  presentations  of  platelet  count  by  duration-adjusted 
bleeding events and rescue medication over time  showed an increase in platelet count over time as well 
as  a  decrease  in  duration-adjusted  bleeding  events  and  rescue  medication  over  time  for  the  Pediatric 
Efficacy  Set,  this  could  also  be  observed  for  the  separate  age  groups,  although  at  some  points  the 
number  of  subjects  was  too  low  to  draw  conclusions  upon.  In  general,  there  was  a  tendency  for  a 
decrease in the use of rescue medication and the number of bleeding events with an increase in platelet 
numbers but this was considered acceptable.  
The  incidence  of  rescue  ITP  medication  was  rather  high  in  both  study  arms  and  overall,  no  significant 
differences were observed between treatment arms, (41% in IP and 45% in placebo), resulting in a OR 
(95% CI) value of 0.8 (0.0, 2.4). Differences are noted by baseline age group: with double use of rescue 
medication  in  romiplostim  vs  placebo  (50%  vs  25%)  in  the  group  1  to  <6  years,  28%  vs  44%  in  the 
group  6  to  <12  years  and  50%  vs  57%  in  the  group  of  12  to  <18  years,  for  romiplostin  and  placebo 
respectively.  This  finding  is  unexpected  and  inconsistent  with  the  results  seen  in  the  adult  population, 
where a significantly higher proportion in placebo than in romiplostim needed rescue medication (60% in 
placebo  and  23%  in  romiplostim,  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC).  There  is  not  a  clear  explanation  for  this 
difference.  One  might  think  that  perhaps  in  children  a  more  cautious  approach  driven  by  the  higher 
activity, and thus risk for bleeding events, is taken in this population. On the other hand, the low number 
of patients in this lower age category makes it difficult to draw any conclusion. The higher use of rescue 
medication  is  not  concentrated  early  at  the  start  of treatment  as  we  had  previously  suggested  and  that 
the use decreases consistently over time in the three age groups, which is reassuring.  
With regards to the incidence of sustained platelet response (defined as every platelet count ≥ 50 × 109/L 
for at least 6 months in the absence of the investigational product and all other therapies dosed with the 
intent-to-treat ITP) no subjects in either treatment arm achieved a response. 
Given  that  recommended  doses  are  based  on  actual  body  weight,  the  MAH  anticipated  problems  in 
younger  children  or  at  least  those  who  weighed  <  50  Kg,  and  in  such  situation  a  1:2  dilution  or  1:4 
dilution is proposed to ensure an appropriate dispensable volume. Although the rationale behind appears 
adequate,  the  concern  is  that  this  requires  additional  manipulation  that  may  increase  the  risk  of 
medication errors  and  contamination,  particularly  because  the  initial  reconstitution  and  dilution  are both 
with  clear  dissolvent.  Considering  that  self-administration  is  not  permitted  for  children,  the  risk  is 
minimised  as  only  health  care  professionals  can  administer  Nplate.  In  addition,  appropriate  instructions 
are  provided  in  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC  and  the  educational  materials  for  nurses  in  order  to  minimise 
these risks. 
Based  on  the  data  presented  in  these  two  studies,  it  is  noted  that  the  median  time  to  reach  platelet 
counts  above  the  protective  level  50x109/L  was  6  weeks,  and  highly  variable  (25th-75th  percentiles:  4 
weeks- 10 weeks). This delay in reaching the treatment effect is a matter of concern and questions the 
proposed  dosing  regimen  for  this  population.  In  response  to  the  question  raised,  the  MAH  presented 
additional  analysis  to  investigate  whether  the  observed  difference  in  time  to  first  platelet  response 
between  adults  and  pediatric  patients  is  due  to  under  dosing.  The  starting  dose  of  1  ug/kg  showed  a 
response in 25.2% of the pediatric patients compared to 26,3% of the adults, as such the starting dose is 
considered  appropriate.  Noticeably,  the  first  platelet  response  of  the  majority  of  adults  occurs  at  lower 
doses (70.4 % in adults versus 46.2% in paediatrics at dosages of 1,2,3 ug/kg). Moreover, adults were 
permitted a higher maximum dose to reach the first platelet response then pediatric patients (10 ug/kg). 
Based on the data presented it appeared that a proportion of the pediatric patients required a higher dose 
and/or have a longer duration before the first platelet response occurs. Even so, after 13 weeks 85,5% of 
Assessment report

adults  and  84%  of  the  pediatric  patients  had  at  least  once  a  platelet  response.  As  such  the  relevance 
behind the observed difference in time to first platelet response between adults and paediatric is unknown 
and requires no further actions at this time.  
  Study 20060195 
All  22  subjects  (17  romiplostim, 5  placebo)  received  blinded investigational  product  and  were evaluated 
for efficacy. Of the 17 subjects who received romiplostim, 15 achieved a platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L for 2 
consecutive  weeks  (after  excluding  platelet  counts  within  4  weeks  following  rescue  medication  use) 
during  the  treatment  period  (88.2%,  95%  CI:  63.6%,  98.5%).  The  same  15  subjects  also  achieved  an 
increase  in platelet  count ≥  20  x 109/L  above  baseline  for  2  consecutive  weeks  (after  excluding  platelet 
counts  within  4  weeks  following  rescue  medication  use)  during  the  treatment  period  (88.2%,  95%  CI: 
63.6%,  98.5%).  None  of  the  subjects  treated  with  placebo  achieved  either  endpoint.  Treatment  with 
romiplostim  resulted  in  statistically  significantly  greater  incidence  of  platelet  responses  compared  to 
placebo (p = 0.0008). 
Two  of  17  subjects  (11.8%)  in  the  romiplostim  group  and  2  of  the  5  subjects  (40.0%)  in  the  placebo 
group received rescue medication during the treatment period.  
These data supported the pharmacodynamic effect of romiplostim in children (in line with that in adults), 
with an increase in platelet counts until a protective threshold in a substantial proportion of subjects. 
However, the benefit for patients in terms of reducing/preventing bleeding events is not that obvious. In 
fact a higher percentage of patients in romiplostim group (70%) than in placebo (40.0%) had bleeding 
events of any grade. It is acknowledged that the majority occurred in the first 6 weeks of treatment and 
that when corrected by time of exposure, no differences are found between treatment arms in this period, 
whilst a clear reduction is seen from this time point onwards, favouring romiplostin treatment. It is also 
noted that the vast majority were mild events and that bleeding events occurred with platelet counts 
below the target of 50 x 109/L, which alleviate the concern. Therefore, these events occurred mostly 
before Nplate reached an effective dose level, which based on the data presented seems to take quite a 
long time.    
 
Integrated analysis 
The integrated analysis over 5 studies revealed a total of 188 of 224 subjects (83.9%; 95% CI: 78.5%, 
88.5%) had platelet response, defined as at least 1 platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L without any use of rescue 
medication  within  4  weeks  prior to date of  the  platelet  measurement.  The  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  of  the 
time to first platelet response (50st percentile) was 6.0 weeks (95% CI: 5.0, 7.0). A total of 129 of 224 
subjects (57.6%; 95% CI: 50.8%, 64.1%) had sustained platelet response, defined as at least 9 weeks 
with platelet response within a 12-week period. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the time to first sustained 
platelet response (50th percentile), defined as the time from initiation of romiplostim to the start of the 
12-week period in which a sustained response was seen, was 20.0 weeks (95% CI: 15.0, 26.0). For the 
integrated analyses, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the time to first response (50th percentile) was similar 
across  age  groups  (7.0  weeks,  6.0  weeks,  and  6.0  weeks  for  subjects  aged  1  to  <  6  years,  6  to  <  12 
years, and  12 to < 18 years, respectively). 
The  MAH  provided  various  subgroup  analyses  in  the  integrated  efficacy  analysis  set.  Several  subgroup 
analyses showed numerical differences with variable results among endpoints. KM estimates of the time 
first  sustained  response  showed  difference  in  the  majority  of  subgroup  analysis,  e.g.  age,  years  since 
diagnosis, baseline bleeding status, prior splenectomy, and number of prior treatments. Given the limited 
number  of  patients in  most  of the  relevant  subgroups,  it  is difficult to  draw  firm  conclusions  from these 
data.

Long-term Efficacy Results 
Results from the presented 3 uncontrolled studies provided efficacy data for a median (range) duration of 
treatment  in the  long-term  studies  of  89  weeks  (6,  109  weeks)  in  Study  20030213,  100  weeks  (5, 321 
weeks) in Study 20090340 (as of 24 February 2016) and 25.0 weeks (1, 67 weeks) in Study 20101221 
(data cutoff 15 March 2016).  
In long-term safety Study 20090340, paediatric subjects (n = 65) receiving romiplostim for100.0 weeks 
(median  exposure  time;  range  5  to  321  weeks)  maintained  platelet  responses  in  the  absence  of  rescue 
medication  in  93.8%  of  subjects.  Across  all  subjects,  the  median  number  of  months  with  platelet 
response  was  20.0  months  (range:  0  to  80  months)  and  the  median  time  on  study  was  25.0  months 
(range: 2 to 80 months). The median percentage of months with a platelet response was 95.4% (range 
0-100).  In  the  integrated  analysis,  the  subject  incidence  of  platelet  response  showed  a  trend  toward 
increasing  over  time  (25.7%  at  month  1  to  >70%  from  month  7  through  month  111).  Final  results  of 
study  20090340  and  20101221  are  pending  as  data  on  only  a  limited  number  of  subjects  are  present 
after>3 years of treatment (year 3 n=44 towards year 9, n=5).  
In  the  presented  clinical  study  the  efficacy  of  romiplostim  to  elevate  platelet  counts  has  been  clearly 
demonstrated  and  is  in  line  with  previously  reported  data  in  chronic  adult  ITP  patients.  Prevention  of 
bleeding is ultimately the clinical benefit of interest for ITP patients, although a direct effect on bleeding 
has  not  been  clearly  demonstrated.  The  EMA/CHMP  “Guideline  on  the  clinical  development  of  medicinal 
products  intended  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  primary  immune  thrombocytopenia”  considers  that  “The 
platelet blood count is generally used as a valid surrogate in ITP because it measures treatment activity 
and is believed to be a reliable predictor of clinical benefit.” 
It  must  be  noted  that  a  considerable  number  of  subjects  do  not  respond  with  a  durable  response  to 
romiplostim  treatment  (52%  responders  in  study  20080279)  and  a  sustained  platelet  response  in  the 
integrated analysis (57.6% responders). Clinical guidelines issued by haematology societies focus on the 
platelet count as the key parameter to assess the bleeding risk in patients with ITP and the primary goal 
of treatment in chronic ITP is to achieve a platelet count sufficient to prevent clinically significant bleeding 
with the least toxicity. The SmPC contains recommendations to continuously monitor platelet counts over 
time  and  stop  treatment  if  the  effect  is  no  longer  maintained,  for  the  small  proportion  of  patients  that 
spontaneously  recover  in  time  the  dose  of  romiplostim  will  as  such  be  reduced  or  interrupted  when 
platelet counts increase. 
A  discussion  of  the  overall  experience  with  self-administration  across  the  different  studies  has  been 
presented. A total of 194 out of 282 subjects (68.8%) self-administered (or received from a caregiver) at 
least 1 dose of romiplostim in Studies 20030213, 20090340, and 20101221 (as of 20 March 2017). 
Efficacy  of  romiplostim  was  demonstrated  in  subjects  on  self-administration  (SA)  with  99.5%  showing a 
platelet  response  (at  least  1  platelet  count  ≥  50  x  109/L  without  any  use  of  rescue  medication  within  4 
weeks  prior  to  date  of  the  platelet  measurement)  and  85.1%  showing  sustained  platelet  response  (at 
least  9  weeks  with  platelet  response  within  a  12-week  period).  The  subject  incidence  of  at  least  1 
composite  bleeding  at  any  time  during  treatment  was  approximately  38%.  The  safety  profile  of 
romiplostim  in  this  subset  of  subjects  on  SA  was  similar  to  the  safety  profile  in  the  integrated  pediatric 
ITP safety set, with similar adverse events reported for both groups. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
TThe clinical package submitted presented is rather extensive and supports the extension of the indication 
to  the  paediatric  population  with  ITP.  Overall,  the  data  provided  are  indicative  of  a  clinical  benefit  in 
terms of platelet count increase, with a statistically significant greater proportion of romiplostim  treated 
subjects achieving a sustained platelet response compared to placebo in the two main studies presented. 
Moreover, this effect is maintained in the long term while on treatment as shown by the efficacy data with

a  median  duration  of  treatment  of  >1  year.  The  observed  efficacy  was  generally  consistent  among  the 
age  cohorts  and  supported  by  secondary  endpoints.  The  data  obtained  is  in  line  with  the  efficacy  in 
adults, platelet counts are increased significantly a majority of patients.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
TThe  key  risks  associated  with  romiplostim  in  adults  include  medication  errors  (dosing/administration), 
thrombotic/ thromboembolic complications, increased bone marrow reticulin, bone marrow fibrosis, risk of 
bleeding in ITP patients who have consistently low platelet counts, and reoccurrence of thrombocytopenia 
after cessation of romiplostim.   
Patient exposure 
Paediatric ITP Randomized Safety Set (N=59 romiplostim, N=24 placebo) 
Weekly dose: In Study 20060195 the mean (SD) average weekly dose of romiplostim was 3.6 (1.7) 
μg/kg. In Study 20080279 the mean (SD) average weekly dose of romiplostim was 4.5 (2.4) μg/kg. 
Study 20060195 had a shorter duration of exposure than Study 20080279 (median 16 vs 24 weeks) and 
also included a PK period. 
Maximum dose: The mean (SD) maximum dose (μg/kg) in the romiplostim group was (6.1 [3.1] μg/kg). 
[In the placebo group this was 9.2 [2.1] μg/kg.] 
Duration of treatment: The mean (SD) duration of treatment was 21.5 (4.1) weeks in the romiplostim 
arm and 19.9 (6.2) weeks in the placebo arm.  
Paediatric ITP Safety Set (N=224 romiplostim, N=4 placebo) 
This consists of all paediatric subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational product in an ITP 
study (Studies 20060195, 20080279, 20030213, 20090340, and 20101221). 
Patient numbers: 204 subjects received romiplostim only, 20 subjects received placebo and romiplostim 
and 4 subjects received placebo only. 
Weekly romiplostim dose: The mean average weekly dose was 5.4 (2.7) μg/kg.  
Maximum romiplostim dose: The mean (SD) maximum dose was 7.5 (3.2) μg/kg. 
Duration of treatment: The mean duration of treatment was 65.5 weeks (range:  1 to 441 weeks).

Table 14 Number of Subjects Exposed to Romiplostim by Treatment Duration (Paediatric ITP Safety Set) 
In the Paediatric ITP Safety Set (n=224), the mean duration of treatment was approximately 65 ± 82 
weeks, median 36 weeks (Q1, Q3: 19, 73; Min 1, Max 441 weeks).  
As can be seen in Table 14 which gives the number of subjects exposed to romiplostim by treatment  
duration, 145/224 (65%) paediatric subjects have received romiplostim for >24 weeks, approximately 
17% (n=25) of these subjects for > 3 years.  
90/224 subjects (40%) had a treatment duration of >48 weeks, 57/224 (25%) had a treatment duration 
of >72 weeks, 48/224 subjects (21%) had a treatment duration of >96 weeks and 25/224 subjects 
(11%) had a treatment duration of >144 weeks (2.8 years). 
An update of study 20090340 and 20101221 was provided. The MAH provided an updated dataset in 
which 40/282 subjects (13,8%) had a treatment duration of >144 weeks, compared to the previous data-
cut in which approximately 11% had an exposure duration longer than 144 weeks, unfortunately the 
increase in number of patients is limited.   
The Pediatric Efficacy and Safety set consisted of studies 20060195, 20080279, 20030213, 20090340 
and 20101221. Addition of final data from Study 20090340 and study 20101221 resulted in an update 
with a longer mean duration of treatment 65.5 weeks compared with 84.7 weeks. In study 20101221 all 
subjects had treatment duration of <144 weeks at the data-cut. The update efficacy data show an 
increased platelet response (89.4% versus 83.9%), an increased sustained platelet response (68.4% 
versus 57.6%) compared to the previous data cut. This increase in the efficacy endpoints was 
consistently shown in the secondary endpoints. As expected, patients with >144 weeks treatment 
duration all had a platelet response which could be defined as a sustained platelet response in 95% of the 
cases (38/40), this was also reflected in other efficacy endpoints. 
The safety update shows an increased reporting of TEAE (88.8% versus 93.3%). The TEAE with the 
highest incidence by preferred term remained unchanged even when corrected for duration. Moreover, 
similar TEAEs were reported in subjects with duration of >144 weeks or <144 weeks. Although the 
update of efficacy and safety data was minimal with a small increase in patients with exposure >144

weeks, no apparent differences in efficacy and safety analysis are observed with a longer treatment 
duration and the results are in line with that previously observed. The final results on study 20101221 are 
expected  
Adverse events 
Paediatric Randomized ITP Safety Set  
During Studies 20060195 and 20080279, most subjects (96.6% romiplostim, 100% placebo) reported 1 
or more treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), most of these events were mild (grade 1) or 
moderate (grade 2) in severity.    
More subjects receiving romiplostim (20.3%) compared with placebo (4.2%) had serious adverse events 
but no subjects in either treatment group had adverse events that led to discontinuation from the study 
or investigational product.  There were no fatal adverse events for subjects in either treatment group of 
either study in Table 15). 
Overall the duration–adjusted incidence event rate was 3363.8 per 100 subject-years for romiplostim 
subjects and 3792.1 per 100 subject-years for placebo subjects (Table 16).

UPaediatric ITP Safety Set  
In the Paediatric ITP Safety Set most subjects (88.8% romiplostim, 100% placebo) reported 1 or more 
TEAE, most of which were mild (grade 1) or moderate (grade 2) in severity. (Table 17). More subjects 
receiving romiplostim (18.3%) compared with placebo (4.2%) had serious adverse events. In these 
subjects, 4 romiplostim subjects had an adverse event leading to discontinuation of investigational 
product and 1 romiplostim subject had an adverse event leading to study discontinuation. There were no 
fatal adverse events for subjects in either treatment group. 
Overall the duration–adjusted incidence event rate was 1559.0 per 100 subject-years for romiplostim 
subjects and 3792.1 per 100 subject-years for placebo subjects.

TEAEs 
Subject incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events occurring in at least 5% of subjects in the 
romiplostim and placebo treatment groups overall in the Paediatric ITP Safety Set are summarized by 
MedDRA Usystem organ class.U For subjects receiving romiplostim, the highest subject incidences for 
adverse events were reported in the system organ classes of infections and infestations (69.2%), 
gastrointestinal disorders (60.3%), and respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (56.7%).  For 
subjects receiving placebo, the highest subject incidences of adverse events were reported in the system 
organ classes of gastrointestinal disorders (66.7%), injury, poisoning, and procedural complications 
(62.5%), and nervous system disorders (62.5%). 
These incidences were very similar in the Paediatric Randomized ITP Safety Set.

Table 19. Subject Incidence of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Occurring inat least 5% in Either 
Treatment Group by System Organ Class(Paediatric ITP Safety Set) 
Subject incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events occurring in at least 5% of subjects in the 
Paediatric ITP Safety Set in either treatment group by MedDRA  Upreferred termU in descending order of 
frequency are summarized in Table 20. 
The treatment-emergent adverse events of highest subject incidence in the Paediatric ITP Safety Set 
were headache (40.2% romiplostim; 54.2% placebo), epistaxis (34.8% romiplostim; 45.8% placebo), 
contusion (26.8% romiplostim; 33.3% placebo), and cough (26.3% romiplostim; 12.5% placebo). 
These frequencies were very similar to those in the Paediatric Randomized ITP Safety Set in which overall 
across studies, the treatment-emergent adverse events with the highest subject incidence by preferred 
term were epistaxis (44.1% romiplostim; 45.8% placebo), contusion (40.7% romiplostim; 33.3% 
placebo), headache (40.7% romiplostim; 54.2% placebo), and upper respiratory tract infection (30.5% 
romiplostim; 25.0% placebo). 
Apart from the TEAEs occurring most frequently, the frequencies of the other TEAEs by preferred term in 
the romiplostim group were also very similar to those in the Randomised Paediatric ITP Safety Set. 
When the treatment-emergent adverse events were adjusted for duration, adverse events with the 
highest incidence event rates (number of adverse events per 100 subject-years) in the Paediatric ITP 
Safety Set overall (with N=224 romiplostim vs 24 placebo patients) were contusion (191.1 romiplostim; 
366.3 placebo), headache (105.0 romiplostim; 356.4 placebo), epistaxis (88.6 romiplostim; 198.0 
placebo) and petechiae (76.7 romiplostim; 128.7 placebo).

In the Randomised Paediatric ITP Safety Set (with N=59 romiplostim vs 24 placebo patients), the 3 
adverse events with the highest duration adjusted incidence event rates overall were also contusion 
(543.7 romiplostim, 366.3 placebo), headache (281.6 romiplostim, 356.4 placebo), and epistaxis (273.8 
romiplostim, 198.0 placebo) (details can be found in ISS Table 14-6.2.2.3). 
A child (between 4-6-year-old) enrolled in Study 20080279, had 61 events of contusion (affecting the 
head, body, and limbs) over the span of the 24.3-week treatment period (this case is summarised 
below). Two ad hoc analyses were performed for duration-adjusted event rates for contusion; 1 with all of 
the subjects and 1 excluding subject. Including all subjects, the duration-adjusted event rate per 100 
subject-years in the romiplostim arm was 664.5 compared with 384.8 in the placebo arm. However, when 
this subject was excluded from the analysis, the duration adjusted event rate per 100 subject-years event 
rate was lower in the romiplostim arm (373.1) compared with the placebo group (384.8).

Treatment-related TEAEs 
In the Paediatric Safety Set the subject incidence of treatment-related adverse events (as reported by the 
investigator) was similar in the romiplostim (24.6%) and placebo (25.0%) groups in the Paediatric ITP 
Safety Set. 
Treatment-related adverse events occurring in more than 1 subject per treatment group included 
headache (11.2% romiplostim; 12.5% placebo), nausea (3.1% romiplostim; 4.2% placebo), pain in 
extremity (2.7% romiplostim; 4.2% placebo), arthralgia (2.2% romiplostim; 0.0% placebo), and 
dizziness (2.2% romiplostim, 0.0% placebo). 
When the treatment-related, treatment-emergent adverse events were adjusted for duration, the adverse 
events with the highest incidence event rates (number of adverse events per 100 subject-years) overall 
were headache (16.0 romiplostim; 29.7 placebo), nausea (4.5 romiplostim; 19.8 placebo), arthralgia (2.8 
romiplostim; 0.0 placebo), and pain in extremity (2.8 romiplostim; 9.9 placebo). 
In the Randomised ITP Paediatric Safety Set, the subject incidence of treatment-related adverse events 
(as reported by the investigator) was similar in the romiplostim (23.7%) and placebo (25.0%) treatment 
groups.  Treatment-related adverse events occurring in more than 1 subject per treatment group included

headache (8.5% romiplostim; 12.5% placebo), pyrexia (3.4% romiplostim; 4.2% placebo), contusion 
(3.4% romiplostim; 0.0% placebo), and urticaria (3.4% romiplostim; 0.0% placebo). 
When the treatment-related, treatment-emergent adverse events were adjusted for duration, the adverse 
events with the highest incidence event rates (number of adverse events per 100 subject years) overall 
were headache (27.4 romiplostim; 29.7 placebo), contusion (19.6 romiplostim; 0.0 placebo), pruritus 
(15.6 romiplostim; 0.0 placebo). 
Grade 3 or Above adverse events 
In the Paediatric Randomized ITP Safety Set, the overall subject incidence with grade 3 treatment-
emergent adverse events was 13.6% romiplostim subjects and 16.7% placebo subjects.  
The preferred term platelet count decreased occurred in 2 (3.4%) romiplostim subjects and no placebo 
subjects.  All other grade 3 treatment emergent adverse events were reported in a single subject each. 
When the grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events were adjusted for duration, the adverse events by 
preferred term with the highest incidence event rates (number of adverse events per 100 subject-years) 
were platelet count decreased (35.2 romiplostim, 0.0 placebo), and headache (3.9 romiplostim, 19.8 
placebo).  
The subject incidence of grade 4 treatment emergent adverse events was 5.1% romiplostim subjects 
(thrombocytopenia in 3.4%; platelet count decreased in 1.7%) and 4.2% placebo subjects ( only one 
subject (4.2%), with platelet count decreased). 
In the Paediatric ITP Safety Set, the percentage of patients experiencing Grade ≥3 and Grade ≥4 TEAEs 
was almost the same in both treatment groups: for Grade ≥3 it was 21% in both treatment groups and 
for Grade ≥4 it was 5.4% for romiplostim and 4.2% for placebo. 
In the Paediatric ITP Safety Set, the subject incidence of grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events 
was 18.3% romiplostim subjects and 16.7% placebo subjects. The treatment-emergent grade 3 adverse 
events with the highest subject incidence by preferred term were epistaxis (4.0% romiplostim, 0.0% 
placebo), headache (3.1% romiplostim, 4.2% placebo), and petechiae (1.3% romiplostim, 4.2% 
placebo).  When the grade 3 treatment emergent adverse events were adjusted for duration, the adverse 
events by preferred term with the highest incidence event rates (number of adverse events per 100 
subject-years) were platelet count decreased (7.3 romiplostim, 0.0 placebo), headache (4.9 romiplostim, 
19.8 placebo), and epistaxis (3.5 romiplostim, 0.0 placebo).  
The subject incidence of Grade 4 treatment-emergent adverse events was 5.4% romiplostim subjects 
(n=8, thrombocytopenia in 3.6%; n=2 platelet count decreased in 0.9%). 
Treatment-related grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 8/224 (3.6%) of 
romiplostim subjects only and no placebo subjects .  The highest incidences of grade 3 treatment-related, 
treatment-emergent adverse events by preferred term were headache 3 (1.3%) and abdominal pain 2 
(0.9%), both in romiplostim subjects. The duration adjusted incidence rates (number of adverse events 
per 100 subject years) were reported for romiplostim subjects only and included headache (1.7), 
abdominal pain (0.7); event rates for ecchymosis, epistaxis, pain in extremity, thrombocytosis and 
vomiting were all 0.3. One romiplostim subject (0.4%) had a grade 4 treatment-emergent adverse event 
of thrombocytopenia that was considered treatment-related.

In the Paediatric Randomized ITP Safety Set, 12 subjects (20.3%) receiving romiplostim and 1 subject 
(4.2%) receiving placebo had treatment-emergent serious adverse events.  Serious adverse events that 
occurred in > 1 subject receiving romiplostim were epistaxis and headache (2 subjects [3.4%] each).   
When the serious, treatment emergent adverse events were adjusted for duration (number of adverse 
events per 100 subject years), the adverse events with the highest incidence event rates overall were 
epistaxis and headache both at 7.8 events per 100 subject-years and both in the romiplostim group.  
For the single placebo treated patient the serious AEs reported were haematuria and an animal bite. 
Treatment-related serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 1 (1.7%) romiplostim 
subject and no placebo subjects and included thrombocytosis and headache in a single subject. 
In the Paediatric ITP Safety Set 41 subjects (18.3%) receiving romiplostim and 1 subject (4.2%) 
receiving placebo had treatment-emergent serious adverse events. Serious adverse events that occurred 
in > 2 (0.9%) subjects receiving romiplostim were epistaxis (4.0%), thrombocytopenia (2.2%), 
headache, ITP, influenza, petechiae, platelet count decreased, pyrexia (1.3% each). No serious adverse 
events occurred in > 1 subject receiving placebo.  
When the serious, treatment-emergent adverse events were adjusted for duration, the adverse events 
with the highest incidence event rate were epistaxis (3.8), platelet count decreased (2.8), 
thrombocytopenia (2.4), and petechiae (1.7) and were reported for romiplostim only. 
When the treatment-related, serious, treatment-emergent adverse events were adjusted for duration, 
adverse events rates were reported for romiplostim subjects only and were 0.3 for abdominal pain, 
anemia, epistaxis, headache, thrombocytopenia, and thrombocytosis.

TIn  the  Paediatric  Randomized  ITP  Safety  Set  the  MedDRA  preferred  terms  identified  from  the  EOI 
searches  for  thrombocytosis  were  reported  in  2/59  (3.4%)  romiplostim  subjects  (  these  were  in  Study 
20080279) and 0 (0.0%) placebo subjects.  
TThese  thrombocytosis  events  by  preferred  term  consisted  of  thrombocytosis  (1.7%  romiplostim;  0.0% 
placebo),  and  platelet  count  abnormal  (1.7%  romiplostim;  0.0%  placebo).    When  the  treatment-
emergent  adverse  events  were  adjusted  for  duration,  incidence  event  rates,  the  number  of  adverse 
events  per  100  subject  year  were  platelet  count  abnormal  (1  [3.9]  romiplostim;  0  [0.0]  placebo),  and 
thrombocytosis (1 [3.9] romiplostim; 0 [0.0] placebo) 
TIn  Study  20080279,  1  (1.7%)  romiplostim  subject  had  a  grade  1  thrombocytosis  adverse  event,  and  1 
(1.7%) romiplostim subject had a grade 3 event that was also considered serious and treatment-related.

P/L. 
9
TThe MAH provided an overview and analysis of frequencies of platelet counts above and below 450x10P
P/L, 
confirming  that  the  incidence  of  laboratory  occurrence  of  platelet  count  >450x10P
9
P/L  in  the  Pediatric  ITP 
Safety  Set  at  any  time  was  28.4%  in  the  romiplostim  group.  In  the  MAH  response,  the  distinction  was 
made  between  thrombocytosis  as  a  MedDRA  preferred  term,  as  a  laboratory  value  of  platelet  count 
9
>450x10P
P/L  and  as  an  adverse  event  reported  at  the  discretion  of  the  investigator  based  on  clinical 
9
significance.  Although  laboratory  platelet  counts  >450x10P
P/L  were  common,  in  the  Pediatric  ITP  Safety 
Set  there  was  only  one  subject  incidence  of  thrombocytosis  as  an  adverse  event  (serious,  Grade  3 
9
platelet count of 1462 x10P
P/L) and one subject incidence of increased platelet count (up to a maximum of 
9
872  x10P
P/L)  reported  as  an  adverse  event.  The  MAH  provided  the  information  that  the  majority  of  the 
9
high  platelet  counts  lasted  less  than  7  days.  Concerning  platelet  counts  >450x10P
P/L  in  the  282 
9
romiplostim treated patients, it can be seen that the median of these counts was 588 x10P
P/L with Q1, Q3 
approximately  500  and  700  respectively  and  maximum  of  1700.  The  duration  of  these  counts  was  ≤7 
days in 80.6% of the events, 7 to ≤14 days in 10.6%, 14 to ≤21 days in 1.9% and ≥22 days in 8.8%. It 
9
can also be seen that rescue medication had been taken within 7 days before the first count >450x10P
P/L 
in 16.3% of the events and it is conceivable that this may have contributed to some high counts. 
TFrom these results, it seems that the potential risk of thromboembolic events (TEEs) was limited as 75% 
9
of the counts were <700x10P
P/L, which although a high value would not be expected to pose a significant 
risk  in  itself  in  the  absence  of  risk  factors  for  TEEs.  Moreover,  80%  lasted  ≤7  days  and  a  dose  was 
withheld in 90% of the events. The MAH clarified the range and distribution of platelet counts measured 
in the paediatric population during the clinical trials, the large majority of which did not fall within a range 
which  is  usually  considered  in  itself  to  pose  a  risk  of  thrombosis.  The  possibility  of  high  platelet  counts 
and  risk  of  thromboembolic  events  are  adequately  covered  in  the  SmPC  and  it  is  not  considered 
necessary to add further information on thrombocytosis in the SmPC.  
THaemorrhage

TPaediatric Randomized ITP Safety Set 
TThe  MedDRA  preferred  terms  identified  from  the  SMQ  searches  for  hemorrhage  were  reported  in  46/59 
(78.0%) romiplostim subjects and 15/24 (62.5%) placebo subjects.  
TThe most frequently reported (by subject incidence) hemorrhage adverse events by preferred term were 
epistaxis  (44.1%  romiplostim;  45.8%  placebo),  contusion  (40.7%  romiplostim;  33.3%  placebo)  and 
petechiae  (22.0%  romiplostim;  29.2%  placebo.  When  the  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  were 
adjusted for duration, the adverse events with the highest incidence event rates (per 100 subject years) 
overall were contusion (139 [543.7] romiplostim, 37 [366.3] placebo), epistaxis (70 [273.8] romiplostim,

TThe Subject Incidence of Haemorrhages (SMQ) Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by Preferred Term in 
Descending Order of Frequency  in the Paediatric ITP Randomized Safety Set was quite similar to that in 
the Paediatric ITP Safety Set (please be referred to Table below), with epistaxis, contusion and petechiae 
being the most common followed by mouth bleeds, haematoma and injection site bruising. 
 
TPaediatric ITP Safety Set 
TThe MedDRA preferred terms identified from the SMQ searches for hemorrhage were reported in 143/224 
(63.8%) romiplostim subjects and 15/24 (62.5%) placebo subjects (Table 22).   
TThe most frequently reported (by subject incidence) hemorrhage adverse events by preferred term were 
epistaxis  (34.8%  romiplostim;  45.8%  placebo),  contusion  (26.8%  romiplostim;  33.3%  placebo)  and 
petechiae  (21.0%  romiplostim;  29.2%  placebo  (Table  22).    When  the  treatment-emergent  adverse 
events were adjusted for duration, the adverse events with the highest incidence event rates (number of 
adverse  events  per  100  subject-years)  were  contusion  (191.1  romiplostim,  366.3  placebo),  epistaxis 
(88.6  romiplostim,  198.0  placebo),  petechiae  (76.7  romiplostim;  128.7  placebo),  and  hematoma  (18.8 
romiplostim; 49.5 placebo)

Term in Descending Order of Frequency (Paediatric ITP Safety Set)(Part 2) 
TA  high  subject  incidence  of  haemorrhagic  AEs  was  seen  in  the  romiplostim  group  in  the  Randomized 
Paediatric ITP Set, where it was not less than in the placebo group and also in the romiplostim group in 
the Randomized Paediatric ITP Set (approximately 60%). This is in line with the data on bleeding events 
as presented in the efficacy section.

USubjects with Consistently Low Platelet Counts 
TThe  MAH  has  summarised  haemorrhages  (SMQ)  events  for  subjects  who  had  consistently  low  platelet 
counts.  Eleven  subjects  in  the  romiplostim  group  and  5  placebo  subject  had  consistently  low  platelet 
9
counts  defined  as  a  platelet  count of  <  20x10P
P/L  with  dose  ≥  10  µg/kg  for 4   consecutive  weeks.  All  of 
the  5  placebo  subjects  and  9  of  the  11  romiplostim  subjects  (81.8%)  who  had  consistently  low  platelet 
values, reported any haemorrhages events.   
TOf  those  9  subjects,  9  had  grade  1  events;  5  had grade  2  events,  and  4  had  grade  3  events;  2 events 
were serious. 
TOne of those 9 subjects had haemorrhage events that were considered treatment-related; one event was 
grade 1, one was grade 2, and one was grade 3; none were serious.   
TOf  those  5  placebo  subjects,  5  had  grade  1  events;  one  had  a  grade  2  event,  and  one  had  a  grade  3 
events; one reported a serious haemorrhages events and one reported  a treatment related event. 
USubjects with Variable Platelet Counts 
TThe  MAH  has  summarised  haemorrhages  (SMQ)  events  for  subjects  who  had variable  platelet  counts.  A 
total of 77 subjects in the romiplostim group and 2 placebo subjects had variable platelet counts defined

following  consecutive  week.    The  incidence  of  subjects  reporting  any  haemorrhages  events  was  76.6% 
(59/77)  romiplostim  subjects  and  both  placebo  subjects.  In  the  romiplostim  group  56  (72.7%)  subjects 
had grade 1 events; 21 (27.3%) subjects had grade 2 events, and 9 (11.7%) subjects had grade 3; 10 
subjects had haemorrhage events that were serious. Four romiplostim subjects had haemorrhages events 
that  were  considered  treatment-related;  2  subjects  had  grade  1  events,  2  subjects  had  grade  2  events 
and 1 subject had grade 3 events and 1 subject had a serious treatment-related event.  
TThe 2 placebo subjects had grade 1 events; none were serious or considered treatment-related.

Tn = number of subjects 
TDuration  adjusted  incidence  event  rates  (number  of  adverse  events  per  100  subject-years)  of 
haemorrhages (SMQ) events overall by age group were:

T≥ 12 to < 18 years 264.8 romiplostim; 645.8 placebo  
TThe  incidence  of  haemorrhage  events  is  quite  similar  in  all  three  age  categories,  varying  from 
approximately 58% to 68%. The numbers of patients per age category in the placebo group are too small 
to allow comparison per age category. 
UHaemorrhages Events by Sex Subgroups

UHaemorrhages Events by Baseline Bleeding Status 
TThe baseline bleeding status was derived based on medical history data and adverse event data prior to 
first  dose.    Most  subjects (romiplostim  and placebo)  were  in the  baseline  bleeding  status  Yes  subgroup.  
The  overall  subject  incidence  of  haemorrhages  (SMQ)  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  was  similar

across categories by region:  
 
 
 
TNorth America 77.0% (77/100) romiplostim; 75.0% (15/20) placebo 
TEuropean Union 57.1% (28/49) romiplostim; 0.0% (0/1) placebo  
Tother 50.7% (38/75) romiplostim; 0.0% (0/3) placebo  
Dosing / Administration Errors 
TAs romiplostim is administered in small volumes, and small differences in dose may have large effects on 
platelet counts, there is the potential for medication errors to occur.  Overdose may result in an excessive 
increase  in  platelet  counts  associated  with  thrombotic/thromboembolic  complications;  under-dose  may 
result in low platelet counts that can lead to an increased risk of bleeding events. 
TThere  have  been  no  reported  cases  involving  an  event  from  the  medication  error  SMQ  with  an  adult 
subject in the clinical trial setting  
TThere has been 1 reported case (0.4%, 95% CI: 0.0, 2.5) involving a medication error (not serious) with 
a paediatric subject in the clinical trial setting.  
TThe type of errors reported in the post-marketing setting have included reports of dilution/reconstitution 
errors and calculation errors (resulting in overdose or under-dose); use of incorrect diluents; and wrong 
route of administration (ie, IV instead of SC). In brief, in the paediatric post-marketing setting, the search 
for  medication  error  (SMQ)  returned  15  post-marketing  cases  (with  19  events,  2  of  which  were  serious 
[accidental  overdose  and  overdose],  but  not  fatal)  from  478  paediatric  patient-years  exposed  to 
romiplostim. 
TThrombotic/Thromboembolic Events 
TMedDRA  preferred  terms  identified  from  the  SMQ  searches  for  thrombotic/thromboembolic  events 
included  the  preferred  term  deep  vein  thrombosis  (grade  2)  in  one  (0.4%)  romiplostim  subject  in  the 
Paediatric ITP Safety Set and none in the placebo group. Adjusted for duration, incidence event rates (per 
100 subject years) for deep vein thrombosis were 1 (0.3) romiplostim; 0 [0.0] placebo. 
TIn  the  paediatric  post  marketing  setting,  the  search  for  embolic  and  thrombotic  SMQ  events  returned  6 
post  marketing  cases  (with  7  events,  all  of  which  were  serious).  There  were  no  fatal  events.  The 
preferred  terms  for  these  7  events  were:    pulmonary  embolism  (n  =  2),  and  single  events  of  transient 
ischaemic  attack,  transverse  sinus  thrombosis,  jugular  vein  thrombosis,  disseminated  intravascular 
coagulation, and cerebral thrombosis. 
THaematological Malignancies 
TNo MedDRA preferred terms identified from the EOI (Event of Interest) searches for haematologic 
Tmalignancies  or  myelodysplastic  syndrome  treatment-emergent  events  were  reported  in  the  Paediatric 
Assessment report

ITP  Safety  Set.(In  the  Paediatric  ITP  Safety  Set  there  were  also  no  MedDRA  preferred  terms  identified 
from the EOI searches for malignancies treatment-emergent events.)  
TIn adult clinical studies of treatment with romiplostim in patients with MDS, cases of transient increases 
in blast cell counts were observed and cases of MDS disease progression to AML were reported. 
TIn  the  paediatric  clinical  studies  in  ITP,  in  studies  20080279  and  20060195  in  the  differential  counts  in 
peripheral blood, myeloblasts were specifically counted for but none were found.  
TIn the bone marrow examinations in study 20101221, no subject showed any bone marrow abnormalities 
that were not consistent with an underlying diagnosis of ITP at baseline or on-treatment.  
TIn study 20090340 there is no mention of blast cells in the study report. 
TIn the Integrated Summary of Safety tables there is also no mention of blast cells. 
TThere were no cases of abnormal presence of blast cells in peripheral blood in the paediatric patients in 
these  studies  and  no  evidence  for  the  development  of  a  haematological  malignancy,  in  particular  a 
myeloid malignancy. 
TBone marrow fibrosis 
TStudy  20101221  [A  Single  Arm,  Open-label,  Long-term  Efficacy  and  Safety  Study  of  Romiplostim  in 
Thrombocytopenic Paediatric Subjects With ITP] included a supplement to evaluate bone marrow changes 
in  the  EU,  Turkey,  and  Switzerland.  The  primary  objective  defined  for  the  protocol  supplement  (in 
addition to those already defined in the main protocol) was to evaluate the incidence of changes in bone 
marrow findings at year 1 or year 2 after initial exposure to romiplostim. The secondary objective defined 
for  the  protocol  supplement  was  to  evaluate  the  incidence  of  increased  reticulin  as  evidenced  by  silver 
staining at year 1 or at year 2, after exposure to romiplostim. 
TAt the time of the data cutoff (16 May 2016), the results were: 
 
TA  total  of  66  subjects  were  enrolled  into  the  protocol  supplement  for  the  EU,  Switzerland,  and 
Turkey. Of these subjects, 30 subjects were in cohort 1 (bone marrow samples taken at baseline 
and year 1) and 36 subjects were in cohort 2 (bone marrow samples taken at baseline and year 
2). 
 
TTwenty-two  subjects  (73.3%)  from  cohort  1  and  no  subjects  from  cohort 2  had  a  bone  marrow 
sample collected after the initiation of romiplostim therapy and were included in the bone marrow 
analysis set.   Nine subjects (30.0%) had an end of  treatment biopsy or a year 1 biopsy outside 
the  window  of  day 365  ± 4 weeks  and  13 subjects  (43.3%)  had  a  year  1  biopsy  within  the 
cohort-specified window. Note that for 1 subject, the core biopsy sample at year 1 had not been 
received  by  the  laboratory  in  time  to  be  analyzed  and  as  a  result  the  subject  did  not  have  an 
evaluable Bauermeister grade. 
 
TNo  subjects  had  a  Bauermeister  score  above  1  at  either  baseline  or  on-study.  Therefore,  no 
subjects  met  the  primary  endpoints  for  development  of  collagen  or  an  increase  in  bone  marrow 
reticulin (Bauermeister score increase of ≥ 2 grades). 
 
TNo  subject  showed  any  bone  marrow  abnormalities  that  were  not  consistent  with  an  underlying 
diagnosis of ITP at baseline or on-treatment.  
 
TNo  subjects  had  a  repeat  follow-up  bone  marrow  biopsy  at  end-of-study  as  this  was  only  to  be 
performed  when  subjects were  withdrawn  due to  a presence  of  collagen or  a change  to grade  3 
reticulin. 
 
TFour  subjects  (19.0%)  were  noted  as  having  developed  increased  reticulin  (any  increase  from 
baseline  in  modified  Bauermeister  grade).    However,  it  is  noted  that  for  Subjects  22121001001 
and  22121001002,  due  to  an  error  in  data  transfer  at  the  time  of  the  snapshot,  the  baseline 
values were  not properly included in the data.   The  actual baseline Bauermeister grade for both 
Subject 22121001001 and 22121001002 was 1 and the Bauermeister grade at week 52 was also 
1  for  both  subjects;  therefore,  no  increase  from  baseline  in  Bauermeister  grade  (and

subsequently no increased reticulin) was observed for these 2 subjects. 
 
TNo new safety signals for romiplostim were identified. 
TWith regards to the paediatric population, the search for myelofibrosis EOI (Event of Interest) returned 4 
cases  of  bone  marrow  reticulin  fibrosis  as  serious  adverse  events  following  treatment  with  romiplostim 
from  spontaneous  sources.  For  all  4  cases,  the  causal  relationship  between  the  event  and  romiplostim 
was not provided by the reporter. 
THowever, an apparently mild increase in reticulin (not meeting the primary endpoints for development of 
collagen  or  an  increase  in  bone  marrow  reticulin  (Bauermeister  score  increase  of  ≥  2  grades)  has  been 
seen in 2 subjects in the clinical long term study 20101221 who did not have fibrosis at baseline. This can 
be concluded on the basis of the 4 subjects having any increase from baseline in modified Bauermeister 
grade,  thus  a  grade  ≤1  on  study  which  in  2  of  these  4  subjects  was  not  present  at  baseline  and  in  2 
subjects  it  was  present  at  baseline.  There  were  also  4  post-marketing  reports  relating  to  bone  marrow 
fibrosis.    
TThe interim results of Study 20101221 showed that 7/31 (22.5%) of subjects (5/27 after 1 year exposure 
and  2/4  after  2  years  exposure)  had  a  low/mild  degree  of  reticulin  (thus  no  mature  collagen).  The 
frequencies of increase in bone marrow reticulin in this study are difficult to compare with the findings in 
the  adult  study  20080009  (0/34  subjects  after  one year  exposure,  2/39  after  2  years)  due to the  small 
numbers.  Unfortunately  there  were  no  follow-up  biopsies  to  provide  information  on  reversibility  of 
reticulin formation in pediatric patients and there is very little data about reversibility in adults. 
TFurthermore,  results  from  adult  Study  20080009  are  suggestive  that  the  incidence  of  increase  in  bone 
marrow  reticulin  rises  with  increasing  duration  of  exposure  to  romiplostim.  So  far  it  is  not  known  if  the 
increases of bone marrow reticulin may have clinical consequences or if the incidence of the more severe 
collagen fibrosis may increase with durations of exposure >1 year.  
Laboratory findings 
Paediatric ITP Safety Set 
In the Paediatric ITP Safety Set there was no evidence of clinically significant changes in mean laboratory 
values for the hematology other than platelet values and serum chemistry parameters in either treatment 
group. 
Two subjects (1 romiplostim; 1 placebo) had a grade 4 post baseline decrease in neutrophil count. Six 
subjects in the romiplostim group had grade 3 post baseline decreases for hemoglobin and 2 subjects in 
the romiplostim group had grade 3 post baseline decreases for leucocytes. No subjects had grade 4 
decreases in hemoglobin or leucocytes. Maximum post baseline grade 4 platelet values (decrease) are 
summarized below for romiplostim and placebo subjects.

Sixteen (7.1%) romiplostim subjects had a shift from grade 4 platelet value at baseline to grade 3 
platelet value (decrease) post-baseline. 
The incidence of maximum post baseline grade 3 platelet values (decrease) are summarised below for 
romiplostim and placebo subjects. 
Two (0.9%) romiplostim subjects had a shift from grade 3 at baseline to grade 2 platelet value 
(decrease) post baseline. 
Two subjects in the romiplostim group had a maximum postbaseline grade 3 value for alanine 
aminotransferase.  No subject had a maximum post-baseline increase or decrease in shift parameters of 
grade 4 for chemistry parameters. 
Apart from the case of Grade 4 neutropenia, the clinical laboratory values are not remarkable in this 
population of patients with ITP.  
The MAH provided a follow up report on this subject with persistent Grade 4 neutropenia including 
relevant details of any bone marrow evaluations. From the above timeline, it cannot be excluded that 
there may be a relationship between the treatment with romiplostim and exacerbation of the neutropenia 
in this subject. However, based on the totality of the cases and the higher incidence of neutropenia 
observed in the placebo arm vs. romiplostim, a firm conclusion on causality can not be drawn at the 
present time given that in most cases there were alternative explanations.   
Hypersensitivity and/or Angioedema and/or Anaphylactic Reactions (SMQ) 
In the Paediatric Randomized ITP Safety Set the MedDRA preferred terms identified from the SMQ 
searches for hypersensitivity and/or angioedema and/or anaphylactic reactions were reported in 13/59 
(22.0%) romiplostim subjects and 5/24 (20.8%) placebo subjects. 
The most frequently reported (by subject incidence) hypersensitivity and/or angioedema and/or 
anaphylactic reactions adverse events by preferred term were rash (15.3% romiplostim; 8.3% placebo), 
urticaria (5.1% romiplostim; 0.0% placebo), and rhinitis allergic (3.4% romiplostim; 4.2% placebo). 
  11 romiplostim subjects (11/59; 18.6%) and 4 placebo subjects (16.7%) had hypersensitivity 
and/or angioedema and/or anaphylactic reactions events that were grade 1;  
  3 romiplostim subjects (5%) had events that were grade 2;  
  1 placebo subject had events that were grade 3; 
 
none were serious.   
Three romiplostim subjects and no placebo subjects had hypersensitivity and/or angioedema and/or 
anaphylactic reactions events that were considered treatment-related. 
One romiplostim subject had treatment-related adverse events that were grade 1; 2 romiplostim subjects 
had events that were grade 2; none were serious.

In the Paediatric ITP Safety Set the preferred terms identified from the SMQ searches for hypersensitivity 
and/or angioedema and/or anaphylactic reactions were reported in 56/224 (25.0%) romiplostim subjects 
and 5/24 (20.8%) placebo subjects. 
The most frequently reported (by subject incidence) hypersensitivity and/or angioedema and/or 
anaphylactic reactions adverse events by preferred term were rash (11.6% romiplostim; 8.3% placebo), 
hypersensitivity (3.1% romiplostim; 4.2% placebo), and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (3.1% 
romiplostim; 0.0% placebo). 
  45 (20.1%) romiplostim subjects and 4 (16.7%) placebo subjects had hypersensitivity and/or 
angioedema and/or anaphylactic reactions events that were grade 1;  
  13 romiplostim subjects (5.8%) had events that were grade 2;  
  2 romiplostim subjects and 1 placebo subject had events that were grade 3;  
  3 romiplostim subjects had events that were considered serious.   
Eight romiplostim subjects and no placebo subjects had hypersensitivity and/or angioedema and/or 
anaphylactic reactions events that were considered treatment related.   
Six romiplostim subjects had treatment-related adverse events that were grade 1; 3 romiplostim subjects 
had events that were grade 2; none were serious. 
The adverse events reported for the 3 subjects with serious adverse events that were included in the 
hypersensitivity and/or angioedema and/or anaphylactic reactions (SMQ) were all AEs of immune 
thrombocytopenic purpura for which no action was taken with romiplostim. 
The percentages of subjects treated with romiplostim for whom hypersensitivity / anaphylactic reactions 
were reported were similar in the romiplostim group and in the placebo group in both the Paediatric 
Randomized ITP Safety Set and the Paediatric ITP Safety Set. Also the percentages of subjects treated 
with romiplostim for whom hypersensitivity / anaphylactic reactions were reported were similar in the 
romiplostim group in both safety data sets. 
In the Paediatric ITP Safety Set the proportion of subjects with Grade 2 hypersensitivity events was 
higher in the romiplostim group (5.8%) compared to none in the placebo group. 
There were no discontinuations of romiplostim due to hypersensitivity and it does not seem to have been 
a significant TEAE in romiplostim treated patients.  
Immunogenicity 
For the analysis of antibody formation, the ITP Safety Set consists of all paediatric subjects who received 
at least 1 dose of investigational product in an ITP study (20060195, 20080279, 20090340, or 
20101221).  
UPaediatric Randomized ITP Safety Set 
UStudy 20080279 
Subjects in the Safety Analysis Set were tested for the presence (baseline) or development (post-
treatment) of romiplostim (including thrombopoietin-mimetic peptide [TMP]) and TPO antibodies.  
Antibody samples were obtained from subjects on day 1 (prior to investigational product dosing), at week 
12 and end of study (EOS). 
Antibodies to romiplostim  
None of the 41 subjects in the romiplostim treatment arm or the 17 subjects in the placebo arm tested 
had a positive pre-existing antibody to the peptide component of romiplostim (TMP) result at baseline.  Of 
the 42 subjects in the romiplostim arm with a post-baseline antibody result, 2 subjects (5%) developed

binding antibodies to the peptide component of romiplostim (TMP) and TMP and whole romiplostim 
molecule, respectively. No subjects in either treatment arm developed post-dose positive neutralizing 
antibodies to romiplostim. 
No subjects in either treatment arm developed post-dose positive neutralising antibodies to romiplostim. 
Antibodies to TPO 
Similarly, none of the 41 subjects in the romiplostim treatment arm or the 17 subjects in the placebo arm 
tested had a positive pre-existing binding antibody to TPO result at baseline. Of the 42 subjects in the 
romiplostim arm with a post-baseline antibody result, 2 subjects (4%) developed binding antibodies to 
TPO. Of the 19 subjects in the placebo arm with a post-baseline antibody result, 1 subject (5%) 
developed binding antibodies to TPO. No subject in the romiplostim or in the placebo arm developed post-
dose positive neutralising antibodies to TPO.  
UStudy 20060195 
In Study 20060195, 1 of the 17 subjects from the romiplostim-dosed group tested positive for binding 
antibodies to the TMP component of romiplostim at week 13 post-dose No baseline sample was available 
for this subject. The subject was negative for neutralising antibodies to romiplostim in the bioassay. The 
sample drawn from the end-of-study time point from this subject was negative for binding antibodies to 
romiplostim and TMP, indicating a transient antibody response. No clinical sequelae were associated with 
this observation.   
No subject was positive for binding antibodies to TPO. 
UStudy 20090340 
The baseline result could be a pre-existing response or previous positive antibody status from a subject 
rolled over from the previous parent study (Studies 20030213 or 20080279). Seven subjects out of 65 
subjects (7/65; 10.8%) were positive for antibodies to AMG 531 and/or TPO. 
Five of the 7 antibody positive subjects (5/65; 7.7%) were positive for binding antibodies to romiplostim 
at 1 or more time point Two of the subjects that had binding, anti-romiplostim antibodies were transient, 
seroconverting antibody negative at subsequent time point, including one subject that was positive for 
neutralising antibodies at EOS and negative at follow-up; three subjects were positive for binding, non-
neutralising at the last time point tested. 
A girl between 9-11 years old, who had binding antibodies to both romiplostim and TMP, and also 
developed neutralising antibodies to romiplostim at the EOS, experienced 2 serious adverse events 
(depression and suicidal ideation, both conditions that predate the study). This subject was on study for 
50 weeks, had platelet counts that were non evaluable (i.e., subject had used rescue medication within 
previous 4 weeks) from week 36 onwards. Of the evaluable platelet counts, 4 out of 12 measurements 
were ≥ 50 x 10 P
9
P/L. Non evaluable platelet counts were recorded and rescue medications were used in 
many subjects who had not developed neutralizing antibodies, so it is not known whether anti-
romiplostim binding antibodies were responsible for the non-evaluable platelet counts in this case.

The study consisted of a 4-week screening period, up to a 3-year treatment period, and end of study 
(EOS) visit. Antibody samples were obtained from all subjects on day 1 (prior to investigational product 
dosing), week 12, and week 52, every 24 weeks thereafter and at the end of treatment (EOT). Of the 142 
subjects on study at the time of assessment, a total of 9 subjects were antibody positive for AMG 531 
and/or TPO. 
Antibodies to romiplostim 
Seven subjects had a positive binding antibody response against romiplostim at 1 or more time point 
(7/142; 4.9 %); 2 subjects had positive pre-existing binding, non-neutralizing antibody status at or 
before baseline with a positive post-baseline binding antibody status.  
Three of the five subjects positive for binding antibodies were also neutralizing antibody positive against 
romiplostim post baseline (3/142; 2.1%).   There were no adverse events associated with the three 
subjects positive for neutralizing antibodies. 
Antibodies to TPO 
Four of the 142 subjects (4/142; 2.8%) had a positive binding, non-neutralizing antibody response 
against TPO while on-study; 2 subjects (2/142; 1.4%) had pre-existing positive binding antibody status 
at or before baseline. One of these 2 subjects also had a positive post-baseline binding antibody status 
and the other subject had a negative post-baseline binding antibody status (transient). Two subjects were 
binding antibody positive to TPO post-dose (2/142; 1.4%) with negative or no result at baseline and both 
subjects had a negative result at the last time point tested (transient).  
No subject had a positive result for neutralising antibody against TPO at baseline or post baseline. 
UPaediatric ITP Safety Set 
Subjects were tested for the presence (at baseline) or development (post-baseline) of romiplostim 
(including TMP, the peptide component of romiplostim) and TPO antibodies. A total of 224 subjects were 
dosed with romiplostim and 24 were dosed with placebo. Data were available for 207 of 224 romiplostim 
subjects and 24 placebo subjects for detection of binding antibodies to romiplostim and TPO. 
Antibodies to romiplostim 
No placebo subjects had a positive romiplostim peptide antibody response during the study. A total of 
11/207 (5.3%) romiplostim subjects had a positive binding antibody response for romiplostim while on-
study; 2 subjects (1.0%) had positive binding antibody results at baseline (pre-existing) Nine subjects 
(4.7%) had a binding antibody positive result post-baseline, of which 5 were transient (negative at the 
last time point tested) and 4 were persistent (positive at the last time point tested). One (0.5%) 
romiplostim subject had a post-baseline, neutralizing antibody positive result for romiplostim that was 
persistent while on-study. 
Antibodies to TPO 
Eight (3.9%) romiplostim subjects and 1 (4.2%) placebo subject were binding antibody positive for TPO 
at any time during the study. Of those, 2 romiplostim subjects (developed positive binding antibody 
status at or before baseline (pre-existing) (. Six romiplostim subjects and 1 placebo subject had 
developing positive binding antibody to TPO result post-baseline. Of these, 4 romiplostim subjects and 1 
placebo subject had a transient post-baseline result and 2 romiplostim subjects had a persistent post-
baseline result.   
No subjects were neutralizing antibody positive for TPO at any time during the study (Table 25).

Updated Summary of Immunogenicity 
In paediatric studies, the incidence of binding antibodies to romiplostim at any time was 7.8% (22/282). 
Of the 22 subjects, 2 subjects had pre-existing binding non-neutralising romiplostim antibodies at 
baseline. Additionally, 2.5% (7/282) developed neutralising antibodies to romiplostim. A total of 3.2% 
(9/282) subjects had binding antibodies to TPO at any time during romiplostim treatment. Of these 9 
subjects, 2 subjects had pre-existing binding non-neutralising antibodies to TPO. All subjects were 
negative for neutralising activity to TPO.

Immunogenicity in the Post-marketing Setting 
In the post-marketing registry study, 19 confirmed paediatric patients were included. The incidence of 
binding antibody post treatment was 16% (3/19) to romiplostim, of which 5.3% (1/19) were positive for 
neutralising antibodies to romiplostim. There were no antibodies detected to TPO. 184 confirmed adult 
patients were included in this study; for these patients, the incidence of binding antibody post treatment 
was 3.8% (7/184) to romiplostim, of which 0.5% (1/184) was positive for neutralising antibodies to 
romiplostim. A total of 2.2% (4/184) adult patients developed binding, non-neutralising antibody against 
TPO. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Not applicable.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No subjects in the Paediatric Randomized ITP Safety Set had treatment-emergent adverse events leading 
to withdrawal of IP (Investigational product) or study discontinuation.  
In the Paediatric ITP Safety Set, 4 (1.8%) romiplostim subjects had adverse events leading to withdrawal 
of IP:   
-  Headache and vomiting were each reported in 2 subjects as AEs leading to withdrawal of 
investigational product.   
-  Abdominal pain, Anxiety, Asthenia, Dehydration Interstitial lung disease were each reported in 
one subject as AEs leading to withdrawal of investigational product.   
When the treatment-emergent adverse events leading to withdrawal of IP were adjusted for duration, 
adverse events rates (number of adverse events [per 100 subject years]) were reported for romiplostim 
subjects only and included 0.7 for headache and vomiting and 0.3 for abdominal pain, anxiety, asthenia, 
dehydration and interstitial lung disease. 
One (0.4%) romiplostim subject had an adverse event of anxiety leading to study discontinuation. No 
subjects in the placebo group had adverse events leading to withdrawal of IP or discontinuation from 
study. The above adverse events given as reason for discontinuation do not give rise to concern as they 
seem unlikely to be directly related to romiplostim. 
Post marketing experience 
The Post-Marketing Safety Summary for romiplostim (Nplate) covers the reporting period from 31 July 
2008 to 31 July 2016 and summarises safety information from Amgen’s romiplostim Periodic Safety 
Update Reports (PSURs) No. 1 through 9, Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Reports (PBRERs) No. 10, 12, 
14, and 15, and all cumulative post-marketing safety data since the first worldwide approval of this drug 
(International Birth Date [IBD]: 31 July 2008). 
Cumulative paediatric patient exposure worldwide (not including the Kyowa Hakko Kirin region) through 
31 July 2016 amounted to 1165 patient-years. 
UOverall Summary of Post-marketing Events 
Overall, among paediatric patients, the most frequently occurring system organ class (SOCs; ≥ 10%) for 
serious adverse events were consistent with that reported among adult patients and with the safety 
Assessment report

concerns addressed within the risk management plan for romiplostim. Cumulatively, there were 379 
serious adverse events received from all post-marketing sources for paediatric patients (< 18 years old).  
The most common reporting source for paediatric patients was spontaneous sources (309 out of 379 
events).  For serious adverse events reported for paediatric patients from spontaneous sources the SOCs 
that contained ≥ 10% of the total serious adverse events were general disorders and administration site 
conditions (n = 84 serious adverse events), investigations (n = 50 serious adverse events), and blood 
and lymphatic system disorders (n = 38 serious adverse events).  The majority of serious adverse events 
reported for paediatric patients occurred in those between the ages of 12 years and less than 18 years 
old. 
Among the total 379 serious adverse events received for paediatric patients, there were 15 events (10 
cases) reported with a fatal outcome.  Individual review of the serious adverse events in all the paediatric 
patients did not reveal any new safety signals for romiplostim. 
USummary of Fatal Adverse Events in Paediatric Patients 
This summary is from the above mentioned Post-Marketing Safety Summary up to 31 July 2016:  
Among the 379 serious adverse events received for paediatric patients, there were 15 events (10 cases) 
reported with a fatal outcome. The majority of fatal events were received from spontaneous sources; 2 
events were reported from non-Amgen sponsored noninterventional postmarketing studies.  
Reported serious adverse events with fatal outcomes (some with limited information) included the 
following PTs: 2 events each of death, graft versus host disease, and hemorrhage intracranial, and 1 
event each of bone marrow necrosis, cerebral hemorrhage, Evans syndrome, hemolytic anemia, 
pneumonia pseudomonal, renal failure, sepsis, soft tissue infection, and thrombocytopenia. Patient ages 
ranged from 1 year to 15 years (2 cases of age unknown). Doses ranged from 100 to 125 μg, as well 5 to 
12 μg/kg (5 cases of dose unknown). Time to event onset, provided for 2 events, was 33 and 79 days for 
the 2 events (hemorrhage intracranial and cerebral hemorrhage, respectively). Out of the 15 events, the 
reported causality assessment was “Not related” for 7 events, “Not Provided” for 7 events, and “Related” 
to romiplostim by the reporter in a single case (PT of death).  
Most of these patients had severe disorders with thrombocytopenia for which Nplate had been given off 
label as they did not have ITP and the fatal events in these cases seem very unlikely to have been due to 
romiplostim. Nevertheless, it is of note that in 2 patients (case 2 and case 6 (who may have had a bone 
marrow disease considering the marked bone marrow reticulin fibrosis and splenomegaly)), cerebral 
haemorrhage / intracranial haemorrhage occurred some days after stopping romiplostim.

Please be referred to the separate Immunogenicity Section in this Assessment Report. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
TSafety  data  for  romiplostim  in  paediatric  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  ITP  at  least  6  months  prior  to 
screening/enrollment come from 2 randomised double blind placebo controlled studies (Studies 20060195 
and  20080279)  in  children  aged  from  1  to  <18  years,  two  open  label  extension  (OLE)  studies  in  which 
patients from these studies could be included (Studies 20030213 and 20090340) and from another open 
label study (Study 20101221) in subjects aged (≥  1 year and < 18 years). Studies 20060195, 20030213, 
20080279 are completed and Studies 20090340 and 20101221 are ongoing.  
TThese studies provide safety data from 224 patients treated with romiplostim which includes 20 of the 24

placebo treated patients who went on to receive romiplostim in the OLE studies. Considering that Nplate 
is  an  orphan  medicinal  product,  224  patients  is  an  acceptable  number  for  obtaining  safety  data  in 
paediatric patients with persistent or chronic ITP, also considering that romiplostim has been authorised 
in  the  EU  since  2008  for  adults  with  chronic  ITP.  The  randomised  studies  provide  useful  comparative 
safety for romiplostim vs. placebo and in both groups other ITP treatments were also allowed reflecting a 
real  life  situation.  Approximately  40%  of  the  224  romiplostim  treated  patients  used  concurrent  ITP 
treatment at any time with a trend towards a reduction in concomitant medication use over time (Efficacy 
assessment of this AR). 
UPatients investigated 
TRomiplostim  was  investigated  in  children  aged  from  1  to  <18  years,  with  age  distribution  of  patients 
exposed to romiplostim as follows in the Paediatric ITP Safety Set:  ≥  1 - < 6 years (N = 47 (23%));  ≥  
6 - < 12 years (N = 89 (43%));  ≥  12 - < 18 years (N = 68 (34%)) and there was also a similar age 
distribution  in  each  study.  These  age  categories  are  in  line  with  the  recommendation  in  the  above 
mentioned  CHMP  ITP  guideline.  In  the  Paediatric  ITP  Safety  Set,  the  median  number  of  years  since  ITP 
diagnosis  was  2.0  (Q1,  Q3:  1.04,  4.15  years;  Min  0.5  years,  Max  14.0  years).  The  relevant  inclusion 
criterion  for  paediatric  patients  in  the  studies  submitted  was  ITP  diagnosed  at  least  6  months  before 
enrollment  (ASH  guidelines)  which  is  less  strict  than  that  of  the  International  working  Group 
recommendations  (Rodegheiro  et  al,  2009)  that  define  chronic  ITP  as  lasting  more  than  12  months. 
However, in view of the fact that the Q1 for years since ITP diagnosis was 1 year and also that subjects 
from  age  ≥ 1  year  were  eligible  for  inclusion  in  the  studies,  the  data  submitted  can  be  considered  as 
being sufficiently relevant to the claimed indication in paediatric chronic ITP.  
UDosage of romiplostim 
TThe  mean  and  median  average  weekly  doses  of  romiplostim  in  the  Paediatric  ITP  Safety  Set  were 
approximately 5 to 6 μg/kg and fell within the currently approved maximum weekly dose of 10 μg/kg. In 
most patients the maximum dose received did not exceed 10 μg/kg but a maximum dose of 12 μg/kg and 
14  μg/kg  were  also  reported.  The  proposed  posology  in  the  paediatric  population  is  the  same  as  that 
approved  for  adults  thus  safety  data  in  the  paediatric  population  studied  are  relevant  to treatment  with 
romiplostim according to the intended posology.  
UDuration of treatment with romiplostim 
TThe  safety  data  in  terms  of  years  of  exposure  of  more  than  1.5  to  2  years  are  still  quite  limited 
considering  that  treatment  may  last  for  an  indefinite  number  of  years.  The  MAH  provided  an  updated 
dataset  in  which  40/282  subjects  (13.8%)  had  a  treatment  duration  of  >144  weeks,  compared  to  the 
previous  data-cut  in  which  approximately  11%  had  an  exposure  duration  longer  than  144  weeks, 
unfortunately  the  increase  is  number  of  patients  was  still  limited.  Addition  of  final  data  from  Study 
20090340  and  study  20101221  resulted  in  an  update  with  a  longer  mean  duration  of  treatment  65.5 
weeks compared with 84.7 weeks. In study 20101221 all subjects had treatment duration of <144 weeks 
at  the  data-cut.  The  safety  update  showed  an  increased  reporting  of  TEAE  (88.8%  versus  93.3%).  The 
TEAE  with  the  highest  incidence  by  preferred  term  remained  unchanged  even  when  corrected  for 
duration. Moreover, similar TEAEs were reported in subjects with duration of >144 weeks or <144 weeks. 
Although  the  update  of  efficacy  and  safety  data  was  minimal  with  a  small  increase  in  patients  with 
exposure >144 weeks, no apparent differences in efficacy and safety analysis are observed with a longer 
treatment  duration  and  the  results  are  in  line  with  that  previously  observed.  Final  results  on  study 
20101221 is expected. 
UAdverse events 
TOverall, in the Paediatric ITP Safety Set, the percentage of patients experiencing TEAEs was similar in the 
romiplostim  (89%)  and  placebo  treated  subjects  (100%).  The  TEAEs  reported  consisted  of  both  more 
general AEs and of AEs which may be more specific to a population of ITP patients undergoing treatment.

TThe  most  common  adverse  reactions  in  paediatric  ITP  patients  1  year  and  older  were  upper  respiratory 
tract  infection  (30.5%  romiplostim;  25.0%  placebo),  rhinitis,  cough,  oropharyngeal  pain,  upper 
abdominal pain, diarrhoea, rash, pyrexia, contusion (reported very commonly (≥  1/10)), and pharyngitis, 
conjunctivitis, ear infection, gastroenteritis, sinusitis, purpura, urticaria and peripheral swelling (reported 
commonly (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10)). 
TOropharyngeal pain, upper abdominal pain, rhinitis, pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, ear infection, sinusitis and 
peripheral  swelling  were  additional  adverse  reactions  observed  in  paediatric  studies  compared  to  those 
seen  in  adult  studies  (section  4.8  of  the  SmPC).  Some  of  the  adverse  reactions  seen  in  adults  were 
reported  more  frequently  in  paediatric  subjects  such  as  cough,  diarrhoea,  rash,  pyrexia  and  contusion 
reported  very  commonly  (≥   1/10)  in  paediatric  subjects  and  purpura  and  urticaria  were  reported 
commonly (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) in paediatric subjects (section 4.8 of the SmPC).4
T  
THowever, it is noticeable that the frequency of haemorrhagic AEs fits into the range of “common” in the 
paediatric population whereas in the adult population, apart from ecchymosis, any haemorrhagic AEs are 
mentioned with a frequency “uncommon” in the table in SmPC Section 4.8. 
TThe  most  frequent  AEs  in subjects  in  the  Paediatric ITP  Safety  Set  were  headache  (40.2%  romiplostim; 
54.2%  placebo),  epistaxis  (34.8%  romiplostim;  45.8%  placebo),  contusion  (26.8%  romiplostim;  33.3% 
placebo), and cough (26.3% romiplostim; 12.5% placebo). These frequencies were very similar to those 
in  the  Paediatric  Randomized  ITP  Safety  Set  in  which  overall  across  studies,  the  treatment-emergent 
adverse  events  with  the  highest  subject  incidence  were  epistaxis  (44.1%  romiplostim;  45.8%  placebo), 
contusion  (40.7%  romiplostim;  33.3%  placebo),  headache  (40.7%  romiplostim;  54.2%  placebo),  and 
upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (30.5%  romiplostim;  25.0%  placebo).  Hemorrhage  was  reported 
frequently  as  an  AE.  Adverse  events  falling  under  the  MedDRA  preferred  terms  identified  from  the  SMQ 
searches  for  haemorrhage  were  reported  in  143/224  (63.8%)  romiplostim  subjects  and  15/24  (62.5%) 
placebo subjects. Also of note is that pyrexia was reported more often in the romiplostim group (~24.1% 
vs ~8.3% in the placebo group) in both the Randomised Paediatric ITP Safety Set and the Paediatric ITP 
Safety Set which may be associated with the corresponding frequencies of nasopharyngitis although the 
rate  of  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  was  the  same  in  both  the  romiplostim  and  placebo  treatment 
groups  at  approximately  25%.  However,  in  the  Randomised  ITP  Paediatric  Safety  Set  pyrexia  was 
considered  to  be  treatment  related  in  a  similar  proportion  of  patients  in  each  treatment  group  (3.4% 
romiplostim  vs  4.2%  placebo.  It  is  not  clear  why  there  is  such  a  difference  in  subject  incidence  of  the 
TEAE pyrexia between the romiplostim and placebo groups whereas the incidence of pyrexia as treatment 
related TEAE was almost the same in both groups. Updated data showed an increased number of subjects 
in  the  romiplostim  arm  of  the  study  experienced  an  event  of  pyrexia  (31.6%  romiplostim  versus  8.3% 
placebo-updated  data),  when  corrected  for  the  duration  of  exposure  the  increase  in  pyrexia  in  the 
romiplostim  treated  patients  remains  present  (19.8  per  100  subject  years  for  placebo  versus  42,3  per 
100 subject years for romiplostim). The majority of the events was a grade 1-2 and was resolved within a 
median duration of 2 days. As noted by the MAH there was an increase in the reporting of pyrexia in the 
younger age groups, an increase in pyrexia is more likely in younger patients (as supported by the CPRD 
analysis).  Four  patients  experienced  a  serious  event  of  pyrexia  (0.9%),  the  MAH  provided  short  case 
summaries and in all subjects the pyrexia resolved within 2 days of hospitalisation and was not related to 
a  positive  post-baseline  result  for  TPO  or  romiplostim.  Additionally,  a  number  of  patients  had  positive 
antibodies  while  experiencing  pyrexia  but  an  association  between  the  occurrence  of  positive  antibody 
findings  and  pyrexia  is  not  likely.  The  MAH  has  listed  pyrexia  in  SmPC  section  4.8  as  a  common  AE, 
however  this  is  not  a  new  ADR.  The  frequency  of  injection  site  pain  was  fairly  similar  in  both  the 
romiplostim  group  (5.8%)  and  the  placebo  group  (4.2%)  suggesting  that  the  romiplostim  injections  do 
not pose a major tolerability problem. Lastly, iron deficiency anaemia was more frequent in the placebo 
group  (8.3%  vs  1.8%  in  the  romiplostim  arm)  which  could  be  indicative  of  an  increased  bleeding 
tendency but the actual numbers of placebo patients for which it was reported is small at 2 patients.

TThe  extent  of  serious  or  higher  grade  reported  AEs  in  patients treated  with  romiplostim,  seems  to  have 
been  limited.  There  were  no  deaths  during  the  clinical  studies  and  it  is  reassuring  that  there  were  very 
few  discontinuations  due  to  adverse  events  with  only  4  (1.8%)  romiplostim  subjects  having  adverse 
events which led to withdrawal.  
UAdverse events of special interest 
TBleeding events: 
TA  high  subject  incidence  of  haemorrhagic  AEs  was  seen  in  the  romiplostim  group  in  the  Randomized 
Paediatric ITP Set, where it was not less than in the placebo group, and also in the romiplostim group in 
the  Paediatric  ITP  Set  (approximately  60%).  The  subject  incidence  of  haemorrhage  AEs  was  higher  in 
weeks 1 to ≤ 12 at 50.9% and thereafter it ranged approximately between 35% and 44% in the periods 
up to >144 to ≤ 168 weeks. From then on, numbers of patients are too small to allow conclusions to be 
made.  A  similar  pattern  was  seen  in  the  first  24  weeks  in  the  Paediatric  Randomized  ITP  Safety  Set  in 
which the frequency was 74.6% in weeks 1 to ≤ 12 and 48.3% in weeks 13 to ≤ 24. It seems likely that 
the  higher  rate  of  haemorrhage  in  the  first  12  weeks  of  a  study  is  due  to  the  delay  before  patients’ 
platelet count responds to romiplostim. The median  time to First Platelet Response in the Paediatric ITP 
Efficacy Set was 6 weeks which would be in keeping with this. 
TThe incidence of haemorrhage events in the Paediatric ITP Set is quite similar in all three age categories 
in patients treated with romiplostim, varying from approximately 58% to 68%. The numbers of patients 
per age category in the placebo group are too small to allow comparison per age category. Although the 
subject incidence of haemorrhage adverse events in the Paediatric ITP Set was high, with overall 63.8% 
in romiplostim treated patients, the incidence of severe bleeds was low with a subject incidence of 20% 
Grade ≥ 2, 7.6% Grade ≥ 3 and none Grade ≥ 4.  
TThe  MAH  also  analysed  the  incidence  of  haemorrhage  events  according  to  various  other  subject 
categories including sex, race, time since ITP diagnosis, baseline bleeding status, prior splenectomy, prior 
ITP therapies, baseline haemoglobin value and region. There were no major differences in the incidence 
of  haemorrhage  events  between  the  subgroups  within  each  of  the  categories,  notably  for  example  in 
patients who had a baseline bleeding status of “yes” or “no”, patients with or without prior splenectomy 
(although only 12 romiplostim patients had prior splenectomy), patients with <3 prior ITP treatments  or  
≥ 3 prior ITP treatments. 
TThrombocytosis 
TThrombocytosis was reported infrequently as an adverse event with romiplostim both in in the Paediatric 
Randomized  ITP  Safety  Set  (2/59  patients  (3.4%))  and  in  the  Paediatric  ITP  Safety  Set  (2/224  (0.9%) 
patients,  the  same 2  patients)  and  no  cases  in  the  placebo  group.  The  large  majority of  platelet  counts 
did not fall within a range which is usually considered in itself to pose a risk of thrombosis. The possibility 
of  high  platelet  counts  and  risk  of  thromboembolic  events  are  adequately  covered  in  section  4.8  of  the 
SmPC and it is not considered necessary to add further information on thrombocytosis in the SmPC.  
TThrombotic/Thromboembolic Events 
TMedDRA  preferred  terms  searches  for  thrombotic/thromboembolic  events  identified  the  preferred  term 
deep  vein  thrombosis  (grade  2)  in  one  (0.4%)  romiplostim  subject  in  the  Paediatric  ITP  Safety  Set  and 
none  in  the  placebo  group.  However,  it  turned  that  this  patient  had  clinical  signs  of  phlebitis  and  the 
Doppler ultrasound did not show a thrombus. 
TIn the paediatric post-marketing setting 7 cases were identified, with 7 events, all of which were serious.  
There were no fatal events. The preferred terms for these 7 events were: pulmonary embolism (n = 2), 
and  single  events  of  transient  ischaemic  attack,  transverse  sinus  thrombosis,  jugular  vein  thrombosis, 
disseminated  intravascular  coagulation,  and  cerebral  thrombosis.  These  reports  of  7  thrombotic  events,

which  appear  to  have  been  very  serious,  are  of  concern  and  highlight  the  thrombotic  potential  of  TPO 
agonists and the necessity of continuing vigilance. 
TIncreased bone marrow reticulin 
TIn an ongoing paediatric clinical trial, of the subjects with an evaluable on-study bone marrow biopsy, 5 
out  of  27  subjects  (18.5%)  developed  increased  reticulin  in  cohort  1  and  2  out  of  4  subjects  (50.0%) 
developed  increased  reticulin  in  cohort  2.  However,  no  subject  showed  any  bone  marrow  abnormalities 
that were inconsistent with an underlying diagnosis of ITP at baseline or on-treatment. 
TThe interim results of Study 20101221 showed that 7/31 (22.5%) of subjects (5/27 after 1 year exposure 
and  2/4  after  2  years  exposure)  had  a  low/mild  degree  of  reticulin  (thus  no  mature  collagen).  The 
frequencies of increase in bone marrow reticulin in this study are difficult to compare with the findings in 
the  adult  study  20080009  (0/34  subjects  after  one year  exposure,  2/39  after  2  years)  due to  the  small 
numbers.  Unfortunately  there  were  no  follow-up  biopsies  to  provide  information  on  reversibility  of 
reticulin  formation  in  paediatric  patients  and  there  is  very  little  data  about  reversibility  in  adults. 
Furthermore,  results  from  adult  Study  20080009  are  suggestive  that  the  incidence  of  increase  in  bone 
marrow  reticulin  rises  with  increasing  duration  of  exposure  to  romiplostim.  So  far  it  is  not  known  if  the 
increases of bone marrow reticulin may have clinical consequences or if the incidence of the more severe 
collagen fibrosis may increase with durations of exposure >1 year.  
TData  on  reversibility  of  abnormal  bone  marrow  findings  are  considered  essential  but  it  is  not  clear  from 
protocol 20101221 if provision has been made to obtain post treatment bone marrow biopsies to evaluate 
reversibility of findings of increases of reticulin or collagen formation. The MAH confirmed that provision is 
made  to  obtain  post  treatment  bone  marrow  biopsies  from  subjects  in  Study  20101221  to  evaluate 
reversibility  of  findings  of  increases  of  reticulin  or  collagen  formation.  The  MAH  has  confirmed  that  the 
results  of  Study  20101221  will  be  submitted.  Section  4.8.of  the  SmPC  with  regards  to  bone  marrow 
reticulin has been updated with pediatric data.  
TImmunogenicity  
TBinding  antibodies  were  measured  in  4.7%  (N=9)  subjects  in  the  Paediatric  Safety  Set,  persistent  in  4 
patients and one patient had a post-baseline neutralising antibody positive result for romiplostim that was 
persistent  while  on-study.  In  the  post  marketing  registry  (Study  20080091)  one  paediatric  patient  and 
one  adult  patient  tested  positive  for  neutralising  antibodies  to  Nplate,  and  for  both  of  these  reduced 
efficacy was reported. In the Paediatric Safety Set, binding antibodies to TPO were measured in 3.2 % of 
subjects  (n=6),  transient  in  4  subjects  and  persistent  in  2  subjects  and  no  patients  had  a  neutralising 
antibody to TPO. In the post marketing registry no patients had a neutralising antibody to TPO. Although 
the  occurrence  of  antibodies  to  romiplostim,  to  the  peptide  component  of  romiplostim  and  to  TPO  has 
been described, it is difficult to get a clear picture per patient of which antibodies they had and whether 
or  not  there  were  clinical  consequences.  It  was  not  clear  if  the  occurrence  of  antibodies  to  romiplostim 
might be associated with the occurrence of antibodies to TPO. 
TIn the updated Pediatric ITP Safety Set, the incidence of binding antibodies to romiplostim was 7.8% (22 
of 282) overall and 0.7% were considered pre-existing. Of the 20 post-baseline results, 11 (3.9%) were 
considered  persistent.  Seven  subjects  (2.5%)  developed  neutralising  antibodies  to  romiplostim;  5  of  7 
subjects  had  results  that  were  considered  persistent.  A  total  of  3.2%  (9  of  282)  subjects  had  binding 
antibodies  to  TPO  at  any  time  during  romiplostim  treatment;  1  subject  had  binding  antibodies  to  TPO 
considered  persistent  and  all  subjects  were  negative  for  neutralising  activity  to  TPO.  1  subject  in  Study 
20101221 had a persistent, neutralising antibody result for romiplostim at week 52 and week 100 and a 
transient, non-neutralising positive antibody result for TPO at week 52.

TMost subjects who had binding antibodies to romiplostim or TPO had a positive binding antibody result at 
a single visit, 13 of 20 and 4 of 9, respectively. Five subjects had binding antibodies to romiplostim at a 
single time point considered persistent because the result occurred at the final assessment. 
TBinding and neutralising antibodies to romiplostim and binding antibodies to TPO have been observed in 
children. In some cases adverse bleeding events were preceding or at the same time as positive antibody 
results.  Therefore  an  association  between  the  presence  of  antibodies  and  bleeding  events  cannot  be 
excluded. The SmPC mentions the possible loss of response in section 4.2 of the SmPC and the possible 
immunogenicity in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. This adequately covers the possible risk associated 
with the presence of binding or neutralising antibodies.   
THematological Malignancies  
TNo  MedDRA  preferred  terms  searches  for  hematologic  malignancies  or  myelodysplastic  syndrome 
treatment-emergent  events  were  reported  in  the  Paediatric  ITP  Safety  Set.  It  is  not  clear  if  the  search 
using preferred terms for hematologic malignancies or myelodysplastic syndrome would identify cases of 
abnormal presence of blast cells in peripheral blood. However, in the paediatric clinical studies in ITP, in 
studies  20080279  and  20060195  in  the  differential  counts  in  peripheral  blood,  myeloblasts  were 
specifically counted for but none were found. In study 20090340 there is no mention of blast cells in the 
study report. In the bone marrow examinations in study 20101221, no subject showed any bone marrow 
abnormalities that were not consistent with an underlying diagnosis of ITP at baseline or on-treatment. 
TThus from the available data it can be concluded that there is no evidence so far of an increase in blast 
cells or suggestion of haematological malignancy in paediatric patients treated with romiplopstim. 
THypersensitivity  
TThere were no discontinuations of romiplostim due to hypersensitivity and it does not seem to have been 
a significant TEAE in romiplostim treated patients. Hypersensitivity is mentioned with a frequency of “very 
common” in section 4.8 of the SmPC which is in line with findings in the paediatric patients investigated. 
TDosing / Administration Errors  
TThere  are  complicated  instructions  and  calculations  for  reconstituting  and  diluting  romiplostim  before 
administration.  Dose  (re-)  calculation,  the  reconstitution  step,  administration  of  small  amounts  to  the 
patients, as well as the optional additional dilution step are considered important risk factors contributing 
to  medication  errors  for  all  presentations  of  Nplate.  This,  combined  with  very  small  amounts  to  be 
administered, may present a problem. Several presentations of Nplate exist, but not all of these contain 
the WFI and devices for reconstitution and administration. 
TThere  have  been  no  reported  cases  involving  an  event  from  the  medication  error  SMQ  with  an  adult 
subject  in  the  clinical  trial  setting  and  one  case  (0.4%,  95%  CI:    0.0,  2.5)  involving  a  medication  error 
(non-serious)  with  a  paediatric  subject  in  the  clinical  trial  setting.  In  the  paediatric  post-marketing 
setting,  the  search  for  medication  error  (SMQ)  returned  15  post-marketing  cases  (with  19  events,  2  of 
which were serious [accidental overdose and overdose], but not fatal) from 478 paediatric patient-years 
exposed to romiplostim. 
TThere  are  educational  materials  for  Nplate  with  key  elements  which  include  the  provision  of  a  dosing 
calculator  to  simplify  the  calculation  of  the  correct  dose  and  assist  in  correct  reconstitution  and 
administration.  In  addition,  as  risk  minimisation  measure  Nplate  cannot  be  used  in  a  home  treatment 
setting for the paedatric population.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
TOverall,  the  safety  profile  of  Nplate  in  the  paediatric  population  appears  similar  to  that  described  in 
adults.  
TOropharyngeal pain, upper abdominal pain, rhinitis, pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, ear infection, sinusitis and 
peripheral  swelling  were  additional  adverse  reactions  observed  in  paediatric  studies  compared  to  those 
seen  in  adult  studies  (section  4.8  of  the  SmPC).  Some  of  the  adverse  reactions  seen  in  adults  were 
reported  more  frequently  in  paediatric  subjects  such  as  cough,  diarrhoea,  rash,  pyrexia  and  contusion 
reported  very  commonly  (≥   1/10)  in  paediatric  subjects  and  purpura  and  urticaria  were  reported 
commonly (≥  1/100 to < 1/10) in paediatric subjects (section 4.8 of the SmPC).  
TThe AEs experienced in the paediatric population in the clinical studies seem to have been almost all not 
serious  and  well  tolerated.  Adverse  events  of  special  interest  are  considered  to  remain  antibody 
formation,  bone  marrow  fibrosis,  thrombocytosis  and  thrombo-embolic  events.  Also,  the  risk  of 
haemorrhage  remains  during  romiplostim  treatment  and  especially  within  the  first  days  after  stopping 
treatment with romiplostim. 
TDosing  and  administration  errors  due  to  complicated  reconstitution  and  dilution  instructions  and 
calculations are considered a source of dosing errors. An update of the educational materials with the new 
presentation  has  been  done  and  Nplate  can  not  be  used  in  a  home  treatment  setting  for  the  paediatric 
population to minimise this risk. 
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
TImmune  (idiopathic)  thrombocytopenia  (ITP)  is  an  autoimmune  disorder  characterised  by  a  low 
circulating  platelet  count  (thrombocytopenia),  decreased  platelet  production  and  increased  platelet 
destruction.  Thrombocytopenia  places  patients  at  risks  for  bruising,  mucocutaneous  bleeding  and  more 
seriously  intracranial  hemorrhage.  Although  its  basic  pathophysiology  has  been  elucidated,  no  clinically 
apparent cause has been established for ITP. 
TIn the US and EU, paediatric ITP (acute and chronic) occurs at an overall incidence rate of between 4.0 
and  5.3  cases  per  100,000  per  year  in  otherwise  healthy  children  <  15  years  of  age,  with  a  peak 
incidence between ages 2 and 10 and affecting boys and girls equally. Prevalence of pediatric ITP is 7.2 
cases  per  100,000  per  year.  Unlike  adult  ITP  in  which  the  majority  of  cases  are  chronic  in  duration, 
9
pediatric ITP most commonly occurs in the acute form (platelet count < 150 x 10P
P/L for < 6 months from 
diagnosis),  accounting  for  70  to  80%  of  ITP  cases  in  children.  Many  children  with  acute  ITP  require  no 
treatment  and  in  approximately  60%  to  75%  of  cases,  the  thrombocytopenia  resolves  within  2  to  4 
months  regardless  of  therapy.  Twenty  to  30%  of  paediatric  ITP  cases  are  considered  chronic  (platelet 
9
count < 150 x 10P
P/L for > 6 months from diagnosis) and may become refractory to standard treatments. 
Chronic ITP in childhood has an estimated incidence of 0.46 per 100,000 children per year. Predictors for 
chronicity  among  children  include  older  age  (>  10  years)  and  an  insidious  presentation.  In  addition, 
chronic  ITP  in  children  is  also  associated  with  higher  presenting  platelet  count  (>  20  000/μL),  lack  of 
mucosal bleeding at presentation and lack of a previous acute illness. 
TThe  risk  of  intracranial  hemorrhage  is  <  0.5%  and  increases  with  age;  this  risk  is  proportional  to  the 
9
severity  (<  10  x  10P
P/L)  and  duration  of  severe  thrombocytopenia.  One  review  of  332  medical  records 
revealed  that  17%  of  children  had  major  haemorrhage  defined  as  intracranial  bleeding,  epistaxis 
requiring cautery or nasal packing, gross haematuria, or other bleeding causing a decline in haemoglobin 
concentration.  Approximately  75%  of  bleeding  episodes  in  this  review  occurred  in  children  with  platelet 
counts < 10 x 10P
9
P/L. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
TThe  most  commonly  used  therapeutic  agents  for  pediatric  ITP  include  corticosteroids,  intravenous 
immunoglobulin  and  anti-D  immunoglobulin.  Repeated  treatments  may  postpone  the  need  for 
splenectomy, but the responses are generally transient, lasting a median time of 5 weeks. The principal 
aim  of  treating  children  with  chronic  ITP  is  to  maintain  a  haemostatically  safe  platelet  count  (>  50  x 
9
10P
P/L) and thus improve quality of life of the patient, instead of trying to normalise platelet counts. While 
these  therapies  have  been  shown  to  result  in  increased  platelet  counts,  the  potential  toxicity  of  these

agents  compels  physicians  to  weigh  the  likelihood  of  clinical  efficacy  against  the  likelihood  of  the 
occurrence of clinically relevant adverse events. 
TThe  American  Society of Haematology  (ASH)  guidelines  incorporate  both  clinical  and  platelet  count  data 
to arrive at specific treatment recommendations; for instance, children either with platelet counts < 20 x 
9
10P
9
P/L and significant mucous membrane bleeding or with platelet counts < 10 x 10P
P/L and minor purpura 
should  be  treated  with  specific  regimens  of  immunoglobulin  (IVIg)  or  glucocorticoids.  When  ITP 
symptoms  persist  after  primary  treatment  (glucocorticoid,  IVIg)  and  splenectomy,  further  treatment  is 
indicated in children with platelet counts < 30 x 10P
9
P/L and who have active bleeding. 
TThe BCSH guidelines (2003) recommend that splenectomy is rarely indicated in childhood, given that the 
risk of dying from ITP in childhood is extremely low (less than 1 in 500), and that the mortality associated 
with splenectomy is 1.4 to 2.7%. Moreover, splenectomy is not warranted in younger patients who are at 
relatively high risk for infection with encapsulated organisms. 
TThe  management  of  children  with  ITP  who  either  fail  to  respond  after  splenectomy  or  relapse  following 
splenectomy  is  often  challenging.  Rituximab  has  been  used  in  children  with  severe  chronic  ITP  who  are 
refractory  to  standard  agents,  and  treatment  with  4  weekly  doses  of  375  mg/m2  resulted  in  response 
rates  ranging  from  31  to  68%.  However,  rituximab  carries  warnings  with  regards  to  infusion  reactions, 
severe  mucocutaneous  reactions,  and  progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy,  and  5  to  10%  of 
children  with  ITP  may  develop  serum  sickness.  In  addition,  hepatitis  B  virus  reactivation  with  fulminant 
hepatitis,  hepatic  failure,  and  death  can  occur  in  patients  with  haematologic  malignancies  treated  with 
rituximab. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
TIn the pivotal study, the primary objective  of durable platelet response  was statistically significant (p = 
0.0018), a total of 52% (22 subjects) had a durable platelet response in the romiplostim arm compared 
to 10% (2 subjects) in the placebo arm. The  Mantel-Haenszel  common  odds ratio for  achieving  durable 
platelet  response  was  estimated  to  be  9.1  (romiplostim  vs  placebo,  95%  CI:  1.9,  43.2).  Consistent 
results were observed among the different cohorts of patient, resulting romiplostim vs placebo: ≥ 1 to<6 
years 38% vs 25%; > 6 to <12 years 56% vs 11%; > 12 to <18 years 56% vs 0.  
TIn  the  pivotal  study,  the  efficacy  was  supported  in  the  secondary  and  supportive  endpoints  of  overall 
platelet  response  (p  =  0.0002);  30  subjects  (71%)  in  the  romiplostim  arm  compared  with  4  of  20 
subjects (20%) in the placebo arm; as well as the number of weeks with platelet response (p = 0.0004); 
the median (minimum; maximum)  12 weeks (0; 24)  in the romiplostim  arm and 1  week  (0; 22) in the 
placebo arm.   
TThe  efficacy  in  terms  of  platelet  counts  increments  has  been  demonstrated  at  short  and  long  term.  In 
long-term  safety  Study  20090340,  paediatric  subjects  (n  =  65)  receiving  romiplostim  for100.0  weeks 
(median  exposure  time;  range  5  to  321  weeks)  maintained  platelet  responses  in  the  absence  of  rescue 
medication  in  93.8%  of  subjects.  Across  all  subjects,  the  median  number  of  months  with  platelet 
response  was  20.0  months  (range:  0  to  80  months)  and  the  median  time  on  study  was  25.0  months 
(range: 2 to 80 months). The median percentage of months with a platelet response was 95,4% (range 
0-100).  In  the  integrated  analysis,  the  subject  incidence  of  platelet  response  showed  a  trend  toward 
increasing over time (25.7% at month 1 to >70% from month 7 through month 111). 
TThe integrated analysis over 5 studies revealed a total of 188 of 224 subjects (83.9%; 95% CI: 78.5%, 
88.5%)  had  platelet  response,  There  was  no  comparator  arm.  A  total  of  129  of  224  subjects  (57.6%;

95% CI: 50.8%, 64.1%) had sustained platelet response, The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the time to first 
sustained platelet response  (50th percentile), was 20.0 weeks (95% CI: 15.0, 26.0). For the integrated 
analyses, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the time to first response (50st percentile) was similar across age 
groups. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
TThe  starting  doses  and  the  dose  adjustment  proposed  are  based  on  body  weight.  When  the  calculated 
volume  is  less  than  0.05  mL,  dilution  1:2  or  dilution  1:4  are  proposed  to  ensure  an  appropriate 
dispensable dose, a situation  foreseen for subjects < 50Kg body weight. This is a matter of concern due 
to the added complexity in the preparation of the medication and thus, the risk for contamination and for 
medication errors. Hence, the educational materials were updated. In addition, the MAH is recommended 
to develop a reconstitution and dilution kit for the preparation and administration of paediatric doses by a 
qualified health care professional. 
TIn the pivotal study the results of platelet response by baseline age group are in favour of romiplostim, 
however in the group of >1-<6 years the data are less prominent being the rate of responders 37.5% of 
the  patients  in  romiplostim  arm.  Further,  the  high  use  of  rescue  medication  in  this  group,  substantially 
higher in romiplostin vs. placebo, questions the consistency of efficacy results in this group. However, the 
very low number of patients in the lowest age category precludes drawing firm conclusions on the actual 
efficacy and/or safety results in this population. At the same time, this subset of patient might represent 
a  more  severe  form  of  the  disease,  which  further  complicates  reaching  conclusions.  Nevertheless,  data 
indicated  that  some  of  these  patients  can  benefit  from  treatment  with  romiplostin  in  a  setting  where 
options  available  are  limited.  Thus,  no  additional  age  restrictions  are  deemed  appropriate  and  relevant 
information for the different age categories are reflected in the SmPC.  
TFinal  results  of  study  20101221  are  pending  as  data  on  only  a  limited  number  of  subjects  are  present 
after>3 years of treatment (year 3 n=44 towards year 9, n=5). As such the long-term efficacy in children 
has not been clearly demonstrated. Loss of efficacy is possible for example due to antibody formation or 
the  development  of  bone  marrow  fibrosis.  Additional  data  from  Study  20090340  and  study  20101221 
resulted in an update with a longer mean duration of treatment 65.5 weeks compared with 84.7 weeks. 
In  study  20101221  all  subjects  had  treatment  duration  of  <144  weeks  at  the  data-cut.  Although  the 
update  of  efficacy  and  safety  data  was  minimal  with  a  small  increase  in  patients  with  exposure  >144 
weeks, no apparent differences in efficacy analysis are observed with a longer treatment duration and the 
results  are  in  line  with  that  previously  observed.  Final  results  on  study  20101221  are  expected  as 
reflected in the RMP. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
TThe  most  frequent  AEs  in subjects  in  the  Paediatric ITP  Safety  Set  were  headache  (40.2%  romiplostim; 
54.2%  placebo),  epistaxis  (34.8%  romiplostim;  45.8%  placebo),  contusion  (26.8%  romiplostim;  33.3% 
placebo), and cough (26.3% romiplostim; 12.5% placebo). 
TMost  subjects  (88.8%  romiplostim,  100%  placebo)  reported  1  or  more  TEAE,  most  of  which  were  mild 
(grade 1) or moderate (grade 2) in severity. More subjects receiving romiplostim (18.3%) compared with 
placebo (4.2%) had serious adverse events. In general, there were no major differences in the frequency 
of subject incidences of the different AEs between the romiplostim and placebo groups. 
The  most  common  adverse  reactions  in  paediatric  ITP  patients  1  year  and  older  were  upper  respiratory 
tract  infection,  rhinitis,  cough,  oropharyngeal  pain,  upper  abdominal  pain,  diarrhoea,  rash,  pyrexia, 
contusion  (reported  very  commonly  (≥ 1/10)),  and  pharyngitis,  conjunctivitis,  ear 
infection,

gastroenteritis,  sinusitis,  purpura,  urticaria  and  peripheral  swelling  (reported  commonly  ( 1/100  to 
< 1/10)). 
Oropharyngeal pain, upper abdominal pain, rhinitis, pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, ear infection, sinusitis and 
peripheral  swelling  were  additional  adverse  reactions  observed  in  paediatric  studies  compared  to  those 
seen in adult studies. 
TSome of the adverse reactions seen in adults were reported more frequently in paediatric subjects such 
as cough, diarrhoea, rash, pyrexia and contusion reported very commonly (≥  1/10) in paediatric subjects 
and purpura and urticaria were reported commonly (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) in paediatric subjects.   
TIn an ongoing paediatric clinical trial, of the subjects with an evaluable on-study bone marrow biopsy, 5 
out  of  27  subjects  (18.5%)  developed  increased  reticulin  in  cohort  1  and  2  out  of  4  subjects  (50.0%) 
developed  increased  reticulin  in  cohort  2.  However,  no  subject  showed  any  bone  marrow  abnormalities 
that  were  inconsistent  with  an  underlying  diagnosis  of  ITP  at  baseline  or  on-treatment.  So  far  it  is  not 
known if the increases of bone marrow reticulin may have clinical consequences or if the incidence of the 
more  severe  collagen  fibrosis  may  increase  with  durations  of  exposure  >1  year.  Data  on  reversibility  of 
abnormal bone marrow findings are considered essential. Therefore, protocol 20101221 was amended to 
obtain post treatment bone marrow biopsies to evaluate reversibility of findings of increases of reticulin or 
collagen formation. The MAH has confirmed that the results of Study 20101221 will be submitted in line 
with the RMP.   
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Safety and data in terms of years of exposure of more than 1.5 to 2 years are still quite limited. Addition 
of  final  data  from  Study  20090340  and  study  20101221  resulted  in  an  update  with  a  longer  mean 
duration of treatment 65.5 weeks compared with 84.7 weeks. Although the update of efficacy and safety 
data was minimal with a small increase in patients with exposure >144 weeks (40/282 subjects (13.8%) 
compared  to  the  previous  data-cut  in  which  approximately  11%  had  such  an  exposure),  no  apparent 
differences  in  safety  analysis  are  observed  with  a  longer  treatment  duration  and  the  results  are  in  line 
with that previously observed. Final results on study 20101221 are expected in line with the RMP. 
In  the  clinical  trials  apart  from  was  one  case  of  phlebitis,  there  were  no  reports  of  thrombotic  / 
thromboembolic  Events.  However,  there  were  reports  of  7  serious  events  post-marketing  which  are  of 
concern and highlight the thrombotic potential of TPO agonists and the necessity of continuing vigilance. 
Study 20101221 will provide more data on this issue and the MAH will submit the final results. 
In paediatric studies, the incidence of binding antibodies to romiplostim at any time was 7.8% (22/282). 
Of the 22 subjects, 2 subjects had pre-existing binding non-neutralising romiplostim antibodies at 
baseline. Additionally, 2.5% (7/282) developed neutralising antibodies to romiplostim. A total of 3.2% 
(9/282) subjects had binding antibodies to TPO at any time during romiplostim treatment, of which 2 
subjects had pre-existing antibodies to TPO. All subjects were negative for neutralising activity to TPO. In 
the post-marketing registry study, 19 confirmed paediatric patients were included. The incidence of 
binding antibody post treatment was 16% (3/19) to romiplostim, of which 5.3% (1/19) were positive for 
neutralising antibodies to romiplostim. There were no antibodies detected to TPO. 184 confirmed adult 
patients were included in this study; for these patients, the incidence of binding antibody post treatment 
was 3.8% (7/184) to romiplostim, of which 0.5% (1/184) was positive for neutralising antibodies to 
romiplostim. A total of 2.2% (4/184) adult patients developed binding, non-neutralising antibody against 
TPO. An association between the presence of antibodies and bleeding events cannot be excluded.  
More paediatric data will be available from Study 20101221 in order to further assess this risk.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who reach a sustained platelet response 
was seen in patients treated with romiplostim compared to those on placebo. The efficacy of romiplostim 
to  elevate  platelet  counts  has  been  clearly  demonstrated  and  is  in  line  with  that  previously  reported  in 
chronic adult ITP patients, moreover consistent results are observed among the age groups. 
The  observed  results  are  considered  clinically  relevant,  particularly  in  the  context  of  patients  not 
responding to current first line standard of care.  
Prevention  of  bleeding  is  ultimately  the  clinical  benefit  of  interest  for  ITP  patients,  a  decline  in  bleeding 
events and rescue medication use was observed with longer time on study.  
The benefit in terms of prevention of bleeding events and use of rescue medication are more apparent in 
the  long-term.  Data  of  longer  term  follow  up  (beyond  144  weeks)  are  still  limited.  However,  long  term 
efficacy  and  safety  study  of  romiplostim  in  thrombocytopenic  pediatric  subjects  with  immune 
thrombocytopenia (ITP) will be provided with the submission of the results of study 20101221.  
Overall,  the  types  of  AEs  commonly  reported  in  the  paediatric  population  are  within  the  distribution  of 
types  of  AE  seen  in  the  adult  population  as  mentioned  in  the  Nplate  SmPC  and  do  not  represent  new 
safety  concerns.  Apart  from  bleeding  type  AEs  and  decreased  platelet  count,  most  are  compatible  with 
what might be expected to be reported as AEs in this young population. Although long term follow up was 
limited, the durations of treatment reached so far do imply that treatment with romiplostim, including the 
weekly injections, was well tolerated. There were minimal discontinuations due to adverse events and the 
relationship  between the AEs  concerned  and  treatment  with  romiplostim is  unclear.  However,  there  was 
not a pattern of AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment or to study discontinuation. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall,  the  data  presented  are  indicative  of  an  increase  in  platelet  counts  in  the  subjects  treated  with 
romiplostim compared to placebo. The observed efficacy was generally consistent among the age cohorts 
and  supported  by  secondary  endpoints.  The  data  obtained  is  in  line  with  the  efficacy  in  adults,  platelet 
counts are increased significantly in a majority of patients. 
Nplate is considered well tolerated and the risks are well known and manageable. 
Overall, the efficacy in increasing the platelet count in patients with ITP failing to prior treatment options 
is considered to balance favourably against the adverse events. 
3.7.3.  Discussion on the Benefit-Risk balance 
The  clinical  development  of  romiplostim  follows  an  agreed  PIP  and  results  of  these  studies  support  the 
efficacy  of  romiplostin  to  increase  platelet  counts  both  temporarily  and  in  the  long  term.  Supportive 
benefits have been observed in the risk of bleeding events and use of rescue medication, which are both 
reduced in the long-term treatment.  
Treatment  with  romiplostim  also  carries  risks  and  there  are  limited  data  on  long  term  treatment  for 
longer  than  1.5  to  2  years.  With  the  available  data  there  have  been  only  a  few  cases  of  bone  marrow 
reticulin  fibrosis  (2  mild  cases  seen  after  one  year  of  treatment  in  the  paediatric  clinical  trial  (Study 
20101221 designed to monitor fibrosis) apparently not clinically significant. However, data are still limited 
and results of Study 20101221 which will examine bone marrow in 2 cohorts of paediatric patients after 
one  year  and  after  2  years  of  treatment  with  romiplostim  are  awaited.  The  current  advice  in  the  SmPC 
Assessment report  
EMA/302907/2018 
Page 107/110 
 
  
  
concerning increased bone marrow reticulin is to perform regular examinations for cellular morphological 
abnormalities  using  peripheral  blood  smear  and  complete  blood  count  (CBC)  prior  to  and  during 
treatment with romiplostim. Further, if a loss of efficacy and abnormal peripheral blood smear is observed 
in  patients,  administration  of  romiplostim  should  be  discontinued,  a  physical  examination  should  be 
performed,  and  a  bone  marrow  biopsy  with  appropriate  staining  for  reticulin  should  be  considered.  If 
available,  comparison  to  a  prior  bone  marrow  biopsy  should  be  made.  If  efficacy  is  maintained  and 
abnormal peripheral blood smear is observed in patients, the physician should follow appropriate clinical 
judgment,  including  consideration  of  a  bone  marrow  biopsy,  and  the  risk-benefit  of  romiplostim  and 
alternative ITP treatment options should be re-assessed. 
These  recommendations  will  not  detect  early  bone  marrow  (reticulin)  fibrosis,  however,  the  magnitude 
and seriousness of this risk is not yet known. The full results of the bone marrow examinations after one 
year  and  after  2  year  exposures  to  romiplostim  can  be  awaited  before  considering  if  more  pro-active 
assessments  for  bone  marrow  fibrosis  are  considered  necessary.  In  this  regard,  the  MAH  has  confirmed 
that  provisions  to  generate  information  on  reversibility  of  any  detected  bone  marrow  (reticulin)  fibrosis 
after stopping treatment have been included and results of study 20101221 will be submitted 
This  is  a  matter of  concern  due  to  the  added  complexity  in  the  preparation  of  the  medication  and  thus, 
the risk for contamination and for medication errors. Hence, the educational materials were updated and 
self-administration  of  Nplate  is  not  allowed  for  the  paediatric  population.  In  addition,  the  MAH  is 
recommended  to  develop  a  reconstitution  and  dilution  kit  for  the  preparation  and  administration  of 
paediatric doses by a qualified health care professional. 
3.7.4.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Nplate is positive.

evidence to suggest a possible causal association between 
on respiratory depression and apnoea. Update of 
section 4.5 of the SmPC to add information on 
enhancement of effects, including sedative, 
anaesthetic and cardiorespiratory effects. Update of 
section 5.1 to introduce further clarification on 
respiratory depressive effects. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
respiratory depression/ apnoea and dexmedetomidine. Co-
administration of dexmedetomidine with anaesthetics, 
sedatives, hypnotics, and opioids is likely to lead to an 
enhancement of effects. Based on this data the Product 
information for Dexdor has been updated accordingly.

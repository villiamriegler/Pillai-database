2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The company applied for the following indication: treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque 
psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Psoriasis manifests in a wide range of severities, affecting 2 to 3% of the general population with 
significant variation by geographic location and age. The prevalence of psoriasis varies in the EU from 
0.6% to 8.5.  
2.1.3.  Aetiology, pathogenesis and Clinical presentation  
Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterized by the hyper proliferation 
of keratinocytes and skin-infiltrating T-lymphocytes that overexpress pro-inflammatory mediators. The 
disease is a chronic, painful immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease and has a lifelong remitting 
and relapsing course with varying factors that trigger exacerbations in susceptible individuals, thus 
making treatment challenging. Psoriasis is also associated with serious comorbidities and significant 
psychosocial disability with negative impacts on quality of life. The uncontrolled inflammation of 
psoriasis may contribute to commonly associated comorbidities, including cardiovascular (CV) disease 
(including hypertension and increased risk for myocardial infarction, stroke, and CV death), obesity, 
type 2 diabetes, arthritis, and chronic renal disease. Psoriasis is also associated with serious psychiatric 
comorbidities, including depression, anxiety, and suicidality, as well as substance abuse.  
The current therapeutic options for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis include phototherapy, topical 
agents (e.g., corticosteroids), conventional systemic therapy (e.g., cyclosporine, methotrexate, and 
oral retinoids), and biologic therapy including TNF-α antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab), 
anti-IL12/IL23 and anti-IL17 (ustekinumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab). The conventional therapies are 
associated with dose- and treatment-limiting options. The most common reasons for discontinuation of 
these therapies are lack of efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and treatment inconvenience. The biologic 
agents have been associated with higher objective response rates in clinical trials. However, even with 
these newer agents, most patients do not achieve optimal efficacy, such as total skin clearance. 
Although newer treatment options provide improved outcomes compared with traditional systemic 
therapies, there remains a significant unmet patient need for novel agents and mechanisms that can 
provide a rapid onset of effect, improved and sustained skin clearance, and minimization of drug-
specific safety concerns (e.g. serious infections including opportunistic infections and tuberculosis, 
malignancies including lymphoma, immunogenicity and demyelinating neurologic events). 
2.1.4.  Management 
The primary goal of psoriasis therapies is clearance of psoriatic plaques. Milder forms of psoriasis are 
typically managed with topical therapies, while more extensive or severe forms of psoriasis are 
typically managed with phototherapy or systemic therapy, which includes small molecules, usually 
given orally, and biologics, which are large molecules usually given by injection or infusion.  
In clinical practice, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists were the first biological therapies approved 
for psoriasis and represent a current treatment option for moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.

Ustekinumab (human IgG1 /κ monoclonal antibody against the p40 subunit of both IL-12 and IL-23 
cytokines), secukinumab (human IgG1 monoclonal antibody against IL-17A), and ixekizumab (human 
IgG4 monoclonal antibodies against IL-17A cytokine) have also been approved in Europe, the United 
States and Canada for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in patients 
who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. There is a small proportion of subjects 
receiving biologic therapy due to a variety of reasons including lack of effectiveness, inability to secure 
insurance coverage or payment for the recommended biologic therapies, safety concerns, lack of 
understanding of therapy use or monitoring, etc. Many subjects do not achieve adequate response, as 
defined by subjects achieving at least a 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 
score (PASI 75), with anti-TNF agents and find that current therapies lose efficacy over time. A 
reduction in long-term efficacy has been described with other biologic treatments more notably at 
lower doses or with intermittent treatment and compliance in psoriasis patients is found generally to 
be poor. 
2.2.  About the product 
Tildrakizumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody which specifically binds to the p19 subunit of 
human IL23, thereby inhibiting IL23 signalling.

2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as solution for injection containing 100 mg of tildrakizumab as active 
substance. Tildrakizumab is human monoclonal IgG1 antibody targeted against the p19 subunit of the 
human interleukin-23 (IL-23). The mode of action is the down-regulation of IL-23 signalling, thereby 
dampening the expression of inflammatory cytokines which are elevated in many autoimmune 
diseases. 
Other ingredients are: L-histidine, L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, polysorbate 80, sucrose and 
water for injections.  
The product is available in single-use pre-filled syringe for subcutaneous administration. Each pre-filled 
syringe is equipped with a passive needle guard and needle cover. Each pack-size contains 1 or 2 pre-
filled syringes.  
Although this dossier is not considered a Quality by Design application, certain elements of an 
enhanced approached were applied in the development of the control strategy. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Tildrakizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to human IL-23. It is composed of two identical 
heavy chains (HC) of 446 amino acids each and two identical light chains of 214 amino acids each 
linked by interchain disulfide bonds. The monoclonal antibody tildrakizumab is of the IgG1 subclass and 
contains kappa light chains. Tildrakizumab contains 16 disulfide bonds, which are consistent with the 
pattern known for the IgG1 subclass. The molecule is glycosylated on asparagine 296 (Asn296) on the 
heavy chain. Typically, the C-terminal lysines of both heavy chains are clipped and a small degree of 
proline α-amidation is also detected on the C-terminus. The N-terminal glutamines on the heavy chains 
are converted to pyroglutamate for the majority of the product. 
The molecular characteristics were determined by mass spectrometry, peptide mapping, and N-glycan 
profiling. The antibody is heterogeneously glycosylated at Asn296 within the Fc domain of each heavy 
chain. The dominant glycoform is the fucosylated agalacto biantennary glycan form (G0F). The 
observed molecular weight of the most abundant form of the intact antibody is 147.0 kDa, while the 
most abundant forms of the heavy and light chains are 50.0 kDa and 23.5 kDa, respectively. These 
masses are consistent with the expected values based on the translated amino acid sequence and the 
typical N- and C-terminal modifications. 
The secondary structure of tildrakizumab contains β-sheet domain as indicated by (FTIR). The tertiary 
structure of tildrakizumab is well defined by Near-Ultraviolet Circular Dichroism and Intrinsic 
Fluorescence. Based on the value of the peak maxima from intrinsic fluorescence, it can be deduced 
that, on average, the tryptophan residues are exposed to the environment within the tildrakizumab 
protein structure.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Tildrakizumab active substance is manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practices. Release 
testing is performed at a number of different manufacturing sites  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The tildrakizumab active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described and reflects 
a standard process for monoclonal antibodies. Main steps are fermentation, recovery and purification. 
The upstream cell culture process consists of three consecutive stages (inoculum expansion, seed 
bioreactor expansion, and cell culture and antibody production in a production bioreactor. The 
upstream process ends with a bioreactor harvest and initial recovery step. The antibody is 
subsequently purified and polished using standard chromatography techniques, virus inactivation, viral 
filtration, and ultra-/diafiltration. The filtered active substance is stored in bags at the recommended 
storage condition based on the provided stability data.  Reprocessing is not part of the tildrakizumab 
active substance manufacturing process. The ranges of critical process parameters (CPPs) and the 
routine in-process controls along with acceptance criteria, including controls for microbial purity and 
endotoxin, are described for each step. An adequate batch numbering system is in place. The active 
substance manufacturing process is considered acceptable. 
Tildrakizumab active substance is filled into sterile bags. The fluid contact layer complies with Ph. Eur. 
3.1.7. None of the studied extractables or leachables pose a toxicological concern at the levels 
identified. 
Control of materials 
The applicant described the construction of the expression plasmids, the transfection of the expression 
cell line and the selection of the production clone in detail. The tildrakizumab antibody was developed 
following immunizing mice with IL-23. 
CHO (DXB11)-cells are used as host cell line for the expression of the tildrakizumab antibody. A two 
tiered cell banking system is used. A master seed bank (MSB), master cell bank (MCB) and two 
working cell banks (WCB) were established. The second WCB has been produced without foetal bovine 
serum. An end-of-production cell line was established and genetic stability and viral safety 
investigated.  
Cell bank testing and characterisation was performed according to the requirements defined in ICH 
Q5A and Q5D. The data of cell bank characterisation demonstrate the absence of microbial and viral 
contaminants, as well as endogenously encoded retrovirus-like particles, except A type and a low level 
of C type retrovirus particles. No reverse transcriptase activity was measured.  
The stability of the WCB during storage is monitored continuously Stability of the MCB during storage 
is tested every two years after manufacturing. Genetic stability has been demonstrated for cells at and 
beyond the limit of cell age. 
The restriction patterns and hybridization patterns of the EPC were identical to that of the MCB. 
Furthermore, the mean target gene copy numbers per cell are comparable. 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, 
while specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented. No 
human or animal derived materials are used in the active substance manufacturing process and 
acceptable documents have been provided for raw materials of biological origin used in the 
establishment of cell substrate. Porcine trypsin has been used during early development and foetal

bovine serum (FBS) also during freeze down of the MCB and the first WCB. Sufficient information 
regarding the risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy and porcine virus contamination 
has been provided. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The critical steps and in-process control limits for the tildrakizumab active substance upstream and 
downstream manufacturing process have been provided. The critical steps have been identified and 
CPPs and key operating parameters (KOPs) were defined based on impact on quality attributes or 
process consistency, respectively. Appropriate in-process controls are in place to assure microbial 
control. Non-KOPs are operating parameters whose variability does not impact a key process attribute 
(KPA) or critical quality attribute (CQA), but is still controlled to a defined range. The assigned proven 
acceptable ranges (PARs) for the CPPs and KOPs are based on the results obtained by the process 
performance qualification and process validation studies. Action taken if limits are exceeded is 
specified. 
Initial normal operating ranges (NORs) have been defined for Phase 3 clinical batches manufacturing 
and were reviewed based on process characterization studies. The ranges of several process 
parameters were narrowed to be in the range of the proven acceptable ranges of the commercial 
manufacturing process. The NOR is defined as “The range of an operating parameter that is used for 
routine manufacture, accounting for the control limits of the equipment and its associated known 
variability.” 
Intermediates specifications, storage conditions and shelf life were sufficiently described and justified. 
The analytical methods used for in-process testing have been described and the method 
verification/validation results briefly presented. 
Acceptable information has been provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the 
active substance manufacturing process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical operational 
parameters and in-process tests. Actions taken if limits are exceeded are specified. 
Process validation 
The validation of the tildrakizumab active substance manufacturing process was conducted taking the 
principles of the CHMP “Guideline on process validation for the manufacture of biotechnology-derived 
active substances and data to be provided in regulatory submission” into account. The critical quality 
attributes (CQA), key process attribute (KPA), key operating parameter (KOP) and non-KOP have been 
defined during the process characterisation studies (PCS). The normal operating ranges (NORs) and 
/or proven acceptable ranges (PARs) assigned during the PCS (design-of-experiment (DOE) and/or 
one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) analyses) have been used as acceptance criteria during the process 
validation studies.   
The tildrakizumab active substance manufacturing process has been validated adequately. Consistency 
in production has been shown on three subsequent full-scale commercial batches manufactured using 
the commercial process. All acceptance criteria for the critical process parameters and likewise 
acceptance criteria for the in-process tests are fulfilled demonstrating that the purification process 
consistently produces tildrakizumab active substance of reproducible quality that complies with the 
predetermined specifications and in-process acceptance criteria. Furthermore, testing for adventitious 
agents and bioburden provided suitable assurance with respect to microbial contamination.  
Intermediate hold time studies have been performed for the active substance manufacturing process 
steps. Biochemical as well as microbial parameters have been evaluated. A suitable number of batches 
were tested. The validated hold time was assigned.

Resin lifetime studies have been performed for all chromatography steps in the active substance 
manufacturing process. Adequate small scale studies have been performed which cover the maximal 
intended resin lifetime. The results support the assigned lifetimes. Concurrent validation at 
manufacturing scale is ongoing. During the validation studies some minor deviations have been found 
which have been sufficiently justified. 
UF/DF membrane re-use is suitably described. 
Shipping validation has been performed using active substance container bags filled with water for 
injection (WFI). The container closure integrity was tested and the system found to be suitable for the 
tildrakizumab active substance shipment. 
Extractable and leachable studies have been performed on the process contact materials used during 
the manufacturing of the tildrakizumab. The studies did not detect leachables or extractables which are 
considered to pose high risks. The identified extractables and leachables are considered well below the 
daily maximal permissive expose (PDE) according to ICH Q3C. 
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing development including the control strategy defined for tildrakizumab has been 
designed taking the principles of ICH Q8-11 into consideration. The tildrakizumab active substance 
CPPs and CQAs have been defined according to ICH Q8. The commercial active substance 
manufacturing process was developed in parallel with the clinical development program. Process I 
active substance was used for non-clinical studies. Process I was up-scaled and transferred to another 
site. This produced material was used for Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Process I underwent further 
refinement resulting in process II. The main changes were usage of a WCB instead of a MCB, column 
changes and a change in the active substance formulation among other smaller changes. The material 
of process II was used for phase 3 clinical trials. Finally, process II was transferred to the commercial 
site and up-scaled. The main change beside facility and scale fits was the introduction of a new WCB, 
which was cultured and is stored without using FBS. 
The results demonstrate, with the exception of minor differences, high comparability between the 
active substance and finished product batches produced during tildrakizumab development up to the 
commercial process. For further understanding of the process and to determine critical parameters and 
attributes the applicant performed process characterisation studies. Prior to the Process 
Characterisation studies a risk assessment was performed using FMEA principles.  
KPAs, KOPs and non-KOPs have been assigned considering the outcome of the Process 
Characterisation studies or claims from the viral clearance studies. 
Characterisation 
The tildrakizumab active substance has been extensively characterised by physicochemical and 
biological state-of-the-art methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure of a 
human IgG1-type antibody. The analytical results are consistent with the proposed structure. Biological 
characterisation of tildrakizumab indicates that this antibody has the ability to bind the p19 subunit of 
the human IL-23 and to specifically bind to Fcγ receptors, C1q and FcRn as expected of an IgG1.  
Furthermore, heterogeneity of the active substance was adequately characterised by analysing size 
and charge variants, glycosylation and other product-related substances and impurities. The product-
related impurities are standard for a monoclonal antibody and include aggregates, fragments, charge 
variants, oxidised variants and deamidated variants. The product-related impurities are suitably 
controlled. Process-related impurities included host cell proteins, host cell DNA and protein A which are 
all controlled through the active substance release specifications.

Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description, identification, potency, purity, 
impurities, physico-chemical tests and microbiological tests.  
The panel of tests is considered sufficient to allow for routine control of the quality of this monoclonal 
antibody. The specifications were established using a tolerance interval approach based on release and 
stability data. The approach is acceptable and the assigned acceptance criteria are considered 
adequate. 
Analytical methods 
The active substance specification allows adequate control of identity, purity and potency.  The 
analytical procedures have been described. The potency of tildrakizumab active substance samples is 
determined, relative to the reference standard, using a functional cell-based assay.  
Validation 
Validation was performed on tildrakizumab active substance samples. For the manufacture of 
tildrakizumab finished product, active substance is delivered as formulated bulk solution containing the 
exact formulation of the final product, and no excipients are added during the finished product 
manufacturing process. Therefore, active substance is considered sufficient for validation of both active 
substance and final product. The material used is representative of commercial active substance and 
final product.  
Compendial analytical procedures have been verified per ICH Q2 (R1). For the Endotoxin test a Low 
Endotoxin Recovery (LER) study was performed to demonstrate that tildrakizumab active substance 
does not exhibit masking effects over a period of 7 days.  Bioburden recovery is not negatively 
impacted by tildrakizumab active substance or formulation buffer. 
Non-compendial analytical procedures have been validated according to ICH Q2 (R1).  
Batch analysis 
Representative batch analysis data are provided for tildrakizumab lots manufactured for the purpose of 
non-clinical and clinical testing, development as well as process validation of the active substance 
manufacturing process. Batch analysis data for an appropriate number of process performance 
qualification (PPQ) lots manufactured were presented.  
In summary, data for a number of active substance batches has been provided which includes process 
performance qualification (PPQ) lots and clinical lots manufactured at the commercial scale and site. All 
batch data were within specifications and demonstrate that the process is capable of producing an 
active substance of consistent quality. 
Reference materials 
Three primary reference standards (PRS) and one secondary reference standard (SRS) have been used 
throughout development. All reference standards were tested using the registered active substance 
release tests as well as extended characterisation testing. The acceptance criteria were tighter for 
some assays, in particular the potency assay. Reference standards are requalified every two years. The 
testing scheme for ongoing reference standard qualification is described in the dossier. A protocol for 
the generation of future reference standards is provided which includes details of the equivalency 
testing approach to ensure comparable potency.

Stability 
Real-time stability data from formal stability studies (FSS) at the recommended storage condition are 
available up to 36 months for four tildrakizumab active substance lots manufactured.  The lots 
evaluated in FSS, as well as the PPQ stability lots, are fully representative of the commercial material 
made in the commercial plant at commercial scale.  
The presented stability studies support the proposed storage period of 36 months. All results are within 
specifications. 
Data from accelerated, stressed and freeze-thaw stability studies have been provided. The stability 
results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf life in the 
proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The tildrakizumab finished product is presented as a sterile, preservative-free solution in a single-use, 
prefilled syringe (100 mg tildrakizumab/syringe) which is assembled into a safety device (finger flange, 
rigid needle shield, needle guard) referred to as a combination product. The prefilled syringe is made 
of  Type  I  glass,  Stainless  steel  Needle;  Polypropylene  Rigid  Needle  Shield;  Fluropolymer  lamination, 
latex-free plunger stopper.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. The drug product is filled with an excess volume to ensure a deliverable volume (1 ml).  
The excipients were selected on the basis of appropriate formulation development studies. Formulation 
composition and dosage form were developed as part of an extensive evaluation of factors such as 
buffer type, stabiliser/tonicifier and surfactant concentration. The robustness and stability of the 
commercial formulation has been adequately justified. 
The tildrakizumab finished product is developed as a pre-filled syringe (PFS) combined with a safety 
device (combination product). During the development, a design verification study as well as a design 
validation was conducted. The studies have been performed according to applicable regulations. In the 
regional information a Declaration of Conformity by the legal manufacturer- is provided.   
Stability studies under normal, accelerated and stressed conditions have been performed for the PFS 
and the combination product. No impact on technical attributes (extractable volume, gliding force, etc.) 
has been detected. 
The suitability of the container closure system of the tildrakizumab has been adequately assessed. 
Compendial testing as well as ISO standards were used to show suitability. Stability including 
photostability and container closure integrity testing were performed. Extractables and leachables 
detected are commonly seen in PFS systems and do not raise concerns regarding patient safety 
The microbiological attributes are adequately described as sterile and preservative-free. Aseptic 
processing is verified by media fills which are regularly performed. Container Closure integrity, release 
and stability testing add additional assurance. A rabbit pyrogen test has been performed which showed 
no pyrogenic response. The compatibility of the tildrakizumab is verified by development of the 
container closure system and finished product stability studies.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of the tildrakizumab finished product consists of two stages: 1) 
manufacturing of the PFS; 2) assembly of the safety device to the PFS (combination product). The 
manufacturing of the PFS is performed as standard fill-and-finish process, with no addition of new 
excipients. Both processes are briefly described and the process controls have been indicated. 
Reprocessing has not been reported in the dossier and is therefore not assumed to be applied for. 
The proposed target acceptance criteria are listed for both critical and in-process microbial parameters.  
The manufacturing process validation is acceptable and the process is demonstrated to be capable of 
producing batches of consistent quality.  
The tildrakizumab finished product manufacturing process performance qualification was conducted 
using three consecutive lots. The acceptance criteria were aligned with the finished product release 
specifications. The results met all pre-defined acceptance criteria.  
Taken together the manufacturing process qualification demonstrated that the process is robust and 
consistent. 
The microbial retention study demonstrated that under worst case conditions the filtration process is 
capable of producing aseptic finished product. Filter integrity testing is performed pre- and post-
filtration using the bubble point method. The applicant performed a filter compatibility study to show 
that the filter material used does not affect the quality of tildrakizumab. Aseptic filling is verified using 
media fills. All environmental monitoring results show no action limit excursions. 
The materials used during tildrakizumab manufacturing process have been tested for compatibility. A 
risk ranking was performed and materials identified as medium and high risk were subjected to 
leachable testing with finished product solution. Data concerning the extractable and leachables 
evaluation have been provided. 
Shipping of the tildrakizumab is performed using an active and passive thermal protection system 
(TPS). The shipping procedure is considered validated.  
Product specification 
The finished product specification includes tests for appearance and description, identification, assay, 
purity, impurities, potency, pharmaceutical technical tests and microbiological tests. The combination 
product specification includes test for appearance, device functionality and extractable volume. 
In general the finished product specifications are acceptable and take account of the requirements of 
the Ph. Eur. monographs for Parenteral preparations and Monoclonal antibodies for human use 
(01/2012:2031), respectively. The specifications have been developed in accordance with ICH Q6B. A 
specification is also applied to control the functionality of the device component. In the absence of a 
proposed control on silicone levels at release and stability of the finished product the applicant has 
confirmed that the supplier of the syringe barrel will control the level of siliconisation of the container 
at toxicologically justified levels to ensure sub-visible particles remain compliant with specifications 
over the lifecycle of the product. The tildrakizumab finished product acceptance criteria were 
established using a tolerance interval approach based on release and stability data. The dataset used 
to set release specifications comprised data of several batches. For stability specifications, several 
finished product lots (clinical, pre-filled syringe) were statistically analysed. 
The analytical procedures for tildrakizumab finished product are sufficiently described.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 17/126 
 
 
 
 
Some analytical procedures used to test both tildrakizumab active substance and finished product are 
discussed in the respective active substance section.  
Validation summaries for analytical procedures used to test tildrakizumab active substance and 
finished product are provided in the respective active substance section. Analytical procedures were 
validated in accordance with the ICH Q2(R1). Compendial methods were appropriately verified for their 
intended use. Methods for determination of syringe functionality have been evaluated in accordance 
with the principles of ISO-7886-1.  
Analytical methods 
For the manufacture of the finished product, tildrakizumab active substance is delivered as formulated 
bulk solution containing the same formulation as the final finished product, and no excipients are 
added during the finished product manufacturing process. Therefore many of the analytical methods 
are identical for finish product and active substance.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis 
Representative batch analysis data are provided for tildrakizumab finished product lots manufactured 
for the purpose of non-clinical and clinical testing, development as well as process validation of the 
manufacturing process. 
For all batches, predefined acceptance criteria which were in effect at time of batch analysis and 
release were met. 
Impurities 
Process-related impurities include particles that may arise from the manufacturing process. All prefilled 
syringes are 100% inspected for visible particles at the time of manufacture. During release and 
stability testing, the appearance of the tildrakizumab finished product is tested according to Ph. Eur. 
2.9.20. Any observed particles are further characterised. 
Product-related substances and impurities are monitored in tildrakizumab finished product at release 
and on stability. There are no new product-related impurities observed in the finished product relative 
to the active substance on stability. 
A quality risk management approach per ICH Q3D was conducted to assess potential sources for the 
introduction of elemental impurities within the tildrakizumab prefilled syringe (Option 2b). The 
following sources were considered: product contact materials during active substance manufacturing, 
excipients and water, product contact materials during finished product manufacturing, primary 
packaging components and silicone oil.  
Reference materials 
Because the compositions of tildrakizumab active substance and finished product are the same (no 
excipients are added during the finished product manufacturing process), the use of these primary and 
secondary reference standards obtained from active substance batches for testing both tildrakizumab 
active substance and finished product is appropriate. 
Stability of the product 
Stability has been demonstrated for the proposed shelf life based upon real time stability data of 
tildrakizumab PFS lots manufactured at both the clinical and commercial sites.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 18/126 
 
 
 
 
The available stability data for samples stored at the recommended storage conditions show good 
stability with no significant trends observed. The parameters tested are the same as for release. The 
stability indicating parameters are acceptable and the stability monitoring program conforms to ICH 
Q5C. 
Data from accelerated, stressed and cold stress, leachables and photostability studies have been 
provided.  
In use stability data supported the following claim: “Unopened PFS of Ilumetri may be removed from 
the refrigeration and stored up to 25°C for a single period of up to 30 days. Once removed from the 
refrigerator and stored under these conditions, discard after 30 days or by the expiry date printed on 
the container, whichever occurs first. A field for the date is provided on the carton to record the 
removal and discard date”. Based on available stability data, the 36 month shelf-life when stored at 
5ºC ± 3ºC as stated in the SmPC is acceptable.  
Adventitious agents 
TSE compliance 
Compliance with the TSE Guideline (EMEA/410/01 – rev. 3) has been sufficiently demonstrated. no 
materials of animal or human origin are used during production (fermentation or purification). Valid 
EDQM certificates of suitability have been provided for the animal-derived materials used during 
selection of the tildrakizumab expressing clone and establishment of the cell banking system. 
Virus safety 
Other than the cells themselves, no material of animal origin is added during fermentation. The cell 
banking system has been extensively screened for adventitious viruses using a variety of in vitro and 
in vivo assays. The tests failed to demonstrate the presence of any virus contaminants in the cell 
banks with the exception of intracellular type A and extracellular type C retrovirus-like particles which 
are well known to be present in rodent cells; this is acceptable however, since there is sufficient 
capacity within the tildrakizumab manufacturing process to inactivate/remove such virus particles. 
Effective reduction of enveloped viruses was demonstrated for the low pH inactivation step. Further 
reduction was observed for the entire panel of viruses for the various chromatography steps. Effective 
reduction was demonstrated for all four viruses for the retentive virus filtration step. At the end of the 
tildrakizumab fermentation procedure, general testing for adventitious viruses is performed as well a 
specific tests to detect minute virus of mice. 
In summary, the TSE and virus safety of tildrakizumab has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The applicant has applied elements of an enhanced approach in the development of the active 
substance and their manufacturing process. 
The tildrakizumab manufacturing process uses state-of-the-art methodologies frequently used for the 
manufacture of monoclonal antibodies. The process is well-described, characterised and validated. The 
control strategy for the active substance is well elaborated giving the applicant a significant amount of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 19/126 
 
 
 
 
process knowledge. The overall control strategy can be deemed sufficient to support the manufacture 
of active substance of consistent quality. Specifications for the active substance have been 
appropriately justified and acceptable acceptance criteria assigned. The active substance is stable at 
the intended storage condition and stability has been supported by data. 
Formulation studies for the finished product are described and are considered acceptable. The 
discussion of manufacturing process development is described in sufficient detail, and the development 
of the control strategy is well explained and justified. In general, the process validation studies show 
the manufacturing process to be sufficiently validated. The analytical methods are adequately 
described and validated. Specifications for the finished product have been appropriately justified and 
acceptable acceptance criteria assigned. The primary container closure system is a PFS which is 
assembled into a Passive Needle Guard Assembly as safety device (combination product). The details 
of this device and its control are acceptable. The proposed shelf-life of the finished product is 
acceptable based on the stability of pre-commercial scale batches. The comparability of these batches 
to the commercial-scale batches has been shown in the comparability exercises. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The applicant submitted a comprehensive non clinical scientific package to support the application for 
the treatment of psoriasis in adult patients. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Tildrakizumab is a humanised recombinant IgG1 that binds to the p19 subunit of IL-23, thereby 
blocking its interaction with the IL-23 receptor. IL-23 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been 
implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of chronic inflammatory diseases including psoriasis. The 
potential of tildrakizumab to be effective in the treatment of psoriasis has been investigated in non-
clinical studies using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo techniques. 
In vitro 
Comparison of the amino acid sequences of IL-23p19 between human and various preclinical species 
revealed that cynomolgus monkeys had a 98% homology to humans. The level of homology dropped 
off significantly with sequences which were not from non-human primates and only 77% and 72% 
homology was seen between human and rat and mouse respectively. In line with these findings 
Biacore surface plasmon resonance measurements revealed a KD of tildrakizumab for human IL-23p19 
of 297 pM and 47 pM for cynomolgus monkeys. No detectable binding to murine IL23-p19 was 
observed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 20/126 
 
 
 
 
Biological activity of tildrakizumab was determined using three different cell-based in vitro assays. IL-
23 dependent proliferation, STAT3 phosphorylation or IL-23-stimulated release of IFN-γ was inhibited 
by tildrakizumab with comparable IC50 values ranging from 59 to 187 pM. IC50 values for inhibition of 
IL-23 dependent STAT3 phosphorylation were comparable between human IL-23 or cynomolgus 
monkey IL-23, indicating functional similarity between the two species. Taken together this data 
supports that tildrakizumab will have relevant pharmacological activity in cynomolgus monkeys but not 
in mice or rats. 
Due to the lack of cross-reactivity with mouse IL-23p19 and in order to test the potency efficacy in 
vivo a surrogate antibody, SCH 900598, was generated against the mouse IL-23p19. This antibody, 
however, had a significantly lower affinity when compared to tildrakizumab with a KD of 3.5-6.7 nM. 
Functional assays similarly demonstrated a much higher IC50 of between 8-11 nM, again suggesting 
much lower potency for inhibiting IL-23p19 dependent signalling. Due to the lower potency of the 
mouse surrogate, the dose was scaled up for maximal efficacy in an in vivo colitis model.  
The anatomical distribution of IL-23p19, its 2 receptor subunits (IL-23R and IL-12Rβ1), and IL-
12/23p40 were assessed by quantitative gene expression in human tissues and compared to the 
anatomical profiles of the corresponding genes in cynomolgus monkey tissues and tissues from mice. 
Although the gene expression levels are highly variable between the species, the overall gene 
expression pattern is similar, being most expressed in tissue belonging to the immune system and 
gastrointestinal compartment. Enhanced expression of p19 and p40 mRNA was found in human 
diseased tissue from either psoriasis patients or Crohn´s Disease patients compared to normal tissue.   
In vivo 
The mouse surrogate antibody, SCH-900598, was used in a number of in vivo models in which 
increased IL-23 is linked to the pathology of the disease. Two different models of colitis, a T-cell 
dependent and an anti-CD40 model, were used and where efficacy of SCH-900598 was assessed. In 
both models SCH-900598 was effective although relatively high levels of up to 30 mg/kg were 
required. Although the disease indication differs than that in the current MAA these studies could be 
considered to be supportive in suggesting that the inhibition of IL-23 in inflammatory diseases can 
have significant effects on the pathology seen. 
For the proposed indication of psoriasis the most relevant in vivo efficacy data has been provided in a 
humanised mouse model of psoriasis. Here immunosuppressed mice were transplanted with clinically 
symptomless skin grafts from psoriasis patients. The data has been provided in the form of a peer 
reviewed publication and not as a study report. As such the materials and methods section is quite 
succinct and makes references to other literature sources for the description of the xenotransplantation 
experiments and the samples. In this model an anti-human IL-23p19 mAb blocked the development of 
psoriasis as assessed by microscopy measuring acanthosis and papillomatosis at 5 weeks post 
implantation compared to an isotype control antibody. The efficacy was comparable to that of an anti-
TNFα mAb which was used for comparison. Of note, the dose used in the study is quite high at 60 
mg/kg considering the proposed clinical dose of 200 mg. Although the antibody used in the study was 
not tildrakizumab, but an unrelated mouse monoclonal targeting IL-23p19, the study can be seen as 
supporting the potential of tildrakizumab in the treatment of psoriasis.  
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
As tildrakizumab is an IgG1 antibody, it has the potential to induce ADCC and/or CDC. However, this 
was not addressed by the applicant. Tildrakizumab binds to a soluble target and inhibits IL-23-induced 
signalling (e. g. phosphorylation of STAT3). As tildrakizumab binds to IL-23p19 the interaction of p19 
with subunit IL-23R is impaired. In theory, a binding of tildrakizumab to IL-12Rβ1 via IL-23 is 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 21/126 
 
 
 
 
conceivable. The applicant has provided a thorough discussion that this scenario would not occur in the 
clinical setting.  
The role of IL-23 blockade was assessed in three models of infection with intracellular pathogens. Mice 
were challenged with either Mycobacterium bovis BCG, Salmonella or Listeria monocytogenes and 
treated with the mouse surrogate antibody or respective controls. In summary, neutralizing IL-23 was 
less immuno-suppressive than neutralizing both IL-23 and IL-12. However, IL-23 and its involvement 
to the Th17 axis are also important for the host’s defence against extracellular pathogens, especially in 
mucosal immunity. In summary, the data suggest that IL-23-specific blockade would not be expected 
to incur any worse infection risk profile in humans than the existing anti-IL-12/23p40 therapy. 
However, impairment in host defence towards special pathogens cannot be fully excluded with the 
non-clinical data. Therefore, clinical monitoring of serious infections is addressed in the SmPC and in 
the RMP. 
Safety Pharmacology 
In line with ICH S6 (R1) no stand-alone safety pharmacology studies have been performed with 
tildrakizumab and instead appropriate endpoints were incorporated into the repeat dose toxicities 
studies in in monkeys. No tildrakizumab-related effects on the cardiovascular, respiratory and central 
nervous systems were noted. 
Overall, the provided non-clinical pharmacology package is considered sufficient to support the 
marketing authorisation application in psoriasis patients. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The non-clinical pharmacokinetics of tildrakizumab were evaluated in mice, in which tildrakizumab is 
not cross-reactive, and in cynomolgus monkeys, where tildrakizumab does cross-react.  
Methods of analysis 
Immunoassays used to analyse tildrakizumab, anti-tildrakizumab antibodies and IL-23 expression 
based on the Meso Scale Discovery platform were developed and validated appropriately to be used for 
the GLP toxicity studies. The assays mostly displayed appropriate levels of specificity and sensitivity. It 
is noted that the limit of quantification for ADAs is quite high at 0.781 µg/ml.  
Absorption: 
Single-dose administrations after IV and SC injection were performed in mice and cynomolgus 
monkeys. Due to a lack of cross-reactivity in mice any of the parameters measured do not reflect any 
effects of on-target binding. Linear increases in systemic exposure levels were seen in cynomolgus 
monkeys in response to increasing doses. Bioavailability following single dose SC administration varied 
from 40% to 91%. With a Tmax at 3-4 days following SC administration tildrakizumab appears to be 
slowly released when administered by this method. The mean half-life of tildrakizumab was 18.9 days 
across all doses investigated. However, the pharmacokinetic parameters measured are limited by the 
fact that several of the animals developed neutralising ADAs, particularly in the highest dose, and 
these animals were subsequently removed from the pharmacokinetics analysis. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters following repeat dosing were measured as part of the repeat dose toxicity 
studies in cynomolgus monkeys. The bioavailability measured was high at 86% after SC administration 
with systemic exposures displaying increases with doses and independent of sex. Some evidence of 
accumulation of doses was seen with Cmax and AUC(0-14 d) levels higher when measured after the 7th 
dose than those after the 1st dose. In the measured toxicokinetics samples the number of animals 
positive for ADAs was low and in most cases they did not appear to be neutralising.

EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 22/126 
 
 
 
 
Changes in formulation did not alter the pharmacokinetic parameters when a comparability study in 
both mice and monkeys was done following a change in formulation from solution to a lyophilised form. 
Distribution 
In a tissue distribution study in mice, fluorescently labelled tildrakizumab showed the expected non-
specific organ distribution typical of endogenous IgG.  
Metabolism  
As is appropriate for a monoclonal antibody no studies regarding the metabolism of tildrakizuamb were 
performed. As a protein, tildrakizumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and constituent 
amino acids. 
Excretion 
In line with ICH S6 (R1) guidance, no dedicated mass balance excretion studies have been performed 
with tildrakizumab. Low levels of tildrakizumab up to 0.252 µg/ml were evident in breast milk at PPD28 
in which dams were dosed up to parturition. This decreased significantly over time at PPD91, in line 
with the likely clearance of the drug from the dams. 
Drug-drug interaction studies 
Non-clinical PK drug interaction studies were not conducted. This is acceptable, since tildrakizumab as 
a monoclonal antibody is not metabolized via CYP450 enzymes. However, a potential impact of 
tildrakizumab on the PK of other drugs was evaluated in vitro in cultures of human hepatocytes. The 
study showed that expression of IL-23 receptor is negligible in human hepatocytes and IL-23 does not 
affect expression of CYP1A2 and CYP 3A4. Thus, tildrakizumab is not expected to affect the PK of other 
drugs. 
2.3.1.  Toxicology 
Toxicology studies with tildrakizumab were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys which were shown to be 
a relevant species, based on the binding of tildrakizumab to cynomolgus IL-23p19. Overall, the 
toxicology programme is in accordance with ICH S6(R1).  
Single dose toxicity 
No formal single dose toxicity studies have been performed. Clinical observations were made as part of 
a PK study in cynomolgus monkeys where doses up to 40 mg/kg were tolerated without clinical effects. 
Furthermore, the potential for off-target toxicities was assessed in mice where no pharmacological 
activity is expected. Doses of up to 200 mg/kg were tolerated without overt toxicity seen. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Toxicity of tildrakizumab was evaluated in repeated dose studies of 3-months and 9 months treatment 
duration. The two studies did not reveal tildrakizumab-related noteworthy findings, except for 
inflammatory infiltrates at the SC injection sites. 
It is noted that in both studies, histopathology data for the low- and mid-dose animals from the end of 
dosing sacrifice are lacking. This is not in accordance with the Guideline on repeated dose toxicity 
(CPMP/SWP/1042/99 Rev 1 Corr*), which recommends that for non-rodents, histopathology should be 
provided on all organs and tissues that are evaluated macroscopically since the number of evaluated 
animals is small. Nevertheless, the lack of the histopathology data for the low and mid-dose animals 
may be accepted, since the data from the high-dose animals at the end of treatment did not identify 
target organs of toxicity, except for the SC injection sites. Histopathology data from recovery animals 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 23/126 
 
 
 
 
from the 9 months study were generally unremarkable. The toxicity studies did not reveal 
tildrakizumab-related effects in any of the parameters evaluated.  
Systemic exposure in both studies was independent of sex, increased in a dose proportional manner 
and demonstrated accumulation with repeat dose administration. The accumulation is most likely 
related to the delayed clearance of the antibody which displayed a half-life of between 17.7-21 days 
which is consistent with an antibody of the IgG1 class. Of note, no ADAs were detected in any of the 
animals in the 9-month toxicity study, whilst only 1 animal in the 3-month study tested positive for 
ADAs which appeared to be neutralising based on the reduced exposure in this animal. It is noted that 
the limit of quantification for ADAs  is quite high at 0.781 µg/ml. It is accepted that despite the 
limitation with the developed assay for ADAs sufficient exposure levels appear to have been reached in 
the long-term repeat dose toxicity studies. 
In summary, no adverse effects were observed in the tildrakizumab repeated dose studies. In both 
studies, the NOAEL was the highest dose administered. In the 3-months study, the NOAEL was 140 
mg/kg following either IV or SC administration every 2 weeks; in the 9-months study, the NOAEL was 
100 mg/kg SC Q2W. Thereby exposure in cynomolgus at the NOAEL was > 100 – 200-times higher 
than the human exposure at the recommended SC dose of 200 mg, administered once every 12 
weeks. The exposure achieved in cynomolgus monkeys at the NOAEL provides a large margin to the 
exposure at the proposed clinical dose. 
Genotoxicity 
As a monoclonal antibody, tildrakizumab would not be expected to interact with nucleic acids. No 
genotoxicity studies were performed, in line with ICH S6(R1).  
Carcinogenicity 
Classical carcinogenicity animal studies were not conducted; instead the risk of carcinogenicity was 
assessed based on a weight of evidence approach. To this end, the applicant has conducted several in 
vivo studies in mouse tumour models and an extensive analysis of current literature. 
Literature evidence suggests that IL-23 p19 is increased during tumourigenesis, where it decreases 
immune surveillance by CD8 T cells. Although evidence from knock-out mice suggests that loss of both 
IL-23 and IL12 together is associated with increased cancer risk, the inhibition of IL-23 signalling alone 
is likely to result in a decreased risk. Mechanistic studies performed by the applicant have shown that 
tildrakizumab did not alter the growth of tumours in a xenograft model. Histopathological analysis of 
tissues from the 3 and 9 month repeat dose toxicity studies did not indicate any evidence for pre-
neoplastic changes. Taken together the weight of evidence supports the position that tildrakizumab is 
unlikely to be associated with increased carcinogenic risk. Nevertheless, malignancies will be monitored 
in the clinic during clinical studies and post marketing.  
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity of tildrakizumab was evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Fertility was evaluated based on histopathological data from the repeated dose toxicity studies. While 
almost all females were sexually mature, the number of sexually mature males was limited. 
Nevertheless, considering the lack of findings in the repeated dose toxicity studies together with data 
of normal fertility of mice deficient in IL-23 or IL-23 R the data available from the repeated dose 
toxicity studies are considered sufficient. Tildrakizumab is not expected to have an effect on fertility. 
Embryo-fetal developmental toxicity was assessed in a stand-alone study performed in cynomolgus 
monkeys treated by SC injection with 0, 10, 100 or 300 mg/kg every 14 days from GD 20 to 118. 
There were 2 abortions in the tildrakizumab groups with one each in the mid and high dose groups 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 24/126 
 
 
 
 
which are comparable to the control group (total of 2) and lower than historical data from the facility. 
No tildrakizumab-related malformations or variations were observed in the live fetuses. Transfer of 
tildrakizumab to fetuses was evident with ratios of 0.6-0.8 foetal/dam observed. ADAs were present in 
several of the dams and also one fetus, however, except for the 1 dam and her fetus most instances of 
ADAs did not appear to be neutralising. The highest dose of 300 mg/kg was identified as the NOAEL 
and toxicokinetics analyses revealed a 227 margin of exposure to the proposed 200 mg dose. 
A pre-postnatal development (PPND) study was performed in cynomolgus monkeys administered 
tildrakizumab by SC injection with 0, 10 or 100 mg/kg every 14 days from GD 50 to parturition with an 
associated TK study. TK analysis confirmed that off-spring was exposed to tildrakizumab. The 
fetal/maternal ratio for tildrakizumab serum concentration was approx. 1 on PND 7, 1.15 - 1.36 on 
PND 28 and 2.17 – 4.9 on PND 180. The increase in the infant/adult ratio is indicative of a slower 
clearance of tildrakizumab in infants compared to the maternal animals. Also, in this PPND study the 
incidence of fetal loss was comparable in tildrakizumab-treated groups (20% at 10 mg/kg; 7% at 100 
mg/kg) and the control group (20 %) and was within the range of historical control data. In viable 
offspring, seven neonates died or were euthanized within 15 days of postnatal life: 1/12 (8%) in the 
control group, 2/12 (17%) in the 10 mg/kg group, and 2/14% (14%) in the 100 mg/kg group. Four of 
these deaths are attributable to maternal neglect, which is a common background finding in 
primigravid cynomolgus monkeys, or death of the mother and unsuccessful cross-fostering. However, 
two neonates in the 100 mg/kg group which died were found to be icteric and had pathological findings 
of lymphoid depletion and changes in the liver and kidney suggestive of a viral infection. Since these 
findings were considered of an unknown relationship to tildrakizumab the NOAEL for the study was 
considered the lower dose of 10 mg/kg. In the surviving infants, there were no tildrakizumab -related 
changes in any of the parameters evaluated.  
Immunotoxicity endpoints were investigated in the surviving infants including measuring the levels of 
T-and B-lymphocytes as well as TDAR analysis. The results of these analyses did not reveal any 
tildrakizumab-related changes in lymphocyte numbers or TDAR responses. The systemic exposure 
levels at the time points at which the immunization was performed were much lower than would be 
seen during treatment. Nevertheless the applicant has made the argument that although the exposure 
level is low in the infants when measured at BD150 it is still more than 30 times the EC50 for IL-23. 
This argument appears logical and appropriate, thus accepted by the CHMP. 
The TK analyses revealed that the findings at 100 mg/kg occurred an 85 fold margin of exposure to the 
200 mg dose with a margin of exposure of 9 at the identified NOAEL. A risk assessment by the 
applicant for immune suppression and viral infection in relation to icteric neonatal deaths concluded 
that the there is no indication that immunosuppressive activity of tildrakizumab that would lead to an 
increased risk for bacterial or viral infections based on the results of the repeat toxicity studies, 
mechanistic studies where inhibition of IL-23p19 signalling did not affect host defence mechanism and 
the results of the immunotoxicity studies in infants in the PPND study.  
In accordance with the agreed PIP, juvenile animal toxicity studies were not conducted to support a 
future use of tildrakizumab in paediatric patients. 
Local tolerance 
Tildrakizumab was locally well tolerated by rabbits when injected by the IV, intramuscular, intra-
arterial and paravenous route. Local tolerance to tildrakizumab following SC administration, the 
proposed clinical route of administration, was evaluated as part of the repeated dose toxicity studies. 
Minimal perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates were observed at the SC injection in all tildrakizumab-
treated groups which was reversible. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 25/126 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunotoxicity 
The immunotoxic potential of tildrakizumab was evaluated as part of the PPND study in infants from 
mothers treated with tildrakizumab throughout gestation. Based on these data, overt 
immunosuppression by tildrakizumab is not expected. Nevertheless, since IL-23 is required for 
generation of Th17 cells, an impaired IL-17-dependent immune response against pathogens cannot be 
excluded. “Serious infections” is therefore listed as “important potential risk” in the RMP. 
Tissue cross-reactivity studies 
The potential cross-reactivity of tildrakizumab with cryosections of normal human tissues and normal 
cynomolgus monkey tissues was assessed. In both studies, tildrakizumab staining was seen in cells 
and tissues which have not previously been associated with IL-23 expression. The Applicant has 
argued that since these staining were all cytoplasmic in nature it is unlikely that such tissue cross 
reactivity would be able to occur in vivo. As outlined in ICH S6 (R1), tissue binding per se does not 
indicate biological activity in vivo and cytoplasmic binding is generally not relevant. When taken in the 
context of the lack of adverse findings in the repeat dose toxicity studies of up to 9-months duration in 
cynomolgus monkeys, it is accepted that the observed tissue cross reactivity is of little relevance.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Tildrakizumab is a monoclonal antibody consisting of natural amino acids, and is therefore not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. This is acceptable by CHMP. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant has presented non-clinical in vitro data to demonstrate the pharmacological mode of 
action for tildrakizumab as an IL-23 inhibitor. Tildrakizumab binds to human IL-23p19 with a KD of 297 
pM and is cross-reactive with to cynomolgus monkey but not to IL-23p19 of murine origin. Thus, 
cynomolgus monkeys were selected as the relevant species for toxicology testing. The affinity of 
tildrakizumab is higher towards IL-23p19 of cynomolgus monkey origin (47 pM) compared to that of 
human origin.  
Functional in vitro studies provide adequate information on the potency of tildrakizumab to inhibit IL-
23-induced signal transduction and cellular responses.  
In vivo studies in models of inflammatory bowel disease or psoriasis with IL-23p19 neutralising 
antibodies demonstrate pharmacologic activity and provide a proof-of-concept for the blockade of IL-
23 in psoriasis. 
The PK profile of tildrakizumab is considered as adequately characterised with single dose PK studies 
as well as TK measurements as part of the toxicity studies. No dedicated metabolic or excretion studies 
have been performed, however, this is in line with ICH S6 (R1) guidance.  
The toxicity of tildrakizumab has been adequately characterised in cynomolgus monkeys which were 
deemed to be the only active species for relevant pharmacological activity. In the repeat dose toxicity 
studies tildrakizumab was very well tolerated and the main findings were inflammatory infiltrates at 
the injection site following SC administration of the mAb. The NOAELs identified providing margins of 
exposure >100 fold the proposed clinical dose. In a pre and post natal development toxicity study in 
monkeys, no related increase in pregnancy loss was observed at exposures up to 85 times the human 
exposure at the recommended dose. No harmful effects were noted in neonates at maternal exposures 
up to 9 times the human exposure.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018

In the PPND study there were two neonate deaths, likely as the result of viral infection, and for which a 
role for tildrakizumab could not be excluded. These occurred at an 85 fold margin of exposure. The 
weight of evidence does not suggest an increased risk of bacterial or viral infections with MK-3222.   
2.3.4.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical development program is considered sufficient to support the marketing authorisation 
of tildrakizumab in psoriasis patients. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Original PK studies 
Five  Phase  1  trials  performed  by  the  applicant  are  presented  to  demonstrate  the  pharmacokinetic 
characteristics of tildrakizumab (summary description of studies in table above).  
The Phase 1 program was conducted in 222 subjects, including 125 healthy subjects and 97 subjects 
with  moderate  to  severe  psoriasis.  Fifty-nine  (59)  healthy  male  subjects  and  66  healthy  female 
subjects  were  included  in  the  Phase  1  program,  along  with  74  male  subjects  and  23  female  subjects 
with moderate to severe psoriasis. One hundred and three (103) healthy subjects were administered at 
least  one  dose  of  tildrakizumab  and  15  healthy  subjects  were  administered  matched  placebo.  Across 
trials,  healthy  subjects  received  tildrakizumab  via  IV  infusion  over  1  hour  at  doses  ranging  from  0.1 
milligram (mg)/kilogram (kg) to 10 mg/kg, or via SC administration at doses ranging from 50 to 400 
mg. Seventy-five (75) subjects with psoriasis were administered at least one dose of tildrakizumab and 
20  subjects  with  psoriasis  were  administered  matched  placebo.  Repeat  SC  dosing  with  200  mg 
tildrakizumab via PFS (Study P009) was also evaluated in the Phase 1 program.  
During the Phase 2 & 3 programme, the applicant performed sparse PK sampling across their Phase 2b 
and  their  2  pivotal  Phase  3  studies.  Pharmacokinetic  data  from  these  studies  were  pooled  with  data 
from the Phase 1 studies for analysis via population PK modelling. 
Tildrakizumab  is  a  humanized  immunoglobulin  G1  kappa  (IgG1  κ)  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  that 
binds to the p19 protein subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL 23) with high specificity and affinity. The 
binding  characteristics,  in  vitro  efficacy  and  specificity  of  tildrakizumab  have  been  tested  in  a  non-
clinical  pharmacology  developmental  program.  The  mechanism  of  action  of  tildrakizumab  is  the 
neutralization of human IL-23 thus inhibiting the IL-17 mediated immune response by the T helper 17 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 28/126 
 
 
 
 
 
lymphocytes  (Th17L).  The  mechanism  of  action  was  going  to  be  justified  in  humans  and  several 
cytokine tissue and serum levels. 
Three  formulations  (lyophilised  and  liquid)  were  used  in  the  clinical  development  of  tildrakizumab. 
Phase 1 trials (P05661, P05776, P06306, and P05382) and Phase 2b trial (P05495) and all trials with 
healthy subjects were conducted using a lyophilized formulation, whereas the Phase 1 trial (P009) and 
Phase 3 trials (P010 and P011) were conducted using the solution housed in a PFS.  In P009, different 
modes of application (sc via syringe vs. sc via autoinjector) were evaluated. 
The  applicant  has  outlined  the  bioanalytical  methods  used  to  profile  serum  levels  of  IL23,  IL22,  IL6, 
TNFa and IL1B in Phase 1 and 2 studies. With the exception of total IL-23, commercially available kits 
were used to assay these biomarkers and a summary of the assay characteristics and validation status 
and  have  therefore  been  provided.  In  brief,  the  sensitivity  and  precision  of  these  assays  have  been 
reported and are acceptable. A full validation report has been included for the IL-23 method and shows 
the assay can accurately quantitate IL-23 in normal human serum in the range of 20 - 43,740 pg/ml. 
Tildrakizumab  and  anti-tildrakizumab  antibodies  in  all  these  studies  were  assayed  with  sensitive  and 
specific immunoassays methods. Bioanalytical methods have been adequately validated. The methods 
to  measure  unbound  tildrakizumab,  ADAs  and  Nabs  in  human  serum  were  developed  and  originally 
validated  at  Merck,  Union,  NJ,  USA.  The  methods  were  then  transferred  and  validated  at  Covance, 
Chantilly,  VA,  USA  (Phase  1  clinical  trial  P009,  Phase  2b  clinical  trial  P05495,  and  pivotal  Phase  3 
clinical  trials  P010  and  P011).  The  method  transfer  validation  demonstrated  acceptable  performance. 
The  clinical  documentation  is  detailed,  compliant  with  regulatory  expectations  and  considered  as  a 
trustworthy source of information. 
Population PK analysis 
Supporting  the  PK  characterization  of  tildrakizumab  is  a  POP  PK  analysis  in  2098  subjects  providing 
17,321 evaluable concentration measures, using the specific assay of tildrakizumab, based on densely 
sampled PK data from Phase 1 (84 healthy and 19 subjects with psoriasis), as well as sparsely sampled 
PK data from Phase 2b (348 subjects with psoriasis) and Phase 3 (1646 subjects with psoriasis). The 
POP  PK  analysis  included  covariate  analyses  to  inform  intrinsic  and  extrinsic  factor  effects.  E-R 
modelling of Week 12 PASI response and longitudinal PK-PD modelling of PASI response time-course in 
1883  subjects  with  psoriasis  from  the  Phase  2b  and  3  trials  allowed  for  evaluation  of  the  impact  of 
intrinsic and extrinsic factors on PASI response and assessment of the clinical comparability bounds. In 
combination with exposure-safety evaluations, these models were used to establish the potential need 
for dose adjustments in sub-populations. 
Overall, the PK properties of tildrakizumab are very similar to other human IgG1-type immunoglobulin-
based mABs with few specific characteristics: 
Absorption 
The subcutaneous formulation of tildrakizumab showed an absolute bioavailability ranging from 73% 
(90% CI: 46% - 115%, 200 mg SC vs. 3 mg/kg IV) to 80% (90% CI: 62% - 103%, 50 mg SC vs. 0.5 
mg/kg IV) in healthy subjects, as a result of cross study single dose comparison. Maximum 
concentration was reached at 6.2 days after injection. Population PK analysis indicated a 31% higher 
bioavailability in healthy subjects compared to patients.  
At steady state, following administration of 100 mg of tildrakizumab in subjects with moderate to 
severe plaque psoriasis geometric means (% CV) of AUC0-τ and Cmax values were respectively 305 
μg·day/mL (41%) and 8.1 μg/mL (34%), whereas they were 612 μg·day/mL (40%) and 16.3 μg/mL 
(33%) following administration of 200 mg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 29/126 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Tildrakizumab has limited extravascular distribution with volume of distribution (Vd) values ranging 
from 76.9 to 106 mL/kg. 
Metabolism 
Tildrakizumab is catabolized by general protein degradation processes. Small molecule metabolic 
pathways (E.g. CYP, glucuronosyltransferases) do not contribute to clearance. Small-molecule 
metabolic pathways (e.g., CYP450 enzymes, glucuronosyltransferases) do not contribute to its 
clearance. 
Excretion 
Clearance values range from 2.04 to 2.52 mL/day/kg and the half-life was 23.4 days (23% CV) in 
subjects with plaque psoriasis. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
The POP PK model did not detect a departure from dose-proportionality across a wide range of doses. 
Based on simulations from the POP PK model, it was found that both AUC and Cmax at steady-state 
doubled with doubling of dose in psoriasis subjects.

Steady-state (SS) is achieved by 16 weeks with the clinical regimen (dosing on Week 0 and Week 4 
and Q12W thereafter) with 1.1-fold accumulation in Cmax (maximum tildrakizumab concentration). 
Steady-state treatment with 100 mg SC tildrakizumab results in geometric means (%CV) of AUC0-
Week12 (Area under the concentration versus time curve from time zero to week 12) and Cmax of 305 
μg•day/mL (41%) and 8.1 μg/mL (34%), respectively.

Steady-state treatment with 200 mg SC tildrakizumab results in geometric means (%CV) of AUC0- 
Week12 and Cmax of 612 μg•day/mL (40%) and 16.3 μg/mL (33%), respectively.  Time to maximum 
concentration (Tmax) was 6.2 days (46%) for both dose groups.  
Influence of TMDD could not be observed in the data.

Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Tildrakizumab PK exhibited moderate variability within and across individual clinical trials. PK samples 
showed a high variability arising mainly from the influence of body weight ant patient status. 
Simulations from the POP PK model indicated an inter-individual variability of 33-41% CV.  
Intra-subject variability was explicitly assessed in Phase I trial P009 in subjects with psoriasis, where 
CV of the geometric means for Day-1 AUC0-Week12 and Cmax were 42 and 43%, respectively. 
In addition to the PK parameter estimates, geometric means and %CV were calculated for CL, V, KA 
and derived PK parameters such as the absorption and elimination half-life. These calculations were 
based on posthoc parameters of the final run. Psoriatic subjects were characterized by a geometric 
mean (%CV) clearance of tildrakizumab of 0.32 L/day (38%), volume of distribution of 10.8 L (24%), 
absorption and elimination half-life (t½) of 1.5 days (18%) and 23.4 days (23%), respectively. Of note 
is the much lower CV of KA and absorption half-life, caused by the shrinkage of IIV on KA. Two of the 
three Phase 1 trials were conducted in healthy subjects. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
The PK profile of tildrakizumab is consistent with that of other human mAbs which typically have low 
clearance (CL) and a limited volume of distribution (V).  
Posthoc PK parameters for the psoriasis subjects in the Phase 2b and Phase3 trials generated from a 
one-compartment POP PK model indicated a geometric mean (% coefficient of variation (CV)) apparent 
CL (CL/F) of 0.32 L/day (38%), apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of 10.8 L (24%), absorption 
half-life and apparent elimination half-life (t1/2) of 1.5 days (18%) and 23.4 days (23%), respectively, 
and an absorption lag-time (Alag) of 1.2 hours. Standard diagnostic plots were generated to evaluate 
the adequacy of the base and final covariate models.

Simulated Derived PK Parameters for 100mg and 200mg Dose Groups 
Since very few rich profiles were available in the psoriatic subject population (Trial P009) and none at 
the clinical dose of 100 mg, derived PK parameters such as AUCss, Cmax and tmax were obtained 
through simulation. Simulations were based on the demographics of all psoriatic subjects in the PK 
data set (Trials P05495, P009, P010 and P011) that received 100 mg or 200 mg tildrakizumab, 
respectively. The geometric mean values and %CV from this analysis are presented in the Table below. 
At steady state (SS) of treatment with 100 mg SC tildrakizumab, geometric means (%CV) of AUC0-tau 
and Cmax were 305 μg*day/mL (41%) and 8.1 μg/mL (34%), respectively. The corresponding figures 
for treatment with 200 mg SC tildrakizumab at SS are 612 μg*day/mL (40%) and 16.3 μg/mL (33%) 
for AUC0-tau and Cmax respectively. Tmax was 6.2 days (46%) for both dose groups. Tildrakizumab 
has moderate PK variability (33-41% CV for AUC0-tau and Cmax).  
A significant difference in PK between healthy subjects and psoriasis subjects was observed. The 
sponsor states that body weight partially explains this discrepancy. Given the body weight distribution 
in both patients groups, this can be supported to some degree, however the introduced covariate HV 
on bioavailability accounts for almost the entire difference in bioavailability between healthy subjects 
and patients. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
No pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in special populations (ie pediatric [<18 years of 
age], elderly, subjects with renal or hepatic impairment). Results from population PK analyses indicate 
that age, serum albumin, creatinine clearance (CRCL), race (Asian, other), ethnicity (Hispanic), 
gender, body weight, formulation (Ph 1&2), patient status – all statistically significant- and prior 
treatment of psoriasis with a biological,  Japanese origin did not have a clinically relevant effect on the 
CL/F of tildrakizumab. All evaluated intrinsic and extrinsic factors were within the clinical comparability 
bounds of 0.7-2.7. The impact of covariate effects are small (such as gender, race or ethnicity) to 
modest (body weight).  The most influential covariates were body weight and subject population 
(healthy subjects vs psoriatic patients) on bioavailability with higher bioavailability in healthy subjects. 
High body weight (> 90 kg) was near the lower clinical bound. The potential for dose adjustment for 
higher body weight was evaluated using exposure-response and PK-PD models.  
Most covariate effects were minor and did not lead to a visible improvement of model diagnostics. 
Inclusion of additional covariates on top body weight and subject population (both part of the base 
model) had little effect on inter-individual variability (IIV CL decreased by 3%, other IIVs unchanged) 
and no effect on residual error estimates.  The lack of PK studies in special patient groups was found 
acceptable on the ground that tildrakizumab pharmacokinetics shows the general features of other IgG 
based mABs and previous regulatory and therapeutic experiences with these drugs do not warrant 
these studies. Introduction of covariates towards the final model has led to only a minor reduction of 
IIV values. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids and prior treatment of psoriasis with a biological agent 
were considered as potential covariates on the PK of tildrakizumab in the POP PK analysis. However, 
concomitant corticosteroids could not be formally tested as a covariate in the POP PK model because 
the predefined minimum of 50 subjects treated with systemic corticosteroids for at least 8 weeks was 
not met.  
Prior treatment of psoriasis with a biological agent was tested but did not have a statistically significant 
influence on tildrakizumab exposure. In the E-R and longitudinal PK-PD models PASI75 response rates 
were similar in subjects regardless of prior treatment of psoriasis with a biological agent.

Based on the established POP PK model, tildrakizumab PK in subjects with and without these extrinsic 
factors was simulated using distributions of other covariates derived from the psoriasis subjects 
enrolled in the Phase 2b and 3 trials. The resulting AUCss GMRs [90% CI] for subjects with/without 
concomitant systemic corticosteroids receiving 100 mg and 200 mg SC were 0.96 [0.80-1.14] and 
1.02 [0.82-1.26], respectively. The resulting AUCss GMRs [90% CI] for subjects with/without prior 
treatment of psoriasis with a biological agent receiving 100 mg and 200 mg SC were 0.90 [0.85-0.95] 
and 0.89 [0.85-0.84], respectively. 
Given the data and simulations provided, no clear influence of concomitant use of systemic 
corticosteroids and prior treatment of psoriasis with a biological agent could be detected. Of note, 
AUCss values for 100 mg and 200 mg doses in psoriasis subjects with concomitant systemic 
corticosteroids are very low (n= 11 and n=8). 
The influence of tildrakizumab on the PK of CYP substrates (caffeine, warfarin, omeprazole, 
dextromethorphan and midazolam) was investigated by the applicant.   Substrates have been 
administered as a cocktail, for the evaluation of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 
metabolism. The largest effect could be detected on dextromethorphan (CYP 2D6 substrate), as AUC0-
inf after a 30 mg dose of the substrate was 20% higher compared to the AUC0-inf without parallel 
tildrakizumab administration (two doses SC administered 4 weeks apart). Similarly, AUC0-inf of 
Caffeine (CYP 1A2 substrate) following a 200 mg dose was 14% higher; AUC0-inf of Midazolam (CYP 
3A4 substrate) after a 2 mg dose was 11% higher, AUC0-inf of S-warfarin (CYP 2C9 substrate) 
following a 10 mg dose was 7 % higher, respectively. No effect on Omeprazole (CYP 2C19 substrate) 
could be detected.  
It is expected that tildrakizumab has low interaction potential based on the in-vitro data and similarity 
of tildrakizumab to other monoclonal antibodies. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Tildrakizumab  (also  known  as  MK-3222  and  SCH  900222)  is  a  high  affinity  (297  picomolar  (pM)), 
humanized  immunoglobulin  G1/kappa  (IgG1/κ)  antibody  that  specifically  binds    to  p19  subunit  and 
neutralizes  human  IL-23.  IL-23  is  a  heterodimeric  cytokine  consisting  of  a  unique  p19  subunit  and  a 
common  p40  subunit  shared  with  IL-12.  It  has  been  recognized  as  a  key  driver  of  autoimmunity  in 
mouse  models  and  human  diseases,  which  is  commonly  attributed  to  the  ability  of  IL-23  to  polarize 
and  activate  Th17  cells,  a  subset  of  T  cells  that  has  been  identified  as  having  a  central  role  in 
autoimmunity.  
Regarding  psoriasis  pathogenesis,  the  IL23/Th17  pathway  is  considered  to  have  a  significant  role  in 
psoriasis  pathogenesis.  Genome  wide  association  studies  (GWAS)  have  identified  psoriasis  risk  alleles 
around gene regions that encode IL-23 (IL23A, IL12B) and the IL-23R. Both p19 and p40 subunits of 
IL-23 are over expressed in psoriatic skin lesions, while the unique p35 subunit of IL-12 is not. Th17 
cells,  and  the  cytokines  they  produce,  are  abundant  in  psoriasis  lesions,  where  they  exert  pro-
inflammatory  and  pro  acanthotic  effects.  Studies  have  also  indicated  that  disease  improvement  with 
TNF-α  inhibitor  therapy  correlated  with  the  rapid  down-modulation  of  IL-  23  and  Th17  cell  products, 
and  successful  response  to  treatment  was  dependent  on  the  inactivation  of  the  IL-23/Th17  pathway. 
Recent data suggest that the efficacy of these antagonists likely depends primarily, if not exclusively, 
on  their  ability  to  neutralize  IL-23  rather  than  IL-12,  thus  this  provides  the  rationale  for  selectively 
targeting IL-23p19 in patients with psoriasis.

Primary pharmacology 
Psoriasis  is  a  chronic  inflammatory  skin  disease.  Data  suggest  that  the  efficacy  of  interleukin  (IL)-
12/IL-23 biological agents depends on the ability to neutralize IL-23 rather than IL-12. Therefore, an 
approach  to  the  treatment  of  moderate-to-severe  chronic  plaque  psoriasis  may  be  the  use  of  a 
humanized anti-IL-23p19 monoclonal antibody. 
Decreases in PASI score demonstrated favourable tildrakizumab activity in Phase 1 trials (P05382 and 
P009). 
Various exploratory biomarkers of disease activity and safety were evaluated in early clinical trials for 
potential dose-response and/or predictiveness of PASI response: PASI, total IL-23, IL-22, Calprotectin, 
skin  biopsies,  IL-6  and  high-sensitivity  C-reactive  protein  (hsCRP).  Biomarkers  of  safety:  Across  the 
Phase  1  program,  IgG,  IgE,  IgA,  IgM,  and  ESR  were  analysed  as  exploratory  biomarkers  of 
immunogenicity and inflammation. There were no clinically meaningful changes in these parameters.  
No  useful  biomarkers  of  target  engagement  (total  IL-23),  dose  response  or  activity  (IL-22, 
calprotectin) were identified. For example, total IL-23 was anticipated to increase when tildrakizumab 
bound  IL-23;  however,  concentrations  were  largely  undetectable  pre-and  post-  treatment  with 
tildrakizumab. 
Serum  IL-6,  TNFα,  IL-1β  was  explored  in  P05382  to  ensure  there  was  no  immune  stimulation,  and 
there were no clinically meaningful changes in these parameters. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Overall,  provided  data  indicate  no  statistically  or  clinically  significant  effect  of  tildrakizumab  on  QTc 
interval. 
Immunogenicity 
The integrated ADA data through 12-16 weeks included subjects treated with 100 mg (N=700) or 200 
mg  (N=700)  tildrakizumab.  The  integrated  ADA  incidence  through  52-64  weeks  was  summarized  for 
evaluable subjects who were treated continuously with 100 mg (N=400) or 200 mg (N=380) in Phase 
2b  and  Phase  3  for  52-64  weeks.  For  subjects  in  Phase  2b  and  Phase  3  dosed  with  100  mg,  the 
proportion of TE-POS subjects increased over time from 4.3% through 12-16 weeks to 6.5% through 
52-64 weeks. In addition, the proportion of subjects who were TE-POS and NAb-POS was 0.6% (4 of 
700)  through  12-16  weeks  and  2.5%  (10  of  400)  through  52-64  weeks  [Table  2.7.2:  14],  [Table 
2.7.2:  15].  A  similar  proportion  of  subjects  dosed  with  200  mg  was  TE-POS  was  4.1%  (29  of  700) 
through  12-16  weeks  and  8.2%  (31  of  380)  through  52-64  weeks.  In  addition,  the  proportion  of 
subjects who were TE-POS and NAb-POS was 0.6% (4 of 700) through 12-16 weeks and 3.2% (12 of 
380) through 52-64 weeks. 
Antibodies to Tildrakizumab and Efficacy 
There  was  no  effect  of  ADA  status,  positive  or  negative/inconclusive,  on  the  proportion  of  subjects 
achieving  the  primary  and  key  secondary  endpoints of  PASI  and  PGA  response  at  Week  12.  Only  TE-
POS NAb-POS subjects showed a minor impact in clinical response. The clinical response in subjects in 
other ADA positive categories was similar to that of subjects in the ADA negative category. 
The  overall  incidence  of  antibodies  against  tildrakizumab  was  low  (4.2%  through  12-16  weeks  and 
7.3%  through  52-64  weeks.).  A  number  of  samples  were  classified  as  inconclusive  however  this  did 
not  impact  the  final  conclusion.  Efficacy  seems  not  be  influenced  by  the  antibodies.  For  detailed 
analysis, please, refer to the efficacy and safety sections in this report.

There were no clinical studies designed and conducted to evaluate pharmacodynamic interactions with 
other medicinal products. 
No genetic differences have been evaluated by the Applicant. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
An  efficacy  E-R  analysis  was  conducted  across  Phase  2b  and  Phase  3  (P05495,  P010  and  P011)  to 
investigate the relationship between tildrakizumab exposure and PASI response at Week 12 to assess 
the suitability of 100 and 200 mg SC as clinical doses. 
The primary clinical endpoint was defined at Week 12, but PASI was assessed throughout all trial Parts 
(Week 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 22, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60 and 64). At the end of Part 2, subjects 
were  assessed  for  PASI  response  and  based  on  PASI  improvement  were  defined  as  Responder  (PASI 
improvement  ≥75%),  Partial  Responder  (≥  50%  and  <75%),  Non-Responder  (<50%)  followed  by 
subsequent re-randomization for Part 3. 
Compared  to  100  mg,  200  mg  evoked  a  slightly  more  robust  response  regarding  PASI  90  responses 
towards the end of the clinical trial, but overall both doses could be considered comparable.  A strong 
exposure-efficacy trend could be detected: Similarly, PASI response increases from exposure (Cav12) 
Q1 to Q4 regarding each of the doses individually.  
Exposure-efficacy relationships: 
The  final  exposure-efficacy  model  (emax  model)  included  WEIGHT  and  AGE  as  covariate  on  E0.  A 
strong exposure-efficacy response is detected, whereas (simulated) dose-efficacy relationship (100mg 
vs 200 mg; 200 mg vs 400 mg) was rather flat. 
A  high  exposure/  bodyweight  –  efficacy  relationship  is  detected,  in  contrast  to  a  flat  dose-efficacy 
relationship  (dose  100mg,  200mg,  400mg)  as  showed  be  simulations.  Body  weight  has  a  very  high 
impact  on  exposure  (lowered)  and  also  on  PASI  response  (effect  lowered).  High  bodyweight  was 
constantly correlated with decreased tildrakizumab exposure and decreased PASI response throughout 
all simulated dosing regimens (0, 25, 100, 200, 400 mg). Higher dosing (400mg) would result only in 
a minor gain in benefit based simulations using the E-R model. Thus the sponsor was asked to discuss 
potential  factors  that  trigger  this  pronounced  loss  in  efficacy  in  patients  at  high  body  weight.  The 
potential IIV in F should be considered. Instead of a separate estimation of F in the patient population 
by  including  IV  data,  detailed  information  on  F  regarding  differences  between  healthy  subjects  and 
patients, and variability among patients from population PK analysis was provided upon CHMP request. 
The  sponsor  was  also  asked  to  simulate  a  dosing  regimen  where  200  mg  or  100  mg  would  be 
administered  more  frequently.  Simulations  indicated  that  maximum  efficacy  is  mostly  reached 
following the envisaged dosing regimen.  
Covariate AGE, like WEIGHT was found to influence exposure – efficacy with regard to PASI response 
in  the  exposure-response  model.  Therefore,  the  applicant  was  asked  to  provide  a  subgroup  analysis 
analogously.  Analyses  regarding  age  indicated  that  no  dose  adjustment  is  warranted  on  the  basis  of 
age.  Subgroup  analysis  regarding  covariate  WEIGHT  also  showed  that  exposure  in  terms  of  AUCss 
following 100 mg Q12W for patients ≤ 90 kg and following 200 mg Q12W for patients > 90 kg will be 
more balanced across the patient population. 
Dose/Exposure-safety relationship 
A  safety  evaluation  of  100  mg  vs  200  mg  in  partial  responders  during  Part  3  of  P010  and  P011  has 
been conducted. Safety was assessed by summarizing the proportion of subjects with certain Adverse 
Events  (AE)/Adverse  Event  Categories  (infections/infestations,  severe  infections/infestations,  upper 
respiratory  tract  infections  (URTI)  and  nasopharyngitis,  basal/squamous  cell  carcinoma,  melanoma,

MI/ischemia, cardiac failure, drug hypersensitivity). When comparing placebo, 100 mg, and 200 mg in 
all  subjects  in  Part  1  of  P010  and  P011,  no  specific  safety  difference  was  observed.  Similarly,  when 
comparing  100  mg  with  200  mg  across  Part  1  and  Part  2  combined,  no  apparent  differences  were 
seen.  Sub-setting  this  latter  comparison  in  lower  vs  higher  body  weight  subjects  (>90  kg  and  >120 
kg)  did  not  suggest  any  differential  safety  signal  between  the  doses  or  compared  to  the  integrated 
data.  The  lack  of  a  differential  safety  profile  with  body  weight  was  further  confirmed  in  a  subgroup 
analysis in the Phase 2b/3 placebo-controlled safety pool. 
An assessment was made of observed AEs by dose in Part 3 partial responders of trials P010 and P011, 
who initially started on the 100 mg regimen and were randomized to either 100 mg or 200 mg at Week 
28. During Part 3, there was a numerically greater percentage of subjects with infections/infestations 
in partial responders were uptitrated to 200 mg compared to those who continued to receive 100 mg. 
The number of partial responders was low (N=40 per group).  
Various  AE  categories  were  evaluated  as  part  of  the  exposure-safety  assessment  (Any  AE,  infection, 
severe  Infection,  URTI,  malignancies,  non-melanoma  skin  cancer,  melanoma  skin  cancer,  confirmed 
extended  Major  Adverse  Cardiac  Events  (MACE),  drug-related  hypersensitivity).  None  of  these  AE 
categories  indicated  a  specific  safety  signal  between  the  observed  exposure  quartiles.  No  clear  dose-
safety relationship exposure-response relationship with regard to safety could be detected. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH proposed dose for this product was 200 mg administered subcutaneously at weeks 0, 4 and 
every 12 weeks thereafter. Intravenous and subcutaneous doses including the  MAH proposed 200 mg 
doseas well as higher than the proposed dose have been evaluated in a large number of healthy 
volunteers and patients with psoriasis. Additionally, a population PK analysis has been conducted using 
densely and sparsely sampled PK data from phase 1, 2 and 3 trials of tildrakizumab. The exposure 
across the clinical development programme is considered adequate for PK and safety characterisation 
of tildrakizumab. Additionally, no significant differences were seen in adverse events in subgroup 
analyses (stratified by dose administered, patient weight etc).   
The PK profile of tildrakizumab is consistent with that of other human mAbs, which typically have low 
clearance and a limited volume of distribution. The POP PK analysis indicated that psoriatic subjects 
were characterized by a geometric mean (%CV) clearance (CL/F) of tildrakizumab of 0.32 L/day 
(38%), volume of distribution (V/F) of 10.8 L (24%), absorption and elimination half-life (t½) of 1.5 
days (18%) and 23.4 days (23%), respectively, and an absorption lag time of 0.05 days (1.2 hours).  
Based on simulations, it was determined that at steady state (SS) of treatment with 100 mg SC 
tildrakizumab, geometric means (%CV) of AUC0-tau and Cmax are 305 μg*day/mL (41%) and 8.1 
μg/mL (34%), respectively. The corresponding numbers for treatment with 200 mg SC tildrakizumab 
at SS are 612 μg*day/mL (40%) and 16.3 μg/mL (33%) for AUC0-tau and Cmax respectively. Tmax 
was 6.2 days (46%) for both dose groups. Tildrakizumab has moderate PK variability (33-41% CV for 
AUC0-tau and Cmax). The geometric mean (%CV) accumulation ratio was 1.1 (6%). 
The longer term PK data presented in the dossier did not fully support the MAH’s assertion that steady 
state is reached at week 16 with stable serum tildrakizumab concentrations thereafter. Additional 
experimental and simulated data as well as justification have subsequently been provided to 
demonstrate that serum tildrakizumab levels reach steady state after week 16 under the  MAH initially 
proposed dosing regimen of 200 mg Q12W. Prior treatment of psoriasis with a biological was not 
detected as statistically significant covariate.

A population PK analysis indicated that all evaluated intrinsic and extrinsic factors were within the 
clinical comparability bounds of 0.7-2.7. These bounds have been defined based in both the 100 mg 
and 200 mg doses. The impact of covariate effects are small (such as gender, race or ethnicity) to 
modest (body weight).  
The most influential covariates were body weight and subject population (healthy subjects vs psoriatic 
patients). High body weight (> 90 kg) was near the lower clinical bound. The potential for dose 
adjustment for higher body weight was evaluated using exposure-response and PK-PD models.  
The applicant has demonstrated lower exposure of tildrakizumab in patients of higher weight. Exposure 
is shown to be dose proportional across the 100 mg and 200 mg dose within the weight brackets 
analysed. In addition, higher body weight was found to be correlated with decreased PASI response. 
Most covariate effects were minor and did not lead to a visible improvement of model diagnostics. 
Inclusion of additional covariates on top body weight and subject population (both part of the base 
model) had little effect on inter-individual variability (IIV CL decreased by 3%, other IIVs unchanged) 
and no effect on residual error estimates.  
Exposure was noted to be significantly higher in healthy volunteers than in subjects with psoriasis. This 
was despite the fact that all healthy volunteers received the lyophilised formulation which was found to 
have a 5% lower relative bioavailability than the pre-filled syringe. The applicant argues that this is 
partially explained by body weight differences but no other causes have been proposed. The applicant 
has justified the unlikely disease effect on tildrakizumab exposure.  However, bioavailability in patients 
remains unknown and was set and fixed to 100% in the population PK analysis. In consequence, 
population PK analysis suggests a bioavailability of 131% regarding healthy subjects, which is not 
plausible. It is agreed that the population PK analysis only served for assessing the data variability in 
general. However information about bioavailability in the target patient population and in comparison 
with healthy subjects has been reflected in the SmPC section 5.2. 
There were no clinical studies designed and conducted to evaluate pharmacodynamic interactions with 
other medicinal products.  
It is expected that tildrakizumab has low interaction potential based on the in vitro data and similarity 
of tildrakizumab to other mAbs.  
The mechanism of action of tildrakizumab is the neutralization of human IL-23 through binding to its 
p19 subunit thus inhibiting the IL-17 mediated immune response by the T helper 17 lymphocytes 
(Th17L). The mechanism of action was going to be justified in humans and several cytokine tissue and 
serum levels. 
Various exploratory biomarkers of disease activity and safety were evaluated in early clinical trials for 
potential dose-response and/or predictiveness of PASI response: PASI, total IL-23, IL-22, Calprotectin, 
skin biopsies, IL-6 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Biomarkers of safety: Across the 
Phase 1 program, IgG, IgE, IgA, IgM, and ESR were analysed as exploratory biomarkers of 
immunogenicity and inflammation. There were no clinically meaningful changes in these parameters. 
Serum IL-6, TNFα, IL-1β was explored in P05382 to ensure there was no immune stimulation, and 
there were no clinically meaningful changes in these parameters.  
The data provided indicate no statistically or clinically significant effect of tildrakizumab on QTc 
interval.  
The immunogenicity of tildrakizumab was analysed. Additionally, all subjects positive for antibodies to 
tildrakizumab in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies were assessed for the potential of these antibodies to 
neutralize the bioactivity of tildrakizumab (ie, NAbs) using a sensitive and drug tolerant competitive

ligand binding assay. The overall incidence of antibodies against tildrakizumab was low.  Efficacy 
seems not to be influenced by the antibodies. 
The most important issue arising from the clinical pharmacology studies is the potential issue of body 
weight on clinical response.  By evaluating the dose-response in relation to efficacy 200 mg evoked a 
slightly more robust response regarding PASI responses.  In contrast to the flat dose-response 
relationship, a strong exposure-efficacy trend could be detected: PASI response increases from 
exposure (Cav12) Q1 to Q4 regarding each of the doses individually. 
While the population PK analysis showed a slight decrease in exposure with increased body mass, 
increased tildrakizumab exposure was not linked to greater clinical response.   
The MAH proposed 200 mg dose has not been fully justified from an exposure-response perspective in 
the clinical pharmacology section of the dossier. Both observed data and the simulations indicate that 
at 100 and 200 mg maximum efficacy is mostly reached. The differentiation between the two doses 
regarding dose-response relationships remains very vague and becomes more apparent over time 52 
and 64 weeks in terms of PASI, PGA scores and DLQI. There is a point that in lower weight patients < 
90 kg the 100mg may be sufficient dose, as body weight was identified as most influential covariate on 
tildrakizumab PK. Supportively, from the pharmacokinetic point of view, subgroup analysis regarding 
covariate weight indicates that exposure in terms of steady state AUCss following 100 mg Q12W for 
patients ≤90 kg and following 200 mg Q12W for patients > 90 kg will be more balanced across the 
patient population. Similar trends were indicated by a detailed subgroups analysis of efficacy endpoints 
with respect to body weight bins. 
Thus, proposing an optimal dosing regimen that will be adjusted to body weight (90kg) is considered 
appropriate.  
Therefore the CHMP considered that 100mg was the most relevant regimen and did not agree with the 
applicant proposal of 200mg dose.  An alternative dose regimen of 200mg seem however plausible in 
higher weight patients with a cut off of more than 90 kg. A more flexible dose in the SmPC section 4.2 
was the preferred option based on the above data and therefore recommended by CHMP. 
The results are reflected in section 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant has provided an acceptable review of the pharmacology of this medicinal product. The 
pharmacokinetic profile of the product has been well characterised. The MAH initially proposed dose 
was discussed during the whole application. Ultimately the CHMP concluded that the optimal dose 
would be 100 mg and that in specific situations (patients with higher weight more than 90 kgs and 
patients with high burden disease) the dose of 200mg may be used. 
In patients with psoriasis tildrakizumab is slowly absorbed with median time to Tmax of approximately 
6.2 days after SC injection. The mean terminal half-life (t1/2) value was estimated to be approximately 
23 days in a population PK analysis. The most important issues arising from the clinical pharmacology 
studies are the potential issue of body weight on clinical response, disease effects on tildrakizumab 
exposure, and a clear justification of the proposed 200 mg dosing regimen. (please refer to additional 
discussion later in the report). The primary pharmacodynamics profile of the product has been 
adequately described. The immunogenicity data provided for the medicinal product are acceptable and 
in line with other IgG monoclonal antibodies. No apparent association between the development of 
antibodies to tildrakizumab and the occurrence of adverse events has yet been noted.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The following clinical trials were performed to support the application.  
Table 5 Summary of efficacy trials 
A total of 2217 patients were randomized in the tildrakizumab clinical development program consisting 
of 1 Phase 2b dose ranging study (P05495/P003) and 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies (P010 and P011). 
P05495 and P010 were placebo-controlled and P011 used etanercept as additional comparator. Efficacy 
variables used as endpoints were PASI 75, 90, 100 and PGA at different timepoints, while PASI 75 and 
PGA were used as co-primary endpoints in the pivotal endpoints.

2.5.1.  Dose response study 
The schematic representation of the study design of the dose response study (P05495/P003) is 
presented below: 
Figure 6: study design 
Study methods/objectives 
The study P05495 consisted of screening/wash-out period followed by 3 Parts. Part 1 was a 16-week, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, treatment period to evaluate the optimal dose regimen for induction 
of response (Weeks 0 to 16).  
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized to receive tildrakizumab 5 mg, 25 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg or placebo in a 
1:2:2:2:1 ratio at Weeks 0 and 4. At Week 16 (end of part 1) treatment assignments were maintained 
or modified on PASI 75 response. Part 2 was a 36-week (Weeks 16 to 52), double-blind, treatment 
period to evaluate the optimal dose regimen for maintenance of response.  
Patients received trial medication every 12 weeks for an additional 36 weeks during Part 2. Part 3 was 
a 20-week washout period (Weeks 52 to 72).  
Inclusion/exclusion criteria 
Adult male and female patients (≥18 years of age) with a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe chronic 
plaque psoriasis (defined by ≥10% body surface area [BSA] involvement, “moderate” or greater 
score on the PGA scale, and PASI score ≥ 12 at baseline) who are considered to be candidates for 
phototherapy or systemic therapy were eligible to participate in the trial. Excluded were patients with 
presence of non-plaque forms of psoriasis, any infection requiring treatment with systemic antibiotics 
within 2 weeks prior to Screening, positive HIV test result, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C test 
result, previous exposure to any agents targeting IL-12 and/or IL-23.  
The study design and eligibility criteria were adequate for this dose response study. The baseline 
characteristics were similar between the treatment groups.

Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint shows the highest rate of PASI 75 response in the tildrakizumab 200 mg group 
followed by the tildrakizumab 100 mg group. These dosing groups also showed a meaningful difference 
to placebo with 67.65% for the 200 mg group and 56.23% for the 100 mg group. The other endpoints 
assessed in this study also supported these dosing regimens.

Set) 
Secondary Endpoint 
The PGA response of clear or almost clear 0-1 was statistically significant better with Tildrakizumab 
treatment. The highest responses were seen with the 200mg dose, this was seen in the full analysis 
and per protocol sets.

Tildrakizumab has statistically significant higher response rates for PGA response (defined as “clear or 
minimal” with at least 2 point reduction from baseline) as compared to placebo. The PP analysis further 
supports the outcome of the analysis in the FAS population. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The phase 3 clinical program for tildrakizumab consisted of 2 pivotal studies P010 (reSURFACE1) and 
P011 (reSURFACE2). P010 was placebo-controlled, while P011 also used etanercept as active 
comparator. The doses of tildrakizumab were selected based on the results of the Phase 2 dose-
ranging trial, P05495. 
2.5.2.1.  Study P010 (reSURFACE1) 
Study P010 was a 64-week, Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety/tolerability of subcutaneous Tildrakizumab, followed by an optional Long-Term 
Safety Extension Study, in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. 
Methods 
The schematic description of the study is presented hereafter.

Figure 9: study design 
Study P010 consisted of a 4-week screening period, a 12-week Part 1 period (Week 0 to Week 12), a 
16-week Part 2 period (Week 12 to Week 28), a 36-week Part 3 period (Week 28 to Week 64), an 
optional 4 year long term extension, and a 20-week follow-up period.  
Objectives 
The primary objectives were to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of tildrakizumab compared to 
placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.  
Study Participants  
Patients selected were adult males and females 18 years of age or older with a diagnosis of plaque 
psoriasis for more than 6 months and were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Disease 
severity was gated to moderate to severe by baseline scores of BSA involvement ≥10%, PASI score ≥
12, PGA of at least moderate disease (≥3). A maximum of 30% of patients may have had a diagnosis 
of psoriatic arthritis at baseline and a maximum of 40% of patients may have had prior exposure to 
biological therapies for psoriasis.

The exclusion criteria were designed to ensure patients safety. Excluded were patients with any 
infection including HIV, HCV and HBV, malignancies, hospitalization due to CV events within 6 months 
and other significant organ dysfunctions. Further were patients excluded who in the opinion of the 
investigator, were not be able to participate optimally in the trial as well as subject who, in the opinion 
of the investigator, had a history of alcohol or drug abuse in the previous year. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with PASI 75 response and PGA score of 
“clear” or “minimal”, with at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline, at Week 12. Other endpoints that 
were assessed included PASI 90 and 100 at different timepoints as well as patient-reported outcomes 
e.g. DLQI. 
Randomisation/ Treatments 
In Part 1 patients were randomized on Day 1 (Week 0, Visit 2) in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of 3 treatment 
arms to receive Tildrakizumab 200 mg subcutaneously (SC) at Weeks 0 and 4 (Arm A), Tildrakizumab 
100 mg SC at Weeks 0 and 4 (Arm B) or Tildrakizumab placebo SC at Weeks 0 and 4 (Arm C).  
In Part 2 patients initially randomized to placebo (Arm C) were re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
either tildrakizumab 200 or 100 mg at Week 12 and 16. At Week 28, all patients were assessed for 
clinical response (PASI and PGA). Patients who did not achieve at least 50% improvement from 
baseline PASI (non-responders) were discontinued. 
In Part 3 responders (75% improvement from baseline PASI) were re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
either continue on their initial treatment or to receive placebo every 4 weeks until relapse. Once 
relapse occurred the tildrakizumab dose that the patient was originally randomized to at baseline was 
re-initiated. Partial responders from Arm A remained on tildrakizumab 200 mg every 12 weeks, while 
these patients from Arm B were re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive tildrakizumab 100 mg or 
tildrakizumab 200 mg every 12 weeks. Upon completion of Part 3, patients who were eligible may have 
entered the long-term safety extension study that will assess the long-term safety/tolerability of 
tildrakizumab. 
Sample size 
The sample size of study P10 was chosen to assure a substantial safety database. Approximately 750 
patients (300 - tildrakizumab 200 mg, 300 – tildrakizumab, 150 - placebo) were to be included. 
Assuming a placebo rate of 10% for both PASI 75 response rate and proportion of patients with PGA 
“clear” or “minimal” with at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline, the trial had more than 99% 
power to detect a 57% difference between tildrakizumab and placebo in PASI 75 response rate and to 
detect a 55% difference in proportion of patients with PGA response, using a 2-sided chi-square test at 
alpha=0.05. 
Assuming a placebo rate of 2% for PASI 90 response, the trial had more than 99% power to detect a 
30% difference between tildrakizumab and placebo in PASI 90 response rate. Assuming a placebo rate 
of 1% for PASI 100 response, the trial had 99% power to detect a 10% difference between 
tildrakizumab and placebo in PASI 100 response rate. 
Blinding (masking) 
Tildrakizumab and its matching placebo were identical in appearance and were packaged identically to 
so that treatment blind was maintained. All patients underwent administration of additional placebo 
doses to maintain blinding.

Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the FAS of all randomized patients who received at least 1 
dose of trial medication.  The co-primary endpoints of PASI 75 response rate and the proportion of 
patients with PGA of “clear” or “minimal” with at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline at week 12 
were analysed by means of a CMH test stratified by body weight and prior exposure to biologic therapy 
for psoriasis. Each dose of tildrakizumab was compared to placebo. Missing PASI 75 / PGA response 
information was imputed as non-response. 
In order to assess the robustness of the primary analysis, supportive PP and an ITT analyses were 
performed using the same CMH test and missing data handling approach as described above. Other 
supportive analyses were conducted based on the FAS population, where missing data were imputed 
using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach and multiple imputation respectively. The 
imputation model was built for the underlying PASI score and PGA score respectively, including 
covariates such as age, gender, race, region, body mass index (BMI), psoriatic arthritis, prior exposure 
to biologics therapy, baseline PASI, baseline PGA, and baseline BSA.  
In general dichotomous endpoints were analysed using the same CMH model as mentioned above for 
the co-primary endpoints. For the key secondary endpoints a non-responder imputation was applied to 
account for missing data otherwise missing data were treated as missing. Change in DLQI score from 
baseline at week 12; change in HAQ from baseline at week 12; and change in PGAP from baseline at 
week 12, were analysed using a constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) method. The cLDA 
model assumed a common mean score across treatment groups at baseline and a different mean for 
each treatment at each post-baseline time point. In this model, the response vector consisted of the 
baseline measurement and the measurement observed at each post-baseline time point. Time was 
treated as a categorical variable. The analysis model adjusted for body weight, prior exposure to 
biologic therapy for psoriasis, time, and the interaction of treatment by time. An unstructured 
covariance matrix was used to model the correlation among repeated measurements. 
Multiplicity for testing the co-primary and key secondary endpoints across the 2 tildrakizumab doses 
was controlled using a gate-keeping sequential testing procedure.

Conduct of the study 
Amendments 
The initial protocol, dated 14-JUN-2012, was amended 8 times. Amendment 1, 5 and 7 were global, 
while Amendment 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 were applicable for sites in Japan only. 
Protocol Amendment 1, dated 12-SEP-2012 (Global): 
• 
Patients with PASI response <50% (non-responders) from all Arms at Week 28 were to be 
discontinued in order to maintain blind. 
•  Revision of Inclusion Criterion #9 (base study) and Inclusion Criterion #5 (long-term safety 
extension study) regarding contraception measures. 
•  Addition of Inclusion Criterion #14 (base study) for patients with psoriatic arthritis at baseline 
enrolled at Japanese sites: if patients were on NSAIDs, they should have been in a stable dose 
for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication and were not anticipated to have 
an increase in the dose over the course of the trial. 
Protocol Amendment 5 (010-05), dated 14-JAN-2014 (Global): 
•  Removal of Visit 35 in the follow-up period.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 47/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
The Wording regarding the follow-up visits was revised to state that patients who discontinued 
early from the base or long-term safety extension study were to continue with the visits in the 
follow-up period. 
Protocol Amendment 7 (010-07), dated 08-JAN-2016 (Global): 
• 
The PASI 100 response endpoint at Week 12 was upgraded to a key secondary endpoint. 
Statistical analysis related to this endpoint was revised to reflect the change. 
•  Addition of PASI 100 response rate as another secondary endpoint/objective in the long-term 
safety extension study. 
Protocol Deviations 
Major protocol deviations were reported at a greater incidence in the informed consent category 
(32.1% of patients) compared with all other deviation categories. Major protocol deviations related to 
informed consent included, but were not limited to, subject not signing the current version of the 
informed consent, wrong or missing date of signature on the informed consent, and lack of investigator 
involvement in the consent process. Protocol deviations that were considered to have the potential to 
affect results of the co-primary endpoints of the study (referred as protocol violations) were pre-
specified as reasons for exclusion from the PP analysis. 
Upon request from CHMP, the applicant provided further information on the above concerns regarding 
the outcome of the GCP inspections GCP/2017/017 and GCP/2017/034. The overall high number of 
protocol deviations revealed deficiencies in the process management of the study. However, further 
assessment and review, the impact on the protocol deviations was considered negligible. 
Baseline data 
The baseline data are presented in Table below.

Table 8: 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar among the treatment groups. The majority was 
male (69%) and white (68.3%).  However, the number of patients with psoriatic arthritis was higher in 
the 100 mg and tildrakizumab 200 mg groups (17.5% and 19.5%, respectively) compared to the 
placebo group (12.3%). The most common secondary diagnoses were Metabolism and Nutrition 
Disorders (31.9%), Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (31.5%), and Vascular Disorders 
(30.7%) and were generally similar across treatment groups. The most common prior medication was 
corticosteroids, dermatological preparations (54.9%) followed by immunosuppressants (36.5%).

Numbers analysed 
772 patients were enrolled of which 638 completed the study. Of the 772 randomized patients, 27 
(3.5%) were excluded from the PP analysis population due to protocol deviations, most frequently 
reported violation in the category of prohibited medication. The most common reason for 
discontinuation was withdrawal by the patients (4.5%), followed by lack of efficacy (3.1%). 
Outcomes and estimation 
•  PASI 75 Response at Week 12 
For the co-primary endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving a PASI 75 response at Week 12 
was significantly higher in the tildrakizumab 100 mg (63.8%) and tildrakizumab 200 mg (62.3%) 
groups compared with the placebo (5.8%) group (p<0.001 each).

Subgroup analyses were performed with regards to Body weight, prior exposure to biologic treatment, 
failure to prior systemic treatment, age, gender, race, region, history of TNF antagonist response and 
psoriatic arthritis. Overall, results were consistent across the various subgroups and were similar to 
those seen in the FAS population. 
2.5.2.2.  Study P011 (reSURFACE2)  
Study objectives 
Study P011 was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active-comparator and placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety/tolerability of subcutaneous (SC) tildrakizumab, 
followed by an optional long-term safety extension study, in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic 
plaque psoriasis.

Endpoints/outcomes 
The primary objective of study P011 was to assess the efficacy of tildrakizumab compared to placebo 
with regards to PASI 75 and PGA score of “clear” or “minimal” with at least a 2 grade reduction from 
baseline at Week 12. One of the key secondary endpoint was to assess the efficacy of tildrakizumab 
compared to etanercept. 
The co-primary endpoints were proportions of patients with PASI 75 response and PGA score of “clear” 
or “minimal”, with at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline at Week 12. The secondary endpoints 
included PASI 75, 90, 100 and PGA at different time points as well as patient reported outcomes e.g. 
DLQI at different timepoints. 
Randomisation  
Approximately 1050 subjects were to be randomized at approximately 120 sites. The duration of the 
base study was up to 76 weeks for each subject. This included a 4-week screening period, a 12-week 
Part 1 period, a 16-week Part 2 period, and a 24-week Part 3 period. Subjects who completed Part 3 of 
the trial were eligible to participate in a long-term safety extension study to evaluate the long-term 
safety and maintenance of effect of tildrakizumab.

In Part 1 patients were randomized on Day 1 (Week 0, Visit 2) in a 2:2:1:2 ratio using to receive 
tildrakizumab 200 mg SC at Weeks 0 and 4 and etanercept placebo SC twice weekly (Arm A), 
tildrakizumab 100 mg SC at Weeks 0 and 4 and etanercept placebo SC twice weekly (Arm B), 
tildrakizumab placebo SC at Weeks 0 and 4 and etanercept placebo SC twice weekly (Arm C) or 
tildrakizumab placebo at Weeks 0 and 4 and etanercept 50 mg SC twice weekly (Arm D). 
Randomization was conducted by region and stratified by Body weight (≤90 kg or >90 kg), failure to 
respond to at least one traditional systemic medication and prior exposure to biologics therapy for 
psoriasis. At Week 12, patients were assessed for clinical response 
In Part 2 patients originally randomized to tildrakizumab (Arms A and B) continued on their current 
treatment and received an additional dose of study medication at Week 16. At Week 12, all patients 
initially randomized to placebo (Arm C) were re-randomized to receive tildrakizumab 100 mg or 
tildrakizumab 200 mg at week 12 and received additional doses of study medication according to their 
re-randomized treatment assignment at Weeks 16 and 28. All patients randomized to etanercept (Arm 
D) received once-weekly doses of etanercept until Week 28. At Week 28, all patients were assessed for 
clinical response. 
In Part 3 responders (75% improvement in PASI score from baseline) in Arm A at Week 28 were re-
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to tildrakizumab 200 mg or tildrakizumab 100 mg, administered at Weeks 
28, 40, and 52. Patients, who achieved partial response (≥ 50% but < 75% improvement in PASI score 
from baseline) at Week 28, continued to receive tildrakizumab 200 mg every 12 weeks. Non-
responders (<50% improvement in PASI) were discontinued.  
Responders in Arm B who received tildrakizumab 100 mg in Part 1 and Part 2, continued to receive 
tildrakizumab 100 mg every 12 weeks. Partial responders were re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
tildrakizumab 100 mg or tildrakizumab 200 mg every 12 weeks. Non-responders were discontinued 
from the study. 
Patients in Arm C continued receiving tildrakizumab according to their re-randomized treatment 
assignment during Part 2. 
Partial responders and non-responders, who received etanercept (Arm D) in Part 1 and Part 2, were 
assigned to receive tildrakizumab 200 mg at Weeks 32, 36, and 48. Responders in the etanercept arm 
were discontinued from the study at week 28. Patients, who completed the base study and achieved at 
least 50% improvement in PASI from baseline at the end of Part 3 and satisfied all other entry criteria, 
were eligible to participate in the long-term safety extension. The 192-week long-term safety 
extension study is currently ongoing.  
Sample size 
Approximately  1050  subjects  in  total  were  planned  to  receive  2:2:1:2  randomized  treatment 
assignment  to:  (A)  tildrakizumab  200  mg  (N=300),  (B)  tildrakizumab  100  mg  (N=300),  (C)  placebo 
(N=150), or (D) etanercept (N=300). 
With this sample size, assuming a placebo rate of 10% for both PASI 75 response and PGA “clear” or 
“minimal” with at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline, the trial had more than 99% power to detect 
a  57%  difference  between  tildrakizumab  and  placebo  in  PASI  75  response  and  to  detect  a  55% 
difference in PGA “clear” or “minimal” with at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline. 
In  addition,  a  difference  of  17%  between  a  tildrakizumab  dose  and  etanercept  for  PASI  75  response 
rate could be detected with more than 98% power assuming an etanercept rate of approximately 56%; 
and  a  difference  of  20%  between  a  tildrakizumab  dose  and  etanercept  for  PGA  “clear”  or  “minimal” 
with at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline could be detected with more than 99% power assuming 
an etanercept rate of approximately 49%, using 2-sided test at significance level of alpha=0.05 
Assessment report

Assuming a placebo rate of 2% for PASI 90 response, the trial had more than 99% power to detect a 
30% difference between tildrakizumab and placebo in PASI 90 response rate. 
Assuming  a  placebo  rate  of  1%  for  PASI  100  response,  the  trial  had  99%  power  to  detect  a  10% 
difference between tildrakizumab and placebo in PASI 100 response rate. 
A difference of 10% between a tildrakizumab dose and etanercept for PASI 90 response rate could be 
detected with 73% power assuming an etanercept rate of approximately 30%. 
A difference of 5% between a tildrakizumab dose and etanercept for PASI 100 response rate could be 
detected with 46% power assuming an etanercept rate of approximately 10%. 
Assuming a screen failure rate of 15%, approximately 1235 subjects were to be screened. 
Blinding (masking) 
All  subjects  were  administered  study  medication  or  matching  placebo  for  both  tildrakizumab  and 
etanercept according to their treatment assignments. 
Statistical methods 
Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analysis Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
The co-primary endpoints of PASI 75 response rate and the proportion of subjects with PGA of “clear” 
or  “minimal”  with  at  least  a  2  grade  reduction  from  baseline  at  Week  12  were  analyzed  using  the 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by body weight (≤90 kg, >90 kg) and prior exposure to 
biologic therapy for psoriasis (Yes, No). Each dose of tildrakizumab was compared to placebo. Subjects 
with missing data were treated as non-responders. 
The  study  was  declared  positive  if  tildrakizumab  200  mg was  superior  to  placebo on  both  co-primary 
endpoints based on the FAS analysis. 
Supportive Analyses for the Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
A PP analysis and an ITT analysis was performed as supportive analyses using the same CMH test and 
missing  data  handling  approach  as  described  above.  A  second  supportive  analysis  was  conducted 
based  on  the  FAS  population,  where  missing  data  were  imputed  using  the  last  observation  carried 
forward (LOCF) approach.  
An additional sensitivity analysis was conducted using multiple imputation. Specifically, an imputation 
model  was  built  for  the  underlying  PASI  score  and  PGA  score  respectively,  including  comprehensive 
demographic  variables  and  baseline  disease  characteristics  as  covariates  such  as  age,  gender,  race, 
region,  body  mass  index  (BMI),  psoriatic  arthritis,  prior  exposure  to  biologics therapy,  baseline  PASI, 
baseline  PGA,  and  baseline  BSA.  The  dichotomized  PASI  75  response  and  PGA  response  (i.e.,  PGA 
score of “clear” or “minimal”) based on the multiple imputed PASI score and PGA score was analyzed. 
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The  key  secondary  endpoints  were  analyzed  in  the  same  fashion  as  the  primary  endpoints  with 
comparisons to placebo and etanercept. 
Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints – Part 3 (Week 28 to Week 52) 
Responder Analysis 
Subjects  who  were  originally  randomized  to  tildrakizumab  200  mg  (Arm  A)  and  who  were  PASI  75 
responders at Week 28 were re-randomized to either remain on the original dose regimen or to receive 
dose down-titration of tildrakizumab 100 mg starting from Week 28.

The PASI 75 response rate and the proportion of subjects with PGA of “clear” or “minimal” with at least 
a  2  grade  reduction  from  baseline  at  Week  52  and  over  time  were  evaluated  for  these  subjects 
comparing  those  who  received  lower  dose  of  100  mg  with  those  who  remained  on  200  mg. 
Additionally, the change and percent change from baseline in PASI score were summarized over time 
for the treatment group comparison described above. 
Partial Responder Analysis 
Subjects  who  were  originally  randomized  to  tildrakizumab  100  mg  (Arm  B)  and  who  were  partial 
responders at Week 28 were re-randomized to either remain on the original dose regimen or to receive 
dose up-titration of tildrakizumab 200 mg starting from Week 28. The PASI 75 response rate and the 
proportion of subjects with PGA of “clear” or “minimal” with at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline 
at  Week  52  and  over  time  were  evaluated  for  these  subjects  comparing  those  who  received  higher 
dose  of  200  mg  with  those  who  remained  on  100  mg.  Additionally,  the  change  and  percent  change 
from baseline in PASI score were summarized over time for the treatment group comparison described 
earlier. 
Results 
Participant flow 
756 of initially 1090 patients completed the trial. The most common reason for discontinuation was in 
the category of Other Protocol Specified Criteria. The rate of discontinuation for other protocol specified 
criteria was numerically lower in the placebo group (1.9%) compared with the tildrakizumab 100 mg 
and 200 mg groups and the etanercept group (10.7%, 5.4%, and 51.1%, respectively) because 
placebo-treated subjects were not discontinued while etanercept responders and tildrakizumab 100 mg 
and 200 mg non-responders were discontinued based on their responder status at Week 28.  
Other reasons for discontinuation of study medication were generally similar between the 4 treatment 
groups. Of the 1090 randomized subjects, 1026 (94.1%) subjects completed Part 1 of the base study 
(the initial 12-week treatment period); 1025 subjects continued into Part 2 of the base study. 
Of these subjects, 995 (97.1%) subjects completed Part 2 (i.e., a total of 28 weeks of treatment); 794 
subjects continued into Part 3 of the base study. Of these subjects, 756 (95.2%) subjects completed 
Part 3 (24-week treatment period). 
Subjects  who  completed  the  base  study  were  eligible  to  participate  in  the  optional  long-term  safety 
extension study provided they met the extension eligibility criteria. Of the 756 (69.4%) subjects who 
completed  the  base  study,  731  (67.1%)  subjects  entered  the  long-term  safety  extension  study.  All 
subjects who were discontinued from the base study or completed the base study but did not enter the 
long-term safety extension study were to enter a 20-week follow-up/washout period to monitor  
safety/tolerability, PK, and ADA response. 
Of  the  359  (32.9%)  subjects  who  did  not  enter  the  long-term  safety  extension  study,  196  (18%) 
subjects entered the follow-up period and 163 (15%) subjects did not enter the follow-up period.

Table 13: Disposition of Subjects (All Subjects Randomized) Base Study 
Conduct of the study 
The most common major deviations were regarding informed consent (326 deviations [29.9% of total 
deviations]), investigational product administration or study treatment (240 deviations [22.0% of total 
deviations]), and procedures or tests (212 deviations [19.4% of total deviations]). 
The  PP  population  excluded  subjects  from  the  FAS  population  due  to  important  deviations  that  could 
have affected results of the co-primary endpoints. A total of 175 subjects were excluded from the PP 
analysis population in Part 1 (N=140) or Part 2 (N=167) of the base study. The most common reason 
subjects were excluded from the PP population was due to not meeting the PASI, PGA, or BSA inclusion 
criteria. 
Baseline characteristics  
Demographic characteristics were generally similar between the 4 treatment groups. The majority of 
patients were male and white. 91.1 % were less than 65 years of age. The mean weight was 88.58 kg 
with a range from 44 to 194.7 kg. 14.1% had a diagnosis of Psoriatic Arthritis. The most common 
secondary diagnoses were Vascular Disorders (27.5%), Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders (26%), and 
Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (25.5%) and were generally similar across treatment 
groups.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The proportion of patients achieving a PASI 75 response at Week 12 was significantly greater in the 
tildrakizumab 100 mg (61.2%) and tildrakizumab 200 mg (65.6%) groups compared with the placebo 
(5.8%) and the etanercept (48.2%) group (p<0.001 each).

Time (Missing=NR)(Full Analysis Set) 
Regarding the second co-primary endpoint, the proportion of patients with a PGA score of “clear” or 
“minimal”, with at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline at Week 12 was significantly greater 
in the tildrakizumab 100 mg (54.7%) and tildrakizumab 200 mg (59.2%) groups compared with the 
placebo (4.5%) and etanercept (47.6%) group (p<0.001 each).

statistically not significant according to the pre-specified testing procedure. In the sequence of multiple 
testing procedure, the results of the following endpoints occurred after the failed test of the PGA score 
of tildrakizumab 100 mg compared to etanercept at Week 12. Hence, after adjusting for multiplicity 
using a gate-keeping sequential testing procedure, these results were not statistically significant. 
The results of supportive analysis at Week 12 in the ITT population, PP population, FAS population 
using LOCF and in the FAS population using multiple imputations supported the conclusion from the 
primary analysis.

Based on the pre-specified testing strategy, a statistically significant 
superiority of tildrakizumab 200mg over placebo could be shown for PASI 90 
and PASI 100 at week 12. With regard to PASI 75 and PGA at week 12 
tildrakizumab 200mg was also statistically significant superior to etanercept. 
With regard to PASI 90 and PASI 100, following the testing strategy the trial 
failed to show a statistically significant superiority of tildrakizumab 200 mg 
over etanercept. 
For tildrakizumab 100mg  a statistically significant superiority with regard to 
PASI 90 at week 12 over placebo could be shown. Due to the testing 
strategy all other comparisons of tildrakizumab to placebo or etanercept 
with regard to key secondary endpoints failed.

All patients in the Phase 2b/3 trials were at least 18 years of age, and there have been no clinical trials 
conducted in the paediatric patient population to evaluate PK, safety or efficacy. 
Elderly 
A total of 175 patient´s ≥65 years old (155 patients aged between 65 and 75 and 20 patients ≥75 
years old) were included in the clinical trial programme. Subgroup analyses were performed showing 
no meaningful difference in PASI 75 at week 12 for the tildrakizumab 200 mg group. A slight difference 
was seen for the tildrakizumab 100 mg group in study P011 with a higher proportion of patients in the 
<65 years of age group achieving a PASI 75 response. However, the number of patients included in 
this subgroup analysis was low. 
Pregnant and breast feeding women 
Female patients who were pregnant or lactating were excluded from enrolment in the clinical trials. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
No formal trials with tildrakizumab on patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted. Patients 
with significant organ dysfunction (such as significant hepatic dysfunction) were excluded from the 
clinical trials. Among patients receiving tildrakizumab during the base period, there were 90 patients 
with medical history of hepatic impairment in the Phase 2b/3 trials.  
Patients with renal impairment 
No formal trials with tildrakizumab on patients with renal impairment have been conducted. Patients 
with significant organ dysfunction (such as significant renal dysfunction) were excluded from the 
clinical trials. At baseline, there were 609 patients with mild renal impairment, 56 patients with 
moderate renal impairment and 1 patient with severe renal impairment. There were no patients with 
renal failure included. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
Cross-study comparisons of efficacy focused on the results through Week 12 to include data from the 
Pivotal Phase 3 trials and the Dose Ranging Study, due to the design of the studies. Summary of 
response rates beyond week 28 included the phase 3 studies with regards to PASI 75, PASI 90, PASI 
100 and PGA at different timepoints to show the magnitude of treatment effect and time to onset of 
efficacy and response.  The results of the pooled analysis for the  Phase 2b/3 and Phase 3 studies show 
the favourable efficacy of tildrakizumab 200 mg in the with regards to PASI 75, 90, 100 and PGA as 
well as patient reported outcomes e.g. DLQI compared to tildrakizumab 100 mg, placebo and 
etanercept over time and across the studies. The results are in line with the ones seen in each study.

The results show, that the proportion of patients with DLQI score of 0 or 1 at Week 12 was greater in 
the tildrakizumab 100-mg and 200-mg groups compared with the placebo group in both P010 and 
P011 and compared with the etanercept group in P011. In addition the 200mg groups in both trials had 
numerically greater responses compared with the 100mg groups at Week 12 and Week 28. In P011, 
the 100-mg, 200-mg, and placebo to 200-mg groups had a higher proportion of patients with DLQI 
score of 0 or 1, compared with the etanercept group.

Dose Increase Effect in Partial Responders 
The dose increase effect from Week 28 to Week 52 for partial responders on tildrakizumab 100mg 
(subjects reaching PASI 50 but not PASI 75 at Week 28) was assessed using data pooled across the 
Phase 3 trials (P010 and P011) for the proportion of subjects with PASI 75, 90 and 100 responses. Due 
to the small sample sizes of each treatment group (n=40 for subjects having continued beyond Week 
28 with 100mg and n=40 for subjects having received an increased dose of 200mg), results should be 
interpreted with caution, in particular for lower responsive PASI thresholds (PASI 90 and PASI 100). 
At Week 52, after 24 weeks of treatment beyond Week 28 (and two doses of tildrakizumab), the 
majority of subjects who were partial responders to tildrakizumab 100mg at Week 28 and continued 
treatment with 100mg or increased to 200mg had reached PASI 75: 57.5% for subjects who remained 
on 100 mg and 60.0% for subjects who increased dose to 200mg. 
Higher PASI improvements to PASI 90 and PASI 100 were also achieved: 11/40 (27.5%) and 6/40 
(15.0%) had reached PASI 90 in the continuing 100mg and increasing to 200mg groups respectively 
7/40 (17.5%) and 2/40 (5.0%) had reached PASI 100 in the continuing 100mg and increasing to 
200mg groups respectively. 
Patients with high body weight and with higher disease burden 
Additionally, during the assessment, the applicant provided further data on patients with higher 
disease burden and body weight. The CHMP agreed that these data could be supportive of a 
recommendation of 200 mg dose regimen in these patients in order to achieve higher efficacy. A 
specific recommendation was introduced for these subpopulations.

ADA 
Phase 2b or Phase 3 subjects treated continuously with tildrakizumab 100mg or 200mg in the TE-POS 
NAb positive (NAb-POS) category represented a small proportion, ~0.6% (8/1400) and 2.8% 
(22/780), of the evaluable population, through 12/16 weeks and through 52/64 weeks, respectively. 
Effect of ADA on Efficacy Endpoints- Treatment Emergent ADA Positive Subjects Compared to Negative 
and Inconclusive (Combined) at 12 Weeks in Phase 2b and Phase 3 
The proportion of subjects in Phase 2b and Phase 3 randomized to 100 mg and 200 mg in Part 1 who 
were categorized as TE-POS ((NAb-POS and NAb-NEG combined) who achieved PASI 75, PASI 90, 
PASI 100, or PGA was similar to the proportion of subjects who were categorized as negative and 
inconclusive (combined) at Week 12. 
Effect of ADA on the Percent Improvement in PASI Score through Week 12 by ADA Subject Category in 
Phase 2b and Phase 3 
In subjects treated with 100mg, the percent improvement in PASI score at Week 12 was similar for 
negative, inconclusive, Non-TE-POS NAb NEG, and TE-POS NAb-NEG subjects (75%, 80%, 76%, and

79%, respectively); Non-TE-POS NAb-POS and TE-POS NAb-POS subjects showed a marginally lower 
percent improvement (68% and 62%) in PASI score at Week 12. For subjects treated with 200 mg 
that were TE-POS NAb-POS (N=4), the percent improvement in PASI score was less (38%) relative to 
negative subjects (76%); and other positive subject categories showed PASI improvements which were 
comparable to negative subjects (range 81%-88%). The number of TE-POS NAb-POS subjects for the 
100 mg and 200 mg dose groups was small (N=4 for each dose levels), and caution should be 
exercised regarding interpretation. 
Moreover, the subjects in the negative and inconclusive categories showed similar percent 
improvement in PASI scores at Week 12, 75% and 80%, respectively, for 100 mg and 76% and 79%, 
respectively, for 200 mg. 
Effect of ADA on the Percent Improvement in PASI Score for the Full Duration of Trials by ADA Subject 
Category in Phase 2b and Phase 3 
The percent improvement of PASI score at Week 52 in subjects on 200 mg continuously was less for 
TE-POS NAb-POS subjects (77%) as compared to negative subjects (87%) and other positive 
categories (range 91% to 94%) For the percent improvement in PASI score at Week 52, it is worth 
noting that the number of TE-POS NAb-POS subjects with PASI data for the 100 mg and 200 mg 
groups was small (N=10 and N=12, respectively) and considerable caution should be exercised 
regarding interpretation. 
Notably, there was no difference between negative and inconclusive subjects with regard to PASI score 
improvement at Week 52; 91% and 86%, respectively for 100 mg and 87% and 88% for 200 mg, 
respectively. Note that, the number of inconclusive subjects was also small at the end of the trials, 
N=8 and N=25 for 100 mg and 200 mg, respectively.

The numbers of patients who were ADA positive is rather low in both groups however it is seen that 
patients who were TE –POS Nab POS had lower PASI 75 and PGA responses at week 52 and lower PGA 
responses compared with those who were Nab negative in both treatment arms. It is not clear whether 
the true incidence of ADA’s is clear as the serum level of Tildrakizumab affected the ADA assay, this 
could be more relevant for the higher dose of 200mgs.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Efficacy of Tildrakizumab is substantiated by a comprehensive data package that included one Phase 
2b trial (P05495) and 2 Phase 3 trials (P010 and P011). These clinical studies were randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial conducted in adults ≥ 18 years of age with 
moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic 
therapy.  
The development was in line with the CHMP Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products 
Indicated for the Treatment of Psoriasis (CHMP/EWP/2454/02 corr, effective June 2005). All clinical 
studies were GCP-compliant. 
The Phase 2b study (P05495) was a dose ranging study to identify the optimal SC dosing regimen for 
tildrakizumab. The trial consisted of 3 parts: Part 1 was a 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
treatment period to evaluate the optimal dose regimen (5 mg, 25 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg against 
placebo) for induction of response (Weeks 0 to 16), Part 2 was a 36-week, double-blind, treatment 
period to evaluate the optimal dose regimen for maintenance of response (Weeks 16 to 52), and Part 3 
was a 20-week washout period (Weeks 52 to 72).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 78/126 
 
 
 
 
 
The Phase 3 trials were designed to demonstrate the efficacy of tildrakizumab compared to placebo 
(Study P010 and P011) and/or an active comparator (Study P011).  
Study P010 was placebo-controlled and randomized 772 patients. The duration of the base study was 
up to 88 weeks for each subject. This included a 4-week screening period, a 12-week Part 1 period 
(Week 0 to Week 12), a 16-week Part 2 period (Week 12 to Week 28), a 36-week Part 3 period (Week 
28 to Week 64), and a 20-week follow-up period. In Part 1 patients were randomized on Day 1 to 
receive Tildrakizumab 200 mg subcutaneously (Arm A), Tildrakizumab 100 mg (Arm B) or 
Tildrakizumab placebo (Arm C). In Part 2 patients initially randomized to placebo (Arm C) were re-
randomized to receive either tildrakizumab 200 or 100 mg at Week 12 and 16. In Part 3 incorporated 
randomized withdrawal and retreatment design elements from week 28 and beyond, to formally assess 
the efficacy and safety of tildrakizumab maintenance dosing relative to the withdrawal of treatment in 
PASI 75 responders. Upon completion of Part 3, patients who were eligible may have entered the long-
term safety extension study that will assess the long-term safety/tolerability of tildrakizumab. 
In Study P011 the duration of the base study was up to 76 weeks for each patient. This was the only 
study in the development program of tildrakizumab, which used etanercept as comparator. It consisted 
of a 4-week screening period, a 12-week Part 1 period, a 16-week Part 2 period and a 24-week Part 3 
period. In Part 1 patients were randomized to receive tildrakizumab 200 mg (Arm A), tildrakizumab 
100 mg (Arm B), placebo (Arm C) or etanercept (Arm D). At Week 12, all patients initially randomized 
to placebo (Arm C) were re-randomized to receive tildrakizumab 100 mg or tildrakizumab 200 mg. At 
week 28 responders in Arm A were re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to tildrakizumab 200 mg or 
tildrakizumab 100 mg, Responders in Arm B continued to receive tildrakizumab 100 mg. Partial-
responders in Arm A continued to receive tildrakizumab 200 mg, while in Arm B they were re-
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to tildrakizumab 100 mg or tildrakizumab 200 mg. Partial responders and 
non-responders in Arm D were assigned to receive tildrakizumab 200 mg. Responders in Arm D were 
discontinued. 
Patients selected for the studies were adult males and females 18 years of age or older with a 
diagnosis of plaque psoriasis for more than 6 months and were candidates for phototherapy or 
systemic therapy. Disease severity was gated to moderate to severe by baseline scores of BSA 
involvement ≥10%, PASI score ≥12, PGA of at least moderate disease (≥3). This is in line with the 
CHMP guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products indicated for the treatment of psoriasis 
(CHMP/EWP/2454/02 corr). The exclusion criteria were designed to ensure patients safety. Excluded 
were patients with any infection including HIV, HCV and HBV, malignancies, hospitalisation due to CV 
events within 6 months and other organ dysfunctions.  The eligibility criteria are adequate for a patient 
population with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. 
The design of the studies, especially P011 was complex and included an active comparator, multiple 
re-randomization and withdrawal and retreatment arms, leading to high numbers of placebo injections 
needed to keep the blind. This can be considered to be the reason for the high number of protocol 
deviations in the category of study drug administration. However, the study design resulted in a good 
overview of the product characteristics for use in the clinical setting.  
In study P010 major protocol deviations were reported at a greater incidence in the informed consent 
category for 32.1% of patients. In Study P011 major deviations were reported for informed consent 
(326 deviations), investigational product administration or study treatment (240 deviations) and 
procedures or tests (212 deviations) category. Additionally, 175 patients have been excluded from the 
PP analysis population in this study mainly due to violations regarding the eligibility criteria related to 
the disease severity (i.e. PASI, PGA or BSA). GCP inspections for both pivotal phase 3 studies have 
been performed.  The applicant provided additional sensitivity analyses excluding those entries in order 
to quantify the relevance of these entries on the results of each study. There were 2 approaches, in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018

which affected entries have been considered as “Non-responder” or all patients with any entry affected 
have been excluded from the analyses. The results of these analyses showed only small differences 
regarding the results of the co-primary endpoints (PASI75 and PGA response). 
In study P011, there were high numbers of protocol deviations. The most common deviations were 
informed consent, administration of study drug and test or procedures. Although the applicant states 
that no patients were included in the study without a signed informed consent prior to participation. A 
total of 175 patients were excluded from the PP analysis population in Part 1 (N=140) or Part 2 
(N=167) of the base study. The most common reason patients were excluded from the PP population 
was due to not meeting the PASI, PGA, or BSA inclusion criteria. GCP inspections for both pivotal phase 
3 studies have been performed. Additional sensitivity analyses were presented by the applicant 
demonstrating that the protocol deviations in both studies had no meaningful effect on the results of 
the co-primary endpoints.  
Re-treatment with tildrakizumab after relapse was also effective. Patients who were re-treated after 
relapse during the withdrawal phase responded to re-initiation of their initial treatment.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The median baseline PASI and PGA score was similar across all treatment groups. Thirty five point 
eight percent (35.8%) of the patients had received prior phototherapy, 41.1% had received prior 
conventional systemic therapy, 17.5% had received prior biologic therapy for the treatment of 
psoriasis, and 8.3% had received at least one anti-TNF alpha agent. A total of 15.4% of study patients 
had a history of psoriatic arthritis.  
Patients were not allowed concomitant moderate to high potency topical steroids or systemic steroids 
which may be useful in practice, it is unclear whether any additional benefit would be demonstrated or 
indeed safe to use tildrakizumab in combination with these medicinal products. 
The results of the Phase 2b dose ranging study P05495 show a dose-dependent, statistically 
significant improvement in PASI score. With regards to the primary endpoint the highest percentage of 
patients achieved a PASI 75% response at week 16 in the tildrakizumab 200 mg with 74.42%, followed 
by the tildrakizumab 100 mg group 66.29% compared to placebo with 4.44%. Similar results are 
shown by the key secondary endpoints. Therefore, the selection of the tildrakizumab 200 and 100 mg 
for the evaluation in the pivotal phase 3 studies is conclusive. 
The proportion of patients in Study P010 achieving a PASI 75 response at Week 12 was significantly 
higher in the tildrakizumab 100 mg (63.8%) and tildrakizumab 200 mg (62.3%) groups compared with 
the placebo (5.8%) group (p<0.001 each). Regarding the second co-primary endpoint, the proportion 
of patients with a PGA score of “clear” or “minimal”, with at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline at 
Week 12 was significantly greater in the tildrakizumab 100 mg (57.9%) and tildrakizumab 200 mg 
(59.1%) groups compared with the placebo (7.1%) group (p<0.001 each). The key secondary 
endpoints PASI 90 and 100 at week 12 as well as the other secondary endpoints support the efficacy 
shown for the co-primary endpoints.  
The proportion of patients in Study P011 achieving a PASI 75 response at Week 12 was significantly 
greater in the tildrakizumab 100 mg (61.2%) and tildrakizumab 200 mg (65.6%) groups compared 
with the placebo (5.8%) and the etanercept (48.2%) group (p<0.001 each). Regarding the second co-
primary endpoint, the proportion of patients with a PGA score of “clear” or “minimal”, with at least a 2 
grade reduction from baseline at Week 12 was significantly greater in the tildrakizumab 100 mg 
(54.7%) and tildrakizumab 200 mg (59.2%) groups compared with the placebo (4.5%) and etanercept 
Assessment report

(47.6%) group (p<0.001 each). The key secondary endpoints PASI 90 and 100 at week 12 as well as 
the other secondary endpoints support the efficacy shown for the co-primary endpoints. 
The onset of efficacy is not as fast compared to recently approved Il-17 inhibitors showing the best 
results for PASI 100 not earlier as week 44.The difference between the tildrakizumab dosing groups 
was small at the beginning of the treatment resulting in similar efficacy results. At week 16 the 
tildrakizumab 200 mg group begins to show slightly higher efficacy with regards to PASI 75, 90 and 
100. Although, the response rates over time are favorable for both doses. The rate of PASI 75 
responders remained over 90% from week 32 onward with 95.5% for the 100 mg and 98.3% for the 
200 mg tildrakizumab group at week 32. The rate of PASI 100 responders at week 36 reached 40.2% 
in the tildrakizumab 200mg continuous group and 36.8% in the tildrakizumab 100 mg continuous 
group. 
In Study P011, the efficacy of tildrakizumab in etanercept non-responders was evaluated. Patients who 
were classified as non-responder or partial-responder (did not reach PASI 75 on etanercept at Week 
28) were switched to Ilumya 200 mg after a washout period of 4 weeks. After 3 doses of tildrakizumab 
200 mg (Week 52), 81.4% had achieved PASI 75 response. 
Overall, since there was no significant difference in efficacy among the two dose regimen, the CHMP 
considered more adequate to recommend the lower dose regimen, i.e. 100 mg.  
Additionally, during the assessment, the applicant provided further data on patients with higher 
disease burden and body weight. The CHMP agreed that these data could be supportive of a 
recommendation of 200 mg dose regimen in these patients in order to achieve higher efficacy. A 
specific recommendation was introduced for these subpopulations.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Tildrakizumab demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in phase 2b and in the phase 3 clinical 
studies. The 100mg and 200mg doses carried forward to phase 3 studies are considered generally 
justified. 
The results of the pivotal phase 3 studies show that tildrakizumab is effective in improving clinically 
relevant sign and symptoms of patient with plaque psoriasis. The proportion of patients achieving PASI 
75, 90, 100 and PGA response at different time points was higher in the tildrakizumab treatment 
groups compared to placebo and etanercept. The CHMP considered more appropriate to recommend 
the lower dosing regimen of tildrakizumab of100 mg at weeks 0, 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter. 
However, based on the efficacy and PK data, recommendation of 200mg for higher weight patients 
(>90 kg) and for patients with higher disease burden was further discussed and the CHMP agreed that 
it may be recommended in these patients. This is reflected in the posology section of the SmPC. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The clinical development program included evaluations of tildrakizumab (also known as MK-3222 and 
SCH900222) across 9 completed trials: 6 Phase 1 trials - 3 in healthy subjects (P05661, P05776, 
P06306), 2 in subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (P05382 and P009), and 1 in subjects 
with Crohn’s disease (P05839). There was one Phase 2b trial - P05495 (P003) and two Phase 3 trials - 
P010 and P011. The Phase 1 trials enrolled healthy subjects (P05661, P05776, and P06306), patients 
with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (P05382 and P009) and patients with active Crohn’s disease 
(P05839). The Phase 2b and Phase 3 trials were conducted in the target subject population with 
moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. With the response to D120 LoQ the applicant submitted 
new safety data for the long term extension study up to a cut-off date of 27 May 2017.

For the Phase 1 trials the demographic data, exposure data, and AE summary data have b 
een integrated as follows to facilitate the comparison of the short-term safety profile for tildrakizumab: 
• 
• 
Integrated AE data from 3 trials in healthy subjects (P05661, P05776, and P06306). 
Integrated AE data from 2 trials in subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (P05382 
and P009). 
•  AE data from the Crohn’s Disease trial (P05839).  
For the Phase 2b (P05495) and Phase 3 trials (P010, P011), the demographic data, exposure data, and 
AE summary data have been integrated to facilitate the comparison of the long-term safety profile for 
tildrakizumab. These trials were similar in study design and eligibility criteria, but differed by study 
duration and dose groups. The safety data from Phase 2b and Phase 3 trials were integrated and 
analysed using the following 2 general analytical approaches: 
• 
• 
Analyses of rates of AEs during the placebo-controlled periods of the trials. 
Analyses of rates of AEs over the entire base periods of the trials adjusted for duration of 
exposure (ie, per 100 subject-years of follow-up). 
Patient exposure 
A total of 1994 subjects with psoriasis received any dose of tildrakizumab at some point during the 
Phase IIb/III trial periods. The exposure to the drug is considered sufficient in accordance with the ICH 
E1 Guideline requirements (‘The Extent of Population Exposure to Assess Clinical Safety for Drugs 
Intended for Long-term Treatment of Non-Life-Threatening Conditions’ CPMP/ICH/375/95). (42 
patients received at least the 5 mg dose; 123 patients received at least the 25 mg dose; 1083 patients 
received at least the 100 mg dose; and 1041 patients received at least the 200 mg dose).  
The mean duration of treatment was 53.9 weeks for tildrakizumab during the base trial periods, 
corresponding to an exposure of 2059.04 subject-years.

(20 week follow up) 
Regarding particular sub-groups, the exposure is low, however adequate in the elderly population 
(>65years of age). Exposure is inadequate in moderate to severe renal impairment, elderly >75years 
of age, immunocompromised subjects and subjects with hepatic impairment. There is inadequate data 
in pregnancy and lactation and the paediatric population. These sub-groups are represented 
accordingly in the SmPC. 
New safety data from the long term extension study up to a cut-off date of 27 May-2017 were 
submitted with the responses to the D120 LoQ. Of the original 1236 subjects who were randomised to 
the 100 mg or 200 mg treatment arms in the preceding period of the studies, and continued on these 
treatments in the extension period, there were 620 subjects in the tildrakizumab100 mg arm and 616 
subjects to the tildrakizumab 200 mg arm. Overall, of these 1236 original subjects, 1055 subjects were 
continuing at the time of the 27 May 2017 cut-off date, comprising 520 subjects in the 100 mg group 
and 535 in the 200 mg group: 181 subjects had discontinued.

Pooling Strategy 
The Pooling Strategy included different pools of safety data: Phase 2 and Phase 3: Placebo-controlled 
Safety Pool (16 weeks for P05495 and 12 weeks for P010 and P011), Phase 3: Placebo-controlled 
Safety Pool (12 weeks), Phase 2 and Phase 3: Base Period Safety Pool (52 weeks for P05495 and 
P011, and 64 weeks for P010) 
Adverse events 
Integrated data from the Phase 2b (P05495) and Phase 3 trials (P010, P011) were evaluated by the 
following two general analytical approaches: 
• 
• 
Analyses of percentages of pooled AEs during the placebo-controlled periods of the trials 
Analyses of rates of pooled AEs over the entire base period of the trials adjusted for duration of 
exposure (ie, per 100 subject-years of follow-up) 
Phase 1 trials 
Phase 1 trials, were conducted in healthy subjects (P05661, P05775, P06306), patients with moderate-
to-severe psoriasis (P05382, P009) and patients with Crohn’s Disease (P05389). More than 60% of 
participants in each study reported at least one Adverse Events. Common adverse events reported 
were headache with 27.2% in the healthy subjects, 17.3% in patients with psoriasis, 13% in patients 
with Crohn´s disease and infections with 27.2% in the healthy subjects, 14.7% in patients with 
psoriasis. 
Study P010 
During Part 1 of study P010, the proportion of patients with one or more adverse events was 
comparable between the treatment groups (48.1%, 47.2%, and 42.2% in the placebo, tildrakizumab 
100 mg, and tildrakizumab 200 mg groups, respectively). Adverse events were reported most 
frequently for the Infections and Infestations SOC (20.4%), the proportion of patients with drug-
related adverse events in Part 1 was similar between treatment groups (6.5%, 8.7%, and 7.8% in the 
placebo, tildrakizumab 100 mg, and tildrakizumab 200 mg groups, respectively). During Part 2, the 
proportion of patients with one or more adverse events was comparable between the 2 treatment 
groups (43.9% and 39.7% in the tildrakizumab 100 mg and tildrakizumab 200 mg groups, 
respectively). During Part 3, the proportion of patients with one or more adverse events was 
comparable between the 2 treatment groups (68.7% and 69.4% in the tildrakizumab 100 mg and 
Assessment report

tildrakizumab 200 mg groups, respectively). After adjustment for exposure, the incidence rate of 
patients with one or more adverse events during the base study was comparable between the 
tildrakizumab 100 mg group and the tildrakizumab 200 mg group (72.9 and 73.3 patients with adverse 
events per 100 patient years, respectively). The incidence rate in the placebo group was higher with 
128.3 patients with adverse events per 100 patient years.  Similar to the individual parts of the base 
study, adverse events were reported most frequently for the Infections and Infestations SOC (73.8, 
44.8, and 47.4 patients with adverse events per 100 patient years in the placebo, tildrakizumab 100 
mg, and tildrakizumab 200 mg groups, respectively) and the most common adverse event was 
nasopharyngitis. The incidence rate of patients with drug-related adverse events during the base study 
was numerically greater in the placebo group compared with the tildrakizumab groups. After 
adjustment for exposure, the incidence rates of patients with drug-related adverse events during the 
base study were similar in the tildrakizumab 100 mg and tildrakizumab 200 mg groups (15.7 and 16.8 
patients with adverse events per 100 patient years, respectively. The incidence rate in the placebo 
group was numerically higher (27.0 patients with adverse events per 100 patient years). The most 
common drug-related adverse events were upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. 
Study P011 
In Part 1 of Study P011, the proportion of patients with one or more adverse events was comparable 
between 2 of the 4 treatment groups (55.1% in the placebo group and 54.0% in the etanercept group) 
and numerically lower in the tildrakizumab groups (44.3% in the tildrakizumab 100 mg group and 
49.4% in the tildrakizumab 200 mg group). In the General Disorders and Administration Site 
Conditions SOC, the incidence of adverse events in the etanercept group was numerically greater 
mainly due to a difference in incidence rates for the specific adverse event of injection site erythema. 
In the Nervous System Disorders SOC, the incidence of adverse events in the placebo group was 
numerically lower that the incidence observed in the tildrakizumab 100 mg, tildrakizumab 200 mg and 
etanercept groups (4.5%, 7.8%, 10.2%, and 8.6%, respectively) with headache being the most 
common adverse event reported in this SOC (3.8%, 4.9%, 4.8%, 4,8%). During Part 2, the 
proportions of patients with one or more adverse events were similar and numerically lower for 
patients in the tildrakizumab treatment groups (47.4% in the tildrakizumab 100 mg group and 44.7% 
in the tildrakizumab 200 mg group) than the etanercept group (56.7%). In Part 3 the overall 
incidences of adverse events by SOC were similar in the tildrakizumab 100 mg (54.6%) and 
tildrakizumab 200 mg (56.8%) groups. The exposure adjusted incidence rates of patients with adverse 
events and drug-related adverse events by SOC during the base study were higher in the placebo and 
etanercept groups compared to tildrakizumab groups. Drug-related adverse events were reported most 
frequently for the General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions SOC (40.4, 6.4, 8.4, and 40.4 
patients with adverse events per 100 patient years in the placebo, 100 mg, 200 mg, and etanercept 
groups, respectively) mainly due to a difference in incidence rates for the specific adverse events of 
injection site erythema and injection site reaction. Adverse events were reported most frequently for 
the Infections and Infestations SOC and the most common adverse event was nasopharyngitis. 
Phase 2b/3 Trials - Placebo-controlled Safety Pool 
This safety pool makes comparisons between tildrakizumab and placebo over the placebo-controlled 
period (16 weeks for P05495 and 12 weeks for P010 and P011). Data are pooled across trials and 
treatment groups and the presentation of treatment arms. Etanercept 50 mg is presented for P011 
only. 
One or more AEs was reported in 339 patients (47.9%) receiving tildrakizumab 200 mg, 340 patients 
(48.2%) receiving tildrakizumab 100 mg, 191 patients (53.8%) receiving placebo, and 169 patients

(54.0%) receiving etanercept. The incidence of drug-related AEs was similar for patients receiving 
tildrakizumab 200 mg (14.0%), tildrakizumab 100 mg (14.8%), and placebo (13.2%), and was higher 
in patients receiving etanercept (29.4%). General disorders and administration site conditions were 
more frequent with etanercept (20.8%) than with placebo (8.5%), tildrakizumab 200 mg (6.8%) or 
tildrakizumab 100 mg (8.7%), primarily due to a higher incidence of the specific AEs of injection site 
erythema, injection site reaction, injection site pain, and injection site swelling, and for Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders, which were more frequent with placebo (11.8%) than with 
tildrakizumab 200 mg (6.2%), tildrakizumab 100 mg (5.7%) or etanercept (5.4%), primarily due to a 
higher incidence of the specific AEs of pruritus and psoriasis. The most frequently reported SOC was 
Infections and infestations. The incidence of AEs in this SOC was similar across treatment groups.  
Drug Related Adverse Events 
In the placebo-controlled safety pool, the incidence of drug-related AEs was comparable for the 
tildrakizumab 200 mg group (99 patients, 14.0%) and the tildrakizumab 100 mg group (104 patients, 
14.8%) compared with the placebo group (47 patients, 13.2%) and was higher in the etanercept group 
(92 patients, 29.4%) compared with the other groups. The incidence of drug-related AEs was generally 
low across groups for the individual SOCs and specific AEs. Drug-related AEs were most frequent in the 
General disorders and administration site conditions where the incidence was comparable for 
tildrakizumab 200 mg, 100 mg and placebo (4.1%, 4.7% and 4.5%, respectively) and higher for 
etanercept (18.2%) and Infections and infestations SOCs where the incidence was generally 
comparable for tildrakizumab 200 mg, 100 mg and placebo (5.9%, 5.4% and 4.8%, respectively) and 
higher for etanercept (9.3%). Nasopharyngitis and headache were the most frequent drug-related AEs 
across treatment groups.

Phase 2b/3 Trials - Base Period Safety Pool 
This safety pool supports the exposure-adjusted summary of AEs for the base period. It includes 
pooled data for the Phase 2 and Phase 3 base periods (52 weeks for P05495 and P011, and 64 weeks 
for P010) across trials and treatment groups and the presentation of treatment arms is as follows: 
tildrakizumab 200 mg, tildrakizumab 100 mg, continuous exposure tildrakizumab 100 mg, continuous 
exposure tildrakizumab 200 mg, placebo, tildrakizumab 100/200 mg (combining patients who receive 
tildrakizumab 100 mg or tildrakizumab 200 mg) and continuous exposure tildrakizumab 100/200 mg 
(combining patients who receive tildrakizumab 100 mg or tildrakizumab 200 mg throughout the base 
period). “Continuous exposure” defines patients who received the same dose throughout the base 
period without re-randomization to a different dose. 
After adjustment for duration of exposure, the AE incidence rate per 100 subject-years was lower for 
patients receiving tildrakizumab 200 mg (79.34) and tildrakizumab 100 mg (77.03) compared with 
patients receiving placebo (153.52) or etanercept (148.61). The Adverse Event rate per 100 subject-
years was the highest in the Infections and infestations SOC across all treatment groups, but was 
lower for the tildrakizumab 200 mg (52.64) and tildrakizumab 100 mg (48.88) groups than for the 
placebo (79.50) and etanercept (86.04) groups. Nasopharyngitis was the most common individual AE 
within the Infections and infestations SOC for all treatment groups. The Musculoskeletal and connective 
tissue disorders SOC had the next highest AE rate per 100 subject-years across treatment groups with 
18.30 in the tildrakizumab 200 mg group, 18.33 in the tildrakizumab 100 mg group, 20.56 in the 
placebo group, and 28.68 in the etanercept group. The most common individual AEs in this SOC were 
back pain and arthralgia. The following most frequent SOC was Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
which had AE rate per 100 subject-years across treatment groups of 13.13 in the tildrakizumab 200 
mg group, 13.92 in the tildrakizumab 100 mg group, 31.53 in the placebo group, and 28.03 in the 
etanercept group. Pruritus was the most common individual AE within the Skin and subcutaneous 
tissue disorders SOC across treatment groups. 
Drug-related Adverse Events 
Across treatment groups, the exposure-adjusted AE rate per 100 subject-years for drug-related events 
was highest in the Infections and infestations SOC with 12.12 in the tildrakizumab 100 mg group, 
15.61 in the tildrakizumab 200 mg group, 18.73 in the placebo group and 29.33 in the etanercept 
group. The most common individual adverse event across groups was Nasopharyngitis with an 
exposure-adjusted rate per 100 subject-years of 5.01, 6.46, 3.20, and 13.69, respectively.

In the base period safety pool, the rate of AEs leading to discontinuation per 100 subject-years was 
low overall and similar for the tildrakizumab 200 mg (2.15), the tildrakizumab 100 mg (2.20) and 
placebo (2.28) groups, but was higher for the etanercept group (5.87) compared with the other 
groups.  
The applicant also presents a Phase 3 Extension Safety Pool. This Pool includes the Phase 3 extension 
data up to the targeted cut-off dates of 12-Jun-2016 (P010) and 21-Jun-2016 (P011). Tildrakizumab 
100 mg and tildrakizumab 200 mg were pooled across trials. Additionally, updated safety data up to 
27-May-2017 are provided. 
Updated Phase 3 extension safety pool 
By the cut-off date of 27 May 2017, cumulatively 954 subjects reported one or more adverse events 
compared to 797 subjects in April 2016. Compared with the 2016 data there was an increase in 
number of subjects who discontinued study medication due to an adverse event across both treatment 
arms (from 13 to 22 subjects in the 100 mg arm and from 3 subjects to 13 subjects in the 200 mg 
arm). 
Therefore, there was an increase in the number of subjects experiencing adverse events when 
cumulative data up to May 2017 was compared with the earlier cut-off in April 2016. This increase in 
numbers of AEs is expected when data are observed along time (cumulative data). 
Table 36: Subjects With Adverse Events (Incidence ≥ 2% in One or More Treatment Groups) 
Phase 3: Extension Safety Pool All Subjects as Treated 
At the cut-off date of 27 May 2017, the incidence of subjects with one or more drug-related AEs 
increased in both treatment arms (from 14.8% to 17.9% in the 100 mg arm and from 16.6% to 19.0% 
in the 200 mg arm). Overall, the incidence of drug-related AEs was generally low across both 
treatment arms for the specific SOCs and AEs. At the cut-off date of 27 May 2017, drug-related AEs 
were most frequent in the Infections and infestations SOC.

Drug-related adverse events 
At the cut-off date of 27 May 2017, the incidence of subjects with one or more drug-related AEs 
increased in both treatment arms (from 14.8% to 17.9% in the 100 mg arm and from 16.6% to 19.0% 
in the 200 mg arm). Overall, the incidence of drug-related AEs was generally low across both 
treatment arms for the specific SOCs and AEs. At the cut-off date of 27 May 2017, drug-related AEs 
were most frequent in the Infections and infestations SOC. A similar pattern observed at the cut-off 
date of 15 April 2016. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Tier 1 Adverse Events 
Safety parameters or adverse events of special interest that were identified a priori constituted the 
“Tier 1” safety endpoints. These endpoints were based on tildrakizumab mechanism of action and 
specific risks in the target subject population. The Tier 1 safety endpoints included: severe infections, 
malignancies, non-melanoma skin cancer, melanoma skin cancer, MACE, drug-related hypersensitivity. 
Study P010 
After adjustment for exposure, the incidence rates of severe infections and confirmed extended MACE 
events were numerically greater in the tildrakizumab 200 mg group compared with the placebo and 
tildrakizumab 100 mg groups. No adverse events of melanoma skin cancer were reported during the 
base study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 90/126 
 
 
 
 
 
Study P011 
After adjustment for exposure, the incidence rates of specific Tier 1 adverse events during the base 
study were similar in the placebo, tildrakizumab 100 mg, tildrakizumab 200 mg, and etanercept 
groups. 
Tier 2 Adverse Events 
The following pre-specified safety/tolerability endpoints were considered Tier 2 regardless of the 
number of patients in any treatment group:  adverse events, drug-related adverse events, serious 
adverse events, discontinuation due to adverse events, discontinuation due to drug-related adverse 
events, specific adverse events, deaths, adverse events associated with ADA, confirmed MACE and 
confirmed thrombotic/embolic/ischemic CV adverse events. 
All AE summary measures were treated as Tier 2 (ie, subjects with one or more AEs, drug-related AEs, 
SAEs, serious drug-related AEs, deaths, discontinuations due to AEs, discontinuations due to SAEs, 
discontinuations due to drug-related AEs, and discontinuations due to drug-related SAEs). In addition, 
confirmed MACE and confirmed thrombotic/embolic/ischemic cardiovascular events were also 
considered Tier 2 AEs. In general the overview given by the pooled Tier 2 data is useful. In the 
extension safety pool the general incidence of any adverse event was comparable between doses. AEs 
relating to individual categories such as discontinuations, SAEs and MACE report higher incidence in 
the 100mg dose which is favourable for the proposed 200mg dose. 
Study P010 
After adjustment for exposure, the incidence rates of serious adverse events, discontinuation due to 
adverse events, discontinuation due to drug-related adverse events, and confirmed CV adverse events 
were numerically greater in the tildrakizumab 200 mg group compared with the placebo and 
tildrakizumab 100 mg groups. In contrast, higher incidences of patients with adverse events, drug-
related adverse events, and adverse events not including worsening of psoriasis were observed in the 
placebo group, as compared with the tildrakizumab 100 mg and 200 mg groups. 
Study P011 
After adjustment for exposure, the incidence rates of patients with Tier 2 adverse events during the 
base study were generally similar in the tildrakizumab 100 mg and tildrakizumab 200 mg groups. In 
the etanercept and placebo groups, higher incidences of patients with adverse events, drug-related 
adverse events, serious adverse events, who discontinued due to an adverse event, and adverse 
events not including worsening of psoriasis were observed. 
General disorders and administration site conditions were more frequent with etanercept (20.8%) than 
with placebo (8.5%), tildrakizumab 200 mg (6.8%) or tildrakizumab 100 mg (8.7%), due to a higher 
incidence of the specific AEs of injection site erythema, injection site reaction, injection site pain, and 
injection site swelling, and for Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, which were more frequent with 
placebo (11.8%) than with tildrakizumab 200 mg (6.2%), tildrakizumab 100 mg (5.7%) or etanercept 
(5.4%), due to a higher incidence of the specific AEs of pruritus and psoriasis. 
The Applicant confirmed that during clinical development there were no adverse events reported for 
erythrodermic psoriasis, inverse psoriasis, palmoplantar psoriasis or worsening or exacerbation of 
psoriasis during the Phase 2 or Phase 3 studies. The only psoriasis-type adverse events reported under 
the SOC Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders were psoriasis, pustular psoriasis and guttate 
psoriasis. There were few subjects who experienced adverse events related to psoriatic disease, and 
discontinuation of tildrakizumab treatment did not lead to rebound.

SIB 
Safety information pertaining to suicidal ideation and behaviour (SIB) across the Tildrakizumab 
development program was reviewed for tildrakizumab in 2015 when the presumptive signal for SIB in 
the brodalumab development program became public knowledge. This review identified no reports 
describing a completed suicide, and 2 reports (one from a Phase one trial, one from a Phase 3 trial) 
describing non-fatal SIB events, across the entire tildrakizumab development program (described 
below). In studies P003, P010 and P011, for the base period safety pool, the incidence of suicide 
attempt was reported in 1/1039 ( 0.1%, CI 0.0-0.5 ) patients. 
The applicant included SIB in the RMP. However, new cases of SIB including 2 cases of completed 
suicide were reported in the updated long term extension safety pool. One case of completed suicide 
was reported for a subject with a medical history of anxiety, psoriasis, attention deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder, who died due to an SAE of completed suicide (self-inflicted gunshot in the head) on Day 
1227. No prior history of suicide attempts or family history of suicide was reported by the subject's 
family. Relevant concomitant medications included alprazolam and atomoxetine. No other adverse 
events were reported during the study.  
A second case of completed suicide for a subject with a medical history of psoriasis and former tobacco 
user was reported to have died due to the SAE of completed suicide (jumping of roof) on Day 1306. 
Relevant concomitant medications included methylphenidate hydrochloride, amphetamine aspartate 
(+) amphetamine sulfate (+) dextroamphetamine saccharate (+) dextroamphetamine sulfate, and 
pregabalin. This reported case has been adjudicated post-hoc, as “completed suicide”. Additionally all 
reported cases of completed suicide have been implemented and the SIB event rate has been 
recalculated as requested by the CHMP/PRAC. The incidence rate of completed suicide per 100 subject-
years for tildrakizumab is 0.05 and an association between psoriasis and SIB has been thoroughly 
described in several studies for the overall psoriasis population. No causal association between the 
treatment with tildrakizumab and the completed suicides has been established. The reported cases of 
completed suicide are considered not related to the treatment with tildrakizumab although this can 
never be excluded completely. This is therefore considered as a potential risk in the safety concerns.

Serious adverse events and deaths 
Study P010 
In Part 1 of Study P010, serious adverse were reported for 1 (0.6%) patient in the placebo group, 5 
(1.6%) patients in the tildrakizumab 100 mg group and 8 (2.6%) patients in the tildrakizumab 200 mg 
group of which 3 serious adverse events resulted in discontinuation of study medication during Part 1.  
Serious adverse events in Part 2 were reported for 7 (1.9%) patients in the tildrakizumab 100 mg 
group and 8 (2.2%) patients in the tildrakizumab 200 mg group. Four serious adverse events resulted 
in discontinuation of study medication: One squamous cell carcinoma of skin (tildrakizumab 100 mg), 
one bone tuberculosis (tildrakizumab 200 mg), one case of psoriasis (tildrakizumab 200 mg) and one 
patient with pancreatic carcinoma (tildrakizumab 200 mg). During Part 3 serious adverse events were 
reported for 14 (4.4%) patients in the tildrakizumab 100 mg group and 21 (5.8%) patients in the 
tildrakizumab 200 mg group. 
The incidence rates of patients with drug-related serious adverse events during all parts of the study 
were similar in the placebo, tildrakizumab 100 mg and tildrakizumab 200 mg groups (1.2, 0, and 1.0 
patients with adverse events per 100 patient years, respectively).

Study P011 
Serious adverse events during Part 1 were reported 2.6% of patients in the placebo group, 1.3% in the 
tildrakizumab 100 mg group, 1.9% in the tildrakizumab 200 mg group and 2.2% in the etanercept 
group. The incidences of overall serious adverse events by SOC were similar in the tildrakizumab 100 
mg, tildrakizumab 200 mg, etanercept, and placebo groups. Serious adverse events during Part 2 were 
reported for 2.8% of the patients in the tildrakizumab 100 mg group, 2.2% in the tildrakizumab 200 
mg group and 4.8% in the etanercept group. Serious adverse events during Part 3 were reported for 
4.6% in the tildrakizumab 100 mg group and 3.7% patients in the tildrakizumab 200 mg group. 
0.5% of the patients in the tildrakizumab 100 mg group (1 bladder transitional cell carcinoma and 1 
thyroid cancer) and 0.3% in the tildrakizumab 200 mg group (1 breast cancer) reported a serious 
drug-related adverse event during Part 3. 
After adjustment for exposure, the incidence rate of patients with serious adverse events during the 
base study was higher in the placebo and etanercept groups (11.5 and 13 patients with serious 
adverse events per 100 patient years, respectively) compared with the tildrakizumab 100 mg and 
tildrakizumab 200 mg groups (6.6 and 6.2 patients with serious adverse events per 100 patient year, 
respectively).  
Drug-Related Serious Adverse Events 
The incidence rate of patients with serious drug-related adverse events during the base study was 
comparable between the tildrakizumab 100 mg group and the tildrakizumab 200 mg group (0.4 and 
0.7 patients with serious drug-related adverse events per 100 patient years, respectively). The 
incidence rate in the etanercept group was 3.3 patients with serious drug-related adverse events per 
100 patient years. 
Table 41: Subjects With Serious Drug-Related Adverse Events P011 Base Study: Adjusted for 
Exposure 
Phase 2b and Phase 3 Base Period Safety Pool 
The rate of SAEs per 100 patient-years in the Phase 2b and Phase 3 Base Period Safety Pool was 
similar for the tildrakizumab 200 mg group at 7.21 and the tildrakizumab 100 mg group at 5.81

compared with the placebo group at 6.40, but was higher for the etanercept group at 13.04. Overall 
the SAE rate was low across treatment groups for the specific SOCs and AEs. No SOC had an SAE rate 
of more than 1.61 patients with events per 100 patient-years with the exception of the Neoplasms 
benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) SOC. Within the Neoplasms SOC, the 
highest incidence rate per 100 patient-years was noted for the etanercept group with 3.26 compared 
to placebo with 1.37, tildrakizumab 100mg with 1.50 and tildrakizumab 200 mg with 1.08. The rate for 
the continuous tildrakizumab groups was even lower. 
The rate of drug-related SAEs per 100 patient-years was low for the tildrakizumab 200 mg group 
(0.97), the tildrakizumab 100 mg group (0.30) and the placebo group (0.91), compared with the 
etanercept group (3.26). The highest drug-related SAE rate across groups was noted for the Infections 
and infestations SOC. 
Table 42: Subjects with Serious and Drug-Related Adverse Events Exposure Adjusted (Based 
on 20-Week Follow-up) Phase 2 and 3:  Base Period Safety Pool (All Subjects as Treated) 
The proportion of subjects with serious adverse events was low in the tildrakizumab group and similar 
to that for the placebo group and most SAEs reported in subjects exposed to tildrakizumab were single 
events.  
In the base period safety pool, the SAE rate per 100 subject-years was similar for the tildrakizumab 
200 mg group at 7.21 and the tildrakizumab 100 mg group at 5.81 compared with the placebo group 
at 6.40, but was higher for the etanercept group at 13.04. With the exception of the Neoplasms 
benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) SOC, no SOC had an SAE rate of more 
than 1.61 subjects with events per 100 subject-years. The drug-related SAE rate per 100 subject-
years across groups for the tildrakizumab 200 mg group was (0.97), the tildrakizumab 100 mg group 
(0.30) and the placebo group (0.91), compared with the etanercept group (3.26). The highest drug-
related SAE rate across groups was noted for the Infections and infestations SOC. No SOC or specific 
drug-related SAE had an exposure-adjusted AE incidence rate of more than 1.30 subjects per 100 
subject-years.  
In general with respect to all Tier 1 adverse events, data from the pooled placebo-controlled periods 
did not demonstrate a significant higher rate of AEs for subjects treated with tildrakizumab compared 
with subjects treated with placebo. In the base period safety pool, AE incidence with exposure to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018

tildrakizumab 100mg and 200mg is comparable to exposure to continuous exposure to tildrakizumab 
100/200mg. In addition AEs are similar for both the 100mg and 200mg tildrakizumab doses in the 
extension safety pool. Although infection is a theoretical risk for tildrakizumab based on its immune-
modulating mechanism of action, data from the pooled safety data did not demonstrate a significant 
higher rate of infection. One event of TB which was deemed by the investigator as related to 
tildrakizumab was reported. Section 4.3 and 4.4 of the SmPC contain information regarding this 
identified risk: “Clinically important active infection (e.g. active tuberculosis, see section 4.4).” 
A low incidence of malignancy (including non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer) was reported in 
general throughout the safety data pools. However considering that numerically the majority of 
observed malignant diseases were observed in tildrakizumab treated patients, this raises concern, and 
the possible association with tildrakizumab treatment needs to be further investigated. Patients with 
psoriasis may have an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancers, in particular squamous cell 
carcinoma associated with psoralen-PUVA-therapy. Also the performed clinical trials are short 
considering the length of tumor induction, thus no conclusions concerning the possible aetiology of the 
observed malignant diseases can be made. The Applicant should submit the most recent follow up 
results regarding malignancies.  
Considering the overall increased risk for cancer development in psoriasis, the observed cases of 
malignant diseases and experience from other biological medical products, malignancies is considered 
an important potential risk in the RMP. 
The rate of CV events for tildrakizumab 100 mg group (0.40) is comparable to the placebo group 
(0.46) and lower than the etanercept group (0.65). This is also consistent with other biologics with the 
same indication. The rate of CV events for tildrakizumab 200 mg group (0.86) is low however higher 
than all other comparisons, the applicant is asked to further clarify and discuss biological plausibility. 
In the Phase III Extension Trials SAEs occurred in 7.4% of the 100mg group and 5% of the 200mg 
group. No SOC had a frequency of SAEs >1.3% in any treatment group. Most SAEs occurred in only 1 
or 2 subjects, with the exception of cholelithiasis, osteoarthritis and psoriatic arthropathy, which 
occurred in 3 subjects (all in the 100 mg dose group). No further details have been provided.  Drug-
related SAEs reported in the tildrakizumab 200 mg group (2 SAEs in 2 subjects, 0.3%) were infectious 
colitis and pneumonia. Drug-related SAEs reported in the tildrakizumab 100 mg group (12 SAEs in 11 
subjects, 1.8%) were thyrotoxic crisis, gastritis erosive, mesenteric artery thrombosis, appendicitis, 
gastroenteritis, staphylococcal infection, breast cancer, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, cerebral 
infarction, cerebrovascular accident, loss of consciousness, and hypertensive crisis.  The incidence of 
drug-related SAEs reported in the Phase III base period safety pool was low incidence with no trend for 
any specific safety signal.  
Updated Phase 3 extension safety pool 
At cut-off date 27 May 2017 an overall increase in the incidence of SAEs was reported in patients in the 
gastrointestinal disorders, infectious diseases, neoplasm and nervous disorders SOC. There were no 
new SAEs reported in the surgical and medical procedures SOC.  
10 patients discontinued in the 200 mg arm due to one or more SAE. Four of the 10 patients 
discontinued due to different SAEs of carcinoma the neoplasm SOC. Two patients discontinued due to 
asphyxia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders SOC and 4 patients discontinued due to SAEs of coronary artery disease, inappropriate 
antidiuretic hormone secretion, hepatitis E and transient ischaemic attack. In the 100 mg arm, 9 
patients discontinued due to 1 or more SAE. 7 patients discontinued due to different SAEs of carcinoma 
in the neoplasm SOC. One patient discontinued due to an SAE of diverticulitis and another subject 
discontinued due to an SAE of psoriatic arthropathy. One extra death was reported in each treatment 
arm at the cut-off date of 27 May 2017. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018

Drug-related SAEs reported in the 100 mg arm (13 SAEs in 10 patients) were angina pectoris, gastritis 
erosive, mesenteric artery thrombosis, diverticulitis, gastroenteritis, pneumonia, diffuse large B-cell, 
metastatic carcinoma of the bladder, non-hodgkin's lymphoma, carotid artery stenosis, cerebral 
infarction, loss of consciousness and hypertensive crisis. Drug-related SAEs reported in the 200 mg 
arm (7 SAEs in 6 patients) were gastric polyps, large intestine polyp, appendicitis, infectious colitis, 
peritonitis, pneumonia mycoplasmal, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
Deaths 
Phase 1 Trials 
There were no deaths reported in the 6 Phase 1 trials involving tildrakizumab (P05661, P05776, 
P06306, P05382, P009 and P05839). 
Phase 2b/3 Trials 
A total of 7 patients experienced fatal AEs during the base trial periods:  
1.  Aneurysm ( tildrakizumab 200 mg) 
2.  Unknown cause ( tildrakizumab 100 mg) 
3.  cardiomyopathy alcoholic and steatohepatitis (tildrakizumab 100 mg) 
4.  acute myeloid leukaemia (tildrakizumab 100 mg) 
5.  respiratory arrest (tildrakizumab 100 mg) 
6.  myocardial infarction (tildrakizumab 100 mg) 
7.  sepsis (etanercept in Part 1, switched to tildrakizumab 200 mg in Part 3) 
None of the 7 deaths in patients receiving tildrakizumab was causally-related to tildrakizumab. All 
patients had related risk-factors in their medical history. Two of the deaths occurred in patients with a 
history of alcohol abuse, which is strongly considered to be a likely contributory factor in the aetiology 
of the fatal events. Two occurred in patients who were diagnosed with malignancies. 3 deaths occurred 
in patients with known cardiovascular risk factors who experienced events that were adjudicated as 
fatal MACE events. 
The new cumulative listing with a cut-off date of 27 May 2017 now includes a further 2 cases of death, 
in addition to the 7 already reported: one patient due to intracranial haemorrhage and another who 
completed suicide. Finally, the coding of the AE of one patient was changed from the initial code of 
accidental death (at cut-off date 15 April 2016) to asphyxia (at cut-off date 27 May 2017). One 
additional case of completed suicide was reported during the long term extension period. 
A second case of completed suicide was reported during the long term extension. However this case 
was not adjudicated by the blinded adjudication committee at the time the responses were submitted.

Laboratory findings 
Phase I- Healthy subjects (P05661, P05775, P06306) 
There are no integrated analyses for laboratory safety data for the Phase 1 program. All descriptive 
summaries of laboratory safety data, were included in the individual CSRs. There were no clinically 
meaningful trends for changes in laboratory values within each trial.

Phase IIB/III 
In the integrated analysis of the Phase 2b/3 trials, it was reported that there were no meaningful 
differences in the results and flow of the laboratory values across the treatment groups. In the tabular 
listing of adverse events only few and single events from adverse laboratory values are seen. Events of 
clinical interest (ECI) for reports of elevated AST or ALT lab value that was ≥3 × the ULN and an 
elevated total bilirubin lab value that was ≥2 × ULN and, at the same time, an ALP lab value that was 
<2 × ULN, as determined by way of protocol-specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory 
testing, reported as a non-serious ECI. 
Change from Baseline in laboratory values over time is summarized for the base period safety pool in 
subjects with continuous exposure to tildrakizumab from week 4 to Week 52.  
Urinalysis was performed at the site via dipstick test. If the dipstick was positive (i.e., trace or above), 
a sample was sent to the central laboratory for microscopic examination Laboratory assessments were 
performed at various time-points during the Phase 2b/3 trials. Since the 3 trials had different visit 
schedules, for the purpose of comparison of results across time, only the trial visits common across the 
Phase 2b and Phase 3 trials were summarized. Common time-points for measurement of laboratory 
values across the Phase 2b (P05495) and Phase 3 (P010 and P011) trials during the base period were 
Weeks 0, 4, 12/16 (Week 12 [P010 and P011] and Week 16 [P05495]), 28, and 52. 
The Applicant provided, as requested, separate analyses for the placebo-controlled pool, the base 
period pool, and data from the extension period up to the most recent cut-off date of 27 May 2017. 
During 220 weeks of exposure only sporadic changes and low numbers of higher grades of toxicity 
occurred in all groups. No dose relationship and no safety concern can be identified.

The applicant presented further analyses, shift tables for changes from baseline in platelet count and 
neutrophils to below or above the respective reference ranges following treatment, as requested in 
D120 LoQ. For most patients no change in the laboratory values is seen. Numbers of patients with 
Grade 3 neutropenia are low and no dose trend could be determined. 
Safety in special populations 
Subgroup analyses results for the Phase 2b/3 placebo-controlled safety pool were presented in the 
dossier. The AE profile for tildrakizumab versus placebo and etanercept was evaluated for the following 
subgroups: 
•  Body weight (≤90 kg, >90kg) 
• 
Prior exposure to biologic therapy for psoriasis (Yes, No) 
•  Age (<65 years, ≥65 years) 
•  Gender (Female, Male) 
•  Race (White, Asian, Other Races) 
•  Region (North America, Europe, Rest of World) 
• 
• 
• 
Failure of at least one traditional systemic therapy (methotrexate, cyclosporine, phototherapy) 
(Yes, No) 
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist response among subjects previously treated for 
psoriasis (Yes, No) 
Psoriatic arthritis (Yes, No) 
•  Disease duration category (<15 median years, ≥15 median years) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 101/126 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Baseline BSA involvement category (<30%, ≥30%) 
•  Baseline PASI category (<20, ≥20) 
•  Baseline PGA category (≤3, ≥4) 
•  ADA status (Positive, Negative) 
In general, the AE profile was comparable for tildrakizumab, placebo, and etanercept across the 
subgroups of ≥65 years and gender. Drug-related AEs which were reported with a higher frequency in 
the etanercept group than in the tildrakizumab and placebo groups in a majority of subgroup 
categories. Consistent with these findings, the Exposure-Response (E-R) evaluation conducted using all 
subjects treated with tildrakizumab or placebo from Part 1 of the Phase 3 trials (P010 and P011) 
concluded that no E-R relationship could be observed between exposure and safety across doses of 
100 mg and 200 mg.  
The incidence of AEs, drug-related (per investigator) AEs, SAEs, and discontinuations due to AEs was 
comparable for subjects with body weight ≤90 kg compared to those with body weight >90 kg. This is 
consistent with findings of the exposure-response analysis, in which an assessment of safety by dose 
and body weight subgroup was performed. No differential safety profile was determined for subjects 
with low body weight (≤90 kg) compared with those with higher body weights (>90 kg). When 
comparing placebo, 100 mg, and 200 mg in all subjects in Part 1 of P010 and P011, no specific 
differences in AEs) were observed. Similarly, when comparing 100 mg with 200 mg integrated across 
Part 1 and Part 2, no important differences were seen in AEs (infections/infestations, severe 
infections/infestations, URTI and nasopharyngitis, basal/squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, 
myocardial infarction/ischemia, cardiac failure, drug hypersensitivity), with Infections and infestations 
being the most frequent SOC. Thus, it was found that treating subjects, in either weight category, with 
a 200 mg SC regimen does not increase the safety risk.  
The incidence of AEs, drug-related (per investigator) AEs, SAEs, and discontinuations due to AEs was 
comparable for subjects with or without prior exposure to biologic therapy for psoriasis. This is 
consistent with findings of the population PK analysis. Prior treatment of psoriasis with a biological 
agent was tested as potential covariate in the population PK analysis, but did not have a statistically 
significant influence on tildrakizumab exposure. In the exposure-response and longitudinal PK- 
(pharmacodynamic) PD models, PASI 75 response rates were similar in subjects regardless of prior 
treatment of psoriasis with a biological agent. The population PK model was used to simulate 
tildrakizumab PK in subjects with and without prior treatment of psoriasis with a biological agent using 
distributions of other covariates derived from the psoriasis subjects enrolled in the Phase 2b and 3 
trials. The resulting area under the curve at steady state (AUCSS) geometric mean ratio (GMRs) [90% 
CI] for subjects with/without prior treatment of psoriasis with a biological agent receiving 100 mg and 
200 mg SC were 0.90 [0.85, 0.95] and 0.89 [0.85, 0.84], respectively. Thus, the effect of prior 
treatment of psoriasis with a biological agent on tildrakizumab PK was not considered to be clinically 
meaningful and no dose adjustment was deemed to be warranted. 
Elderly 
Patients aged 18 years or older were included in the clinical trial programme. A total of 175 patient’s 
≥65 years old (155 patients aged between 65 and 75 and 20 patients ≥75 years old) were included in 
the base period safety pool. The overall safety profile in patient ≥ 65 years old and ≥75 years old were 
comparable with younger populations (< 65 years old and < 75 years old respectively). There was a 
mild increase in the frequency of some adverse events reported in ≥ 65 years old such as hypertension, 
COPD, atrial fibrillation, basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of skin, which is expected for elderly 
population.

The occurrence of total AEs is similar in all age groups. However, it has to be noted that the numbers 
of patients over 75 years is small. 
Pregnant or breast feeding women 
There is inadequate data in pregnancy and lactation in the clinical development programme to form a 
conclusion of safety. This special population is represented accordingly in the SmPC. 
Female patients who were pregnant or lactating were excluded from enrolment in the clinical trials. A 
total of 13 pregnancies occurred across the whole clinical development programme. There were 2 
pregnancies reported in the Phase 1 trials (P05661 and P05839), and 11 pregnancies reported in the 
Phase 2b/3 trials, including 2 patients in P05495, 5 patients in P010 and 4 patients in P011. 
Pregnancy outcomes included 6 deliveries of healthy term infants, 6 cases of fetal loss and in one case 
outcome is not available to date. In relation to the fetal loss there were 4 elective abortions and 2 
spontaneous abortions occurring at week 4 and week 8 of the pregnancy in patients who were 
smokers, one of whom also had a pregnancy history that included an ectopic pregnancy and another 
miscarriage in addition to 2 full term live births.

In the updated safety extension pool at the cut-off date of 27 May 2017, there were 4 new cases of 
pregnancy. In the tildrakizumab 200 mg arm, two subjects had live births by C-section and one subject 
had a vaginal live birth. In the tildrakizumab 100 mg arm, one subject had a live birth by C-section. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
No formal trials with tildrakizumab on patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted. Patients 
with significant organ dysfunction (such as significant hepatic dysfunction) were excluded from the 
clinical trials. Among patients receiving tildrakizumab during the base period, there were 90 patients 
with medical history of hepatic impairment in the Phase 2b/3 trials.  
The AEs observed in these patients were comparable with AEs observed with the overall population. No 
additional safety concern was identified in this patient group. 
Patients with renal impairment 
No formal trials with tildrakizumab on patients with renal impairment have been conducted. Patients 
with significant organ dysfunction (such as significant renal dysfunction) were excluded from the 
clinical trials. 
When the renal function is assessed based on the Glomerular Filtration Renal estimation (eGFR) at 
baseline, there were 1328 patients with normal renal function, 609 patients with mild renal 
impairment, 56 patients with moderate renal impairment and 1 patient with severe renal impairment. 
There were no patients with renal failure. No additional safety concern was identified on these 
populations. No adverse events were reported in the only patient with severe renal impairment (eGFR: 
< 30).

Immunological events 
Across healthy subject trials (P05561, P05776 and P06306) and psoriasis trials (P05382 and P009), 
AEs were pooled and categorized by ADA status. Treatment emergent ADA positive subjects in the 
integrated AE tables were compared to negative and inconclusive subjects (combined). 
Treatment emergent anti-tildrakizumab antibodies showed no discernible effects on safety (eg, AEs, 
including ISRs) in the Phase 1 trials. 
Across healthy subject trials (P05561, P05776 and P06306), of the 103 subjects treated with 
tildrakizumab, 101 subjects were considered ADA evaluable and included in the analysis. While there 
was no trend for the presence of ADAs to impact AEs, the number of subjects with treatment emergent 
ADA (10, 9.9%) is small and no relationship between ADA and ISR could be found. 
In the immunogenicity evaluation in the Phase 2b/3 trials, the ADA-evaluable population included 
individuals with at least one ADA sample after dosing with tildrakizumab; therefore, subjects treated 
with placebo or etanercept during Part 1 of the trials were not part of the ADA-evaluable population in 
the placebo controlled safety pool. 
In this analysis of the Phase 2b and Phase 3 placebo controlled safety pool, Treatment-Emergent 
Positive (TE-POS) subjects were compared with negative and inconclusive subjects (combined). The 
TE-POS subject category contains both subjects who had at least one sample test positive for 
neutralizing antibodies (NAb-POS) and subjects who were negative for NAb (NAb-NEG). 
The overall incidence of antibodies against tildrakizumab was low (4.1% through 12-16 weeks and 
8.2% through 52-64 weeks.).

Table 47: ADA Incidence in Subjects treated with 100 mg or 200 mg Tildrakizumab through 
Week 16 (Phase 2b) and Week 12 (Phase 3) 
The integrated ADA data through 12-16 weeks included patients treated with 100 mg (N=700) or 200 
mg (N=700) tildrakizumab. The integrated ADA incidence through 52-64 weeks was summarized for 
evaluable patients who were treated continuously with 100 mg (N=400) or 200 mg (N=380) in Phase 
2b and Phase 3 for 52-64 weeks. For patients in Phase 2b and Phase 3 dosed with 100 mg, the 
proportion of TE-POS patients increased over time from 4.3% through 12-16 weeks to 6.5% through 
52-64 weeks. In addition, the proportion of patients who were TE-POS and NAb-POS was 0.6% (4 of 
700) through 12-16 weeks and 2.5% (10 of 400) through 52-64 weeks. 
A similar proportion of patients dosed with 200 mg was TE-POS was 4.1% (29 of 700) through 12-16 
weeks and 8.2% (31 of 380) through 52-64 weeks. In addition, the proportion of patients who were 
TE-POS and NAb-POS was 0.6% (4 of 700) through 12-16 weeks and 3.2% (12 of 380) through 52-64 
weeks. 
The number of treatment emergent ADA positive patients with available PASI and PGA scores was 
small (N=7 and N=13 for tildrakizumab 200 mg and 100 mg, respectively). Patients with treatment 
emergent ADAs in both dose groups showed numerically higher proportions achieving the primary 
endpoint at Week 12. In the tildrakizumab 200 mg group, the proportion of patients with PASI 75 
response or PGA score of “clear” or “minimal” at Week 12 was higher for treatment emergent positive 
patients (86% and 71% for PASI and PGA, respectively) compared with negative/inconclusive patients 
(67% and 62%, respectively). The data suggests that ADA did not reduce the efficacy observed at 
Week 12. However, a large number of samples are classifies as inconclusive. The ADA assay and the 
large number of inconclusive samples have to be further discussed by the applicant. For more 
information please refer to the pharmacokinetic section (section 2.1.2). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 107/126 
 
 
 
 
 
For patients treated with 200 mg that were TE-POS NAb-POS (N=4), the percent improvement in PASI 
score was less (38%) relative to negative patients (76%) through Week 12. However, as this result is 
based on only 4 patients in the Phase 2b/3 Period, this has to be further evaluated. 
Adverse Events in ADA positive patients 
After adjustment for exposure, the incidence rate of patients with 1 or more specific adverse events 
among ADA positive patients during the base study was comparable between the tildrakizumab 100 
mg and tildrakizumab 200 mg groups. No meaningful differences could be identified to the individual 
parts of the base study. Adverse events among ADA positive patients were reported most frequently 
for the Infections and Infestations SOC and the most common adverse event was nasopharyngitis. 
Overall, the presence or absence of ADA does not seem to impact significantly on the rate at which 
adverse events are reported. 
Injection site reactions (ISRs) 
In protocols P05776 and P06306 (Part 1), tildrakizumab was administered as a single SC injection at 
doses ranging from 50 mg to 400 mg. 24% of the subjects in the tildrakizumab group and 22.2% of 
the subjects in the placebo group were reported to have an AE related to an ISR. With the exception of 
1 event, all ISRs occurred within 2 weeks post dose and were considered drug-related by the 
investigators. All ISRs reported in the trials were transient and mild in severity. 
All treatment emergent ISRs reported as AEs were also reviewed by subjects’ anti-drug antibody (ADA) 
status. Of the 75 subjects treated subcutaneously with tildrakizumab, 74 subjects were considered 
ADA evaluable (since one or more samples were available post-tildrakizumab administration), with 
treatment-emergent ADAs reported in 8 (10.8%) subjects. Considering that the number of subjects 
who were treatment emergent ADA positive and the incidence of ISRs were small in the integrated 
Phase 1 healthy subject dataset (P05776 and P06306, Part 1), no relationship between ADAs and ISRs 
could be found. 
In the Phase I patient trials (psoriasis and Crohn’s disease trials) no subjects were reported to have an 
AE associated with an ISR. 
In the Phase 2b/III placebo controlled trials ISRs were reported at a comparable incidence for 
tildrakizumab 100mg, 200,g and placebo 3.4, 4.0 and 2.3% respectively with a higher incidence in 
subjects taking etanercept (17.9%). Similar results are seen in the Phase 2b/III base period safety 
pools, see table excerpt below n (event per 100-subject-year).

subject-year) 
ISRs in the Extension safety pool for tildrakizumab 100mg and 200mg respectively were reported 
using the definition of Tier 1 AE at an incidence of 1.0 and 1.1%. 
An integrated analysis of all tildrakizumab-related hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis, urticaria, 
angioedema) reported in the Phase 1 program was performed using the definition of a Tier 1 AE 
Assessment report

established for the Phase 2b/3 trials. Across the Phase 1 trials in both healthy subjects and subjects 
with psoriasis, no subject was reported to have a tildrakizumab-related hypersensitivity reaction. 
In the placebo-controlled safety pool, the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions was low with 
tildrakizumab 200 mg (1 subject, 4.0%) and tildrakizumab 100 mg (1 subject, 4.0%) and comparable 
to that of placebo (1 subject, 0.3%). The incidence of subjects reporting hypersensitivity reactions 
receiving etanercept was 0 subjects, 0%. No important differences in AE frequency were noted 
between the tildrakizumab 100 mg or tildrakizumab 200 mg group and the placebo group for drug-
related hypersensitivity reactions. Notably, drug-related hypersensitivity reactions for the 
tildrakizumab dose groups involved hypersensitivity to concomitant medications and not to 
tildrakizumab. 
Table 49: Analysis of Subjects with Tier 1 Adverse Events Phase 2 and 3: Placebo-Controlled 
Safety Pool All Subjects as Treated 
The incidence of ISRs was comparable, in terms of their number per 100-subject year, in the 
tildrakizumab 100 mg, 200 mg and placebo arms for the base study safety period, while the 
etanercept arm demonstrated considerably higher rates. The values for the placebo, 100 mg, 200 mg 
and etanercept arms were 5.03, 3.51, 4.63 and 40.41, respectively.  The severity levels for all the AEs 
associated with ISRs ranged from mild to moderate and they were comparable between the 100 mg 
and 200 mg doses. No severe ISRs were recorded. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The formation of CYP450 enzymes can be altered by increased levels of certain cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-
6, IL-10, TNFα, IFN) during chronic inflammation. Although a role for IL-23 in the regulation of CYP450 
enzymes has not been reported, the effect of tildrakizumab on CYP450 enzyme activity was evaluated 
in a disease-drug-drug interaction study, where all patients received a single dose of up to five 
cytochrome P450 probe substrates as a cocktail (midazolam, omeprazole, caffeine, dextromethorphan, 
warfarin + vitamin K). The results indicate that there is no clinically meaningful effect on CYP450 
enzyme activity. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Phase 1 Trials 
Across the Phase 1 program (P05561, P05776, P06306, P05382, P009), 7 subjects were discontinued 
due to an AE. Three of these discontinuations occurred prior to the subjects receiving trial treatment. 
In addition, in the Crohn’s trial, 1 subject discontinued due to pregnancy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 109/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Phase 2b/3 Trials 
The rate of Adverse Events leading to discontinuation per 100 patient-years in the Phase 2/3 Base 
Period Pool was similar across the treatment groups with the exception for etanercept. The rate for the 
tildrakizumab 200 mg was 2.15, for the tildrakizumab 100 mg 2.20 and for placebo 2.28. For the 
etanercept group the rate of AE´s leading to discontinuation was 5.87, which is more than double 
compared to the tildrakizumab 200 mg treatment group. Across the treatment groups, no SOC or 
specific AE leading to discontinuation had an exposure-adjusted rate of >1.3 (in the etanercept 
treatment group). For the tildrakizumab 200 mg or tildrakizumab 100 mg groups, no SOC had an 
exposure-adjusted rate of discontinuations due to AEs of >0.43 or >0.60, respectively. The most 
frequent SOC leading to discontinuation in the tildrakizumab 200 mg group was Infections and 
Infestations with 0.43 followed by Neoplasms and Nervous system disorders with 0.32 each. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical development program included evaluations of tildrakizumab across 9 completed trials: 6 
Phase 1 trials - P05382 (P001), P05661 (P004), P05776 (P005), P05839 (P006), P06306 (P007), and 
P009. There was one Phase 2b trial - P05495 (P003) and two Phase 3 trials - P010 and P011. 
A total of 1994 patients received any dose of tildrakizumab at some point during the base trial periods 
(42 patients received at least the 5 mg dose; 123 patients received at least the 25 mg dose; 1083 
patients received at least the 100 mg dose and 1041 patients received at least the 200 mg dose). The 
mean duration of treatment was 53.9 weeks for tildrakizumab during the base trial periods, 
corresponding to an exposure of 2059.04 subject-years. 
Phase 1 trials were conducted in healthy subjects (P05661, P05775, P06306), patients with moderate-
to-severe psoriasis (P05382, P009) and patients with Crohn’s Disease (P05389). More than 60% of 
participants in each study reported at least one Adverse Events. Common adverse events reported 
were headache with 27.2% in the healthy subjects, 17.3% in patients with psoriasis, 13% in patients 
with Crohn´s disease and infections with 27.2% in the healthy subjects, 14.7% in patients with 
psoriasis. 
In the Phase 2b/3 Trials Placebo-controlled Safety Pool 47.9% patients receiving tildrakizumab 200 
mg, 48.2% receiving tildrakizumab 100 mg, 53.8% receiving placebo and 54.0% receiving etanercept 
reported one or more AEs. The incidence of drug-related AEs was similar for the tildrakizumab 200 mg 
(14.0%), tildrakizumab 100 mg (14.8%), and placebo (13.2%) groups and was higher in patients 
receiving etanercept (29.4%). General disorders and administration site conditions were more frequent 
with etanercept (20.8%) than with placebo (8.5%), tildrakizumab 200 mg (6.8%) or tildrakizumab 100 
mg (8.7%), which can be explained by the different dosing regimen and known side effects of 
etanercept. The most frequently reported SOC was Infections and infestations. The most frequently 
reported specific AEs as well as the most frequent drug-related AEs across treatment groups were 
nasopharyngitis and headache. 
After adjustment for duration of exposure, the AE incidence rate per 100 subject-years in the Phase 
2b/ 3 Base Period Pool was lower in the tildrakizumab 200 mg (79.34) and tildrakizumab 100 mg 
(77.03) groups compared with patients receiving placebo (153.52) or etanercept (148.61). The 
Adverse Event rate per 100 subject-years was the highest in the Infections and infestations SOC across 
all treatment groups, but was lower for the tildrakizumab 200 mg (52.64) and tildrakizumab 100 mg 
(48.88) groups than for the placebo (79.50) and etanercept (86.04) groups. Nasopharyngitis was the 
most common individual AE within the Infections and infestations SOC for all treatment groups. Skin 
and subcutaneous tissue disorders were more frequent in the placebo (31.53) group than in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 110/126 
 
 
 
 
tildrakizumab 200 mg (13.13), tildrakizumab 100 mg (13.92) or etanercept (28.03) groups, due to a 
higher incidence of the specific AEs of pruritus and psoriasis. 
The risk of SIB is unknown. All reported cases of completed suicide have been adjudicated and 
implemented and the SIB event rate has been recalculated as requested by the CHMP/PRAC.  The 
recalculated incidence rate of completed suicide per 100 subject-years for tildrakizumab is 0.05 and for 
SIB 0.19. An association between psoriasis and SIB has been thoroughly described in several studies 
for the overall psoriasis population. No causal association between the treatment with tildrakizumab 
and the completed suicides has been established. The reported cases of completed suicide are 
considered not related to the treatment with tildrakizumab although this can never be excluded 
completely. Additionally the Applicant accepted the proposal to include serious psychiatric events (e.g. 
completed suicidal, serious depression and SIB) as an outcome of interest in the proposed registry 
study. For these reasons the implementation of a warning statement in the SmPC is considered not 
necessary. 
The rate of SAEs per 100 patient-years in the Phase 2b and Phase 3 Base Period Safety Pool was 
similar for the tildrakizumab 200 mg group at 7.21 and the tildrakizumab 100 mg group at 5.81 
compared with the placebo group at 6.40, but was higher for the etanercept group at 13.04. Overall 
the SAE rate was low across treatment groups, with the exception of the Neoplasms SOC. Within this 
SOC, the highest incidence rate per 100 patient-years was noted for the etanercept group (3.26). 
The rate of drug-related SAEs per 100 patient-years was low for the tildrakizumab 200 mg group 
(0.97), the tildrakizumab 100 mg group (0.30) and the placebo group (0.91), compared with the 
etanercept group (3.26). The highest drug-related SAE rate across groups was noted for the Infections 
and infestations SOC. 
The rate of AEs leading to discontinuation per 100 patient-years was similar across the treatment 
groups with the exception for etanercept. The rate for the tildrakizumab 200 mg was 2.15, for the 
tildrakizumab 100 mg 2.20 and for placebo 2.28. For the etanercept group the rate of AE´s leading to 
discontinuation was 5.87, which is more than double compared to the tildrakizumab 200 mg treatment 
group.  
Seven (7) deaths occurred in the clinical development program of tildrakizumab. None of the 7 deaths 
in subjects receiving tildrakizumab is considered to be related to study medication. All patients had 
related risk-factors in their medical history. 
For the subgroup analyses, there were no trends observed in the analysis of gender, BMI, weight, 
baseline disease characteristics, duration of disease and previous psoriasis treatments. Parameters of 
one or more adverse events, drug-related adverse events, SAEs, SARs, deaths, discontinuations due to 
AEs/ARs/SARs/SAEs were compared.  There were no meaningful differences seen in the safety profile 
observed in elderly as compared to younger patients or patients weighing over 90 kg as compared to 
lighter patients. However the information in elderly is considered limited to draw definite conclusions. 
Additionally, pregnancy outcomes will be monitored post authorisation in order to characterise the 
safety profile during pregnancy. 
Hypersensitivity, immunogenicity, SIB, IBD, Infections, MACE and malignancies are included as 
potential risks in the RMP which is endorsed as long term data beyond week 64 are limited. Long Term 
Extension Studies are ongoing and will evaluate the long term safety and tolerability of tildrakizumab. 
(see later) 
Overall, the safety profile remains to be further characterised in the post authorisation setting. 
Therefore, the following studies listed in the RMP have been agreed:

2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The overall safety profile of tildrakizumab is in line with other biologicals for the treatment of psoriasis, 
with the most common adverse events and serious events falling under the infections and infestations 
SOC. 
Data from the Phase 2b/3 Trials Placebo-controlled Safety Pool show that the incidence rate for AEs 
was comparable between the treatment groups. The most frequently reported SOC was Infections and 
infestations. The most frequently reported specific AEs were nasopharyngitis and headache. 
The rate of Drug-related SAEs was low in the tildrakizumab groups. Hypersensitivity,  SIB, IBD, 
Infections, MACE and malignancies are included as potential risks in the RMP which is endorsed as long 
term data beyond week 64 are limited. Long Term Extension Studies are ongoing and will evaluate the 
long term safety and tolerability of tildrakizumab. 
There were no meaningful differences seen in the safety profile observed in elderly as compared to 
younger patients or patients weighing over 90 kg as compared to lighter patients.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant requested alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 20.03.2018. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that tildrakizumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in 
the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers tildrakizumab to be a new active substance as it is 
not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Ilumetri (tildrakizumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as 
it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU; 
It is a biological product that is not covered by the previous category and authorised after 1 January 
2011. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease associated with serious 
comorbidities and substantial impairment of physical and psychological quality of life. Psoriasis is one 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 117/126 
 
 
 
 
of the most common human skin diseases affecting 2 to 3% of the general population. The prevalence 
of psoriasis varies in the EU from 0.6% to 8.5%. Psoriasis is a chronic, painful immune-mediated 
inflammatory skin disease associated with serious comorbidities and substantial impairment of physical 
and psychological quality of life. The uncontrolled inflammation of psoriasis may contribute to 
commonly associated comorbidities, including cardiovascular (CV) disease (including hypertension and 
increased risk for myocardial infarction, stroke, and CV death), obesity, type 2 diabetes, arthritis, and 
chronic renal disease. Psoriasis is also associated with serious psychiatric comorbidities, including 
depression, anxiety, and suicidality, as well as substance abuse. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current therapeutic options for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis include phototherapy, topical 
agents (e.g., corticosteroids), conventional systemic therapy (e.g., cyclosporine, methotrexate, and 
oral retinoids), and biologic therapy including TNF-α antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab), 
anti-IL12/IL23, IL23(guselkumab) (and IL-17 inhibitors (ustekinumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab).  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical development program tildrakizumab consisted of 2 pivotal studies, P010 (reSURFACE1) and 
P011 (reSURFACE2).  
Study P010 was a 64-week, Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous (SC) administration of tildrakizumab 200 and 100 mg doses. 
The study consisted of a 4-week screening period, a 12-week Part 1 period (Week 0 to Week 12), a 
16-week Part 2 period (Week 12 to Week 28), a 36-week Part 3 period (Week 28 to Week 64), and a 
20-week follow-up period. Seven hundred seventy two (772) patients were enrolled of which 638 
completed the study. 
Study P011 was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active-comparator (etanercept) and placebo-
controlled, parallel-group trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous (SC) administration 
of tildrakizumab 200 and 100 mg doses. The study consisted of a 4-week screening period, a 12-week 
Part 1 period (Week 0 to Week 12), a 16-week Part 2 period (Week 12 to Week 28) and a 24-week 
Part 3 period (Week 28 to Week 52). 756 of initially 1090 patients completed the trial. 
Male and female patients 18 years of age or older with a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe chronic 
plaque psoriasis (defined by ≥10% body surface area [BSA] involvement,“moderate” or greater score 
on the PGA scale, and PASI score ≥ 12 at baseline were eligible to participate in these trials. The 
eligibility criteria were adequate for the inclusion of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Tildrakizumab is a targeted humanised anti-IL-23p19 mAb.  IL-23 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that 
has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of chronic inflammatory diseases including 
psoriasis. IL-23 affects the differentiation, expansion, and survival of T cell subsets, (e.g., Th17 cells 
and Tc17 cells) and innate immune cell subsets, which represent sources of effector cytokines, 
including IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 that drive inflammatory disease. 
Dose response was demonstrated in study P05495. This led to the selection of the tildrakizumab 100 
mg and 200 mg for the pivotal studies P010 and P011.  The co-primary endpoints of the 2 pivotal 
studies P010 and P011 were the proportion of patients with PASI 75 response and a PGA score of 
“clear” or “minimal”, with at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline, at Week 12.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 118/126 
 
 
 
 
In both pivotal studies both tildrakizumab doses showed a statistically significant higher efficacy to 
placebo (P010 and P011) and to etanercept (P011) with respect to PASI 75 and PGA responders. The 
applicant has opted for the 200 mg over 100 mg dose. The efficacy data show that the response to the 
200 mg dosing regimen was slightly higher as compared to the 100 mg dosing regimen over time. 
However, the results of the primary endpoints show that both tildrakizumab doses have similar results 
in the first 12 weeks of treatment. Small differences arise in both pivotal studies in the late stage of 
the maintenance period. 
For P010 the proportion of patients achieving a PASI 75 response at Week 12 was significantly higher 
with 63.8% (95%-CI: 58.1 – 69.1%) for the tildrakizumab 100 mg and 62.3% (95%-CI: 56.7 – 
67.8%) tildrakizumab 200 mg groups compared with 5.8% (95%-CI: 2.7 – 10.8%) for the placebo 
group (p<0.001 each). Regarding the second co-primary endpoint the proportions of patients with a 
PGA score of “clear” or “minimal”, with at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline at Week 12 were 
significantly greater with 57.9% (95%-CI: 52.2 – 63.5% ) in the tildrakizumab 100 mg  and 59.1% 
(95%-CI: 53.4 – 64.6% ) in the tildrakizumab 200 mg groups compared with the placebo 
(7.1%)(95%-CI: 3.6 – 12.4% ) group (p<0.001 each). 
For P011 the proportion of patients achieving a PASI 75 response at Week 12 was significantly greater 
in the tildrakizumab 100 mg  with 61.2% (95%-CI: 55.5–66.7%) and tildrakizumab 200 mg with 
65.6% (95%-CI: 60.1-70.9%) groups compared with 5.8% (95%-CI: 2.7-10.7%) in the placebo and 
48.2% (95%-CI: 42.6-53.9%) in the etanercept (group (p<0.001 each). Regarding the second co-
primary endpoint, the proportion of patients with a PGA score of “clear” or “minimal”, with at least a 2 
grade reduction from baseline at Week 12 was significantly greater in the tildrakizumab 100 mg 
(54.7%)(95%-CI: 44.0-60.4%) and tildrakizumab 200 mg (59.2%)(95%-CI: 53.6-64.7%) groups 
compared with the placebo (4.5%)(95%-CI: 1.8-9.0%) and etanercept (47.6%)(95%-CI: 42.0-53.3%) 
group (p<0.001 each). 
The results of the key secondary endpoints are in line with the primary efficacy analysis, 
demonstrating superiority of both tildrakizumab arms to placebo. 
As secondary endpoints PASI 90 and 100 at different time points were included. These are clinically 
relevant endpoints. Psoriasis is a chronic disease and the maintenance of response is a very important 
point especially when it comes to PASI 100. The data for the response rates over time in the Phase 3 
trials show that 40% of patients achieve a PASI 100 response at week 36 (P010) and 32 (P011) with a 
maximum effect at week 48 for the P010 (43.7%) and week 52 for the P011 (46.7%). Symptomatic 
improvement was also demonstrated with Tildrakizumab treatment as demonstrated on DLQI as well 
as HAQ scores. 
Re-treatment with tildrakizumab after relapse was also effective. Patients who were re-treated after 
relapse during the withdrawal phase responded to re-initiation of their initial treatment.  
Compared to other biologic therapies recently approved (e.g. brodalumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab) 
the onset of efficacy is slower. However, the efficacy over time is high and the maintenance dosing 
interval of every 12 weeks is seen favourable as this reduces the burden on the patient. 
Both doses were comparable in term of efficacy, therefore the dose regimen of 100mg at weeks 0, 4 
and every 12 weeks thereafter was considered more appropriate. However in patients with higher body 
weight (>90kgs) and in patients with higher disease burden, the dose of 200mg may achieve higher 
efficacy.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
High numbers of protocol deviations have been reported for both studies. The high incidence of 
protocol deviations triggered the GCP inspections of studies P010 and P011 (GCP/2017/017 and 
GCP/2017/034 ). The applicant provided additional sensitivity analyses excluding those entries in order 
to quantify the relevance of these entries on the results of each study. There were 2 approaches, in 
which affected entries have been considered as “Non-responder” or all patients with any entry affected 
have been excluded from the analyses. The results of these analyses showed only small differences 
regarding the results of the co-primary endpoints (PASI75 and PGA response). Therefore the impact of 
the protocol deviations is considered negligible for the conclusions on favourable effects. 
17.5% of psoriatic patients had received prior biologic therapy  and 8.3% had received at least one 
prior anti-TNFα agent, it is unknown how efficacious tildrakizumab would be in patients with more 
resistant disease and whom had failed a number of previous prior biological therapies. 
Patients were not allowed concomitant moderate to high potency topical steroids or systemic steroids 
which may be useful in practice, it is unclear whether any additional benefit would be demonstrated or 
indeed safe to use tildrakizumab in combination with these medicinal products. 
The effects of Tildrakizumab on regional psoriasis such as scalp, hand and foot as well as nail psoriasis 
were not reported on in the trials. Although efficacy was demonstrated in a subpopulation on psoriatic 
arthritis the numbers are too low to draw any conclusion. It is acknowledged that psoriatric arthritis 
can affect 15-20% of the population and in some cases can precede the skin changes. 
The majority of patients were white and middle aged, while differences in efficacy in different races or 
ages are not anticipated experience of use in other races is limited. There is also limited information in 
elderly patients. 
The phase 3 studies had different designs for duration of maintenance effect. Pooled data on 
subgroups was not conducted for maintenance effect the numbers of patients in the subgroup for the 
individual trials is too low to draw any robust conclusions. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The overall safety profile of tildrakizumab is in line with compounds in the similar therapeutic class 
interfering with the IL-pathway in psoriasis. In general, the incidence of adverse events was low, 
mostly similar to placebo, similar to or more favourable than the active comparator etanercept and the 
adverse events were mainly mild in severity. Tildrakizumab was generally well tolerated in the Phase 1 
and 2b PK trials following administration of multiple IV (up to 10 mg/kg) and SC (up to 400 mg) doses. 
In the Phase 2b/3 efficacy and safety trials involved comparison of both doses 100mg and 200mg 
tildrakizumab, no dose-related trends were seen in terms of AEs, SAEs, drug-related AEs, 
discontinuation due to AEs, or Tier 1 AEs in tildrakizumab 100mg and 200 mg doses. The most 
common adverse events and serious events were falling under the infections and infestations SOC. No 
differences between the 100 mg and 200 mg doses were observed that would clearly point towards 
favouring one dose regime, neither in incidence of adverse events nor in type of adverse events.  
Almost half of the patients experienced at least one adverse event during the placebo controlled safety 
pool and this was comparable among treatment arms. One or more AEs was reported in 339 subjects 
(47.9%) receiving tildrakizumab 200 mg, 340 subjects (48.2%) receiving tildrakizumab 100 mg, 191 
subjects (53.8%) receiving placebo, and 169 subjects (54.0%) receiving etanercept. This was also 
consistent with AE incidence in the base period safety pool and the extension safety pools.    
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 120/126 
 
 
 
 
Due to the IL-23 pathway blocking mechanism of action and available experience from similar 
compounds severe infection, malignancies, NMSC, melanoma skin cancer, Suicidal ideation behaviour, 
confirmed extended MACE, ISRs, and drug-related hypersensitivity reactions were considered adverse 
events of special interest. 
Overall the incidence of infections and infestations was lower for the tildrakizumab groups compared to 
etanercept. The exposure-adjusted event rates (per 100 subject-years) of AEs in the Infections and 
Infestations SOC were 52.64 for the tildrakizumab 200 mg and 48.88 for the tildrakizumab 100 mg 
group and 86.04 for the etanercept group. 
Causal relationship between tildrakizumab and MACE could not be established based on the current 
data. For the base period safety pool, the incidence of patients with MACE events was reported in 
4/1081 (0.4%) and 3/1039 (0.3%) patients from the Tildrakizumab, 100 and 200mg groups, 
respectively and 1/588 (0.2%) in placebo group. There were no events in the Etanercept group. 
Hypersensitivity is a potential risk related to monoclonal antibodies. This is included in the potential 
risks of the RMP. 
Overall 2 completed suicides were reported (base pool and extension period), the incidence per 100 
subject years was 0.05, the incidence of SIB was 0.19 per 100 subject years in the same analysis 
population. SIB is included as a potential risk in the RMP. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The overall rate of adverse events is low, only data from a larger patient population over a longer time 
can give a more precise picture. A long term extension study deriving additional 192 weeks of safety 
data is ongoing at the moment. The predominant adverse events were infections, the prevalence of 
which was similar in the tildrakizumab /etanercept arm across the safety pools. As the mechanism of 
action of tildrakizumab may lead to susceptibility of infections, long term follow-up data needed to 
better clarify the vulnerability to infections of tildrakizumab treated patients. This will be monitored in 
the long term follow up safety study as well as in the registries as planned in the RMP. 
Malignancies are an important safety aspect of immunomodulatory therapies. The nonclinical data on 
IL-23 blockade show among others role in resistance to tumour induction in mice, while toxicology 
studies do not raise significant concerns regarding carcinogenicity. The incidence of malignancy 
(including non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer) was comparable to placebo and comparator 
etanercept in general throughout the safety data pools. However, numerically the majority of 
malignant diseases were observed in tildrakizumab treated patients, this raises concern, and the 
possible association with tildrakizumab treatment needs to be further investigated. 
Almost 50% of the sera tested through 12-16 weeks in the pivotal studies, were inconclusive. 
However, there seemed to be no effect of ADA status, positive or negative/inconclusive, on the 
proportion of subjects achieving the primary and key secondary endpoints of PASI and PGA response 
at Week 12. After adjustment for exposure, the incidence rate of subjects with 1 or more specific 
adverse events among ADA positive subjects during the base study was comparable between the 
tildrakizumab 100 mg and tildrakizumab 200 mg groups. No meaningful differences could be identified 
to the individual parts of the base study. 
In the development program of tildrakizumab a total of 6 cases of SIB have been identified, one 
occurring in a phase I trial, one case was identified during the base period and 4 additional cases in the 
extension period. In the long term extension period two completed suicides were reported. Both of 
these cases, causality assessment of the reported event is considered heavily confounded, and neither 
event is considered related to tildrakizumab by the investigator or the Sponsor. Serious psychiatric

events (e.g. completed suicidal, serious depression and SIB) were included as an outcome of interest 
in the proposed registry study. An association between psoriasis and SIB has been thoroughly 
described in several studies for the overall psoriasis population. The reported cases of completed 
suicide are considered not related to the treatment with tildrakizumab although this can -not be 
excluded completely. Nevertheless, the risk of SIB remains unknown and will be monitored in the post 
authorisation setting. 
There are no data in pregnancy. Considering the mechanism of action of tildrakizumab, monitoring of 
pregnancy outcomes at both doses was considered necessary, therefore this will be monitored in the 
post marketing setting.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
Psoriasis is one of the most common human skin diseases affecting 2 to 3% of the general population. 
The prevalence of psoriasis varies in the EU from 0.6% to 8.5%. Psoriasis is a chronic, painful 
immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease associated with serious comorbidities and substantial 
impairment of physical and psychological quality of life. The conventional therapies are associated with 
dose- and treatment-limiting options. The most common reasons for discontinuation of these therapies 
are lack of efficacy, adverse events (AEs) and treatment inconvenience. However, newer treatment 
options provide improved outcomes compared with traditional systemic therapies.  
Tildrakizumab is a new targeted biological treatment for patients with plaque psoriasis. Tildrakizumab 
blocks the binding of extracellular IL-23 to the cell surface IL-23 receptor (IL-23R), inhibiting IL-23 
mediated intracellular signalling, activation and cytokine production. 
It has been demonstrated to work effectively in a heterogeneous population who were recruited into 
the study and a significant proportion of patients achieved PASI 75 and PGA responses. In the two 
pivotal Phase 3 Studies both tildrakizumab groups showed a statistically significant higher and clinically 
meaningful efficacy relative to placebo (P010 and P011) and to etanercept (P011) with respect to PASI 
75, 90, 100 and PGA response at different timepoints. Patient reported outcomes e.g. DLQI improved 
parallel with the therapeutic effect. 
The pivotal trials encompassed two doses of tildrakizumab. The doses gave very similar results for 
pivotal efficacy demonstration as well as for safety. Analyses of PK showed that body weight is an 
important factor in determining exposure and therefore the CHMP considered that the agreed posology 
with the more favourable benefit /risk to be the lower dose of 100 mg. Possibility to consider higher 
dose of 200mg (with two injections) in patients of >90 kg and with a higher disease burden  may also 
be considered acceptable in these patients. 
The onset of efficacy is apparently not as fast as other approved biologic therapies. However, after 12 
weeks of treatment over 60% of the patients showed PASI 75 in both tildrakizumab groups. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/664213/2018  
Page 123/126 
 
 
 
 
proportion of patients with a PASI 100 response at week 12 was 13.3% in the tildrakizumab 200 mg 
group, 13.5% in the tildrakizumab 100 mg group compared to 5.2% in the etanercept group. The 
highest results for PASI 100 are seen not earlier as week 32 in both pivotal studies. At this time 
around 40% of patients treated with tildrakizumab achieved PASI 100 response. This rate was 
maintained till the end of the studies.  
Due to the IL-23 pathway blocking mechanism of action and available experience from similar 
compounds severe infection, malignancies, NMSC, melanoma skin cancer, SIB, confirmed extended 
MACE, ISRs, and drug-related hypersensitivity reactions were considered adverse events of special 
interest. 
Regarding malignancies the role of the cytokine-blockade might be multiple and so far the diagnosed 
malignancies in clinical trials were not unequivocally connected to tildrakizumab. Longer experience is 
needed to get more information about the risk of malignancies. Effects on cardiovascular system 
remains also to be explored in the long term extension study, so far few cases were reported. For the 
fatal cardiovascular events in the development program of tildrakizumab pre-existing risk factors were 
present. 
Overall, the rates of adverse events and serious adverse events were comparable between both 
tildrakizumab groups and placebo, while etanercept showed higher rates of adverse events. Adverse 
events of special interest such as infections, MACE, and malignancy, would benefit from long term 
follow-up data needed to better clarify the vulnerability to these risks for tildrakizumab treated 
patients.  
Regarding the available safety data, to date one to two year data are available on tildrakizumab 
therapy with a long-term extension period ongoing. This period is not long enough to fully characterize 
the favourable and unfavourable effects observed with tildrakizumab, therefore the applicant will 
monitor long term data in the clinical setting (category 3 study in the RMP). As the overall frequency of 
adverse events is low, only data from larger patient population over a longer time will give a more real 
picture. 
3.7.1.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Statistically significant and clinically relevant efficacy of tildrakizumab has been shown. Total clearing 
of the psoriatic skin can be achieved which is considered of high relevance to the patient. This is 
accompanied by a safety profile, which has a low rate of adverse events in clinical trials and with no 
specific pattern of serious adverse events which seem to be rather sporadic events. Based on the data 
presented, the beneficial effects are considered to outweigh the unfavourable effects seen in the 
clinical programme. Long term experience with tildrakizumab is available from the pivotal studies up to 
week 64, as well as from the ongoing long term extensions (as per cut-off date May 2017, 57.8% of all 
subjects exposed during Phase 2b and Phase 3 have received treatment for at least 2 years) but this is 
still considered limited. Long Term Safety Extension Studies are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of long term use in the clinical setting up to 4 years to further characterise the safety profile 
post marketing. Additionally registries will be set up as described in the RMP.

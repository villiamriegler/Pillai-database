Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for emtricitabine / rilpivirine / 
tenofovir disoproxil, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Having reviewed the cumulative safety review on osteopenia/osteoporosis, the PRAC considers that 
section 4.4 of the emtricitabine / rilpivirine / tenofovir disoproxil SmPC needs changing to enhance the 
information on bone effects. The Package leaflet is to be updated accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for emtricitabine / rilpivirine / tenofovir disoproxil the CHMP is 
of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing emtricitabine / 
rilpivirine / tenofovir disoproxil is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product 
information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

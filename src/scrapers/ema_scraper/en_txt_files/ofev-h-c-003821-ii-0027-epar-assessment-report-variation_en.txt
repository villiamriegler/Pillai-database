Extension of Indication to include new indication for OFEV for the treatment of other chronic fibrosing 
interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with a progressive phenotype based on the results of pharmacology 
studies and the double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase III trial (INBUILD). As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated in order to reflect the 
use of Ofev in the new indication. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to introduce minor formatting changes in the PI. Furthermore, the PI is brought in 
line with the latest QRD template version 10.1. The RMP version 9.0 has also been submitted. 
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet 
and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information relating to orphan designation 
OFEV, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/13/1123 and  
EU/3/16/1724. OFEV was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication: 
Treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 
The new indication, which is the subject of this application, does not fall within any orphan designation.  
According to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council 
on orphan medicinal products, it is not possible to combine an orphan indication and a non-orphan 
indication in the same marketing authorisation. 
Consequently, the MAH has requested on 18 May 2020 the withdrawal of the orphan designation from 
the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decisions 
P/225/2010 and P/0233/2015 on the granting of product-specific waivers.

Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
MAH request for additional market protection 
The MAH requested consideration of its application in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) 
726/2004 - one year of market protection for a new indication. 
An extended market protection was also requested as part of the parallel SSc-ILD variation 
(EMEA/H/C/3821/II/0026) concluded positively in February CHMP 2020. Therefore, the request 
submitted in the current application is no more applicable and the company consequently withdrew its 
request on 19 May 2020 prior to CHMP opinion. 
Protocol assistance 
The MAH did not seek Protocol Assistance at the CHMP.

Nintedanib is a small molecule that inhibits a distinct spectrum of receptor tyrosine kinases and non-
receptor  tyrosine  kinases,  including  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor,  plateletderived  growth  factor, 
and fibroblast growth factor receptors, Src family kinases (Src, Lck, and Lyn), and colony stimulating 
factor  1  receptor.  These  kinases  and  their  down-stream  signalling  cascades  have  been  shown  to  be 
involved in the pathogenesis of fibrotic tissue remodelling. 
Nintedanib, at a recommended dose of 150 mg twice daily (bid), is an approved treatment for IPF. 
In this variation application the applicant submitted the results of INBUILD study in order to extent the 
marketing application to the population with Progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease (PF-ILD). 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The term interstitial lung disease (ILD) encompasses a large group of over 200 pulmonary disorders. 
While idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the best-known progressive fibrosing ILD (PF-ILD), there is 
a  group  of  patients  with  different  underlying  clinical  ILD  diagnoses  other  than  IPF  who  develop  a 
progressive fibrosing phenotype during the course of their disease. These patients demonstrate a number 
of  similarities  to  patients  with  IPF,  with  their  disease  being  defined  by  the  presence  of  progressive 
pulmonary fibrosis, worsening respiratory symptoms, declining lung function despite immunomodulatory 
therapies and, ultimately, early mortality. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The claimed indication is: “Treatment of other chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype”. 
Management of the condition 
With  the  exception  of  IPF,  for  which  nintedanib  and  pirfenidone  are  available,  there  is  no  approved 
therapy for other chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype. 
Immunosuppressive  agents  are  sometimes  used  off-label  in  patients  with  ILDs.  While  corticosteroids 
with or without immunosuppressive drugs were historically chosen as first-line treatment, they may not 
be effective.

2.1.2.  About the product 
Nintedanib is a small molecule that inhibits a distinct spectrum of receptor tyrosine kinases and non-
receptor tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, 
and fibroblast growth factor receptors, Src family kinases (Src, Lck, and Lyn), and colony stimulating 
factor  1  receptor.  These  kinases  and  their  down-stream  signalling  cascades  have  been  shown  to  be 
involved in the pathogenesis of fibrotic tissue remodelling. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The applicant received scientific advice on their clinical development in patients with progressive 
fibrosing interstitial lung disease (reference EMEA/H/SA/1069/8/2016/III). 
Questions addressed referred to the following topics:  
•  Non-clinical exploration of nintedanib in animal models and nonclinical development program in 
IPF 
• 
• 
Proposed concept of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease (PF-ILD) and the suggested 
approach to investigate the efficacy and safety of nintedanib in a group of patients with different 
ILDs who develop a progressive phenotype 
Proposed clinical development program (study design, endpoints, sample size, patient selection 
and eligibility criteria, imaging inclusion and exclusion criteria, proposed restrictions and 
allowances for concomitant medications, patient reported outcome measures, statistical analyses, 
safety monitoring and risk management, adverse event reporting, Drug-drug interaction) 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
In this variation the applicant submitted pharmacology data and justification related to the impact on 
this variation on the current ERA. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The ability of nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) to interfere with essential pathogenic processes in PF-ILDs was 
explored in a variety of in vitro assays and in vivo systems resembling features of the human disease 
pathology.  The  effect of  nintedanib  (BIBF  1120  ES)  on  cellular  functions  and  fibrosis markers  of  lung 
fibroblasts  from  patients  with  IPF  [and  SSc-ILD  was  already  assessed  and  described  in  previous 
applications. A summary is provided below: 
Assessment report  
EMA/315975/2020  
Page 9/116 
 
 
 
The effect of nintedanib on the release of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators from immune cells 
was studied. The efficacy of nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) was also investigated in several animal models 
resembling pathogenic mechanisms of IPF, SSc-ILD and organ fibrosis. 
To  further  demonstrate  that  nintedanib  (BIBF  1120  ES)  attenuates  fibrotic  processes  in  the  lung 
independent of the initial trigger it was tested 1) in a mouse model of severe allergic lung inflammation 
and fibrotic remodelling resembling features of cHP, 2) in a mouse model of immunologically triggered 
RA-ILD and in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). 
The  efficacy  of  nintedanib  (BIBF  1120  ES)  was  assessed  in  a  mouse  model  of  triple  allergen  induced 
severe  inflammation  and  airway  remodelling.  The  pathology  was  induced  by  sensitizing  the  animals 
intraperitoneally with a combination of ovalbumin (OVA), cockroach antigen (CRA) and house dust mite 
allergen (HDM) and subsequent alternating inhalative allergen challenges for seven weeks.  
Nintedanib  (BIBF1120  ES)  treatment  was  started  3  weeks  after  the  start  of  the  inhalative  allergic 
challenges in a therapeutic manner after the onset of the pathological alterations. Nintedanib (BIBF1120 
ES) treatment did not influence the animal weights significantly, except for the highest dose of 50 mg/kg 
bid at the end of the 6-week treatment period. The mean weight at this time was significantly reduced 
by 1.9 g compared to the allergen challenged animals which is still below 10% of the mean body weight.  
The  anti-inflammatory  activity  of  nintedanib  (BIBF  1120  ES)  was  demonstrated  by  a  dose-dependent 
significant  reduction  of  the  eosinophil  and  lymphocyte  count  in  the  bronchoalveolar  lavage  (BAL).  At 
nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) doses of 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg bid the number of eosinophils was reduced 
by 24.5%, 23.4%, and 32.9%, respectively (all p<0.05) and the number of lymphocytes by 22.7% (ns), 
37.7% (ns) and 44.6% (p<0.05), respectively.  
Nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) also reduced concentrations of inflammatory mediators in lung homogenates.  
In a dose-dependent manner, nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) attenuated interleukin (IL)-5, resulting in a 
significant reduction of 38.4% at the highest tested dose of 50 mg/kg bid (P<0.05). At 25 mg/kg bid, 
nintedanib  (BIBF  1120  ES)  significantly  reduced  IL-1β,  IL-12  and  KC  by  32.2%,  34.4%  and  41.8%, 
respectively (P<0.05); no inhibitory activity was detected at the higher dose of 50 mg/kg bid. An effect 
of nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) on allergic lung remodelling was demonstrated by a significant reduction 
of  the  lung  tissue  collagen  content  indicating  anti-fibrotic  activity.  In  a  dose-dependent  manner, 
nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) reduced the collagen content by 20.6% at 25 mg/kg bid (P<0.05) and by 
45.1% at 50 mg/kg bid (P<0.05). Although the ratio of alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA)-stained area 
per airway area was reduced by nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) by 79.8% this effect was not statistically 
significant.  
Nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) did also not influence the airway mucus. Lung function parameters such as 
dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn) and airway hyper responsiveness (AHR) and the immunoglobulin (Ig)E 
levels in the serum of the mice were not significantly changed by nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) treatment. 
The effect of oral nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) at 60 mg/kg once daily on the severity of pulmonary fibrosis, 
inflammation and arthritis score in a SKG mouse model of zymosan induced RA-ILD (model described in 
Keith et al.) was explored with two treatment strategies. 
In the early treatment regimen nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) treatment was started five weeks after the 
zymosan application in the phase of the increasing arthritic pathology and during the maximum of the 
pathology during week 6 – 10. 
In the late treatment regimen (week 10–16 after zymosan administration) nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) 
treatment  was  started  after  the  arthritis  pathology  reached  its  maximum  (week  10  after  zymosan 
application)  and  continued  during  a  phase  of  already  partial,  spontaneous  resolution  of  the  arthritis 
pathology  (till  week  16  after  zymosan  application).  However,  lung  fibrosis  as  assessed  by  the 
hydroxyproline content in lung tissue still increased between week 10 and 16. In both treatment regimen 
at the end of the nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) treatment interval of six weeks the animals were euthanized, 
and the analyses performed. 
Early nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) treatment reduced the arthritis score. This became most apparent after 
the mice had been receiving nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) for a week. Thereafter, the arthritis scores began 
Assessment report  
EMA/315975/2020  
Page 10/116 
 
 
 
to  decline  progressively  over  the  ensuing  4  weeks.  In  contrast,  the  arthritis  score  increased  in  mice 
receiving vehicle alone. Early nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) had no effect on the hydroxyproline content in 
the lung tissue. Nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) slightly but selectively changed inflammation parameters of 
the lungs of SKG mice treated with zymosan. Whereas neutrophil numbers and CD103c+ dendritic cells 
were elevated the monocyte count was reduced. 
Late treatment with nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) did not reduce the arthritis score. At week 16 mean lung 
hydroxyproline level as marker of collagen deposition was increased compared to historic controls. Late 
treatment with nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) led to a significant reduction (p<0.001) in established fibrosis 
from  34.4  ±  1.565  μg/Rt  upper  lobe  in  vehicle  treated  mice  to  22.8  ±  1.562  μg/Rt  upper  lobe  in 
nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES)-treated mice (mean ± SEM). Although the number of total BAL cells did not 
change  neutrophil  and  lymphocyte  counts  along  with  lung  tissue  inflammatory  macrophages  were 
increased in the nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES)-treated mice. 
In  both  treatment  regimen  Nintedanib  (BIBF  1120  ES)  did  not  influence  the  animal  weight  and  the 
survival of the animals. Nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) was also tested in a mouse model of collagen-induced 
arthritis. 
Nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) treatment at 100 mg/kg or 120 mg/kg once daily, by gavage was started 13 
days after the induction of the arthritic pathology by injecting native porcine type II collagen mixed with 
Freund’s adjuvant containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the base of the tail. Nintedanib (BIBF 1120 
ES) treatment was continued for 5 weeks. The animals did not gain body weight and the arthritis score 
increased during the 5 weeks from about 1.5 to 7. Nintedanib (BIBF 1120 ES) had no attenuating effect 
on the increasing arthritis score and no effect on the gain of the body weight. 
2.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant submitted justification related to the impact on this variation on the current ERA as 
detailed below. 
An  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  (ERA)  for  nintedanib  was  submitted  with  the  initial  marketing 
authorization  applications  (MAAs).  Nintedanib  is  already  approved  and  marketed  for  the  treatment  of 
idiopathic  pulmonary  fibrosis  (IPF)  (tradename:  Ofev®)  and  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC) 
(tradename: Vargatef®).  
The risk assessment concluded that no significant impact on the environment is expected. In the current 
ERA,  the  estimation  of  the  predicted  environmental  concentration  (PEC)  of  nintedanib  in  the  various 
environmental  compartments  is  based  on  the  default  market  penetration  factor  (Fpen  =  0.01),  as 
provided in the EMA guideline, and a maximum daily dose of 500 mg. The maximum daily dose of 500 
mg used for the PEC calculations is higher than the recommended maximum daily doses of Ofev® and 
Vargatef® (300 and 400 mg/d, respectively). It also exceeds the recommended maximum daily dose of 
the newly proposed indication, i.e. will be the same as for the already approved indication for Ofev® 
(i.e. 300 mg/d). 
The  default  Fpen  is  based  on  a  very  conservative  worst-case  estimation,  meaning  that  1%  of  all  EU 
inhabitants  are  treated  365  days/year  with  the  recommended  maximum  daily  dose.  Therefore,  the 
effects in the environment by adding another indication are considered to be negligible and well covered 
by the Fpen used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  data  presented  suggest  a  general  anti-fibrotic  effect  of  nintedanib  treatment  in  animal  models. 
However,  given  the  broad  indication  sought  the  direct  relevance  of  these  studies  to  the  clinic  are 
unknown.  No  change  in  dose  is  proposed  with  the  new  indication.  No  change  to  the  existing  PI  is 
warranted based on the submitted pharmacological data.

The applicant’s justification that as the PEC in the initial MAA submission was based on an Fpen which 
was not refined, it represents a worst-case scenario is considered acceptable. The dose used for initial 
PEC calculations (500 mg) is in excess of the max dose proposed for use with the current indication  
(300  mg).  The  initially  calculated  PEC  exceeded  the  action  limit  and  phase  II  and  IIa  studies  were 
conducted and assessed during initial authorisation. Following assessment of these data, nintedanib is 
not expected to pose a risk to the environment. The extension of indication in other chronic fibrosing 
ILDs patients with progressive phenotype will not impact this conclusion. 
2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the new/extended indication does not lead to 
a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of nintedanib. Considering the above 
data,  nintedanib  is  not  expected  to  pose  a  risk  to  the  environment.  There  are  no  non-clinical  issues 
precluding the authorisation of the proposed variation.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
2.3.2.1.  Introduction  
As a part of this variation application following new data have been submitted: 
- PK of nintedanib in patients with PF-ILD and comparison to patients with IPF and SSc-ILD. 
- Exposure-response analyses of nintedanib in patients with PF-ILD and comparison to patients with IPF 
and SSc-ILD 
Pharmacokinetic in target population   
Title: A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial evaluating efficacy and safety of nintedanib 
over 52 weeks in patients with Progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease”“(PF-ILD) – INBUILD® 
This was a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel design trial. Patients were randomised 
in  a  1:1  ratio  to  oral  nintedanib  or  matching  placebo.  The  main  efficacy  and  safety  analyses  were 
performed  after  the  last  randomised  patient  had  completed  Part  A  (52  weeks).  Randomisation  was 
stratified by HRCT fibrotic pattern (““UIP-like fibrotic pattern only”“ or ““Other fibrotic patterns”“).  
Pharmacokinetic  blood  sampling  was  conducted  for  the  determination  of  nintedanib  plasma 
concentrations. One pre-dose sample was taken on Visit 4 (Day 29) and on Visit 7 (Day 169) at trough 
concentrations  (8-20  hours’  post-drug  administration).  Plasma  concentrations  were  analysed 
descriptively; no statistical testing was performed. 
Results  
Number analysed  
Overall, 663 patients were treated (332 patients received nintedanib and 331 patients received placebo). 
PK  samples  were  available  for  320  patients,  however  due  to  sampling  time  violations,  missing  dose 
administrations, or non-measurable concentrations, valid nintedanib trough plasma concentrations were 
available for 311 patients and were included in the PK evaluation.  
Pharmacokinetic results  
Geometric mean (gCV) pre-dose concentrations for patients on 150 mg bid nintedanib at Visit 4 and Visit 
7  were  11.7  ng/mL  (73.5%,  N=274)  and  10.8  ng/mL  (84.3%,  N=212).  For  patients  on  100  mg  bid 
nintedanib, geometric mean pre-dose concentrations were 12.9 ng/mL (63.3%, N=7) at Visit 4 and 8.07 
ng/mL (72.5%, N=38) at Visit 7.  
Table 2: Descriptive statistics for trough concentrations of nintedanib at Visit 4 and Visit 7 
Subgroup  analyses  were  performed  for  race,  Asian  subgroups,  gender,  body  weight  and  age  and  are 
presented using dose normalized trough plasma concentrations, i.e. including patients on 150 mg and 
100 mg nintedanib bid, that were averaged over both visits where applicable.  
Asian patients were found to have higher nintedanib exposure than other races (Asian: 0.102 ng/mL/mg, 
White: 0.0700 ng/mL/mg, Black/African American: 0.0673 ng/mL/mg; 
Higher exposure was seen for patients ≤65 kg (0.101 ng/mL/mg) compared to patients >65 kg (0.0689 
ng/mL/mg) and for patients ≥65 years (0.0839 ng/mL/mg) compared to patients <65 years (0.0673 
ng/mL/mg). Males and females achieved similar nintedanib exposures (0.0755 ng/mL/mg and 0.0780 
Assessment report

ng/mL/mg, respectively). For patients with UIP-like pattern, gMean dose-normalised exposures (0.0807 
ng/mL/mg) were similar to exposures seen with patients with other fibrotic patterns (0.0704 ng/mL/mg) 
Comparison of nintedanib PK in patients with PF-ILD, IPF and SSC-ILD 
It is noted that gMean plasma exposure of 0.0767 ng/mL/mg in patients with PF-ILD is slightly higher in 
comparison  to  what  was  observed  in  the  IPF  studies.  However,  considering  the  variability  in  gMean 
exposure  levels  observed  in  the  IPF  studies  (ranging  from  0.0558  to  0.0687)  it  is  assumed  that  this 
numerical increase (by 10 % compared to 1199.34) for patients with PF-ILD is rather due to interstudy 
variability than inherent to the patient population. 
Table 3: Descriptive statistics of dose-normalized steady state nintedanib trough plasma 
concentration (Cpre,ss,norm) after multiple oral administration of nintedanib 150 mg twice 
daily in patients with PFILD, SSc-ILD and IPF 
Figure  below  compares  the  trough  plasma  concentrations  of  the  respective  clinical  trials.  Nintedanib 
plasma  exposure  observed  in  patients  with  PF-ILD  appears  to  be  comparable  to  plasma  exposure 
observed in patients with IPF or SSc-ILD. 
Subgroup analyses of study 1199.247 showed that patients with PFILD who were of Asian race, elderly  
(≥  65  years),  had  lower  body  weight  (≤  65  kg)  or  were  females  (not  weight  adjusted)  had  higher 
nintedanib exposure in a magnitude that was similar to that observed in previous analyses of patients 
with NSCLC, IPF or SSc-ILD.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Nintedanib is a small molecule that inhibits a distinct spectrum of receptor tyrosine kinases and non-
receptor  tyrosine  kinases,  including  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor,  plateletderived  growth  factor, 
and fibroblast growth factor receptors, Src family kinases (Src, Lck, and Lyn), and colony stimulating 
factor  1  receptor.  These  kinases  and  their  down-stream  signalling  cascades  have  been  shown  to  be 
involved in the pathogenesis of fibrotic tissue remodelling. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
PK/PD modelling was presented by the applicant. The objectives of the exposure-response analyses were 
to: 
•  Characterize the relationship between nintedanib plasma exposure and the efficacy variable of 
annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) over 52 weeks and the safety variable of 
liver enzyme elevations (assessed as time to first alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) elevation ≥ 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN)) over 52 weeks in patients 
with progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease (PF-ILD). 
•  Characterize  covariate-parameter  relationships  of  interest  in  the  exposure-response  models 
(including the characterization of the co-primary population of patients with ““high resolution 
computed tomography (HRCT) with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)-like fibrotic pattern”“ for 
the efficacy variable). 
Methods 
The analysis for FVC  was  based on data from 663 patients with PF-ILD randomized to either 150 mg 
nintedanib  twice  daily  (bid)  (n=332)  or  placebo  (n=331)  in  study  1199.247.  Overall,  5097  FVC 
measurements over the 52 weeks treatment period (as used for primary endpoint assessment including 
baseline measurements) were included in the analysis. 
The analysis for ALT or AST elevations (evaluating time to first ALT or AST elevations ≥ 3 x ULN over 52 
weeks)  was  based  on  pooled  data  from  2642  patients  with either idiopathic pulmonary  fibrosis  (IPF), 
systemic sclerosis associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) or PF-ILD.  
A total of 1403 patients with IPF treated with nintedanib doses of 50 mg bid (n=86), 100 mg bid (n=86), 
150  mg  bid  (n=723)  or  placebo  (n=508)  in  studies  1199.30  ,  1199.32    and  1199.34,  a  total  of  576 
patients with SSc-ILD treated with either 150 mg nintedanib bid (n=288) or placebo (n=288) in study 
1199.214 and a total of 663 patients with PF-ILD treated with either 150 mg nintedanib bid (n=332) or 
placebo (n=331) in study 1199.247 were included in the analysis. 
 In all studies, dose reductions or treatment interruptions were allowed for the management of adverse 
events. Overall, 106 out of 2642 patients (in total 11 events in the placebo group and 95 events in the 
nintedanib bid treatment groups) had ALT or AST elevations ≥ 3 x ULN, with 41 events in 1403 patients 
with IPF (3 events in the placebo group and 38 events in the nintedanib bid treatment groups), 16 events 
in 576 patients with SSc-ILD (2 events in the placebo group and 14 events in the 150 mg bid treatment 
group) and 49 events in 663 patients with PF-ILD (6 events in the placebo group and 43 events in the 
150 mg bid treatment group). 
Results  
The  structural  exposure-FVC  model  in  patients  with  PF-ILD  consisted  of  a  linear  disease  progression 
model  with  a  disease-modifying  nintedanib  effect  on  the  rate  of  decline  in  FVC  (mL/year)  (whereas 
disease modification indicates that the drug causes a slowdown of FVC decline) using a Emax drug effect

function. As concentration at half maximum effect (EC50) was not estimated with acceptable precision 
(analysis of only one dose group), EC50 was fixed to the estimated value from the previous FVC model 
in  patients  with  IPF  (i.e.  3.28  ng/mL,  assuming  a  similar  sensitivity  to  the  antifibrotic  activity  of 
nintedanib).  
IIV  terms  were  supported  on  the  parameter  FVC  at  baseline  and  rate  of  decline  in  FVC.  Based  on 
knowledge from literature and in congruency with previous exposure-response models in IPF and SSc-
ILD, age, gender and height were included as pre-specified structural covariates on the FVC at baseline. 
Using this model, the natural rate of decline in FVC in the overall population of placebo patients in the 
PF-ILD study (-198 mL/year; 95% confidence interval (CI): [-225; -171]) was comparable with patients 
included in IPF studies (-224 mL/year; 95% CI: [-251;-200]) and faster than in patients included in the 
SSc-ILD  study  (-98.6  mL/year;  95%  CI:  [-125;  -72.7])  based  on  previously  established  exposure 
response models in IPF and SSc-ILD, respectively  
Among patients in the PF-ILD study, baseline FVC tended to be higher for patients with ““HRCT with UIP-
like fibrotic pattern”“ than for those with other HRCT fibrotic patterns (2480 mL; 95% CI: [2410; 2550] 
vs. 2370 mL; 95% CI: [2280; 2460]) and natural disease related annual rate of decline in FVC faster (-
222 mL/year; 95% CI: [-260; -184] vs. -162 mL/year; 95% CI: [-194; -130]).  
Similar to IPF and SSc-ILD studies, the maximum effect estimate in both co-primary populations of PF-
ILD (although being rather imprecise) again suggests that the annual rate of decline in FVC could almost 
be reduced to the natural age related loss of FVC (about 30 mL/year) independent of the differences in 
the natural disease related FVC decline of the different populations. Hence, the annual rate of decline at 
maximum  drug  effect  for  the  overall  population  of  patients  with  PF-ILD  was  estimated  to  be  -32.4 
mL/year; CI 95% [-72.2; 7.41]. 
No other distinct covariate-parameter relationships for the FVC model were identified. 
Model diagnostics for the structural FVC models indicated a satisfactory predictive performance for both 
placebo  and  nintedanib  150  mg  bid  data.  The  relationship  of  annual  rate  of  decline  in  FVC  versus 
concentration based on the structural FVC models for the overall population and for patients with “HRCT 
with UIP like fibrotic pattern” demonstrated that the therapeutic dose of 150 mg bid resulted in plasma 
exposures, which were close to the maximum drug effect.

The solid line represents the typical annual rate of decline in FVC after one year of 
treatment versus Cpred,ss based on point estimates of the respective structural FVC model. 
The shaded areas represent the 95% CI based on 1000 SIR replicates. 
Although more patients in the nintedanib treatment group prematurely discontinued study treatment as 
compared to placebo, there was no indication in modelling diagnostics for FVC based models that a drop-
out model was needed. Therefore, no drop-out model was developed. 
Regarding the endpoint of ALT or AST elevations, the previously established positive correlation (already 
observed in data from IPF and SSc-ILD studies) between nintedanib plasma exposure and ALT or AST 
elevation ≥ 3 x ULN was confirmed based on combined data from patients in the IPF, SSc-ILD and PF-
ILD  studies.  The  final  exposure-ALT  or  AST  elevations  model  consisted  of  a  parametric  time-to-first 
safety event model with a log-linear drug effect on the log of the hazard. In addition to plasma exposure, 
gender and study (PFILD study versus IPF or SSc-ILD studies) were identified as independent and as 
significant 
covariates influencing the risk to develop ALT or AST elevations. Of note, impact of gender is in line with 
previous models established based on patients in IPF and SSc-ILD studies. 
No  other  significant  covariate-parameter  relationships  were  identified.  Assessment of  the  final  ALT  or 
AST elevations model showed a good predictive performance in the Kaplan- Meier (K-M) plots overall as 
well as in the K-M plots stratified by key covariates (defined covariates listed above and other factors of 
interest including study or treatment group). 
Simulations using the final covariate model for ALT or AST elevations display the expected risk of having 
an ALT or AST elevation event as function of nintedanib exposure (Cpred,ss) for patients in the PF-ILD 
study and show the higher risk for female than for male patients.

The  risk  [exposure-adjusted  to  the  median  Cpred,ss  of  study  1199.247  for  the  150  mg  bid  regimen; 
12.1  ng/mL]  was  predicted  on  average  about  3.7-fold  higher  in  female  than  in  male  patients  (point 
estimate  of  the  hazard  ratio  of  3.7;  95%  CI:[2.5;6]  in  the  PF-ILD  study).  An  about  2-fold  higher 
(exposure- and gender-adjusted) risk to experience ALT or AST elevations ≥ 3 x ULN than for patients 
in  the  IPF  or  SSc-ILD  studies  was  estimated  for  the  median  Cpred,ss  of  the  nintedanib  150  mg  bid 
regimen in study 1199.247. 
Figure 3 Predicted risk of having an ALT or AST elevation ≥ 3 x ULN versus nintedanib 
exposure (Cpred,ss) after one year of treatment in female and male patients in the PF-ILD 
study treated with nintedanib or placebo, based on the covariate model for ALT or AST 
elevations applied to the analysis data set. The solid lines represent the expectedrisk based 
on point estimates of the covariate model, and the shaded areas represent the 95% CI 
based on 1000 SIR replicates. 
In summary, the results of exposure-efficacy analyses in patients from the PF-ILD study were consistent 
with findings from earlier exposure-efficacy models restricted to patients in the IPF and SSc-ILD studies. 
Likewise, the positive correlation between nintedanib exposure and ALT or AST elevations in general and 
female gender as an exposure independent risk factor (as already observed in IPF and SSc-ILD studies) 
were confirmed based on the PF-ILD study.  
A higher incidence in ALT or AST elevations was observed overall in the present PFILD study, which need 
to be interpreted with caution, as the assessment was based on data from different central laboratories 
with considerably different reference ranges. The relationship between nintedanib plasma exposure and 
ALT or AST elevations ≥ 3x ULN for the PF-ILD study was however considered weak to moderate (taking 
into account the steepness of the exposure-safety curve) and therefore comparable to that in patients 
from the IPF and SSc-ILD studies. It should further be noted that liver related laboratory parameters 
other than ALT or AST elevations ≥ 3x ULN (e.g. ≥ 5x or ≥ 8x ULN) were consistent between the PF-
ILD, IPF and SSc-ILD studies based on central laboratory measurements. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
As a part of this extension of indication application, the applicant submitted the PK data collected in the 
INBUILD study in patients with Progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease”“(PF-ILD). In this study 
PK samples were collected twice i.e one pre-dose sample was taken on Visit 4 (Day 29) and on Visit 7 
Assessment report  
EMA/315975/2020  
Page 19/116 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Day 169) at trough concentrations (8-20 hours post-drug administration).PK samples were available 
for 320 patients. 
In  addition,  the  mean  trough  concentrations  collected  in  INBUILD  study  were  compared  to  the 
concentrations recorded in other patient populations i.e patients with PF-ILD, IPF and SSC-ILD. 
The  results  of  descriptive  statistics  for  trough  concentrations  of  nintedanib  provided  by  the  applicant 
indicated the trend towards a higher concentration in PF-ILD patients as compared to patients with IPF.  
Geometric mean in PF-ILD patients was 0.767 ng/ml/mg as compared to geometrics mean in the range 
from 0.558 to 0.0687 ng/ml/mg recorded in studies in patients with IPF.  
The approach taken by the applicant to compare PK profiles between disease types has been questioned. 
Progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease is not a single disease but an amalgamation of different 
ILDs with progressing behaviour. Therefore, the PK profile may have been compared based on underlying 
ILD diagnosis. The applicant clarified that no difference in exposure between the groups with different 
underlying diagnosis was observed. To compare the exposure data, ratios of the geometric means of the 
different groups to the overall geometric mean value of the PK part in study 1199.247 were calculated. 
Ratios  were  between  0.88  and  1.11  suggesting  no  difference,  which  is  in  line  with  previous  analyses 
demonstrating  similar  pharmacokinetics  between  patients  with  IPF  and  SSc-ILD  as  well  as  cancer 
patients and healthy volunteers. 
The  applicant  was  asked  to  discuss  the  results  of  the  Pop  PK  analysis  considering    PF-ILD  patient 
population since a dedicated PopPK analysis incorporating solely data from the PF-ILD study 1199.247 
has not been performed and discuss whether significant differences in the PK prolife between different 
disease types could be anticipated .  
Two previous population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analyses have been carried out, one analysis based 
on combined data from Phase II/III clinical trials in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (studies 1199.10, 1199.13, 1199.14, 1199.30) and one IPF-specific 
PopPK  analysis  based  on  combined  data  from  Phase  II/III  trials  in  IPF  (studies  1199.30,  1199.32, 
1199.34).    As  nintedanib  PK  was  fully  characterised  in  previous  indications  (NSCLC  and  IPF)  and 
considering the lack of differences in PK between NSCLC and IPF populations in the popPK conducted, it 
can be assumed that  this would also be applicable to patients with other chronic fibrosing interstitial 
lung diseases with a progressive phenotype (PF-ILD). Nevertheless, in order to evaluate the sub-group 
effect of underlying ILD diagnoses in the PF-ILD study and to set this into perspective to SSc-ILD and 
IPF  studies  additionally  by  means  of  nonlinear  mixed-effects  modelling,  the  PopPK  model  developed 
initially on IPF patient data was updated and adapted by incorporating data from SSc-ILD and PF-ILD 
patients. 
PK differences in bioavailability have been observed across nintedanib studies also within the differences 
in bioavailability have been observed across nintedanib studies also within the same disease type. None 
of the differences in exposure between SSc-ILD or PF-ILD as compared to IPF studies did exceed in a 
large magnitude the interstudy variability between different IPF studies so far (with a difference in gMean 
trough concentrations of up to 23% between IPF trials and a difference of 12% in the INBUILD trial as 
compared to the INPULSIS II trial [IPF trial with the highest nintedanib exposure]. 
In addition, the applicant provided updated exposure-response analyses to characterize the relationship 
between nintedanib plasma exposure and the efficacy variable of annual rate of decline in forced vital 
capacity (FVC) over 52 weeks. In addition, the safety variable of liver enzyme elevations over 52 weeks 
in patients with progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease (PF-ILD) were analysed.  
In relation to the efficacy, it was noted that the natural rate of decline in FVC in the overall population 
of placebo patients in the PF-ILD study (-198 mL/year; 95% confidence interval (CI): [-225; -171]) was 
comparable with patients included in IPF studies (-224 mL/year; 95% CI: [-251;-200]) and faster than 
in patients included in the SSc-ILD study (-98.6 mL/year; 95% CI: [-125; -72.7]) based on previously 
established exposure response models in IPF and SSc-ILD, respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/315975/2020  
Page 20/116 
 
 
 
In  relation  to  safety  (i.e  liver  enzyme  elevations),  an  about  2-fold  higher  (exposure-  and  gender-
adjusted) risk to experience ALT or AST elevations ≥ 3 x ULN than for patients in the IPF or SSc-ILD 
studies was estimated for the median Cpred,ss of the nintedanib 150 mg bid regimen in study 1199.247.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant presented data on pk profile in patients with chronic ILD and progressive phenotype and 
discussed the differences observed across nintedanib studies also within the differences in bioavailability 
have been observed across nintedanib studies also within the same disease type. 
Overall  it  can  be  agreed  that  the  PK  profile  and  exposure-response  are  sufficiently  characterized  in 
patients with progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease (PF-ILD).  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No specific dose response studies have been performed. In the pivotal study, the same dose as approved 
for IPF was used (i.e 150 mg bid dose).The exploration of higher dose(s) is not regarded feasible in PF-
ILD patients due to dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) by the applicant whereas testing of lower dose(s) in 
PF-ILD was not considered because of the possible lack of efficacy observed in IPF patients.  
2.4.2.  Main study 
Title of Study:  INBUILD: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy 
and safety of nintedanib over 52 weeks in patients with Progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease 
(PF-ILD). 
Methods 
This was a multicentre, multinational, prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, doubleblind, parallel-
design clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of nintedanib in patients with PF-ILD over 52 
weeks. 
Approximately 600 patients were planned to be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receivenintedanib 150 mg 
or matching placebo twice daily. The trial population was planned to beenriched for patients with HRCT 
with  UIP-like  fibrotic  pattern.  The  HRCT  pattern  was  determined  by  central  review  according  to  the 
protocol-defined criteria, which were based on those used in the Phase III nintedanib trials in IPF. 
It was planned to randomise 400 patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern, i.e. two thirds of the 
randomised patients, and 200 patients with other HRCT fibrotic patterns. 
The trial consisted of 2 parts for each patient: Part A and Part B. The duration of Part A was 52 weeks. 
Part B was a variable treatment period beyond 52 weeks, during which patients continued on blinded 
randomised treatment (nintedanib or placebo). For patients receiving trial medication until the end of 
Part B and meeting eligibility criteria, participation in the separate open-label extension trial 1199.248 
was offered.

Figure 4 Trial design 
Study participants 
Trial  1199.247  evaluated  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  nintedanib  in  patients  who  independent  from  the 
underlying cause of their ILDs exhibited a progressive fibrosing phenotype (patients with PF-ILD). 
Specifically, to be eligible for the trial, patients were to be diagnosed with a fibrosing ILD and to present 
with relevant lung fibrosis defined as features of diffuse fibrosing lung disease of >10% extent on HRCT. 
The presence of relevant lung fibrosis and the absence of other causes of progression were confirmed 
via qualitative assessment of screening HRCT images by central reviewers. The threshold of >10% total 
extent  of  fibrotic  features  was  selected  based  on  consensus  among  radiologists  and  clinicians  to 
distinguish pathologic fibrotic processes from e.g. changes related to normal ageing. Impaired diffusion 
capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO, <80% of predicted normal) at baseline was also a 
requirement for inclusion. 
Main inclusion criteria 
•  Male or female patients aged ≥18 years at Visit 1. 
• 
Patients with physician diagnosed ILD who fulfilled at least one of the following criteria for PF-
ILD within 24 months of screening (Visit 1) despite treatment with unapproved medications used 
in clinical practice to treat ILD, as assessed by the investigator: 
a. Clinically significant decline in FVC % predicted based on a relative decline of ≥10% 
b. Marginal decline in FVC % predicted based on a relative decline of ≥5 to <10% combined with 
worsening of respiratory symptoms 
c. Marginal decline in FVC % predicted based on a relative decline of ≥5 to <10% combined with 
increasing extent of fibrotic changes on chest imaging 
d. Worsening of respiratory symptoms as well as increasing extent of fibrotic changes on chest 
imaging 
Note: Changes attributable to comorbidities, e.g. infection or heart failure, had to be excluded. 
Unapproved medications used in the clinical practice to treat ILD include but are not limited to 
rituximab, 
corticosteroids, 
cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, tacrolimus. 
azathioprine,  mycophenolate  mofetil, 
n-acetylcysteine, 
• 
Fibrosing  lung  disease  on  HRCT  (performed  within  12  months  of  Visit  1),  defined  as  reticular 
abnormality with traction bronchiectasis with or without honeycombing, with disease extent of 
>10%, as confirmed by central readers. 
Assessment report

• 
For patients with underlying Connective Tissue Disease: stable CTD as defined by no initiation of 
new therapy or withdrawal of therapy for CTD within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1. 
•  Carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO) corrected for haemoglobin (Visit 1) ≥30% and <80% 
of predicted normal at Visit 2 (refer to CTP Appendix 10.1). 
•

Imaging criteria 
The investigator’s assessment of screening HRCT images regarding the imaging eligibility criteria was 
confirmed by central review.  While the clinical ILD diagnosis was not verified, central review ensured 
that relevant lung fibrosis was present and that the HRCT pattern was not indicative of other causes of 
progression.  In  addition,  the  central  reviewers  determined  the  HRCT  pattern,  which  was  used  for 
randomisation stratification. Patients meeting either criteria A, B and C, criteria A and C, or criteria B 
and C, as described below, were referred to as patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern. Patients 
who did not meet these criteria were referred to as patients with other HRCT fibrotic patterns. 
A. Definite honeycomb lung destruction with basal and peripheral predominance 
B.  Presence  of  reticular  abnormality  AND  traction  bronchiectasis  consistent  with  fibrosis  with 
basal and peripheral predominance 
C. Atypical features were ABSENT, specifically: nodules and consolidation. Ground glass opacity, 
if present, was less extensive than reticular opacity pattern. 
Main exclusion criteria

•  History of thrombotic event (including stroke and transient ischemic attack) within 12 months of 
Visit 1. 
As nintedanib is already approved for the treatment of IPF, patients were to be excluded if they met 
the diagnostic criteria for IPF according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) /European Respiratory 
Society (ERS)/Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS)/Latin American Thoracic Association (ALAT) 2011 
guidelines. 
The prognosis and clinical behaviour of chronic fibrosing ILDs, particularly those with a usual interstitial 
pneumonia (UIP) pattern, seem to be similar to that of IPF. Accordingly, the trial population was planned 
to be enriched for patients with PF-ILD with UIP-like fibrotic pattern in order to increase the likelihood 
of detecting a clinically meaningful effect of nintedanib within the confines of the trial. 
UIP pattern can be assessed either by surgical biopsy or HRCT. However, given the challenges associated 
with surgical sampling in clinical practice in patients with impaired lung function, availability of surgical 
biopsy is often limited. In contrast, HRCT assessment of extent of fibrosis and fibrotic pattern has become 
an essential part of the evaluation and diagnosis of patients with ILDs. Since HRCT diagnosis of UIP has 
been shown to correlate with both histologic UIP and prognosis in patients with ILDs, the trial population 
was planned to be enriched for patients with UIP-like fibrotic pattern based on HRCT. 
The  HRCT  pattern  was  determined  by  central  review  according  to  the  protocol-defined  criteria,  which 
were based on those used in the Phase III nintedanib trials in IPF (INPULSIS® 1 and 2). Patients meeting 
these criteria were referred to as patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern, those not meeting 
the 
criteria  as  patients  with  other  HRCT  fibrotic  patterns.  Randomisation  was  stratified  by  HRCT  fibrotic 
pattern as determined by central review. 
Treatments 
In the study patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to: 
• 
• 
nintedanib 150 mg bid or 
placebo bid 
Trial medication was to be taken at the same time every day (between 06:00 and 11:00 in the morning, 
and between 18:00 and 23:00 in the evening). Because nintedanib may cause stomach discomfort, it 
was recommended to take the trial medication after food intake. 
Dose reduction 
Dose  reduction  from  150  mg  bid  to  100  mg  bid  or  treatment  interruption  were  to  be  considered  to 
manage AEs. No further dose reduction was possible for patients on the 100 mg bid regimen because of 
possible lack of efficacy. In case of persistent AEs observed at this dose, or severe effects at 150 mg 
bid, permanent treatment discontinuation was to be considered. 
The  dose  could  be  reduced  without  prior  interruption.  If  the  reduced  dose  was  well  tolerated,  re-
escalation was possible within 4 weeks (after the dose reduction visit) or 8 weeks in case of AEs not 
considered drug related.

Treatment of the underlying diseases associated with ILD 
The largest group of patients with PF-ILD that has an underlying disease associated with ILD is the group 
of patients with CTD. Eligible patients with underlying CTD were to have  ““stable” CTD defined as no 
initiation or withdrawal of therapy for CTD within 6 weeks prior to screening. 
All approved RA/CTD medications were allowed at stable doses at baseline (Visit 2) and during the trial 
with  the  exception  of  the  following,  less  frequently  used  medications:  azathioprine,  cyclosporine, 
tacrolimus,  high  dose  steroids,  rituximab.  Cyclophosphamide  and  mycophenolate  mofetil  were  not 
allowed in the study.  
Table 4: Medication restrictions 
Prohibited medications 
As  detailed  in  the  exclusion  criteria,  patients  receiving  pirfenidone,  nintedanib,  full  dose  therapeutic 
anticoagulation or high dose antiplatelet therapy (e.g. acetyl salicylic acid >325 mg/day, or clopidogrel 
>75 mg/day, or equivalent doses of other antiplatelet therapy) were not eligible for participation in the 
trial. 
Objectives 
The objective of this trial was to investigate the efficacy and safety of 150 mg bid nintedanib in patients 
with PF-ILD compared to placebo over 52 weeks (Part A). 
The primary objective was to demonstrate a reduction in lung function decline, as measured by the 
annual rate of decline in FVC for nintedanib compared to placebo over 52 weeks. 
The main secondary objectives of the trial were to investigate the effect of nintedanib treatment on 
quality of life over 52 weeks using the King’s Brief Interstitial Lung Disease Questionnaire (K-BILD), and 
to assess the effect of nintedanib on time to first acute ILD exacerbation or death over 52 weeks and on 
overall survival alone over 52 weeks. 
Other  objectives  included  the  assessment  of  other  symptoms  of  the  disease  such  as  dyspnoea  and 
cough, as well as the assessment of safety, tolerability, and PK of nintedanib.

Definitions: 
•  King’s Brief Interstitial Lung Disease Questionnaire 
The  K-BILD  is  a  self-administered  health  status  questionnaire  specifically  for  patients  with  ILD  [R12-
4171].  The  questionnaire  was  developed  and  validated  based  on  a  range  of  ILDs,  including  the  ILD 
disease types represented in the trial population. 
The questionnaire consists of 15 items and 3 domains: breathlessness and activities, psychological, and 
chest symptoms. Possible scores range from 0 to 100, with a score of 100 representing the best health 
status. 
The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for K-BILD has not been established, but a change of 
between 4 and 8 points has been suggested to represent a meaningful change in a population of patients 
with different ILDs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/315975/2020  
Page 26/116 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Living with Pulmonary Fibrosis Symptoms and Impact Questionnaire (L-PF) 
The  L-PF  questionnaire  is  a  44-item  questionnaire  with  2  modules:  1)  symptoms  (23  items)  and  2) 
impacts (21 items). The L-PF was developed with input of patients with pulmonary fibrosis and thus is 
intended to capture perceptions specific to these patients. The symptoms module yields 3 domain scores: 
1) dyspnoea, 2) cough, and 3) fatigue as well as a total symptoms score. The impacts module yields a 
single impacts score. Symptoms and impacts scores are summed to yield a total L-PF score. Scoring is 
performed as a summary score, the mean of the dimension ratings multiplied by 100. Summary scores 
range from 0 to 100, the higher the score, the greater the impairment. An MCID for L-PF has not been 
established. 
•  Acute exacerbation 
Acute exacerbation was defined as an acute, clinically significant, respiratory deterioration characterised 
by evidence of new widespread alveolar abnormality with all of the following: 
Previous or concurrent diagnosis of ILD 
Acute worsening or development of dyspnoea typically less than 1-month duration 
Computed tomography with new bilateral ground-glass opacity and/or consolidation superimposed on a 
background pattern consistent with fibrosing ILD 
Deterioration not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload 
Events that were clinically considered as acute exacerbation but failed to meet all 4 diagnostic criteria 
due to missing CT data were to be termed “suspected acute exacerbations”. Only acute ILD exacerbations 
that fulfilled all the above criteria contributed to the endpoint. The analysis of acute ILD exacerbations 
was based on AEs reported by the investigator; the AEs were not adjudicated. 
Sample size 
The sample size calculation was based upon FVC decline results in IPF trials available at the time of CTP 
development. A rate of decline in FVC of 150 to 200 mL/year was assumed for patients with HRCT with 
UIP-like fibrotic pattern. For the patients with other HRCT fibrotic patterns, the rate of decline in FVC 
was assumed to be slightly lower: between 120 and 150 mL/year. Nintedanib was hypothesised to have 
the same relative effect in all patients with PF-ILD: an approximate 50% reduction in the annual rate of 
decline  in  FVC.  The  treatment  effect  to  detect  was  therefore  in  the  range  of  75  to  100  mL/year  for 
patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern and of 60 to 75 mL/year for patients with other HRCT 
fibrotic patterns. 
Based on the heterogeneity of the patient population with PF-ILDs, for the variability in the rate of decline 
in  FVC,  2  standard  deviations  (SDs)  were  assumed:  a  smaller  i.e.  300  mL/year  SD  for  patients  with 
HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern and a larger i.e. 400 mL/year SD for patients with other HRCT fibrotic 
patterns. 
It was planned to recruit 400 patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern, making up two thirds of 
the trial population. This enrichment design was chosen to maintain a high power to detect a clinically 
meaningful effect of nintedanib in the rare disease of PF-ILD. 
The  trial  was  to  be  considered  positive  if  it  established  efficacy  in  either  one  of  the  2  coprimary 
populations or in both. 
Randomisation 
At  Visit  1,  eligible  patients  entered  a  screening  period  during  which  HRCT  images  were  evaluated  by 
central  review  to  confirm  HRCT  eligibility  and  determine  HRCT  pattern  for  randomisation.  Written 
confirmation  by  the  central  readers  that  the  protocol  criteria  for  qualifying  HRCT  were  met  was 
mandatory for randomisation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/315975/2020  
Page 27/116 
 
 
 
Eligible patients were randomised at Visit 2 via IRT. Randomisation was stratified by HRCT pattern. No 
other  stratification  factor  was  included  in  the  randomisation  process.  Within  each  stratum  (““UIP-like 
pattern  only”“  or  ““Other  fibrotic  patterns”“),  patients  were  randomised  in  blocks  to  double-blind 
treatment  with  either  nintedanib  150  mg  bid  or  placebo  in  a  1:1  ratio.  The  block  size  was  4. 
Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomised to each treatment group. 
Blinding (masking) 
This  trial  was  a  double-blind  trial.  Trial  medication  was  identified  by  a  medication  code  number; 
packaging  and  labelling  were  otherwise  identical.  Colour,  size,  and  shape  of  nintedanib  and  placebo 
capsules were indistinguishable within dose strength but were different between dose strengths. 
Statistical methods 
The main analysis of trial 1199.247 was performed after the last randomised patient had completed the 
Week  52  Visit.  The  main  benefit-risk  assessment  of  nintedanib  in  patients  with  PF-ILD  was  based  on 
efficacy and safety data over 52 weeks, i.e. data from Part A of the trial. Additional data collected beyond 
52 weeks 
(Part B) and available at the DBL1 snapshot were included in the main analysis as supportive information. 
Evaluations  over  the  whole  trial  (Part  A+B)  included  time-to-event  efficacy  endpoints  and  safety 
analyses. 
There were 2 co-primary populations defined for the analyses in this trial: 
1) All patients (the overall population) 
2) Patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern 
Patients  with  other  HRCT  fibrotic  patterns  represented  the  ““complementary”“  population.  The 
populations according to HRCT fibrotic pattern were mutually exclusive and together formed the overall 
population. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the annual rate of decline in FVC (expressed in mL over 52 weeks) 
and  was  analysed  in  both  co-primary  populations  as  well  as  in  the  complementary  population.  The 
primary analysis used a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based approach with a random slope and 
intercept model. The analysis included fixed effects for treatment, HRCT pattern (for the analysis in the 
overall population only), and baseline FVC [mL], as well as the treatment-by-time and baseline-by-time 
interactions. Random effects were included for patient response for both time and intercept. 
Null and alternative hypotheses 
The superiority of nintedanib treatment compared with placebo was tested for the primary endpoint in 
both co-primary populations. 
For the overall population, the null hypothesis was: 
H0: There is no difference in the annual rate of decline in FVC in mL between nintedanib 150 mg bid and 
placebo in the overall population. 
The alternative hypothesis was: 
Ha: There is a difference in the annual rate of decline in FVC in mL between nintedanib 150 mg bid and 
placebo in the overall population. 
For the co-primary population of patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern, the null hypothesis 
was: 
H0: There is no difference in the annual rate of decline in FVC in mL between nintedanib 150 mg bid and 
placebo in the patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern. 
Assessment report  
EMA/315975/2020

The alternative hypothesis was: 
Ha: There is a difference in the annual rate of decline in FVC in mL between nintedanib 150 mg bid and 
placebo in patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern. 
In order to maintain an overall type 1 error rate of 5%, a Hochberg procedure was used [R97-1003]. 
Statistical significance was to be declared if the analyses in both co-primary populations were significant 
at the two-sided 5% level, or if the analyses in either co-primary population were significant at the two-
sided  2.5%  level.  No  other  endpoints,  i.e.  secondary  or  further  endpoints,  were  evaluated  in  a 
confirmatory manner. 
Figure 5 Scenarios for statistical significance for the primary endpoint using a Hochberg 
procedure 
Primary analysis 
The  annual  rate  of  decline  in  FVC  (expressed  in  mL/52  weeks)  was  analysed  in  both  co-primary 
populations as well as in the complementary population.  
The primary analysis used all available data from baseline (excluded) up to Week 52, including visits 
done after premature treatment discontinuation, EOT Visits, and Follow-up Visits done before Week 52 
(i.e. including all measurements after first drug intake and before or on Day 373). 
The primary analysis used a REML-based approach with a random slope and intercept model. 
The analysis included fixed effects for treatment, HRCT pattern (for the analysis in the overall population 
only),  and  baseline  FVC  [mL],  as  well  as  the  treatment-by-time  and  baseline-by-time  interactions. 
Random effects were included for patient response for both time and intercept. 
The decrease in FVC was assumed to be linear within each patient over 52 weeks. The intercepts and 
slopes were assumed to be normally distributed with unstructured covariance matrix. The within patient 
error was assumed to be independent and normally distributed with mean 0 and a common variance. 
The Kenward-Roger approximation was used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom and adjust 
standard errors (SEs). Significance tests were based on least-squares means using a 2-sided α = 0.05 
(2-sided 95% CIs). The primary treatment comparison of slopes was assessed through the treatment-
by-time interaction coefficient. 
Sensitivity analyses 
Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint were performed in both co-primary populations.  
The sensitivity analyses investigated the potential effect of data handling, missing data, and the analysis 
model  (e.g.  assumption  of  linearity)  on  the  results  of  the  main  analysis.  In  addition,  the  impact  of 
potential observed discrepancies between the HRCT pattern used for randomisation stratification (IRT) 
and the HRCT pattern recorded in the eCRF was planned to be evaluated, if applicable.

Tipping point analysis 
A tipping point sensitivity analysis was introduced via the TSAP in addition to the CTP specified sensitivity 
analyses.  
Analyses of the secondary endpoints 
The secondary endpoints were analysed in both co-primary populations. P-values were presented for the 
main secondary endpoints only. These p-values were considered nominal in nature and no adjustment 
for multiplicity was made. Analysis of the secondary endpoints was not planned for the complementary 
population.  However,  descriptive  analyses  of  selected  endpoint  parameters  were  shown  for  all  3 
populations, including the complementary population. 
All  available  data  from  the  TS  within the  first  52  weeks  were  used,  including  data  from  patients  who 
prematurely discontinued randomised treatment. For analyses by visit, or including visit in the model, 1 
value per visit was selected in case of multiple values.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 1010 patients were enrolled (screened) across 153 centres in 15 countries. 
Of the 1010 screened patients, 347 patients were not randomised; the main reason was failure to meet 
randomisation  criteria.  Most  often,  inclusion  criterion  4  (fibrosing  lung  disease  on  HRCT  with  disease 
extent of >10%; 8.7% of screened patients) and inclusion criterion 6 (DLCO corrected for haemoglobin 
≥30% and <80% of predicted normal at Visit 2; 7.3% of screened patients) were not met. 
All 663 randomised patients were treated. Over 52 weeks, 24.1% of patients in the nintedanib group 
and 14.8% of patients in the placebo group prematurely discontinued treatment. 
Reasons  (by  decreasing  overall  frequency)  were  adverse  events,  withdrawal  by  the  patient,  other 
reasons, protocol deviations, and loss to follow-up. 
Overall,  94.3%  of  patients  completed  the  52  weeks  planned  observation  time.  Reasons  for  not 
completing the planned observation time (by decreasing overall frequency) were death, withdrawal by 
the patient, and loss to follow-up. Vital status information at 52 weeks is presented for the patients who 
did  not  complete  the  52  weeks  observation  time.  Of  these  38  patients,  5  (13.2%,  0.8%  in  TS)  were 
reported to be alive and 31 (81.6%, 4.7% in TS) had died by Week 52 (Table 10.1: 1).

It was clarified that in case of premature discontinuation of trial medication during Part B, EOTB was to 
be done as soon as possible after last drug intake and a Followup Visit was to be completed 4 weeks 
after EOTB. 
Changes introduced by the trial statistical analysis plan 
In  addition  to  the  CTP-specified  sensitivity  analyses  for  the  primary  endpoint,  2  additional  sensitivity 
analyses were planned  
A tipping point sensitivity analysis was implemented 
A sensitivity analysis to mis-stratification was planned to be performed in case there were discrepancies 
for  more  than  3%  of  the  randomised  patients  in  the  HRCT  fibrotic  pattern  used  for  randomisation 
stratification (IRT) compared with that entered in the eCRF 
In  order  to  determine  whether  the  results  for  the  primary  endpoint  were  consistent  between  the  co-
primary population of patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern and the complementary population 
of patients with other HRCT fibrotic patterns, an additional analysis by subgroups based on HRCT pattern 
was planned. 
For the analyses of time-to-event endpoints, the CTP specified that a Cox proportional hazards model 
was  to  be  used  and  that  the  equality  of  the  hazard  rates  was  to  be  tested  by  the  Wald  test  for  the 
treatment effect at the 2-sided 5% significance level. While the Cox model was still employed to compute 
the effect size (HR), a stratified logrank test was used to evaluate the effect of nintedanib on time-to-
event endpoints compared to placebo. 
The  impact  of  the  underlying  ILD  diagnoses  on  the  primary  endpoint  results  was  investigated  by 
employing the method of excluding ILD diagnosis groups one-by-one. By doing so, the influence of the 
excluded ILD diagnosis group on the overall treatment effect was explored. The analysis was performed 
in the overall population. 
Requirement for previous ILD treatment 
A  note  to  file  dated  1  Mar  2017  provided  clarifications  regarding  the  requirement  for  previous  ILD 
treatment  of  eligible  patients.  The  requirement  for  worsening  of  the  ILD  despite  treatment  with 
unapproved medications used in clinical practice to treat ILD was aimed at supporting the inclusion of 
patients with ILDs at the stage when the underlying pathology is predominantly fibrotic and clinically 
progressive.  However,  for  some  ILDs  (e.g.  asbestosis),  resistance  to  anti-inflammatory  or 
immunomodulatory therapy might be expected, and a treating physician might have decided to use only 
non-pharmacologic treatment for their management. 
Protocol deviations 
Important protocol deviations (iPDs) 
Over 52 weeks, 13.7% of patients were reported with iPDs. The proportion of patients with iPDs was 
overall comparable in both treatment groups. The most common categories of iPDs were ‘trial medication 
and randomisation and concomitant medication. Of note, fewer patients in the nintedanib group than in 
the  placebo  group  received  restricted  medication  for  the  treatment  of  ILD  or  CTD  (iPD  category  D1). 
Restricted medication use started within the first 6 months of study treatment in all cases. Two patients 
were reported within the iPD category A1.3 “Extent of lung fibrosis ≤10% on HRCT performed within 12 
months of Visit 1”.

Over 52 weeks, 13.8% of patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern were reported with iPDs.  
The  proportion  of  patients  with  iPDs  was  slightly  lower  in  the  nintedanib  group  (10.2%)  than  in  the 
placebo group (17.5%). 
Baseline data 
•  Demographic data 
Overall population 
Demographic characteristics were similar in both treatment groups. Approximately half of the patients 
each were male (53.7%) and female (46.3%). The largest proportion of patients was White (73.6%), 
followed  by  Asian  patients  (24.6%).  The  mean  (SD)  age  was  65.8  (9.8)  years,  with  the  majority  of 
patients (60.8%) being ≥65 years old. About half of the patients (49.0%) had never smoked.

patients (29.6%). The mean (SD) age was 68.0 (8.4) years and 69.9% of patients were ≥65 years old 
(Table 15.1.7.1: 2). Almost half of the patients (42.7%) had never smoked. 
Trial indication characteristics 
Trial indication characteristics were comparable between the nintedanib and the placebo group. Based 
on  grouped  ILD  diagnoses,  about  one  quarter  of  patients  each  had  hypersensitivity  pneumonitis  and 
autoimmune ILDs, nearly one fifth of patients each had idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonia and 
unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, and the remaining patients had other ILDs. The mean 
(SD) time since first diagnosis of ILD based on imaging was 3.77 (3.75) years. In more than half of the 
patients,  the  time  since  first  diagnosis  of  ILD  was  ≤3  years.  Half  of  the  patients  had  had  a  clinically 
significant decline in FVC % predicted (≥10%) within 24 months of screening. 
ILD diagnosis 
Based on the grouped ILD diagnoses constructed by the applicant there are 5 broadly grouped 
diagnoses (Table 10 below): 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
hypersensitivity pneumonitis (26.1%) 
autoimmune ILDs (25.6%) 
o  Rheumatoid Arthritis-associated ILD (13.4%) 
o  Mixed connective tissue disease (2.9%) 
o  Systemic sclerosis-associated ILD (5.9%) 
o  Other fibrosing ILD* (3.4%) 
idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonia (18.9%)  
unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (17.2%) 
other ILDs (12.2%) 
o  Exposure-related ILD (5.9%) 
o  Sarcoidosis (1.8%) 
o  Other fibrosing ILD* (4.6%)  
The mean (SD) time since first diagnosis of ILD based on imaging was 3.77 (3.75) years. In more than 
half of the patients, the time since first diagnosis of ILD was ≤3 years. Half of the patients had had a 
clinically significant decline in FVC % predicted (≥10%) within 24 months of screening. Trial indication 
characteristics  were  generally  comparable  across  subgroups  and  balanced  between  the  treatment 
groups. All broad ILD diagnosis groups were subdivided into patients with HRCT  with UIP-like fibrotic 
pattern and without. Trial indication characteristics were balanced between these two treatment groups.

•  Overall population  
All baseline and on-treatment concomitant therapies over 52 weeks by ATC3 
Over  52  weeks,  98.8%  of  patients  received  at  least  1  baseline  or  concomitant  on-treatment  therapy 
(nintedanib: 98.8%, placebo: 98.8%). The use of baseline and concomitant on-treatment therapies was 
generally  comparable  between  the  treatment  groups  based  on  ATC3  and  preferred  name  with  the 
exceptions described below. 
The  most  common  baseline  and  concomitant  on-treatment  therapies,  which  were  used  by  >60%  of 
patients  overall,  were  anti-inflammatory  agents,  plain  corticosteroids  for  systemic  use,  and  drugs  for 
peptic ulcer and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. 
Antipropulsives and drugs for peptic ulcer and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease were more frequently 
used in the nintedanib than in the placebo group (difference between the treatment groups ≥10%). With 
regard  to  drugs  for  gastro-oesophageal  reflux  disease,  the  use  was  already  more  common  in  the 
nintedanib  group  at  baseline  (nintedanib:  58.4%,  placebo:  50.2%),  while  the  use  of  antipropulsives 
commenced nearly exclusively on treatment.  
Baseline therapies of interest by CDG 
At baseline, 17.5% of patients received at least 1 therapy according to pre-defined CDGs (nintedanib: 
17.2%,  placebo:  17.8%).  The  use  of  baseline  therapies  by  CDG  was  balanced  across  the  treatment 
groups.  The  most  frequent  baseline  medications  by  CDG  were  nonbiologic  DMARDS  with 
hydroxychloroquine and leflunomide as the most frequent preferred names.

All on-treatment restricted concomitant therapies over 52 weeks by CDG 
Over  52  weeks,  16.0%  of  patients  received  at  least  1  on-treatment  restricted  concomitant  therapy 
according  to  pre-defined  CDGs  (nintedanib:  10.8%,  placebo:  21.1%).  The  most  frequently  used 
restricted on-treatment medications were corticosteroids, with prednisone and prednisolone as the most 
frequent preferred names. Except for biologic DMARDs, which were used by <1% of patients in either 
treatment  group,  the  use  of  restricted  concomitant  therapies  by  CDG  was  consistently  lower  in  the 
nintedanib group.

Over  52  weeks,  5.0%  of  patients  received  at  least  1  on-treatment  prohibited  concomitant  therapy 
according to pre-defined CDGs (nintedanib: 4.8%, placebo: 5.1%). Prohibited concomitant medications 
used  were  antithrombotic  drugs  and  nintedanib  with  no  relevant  differences  between  the  treatment 
groups.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint of the trial was met in both co-primary populations, as  the adjusted treatment 
difference (nintedanib vs. placebo) in the annual rate of decline in FVC [mL/year] over 52 weeks was 
statistically significant at the two-sided alpha level of 5%: 
Overall population 
In the overall population, the adjusted annual rate of decline in FVC over 52  weeks was lower in the 
nintedanib group (-80.82 mL/year) than in the placebo group (-187.78 mL/year). The adjusted difference 
between the treatment groups was 106.96 mL/year (95% CI 65.42, 148.50; p<0.0001) 
Patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern 
In the co-primary population of patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern, the adjusted annual 
rate of decline in FVC over 52 weeks was lower in the nintedanib group (-82.87 mL/year) than in the 
placebo group (-211.07 mL/year). The adjusted difference between the treatment groups was 128.20 
mL/year (95% CI 70.81, 185.59; p<0.0001

Patients with other HRCT fibrotic patterns 
In the complementary population of patients with other HRCT fibrotic patterns, the adjusted annual rate 
of decline in FVC over 52 weeks was lower in the nintedanib group (-78.97 mL/year) than in the placebo 
group (-154.24 mL/year). The adjusted difference between the treatment groups was 75.28 mL/year.

•  Absolute change from baseline in PF-IQOLS summary score at Week 52 
Overall population 
In  the  overall  population,  PF-IQOLS  summary  scores  increased  from  baseline  to  Week  52  in  either 
treatment  group  (adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline,  nintedanib:  0.080  [95%  CI  0.001,  0.159]; 
placebo 0.198 [95% CI 0.121, 0.276]). The adjusted mean difference (-0.118, 95% CI -0.229, -0.008) 
indicated that treatment with nintedanib slowed impairment of quality of life as measured by PF-IQOLS 
compared with placebo. 
Patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern 
In patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern, adjusted mean changes from baseline in PF-IQOLS 
summary  scores  at  Week  52  were  0.063  (95%  CI  -0.032,  0.159)  in  the  nintedanib  group  and  0.190 
(95% CI 0.094, 0.285) in the placebo group. The adjusted mean difference (-0.126, 95% CI -0.261, 
0.009) was numerically in favour of the nintedanib group compared with the placebo group. 
•  Absolute change from baseline in DLCO % predicted at Week 52 
Overall population 
In the overall population, adjusted mean changes from baseline in DLco % predicted at Week 52 were -
5.67% in the nintedanib group and -5.26% in the placebo group. The adjusted mean difference between 
treatment groups was small (-0.41%; 95% CI -2.58, 1.76) 
Patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern 
In patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern, adjusted mean changes from baseline in 
DLco % predicted at Week 52 were -5.92% in the nintedanib group and -6.29% in thenplacebo group. 
The adjusted mean difference between treatment groups was small (0.37%;95% CI -2.38, 3.12) 
Further endpoints over the whole trial (Part A+B) up to DBL1  
Data collected beyond 52 weeks (Part B) and available at the DBL1 snapshot were included as supportive 
information.  Only  time-to-event  efficacy  endpoints  were  specified  and  evaluated  over  the  whole  trial 
(Part A+B). 
•  Time  to  first  acute  ILD  exacerbation  or  death  over  the  whole  trial  (Part  A+B)  up  to 
DBL1 
In  the overall population, a  lower  proportion  of  patients in  the nintedanib  group  (12.3%)  than  in  the 
placebo group (17.8%) had an event of first acute ILD exacerbation or death over the whole trial. The 
HR based on the Cox regression indicated that the risk of first acute ILD exacerbation or death was 32% 
lower in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.46, 1.01). 
Patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern 
In  patients  with  HRCT  with  UIP-like  fibrotic  pattern,  a  lower  proportion  of  patients  in  the  nintedanib 
group (13.6%) than in the placebo group (21.4%) had an event of first acute ILD exacerbation or death 
over the whole trial. Treatment with nintedanib reduced the risk of first acute ILD exacerbation or death 
by 39% compared with placebo, as indicated by the HR of 0.61 (95% CI 0.38, 0.98).

•  Time to death over the whole trial (Part A+B) up to DBL1 
Overall population 
In  the  overall  population,  a  lower  proportion  of  patients  in  the  nintedanib  group  (8.1%)  than  in  the 
placebo group (11.5%) died over the whole trial. The HR based on the Cox regression indicated that the 
risk of death was 30% lower in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.43, 
1.15) 
Patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern 
In  patients  with  HRCT  with  UIP-like  fibrotic  pattern,  a  lower  proportion  of  patients  in  the  nintedanib 
group (9.7%) than in the placebo group (15.0%) died over the whole trial. The HR based on the Cox 
regression indicated that the risk of death was 37% lower in the nintedanib group than in the placebo 
group (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.36, 1.10) 
Other endpoints for the whole trial  
•  Time to death due to respiratory cause over the whole trial (Part A+B) up to DBL1 
For both co-primary populations there was trend towards reduced risk in the nintedanib group. 
•  Time to progression or death over the whole trial (Part A+B) up to DBL1 
Overall population  
Treatment with nintedanib reduced the risk of progression or death by 33% compared with placebo, as 
indicated by the HR of 0.67 (95% CI 0.53, 0.85). 
Patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern 
Treatment with nintedanib reduced the risk of progression or death by 30% compared with placebo, as 
indicated by the HR of 0.70 (95% CI 0.52, 0.94).

Ancillary analyses 
Primary endpoint  
Figure 12: Forest plot for the primary endpoint analysis in subgroups – TS  
Overall population 
An additional analysis investigated the impact of the underlying ILD diagnoses by employing the method 
of excluding ILD diagnosis groups one-by-one. By doing so, the influence of the excluded ILD diagnosis 
group on the overall treatment effect was explored. The point estimates and confidence intervals were 
very similar across these analyses, showing that the treatment effect was not driven by one of the ILD 
diagnosis groups.

Patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern 
None of the demographic characteristics (gender, age, and race) influenced substantially the treatment 
effect of nintedanib vs. placebo in patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern. All point estimates 
for the adjusted treatment difference in annual rate of decline in FVC over 52 weeks were in favour of 
nintedanib compared with placebo, and all confidence intervals of subgroup results included the point 
estimate of the population of patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  applicant  submitted  one  study  (INBUILD study)  investigating  the  use  of  nintedanib  in  patients 
with  different  fibrosing  interstitial  lung  diseases  (ILDs)  with  progressive  phenotype  (progressive 
Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease (PF-ILD).  
INBUILD study had two parts (A and B) and both of them were double blinded.  Part A had 52 weeks 
duration and was completed by all enrolled patients. The main benefit-risk assessment of nintedanib in 
patients with PF-ILD was based on the efficacy and safety data collected in Part A. Part B of the study 
was still ongoing at the on database lock point (DBL1). Additional data collected beyond 52 weeks (Part 
B)  and  available  at  the  DBL1  snapshot  were  provided  as  supportive  information  only.  The  applicant 
provided additional Part B data. 
Inclusion criteria  
INBUILD study enrolled patients that exhibited a progressive fibrosing phenotype (independently from 
the underlying cause of their ILDs). 
Assessment report

Patients were enrolled to this study based on the predicted progression pattern rather than underlying 
aetiology and underlying ILD diagnoses. The concept of progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease 
(PF-ILD) is not well established and it was not validated well in clinical practice. Further, there are no 
uniformly accepted criteria as to how patients with progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease should 
be defined. Therefore an ad hoc expert group meeting was conveyed.  (see later in this section) 
All enrolled patients had to have diffuse fibrosing lung disease of >10% extent on HRCT.  
Progressive  disease  was  defined  based  on  the  presence  of  significant  decline  in  FVC  %  (>10%)  or 
marginal decline in FVC % (5-10%) if accompanied with worsening of respiratory symptoms or increasing 
extent of fibrotic changes on chest imaging. Further, worsening of respiratory symptoms together with 
increasing extent of fibrotic changes on chest imaging was sufficient to diagnose of progressive disease.  
It needs to be highlighted that all patients enrolled to the study needed to show progression of disease 
despite treatment with unapproved medications used in clinical practice to treat ILD. Therefore, in this 
study, nintedanib was given as a second line therapy only. Further, the study population was limited to 
patients with baseline DLCO ≥30% and <80% and FVC ≥45%. This is now reflected in the SmPC.The 
trial population was planned to be enriched for patients with HRCT with a UIP-like fibrotic pattern. It was 
postulated by the applicant that the prognosis and clinical behaviour of chronic fibrosing ILDs, particularly 
those with a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern on HRCT is similar to that of IPF. 
UIP-like fibrotic pattern on HRCT was determined based on the presence of the following criteria:  
-Definite honeycomb lung destruction with basal and peripheral predominance or presence of reticular 
abnormality 
-the absence of traction bronchiectasis consistent with fibrosis with basal and peripheral predominance  
-atypical features  
Exclusion criteria   
The  main  exclusion  criterion  in  the  study  was  clinical  diagnosis  of  IPF.  In  addition,  patients  with  a 
significant  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  were  excluded  and  this  has  been  reflected  in  the  SmPC 
section 4.4 (see below) including a recommendation that Ofev should not be used in patients with severe 
pulmonary hypertension.  
Section 4.4. ..”Patients with significant pulmonary hypertension (cardiac index ≤ 2 L/min/m², or 
parenteral epoprostenol/treprostinil, or significant right heart failure) were excluded from the INBUILD 
and SENSCIS trials.” 
Patients  with  cardiovascular  disease  and  with  an  increased  bleeding  risk  were  excluded,  and  this  is 
already reflected in the SmPC.  
Study treatments  
In  the  study  patients  were  randomised  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  nintedanib  150  mg  bid  or  placebo  bid.  Dose 
reductions to 100mg bid were allowed in case of AEs (in line with the current recommendation for IPF 
patients). 
Concomitant  medications  (named  in  the  protocol  as  restricted  medications)  such  as  azathioprine, 
cyclosporine, tacrolimus, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate, mofetil and oral corticosteroids 
>20mg were not allowed to be used during first 6 months of the study. These medications had to be 
discontinued  prior  to  study  entry  randomisation.  It  is  considered  that  sudden  withdrawal  of 
immunomodulatory therapies prior to study entry risks bias in favour of a larger treatment effect due to 
the possibility of greater rebound in the placebo arm. To prevent this, the applicant introduced at least 
4 weeks wash out period.   
In case of significant deterioration, these restricted therapies were allowed to be introduced at week 26. 
This  approach  is  understandable  from  an  ethical  perspective  however,  theoretically  it  could  be  an 
additional confounding factor. The applicant was requested to comment on the potential influence of the 
use  of  these  restricted  medications  on  the  study  results.  The  efficacy  data  at  week  26  (before  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/315975/2020  
Page 62/116 
 
 
 
 
treatment  with  this  medication  was  started)  was  presented  as  well  as  subgroup  analysis  for  patients 
receiving  restricted  medications  and  it  was  concluded  that  there  was  no  pattern  or  influence 
demonstrated. The SmPC in section 5.1 clarifies that patients were required to have progressed despite 
management deemed appropriate in clinical practice. for the patient’s relevant ILD. 
For patients with ILD associated with connective tissue disorder (CTD) other approved medications used 
for treatment of underlying disease were allowed provided that the dose was  stable 6 weeks prior to 
enrolment.  
For  safety  reasons  full  dose  therapeutic  anticoagulation  or  high  dose  antiplatelet  therapy  were  not 
allowed. 
Endpoints  
The primary endpoint of this study was the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) which is 
considered acceptable. The same primary endpoint was used in the pivotal study investigating the effect 
of nintedanib in the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).  
However, it is important to highlight that the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) is only 
a surrogate endpoint and therefore it is considered that a positive trend in other endpoints investigating 
direct  clinical  effects  (for  example  patients  reported  outcomes  or  survival)  needs  to  be  shown  in  the 
study. This is detailed hereafter. 
The primary endpoint was evaluated in two co-primary populations defined for the analyses in this trial: 
All patients (the overall population) or patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern. Only the primary 
endpoint for co-primary populations was evaluated in a confirmatory manner. 
The  remaining  patients,  i.e.  those  with  patients  with  other  HRCT  fibrotic  patterns  were  termed  the 
“complementary” population. 
In the study there were three main secondary endpoints – absolute change from baseline in King’s Brief 
Interstitial Lung Disease (K-BILD) total score at week 52, time to first acute ILD exacerbation or death 
over 52 weeks and time to death over 52 weeks.  
The K-BILD score is a validated health status questionnaire for interstitial lung disease and correlates 
highly with the St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire which was included as a key secondary endpoint 
in the pivotal trials of IPF. The use of K-BILD score was discussed and agreed during the scientific advice 
with CHMP.   
There were a few other secondary endpoints which investigated patients reported outcomes including 
Living  with  Pulmonary  Fibrosis  Symptoms  and  Impact  Questionnaire  (L-PF),  EuroQol  5-Dimensional 
quality of life Questionnaire (EQ-5D) and Pulmonary Fibrosis Impact on Quality of Life Scale (PF-IQOLS).  
Time  to  first  acute  ILD  exacerbation  was  measured  also  in  the  study  and  the  definition  of  acute 
exacerbation was similar to those used in the pivotal studies in IPF.  
The proportion of patients with an absolute decline from baseline in FVC % >10% was investigated.  It 
is known that decline in FVC % >10% is linked to poor prognosis in patients with ILD. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Baseline characteristics  
663 patients were randomised to the study (331 patients in the placebo group and 332 in the nintedanib 
group). The discontinuation rate was higher in patients receiving nintedanib. Over 52 weeks, 24.1% of 
patients in the nintedanib group and 14.8% of patients in the placebo group prematurely discontinued 
treatment. Reasons were adverse events, withdrawal by the patient, other reasons, protocol deviations, 
and loss to follow-up. 
Assessment report  
EMA/315975/2020  
Page 63/116 
 
 
 
In general, demographic characteristics were balanced between the two treatment groups in both co-
primary populations and in the complementary population.  The mean age in the overall population was 
65.8 years and 60.8% of patients were ≥65 years old. 
It is noted that the population of patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern consisted of more male 
(60.0%) than female patients (40.0%) whereas the inverse ratio in relation to percentage of male and 
female was observed in the complementary population. 
In  the  overall  population  about  one  quarter  of  patients  had  the  underlying  ILD  diagnoses  of 
hypersensitivity  pneumonitis  (26%)  or  autoimmune  ILDs  (25%).  Nearly  one  fifth  of  patients  had 
idiopathic  non-specific  interstitial  pneumonia  (19%)  or  unclassifiable  idiopathic  interstitial  pneumonia 
(17.25%). The remaining patients had other ILDs. The mean (SD) time since first diagnosis of ILD based 
on imaging was 3.77 (3.75) years. For the majority of patients (68%) the diagnosis was not confirmed 
by the surgical biopsy. 
For 50% of patient’s diagnosis of progressive fibrotic disease at baseline was based on the presence of 
clinically significant decline in FVC % predicted (≥10%).  
62.% of patients enrolled to the study had UIP-like pattern only according to central HRCT review. In 
this subgroup (second co-primary population) slightly more patients had diagnosis of autoimmune ILDs 
(30%)  as  compared to the  overall  population.  The percentage of  patients  with  idiopathic  non-specific 
interstitial pneumonia and unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia was similar as reported in the 
overall population. 21 % of patients had a diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. 
Not all types of ILDs with progressive behaviour were sufficiently represented in the study. For example, 
only  5  %  of  patients  had  environmental/occupational  fibrosing  lung  diseases  whereas  it  seems  that 
patients  with  idiopathic  pneumonia  with  autoimmune  features  were  not  enrolled.  Only  12  patients  in 
total had sarcoidosis. Finally, within the group of patients with autoimmune ILD the majority of patients 
had  rheumatoid  arthritis  associated  ILD  whereas  only  a  few  patients  had  other  types  of  autoimmune 
ILD.  
Furthermore, a relatively high percentage of patients had the underlying ILD diagnoses of unclassifiable 
idiopathic interstitial pneumonia.  
Primary efficacy results  
In the study there were two co-primary populations i.e. overall population and the population of patients 
with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern only. In both these populations in patients receiving treatment 
with nintedanib for 52 weeks the annual rate of decline in FVC was statistically significantly lower 
as compared to patients receiving placebo. In the overall population the adjusted difference between the 
treatment groups was 106.96 mL/year (95% CI 65.42, 148.50; p<0.0001) and in patients with UIP-like 
fibrotic pattern- the adjusted difference between the treatment groups was 128.20 mL/year (95% CI 
70.81, 185.59; p<0.0001). The reported differences between treatment and placebo groups was similar 
to those observed in studies in patients with IPF (In trials INPULSIS-1, INPULSIS-2 (pooled data) the 
observed difference between the treatment and placebo group was 109.9 ml).  
Sensitivity analyses (multiple imputation approach 1, 2 and 3) support the result of the primary analysis. 
It  is noted that  in  the  complementary  population  (i.e.  patients  with  other  HRCT  fibrotic  patterns)  the 
treatment  effect  was  smaller  (the  adjusted  difference  between  the  treatment  groups  was  75.28 
mL/year).  
Secondary efficacy results  
Patients reported outcomes 
In  the  study  there  were  a  few  secondary  endpoints  which  investigated  patients  reported  outcomes 
including  The  King’s  Brief  Interstitial  Lung  Disease  (K-BILD)  score,  Living  with  Pulmonary  Fibrosis 
Symptoms and Impact Questionnaire (L-PF), EuroQol 5-Dimensional quality of life Questionnaire (EQ-
5D) and Pulmonary Fibrosis Impact on Quality of Life Scale (PF-IQOLS).  
Assessment report  
EMA/315975/2020  
Page 64/116 
 
 
 
The  King’s  Brief  Interstitial  Lung  Disease  (K-BILD)  score  was  investigated  in  the  study  as  a  main 
secondary endpoint. For this endpoint statistically significant differences between treatment groups were 
not reported for both co-primary populations. 
On  the  other  hand,  significant  improvements  in  symptoms  were  recorded  for  other  endpoints  which 
investigated patients reported outcomes in the study.  
The results of L-PF symptoms domain scores for both co-primary populations indicated that nintedanib 
prevented worsening of dyspnoea and cough symptoms compared with placebo. The results of L-PF total 
score, impact score, and symptoms total score were also in favour of nintedanib treatment.  
Further, the improvement of quality of life was reported in the overall population as using Pulmonary 
Fibrosis Impact on Quality of Life Scale. 
Time to death, time to first acute ILD exacerbation or death 
In the study time to death was investigated as a secondary endpoint. The analysis of time to death over 
52 weeks suggested a similar risk of death between treatment groups in the overall population whereas 
in patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern there was trend towards reduced risk of death in the 
nintedanib group (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.32, 1.47).  
In relation to the composite endpoint of time to first acute ILD exacerbation or death similar observations 
were made i.e. no differences between treatment groups for the overall population and a trend towards 
reduced risk in patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.36, 1.24). 
Other secondary endpoints  
A  relative  decline  from  baseline  in  FVC  %  predicted  of  >10%  was  found  to  be  linked  to  increased 
mortality. 
In  the  overall  population,  fewer  patients  in  the  nintedanib  group  (40.7%)  than  in  the  placebo  group 
(48.9%) had a relative decline from baseline in FVC % predicted of >10% at Week 52 according to the 
worst-case analysis. The adjusted odds ratio was in favour of nintedanib compared with placebo (0.70; 
95% CI 0.52, 0.96). Similar results in favour of nintedanib were reported in patients with HRCT with 
UIP-like fibrotic pattern. The adjusted odds ratio was in favour of nintedanib compared with placebo and 
was 0.63 (95% CI 0.43, 0.94). 
There was no difference between the treatment groups in relation to absolute change from baseline in 
DLCO % predicted at Week 52.  
Part B data  
As part of this submission the applicant provided data collected beyond 52 weeks (Part B) and available 
at  the  DBL1  snapshot.    Only  time-to-event  efficacy  endpoints  were  specified  and  evaluated  over  the 
whole trial (Part A+B). 
There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  in  relation  to  the  time  to  death  over  the  whole  trial 
however, for both populations there was trend towards reduced risk in the nintedanib group. 
Reduced risk in the nintedanib group was reported for time to progression or death over the whole trial 
(for both co-primary populations) and for time to first acute ILD exacerbation or death over the whole 
trial (for patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern). It is noted that a long-term extension study 
in this population is planned by the applicant.   
Subgroup analysis  
The applicant presented the results in subgroups depending on gender, age group, race, baseline FVC 
% predicted, and underlying clinical ILD diagnosis (grouped) for overall population. For the co-primary 
population of patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern, the subgroups were defined by gender, 
age group, and race. Furthermore, an additional analysis investigated the impact of the underlying ILD 
diagnoses by employing the method of excluding ILD diagnosis groups one-by-one was performed.  
It can be agreed with the applicant that no major differences in treatment effects were observed. The 
direction of effect estimates for all analysed subgroups was consistent with the overall effect.  In addition, 
Assessment report  
EMA/315975/2020

it was shown that the treatment effect was not driven by one of the ILD diagnosis groups investigated 
in the study.  
The following additional subgroup analyses were provided by the applicant: 
• 
For  patients  with  HRCT  with  UIP-like  fibrotic  pattern  depending  on  underlying  clinical  ILD 
diagnosis (grouped) 
•  Depending on criteria used for diagnosis of progressive fibrotic disease at baseline  
• 
• 
• 
For patients with UIP-like fibrotic pattern (second-co-primary population) depending on which 
baseline UIP criteria were present on HRCT 
For patients with and without diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension  
In relation to the use restricted medications in the study. 
Efficacy in the complementary population (i.e. patients with other HRCT fibrotic patterns) 
In the study, there were two co-primary populations: All patients (the overall population) or patients 
with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern. The remaining patients, i.e. those with patients with other HRCT 
fibrotic patterns were termed the “complementary” population. 
There  are  some  uncertainties  in  relation  to  the  efficacy  in  patients  with  other  HRCT  fibrotic  patterns, 
including  results  of  secondary  endpoints  in  this  subpopulation  which  needed  further  discussion  with 
regards to use in patients with other HRCT fibrotic patterns. 
a) There was a concern that the positive results seen in the overall population were mostly driven by the 
results in the subgroup of patients with UIP- fibrotic patterns. 
b) In patients with other HRCT fibrotic patterns, the annual rate of decline in FVC (primary endpoint) 
was lower as compared to patients receiving placebo.  The treatment effect in this subgroup was smaller  
as  compared  to  patients  with    UIP  –  fibrotic  pattern.  In  patients  with  UIP-like  fibrotic  pattern-  the 
adjusted difference between the treatment groups was 128.20 mL/year whereas the adjusted difference 
in patients with other HRCT fibrotic patterns was 75.28 mL/year). 
In view of the uncertainties, an Ad Hoc Expert Group was conveyed to discuss questions addressed to 
the Experts as follows. Two patient representatives attended the Expert Meeting.  
Additional information from Ad Hoc Expert Group  
The minutes of the expert group are detailed below.  
Questions raised to the Experts by CHMP. 
1.  The experts are asked to discuss and give their opinion whether progressive Fibrosing 
Interstitial Lung Disease can be considered an identifiable disease and how should these 
patients be defined in clinical practice? The experts are asked for their opinion whether they 
are in agreement with the diagnostic criteria proposed by the MAH in this study? 
2.  Can the results seen in the above study populations be extrapolated to patients with ILD with 
progressive behaviour who were under-represented. For example, only 5 % of patients had 
environmental/occupational fibrosing lung diseases whereas it seems that patients with 
idiopathic pneumonia with autoimmune features were not enrolled. Only 12 patients in total 
had sarcoidosis. Finally, within the group of patients with autoimmune ILD the majority of 
patients had rheumatoid arthritis associated ILD whereas only a few patients had other types 
of autoimmune ILDs 
3.  The experts are asked to provide an opinion on whether there are other ILD types with a 
progressive behaviour that may be relevant if a general indication is granted. (i.e not enrolled 
to the study). Given the ‘patient selection criteria’ used to enrol a highly selective patient 
population, please comment on the appropriate patient population where you consider the 
clinical use of the product is supported by the generated evidence.

4.  All patients enrolled to the study needed to show progression of disease despite the treatment 
with unapproved medications used in clinical practice to treat ILD. Therefore, in this study 
nintedanib was given as a second line therapy only. What is the experts’ opinion on the 
importance of this criterion to select the patients with ILD with progressing behaviour and the 
type fibrotic pattern seen on HRCT in the context of response to treatment?  
Minutes of the Expert Group meeting :  
1.  The experts are asked to discuss and give their opinion whether progressive 
Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease can be considered an identifiable disease and how 
should these patients be defined in clinical practice? The experts are asked for their 
opinion whether they are in agreement with the diagnostic criteria proposed by the 
MAH in this study? 
The experts debated the likelihood of a reliable identification of the Progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung 
Disease in the clinical practise and in general, there was a good agreement that indeed, the disease can 
be diagnosed by a specialist experienced in this field. It is recognised that although the grouping of the 
individual conditions might not be so straightforward and fully established, for pragmatic purposes, it is 
accepted.  
They also reviewed the inclusion criteria used by the MAH in the pivotal study INBUILD and believed that 
these can help in guiding the disease identification but are not mandatory. For example, the requirement 
to  define  a  time  period to  show  ILD  was  thought  be  unnecessary.  Occurrence  of  a  relative  decline  in 
forced  vital  capacity  (FVC)  ≥5–<10%  predicted  and  increased  extent  of  fibrosis  on  high-resolution 
computed  tomography  (HRCT)  was  considered  helpful.  In  general,  the  results  and  findings  of  the 
INBUILD  trial  were  considered  very  important  in  the  recent  developments  in  the  respiratory  field. 
Nevertheless,  at  least  one  expert  believed  that  the  CT  scans  and  their  analysis  could  have  been 
conducted in a better way. 
The experts expressed that they would not support the restriction of the indication to the exact list of 
individual  conditions,  inclusion  criteria  or  requirements,  but  would  rather  these  to  be  described  as  a 
general guidance for the treating physicians and leave the treatment decision to their discretion.  
There  was  quite  a  strong  view  on  the  importance  of  the  continuation  (or  initiation)  of  established  
therapies  for  a  patients  with  a  defined  individual  medical  condition.  Most  of  the  existing  effective 
therapies are to be continued and it is recommended to reflect this in the labelling of Ofev, in case of an 
approval.  
2.  Can the results seen in the above study populations be extrapolated to patients with 
ILD with progressive behaviour who were under-represented. For example, only 5 % 
of patients had environmental/occupational fibrosing lung diseases whereas it 
seems that patients with idiopathic pneumonia with autoimmune features were not 
enrolled. Only 12 patients in total had sarcoidosis. Finally, within the group of 
patients with autoimmune ILD the majority of patients had rheumatoid arthritis 
associated ILD whereas only a few patients had other types of autoimmune ILDs 
The extrapolation of data to under- or not-represented diseases was seen as quite a realistic option in 
this field, especially due to the similar patho-mechanisms, the rarity of these individual conditions and 
the  infeasibility  to  conduct  controlled  trials.  The  findings  of  the  study  were  considered  sufficient  to 
support the extrapolation. The experts expressed the view that rare conditions should not be excluded 
Assessment report  
EMA/315975/2020  
Page 67/116 
 
 
 
 
 
from  the  indication  in  case  of  an  approval.  The  EPAR  should  describe  these  observations  and  their 
limitations. 
The  condition of  sarcoidosis  was  discussed  separately  and  the  low  number of patients enrolled in the 
pivotal  trial  was  noticed;  hence,  the  clear  treatment  benefit  is  difficult  to  establish.  However,  the 
subgroup  analysis  in  this  trial  wasn’t  pre-defined.  It  would  be  optimal  if  diagnosis  of  sarcoidosis  is 
conducted in specialised centres and treatment with Ofev could be initiated on top of existing therapies 
(e.g. anti-inflammatory). This distinction was felt necessary as sarcoidosis is a more common disease 
than many of the other diseases included, yet more rarely progresses to fibrosing interstitial lung disease, 
hence its relative under-representation in the INBUILD trial. Indeed, progressive fibrosing sarcoidosis 
resistant to therapy is a difficult diagnosis to make. The systemic nature of the disease is important to 
take into account. Other treatment options in the form of immunomodulators are being investigated in 
this  area  and  it  was  stressed  that  sarcoidosis  is  a  special  case  in  this  regard.  Using  nintedanib  in 
preference to other second line therapies may not be beneficial and the experts recommended this to be 
reflected in the EPAR. 
3.  The experts are asked to provide an opinion on whether there are other ILD types 
with a progressive behaviour that may be relevant if a general indication is granted. 
(i.e not enrolled to the study). Given the ‘patient selection criteria’ used to enrol a 
highly selective patient population, please comment on the appropriate patient 
population where you consider the clinical use of the product is supported by the 
generated evidence.  
As described above, the experts expressed their concern about the separate diagnosis and management 
of  sarcoidosis.  In  addition,  granulomatosis  with  polyangiitis  (formerly  called  Wegener's),  can  be 
associated  with  and  behave  like  the  progressive  fibrosis  and  treatment  with  Ofev  may  therefore  be 
relevant. 
Overall, the patient representative, diagnosed with IPF and undergone transplantation, commented that 
there seems to be general positive impact of Ofev in IPF patients, based on the presented evidence. 
4.  All patients enrolled to the study needed to show progression of disease despite the 
treatment with unapproved medications used in clinical practice to treat ILD. 
Therefore, in this study nintedanib was given as a second line therapy only. What is 
the experts’ opinion on the importance of this criterion to select the patients with 
ILD with progressing behaviour and the type fibrotic pattern seen on HRCT in the 
context of response to treatment?  
The experts were in good agreement, that proven progression of disease under previous therapy wasn’t 
a necessary requirement for initiation of the treatment with Ofev, if approved in this indication. Hence, 
in the experts’ view, the use of Ofev can be started with or without an ongoing background treatment 
and  there  is  no  need  to  explicitly  limit  the  indication  to  first  or/and  second  line.  Based  on  individual 
patient’s  situation,  the  treating  physicians  should  be  able  to  balance  the  anti-inflammatory  and 
immunosuppressive treatments in order to manage the condition and achieve the key goal, i.e. to halt 
the progression of the disease.  
Equally, from the patient’s perspective, there is a clear need to slow down progression of the disease.  
The experts also considered that a long-term follow up via disease registry might be discussed between 
the applicant and the CHMP would be beneficial. 
The  CHMP  considered  the  Experts  opinion  which  supported  the  view  that  patients  originating  from 
different baseline diagnoses with progressive fibrosis behaved similarly and therefore could be grouped 
as  a  progressive  IPF  like  phenotype.  They  also  confirmed  the  ability  of  clinicians  to  diagnose  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/315975/2020  
Page 68/116 
 
 
 
 
distinguish  patients  with  progressive  phenotype  in  clinical  practice  and  therefore  considered  the 
indication approvable as suggested by the applicant. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
It is considered that nintedanib can be approved for the treatment of patients with other chronic fibrosing 
interstitial lung diseases with a progressive phenotype. However, the CHMP recommended the company 
to generate further data in the postmarking setting for the different phenotypes. The company agreed 
to  submit  scientific  advice  to  discuss  further  with  CHMP  how  data  can  be  generated.  A  Letter  of 
undertaking has been received to address the CHMP recommendation. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The main analysis of trial 1199.247 (INBUILD®) was performed after the last randomised patient had 
completed the 52-week Visit (Part A). All safety analyses in trial 1199.247 were based on the treated 
set (TS), i.e. all patients who received at least 1 dose of trial medication. The main safety assessment 
used data collected up to Week 52. Supportive safety analyses used data collected over the whole trial 
(Part A+B) up to DBL1 snapshot. These are further referred to as 'over the whole trial (Part A+B) up to 
DBL1'.  
The analysis of AEs was based on the concept of treatment-emergent AEs, i.e. all AEs occurring between 
the first and the last intake of trial medication plus 28 days (residual effect period) were assigned on-
treatment. 
Some details of population baseline characteristics are included below which give a background for the 
safety assessment such as baseline diagnosis, conditions and concomitant medication.  
Baseline conditions 
Almost  all  patients  had  at  least  one  baseline  condition  (97.4%).  The  most  common  conditions  were 
hypertension, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and menopause in all 3 populations. 
Overall, 97.4% of patients had at least 1 baseline condition (nintedanib: 96.7%, placebo:98.2%). The 
incidence  of  baseline  conditions  by  SOC  and  PT  was  generally  comparable  between  both  treatment 
groups.  Differences  >5%  between  the  treatment  groups  were  observed  for  the  SOCs  ‘eye  disorders’ 
(nintedanib:  16.3%,  placebo:  22.4%)  and  ‘reproductive  system  and  breast  disorders’  (nintedanib: 
13.9%, placebo: 6.6%). In the latter SOC, the frequency of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia 
was slightly higher in the nintedanib group (6.9%) than in the placebo group (2.4%). The most common 
baseline conditions (≥20% in either treatment group at PT level) were hypertension (nintedanib: 48.8%, 
placebo:44.4%),  gastro-oesophageal  reflux  disease  (26.2%  vs.  27.2%)  and  menopause  (21.4%  vs. 
22.4%). 
In the population of patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern, 98.3% of patients had at least 1 
baseline condition (nintedanib: 98.1%, placebo: 98.5%). The incidence of baseline conditions by SOC 
and  PT  was  generally  comparable  between  both  treatment  groups.  Differences  >5%  between  the 
treatment  groups  were  observed  for  the  SOCs  ““respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders”“ 
(nintedanib:  34.5%,  placebo:  40.8%),  ““cardiac  disorders”“  (21.8%  vs.  27.2%),  ““eye  disorders”“ 
(16.5%  vs.  26.2%),  and  ““reproductive  system  and  breast  disorders”“  (16.0%  vs.  5.8%).  However, 
there were no differences >5% between the treatment groups for any preferred term within these SOCs 
besides benign prostatic hyperplasia (nintedanib: 8.7%, placebo: 2.4%). The most common (≥20% in 
either treatment group at PT level) baseline conditions were as in the whole population, hypertension

(nintedanib: 49.5%, placebo: 43.7%) followed by gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (26.2% vs. 26.2%) 
and menopause (23.8% vs. 19.9%). 
Cardiovascular history: 
 Relevant cardiovascular history was overall comparable between the treatment groups in all 3 patient 
populations. Overall, 18.7% of patients had relevant cardiovascular history (nintedanib: 16.9%, placebo: 
20.5%).  The  proportions  of  patients  with  myocardial  infarction  and  transient  ischemic  attacks  were 
numerically  higher  in  the  placebo  group,  but  there  were  no  relevant  differences  between  treatment 
groups. 
In the population of patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern, 21.1% of patients had relevant 
cardiovascular history (nintedanib: 18.9%, placebo: 23.3%). The proportions of patients with myocardial 
infarction and transient ischemic attacks were numerically higher in the placebo group, but there were 
no relevant differences between treatment groups. 
Concomitant therapies: 
Baseline therapies were those started before the first trial drug intake and taken after or on the day of 
the first trial drug intake. Concomitant on-treatment therapies were started between first and last trial 
drug  intake  (included).  Customised  drug  groupings  (CDGs)  of  interest  have  been  defined  for  trial 
1199.247. 
The  use  of  baseline  and  concomitant  on-treatment  therapies  was  generally  comparable  between  the 
treatment groups based on ATC3 and preferred name with the exceptions described below. The most 
common  baseline  and  concomitant  on-treatment  therapies,  which  were  used  by  >60%  of  patients 
overall, were anti-inflammatory agents, plain corticosteroids for systemic use, and drugs for peptic ulcer 
and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The high incidence of the first two categories was driven by the 
common use of prednisone (nintedanib: 30.4%, placebo: 34.4%) and prednisolone (25.9% vs. 20.8%), 
which  were  the  most  frequent  preferred  names  in  these  categories.  Furthermore,  paracetamol  was 
commonly used (23.2% vs. 24.5%). On preferred name level, all other medications were taken by <20% 
of patients across both treatment groups. 
Antipropulsives and drugs for peptic ulcer and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease were more frequently 
used in the nintedanib than in the placebo group (difference between the treatment groups ≥10%) over 
52  weeks.  With  regard  to  drugs  for  gastro-oesophageal  reflux  disease,  the  use  was  already  more 
common  in  the  nintedanib  group  at  baseline  (nintedanib:  58.4%,  placebo:  50.2%),  while  the  use  of 
antipropulsives commenced nearly exclusively on treatment (baseline use: nintedanib: 1.2%, placebo: 
0.9%).  
Customised drug groupings (CDGs) were used to analyse the use of therapies of intere st.At baseline, 
17.5%  of  patients  received  at  least  1  therapy  according  to  pre-defined  CDGs  (nintedanib:  17.2%, 
placebo: 17.8%). The use of baseline therapies by CDG was balanced across the treatment groups. The 
most frequent baseline medications by CDG were non-biologic 
DMARDS with hydroxychloroquine and leflunomide as the most frequent preferred names (Table 10 of 
the  SCS).  The  most  frequently  used  restricted  on-treatment  medications  were  corticosteroids,  with 
prednisone and prednisolone as the most frequent preferred names. Except for biologic DMARDs, which 
were used by <1% of patients in either treatment group, the use of restricted concomitant therapies by 
CDG was consistently lower in the nintedanib group .

Table 32 Baseline therapies by CDG and preferred name with incidence at preferred name level of 
>1% in at least 1 treatment group – TS  
Overall population 
In the population of patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern, 99.5% of patients received at least 
1 baseline or concomitant on-treatment therapy over 52 weeks (nintedanib: 100.0%, placebo: 99.0%). 
The  use  of  baseline  and  concomitant  on-treatment  therapies  was  generally  comparable  between  the 
treatment groups.   
Patient exposure 
Exposure duration over 52 weeks: 
Exposure to investigational treatment was overall comparable between the treatment groups. Median 
(range) duration of exposure was 12.2 (0.0, 12.2) months in the nintedanib group and 12.2 (0.3, 12.2) 
months in the placebo group; the mean (SD) exposure was 10.3 (3.8) months in the nintedanib group 
and  11.2  (2.6)  months in the  placebo  group.  The  mean  (SD)  dose intensity  was  slightly  lower  in the 
nintedanib  group  (nintedanib:  92.54%  (11.87),  placebo:  98.59%  (5.43)),  which  was  due  to  a  higher 
number of patients with dose reductions or treatment interruptions in the nintedanib group. Duration of 
exposure >12 months in the placebo group 84% (n=278) and the nintedanib group 74.7% (n=248). 
The duration of exposure in patient-years for the placebo group was 310.57 and nintedanib group 285.79 
patient years.  
In both treatment groups, investigator-defined drug-related AEs were the main reason for dose reduction 
(nintedanib:  87.3%  of  dose  reductions,  placebo:  70.0%)  and  treatment  interruptions  (nintedanib: 
71.3% of interruptions, placebo: 48.8%. Premature treatment discontinuation was also more frequent 
in the 
nintedanib group (nintedanib: 25.3%, placebo: 17.2%).

Table 33 Overview of treatment interruptions and dose reductions 
Exposure over 52 weeks in the overall population by subgroups was carried out by gender, age group, 
and by race. Further subgroup evaluations for exposure over 52 weeks (by baseline FVC % predicted, 
underlying clinical ILD diagnosis (grouped), baseline body weight, and the use of the following drugs at 
baseline:  DMARDs  with  known  hepatotoxic  effects,  DMARDs  with  known  gastrointestinal  effects,  and 
methotrexate) was carried out and exposure was generally comparable across subgroups. 
Patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern 
Of the 412 patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern, 206 patients received nintedanib and 206 
received placebo. In patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern over 52 weeks, exposure was in 
general similar in the two treatment groups, with the median (range) duration of treatment exposure 
being 12.2 (0.0, 12.2) months in the nintedanib group and 12.2 (0.3, 12.2) months in the placebo group. 
The mean (SD) exposure was 10.2 (3.9) months in the nintedanib group and 11.0 (3.0) months in the 
placebo group. The mean (SD) dose intensity was slightly lower in the nintedanib group (nintedanib: 
92.31% (11.92), placebo: 98.47% (5.70)) due to a higher proportion of patients with dose reductions 
and treatment interruptions 
Exposure duration over the whole trial up to DBL1:  
Over  the  whole  trial,  the  median  (range)  duration  of  exposure  was  16.6  (0.0,  26.5)  months  in  the 
nintedanib group and 16.7 (0.3, 25.8) months in the placebo group; the mean (SD) duration of exposure 
was 15.0 (6.8) months and 16.2 (5.5) months, respectively. The mean (SD) dose intensity was 91.58% 
(12.29) and 98.41% (5.62), respectively. 
Dose reduction/interruption/discontinuation:  
Patients in trial 1199.247 were to receive nintedanib 150 mg bid or placebo. Nintedanib dose reduction 
from 150 mg bid to 100 mg bid or treatment interruption was allowed to manage AEs.

As expected, in both treatment groups over 52 weeks, investigator-defined drug-related AEs were the 
main reason for dose reduction (nintedanib:87.3% of dose reductions, placebo: 70.0%) and treatment 
interruptions  (nintedanib:  71.3%  of 
treatment 
discontinuation was also more frequent in the nintedanib group (nintedanib: 25.3%, placebo: 17.2%).  
To note, in both treatment groups, first dose reductions and first treatment interruptions occurred more 
frequently during the first 6 months of treatment. In the nintedanib group, also premature treatment 
discontinuations were more frequent during the first 6 months of treatment. 
interruptions,  placebo:  48.8%).  Premature 
Adverse events  
With few exceptions, AE analyses were based on the number of patients with AEs and not on the 
number of individual events or occurrences of AEs. Adverse events were coded using MedDRA version 
22.0. 
As a supplement to the standard analyses of AEs, particular attention was paid to certain predefined 
AEs: 
•  Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were AEs related to gastrointestinal perforation and 
hepatic injury.  
•  Adverse event groupings by relevant medical concept: Adverse events and SAEs in 
gastrointestinal and metabolic, hepatobiliary and liver laboratory, cardiovascular, bleeding and 
haematological, renal, psychiatric, cutaneous, and respiratory safety topics. For certain AEs 
(diarrhoea, bleeding, and worsening/exacerbation of ILD), additional information was collected 
via specific CRF pages and analysed.  
•  An independent adjudication committee reviewed all AEs categorised as ““major adverse 
cardiovascular events”“ (MACE); it also reviewed all fatal cases in trial 1199.247 regarding the 
primary cause of death and adjudicated them as either ““cardiovascular death”“, ““respiratory 
death”“, ““non-cardiovascular/non-respiratory death”“, or ““death due to undetermined 
causes”“.  
In the overall population, most patients in both treatment groups were reported with at least 1 AE over 
52 weeks (Table below). The proportions of patients with investigator-defined drug related AEs and of 
patients with AEs leading to discontinuation of trial medication were about twice as high in the nintedanib 
group  as  in  the  placebo  group.  Comparable  proportions  of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  were 
reported with SAEs. AEs leading to death were reported for 3.3% of patients in the nintedanib group 
compared with 5.1% of patients in the placebo group.

Table 35 Overall summary of AEs over 52 weeks – TS  
Overall population 
Most frequently reported adverse events over 52 weeks 
In  the  overall  population,  the  most  frequently  reported  SOCs  in  both  treatment  groups  were 
“gastrointestinal  disorders”,  “infections  and  infestations”  and  “respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal 
disorders”. The proportions of patients with AEs were more than 5% higher in the nintedanib than in the 
placebo  group  for  the  SOCs  “gastrointestinal  disorders”,  “investigations”,  “metabolism  and  nutrition 
disorders”  and  “hepatobiliary  disorders”.  This  was  mostly  attributable  to  the  PTs  diarrhoea,  nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain (upper), ALT increased, AST increased, weight decreased, decreased appetite, 
and hepatic function abnormal, which were reported with a higher frequency in the nintedanib than in 
the placebo group. Headache, fatigue, and gamma-glutamyl transferase increased were also reported 
for slightly higher proportions of patients in the nintedanib groups than in the placebo groups. Interstitial 
lung disease, which represents in a population of patients with ILD a worsening of the underlying ILD, 
was reported for a lower proportion of patients in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group. Cough 
was  reported  with  a  slightly  lower  frequency  in  the  nintedanib  group  than  in  the  placebo  group.  The 
incidences  of  the  other  most  frequently  reported  AEs  were  generally  comparable  in  both  treatment 
groups. For details, see Table below.

Table 36 AEs reported for more than 5% of patients in either treatment group on the PT level over 52 
weeks – TS  
Overall population 
Of  the  AEs  reported  for  ≤5%  of  patients  in  either  treatment  group,  frequencies  were  more  than  2% 
higher in the nintedanib group compared with the placebo group for gastrooesophageal reflux disease 
(3.9%  vs.  1.8%),  acute  respiratory  failure  (3%  vs.  0.6%),  musculoskeletal pain  (3%  vs.  0.9%),  and 
alopecia (2.1% vs. 0%). The occurrence of gastrooesophageal reflux is postulated to be associated with 
the  commonly  reported  gastrointestinal  AEs  of  nausea  and  vomiting  (see  above).  For  AEs  related  to 
(acute)  respiratory  failure,  grouping  them  by  medical  concept leads to  similar  proportions of  patients 
with  these  AEs  in  both  treatment  groups  (further  explored  below  in  AEs/SAEs  by  medical  concept). 
Similarly, when taking all reported PTs that represent musculoskeletal pain into account (e.g. myalgia, 
back pain, arthralgia), the proportions of patients with these events were comparable. All alopecia AEs 
were non-serious and in all but 1 case of mild intensity; 5 of the 7 AEs were defined as not related to 
nintedanib by the investigator.

Investigator-defined drug-related adverse events over 52 weeks 
In  the  overall  population,  substantial  proportions  of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  were  reported 
with investigator-defined drug-related AEs. In the nintedanib group, the proportion was about twice as 
high  as  in  the  placebo  group.  Drug-related  AEs  were  most  commonly  reported  in  the  SOCs 
“gastrointestinal  disorders”,  “investigations”,  and  “metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders”.  The  most 
frequent PTs in the nintedanib group were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and alanine 
aminotransferase increased, which were all reported for higher proportions of patients in the nintedanib 
group  than  in  the  placebo  group.  All  other  PTs  were  reported  for  less  than  10%  of  patients  in  either 
treatment group (Table 
below).

treatment group on the PT level over 52 weeks – TS Overall population 
Adverse events over the whole trial (Part A+B) up to DBL1 
The overall AE profile over the whole trial up to DBL1 was generally in line with the overall AE profile 
over  52  weeks.  As  expected,  compared  with  the  52-week  period,  the  proportions  of  patients  in  the 
individual 
AE  categories  increased  in  both  treatment  groups  with  prolonged  exposure.  SAEs  were  reported  for 
41.6% of patients in the nintedanib group and for 46.5% of patients in the placebo group. The proportion 
of patients with AEs leading to death in the nintedanib group (4.5%) was around half of that observed 
in the placebo group (9.1%).

Table 38 AEs reported for more than 5% of patients in either treatment group on the PT level over the 
whole trial (Part A+B) up to DBL1 – TS Overall population 
For the analysis of AEs over the whole trial up to DBL1, exposure-adjusted rates/100 patient-years 
were added to the AE tables to account for potential differences in the exposure. The pattern of the most 
frequently  reported  AEs  over  the  whole  trial up to DBL1  was  generally  in line  with  the  pattern of  the 
most frequently reported AEs over the first 52 weeks.  
Like in the 52-week period, the most frequently reported AEs reported over the whole trial up to DBL1 
were  in  the  SOC  “gastrointestinal  disorders”,  with  diarrhoea,  nausea,  and  vomiting  being  the  most 
frequently reported PTs in the nintedanib group. Increased ALT and AST, decreased appetite, and weight 
decreased were also reported much more frequently in the nintedanib than in the placebo group.  
The pattern of the AEs reported for ≤5% of patients in either treatment group was also generally in line 
with  that  over  52  weeks.  Differences  of  >2%  in  AE  frequencies  between  the  treatment  groups  (with

higher proportions of patients in the nintedanib than in the placebo groups) occurred in addition for blood 
alkaline  phosphatase  increased  (nintedanib:  8  patients,  2.4%;  placebo:  1  patient,  0.3%)  and  for 
hypokalaemia  (nintedanib:  7  patients,  2.1%;  placebo:  0  patients)  whilst  the  difference  between 
treatment groups was ≤2% for musculoskeletal pain in contrast to the 52-week data.  
With regard to hypokalaemia, alternative explanations/confounders were identified for all patients (e.g. 
concomitant  diarrhoea,  concomitant  use  of  drugs  known  to  cause  hypokalaemia,  such  as  diuretics, 
laxatives, antibiotics etc.; all AEs were defined as not related to nintedanib by the investigator.  
The most frequently reported AEs by safety topic over 52 weeks 
Adverse event groupings by medical concept, relevant to the clinical development programme and the 
established knowledge about nintedanib have been defined. These reflect medical concepts and include 
relevant MedDRA PTs independent of their primary location within MedDRA.

Gastrointestinal and metabolic adverse events over 52 weeks 
In  line  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  nintedanib  in  IPF,  the  most  common  gastrointestinal  AEs 
diarrhoea,  nausea,  vomiting,  and  abdominal  pain  were  reported  more  frequently  for  patients  in  the 
nintedanib group than for patients in the placebo group (Table above). Almost all of these events were 
non-serious and of mild or moderate intensity.  
In addition, 2 patients in the nintedanib group were reported with a serious AEs of acute pancreatitis 
and pancreatitis, respectively; both patients recovered without dose reduction. One patient each in the 
nintedanib  group  and  in  the  placebo  group  were  reported  with  non-serious  AEs  of  anal  abscess, 
representing the only PT in the safety topic 'gastrointestinal perforation'. 
Higher  proportions  of  patients  in  the  nintedanib  group  than  in  the  placebo  group  were  reported  with 
decreased appetite and decreased weight (Table above). The proportion of patients who had lost more 
than 10% of their body weight at some point during the 52-week period was higher in the nintedanib 
group than in the placebo group.  
Over the whole trial (Part A+B) up to DBL1: The pattern of AEs and SAEs in the gastrointestinal and 
metabolic safety topics over the whole trial up to DBL1 was generally in line with results over 52 weeks. 
Due to the prolonged exposure, the proportions of patients with diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal 
pain, decreased appetite, and weight decreased were slightly higher than in the 52-week period in both 
treatment groups (see Table above AEs reported for more than 5% of patients in either treatment group 
on  the  PT  level  over  the  whole  trial  (Part  A+B)  up  to  DBL1).  No  additional  AEs  of  pancreatitis  or 
gastrointestinal perforation were reported.  
Diarrhoea 
Based on the analysis of additional information collected on diarrhoea AEs via a specific CRF page, the 
intensity of diarrhoea was CTCAE grade 1 (nintedanib: 66.5%, placebo: 81.0%) or grade 2 (23.1% vs. 
12.7%) for the large majority of patients in both treatment groups. CTCAE grade 3 (nintedanib: 10.4%, 
placebo: 6.3%). For most patients, trial medication was neither discontinued nor the dose permanently 
reduced,  permanent  dose  reduction  (nintedanib:  21.3%,  placebo:  3.8%)  and  permanent  dose 
discontinuation  (nintedanib:  8.6%,  placebo:  1.3%).  In  the  nintedanib  group,  68.3%  of  patients 
recovered from diarrhoea; for the majority of patients (88.2%) diarrhoea was defined as drug-related 
by the investigator. Most patients with diarrhoea in the nintedanib group had their first episode in the 
first month of treatment.

Overall population 
AESI gastrointestinal perforation 
Gastrointestinal perforation was a protocol-specified AESI in trial 1199.247. None of the patients was 
reported with gastrointestinal perforation as AESI. 
Vomiting 
To note, vomiting is reported with greater frequency for the PF-ILD group than the ILD group. On the 
PT level, in the nintedanib group nausea and vomiting were more frequently reported in females (nausea: 
nintedanib:  37.9%,  placebo:  11.7%;  vomiting:  nintedanib:  28.1%,  placebo:  5.8%)  than  in  males 
(nausea: nintedanib: 21.2%, placebo: 7.3%; vomiting: nintedanib: 10.1%, placebo: 4.5%). 
Hepatobiliary and liver laboratory adverse events over 52 weeks 
All  hepatobiliary  AEs  have  been  collected  by  a  comprehensive  search  defined  as  safety  topic  'hepatic 
disorders  combined',  see SCS  Table  35  for  the  full  PT  list.  In  addition,  the  safety  topics  'liver-related 
investigations, signs and symptoms' and 'hepatic failure' have been defined to screen separately for AEs 
related to liver enzyme and bilirubin elevations only or for AEs suggestive of liver failure. Of note there 
is  overlap,  the  reported  PTs  contained  in  these  2  subcategories  are  all  contained  in  the  safety  topic 
'hepatic disorders combined'. 
AEs and SAEs in the safety topic 'hepatic disorders combined' were reported for higher proportions of 
patients in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group. With regard to the AEs in this safety topic, 
PTs related to increased values of ALT and AST, which are components of the safety topic 'liver related 
investigations, signs, and symptoms', contributed for the most part to this difference (see Table below). 
Assessment report

Table 41 AEs and SAEs by hepatobiliary and liver laboratory safety topic over 52 weeks – TS  
Overall population 
Of the AEs grouped to the safety topic 'liver related investigations, signs, and symptoms ', 4 patients 
(1.2%) in the nintedanib group and 2 patients (0.6%) in the placebo group were reported with SAEs. 
For all 6 patients, the SAEs were related to increased hepatic enzymes/transaminases, and all 6 patients 
recovered after withdrawal of the study drug.  
For most patients with possibly clinically significant increases in transaminases, the elevations of ALT 
and/or AST were between ≥3×ULN and <5×ULN. 
AEs and SAEs reported in the safety topic “hepatic failure”, which were reported with higher frequencies 
in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group, contributed noticeably to the AEs and SAEs reported 
in the safety topic “hepatic disorders combined”. The SAEs in this safety topic were drug-induced liver 
injury, reported for 6 patients (1.8%) in the nintedanib group, liver injury, reported for 3 patients (0.9%) 
in the nintedanib group and for 2 patients (0.6%) in the placebo group, and hepatic cirrhosis, reported 
Assessment report  
EMA/315975/2020

for 1 patient (0.3%) in the nintedanib group. All patients, except for the patient with hepatic cirrhosis, 
recovered  from  these  SAEs,  in  most  cases  after  drug  withdrawal  or  dose  reduction.  The  patient  with 
hepatic  cirrhosis,  who  had  a  chronic  hepatitis  B  infection  at  baseline,  was  also  reported  with  hepatic 
cancer as SAE, from which the patient recovered. Importantly, none of the hepatic AEs in the nintedanib 
group were fatal, and none of the patients were reported with clinical liver failure in terms of hepatic 
decompensation in either treatment group. 
Subgroup analysis 
In line with the known safety profile of nintedanib, subgroup analysis of hepatic AEs by gender, race, 
and body weight showed that female patients, Asian patients, and patients with low body weight (≤65 
kg)  have  a  higher  risk  for  liver  enzyme  elevations  with  nintedanib  treatment.  Consequently,  the 
frequencies of AEs in the safety topic 'hepatic disorders combined' in the nintedanib group were higher 
in females (nintedanib: 33.3%, placebo: 8.4%) than in males (nintedanib: 22.3%, placebo: 6.8%). The 
same  trend  was  seen  for Asian  vs.  White  patients  (nintedanib:  58.3%  vs.  17.4%;  placebo:  8.8%  vs. 
6.5%)  and  for  patients  with  lower  (≤65  kg)  vs.  higher  (>65  kg)  body  weight  (nintedanib:  47.3%  vs. 
19.9%; placebo: 7.9% vs. 7.4%). These observed differences were also reflected by the results of the 
analyses of patients with elevated transaminases (ALT and/or AST ≥3×ULN) as clinical laboratory value 
by subgroup. 
For  the  use  of  DMARD  with  known  hepatotoxic  effects  or  methotrexate  at  baseline,  no  trend  to  an 
increased  proportion  of  patients  in  the  nintedanib  group  with  AEs  related  to  hepatobiliary  and  liver 
laboratory safety topics was seen for patients who used these medications vs. patients who did not use 
them. For the subgroup of underlying ILD diagnosis (grouped), there were no relevant differences either. 
Although AEs in the safety topic 'hepatic disorders combined' were reported in the nintedanib group with 
the highest frequency and with the largest difference to placebo in patients with uIIP (nintedanib: 35.9%, 
placebo: 4.0%) compared with patients in the other underlying ILD groups, this analysis was confounded 
by the overrepresentation of Asians and patients with low body weight (≤65 kg) in the uIIP group and 
generally limited by the low numbers of patients for individual PTs per subgroup category. For the safety 
topic 'hepatic enzyme increased', similar results across the above-mentioned subgroups were observed. 
Over the whole trial (Part A+B) up to DBL1: The pattern of AEs and SAEs in the hepatobiliary and liver 
laboratory safety topics over the whole trial up to DBL1 was generally in line with the results over 52 
weeks.  Compared  with  the  52-week  treatment  period,  2  additional  patients  (one  in  each  treatment 
group) were reported with SAEs in the safety topic 'hepatic disorders combined' (nintedanib: 1 patient 
with hepatocellular carcinoma, placebo: 1 patient with hepatic cirrhosis). Compared with the 52-week 
period, no additional patients were reported with drug-induced liver injury or AEs related to increased 
bilirubin values. 
Cardiovascular adverse events over 52 weeks 
The most frequently reported cardiovascular AEs belonged to the safety topic 'hypertension’, a known 
adverse reaction of nintedanib, with similar frequencies in both treatment groups (AEs nintedanib: 4.5%, 
placebo: 5.1%; SAEs nintedanib 0.3% n=1, placebo 0.0%), further discussed in vital signs.  
AEs  grouped  to  the  various  other  cardiovascular  safety  topics,  including  'MACE',  were  reported  less 
frequently  than  hypertension  and  for  similar  proportions  of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  (Table 
below). The majority of AEs in the safety topic “MACE” were non-fatal (see below). The proportions of 
patients with SAEs in the cardiovascular safety topics were low and also similar in both treatment groups.

Overall population 
Adjudicated non-fatal major cardiovascular events (MACE) 
For the majority of patients who experienced an AE grouped to the safety topic 'MACE', the AE was non-
fatal  (nintedanib:  3.3%,  placebo:  2.4%),  and  only  very  few  of  these  AEs  were  adjudicated  as  actual 
MACE  (nintedanib:  4  patients,  1.2%;  placebo:  3  patients,  0.9%).  AEs  in  the  safety  topic  'myocardial 
infarction'  were  reported  for  3  patients  (0.9%)  each  in  the  nintedanib  and  the  placebo  groups;  all 
myocardial infarction events were serious and all patients recovered. 
Adjudicated cardiovascular cause of death 
There were 3 patients (0.9%) each in the nintedanib group and in the placebo group with an adjudicated 
cardiovascular cause of death. The reported PTs adjudicated as cardiovascular cause of death comprised 
PTs grouped to the safety topic 'MACE', but also the PT acute respiratory. The reported PTs adjudicated 
as 
cardiovascular cause of death comprised PTs grouped to the safety topic 'MACE' for 4 patients in total 
(nintedanib: 1 patient with arteriosclerosis coronary artery; placebo: 3 patients [1 patient with aortic 
aneurysm  rupture  and  shock  haemorrhagic,  1  patient  with  sudden  cardiac  death,  and  1  patient  with 
sudden  death]).  In  addition,  2  patients  in  the  nintedanib  group  were  reported  with  acute  respiratory 
failure leading to death; these AEs were also adjudicated as cardiovascular cause of death. None of these 
deaths were reported as related by the investigator. One death was reported as related for the nintedanib 
group  over  the  whole  trial  (Part  A+B)  up  to  DBL1,  occurring  in  the  active  treatment  period,  and  the 
adjudicated  cause  of  death  was  pulmonary.  Discussed  further  under  below  section  “Serious  adverse 
event/deaths/other significant events”. 
Over the whole trial (Part A+B) up to DBL1: The pattern of AEs and SAEs in the cardiovascular safety 
topics over the whole trial up to DBL1 was generally in line with the results over 52 weeks. Due to the 
prolonged exposure, slightly higher proportions of patients in both treatment groups were reported with 
AEs and SAEs compared with the 52-week period; no imbalances between the treatment groups were 
observed. AEs in the safety topic 'MACE' were reported for 4.8% of patients in the nintedanib group and 
for  5.1%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group,  with  the  majority  of  these  AEs  being  non-fatal  (4.5%  vs. 
3.6%) and only very few being adjudicated as actual non-fatal MACE (1.8% vs. 0.9%).  
Blood adverse events over 52 weeks 
The proportions of patients with AEs in the safety topic 'bleeding' were similar between the nintedanib 
group and the placebo group, and most bleeding AEs were non-serious. The most frequently reported

bleeding AEs involved the respiratory system (nintedanib: 4.2%, placebo: 5.1%), with epistaxis being 
the most frequently reported PT (3.6% vs. 3.0%). 
Serious  bleeding  AEs  were  reported  for  3  patients  (0.9%)  in  the  nintedanib  group  and  for  5  patients 
(1.5%) in the placebo group. All 3 patients with bleeding SAEs in the nintedanib group were reported 
with  gastrointestinal haemorrhage  and  1 of  these  patients  additionally  with  blood  loss  anaemia;  all 3 
patients  recovered  from  their  bleeding  SAEs.  CNS  bleeding  was  reported  for  1  patient  in  the  placebo 
group.  
Over  the  whole  trial  (Part  A+B)  up  to  DBL1:  The  pattern  of  AEs  and  SAEs  in  the  bleeding  and 
haematological safety topics over the whole trial up to DBL1 was generally in line with the results over 
52  weeks.  Compared  with  the  52-week  period,  2  additional  patients  in  each  treatment  group  were 
reported  with  serious  bleeding  AEs;  the  SAEs  in  the  nintedanib  group  were  haematemesis  and 
haematuria, and both patients recovered. 
Respiratory adverse events over 52 weeks 
AEs in the safety topic 'upper and NOS respiratory tract infection' were reported for 30.1% of patients 
in  the nintedanib  group  compared  with  26.3%  of  patients  in  the  placebo group,  with nasopharyngitis 
(nintedanib: 13.3%, placebo: 12.1%) and upper respiratory tract infection (7.2% vs. 5.7%) being the 
most  frequently  reported  PTs.  Low  numbers  of  patients  were  reported  with  SAEs;  upper  and  NOS 
respiratory tract infection (nintedanib: 0.6%, placebo: 0.9%).  
Table 43 AEs and SAEs by respiratory safety topic over 52 weeks – TS Overall population 
Comparable  proportions  in  both  treatment  groups  were  reported  with  AEs  in  the  safety  topic  'lower 
respiratory tract infection'. The most frequently reported PTs were bronchitis (12.3% vs. 14.2%) and 
pneumonia (5.7% vs. 6.0%). Pneumonia was the most frequently reported SAE, with similar frequencies 
in both treatment groups (3.6% vs. 3.3%).  
AEs in the safety topic 'respiratory failure and ILD progression' were reported for 12.3% of patients in 
the  nintedanib  group  compared  with  19.0%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group.  The  most  frequently 
reported PT in both treatment groups was interstitial lung disease (4.8% vs. 11.8%). 
AEs in the safety topic 'respiratory failure', which is a subset of the above safety topic excluding the PTs 
related to ILD progression, were reported for similar proportions of patients in both treatment groups 
(nintedanib: 6.3%, placebo: 6.6%). The most frequently reported PT in the nintedanib group was acute 
respiratory failure (nintedanib: 10 patients, 3.0%; placebo: 2 patients, 0.6%) and the most frequently 
PT  in  the  placebo  group  was  respiratory  failure  (nintedanib:  6  patients,  1.8%;  placebo:  9  patients, 
2.7%). All AEs with these 2 PTs were reported as SAEs.

Over the whole trial (Part A+B) up to DBL1: The pattern of AEs and SAEs in the respiratory safety topics 
was generally in line with the results over 52 weeks. Due to the prolonged exposure, the proportions of 
patients  increased  for  all  safety  topics  in  both  treatment  groups  ('upper  and  NOS  respiratory  tract 
infection':  nintedanib:  34.0%,  placebo:  31.1%;  'lower  respiratory  tract  infection':  25.0%  vs.  31.4%; 
'respiratory failure and ILD progression': 16.6% vs. 24.8%; and 'respiratory failure': 7.8% vs. 7.9%). 
SAEs in the respiratory infection-related safety topics occurred with similar frequencies in both treatment 
groups ('upper and NOS respiratory tract infection': 1.2% vs. 1.2%; 'lower respiratory tract infection': 
9.0%  vs.  9.4%).  SAEs  in  the  safety  topic  'respiratory  failure  and  ILD  progression'  were  reported  for 
14.2% of patients in the nintedanib group compared with 20.2% of patients in the placebo group, and 
SAEs in the safety topic 'respiratory failure' were reported for 7.2% vs. 5.7% of patients.  
Renal adverse events over 52 weeks 
AEs in the safety topic 'renal failure' were reported for 2 patients (0.6%) each in the nintedanib and in 
the placebo groups (Table below). Both AEs in the nintedanib group were serious AEs of acute kidney 
injury,  both  patients  recovered,  and  both  SAEs  were  defined  by  the  investigator  as  not  related  to 
nintedanib. 
The  proportions  of  patients  with  AEs  in  the  safety  topic  'proteinuria'  were  similar  in  both  treatment 
groups. A serious AE of glomerulonephritis was reported for 1 patient in the nintedanib group, which was 
defined as not related to nintedanib by the investigator.

Psychiatric adverse events over 52 weeks 
In the overall population, AEs in the safety topic 'depression' were reported for similar proportions of 
patients in both treatment groups (nintedanib: 6 patients, 1.8%; placebo: 5 patients, 1.5%); all AEs 
were non-serious. 'Suicide' was not reported. 
Cutaneous adverse events over 52 weeks 
In the overall population, comparable proportions of patients in both treatment groups were reported 
with  AEs  in  the  safety  topics  'rash'  (nintedanib:  14  patients,  4.2%;  placebo: 11  patients,  3.3%)  and 
'pruritus' (nintedanib: 8 patients, 2.4%; placebo: 16 patients, 4.8%); all AEs were non-serious. 'Severe 
skin reactions' were not reported. 
Drug-related adverse events over 52 weeks 
As a basis, ADRs specified in labelling documents of nintedanib (Ofev) in IPF are proposed to be listed 
as ADRs of nintedanib in the treatment of chronic fibrosing ILDs with progressive phenotype. To identify 
new ADRs for nintedanib in patients with progressive fibrosing ILD, the safety results for the nintedanib 
and placebo groups of trial 1199.247 were compared. A screening algorithm with numerical thresholds 
was applied to each PT using the following numerical criteria:

• 
• 
• 
If the AE frequency in the nintedanib group was ≥5% and the relative risk (rate ratio) versus 
the placebo group was ≥2-fold, the event was suggestive of a potential side effect (criterion 1) 
If the AE frequency in the nintedanib group was ≥2% and <5% and the relative risk (rate 
ratio) versus the placebo group was ≥2-fold (criterion 2) or 
if the AE frequency in the nintedanib group was ≥5% and the relative risk (rate ratio) versus 
the placebo group was >1-fold and <2-fold (criterion 3), other supportive data that support a 
causal association were needed to suggest a side effect. 
All non-listed terms identified by this screening algorithm, which are summarised in the Table below, 
were  subject  to  further  integrated  medical  evaluation  considering  all  sources  of  safety  data,  such  as 
individual case medical content, seriousness, investigator-reported relatedness, and if applicable clinical 
laboratory and vital sign data. 
Table 45 Non-listed Preferred Terms identified by the screening algorithm for potential ADRs in the 
overall population 
Based on the methods described above, alopecia and headache were identified as potential additional 
ADRs for nintedanib in chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype. An integrated assessment 
of  all  data  available  for  nintedanib  (including  post-marketing  data,  comprehensive  clinical  trial 
experience,  information  from  the  literature  and  from  other  compounds  sharing  the  same  signalling 
pathways)  was  the  basis  to  consider  alopecia  and  headache  as  identified  adverse  drug  reactions  for 
nintedanib. 
For the other PTs, a causal association between the screened AEs and nintedanib could not be established 
for one or more of the following reasons: 
• 
• 
The difference to placebo was too low (≤3 patients) to allow the drawing of conclusions 
The  screened  AEs  represent  individual  terms  (PTs);  when  looking  into  the  respective  medical 
concepts, the findings were balanced 
•  Some AEs were potential chain events occurring as a consequence of already listed ADRs 
• 
There  was  no  known  pharmacologic  or  physiologic  mechanism  to  associate  the  AEs  with 
nintedanib 
•  Alternative explanations for the AEs were found after individual case review 
•  Severe adverse events over 52 weeks 
•  Severe AEs over 52 weeks were reported for 18.1% of patients in the nintedanib group and for 
22.1% of patients in the placebo group. The most common severe AEs were acute respiratory 
failure,  pneumonia,  and  diarrhoea  in  the  nintedanib  group  and  interstitial  lung  disease, 
respiratory failure, and dyspnoea in the placebo group. All other severe AEs were reported for 
less than 2% of patients in either treatment group.

Patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern: Severe AEs over 52 weeks were reported for

most common severe AEs were diarrhoea, acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, and interstitial 
lung disease in the nintedanib group and interstitial lung disease, respiratory failure, dyspnoea, 
and pneumonia in the placebo group.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs over 52weeks 
The proportions of patients with SAEs were similar in both treatment groups (Table below). The most 
frequently reported SOC in both treatment groups was 'respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders'. 
In  this  SOC,  the  most  frequently  reported  AE  overall  on  PT  level  was  interstitial  lung  disease,  with  a 
lower incidence in the nintedanib than in the placebo group. Other frequently reported SAEs in this SOC 
were  related  to  acute  respiratory  failure  and  respiratory  failure,  with  comparable  proportions  in  both 
treatment groups when grouping them by medical concept (see belw). SAEs of drug-induced liver injury 
were reported for 6 patients in the nintedanib group; further details in SAEs grouped by medical concept.

Table 47 SAEs reported for more than 1% of patients in either treatment group on the PT level over 52 
weeks – TS 
Overall population 
The SAE profile over the whole trial up to DBL1 was generally in line with the SAE profile over 52 weeks. 
Like in the 52-week period, the most frequently reported SAEs were in the SOC 'respiratory, thoracic 
and mediastinal disorders' in both treatment groups. For information on SAEs over the whole trial up to 
DBL1 grouped by medical concept, see below. 
Deaths 
In the overall population over 52 weeks, 11 patients in the nintedanib group (3.3%) and 17 patients in 
the  placebo  group  (5.1%)  had  treatment-emergent  AEs  leading  to  death.  Over  the  whole  trial  up  to 
DBL1, the number of patients with treatment-emergent AEs leading to death increased to 15 patients in 
the nintedanib group (4.5%) and 30 patients in the placebo group (9.1%). AEs leading to death in the 
follow-up period that were not treatment emergent, i.e. with an onset after the residual effect period, 
were reported for 12 patients in the nintedanib group and 8 patients in the placebo. Patient narratives 
are found in the CSR for Trial 1199-0247 Section 15.4.3. 
To note, the assignment to the different analysis periods (52 weeks, whole trial up to DBL1) was based 
on the time of onset of the AE leading to death for the safety analysis, whereas it was based on the time 
of death for the analysis of time-to-event efficacy endpoints (various efficacy endpoints analysed death, 
death due to respiratory cause, or death as a component of different composite endpoints). 
For the AEs leading to death, the cause of death was adjudicated by an independent committee. Over 
52 weeks, based on adjudication, 6 patients (1.8%) in the nintedanib group and 13 patients (3.9%) in 
the  placebo  group  died  due  to  respiratory  causes;  3  patients  (0.9%)  in  the  nintedanib  group  and  3 
patients (0.9%) in the placebo group died due to cardiovascular causes; and 2 patients (0.6%) in the 
nintedanib  group  and  1  patient  (0.3%)  in  the  placebo  group  died  due  to  other  causes  (non-
cardiovascular/non-respiratory or undetermined death). 
During both periods, the most frequently reported AEs leading to death were acute respiratory failure, 
pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, and respiratory failure in the nintedanib group and interstitial lung 
disease,  respiratory  failure,  pneumonia,  and  respiratory  distress  in  the  placebo  group.  All  other  AEs 
leading  to  death  were  individual  occurrences,  see  tables  below.  No  deaths  were  reported  by  the 
investigator as drug related, with respect to nintedanib in patients with TEAEs leading to death over 52 
weeks or during follow-up. One death was reported in the nintedanib group as drug related in patients

Laboratory findings 
The observed AEs and the known safety profile of nintedanib were reflected by the reported laboratory 
changes. These were based on the data received from the central laboratory; data from local laboratories 
are included in the case narratives, if available, and were considered for single cases  
Liver enzymes 
Administration of nintedanib was associated with increases in liver enzymes. In the overall population 
over  52  weeks,  elevations  of  ALT  and/or  AST  ≥3  times  ULN  occurred  in  43  patients  (13.0%)  of  the

nintedanib  group  and  in  6  patients  (1.8%)  of  the  placebo  group.  Of  the  patients  with  transaminase 
elevations  ≥3×ULN  in  the  nintedanib  group,  more  than  half  experienced  the  first  onset  of  possibly 
clinically significant liver enzyme elevation within the first 30 days and more than 75% within the first 
90 days of treatment. There were only few patients whose elevations were also ≥5×ULN (nintedanib: 10 
patients, 3.0%; placebo: 1 patient, 0.3%) or ≥8×ULN (nintedanib: 2 patients, 0.6%; placebo: 1 patient, 
0.3%).  The  large  majority  of  liver  enzyme  elevations  normalised  after  treatment  interruption,  dose 
reduction, treatment discontinuation, or spontaneously with continued treatment.

1 Based on local laboratory data (not contained in the database), there was 1 patient in the nintedanib group who had an ALT 
elevation ≥3×ULN concurrent with an elevation in bilirubin of ≥2×ULN. This patient is described in the text above, but not 
listed in this table, which is based solely on data from the central lab. 
2 In addition, 3 nintedanib patients were reported to have an ALT and/or AST elevations ≥5×ULN and 4 nintedanib patients were 
reported to have an ALT and/or AST elevations ≥8×ULN based on data from local lab available to BI (see [c26471552, Section 
15.4.3] for the respective patient narratives, where available). More information on patients with hepatobiliary SAEs with 
concurrent elevated transaminases is given in Table 36. 
3 These patients met the criteria for possible hepatic injury as defined in [c26471552, Section 9.5.3.2.1]. All respective patient 
narratives are provided in [c26471552, Section 15.4.3].

One patient in each treatment group had liver enzyme elevations concurrent with an elevation in bilirubin 
that met Hy's law criteria. Neither of these patients had clinical liver failure, and for both patients’ hepatic 
enzyme  and  bilirubin  concentrations  fully  recovered  to  within  normal  ranges  upon  treatment 
discontinuation and treatment interruption, respectively.  
One  patient  in  the  nintedanib  group  was  identified  with  potential  Hy's  law  criteria  based  on  local 
laboratory data (not contained in database, but described in the respective case narrative). This patient 
was reported with ongoing diarrhoea starting 15 days after first trial drug intake, eventually leading to 
dose reduction. On Day 57, the patient again experienced diarrhoea and abdominal pain and had an ALT 
elevation ≥3×ULN concurrent with an elevation in bilirubin of ≥2×ULN. The event was considered serious 
because  of  its  medical  significance.  On  the  same  day,  amylase  was  slightly  above  the  respective 
reference range. An ultrasound of the liver showed increased echogenicity of the parenchyma. ALKP was 
not measured at the same time point, but was within the reference range 1 week later, while GGT was 
increased to ≥3×ULN. Therefore, cholestasis could not be fully excluded as the cause for the ALT and 
bilirubin elevation. Trial treatment was terminated on the day of the elevated local laboratory values. All 
hepatic enzymes and bilirubin values quickly recovered and had fully returned to within normal ranges 
28 days later. 
Elevations of ALT and/or AST ≥3×ULN and eosinophil/leukocyte ratio >5% in the same sample, which 
were used as a screening criterion for potential hepatic injury, occurred in 12 patients of the nintedanib 
group.  Elevations  of  liver  enzymes  and  eosinophil/leukocyte  ratio  were  reversible,  i.e.  all  values 
normalised, upon dose reduction, treatment interruption, treatment discontinuation, or spontaneously. 
Most  of  the  patients  (10/12)  had  an  underlying  disease  (SSc-ILD,  RA-ILD,  Sjögren's  syndrome,  or 
hypersensitivity  pneumonitis)  or  allergic  conditions  at  baseline  potentially  associated  with  increased 
eosinophil  levels,  and  some  patients  had  already  an  eosinophil/leukocyte  ratio  >5%  at  screening  or 
group. An eosinophil/leukocyte ratio >10% was reported for 16 patients (4.9%) in the nintedanib group 
compared with 6 patients (1.9%) in the placebo group, but only few of these nintedanib patients (3/16) 
also had a concurrent transaminase elevation ≥3×ULN. 
Subgroup analyses of liver enzyme elevations 
Liver enzyme elevations were investigated in various subgroups of the overall population. This comprised 
subgroup  for  gender,  race,  age,  body  weight,  underlying  ILD  diagnosis,  use  of  DMARD  with  known 
hepatotoxic effects at baseline, and use of methotrexate at baseline 
Comparing the frequency of patients with ALT and/or AST elevations ≥3×ULN in each subgroup showed 
that female patients, Asian patients, and patients with low body weight (≤65 kg) were at a higher risk of 
having increased liver enzymes under nintedanib treatment. No large difference was seen between the 
age groups <65 years and ≥65 years. It should be noted that due the low number of Black or African 
American patients, no valid conclusion can be drawn for patients of this race. 
With  regard  to  the  underlying  ILD  diagnosis,  there  were  some  numerical  differences  between  the  5 
subgroups:  the  frequencies  of  liver  enzyme  elevations  under  nintedanib  treatment  were  highest  in 
patients with uIIP (20.3%), followed by patients with autoimmune ILD (14.6%) and iNSIP (14.1%), and 
were lowest in patients with other ILDs (7.9%) and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (7.1%). It has to be 
taken into account that in the uIIP and autoimmune ILD groups, Asian patients and patients with low 
body weight (≤65 kg) were overrepresented, while female patients were underrepresented in the group 
with other ILDs and Asian patients were underrepresented in the group with hypersensitivity pneumonitis 
Due to the relatively small number of patients in each disease subgroup, the results should be interpreted 
with caution. 
DMARDs with known hepatotoxic effects or methotrexate were used at baseline only by low proportions 
of  patients  (<6%  overall).  Nevertheless,  no  trend  towards  an  increased  proportion  of  patients  with 
Assessment report

hepatic enzyme elevations was seen in the group of patients who used these concomitant medications 
at baseline. 
Liver enzymes and bilirubin in the whole trial (Part A + B) up to DBL1 
There were a few additional patients in the nintedanib group with ALT, AST, or GGT elevations, including 
4 patients with ALT and/or AST elevations ≥5×ULN and 1 patient with ALT and/or AST elevations ≥8×
ULN. Importantly, there were no additional patients in the trial with liver enzyme elevations concurrent 
with  an  elevation  in  bilirubin  that  met  Hy’s  law  criteria.  Also,  no  additional  patient  with  liver  enzyme 
elevations concurrent with eosinophil/leukocyte ratio >5% was reported  
The liver enzyme values of all 6 placebo patients and the large majority of the nintedanib patients (42/47 
patients) with PCSAs for transaminases (i.e. ALT and/or AST ≥3×ULN) returned to within the reference 
range  at  some  point  of  the  whole  trial  after  the  elevation.  This  normalisation  occurred  upon  dose 
reduction, treatment interruption, treatment discontinuation, or spontaneously with continued 
treatment.  Four  of  the  5  remaining  nintedanib  patients  showed  a  downward  trend  of  the  respective 
hepatic enzymes following treatment interruption or discontinuation, but had not normalised completely 
by the last available measurement (i.e. the values were still between 1xULN and 3xULN). This comprised 
3 patients who had follow-up measurements for only less than 15 days as well as one patient  who did 
not fully return to within the reference range despite treatment interruption and sufficient follow-up time. 
In  addition,  liver  enzyme  values  of  one  patient  remained  above  the  reference  ranges  with  no  trend 
towards  normalisation.  However,  treatment  of  this  patient  continued  unchanged  (i.e.  at  100  mg 
nintedanib) at the time of the critical hepatic enzyme elevations and for the remainder of the trial. 
Furthermore, there was one patient with ALT values ≥3×ULN at the last available measurement on Day 
703. This patient was first reported with a possibly clinically significant ALT and AST values on Day 648. 
Following discontinuation of nintedanib treatment, liver enzyme values rapidly declined within the next 
days. However, 2 more ALT peaks ≥3×ULN were observed in the off-treatment period on Day 668 and 
again on Day 703 (approximately 50 days after treatment discontinuation). 
Other Laboratory findings 
For differentials and haematology parameters (including eosinophils), there were only minor changes in 
the mean values from baseline to last value on treatment, which were not considered clinically relevant. 
The majority of patients were within the normal ranges at baseline and mainly remained within these 
ranges over 52 weeks. 
There were no clinically relevant changes in coagulation, cardiac marker (i.e. natriuretic peptide type B), 
electrolytes, and urinalysis parameters in either of the 2 treatment groups.  
Over 52 weeks, the analyses of vital signs showed a higher incidence of marked increases in systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure in the nintedanib group (12.3% and 21.4%, respectively) than in the placebo 
group (7.9% and 13.6%, respectively).

Table 51 Patients with marked changes in vital signs over 52 weeks – TS 
Overall population 
Patients in the nintedanib group on average lost more body weight than patients in the placebo group; 
the  mean  (SD)  minimum  relative  change  from  baseline  in  body  weight  (i.e.  maximum  loss  of  body 
weight) over 52 weeks was -5.34 (4.72) % in the nintedanib group and -3.39 (4.37) % in the placebo 
group. Likewise, the proportion of patients who lost more than 10% of body weight at some point during 
the first 52 weeks of treatment was higher in the nintedanib group (15.4%) than in the placebo group 
(8.5%).  
Results of the evaluation of clinical laboratory values, vital signs, and body weight over the whole trial 
up to DBL1 were generally in line with the results over the first 52 weeks. 
The analyses of vital signs and body weight over the whole trial up to DBL1 showed similar results as 
the analyses over 52 weeks in the overall population. 
Safety in special populations 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  for  nintedanib  was  comparable  across  most  of  the  pre-specified  safety 
subgroups evaluated. There were no relevant findings for the subgroups by FVC % predicted, underlying 
ILD diagnosis, use of DMARD with known hepatotoxic effects, use of DMARD with known GI effects, and 
use of methotrexate at baseline. Differences noted for nintedanib by gender, age, race, and body weight 
are summarised below. 
Gender 
In  the  nintedanib  group,  the  incidences  of  nausea  and  vomiting  were  higher  in  females  (nausea: 
nintedanib:  37.9%,  placebo:  11.7%;  vomiting:  nintedanib:  28.1%,  placebo:  5.8%)  than  in  males 
(nausea:  nintedanib:  21.2%,  placebo:  7.3%;  vomiting:  nintedanib:  10.1%;  placebo:  4.5%).  Both 
nausea and vomiting are common adverse drug reactions of nintedanib. These data indicate that females 
have more frequent upper gastrointestinal events.  
Of  note,  diarrhoea  AEs  were  balanced  across  gender  in  both  treatment  groups  (females:  nintedanib: 
68.0%,  placebo:  23.4%;  males:  nintedanib:  65.9%,  placebo:  24.3%).  In  addition,  AEs  related  to 
hepatobiliary and liver laboratory safety topics in the nintedanib group were reported more frequently in 
females than in males. 
Assessment report  
EMA/315975/2020

Age 
The proportions of patients with AEs leading to discontinuation in the nintedanib group were higher in 
older patients (≥65 years: nintedanib: 24.4%, placebo: 11.0%) than in younger patients (<65 years: 
nintedanib: 12.9%, placebo: 9.1%); in the nintedanib group, the PT diarrhoea contributed largely to this 
finding (≥65 years: 7.3%; <65 years: 3.6%).  
Body weight 
AEs  related  to  hepatobiliary  and  liver  laboratory  safety  topics  in  the  nintedanib  group  were  reported 
more frequently in patients ≤65 kg than in patients >65 kg. 
Race 
AEs  related  to  hepatobiliary  and  liver  laboratory  safety  topics  in  the  nintedanib  group  were  reported 
more frequently in Asian patients than in White patients.  
Underlying ILD diagnosis (grouped) 
For  the  subgroup  analyses  by  underlying  ILD  diagnosis,  the  grouping  into  5  categories  was  used,  to 
achieve an adequate sample size per subgroup; no separate analysis for the 9 original underlying clinical 
ILD diagnosis (as documented in the eCRF) was performed. 
The most relevant AE categories by underlying ILD diagnosis (grouped) are displayed in the Table below. 
Within all underlying ILD diagnosis categories, most patients were reported with AEs in both treatment 
groups,  and  the  proportions  of  patients  with  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  trial  medication  were 
substantially  higher  in  the  nintedanib  groups  than  in  the  placebo  groups.  Within  all  underlying  ILD 
diagnosis categories, the proportions of patients with SAEs were comparable across treatment groups 
(with numerical differences in the frequencies of SAEs between the categories), and the proportions of 
patients with AEs leading to death were low. 
Table 52 Overall summary of AEs in subgroups by underlying ILD diagnosis (grouped) over 52 weeks – 
TS 
Overall population 
Despite the grouping of the underlying ILD diagnosis into 5 categories, on the PT level, the number of 
patients with individual AEs were small in each subgroup category. No relevant differences between the 
subgroup categories by underlying ILD diagnosis (grouped) were observed.

Pregnancy and Lactation 
There is no information on the use of nintedanib in pregnant women. Pre-clinical studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity of nintedanib. After administration of nintedanib to rats, angiogenesis (which 
is  critical  to  foetal  development)  was  inhibited,  resulting  in  absorption  of  foetuses  and  increased 
incidence of malformations. These effects occurred at dose levels resulting in plasma drug concentrations 
similar to or lower than those reached in humans during treatment with nintedanib. 
As nintedanib may cause foetal harm also in humans, it must not be used during pregnancy. Women of 
childbearing potential not using a highly effective method of birth control were excluded from all studies 
with nintedanib. Women who were pregnant or breast-feeding were also excluded. None of the female 
patients  became  pregnant  during  the  nintedanib  studies.  Similarly,  women  of  childbearing  potential 
should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with marketed nintedanib and 
to  use  highly  effective  contraceptive  methods  during  and  at  least  3  months  after  the  last  dose  of 
nintedanib. Women using hormonal contraceptives must use an additional barrier contraceptive method. 
No postmarketing cases of pregnancy have been received since product launch. If the patient becomes 
pregnant while receiving treatment with marketed nintedanib, she should be apprised of the potential 
hazard to the foetus. Termination of the treatment with nintedanib should be considered. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As summarised in the product information of Ofev, cytochrome P (CYP) pathways, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) 
inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, erythromycin, cyclosporine) and inducers (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, 
phenytoin, St. John's Wort)  
Co-administration  of  nintedanib  with  bosentan,  a  drug  for  the  treatment  of  pulmonary  arterial 
hypertension,  did  not  alter  the  PK  of  nintedanib  and  has  been  assessed  as  part  of  application 
EMEA/H/C/003821/II/026. 
A trial investigating the effect of multiple doses of nintedanib on the PK of a single dose of a combination 
of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel in female patients with SSc-ILD (1199.340) is currently ongoing.

In the overall population, there were substantially more patients with AEs leading to a permanent dose 
reduction  in  the  nintedanib  group  than  in  the  placebo  group.  Such  AEs  in  the  nintedanib  group  were 
most commonly reported for the SOC 'gastrointestinal disorders' and were mostly events of diarrhoea, 
followed by the SOC 'investigations' with events of increased transaminases (alanine aminotransferase, 
aspartate aminotransferase).

Adverse events leading to premature treatment discontinuation over 52 weeks 
In  the  overall  population,  there  were  nearly  twice  as  many  patients  with  AEs  leading  to  premature 
treatment discontinuation in the nintedanib group as in the placebo group. Such AEs in the nintedanib 
group were most commonly reported for the SOC 'gastrointestinal disorders' and were most frequently 
events of diarrhoea. In the placebo group, AEs leading to discontinuation were most commonly reported 
for  the  SOC  'respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders'  and  were  most  frequently  events  of 
interstitial lung disease (Table below).

Post marketing experience 
Current Market experience in other indications  
Nintedanib, at a recommended dose of 150 mg twice daily (bid), is an approved treatment for IPF in 
more than 70 countries (Ofev®). Nintedanib was shown to reduce the annual rate of decline in FVC in 
patients with IPF, consistent with slowing disease progression. The safety profile of nintedanib has been 
investigated comprehensively in IPF. 
Cumulative patient exposure to Ofev, marketed for the IPF indication, until May 2019 was estimated to 
be >80 000 patient-years. The most common post-marketing AEs are gastrointestinal disorders, with 
diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting being the most frequent ones. Most of these events were of mild or 
moderate  intensity,  non-serious,  and  were  managed  by  symptomatic  treatment  and/or  temporary 
interruption and/or reduction of the nintedanib dose. 
The clinically most relevant unfavourable effects of Ofev, both in clinical trials and postmarketing, are 
diarrhoea,  liver  enzyme  and  bilirubin  elevations  (including  DILI),  bleeding,  and  myocardial  infarction 
(further information is available in the most recent PBRER of Ofev: 
•  Diarrhoea, the most frequently reported side effect of Ofev from post-marketing sources, was 
reported with a rate of 357.4 per 1000 patient-years; the majority of cases were nonserious. 
• 
Liver enzyme and bilirubin elevations, including DILI, were reported in the postmarketing setting 
with a rate of 64.5 per 1000 patient-years. The majority of hepatic events occurred within the 
first 3 months of treatment. Although individual cases were fatal (0.4%), the vast majority of 
increased liver enzyme and bilirubin cases were reversible upon dose reduction or interruption. 
•  Bleeding (non-serious and serious events, some of which were fatal) was reported in the post-
marketing setting with a rate of 43.5 per 1000 patient-years. Non-serious epistaxis was the most 
frequent bleeding event. 
Assessment report  
EMA/315975/2020  
Page 97/116 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
For myocardial infarction, mostly serious cases were reported in the post-marketing setting 
(reporting rate 5.6 per 1000 patient-years). In many of these cases, the presence of risk 
factors for coronary artery disease was reported. 
Ten cases of off-label use with ILD as an indication of Ofev were reported. Adverse events observed for 
all cases of off-label use were in line with those observed in the IPF population treated with Ofev. 
As a basis, identified adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the product information of nintedanib (Ofev) in 
IPF are proposed to be listed as ADRs of nintedanib in the treatment of chronic fibrosing ILDs with a 
progressive  phenotype.  To  identify  potential  new  ADRs  for  nintedanib  in  patients  with  progressive 
fibrosing ILDs, nintedanib and placebo were compared using safety data of trial 1199.247. Based on this 
analysis and the accompanying medical assessment, headache and alopecia (reported in trial 1199.247 
at a low frequency: nintedanib: 2.1%, placebo: 0%) were identified as new ADRs. 
Based  on  data  from  clinical  trials  and  post-marketing  sources  and  supported  by  population 
pharmacokinetic models, female patients, patients with low body weight (<65 kg), and Asian patients 
have a higher risk of liver enzyme elevations with nintedanib treatment. Risks of nintedanib treatment 
also include hypertension, bleeding, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal perforation, thromboembolism, 
decreased appetite, decreased weight, rash, and pruritus. 
Nintedanib has also been investigated in a broad range of patients with Systemic Sclerosis associated 
ILD (SSc-ILD) in the SENSCIS® trial. In patients with Systemic Sclerosis, progressive fibrosis is one of 
the most frequent organ complications and a major driver for morbidity and mortality in this disease.  
The indication of SSc-ILD was recently approved by CHMP in February 2020. Nintedanib has further been 
studied in several cancer indications and is approved at a recommended dose of 200 mg bid, in some 
countries in combination with docetaxel as treatment of adult patients with locally advanced, metastatic 
or  locally  recurrent  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  of  adenocarcinoma  tumour  histology  after  first-line 
chemotherapy (Vargatef®). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  main  analysis  of  trial  1199.247  (INBUILD)  was  performed  after  the  last  randomised  patient  had 
completed the 52-week Visit (Part A). All safety analyses in trial 1199.247 were based on the treated 
set (TS), i.e. all patients who received at least one dose of trial medication. The main safety assessment 
used data collected up to Week 52. Supportive safety analyses used data collected over the whole trial 
(Part A+B) up to DBL1 snapshot. These are further referred to as 'over the whole trial (Part A+B) up to 
DBL1'. 
Trial  1199.247  evaluated  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  nintedanib  in  patients  who  independent  from  the 
underlying cause of their ILDs exhibited a progressive fibrosing phenotype (patients with PF-ILD). While 
clinical  diagnosis  of  a  chronic  fibrosing  ILD  was  a  requirement  for  inclusion  into  trial  1199.247,  the 
selection of patients was based on clinical signs of progressive disease. Specifically, to be eligible for the 
trial, patients were to be diagnosed with a fibrosing ILD and to present with relevant lung fibrosis defined 
as features of diffuse fibrosing lung disease of >10% extent on HRCT. 
The population has been grouped by unconventional classification, disease behaviour or phenotype has 
been  used  to  define  the  population  exposed.  The  consequence  of  this  method  has  resulted  in  a 
heterogeneous population with potentially different safety profiles. Patients with significant pulmonary 
hypertension  (cardiac  index  ≤ 2 L/min/m²,  or  parenteral  epoprostenol/treprostinil,  or  significant  right 
heart failure) were excluded from the trials. Ofev should not be used in patients with severe pulmonary 
hypertension.  Close  monitoring  is  recommended  in  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  pulmonary 
hypertension.

Exposure 
Pivotal trial exposure duration is adequate, data includes time period over 52 weeks and supportive data 
“over the whole trial up to DBL1”. Median (range) duration of exposure was 12.2 (0.0, 12.2) months in 
the nintedanib group and 12.2 (0.3, 12.2) months in the placebo group; the mean (SD) exposure was 
10.3 (3.8) months in the nintedanib group and 11.2 (2.6) months in the placebo group. The mean (SD) 
dose intensity was slightly lower in the nintedanib group (nintedanib: 92.54% (11.87), placebo: 98.59% 
(5.43)), which was due to a higher number of patients with dose reductions or treatment interruptions 
in the nintedanib group. Duration of exposure >12 months in the placebo group 84% (n=278) and the 
nintedanib group 74.7% (n=248). The duration of exposure in patient-years for the placebo group was 
310.57 and nintedanib group 285.79 patient years.  
In the overall population, there were more patients with AEs leading to a permanent dose reduction in 
the nintedanib group (33.1%) than in the placebo group (4.2%). Such AEs in the nintedanib group were 
most commonly reported for the SOC “gastrointestinal disorders” (20.2%) and were mostly events of 
diarrhoea (16.0%), followed by the SOC 'investigations' (9.6%), with AEs of ALT increased (5.4%) and 
AST increased (4.8%) reported most frequently. 
In  the  overall  population,  there  were  nearly  twice  as  many  patients  with  AEs  leading  to  premature 
treatment discontinuation in the nintedanib group (19.6%) as in the placebo group (10.3%). Such AEs 
in the nintedanib group were most commonly reported for the SOC 'gastrointestinal disorders' (6.9%) 
and were mostly events of diarrhoea (5.7%). 
Adverse events 
In  general,  the  AEs  reported  for  more  than  5%  of  patients  in  the  nintedanib group  over  52  weeks  is 
consistent with the known ADRs of the authorised product. Of the AEs reported for ≤5% of patients in 
either treatment group, frequencies were more than 2% higher in the nintedanib group compared with 
the placebo group for acute respiratory failure (3% vs. 0.6%).  
In general, investigator-defined drug-related AEs reported for more than 1.5% of patients over 52 weeks 
in  the nintedanib  group  over  52  weeks  is  consistent  with  the  known  ADRs  of  the  authorised product, 
with  the  exception  of  epistaxis  with  a  frequency  of  0.9%  in  the  placebo  group  versus  1.8%  in  the 
nintedanib group.  
The overall AE profile over the whole trial up to DBL1 was generally in line with the overall AE profile 
over 52 weeks. 
Of  note,  ILD  as  an  AE  was  reported  with  less  frequency  in  the  nintedanib  group  compared  with  the 
placebo (4.8% vs. 11.8%) along with the symptomatic AEs of cough (9.9% vs 13.3%) and dyspnoea 
(10.8% vs 13.3%).  
•  Gastrointestinal and metabolic disorders 
Gastrointestinal disorders is a SOC with known high frequency of diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, 
and vomiting, other ADRs are reported but with less frequency.  
The severity of diarrhoea is relevant, the intensity of diarrhoea reported was CTCAE grade 1 (nintedanib: 
66.5%,  placebo:  81.0%)  or  grade  2  (23.1%  vs.  12.7%)  for  the  large  majority  of  patients  in  both 
treatment  groups  and  CTCAE  grade  3  (nintedanib:  10.4%,  placebo:  6.3%).  For  most  patients,  trial 
medication  was  neither  discontinued  nor  the  dose  permanently  reduced,  permanent  dose  reduction 
(nintedanib: 21.3%, placebo: 3.8%) and permanent dose discontinuation (nintedanib: 8.6%, placebo: 
1.3%). Most patients with diarrhoea in the nintedanib group had their first episode in the first month of 
treatment.  
The CHMP agreed with  risk mitigations measures such as dose reduction and warnings regarding serious 
cases of diarrhoea leading to dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. Consequently section 4.2 and 
4.4 of the SmPC have been amended. It is recommended that patients should be treated at first signs 
with  adequate  hydration  and  anti-diarrhoeal  medicinal  products  and  may  require  dose  reduction  or

treatment interruption.  
Hepatobiliary disorders 
The frequency of patients with ALT and/or AST elevations ≥3×ULN in trial 1199.247 was higher in both 
the  nintedanib  groups  (13.0%)  compared  to  the  placebo  group  (1.8%).  For    INPULSIS  and  SENSCIS 
trials the figures were (5.0% vs. 0.7%) and (4.9% vs. 0.7%) respectively. No clinical variables, e.g. any 
specific underlying ILD diagnosis or background medication, were identified that could explain the higher 
proportion of patients with liver enzyme elevations and hepatic AEs in trial 1199.247 compared with the 
INPULSIS and SENSCIS trials. 
AEs  'hepatic  failure'  were  reported  for  5.1%  of  patients  in  the  nintedanib  group  (including  6  patients 
reported with the PT drug-induced liver injury) and for 1.2% of patients in the placebo group (none of 
the  patients  were  reported  with  clinical  liver  failure  in  terms  of  hepatic  decompensation  in  either 
treatment group). Hepatic failure (SMQ) was reported in the INPULSIS trials for 1.6% of patients in the 
nintedanib  group  and  for 0.2%  in  the  placebo  group  and in the  SENSCIS  trials  for  3.8%  vs.  1.0% of 
patients. 
The difference in the event rates between studies might at least partly be explained by the analysis of 
data from different central laboratories. Reference ranges of the laboratory used in the present PF-ILD 
study  differed  significantly  from  those  of  the  laboratories  used  in  the  IPF  and  SSc-ILD  studies.  In 
addition,  age-  and  gender-specific  reference  ranges  were  used  in  the  PF-ILD  study,  while  only  age-
specific reference ranges were given in the IPF and SSc-ILD trials. Drug induced liver injury and increased 
ALT and ALKP are ADRs that are both reported with greater frequency compared with the IPF and SSc-
ILD populations, other PTs under Hepatobiliary Disorders SOC are equivalent for all populations.  
All patients with SAEs, except for the patient with hepatic cirrhosis, recovered in most cases after drug 
withdrawal or dose reduction. None of the hepatic AEs in the nintedanib group were fatal, and none of 
the  patients  were  reported  with  clinical  liver  failure  in  terms  of  hepatic  decompensation  in  either 
treatment group. Sub-group analysis was consistent with the whole population with differences in uIIP 
adequately accounted for. 
recommendations 
Hepatic  failure  is  an  important  potential  risk  of  nintedanib  described  in  the  RMP.  Liver  enzyme  and 
bilirubin elevations including DILI are important identified risk described in the RMP. The SmPC include 
already  adequate 
liver  enzyme  elevations  and 
hyperbilirubinaemia  .  similarly  for  management  of  possible  elevations  through  dose  reductions, 
treatment interruptions, or permanent drug discontinuation.  
Furthermore,  as  part  of  the  routine  PV  activities  dedicated  follow-up  questionnaires  (OFEV  Hepatic 
Adverse  Event  Form)  are  being  sent  out  for  case  reports  of  ‘Liver  enzyme  and  bilirubin  elevations 
including DILI’. This activity will remain to be performed for nintedanib independent of the underlying 
respiratory indication. For respiratory indications, analysis by underlying ILD diagnosis will be performed 
for safety data related to liver enzyme elevations in the post-marketing setting . 
the  monitoring  of 
for 
Respiratory disorders 
Class  effect  for  Vascular  Endothelial  Growth  Factor  (VEGF)  inhibitors  for  systemic  administration  may 
suggest a likelihood of epistaxis as an ADR. Respiratory failure is reported for other VEGF inhibitors. The 
AEs and SAEs ‘epistaxis’ and 'respiratory failure' were balanced between placebo and nintedanib groups. 
No  updates  to  the  safety  profile  regarding  SOC  Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  are 
proposed during this procedure which is acceptable.  
The most frequently reported SOC was 'respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders', with interstitial 
lung disease being the most frequently reported PT overall (nintedanib: 3.3%, placebo: 9.4%). Other 
frequently  reported  PTs  in  this  SOC  were  related  to  acute  respiratory  failure  and  were  reported  with 
increased frequency when grouping them by medical concept  'respiratory failure': (nintedanib: 5.7%, 
placebo: 4.5%).

Regarding SAEs, the most frequently reported SOC in both treatment groups was 'respiratory, thoracic 
and  mediastinal  disorders'.  In  this  SOC,  the  most  frequently  reported  AE  overall  on  PT  level  was 
interstitial  lung  disease,  with  a  lower  incidence  in  the  nintedanib  than  in  the  placebo  group.  Other 
frequently reported SAEs in this SOC were related to acute respiratory failure and respiratory failure. 
SAEs of drug-induced liver injury were reported for 6 patients in the nintedanib group. 
Deaths 
In the overall population over 52 weeks, 11 patients in the nintedanib group (3.3%) and 17 patients in 
the  placebo  group  (5.1%)  had  treatment-emergent  AEs  leading  to  death.  Over  the  whole  trial  up  to 
DBL1, the number of patients with treatment-emergent AEs leading to death increased to 15 patients in 
the nintedanib group (4.5%) and 30 patients in the placebo group (9.1%). AEs leading to death in the 
follow-up period that were not treatment emergent, i.e. with an onset after the residual effect period, 
were reported for 12 patients in the nintedanib group and 8 patients in the placebo. 
Overall  a  higher  frequency  of  deaths  is  reported  in  the  placebo  group  compared  with  the  nintedanib 
group including in the 52-week period, over the whole trial up to DBL1 and by SOC, with the exception 
of the follow up period which reported deaths for 12 patients in the nintedanib group and 8 patients in 
the placebo.  
Laboratory findings 
The observed AEs and the known safety profile of nintedanib were reflected by the reported laboratory 
changes.  
Hypertension is a known ADR, where risk mitigation measures are present in the SPC including systemic 
blood pressure to be measured periodically as clinically indicated. Of note, the frequency of hypertension 
is reported with an increased frequency in the PF-ILD group compared to the IPF population. Weight loss 
is a known ADR and reported with the same frequency as for the IPF population. 
Similar  principles  of  grouping  as  performed  in  the  INBUILD  trial  will  be  applied  in  the  post  approval 
setting for reporting of safety data, wherever meaningful. Due to the limitations regarding data quality 
and completeness in post-marketing data sources, it is expected to receive a high proportion of case 
reports which do not allow for a classification beyond ILD. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety findings of trial 1199.247 for the 52 weeks and the whole trial data were overall consistent 
with the known safety profile of nintedanib in IPF including post-marketing data.  
Risk mitigation measures such as dose reduction/adjustments and warnings and precautions have been 
introduced in the SmPC for diarrhoea. 
All safety measures are considered adequate to encompass the presented safety profile and ADRs in the 
proposed population.  
The applicant confirms that similar principles of grouping of diagnosis as performed in the INBUILD trial 
will be applied, wherever meaningful, when providing safety data. However due to limitations regarding 
quality  and  completeness  of  data  in  post-marketing  data  sources,  it  is  expected  to  receive  a  high 
proportion of case reports which will not allow for a classification beyond ILD.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication for the treatment of other chronic fibrosing interstitial lung 
diseases (ILDs) with a progressive phenotype, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC are 
being updated. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients guideline, storage conditions, Braille, etc…], 
which were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. 
The Applicant took the opportunity to introduce minor changes in the PI, including annex II. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable since the amendment 
introduced are considered minor for the purpose of user consultation. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The term interstitial lung disease (ILD) encompasses a large group of over 200 pulmonary disorders. 
While idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the best-known progressive fibrosing ILD (PF-ILD), there is 
a  group  of  patients  with  different  underlying  clinical  ILD  diagnoses  other  than  IPF  who  develop  a 
progressive fibrosing phenotype during the course of their disease. These patients demonstrate a number 
of  similarities  to  patients  with  IPF,  with  their  disease  being  defined  by  the  presence  of  progressive 
pulmonary fibrosis, worsening respiratory symptoms, declining lung function despite immunomodulatory 
therapies and, ultimately, early mortality 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
With  the  exception  of  IPF,  for  which  nintedanib  and  pirfenidone  are  available,  there  is  no  approved 
therapy for other chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype. 
Immunosuppressive  agents  are  sometimes  used  off-label  in  patients  with  ILDs.  While  corticosteroids 
with or without immunosuppressive drugs were historically chosen as first-line treatment, they may not 
be effective. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant submitted one study (INBUILD study) investigating the use of nintedanib in patients with 
different  fibrosing  interstitial  lung  diseases  (ILDs)  with  progressive  phenotype  (progressive  Fibrosing 
Interstitial Lung Disease (PF-ILD). 
This was a multicentre, multinational, prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, doubleblind, parallel-
design clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of nintedanib in patients with PF-ILD over 52 
weeks. 
Assessment report  
EMA/315975/2020  
Page 108/116 
 
 
 
To be eligible for the trial, patients were to be diagnosed with a fibrosing ILD and to present with relevant 
lung fibrosis defined as features of diffuse fibrosing lung disease of >10% extent on HRCT. The presence 
of relevant lung fibrosis and the absence of other causes of progression were confirmed via qualitative 
assessment  of  screening  HRCT  images  by  central  reviewers.  The  threshold  of  >10%  total  extent  of 
fibrotic  features  was  selected  based  on  consensus  among  radiologists  and  clinicians  to  distinguish 
pathologic fibrotic processes from e.g. changes related to normal ageing. Impaired diffusion capacity of 
the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO, <80% of predicted normal) at baseline was also a requirement 
for  inclusion.  Patients  with  significant  pulmonary  hypertension  (cardiac  index  ≤ 2 L/min/m²,  or 
parenteral epoprostenol/treprostinil, or significant right heart failure) were excluded from the INBUILD 
trial. 
The prognosis and clinical behaviour of chronic fibrosing ILDs, particularly those with a usual interstitial 
pneumonia (UIP) pattern, seem to be similar to that of IPF. Accordingly, the trial population was planned 
to be enriched for patients with PF-ILD with UIP-like fibrotic pattern in order to increase the likelihood 
of detecting a clinically meaningful effect of nintedanib within the trial. 
The  clinical  efficacy  of  Ofev  has  been  studied  in  patients  with  other  chronic  fibrosing  ILDs  with  a 
progressive  phenotype  in  a  double-blind,  randomised,  placebo-controlled  phase  III  trial  (INBUILD). 
Patients with IPF were excluded. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of a chronic fibrosing ILD were selected 
if they had relevant fibrosis (greater than 10% fibrotic features) on HRCT and presented with clinical 
signs  of  progression  (defined  as  FVC  decline  ≥10%,  FVC  decline  ≥5%  and  <10%  with  worsening 
symptoms  or  imaging,  or  worsening  symptoms  and  worsening  imaging  all  in  the  24  months  prior  to 
screening). Patients were required to have an FVC greater than or equal to 45% of predicted and a DLCO 
30%  to  less  than  80%  of  predicted.  Patients  were  required  to  have  progressed  despite  management 
deemed appropriate in clinical practice for the patient’s relevant ILD. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In  the  study  significant  improvements  in  the  nintedanib  group  was  demonstrated  for  the  primary 
endpoint and also for some secondary endpoints. 
The primary endpoint of this study was the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) 
In the study in both co-primary populations (i.e.  overall population and the population of patients with 
HRCT)  the  annual  rate  of  decline  in  FVC  was  statistically  significantly  lower  in  patients  receiving 
treatment with nintedanib for 52 weeks as compared to patients receiving placebo.  
In  the  overall  population  the  adjusted  difference  in  the  annual  rate  of  decline  in  FVC  between  the 
treatment groups was 106.96 mL/year (95% CI 65.42, 148.50; p<0.0001) and in patients with UIP-like 
fibrotic pattern- the adjusted difference between the treatment groups was 128.20 mL/year (95% CI 
70.81, 185.59; p<0.0001). The reported differences between treatment and placebo groups was similar 
to those observed in studies in patients with IPF (In trials INPULSIS-1, INPULSIS-2 (pooled data) the 
observed difference between the treatment and placebo group was 109.9 ml).  
Sensitivity analyses support the results of the primary analysis. 
For the complementary population analysis (i.e. patients with other HRCT fibrotic patterns) the treatment 
effect was smaller (the adjusted difference in the annual rate of decline in FVC between the treatment 
groups  was  75.28  mL/year)  however  the  adjusted  difference  between  groups was  significant  (95%CI 
15.54, 135.01, p=0.0137). 
Over the whole trial, the proportion of patients with at least one event of first acute ILD exacerbation or 
death was 13.9% in the Ofev group and 19.6% in the placebo group. 
Patients reported outcomes 
In  the  study  there  were  a  few  secondary  endpoints  which  investigated  patients  reported  outcomes 
including  The  King’s  Brief  Interstitial  Lung  Disease  (K-BILD)  score,  Living  with  Pulmonary  Fibrosis 
Assessment report  
EMA/315975/2020  
Page 109/116 
 
 
 
Symptoms and Impact Questionnaire (L-PF), and Pulmonary Fibrosis Impact on Quality of Life Scale (PF-
IQOLS).  
The  King’s  Brief  Interstitial  Lung  Disease  (K-BILD)  score  was  investigated  in  the  study  as  a  main 
secondary endpoint. For this endpoint statistically significant differences between treatment groups were 
not reported for both co-primary populations. 
On  the  other  hand,  significant  improvements  in  symptoms  were  recorded  for  other  endpoints  which 
investigated patients reported outcomes in the study.  
The results of L-PF symptoms domain scores for both co-primary populations indicated that nintedanib 
prevented worsening of dyspnoea and cough symptoms compared with placebo.  Also the results of L-
PF total score, impact score, and symptoms total score were in favour of nintedanib treatment.  
Further, the improvement of quality of life was reported in the overall population as using Pulmonary 
Fibrosis Impact on Quality of Life Scale. 
Time to death 
In the study, time to death was investigated as a secondary endpoint. The analysis of time to death over 
52 weeks suggested a similar risk of death between treatment groups in the overall population whereas 
in patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern there was trend towards reduced risk of death in the 
nintedanib  group  (HR  0.68;  95%  CI  0.32,  1.47).  The  risk  of  progression  (≥ 10%  absolute  decline  of 
FVC % predicted) or death was reduced for patients treated with Ofev. The proportion of patients with 
an event was 35.2% in the Ofev group and 48.3% in the placebo group. The HR was 0.66 (95% CI: 
0.53, 0.83; p=0.0003), indicating a 34% reduction of the risk of progression (≥ 10% absolute decline 
of FVC % predicted) or death in patients receiving Ofev compared to placebo. 
Other endpoints 
A  relative  decline  from  baseline  in  FVC  %  predicted  of  >10%  was  found  to  be  linked  to  increased 
mortality. 
In  the  overall  population,  fewer  patients  in  the  nintedanib  group  (40.7%)  than  in  the  placebo  group 
(48.9%) had a relative decline from baseline in FVC % predicted of >10% at Week 52 according to the 
worst case analysis. The adjusted odds ratio was in favour of nintedanib compared with placebo (0.70; 
95% CI 0.52, 0.96). Similar results in favour of nintedanib were reported in patients with HRCT with 
UIP-like fibrotic pattern. The adjusted odds ratio was in favour of nintedanib compared with placebo and 
was 0.63 (95% CI 0.43, 0.94). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The  pivotal  study  was  enrolling  patients  with  different  fibrosing  interstitial  lung  diseases  (ILDs)  with 
progressive phenotype (progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease (PF-ILD). Patients were enrolled 
to this study based on the predicted progression pattern rather than underlying aetiology and underlying 
ILD diagnoses.  
The concept of progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease (PF-ILD) is not well established and it was 
not  validated  in  clinical  practice.  There  are  no  uniformly  accepted  criteria  as  to  how  patients  with 
progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease should be defined. However, the pivotal study enrolled 
specific patient populations and their characteristics have been specifically reflected in the SmPC section 
5.1 to aid physicians. 
The applicant proposed a very broad indication i.e Ofev is also indicated in adults for the treatment of 
other  chronic  fibrosing  interstitial  lung  diseases  (ILDs)  with  a  progressive  phenotype  which  is  now 
considered acceptable by CHMP.  
Not all types of ILDs with progressive behaviour were sufficiently represented in the study. For example, 
only  5  %  of  patients  had  environmental/occupational  fibrosing  lung  diseases  whereas  it  seems  that 
patients  with  idiopathic  pneumonia  with  autoimmune  features  were  not  enrolled.  Only  12  patients  in 
Assessment report  
EMA/315975/2020  
Page 110/116 
 
 
 
 
total had sarcoidosis. Finally, within the group of patients with autoimmune ILD the majority of patients 
had rheumatoid arthritis associated ILD whereas only a few patients with other types of autoimmune 
ILD were enrolled. While the data is limited and not powered for in these rare subtypes a similar rate of 
decline in lung function is seen. 
In addition, all patients enrolled to the study needed to show progression of disease despite treatment 
with unapproved medications used in clinical practice to treat ILD. Therefore, in this study nintedanib 
was  given  as  a  second  line  therapy  only.  Further,  the  study  population  was  limited  to  patients  with 
baseline DLCO ≥30% and <80% and FVC ≥45%. The MAH has taken this into account and has reflected 
the studied population in the product information as requested by the CHMP. 
Patients with other HRCT fibrotic patterns 
In the study there were two co-primary populations: All patients (the overall population) or patients with 
HRCT  with  UIP-like  fibrotic  pattern.  The  remaining  patients,  i.e.  those  with  patients  with  other  HRCT 
fibrotic patterns were termed the ‘complementary’ population. 
There are some uncertainties in relation to the efficacy in patients with other HRCT fibrotic patterns and 
also in relation the results of secondary endpoints in this subpopulation. There was a concern that the 
positive  results  seen  in  the  overall  population  were  mostly  driven  by  the  results  in  the  subgroup  of 
patients with UIP- fibrotic patterns. 
In view of the above uncertainties linked to the included population of the INBUILD study, the CHMP 
considered necessary to seek advice from an Ad Hoc Expert Group. Following the Ad Hoc Expert Group 
advice  and  additional  analyses  provided  by  the  MAH,  the  CHMP  was  reassured  by  the  possibility  to 
extrapolate to the population of patients not included or under-represented in the trial and effectively 
diagnose  patients  with  a  progressive  phenotype  within  the  large  group  of  about  200  different  ILD 
pulmonary disorders. The CHMP considered therefore that the broad indication is appropriate and well 
defined for health care professionals/prescribers and thus could be accepted. 
Additional  data  provided  by  the  company  demonstrated  some  improvement  in  symptoms  and  lung 
function  in  patients  with  other  fibrotic  patterns  receiving  nintedanib  with  a  statistically  significant 
difference for the absolute change for baseline for L-PF total score. 
While it is acknowledged that the number of patients with other fibrotic pattern is less than UIP pattern, 
consistently better results are demonstrated in the UIP pattern patients. However, the treatment effect 
in patients with other fibrotic pattern on HRCT is considered relevant and this was supported by the Ad 
hoc expert opinion. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety findings of trial 1199.247 (INBUILD) both for the 52 weeks and the whole trial safety 
data were consistent with the known safety profile of nintedanib in IPF including post-marketing data.  
The most frequently AEs reported as a frequency of very common, were gastrointestinal disorders, in 
particular diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and hepatobiliary disorders. Common AEs were 
mostly mild or moderate in intensity, with the exception of diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting which could be 
severe  in intensity  and lead  to  treatment interruption  and  dose  reduction.  Treatment  with  nintedanib 
was  also  associated  with  elevations  in  liver  enzymes  as  reported  for  the  other  indications.  The  large 
majority of liver enzyme elevations normalised upon treatment interruption, dose reduction, treatment 
discontinuation,  or  spontaneously  with  continued  treatment.  Diarrhoea,  nausea,  abdominal  pain  and 
vomiting were reported with higher frequency in the SENSCIS trial compared to INBUILD trial conducted 
for PF-ILD population. 
Patients  with  significant  pulmonary  hypertension  (cardiac  index  ≤  2 L/min/m ² ,  or  parenteral 
epoprostenol/treprostinil, or significant right heart failure) were excluded from the INBUILD trial. As a 
result  Ofev  is  recommended  not  be  used  in  patients  with  severe  pulmonary  hypertension  and  close 
monitoring is recommended in patients with mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension as stated in the 
SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.2. 
Assessment report  
EMA/315975/2020  
Page 111/116 
 
 
 
Additionally, warnings and precautions introduced in the SmPC to recommend treatment discontinuation, 
dose  reduction  are  adequate  to  encompass  the  presented  safety  profile  and  ADRs  in  the  proposed 
population. Safety data provided in the post-marketing setting will be analysed according to grouping of 
ILD diagnosis and underlying ILD diagnosis, owing to the small group size expected with these diagnoses. 
Similar principles of grouping as performed in the INBUILD trial will be applied, wherever meaningful. 
However, it is expected to receive a high proportion of case reports for which an exact classification of 
the disease beyond ILD will not be possible. 
Liver enzyme elevations for nintedanib are reflected as an important identified risk in the RMP. It is being 
continuously monitored in the post-marketing setting and the SmPC adequately informs the prescriber 
and patient about this risk and its management. 
Furthermore,  as  part  of  the  routine  PV  activities  dedicated  follow-up  questionnaires  (OFEV  Hepatic 
Adverse  Event  Form)  are  being  sent  out  for  case  reports  of  ‘Liver  enzyme  and  bilirubin  elevations 
including DILI’. This activity will remain to be performed for nintedanib independent of the underlying 
respiratory indication. Analysis by underlying ILD diagnosis will be performed for safety data related to 
liver enzyme elevations from post-marketing sources in respiratory indications in the future. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Trial  1199.247  evaluated  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  nintedanib  in  patients  independent  from  the 
underlying cause of their ILDs exhibited a progressive fibrosing phenotype (patients with PF-ILD). While 
clinical  diagnosis  of  a  chronic  fibrosing  ILD  was  a  requirement  for  inclusion  into  trial  1199.247,  the 
selection of patients was based on clinical signs of progressive disease. 
Specifically, to be eligible for the trial, patients were to be diagnosed with a fibrosing ILD and to present 
with relevant lung fibrosis defined as features of diffuse fibrosing lung disease of >10% extent on HRCT. 
The natural history in some of the rarer subgroups is not fully clear however it is accepted that patients 
with progressive IPF like phenotype will develop ongoing lung function decline, additional data will be 
provided  by  the  MAH  in  the  post  marketing  setting  from  ongoing  open  label  studies  and  registries  if 
feasible.  Safety  data  in  the  post-marketing  setting  will  be  analysed  according  to  ILD  diagnosis,  as 
appropriate. Monitoring of liver function and nauseas, vomiting abdominal pain

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Patients with ILDs especially with a sign of progression have a poor prognosis. With the exception of IPF, 
for  which  nintedanib  and  pirfenidone  are  available,  there  is  no  approved  therapy  for  other  chronic 
fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype. Immunosuppressive agents are sometimes used off-label 
in patients with ILDs. While corticosteroids with or without immunosuppressive drugs were historically 
chosen as first-line treatment, they may not be effective. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for 
an effective therapy for these patients. 
Evidence of efficacy was more clear in some disease categories which were well represented such as HP,  
iNSIP, Unclassified IIP, RA-ILD, SSc-ILD and exposure related ILD’s, however in the remaining groups 
which had lower patient numbers (MCTD-ILD, Sarcoidosis and other Fibrosing ILD’s) evidence was less 
clear. However, as INBUILD was not powered for individual disease categories it was accepted to group 
the conditions, in this case the efficacy was demonstrated for smaller disease cohorts. 
Following the Ad Hoc Expert Group advice and additional analyses provided by the MAH, the CHMP was 
reassured  by  the  possibility  to  extrapolate  to  the  population  of  patients  not  included  or  under-
represented in the trial based on the similar progressive pattern and to effectively diagnose patients with 
a  progressive  phenotype  within  the  large  group  of  about  200  different  ILD  pulmonary  disorders.  The 
CHMP considered therefore that the indication encompassing all chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive 
phenotype is appropriate and well defined for health care professionals/prescribers and thus could be 
accepted. 
In  relation  to  disease  pattern  on  HRCT,  nintedanib  was  found  to  be  efficacious  in  the  population  of 
patients enrolled to the pivotal study, especially in those with UIP-like fibrotic pattern on HRCT. In the 
annual  rate  of  decline  in  FVC  was  statistically  significantly  lower  in  patients  receiving  treatment  with 
nintedanib for 52 weeks as compared to patients receiving placebo.  
Improvement  was  also  reported  in  relation  to  some  secondary  endpoints  including  some  patients 
reported  outcomes.  The  results  of  L-PF  symptoms  domain  scores  for  both  co-primary  populations 
indicated  that  nintedanib  prevented  worsening  of  dyspnoea  and  cough  symptoms  compared  with 
placebo. 
No  significant  differences  in  relation  survival  in  the  overall  population  were  reported  in  the  study 
however, it is considered that the study was too short to conclude on any assessment of mortality. 
Overall, the safety findings were consistent with the known safety profile of nintedanib in IPF including 
post-marketing data. 
Therefore,  it  is  considered  that  nintedanib  is  recommended  for  approval  to  include  the  treatment  of 
chronic  fibrosing  interstitial  lung  diseases  (ILDs)  with  progressive  phenotype.  The  CHMP  also 
recommended the company to perform a post approval study to continue generating meaningful long-
term  data.  The  applicant  committed  to  generating  supplementary  data  from  registries  to  the  Agency

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, II and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of Indication to include new indication for OFEV for the treatment of other chronic fibrosing 
interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with a progressive phenotype based on the results of pharmacology 
studies and the double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase III trial (INBUILD). Consequently, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated in order to reflect the use of Ofev in 
the new indication. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.  
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor formatting changes in the PI. 
Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.1. The RMP version 9.1 
has also been adopted. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, II and IIIB and to the 
Risk Management Plan are recommended.

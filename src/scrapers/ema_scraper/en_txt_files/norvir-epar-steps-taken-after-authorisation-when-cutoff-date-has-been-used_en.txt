On  29  August  1996,  the  EMEA  approved  the  variation  (Type  I)  submitted  by  the  company 
relating  to  an  additional  manufacturing  site  as  a  site  where  the  product  assembly  of  bulk 
capsules imported from Abbott North Chicago takes place. 
On  11  December  1996,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  submitted  an  application 
for a Type II variation in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95. The scope 
of  the  variation  concerned  the  update  of  the  safety  information  in  the  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics  (SPC)  and  consequently  the  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  based  on  post-marketing 
experience and new pharmacokinetic data. On 19 March 1997, the CPMP adopted an opinion 
issued  on  
on 
22 July 1997. 
the  respective  Commission  Decision  was 
the  Type  II  variation  and 
On 4 April 1997, the MAH submitted an application for a Type II variation in accordance with 
Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  542/95.  The  MAH  applied  for  the  change  in  the  storage 
recommendations  for  Norvir  capsule.  As  a  consequence  to  this  change  the  Marketing 
Authorisation Holder applied also for lowering the assay specification at the end of shelf life. 
On  18  June  1997,  the  CPMP  adopted  an  opinion  on  the  Type  II  variation  and  the  respective 
Commission Decision was issued on 30 September 1997. 
On  11  September  1997,  the  MAH  submitted  two  applications  for  a  Type  I  variation  in 
accordance  with  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  542/95.  The  first  variation  related  to  the 
change in the manufacturer of the active substance meanwhile the second application concerned 
the amendment of the SPC with regard to the temperature at which the oral solution should be 
kept by the patient. On 6 November 1997, the EMEA approved both variations. 
Pursuant  to  Article  13(2)  of  Council  Regulation  (EEC)  No.  2309/93  and  Part  4g  of  Annex  to 
Council Directive 75/318/EEC, the MAH provided throughout the year additional efficacy and 
safety  data  as  stated  in  Annex  IIC  to  Commission  Decision,  which  formed  the  basis  of  the 
annual re-assessment of the risk/benefit profile of Norvir (e.g. results from the clinical endpoint 
studies). On 11 September 1997, the MAH provided an updated expert report summarising the 
different  specific  obligations  already  submitted  within  the  period  August  1996-August  1997. 
The procedure started on 26 September 1997. During its November plenary CPMP meeting, the 
CPMP agreed with the Rapporteur’s assessment report that the risk/benefit profile of ritonavir 
remained  favourable  and  that  the  MA  remains  under  exceptional  circumstances  until  all  the 
specific obligations are fulfilled.  
The  CPMP  adopted  on  19  November  1997  an  Opinion  on  the  annual  re-assessment  of  the 
specific obligations and the risk/benefit ratio, stating that amendments of Annexes I, II and III 
to the Community Marketing Authorisation are necessary. Subsequent applications for a Type II 
variation  (update  of  the  statement  in  the  SPC  on  the  combination  saquinavir/ritonavir  and 
update  of  the  SPC,  including  the  implementation  of  a  warning  statement  regarding  the  use  of 
Norvir  in  diabetic  patients)  were  submitted  by  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  and 
Opinions  were  adopted  by  the  CPMP  on  19  November  1997.  The  respective  Commission 
Decisions were issued on 17 March 1998. 
In  July  1998  Abbott  International  notified  the  EMEA  of  manufacturing  and  batch  release 
problems with the capsule due to the emergence of a new polymorphic form of ritonavir having 
a  much-reduced  solubility.  This  was  considered  by  CPMP  during  the  July  1998  meeting. 
Furthermore, a precipitation of the new polymorph had also been observed in the oral solution. 
Therefore, because of the foreseen supply shortage with the hard capsules, on 30 July 1998 the 
MAH submitted a request for an urgent safety restriction to the product literature for Norvir oral 
solution  to  enable  patients  to  be  transferred  from  the  hard  capsule  to  the  oral  solution.  This 
request was to allow the oral solution to be stored out of the refrigerator, with a reduced shelf 
life  and  warning  statements  concerning  storage  and  use.  This  urgent  safety  restriction  was 
agreed on public health grounds in the interests of maintaining continuity of ritonavir therapy.

Revised,  provisional  SPC,  label  and  package  leaflet  texts  were  adopted  within  the  24-hour 
timetable  allowed  for  in  this  procedure.  The  hard  capsules  were  subsequently  no  longer 
available for prescription. 
The  MAH  submitted  a  Type  II  variation  application  for  Norvir  80  mg/ml  oral  solution, 
subsequent  to  the  request  by  the  MAH  to  introduce  an  urgent  safety  restrictions  on  30  July 
1998, in accordance to Commission Regulation (EC) 542/95 as amended. The CPMP adopted 
an  Opinion  on  this  variation  on  16  September  1998  and  the  respective  Commission  Decision 
was issued on 11 January 1999. 
On  13  August  1998,  the  EMEA  issued  a  notification  on  a  Type  I  variation  submitted  by  the 
MAH on 13 July 1998. This variation related to minor modifications to the synthetic process of 
ritonavir and as a consequence the tightening of the specification with respect to impurities. 
On  27  November  1998,  the  EMEA  issued  a  notification  on  a  Type  I  variation  for  Norvir  
80  mg/ml  submitted  by  the  MAH  on  18  September  1998.  This  variation  related  to  the 
introduction of a new in-process control to confirm the absence of undissolved ritonavir crystals 
due to the low solubility of polymorphic Form II of ritonavir. 
The  MAH  submitted  an  application  for  a  Type  II  variation  on  14  April  1998  related  to  the 
extension of the indication for paediatric population. The variation procedure was extended in 
order to provided requested additional data on efficacy and safety to allow for further evaluation 
of the variation. On 19 November 1998, the CPMP adopted an Opinion on this variation and the 
respective Commission Decision was issued on 26 February 1999. 
The MAH submitted an application for variation on 15 October 1998 related to the update of the 
SPC  (interaction  section).  On  19  November  1998,  the  CPMP  adopted  an  Opinion  on  this 
variation and the respective Commission Decision was issued on 26 February 1999. 
Pursuant  to  CPMP  discussion  on  cases  of  lipodystrophy  and  other  metabolic  disorders  as 
reported  from  HIV  infected  patients  and  treated  with  protease  inhibitors,  the  MAHs  for  the 
respective PIs submitted to the EMEA an application for a Type II variation to include a class 
labelling wording into the SPC. On 19 November 1998, the CPMP adopted an Opinion on this 
variation and the respective Commission Decision was issued on 26 February 1999. 
Pursuant to Article 13(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 as amended and Part 4G of 
Annex to Council Directive 75/318/EEC as amended, the MAH  provided throughout the year 
additional efficacy and safety data as stated in Annex II to Commission Decision, which formed 
the  basis  of  the  2nd  annual  re-assessment  of  the  risk/benefit  profile  of  Norvir.  On  
1 September 1998, the MAH provided the documentation and the procedure for the annual re-
assessment  started  on  18  September  1998.  During  its  November  CPMP  plenary  meeting,  the 
CPMP agreed that the risk/benefit profile of Norvir  remained  favourable. The CPMP adopted 
on 19 November 1998 an Opinion on the annual re-assessment stating that no amendments to 
Annexes to Community Marketing Authorisation are necessary and that the MA should be kept 
under  exceptional  circumstances  until  all  the  specific  obligations  are  fulfilled.  The  respective 
Commission Decision was issued on 23 February 1999.

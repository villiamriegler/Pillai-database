2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement  
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic and progressive disease, characterized by 
stepwise  deterioration  of  lung  function,  is  a  life-limiting  illness.  Although  the  causative  factors  and 
pathogenesis of COPD are not fully understood, it is commonly accepted, that the exposure (direct and 
passive)  to  cigarette  smoke,  occupational  dusts,  chemicals  and  any  other  pollutants  is  the  most 
important risk factor for development of this disease. The pathological picture of COPD involves small 
airway inflammation and remodelling, mucociliary dysfunction, lung architecture damage. The result of 
the natural course of this disease is a progressive decrease of airflow and deficit in gas exchange in the 
lungs,  resulting  in  systemic  hypoxia  with  destructive  consequences  to  the  whole  body,  including  the 
cardiovascular system and all internal organs. 
A causative therapy of the disease is not available. The strategy of COPD management is symptomatic. 
The  main  goals  of  such  therapy  are  realized  by  maintenance  of  best  possible  airflow  with 
bronchodilators  to  improve  lung  function  and  multidisciplinary  supportive  care  including  prevention 
and/or therapy of exacerbations (respiratory infections), and, anti-inflammatory therapy. 
About the product  
Aclidinium bromide is classified as an anticholinergic (ATC code R03BB05). It is a long-acting, inhaled 
anticholinergic agent which has strong affinity and selectivity for all muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1-
M5)  and  kinetic  selectivity  for  the  M3  receptor  over  the  M2  receptor.  Inhaled  aclidinium  bromide 
inhibited  acetylcholine-induced  bronchoconstriction  in  anesthetised  guinea-pigs,  with  a  duration  of 
action (expressed as the half-life for the bronchodilatory effect) of 29 hours.  
Eklira  Genuair  322  μg  inhalation  powder,  consists  of  an  adhesive  mixture  of  micronised  aclidinium 
bromide and α lactose monohydrate, contained within a device-metered, dry powder inhaler, Genuair 
inhaler.  Each  delivered  dose  (the  dose  leaving  the  mouthpiece)  of  Eklira  Genuair  contains  375  µg 
aclidinium bromide (WHO officially approved INN) equivalent to 322 µg of aclidinium. This corresponds 
to a metered dose of 400 µg aclidinium bromide equivalent to 343 µg aclidinium. 
The claimed and approved indication is the maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms 
in  adult  patients  with  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD).  The  proposed  delivered  dose  is 
322  μg  (metered  dose  is  343  μg)  aclidinium  to  be  used  twice  daily,  corresponding  to  two  oral 
inhalations per day from the Genuair inhaler. 
It should be noted that the data submitted in the application dossier referred to Eklira Genuair 400 μg 
as  the  finished  medicinal  product,  which  corresponds  to  the  metered  dose  of  the  active  substance 
(aclidinium  bromide),  not  the  active  moiety  (aclidinium).  This  was  the  basis  used  during  the 
assessment  of  this  application.  However  in  accordance  with  the  “Guideline  on  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics  (SmPC)  and  QRD  Recommendations  on  the  expression  of  strength  in  the  name  of 
Centrally Authorised Human Medicinal Products” (as stated in Section 1 of the SmPC and in the name 
section  of  the  Labelling  and  Package  Leaflet),  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  strength  should  refer  to  the 
delivered dose of the active moiety (aclidinium) and therefore the name of the medicinal product finally 
approved  by  the  Committee  was  expressed  as  follows:  Eklira  Genuair  322  μg,  in  all  official  approved 
documents (CHMP opinion/future EC decision and CHMP opinion Annexes I, II and III). The strength is 
expressed  as  delivered  dose  of  aclidinium.  However,  since  400  μg  (metered  dose  of  aclidinium 
bromide)  was  the  strength  referred  to  throughout  the  non-clinical  and  clinical  development  of  this 
Eklira Genuair 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169578/2012 
Page 7/72
 
 
medicinal  product  and  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  this  has  been  left  unchanged  in  the 
sections  of  this  assessment  report  relating  to  the  non-clinical  and  clinical  development.  No  changes 
have  been  made  to  the  dossier  or  the  assessment  reports  which  states  the  active  substance  as 
aclidinium bromide 400 μg metered dose or 375 μg delivered dose.  
Type of Application and aspects on development  
This  application  was  submitted  in  accordance  with  Article  8(3)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC.  It  was 
submitted  via  the  centralised  procedure  under  Article  3(2)(a)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No.  726/2004 
(optional scope for a new active substance).  
National  Scientific  Advice  was  given  by  a  number  of  European  regulatory  agencies.  Two  series  of 
clinical  Scientific  Advice  meetings  were  held,  the  most  recent  in  2009  and  previously  in  2005.  Topics 
discussed  in  these  advice  procedures  were  related  to  the  design  of  the  pivotal  studies  of  aclidinium 
bromide BID, the adequacy of some clinical pharmacology studies to support registration of aclidinium 
bromide as well as the design of the pivotal studies of aclidinium bromide QD. 
Pursuant  to  Article  7  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision 
P/345/2010 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on the granting of a class waiver on the 
basis that COPD should only be considered in an individual over the age of 40 years with characteristic 
symptoms of COPD according to GOLD.

study on the respiratory system in guinea pigs and some of the cardiovascular system studies (in vitro 
study in isolated piglet Purkinje fibres and in vivo studies on haemodynamic parameters in dogs). The 
non-GLP studies generally seem to have been conducted in a scientifically appropriate manner. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
A  series  of  in  vitro  studies  has  shown  aclidinium  bromide  to  be  a  competitive  inhibitor  of  muscarinic 
receptors. It has a similar potency at all five human muscarinic receptors (affinity values of 0.09, 0.1, 
0.12, 0.25 and 0.16 nM for M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5 receptors, respectively), but kinetically, shows a 
preference  for  the  M3  receptor.  The  in  vitro  test  systems  used  were  CHO  cells  expressing  the 
muscarinic  receptors  and  isolated  tissues  including  guinea  pig  trachea,  guinea  pig  left  atria,  human 
trachea  and  rabbit  iris;  carbachol-,  acetylcholine-  and  electrically-induced  contractions  were  used  in 
these studies, and comparisons were made with ipratropium bromide and tiotropium bromide. 
Potency  was  similar  for  aclidinium,  tiotropium  and  ipratropium  bromides  in  these  studies,  but  offset 
times/dissociation  from  the  receptors  was  fastest  for  ipratropium  bromide, and  longest  for  tiotropium 
bromide. Aclidinium bromide showed offset times/dissociation from the receptors that were longer than 
for  ipratropium  bromide,  but  shorter,  although  closer  to  those  for  tiotropium  bromide.  For  example, 
half-lives  for  dissociation  from  the  M3  receptors  were  29.2,  0.47  and  62.2  hours  for  aclidinium 
bromide, ipratropium bromide and tiotropium bromide, respectively.  
In vivo studies showed inhibition of Ach-induced bronchoconstriction in anaesthetised guinea pigs and 
dogs; potency and onset/duration of action were investigated.   
In  anaesthetised  guinea  pigs,  the  onset  of  action  of  aclidinium  bromide  (30  min)  was  similar  to 
ipratropium  bromide  (30  min)  but  faster  than  tiotropium  bromide  (80  min).  The  duration  of  action 
(measured as time needed to decrease the maximal effect by 50%) was also assessed in guinea pigs. 
The duration of action of aclidinium bromide (t1/2= 29 h) was longer than ipratropium bromide (t1/2= 
8h) and shorter than tiotropium bromide (t1/2= 64 h).  
Aclidinium  bromide  and  tiotropium  bromide  showed  similar  long-lasting  effects  on  acetylcholine-
induced  bronchospasm  in  dogs,  inhibiting  it  up  to  87%  and  99%  respectively,  when  administered  by 
aerosolation in a liquid formulation. 
The  S-isomer  of  aclidinium  bromide  (LAS35040)  had  little  affinity  for  muscarinic  receptors  in  vitro 
(45.5 nM, 16 nM and 154.8 nM for M1, M2 and M3 respectively, which is 325, 94 and 910 times less 
potent  than  aclidinium  bromide  at  these  receptors)  and 
limited  effect  on  Ach- 
induced 
bronchoconstriction  in  anaesthetised  guinea  pigs  (maximal  effect  of  37%  inhibition  at  1000  μg/mL, 
when administered by aerosol [EC50 >1000 μg/mL compared with 2.9 μg/mL for aclidinium bromide]).  
The  main  metabolites  of  aclidinium  bromide,  LAS34823  and  LAS34850,  had no  affinity  for  muscarinic 
receptors  in  vitro  and  did  not  show  any  significant  effect  on  Ach-  induced  bronchoconstriction  in 
anaesthetised guinea pigs when administered by inhalation.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Possible secondary pharmacology effects of aclidinium bromide and its main metabolites LAS34823 and 
LAS34850 have been investigated using a range of enzymes and receptors. The metabolites showed no 
affinity  for  any  of  the  receptors,  enzymes,  ion  channels  and  transporters  tested.  Aclidinium  bromide 
showed  only  moderate  affinity  (IC50  was    1 μM)  for  α1,  H1  (central),  NK1,  and  5-HT  uptake 
receptors.  On  the  basis  of  these  results,  secondary  pharmacology  effects  are  considered  unlikely  at 
therapeutic exposures. 
Safety pharmacology programme  
Aclidinium bromide had no remarkable effects on the central nervous system in an Irwin test or study 
of spontaneous activity in mice following single oral doses up to 300mg/kg. 
In  a  series  of  cardiovascular  studies,  aclidinium  bromide  blocked  the  hERG  channel  with  an  IC50  of 
19.7 μM. It had no effect on QTc interval in anaesthetised rats or guinea pigs at iv doses or 3 mg/kg or 
1 mg/kg, respectively, and there were no ECG changes in a rat repeated dose SC study following doses 
of 2.5mg/kg twice daily for 25 days. Slight decreases in heart rate were noted in an escalating dose iv 
study  in  anesthetised  dogs  at  doses  up  to  300 μg/kg,  without  consistent  effect  on  ECG.  Transient 
effects on haemodynamic parameters were recorded at iv doses up to 1000 μg/kg iv in anaesthetised 
dogs, whilst in conscious dogs at an iv dose of 100 μg/kg, heart rate increased with minimal effect on 
QT (and negligible effect on QTc). A brief chronotropic effect was noted in conscious dogs at 100 μg/kg 
iv, in contrast to tiotropium bromide, which produced a more sustained chronotropic effect at a 10-fold 
lower  dose.  Therefore  there  were  some  minor  cardiovascular  effects  in  some  studies,  but  at 
concentrations that generally exceeded clinical exposure by at least three orders of magnitude. 
Aclidinium bromide had no effect on tracheal mucociliary transport rate in isolated piglet trachea or in 
anaesthetised guinea pigs following an iv dose, and did not affect respiratory parameters in conscious 
guinea pigs following inhalation of an aerosol. 
Studies  on  renal  function  in  dogs  (intravenous  dose  of  1 mg/kg)  and  urinary  retention  in  rats  (SC 
doses up to 1 mg/kg) and guinea pigs (intratracheal doses up to 100µg/kg) showed aclidinium bromide 
to  have  no  significant  effects  on  these  parameters,  whereas  effects  were  noted  with  tiotropium 
bromide and ipratropium bromide.   
In  anaesthetised  mice  and  conscious  rats,  aclidinium  bromide  was  less  potent  in  inducing  dry  mouth 
than  tiotropium  bromide  and  ipratropium  bromide.  Colonic  motility  was  not  affected  by  aclidinium 
bromide  in  anaesthetised  guinea  pigs,  whereas  tiotropium  bromide  significantly  inhibited  colonic 
motility.  Aclidinium  bromide  decreased  faecal  output  in  conscious  rats  with  a  16-fold  lower  potency 
than tiotropium bromide.  
These  results  suggest  that  aclidinium  bromide  is  less  likely  to  induce  urinary  retention,  dry  mouth 
and/or constipation than tiotropium bromide or ipratropium bromide. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Aclidinium  bromide  did  not  affect  either  the  incidence  or  the  rate  of  formoterol-induced  ventricular 
tachycardia  in  conscious  dogs  when  the  two  drugs  were  co-administered.  In  addition  to  the  studies 
with  formoterol,  the  applicant  provided  new  data  from  studies  on  the  effects  of  combining  aclidinium 
bromide with indacaterol and salmeterol on the heart rate of conscious dogs following administration of 
high intravenous doses. The intravenous route of administration was chosen to ensure high peak and 
onset of activity of both compounds tested. The Cmax plasma levels were 2000, 7.3 and 49 fold higher 
than  observed  in  clinical  use  for  aclidinium  bromide,  salmeterol  and  indacaterol,  respectively.  There 
Eklira Genuair

was  no  indication  of  a  synergistic  or  additive  effect  on  heart  rate  when  these  compounds  were  co-
administered. Although no specific studies were conducted with the combination of aclidinium bromide 
and  short-acting  beta  agonists  (e.g.  salbutamol),  the  applicant  suggested  that  the  intravenous 
administration of high doses of LABA may mimic the rapid onset of activity expected from some of the 
short-acting  beta-agonists.  Overall  the  potential  for  pharmacodynamics  interactions  between 
aclidinium bromide and beta adrenergic agents has been discussed adequately.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Pharmacokinetic studies confirmed exposure of mice, rats and dogs to aclidinium bromide and its main 
metabolites  LAS34823  (alcohol  derivative,  quaternized  3-(R)-quinuclidinol)  and  LAS34850  (acid 
derivative, dithienylglycolic acid), irrespective of the route of administration.  
Generally,  exposure  to  aclidinium  bromide  and  its  alcohol  metabolite  were  similar,  with  the  main 
circulating compound being the acid metabolite.  
Aclidinium bromide is poorly absorbed by the oral route, and rapidly hydrolysed non-enzymatically and 
by esterases distributed throughout the body, therefore its oral systemic bioavailability is negligible.  
Exposure  to  aclidinium  bromide  and  its  metabolites  in  humans  following  an  inhaled  400 μg  dose  is 
considerably lower than the values obtained in the animal studies. 
Distribution 
Aclidinium  bromide,  labelled  as  either  [phenyl-14C]  or  [glycolyl-14C],  was  rapidly  and  widely 
distributed following intravenous administration to male and female albino rats and pregnant females. 
The  main  organs  of  distribution  were  kidney,  bladder,  pancreas  and  GI  tract  tissues.  Absorption  and 
distribution were lower after oral dosing, with radioactivity mainly in GI tissues.  
A  single  intratracheal  injection  to  male  albino  rats  showed  similar  absorption  and  distribution  to  that 
following oral administration, but with higher levels in the lungs.   
Distribution  did  not  appear  to  be  different  in  pigmented  compared  with  albino  rats.  Radioactivity 
crosses the placenta in pregnant rats and is found in the milk of lactating rats.  
Binding to melanin is limited and reversible.  
In vitro plasma protein binding showed that the acid metabolite (LAS34850) of aclidinium bromide was 
more highly bound than the alcohol metabolite (LAS34823), with binding across species ranging from 
66  to  87%  and  12  to  26%,  respectively.  Binding  was  independent  of  concentration  and  in  human 
plasma, binding appears to be mainly to human serum albumin. 
Metabolism 
In  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies  demonstrate  that  the  main  metabolic  pathway  for  aclidinium  bromide  is 
hydrolysis  to  its  alcohol  and  acid  metabolites,  LAS34823  (quaternized  3-(R)-quinuclidinol)  and 
LAS34850  (dithienylglycolic  acid),  respectively,  in  all  species  studied  (mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog  and 
human). There are no human-specific metabolites. 
In human liver microsomes, non-enzymatic hydrolysis was the main route of metabolism of aclidinium 
bromide. Other minor oxidative metabolic routes were identified for aclidinium bromide and the alcohol 
Eklira Genuair 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169578/2012 
Page 14/72
 
 
metabolite  LAS34823,  mainly  catalysed  by  CYP2D6  and  CYP3A4.  The  acid  metabolite  LAS34850  was 
not further metabolised enzymatically in human liver microsomes. 
There  were  no  qualitative  differences  in  the  metabolism  of  aclidinium  bromide  when  incubated  with 
human  and  Aroclor  1254-induced  rat  S9  liver  fractions.  Covalent  protein  binding  was  low  in  all  the 
conditions  assayed  and  there  was  no  significant  difference  between  the  two  species,  although  there 
was a tendency for the covalent binding to be higher in the Aroclor 1254-induced rat S9 liver fractions.  
In vitro irreversible binding in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and human hepatocytes was <2% in all cases.  
In  hepatocytes  from  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog,  and  human,  the  main  radioactive  metabolites  of 
[14C-phenyl]-LAS34273  were  LAS34823  (M2,  the  alcohol  metabolite)  and  its  p-hydroxy  metabolite 
(M1).  Glucuronide  conjugates  were  also 
formed.  The  major 
radioactive  metabolite  of 
[14C-glycolyl]-LAS34273  in  hepatocytes  was  LAS34850  (the  acid  metabolite).  Several  minor  polar 
metabolites were also seen.  
Aclidinium  bromide  was  less  stable  than  ipratropium  bromide,  tiotropium  bromide  and  glycopyrrolate 
bromide in plasma from humans, dogs, rats and guinea pigs. 
Investigation of the enzymes involved in hydrolysis of aclidinium bromide showed that the B-esterases 
and  particularly  butyrylcholinesterase  had  a  major  role.  Butyrylcholinesterase  is  widely  distributed  in 
the human body, mainly localised in plasma but butyrylcholinesterase activity has also been observed 
in  human  pulmonary  and  liver  subcellular  fractions,  which  means  that  aclidinium  bromide  hydrolysis 
can  take  place  in  these  organs  before  entering  the  systemic  circulation  after  inhalatory  and  oral 
administration.  
In vivo metabolism studies in rat, dog, mouse and pregnant rabbit reflect the in vitro findings. 
Excretion 
Both urinary and faecal routes of elimination are used. Following intravenous administration of [14C]-
glycolyl-aclidinium  bromide,  most  radioactivity  (mostly  LAS34850)  was  eliminated  in  the  urine  in  all 
species investigated, while intravenous administration of [14C]-phenyl-aclidinium bromide led to most 
radioactivity  (LAS34823,  mono-hydroxy-LAS34823  and  its  glucuronide  conjugate)  being  eliminated 
mainly  in  the  urine  in  mice,  dogs  and  humans,  mainly  in  the  faeces  in  rats  and  equally  in  urine  and 
faeces in pregnant rabbits. Most of the dose was eliminated within 48 hours in most species, although 
in man, elimination was generally within 96 or 120 hours. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
In vitro studies on the effects of aclidinium bromide and its main metabolites LAS34823 and LAS34850 
as  substrates,  inducers  and/or  inhibitors  of  human  hepatic  cytochrome  P450  isozymes,  plasma 
esterases or P-glycoprotein have been conducted. 
Aclidinium bromide and its metabolites LAS34823 and LAS34850 did not show any significant induction 
of cytochrome P450 expression in cultured human hepatocytes. 
Aclidinium  bromide  and  LAS34823  competitively  inhibited  CYP  2D6  (IC50s  of  2.4  and  20.6 μM, 
respectively) and aclidinium bromide showed slight inhibition of CYP 3A4/5 (IC50 of about 90 μM).

inhibition  of  carboxylesterase  activity  (IC50  of  about  50  μM).  LAS34823  slightly  inhibited 
acetylcholinesterase  and  butyrylcholinesterase  with  IC50  values  of  about  100  μM  Paraoxonase  and

arylesterase were not inhibited by any of the compounds, and LAS34850 (100 μM) had no effect on the 
activity of any of the esterases studied. 
These  IC50  values  are  well  in  excess  of  the  human  plasma  Cmax  levels  of  aclidinium  bromide 
(0.077 ng/mL,  0.136  nM)  or  LAS34823  (0.071  ng/mL,  0.207  nM)  following  inhalation  of  therapeutic 
doses  of  aclidinium  bromide  (400μg  BID).  Therefore  clinically  relevant  doses  of  aclidinium  bromide 
would not be expected to alter the disposition of drugs metabolised by the human CYP450 enzymes or 
of acetylcholine or drugs metabolised by the human esterases. 
P-glycoprotein is not inhibited by aclidinium bromide or its metabolites, and nor are they substrates for 
this transporter, therefore the disposition of aclidinium bromide or drugs that are P-gp substrates are 
unlikely to be altered when co-administered. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Aclidinium  bromide  showed  little  or  no  toxicity  in  rats  following  single  oral,  intravenous  or  inhalation 
doses of up to 2000 mg/kg, 1.2 mg/kg or 3.7-3.8 mg/kg, respectively. Deaths in an oral mouse study 
occurred only in females and at the low and mid doses and not at the high dose of 2000 mg/kg. In a 
subsequent (micronucleus) study using the same oral doses, there were no deaths. The deaths in the 
single-dose study remain unexplained.   
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeated dose studies have been carried out in mice, rats and dogs using the clinical (inhalation) route 
as  well  as  intravenous,  subcutaneous  and  oral  routes.  A  number  of  the  studies  were  conducted  to 
investigate the cause of deaths seen in the rat studies. 
In  a  13-week  inhalational  study  in  the  mouse,  reduced  body  weight  gains  were  observed  at  the  top 
dose (2 mg/kg/day) and liver weights were increased in treated animals. The NOAEL was considered to 
be 0.61 mg/kg/day.  
Effects on the respiratory system were noted in 2-week and 4-week inhalational toxicity studies in the 
rat. Nasal cavity goblet cell hyperplasia and inflammation were noted in the nasal cavity in the 2-week 
study, with the inflammation suggestive of minor irritation. In the 4-week study, pathological findings 
in the Harderian gland were seen. Nasal cavity and nasopharyngeal goblet cell hyperplasia and alveolar 
macrophages were also noted but there was no accompanying inflammation and the findings were not 
considered to be of toxicological concern. 
In  the  6-month  inhalational  toxicity  study  in  rats  at  doses  from  0.1  to  2  mg/kg/day,  a  number  of 
deaths  without  dose-dependence  occurred.  Remnants  of  the  dry  food  were  found  in  the  larynx  and 
oesophagus, and the presence of food was considered to be related to a reduction in salivation due to 
the  pharmacological  action  of  aclidinium  bromide.  Hypertrophy  of  the  parotid  glands  and  associated 
pathological  findings  were  correlated  with  the  proposed  pharmacologically  mediated  reduction  in 
salivation.  The  main  histopathological  findings  in  this  6-month  study  comprised  haemosiderin 
deposition  in  the  adventitia  of  blood  vessels  of  the  lungs,  perivascular  inflammation  in  arterioles  and 
arteries along with BALT and alveolar macrophages at all doses. Alveolar wall hyperplasia/hypertrophy 
was increased in incidence at the mid- and high-dose. The Harderian gland was again a target organ 
with porphyrin deposition and hypertrophy noted. A NOAEL was not established in this study.  
A  second  6-month  inhalation  study  was  conducted  in  rats  using  lower  doses  of  0.01,  0.04,  0.08,  0.2 
mg/kg/day.  There  were  a  similar  number  of  deaths  in  the  treated  animals,  which  were  again 
Eklira Genuair 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169578/2012 
Page 16/72
 
 
considered to be related to the pharmacological action of aclidinium bromide. These animals also had 
remnants of food in the larynx and oesophagus. The lungs, Harderian glands and parotid glands were 
again  primary  target  organs.  The  NOAEL  established  in  this  second  6-month  rat  inhalational  toxicity 
study  was  0.04  mg/kg/day.  The  AUC  for  aclidinium  bromide  was  about  20-fold  that  in  humans, 
extrapolated  from  the  AUC  in  young  and  old  COPD  patients  following  metered  doses  of  400  μg  once 
daily. 
The  same  pattern  of  deaths  (7/100  treated  rats)  occurred  in  a  further  6-month  inhalational  toxicity 
study  at  0  and  2  mg/kg/day.  Yellowish  or  reddish  discoloration  or  discoloured  foci  in  the  lungs  was 
seen  in  some  animals  at  the  end  of  the  study,  accompanied  by  pigment-laden  alveolar  macrophages 
and/or  alveolar  macrophage  conglomerates.  Broncho-alveolar  lavage  fluid  investigations  showed  no 
effects on IL-6, TNF-α and histamine levels but there were increased numbers of macrophages in the 
broncho-alveolar  lavage  fluid  in  a  few  treated  animals  from  2  months  onwards.  Histopathology 
investigations  showed  haemosiderin  deposition  in  alveolar  macrophages  after  1  month  of  exposure, 
which increased in incidence and severity until the end of the study. Macrophage conglomeration with 
compression  of  alveolar  walls  was  not  seen  in  this  study,  and  there  was  also  no  inflammatory 
component  of  small  arteries  and  arterioles.  As  seen  in  the  earlier  studies,  findings  in  the  Harderian 
gland  were  observed.  Squamous  metaplasia  was  noted  in  the  larynx  in  some  treated  animals  after  3 
months  of  exposure.  This finding  had  been  shown  to  be  reversible in  the  previous  6-month  study.  In 
the parotid gland, diffuse acinar hypertrophy was noted in a few cases at 6 months. 
Another 6-month inhalation toxicity study was carried out in rats at 0 or 2 mg/kg/day to compare the 
toxicity  of  two  different  batches  of  aclidinium  bromide.  The  findings  were  similar  to  those  in  the 
previous study, with target organs being the lungs, parotid glands and Harderian glands. There was no 
difference in toxicity profile between the two batches. 
In a further study to investigate whether inhibition of salivation and impairment of swallowing due to 
the  anti-muscarinic  action  of  aclidinium  bromide  was  responsible  for  the  deaths  noted  in  inhalation 
studies, telemetered rats were dosed at 0 or 2.5 mg/kg twice daily via the subcutaneous route for 25 
days.  Aclidinium  bromide  induced  gasping  and  coughing  episodes,  which  were  more  frequent  during 
the  dark  period  i.e.  during  the  period  of  feeding.  Rats  appeared  to  have  difficulty  swallowing.  In  a 
second rat study using the subcutaneous route with treatment over 28 days and with diurnal access to 
food, the most noteworthy clinical signs observed were difficulty with swallowing the food and repeated 
choking  and  gasping  episodes.  A  low  incidence  and  slight  severity  of  pigment-laden  alveolar  and 
adventitial macrophages in the lungs was seen. 
In a 26-week study via the subcutaneous route, rats were dosed at 1 mg/kg/day and effects due to the 
pharmacological  action  of  aclidinium  bromide  were  seen.  These  included  two  deaths  with  food 
remnants  in  the  larynx,  reversible  mydriasis,  and  histopathological  findings  in  lungs,  parotid  glands 
and Harderian glands.   
The  studies  conducted  are  considered  to  provide  sufficient  evidence  that  the  deaths  seen  in  the 
repeated-dose rat studies are a result of the antimuscarinic activity of aclidinium bromide resulting in 
reduced  salivation  and  resultant  difficulty  in  swallowing  food.  Anti-muscarinic  activity  affecting 
oesophageal  motility  may  also  have  been  involved.  Choking  and  gasping  episodes  and  remnants  of 
food  in  the  larynx  could  explain  the  pigment-laden  alveolar  macrophages  in  the  lung  and  deaths  by 
asphyxiation.  A  similar  explanation  for  the  cause  of  the  unusual  mortality  has  been  proposed  for 
tiotropium  bromide.  Further  support  for  the  mechanism  is  the  absence  of  increases  of  inflammatory 
markers  in  the  bronchioalveolar  lavage  fluid  and  of  inflammatory  infiltrates  in  the  lungs  in  the 
mechanistic inhalation study, suggesting an absence of hypersensitivity or immunological reaction.  
Oral studies were carried out in the rat for 2 and 4 weeks. Findings included mydriasis and compacted 
faeces in the rectum and colon and were expected antimuscarinic pharmacological effects of aclidinium

bromide.  The  NOAELs  were  the  high  doses  of  640  and  450  mg/kg/day,  respectively.  Mydriasis  was 
again  noted  in  a  14-day  repeated  intravenous  (bolus)  dose  study  in  rats  at  all  doses  (0.06-0.6 
mg/kg/day), with the highest dose being the NOAEL, at which AUC was 130-fold human exposure.   
In 2-week and 4-week inhalation studies in dogs, transient increases in heart rate and shortening of P-
Q and/or Q-T intervals were seen at doses of 0.125, 1 and 2 mg/kg/day. Food consumption and body 
weight increased and salivary gland weight increased at 1 and 2 mg/kg/day. 
In a 39-week inhalation study in dogs, the high dose of 1.6 mg/kg/day was reduced to 0.8 mg/kg/day 
following the deaths of some male dogs. Reduced tear production and increased incidence and severity 
of  restlessness  (in  males)  were  seen,  as  well  as  decreased  body  weight  and  food  consumption. 
Transient increases in heart rate and P-wave amplitude and/or shortening of QT interval occurred. The 
reduced  tear  production and  changes  in  heart  rate  were  reversible  and  the  NOAEL  was considered  to 
be 0.22 mg/kg/day.   
A 2-week oral study in dogs at doses of 0, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200 mg/kg/day showed decreased food 
intake  and  body  weight  and  increased  heart  rate  from  25  mg/kg/day.  At  50  mg/kg/day  and  above, 
there  were  signs  of  effects  on  the  central  nervous  system,  with  decreased  activity  and  tremors,  and 
additional signs at the high dose included somnolence, recumbency and abnormal posture. The NOAEL 
was therefore 25 mg/kg/day. 
In  a  4-week  oral  study  in  dogs,  aclidinium  bromide  at  doses  of  5,  25,  125  mg/kg/day  was  generally 
well  tolerated,  with  effects  considered  to  be  related  to  the  pharmacological  action  such  as  increased 
heart rate and reduced tear production. Ophthalmic findings were related to decreased tear production. 
The NOAEL is considered to be 125 mg/kg/day.  
In these two oral studies in dogs, similar doses were used but the NOAELs were quite different. Clinical 
signs indicative of CNS effects were noted at 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day in the 2-week study but not 
in  the  4-week  study.  The  latter  study  is  considered  more  reliable  than  the  dose  range-finding  study. 
The polar nature of aclidinium bromide makes it unlikely to cross the blood brain barrier. The plasma 
concentrations of both aclidinium bromide and the major acid metabolite LAS34850 were greater in the 
4-week  than  in  the  2-week  study.  The  clinical  signs  in  the  2-week  study  were  therefore  attributed  to 
secondary effects caused by the pharmacological activity of a high dose of an antimuscarinic drug on 
the  gastrointestinal  tract  rather  than  a  direct  effect  on  the  CNS.  The  dogs  used  in  the  4-week  study 
came  from  a  different  breeder  and  could  have  been  less  sensitive  to  the  local  gastrointestinal  effects 
induced by aclidinium bromide than the animals used in the 2-week study. 
In  a  2-week  intravenous  study  in  dogs,  there  were  pharmacological  signs  (dry  oral  mucous 
membranes,  dry  noses  and  increased  heart  rate)  at  all  doses  (0.06,  0.2  and  0.6mg/kg/day).  These 
effects  were  not  evident  in  the  recovery  animals.  The  NOAEL  was  therefore  considered  to  be  0.6 
mg/kg/day.  
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic  analysis  showed  animals  were  exposed  to  aclidinium  bromide  and  its  major  alcohol  and 
acid  metabolites,  LAS34823  and  LAS34850,  following  administration  via  the  inhalation,  intravenous, 
oral  and  subcutaneous  routes.  In  general,  exposures  (Cmax  and  AUC)  to  aclidinium  bromide  and  the 
alcohol metabolite LAS34823 were similar, irrespective of administration route, but the main circulating 
metabolite was LAS34850. 
For comparison with the exposures in the pivotal toxicity studies, the AUC value for aclidinium bromide 
from study M/34273/09 in male COPD patients following a single daily dose of 400 μg for 3 days was 
extrapolated  to represent  clinical dosage of 400 μg  BID. Higher single inhaled doses (up  to 6000 μg) 
Eklira Genuair 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169578/2012 
Page 18/72
 
 
were given to healthy volunteers, but the only study in which the intended clinical dose of 400 μg twice 
daily  was  administered  was  in  LAS-PK-12,  in  which,  in  healthy  male  subjects,  the  Cmax  was 
0.248 ng/mL and the AUC was 1.004 ng.h/mL. Consequently if these values are used rather than the 
extrapolated  values  from  the  study  (M/34273/09)  in  young  and  elderly  COPD  patients  (Cmax 
0.077 ng/mL  and  AUC  0.392  ng.h/mL),  the  safety  margins  will  be  lower.  Furthermore,  the  patient 
study M/34273/09 was a 3-day study, whereas LAS-PK-12 was a 7-day study, where it is more likely 
that steady state will have been reached. Nevertheless, the exposure margins would still be acceptable 
if these higher values were used for the calculations. 
Safety  margins  for  metabolites  LAS34823  and  LAS34850  based  on  Cmax  and  AUC  for  all  pivotal 
toxicity studies in general are very large, except for the 26-week inhalation toxicity study in rats based 
on AUC, where these are below 1 for both metabolites owing to the low NOAEL value in this species. 
However,  the  systemic  safety  of  LAS34823  and  LAS34850  was  confirmed  in  oral  and  intravenous 
toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  dogs,  where  higher  NOAEL  values  were  attained.  Additionally,  neither 
metabolite is pharmacologically active.  
Genotoxicity 
In  the  in  vitro  genotoxicity  studies  (Ames  test  and  the  mouse  lymphoma  forward  mutation  assay), 
results were either negative, equivocal or weakly positive and did not appear to have any relationship 
to  the  purity  of  the  batches  used.  Positive  findings  only  occurred  in  the  presence  of  S9  fraction  from 
Arochlor-1254 induced rat liver.  
In  the  Ames  test,  positive  findings  appeared  to  be  restricted  to  S.  typhimurium  strain  TA98  at  high 
concentrations of aclidinium bromide, and increases in revertants were around 2-fold, the criterion for 
a  positive  response.  In  the  mouse  lymphoma  forward  mutation  assays,  there  was  no  clear 
concentration-related response.  
Two in vivo studies were conducted, using different end-points and tissues. These were a mouse bone 
marrow  micronucleus  test  and  an  unscheduled  DNA  synthesis  (UDS)  assay  in  rat  liver.  In  the  mouse 
study,  oral  doses  up  to  2000  mg/kg  were  administered  and  in  the  rat  study,  SC  doses  of  8  and 
20 mg/kg were used; toxicokinetic data demonstrated systemic exposure at these doses. Both in vivo 
studies  were  negative.  At  the  top  dose  (2000  mg/kg)  in  the  mouse  study,  AUC(0-24)  was 
1776.5 ng.h.mL; this is 4532-fold the AUC of 0.392 ng.h/mL.  
The  potential  formation  of  reactive  metabolites  was  investigated  previously  in  an  in  vitro  metabolism 
and  covalent  protein  binding  study  in  human  liver  and  Aroclor  1254-induced  rat  liver  S9  fractions 
(B.34273.39), in which metabolism was similar in the two species and covalent protein binding was low 
(<0.15%) in all conditions assayed. However, the covalent protein binding was slightly higher for the 
samples incubated with Aroclor 1254-induced rat S9 liver fraction.  
The  overall  conclusion,  based  on  negative/equivocal/weak  positive  findings  in in  vitro  studies,  limited 
covalent  protein  binding  and  negative  in  vivo  studies  using  different  end  points  and  exposures  that 
were  3  orders  of  magnitude  greater  than  human  exposure,  combined  with  negative  carcinogenicity 
assay results, is that aclidinium bromide is not genotoxic. 
Carcinogenicity 
Two-year  carcinogenicity  studies  were  conducted  in  mice  and  rats  using  the  inhalation  route.  There 
were no treatment-related neoplastic findings in either species. Non-neoplastic changes in the mouse 
were  confined  to  the  nasal  cavities.  In  the  rat,  there  were  non-neoplastic  changes  in  the  lung, 
respiratory  tract  and  Harderian  gland,  and  some  deaths  related  to  the  pharmacology  of  aclidinium 
bromide,  as  seen  in  the  chronic  inhalation  toxicity  studies.  Toxicokinetic  analysis  demonstrated  that 
Eklira Genuair 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169578/2012 
Page 19/72
 
 
both  species  were  exposed  to  aclidinium  bromide  and  its  main  metabolites  and  at  the  high  doses  in 
both studies, which were considered to be the NOAELs (2.5 mg/kg/day in mice and 0.2 mg/kg/day in 
rats), exposure exceeded that in man following a therapeutic dose by at least 25-fold. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
In  an  inhalation  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  study  in  rats,  reductions  in  fertility 
parameters  (number  of  corpora  lutea  and  implantation  sites)  were  noted.  The  AUC  at  the  NOAEL  of 
0.4 mg/kg twice daily was 160-fold that in humans. Deaths in this study appeared to be related to the 
same pharmacological mechanism as in the repeated dose toxicity and carcinogenicity studies.  
Aclidinium bromide did not show teratogenic or embryotoxic effects in developmental toxicity studies in 
rats  and  rabbits  by  inhalation  at  doses  up  to  2.4  and  1.8  mg/kg  twice  daily,  respectively.  In  the  rat 
study, slight non-dose-related effects on fetal weight and ossification were observed in the treatment 
groups,  so  a  NOAEL  was  not  established  for  fetotoxicity.  In  a  rabbit  development  study  via  the  oral 
route  at  doses  up  to  600  mg/kg/day,  aclidinium  bromide  reduced  fetal  weights  at  300  and 
600 mg/kg/day, without any teratogenic effects. The AUC at the NOAEL of 150 mg/kg/day was 93-fold 
that in man. 
Reductions in food consumption in dams and body weight gain in dams and pups were observed in an 
inhalational  pre-  and  post-natal  development  study  in  the  rat  from  0.2  mg/kg/day.  Three 
developmental  indices  of  the  pups  showed  marginal  changes  at  2.4  mg/kg/day,  corresponding  with 
reduced pup weights. The NOEL for the F0 dams and the F1 offspring was 0.02 mg/kg/day. However, 
the NOAEL for reproductive capacity of the F1 animals was 2.4 mg/kg/day.  
Local Tolerance  
Aclidinium  bromide  was  non-irritating  to  skin  or  eyes  (producing  only  a  reversible  reddening  of  the 
conjunctivae) in primary irritation studies in rabbits. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Aclidinium  bromide  was  not  a  sensitiser  in  a  passive  cutaneous  anaphylaxis  (PCA)  test  in  rats,  by 
inhalation in guinea pigs or in a local lymph node assay in mice following dermal administration. 
Impurities 
The  drug  substance  specification  limits  a  number  of  impurities,  four  of  which  exceed  the  qualification 
threshold.  These  were  qualified  by  their  presence  in  batches  of  drug  substance  used  in  the  chronic 
toxicity and carcinogenicity studies, and in the case of quaternized 3-(R)-quinuclidinol (LAS34823) and 
dithienylglycolic acid (LAS34850), because they are the main alcohol and acid metabolites of aclidinium 
bromide.  Additional  non-genotoxic  impurities  are  limited  at  ≤  0.1%  and  therefore  do  not  require 
qualification. 
A  number  of  impurities  with  genotoxic  alerts  were  investigated  in  bacterial  reverse  mutation  studies. 
Three  of  these  were  negative  and  are  limited  in  the  drug  substance  specification  at  ≤  0.1%  (either 
named  or  within  ‘any  unspecified  impurity’).  Two  were  positive,  one  of  which,  1-bromo-3-phenoxy-
propane is limited to ≤ 200ppm and the other, bromo-propoxy-propyl derivative, was not named in the 
initial  drug  substance  specification  and  therefore  controlled  as  any  unspecified  impurity  (≤  0.1%). 
Although exposure to these compounds would be below the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) if 
Eklira Genuair 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169578/2012 
Page 20/72
 
 
they were present at their proposed limits (and therefore the limits are acceptable), given the positive 
Ames test for the bromo-propoxy-propyl derivative, this has now been added as a specified impurity in 
the drug substance specification and limited at ≤ 0.10%   
Bromopropoxyphenylpropyl derivatives (isomers) are not controlled in the drug substance specification 
but were reportedly present in one batch of aclidinium bromide that was manufactured using 1-bromo-
3-phenoxypropane from a supplier different from the one currently used. As these compounds have an 
alert for genotoxic potential and were present in the batch in which they were detected at 0.4%, which 
would  result  in  an  intake  greater  than  the  TTC,  the  applicant  provided  a  commitment  to  ensure  that 
the  absence  of  bromopropoxyphenylpropyl  derivatives  (isomers)  will  be  confirmed  if  a  different 
supplier of 1-bromo-3-phenoxypropane is used in the future.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In  vitro  and  in  vivo  pharmacology  studies  have  shown  aclidinium  bromide  to  be  a  long  acting, 
reversible M3 muscarinic receptor antagonist with a rapid onset of action. 
Secondary pharmacology studies showed little affinity for other receptor types or ion channels.   
Safety  pharmacology  studies  showed  that  aclidinium  bromide  may  have  a  lower  propensity  to  affect 
the urinary and gastrointestinal systems than either ipratropium bromide or tiotropium bromide. Minor 
changes  in  cardiovascular  parameters  occurred  at  concentrations  well  in  excess  of  expected 
therapeutic concentrations.

Metabolism  is  similar  across  species,  with  rapid  hydrolysis  to  its  main  alcohol  and  acid  metabolites, 
both  of  which  are  pharmacologically  inactive.  The  acid  metabolite  is  the  major  circulating  metabolite 
irrespective of route of administration. There would appear to be little propensity for pharmacokinetic 
drug-drug interactions. 
In toxicity studies, the findings generally reflect the exaggerated pharmacology of aclidinium bromide, 
such  as  dry  mouth,  reduced  salivation  and  tear  production.  The  lungs,  Harderian  glands  and  parotid 
glands  were  primary  target  organs.  Inhalation  studies  in  rats  led  to  a  number  of  deaths,  which  were 
further  investigated  in  repeated  inhalation  studies  and  other  mechanistic  studies.  These  studies 
suggest  that  the  deaths  were  likely  due  to  reduced  salivation  causing  gasping  and  choking  episodes, 
with difficulty swallowing leading to remnants of food in the larynx and oesophagus. 
Toxicokinetic  analysis  measured  aclidinium  bromide  and  its  main  acid  and  alcohol  metabolites,  and 
exposures at the NOAEL in the toxicology studies generally exceed the human exposure by at least one 
order of magnitude.   
In vitro genotoxicity studies showed some equivocal or weak positive results at high concentrations in 
the  presence  of  metabolic  activation,  but  two  in  vivo  studies  were  negative  and  there  were  no 
neoplastic findings in 2-year carcinogenicity studies and therefore aclidinium bromide is not considered 
to be genotoxic or carcinogenic. 
Reproductive  toxicity  studies  revealed  an  effect  on female  fertility  and  fetotoxicity,  not  teratogenic  in 
rats or rabbits.  
Aclidinium  bromide  is  not  a  sensitiser  and  was  non-irritant  in  local  tolerance  studies  in  rabbit  eye  or 
skin, although the inhalation studies did show some evidence of irritation in the nasal passages in rats.  
A series of studies was conducted to qualify impurities and these are appropriately limited in the drug 
substance specification. 
The environmental risk assessment showed that the use of the product is unlikely to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of aclidinium bromide have been 
adequately demonstrated.  Overall, the non-clinical programme does not highlight any safety concerns 
for the patient treated twice a day with inhalational therapeutic doses of aclidinium bromide 400 μg. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The  application  is  supported  by  data  from  clinical  studies  in  which  5447  COPD  patients  worldwide 
received at least one dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP). 
The  efficacy  of  aclidinium  bromide  BID  was  investigated  in  two  Phase  II  studies  (M/34273/23  and 
M/34273/29)  which  enabled  the  bronchodilatory  profile  of  aclidinium  bromide  at  steady-state  to  be 
benchmarked against that of tiotropium and formoterol. In addition, study M/34273/29 demonstrated 
the  dose-response  of  aclidinium  bromide.  The  Phase  III  clinical  development  programme  comprised 
three randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies which evaluated aclidinium bromide 400 μg 
and  200  μg  BID;  one  with  a  24-week  treatment  duration  (M/34273/34)  and  the  other  two  with  12-
week treatment durations (LAS-MD-33, LAS-MD-38 Part A). The study designs and target populations 
Eklira Genuair 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169578/2012 
Page 23/72
 
 
 
of  these  Phase  III  studies  were  similar  with  the  only  difference  between  the  studies,  other  than 
treatment duration, being the choice of secondary endpoints. 
The  claimed  and  final  approved  indication  was  the  maintenance  bronchodilator  treatment  to  relieve 
symptoms in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
National  Scientific  Advice  was  given  by  a  number  of  European  regulatory  agencies  related  to  the 
clinical development programme (QD as well as BID development).  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Four  clinical  studies  were  conducted  to  investigate  primarily  the  PK  of  inhaled  aclidinium  bromide  in 
healthy  subjects.  One  of  these  studies  was  a  single  ascending  dose  study  (M/34273/01),  two  were 
cross-over designs investigating single ascending doses (M/34273/05) or multiple doses administered 
once daily (M/34273/06) and one was a parallel group study to investigate multiple doses administered 
BID (LAS-PK-12). 
The  PK  of  multiple  QD  doses  of  inhaled  aclidinium  bromide  were  investigated  in  Study  M/34273/06, 
however  low  plasma  levels  of  aclidinium  bromide  relative  to  the  LLOQ  of  the  assay  hampered 
meaningful PK analysis in this study. 
In  addition  studies  M/34273/03  investigated  the  distribution  of  aclidinium  bromide  into  the  lungs, 
M/34273/04  was  a  mass  balance  study  following  an  intravenous  administration  of  [14C]  aclidinium 
bromide  in  healthy  volunteers  and  AML/10  investigated  the  extent  of  protein  binding  of  aclidinium 
bromide and its metabolites. 
One  study  was  conducted  in  patients  with  COPD,  Study  M34273/21,  a  randomised,  double  blind, 
placebo-controlled,  four  period  cross  over  study  of  3  ascending  doses  (100  μg,  300  μg  and  900  μg). 
This was primarily a study to investigate the pharmacodynamic effect of aclidinium bromide – a ‘proof-
of-concept’  study.  However,  PK/PD  relationships  were  not  investigated  as  plasma  levels  of  aclidinium 
bromide were below the LLOQ of the bioanalytical assay. 
A further study (M/34273/09), which was primarily conducted to investigate the effects of age on the 
PK of aclidinium bromide, does give some further information on the PK in the target population. 
Absorption  
Aclidinium  bromide  is  rapidly  absorbed  following  inhalation.  In  healthy  subjects,  C max  is  achieved 
approximately 5 minutes following inhalation. In COPD patients, Cmax is achieved approximately 10 to 
15 minutes post-dose. 
Aclidinium bromide plasma exposure increased with increasing single inhaled doses up to 4200 μg.  
Aclidinium bromide has a low absolute bioavailability of <5%. 
Distribution 
Following  iv  administration  the  mean  apparent  volume  of  distribution  during  the  terminal  phase  for 
aclidinium bromide appeared to increase with ascending dose from 200 to 400 μg from 140 to 302 L, 
respectively, although individual subject data at all dose levels were highly variable (M/34273/05). 
Differences were observed in the volume of distribution with different doses. The applicant concluded 
that these are more likely related to the highly variable results and the small number of subjects per 
dose  level  available  rather  than  changes  in  this  parameter  (CV’s  of  81%  [n=6]  and  79%  [n=4]  with 
the 200 and 400 μg iv doses, respectively). Following inhalation of aclidinium bromide, very high and 
aberrant  physiological  values  for  volume  of  distribution  (Vz/f)  were  observed,  reflecting  the  very  low 
bioavailability associated with this route of administration. 
A  scintigraphic  analysis  of  the  pulmonary  disposition  and  distribution  of  [99mTc]-radiolabelled 
aclidinium  bromide  demonstrated  that  30.11%  of  the  dose  is  deposited  in  the  lung  of  which  nearly 
10% only reaches the central region of the lung. 
The  inactive  metabolites  of  aclidinium  bromide  were  found  to  be  highly  protein  bound  with  the  acid 
metabolite  (LAS34850)  demonstrating  a  protein  binding  of  90%  and  the  alcohol  metabolite 
Eklira Genuair 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169578/2012 
Page 26/72
 
 
(LAS34823)  demonstrating  a  protein  binding  of  10%.  Protein  binding  of  parent  aclidinium  bromide 
could not be ascertained owing to the rapidity with which it is metabolised in plasma. 
Elimination 
The metabolism of aclidinium bromide was investigated following intravenous administration to human 
subjects.  Aclidinium  bromide  is  hydrolysed  in  plasma  to  two  molecules,  the  alcohol  metabolite 
(LAS34823)  and  the  acid  metabolite  (LAS34850)  because  aclidinium  bromide  is  an  ester.  In  vitro 
studies  demonstrated  that  the  metabolites  are  devoid  of  significant  affinity  on  any  receptors  studied, 
including  muscarinic  receptors.  Aclidinium  bromide  and  its  metabolites  were  inactive  when  tested 
against a panel of relevant enzymes (e.g. phosphodiesterase, monoaminoxidase A and B, ATPase and 
acetylcholinesterase). 
The  major  metabolite  is  LAS34850  which  has  a  plasma  concentration  about  100  times  that  of  the 
parent  compound  aclidinium  bromide.  LAS34823  appears  in  plasma  at  similar  concentrations  to 
aclidinium bromide. 
Aclidinium  bromide  is  rapidly  metabolised  in  plasma  so  that  only  0.1%  of  the  dose,  administered  by 
inhalation,  is  excreted  unchanged  in  the  urine.  The  metabolites  are  then  mainly  excreted  in  urine, 
some unchanged (30-50%) and the rest after further hydroxylation. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
From  the  data  from  two  studies  (M/34273/05  and  LAS-PK-12)  the  claims  that  aclidinium  bromide 
exhibits  dose  proportionality  and  time  independent  kinetics  were  considered  not  supported.  However 
the lack of adequate characterisation of aclidinium t1/2 is mitigated by the large portion of total AUC 
represented by the 0-12 h time interval. This was supported by the lack of evidence of accumulation in 
trough  concentrations  in  Study  LAS-PK-12  after  twice  daily  dosing  for  7  days,  albeit  in  healthy 
volunteers. 
The  applicant  presented  further  discussions  that,  with  a  further  review  of  the  data  in  Studies 
M/34273/05  and  LAS-PK-12,  were  sufficiently  reassuring  that  aclidinium  bromide  does  indeed  exhibit 
dose proportionality and time-independent kinetics. Therefore the CHMP concluded that a multiple dose 
study in renal patients would not be required. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Renal  impairment  may  affect  the  excretion  of  the  metabolites  and  this  has  been  investigated  in  a 
single  dose,  open  label,  clinical  trial  to  assess  the  pharmacokinetics  of  aclidinium  bromide  400  μg 
administered  by  inhalation  in  healthy  subjects  and  subjects  with  various  degrees  of  chronic  renal 
insufficiency (M/34273/08). 
The AUC (0-t) was similar across the groups of patients with mild to severe renal impairment and higher 
than  in  the  healthy  controls.  T½  and  the  elimination  rate  constant  (z)  tended  to  be  higher  in  the 
renally  impaired  groups  compared  to  healthy  individuals,  while  the  apparent  total  plasma  clearance 
(Cl/f) tended to be lower.   
A similar pattern was seen for the two metabolites but to a greater extent with the increase in T½ and 
z reaching statistical significance for LAS 34850. However as the metabolites are inactive the increase 
in exposure in patients with renal impairment is unlikely to be clinically relevant.  
Eklira Genuair 
CHMP assessment report

This  was  a  single  dose  study  in  accordance  with  Guidance  CHMP/EWP/225/02  which  states  that  a 
single dose study is sufficient when the drug exhibits linear and time independent pharmacokinetics. 
It  is  not  possible  from  these  results  to  assess  whether  there  would  be  accumulation  of  aclidinium 
bromide  following  multiple  dosing  but  as  aclidinium  bromide  exhibits  dose  proportionality  and  time 
independent  kinetics  then  the  proposal  not  to  recommend  a  dose  adjustment  for  renal  impairment  is 
supported.
Hepatic impairment 
Aclidinium bromide undergoes very rapid and complete clearance from the body as a consequence of 
both  chemical  and  enzymatic  hydrolytic  cleavage  primarily  by  plasma  esterases.  Hepatic  metabolism 
plays  a  very  minor  part  in  the  clearance  of  aclidinium  bromide  and,  therefore,  hepatic  dysfunction  is 
very unlikely to alter its PK. Consequently, a study to assess the influence of hepatic dysfunction on PK 
was considered unnecessary and has not been performed. 
Elderly 
A multiple dose, open-label, cross over (two period) study (M/34273/09) was conducted to assess the 
pharmacokinetics of aclidinium bromide at the then proposed therapeutic dose (200 μg QD) and twice 
this dose administered by inhalation, after single administration and at steady state. One objective of 
this study was to evaluate whether the pharmacokinetic behaviour of aclidinium bromide is affected by 
the age of the patients so eligible patients were randomised to two groups according to their age: 
 
Young patients aged 40 to 59 years. 
  Elderly patients aged ≥ 70 years. 
The  overall  exposure  of  the  ‘old’  age  group  was  not  increased  compared  to  the  ‘young’  age  group  at 
the dose levels investigated. 
Exposure to the acid metabolite LAS34850 was generally higher in the elderly compared to the young 
ss for both doses and higher Cmax on Day 3 for the 
age group as evidenced by a higher AUCt and AUCt
200  μg  dose  and  Days  1  and  3  for  the  400  μg  dose.  A  similar  pattern  was  seen  for  the  PK  of  the 
alcohol  metabolite  LAS34823.  Although  these  differences  reached  statistical  significance  they  are 
unlikely to be clinically relevant as the metabolites of aclidinium bromide are inactive. 
Gender and race 
No  specific  analyses  of  pharmacokinetics  according  to  gender  and  race  and  no  specific  studies  to 
explore  the  effects  of  gender  and  race  were  conducted.  In  the  pivotal  efficacy  studies  there  was  a 
higher  proportion  of  males  in  study  M/34273/34  (67%)  compared  to  studies  LAS-MD-33  (53%)  and 
LAS-MD-38 Part A (53%)  and the majority of patients in the pivotal studies were Caucasian (91% to 
95%).  There  were  minor  differences  in  the  racial  profile  between  studies  due  to  their  conduct  in 
different geographical regions. 
Aclidinium  bromide  is  only  minimally  absorbed  into  the  systemic  circulation  (probably  <5%)  so  any 
pharmacokinetic  variations  according  to  race  and  gender  are  unlikely  to  give  clinically  meaningful 
changes to the pharmacokinetics of the drug. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
From  the  known  metabolism  of  aclidinium  bromide  and  the  results  of  in  vitro  studies  it  can  be 
concluded  that  the  probability  of  pharmacokinetic  interactions  with  other  drugs  is  low.  The  systemic 
Eklira Genuair

Page 28/72
 
 
absorption  of  aclidinium  bromide  is  very  low  and  aclidinium  bromide  is  rapidly  metabolised  to  its 
inactive  metabolites  LAS34823  and  LAS34850.  As  aclidinium  bromide  is  metabolised  by  esterases  in 
the plasma and any unchanged aclidinium bromide and its metabolites are largely excreted in the urine 
interaction with drugs metabolised through the CYP450 isoenzyme system is unlikely. This conclusion 
is supported by in vitro data. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Aclidinium  bromide  is  a  long-acting,  inhaled  anticholinergic  agent  which  has  strong  affinity  and 
selectivity for all muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1-M5) and kinetic selectivity for the M3 receptor over 
the  M2  receptor.  Inhaled  aclidinium  bromide  inhibited  acetylcholine-induced  bronchoconstriction  in 
anesthetised  guinea-pigs,  with  a  duration  of  action  (expressed  as  the  half-life  for  the  bronchodilatory 
effect) of 29 hours.  
Primary pharmacology 
A  study  (M/34273/00)  was  conducted  to  investigate  the  bronchodilatory  activity,  tolerability  and 
pharmacokinetics  of  single  ascending  doses  50,  300  and  600  μg  of  aclidinium  bromide  in  healthy 
subjects.  Measures  of  pharmacodynamic  activity  evaluated  included  specific  airway  conductance 
(sGaw), airway resistance (Raw) and the ability of aclidinium bromide to reduce methacholine-induced 
bronchoconstriction (PC35). The results were consistent across the parameters measured, showing an 
improvement  of  all  the  doses  of  aclidinium  bromide  studied  compared  to  placebo.  However  only  the 
300  μg  and  600  μg  doses  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  improvement  over  placebo  for  all 
three  parameters.  There  was  no  statistically  significant  improvement  seen  between  the  300  μg  dose 
and the 600 μg dose suggesting that the effect plateaus at this dose level. 
A  further  study  (M/34273/21)  assessed  the  tolerability,  pharmacodynamics  and  pharmacokinetics  of 
aclidinium  bromide  administered  by  inhalation  in  male  patients  with  Chronic  Obstructive  Pulmonary 
Disease  (COPD).  A  total  of  17  subjects  (16  planned),  aged  48  to  71  years,  with  stable  moderate  to 
severe  COPD  (according  to  criteria  of  American  Thoracic  Society)  and  a  significant  response  to 
ipratropium  bromide,  were  randomly  allocated  to  one  of  four  treatment  sequences.  Each  sequence 
required  subjects  to  receive  a  single  dose  of  aclidinium  bromide  (100,  300  and  900  μg),  in  an 
ascending manner, and placebo. All three doses of aclidinium bromide improved the normalised FEV1 
AUC(0-24)  and  there  was  little  difference  between  the  doses.  However  there  appeared  to  be  a  clear 
dose relationship to the mean of change from baseline of normalised FEV1 AUC (0-24) and all three doses 
demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement.  
From  these  results  the  applicant  decided  that  a  once  daily  dose  would  be  effective  over  the  full  24 
hours.  However  in  two  Phase  III  studies  investigating  200  μg  QD  it  was  found  that  trough  FEV1  was 
lower than the 100ml considered to be clinically relevant. A further study also demonstrated that the 
effect did not last the full 24 hours so the applicant considered it necessary to investigate a BID dosing 
regimen.  Doses  of  200  μg  BID  and  400  μg  BID  were  carried  forward  into  a  second  Phase  III 
development programme. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Aclidinium  bromide,  as  an  anticholinergic,  would  be  expected  to  cause  anticholinergic  adverse  effects 
such  as  dry  mouth,  pharyngitis,  blurred  vision,  GI  motility  problems  such  as  constipation,  urinary 
retention and tachycardia.

These  adverse  reactions  have  been  reported  in  the clinical  studies.  Also  monitoring  of  vital  signs  and 
ECGs was conducted in PK/PD studies and there was no evidence of clinically relevant abnormalities in 
these parameters. 
A  thorough  QT  study  was  conducted  in  the  early development  of  aclidinium  bromide  but  investigated 
only  doses  of  200  μg  and  800  μg  QD  administered  by  inhalation  over  3  days.  Moxifloxacin  was 
administered as control. 
On day 1, the greatest (placebo-corrected) positive difference in QTc interval observed were 2.5 msec 
at 15 mins in subjects treated with aclidinium bromide 200 μg (95% CI, -0.9, 5.8msec) and 2.1 msec 
at 2 hours in subjects treated with aclidinium bromide 800 μg (95%CI, -1.2, 5.4 msec).  
Similarly on Day 3 , the greatest (placebo-corrected) positive difference in QTc interval observed were 
3.3 msec in subjects treated with aclidinium bromide 200 μg (95% CI, -0.4, 6.9 msec) and 2.0 msec in 
subjects treated with aclidinium bromide 800 μg (95%CI, -1.6, 5.6 msec). 
Figure 1: Mean change in QTc interval from Time-Matched Baseline to Day 1 and Day 3 
Subjects  receiving  moxifloxacin  showed  a  statistically  significant  increase  in  mean  time-matched  QTc 
at all time points compared to placebo. These ranged from 4.2 msec (at 23.5 hours) to 15.2 msec (at 
2 hours) with the exception of 5 minutes post-dose on Days 1 and 3 (-2.6 and 2.6 msec respectively) 
and 15 minutes post-dose on Day 1 (2.8 msec). 
No  significant  changes  were  observed  in  any  other  parameters  (heart  rate,  supraventricular  and 
ventricular  ectopics,  time  on  atrial  fibrillation  and  number  of  pauses  [RR  >  2  msec])  of  the  12-lead 
ECG or the 24-hour Holter monitoring with either dose of aclidinium bromide compared with placebo. 
The results were reassuring regarding the potential for aclidinium bromide to prolong the QTc interval, 
although the doses studied are low compared to the proposed dose of 400 μg BID. 
Further monitoring of cardiovascular parameters was conducted in the Phase III studies.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  pharmacokinetic  data  are  limited  by  a  high  LLOQ  in  the  earlier  studies.  However  the  studies 
performed  demonstrated  that  about  30%  of  the  dose  of  aclidinium  bromide  is  deposited  in  the  lungs 
from where it is absorbed into the systemic circulation.  
Aclidinium bromide has a low absolute bioavailability of <5% and is rapidly cleared from the systemic 
circulation  by  metabolism  to  two  inactive  metabolites,  an  alcohol  metabolite  LAS43823  and  an  acid 
metabolite LAS34850. 
Unchanged aclidinium bromide (<1% of the dose) is excreted in the urine as is the major part of the 
two metabolites, either unchanged or after further metabolism by hydrolysis. 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  single  doses  of  aclidinium  bromide  and  its  metabolites  were  investigated  in 
renally impaired patients and no clinically relevant increase in exposure was demonstrated. Therefore 
it can be concluded that no dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment. 
As  hepatic  metabolism  plays  a  very  minor  part  in  the  metabolism  of  aclidinium  bromide 
pharmacokinetic data were not generated in patients with hepatic impairment and no dose adjustment 
was proposed. This was accepted by the CHMP. 
The  mechanism  of  action  of  aclidinium  bromide  was  investigated  in  vitro  and  it  was  found  to  act  by 
inhibiting acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction. 
The data on pharmacodynamic effects in humans, particularly in the patient population with COPD are 
limited but a dose response effect was demonstrated over the range of single doses of 100 μg to 900 
μg in patients with COPD. 
The  initial  development  was  for  a  once  daily  dose  of  aclidinium  bromide  hence  most  of  the 
pharmacodynamic  studies  were  concerned  with  single  or  once  daily  dosing  and  there  are  no  data  on 
twice  daily  dosing.  However  these  preliminary  results  have  been  superseded  by  the  Phase  III  clinical 
development studies. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
An adequate number of studies was conducted to characterise the clinical pharmacology of aclidinium 
bromide. There are some limitations to the data; pharmacokinetic data were limited by a high LLOQ in 
the earlier studies but concerns regarding the lack of adequate characterisation of aclidinium t1/2 were 
mitigated by the large portion of total AUC represented by the 0-12 h time interval. This was supported 
by the lack of evidence of accumulation in trough concentrations in Study LAS-PK-12 after twice daily 
dosing for 7 days, albeit in healthy volunteers. 
Therefore the claim of dose proportionality and time-independent kinetics was accepted and a further 
study in patients with renal impairment at steady state was not considered to be required. 
There  were  also  limited  pharmacodynamic  data  in  the  target  population  of  patients  with  moderate  to 
severe COPD but this was superseded by clinical data in Phase III studies. 
The very limited data on the safety in different races other than Caucasians was noted by the CHMP. 
However, this was adequately addressed in the RMP as important missing information.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Dose-finding studies 
Prior  to  the  conduct  of  the  clinical  development  programme  of  aclidinium  bromide  BID,  a  clinical 
development programme of aclidinium bromide administered once daily (QD) was conducted. Following 
completion of a dose-finding study of aclidinium bromide QD (M/34273/22), the efficacy and safety of 
aclidinium bromide 200 μg QD was investigated in two pivotal studies (M/34273/30 and M/34273/31), 
and  three  efficacy  profiling  studies  (M/34273/24,  M/34273/25,  LAS-MD-26).  Studies  M/34273/30, 
M/34273/31 and M/34273/25 indicated that the 24-hour bronchodilator efficacy of aclidinium bromide 
200 μg QD was suboptimal in terms of effect size and duration of effect.  
In  a  dose-finding  trial  of  repeated  once  daily  administration  by  inhalation  of  aclidinium  bromide, 
matching placebo, or tiotropium bromide in patients with moderate to severe stable COPD, the primary 
efficacy  variable  in  this  study,  trough  FEV1  at  visit  4,  demonstrated  a  statistically  and  clinically 
significant improvement over placebo for the 200 μg and 400 μg doses of aclidinium bromide. The 200 
μg  dose  demonstrated  a  greater  improvement  than  the  400  μg  dose  and  the  improvement  was  of  a 
similar order to that seen with tiotropium. The applicant concluded that the 400 μg dose conferred no 
further advantage over the 200 μg dose and therefore that the 200 μg dose would have the optimum 
benefit/risk balance. 
A  multiple  dose,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  3  period  cross-over,  placebo  controlled  clinical  study 
(M/34273/25)  to  assess  whether  the  time  of  dosing  (a.m.  or  p.m.)  at  steady  state  influences  the 
bronchodilator  response  of  aclidinium  bromide  compared  with  placebo  in  patients  with  moderate  to 
severe COPD was also conducted in the early development. Although the trough FEV1 values obtained 
after  6  days  treatment  were  higher  than  those  seen  with  placebo  they  did  not  reach  a  clinically 
relevant difference compared to placebo (46ml for the 200 μg a.m. dose and 37ml for the 200 μg p.m. 
dose). On the basis of the results of these studies the applicant decided to continue the development 
of aclidinium bromide with a focus on a twice daily dose regimen and also to evaluation higher doses. 
2.5.2.  Main studies  
Study M/34273/34: Efficacy and safety of aclidinium bromide at two dose levels vs placebo 
when administered to patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD)   
Methods 
Study Participants 
The main inclusion criteria were 
 
Patients with a clinical diagnosis of stable moderate to severe COPD, according to the GOLD 
guidelines and stable airway obstruction. Post-salbutamol FEV1/forced vital capacity 
(FVC)<70% at Screening Visit (Visit 1).  
 
Patients whose FEV1 at Screening Visit measured between 10 to 15 minutes post inhalation of 
400 μg of salbutamol, was ≥30% and <80% of the predicted normal value.  
  Current or former cigarette smokers with a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years.

The main exclusion criteria included history or current diagnosis of asthma, any respiratory tract 
infection (including the upper respiratory tract) or COPD exacerbation in the 6 weeks before the 
Screening Visit (Visit 1), and patients who were hospitalised for an acute COPD exacerbation within 3 
months prior to the Screening Visit. 
Treatments 
Following  a  run-in  period  of  approximately  14  days  eligible  patients  were  randomised  by  IVRS  in  a 
1:1:1 ratio to receive either 200 mcg or 400 mcg of aclidinium bromide or placebo administered twice 
daily  using  a  multidose  dry  powder  inhaler  (Genuair)  for  24  weeks.    Relief  medication  (salbutamol 
pMDI 100 mcg/puff) was provided to all patients for use as needed throughout the study. 
Efficacy and safety of aclidinium bromide at two dose levels vs placebo when administered to patients 
with  moderate  to  severe  COPD  was  realized  in  a  prospective,  randomised,  parallel  group,  placebo-
controlled, double-blind, multinational and multicentre, clinical study of repeated BID administration of 
inhaled  aclidinium  bromide  (200  μg  or  400  μg)  or  matching  placebo  in  patients  with  moderate  to 
severe stable COPD. At Visit 2, patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the following double-
blind treatments during a 24-Week treatment period:  
  Aclidinium  bromide  200  μg  BID  (once  in  the  morning  and  once  in  the  evening),  administered  via 
the Genuair inhaler  
  Aclidinium  bromide  400  μg  BID  (once  in  the  morning  and  once  in  the  evening),  administered  via 
the Genuair inhaler  
 
Placebo to match aclidinium bromide BID, administered via the Genuair inhaler. 
Objectives 
Efficacy related study objectives were: 
1.  to assess the long term bronchodilator efficacy of inhaled aclidinium bromide 200 mcg and 400 
mcg both administered twice daily, compared to placebo in COPD patients; 
2.  to  assess  the  benefits  of  aclidinium  bromide  200  mcg  and  400  mcg  both  administered  twice 
daily,  compared  to  placebo  in  disease-related  health  status,  COPD  symptoms  and  COPD 
exacerbations. 
Efficacy  was  assessed  by  bronchodilation  tests,  COPD  symptoms  and  exacerbations,  health  related 
quality of life (QoL), amount of relief medication required and evaluation of treatment compliance. For 
a subgroup of 20% of patients at selected sites, 12 hour post-dose serial spirometry (FEV 1 and FVC) 
was performed; inspiratory capacity (IC) was measured 12 hours post-dose.   
The  safety  related  study  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  long  term  safety  and  tolerability  of  inhaled 
aclidinium  bromide  200  μg  and  400  μg,  both  administered  BID,  compared  to  placebo  in  the  same 
target population. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoints was change from baseline in morning pre-dose FEV1. 
Key secondary endpoints were change from baseline in peak FEV1, TDI focal score, SGRQ total score, 
and exacerbations.

Sample size 
A  total  of  1,250  patients  were  planned  to  be  screened  to  achieve  a  total  number  of  810  randomised 
patients;  that  is  270  patients  to  each  of  three  treatment  groups.  Screened:  1061;  randomised:  828; 
completed  study:  736;  completed  treatment:  737  Evaluated  for  safety:  819;  evaluated  for  efficacy 
(Intent-to-Treat  [ITT]  analysis):  819;  evaluated  for  efficacy  (Per  Protocol  [PP]  analysis):  759; 
evaluated for efficacy (serial spirometry sub-study): 191. 
Randomisation 
The study was realized as a prospective, randomised, parallel group, placebo-controlled, double-blind.  
Blinding (masking) 
Study personnel and study patients were blinded as to whether the patient was using aclidinium 
bromide or placebo. The Genuair inhalers containing aclidinium bromide and those containing placebo 
were of the same external appearance to ensure the double-blind nature of the study.  
Statistical methods 
All  statistical  comparisons  were  two-sided  with  the  significance  level  set  at  0.05.  All  confidence 
intervals (CIs) were two-sided 95%. 
In  total  five  analysis  populations  were  defined  including  the  following  two  populations  for  analysis  of 
efficacy: 
 
intent-to-treat (ITT) population: all randomised patients who took at least one dose of study 
medication with both a baseline and at least one post-baseline FEV1 assessment; 
 
per-protocol (PP) population: a subset of the ITT population made up of those patients who: 
a) met all inclusion/exclusion criteria liable to affect the efficacy assessment; 
b) attained a sufficient compliance to the treatment received; 
c) did not present serious deviations of the protocol that might affect efficacy. 
Patients were assigned to these populations according to the specified definitions at a blind data review 
meeting  before  the  randomisation  codes  were  broken.  All  efficacy  analyses  were  based  on  the  ITT 
population  except  for  COPD  exacerbations  which  were  reported  for  the  ITT  population  and  also  the 
safety population. In addition the primary and three secondary efficacy parameters were analysed for 
the PP population. 
Missing data for spirometric efficacy analysis were addressed using the last observation carried forward 
(LOCF) approach.  In addition linear interpolation was used where one or more planned value(s) were 
missing  between  a  pair  of  non-missing  values.    Data  collected  on  a  daily  diary  were  summarised  at 
each visit without any imputation and also using the LOCF approach.  For all variables where a baseline 
value  was  computed,  the  LOCF  approach  was  used  to  impute  the  baseline  value  to  the  first  post-
baseline value if missing. 
The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in morning pre-dose FEV1 at Week 24 for 
the  European  filing.    This  was  analysed  by  means  of  an  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  model  with 
treatment and sex as factors and baseline and age as covariates.   
The primary treatment comparisons were: 
Eklira Genuair 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169578/2012 
Page 34/72
 
 
aclidinium bromide 200 mcg versus placebo 
aclidinium bromide 400 mcg versus placebo. 
In addition the following comparison was considered: 
aclidinium bromide 200 mcg/aclidinium bromide 400 mcg versus placebo. 
Adjustment for multiplicity of testing more than one dose was performed using Hochberg’s method. 
A  sensitivity  analysis  for  the  primary  efficacy  parameter  was  carried  out  using  a  direct  likelihood 
approach on the ITT population to assess the effect of missing data on the results of morning pre-dose 
FEV 1 in which case no imputation was performed.  This analysis was conducted using a mixed model 
for repeated measures (MMRM) of change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 with age and baseline value 
as covariates, and treatment, sex, week and treatment-by-week interaction as fixed effects.  A similar 
method for adjustment for multiplicity was used. 
The following secondary efficacy variables were analysed: 
1.  change from baseline in peak FEV 1 at Week 24 where peak FEV1 was the highest FEV 1 value 
observed in the 3-hour period immediately after morning dosing (using the same model as for 
the primary efficacy variable); 
2.  percentage  of  patients  achieving  a  clinically  meaningful  improvement  (>  1  unit)  in  Transition 
Dyspnoea Index (TDI) focal score at Week 24; 
3.  percentage of patients achieving a clinically meaningful improvement (> 4 units) compared to 
baseline in the St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at Week 24. 
The second and third variables were analysed using a logistic regression model. 
A sequential procedure was used to adjust for multiplicity by testing the primary and three secondary 
variables  in  this  pre-specified  order:  the  primary  variable  followed  by  the  secondary  variables  in 
numerical order. 
The  comparison  of  the  two  doses,  aclidinium  bromide  400  mcg  versus  aclidinium  bromide  200  mcg, 
was reported although no adjustment for multiple testing was made for this comparison. 
The analyses of the primary and all three secondary endpoints at 12 weeks were also conducted to be 
included in the US submission. 
The  sample  size  of  244  evaluable  patients  was  estimated  to  provide  at  least  90%  power  to  detect  a 
difference  of  90mL  in  the  primary  endpoint  allowing  for  adjustment  for  multiple  comparisons  at  the 
overall significance level of 0.05.

Baseline data 
The treatment groups were comparable with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics. The 
mean age was 62.0, 62.3, and 62.9 years in the placebo, and aclidinium bromide 200 μg and 400 μg 
groups, respectively. There were some differences in the age distribution of patients between the three 
treatment  groups.  In  the  aclidinium  bromide  400  μg  group,  a  slightly  higher  percentage  of  patients

were  70  years  and  over,  and  a  slightly  lower  percentage  of  patients  were  between  60  and  70  years, 
compared  to  the  placebo  and  aclidinium  bromide  200  μg  groups.  In  all  treatment  groups,  a  higher 
percentage of male patients compared to female patients were enrolled; 69.2%, 65.3% and 67.7% in 
the placebo, and aclidinium bromide 200 μg and 400 μg groups, respectively. The majority of patients 
in all treatment groups were Caucasian (95.0 to 95.5%). The mean BMI was similar among treatment 
groups and ranged from 26.5 to 27.0 kg/m2. 
Smoking history (current and ex-smokers) was evenly distributed across the groups as was the mean 
duration  of  smoking  in  years.  However  the  smoking  consumption  (pack-years)  increased  across  the 
groups  from  placebo  to  400mcg  BID;  [Mean  (SD):  Placebo;  38.9  (18.3)  aclidinium  bromide  200mcg 
BID; 40.0 (19.8) aclidinium bromide 400mcg BID; 41.7 (21.1)]. 
Numbers analysed 
A  total  of  828  patients  were  randomised  into  the  study  with  approximately  10%  discontinuing 
prematurely, 14.9% in the placebo group, and 8.6% and 6.3% for the 200 mcg and 400mcg doses of 
aclidinium respectively.  Although reasons for discontinuation were fairly comparable across treatment 
groups,  a  higher  percentage  discontinued  from  the  placebo  group  because  of  lack  of  efficacy.    Full 
details are provided in the table below. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was “change from baseline in morning pre-dose FEV1 at Week 24 for the 
ITT  population”. The following plot of change from baseline in morning pre-dose FEV1 over 24 weeks 
shows  a  greater  improvement  in  this  endpoint  in  both  aclidinium  bromide  dose  groups  compared  to 
placebo which was consistently higher for the 400 mcg dose than for the 200 mcg dose.

The results of the analysis of the primary endpoint, change from baseline in morning pre-dose FEV1 at 
Week  24  for  the  ITT  population,  are  presented  in  the  table  below.    A  statistically  significant  greater 
adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  at  Week  24  was  observed  for  both  doses  compared  to  placebo 
with an estimated difference of 99 mL for aclidinium bromide 200 mcg and 128 mL for 400 mcg.  No 
statistically significant difference between doses was achieved.

Similar findings were observed using the MMRM analysis with estimated treatment differences after 24 
weeks  of  103mL  and  133mL  for  the  lower  and  higher  doses  respectively  when  compared  to  placebo 
(p<0.0001 for both).  Consistent results were demonstrated by the analysis of the PP population with a 
difference  of  106  mL  between  aclidinium  200  mcg  and  placebo  and  133  mL  between  aclidinium  400 
mcg and placebo (p<0.0001 for both). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Change from baseline in peak FEV 1 
The results for the analysis of change from baseline in peak FEV1 at Week 24 for the ITT population 
are presented in the table below. 
As  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  both  doses  were  statistically  superior  to  placebo  in  terms  of  this 
endpoint  with  estimated  treatment  differences  of 185  mL  and  209  mL  for  the  200  mcg  and  400  mcg 
doses  respectively  compared  with  placebo  (p<0.0001  for  both).    As  before  no  statistically  significant 
difference was seen between the two doses. 
TDI focal score 
The results of the analysis of the percentage of patients achieving a clinically relevant improvement 
(>1 unit) in TDI at 24 weeks are presented in the table below.

At  Week  24  significantly  more  patients  had  clinically  relevant  improvement  in  this  score  in  both  the 
aclidinium bromide groups compared to placebo. Statistically significant odds ratios were demonstrated 
for both doses compared to placebo.

The  results  of  the  exploratory  analysis  of  the  change  from  baseline  in  TDI  focal  score  using  the  pre-
specified ANCOVA model are provided in the following table. 
At  Week  24  compared  to  placebo  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  in  TDI  focal  score  was 
statistically significantly greater for both doses of aclidinium bromide although the estimated difference 
was clinically relevant (>1 unit) only for the 400 mcg dose. 
SGRQ total score 
The results of the analysis of the percentage of patients achieving a clinically relevant improvement 
(>4 units) compared to baseline are presented in the table below.

At  Week  24  significantly  more  patients  had  a  clinically  relevant  improvement  in  SGRQ  total  score  for 
both doses compared to placebo.  Statistically significant odds ratios were demonstrated for both doses 
compared to placebo. 
The results of the exploratory analysis of the change from baseline in SGQR total score using the pre-

At  Week  24  compared  to  placebo  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  in  SGRQ  total  score  was 
statistically significantly greater for both doses of aclidinium bromide although the estimated difference 
was clinically relevant (>4 units) only for the 400 mcg dose. 
Exacerbations 
COPD Exacerbations based on Health Resource Utilisation (eCRF): A numerically smaller percentage of 
patients  experienced  at  least  one  COPD  exacerbation  (mild,  moderate,  or  severe)  in  the  aclidinium 
bromide  200  μg  group  (15.9%)  and  in  the  aclidinium  bromide  400  μg  group  (14.1%)  than  in  the 
placebo  group  (20.5%).  Compared  to  placebo,  the  percent  reduction 
in  odds  was  27% 
(p-value=0.1676)  and  36%  (p-value=0.0513)  for  the  aclidinium  bromide  200  μg  and  400  μg  doses, 
respectively.  
When assessed as exacerbation rates per patient-year, the percent reduction was approximately 30% 
(p-value<0.05 for both doses).  
A  numerically  smaller  percentage  of  patients  experienced  at  least  one  moderate  or  severe  COPD 
exacerbation  in  the  aclidinium  bromide  200  μg  group  (13.0%)  and  aclidinium  bromide  400  μg  group 
(12.3%) than in the placebo group (16.1%). Compared to placebo, the percent reduction in odds was 
22% (p-value=0.3173) and 27% (p-value=0.2063) in the 200 μg and 400 μg dose, respectively.  
When  assessed  as  exacerbation  rates  per  patient-year,  the  percent  reduction  was  26% 
(p-value=0.0845) and 28% (p-value=0.0629) for the 200 μg and 400 μg dose, respectively.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
As  the  duration  of  treatment  in  the  two  studies,  LAS-MD-33  and  LAS-MD-38  Part  A,  was  12  weeks, 
they  are  not  considered  to  be  pivotal  studies  but  provide  only  supportive  evidence  of  efficacy. 
Therefore  study  M/34273/34  with  24  weeks  duration  is  considered  to  be  the  single  pivotal  study.  In 
view  of  the  differences  in  treatment  length  pooling  the  studies  is  not  felt  to  add  value  statistically 
especially in the case of the TDI and SGRQ scores where 12 months treatment is probably at the lower 
limit required for appropriate use of these measures.

Clinical studies in special populations 
• 
Gender 
The pharmacokinetics of inhaled aclidinium bromide 200 μg or 400 μg QD for 3 days were investigated 
in moderate to severe COPD patients aged 40 to 59 years and aged 70 years and over (M/34273/09). 
Aclidinium  bromide  was  rapidly  absorbed  in  both  age  groups  with  a  median  time  to  peak  plasma 
concentrations  of  10-15  minutes  for both  age  groups.  No  differences  in  aclidinium  systemic  exposure 
(based  on  Cmax  and  AUC)  were  observed  between  age  groups.  Therefore,  no  dose  adjustment  was 
considered necessary for elderly COPD patients.  
• 
Elderly 
Study  M/34273/09  investigated  the  effect  of  age  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  multiple  QD  doses  of 
aclidinium  bromide.  The  Applicant  considered  that  the  results  of  this  study  support  registration  of 
aclidinium  bromide  400  μg  BID  based  on  the  observations  that  peak  plasma  concentrations  were 
similar after 7 days dosing with 400 μg BID to those observed after the first dose (study LAS-PK-12) 
and that the safety margins between human systemic exposure with 400 μg BID and the no observed 
adverse effect levels in non-clinical toxicity studies were 17- to 187-fold.  
No dose adjustments are required for elderly patients or for patients with hepatic or renal impairment. 
Elderly  patients  and  patients  with  hepatic  or  renal  impairment  can  use  aclidinium  bromide  at  the 
recommended dose. 
Supportive studies 
Supportive Phase III Studies 
There  were  two  randomised,  parallel  group,  placebo  controlled,  double-blind  studies  (LAS-MD-33  and 
LAS-MD-38  Part  A)  of  inhaled  aclidinium  bromide  compared  to  placebo  in  patients  with  moderate  to 
severe  stable  COPD.  As  the  duration  of  treatment  in  these  studies  was  12  weeks,  these  were  not 
considered to be pivotal studies but to provide only supportive evidence of efficacy.   
Following a run-in period of approximately 14 days eligible patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio 
to receive either 200 mcg or 400 mcg of aclidinium bromide or placebo administered twice daily using 
a multidose dry powder inhaler for 12 weeks. These studies were essentially the same as Pivotal Study 
M/34273/34  except  in  terms  of  the  shorter  duration  and  secondary  endpoints.  However  both  SGRQ 
and TDI scores were included as secondary variables. 
Results 
The primary endpoint was defined as change from baseline to Week 12 in morning pre-dose FEV1.

Note: p-value, LSM, and LSMD were obtained from an ANCOVA model with change from baseline in trough FEV1 
with treatment group and sex as factors and baseline FEV1 and age as covariates. 
ANCOVA = analysis of covariance; CI = confidence interval; FEV1 = forced expiratory volume in 1 second; 
ITT = intent to treat; LOCF = last observation carried forward; LSM = least squares mean; LSMD = least squares 
mean difference; max = maximum; min = minimum; N = ITT population size; n = number of patients at interval. 
In  Study  LAS-MD-33  the  estimated  treatment  difference  for  the  higher  dose  compared  to  placebo 
clearly achieved statistical significance at a clinically relevant level of at least 100 mL. However for the 
200  μg  dose,  although  the  estimated  difference  was  statistically  significant,  it  was  slightly  below  the 
size considered to be clinically important. For Study LAS-MD-38 although the estimated difference for 
both doses  was statistically significant, neither reached the clinically relevant level and the estimated 
differences were considerably smaller than those seen in the other study. 
Secondary endpoint 
Secondary endpoints in these studies included SGRQ and TDI. 
- SGRQ: although a statistically significant difference was found for each dose compared with placebo 
in  Study  LAS-MD-33,  neither  difference  reached  the  clinically  relevant  value  of  4  units  compared  to 
placebo.  In  the  second  study  both  doses  failed  to  achieve  statistical  significance  in  this  parameter. 
However  it  is  possible  that  the  12-week  treatment  duration  was  not  sufficient  to  identify  a  clinically 
important difference compared to placebo in terms of this score. 
-  TDI:  the  results  for  change  from  baseline  to  Week  12  in  the  TDI  score  were  similar  to  those  for 
SGRQ,  where  the  statistically  significant  difference  achieved  a  clinically  important  level  only  for  the 
higher dose in both studies.  
Study LAS-MD-26 
A further multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group study 
was  conducted  comparing  the  repeated  once-daily  administration  of  aclidinium  bromide  200  μg  by 
inhalation with placebo in patients diagnosed with moderate-to-severe stable COPD. The objective was 
to investigate the effect of inhaled aclidinium bromide 200 μg on exercise endurance time (ET) after 6 
weeks treatment.

This  study  lends  some  supporting  evidence  to  symptomatic  improvement  in  patients  with  COPD.  As 
dyspnoea  often  limits  COPD  patients’  every  day  activities,  an  improvement  in  exercise  tolerance  is 
desirable. This study, which was conducted with a dose of aclidinium bromide of only 200 μg QD, did 
show  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  endurance  time.  Despite  a  large  SD  in  the  baseline 
measurements the improvement over placebo in ET was more than 25% of the baseline value and is 
therefore likely to be perceived as an improvement by the patient. 
Phase II Studies 
Two  Phase  II  randomised,  double-blind,  double  dummy,  cross-over  studies  (M/34273/23  and 
M/34273/29) were conducted to investigate the effects of aclidinium bromide compared to placebo and 
compared to other bronchodilators used in the treatment of COPD. 
The  first  study  compared  aclidinium  bromide  400  μg  BID  to  18  μg  QD  of  tiotropium  and  the  second 
study  compared  two  doses  of  aclidinium  bromide,  200  μg  BID  and  400  μg  BID  to  12  μg  BID  of 
formoterol fumarate. 
Results of Study M/34273/23 
The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in normalised FEV1 AUC 0-12 (L) at Day 15 on 
treatment, shown in the table below: 
The findings of the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint indicate that, in terms of this lung function 
parameter,  aclidinium  bromide  400  mcg  twice  daily  was  superior  to  placebo.  Confirmation  of  the 
known efficacy of tiotropium compared to placebo endorsed the validity of the study results. However 
the lack of a statistically significant difference between aclidinium and tiotropium cannot be considered 
to demonstrate that the effects of the two treatments are the same although the estimated treatment 
difference between them, 23 mL in favour of tiotropium, would suggest that the effects in this endpoint 
are similar. 
Results of Study M/34273/29 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  change  from  baseline  in  normalised  FEV1  AUC0-12  (L)  at  Day  7  on 
treatment, as shown in the table below:

The findings of the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint indicate that, in terms of this lung function 
parameter,  all  doses  of  aclidinium  bromide  were  superior  to  placebo  and  above  the  clinically  relevant 
level  of  100ml.  Confirmation  of  the  known  efficacy  of  formoterol  compared  to  placebo  endorsed  the 
validity of the study results. The clear lack of statistical significance between aclidinium 400 mcg and 
formoterol 12 mcg with an estimated treatment difference of only 2 mL would suggest that the effect 
on the primary endpoint of these two treatments is similar.

Long-term  safety  studies,  LAS-MD-35  and  LAS-MD-36  were  conducted  in  the  US  and  Canada.  The 
studies  were  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel-group  studies  which  were  designed  primarily  to 
evaluate the safety of aclidinium bromide 400 μg and 200 μg BID, administered for up to 12-months. 
As  there  were  ethical  concerns  regarding  the  inclusion  of  placebo  control  groups  in  long-term  COPD 
clinical trials because of the increased risk of exacerbations in placebo-treated patients, neither study 
was  placebo-controlled.  Study  LAS-MD-36  was  an  extension  study  for  patients  who  participated  in 
pivotal study LAS-MD-33. Patients on aclidinium bromide in the lead-in study continued treatment with 
aclidinium bromide at the same dose in LAS-MD-36, while only those patients on placebo in the lead-in 
study were randomised to aclidinium bromide 400 μg or 200 μg. These data were difficult to interpret 
given the limited sample size and the method of patient enrollment, which was based on patients who

completed study LAS-MD-33 being given the option of continued treatment with aclidinium bromide in 
study LAS-MD-36.  
In contrast, in study LAS-MD-35 all patients were randomised to aclidinium bromide 400 μg or 200 μg 
at study commencement and, therefore, this study represented the more rigorous of the two long-term 
safety studies for the purposes of efficacy evaluation. 
Study LAS-MD-35 
Improvements  from  baseline in  bronchodilation were  observed  with  both  doses  of  aclidinium  bromide 
and maintained from Week 1 to Week 52. 
Figure 2 below shows the mean change from baseline in morning predose (trough) FEV1 at Weeks 1, 
12,  24,  36,  48,  and  52.  The  improvement  from  baseline  to  each  time  point  in  trough  FEV1  was 
observed  for  both  aclidinium  bromide  groups.  After  Week  24,  there  was  a  decline  in  trough  FEV1  in 
both  treatment  groups,  most  probably  due  to  the  natural  decline  in  FEV1  seen  in  COPD  patients.  As 
early  as  Week  1,  aclidinium  bromide  400  μg  exhibited  an  apparent  dose  separation  from  aclidinium 
bromide  200  μg  in  providing  a  numerically  greater  bronchodilator  response  that  was  sustained 
throughout the 52 weeks of the study.

Improvements in disease-related health status, as measured by the SGRQ Total score, were observed 
with  both  doses  of  aclidinium  bromide.  Changes  from  baseline  in  SGRQ  Total  score  to  all  timepoints 
from Week 12 to Week 52 were consistently greater than the 4-unit improvement threshold considered 
to be clinically significant.

Study LAS-MD-36 
Treatment  with  aclidinium  bromide  was  associated  with  long-term  bronchodilation  and  health-related 
quality  of  life  benefits  that  were  maintained  for  the  duration  of  the  active  treatment  period  for  all 
treatment  groups,  although  the  improvements  noted  in  the  treatment  group  that  switched  from 
placebo to aclidinium bromide 200 μg were less robust.   
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in morning pre-dose (trough) FEV1 at 
Week 64. 
The secondary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in peak FEV1 at Week 64. 
Additional efficacy endpoints included: 
  Change from baseline in morning pre-dose (trough) FEV1 and peak FEV1 by visit over 64 
weeks. 
  Change from baseline in SGRQ Total score by visit over 64 weeks.

An improvement from baseline to Week 64 in trough FEV1 was observed in the treatment groups which 
received  aclidinium  bromide  200  μg  or  400  μg  in  both  the  lead-in  and  extension  studies,  and  in  the 
group  which  commenced  treatment  on  placebo  and  switched  to  aclidinium  bromide  400  μg  for  the 
extension  study.  For  those  patients  who  were  randomised  to  the  placebo-aclidinium  bromide  200  μg 
treatment  sequence  trough  FEV1  was  maintained  between  Week  24  (first  timepoint  after 
commencement of active medication) and Week 36 but the effect declined substantially at Week 64.

In  support  of  this  application  the  applicant  submitted  one  pivotal  Phase  III  study  (M/34273/34)  and 
two supporting Phase III studies (LAS-MD-33 and LAS-MD-38 Part A). 
The overall study design of the pivotal study was appropriate with a treatment duration of 6 months as 
recommended  in  the  current  guideline  on  the  clinical  investigation  of  products  for  the  chronic 
treatment  of  patients  with  COPD  (CPMP/EWP/562/98).  The  two  supporting  studies  had  a  duration  of 
only 12 weeks. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were appropriate in the main clinical studies. 
The  design  of  the  studies  as  randomised,  parallel  group,  placebo  controlled  and  double-blind  was 
appropriate and the studies were conducted according to GCP. 
Overall the statistical methods were appropriate. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  findings  of  the  pivotal  study,  M/34273/34,  demonstrated  statistically  significant  improvement  for 
aclidinium bromide 400 mcg twice daily over placebo for the change from baseline in morning pre-dose 
FEV 1, and for changes from baseline in both the TDI focal score and the SGRQ total score, all after 24 
weeks  treatment.  Although  two  co-primary  endpoints,  one  investigating  lung  function  and  the  other 
symptoms,  had  not  been  pre-specified  as  recommended  in  the  above-mentioned  guideline,  all  three 
endpoints  did  demonstrate  superiority  over  placebo  at  a  pre-defined  clinically  relevant  level  with 
appropriate adjustment for multiple testing.  
The  results  of  the  two  further  Phase  III  studies,  LAS-MD-33  and  LAS-MD-38  Part  A,  provided  limited 
supportive  evidence  of  efficacy  as  treatment  duration  was  only  12  weeks  rather  than  24  weeks  as 
recommended  in  the  guideline.  Both  studies  showed  statistically  significant  improvement  for  both 
doses  compared  to  placebo  in  the  lung  function  parameter  and  the  TDI  score  although  not  always 
reaching  clinical  relevance.  However  for  the  SGRQ  total  score  a  significant  difference  was 
demonstrated  only  in  the  first  study  and  not  in  the  second.  It  is  possible  that  12  weeks  is  not 
sufficiently long treatment duration to demonstrate an improvement in this score in COPD patients. 
Additional  confirmation  of  efficacy  in  terms  of  lung  function  was  provided  by  two  Phase  II  cross-over 
studies, one comparing aclidinium bromide 400 μg twice daily with tiotropium 18 μg once daily and the 
other with formoterol 12 μg twice daily. Although neither study was designed to show equivalence or 
non-inferiority,  there  was  some  evidence  that  the  effect  of  this  dose  of  aclidinium  was  similar  to  the 
approved  doses  of  tiotropium  and  formoterol.  However  some  caution  should  be  used  in  the 
interpretation  of  the  results  of  these  studies  as  both  were  considered  exploratory  and  therefore  the 
statistical  methodology  was  not  as  exhaustive  as  required  for  confirmatory  Phase  III  studies  with  no 
adjustment for multiple testing and limited investigation of bias introduced by methods used to handle 
missing data. 
Two  long-term  safety  studies  were  also  conducted;  LAS-MD-35  and  LAS-MD-36.  In  these  two  long-
term studies it was demonstrated that the treatment effect of aclidinium bromide 400 μg BID seen in 
the  shorter  (6  month)  pivotal  study  is  maintained  for  up  to  52  weeks  with  little  deterioration.  Peak 
effects  were  seen  at  about  24  weeks  and  the  benefits  tend  to  tail  off  in  the  second  6  months.  It  is 
difficult  to  draw  firm  conclusions from these  studies  as  there  are  no  12-month  placebo  data  but  they 
demonstrated  that  the  benefit  of  aclidinium  bromide on  both  lung  function  parameters  and  quality  of 
life (SGRQ) that was seen in the pivotal trial is maintained over 52 weeks. 
The 200 μg BID dose of aclidinium bromide also demonstrated statistically significant improvement in 
FEV1,  TDI  and  SGRQ  in  Study  M/34273/34  although  the  results  did  not  always  reach  a  clinically 
relevant  level  compared  to  placebo.  In  the  study  with  active  comparator  formoterol  fumarate  12  μg 
BID  the  200  μg  BID  dose  of  aclidinium  bromide  demonstrated  less  efficacy  than  formoterol  fumarate

12  μg  BID  and  aclidinium  bromide  400  μg  BID  but  the  differences  in  normalised  FEV1(0-12)  were  not 
statistically  significant.  The  results  seen  at  6  months  were  also  maintained  through  52  weeks  in  the 
long-term safety studies at the dose of aclidinium bromide 200 μg BID. 
In  one  study  investigating  exercise  tolerance  a  dose  of  200  μg  QD  for  6  weeks  demonstrated  a 
statistically and probably clinically significant improvement. 
The lower dose of aclidinium bromide (200 μg BID) demonstrated an improvement that was generally 
statistically significant and often clinically relevant compared to baseline values but just failed to reach 
a  clinically  relevant  improvement  compared  to  placebo.  To  address  this  issue,  the  applicant  provided 
subgroup analyses for 200μg BID and 400μg BID on FEV1, TDI and SGRQ for patients with less severe 
disease that helped fully characterise the benefits of aclidinium bromide in various severities of COPD. 
From the analyses it was seen that the benefit of the 400 μg BID dose is greater even in the patients 
with  less  severe  COPD  although  patients  with  less  severe  COPD  did  report  a  greater  improvement  in 
QoL measures than patients with more severe COPD, achieving a clinically meaningful improvement in 
SGRQ  even  with  a  dose  of  200  μg  BID.  However  in  the  placebo-controlled  studies  lung  function 
parameters  showed  a  greater  improvement  in  the patients  with  more  severe  COPD,  perhaps  because 
there is more room for improvement in this group. 
Overall these results do not suggest that a dose of 200 μg BID of aclidinium bromide would be more 
beneficial to patients with less severe COPD than a dose of 400 μg BID given similar safety profiles. 
In the patients with no exacerbations in the previous year and therefore supposedly less severe COPD 
a greater improvement in lung function parameters were demonstrated in the pivotal study with similar 
improvements in SGRQ but a lesser benefit in TDI compared with the overall study population. In the 
non-placebo controlled studies the change from baseline was similar in the two study populations. 
In  the  group  with  no  exacerbations  in  the  previous  year,  the  patients  with  less  severe  COPD  (FEV1 
≥65% PN) did show a greater improvement in lung function parameters and a greater improvement in 
QoL measures. This group achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in trough FEV1, and SGRQ but 
not in TDI, even with a dose of 200 μg BID aclidinium bromide. The patients with more severe COPD 
(FEV1  50-65%  PN)  demonstrated  an  even  greater  improvement  in  lung  function  at  a  dose  of  200 μg 
BID but did not achieve a clinically meaningful improvement in SGRQ or TDI. 
It was noted that the number of patients other than Caucasians, who constituted 91-95% of the study 
population, was low. This was satisfactorily addressed in the RMPas important missing information. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  data  submitted  in  the  pivotal  study  (M/34273/34)  and  the  main  supporting  studies  (LAS-MD-33 
and LAS-MD-38A) demonstrated that aclidinium bromide 400 μg BID can achieve a clinically relevant 
improvement  in  lung  function  and  in  symptomatic  parameters  of  patients  with  moderate  to  severe 
COPD compared to placebo.  
Overall the improvement seen with a dose of 200 μg BID did not achieve a clinically meaningful level 
consistently  and  the  applicant’s  claim  that  the  400  μg  BID  dose  of  aclidinium  bromide  is  the  optimal 
dose given a similar safety profile was endorsed by the CHMP. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Throughout  the  clinical  programme  of  aclidinium  bromide  BID  and  QD,  the  safety  and  tolerability  of 
aclidinium  bromide  were  evaluated  by  the  monitoring  of  adverse  events,  vital  signs,  physical 
Eklira Genuair 
CHMP assessment report

Page 54/72
 
 
 
examinations, laboratory blood and urine tests and ECG measurements (including Holter monitoring in 
some  studies).  The  safety  population  consisted  of  all  subjects/patients  who  took  at  least  one  dose  of 
the investigational medicinal product (IMP).  
The  primary  evidence  of  safety  is  based  on  pooled  data  from  the  Safety  population  of  three  double-
blind,  placebo-controlled  clinical  studies  (M/34273/34,  LAS-MD-33  and  LAS-MD-38  Part  A),  in  which 
patients with moderate to severe COPD were exposed to BID aclidinium bromide (200 μg or 400 μg) or 
placebo for up to 12 or 24 weeks (hereafter referred to as “Pivotal Study Population”). This population 
was chosen for the primary evaluation of safety as the study designs were similar with all three studies 
being placebo-controlled.  
Supportive  evidence  of  safety  is  based  on  pooled  data  from  the  Safety  population  of  three  long-term 
studies  (LAS-MD-35,  LAS-MD-36  and  LAS-MD-38  Part  B)  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  COPD 
(hereafter  referred  to  as  “Long-Term  Study  Population”).  Studies  LAS-MD-36  and  LAS-MD-38  Part  B 
were extension studies for patients who completed pivotal studies LAS-MD-33 and LAS-MD-38 Part A; 
this  safety  evaluation  also  includes  data  obtained  in  those  patients  who  were  treated  with  aclidinium 
bromide  during  the  lead-in  studies.  In  studies  LAS-MD-36  and  LAS-MD-35,  patients  were  exposed  to 
aclidinium bromide 200 μg or 400 μg BID, in a double-blind fashion, for up to 52 weeks. In study LAS-
MD-38 Part B, patients were exposed to aclidinium bromide 400 μg for up to 40 weeks in an open-label 
fashion.  
Further  supportive  evidence  of  safety  is  from  pooled  data  from  the  Safety  population  of  placebo-
controlled  Phase  II  studies  of  aclidinium  bromide  BID  (M/34273/23,  M/34273/29,  LAC-MD-27  and 
M/40464/26)  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  COPD  (hereafter  referred  to  as  “Phase  II  Study 
Population”).  Safety  data  from  these  placebo-controlled  studies  were  not  pooled  with  data  from  the 
double-blind,  placebo-controlled  pivotal  studies  because  of  study  design  differences  between  the  two 
groups of studies; the Phase II studies were of cross-over design with short treatment durations (1 to 
2 weeks per treatment period).

Note: in the summary of clinical safety (SCS) Addendum there are fewer patients in the aclidinium bromide 200 μg 
group at Weeks 4, 12 and 24 compared with the initial SCS reported data. This is due to changes in study drug 
start and stop dates made after the 01 Nov 2010 cut-off date for the initial SCS.  
a   For the initial SCS, studies were: LAC-MD-27, LAS-MD-33, LAS-MD-35, LAS-MD-36, LAS-MD-38 Part A, LAS-

of 01 November 2010 in the initial SCS, completed studies were LAS-MD-38 Part A, LAS-MD-33, and LAS-MD-
36 in the initial SCS. Patients in the extension studies LAS-MD-36 and LAS-MD-38 Part B or crossover studies 
LAC-MD-27, M/34273/23, M/34273/29, and M/40464/26 who had different treatment from the lead-in study or 
other treatment period were counted multiple times, once in each treatment period.

AB = aclidinium bromide; max = maximum, min = minimum.  
With  the  addition  of  the  two  long-term  safety  studies  LAS-MD-35  and  LAS-MD-38  Part  B,  further 
patients with COPD were exposed to aclidinium bromide for at least 1 year (387) at the proposed dose 
of 400 μg BID. This was sufficient to make a better assessment of the long-term safety of aclidinium 
bromide. In addition 282 patients were exposed to aclidinium bromide 200 μg BID for at least 1 year. 
Adverse events  
The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  reactions  with  Eklira  Genuair  were  headache  (6.6%)  and

In the aclidinium bromide 400 μg BID group comparing the percentage of patients experiencing TEAEs 
in the summary of clinical safety (SCS) Addendum with that of the initial SCS demonstrated that there 
is an increase (56.1% vs 69.1%) but this increase is mainly in mild to moderate TEAEs. Increases in 
the  percentage  of  patients  discontinuing  due  to  TEAEs  (7.4%  vs  9.7%),  SAEs  (8.1%  vs  11.3%)  and 
deaths (0.5% vs 0.7%) are modest and not unexpected in this patient population. In the absence of a

placebo  arm in  the long-term  safety  studies  comparison  between  the  doses gave  some  impression  of 
whether the safety of aclidinium bromide may decrease with time and this appeared not to be so. 
Serious adverse event/deaths 
Serious adverse events 
In the Pivotal Study Population, SAEs were reported by 4.8% of patients treated with placebo, 4.8% of 
patients treated with aclidinium bromide 200 μg and 4.4% of patients treated with aclidinium bromide 
400  μg.  The  most  frequently  reported  SAE  was  COPD  (exacerbation)  which  was  reported  at  a  lower 
incidence in the aclidinium bromide treatment groups compared to the placebo group (placebo 2.7%, 
aclidinium bromide 200 μg 1.4%, aclidinium bromide 400 μg 1.6%).  
In the Long-term Study Population the most frequently reported SAE was COPD (exacerbation) and the 
incidence was numerically higher in the aclidinium bromide 400 μg group compared with the aclidinium 
bromide 200 μg group (3.6% [47.5 per 1000 PY] vs 2.5% [36.7 per 1000 PY], respectively). 
Other  than  COPD  (exacerbation),  pneumonia  was  the  only  additional  SAE  reported  in  at  least  1%  of 
the patients, but the incidence was not higher with aclidinium bromide 400 μg compared to aclidinium 
bromide  200  μg  (0.6%  vs  1.1%,  respectively).  Even  when  combining  all  SAE  terms  of  pneumonia 
(including  PTs  of  pneumonia  bacterial,  pneumonia,  lobar  pneumonia  and  pneumonia  pneumococcal), 
the  lower  incidence  in  the  400  μg  group  compared  to  the  200  μg  group  was  maintained  (1.0%  vs 
1.4%, respectively). 
There was a higher incidence of acute renal failure in the aclidinium bromide 400 μg group (0.5%; 6.6 
per  1000  PY)  compared  with  the  200  μg  group  (0%).  This  incidence  included  1  additional  patient 
(153038002, Study LAS-MD-38 Part B) as compared to the incidence reported for acute renal failure in 
the aclidinium bromide 400 μg group in the initial SCS (0.4%; 7.6 per 1000 PY). Although there was a 
higher incidence of acute renal failure in the long-term safety population there was a lower number of 
patients per 1000 PY reflecting the increased exposure. 
However in acute renal failure, COPD exacerbations and cardiac failure there is an increased incidence 
in the aclidinium bromide 400 μg group compared to the aclidinium bromide 200 μg group suggesting 
a  possible  dose  response  in  these  adverse  events  and  reinforcing  the  need  to  ensure  the  optimal 
dosing regimen is characterised. However, the numbers are very small and a causal relationship with 
aclidinium  bromide  cannot  be  established.  Therefore  it  was  not  considered  needed  to  include  these 
adverse  events  in  the  SmPC  at  this  stage.  The  PASS  study  should  give  more  information  on  AEs  and 
SAEs in general. 
Deaths 
A total of 14 on-treatment deaths were reported in the aclidinium bromide BID studies (all studies in 
COPD patients) of which 9 (2 aclidinium bromide 200 μg, 5 aclidinium bromide 400 μg and 2 placebo) 
were  reported  in  the  initial  application,  (based  on  a  data  cut-off  date  of  01  Nov  2010).  Only  one  of 
these deaths was thought to be related to study medication: 
Patient 142135024 (aclidinium bromide 400 μg) was a 73-year-old Caucasian female, an ex-smoker 
with a smoking history of 44 pack-years, whose medical history included COPD since 2007, anxiety in 
1996,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease  since  2005,  hyperlipidemia  since  2007,  hypertension  since 
January  2008,  acute  myocardial  infarction  in  December  2008,  and  coronary  artery  disease  since 
December 2008. The patient experienced a COPD exacerbation 103 days after starting treatment with 
aclidinium bromide 400 μg BID. The patient died on the same day as she was hospitalised.

Page 58/72
 
 
 
Since  the  cut-off  date  of  1  November  2010  and  up  until  13  May  2011  there  were  four  deaths  in  the 
ongoing  long-term  studies.  Five  additional  deaths  (2  aclidinium  bromide  200  µg  and  3  aclidinium 
bromide  400  µg)  were  reported  after  1  November  2012,  one  of  which  was  reported  as  a  SAE  in  the 
initial application but the patient subsequently died.  
Other  than  the  one  case  above,  deaths  reported  in  the  studies  were  in  patients  with  concomitant 
disease that explains the death or death was due to a new diagnosis not related to their COPD or study 
medication. 
Of  the  total  of  14  deaths  there  were  four  cardiovascular-related  deaths  in  patients  taking  aclidinium 
bromide  but  these  patients  had  a  previous  history  of  ischaemic  heart  disease  or,  in  one  case,  the 
cardio-respiratory  arrest  occurred  27  days  after  stopping  study  medication.  In  the  long-term  safety 
studies  two  deaths  occurred  due  to  “cardiac  arrest”.  These  were  both  in  patients  known  to  have  a 
history  of  drug  abuse  (one  with  narcotic  abuse)  and  the  patients  collapsed  suddenly  and  did  not 
respond  to  cardiopulmonary  resuscitation.  Neither  death  was  considered  to  be  related  to  study 
medication. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematological data obtained during the 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies did not disclose any 
clinically  relevant  change  from  baseline  to  end-of-study  for  any  parameter  and  were  not  dose 
dependent.  Mean  change  from  baseline  values  for  the  chemistry  determinations  also  showed  no 
relevant  changes  or  dose  dependence  in  any  treatment  arm  at  end-of-study  except  for  an  apparent 
dose-associated increase in uric acid levels. 
There were also some minor increases in liver enzymes ALT and AST but there was no consistent dose 
response.  A similar  pattern  was  seen in  the  data  from  the long-term  safety studies  but  there  was  no 
evidence  of  worsening  over  time.  Aclidinium  bromide  has  a  very  low  systemic  bioavailability  and  is 
almost  immediately  metabolised,  mainly  in  the  plasma,  and  excreted  in  the  urine  with  hepatic 
metabolism  playing  a  very  minor  role  in  the  clearance  of  aclidinium  bromide.  Therefore  there  is  little 
biological plausibility for aclidinium bromide causing hepatic toxicity.

Safety in special populations 
Detailed  analyses  of  the  impact  of  age,  sex,  race,  body  mass  index,  COPD  severity  and  the 
concomitant  use  of  inhaled  corticosteroids  (ICS)  on  the  frequency  of  adverse  events  in  the  Pivotal 
Study Population were performed. 
There were no consistent patterns of TEAEs to suggest that there is an association between age, sex, 
body mass index, COPD severity or concomitant ICS and an increased risk of experiencing a TEAE. As 
would be expected, overall the older age group experienced more TEAEs than the younger age group 
but still less than placebo within that age group. 
There  was  no  evidence  that  dose  adjustment  would  be  necessary  on  safety  grounds  on  the  basis  of 
age, sex, body mass index or COPD severity.  
The very limited data on the safety in different races other than Caucasians was noted by the CHMP. 
However, this was adequately addressed in the RMP as important missing information.

Immunological events 
There  were  no  cases  of hypersensitivity  to  aclidinium  bromide reported  in  the  clinical  programme.  As 
with all inhaled medication paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with aclidinium bromide but from the 
clinical programme it would seem that it is no more likely with aclidinium bromide than with any other 
inhaled  product.  Nevertheless  a  warning  regarding  the  possibility  has  been  included  in  section  4.4  of 
the SmPC. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No  formal  studies  to  investigate  drug-drug  interactions  were  conducted.  In  an  overview  of  TEAE 
incidence  stratified  by  use  of  allowed  concomitant  medications  for  BID  Pivotal  studies  (including 
sympathomimetic  bronchodilators,  methylxanthines,  and  oral  and  inhaled  steroids)  there  were  no 
major  differences  found  in  the  frequencies  of  TEAEs  in  patients  who  used or  did  not use  concomitant 
medications in the aclidinium bromide treatment groups when compared with placebo. 
With  the  majority  of  categories  of  concomitant  medications  those  patients  who  used  the  concomitant 
medications  tended  to  experience  more  TEAEs  than  those  who  did  not.  However  the  percentage  of 
patients experiencing TEAEs tended to be lower in the aclidinium groups than in the placebo group.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation are also referred to as adverse events leading to 
dropout (ADOs). 
Overall,  the  incidences  of  ADOs  by  SOC  were  similar  among  the  placebo,  aclidinium  bromide  200  μg 
and  aclidinium  bromide  400  μg  treatment  arms,  and  most  of  the  ADOs  were  from  the  Respiratory, 
Thoracic  and  Mediastinal  Disorders  SOC,  mainly  due  to  COPD  exacerbation  and  to  a  lesser  extent 
dyspnoea.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Adequate numbers were exposed to aclidinium bromide during the clinical development programme to 
allow  assessment  of  clinical  safety  of  a  dose  of  400  μg  BID.  As  per  ICH  E1  more  than  the  minimum 
number  of  patients  were  exposed  for  at  least  1  year  (387  at  the  proposed  dose  of  400  μg  BID)  to 
provide sufficient safety information for long-term treatment. 
In  the  development  programme  data  on  adverse  events,  serious  adverse  events  and  deaths  were 
collected and analysed for the following safety population: Pivotal Study Population, Long-term Study 
Population and Phase II Study Population. 
Throughout  the  clinical  programme  of  aclidinium  bromide  BID  and  QD,  the  safety  and  tolerability  of 
aclidinium  bromide  were  evaluated  by  the  monitoring  of  adverse  events,  vital  signs,  physical 
examinations, laboratory blood and urine tests and ECG measurements (including Holter monitoring in 
some  studies).  The  safety  population  consisted  of  all  subjects/patients  who  took  at  least  one  dose  of 
aclidinium bromide. 
The  following  adverse  events  were  reported  in  a  greater  percentage  of  patients  taking  aclidinium 
bromide  than  taking  placebo  and  were  included  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC:  headache, 
nasopharyngitis,  cough,  diarrhoea  and  sinusitis.  Anticholinergic  adverse  effects  reported  during  the 
clinical programme (dry mouth, tachycardia, blurred vision and urinary retention) were also included in 
the  table  of  adverse  events  in  the  SmPC.  Furthermore,  relevant  safety  information  based  on  the 
anticholinergic activity (like caution in patients with symptomatic prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck 
obstruction or with narrow-angle glaucoma) has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
The  effects  of  aclidinium  bromide  on  adverse  events  of  special  interest  were  also  explored  in  the 
categories of cardiovascular effects, anticholinergic effects and pneumonia/COPD exacerbations. 
A  thorough QT  study  (Study  M/34273/11)  was  conducted  but  as  the  proposed  dose  at  that  time was 
200 g QD the highest dose investigated was 800 g QD. No evidence of a clinically relevant effect on 
QTc interval was demonstrated in this study. 
In Phase I studies inhalation of single doses up to 6 mg of aclidinium bromide and multiple doses up to 
800 g BID for 7 days were investigated with one episode of tachycardia being reported by one subject 
taking 800 g BID. 
In  the  pivotal  Phase  III  studies  Holter  monitoring  was  conducted  in  a  subgroup  of  patients.  Although 
the overall rate of ECG abnormalities was similar across the two aclidinium bromide groups, the rate of 
reporting  of  conduction  abnormalities,  particularly  AV  block  did  appear  to  increase  over  time.  There 
was  also  a  larger  number  of  patients  with  QTc  prolongation  in  the  aclidinium  bromide  400  μg  group 
compared with the aclidinium bromide 200 μg group. 
From  the  long-term  safety  data  there  appeared  to  be  an  effect  of  aclidinium  bromide  on  AV-nodal 
conduction  and  the  applicant  was  asked  to  discuss  possible  mechanisms  of  action  that  may  explain 
this.  Further  to  this  request,  the  applicant  presented  data  on  the  reporting  of  AV  Node  conduction 
defects  as  a  treatment-emergent  adverse  event  (TEAE)  and  on  prolongation  of  PR  interval  from 
centrally  assessed  ECG  recordings.  Although  there  is  no  consistent  dose  response  association  with 
conduction  defects  or  clinically  meaningful  increases  in  PR  interval,  in  the  placebo-controlled  studies 
there  were  no  reports  of  a  TEAE  of  AV  block  in  the  placebo  group.  In  the  placebo-controlled  studies 
there was a trend towards a greater percentage of patients with a shift to increased PR interval across 
the doses (2.6% placebo, 3.0% aclidinium bromide 200 μg BID and 3.3% aclidinium bromide 400 μg 
BID). However, the numbers (and percentages) were small and the trend could be chance.  
Eklira Genuair 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169578/2012 
Page 62/72
 
 
The  applicant  explained  that  the  data  did  not  demonstrate  a  definite  association  between  aclidinium 
bromide and AV Node block or PR interval prolongation to suggest a causal relationship and there was 
no known biological mechanism by which aclidinium bromide should cause heart block. There was no 
evidence  of  an  increased  risk  of  cardiac  failure  or  cerebrovascular  adverse  effects  with  aclidinium 
bromide 400 g BID. Also there was no evidence of an increased risk of pneumonia when patients with 
COPD were taking aclidinium bromide. 
Taking the above into account, the CHMP requested the applicant to specifically monitor cardiovascular 
adverse events in the RMP and reports of conduction abnormalities post-authorisation. Additionally, the 
applicant  was  requested  to  commit  to  Post-Authorisation  Safety  (PAS)  Cohort  Study  of  Inhaled 
Aclidinium  Bromide  and  the  Risk  of  Selected  Cardiovascular  Endpoints.  (described  in  the  RMP)  where 
cardiovascular  adverse  events  will  be  particularly  monitored.  The  objectives  of  this  study  will  be 
tocompare the risk of heart failure and acute myocardial infarction in patients with COPD on aclidinium 
bromide with the risk in patients with COPD on other drugs commonly used in COPD. 
Since  patients  with  pre-existing  cardiovascular  abnormalities  and,  in  particular  patients  with  cardiac 
failure (NYHA stage III-IV) were excluded from the studies, cardiovascular adverse events need to be 
monitored  further  by  the  applicant  in  the  RMP  and  in  the  above-mentioned  Post-Authorisation  Safety 
Study. Given the lack of data in this patient group, the SmPC in section 4.4 advises that the product 
should be used with caution. 
Additionally,  the  first  step  in  the  above-mentioned  post-authorisation  safety  study  (PASS)  will  be  to 
perform  a  drug  utilisation  study  (DUS)  to  cover  aspects  related  to  drug  utilisation,  off-label  use,  and 
identification of patient groups with missing information in the RMP. A cohort study will be conducted in 
new  users  of  aclidinium  bromide  and  new  users  of  other  inhaled  medications  frequently  used  by 
patients  with  COPD.  The  patients  in  this  DUS  will  also  become  the  core  of  a  larger  patient  cohort  in 
which many of the safety concerns outlined in the RMP will be evaluated in a later stage. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
There were no particular safety issues highlighted during the studies submitted with this application. In 
particular, from the safety data presented, there is no evidence that aclidinium bromide increases the 
risk of fatal events, cardiovascular disorders or pneumonia in the COPD patient population. 
The data on the effects of aclidinium bromide on the QTc interval are limited and an effect of aclidinium 
bromide  on  AV-nodal  conduction  cannot  be  ruled  out.  Cardiovascular  adverse  events  need  to  be 
monitored  further  by  the  applicant  in  the  RMP  and  in  the  proposed  Post-Authorisation  Safety  Study 
(PASS). Cardiovascular adverse events should also be discussed separately in future PSURs. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety:  
- Post-Authorisation Safety (PAS) Cohort Study of Inhaled Aclidinium Bromide and the Risk of Selected 
Cardiovascular Endpoints. 
-  Drug  utilisation  study  (DUS)  to  cover  aspects  related  to  drug  utilisation,  off-label  use,  and 
identification of patient groups with missing information in the RMP.

2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements.    
In  addition,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  applicant  should  take  the  following  minor  point  into 
consideration when an update of the Pharmacovigilance system is submitted: 
The applicant should have a procedure in place for dealing with responses to requests for information 
from  regulatory  authorities,  not  necessarily  in  relation  to  variations,  in  relation  to  any  aspect  of 
pharmacovigilance.  
At the time of this opinion, the applicant was developing an SOP AR/PA015 “Response to Requests for 
Information from Competent Authorities” and committed to finalise it and have the key personnel duly 
trained before the Commission Decision.

SmPC Section 4.4, Special Warnings and 
Precautions for Use.  
As with other inhalation therapies, 
administration of Eklira Genuair may cause 
paradoxical bronchospasm. If this occurs, 
treatment with Eklira Genuair should be 
stopped and other treatments considered. 
SmPC Section 4.1 Therapeutic Indications 
Eklira Genuair is indicated as a maintenance 
bronchodilator treatment to relieve 
symptoms in adult patients with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  
SmPC Section 4.2, Posology and Method of 
Administration.  
Paediatric Population 
There is no relevant use of Eklira Genuair in 
children (under 18 years of age) in the 
indication of COPD.  
SmPC Section 5.1, Pharmacological 
Properties 
The European Medicines Agency has waived 
the obligation to submit the results of 
studies with Eklira Genuair in all subsets of 
the paediatric population in COPD. 
SmPC Section 4.6, Fertility, Pregnancy, and 
Lactation.  
Pregnancy 
There are no data available on the use of 
aclidinium bromide in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown fetotoxicity 
only at dose levels much higher than the 
maximum human exposure to aclidinium 
bromide (see SmPC Section 5.3, Preclinical 
Safety Data). Eklira Genuair should only be 
used during pregnancy if the expected 
benefits outweigh the potential risks. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether aclidinium bromide 
and/or its metabolites are excreted in 
human milk. As animal studies have shown 
excretion of small amounts of aclidinium 
bromide and/or metabolites into milk, a 
decision must be made whether to 
discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue 
therapy with Eklira Genuair taking into 
account the benefit of breast-feeding for the 
child and the benefit of long-term aclidinium 
bromide therapy to the woman.

No dose adjustments are required for 
patients with hepatic impairment. 
SmPC Section 5.2, Pharmacokinetic 
Properties, Special Populations 
Hepatically-impaired Patients 
No studies have been performed on 
hepatically impaired patients. As aclidinium 
bromide is metabolised mainly by chemical 
and enzymatic cleavage in the plasma, 
hepatic dysfunction is very unlikely to alter 
its systemic exposure. No dose adjustment 
is required for hepatically-impaired COPD 
patients. 
Renally-impaired patients 
No significant pharmacokinetic differences 
were observed between subjects with 
normal renal function and subjects with 
renal impairment. Therefore, no dose 
adjustment and no additional monitoring are 
required for renally-impaired COPD patients.

the previous 12 months for heart failure 
functional classes III and IV as per the “New 
York Heart Association” were excluded from 
the clinical trials and the safety of these 
patient groups has not been investigated. 
Eklira Genuair should be used with caution 
in these patient groups. 
Consistent with its anticholinergic activity, 
aclidinium bromide should be used with 
caution in patients with symptomatic 
prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck 
obstruction or with narrow-angle glaucoma 
(even though direct contact of the product 
with the eyes is very unlikely). 
SmPC Section 4.5, Interaction with Other 
Medicinal Products and other Forms of 
Interaction. 
Co-administration of aclidinium bromide 
with other anticholinergic-containing 
medicinal products has not been studied and 
is not recommended. 
SmPC Section 4.5, Interaction With Other 
Medicinal Products and Other Forms of 
Interaction.  
Co-administration of aclidinium bromide 
with other anticholinergic-containing 
medicinal products has not been studied and

Although no formal in vivo drug interaction 
studies have been performed, inhaled 
aclidinium bromide has been used 
concomitantly with other COPD medicinal 
products including sympathomimetic 
bronchodilators, methylxanthines, and oral 
and inhaled steroids without clinical 
evidence of drug interactions. 
In vitro studies have shown that aclidinium 
bromide or the metabolites of aclidinium 
bromide at the therapeutic dose are not 
expected to cause interactions with P-gp 
substrate drugs or drugs metabolised by 
cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and 
esterases (see section 5.2).

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
COPD treatments may provide symptomatic relief through improvement of airway obstruction, modify 
or  prevent  exacerbations,  modify  the  course  of  the  disease  or  modify  disease  progression. 
Demonstration  of  beneficial  effects  depends  on  the  treatment  objective  of  the  individual  drug. 
Aclidinium bromide is a long acting anticholinergic bronchodilator. The improvement of the symptoms 
experienced  by the patients in terms of lung function and quality of life (QoL) has been investigated. 
The  latter  can  be  measured  by  the  validated  St  George’s  Respiratory  Questionnaire  (SGRQ)  and  by 
measurement of dyspnoea (TDI). In lung function an improvement of at least 100 ml in trough FEV1 is 
considered  to  be  clinically  relevant;  an  improvement  in  the  SGRQ  of  (-)  4  units  and  improvement  in 
TDI of 1 unit is also considered to be clinically relevant. 
The results of the pivotal study (M/34273/34) support the efficacy of aclidinium bromide 400 μg BID in 
patients with moderate to severe COPD. This is evidenced by a clinically relevant improvement in the 
point estimates of the primary endpoint, morning pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at 24 weeks and a clinically 
relevant improvement in symptomatic parameters (TDI and SGRQ) compared with placebo. Therefore 
aclidinium  bromide  has  demonstrated  a  benefit  in  lung  function  and  symptomatic  benefits  in  patients 
with moderate to severe COPD. 
The  results  of  the  pivotal  study  are  supported  by  the  results  of  two  placebo-controlled  supportive 
studies  of  12  weeks  duration  and  two  active  comparator  Phase  II  studies  in  which  the  effects  of  two 
drugs already licensed for the symptomatic treatment of COPD were compared with those of aclidinium 
bromide. 
Long-term safety studies have also demonstrated that efficacy is maintained up to 52 weeks. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The very limited data in different races other than Caucasians was noted by the CHMP. However, this 
was adequately addressed in the RMP as important missing information.  
There  are  limited  efficacy  data  beyond  6  months.  However  the  two,  primarily  safety,  studies  of  12 
months  duration  demonstrated  that  the  benefit  of  aclidinium  bromide  seen  in  the  pivotal  study  is 
maintained up to 52 weeks.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Aclidinium  bromide  is  a  long-acting,  inhaled  anticholinergic  agent  that  inhibits  anticholinergic-induced 
bronchoconstriction.  Therefore  the  risks  of  aclidinium  bromide  treatment  are  those  of  enhanced 
therapeutic effect, i.e anticholinergic adverse effects. 
The  following  adverse  events  were  reported  in  a  greater  percentage  of  patients  taking  aclidinium 
bromide  than  taking  placebo  and  were  included  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC:  headache, 
nasopharyngitis, cough, diarrhoea and sinusitis. 
Adverse  events  typically  associated  with  anticholinergic  treatments  including  dry  throat,  tachycardia, 
blurred vision and urinary retention were also included in the SmPC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Potential cardiovascular effects, which were discussed for this class of drugs, these were investigated 
in a thorough QT study (Study M/34273/11) and by Holter monitoring of a sub-group of patients in the 
Phase III studies. No evidence of a clinically relevant effect on QTc interval was demonstrated in this 
study. In the pivotal Phase III studies and long term safety studies there appeared to be an effect of 
aclidinium  bromide  on  AV-nodal  conduction  and  the  applicant  was  asked  to  discuss  possible 
mechanisms of action that may explain this. However there is no known pharmacological rationale for 
an  increase  in  PR  interval  with  aclidinium  bromide  and  the  applicant  again  presented  the  data 
regarding  AV  node  block  and  prolongation  of  the  PR  interval  from  the  clinical  studies.  There  is  no 
consistent  dose  response  association  with  conduction  defects  or  clinically  meaningful  increases  in  PR 
interval  during  the  studies.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  there  is  a  need  to  specifically  monitor 
cardiovascular adverse events in the RMP and Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS). 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The point estimates for the effect of 400 μg BID of aclidinium bromide on trough FEV1 after 24 weeks 
treatment and on quality of life measures – SGRQ and TDI were consistently above the level of clinical 
relevance compared to the effects of placebo. These effects are considered important in patients with 
COPD. 
As there are currently no treatments for COPD that affect the inevitable decline in pulmonary function, 
symptomatic  treatment  is  important  to  improve  the  patients’  quality  of  life.  This  generally  takes  the 
form of bronchodilator medication. 
In order to obtain the optimum treatment in an individual patient it is frequently necessary to employ 
polypharmacy  and  therefore  an  increase  in  the  available  bronchodilators  gives  the  prescriber  more 
choice to tailor the medication to his patient. 
Aclidinium  bromide  acts  by  inhibiting  acetylcholine-induced  bronchoconstriction  and  is  not  the  first  in 
class.  Therefore  the  adverse  effects  are  well  known  and  generally  acceptable.  The  results  from  the 
studies submitted in this application do not suggest that aclidinium bromide demonstrates any safety 
issues that are unrelated to its anticholinergic effects.

Benefit-risk balance 
The favourable effects of aclidinium bromide were consistently demonstrated across the pivotal study, 
supporting  Phase  III  studies  and  Phase  II  studies  so  it  is  considered  that  there  is  certainty  that 
aclidinium bromide has a clinically relevant benefit on the symptoms of moderate to severe COPD.  
The  adverse  effects  of  aclidinium  bromide  are  well  known,  not  serious  and  can  be  reversed  on 
discontinuing  the  medication.  There  is  no  evidence  that  these  adverse  effects  become  more  severe 
with continued use of aclidinium bromide. 
Regarding the potential cardiovascular effects in this class of drugs, there is no evidence of a clinically 
relevant  effect  on  QTc  interval.  In  the  pivotal  Phase  III  studies  and  long  term  safety  studies  there 
appeared  to  be  an  effect  of  aclidinium  bromide  on  AV-nodal  conduction.  However  there  is  no  known 
pharmacological  rationale  for  an  increase  in  PR  interval  with  aclidinium  bromide  and  there  is  no 
consistent  dose  response  association  with  conduction  defects  or  clinically  meaningful  increases  in  PR 
interval during the studies. The applicant will specifically monitor cardiovascular adverse events in the 
RMP and Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS). 
In conclusion, the favourable effects demonstrated with aclidinium bromide in patients with moderate 
to  severe  COPD  clearly  outweigh  the  identified  or  potential  risks  leading  to  a  positive  benefit-risk 
balance. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The  ability  of  aclidinium  bromide  to  relieve  the  symptoms  experienced  by  patients  with  moderate  to 
severe  COPD  in  terms  of  lung  function  and  quality  of  life  (QoL)  has  been  demonstrated.  The  most 
common side effects are headache and nasopharyngitis . 
The  favourable  effects  on  the  quality  of  life  of  the  above-mentioned  population  are  greater  than  the 
mild  adverse  effects  that are  known  for  anticholinergic  products  and  that  have  been  demonstrated  in 
the clinical studies. 
Therefore, on the basis of quality, safety and efficacy data submitted, the CHMP considers that there is 
a favourable benefit-to-risk balance for aclidinium bromide.  
4. Recommendations 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by  consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Eklira Genuair in the maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve 
symptoms  of  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  is  favourable  and  therefore  recommends 
the granting of marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  MAH  must  ensure  that  the  system  of  pharmacovigilance,  presented  in  Module  1.8.1  of  the 
Marketing Authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market.

New Active Substance Status 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  the  quality,  non-clinical  and  clinical  properties  of  the  active 
substance, the CHMP considers that aclidinium bromide is to be qualified as a new active substance. 
Aclidinium  bromide  is  a  New  Chemical  Entity,  which  has  not  previously  been  authorised  in  the 
Community, and this Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) is therefore eligible for the Centralised 
Procedure  as  a  New  Active  Substance,  in  accordance  with  Article  3(2)a  of  Regulation  (EC)  No. 
726/2004 regarding the Scope of the Centralised Procedure, as confirmed by the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) on 25th April 2008 (ref. EMEA/CHMP/221778/2008).

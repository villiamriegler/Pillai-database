Sponsor’s removal request 
10 October 2018 
Following communication of the outcome of the discussion, the sponsor formally requested the 
withdrawal of the orphan designation on 10 October 2018, prior to final opinion. 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion at the designation stage 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2010 was 
based on the following grounds: 
•  haemophilia A (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to be affecting 
approximately 0.6 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, at the time the application was made; 
• 
• 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life threatening due to bleeding which may occur in the 
brain, the spinal cord, the joints or the gut; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, sufficient justification has been provided that pegylated B-domain-deleted sequence-
modified recombinant human factor VIII may be of significant benefit to those affected by the 
condition. An assumption of major contribution to patient care is based on the non-clinical data 
submitted indicating a potential for prolongation of the effects of Factor VIII leading to fewer 
infusion sessions.  
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The sponsor is proposing that haemophilia A continues to be a distinct medical condition which meets 
the criteria for an orphan condition.  
Haemophilia A is a well describe X-linked genetic disorder that affects males exclusively with females 
being carriers of the gene mutation. The condition is characterised by low or undetectable levels of the 
coagulating protein FVIII. FVIII activity as a consequence is low or undetectable and these patients will 
present with spontaneous and life-threatening bleeding events or excessive bleeding in response to 
trauma.  
Bleeds occur in muscle, central nervous system, organs, soft tissue, and more frequently in joints, 
which leads to progressive joint deformity, anthropathy, and severe disability.  
The COMP continues to designate this condition as a distinct medical entity. 
The approved therapeutic indication “Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in previously treated 
patients ≥ 12 years of age with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)” falls within the scope 
of the designated orphan indication “treatment of haemophilia A”.

Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Based on the positive CHMP benefit-risk assessment, the intention to treat the condition has been 
justified.  
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The condition is chronically debilitating due to the complications associated with spontaneous and often 
excessive bleeding. The location and severity of the bleeding is associated with the morbidity of the 
condition with common problems associated with joint bleeding leading to joint deformity, anthropathy 
and physical disability. Bleeding can also occur in the central nervous system, organs and soft tissue 
leading to complications linked to the damage associated with the site of bleeding. 
Life expectancy has been improving in these patients since the introduction of plasma derived or 
recombinant factor VIIIs and generally it is accepted that only the very severe patients will have their 
life-expectancy shortened. It has however been recently reported by Eckhart C et al 2015 Journal of 
Thrombosis and Haemostasis, 13:1217-1225 2015 that patients with milder forms of haemophilia A 
were at risk of shortened life-expectancy. Indeed it is reported that these patients had a life-
expectancy of 64 years which was less than the normal life-expectancy for males in Europe. The 
average life-expectancy for males across the European Union was 75 years. 
(https://www.statista.com/statistics/274514/life-expectancy-in-europe/) 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor has provided a prevalence calculation based on current publications derived from a 
literature search. From this they produce a comprehensive table covering all countries who make up 
the EEA. They indicate that prevalence varies according to Member State with the lowest reported 
prevalence in Finland (0.26 in 10,000) and the highest in Ireland (1.3 in 10,000). This yields an 
average prevalence across Europe of 0.73 in10,000 persons. Please see table below:

The sponsor has provided a clear and reasonable prevalence calculation based on readily available 
sources in the public domain and proposes that the overall prevalence in Europe is 0.73 in 10,000, 
which is accepted.

There are currently a lot of products available for use in Europe so physicians have an extensive choice 
of products.  
The sponsor has discussed treatment modalities and articles available from the World Federation of 
Haemophilia. The World Federation of Haemophilia has published Guidelines in 2012 which are still 
relevant (https://www1.wfh.org/publication/files/pdf-1472.pdf ). 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor is basing their claim for significant benefit on a major contribution to patient care. 
The sponsor submitted a question on significant benefit and obtained a response from the COMP in the 
Protocol Assistance letter date 19 January 2012 which was a follow-up meeting. The COMP in their 
response stated: 
Withdrawal Assessment Report - Orphan Maintenance 
 EMA/803602/2018 1.2,CURRENT,WR clean 
 
 
 
 
It is acknowledged that the half-life of BAY 94-9027 is prolonged in comparison to Kogenate. If Study 
B (13024) will provide sufficient evidence that the dosing interval of BAY 94-9027 can be relevantly 
extended for most patients while otherwise maintaining the same benefit/risk balance, the COMP would 
consider such an extension a “major contribution to patient care”.  The COMP would probably consider 
an extension of the dosing interval from 2-3 times weekly to once weekly to be a relevant extension; it 
is however questionable whether any lesser extension would also be considered relevant. If the 
extension is only achieved by raising the dosage, the assessment of a significant benefit will become 
difficult. The fact that Study B (13024) is lacking a Kogenate control arm will make the assessment of 
significant benefit even more difficult.  
For these reasons, the modified design of Study B (13024) might not be appropriate to demonstrate 
'significant benefit' for the designated orphan medicinal product BAY 94-9027, even if no other long 
acting products will be authorized at the time of Marketing Authorisation Application of BAY 94-9027. 
The claim of major contribution to patient care is based on the proposed possibility of prolonged dosing 
regimens with their product of every 5 to 7 days due to its prolonged t-half-life and higher AUC. The 
sponsor provides data claiming a decrease of 50 to 100 less intravenous infusions per year for 
prophylaxis treatment in haemophilia. The data is derived from PROTECT VIII, the pivotal Phase III 
study used for the purpose of licencing. In the PROTECT VIII study there is no Kogenate or other 
similar Factor VIII control arm as recommended by the COMP.  
PROTECT VIII was divided into two Parts: 
• 
• 
PART A included an on-demand and a prophylactic treatment arm. The prophylactic arm 
started with 2X/week infusions at 25IU/kg. Following clinical assessment at week 10, patients 
with less than 2 spontaneous (joint/muscle) bleeds in Weeks 0 to 10 were randomised 1:1 to 
either an every 5-day (initial 45IU/kg) or every 7-day (60IU/kg) prophylactic regime for an 
additional 26 weeks.  
PART B assessed the safety and efficacy of their product in haemostasis during major surgical 
procedures.  
The main efficacy parameter was the median Annualised Bleeding Rate (ABR) for Part A. The median 
ABR for the 5-day group (n=37) was 1.17 and for the 7-day group (n=29) it was 0.54 during long-
term extension. 
In the executive summary of the PROTECT VIII study report it is highlighted that the dosing interval 
could be prolonged to once every 7-days. Efficacy was based on median Annual Bleeding Rates (ABRs). 
The data generated indicated that the same ABR range could be achieved as for other commercially 
available recombinant human coagulation FVIII products with up to 100 less intravenous infusions per 
year to commonly used Factor VIIIs.  
In the indirect comparison of their product to other FVIII products the sponsor concludes that they 
achieve a similar level of bleeding control offering fewer infusions with the once every 7-day than 
authorised alternatives Kovaltry, NovoEight, Afstyla and Elocta. No concrete data is given to compare 
the number of infusions and the need for healthcare professional intervention between the sponsor’s 
product and the comparators. The number of infusions in the 7 day group appears to be significantly 
less than those who follow traditional regimes as typified by Leopold I and Kovaltry treatment regimes. 
There is no comparative data to products which could offer a similar dosing schedule as was requested 
at the time of Protocol Assistance. There is also no separate discussion on differences between the 
recombinant FVIII infusions or plasma derived infusions. The indirect comparisons offered are limited 
in context as other products of more prolonged half-lives are not provided such as Elocta and 
Hemlibra.

A further indirect comparison is offered regarding the decrease in ABR in the individuals recruited in 
the PROTECT VIII study to their historical controls to support the justification of significant benefit. 
Prior medication: 
Prior-FVIII treatment 
Again the historical comparisons are made to the Factor VIII products which do not have prolonged 
half-lives making the relevance of the claim of a major contribution to patient associated with the 
prolonged half-life of the sponsor’s product difficult to establish. 
Paracetamol was used primarily as a concomitant therapy in 40% of the patients. 10 patients used 
“Factor VIII antihemophilia factor” in the main study. It is not clear in which patient population the use 
of paracetamol and Factor VIII antihaemophilia factor was used.  
The sponsor has provided some patient reported outcome data with their product. 
In the PROTECT VIII main study in PTPs ≥ 12 years of age, PRO data on quality of life and health 
status, work and school productivity, pain, and treatment satisfaction were to be collected. The 
objective of PRO data was to collect the patient's perspectives and opinions on the impact and 
effectiveness of BAY 94-9027 in the treatment of hemophilia.  Questionnaires were filled out by the 
patient either at home or in the treatment center within a week of a scheduled visit.  The completion of 
the questionnaires was scheduled at baseline, Week 10, and Week 36. 
PRO data on quality of life, work and school productivity, and pain were collected for all patients via 
the following instruments: 
•  Brief Pain Inventory – Short Form (BPI-SF) 
•  Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2) 
•  Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI-CIQ) Questionnaire 
•  Hemophilia-specific quality of life (Haemo-QoL-A) questionnaire for adults 
•  Short form of Hemophilia quality of life (Haemo-QoL) questionnaire for kids 12-17 years old.

Although the results of these parameters are of interest there is no discussion by the sponsoron how 
this compares to other products authorised for use in this condition where similar parameters have 
been measures.  
The basis of a major contribution to patient care has not been sufficiently discussed. While a regime 
that is once a week versus twice a week or once every five days would lead to an assumption of a 
major contribution to patient care, without specific data establishing the context versus current 
authorised medicines it is difficult to establish this this is indeed the case.  
A recent article by K. Lieuw Journal of Blood Medicine 2017:8 67–73 helps to contextualise the current 
situation regarding the range of products offered for the treatment of these patients. The author states 
in the abstract that: “Currently, the standard of care in developed countries is to offer primary 
prophylactic FVIII infusions to patients with severe HA and has led to dramatic increase in the quality 
of life for these patients” 
The author also note that: “Recently, a novel single-chain recombinant FVIII (Afstyla®) has been 
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in May 2016. Recombinant factor VIII 
single chain (rFVIII-SC) has increased stability and affinity for VWF, extending its half-life with the 
possibility of decreased immunogenicity”. Europe has also recently approved this product. The author 
also notes that: “However, it is worth noting that individualized dosing must be done using observed 
pharmacokinetic values, as the half-life of each product can differ between patients, and in individual 
cases, the use of EHL FVIII products may not prolong the half-life enough to justify the increased cost 
of these new factors. For example, despite the longest half-life advertised of any of the factors 
available, the actual half-life is much shorter in younger patients, and we have been unable to go to 
less than thrice-weekly infusions of rFVIII–Fc (Eloctate) in order to maintain a trough level >1%.” 
The paucity of data from the PROTECT VIII study makes the significant benefit difficult to establish. 
The sponsor is requested to further elaborate on the claims to support significant benefit within the 
context of current management of these patients and considering a wider scope of the available 
products.

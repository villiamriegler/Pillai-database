1.  Introduction 
On 8th December 2016, the MAH submitted the final study report of paediatric study GENA-13 (eCTD 
0041) in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006. On 18th of January 2017, 
GENA-13 study report - Module 2.5 was subsequently provided (eCTD 0042). No amendments to be 
introduced to the product information have been identified by the marketing-authorisation holder 
(MAH).  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The pediatric study GENA-13 was performed to investigate the long-term immunogenicity, tolerability, 
and efficacy of prophylactic Human-cl rhFVIII in previously treated children with severe haemophilia A 
(FVIII:C <1%). This study was a prospective, open-label, uncontrolled, international, multicenter 
phase 3b continuation study of the GENA-03 study. Studies GENA-01, GENA-08 and GENA-03 were the 
pivotal studies and study GENA-09, and its extension GENA-04 were supportive studies, mainly for 
assessment of inhibitor development and surgical prophylaxis. All these studies of the development 
program enrolled patients who were previously treated (defined as having ≥150 exposure days [EDs] in 
patients ≥12 years of age, and ≥50 EDs in patients <12 years of age) and the study duration per 
patient was the same in all studies – at least 6 months and at least 50 EDs. Identical objective 
measures were used to assess haemostatic efficacy of on-demand (and breakthrough) bleeding 
episodes (BEs) and practically identical safety variables were recorded throughout all studies. In 
addition, all key laboratory parameters were measured in the same certified central laboratory by the 
same validated methods. FVIII concentration in patients’ plasma was measured by both the one-stage 
and chromogenic assays. FVIII potency of FVIII concentrates used for PK and in vivo recovery 
investigations was measured by the central laboratory using both assays. FVIII inhibitors were 
assessed by the Nijmegen modification of Bethesda assay and time points for testing of inhibitory and 
non-inhibitory antibodies were the same in all studies. A study in previously untreated patients (GENA-
05) is currently ongoing to assess the immunogenicity, efficacy and safety of Human-cl rhFVIII. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Human-cl rhFVIII (Nuwiq®) is a B domain-deleted recombinant human blood coagulation factor VIII 
(rhFVIII) concentrate produced by Octapharma AB, Stockholm, Sweden. The protein is expressed in a 
human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line derivative, HEK293F (clone 4124K), which is adapted to grow 
in serum-free culture medium. The product is a sulphated glycoprotein with complex-, hybrid and high 
mannose-type glycosylation present at the same sites as in native human plasma-derived FVIII. 
Human-cl rhFVIII drug product consists of a white to off-white sterile, lyophilised powder and a solvent 
to prepare a solution for intravenous injection. The lyophilised powder is supplied in vials containing 
250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU or 2000 IU rhFVIII per vial, to be reconstituted with 2.5 mL of water for 
injection.

3.  Clinical aspects 
3.1.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for pediatric GENA-13 clinical study for assessment of the long-term 
immunogenicity, tolerability and efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in previously treated children with severe 
Haemophilia A.  
3.1.2.  Clinical study 
Study design and Study description 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective of this study was to determine the long-term immunogenicity and tolerability of 
Human-cl rhFVIII in previously treated children with severe haemophilia A. The secondary objective of 
this study was to determine the long-term efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in the prophylaxis and 
treatment of bleeding episodes (BEs), and in surgical prophylaxis in previously treated children with 
severe haemophilia A. 
Study design 
This was a prospective, open-label, uncontrolled, international, multicenter phase 3b study designed to 
collect long-term data on the immunogenicity, tolerability, and efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII. 
Participation in GENA-13 was open to all evaluable patients who had completed study GENA-03 with a 
study participation period of 6 months. The screening visit for GENA-13 coincided with the study 
completion visit of GENA-03, with results transferred between databases. 
Study population /Sample size 
Eligible subjects have completed GENA-03 study with a study participation of 6 months and provided 
that prophylaxis with Human-cl rhFVIII continued without intermediate interruption. Eligible subjects 
further have the capability to understand and comply with the relevant aspects of the study and have 
voluntary informed written and signed consent obtained from the parents (or legal guardians). 
Patients who developed FVIII inhibitors (≥ 0.6 Bethesda units [BU]) in the course of study GENA-03 or 
have any severe liver or kidney disease (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase 
levels >5 times of upper limit of normal, creatinine >120 μmol/L) were not eligible for the study. 
In total, 56 patients have completed GENA-03 study from which 49 were enrolled into GENA-13 study. 
Treatments 
For prophylactic treatment, a dose of 30–40 IU FVIII/kg BW was selected in an every-other-day or a 3-
times-a-week dosage regimen. Two dose escalations of approximately +5 IU FVIII/kg BW each were 
recommended if two or more spontaneous bleeding episodes (BEs) within one month were reported.  
Dosage recommendations for the treatment of BEs depended on the location and extent of bleeding as 
well as on the clinical situation of the patient. Minor haemorrhages were treated with 20–30 IU 
FVIII/kg BW. 30–40 IU FVIII/kg BW were used to treat moderate to major haemorrhages. Treatment

was repeated every 12–24 hours until BE had resolved. Major to life-threatening haemorrhages were 
initially treated with a dose of 50–60 IU FVIII/kg BW and repeated doses of 20–25 IU FVIII/kg BW 
every 8–12 hours were administered until BE had resolved. 
For prophylaxis treatment in minor surgeries, 25–30 IU FVIII/kg BW were administered within 3 hours 
before surgery to achieve an intended target peak level of about 50–60%. Dosage was repeated every 
12–24 hours until healing was complete. In major surgeries, prophylactic doses of 50 IU FVIII/kg BW 
within 3 hours before surgery were administered to achieve an intended target peak level of 
approximately 100%. Treatment was repeated if necessary after 6–12 hours initially and for at least 6 
days until healing is complete.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoints: 
o 
Long-term immunogenicity, assessed based on inhibitor activity determined using the modified 
Bethesda assay (Nijmegen modification) and anti-rhFVIII antibody measurements. 
o 
Long-term tolerability, assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs), vital signs, laboratory 
parameters (hematology and clinical chemistry) and physical examination (including 
Hemophilia Joint Health Score HJHS) throughout the study duration. 
Secondary endpoints: 
o 
Long-term efficacy of prophylactic treatment, assessed based on the monthly and annual rates 
(ABR) of spontaneous and total BEs. 
o 
Long-term efficacy in the treatment of BEs, assessed by the patient/patient’s parents or legal 
guardians at the end of a BE. 
o  Efficacy in surgical prophylaxis, assessed by the surgeon at the end of surgery and 
postoperatively by both the surgeon and the haematologist. 
Statistical Methods 
The statistical analysis of all endpoints was performed descriptively and exploratory as appropriate. For 
analysis, a safety population (i.e. all patients who received at least one dose of Human-cl rhFVIII), an 
efficacy population (Intention-to-treat, Intention-to-treat Bleeding, and Intention-to-treat Surgery) and 
specific subgroups (patients aged 2–5 years or 6–12 years at the time of enrolment into GENA-03) 
were defined.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
49 from 56 patients who have completed GENA-03 study were enrolled into GENA-13 study. All 49 
patients are included in the analysis.  
Baseline data 
All patients had severe haemophilia A and were white and of neither Hispanic nor Latino ethnicity. 
Genetic defects were documented in 47 of the 49 enrolled patients. Median age of the entire patient 
population was 6 (range, 3–13) years. Age distribution at the time of enrolment was at follows: 2-5 
years = 26 patients and 6-12 years = 23 patients. The mean duration of participation in the study 
(= treatment duration) was 29.4 ± 6.9 months (median: 30.1 months, range, 9.6–53.2). Slightly more 
than one third of the patients had a family history of haemophilia (N=19, 38.8%), and 3 patients 
(6.1%) had a family history of inhibitors. 
Efficacy results 
Prophylactic treatment: 
Median duration of prophylactic treatment was 30 months (range, 9.5–52) and the median dose per 
prophylactic infusion was 36.5 IU/kg (range, 28.5–61). 27 out of the 49 enrolled patients experienced 
81 spontaneous BEs during the study course resulting in an efficacy rating of “excellent” (i.e. BE 
monthly rate < 0.75) for all patients. The ABR for spontaneous BEs in the 49 patients was 0.67. The 
sponsor stated that continued prophylactic treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII in GENA-13 study 
significantly decreased ABR for spontaneous BEs in the younger age group (2 – 5 years) when 
compared to GENA-3 study (ABR 1.67), in which all patients were treated prophylactically using a 
recommended dosage regimen of 30–40 IU FVIII/kg BW every other day or 3 times weekly. 35 out of 
the 49 patients (71%) did not have a single abnormal joint score and an improvement of the HJHS 
from 0.69 ± 2.99 (range, 0–20) to 0.23 ± 0.84 (range, 0–4) and the global gait score from 0.15 ± 
0.65 (range, 0–4) to 0.06 ± 0.25 (range, 0–1) could be observed until study end. 
Treatment of BEs: 
41 patients had 336 BEs (spontaneous 24%, traumatic 62%, other/undocumented cause 16%) from 
which were 54.2% minor bleedings, 43.4% moderate to major, 1.5% major to life threatening and 
0.9% of undocumented severity. About one third of the BEs was located to joints. 331 BEs required 
treatment of which 71.4% were treated with one infusion, 13.5% with two infusions and 3-8 infusions 
were administered to 15.1%. Median dose per infusion was 39.8 IU/kg (range, 24.6–111.1), and the 
median dose per BE was 47.4 IU/kg (range, 24.6–351.3). Efficacy was rated “excellent” for 57.2% of 
the 311 treatment requiring BEs , “good” for 24.1%, “moderate” for 14.8%, “none” for 1.9% (these 
were of moderate to major severity and were treated with 4-8 infusions) and for 1.9% treatment 
efficacy was undocumented. Overall, in GENA-13 study 81.4% treated BEs had an efficacy rating of 
either “excellent” or “good” which is comparable to the results of the GENA-03 study (82.4%). 
Surgical prophylaxis: 
16 out of the 49 patients underwent 27 surgical procedures of which 24 were treated with Human-cl 
rhFVIII. 12 of 24 were major surgery procedures and included removal of port-a-cath, vascuport 
exchange, dental extraction, ureter reimplanation, ingrown toe nail and evacuation of haemarthrosis of 
knee with splint installation. Median doses per infusion were 49.6 and 41.5 IU/kg, respectively, for

major (n = 12) and minor surgeries (n = 12). The median number of infusions for minor and major 
surgeries was 8 (range, 2–19) and 11 (range, 3–37), respectively. Efficacy assessment of surgical 
prophylaxis with Human-cl rhFVIII was available for 21 surgical procedures and all them rated 
“excellent” (intraoperative assessment by the surgeon and the overall assessments by the surgeon and 
the haematologist were available for 16 surgeries, 5 surgeries had at least one assessment and 3 
surgeries had no efficacy assessment). 
Safety results 
The safety population comprised 49 patients with a median number of exposure days (EDs) of 424 
(range, 145–802) and a median number of infusions of 424 (range, 145–823). Patients received a total 
of 20,518 infusions (prophylaxis, n=19,725; treatment of BEs, n=485; surgical prophylaxis, n=261; in 
vivo recovery, n=47). 
45 patients had a total of 317 adverse events (AEs) of which 81% were mild, 17% moderate and 8% 
severe. Respiratory tract infections, headache, pyrexia and chills were amongst the most common AEs. 
On case of mild dyspnea was considered to be drug-related. No AE resulted in withdrawal of the 
patient from the study. 
30 serious AEs (SAEs) occurred in 21 patients, one of them was considered drug-related (mild 
pyrexia). 13 out of 30 SAEs were related with the patients’ underlying condition (i.e. device-related 
events, hematuria, hematoma, hemarthrosis and synoviorthesis).  
In total, two probably or possibly drug-related ADRs occurred, i.e. mild pyrexia and mild, temporary 
dyspnea. 
Pyrexia was experienced in one patient after rhFVIII infusion (331 EDs) and lasted for about 1 day. 11 
days before the patient had already been hospitalised with fever and shivering and a diagnosis of 
porth-a-cath infection. He recovered and had been discharged from hospital after 5 days. 6 days later 
he was again hospitalised due to fever. Laboratory test were performed including blood culture, blood 
morphology and CRP. No results on these analyses have been provided by the sponsor. The patient 
was treated with amikacin, paracetamol, and ibuprofen and discharged from hospital after 3 days. The 
event was classified as SAE because hospitalisation was required and as possibly drug-related. The 
same patient was again hospitalised with symptoms of fever above 3 month later which was 
considered not drug-related. Central catheter of this patient was changed again 3 month later due to 
application site erosion (not related). 
Mild dyspnea was experienced after 134 EDs by one patient and lasted for about 3 minutes, after 
which the patient recovered. This AE was classified as probably or possibly related to treatment with 
Human-cl rhFVIII. The sponsor further notes, that other non-drug-related AEs in this patient included 
house dust allergy which was diagnosed few days after AE occurrence. 
In the 49 patients, incidence of FVIII inhibitors was 0%. One patient developed low titers of non-
inhibitory anti-rhFVIII antibodies during the study; prophylactic efficacy in this patient was rated 
“excellent”. As stated by the sponsor, no cases of thromboembolism or hypersensitivity were observed 
and results of physical examination and vital sign monitoring did not indicate any treatment related 
safety concerns.

3.1.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, the MAH submitted the final study 
report of GENA-13 clinical trial (eCTD 0041 and 0042) investigating the long-term immunogenicity, 
tolerability and efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII (Nuwiq®) in 49 previously treated pediatric patients with 
severe haemophilia A. Hemostatic efficacy could be demonstrated for the majority of patients receiving 
Human-cl rhFVIII for on-demand treatment as well as for treatment for long-term and surgical 
prophylaxis. However, in accordance with the guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant and 
human plasma-derived factor VIII products (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009 rev. 1), sufficient data on 
FVIII consumption for prophylaxis and on-demand therapy should be provided. Additionally, the 
substantial numbers of BEs which could not be treated sufficiently requires further explanation by the 
MAH. 
With regard to safety aspects, Human-cl rhFVIII was administered for prophylactic and on-demand 
treatment with a sufficient number of EDs. 2 out of 317 reported AEs were considered possibly drug-
related, i.e. one case of mild pyrexia and one case of mild, temporary dyspnea. Indeed, pyrexia and 
dyspnea potentially are indicative of drug-mediated hypersensitivity reactions that may have 
manifested in these 2 patients. However, pyrexia in one patient appears to be more likely associated 
with recurrent infection of a port-a-cath implantable venous access system and the patient who 
experienced temporary and mild dyspnea after 134 EDs received approximately 150 EDs during the 
following year without recurrence of this AE. Thus, both AEs are not considered to indicate 
hypersensitivity reactions related to Human-cl rhFVIII. In terms of FVIII antibodies, one patient 
developed confirmed low-titers of non-inhibitory anti-rhFVIII antibodies which does not raise significant 
concerns. No cases of thromboembolism or hypersensitivity were detected. No further safety issues 
have been identified in pediatric patients from this trial. 
4.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
In summary, the data reported from the GENA-13 study are not expected to change the current 
benefit-risk profile. However, presentation of efficacy and safety data is not sufficient and the MAH is 
requested to provide further data from GENA-13 study to accurately reflect current status of pediatric 
assessment (see section 5 “Additional clarification requested”).

5.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
List of Questions: 
1. 
The MAH is asked to provide a line listing of all the studies included in the development 
program (nonclinical and clinical). Provided information should include at least study title, 
study number, date of completion, and date of submission of final study report. 
2. 
According to applicable guideline (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009 rev.1), data on FVIII 
consumption for prophylaxis as well as for on-demand treatment (dose/kg) should be provided. 
With regard to efficacy results of prophylactic treatment regime and of surgical prophylaxis, 
such data are missing. Thus, the MAH is asked to provide data on monthly or annual FVIII 
consumption (IU/kg) as well as consumption related to major surgical procedures. E.g. age-
related subgroup analysis should be provided and compared with adults (age-groups: 2-6, 6-
12, 12-18 and >18 years). Regarding FVIII consumption in on-demand treatment, dose per 
infusion and per BE were provided, however, the median doses per bleeding episode exhibited 
a large variation with a range of 24.6–351.3 IU/kg. The MAH is requested to explain this wide 
range.  
3. 
As outlined by the MAH, a number of patients were excluded from the efficacy analysis due to 
overdosing of more than 40% (Patient IDs: 13-01-04, 13-01-05, 13-01-07, 13-43-03). The 
MAH is asked to provide further details of these subjects. In particular, the MAH needs to 
justify whether the current dose recommendation in the SmPC is adequate. 
4. 
In the treatment of BEs, a substantial number of efficacy ratings were “moderate” or “none” in 
both pediatric studies, GENA-03 (17.6%) and GENA-13 (16,7%). Though some details are 
provided about none responding subjects from GENA-13, the MAH should display and reflect 
data of all subjects that have not been treated successfully. 
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop.

Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
The MAH provided adequate line listings of nonclinical as well as clinical studies included in the 
development program.  
Conclusion 
The question has been answered satisfactorily. 
Question 2 
According to applicable guideline (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009 rev.1), data on FVIII consumption 
for prophylaxis as well as for on-demand treatment (dose/kg) should be provided. With regard to 
efficacy results of prophylactic treatment regime and of surgical prophylaxis, such data are missing. 
Thus, the MAH is asked to provide data on monthly or annual FVIII consumption (IU/kg) as well as 
consumption related to major surgical procedures. E.g. age-related subgroup analysis should be 
provided and compared with adults (age-groups: 2-6, 6-12, 12-18 and >18 years). Regarding FVIII 
consumption in on-demand treatment, dose per infusion and per BE were provided, however, the 
median doses per bleeding episode exhibited a large variation with a range of 24.6–351.3 IU/kg. The 
MAH is requested to explain this wide range.  
MAH’s responses 
FVIII consumption for prophylaxis 
Data on FVIII consumption for prophylaxis per month for the entire population were provided in the 
Study Report, section 11.4.1, Table 17. Corresponding data for the age groups 2-5 years and 6-12 
years were provided in the Table 14.2.3.1-1. 
Table 1 summarizes the FVIII monthly consumption for prophylaxis by age group in comparison to 
data obtained from pivotal studies in children (GENA-03) and adults (GENA-08) submitted for obtaining 
marketing authorization.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
EMA/331905/2017 
Page 13/23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In general, FVIII consumption for prophylaxis in the paediatric study GENA-13 and its predecessor 
study GENA-03 were similar to each other and was higher than in adults. 
Data on FVIII consumption for prophylaxis by treatment regime in GENA-13 were provided in Table 
14.2.3.1-3 and are summarized in Table 2. 
In general, younger children used more FVIII than older children and every other day prophylaxis 
required more FVIII than prophylaxis given three times per week.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
EMA/331905/2017

FVIII consumption for major surgery 
Data on FVIII consumption for surgical prophylaxis (in total, for minor and for major surgery) were 
provided in Table 14.2.5.2-3. Data on FVIII consumption for major surgeries are summarized in Table 
3 in comparison to data obtained from pivotal studies submitted for obtaining marketing authorization. 
In general, the total consumption of FVIII for prophylaxis in major surgeries seem to be dependent on 
the number of infusions. 
FVIII consumption for on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes 
Data on FVIII consumption for on-demand treatment per month and per year were provided in Table 
14.2.4.3-1. Table 4 summarizes the monthly FVIII consumption for on demand treatment by age 
group in comparison to data obtained from pivotal studies submitted for obtaining marketing 
authorization.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
EMA/331905/2017 
Page 15/23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The FVIII consumption for treatment of bleeding episodes in the extension study GENA-13 was lower 
than in the predecessor study GENA-03 (and very similar to that for adult patients treated 
prophylactically) suggesting a potential benefit of long-term prophylactic treatment. 
Doses per bleeding episode 
The median doses per bleeding episode vary widely in GENA-13 (24.6-351.3 IU/kg), but a similar 
variability was also observed in the previous studies with Nuwiq, both in children (25-1521 IU/kg) and 
in the adults (8-657 IU/kg), see Table 5. The wide range is probably due to the varying number of 
infusions used to treat a bleeding episode. Although the majority of BEs were treated with one or two 
infusions of Nuwiq (91.4%/5.8% in GENA-01, 81.5%/7.4% in GENA-08, 68.6%/12.7% in GENA-03, 
71.4%/135.5% in GENA-13), some bleeds needed more and in one case in GENA-03 even with 22 
infusions. Overall, both the doses per bleeding episodes and the number of infusions used to treat a 
bleeding episode in GENA-13 study are very similar to those of the predecessor study GENA-03.

Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
The MAH provided sufficient data analysis of FVIII consumption for prophylaxis and on-demand 
treatment as well as for major surgery in comparison to pivotal studies. Furthermore, the variation of 
FVIII doses used for on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes was comparable to other studies with 
Nuwiq. Thus, no regulatory consequences are required. 
Conclusion 
This issue has been solved. 
Question 3 
As outlined by the MAH, a number of patients were excluded from the efficacy analysis due to 
overdosing of more than 40% (Patient IDs: 13-01-04, 13-01-05, 13-01-07, 13-43-03). The MAH is 
asked to provide further details of these subjects. In particular, the MAH needs to justify whether the 
current dose recommendation in the SmPC is adequate. 
MAH’s responses 
We would like to clarify that patients 13-01-04, 13-01-05, 13-41-07 (not 13-01-07 as mentioned in 
comment 3), and 13-43-03 were excluded from the Per Protocol (PP) population because of 
overdosing. During the data review meeting it was decided to exclude these 4 patients from the PP 
population because of deviations from the recommended prophylactic dose: overdosing (i.e., a 
deviation of at least +20% from the highest recommended dose) in more than 40% of prophylactic 
infusions. Thus, these patients were considered major protocol violators because of treatment 
deviations (as well as 3 other patients due to noncompliance with completing the study diary), see 
Clinical Study Report, section 10.3.1. 
We would like to further clarify that efficacy analysis (i.e. calculation of the annualized bleeding rate as 
well as FVIII consumption for prophylaxis) was also performed for these 4 patients as they are

included in the ITT population analysis. Table 6 below provides some details on these 4 patients in 
comparison to the ITT and PP population. 
Patient #13-01-04, 4 years, 21.9 kg, had 476 prophylactic infusions, 422 (88.7%) of them were 
overdosed. The highest prophylactic dose administered was 123.97 IU/kg, with overdoses reported to 
have been due to parent initiative. In GENA-03, the mean prophylactic dose per injection and per 
month was 50.1 IU/kg and 888.5 IU/kg (and thus 12.9% lower than in GENA-03), respectively. 
Patient #13-01-05, 6 years, 28.3 kg, had 484 prophylactic infusions, 299 (61.8%) of them were 
overdosed. The highest prophylactic dose administered was 98.36 IU/kg, with no reasons for 
overdosing given. In GENA-03, the mean prophylactic dose per injection and per month was 38.1 
IU/kg and 571.1 IU/kg (and thus 10.3% higher than in GENA-03), respectively. 
Patient #13-41-07, 4 years, 19.8 kg, had 449 prophylactic infusions, 246 (54.8%) of them were 
overdosed. The overall prophylactic dose was consistently 1000 IU per infusion, resulting in doses 
between 50.5 IU/kg at the beginning (BW: 19.8 kg) and 42.7 IU/kg at the end of the patient’s study 
participation (BW: 23.8 kg). In GENA-03, the mean prophylactic dose per injection and per month was 
35.0 IU/kg and 464.0 IU/kg (and thus 34.8% higher than in GENA-03), respectively. 
Patient #13-43-03, 6 years, 18.4 kg, had 378 prophylactic infusions, 316 (83.6%) of them were 
overdosed. The overall prophylactic dose was consistently 1000 IU per infusion, resulting in doses 
between 54.35 IU/kg at the beginning (BW: 18.4 kg) and 46.73 IU/kg at the end of the patient’s study 
participation (BW: 21.6 kg). In GENA-03, the mean prophylactic dose per injection and per month was 
56.7 IU/kg and 809.5 IU/kg (and thus 5.5% lower than in GENA-03), respectively. Source: GENA-13: 
Table 2.2-4 02-Sep-2016 GASD for Octapharma. 
Overall, the prophylactic dosing in GENA-13 for the entire study population was very similar to those 
on GENA-03, which served as the pivotal paediatric study for approval of Nuwiq. To a somewhat lesser 
degree this is also true for the four patients with overdosing in GENA-13. In conclusion, we find that 
the current dose recommendation in the SmPC for children “The posology is the same in adults and 
children, however, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary for children“ is still 
adequate.

Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
The MAH has sufficiently addressed the question and provided further data on the four overdosed 
patients. With reference to these and the overall data of paediatric GENA-13 study, no regulatory 
actions must be taken.  
Conclusion 
This point has been solved. 
Question 4 
In the treatment of BEs, a substantial number of efficacy ratings were “moderate” or “none” in both 
pediatric studies, GENA-03 (17.6%) and GENA-13 (16,7%). Though some details are provided about 
none responding subjects from GENA-13, the MAH should display and reflect data of all subjects that 
have not been treated successfully. 
MAH’s responses 
Efficacy of treatment of a bleeding episode was rated as “moderate” in 46 (14.8% of all bleeding 
episodes) cases in 15 patients and as “none” in 6 (1.9%) cases in 4 patients. More information on 
these cases is summarised in Additional Listings 2 (for “none” assessments) and Additional Listings 1 
(for all “moderate” assessments), both derived from Listing 16.2.6.3-3 – Part 2. For example, all 
treatments assessed as “none” related to moderate to major bleeding episodes which required at least 
4 infusions. Thus, as it was also the case for “moderate“ assessments, the efficacy rating was in line 
with the criteria provided in the protocol (“requiring more than 2 infusions”). Additional Listing 3 
indicates the efficacy assessment of all bleeding episodes in patients who had at least one bleeding 
episode treatment assessed as “moderate” or “none”. In most cases the other BEs were treated 
successfully. 
One reason of the lower percentage of successfully treated bleeding episodes in children as compared 
to the on-demand study in adults might be that proportion of traumatic bleeding episodes was higher 
in children than in adults (Table 7).

EMA/331905/2017 
Page 19/23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
The MAH further analysed data of unsuccessfully treated pediatric subjects from GENA-13 study 
showing that the number of successfully treated bleeding episodes was comparable to that of pediatric 
subjects from GENA-03 pivotal study. Both studies have substantially higher numbers of traumatic 
bleeding episodes in pediatric subjects as compared to adult subjects included in GENA-01 and -08 
studies which might account for the lower percentage of successfully treated bleeds as suggested by 
the MAH. 
Conclusion 
The point has been resolved. No regulatory action required. 
7.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
In summary, the data reported from the GENA-13 study are not expected to change the favourable 
benefit-risk profile.  It is considered that study data do not have any impact on the current EU SmPC of 
Human-cl rhFVIII (Nuwiq®). No regulatory action required. No additional clarification requested.

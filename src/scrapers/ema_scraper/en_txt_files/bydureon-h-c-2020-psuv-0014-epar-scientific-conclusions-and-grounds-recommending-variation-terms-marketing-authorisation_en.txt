Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for exenatide, the scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
The MAH has within this PSUR procedure provided supplementary information regarding post-
marketing cases of acute renal failure for Bydureon. Based on the post-marketing experience where 
cases of altered renal function, including acute renal failure, worsened chronic renal failure, renal 
impairment, increased serum creatinine during the treatment with Bydureon have been reported 
with a close temporal relationship and positive dechallenge, it is considered that there is sufficient 
information to conclude that a causal relationship between Bydureon and the above mentioned renal 
adverse reactions is at least a reasonable possibility. Therefore, in view of available data regarding 
renal function with the use of Bydureon, the PRAC considered that changes to the product 
information were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Bydureon, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance exenatide is favourable 
subject to the proposed changes to the product information of Bydureon. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation of Bydureon should be varied.

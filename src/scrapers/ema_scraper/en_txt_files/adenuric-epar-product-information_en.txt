1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
ADENURIC 80 mg film-coated tablets 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each tablet contains 80 mg of febuxostat. 
Excipient(s) with known effects: 
Each tablet contains 76.50 mg of lactose (as monohydrate) 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Film-coated tablet (tablet). 
Pale yellow to yellow, film-coated, capsule shaped tablets, engraved with “80” on one side and a score 
line on the other side. 
The score line is only to facilitate breaking for ease of swallowing and not to divide into equal 
doses. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in conditions where urate deposition has already occurred 
(including a history, or presence of, tophus and/or gouty arthritis). 
ADENURIC is indicated in adults. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended oral dose of ADENURIC is 80 mg once daily without regard to food. If serum uric 
acid is > 6 mg/dL (357 µmol/L) after 2-4 weeks, ADENURIC 120 mg once daily may be considered. 
ADENURIC works sufficiently quickly to allow retesting of the serum uric acid after 2 weeks. The 
therapeutic target is to decrease and maintain serum uric acid below 6 mg/dL (357 μmol/L). 
Gout flare prophylaxis of at least 6 months is recommended (see section 4.4). 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in the elderly (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
The efficacy and safety have not been fully evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, see section 5.2). 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
The efficacy and safety of febuxostat has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child Pugh Class C). 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The recommended dose in patients with mild hepatic impairment is 80 mg. Limited information is 
available in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and the efficacy of ADENURIC in children aged below the age of 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Oral use 
ADENURIC should be taken by mouth and can be taken with or without food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see also 
section 4.8). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Cardio-vascular disorders 
In patients with pre-existing major cardiovascular diseases (e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke or 
unstable angina), during the development of the product and in one post registrational study (CARES), 
a higher number of fatal cardiovascular events were observed with febuxostat when compared to 
allopurinol.  
However, in a subsequent post registrational study (FAST), febuxostat was not inferior to allopurinol 
in the incidence of both fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events. 
Treatment of this patient group should be exercised cautiously and they should be monitored regularly. 
For further details on cardiovascular safety of febuxostat refer to section 4.8 and section 5.1. 
Medicinal product allergy / hypersensitivity 
Rare reports of serious allergic/hypersensitivity reactions, including life-threatening Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome, Toxic epidermal necrolysis and acute anaphylactic reaction/shock, have been collected in 
the post-marketing experience. In most cases, these reactions occurred during the first month of 
therapy with febuxostat. Some, but not all of these patients reported renal impairment and/or previous 
hypersensitivity to allopurinol. Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including Drug Reaction with 
Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) were associated with fever, haematological, renal or 
hepatic involvement in some cases. 
Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for symptoms of 
allergic/hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.8). Febuxostat treatment should be immediately 
stopped if serious allergic/hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, occur 
since early withdrawal is associated with a better prognosis. If patient has developed 
allergic/hypersensitivity reactions including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and acute anaphylactic 
reaction/shock, febuxostat must not be re-started in this patient at any time. 
Acute gouty attacks (gout flare) 
Febuxostat treatment should not be started until an acute attack of gout has completely subsided. Gout 
flares may occur during initiation of treatment due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in 
mobilization of urate from tissue deposits (see section 4.8 and 5.1). At treatment initiation with 
febuxostat flare prophylaxis for at least 6 months with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended (see 
section 4.2). 
If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat treatment, it should not be discontinued. The gout flare should 
be managed concurrently as appropriate for the individual patient. Continuous treatment with 
febuxostat decreases frequency and intensity of gout flares. 
Xanthine deposition 
In patients in whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g. malignant disease and its 
treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome) the absolute concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract. As there has been no experience with 
febuxostat, its use in these populations is not recommended. 
Mercaptopurine/azathioprine 
Febuxostat use is not recommended in patients concomitantly treated with 
mercaptopurine/azathioprine as inhibition of xanthine oxidase by febuxostat may cause increased 
plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine/azathioprine that could result in severe toxicity. 
Where the combination cannot be avoided, a reduction of the dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine to 
the 20% or less of the previously prescribed dose is recommended in order to avoid possible 
haematological effects (see sections 4.5 and 5.3). 
The patients should be closely monitored and the dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine should be 
subsequently adjusted based on the evaluation of the therapeutic response and the onset of eventual 
toxic effects. 
Organ transplant recipients 
As there has been no experience in organ transplant recipients, the use of febuxostat in such patients is 
not recommended (see section 5.1). 
Theophylline 
Co-administration of febuxostat 80 mg and theophylline 400mg single dose in healthy subjects 
showed absence of any pharmacokinetic interaction (see section 4.5). Febuxostat 80 mg can be used in 
patients concomitantly treated with theophylline without risk of increasing theophylline plasma levels. 
No data is available for febuxostat 120 mg. 
Liver disorders 
During the combined phase 3 clinical studies, mild liver function test abnormalities were observed in 
patients treated with febuxostat (5.0%). Liver function test is recommended prior to the initiation of 
therapy with febuxostat and periodically thereafter based on clinical judgment (see section 5.1). 
Thyroid disorders 
Increased TSH values (>5.5 µIU/mL) were observed in patients on long-term treatment with 
febuxostat (5.5%) in the long term open label extension studies. Caution is required when febuxostat is 
used in patients with alteration of thyroid function (see section 5.1). 
Lactose 
Febuxostat tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the 
Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. 
Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Mercaptopurine/azathioprine 
On the basis of the mechanism of action of febuxostat on XO inhibition concomitant use is not 
recommended. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these 
drugs leading to myelotoxicity. 
In case of concomitant administration with febuxostat, the dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine should 
be reduced to 20% or less of the previously prescribed dose (see sections 4.4 and 5.3) 
The adequacy of the proposed dose adjustment, which was based on a modelling and simulation 
analysis from preclinical data in rats, was confirmed by the results of a clinical drug-drug interaction 
study in healthy volunteers, receiving azathioprine 100 mg alone and a reduced dose of azathioprine 
(25 mg) in combination with febuxostat (40 or 120 mg). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No 
data is available regarding the safety of febuxostat during other cytotoxic therapy. 
Rosiglitazone/CYP2C8 substrates 
Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro. In a study in healthy subjects, 
coadministration of 120 mg febuxostat QD with a single 4 mg oral dose of rosiglitazone had no effect 
on the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone and its metabolite N-desmethyl rosiglitazone, indicating that 
febuxostat is not a CYP2C8 enzyme inhibitor in vivo. Thus, co-administration of febuxostat with 
rosiglitazone or other CYP2C8 substrates is not expected to require any dose adjustment for those 
compounds. 
Theophylline 
An interaction study in healthy subjects has been performed with febuxostat to evaluate whether the 
inhibition of XO may cause an increase in the theophylline circulating levels as reported with other 
XO inhibitors. The results of the study showed that the co-administration of febuxostat 80 mg QD 
with theophylline 400 mg single dose has no effect on the pharmacokinetics or safety of theophylline. 
Therefore no special caution is advised when febuxostat 80 mg and theophylline are given 
concomitantly. No data is available for febuxostat 120 mg. 
Naproxen and other inhibitors of glucuronidation 
Febuxostat metabolism depends on Uridine Glucuronosyl Transferase (UGT) enzymes. Medicinal 
products that inhibit glucuronidation, such as NSAIDs and probenecid, could in theory affect the 
elimination of febuxostat. In healthy subjects concomitant use of febuxostat and naproxen 250 mg 
twice daily was associated with an increase in febuxostat exposure (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1/2 
26%). In clinical studies the use of naproxen or other NSAIDs/Cox-2 inhibitors was not related to any 
clinically significant increase in adverse events. 
Febuxostat can be co-administered with naproxen with no dose adjustment of febuxostat or naproxen 
being necessary. 
Inducers of glucuronidation 
Potent inducers of UGT enzymes might possibly lead to increased metabolism and decreased efficacy 
of febuxostat. Monitoring of serum uric acid is therefore recommended 1-2 weeks after start of 
treatment with a potent inducer of glucuronidation. Conversely, cessation of treatment of an inducer 
might lead to increased plasma levels of febuxostat. 
Colchicine/indometacin/hydrochlorothiazide/warfarin 
Febuxostat can be co-administered with colchicine or indomethacin with no dose adjustment of 
febuxostat or the co-administered active substance being necessary. 
No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when administered with hydrochlorothiazide. 
No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when administered with febuxostat. Administration of 
febuxostat (80 mg or 120 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
warfarin in healthy subjects. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the co-
administration of febuxostat. 
Desipramine/CYP2D6 substrates 
Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro. In a study in healthy subjects, 
120 mg ADENURIC QD resulted in a mean 22% increase in AUC of desipramine, a CYP2D6 
substrate indicating a potential weak inhibitory effect of febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo. 
Thus, co-administration of febuxostat with other CYP2D6 substrates is not expected to require any 
dose adjustment for those compounds. 
Antacids 
Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide has 
been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately 1 hour) and to cause a 32% decrease in 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Cmax, but no significant change in AUC was observed. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without 
regard to antacid use. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Data on a very limited number of exposed pregnancies have not indicated any adverse effects of 
febuxostat on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/new born child. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development or 
parturition (see section 5.3). The potential risk for human is unknown. Febuxostat should not be used 
during pregnancy. 
Breastfeeding 
It is unknown whether febuxostat is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown 
excretion of this active substance in breast milk and an impaired development of suckling pups. A risk 
to a suckling infant cannot be excluded. Febuxostat should not be used while breastfeeding. 
Fertility 
In animals, reproduction studies up to 48 mg/kg/day showed no dose-dependent adverse effects on 
fertility (see section 5.3). The effect of ADENURIC on human fertility is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Somnolence, dizziness, paraesthesia and blurred vision have been reported with the use of Febuxostat. 
Patients should exercise caution before driving, using machinery or participating in dangerous 
activities until they are reasonably certain that ADENURIC does not adversely affect performance. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical trials (4,072 subjects treated at least with a 
dose from 10 mg to 300 mg), post-authorisation safety studies (FAST study: 3001 subjects treated at 
least with a dose from 80 mg to 120 mg) and post-marketing experience are gout flares, liver function 
abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, dizziness, dyspnoea, rash, pruritus,arthralgia, myalgia, 
pain in extremity,  oedema and fatigue. These adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate in 
severity. Rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to febuxostat, some of which were associated to 
systemic symptoms, and rare events of sudden cardiac death, have occurred in the post-marketing 
experience. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) and rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000) 
adverse reactions occurring in patients treated with febuxostat are listed below. 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

# Adverse reactions coming from post-authorisation safety studies 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to febuxostat, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Toxic 
epidermal necrolysis and anaphylactic reaction/shock, have occurred in the post-marketing experience. 
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic epidermal necrolysis are characterised by progressive skin 
8 
 
  
rashes associated with blisters or mucosal lesions and eye irritation. Hypersensitivity reactions to 
febuxostat can be associated to the following symptoms: skin reactions characterised by infiltrated 
maculopapular eruption, generalised or exfoliative rashes, but also skin lesions, facial oedema, fever, 
haematologic abnormalities such as thrombocytopenia and eosinophilia, and single or multiple organ 
involvement (liver and kidney including tubulointerstitial nephritis) (see section 4.4). 
Gout flares were commonly observed soon after the start of treatment and during the first months. 
Thereafter, the frequency of gout flare decreases in a time-dependent manner. Gout flare prophylaxis 
is recommended (see section 4.2 and 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Patients with an overdose should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antigout preparation, preparations inhibiting uric acid production, ATC 
code: M04AA03 
Mechanism of action 
Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism in humans and is generated in the cascade of 
hypoxanthine →  xanthine →  uric acid. Both steps in the above transformations are catalyzed by 
xanthine oxidase (XO). Febuxostat is a 2-arylthiazole derivative that achieves its therapeutic effect of 
decreasing serum uric acid by selectively inhibiting XO. Febuxostat is a potent, non-purine selective 
inhibitor of XO (NP-SIXO) with an in vitro inhibition Ki value less than one nanomolar. Febuxostat 
has been shown to potently inhibit both the oxidized and reduced forms of XO. At therapeutic 
concentrations febuxostat does not inhibit other enzymes involved in purine or pyrimidine 
metabolism, namely, guanine deaminase, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, orotate 
phosphoribosyltransferase, orotidine monophosphate decarboxylase or purine nucleoside 
phosphorylase. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of ADENURIC was demonstrated in three Phase 3 pivotal studies (the two pivotal APEX 
and FACT studies, and the additional CONFIRMS study described below) that were conducted in 
4101 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout. In each phase 3 pivotal study, ADENURIC demonstrated 
superior ability to lower and maintain serum uric acid levels compared to allopurinol. The primary 
efficacy endpoint in the APEX and FACT studies was the proportion of patients whose last 3 monthly 
serum uric acid levels were < 6.0 mg/dL (357 µmol/L). In the additional phase 3 CONFIRMS study, 
for which results became available after the marketing authorisation for ADENURIC was first issued, 
the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients whose serum urate level was < 6.0 mg/dL 
at the final visit. No patients with organ transplant have been included in these studies (see section 
4.2). 
APEX Study: The Allopurinol and Placebo-Controlled Efficacy Study of Febuxostat (APEX) was a 
Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, 28-week study. One thousand and seventy-two (1072) 
patients were randomized: placebo (n=134), ADENURIC 80 mg QD (n=267), ADENURIC 120 mg 
QD (n=269), ADENURIC 240 mg QD (n=134) or allopurinol (300 mg QD [n=258] for patients with a 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
baseline serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL or 100 mg QD [n=10] for patients with a baseline serum 
creatinine >1.5 mg/dL and 2.0 mg/dL). Two hundred and forty mg febuxostat (2 times the 
recommended highest dose) was used as a safety evaluation dose. 
The APEX study showed statistically significant superiority of both the ADENURIC 80 mg QD and 
the ADENURIC 120 mg QD treatment arms versus the conventionally used doses of allopurinol 
300 mg (n = 258) /100 mg (n = 10) treatment arm in reducing the sUA below 6 mg/dL (357 µmol/L) 
(see Table 2 and Figure 1). 
FACT Study: The Febuxostat Allopurinol Controlled Trial (FACT) Study was a Phase 3, randomized, 
double-blind, multicenter, 52-week study. Seven hundred sixty (760) patients were randomized: 
ADENURIC 80 mg QD (n=256), ADENURIC 120 mg QD (n=251), or allopurinol 300 mg QD 
(n=253). 
The FACT study showed the statistically significant superiority of both ADENURIC 80 mg and 
ADENURIC 120 mg QD treatment arms versus the conventionally used dose of allopurinol 300 mg 
treatment arm in reducing and maintaining sUA below 6 mg/dL (357 µmol/L).

The ability of ADENURIC to lower serum uric acid levels was prompt and persistent. Reduction in 
serum uric acid level to <6.0 mg/dL (357 µmol/L) was noted by the Week 2 visit and was maintained 
throughout treatment. The mean serum uric acid levels over time for each treatment group from the 
two pivotal Phase 3 studies are shown in Figure 1.

Note: 509 patients received allopurinol 300 mg QD; 10 patients with serum creatinine >1.5 and 
≤2.0 mg/dL were dosed with 100 mg QD. (10 patients out of 268 in APEX study). 
240 mg febuxostat was used to evaluate the safety of febuxostat at twice the recommended 
highest dose. 
CONFIRMS Study: The CONFIRMS study was a Phase 3, randomized, controlled, 26-week study to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of febuxostat 40 mg and 80 mg, in comparison with allopurinol 
300 mg or 200 mg, in patients with gout and hyperuricaemia. Two thousand and two hundred-sixty 
nine (2269) patients were randomized: ADENURIC 40 mg QD (n=757), ADENURIC 80 mg QD 
(n=756), or allopurinol 300/200 mg QD (n=756). At least 65% of the patients had mild-moderate renal 
impairment (with creatinine clearance of 30-89 mL/min). Prophylaxis against gout flares was 
obligatory over the 26-week period. 
The proportion of patients with serum urate levels of < 6.0 mg/dL (357 µmol/L) at the final visit, was 
45% for 40 mg febuxostat, 67% for febuxostat 80 mg and 42% for allopurinol 300/200 mg, 
respectively. 
Primary endpoint in the sub-group of patients with renal impairment 
The APEX Study evaluated efficacy in 40 patients with renal impairment (i.e., baseline serum 
creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL and 2.0 mg/dL). For renally impaired subjects who were randomized to 
allopurinol, the dose was capped at 100 mg QD. ADENURIC achieved the primary efficacy endpoint 
in 44% (80 mg QD), 45% (120 mg QD), and 60% (240 mg QD) of patients compared to 0% in the 
allopurinol 100 mg QD and placebo groups. 
There were no clinically significant differences in the percent decrease in serum uric acid 
concentration in healthy subjects irrespective of their renal function (58% in the normal renal function 
group and 55% in the severe renal dysfunction group). 
An analysis in patients with gout and renal impairment was prospectively defined in the CONFIRMS 
study, and showed that febuxostat was significantly more efficacious in lowering serum urate levels to 
< 6 mg/dL compared to allopurinol 300 mg/200 mg in patients who had gout with mild to moderate 
renal impairment (65% of patients studied). 
Primary endpoint in the sub group of patients with sUA ≥ 10 mg/dL 
Approximately 40% of patients (combined APEX and FACT) had a baseline sUA of ≥ 10 mg/dL. In 
this subgroup ADENURIC achieved the primary efficacy endpoint (sUA < 6.0 mg/dL at the last 3 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
visits) in 41% (80 mg QD), 48% (120 mg QD), and 66% (240 mg QD) of patients compared to 9% in 
the allopurinol 300 mg/100 mg QD and 0 % in the placebo groups. 
In the CONFIRMS study, the proportion of patients achieving the primary efficacy endpoint (sUA < 
6.0 mg/dL at the final visit) for patients with a baseline serum urate level of ≥ 10 mg/dL treated with 
febuxostat 40 mg QD was 27% (66/249), with febuxostat 80 mg QD 49% (125/254) and with 
allopurinol 300 mg/200 mg QD 31% (72/230), respectively. 
Clinical Outcomes: proportion of patients requiring treatment for a gout flare 
APEX study: During the 8-week prophylaxis period, a greater proportion of subjects in the febuxostat 
120 mg (36%) treatment group required treatment for gout flare compared to febuxostat 80 mg (28%), 
allopurinol 300 mg (23%) and placebo (20%). Flares increased following the prophylaxis period and 
gradually decreased over time. Between 46% and 55% of subjects received treatment for gout flares 
from Week 8 and Week 28. Gout flares during the last 4 weeks of the study (Weeks 24-28) were 
observed in 15% (febuxostat 80, 120 mg), 14% (allopurinol 300 mg) and 20% (placebo) of subjects. 
FACT study: During the 8-week prophylaxis period, a greater proportion of subjects in the febuxostat 
120 mg (36%) treatment group required treatment for a gout flare compared to both the febuxostat 
80 mg (22%) and allopurinol 300 mg (21%) treatment groups. After the 8-week prophylaxis period, 
the incidences of flares increased and gradually decreased over time (64% and 70% of subjects 
received treatment for gout flares from Week 8-52). Gout flares during the last 4 weeks of the study 
(Weeks 49-52) were observed in 6-8% (febuxostat 80 mg, 120 mg) and 11% (allopurinol 300 mg) of 
subjects. 
The proportion of subjects requiring treatment for a gout flare (APEX and FACT Study) was 
numerically lower in the groups that achieved an average post-baseline serum urate level <6.0 mg/dL, 
<5.0 mg/dL, or <4.0 mg/dL compared to the group that achieved an average post-baseline serum urate 
level ≥6.0 mg/dL during the last 32 weeks of the treatment period (Week 20-Week 24 to Week 49 - 52 
intervals). 
During the CONFIRMS study, the percentages of patients who required treatment for gout flares (Day 
1 through Month 6) were 31% and 25% for the febuxostat 80 mg and allopurinol groups, respectively. 
No difference in the proportion of patients requiring treatment for gout flares was observed between 
the febuxostat 80 mg and 40 mg groups. 
Long-term, open label extension Studies 
EXCEL Study (C02-021): The Excel study was a three years Phase 3, open label, multicenter, 
randomised, allopurinol-controlled, safety extension study for patients who had completed the pivotal 
Phase 3 studies (APEX or FACT).  A total of 1,086 patients were enrolled: ADENURIC 80 mg QD 
(n=649), Adenuric 120 mg QD (n=292) and allopurinol 300/100 mg QD (n=145). About 69 % of 
patients required no treatment change to achieve a final stable treatment. Patients who had 3 
consecutive sUA levels >6.0 mg/dL were withdrawn. 
Serum urate levels were maintained over time (i.e. 91% and 93% of patients on initial treatment  with 
febuxostat 80 mg and 120 mg, respectively, had sUA <6 mg/dL at Month 36). 
Three years data showed a decrease in the incidence of gout flares with less than 4% of patients 
requiring treatment for a flare (i.e. more than 96% of patients did not require treatment for a flare) at 
Month 16-24 and at Month 30-36. 
46% and 38%, of patients on final stable treatment of febuxostat 80 or 120 mg QD, respectively, had 
complete resolution of the primary palpable tophus from baseline to the Final Visit. 
FOCUS Study (TMX-01-005) was a 5 years Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, safety extension study 
for patients who had completed the febuxostat 4 weeks of double blind dosing in study TMX-00-004. 
116 patients were enrolled and received initially febuxostat 80 mg QD. 62% of patients required no 
dose adjustment to maintain sUA <6 mg/dL and 38% of patients required a dose adjustment to achieve 
a final stable dose. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The proportion of patients with serum urate levels of <6.0 mg/dL (357 µmol/L) at the final visit was 
greater than 80% (81-100%) at each febuxostat dose. 
During the phase 3 clinical studies, mild liver function test abnormalities were observed in patients 
treated with febuxostat (5.0%). These rates were similar to the rates reported on allopurinol (4.2%) 
(see section 4.4). Increased TSH values (>5.5 µIU/mL) were observed in patients on long-term 
treatment with febuxostat (5.5%) and patients with allopurinol (5.8%) in the long term open label 
extension studies (see section 4.4). 
Post Marketing long term studies 
CARES Study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, non inferiority trial comparing CV 
outcomes with febuxostat versus allopurinol in patients with gout and a history of major CV 
disease including MI, hospitalization for unstable angina, coronary or cerebral revascularization 
procedure, stroke, hospitalized transient ischemic attack, peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes 
mellitus with evidence of microvascular or macrovascular disease. To achieve sUA less than 6 
mg/dL, the dose of febuxostat was titrated from 40 mg up to 80 mg (regardless of renal 
function) and the dose of allopurinol was titrated in 100 mg increments from 300 to 600 mg in 
patients with normal renal function and mild renal impairment and from 200 to 400 mg in 
patients with moderate renal impairment. 
The primary endpoint in CARES was the time to first occurrence of MACE, a composite of non-fatal 
MI, non-fatal stroke, CV death and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. 
The endpoints (primary and secondary) were analysed according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) 
analysis including all subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of double-blind 
study medication. 
Overall 56.6% of patients discontinued trial treatment prematurely and 45% of patients did not 
complete all trial visits. 
In total, 6,190 patients were followed for a median of 32 months and the median duration of exposure 
was 728 days for patients in febuxostat group (n 3098) and 719 days in allopurinol group (n 3092). 
The primary MACE endpoint occurred at similar rates in the febuxostat and allopurinol treatment 
groups (10.8% vs. 10.4% of patients, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 1.03; two-sided repeated 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 0.89-1.21). 
In the analysis of the individual components of MACE, the rate of CV deaths was higher with 
febuxostat than allopurinol (4.3% vs. 3.2% of patients; HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.03-1.73). The rates of the 
other MACE events were similar in the febuxostat and allopurinol groups, i.e. non-fatal MI (3.6% vs. 
3.8% of patients; HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.72-1.21), non-fatal stroke (2.3% vs. 2.3% of patients; HR 1.01; 
95% CI 0.73-1.41) and urgent revascularization due to unstable angina (1.6% vs. 1.8% of patients; 
HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.59-1.26).  The rate of all-cause mortality was also higher with febuxostat than 
allopurinol (7.8% vs. 6.4% of patients; HR 1.22; 95% CI 1.01-1.47), which was mainly driven by the 
higher rate of CV deaths in that group (see section 4.4). 
Rates of adjudicated hospitalization for heart failure, hospital admissions for arrhythmias not 
associated with ischemia, venous thromboembolic events and hospitalization for transient ischemic 
attacks were comparable for febuxostat and allopurinol. 
FAST study was a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint study comparing the CV 
safety profile of febuxostat versus allopurinol in patients with chronic hyperuricaemia (in conditions 
where urate deposition had already occurred) and CV risk factors (i.e. patients 60 years or older and 
with at least one other CV risk factor). Eligible patients received allopurinol treatment prior to 
randomization, and dose adjustments were required when needed, according to clinical judgement, 
EULAR recommendations and the approved posology. At the end of the allopurinol lead-in phase, 
patients with a sUA level of <0.36 mmol/L (<6 mg/dL) or receiving the maximum tolerated dose or 
the maximum licensed dose of allopurinol were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either febuxostat 
or allopurinol treatment. The primary endpoint of the study FAST was the time to the first occurrence 
of any event included in the Antiplatelet Trialists’ Collaborative (APTC) composite endpoint, which 
included: i) hospitalisation for non-fatal MI/biomarker positive acute coronary syndrome (ACS); ii) 
non-fatal stroke; iii) death due to a CV event. The primary analysis was based on the on-treatment 
(OT) approach. 
13 
 
 
 
 
Overall, 6,128 patients were randomized, 3063 to febuxostat and 3065 to allopurinol.  
In the primary OT analysis, febuxostat was non-inferior to allopurinol in the incidence of the primary 
endpoint, which occurred in 172 patients (1.72/100 patient years) on febuxostat compared to 241 
patients (2.05/100 patient years) on allopurinol, with an adjusted HR 0.85 (95% CI: 0.70, 1.03), 
p<0.001. The OT analysis for the primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with a history of MI, 
stroke or ACS showed no significant difference between treatment groups: there were 65 (9.5%) 
patients with events in the febuxostat group and 83 (11.8%) patients with events in the allopurinol 
group; adjusted HR 1.02 (95% CI: 0.74-1.42); p=0.202. 
Treatment with febuxostat was not associated with an increase in CV death or all-cause death, overall 
or in the subgroup of patients with a baseline history of MI, stroke or ACS. Overall, there were fewer 
deaths in the febuxostat group (62 CV deaths and 108 all-cause deaths), than in the allopurinol group 
(82 CV deaths and 174 all-cause deaths). 
There was a greater reduction in uric acid levels on febuxostat treatment compared to allopurinol 
treatment. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
In healthy subjects, maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration 
time curve (AUC) of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple 
doses of 10 mg to 120 mg. For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, a greater than dose proportional 
increase in AUC is observed for febuxostat. There is no appreciable accumulation when doses of 
10 mg to 240 mg are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal 
elimination half-life (t1/2) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. 
Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses were conducted in 211 patients with 
hyperuricaemia and gout, treated with ADENURIC 40-240 mg QD. In general, febuxostat 
pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by these analyses are consistent with those obtained from 
healthy subjects, indicating that healthy subjects are representative for 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assessment in the patient population with gout. 
Absorption 
Febuxostat is rapidly (tmax of 1.0-1.5 h) and well absorbed (at least 84%). After single or multiple oral 
80 and 120 mg once daily doses, Cmax is approximately 2.8-3.2 µg/mL, and 5.0-5.3 µg/mL, 
respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet formulation has not been studied. 
Following multiple oral 80 mg once daily doses or a single 120 mg dose with a high fat meal, there 
was a 49% and 38% decrease in Cmax and a 18% and 16% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no 
clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed 
where tested (80 mg multiple dose). Thus, ADENURIC may be taken without regard to food. 
Distribution 
The apparent steady state volume of distribution (Vss/F) of febuxostat ranges from 29 to 75 L after oral 
doses of 10-300 mg. The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2%, (primarily to 
albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 80 and 120 mg doses. Plasma 
protein binding of the active metabolites ranges from about 82% to 91%. 
Biotransformation 
Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 
(UDPGT) enzyme system and oxidation via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Four 
pharmacologically active hydroxyl metabolites have been identified, of which three occur in plasma of 
humans. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that those oxidative metabolites were 
formed primarily by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9 and febuxostat glucuronide was 
formed mainly by UGT 1A1, 1A8, and 1A9. 
Elimination 
Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14C-
labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3%), the acyl glucuronide of the active substance (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their 
conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, 
approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the faeces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the 
acyl glucuronide of the active substance (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates 
(25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). 
Renal impairment 
Following multiple doses of 80 mg of ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal 
impairment, the Cmax of febuxostat did not change, relative to subjects with normal renal function. The 
mean total AUC of febuxostat increased by approximately 1.8-fold from 7.5 gh/mL in the normal 
renal function group to 13.2 g.h/mL in the severe renal dysfunction group. The Cmax and AUC of 
active metabolites increased up to 2- and 4-fold, respectively. However, no dose adjustment is 
necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Following multiple doses of 80 mg of ADENURIC in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or 
moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, the Cmax and AUC of febuxostat and its 
metabolites did not change significantly compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. No 
studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). 
Age 
There were no significant changes observed in AUC of febuxostat or its metabolites following 
multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in elderly as compared to younger healthy subjects. 
Gender 
Following multiple oral doses of ADENURIC, the Cmax and AUC were 24% and 12% higher in 
females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected Cmax and AUC were similar between 
the genders. No dose adjustment is needed based on gender. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Effects in non-clinical studies were generally observed at exposures in excess of the maximum human 
exposure. 
Pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation of rat data suggests that, when co-administered with 
febuxostat, the clinical dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine should be reduced to 20% or less of the 
previously prescribed dose in order to avoid possible haematological effects (see section 4.4 and 4.5). 
Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility 
In male rats, a statistically significant increase in urinary bladder tumours (transitional cell papilloma 
and carcinoma) was found only in association with xanthine calculi in the high dose group, at 
approximately 11 times human exposure. There was no significant increase in any other tumour type 
in either male or female mice or rats. These findings are considered a consequence of species specific 
purine metabolism and urine composition and of no relevance to clinical use. 
A standard battery of test for genotoxicity did not reveal any biologically relevant genotoxic effects 
for febuxostat. 
Febuxostat at oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive 
performance of male and female rats. 
There was no evidence of impaired fertility, teratogenic effects, or harm to the foetus due to 
febuxostat. There was high dose maternal toxicity accompanied by a reduction in weaning index and 
reduced development of offspring in rats at approximately 4.3 times human exposure. Teratology 
studies, performed in pregnant rats at approximately 4.3 times and pregnant rabbits at approximately 
13 times human exposure did not reveal any teratogenic effects.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
ADENURIC is indicated for the treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in conditions where urate 
deposition has already occurred (including a history, or presence of, tophus and/or gouty arthritis). 
ADENURIC is indicated for the prevention and treatment of hyperuricaemia in adult patients 
undergoing chemotherapy for haematologic malignancies at intermediate to high risk of Tumor Lysis 
Syndrome (TLS). 
ADENURIC is indicated in adults. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Gout: The recommended oral dose of ADENURIC is 80 mg once daily without regard to food. If 
serum uric acid is > 6 mg/dL (357 µmol/L) after 2-4 weeks, ADENURIC 120 mg once daily may be 
considered. 
ADENURIC works sufficiently quickly to allow retesting of the serum uric acid after 2 weeks. The 
therapeutic target is to decrease and maintain serum uric acid below 6 mg/dL (357μmol/L). 
Gout flare prophylaxis of at least 6 months is recommended (see section 4.4). 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The recommended oral dose of ADENURIC is 120 mg once daily without 
regard to food. 
ADENURIC should be started two days before the beginning of cytotoxic therapy and continued for a 
minimum of 7 days; however treatment may be prolonged up to 9 days according to chemotherapy 
duration as per clinical judgment. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in the elderly (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
The efficacy and safety have not been fully evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, see section 5.2). 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
The efficacy and safety of febuxostat has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child Pugh Class C). 
Gout: The recommended dose in patients with mild hepatic impairment is 80 mg. Limited information 
is available in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 
Tumour Lysis Syndrome: in the pivotal Phase III trial (FLORENCE) only subjects with severe hepatic 
insufficiency were excluded from trial participation. No dose adjustment was required for enrolled 
patients on the basis of hepatic function. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and the efficacy of ADENURIC in children aged below the age of 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Oral use 
ADENURIC should be taken by mouth and can be taken with or without food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see also 
section 4.8). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Cardio-vascular disorders 
Treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia 
In patients with pre-existing major cardiovascular diseases (e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke or 
unstable angina), during the development of the product and in one post registrational study (CARES), 
a higher number of fatal cardiovascular events were observed with febuxostat when compared to 
allopurinol.  
However, in a subsequent post registrational study (FAST), febuxostat was not inferior to allopurinol 
in the incidence of both fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events. 
Treatment of this patient group should be exercised cautiously and they should be monitored regularly. 
For further details on cardiovascular safety of febuxostat refer to section 4.8 and section 5.1. 
Prevention and treatment of hyperuricaemia in patients at risk of TLS 
Patients undergoing chemotherapy for haematologic malignancies at intermediate to high risk of 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome treated with ADENURIC should be under cardiac monitoring as clinically 
appropriate. 
Medicinal product allergy / hypersensitivity 
Rare reports of serious allergic/hypersensitivity reactions, including life-threatening Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome, Toxic epidermal necrolysis and acute anaphylactic reaction/shock, have been collected in 
the post-marketing experience. In most cases, these reactions occurred during the first month of 
therapy with febuxostat. Some, but not all of these patients reported renal impairment and/or previous 
hypersensitivity to allopurinol. Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including Drug Reaction with 
Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) were associated with fever, haematological, renal or 
hepatic involvement in some cases. 
Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for symptoms of 
allergic/hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.8). Febuxostat treatment should be immediately 
stopped if serious allergic/hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, occur 
since early withdrawal is associated with a better prognosis. If patient has developed 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
allergic/hypersensitivity reactions including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and acute anaphylactic 
reaction/shock, febuxostat must not be re-started in this patient at any time. 
Acute gouty attacks (gout flare) 
Febuxostat treatment should not be started until an acute attack of gout has completely subsided. Gout 
flares may occur during initiation of treatment due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in 
mobilization of urate from tissue deposits (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). At treatment initiation with 
febuxostat flare prophylaxis for at least 6 months with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended (see 
section 4.2). 
If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat treatment, it should not be discontinued. The gout flare should 
be managed concurrently as appropriate for the individual patient. Continuous treatment with 
febuxostat decreases frequency and intensity of gout flares. 
Xanthine deposition 
In patients in whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g. malignant disease and its 
treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome) the absolute concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, 
rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract. This has not been observed in the pivotal 
clinical study with ADENURIC in the Tumor Lysis Syndrome. As there has been no experience with 
febuxostat, its use in patients with Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome is not recommended. 
Mercaptopurine/azathioprine 
Febuxostat use is not recommended in patients concomitantly treated with 
mercaptopurine/azathioprine as inhibition of xanthine oxidase by febuxostat may cause increased 
plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine/azathioprine that could result in severe toxicity. 
Where the combination cannot be avoided, a reduction of the dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine to 
the 20% or less of the previously prescribed dose is recommended in order to avoid possible 
haematological effects (see sections 4.5 and 5.3). 
The patients should be closely monitored and the dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine should be 
subsequently adjusted based on the evaluation of the therapeutic response and the onset of eventual 
toxic effects. 
Organ transplant recipients 
As there has been no experience in organ transplant recipients, the use of febuxostat in such patients is 
not recommended (see section 5.1). 
Theophylline 
Co-administration of febuxostat 80 mg and theophylline 400mg single dose in healthy subjects 
showed absence of any pharmacokinetic interaction (see section 4.5). Febuxostat 80 mg can be used in 
patients concomitantly treated with theophylline without risk of increasing theophylline plasma levels. 
No data is available for febuxostat 120 mg. 
Liver disorders 
During the combined phase 3 clinical studies, mild liver function test abnormalities were observed in 
patients treated with febuxostat (5.0%). Liver function test is recommended prior to the initiation of 
therapy with febuxostat and periodically thereafter based on clinical judgment (see section 5.1). 
Thyroid disorders 
Increased TSH values (>5.5 µIU/mL) were observed in patients on long-term treatment with 
febuxostat (5.5%) in the long term open label extension studies. Caution is required when febuxostat is 
used in patients with alteration of thyroid function (see section 5.1). 
Lactose 
Febuxostat tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the 
Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.

Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Mercaptopurine/azathioprine 
On the basis of the mechanism of action of febuxostat on XO inhibition concomitant use is not 
recommended. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these 
drugs leading to myelotoxicity. 
In case of concomitant administration with febuxostat, the dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine should 
be reduced to the 20% or less of the previously prescribed dose (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). 
The adequacy of the proposed dose adjustment, which was based on a modelling and simulation 
analysis from preclinical data in rats, was confirmed by the results of a clinical drug-drug interaction 
study in healthy volunteers, receiving azathioprine 100 mg alone and a reduced dose of azathioprine 
(25 mg) in combination with febuxostat (40 or 120 mg). 
Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. 
In the Tumor Lysis Syndrome pivotal trial febuxostat 120 mg daily was administered to patients 
undergoing several chemotherapy regimens, including monoclonal antibodies. However, drug-drug 
and drug-disease interactions were not explored during this study. Therefore, possible interactions 
with any concomitantly administered cytotoxic drug cannot be ruled out. 
Rosiglitazone/CYP2C8 substrates 
Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro. In a study in healthy subjects, 
coadministration of 120 mg febuxostat QD with a single 4 mg oral dose of rosiglitazone had no effect 
on the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone and its metabolite N-desmethyl rosiglitazone, indicating that 
febuxostat is not a CYP2C8 enzyme inhibitor in vivo. Thus, co-administration of febuxostat with 
rosiglitazone or other CYP2C8 substrates is not expected to require any dose adjustment for those 
compounds. 
Theophylline 
An interaction study in healthy subjects has been performed with febuxostat to evaluate whether the 
inhibition of XO may cause an increase in the theophylline circulating levels as reported with other 
XO inhibitors. The results of the study showed that the co-administration of febuxostat 80 mg QD 
with theophylline 400 mg single dose has no effect on the pharmacokinetics or safety of theophylline. 
Therefore no special caution is advised when febuxostat 80 mg and theophylline are given 
concomitantly. No data is available for febuxostat 120 mg. 
Naproxen and other inhibitors of glucuronidation 
Febuxostat metabolism depends on Uridine Glucuronosyl Transferase (UGT) enzymes. Medicinal 
products that inhibit glucuronidation, such as NSAIDs and probenecid, could in theory affect the 
elimination of febuxostat. In healthy subjects concomitant use of febuxostat and naproxen 250mg 
twice daily was associated with an increase in febuxostat exposure (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1/2 
26%). In clinical studies the use of naproxen or other NSAIDs/Cox-2 inhibitors was not related to any 
clinically significant increase in adverse events. 
Febuxostat can be co-administered with naproxen with no dose adjustment of febuxostat or naproxen 
being necessary. 
Inducers of glucuronidation 
Potent inducers of UGT enzymes might possibly lead to increased metabolism and decreased efficacy 
of febuxostat. Monitoring of serum uric acid is therefore recommended 1-2 weeks after start of 
treatment with a potent inducer of glucuronidation. Conversely, cessation of treatment of an inducer 
might lead to increased plasma levels of febuxostat. 
Colchicine/indometacin/hydrochlorothiazide/warfarin 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Febuxostat can be co-administered with colchicine or indomethacin with no dose adjustment of 
febuxostat or the co-administered active substance being necessary. 
No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when administered with hydrochlorothiazide. 
No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when administered with febuxostat. Administration of 
febuxostat (80 mg or 120 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
warfarin in healthy subjects. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the co-
administration of febuxostat. 
Desipramine/CYP2D6 substrates 
Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro. In a study in healthy subjects, 
120 mg ADENURIC QD resulted in a mean 22% increase in AUC of desipramine, a CYP2D6 
substrate indicating a potential weak inhibitory effect of febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo. 
Thus, co-administration of febuxostat with other CYP2D6 substrates is not expected to require any 
dose adjustment for those compounds. 
Antacids 
Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide has 
been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately 1 hour) and to cause a 32% decrease in 
Cmax, but no significant change in AUC was observed. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without 
regard to antacid use. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Data on a very limited number of exposed pregnancies have not indicated any adverse effects of 
febuxostat on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/new born child. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development or 
parturition (see section 5.3). The potential risk for human is unknown. Febuxostat should not be used 
during pregnancy. 
Breastfeeding 
It is unknown whether febuxostat is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown 
excretion of this active substance in breast milk and an impaired development of suckling pups. A risk 
to a suckling infant cannot be excluded. Febuxostat should not be used while breastfeeding. 
Fertility 
In animals, reproduction studies up to 48 mg/kg/day showed no dose-dependent adverse effects on 
fertility (see section 5.3). The effect of ADENURIC on human fertility is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Somnolence, dizziness, paraesthesia and blurred vision have been reported with the use of Febuxostat. 
Patients should exercise caution before driving, using machinery or participating in dangerous 
activities until they are reasonably certain that ADENURIC does not adversely affect performance. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical trials (4,072 subjects treated at least with a 
dose from 10 mg to 300 mg), post-authorisation safety studies (FAST study: 3001 subjects treated at 
least with a dose from 80 mg to 120 mg) and post-marketing experience in gout patients are gout 
flares, liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, dizziness, dyspnoea, rash, 
pruritus,arthralgia, myalgia, pain in extremity,  oedema and fatigue. These adverse reactions were 
mostly mild or moderate in severity. Rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to febuxostat, some of

# Adverse reactions coming from post-authorisation safety studies 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to febuxostat, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Toxic 
epidermal necrolysis and anaphylactic reaction/shock, have occurred in the post-marketing experience. 
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic epidermal necrolysis are characterised by progressive skin 
rashes associated with blisters or mucosal lesions and eye irritation. Hypersensitivity reactions to 
febuxostat can be associated to the following symptoms: skin reactions characterised by infiltrated 
maculopapular eruption, generalised or exfoliative rashes, but also skin lesions, facial oedema, fever, 
haematologic abnormalities such as thrombocytopenia and eosinophilia, and single or multiple organ 
involvement (liver and kidney including tubulointerstitial nephritis) (see section 4.4). 
Gout flares were commonly observed soon after the start of treatment and during the first months. 
Thereafter, the frequency of gout flare decreases in a time-dependent manner. Gout flare prophylaxis 
is recommended (see section 4.2 and 4.4). 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
Summary of the safety profile 
In the randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 pivotal FLORENCE (FLO-01) study comparing febuxostat 
with allopurinol (346 patients undergoing chemotherapy for haematologic malignancies and at 
intermediate-to-high risk of TLS), only 22 (6.4%) patients overall experienced adverse reactions, 
namely 11 (6.4%) patients in each treatment group. The majority of adverse reactions were either mild 
or moderate. 
Overall, the FLORENCE trial did not highlight any particular safety concern in addition to the 
previous experience with ADENURIC in gout, with the exception of the following three adverse 
reactions (listed above in table 1). 
Cardiac disorders:  
Uncommon: Left bundle branch block, sinus tachycardia 
Vascular disorders:  
Uncommon: haemorrhage 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antigout preparation, preparations inhibiting uric acid production, ATC 
code: M04AA03 
Mechanism of action 
Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism in humans and is generated in the cascade of 
hypoxanthine →  xanthine →  uric acid. Both steps in the above transformations are catalyzed by 
xanthine oxidase (XO). Febuxostat is a 2-arylthiazole derivative that achieves its therapeutic effect of 
decreasing serum uric acid by selectively inhibiting XO. Febuxostat is a potent, non-purine selective 
inhibitor of XO (NP-SIXO) with an in vitro inhibition Ki value less than one nanomolar. Febuxostat 
has been shown to potently inhibit both the oxidized and reduced forms of XO. At therapeutic 
concentrations febuxostat does not inhibit other enzymes involved in purine or pyrimidine 
metabolism, namely, guanine deaminase, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, orotate 
phosphoribosyltransferase, orotidine monophosphate decarboxylase or purine nucleoside 
phosphorylase. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Gout 
The efficacy of ADENURIC was demonstrated in three Phase 3 pivotal studies (the two pivotal APEX 
and FACT studies, and the additional CONFIRMS study, described below) that were conducted in 
4101 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout. In each phase 3 pivotal study, ADENURIC demonstrated 
superior ability to lower and maintain serum uric acid levels compared to allopurinol. The primary 
efficacy endpoint in the APEX and FACT studies was the proportion of patients whose last 3 monthly 
serum uric acid levels were < 6.0 mg/dL (357 µmol/L). In the additional phase 3 CONFIRMS study, 
for which results became available after the marketing authorisation for ADENURIC was first issued, 
the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients whose serum urate level was < 6.0 mg/dL 
at the final visit. No patients with organ transplant have been included in these studies (see section 
4.2). 
APEX Study: The Allopurinol and Placebo-Controlled Efficacy Study of Febuxostat (APEX) was a 
Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, 28-week study. One thousand and seventy-two (1072) 
patients were randomized: placebo (n=134), ADENURIC 80 mg QD (n=267), ADENURIC 120 mg 
QD (n=269), ADENURIC 240 mg QD (n=134) or allopurinol (300 mg QD [n=258] for patients with a 
baseline serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL or 100 mg QD [n=10] for patients with a baseline serum 
creatinine >1.5 mg/dL and 2.0 mg/dL). Two hundred and forty mg febuxostat (2 times the 
recommended highest dose) was used as a safety evaluation dose. 
The APEX study showed statistically significant superiority of both the ADENURIC 80 mg QD and 
the ADENURIC 120 mg QD treatment arms versus the conventionally used doses of allopurinol 
300 mg (n = 258) /100 mg (n = 10) treatment arm in reducing the sUA below 6 mg/dL (357 µmol/L) 
(see Table 2 and Figure 1). 
FACT Study: The Febuxostat Allopurinol Controlled Trial (FACT) Study was a Phase 3, randomized, 
double-blind, multicenter, 52-week study. Seven hundred sixty (760) patients were randomized: 
ADENURIC 80 mg QD (n=256), ADENURIC 120 mg QD (n=251), or allopurinol 300 mg QD 
(n=253).

The ability of ADENURIC to lower serum uric acid levels was prompt and persistent. Reduction in 
serum uric acid level to <6.0 mg/dL (357 µmol/L) was noted by the Week 2 visit and was maintained 
throughout treatment. The mean serum uric acid levels over time for each treatment group from the 
two pivotal Phase 3 studies are shown in Figure 1.

Note: 509 patients received allopurinol 300 mg QD; 10 patients with serum creatinine >1.5 and 
≤2.0 mg/dL were dosed with 100 mg QD. (10 patients out of 268 in APEX study). 
240 mg febuxostat was used to evaluate the safety of febuxostat at twice the recommended 
highest dose. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONFIRMS Study: The CONFIRMS study was a Phase 3, randomized, controlled, 26-week study to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of febuxostat 40 mg and 80 mg, in comparison with allopurinol 
300 mg or 200 mg, in patients with gout and hyperuricaemia. Two thousand and two hundred-sixty 
nine (2269) patients were randomized: ADENURIC 40 mg QD (n=757), ADENURIC 80 mg QD 
(n=756), or allopurinol 300/200 mg QD (n=756). At least 65% of the patients had mild-moderate renal 
impairment (with creatinine clearance of 30-89 mL/min). Prophylaxis against gout flares was 
obligatory over the 26-week period. 
The proportion of patients with serum urate levels of < 6.0 mg/dL (357 µmol/L) at the final visit, was 
45% for 40 mg febuxostat, 67% for febuxostat 80 mg and 42% for allopurinol 300/200 mg, 
respectively. 
Primary endpoint in the sub-group of patients with renal impairment 
The APEX Study evaluated efficacy in 40 patients with renal impairment (i.e., baseline serum 
creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL and 2.0 mg/dL). For renally impaired subjects who were randomized to 
allopurinol, the dose was capped at 100 mg QD. ADENURIC achieved the primary efficacy endpoint 
in 44% (80 mg QD), 45% (120 mg QD), and 60% (240 mg QD) of patients compared to 0% in the 
allopurinol 100 mg QD and placebo groups. 
There were no clinically significant differences in the percent decrease in serum uric acid 
concentration in healthy subjects irrespective of their renal function (58% in the normal renal function 
group and 55% in the severe renal dysfunction group). 
An analysis in patients with gout and renal impairment was prospectively defined in the CONFIRMS 
study, and showed that febuxostat was significantly more efficacious in lowering serum urate levels to 
< 6 mg/dL compared to allopurinol 300 mg/200 mg in patients who had gout with mild to moderate 
renal impairment (65% of patients studied). 
Primary endpoint in the sub group of patients with sUA ≥ 10 mg/dL 
Approximately 40% of patients (combined APEX and FACT) had a baseline sUA of ≥ 10 mg/dL. In 
this subgroup ADENURIC achieved the primary efficacy endpoint (sUA < 6.0 mg/dL at the last 3 
visits) in 41% (80 mg QD), 48% (120 mg QD), and 66% (240 mg QD) of patients compared to 9% in 
the allopurinol 300 mg/100 mg QD and 0 % in the placebo groups. 
In the CONFIRMS study, the proportion of patients achieving the primary efficacy endpoint (sUA < 
6.0 mg/dL at the final visit) for patients with a baseline serum urate level of ≥ 10 mg/dL treated with 
febuxostat 40 mg QD was 27% (66/249), with febuxostat 80 mg QD 49% (125/254) and with 
allopurinol 300 mg/200 mg QD 31% (72/230), respectively. 
Clinical Outcomes: proportion of patients requiring treatment for a gout flare 
Apex study: During the 8-week prophylaxis period, a greater proportion of subjects in the febuxostat 
120 mg (36%) treatment group required treatment for gout flare compared to febuxostat 80 mg (28%), 
allopurinol 300 mg (23%) and placebo (20%). Flares increased following the prophylaxis period and 
gradually decreased over time. Between 46% and 55% of subjects received treatment for gout flares 
from Week 8 and Week 28. Gout flares during the last 4 weeks of the study (Weeks 24-28) were 
observed in 15% (febuxostat 80, 120 mg), 14% (allopurinol 300 mg) and 20% (placebo) of subjects. 
Fact study: During the 8-week prophylaxis period, a greater proportion of subjects in the febuxostat 
120 mg (36%) treatment group required treatment for a gout flare compared to both the febuxostat 
80 mg (22%) and allopurinol 300 mg (21%) treatment groups. After the 8-week prophylaxis period, 
the incidences of flares increased and gradually decreased over time (64% and 70% of subjects 
received treatment for gout flares from Week 8-52). Gout flares during the last 4 weeks of the study 
(Weeks 49-52) were observed in 6-8% (febuxostat 80 mg, 120 mg) and 11% (allopurinol 300 mg) of 
subjects. 
The proportion of subjects requiring treatment for a gout flare (APEX and FACT Study) was 
numerically lower in the groups that achieved an average post-baseline serum urate level <6.0 mg/dL, 
<5.0 mg/dL, or <4.0 mg/dL compared to the group that achieved an average post-baseline serum urate 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
level ≥6.0 mg/dL during the last 32 weeks of the treatment period (Week 20-Week 24 to Week 49 - 52 
intervals). 
During the CONFIRMS study, the percentages of patients who required treatment for gout flares (Day 
1 through Month 6) were 31% and 25% for the febuxostat 80 mg and allopurinol groups, respectively.  
No difference in the proportion of patients requiring treatment for gout flares was observed between 
the febuxostat 80 mg and 40 mg groups. 
Long-term, open label extension Studies 
EXCEL Study (C02-021): The Excel study was a three years Phase 3, open label, multicenter, 
randomised, allopurinol-controlled, safety extension study for patients who had completed the pivotal 
Phase 3 studies (APEX or FACT). A total of 1,086 patients were enrolled: ADENURIC 80 mg QD 
(n=649), Adenuric 120 mg QD (n=292) and allopurinol 300/100 mg QD (n=145). About 69 % of 
patients required no treatment change to achieve a final stable treatment. Patients who had 3 
consecutive sUA levels >6.0 mg/dL were withdrawn. 
Serum urate levels were maintained over time (i.e. 91% and 93% of patients on initial treatment  with 
febuxostat 80 mg and 120 mg, respectively, had sUA <6 mg/dL at Month 36). 
Three years data showed a decrease in the incidence of gout flares with less than 4% of patients 
requiring treatment for a flare (i.e. more than 96% of patients did not require treatment for a flare) at 
Month 16-24 and at Month 30-36. 
46% and 38%, of patients on final stable treatment of febuxostat 80 or 120 mg QD, respectively, had 
complete resolution of the primary palpable tophus from baseline to the Final Visit. 
FOCUS Study (TMX-01-005) was a 5 years Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, safety extension study 
for patients who had completed the febuxostat 4 weeks of double blind dosing in study TMX-00-004. 
116 patients were enrolled and received initially febuxostat 80 mg QD. 62% of patients required no 
dose adjustment to maintain sUA <6 mg/dL and 38% of patients required a dose adjustment to achieve 
a final stable dose.  
The proportion of patients with serum urate levels of <6.0 mg/dL (357 µmol/L) at the final visit was 
greater than 80% (81-100%) at each febuxostat dose. 
During the phase 3 clinical studies, mild liver function test abnormalities were observed in patients 
treated with febuxostat (5.0%). These rates were similar to the rates reported on allopurinol (4.2%) 
(see section 4.4). Increased TSH values (>5.5 µIU/mL) were observed in patients on long-term 
treatment with febuxostat (5.5%) and patients with allopurinol (5.8%) in the long term open label 
extension studies (see section 4.4). 
Post Marketing long term studies 
CARES Study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, non inferiority trial comparing CV 
outcomes with febuxostat versus allopurinol in patients with gout and a history of major CV 
disease including MI, hospitalization for unstable angina, coronary or cerebral revascularization 
procedure, stroke, hospitalized transient ischemic attack, peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes 
mellitus with evidence of microvascular or macrovascular disease. To achieve sUA less than 6 
mg/dL, the dose of febuxostat was titrated from 40 mg up to 80 mg (regardless of renal 
function) and the dose of allopurinol was titrated in 100 mg increments from 300 to 600 mg in 
patients with normal renal function and mild renal impairment and from 200 to 400 mg in 
patients with moderate renal impairment. 
The primary endpoint in CARES was the time to first occurrence of MACE, a composite of non-fatal 
MI, non-fatal stroke, CV death and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. 
The endpoints (primary and secondary) were analysed according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) 
analysis including all subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of double-blind 
study medication. 
Overall 56.6% of patients discontinued trial treatment prematurely and 45% of patients did not 
complete all trial visits.

In total, 6,190 patients were followed for a median of 32 months and the median duration of exposure 
was 728 days for patients in febuxostat group (n 3098) and 719 days in allopurinol group (n 3092). 
The primary MACE endpoint occurred at similar rates in the febuxostat and allopurinol treatment 
groups (10.8% vs. 10.4% of patients, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 1.03; two-sided repeated 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 0.89-1.21). 
In the analysis of the individual components of MACE, the rate of CV deaths was higher with 
febuxostat than allopurinol (4.3% vs. 3.2% of patients; HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.03-1.73). The rates of the 
other MACE events were similar in the febuxostat and allopurinol groups, i.e. non-fatal MI (3.6% vs. 
3.8% of patients; HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.72-1.21), non-fatal stroke (2.3% vs. 2.3% of patients; HR 1.01; 
95% CI 0.73-1.41) and urgent revascularization due to unstable angina (1.6% vs. 1.8% of patients; 
HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.59-1.26).  The rate of all-cause mortality was also higher with febuxostat than 
allopurinol (7.8% vs. 6.4% of patients; HR 1.22; 95% CI 1.01-1.47), which was mainly driven by the 
higher rate of CV deaths in that group (see section 4.4). 
Rates of adjudicated hospitalization for heart failure, hospital admissions for arrhythmias not 
associated with ischemia, venous thromboembolic events and hospitalization for transient ischemic 
attacks were comparable for febuxostat and allopurinol. 
FAST study was a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint study comparing the CV 
safety profile of febuxostat versus allopurinol in patients with chronic hyperuricaemia (in conditions 
where urate deposition had already occurred) and CV risk factors (i.e. patients 60 years or older and 
with at least one other CV risk factor). Eligible patients received allopurinol treatment prior to 
randomization, and dose adjustments were required when needed, according to clinical judgement, 
EULAR recommendations and the approved posology. At the end of the allopurinol lead-in phase, 
patients with a sUA level of <0.36 mmol/L (<6 mg/dL) or receiving the maximum tolerated dose or 
the maximum licensed dose of allopurinol were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either febuxostat 
or allopurinol treatment. The primary endpoint of the study FAST was the time to the first occurrence 
of any event included in the Antiplatelet Trialists’ Collaborative (APTC) composite endpoint, which 
included: i) hospitalisation for non-fatal MI/biomarker positive acute coronary syndrome (ACS); ii) 
non-fatal stroke; iii) death due to a CV event. The primary analysis was based on the on-treatment 
(OT) approach. 
Overall, 6,128 patients were randomized, 3063 to febuxostat and 3065 to allopurinol.  
In the primary OT analysis, febuxostat was non-inferior to allopurinol in the incidence of the primary 
endpoint, which occurred in 172 patients (1.72/100 patient years) on febuxostat compared to 241 
patients (2.05/100 patient years) on allopurinol, with an adjusted HR 0.85 (95% CI: 0.70, 1.03), 
p<0.001. The OT analysis for the primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with a history of MI, 
stroke or ACS showed no significant difference between treatment groups: there were 65 (9.5%) 
patients with events in the febuxostat group and 83 (11.8%) patients with events in the allopurinol 
group; adjusted HR 1.02 (95% CI: 0.74-1.42); p=0.202. 
Treatment with febuxostat was not associated with an increase in CV death or all-cause death, overall 
or in the subgroup of patients with a baseline history of MI, stroke or ACS. Overall, there were fewer 
deaths in the febuxostat group (62 CV deaths and 108 all-cause deaths), than in the allopurinol group 
(82 CV deaths and 174 all-cause deaths). 
There was a greater reduction in uric acid levels on febuxostat treatment compared to allopurinol 
treatment. 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
The efficacy and safety of ADENURIC in the prevention and treatment of Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
was evaluated in the FLORENCE (FLO-01) study. ADENURIC showed a superior and faster urate 
lowering activity compared to allopurinol. 
FLORENCE was a randomized (1:1), double blind, phase III, pivotal trial comparing ADENURIC 120 
mg once daily with allopurinol 200 to 600 mg daily (mean allopurinol daily dose [± standard deviation]: 
349.7 ± 112.90 mg) in terms of control of serum uric acid level. Eligible patients had to be candidates 
for allopurinol treatment or have no access to rasburicase. Primary endpoints were serum uric acid area 
under the curve (AUC sUA1-8) and change in serum creatinine (sC) level both from baseline to Day 8. 
Overall, 346 patients with haematological malignancies undergoing chemotherapy and at intermediate 
/ high risk of Tumor Lysis Syndrome were included. Mean AUC sUA1-8 (mgxh/dl) was significantly 
lower with ADENURIC (514.0 ± 225.71 vs 708.0 ± 234.42; least square means difference: -196.794 
30 
 
 
[95% confidence interval: -238.600 ; -154.988]; p < .0001). Furthermore, the mean serum uric acid 
level was significantly lower with ADENURIC since the first 24 hours of treatment and at any 
following time point.  No significant difference in mean serum creatinine change (%) occurred 
between ADENURIC and allopurinol (-0.83 ± 26.98 vs -4.92 ± 16.70 respectively; least square means 
difference: 4.0970 [95% confidence interval: -0.6467 ; 8.8406]; p=0.0903). With regard to secondary 
endpoints, no significant difference was detected in terms of incidence of laboratory TLS (8.1% and 
9.2% in ADENURIC and allopurinol arm, respectively; relative risk: 0.875 [95% confidence interval: 
0.4408 ; 1.7369]; p=0.8488) nor of clinical TLS (1.7% and 1.2% in ADENURIC and allopurinol arm, 
respectively; relative risk: 0.994 [95% confidence interval: 0.9691 ; 1.0199]; p=1.0000).  Incidence of 
overall treatment-emergent signs and symptoms and adverse drug reactions was 67.6% vs 64.7% and 
6.4% vs 6.4% with ADENURIC and allopurinol respectively. In the FLORENCE study ADENURIC 
demonstrated a superior control of serum uric acid level compared to allopurinol in patients scheduled 
to receive the latter drug. No data comparing ADENURIC with rasburicase are currently available. 
The efficacy and safety of febuxostat has not been established in patients with acute severe TLS, e.g. 
in patients who failed on other urate lowering therapies. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
In healthy subjects, maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration 
time curve (AUC) of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple 
doses of 10 mg to 120 mg. For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, a greater than dose proportional 
increase in AUC is observed for febuxostat. There is no appreciable accumulation when doses of 
10 mg to 240 mg are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal 
elimination half-life (t1/2) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. 
Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses were conducted in 211 patients with 
hyperuricaemia and gout, treated with ADENURIC 40-240 mg QD. In general, febuxostat 
pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by these analyses are consistent with those obtained from 
healthy subjects, indicating that healthy subjects are representative for 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assessment in the patient population with gout. 
Absorption 
Febuxostat is rapidly (tmax of 1.0-1.5 h) and well absorbed (at least 84%). After single or multiple oral 
80 and 120 mg once daily doses, Cmax is approximately 2.8-3.2 µg/mL, and 5.0-5.3 µg/mL, 
respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet formulation has not been studied. 
Following multiple oral 80 mg once daily doses or a single 120 mg dose with a high fat meal, there 
was a 49% and 38% decrease in Cmax and a 18% and 16% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no 
clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed 
where tested (80 mg multiple dose). Thus, ADENURIC may be taken without regard to food.  
Distribution 
The apparent steady state volume of distribution (Vss/F) of febuxostat ranges from 29 to 75 L after oral 
doses of 10-300 mg. The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2%, (primarily to 
albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 80 and 120 mg doses. Plasma 
protein binding of the active metabolites ranges from about 82% to 91%. 
Biotransformation 
Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 
(UDPGT) enzyme system and oxidation via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Four 
pharmacologically active hydroxyl metabolites have been identified, of which three occur in plasma of 
humans. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that those oxidative metabolites were 
formed primarily by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9 and febuxostat glucuronide was 
formed mainly by UGT 1A1, 1A8, and 1A9. 
Elimination 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14C-
labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat 
(3%), the acyl glucuronide of the active substance (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their 
conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, 
approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the faeces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the 
acyl glucuronide of the active substance (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates 
(25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). 
Renal impairment 
Following multiple doses of 80 mg of ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal 
impairment, the Cmax of febuxostat did not change, relative to subjects with normal renal function. The 
mean total AUC of febuxostat increased by approximately 1.8-fold from 7.5 gh/mL in the normal 
renal function group to 13.2 g.h/mL in the severe renal dysfunction group. The Cmax and AUC of 
active metabolites increased up to 2- and 4-fold, respectively. However, no dose adjustment is 
necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Following multiple doses of 80 mg of ADENURIC in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or 
moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, the Cmax and AUC of febuxostat and its 
metabolites did not change significantly compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. No 
studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). 
Age 
There were no significant changes observed in AUC of febuxostat or its metabolites following 
multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in elderly as compared to younger healthy subjects. 
Gender 
Following multiple oral doses of ADENURIC, the Cmax and AUC were 24% and 12% higher in 
females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected Cmax and AUC were similar between 
the genders. No dose adjustment is needed based on gender. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Effects in non-clinical studies were generally observed at exposures in excess of the maximum human 
exposure. 
Pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation of rat data suggests that, when co-administered with 
febuxostat, the clinical dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine should be reduced to 20% or less of the 
previously prescribed dose in order to avoid possible haematological effects (see section 4.4 and 4.5). 
Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility 
In male rats, a statistically significant increase in urinary bladder tumours (transitional cell papilloma 
and carcinoma) was found only in association with xanthine calculi in the high dose group, at 
approximately 11 times human exposure. There was no significant increase in any other tumour type 
in either male or female mice or rats. These findings are considered a consequence of species specific 
purine metabolism and urine composition and of no relevance to clinical use. 
A standard battery of test for genotoxicity did not reveal any biologically relevant genotoxic effects 
for febuxostat. 
Febuxostat at oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive 
performance of male and female rats. 
There was no evidence of impaired fertility, teratogenic effects, or harm to the foetus due to 
febuxostat. There was high dose maternal toxicity accompanied by a reduction in weaning index and 
reduced development of offspring in rats at approximately 4.3 times human exposure. Teratology 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
studies, performed in pregnant rats at approximately 4.3 times and pregnant rabbits at approximately 
13 times human exposure did not reveal any teratogenic effects.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What ADENURIC is and what it is used for 
ADENURIC tablets contain the active substance febuxostat and are used to treat gout, which is 
associated with an excess of a chemical called uric acid (urate) in the body. In some people, the 
amount of uric acid builds up in the blood and may become too high to remain soluble. When this 
happens, urate crystals may form in and around the joints and kidneys. These crystals can cause 
sudden, severe pain, redness, warmth and swelling in a joint (known as a gout attack). Left untreated, 
larger deposits called tophi may form in and around joints. These tophi may cause joint and bone 
damage. 
ADENURIC works by reducing uric acid levels. Keeping uric acid levels low by taking ADENURIC 
once every day stops crystals building up, and over time it reduces symptoms. Keeping uric acid levels 
sufficiently low for a long enough period can also shrink tophi. 
ADENURIC 120 mg tablets is also used to treat and prevent high blood levels of uric acid that may 
occur when you start to receive chemotherapy for blood cancers. 
When chemotherapy is given, cancer cells are destroyed, and uric acid levels increase in the blood 
accordingly, unless the formation of uric acid is prevented. 
ADENURIC is for adults. 
2.  What you need to know before you take ADENURIC 
Do not take ADENURIC 
• 
If you are allergic to febuxostat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6). 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking ADENURIC: 
• 
• 
If you have or have had heart failure,  heart problems or stroke 
If you have or have had renal disease and/or serious allergic reaction to Allopurinol (a 
medication used for the treatment of Gout) 
If you have or have had liver disease or liver function test abnormalities 
If you are being treated for high uric acid levels as a result of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (a rare 
inherited condition in which there is too much uric acid in the blood) 
If you have thyroid problems. 
• 
• 
• 
Should you experience allergic reactions to ADENURIC, stop taking this medicine (see also section 
4). Possible symptoms of allergic reactions might be: 
- rash including severe forms (e.g. blisters, nodules, itchy-, exfoliative rash), itchiness 
- swelling of limbs or face 
- difficulties in breathing 
- fever with enlarged lymph nodes 
- but also serious life threatening allergic conditions with cardiac and circulatory arrest.  
Your doctor might decide to permanently stop treatment with ADENURIC. 
There have been rare reports of potentially life-threatening skin rashes (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) 
with the use of ADENURIC, appearing initially as reddish target-like spots or circular patches often 
with central blister on the trunk. It may also include ulcers in the mouth, throat, nose, genitals and 
conjunctivitis (red and swollen eyes). The rash may progress to widespread blistering or peeling of the 
skin. 
If you have developed Stevens-Johnson Syndrome with the use of febuxostat, you must not be re-
started on ADENURIC at any time. If you develop a rash or these skin symptoms, seek immediate 
advice from a doctor and tell that you are taking this medicine. 
If you are having a gout attack at the moment (a sudden onset of severe pain, tenderness, redness, 
warmth and swelling in a joint), wait for the gout attack to subside before first starting treatment with 
ADENURIC. 
For some people, gout attacks may flare up when starting certain medicines that control uric acid 
levels. Not everyone gets flares, but you could get a flare-up even if you are taking ADENURIC, and 
especially during the first weeks or months of treatment. It is important to keep taking ADENURIC 
even if you have a flare, as ADENURIC is still working to lower uric acid. Over time, gout flares will 
occur less often and be less painful if you keep taking ADENURIC every day. 
Your doctor will often prescribe other medicines, if they are needed, to help prevent or treat the 
symptoms of flares (such as pain and swelling in a joint). 
In patients with very high urate levels (e.g. those undergoing cancer chemotherapy), treatment with 
uric acid-lowering medicines could lead to the build-up of xanthine in the urinary tract, with possible 
stones, even though this has not been observed in patients being treated with ADENURIC for Tumor 
Lysis Syndrome. 
Your doctor may ask you to have blood tests to check that your liver is working normally. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children under the age of 18 because the safety and efficacy have not 
been established. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other medicines and ADENURIC 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
It is especially important to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking medicines containing any 
of the following substances as they may interact with ADENURIC and your doctor may wish to 
consider necessary measures: 
• 
• 
• 
Mercaptopurine (used to treat cancer) 
Azathioprine (used to reduce immune response) 
Theophylline (used to treat asthma) 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
It is not known if ADENURIC may harm your unborn child. ADENURIC should not be used during 
pregnancy. It is not known if ADENURIC may pass into human breast milk. You should not use 
ADENURIC if you are breast feeding, or if you are planning to breastfeed. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Be aware that you may experience dizziness, sleepiness, blurred vision and numbness or tingling 
sensation during treatment and should not drive or operate machines if affected. 
ADENURIC contains lactose 
ADENURIC tablets contain lactose (a type of sugar). If you have been told that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
ADENURIC contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to take ADENURIC 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. 
• 
• 
The usual dose is one tablet daily. The back of the blister pack is marked with the days of the 
week to help you check that you have taken a dose each day. 
The tablets should be taken by mouth and can be taken with or without food. 
Gout 
ADENURIC is available as either an 80 mg tablet or a 120 mg tablet. Your doctor will have prescribed 
the strength most suitable for you. 
Continue to take ADENURIC every day even when you are not experiencing gout flare or attack. 
Prevention and treatment of high uric acid levels in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy 
ADENURIC is available as a 120 mg tablet. 
Start taking ADENURIC two days before chemotherapy and continue its use according to your 
doctor’s advice. Usually treatment is short-term. 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The score line on the 80 mg tablet is only there to help you break the tablet if you have difficulty 
swallowing it whole. 
If you take more ADENURIC than you should 
In the event of an accidental overdose ask your doctor what to do, or contact your nearest accident and 
emergency department. 
If you forget to take ADENURIC 
If you miss a dose of ADENURIC take it as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for your 
next dose, in which case miss out the forgotten dose and take your next dose at the normal time. Do 
not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop taking ADENURIC 
Do not stop taking ADENURIC without the advice of your doctor even if you feel better. If you stop 
taking ADENURIC your uric acid levels may begin to rise and your symptoms may worsen due to the 
formation of new crystals of urate in and around your joints and kidneys. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

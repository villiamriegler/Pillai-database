Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pneumococcal polysaccharide 
conjugate vaccine (adsorbed) - 13 valent, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on spontaneous reports, including close temporal relationship, and in view of 
a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between pneumococcal 
polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (adsorbed) - 13 valent and anaphylaxis in children above the age of 
5 years and adults is at least a reasonable possibility. Consequently the PRAC has updated section 4.8 
of the SmPC to add the adverse reaction anaphylaxis with a frequency not known to the group of 
children above 5 years of age and adults. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine 
(adsorbed) - 13 valent the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal 
product(s) containing pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (adsorbed) - 13 valent is 
unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

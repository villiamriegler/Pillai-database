Summary of Risk Management Plan for TUKYSA® 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for TUKYSA. The RMP details how 
more information will be obtained about TUKYSA’s risks and uncertainties (missing 
information). 
This summary of the RMP for TUKYSA should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
TUKYSA’s RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
TUKYSA is authorised in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine for the treatment of 
adult patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have 
received at least 2 prior anti-HER2 treatment regimens. It contains tucatinib as the active 
substance and it is given orally. 
Further information about the evaluation of TUKYSA’s benefits will be found in tucatinib’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency 
(EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage once approved. 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise 
II. 
the risks 
Important risks of TUKYSA, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about TUKYSA’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to subjects and healthcare professionals, such as 
warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed including period safety update report (PSUR) assessment so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of tucatinib is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of TUKYSA are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Important identified risks are concerns 
for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of tucatinib. Important potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing 
and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risks 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Tucatinib nonclinical and clinical studies 
In the clinical development program, subjects who were treated with 
tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine showed a 
higher incidence of diarrhoea events than subjects who received 
trastuzumab and capecitabine alone. 
No specific risk groups at increased risk for diarrhoea have been identified 
with tucatinib treatment. Risk factors that could potentially be associated 
with an increased risk of diarrhoea include antibiotic use, side effects of 
other medications, intestinal abnormalities, food intolerance, and/or general 
wasting syndromes associated with cancer 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
●  SmPC Section 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8
●  PL Section 2 and 4
Routine risk minimisation activities recommending specific clinical 
measures to address the risk: 
●  Recommendation for diagnostic tests clinically indicated to exclude
infectious causes are included in SmPC Section 4.4.

Risk factors and risk groups 
Tucatinib nonclinical and clinical studies 
In the clinical development program, subjects who were treated with 
tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine showed a 
higher incidence of hepatotoxicity events than subjects who received 
trastuzumab and capecitabine alone. 
Although no specific risk groups or risk factors have been identified with 
tucatinib treatment, patients with prior history of hepatic disease, hepatitis, 
chronic liver conditions, concomitant administration of agents and 
medications with known adverse hepatic effects, or impaired hepatic 
function at baseline may be at increased risk.

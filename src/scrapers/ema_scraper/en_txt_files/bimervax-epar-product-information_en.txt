CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
BIMERVAX is indicated as a booster for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 
16 years of age and older who have previously received a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (see sections 4.2 
and 5.1).  
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Individuals 16 years of age and older  
A single intramuscular dose (0.5 mL) of BIMERVAX should be administered. There should be an 
interval of at least 6 months between prior receipt of a mRNA vaccine and administration of 
BIMERVAX (see section 5.1). 
Elderly population  
No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals ≥ 65 years of age. 
Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of BIMERVAX in children and adolescents less than 16 years of age have not 
been established yet. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
BIMERVAX is for intramuscular administration only, preferably into the deltoid muscle of the upper 
arm.  
Do not administer this vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.  
The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.  
For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4.  
For instructions regarding handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Events of anaphylaxis have been reported with COVID-19 vaccines. Appropriate medical treatment 
and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the 
administration of the vaccine.  
Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. 
Anxiety-related reactions  
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related 
reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. 
It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness  
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders  
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia), because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals. 
Immunocompromised individuals  
The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, 
including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of BIMERVAX may be lower in 
immunocompromised individuals.

Duration of protection  
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical trials.  
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness  
As with any vaccine, vaccination with BIMERVAX may not protect all vaccine recipients.  
Excipients 
Potassium 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘potassium-free’. 
Sodium 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Concomitant administration of BIMERVAX with other vaccines has not been studied. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy, and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is no experience with the use of BIMERVAX in pregnant women. Animal studies do not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, 
parturition, or post-natal development (see section 5.3). 
Administration of BIMERVAX during pregnancy should only be considered when the potential 
benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus.  
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether BIMERVAX is excreted in human milk. 
No effects on the breast-fed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breast-
feeding woman to BIMERVAX is negligible. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity, 
see section 5.3.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
BIMERVAX has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some 
of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Covid-19 vaccines, ATC code: J07BN 
Mechanism of action 
BIMERVAX is a recombinant protein vaccine whose active substance (antigen) is SARS-CoV-2 virus 
recombinant spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) fusion heterodimer – B.1.351-B.1.1.7 
strains. Following administration, an immune response is generated, both at a humoral and cellular 
level, against the SARS-Co-V-2 RBD antigen. Neutralising antibodies against the RBD domain of 
SARS-CoV-2 prevent RBD binding to its cellular target ACE2, thus blocking membrane fusion and 
viral infection. Moreover, BIMERVAX induces antigen-specific T-cell immune response, which may 
contribute to protection to COVID-19. 
Efficacy 
Efficacy of BIMERVAX has been inferred by immunobridging of immune responses to an authorised 
COVID-19 vaccine, for which vaccine efficacy has been established. 
Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity of BIMERVAX was evaluated in one pivotal phase 2b multi-centre clinical trial 
(Study HIPRA-HH-2) and in one phase 3 multi-centre clinical trial (Study HIPRA-HH-5). 
Study HIPRA-HH-2 
Study HIPRA-HH-2 is an ongoing phase 2b, double-blind, randomised, active-controlled, multi-
centre, non-inferiority clinical trial to assess immunogenicity and safety of a booster vaccination with 
BIMERVAX compared to tozinameran/COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine, in adults fully vaccinated against 
COVID-19 with a mRNA vaccine at least 6 months before enrolment. This phase 2b clinical trial 
excluded individuals who were pregnant, individuals who were immunocompromised or had received 
immunosuppressants within 12 weeks, as well as individuals with previous COVID-19 infection. 
Individuals were also required a minimum interval of 3 months after receipt of any immunotherapy 
(monoclonal antibodies, plasma) prior to the study.  
A total of 765 subjects were vaccinated; 513 subjects received BIMERVAX, and 252 subjects 
received the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran). A total of 751 subjects were analysed (504 
BIMERVAX subjects and 247 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine subjects) excluding those who tested 
positive for COVID-19 within 14 days of the booster. Randomisation was stratified by age group (18-
64 versus ≥ 65 years). The median age was 42 years (range: 19 to 76 years), with similar age ranges in 
both vaccine arms, including 7.4% and 7.1% of subjects 65 years of age and older in the BIMERVAX 
and COVID-19 mRNA vaccine groups, respectively.  
Immunogenicity of a booster dose of BIMERVAX was based on an assessment of geometric mean 
titres (GMT) of neutralising antibodies, measured by a pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay 
(PBNA) against SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain, Beta, Delta and Omicron BA.1 variants. GMT ratio is 
the result of the GMT values (ID50) of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran)/BIMERVAX. Non-
inferiority of BIMERVAX to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) is concluded if the upper limit 
of the 2 sided 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of the GMT ratio is < 1.4. Superiority of BIMERVAX 
to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) is concluded if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% 
Confidence Interval of the GMT ratio is < 1.0 (see Table 2, GMT ratio column).

HIPRA-HH-5 
This study is an ongoing open label, single arm, multicentre, phase 3 clinical trial to assess the safety 
and immunogenicity of a booster vaccination with BIMERVAX for the prevention of COVID-19 in 
subjects vaccinated with several primary vaccine schedules, with or without previous non-severe 
COVID-19 infections. BIMERVAX was administered at least 91 days after the last dose or at least 30 
days after the COVID-19 infection. This phase 3 clinical trial excluded individuals who were pregnant 
as well as individuals who were immunocompromised or had received immunosuppressants within 12 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
weeks. Individuals were also required a minimum interval of 3 months after receipt of any 
immunotherapy (monoclonal antibodies, plasma) prior to the study.  
The interim report includes data from a total of 2 646 subjects who were vaccinated with BIMERVAX 
as a booster dose in healthy individuals (at least 16 years old) previously vaccinated with different 
COVID-19 vaccines (mRNA COVID-19 vaccines: tozinameran and elasomeran, and adenovirus-
vector vaccines (COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) and COVID-19 vaccine 
(Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant]). Of these, 230 (8%) subjects were included in the immunogenicity 
population. In the immunogenicity analysis, the population of the Comirnaty/Comirnaty vaccine group 
were all subjects between 16-17 years old.  
Overall, the median age was 34.4 years (range: 16 to 85 years of age). Subjects were balanced between 
genders, 52.49% male and 47.47% female.  
Immunogenicity was measured by Pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA) against 
SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain and against Beta, Delta and Omicron BA.1. Data on GMT (geometric 
mean titre: ID50) at baseline (prior to the administration of the booster dose) and at Day 14 (2 weeks 
after the administration of the booster dose) are provided in the following table.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What BIMERVAX is and what it is used for 
BIMERVAX is a vaccine used to prevent COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 
BIMERVAX is given to individuals 16 years of age and older who have previously received a mRNA 
COVID-19 vaccine. 
The vaccine stimulates the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce specific 
antibodies that work against the virus, giving protection against COVID-19. None of the ingredients in 
this vaccine can cause COVID-19. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive BIMERVAX  
BIMERVAX should not be given 
- 
if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving BIMERVAX if: 
• 
you have ever had a severe or life-threatening allergic reaction after receiving any other vaccine 
injection; 
you have ever fainted following any needle injection; 
you have a high temperature (over 38 °C) or severe infection. However, you can have your 
vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold; 
you have bleeding problems, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood clots 
(anticoagulant medicine); 
• 
• 
• 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
your immune system does not work properly (immunodeficiency) or you are taking medicines 
that weaken the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or 
cancer medicines). 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before 
you are given BIMERVAX. 
As with any vaccine, BIMERVAX may not fully protect all those who receive it, and it is not known 
how long you will be protected. 
Children and adolescents 
BIMERVAX is not recommended for children aged below 16 years. Currently, there is no information 
available on the use of BIMERVAX in children younger than 16 years of age. 
Other medicines and BIMERVAX 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines or vaccines. 
Pregnancy and breastfeeding  
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse for advice before you receive this vaccine. 
Driving and using machines 
Some of the side effects of BIMERVAX listed in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily 
reduce your ability to drive and use machines. Wait until any effects of the vaccine have worn off 
before you drive or use machines. 
BIMERVAX contains sodium and potassium 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.  
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 milligrams) per 0.5 mL dose, that is to say, 
essentially ‘potassium-free’. 
3. 
How BIMERVAX is given 
BIMERVAX will be given to you as 0.5 mL injection into a muscle of your upper arm.  
It is recommended that you receive BIMERVAX as a single dose at least 6 months after a previous 
vaccination series with mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. 
After the injection, your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will watch over you for around 15 minutes to 
monitor for signs of an allergic reaction. 
If you have any further questions on the use of BIMERVAX, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
Most of the side effects occur within 3 days of getting the vaccine and go away within a few days of 
appearing. If symptoms persist, contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Get urgent medical attention if you get symptoms of a severe allergic reaction shortly after 
vaccination. Such symptoms may include:

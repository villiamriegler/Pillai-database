CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Piqray is indicated in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of postmenopausal women, and 
men, with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2)-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation after disease 
progression following endocrine therapy as monotherapy (see section 5.1).

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Piqray should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer 
therapies. 
Patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer should be selected for treatment 
with Piqray based on the presence of a PIK3CA mutation in tumour or plasma specimens, using a 
validated test. If a mutation is not detected in a plasma specimen, tumour tissue should be tested if 
available. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 300 mg alpelisib (2x 150 mg film-coated tablets) taken once daily on a 
continuous basis. Piqray should be taken immediately after food, at approximately the same time each 
day (see section 5.2). The maximum recommended daily dose of Piqray is 300 mg. 
If a dose of Piqray is missed, it can be taken immediately following food and within 9 hours after the 
time it is usually administered. After more than 9 hours, the dose should be skipped for that day. On 
the next day, Piqray should be taken at the usual time. If the patient vomits after taking the Piqray 
dose, the patient should not take an additional dose on that day and should resume the usual dosing 
schedule the next day at the usual time. 
Piqray should be co-administered with fulvestrant. The recommended dose of fulvestrant is 500 mg 
administered intramuscularly on days 1, 15 and 29, and once monthly thereafter. Please refer to the 
full prescribing information of fulvestrant. 
Treatment should continue as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Dose modifications may be necessary to improve tolerability. 
Dose modifications 
Management of severe or intolerable adverse drug reactions (ADRs) may require temporary dose 
interruption, reduction, and/or discontinuation of Piqray. If dose reduction is required, the dose 
reduction guidelines for ADRs are listed in Table 1. A maximum of 2 dose reductions are 
recommended, after which the patient should be permanently discontinued from treatment with Piqray. 
Dose reduction should be based on the worst preceding toxicity.

Tables 2-5 summarise the recommendations for dose interruption, reduction or discontinuation of 
Piqray in the management of specific ADRs. The clinical judgement of the treating physician, 
including confirmation of laboratory values if deemed necessary, should guide the management plan 
of each patient based on the individual benefit/risk assessment for treatment with Piqray. 
Hyperglycaemia 
Consultation with a healthcare professional experienced in the treatment of hyperglycaemia should 
always be considered and is recommended for patients who are pre-diabetic or those with fasting 
glucose (FG) >250 mg/dl or 13.9 mmol/l, body mass index (BMI) ≥30 or age ≥75 years. 
Consultation with a diabetologist or a healthcare professional experienced in the treatment of 
hyperglycaemia should always take place for patients with diabetes.

Fasting glucose levels reflect hyperglycaemia grading according to CTCAE Version 4.03 
CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. 
Applicable antidiabetic medicinal products, such as metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors or insulin sensitisers 
(such as thiazolidinediones or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors), should be initiated and the respective 
prescribing information should be reviewed for dosing and dose titration recommendations, including 
local diabetic treatment guidelines. Metformin was recommended in the phase III clinical study with 
the following guidance: Metformin should be initiated at 500 mg once daily. Based on tolerability, the 
metformin dose may be increased to 500 mg twice daily, followed by 500 mg with breakfast, and 
1 000 mg with the evening meal, followed by further increase to 1 000 mg twice daily if needed (see 
section 4.4). 
As recommended in the phase III clinical study, insulin may be used for 1-2 days until hyperglycaemia 
resolves. However, this may not be necessary in the majority of cases of alpelisib-induced 
hyperglycaemia, given the short half-life of alpelisib and the expectation that glucose levels will 
normalise following interruption of Piqray. 
4 
 
 
 
Baseline diabetic and pre-diabetic status, baseline BMI ≥30 and baseline age ≥75 years have been 
found to be risk factors for hyperglycaemia in patients treated with alpelisib. These risk factors were 
present in 74.7% of patients with any grade of hyperglycaemia and in 86.2% of patients with grade 3 
or 4 hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). 
Rash 
Oral antihistamine administration may be considered prophylactically, at the time of initiation of 
treatment with Piqray. Additionally, antihistamines are recommended to manage symptoms of rash. 
Topical corticosteroid treatment should be initiated at the first signs of rash and systemic 
corticosteroids should be considered for moderate to severe rashes. Based on the severity of rash, 
Piqray may require dose interruption, reduction or discontinuation as described in Table 3 (see 
section 4.8).

lower dose level. Only one dose reduction is permitted. If toxicity recurs, permanently discontinue 
Piqray treatment. 
For grade 2 total bilirubin elevation, interrupt Piqray dose until recovery to grade ≤1 and resume at the 
same dose if resolved in ≤14 days or resume at the next lower dose level if resolved in >14 days. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose regimen adjustment is required in patients aged 65 years or above (see section 5.2). There are 
limited data in patients aged ≥75 years, and especially for those ≥85 years. 
Renal impairment 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild 
or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). Caution should be used in patients with severe renal 
impairment as there is no experience with Piqray in this population. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
Based on a hepatic impairment study in non-cancer subjects with impaired hepatic function, no dose 
adjustment is necessary in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
class A, B or C, respectively) (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Piqray in children aged 0-18 years have not been established. No data are 
available. 
Method of administration 
Piqray is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole. They should not be chewed, crushed or 
split prior to swallowing. Tablets that are broken, cracked or otherwise not intact should not be 
ingested. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Fulvestrant 
Due to limited data in patients with prior fulvestrant use (n=39, study CBYL719X2101), efficacy is 
not considered established in this population (see section 5.1). 
Hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction) 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock and 
angioedema), manifested by symptoms including, but not limited to, dyspnoea, flushing, rash, fever or 
tachycardia, were reported in patients treated with Piqray (see section 4.8). Piqray should be 
permanently discontinued and should not be re-introduced in patients with serious hypersensitivity 
reactions. Appropriate treatment should be promptly initiated. 
Severe cutaneous reactions 
Severe cutaneous reactions have been reported with alpelisib. In the phase III clinical study, 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and erythema multiforme (EM) were reported in 1 (0.4%) and 3 
(1.1%) patients, respectively. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) has 
been reported in the post-marketing setting (see section 4.8). 
Piqray treatment should not be initiated in patients with a history of severe cutaneous reactions. 
Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous reactions (e.g. a prodrome 
of fever, flu-like symptoms, mucosal lesions or progressive skin rash). If signs or symptoms of severe 
cutaneous reactions are present, Piqray should be interrupted until the aetiology of the reaction has 
been determined. A consultation with a dermatologist is recommended. 
If a severe cutaneous reaction is confirmed, Piqray should be permanently discontinued. Piqray should 
not be re-introduced in patients who have experienced previous severe cutaneous reactions. If a severe 
cutaneous reaction is not confirmed, Piqray may require treatment interruption, dose reduction or 
treatment discontinuation as described in Table 3 (see section 4.2).

Hyperglycaemia 
Severe hyperglycaemia, in some cases associated with hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar nonketotic 
syndrome (HHNKS) or ketoacidosis, has been observed in patients treated with Piqray. Some cases of 
ketoacidosis with fatal outcome have been reported in the post-marketing setting. 
In the phase III clinical study, hyperglycaemia occurred more frequently in patients who were diabetic 
(0 out of 12 patients [0%] with grade 1-2, and 10 out of 12 patients [83.3%] with grade 3-4), 
pre-diabetic (42 out of 159 patients [26.4%] with grade 1-2, and 77 out of 159 patients [48.4%] with 
grade 3-4), had BMI ≥30 at screening (13 out of 74 patients [17.6%] with grade 1-2, and 38 out of 
74 patients [51.4%] with grade 3-4) or ≥75 years of age (6 out of 34 patients [17.6%] with grade 1-2, 
and 19 out of 34 patients [55.9%] with grade 3-4). 
As hyperglycaemia may occur with a rapid onset after starting treatment, it is recommended to 
self-monitor frequently in the first 4 weeks and especially within the first 2 weeks of treatment, as 
clinically indicated. A specific schedule for fasting glucose monitoring is recommended in Table 6. 
In the phase III clinical study, patients with a history of diabetes mellitus intensified use of antidiabetic 
medicinal products while on treatment with Piqray. 
All patients should be instructed on lifestyle changes that may reduce hyperglycaemia (e.g. dietary 
restrictions and physical activity).

After initiating 
treatment with Piqray  
Monitor fasting glucose at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 after treatment start and 
monthly thereafter. 
Monitor/self-monitor fasting glucose 
regularly, more frequently in the first 
4 weeks and especially within the first 
2 weeks of treatment, according to the 
instructions of a healthcare 
professional*. 
Monitor/self-monitor fasting glucose 
daily for the first 2 weeks of treatment. 
Then continue to monitor fasting 
glucose as frequently as needed to 
manage hyperglycaemia according to 
the instructions of a healthcare 
professional*. 
If hyperglycaemia 
develops after 
initiating treatment 
with Piqray 
HbA1c should be monitored after 4 weeks of treatment and every 3 months 
thereafter. 
Monitor fasting glucose regularly, as per local standard of care and at least 
until fasting glucose decreases to normal levels. 
During treatment with antidiabetic medication, continue monitoring fasting 
glucose at least once a week for 8 weeks, followed by once every 2 weeks, 
and monitor fasting glucose according to the instructions of a healthcare 
professional with expertise in the treatment of hyperglycaemia. 
* All glucose monitoring should be performed at the physician’s discretion as clinically indicated.

Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (e.g. excessive thirst, 
urinating more often than usual or greater amount of urine than usual, increased appetite with weight 
loss). 
In the 190 patients with hyperglycaemia, 87.4% (166/190) were managed with antidiabetic 
medication, and 75.8% (144/190) reported use of metformin as single agent or in combination with 
other antidiabetic medication (e.g. insulin, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, SGLT2 
inhibitors and sulfonylureas). 
Oral antidiabetic medication was used in 154 patients. Out of these 154 patients, 17 (11.0%) 
discontinued study treatment due to hyperglycaemia. Concomitant insulin medication was used in 
54 patients; of these 13 (24.1%) discontinued study treatment due to hyperglycaemia. 
Out of 162 patients with grade ≥2 hyperglycaemia, 155 had at least 1 grade improvement, median time 
to improvement from the first event was 8 days (95% CI: 8 to 10 days). 
Of the patients with elevated FPG who continued fulvestrant treatment after discontinuing Piqray 
(n=58), 98.3% (n=57) had FPG levels that returned to baseline. 
The safety of Piqray in patients with Type 1 and uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes has not been established 
as these patients were excluded from the phase III clinical study. Patients with a medical history of 
Type 2 diabetes were included. Patients with a history of diabetes mellitus may require intensified 
diabetic treatment and should be closely monitored. 
Based on the severity of the hyperglycaemia, Piqray may require dose interruption, reduction or 
discontinuation as described in Table 2 (see section 4.2). 
Pneumonitis 
Pneumonitis, including serious cases of pneumonitis/acute interstitial lung disease, has been reported 
in Piqray-treated patients in clinical studies. Patients should be advised to report promptly any new or 
worsening respiratory symptoms. In patients who have new or worsening respiratory symptoms or are 
suspected to have developed pneumonitis, Piqray treatment should be interrupted immediately and the 
patient should be evaluated for pneumonitis. A diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis should be 
considered in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms such as hypoxia, 
cough, dyspnoea, or interstitial infiltrates on radiological examination and in whom infectious, 
neoplastic and other causes have been excluded by means of appropriate investigations. Piqray should 
be permanently discontinued in all patients with confirmed pneumonitis. 
Diarrhoea or colitis 
Patients should be monitored for diarrhoea and other symptoms of colitis, such as abdominal pain and 
mucus or blood in stools. 
Severe diarrhoea and clinical consequences, such as dehydration and acute kidney injury, have been 
reported during treatment with Piqray and resolved with appropriate intervention. 59.5% of patients 
(n=169) experienced diarrhoea during treatment with Piqray. Grade 3 diarrhoea occurred in 7% (n=20) 
of patients with no reported cases of grade 4. Among patients with grade 2 or 3 diarrhoea (n=76), the 
median time to onset was 50 days (range: 1 to 954 days). 
Dose reductions of Piqray were required in 5.6% of patients and 2.8% of patients discontinued Piqray 
due to diarrhoea. In the 169 patients who experienced diarrhoea, antidiarrhoeal medications (e.g. 
loperamide) were required to manage symptoms in 64.5% (109/169). 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the severity of the diarrhoea or colitis, Piqray may require dose interruption, reduction or 
discontinuation as described in Table 4 (see section 4.2). 
Patients should be advised to start antidiarrhoeal treatment, increase oral fluids and notify their 
physician if diarrhoea or other symptoms of colitis occur while taking Piqray. In case of colitis, 
additional treatment, such as steroids, may be considered as clinically indicated. 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw 
Caution should be exercised when Piqray and bisphosphonates or RANK-ligand inhibitors (e.g. 
denosumab) are used either simultaneously or sequentially. Piqray treatment should not be initiated in 
patients with ongoing osteonecrosis of the jaw from previous or concurrent treatment with 
bisphosphonates/denosumab. Patients should be advised to promptly report any new or worsening oral 
symptoms (such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, non-healing of mouth sores, or discharge) during 
treatment with Piqray. 
In patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw, standard medical management should be initiated. 
Symptomatic visceral disease 
The efficacy and safety of this medicinal product have not been studied in patients with symptomatic 
visceral disease. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say 
essentially 'sodium-free'. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Medicinal products that may increase alpelisib plasma concentrations 
Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitors 
Alpelisib is a substrate for BCRP in vitro. BCRP is involved in the hepatobiliary export and intestinal 
secretion of alpelisib, therefore inhibition of BCRP in the liver and in the intestine during elimination 
may lead to an increase in systemic exposure of alpelisib. Therefore, caution and monitoring for 
toxicity are advised during concomitant treatment with inhibitors of BCRP (e.g. eltrombopag, 
lapatinib, pantoprazole). 
Medicinal products that may decrease alpelisib plasma concentrations 
Acid-reducing agents 
The co-administration of the H2 receptor antagonist ranitidine in combination with a single 300 mg 
oral dose of alpelisib slightly reduced the bioavailability of alpelisib and decreased overall exposure of 
alpelisib. In the presence of a low-fat low-calorie (LFLC) meal, AUCinf was decreased on average by 
21% and Cmax by 36% with ranitidine. In the absence of food, the effect was more pronounced with a 
30% decrease in AUCinf and a 51% decrease in Cmax with ranitidine compared to the fasted state 
without co-administration of ranitidine. Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed no significant 
effect of co-administration of acid-reducing agents, including proton pump inhibitors, H2 receptor 
antagonists and antacids, on the pharmacokinetics of alpelisib. Therefore, alpelisib can be 
co-administered with acid-reducing agents, provided alpelisib is taken immediately after food (see 
section 4.2). 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CYP3A4 inducers 
Once-daily administration of 600 mg rifampin (a strong CYP3A4 inducer) for 7 days followed by 
co-administration with a single 300 mg oral dose of alpelisib on day 8, decreased alpelisib Cmax by 
38% and AUC by 57% in healthy adults (N=25). Co-administration of rifampin 600 mg once daily for 
15 days with alpelisib 300 mg once daily starting from day 8 to day 15 decreased the steady-state 
alpelisib Cmax by 59% and AUC by 74%. 
Co-administration with a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreases alpelisib AUC, which may reduce 
alpelisib efficacy. Co-administration of alpelisib with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. apalutamide, 
carbamazepine, enzalutamide, mitotane, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John’s wort) should be avoided and 
selection of an alternative concomitant medicinal product, with no or minimal potential to induce 
CYP3A4, should be considered. 
Medicinal products whose plasma concentrations may be altered by alpelisib 
CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 substrates 
No dose adjustment is required when co-administering Piqray with CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. 
everolimus, midazolam), CYP2C8 substrates (e.g. repaglinide), CYP2C9 substrates (e.g. warfarin), 
CYP2C19 substrates (e.g. omeprazole). For CYP2B6 substrate, no relevant changes in the exposure 
were observed when co-administered with Piqray however the results should be considered with 
caution due to limited data (see section 5.2). 
In a drug-drug interaction study, coadministration of alpelisib with everolimus, a sensitive CYP3A4 
substrate, confirmed that there are no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions (increase in 
AUC by 11.2%) between alpelisib and CYP3A4 substrates. No change in everolimus exposure was 
observed at alpelisib doses ranging from 250 to 300 mg. 
In healthy subjects, co-administration of a CYP2C9 substrate (S-warfarin) with alpelisib increased 
S-warfarin exposure on average by 34% and 19% for AUCinf and Cmax respectively, compared to 
administration with S-warfarin alone, which indicates that alpesilib is a mild inhibitor of CYP2C9. 
Substances that are substrates of transporters 
In vitro evaluations indicated that alpelisib (and/or its metabolite BZG791) has a potential to inhibit 
the activities of OAT3 drug transporters and intestinal BCRP and P-gp. Piqray should be used with 
caution in combination with sensitive substrates of these transporters which exhibit a narrow 
therapeutic index because Piqray may increase the systemic exposure of these substrates. 
Hormonal contraceptives 
No clinical studies were conducted assessing the drug-drug interaction potential between alpelisib and 
hormonal contraceptives.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Piqray is indicated in men and postmenopausal women. It is not to be used in women who are, or may 
be, pregnant or breast-feeding (see section 4.1). 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Females of reproductive potential should be advised that animal studies and the mechanism of action 
have shown that alpelisib can be harmful to the developing foetus. Embryo-foetal development studies 
in rats and rabbits have demonstrated that oral administration of alpelisib during organogenesis 
induced embryotoxicity, foetotoxicity and teratogenicity (see section 5.3). 
In case females of reproductive potential take Piqray, they should use effective contraception (e.g. 
double-barrier method) when taking Piqray and for at least 1 week after stopping treatment with 
Piqray. 
Male patients with sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant or who could become pregnant 
should use condoms during sexual intercourse while taking Piqray and for at least 1 week after 
stopping treatment with Piqray. 
Please refer to section 4.6 of the prescribing information for fulvestrant. 
Pregnancy 
Piqray is not indicated and is not to be used in women who are, or may be, pregnant (see section 4.1). 
There are no data from the use of alpelisib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Piqray is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of 
childbearing potential not using contraception. 
The pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential should be verified prior to starting treatment 
with Piqray. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known if alpelisib is excreted in human or animal milk. 
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breast-fed infant, it is recommended that 
women should not breast-feed during treatment and for at least 1 week after the last dose of Piqray. 
Fertility 
There are no clinical data available on the effects of alpelisib on fertility. Based on repeated dose 
toxicity and fertility studies in animals, alpelisib may impair fertility in males and females of 
reproductive potential (see section 5.3).

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Piqray has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised to be 
cautious when driving or using machines in case they experience fatigue or blurred vision during 
treatment (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects

Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
ADRs from the phase III clinical study and post-marketing experience (Table 7) are listed by 
MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ class, the ADRs are ranked by frequency, 
with the most frequent reactions first. Within each frequency grouping, ADRs are presented in order 
of decreasing seriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse drug 
reaction is based on the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare (<1/10 000); not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected ADRs 
Hyperglycaemia 
Hyperglycaemia (FPG >160 mg/dl) was reported in 190 (66.9%) patients; grade 2 (FPG 
160-250 mg/dl), 3 (FPG >250-500 mg/dl) and 4 (FPG >500 mg/dl) events were reported in 16.2%, 
33.8% and 4.6% of patients, respectively. 
Based on baseline FPG and HbA1c values, 56% of patients were considered pre-diabetic (FPG 
>100-126 mg/dl [5.6 to 6.9 mmol/l] and/or HbA1c 5.7-6.4%) and 4.2% of patients were considered 
diabetic (FPG ≥126 mg/dl [≥7.0 mmol/l] and/or HbA1c ≥6.5%). 74.8% of patients who were 
pre-diabetic at baseline experienced hyperglycaemia (any grade) when treated with alpelisib. Among 
all patients with hyperglycaemia of grade ≥2 (FPG ≥160 mg/dl), the median time to first occurrence 
was 15 days (range: 5 days to 900 days) (based on laboratory findings). The median duration of 
grade ≥2 hyperglycaemia was 10 days (95% CI: 8 to 13 days). In patients with grade ≥2 
hyperglycaemia, median time to improvement (at least one grade from the first event) was 8 days 
(95% CI: 8 to 10 days). In all patients who continued on fulvestrant after discontinuing Piqray, FPG 
levels returned to baseline (normal). 
Hyperglycaemia was managed with antidiabetic medicinal products, see section 4.4. 
Rash 
Rash events (including rash maculopapular, macular, generalised, papular and pruritic, dermatitis and 
dermatitis acneiform) were reported in 153 (53.9%) patients. Rash was predominantly mild or 
moderate (grade 1 or 2) and responsive to therapy, and in some cases rash was accompanied by 
pruritus and dry skin. Grade 2 and 3 events were reported in 13.7% and 20.1% of patients, 
respectively, with a median time to first onset of 12 days (range: 2 days to 220 days). 
Among patients who received prophylactic antirash treatment including antihistamines, rash was 
reported less frequently than in the overall population; 26.1% vs 53.9% for all grades, 11.4% vs 20.1% 
for grade 3, and 3.4% vs 4.2% for rash leading to the permanent discontinuation of Piqray. 
Accordingly, antihistamines may be initiated prophylactically, at the time of initiation of treatment 
with Piqray. 
Gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting) 
Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were reported in 59.5%, 46.8% and 28.5% of the patients, 
respectively (see Table 7). 
Grade 2 and 3 diarrhoea events were reported in 19.7% and 7.0% of patients, respectively, with a 
median time to onset of grade ≥2 diarrhoea of 50 days (range: 1 day to 954 days). 
Severe diarrhoea and clinical consequences, such as dehydration and acute kidney injury, have been 
reported during treatment with Piqray and resolved with appropriate intervention (see Table 4). 
Antiemetics (e.g. ondansetron) and antidiarrhoeal medicinal products (e.g. loperamide) were used in 
28/153 (17.6%) and 109/169 (64.5%) patients, respectively, to manage symptoms. 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) 
ONJ was reported in 5.6% patients (16/284) in the Piqray plus fulvestrant arm. Fifteen patients 
experiencing ONJ were exposed to concomitant bisphosphonates (e.g. zoledronic acid) or RANK-
ligand inhibitors (e.g. denosumab). Therefore, in patients receiving Piqray and bisphosphonates or 
RANK-ligand inhibitors, an increased risk of development of ONJ cannot be excluded. 
Elderly 
In patients ≥65 years of age treated with alpelisib plus fulvestrant, there was a higher incidence of 
grade 3-4 hyperglycaemia (45.3%) compared to patients <65 years of age (33.5%), while in patients 
<75 years of age, grade 3-4 hyperglycaemia was 36% compared to 55.9% in patients ≥75 years of age.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
The adverse reactions associated with overdose have been consistent with the safety profile of Piqray 
and included hyperglycaemia, nausea, asthenia and rash. 
Management 
General symptomatic and supportive measures should be initiated in all cases of overdose where 
necessary. There is no known antidote for Piqray.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01EM03 
Mechanism of action 
Alpelisib is an α-specific class I phosphatidylinositol3kinase (PI3Kα) inhibitor. Gain-of-function 
mutations in the gene encoding the catalytic α-subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA) lead to activation of PI3Kα 
and AKT-signalling, cellular transformation and the generation of tumours in in vitro and in vivo 
models. 
In breast cancer cell lines, alpelisib inhibited the phosphorylation of PI3K downstream targets 
including AKT, and showed activity in cell lines harbouring a PIK3CA mutation. 
In vivo, alpelisib inhibited the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway and reduced tumour growth in xenograft 
models, including models of breast cancer. 
PI3K inhibition by alpelisib treatment has been shown to induce an increase in oestrogen receptor 
(ER) transcription in breast cancer cells. The combination of alpelisib and fulvestrant demonstrated 
increased anti-tumour activity compared to either treatment alone in xenograft models derived from 
ER-positive, PIK3CA mutated breast cancer cell lines. 
The PI3K/AKT signalling pathway is responsible for glucose homeostasis, and hyperglycaemia is an 
expected on-target adverse reaction of PI3K inhibition. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Piqray was evaluated in a pivotal phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 
alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant in postmenopausal women, and men, with HR+, 
HER2- advanced (locoregionally recurrent or metastatic) breast cancer whose disease had progressed 
or recurred on or after an aromatase-inhibitor-based treatment (with or without CDK4/6 combination). 
A total of 572 patients were enrolled into two cohorts, one cohort with PIK3CA mutation and one 
cohort without PIK3CA mutation breast cancer. Patients were randomised to receive either alpelisib 
300 mg plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation was stratified by 
presence of lung and/or liver metastasis and previous treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitor(s). 
In the cohort with PIK3CA mutation, 169 patients with one or more PIK3CA mutations (C420R, 
E542K, E545A, E545D [1635G>T only], E545G, E545K, Q546E, Q546R, H1047L, H1047R or 
H1047Y) were randomised to receive alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant and 172 patients were 
randomised to receive placebo in combination with fulvestrant. In this cohort 170 (49.9%) patients had 
liver/lung metastases and 20 (5.9%) patients had received prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment. 
Patients had a median age of 63 years (range: 25 to 92 years). 44.9% patients were 65 years of age or 
older and ≤85 years. The patients included were White (66.3%), Asian (21.7%) and Black or African 
American (1.2%). The study population included one male subject enrolled in the PIK3CA mutant 
cohort and treated with alpelisib and fulvestrant. 66.0% and 33.4% of subjects had an ECOG 
performance status of 0 and 1, respectively. 
97.7% of patients had received prior endocrine therapy. In 67.7% of subjects, the last therapy prior to 
study enrollment was endocrine therapy. Letrozole and anastrozole were the most commonly used 
endocrine therapies. The setting of last endocrine therapy prior to study enrollment was therapeutic in 
47.8% of subjects and adjuvant therapy in 51.9% of subjects. Overall, 85.6% of the patients were 
considered to have endocrine-resistant disease; primary endocrine resistance (de novo resistance) was 
observed in 13.2% and secondary endocrine resistance (relapse/progression following an initial 
response) in 72.4% of patients. 
Demographics and baseline disease characteristics, ECOG performance status, tumour burden and 
prior antineoplastic therapy were well balanced between the study arms. 
During the randomised treatment phase, alpelisib 300 mg or placebo was administered orally once 
daily on a continuous basis. Fulvestrant 500 mg was administered intramuscularly on cycle 1 days 1 
and 15 and then at day 1 of a 28-day cycle during treatment phase (administration ±3 days). 
Patients were not allowed to cross over from placebo to alpelisib during the study or after disease 
progression. 
The primary endpoint for the study was progression-free survival (PFS) using Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), based on the investigator assessment in patients with a 
PIK3CA mutation. The key secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS) for patients with a PIK3CA 
mutation. 
Other secondary endpoints included PFS for patients without a PIK3CA mutation, OS for patients 
without a PIK3CA mutation.

Primary efficacy analysis 
The study met its primary objective at the final PFS analysis (cut-off date 12-Jun-2018), 
demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in PFS per investigator assessment in the 
PIK3CA mutant cohort for patients receiving alpelisib plus fulvestrant, compared to patients receiving 
placebo plus fulvestrant with an estimated 35% risk reduction of disease progression or death in 
favour of treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant (see Table 8).

In the cohort with PIK3CA mutation, PFS subgroup analyses per investigator assessment by 
randomisation stratification factors showed a generally consistent treatment effect in favour of the 
alpelisib arm, irrespective of presence or absence of lung/liver metastases. 
Among 20 patients with prior CDK4/6 inhibitor use the hazard ratio (HR) for PFS was 0.48 (95% CI: 
0.17, 1.36); median PFS was 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.7, 3.6) in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm and 
5.5 months (95% CI: 1.6, 16.8) in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm. 
Using a data cut-off date of 12-Jun-2018, PFS results for the subgroup of endocrine resistant patients 
(HR=0.64; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.85, n=292) and endocrine sensitive patients (HR=0.87; 95% CI: 0.35, 
2.17, n=39) were in favour of the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm. The number of endocrine sensitive 
patients with a PIK3CA mutation was limited (n=39) and the results should be interpreted with 
caution. 
Using a data cut-off date of 12-Jun-2018, the overall response rate in patients with measurable disease 
at baseline was 35.7% (95% CI: 27.4, 44.7) in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm and 16.2% (95% CI: 
10.4, 23.5) in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. 
At the time when the final OS analysis was conducted (data cut-off date of 23-Apr-2020) a descriptive 
follow-up efficacy analysis for PFS data was performed. With a median duration from randomisation 
to data cut-off of approximately 42 months, the reported PFS results were consistent with those from 
the primary PFS analysis. There was an estimated 36% risk reduction of progression or death in favour 
of treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant (HR=0.64; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.81) (Figure 1).

Final overall survival analysis 
At the final OS analysis, the study did not meet its key secondary objective. As of the data cut-off date 
of 23-Apr-2020, a total of 87 (51.5%) deaths were reported in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm and 94 
(54.7%) in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. The HR was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.15; p=0.15, one-sided) 
and the pre-specified O’Brien-Fleming efficacy boundary of p ≤0.0161 was not crossed. Median OS 
was 39.3 months (95% CI: 34.1, 44.9) in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm and 31.4 months (95% CI: 
26.8, 41.3) in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm (Figure 2).

In patients with prior CDK4/6i treatment (n=20), the median OS in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm 
was 29.8 months (95% CI: 6.7, 38.2) compared to 12.9 months (95% CI: 2.5, 34.6) in the placebo plus 
fulvestrant arm (HR=0.67; 95% CI: 0.21, 2.18). 
Cohort without PIK3CA mutation 
No PFS benefit was observed in patients whose tumours did not have a PIK3CA tissue mutation. 
Prior use of fulvestrant in study CBYL719X2102 
Patients with prior fulvestrant use were not included in the pivotal study. In the phase I study 
CBYL719X2101, 39 subjects reported prior fulvestrant use. The best overall responses to treatment 
with alpelisib plus fulvestrant for the 21 subjects with PIK3CA mutations and measurable disease at 
baseline were partial response in 7 subjects, stable disease in 11 subjects, and progressive disease in 
2 subjects. Hence, the evidence of efficacy of this treatment in patients previously treated with 
fulvestrant is not established due to the limited data at this time (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Piqray in all subsets of the paediatric population in breast cancer (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of alpelisib were investigated in patients under an oral dosing regimen ranging 
from 30 to 450 mg daily. Healthy subjects received single oral doses ranging from 300 to 400 mg. The 
pharmcokinetics were comparable in both oncology patients and healthy subjects. 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of alpelisib, median time to reach peak plasma concentration (Tmax) 
ranged between 2.0 to 4.0 hours, independent of dose, time or regimen. Based on absorption modelling 
bioavailability was estimated to be very high (>99%) under fed conditions but lower under fasted 
conditions (~68.7% at a 300 mg dose). Steady-state plasma levels of alpelisib after daily dosing can be 
expected to be reached on day 3 following onset of therapy in most patients. 
Food effect 
Alpelisib absorption is affected by food. In healthy volunteers after a single 300 mg oral dose of 
alpelisib, compared to the fasted state, a high-fat high-calorie (HFHC) meal (985 calories with 58.1 g 
of fat) increased AUCinf by 73% and Cmax by 84%, and a LFLC meal (334 calories with 8.7 g of fat) 
increased AUCinf by 77% and Cmax by 145%. No significant difference was found for AUCinf between 
LFLC and HFHC with a geometric mean ratio of 0.978 (CI: 0.876, 1.09), showing that neither fat 
content nor overall calorific intake has a considerable impact on absorption. The increase in 
gastrointestinal solubility by bile, secreted in response to food intake, is the potential cause of the food 
effect. Hence, Piqray should be taken immediately after food at approximately same time each day. 
Distribution 
Alpelisib moderately binds to protein with a free fraction of 10.8% regardless of concentration. 
Alpelisib was equally distributed between red blood cells and plasma with a mean in vivo 
blood-to-plasma ratio of 1.03. As alpelisib is a substrate of human efflux transporters, penetration of 
the blood-brain barrier is not expected to occur in humans. The volume of distribution of alpelisib at 
steady state (Vss/F) is estimated at 114 litres (intersubject CV% 49%). 
Biotransformation 
In vitro studies demonstrated that formation of the hydrolysis metabolite BZG791 by chemical and 
enzymatic amide hydrolysis was a major metabolic pathway, followed by CYP3A4-mediated 
hydroxylation. Alpelisib hydrolysis occurs systemically by both chemical decomposition and 
enzymatic hydrolysis via ubiquitously expressed, high-capacity enzymes (esterases, amidases, choline 
esterase) not limited to the liver. CYP3A4-mediated metabolites and glucuronides amounted to ~15% 
of the dose; BZG791 accounted for ~40-45% of the dose. The rest of the dose, which was found as 
unchanged alpelisib in urine and faeces, was either excreted as alpelisib or not absorbed. 
Elimination 
Alpelisib exhibits low clearance with 9.2 l/h (CV% 21%) based on population pharmacokinetic 
analysis under fed conditions. The population-derived half-life, independent of dose and time, was 8 to 
9 hours at steady state with 300 mg once daily. 
In a human mass-balance study, after oral administration, alpelisib and its metabolites were primarily 
found in the faeces (81.0%) as alpelisib, or metabolised as BZG791. Excretion in the urine is minor 
(13.5%), with unchanged alpelisib (2%). Following a single oral dose of [14C]-alpelisib, 94.5% of the 
total administered radioactive dose was recovered within 8 days. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The pharmacokinetics were found to be linear with respect to dose and time under fed conditions 
between 30 and 450 mg. After multiple doses, alpelisib exposure (AUC) at steady state is only slightly 
higher than that of a single dose, with an average accumulation of 1.3 to 1.5 with a daily dosing 
regimen. 
Metabolic interaction 
CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 substrates 
In a drug-drug interaction study, co-administration of repeated doses of alpelisib 300 mg with a single 
dose of sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 (midazolam), CYP2C8 (repaglinide), CYP2C9 (warfarin), 
CYP2C19 (omeprazole) and CYP2B6 (bupropion), administered as a cocktail, showed that there is no 
clinically signficant pharmacokinetic interaction. The data from CYP2B6 substrate (bupropion) should 
be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size. 
In healthy subjects, co-administration of a CYP2C9 substrate (S-warfarin) -with repeated doses of 
300 mg alpelisib at steady state, increased S-warfarin exposure on average by 34% and 19% for 
AUCinf and Cmax respectively, compared to administration of S-warfarin alone. This indicates that 
alpesilib is a mild inhibitor of CYP2C9. 
In a drug-drug interaction study with the sensitive CYP3A4 and P-gp substrate everolimus, in patients 
with advanced solid tumours, AUC increased by 11.2%. No clinically meaningful change is expected 
as a result of drug interaction with CYP3A4 substrates. 
CYP3A4 inducers 
In a drug-drug interaction study co-administration of alpelisib and rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 
inducer, confirmed that there is a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction between alpelisib 
and strong CYP3A4 inducers (see section 4.5). 
Transporter--based interaction 
Based on in vitro data, inhibition of the renal organic anion transporter OAT3 by alpelisib (and/or its 
metabolite BZG791) cannot be discarded in patients at the therapeutic dose. 
Alpelisib showed only weak in vitro inhibition towards the ubiquitously expressed efflux transporters 
(P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, BSEP), solute carrier transporters at the liver inlet (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, 
OCT1) and solute carrier transporters in the kidney (OAT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2K). As unbound 
systemic steady-state concentrations (or concentrations at the liver inlet) at both the therapeutic dose 
and maximum tolerated dose are significantly lower than the experimentally determined unbound 
inhibition constants or IC50, the inhibition will not translate into clinical significance. Due to high 
alpelisib concentrations in the intestinal lumen, an effect on intestinal P-gp and BCRP cannot be fully 
excluded. 
Special populations 
Effect of age, weight and gender 
The population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there are no clinically relevant effects of age, 
body weight, or gender on the systemic exposure of alpelisib that would require Piqray dose 
adjustment. 
Paediatric patients (below 18 years) 
The pharmacokinetics of Piqray in children aged 0-18 years have not been established. No data are 
available. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly (age 65 years or above) 
Of 284 patients who received Piqray in the phase III study (in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm), 
117 patients were ≥65 years of age and 34 patients were between 75 and 87 years of age. No overall 
differences in exposure of Piqray were observed between these patients and younger patients (see 
section 4.2). 
Race/Ethnicity 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses and pharmacokinetic analyses from a phase I study in Japanese 
cancer patients showed that there are no clinically relevant effects of ethnicity on the systemic 
exposure of Piqray. 
Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters after single and multiple daily doses of Piqray for 
Japanese patients were very similar to those reported in the Caucasian population. 
Renal impairment 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 117 patients with normal renal function 
(eGFR ≥90 ml/min/1.73 m2) / (CLcr ≥90 ml/min), 108 patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 
to <90 ml/min/1.73 m2)/ (CLcr 60 to <90 ml/min), and 45 patients with moderate renal impairment 
(eGFR 30 to <60 ml/min/1.73 m2), mild and moderate renal impairment had no effect on the exposure 
of alpelisib (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Based on a pharmacokinetic study in patients with hepatic impairment, moderate and severe hepatic 
impairment had negligible effect on the exposure of alpelisib (see section 4.2). The mean exposure for 
alpelisib was increased 1.26-fold in patients with severe (GMR: 1.00 for Cmax; 1.26 for 
AUClast/AUCinf) hepatic impairment. 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 230 patients with normal hepatic 
function, 41 patients with mild hepatic impairment and no patients with moderate hepatic impairment, 
further supporting the findings from the dedicated hepatic impairment study, mild and moderate 
hepatic impairment had no effect on the exposure of alpelisib (see section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Safety pharmacology and repeated dose toxicity 
The majority of the observed alpelisib effects were related to the pharmacological activity of alpelisib 
as a p110α-specific inhibitor of the PI3K pathway, such as the influence on the glucose homeostasis 
resulting in hyperglycaemia and the risk of increased blood pressure. The bone marrow and lymphoid 
tissue, pancreas and some reproductive organs of both genders were the main target organs for adverse 
effects. Effects on bone marrow and lymphoid tissue were generally reversible on cessation of 
treatment. Effects on the pancreas and reproductive organs did not fully reverse but showed a tendency 
towards reversion. In exploratory rat studies evidence of inflammatory changes of the skin was found. 
Cardiovascular safety pharmacology 
In vitro inhibition of hERG channels (IC50 of 9.4 µM) was shown at concentrations ~13-fold higher 
than the exposure in humans, at the recommended dose of 300 mg/day. No relevant 
electrophysiological effect was seen in dogs. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted. 
Results of standard genotoxicity in vitro studies with alpelisib were negative. Alpelisib was not 
genotoxic in a repeated-dose rat toxicity study where micronucleus analysis was integrated, up to 
exposure levels approximately twice the estimated exposure (AUC) in humans at the recommended 
dose of 300 mg. 
Reproductive toxicity 
Embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits have demonstrated that oral administration of 
alpelisib during organogenesis induced embryotoxicity, foetotoxicity and teratogenicity. In rats and 
rabbits, following prenatal exposure to alpelisib, increased incidences of pre- and post-implantation 
losses, reduced foetal weights and increased incidences of foetal abnormalities (enlarged brain 
ventricle, decreased bone ossification and skeletal malformations) were observed starting at exposures 
below those in humans at the highest recommended dose of 300 mg, indicating potential clinical 
relevance. 
In repeated dose toxicity studies, adverse effects were observed in reproductive organs, such as 
vaginal or uterine atrophy and oestrus cycle variations in rats, decreases in prostate and testes weight 
in rats and dogs and prostate atrophy in dogs at clinically relevant doses based on AUC. 
In fertility studies conducted in male and female rats, similar effects on fertility were observed. In 
females, increased pre- and post-implantation losses, which led to reduced numbers of implantation 
sites and live embryos, were observed at exposure levels (AUC) approximately twice the 
recommended human dose of 300 mg. In males, fertility and reproductive performance, including 
sperm count and motility parameters, were unaffected at exposure levels approximately twice the 
estimated exposure (AUC) in humans at the recommended dose of 300 mg. However, at exposure 
levels (AUC) at or below the recommended human dose of 300 mg, accessory gland weights (seminal 
vesicles, prostate) were reduced and correlated microscopically with atrophy and/or reduced secretion 
in prostate and seminal vesicles, respectively. 
Phototoxicity 
An in vitro phototoxicity test on the mouse Balb/c 3T3 fibroblast cell line did not identify a relevant 
phototoxicity potential for alpelisib.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Piqray is and what it is used for 
What Piqray is 
Piqray contains the active substance alpelisib, which belongs to a group of medicines called 
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors. 
What Piqray is used for 
Piqray is used for the treatment of postmenopausal women, and men, with a type of breast cancer 
called advanced hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2)-negative breast cancer. Piqray is used in combination with fulvestrant, a hormonal anticancer 
therapy, in patients whose cancer has not responded to other hormonal treatments and who have 
certain changes (mutations) in a gene called PIK3CA. 
Your doctor will take a sample of your blood and/or tumour tissue, which will be tested for these 
PIK3CA mutations. If the result is positive your cancer is likely to respond to treatment with Piqray. 
How Piqray works 
Piqray works by blocking the effects of enzymes called phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K). These 
enzymes help cancer cells to grow and multiply. By blocking their action, Piqray can reduce growth 
and spread of the cancer and help to destroy cancer cells. 
If you have any questions about how Piqray works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, 
ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you take Piqray 
Follow all of your doctor’s instructions carefully, as they may differ from the general information in 
this leaflet. Check with your doctor if you are not sure. 
Do not take Piqray: 
- 
if you are allergic to alpelisib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Piqray. 
If any of the following apply to you before taking Piqray, tell your doctor or pharmacist: 
- 
if you have or have ever had high levels of sugar in your blood or diabetes (or signs of increased 
sugar levels, such as excessive thirst and dry mouth, needing to pass urine more often than 
usual, producing greater amounts of urine than usual, tiredness, nausea, increased appetite with 
weight loss). 
if you have ever had Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme (EM), drug 
reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis 
(TEN; possible symptoms include red skin, blistering of the lips, eyes or mouth, skin peeling, 
with or without fever, rash). 
if you have a severe bone disease that affects the jaw (osteonecrosis of the jaw, ONJ). 
- 
- 
If any of the following apply to you during your treatment with Piqray, tell your doctor or pharmacist 
immediately: 
- 
Rash, itching, hives, breathlessness, difficulty breathing, wheezing, cough, light-headedness, 
dizziness, changes in levels of consciousness, low blood pressure, reddening of the skin, 
swelling of the face or throat, blue discoloration of the lips, tongue or skin (possible signs of 
severe allergic reactions). 
New or changing breathing problems such as difficult or painful breathing, cough, rapid 
breathing, blue discoloration of the lips, tongue or skin, hiccups (possible signs of 
non-infectious pneumonitis or pneumonia). 
Increased thirst and dry mouth, passing urine more often than usual, tiredness, increased 
appetite with weight loss, confusion, nausea, vomiting, fruity odour on breath, difficulty 
breathing and dry or flushed skin, which may be signs of increased blood sugar levels 
(hyperglycaemia) and its complications. 
Rash, reddening of the skin, blistering of the lips, eyes or mouth, skin peeling, sometimes with 
fever (possible signs of one of the following skin conditions: Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), 
erythema multiforme (EM), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) 
or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)). 
New or worsening symptoms affecting your mouth (such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, 
non-healing of mouth sores, or discharge). 
Severe diarrhoea or severe abdominal pain or stools with mucus or blood, which may be signs 
of inflammation of your intestine (colitis). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Your doctor may need to treat these symptoms, temporarily interrupt your treatment, reduce your 
dose, or permanently stop your treatment with Piqray. 
Blood tests before and during your treatment with Piqray 
Your doctor will carry out blood tests before and regularly during treatment with Piqray to monitor 
your blood sugar. Based on the results, your doctor will take any necessary actions, such as 
prescribing a medicine to lower blood sugar levels. If necessary, your doctor may decide to 
temporarily interrupt treatment with Piqray or reduce your Piqray dose to allow your blood sugar to 
decrease. Your doctor may also decide to stop Piqray treatment permanently. 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Make sure that you regularly test your blood sugar before you start treatment, during treatment 
and after you stop treatment with Piqray. 
- 
Your doctor will tell you exactly when and where to have the blood tests. Treatment with Piqray 
may only be started if tests show that you have the right levels of sugar in your blood. This is 
because Piqray can increase sugar in your blood (hyperglycaemia), which could be serious and 
need treatment. Only regular fasting blood tests can tell the doctor if you are developing 
hyperglycaemia. 
Your doctor will tell you exactly when and where to test your blood sugar. This will be required 
more frequently in the first 4 weeks of treatment and especially in the first 2 weeks of treatment 
with Piqray. Afterwards, blood tests will be needed at least once a month, depending on your 
blood sugar levels. 
- 
Children and adolescents 
Piqray is not to be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and Piqray 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes in particular: 
- 
- 
- 
eltrombopag, a medicine used to treat low platelet count 
medicines used to treat breast cancer (such as lapatinib, ribociclib) 
everolimus, apalutamide, enzalutamide and mitotane, medicines used to treat certain types of

above. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Piqray must not be used by women who are, or may be pregnant or breast-feeding. Piqray may harm 
an unborn baby. If you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Women should not breast-feed during treatment and 
for at least 1 week after the last dose of Piqray. Your doctor will discuss with you the potential risks of 
taking Piqray during pregnancy or breast-feeding. 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant, your doctor will rule out an existing pregnancy 
before starting you on treatment with Piqray. This may include having a pregnancy test. 
Women who could become pregnant should use an effective method of birth control during treatment 
and for at least 1 week after stopping Piqray. Ask your doctor about suitable methods. If you think you 
may be pregnant after starting treatment with Piqray, tell your doctor immediately. 
During treatment and for at least 1 week after stopping treatment, male patients should use a condom 
for intercourse with female partners who could become pregnant. If the partner of a male patient 
suspects that she has become pregnant during this time, she should inform a doctor immediately. 
Driving and using machines 
Treatment with Piqray may lead to tiredness. You should therefore be cautious when driving or using 
machines during your treatment with Piqray.

How to take Piqray 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
How much Piqray to take 
The usual starting dose of Piqray is 300 mg once daily. Your doctor will decide on the right dose for 
you. 
Depending on the dose prescribed, the number of tablets to take is as follows: 
- 
- 
- 
300 mg dose: two 150 mg tablets 
250 mg dose: one 200 mg tablet and one 50 mg tablet 
200 mg dose: one 200 mg tablet 
If you vomit after you take the Piqray tablet(s), do not take any more tablets until your next scheduled 
dose. 
Your doctor will determine the dose of fulvestrant you should receive and when you should receive it. 
Depending on how your body responds to the treatment with Piqray, your doctor may want to adjust 
your Piqray dose. It is very important to follow your doctor’s instructions. If you have certain side 
effects, your doctor may ask you to change to a lower dose, to interrupt treatment for a time, or to stop 
treatment. 
When to take Piqray 
Piqray tablets are supplied in packs containing blister cards. Each blister card shows the tablet(s) to be 
taken on each day of the week. Follow the instructions on the blister card. 
Take Piqray once a day, immediately after food. Taking Piqray at the same time each day will help 
you to remember when to take your medicine. 
How to take Piqray 
Piqray tablets should be swallowed whole, they should not be chewed, crushed or split before 
swallowing. You should not swallow any tablet that is broken, cracked or otherwise damaged as you 
may not be taking the full dose. 
How long to take Piqray 
Take Piqray for as long as your doctor tells you to. 
This is a long-term treatment, possibly lasting for months or years. Your doctor will regularly monitor 
your condition to check that the treatment is having the desired effect. 
If you have questions about how long to take Piqray, talk to your doctor or to your pharmacist. 
If you take more Piqray than you should 
People who have taken too many Piqray tablets have experienced effects that are known side effects of 
Piqray, including high blood sugar levels, nausea, tiredness and rash. If you accidentally take too many 
tablets, or if someone else accidentally takes your medicine, contact a doctor or hospital for advice 
immediately. Medical treatment may be necessary.

If you forget to take Piqray 
If you forget to take a dose of Piqray, you may still take it, immediately after food, up to 9 hours after 
the time you should have taken it. If you only remember more than 9 hours after you should have 
taken it, skip the dose for that day. The next day, take the dose at your usual time. Do not take a 
double dose to make up for the one that you missed. 
If you stop taking Piqray 
Stopping your treatment with Piqray may cause your condition to become worse. Do not stop taking 
Piqray unless your doctor tells you to stop. 
If you have any further questions on the use of Piqray, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

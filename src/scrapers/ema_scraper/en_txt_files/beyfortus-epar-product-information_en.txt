CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Beyfortus is indicated for the prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract 
disease in neonates and infants during their first RSV season.
Beyfortus should be used in accordance with official recommendations.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
The recommended dose is a single dose of 50 mg administered intramuscularly for infants with body 
weight <5 kg and a single dose of 100 mg administered intramuscularly for infants with body weight
≥5 kg. 
Beyfortus should be administered prior to commencement of the RSV season, or from birth for infants 
born during the RSV season.
2
Dosing in infants with a body weight from 1.0 kg to <1.6 kg is based on extrapolation, no clinical data 
are available. Exposure in infants <1 kg is anticipated to yield higher exposures than in those weighing 
more. The benefits and risks of nirsevimab use in infants <1 kg should be carefully considered.
There are limited data available in extremely preterm infants (Gestational Age [GA] <29 weeks) less 
than 8 weeks of age. No clinical data available in infants with a postmenstrual age (gestational age at 
birth plus chronological age) of less than 32 weeks (see section 5.1).
For infants undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, an additional dose may be 
administered as soon as the infant is stable after surgery to ensure adequate nirsevimab serum levels. If 
within 90 days after receiving the first dose of Beyfortus, the additional dose should be 50 mg or 
100 mg according to body weight. If more than 90 days have elapsed since the first dose, the
additional dose could be a single dose of 50 mg regardless of body weight, to cover the remainder of 
the RSV season.
There are no safety and efficacy data available on repeat dosing.
The safety and efficacy of nirsevimab in children aged 2 to 18 years have not been established. No 
data are available.
Method of administration
Beyfortus is for intramuscular injection only.
It is administered intramuscularly, preferably in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. The gluteal 
muscle should not be used routinely as an injection site because of the risk of damage to the sciatic 
nerve. 
Instructions for administration 
Beyfortus is available in a 50 mg and a 100 mg pre-filled syringe. Check the labels on the carton and 
pre-filled syringe to make sure you have selected the correct 50 mg or 100 mg presentation as 
required.
Beyfortus 50 mg (50 mg/0.5 mL) pre-filled 
syringe with a purple plunger rod.
Beyfortus 100 mg (100 mg/1 mL) pre-filled 
syringe with a light blue plunger rod.

Step 1: Holding the Luer lock in one hand (avoid holding the plunger rod or syringe body), unscrew 
the syringe cap by twisting it counter clockwise with the other hand.
Step 2: Attach a Luer lock needle to the pre-filled syringe by gently twisting the needle clockwise 
onto the pre-filled syringe until slight resistance is felt.
Step 3: Hold the syringe body with one hand and carefully pull the needle cover straight off with the 
other hand. Do not hold the plunger rod while removing the needle cover or the rubber stopper may 
move. Do not touch the needle or let it touch any surface. Do not recap the needle or detach it from the 
syringe.
Step 4: Administer the entire contents of the pre-filled syringe as an intramuscular injection, 
preferably in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. The gluteal muscle should not be used routinely as 
an injection site because of the risk of damage to the sciatic nerve.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been observed with monoclonal 
antibodies. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis 
occur, immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate medicinal products and/or 
supportive therapy.
Clinically significant bleeding disorders
As with any other intramuscular injections, nirsevimab should be given with caution to infants with 
thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed. Monoclonal antibodies do not typically have significant 
interaction potential, as they do not directly affect cytochrome P450 enzymes and are not substrates of 
hepatic or renal transporters. Indirect effects on cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely as the target of 
nirsevimab is an exogenous virus.
4
Concomitant administration with vaccines
Since nirsevimab is a monoclonal antibody, a passive immunisation specific for RSV, it is not 
expected to interfere with the active immune response to co-administered vaccines.
There is limited experience of co-administration with vaccines. In clinical trials, when nirsevimab was 
given with routine childhood vaccines, the safety and reactogenicity profile of the co-administered 
regimen was similar to the childhood vaccines given alone. Nirsevimab can be given concomitantly 
with childhood vaccines.
Nirsevimab should not be mixed with any vaccine in the same syringe or vial (see section 6.2). When 
administered concomitantly with injectable vaccines, they should be given with separate syringes and 
at different injection sites.

4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most frequent adverse reaction was rash (0.7%) occurring within 14 days post dose. The majority 
of cases were mild to moderate in intensity. Additionally, pyrexia and injection site reactions were 
reported at a rate of 0.5% and 0.3% within 7 days post dose, respectively. Injection site reactions were 
non-serious.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Table 1 presents the adverse reactions reported in 2 966 term and preterm infants (GA ≥29 weeks) 
who received nirsevimab in clinical trials.
Adverse reactions reported from controlled clinical trials are classified by MedDRA System Organ 
Class (SOC). Within each SOC, preferred terms are arranged by decreasing frequency and then by 
decreasing seriousness. Frequencies of occurrence of adverse reactions are defined as: very common 
(≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); 
very rare (<1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data).

Infants at higher risk for severe RSV disease
Safety was also evaluated in MEDLEY in 918 infants at higher risk for severe RSV disease, including 
196 extremely preterm infants (GA <29 weeks) and 306 infants with chronic lung disease of 
prematurity, or haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease entering their first RSV season, 
who received nirsevimab (614) or palivizumab (304). The safety profile was comparable to the 
palivizumab comparator and consistent with the safety profile in term and preterm infants 
GA ≥29 weeks (D5290C00003 and MELODY).
Immunogenicity
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
There is no specific treatment for an overdose with nirsevimab. In the event of an overdose, the 
individual should be monitored for the occurrence of adverse reactions and provided with 
symptomatic treatment as appropriate.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immune sera and immunoglobulins, antiviral monoclonal antibodies, 
ATC code: J06BD08
Mechanism of action
Nirsevimab is a recombinant neutralising human IgG1ĸ long-acting monoclonal antibody to the 
prefusion conformation of the RSV F protein which has been modified with a triple amino acid 
substitution (YTE) in the Fc region to extend serum half-life. Nirsevimab binds to a highly conserved 
epitope in antigenic site Ø on the prefusion protein with dissociation constants KD = 0.12 nM and 
KD = 1.22 nM for RSV subtype A and B strains, respectively. Nirsevimab inhibits the essential 
membrane fusion step in the viral entry process, neutralising the virus and blocking cell-to-cell fusion.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Antiviral activity
The cell culture neutralisation activity of nirsevimab against RSV was measured in a dose-response 
model using cultured Hep-2 cells. Nirsevimab neutralised RSV A and RSV B isolates with median 
EC50 values of 3.2 ng/mL (range 0.48 to 15 ng/mL) and 2.9 ng/mL (range 0.3 to 59.7 ng/mL), 
respectively. The clinical RSV isolates (70 RSV A and 49 RSV B) were collected between 2003 and 
2017 from subjects across the United States, Australia, Netherlands, Italy, China and Israel and 
encoded the most common RSV F sequence polymorphisms found among circulating strains.
Nirsevimab demonstrated in vitro binding to immobilised human FcγRs (FcγRI, FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB, 
and FcγRIII) and equivalent neutralising activity compared to parental monoclonal antibodies, IG7 
6
and IG7-TM (Fc region modified to reduce FcR binding and effector function). In a cotton rat model 
of RSV infection, IG7 and IG7-TM exhibited comparable dose-dependent reduction in RSV 
replication in the lungs and nasal turbinates, strongly suggesting that protection from RSV infection is 
dependent on nirsevimab neutralisation activity rather than Fc-mediated effector function.
Antiviral resistance
In cell culture 
Escape variants were selected following three passages in cell culture of RSV A2 and B9320 strains in 
the presence of nirsevimab. Recombinant RSV A variants that showed reduced susceptibility to 
nirsevimab included those with identified substitutions N67I+N208Y (103-fold). Recombinant RSV B 
variants that showed reduced susceptibility to nirsevimab included those with identified substitutions 
N208D (>90,000-fold), N208S (>24,000-fold), K68N+N201S (>13,000-fold), or K68N+N208S 
(>90,000-fold). All resistance-associated substitutions identified among neutralisation escape variants 
were located in the nirsevimab binding site (amino acids 62-69 and 196-212) and were shown to 
reduce binding affinity to RSV F protein. 
In clinical trials
In MELODY and MEDLEY, no subject with medically attended RSV lower respiratory tract infection 
(MA RSV LRTI) had an RSV isolate containing nirsevimab resistance-associated substitutions in any 
treatment group.
In D5290C00003 (subjects who received a single dose of 50 mg nirsevimab irrespective of weight at 
time of dosing), 2 of 25 subjects in the nirsevimab group with MA RSV LRTI had an RSV isolate 
containing nirsevimab resistance-associated substitutions (RSV A: 0 of 11 subjects and RSV B: 2 of 
14 subjects). No subjects in the placebo group had an RSV isolate containing nirsevimab
resistance-associated substitution. Recombinant RSV B variants harbouring the identified 
I64T+K68E+I206M+Q209R (>447.1-fold) or N208S (>386.6-fold) F protein sequence variations in 
the nirsevimab binding site conferred reduced susceptibility to nirsevimab neutralisation. 
Nirsevimab retained activity against recombinant RSV harbouring palivizumab resistance-associated 
substitutions identified in molecular epidemiology studies and in neutralisation escape variants of
palivizumab. It is possible that variants resistant to nirsevimab could have cross-resistance to other 
monoclonal antibodies targeting the F protein of RSV.
Clinical efficacy
The efficacy and safety of nirsevimab were evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo 
controlled multicentre trials (D5290C00003 [Phase IIb] and MELODY [Phase III]) for the prevention 
of MA RSV LRTI in term and preterm infants (GA ≥29 weeks) entering their first RSV season. Safety 
and pharmacokinetics of nirsevimab were also evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, 
palivizumab-controlled multicentre trial (MEDLEY [Phase II/III]) in infants GA <35 weeks at higher 
risk for severe RSV disease, including extremely preterm infants (GA <29 weeks) and infants with 
chronic lung disease of prematurity, or haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease,
entering their first RSV season.
Efficacy against MA RSV LRTI, MA RSV LRTI hospitalisation, and very severe MA RSV LRTI in term 
and preterm infants (D5290C00003 and MELODY)
D5290C00003 randomised a total of 1 453 very and moderately preterm infants (GA ≥29 to
<35 weeks) entering their first RSV season (2:1) to receive a single intramuscular dose of 50 mg 
nirsevimab or placebo. At randomisation, 20.3% were GA ≥29 to <32 weeks; 79.7% were GA ≥32 to 
<35 weeks; 52.4% were male; 72.2% were White; 17.6% were of African origin; 1.0% were Asian; 
7
59.5% weighed <5 kg (17.0% <2.5 kg); 17.3% of infants were ≤1.0 month of age, 35.9% were >1.0 to 
≤3.0 months, 32.6% were >3.0 to ≤6.0 months, and 14.2% were >6.0 months.
MELODY (Primary cohort) randomised a total of 1 490 term and late preterm infants (GA ≥35 weeks) 
entering their first RSV season (2:1) to receive a single intramuscular dose of nirsevimab (50 mg
nirsevimab if <5 kg weight or 100 mg nirsevimab if ≥5 kg weight at the time of dosing) or placebo. At 
randomisation, 14.0% were GA ≥35 to <37 weeks; 86.0% were GA ≥37 weeks; 51.6% were male; 
53.5% were White; 28.4% were of African origin; 3.6% were Asian; 40.0% weighed <5 kg (2.5% 
<2.5 kg); 24.5% of infants were ≤1.0 month of age, 33.4% were >1.0 to ≤3.0 months, 32.1% were 
>3.0 to ≤6.0 months, and 10.0% were >6.0 months.
The trials excluded infants with a history of chronic lung disease/bronchopulmonary dysplasia or 
congenital heart disease (except for infants with uncomplicated congenital heart disease).
Demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable between the nirsevimab and placebo group 
in both trials.
The primary endpoint for D5290C00003 and MELODY (Primary cohort) was the incidence of 
medically attended lower respiratory tract infection (inclusive of hospitalisation) caused by 
RT-PCR-confirmed RSV (MA RSV LRTI), characterised predominantly as bronchiolitis or 
pneumonia, through 150 days after dosing. Signs of LRTI were defined by having one of the following 
findings at physical examination indicating lower respiratory tract involvement (e.g., rhonchi, rales, 
crackles, or wheeze); and at least one sign of clinical severity (increased respiratory rate, hypoxemia, 
acute hypoxic or ventilatory failure, new onset apnoea, nasal flaring, retractions, grunting, or 
dehydration due to respiratory distress). The secondary endpoint was the incidence of hospitalisation in 
infants with MA RSV LRTI. RSV hospitalisation was defined as hospitalisation for LRTI with a 
positive RSV test, or worsening of respiratory status and positive RSV test in an already hospitalised 
patient. Very severe MA RSV LRTI was also evaluated, defined as MA RSV LRTI with 
hospitalisation and requirement for supplemental oxygen or intravenous fluids.
The efficacy of nirsevimab in term and preterm infants (GA ≥29 weeks) entering their first RSV 
season against MA RSV LRTI, MA RSV LRTI with hospitalisation and very severe MA RSV LRTI 
are shown in Table 2.

Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint by gestational age, gender, race and region 
showed results were consistent with the overall population.
The severity of breakthrough cases of subjects hospitalised for MA RSV LRTI was assessed. The 
percentage of subjects who required supplementary oxygen was 44.4% (4/9) vs. 81.0% (17/21), 
subjects who required continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]/high flow nasal cannula [HFNC] 
was 11.1% (1/9) vs. 23.8% (5/21), and 0% (0/9) vs. 28.6% (6/21) subjects were admitted to intensive 
care unit, for nirsevimab vs. placebo, respectively.
MELODY continued to enrol infants following the primary analysis, and overall, 3 012 infants were 
randomised to receive Beyfortus (2 009) or placebo (1 003). Efficacy of nirsevimab against 
MA RSV LRTI, MA RSV LRTI with hospitalisation, and very severe MA RSV LRTI through 
150 days post dose was a relative risk reduction of 76.4% (95% CI 62.3, 85.2), 76.8% (95% CI 49.4, 
89.4) and 78.6% (95% CI 48.8, 91.0), respectively.
Efficacy against MA RSV LRTI in infants at higher risk for severe RSV disease (MEDLEY)
MEDLEY randomised a total of 925 infants at higher risk for severe RSV disease including infants 
with chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease and preterm infants GA <35 weeks, entering their 
first RSV season. Infants received a single intramuscular dose (2:1) of nirsevimab (50 mg nirsevimab
if <5 kg weight or 100 mg nirsevimab if ≥5 kg weight at the time of dosing) or 5 monthly 
intramuscular doses of 15 mg/kg palivizumab. At randomisation, 21.6% were GA <29 weeks; 21.5% 
were GA≥29 to <32 weeks; 41.9% were GA ≥32 to <35 weeks; 14.9% were GA ≥35 weeks. Of these 
infants 23.6% had chronic lung disease; 11.2% had congenital heart disease; 53.5% were male; 79.2% 
9
were White; 9.5% were of African origin; 5.4% were Asian; 56.5% weighed <5 kg (9.7% were 
<2.5 kg); 11.4% of infants were ≤1.0 month of age, 33.8% were >1.0 to ≤3.0 months 33.6% were 
>3.0 months to ≤6.0 months, and 21.2% were >6.0 months.
The efficacy of nirsevimab in infants at higher risk for severe RSV disease is extrapolated from the 
efficacy of nirsevimab in D5290C00003 and MELODY (Primary cohort) based on pharmacokinetic
exposure (see section 5.2). In MEDLEY, the incidence of MA RSV LRTI through 150 days post dose 
was 0.6% (4/616) in the nirsevimab group and 1.0% (3/309) in the palivizumab group. 
Duration of protection
Based on clinical and pharmacokinetic data, the duration of protection afforded by nirsevimab is at 
least 5 months.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetic properties of nirsevimab are based on data from individual studies and 
population pharmacokinetic analyses. The pharmacokinetics of nirsevimab were dose-proportional in 
infants and adults following administration of clinically relevant intramuscular doses over a dose 
range of 25 mg to 300 mg.
Absorption
Following intramuscular administration, the maximum concentration was reached within 6 days (range 
1 to 28 days) and the estimated absolute bioavailability was 85%.
Distribution
The estimated central and peripheral volume of distribution of nirsevimab were 249 mL and 241 mL, 
respectively, for an infant weighing 5 kg. The volume of distribution increases with increasing body 
weight.
Biotransformation
Nirsevimab is a human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that is degraded by proteolytic enzymes widely 
distributed in the body and not metabolised by hepatic enzymes.
Elimination
As a typical monoclonal antibody, nirsevimab is eliminated by intracellular catabolism and there is no 
evidence of target-mediated clearance at the doses tested clinically.
The estimated clearance of nirsevimab was 3.38 mL/day for an infant weighing 5 kg and the terminal 
half-life was approximately 69 days. Nirsevimab clearance increases with increasing body weight.
Special populations
Race
There was no clinically relevant effect of race.
Renal impairment
No clinical studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of renal impairment. As a typical IgG 
monoclonal antibody, nirsevimab is not cleared renally due to its large molecular weight, change in 
renal function is not expected to influence nirsevimab clearance.
10
Hepatic impairment
No clinical studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of hepatic impairment. As IgG 
monoclonal antibodies are not primarily cleared via the hepatic pathway, change in hepatic function is 
not expected to influence nirsevimab clearance.
Infants at higher risk for severe RSV disease
There was no significant influence of chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease on the
pharmacokinetics of nirsevimab.
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s)
In D5290C00003 and MELODY (Primary cohort) a positive correlation was observed between a 
serum AUC (based on clearance at baseline) above 12.8 mg*day/mL and a lower incidence of 
MA RSV LRTI. The recommended dosing regimen consisting of a 50 mg or 100 mg intramuscular 
dose for infants in their first RSV season was selected on the basis of these results.
In MEDLEY, >80% of infants at higher risk for severe RSV disease, including infants born extremely 
preterm (GA <29 weeks) and infants with chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease, achieved 
nirsevimab exposures associated with RSV protection (serum AUC above 12.8 mg*day/mL) following 
a single dose (see section 5.1).
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, 
repeated dose toxicity and tissue cross-reactivity studies.

6. Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Beyfortus is and what it is used for
What Beyfortus is 
Beyfortus is a medicine given as an injection to protect babies against respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV). RSV is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild symptoms comparable to the 
common cold. However, especially in babies and older adults, RSV can cause severe illness, including 
bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia (infection of the lungs) 
that may lead to hospitalisation or even death. The virus is usually more common during the winter.
Beyfortus contains the active ingredient nirsevimab which is an antibody (a protein designed to attach 
to a specific target) that attaches to a protein that RSV needs to infect the body. By attaching to this 
protein, Beyfortus blocks its action, thereby stopping the virus from entering and infecting human 
cells.
What Beyfortus is used for
Beyfortus is a medicine to protect your child from getting RSV disease.
2. What you need to know before your child is given Beyfortus
Your child should not use Beyfortus if he or she is allergic to nirsevimab or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
Inform your child’s doctor, pharmacist or nurse if this applies to your child. If you are not sure, check 
with your child’s doctor, pharmacist or nurse before the medicine is given.
If your child shows signs of a severe allergic reaction contact the doctor immediately.
Warnings and precautions 
Tell your doctor or seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs of an allergic reaction, 
such as:

difficulty breathing or swallowing
25


swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat
severe itching of the skin, with a red rash or raised bumps
Talk to your healthcare provider before your child is given Beyfortus if they have low numbers of 
blood platelets (which help blood clotting), a bleeding problem or bruise easily or if they are taking an 
anticoagulant (a medicine to prevent blood clots).
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children between the age of 2 and 18 years of age because it has not been 
studied in this group. 
Other medicines and Beyfortus
Beyfortus is not known to interact with other medicines. However, tell your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines.
Beyfortus may be given at the same time as vaccines that are part of the national immunisation 
program.
3.
How and when Beyfortus is given
Beyfortus is given by a doctor, pharmacist or nurse as a single injection in the muscle. It is usually 
given in the outer part of the thigh. 
The recommended dose is 50 mg for children weighing less than 5 kg and 100 mg for children 
weighing 5 kg or more. 
Beyfortus should be given before the RSV season. The virus is usually more common during the 
winter (known as the RSV season). If your child is born during the winter, Beyfortus should be given 
after birth.
If your child is to have a heart operation (cardiac surgery), he or she may be given an extra dose of 
Beyfortus after the operation to ensure they have adequate protection over the remainder of the RSV 
season.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
4.
Possible side effects

side effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Visually inspect Beyfortus for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. Beyfortus 
is a clear to opalescent, colourless to yellow solution. Do not inject Beyfortus if the liquid is cloudy, 
discoloured, or it contains large particles or foreign particulate matter.
Do not use if the Beyfortus pre-filled syringe has been dropped or damaged or the security seal on the 
carton has been broken.
Administer the entire contents of the pre-filled syringe as an intramuscular injection, preferably in the 
anterolateral aspect of the thigh. The gluteal muscle should not be used routinely as an injection site 
because of the risk of damage to the sciatic nerve.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Requested type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Amgen Europe B.V. submitted to 
the European Medicines Agency on 11 November 2016 an application for a variation.  
The following changes were proposed: 
Variation requested 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.4  
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling 
Type II 
I, II and IIIB 
or  PL  due  to  new  quality,  preclinical, 
clinical or pharmacovigilance data  
Update of sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to update the safety information with the 
data from the study 103311. This study is fulfilling the specific obligation for the conditional MA. It is 
proposed to remove the SO. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The MAH takes this opportunity to amend the format of the preparation instructions to improve clarity. 
The content is not impacted.  
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and 
Package Leaflet. 
1.2.  Rationale for the proposed change 
Blincyto (blinatumomab) was granted a conditional MA on 23/11/2015 in the indication of “Treatment of 
adult  patients  with  Philadelphia  chromosome-negative  relapsed/refractory  B-cell  precursor  acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)” based upon a phase 2 single arm study (MT103-211). As the Specific 
Obligation (SO) of the conditional approval, additional efficacy and safety data from the following phase 
3 study were required to confirm the clinical B/R of blinatumomab, to better quantify the magnitude of its 
treatment  effect  and  to  help  better  differentiate  between  the  AEs  associated  with  blinatumomab  and 
those associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy: 
“Post-authorisation  efficacy  study  (PAES):  Study  00103311  (TOWER):  A  Study  of  BITE  antibody 
blinatumomab  versus  standard  of  care  chemotherapy  in  adult  subjects  with  relapsed/refractory 
b-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).” 
The purpose of this type II variation is therefore to present the final efficacy and safety data from Study 
00103311, propose updates to the product information to reflect the study data and request the CHMP to 
adopt the granting of a MA no longer subject to SO for Blincyto. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
As part of the CMA for Blincyto (blinatumomab) the results of the Specific Obligation (SO) on additional 
efficacy and safety data from the study 00103311 (TOWER) were submitted to confirm the clinical B/R of 
blinatumomab, to better quantify the magnitude of its treatment effect and to help better differentiate 
between the AEs associated with blinatumomab and those associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy: 
The study showed statistically and clinically significant increases of OS, CR/CRh*/CRi and MRD negativity 
in the blinatumomab group as compared to the SOC chemotherapy group (7.7 months versus 4.0 months, 
43.9% versus 24.3%, 23.6% versus 9.0% respectively).  
EMA/CHMP/434726/2018  
Page 7/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
However, the mortality rate following alloHSCT among all responders who did not receive anti-leukemic 
therapy was 10/38 (26.3%; 95% CI: 13.4, 43.1) in the Blincyto group and 3/12 (25%; 95% CI: 5.5, 
57.2) in the SOC group; such mortality rate at 100 days post alloHSCT was 4/38 (12.4%; 95% CI: 4.8%, 
29.9%) in the Blincyto group and 0/12 (0%; 95% CI: not estimable) in the SOC group. 
Blinatumumab  was  associated  with  a  clinically  significant  increase  in  OS  in  the  target  population 
regardless of subsequent therapies. The effect was consistent across subgroups, though the role of HSCT 
and long-term safety was not yet fully characterised. Importantly, it is currently impossible to explore the 
role of treatments such as allo HSCT in patients who received blinatumomab and important prognostic 
factors due to the likely selection bias as patients being offered alloHSCT had different characteristics 
depending  on  the  treatment  arm.  Furthermore,  the  numbers  were  too  small  to  assess  this  aspect 
(100-days post alloHSCT mortality was 4/38  in the blinatumomab group and 0/12  in the SOC group). To 
investigate the long-term effects of HSCT in this population, the CHMP recommended collecting relevant 
data  concerning  HSCT  in  this  population  depending  on  prior  treatment  with  blinatumumab  and  other 
important prognostic factors. Although these data would not be expected to inform treatment decisions (a 
positive effect on OS has been observed in the target population regardless of subsequent therapies), 
these  data  may  help  in  understanding  the  role  of  subsequent  therapies  and  their  association  with 
important factors. Relevant endpoints should include EFS, OS, 100-day mortality postHSCT; incidence 
and severity of acute and chronic GvHD, rates of early (100-day) and late (> 100 days) infective AEs, 
overall  “non-relapse”  mortality  (NRM)  rates.  There  is  an  opportunity  to  use  the  existing  transplant 
registries to collect this information (see study 20170610 in the RMP). 
The  safety  profile  of  blinatumomab  in  00103311  (TOWER)  showed  no  unexpected  findings  and  was 
consistent with the established blinatumomab safety profile. The SmPC was updated to reflect the results 
of study 00103311 with additional safety information.  
Overall,  taking  into  account  statistically  and  clinically  significant  increases  of  OS  as  well  as  rates  of 
CR/CRh* and MRD response observed in the blinatumomab arm compared to the SOC chemotherapy arm, 
the CHMP considered that the overall B/R of blinatumomab remains positive in adults with R/R ALL at the 
moment of treatment initiation for blinatumomab.  
In  view  of    the  SAG  advice,  and  given  that  this  is  the  only  relevant  comparative  study  in  this  target 
population and that it is generally good practice to follow-up all patients until death,  the MAH has been 
requested to collect as complete survival data as possible for the Phase 3 study 00103311 (Tower). The 
additional  follow-up  will  provide  more  precise  estimates  and  the  possibility  for  further  analyses  (see 
RMP). 
Additionally,  the  CHMP  also  considered  that  the  ongoing  studies  in  first  line  B-ALL  and  B-precursor 
paediatric ALL are of great interest to assess the B/R of blinatumomab and its real place in relation to 
HSCT in the management of childhood ALL (COG-AALL1331) and the direct benefit (OS) of chemotherapy 
combined with blinatumomab among MRD-positive subjects following front-line therapy (ECOG-E1910).  
In conclusion, taking into account the controlled data of the Phase 3 study 00103311, the efficacy and 
safety of blinatumumab has been confirmed and the SOB is considered fulfilled as comprehensive data 
are  now  available  in  the  authorised  indications.  Efficacy  and  safety  have  been  comprehensively 
established  on  the  basis  of  the  available  data.  Further  data  to  be  collected  from  studies  00103311 
(TOWER)  and  20170610  are  not  considered  critical  for  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  product  in  the 
approved  indication,  but  are  of  interest  to  further  describe  aspects,  such  as  exploring  the  long-term 
effects more precisely, as well as exploring the role of subsequent treatments like alloHSCT and their 
association with prior treatments and other factors. Such additional aspects are unrelated to the SOB as 
foreseen at the time of the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation. As a consequence, the 
EMA/CHMP/434726/2018  
Page 8/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
CHMP agreed on the granting of a marketing authorisation which was not subject to specific obligations.  
Scientific Summary for the EPAR 
In this variation the marketing authorisation holder submitted data from study 00103311 (TOWER): A 
Study of blinatumomab versus standard of care chemotherapy in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory 
b-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) defined 
as the time of randomization until death due to any cause. Key secondary endpoints included complete 
remission (CR), complete remission with partial hematologic recovery (CRh*), complete remission with 
incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) and minimal residual disease (MRD). In this study statistically and 
clinically significant increases of primary endpoint OS and secondary endpoints CR/CRh*/CRi and MRD 
negativity were observed in the blinatumomab arm as compared to the SOC chemotherapy arm (7.7 
months vs 4.0 months, 43.9% vs 24.3%, 23.6% vs 9.0% respectively). In conclusion, the controlled data 
of the Phase 3 study 00103311 confirmed the efficacy and safety of blinatumumab and the CHMP agreed 
on the fulfilment of the specific obligation.

in  adult  subjects  with  relapsed/refractory  b-precursor  acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia  (ALL).  The  RMP 
(version 7.0) has been updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) took 
this opportunity to make editorials changes in section 6.6 of the SmPC. Finally, the CHMP recommends 
the granting of a marketing authorisation no longer subject to specific obligations.  
 is recommended for approval. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet. 
4.  Scientific discussion 
4.1.  Introduction 
Acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia  (ALL)  is  a  heterogeneous  hematologic  disease  characterized  by  the 
proliferation of immature lymphoid cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. Primary refractory ALL 
is  defined  by  absence  of  complete  remission  (CR1)  after  standard  induction  therapy.  A  patient  has 
relapsed ALL if they achieved a CR1 during upfront therapy and then relapse during or after therapy. A 
EMA/CHMP/434726/2018  
Page 9/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
similar classification is possible for salvage therapy. Refractory relapse is defined by lack of CR after first 
salvage therapy. Second relapse or later relapses are defined as relapse after achieving a second CR 
(CR2) in first salvage or later salvage therapies.  
The detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) after induction therapy and/or consolidation therapy is 
an independent prognostic factor for poor outcome of ALL. Patients highly responsive to chemotherapy 
with an MRD level below 10-4 induced by induction treatment have a favourable prognosis. Patients with 
MRD that persists during induction and consolidation of front-line treatment or who become MRD-positive 
following treatment have poor leukaemia-free survival rates.  
No chemotherapeutic regimens used in the treatment of adult R/R B-precursor ALL are clearly superior. 
Common  treatment  regimens  include  different  combinations  with  fludarabine,  cytarabine  arabinoside, 
granulocyte-colony  stimulating  factor,  and  idarubicin  (FLAG-IDA),  high-dose  cytarabine  arabinoside 
(HiDAC), or methotrexate with L-asparaginase. Intrathecal chemotherapy may also be used to prevent 
central nervous system (CNS) relapse as part of the treatment regimen. The choice of standard of care 
(SOC) chemotherapeutic agent depends on several factors including the initial choice and response to 
treatment in the de novo setting, time since the chemotherapeutic regimen was last used (ie, early or late 
relapse), presence of adverse events, regional practice pattern, and physician preference.  
Blincyto (blinatumomab) was granted a conditional MA on 23/11/2015 in the indication of “Treatment of 
adult  patients  with  Philadelphia  chromosome-negative  relapsed/refractory  B-cell  precursor  acute 
lymphoblastic  leukaemia  (ALL)”  based  upon  a  phase  2  single  arm  study  (MT103-211)  designed  to 
evaluate efficacy and safety of blinatumomab in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL.   
As the Specific Obligation (SO) of the conditional approval, additional efficacy and safety data from the 
following phase 3 study were required to confirm the clinical B/R of blinatumomab, to better quantity the 
magnitude  of  its  treatment  effect  and  to  help  better  differentiate  between  the  AEs  associated  with 
blinatumomab and those associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy: 
“Study  00103311  (TOWER):  A  Study  of  BITE  antibody  blinatumomab  versus  standard  of  care 
chemotherapy  in  adult  subjects  with  relapsed/refractory  b-precursor  acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia 
(ALL).” 
4.2.  Clinical 
4.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study 00103311 was a phase 3 randomized, open-label study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of blinatumomab vs SOC chemotherapy. Adult subjects with relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor 
ALL were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive blinatumomab or 1 of 4 pre-specified, investigator-chosen, 
SOC chemotherapy regimens. Randomization was stratified by age (< 35 years vs ≥ 35 years of age), 
prior salvage therapy (yes vs no), and prior alloHSCT (yes vs no) as assessed at the time of consent. 
The study consisted of up to a 3-week screening and pre-phase period, a treatment period consisting of 
induction  with  2  cycles  of  either  blinatumomab  or  SOC  chemotherapy  (1  of  4  pre-specified, 
investigator-chosen  regimens)  a  consolidation  phase  of  up  to  3  additional  cycles  of  protocol-specified 
therapy, and a maintenance phase for up to an additional 12 months with protocol-specified therapy. 
Blinatumomab was administered as a continuous intravenous (cIV) infusion at a constant flow rate for 4 
weeks, followed by a 2-week treatment free interval, defined as 1 treatment cycle during the induction 
and  consolidation  cycles.  During  the  maintenance  phase,  blinatumomab  was  administered  as  a  cIV 
infusion at a constant flow rate for 4 weeks, followed by an 8-week treatment free interval. In the first 
induction cycle, the initial dose of blinatumomab was 9 μg/day for the first 7 days of treatment which was 
EMA/CHMP/434726/2018  
Page 10/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
escalated  (dose  step)  to  28  μg/day  starting  on  day  8  (week  2)  through  day  29  (week  4).  For  all 
subsequent cycles, the blinatumomab dose remained at 28 μg/day for 4 weeks of cIV treatment. 
Two PK samples were to be collected: 1) Cycle 1 D2, and 2) Cycle 1 D15. Both PK samples were to be 
taken during the infusion and at the same time as the other blood samples scheduled for that day. 
271 subjects were randomized to Blinatumomab arm, 267 subjects were treated, and 247 were entered 
in the PK analysis set. Of note, 14 subjects withdrew consent. 
The PK analysis set comprised 461 blinatumomab samples from 247 subjects. Of these samples, 114 
(25%) were excluded from data analysis. Reasons for exclusion of samples were as follows: 
Unscheduled (n = 5), collected during a retreatment phase (n = 7), concentrations of blinatumomab were 
below the LLOQ (n = 93) or exceeded 3 times of SD of mean (n = 1), subjects did not receive scheduled 
doses (e.g., recorded dose of 9 μg/day on cycle 1, day 15, while the scheduled dose should have been 28 
μg/day (n = 8). 
Table 1 Summary of PK results (Study 00103311) 
During a cIV infusion of 9 and 28 μg/day blinatumomab over 4 weeks, mean (standard deviation [SD]) 
serum Css of blinatumomab in cycle 1 were 211 (413) pg/mL and 592 (553) pg/mL, respectively. The 
mean Css values increased dose proportionally with a 2.81-fold increase in Css for a 3.1-fold increase in 
dose. The estimated mean (SD) clearance (CL) was 3.63 (3.12) L/hr and was consistent over time.  
An exploratory analysis of this global study suggested that the blinatumomab CL was not affected by age, 
body weight, race, or sex.

4.2.2.  Clinical efficacy 
Study 00103311 was a phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and

Treatments 
Blinatumomab was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI).  
Figure 1 Study Design and Treatment Schema(Study 00103311) 
BM = bone marrow; HSCT = hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; SOC = standard of care 
a The prephase period during screening was permitted for the administration of dexamethasone to reduce tumor 
burden and the incidence of tumor lysis syndrome and cytokine release syndrome. 
b Subjects who were eligible to receive allogeneic HSCT at any time after cycle 1 were required to discontinue 
protocol-specified therapy and complete a safety follow-up visit before the transplant was performed. These subjects 
continued to be followed during the long-term safety follow-up period. 
c Standard of care chemotherapy options are described in Section 8.5.1.2 
In  the  first  induction  cycle,  the  initial  dose  of  blinatumomab  will  be  9  μg/day  for  the  first  7  days  of 
treatment  (to  mitigate  for  potential  CRS  and  neurologic  events  associated  with  introduction  to 
blinatumomab) which then will be escalated (dose step) to 28 μg/day starting on day 8 (week 2) through 
day 29 (week 4) of the cycle 1 and for all other subsequent cycles.  
The treatment-free period between cycles was 2 weeks in the induction and consolidation phases (cycles 
1  to  5)  and  8  weeks  in  the  maintenance  phase  (cycles  6-9)  of  the  study  and  was  permitted  to  be 
prolonged by up to 7 days if the investigator deemed it to be necessary. 
Subjects  randomized  to  the  SOC  chemotherapy  arm  received  one  of  the  following  chemotherapy 
regimens: 
1. FLAG ± anthracycline based regimen (such as Idarubicin 10 mg/m2
days 1-5; cytarabine 2g/m2
 days 1-5).  
 days 1, 3; fludarabine 30 mg/m2
For subject’s > 60 years of age: Idarubicin 5 mg/m2
1 g/m2
 days 1-5. 
 day 1,3; fludarabine 20 mg/m2
 days 1-5; cytarabine 
2.  HiDAC  based  regimen:  cytarabine  arabinoside  at  least  1  g/m2  or  greater  per  day  ±  anthracycline 
and/or  in  combination  with  other  drugs  such  as  native  E.coli  asparaginase,  PEG-asparaginase,  vinca 
alkaloids, steroids, etoposide or alkylating agents. 
EMA/CHMP/434726/2018  
Page 14/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. High-dose methotrexate based regimen (such as 500 mg/m2 - 3 g/m2 HDMTX (infusion time up to 24 
hours)  in  combination  with  other  drugs  such  as  native  E.coli  asparaginase,  PEG-asparaginase,  vinca 
alkaloids, steroids, etoposide or alkylating agents. 
4.  Clofarabine  or  clofarabine  based  regimens.  Clofarabine  use  as  a  single  agent  should  follow  the 
recommended  prescribing  information.  Clofarabine  combination  based  regimens  should  use  ≥  20 
mg/m2/day for up to 5 days.  
The core study duration consisted of: 
•  A  3-week  screening  and  pre-phase  period  allowing  the  administration  of  dexamethasone  to 
reduce both tumor burden and the incidence of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). 
• 
Induction phase (2 induction cycles, 6w/cycle):  
Blinatumomab:  each  of  2  induction  cycles  consists  of  4w  of  continuous  IV  infusion  of 
blinatumomab followed by a 2w of treatment-free interval.  
SOC chemotherapy: 2 cycles of one of 4 protocol-specified, investigator-chosen, chemotherapy 
regimens.  
•  Consolidation  phase  (3  additional  cycles,  6w/cycle):  subjects  who  achieved  a  bone  marrow 
response  (≤  5%  of  bone  marrow  blasts)  or  CR/CRh*  (complete  remission  with  partial 
hematologic recovery)/CRi (complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) within 2 
induction  cycles  of  treatment  were  permitted  to  continue  to  receive  up  to  3  additional 
consolidation cycles of their assigned protocol-specified therapy. 
•  Maintenance phase (4 additional cycles during 12 months, 12w/cycle): subjects who received 2 
induction and up to 3 consolidation cycles of protocol-specified therapy and continued to have a 
bone marrow response (≤ 5% of bone marrow blasts or CR/CRh*/CRi) were allowed to continue 
to receive their assigned protocol-specified therapy for an additional 12 months (4 cycles). One 
cycle was defined as 12 weeks in duration, 4 weeks of blinatumomab cIV followed by an 8 week 
treatment-free period.  
Subjects  must  have  discontinued  treatment  earlier  if  1  of  the  following  conditions  occurred: 
received alloHSCT, investigator decided to stop therapy, needed excluded medications, or toxicity 
or relapse was experienced.  
•  Safety follow-up visit: clinic visit made 30 days after last dose of blinatumomab. This visit was 
required  before  the  subject  received  alloHSCT  or  prohibited  anticancer  therapies  were 
administered.  
• 
Long-term safety follow-up period: contact between the investigator and subject either by clinic 
visit or telephone call continued every 3 months after the safety follow-up visit to assess disease 
status until 1 of the 3 following events occurred: a/ 330 deaths reported, b/ 12 months after the 
last subject randomized if only 300 to 329 deaths reported, c/ after 300 deaths reported with the 
duration of the long-term safety follow-up exceeded 12 months from the last subject randomized. 
Doses Modifications  
In case of CTCAE grade 4 adverse events, blinatumomab should be permanent discontinuation. CTCAE 
grade  ≥  3  cytokine  release  syndrome,  tumor  lysis  syndrome  and  DIC/coagulopathy,  treatment  with 
blinatumomab was interrupted until the event resolves to at least grade 1. Blinatumomab could then be 
restarted at the lowest starting dose (9 μg/d) and possibly increased to the higher level if AE grade ≤ 1 
EMA/CHMP/434726/2018  
Page 15/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
for  at  least  7  days.  If  the  AE  lasts  for  ≥  2  weeks,  then  blinatumomab  is  permanently  discontinued. 
Patients who have been dose reduced will have an option to receive the higher dose.  
In case of CTCAE grade ≥3 neurologic events, blinatumomab was stopped immediately and a physical 
exam, vital signs, and safety laboratory tests were performed. If the event has decreased to at least 
grade 1 within 1 week, treatment may be restarted within 2 weeks, but not earlier than 72 hours (3 days) 
after the infusion was stopped. A grade 3 neurologic event leading to treatment interruption at the dose 
of  9  μg/day  or  a  neurologic  event  needing  more  than  1  week  to  resolve  to  grade  ≤  1  will  result  in 
permanent  treatment  discontinuation.  In  case  of  neurologic  events  CTCAE  grade  4,  or  in  case  of 
occurrence of more than one seizure, the infusion of blinatumomab will have to be stopped immediately 
and treatment will be permanently discontinued. 
Re-start  of  the  infusion  should  be  performed  in  the  hospital  after  mandatory  premedication  with 
dexamethasone. 
Prior and concomitant therapy: 
Dexamethasone premedication before blinatumomab treatment 
During the screening period, dexamethasone (10 mg/m2/day) may have been administered for up to 5 
days to prevent cytokine release and other events such as infusion reactions and fever (ie, pre-phase). 
This dose may have been increased to 24 mg/day if clinically indicated. Dexamethasone prephase was 
required during screening if the proportion of blasts was > 50% or if peripheral blood blast count was 
≥15,000/µL. Prephase was recommended if lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) indicated rapidly progressing 
disease or if signs of extramedullary disease showed high tumor load.  
In addition, administration of dexamethasone (20 mg IV) was mandatory for all subjects within 1 hour 
before the start of each cycle, within 1 hour of an increase in dose or after a treatment interruption >4 
hours (ie, pre-dose) for the prevention of CRS resulting from blinatumomab. Dexamethasone was also 
administered to patients with neurologic adverse events at a dose of at least 24 mg/day for 3 days and 
then dose was reduced step-wise over 4 days. For subjects with signs of CRS, oral or IV dexamethasone 
was also administered at a dose of 8 mg/day thrice daily which was reduced stepwise over 4 days. 
Intrathecal CNS prophylaxis before protocol-specified therapy 
Within 10 days prior to randomized treatment and following each induction and consolidation treatment 
cycle, a mandatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) prophylaxis consisting of intrathecal therapy according to 
the institution or national guidelines. 
Prohibited medications and therapies after the start of blinatumomab 
Any  other  anti-tumor  therapy  (ie  cytotoxic  or  cytostatic  drugs,  radiation  therapy,  immunotherapy), 
chronic  systemic  (>7  days)  high  dose  corticosteroids  (dexamethasone  ≥24mg/day),  any  other 
immunosuppressive therapies and other investigational product. 
Non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  agents  should  have  been  avoided  for  fever  management  in  order  to 
avoid endothelial stress if possible.

Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
•  Hematologic remission rate 
o  Best response of CR within 12 weeks of treatment initiation: A CR was defined as having 
≤ 5% blasts in the bone marrow, no evidence of disease, and full recovery of peripheral 
blood counts: platelets > 100,000/μl, and ANC > 1,000/μl. The CR must occur within 12 
weeks of the first dose of protocol-specified therapy. 
o  Best response of CR/CRh*/CRi within 12 weeks of treatment initiation: A CR/CRh*/CRi 
was  defined  as  achieving  any  1  of  the  following  within  12  weeks  of  the  first  dose  of 
protocol-specified therapy: 
  CR as defined above 
  CRh* which is defined as ≤ 5% blasts in the bone marrow, no evidence of disease 
and partial recovery of peripheral blood counts: platelets > 50,000/μl, and ANC > 
500/μl  
  CRi which is defined as ≤ 5% blasts in the bone marrow, no evidence of disease 
and incomplete recovery of peripheral blood counts: platelets > 100,000/μl or 
ANC > 1000 (but not both) 
EMA/CHMP/434726/2018  
Page 17/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
When criteria are met for both CRh* and CRi, CRh* should be reported. When criteria 
are met for both CRi and blast-free marrow, CRi should be reported. 
• 
Event Free Survival (EFS): EFS time was calculated from the time of randomization until the date 
of a disease assessment indicating a relapse after achieving a CR/CRh*/CRi or death, whichever 
occurs first. Subjects who fail to achieve a CR/CRh*/CRi within 12 weeks of treatment initiation 
will be considered treatment failures and assigned an EFS duration of 1 day. Subjects still alive 
and  relapse-free  will  be  censored  on  their  last  disease  assessment  date.  If  the  last  disease 
assessment date is after the date that triggers the analysis, the subject will be censored at the 
analysis trigger date. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
•  Duration of CR: Time from CR until the date of a disease assessment indicating a relapse event or 
death, whichever occurs first  
•  Duration  of  CR/CRh*/CRi:  Time  from  CR/CRh*/CRi  until  the  date  of  a  disease  assessment 
indicating a relapse event or death, whichever occurs first 
•  MRD remission (defined as MRD level below 10-4
 by PCR or flow cytometry) within 12 weeks of 
treatment initiation 
• 
Time to a 10-point decrease from baseline in global health status and quality of life scale (QL2) 
using EORTC QLQ-C30, or EFS event (analyses described in a SSAP)  
•  AlloHSCT with or without blinatumomab treatment: subjects who underwent an allogeneic HSCT 
in remission after protocol treatment and without other intermittent treatment for ALL.  
Secondary Safety Endpoints 
• 
Incidence of adverse events 
•  100-day mortality after alloHSCT 
• 
Incidence of anti-blinatumomab antibody formation 
•  Changes in select vital sign and laboratory parameters 
Exploratory Endpoints 
•  Blinatumomab steady state concentration (Css)

Table 2. Hematologic Response Criteria Definitions (Study 00103311) 
ALL = acute lymphoblastic leukemia; ANC = absolute neutrophil count; CR = complete remission; 
CRh* = complete remission with partial hematologic recovery; CRi = complete remission with incomplete hematologic 
recovery; MRD = minimal residual disease; PCR = polymerase chain reaction. 
Relapse was analyzed by immunophenotyping to determine whether the criteria for B-cell precursor ALL were fulfilled. 
Note: An extramedullary relapse was assessed as a hematologic relapse. All hematologic assessments of bone marrow 
were reviewed in a central reference laboratory. When criteria were met for both CRh* and CRi, CRh* was reported. 
When criteria are met for both CRi and blast-free marrow, CRi was reported.

Sample Size 
In the Full Analysis Set (FAS), if 330 deaths were observed, the study was powered at approximately 85% 
for a 2-sided log-rank test with an overall alpha of 0.05 with a 2:1 randomization ratio and an assumed 
hazard ratio of 0.70. Approximately 400 randomized subjects were needed to observe 330 deaths and 
assumed a control arm median of 4.2 months (Section 16.1.9, Section 3.2). If 300 deaths were observed 
in the study, the unconditional power decreased to approximately 80%. 
Randomization 
Patients  were  randomized  in  a  2:1  ratio  to  receive  blinatumomab  or  1  of  4  prespecified, 
investigator-chosen, SOC chemotherapy regimens as assigned by the IVRS.  
Randomization was stratified by age (< 35 years vs ≥ 35 years), prior salvage therapy (yes vs no), and 
prior alloHSCT (yes vs no) as assessed at the time of consent.  
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open-label.  
Statistical methods 
Statistical hypothesis 
This study was conducted to determine whether blinatumomab was superior to SOC chemotherapy with 
respect  to  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  OS.  The  null  hypothesis  indicated  no  difference  between 
treatments arms with respect to OS vs an alternative hypothesis in which the treatment arms differ. The 
null  hypothesis  was  rejected  if  the  p-value  from  a  2-sided  stratified  log-rank  test  (stratified  by 
randomization factors) was less than the  value specified by the alpha spending function either at the 
interim analysis or the final analysis. The hypothesis would be rejected in favor of blinatumomab if the 
log-rank statistic is in the appropriate direction.  
Analysis Sets 
Primary Analysis Set: The primary analysis of efficacy was performed on all randomized subjects analysed 
according  to  their  randomized  treatment  assignment,  regardless  of  the  treatment  received  (FAS, 
consistent with the intent-to-treat principle). 
Safety  Analysis  Set:  The  primary  analysis  of  safety  was  performed  on  the  safety  analysis  set  which 
included all subjects who received protocol-specified therapy analyzed according to the treatment they 
received. 
PK  Analysis  Set:  All  subjects  who  received  any  infusion  of  blinatumomab  and  had  at  least  1 
pharmacokinetic (PK) sample collected were included in the PK Analysis Set. 
Interim Analysis Set: The formal interim analyses of efficacy included all subjects in the FAS who were 
randomized at the time of the database cutoff on 04 January 2016 which was triggered when 50% and 
75% of the total of 330 deaths have been observed.

Covariates/Subgroup Analyses 
Exploratory analyses examining the consistency of the treatment effect for the primary endpoint and key 
secondary endpoints consisted of performing subgroup analyses of each of the 8 stratum formed by the 
combination  of  stratification  factors  (eg,  subjects  <  35  years  with  prior  salvage  therapy  and  a  prior 
alloHSCT) and for each level of a given stratification factor (eg, subjects < 35 years). Additional subgroup 
analyses were based on the following factors: 
•  Sex (male vs female) 
•  Race/ethnicity  (categories  depended  on  the  data,  all  races  with  <  5%  of  the  total  enrolled 
subjects were pooled together for summary purposes) 
• 
The primary analysis of efficacy was performed on all randomized subjects analysed according to 
their randomized treatment assignment, regardless of the treatment received (FAS, consistent 
with the intent-to-treat principle). 
•  Alternate age grouping (< 35 years vs 35 to 54 vs 55 to 64 vs ≥ 65 years) 
•  Number of prior salvage therapies (0 vs 1 vs ≥ 2) 
•  Repeated for subjects without a prior alloHSCT 
• 
Provided adequate relapse data existed, relapse/refractory status (primary refractory or 1 prior 
relapse vs ≥ 2 prior relapses) 
•  Repeated for subjects without a prior alloHSCT 
•  Central laboratory baseline bone marrow blasts (< 50% vs ≥ 50%) 
•  Central laboratory baseline platelet count (< 50,000 vs 50,000 to 100,000 vs > 100,000/μL) 
• 
Intended SOC chemotherapy regimen collected for all subjects before randomization  
•  CD20 status (positive vs negative) 
•  CD22 status (positive vs negative) 
•  Region (United States vs Europe vs rest of world) 
Interim Analysis and Early Stopping Guidelines 
Two formal interim analyses were planned and overseen by an external independent DMC. The DMC was 
scheduled to meet when approximately 50% (165 deaths) and 75% (248 deaths) of the total number of 
OS events were observed. In addition, the DMC assessed safety approximately every 6 months. 
There were 3 planned reasons to stop the study: 
• 
For futility according to nonbinding boundaries from a Pampallona-Tsiatis-type (Pampallona and 
Tsiatis, 1994) beta spending function with a shape parameter of -0.5, safety 
•  Benefit based on an O’Brien-Fleming (1979)-type alpha-spending function (the critical p-values 
corresponding to this spending function were 0.0031 for the first interim analysis, 0.0183 for the 
second  interim  analysis,  and  0.044  for  the  primary  [ie,  final]  analysis  if  the  interim  analyses 
occurred precisely at 50% and 75% of deaths). 
•  Safety concerns

The primary analysis (OS) was performed on the FAS. A 2-sided stratified log-rank test, stratified by the 
randomization factors, was used to determine if OS was superior in the blinatumomab arm compared to 
SOC chemotherapy arm. In addition, a hazard ratio with a 95% CI was estimated from a stratified Cox 
regression  model.  The  KM  summaries  (Kaplan  and  Meier,  1958)  were  performed  by  treatment  arm. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed on a subset of subjects who received protocol-specified therapy. The 
KM summaries included KM curves, KM proportions at select time points, KM quartiles (when estimable), 
the  number  of  subjects  with  events,  the  number  of  subjects  censored,  and  the  pattern  of  censoring. 
Two-sided 95% CIs were provided for the estimates of KM quartiles (Brookmeyer and Crowley, 1982), KM 
proportions (Kalbfleisch and Prentice, 1980) and binomial properties (Clopper and Pearson, 1934).

Conduct of the study 
This study was conducted at 101 centers in 21 countries and 5 continents including Europe (65.4%), Latin 
America, North America (US 11.4%), Asia and Australia. The study was overseen by an independent data 
monitoring committee (DMC), established to monitor safety and efficacy. Central laboratories evaluated 
Human  antimurine  antibodies  (HAMAs),  lymphocyte  subsets,  pharmacogenetic,  biomarker,  bone 
marrow,  and  MRD  assessments,  while  routine  hematology,  clinical  chemistry,  coagulation,  urinalysis, 
immunoglobulin G (IgG), and pregnancy testing were performed at local laboratories.  
On 28 January 2016, the DMC recommended that the study be stopped for benefit because the p-value = 
0.011  was  less  than  the  prespecified  threshold  of  0.0183  for  statistical  significance  testing  for  OS. 
Subsequently,  on  4  February  2016,  Amgen  notified  the  regulatory  authorities  of  the  DMC 
recommendation and Amgen’s decision to end the study early. Then, on 18 February 2016, the long-term 
follow-up part of the study was discontinued prematurely.

Other secondary efficacy endpoints: 
Duration of hematologic response 
The duration of the best hematologic response of CR and CR/CRh*/CRi were calculated only for subjects 
who achieve a CR or CR/CRh*/CRi, from the date a documented hematologic response until the earliest 
date of a disease assessment indicating a relapse event or death, whichever occurs first. Subjects who do 
not have a relapse event will be censored on their last disease assessment date.  
Of the 112 subjects who had a best response of CR within 12 weeks of treatment initiation, 49 subjects 
had an event and 63 subjects were censored. The median time to an event was 7.8 months (95% CI: 2.2, 
19.0) in the SOC chemotherapy arm compared with 8.3 months (95% CI: 5.7, 10.7) in the blinatumomab 
arm.  
Of the 152 subjects who had a best response of CR/CRh*/CRi within 12 weeks of treatment initiation, 75 
subjects had an event and 77 subjects were censored. The median time to an event was 4.6 months (95% 
CI:  1.8,  19.0)  in  the  SOC  chemotherapy  arm  compared  with  7.3  months  (95%  CI:  5.8,  9.9)  in  the 
blinatumomab arm.  
All subjects were alive at the time of the data cutoff date of 4 January 2016. A summary of the duration 
of CR results is displayed in Table 19.

MRD response within 12 weeks of treatment initiation 
An MRD response was defined as an MRD level below 10-4 by PCR or flow cytometry. “Complete” MRD 
remission was defined as the occurrence of an MRD level below the limit of detection. The proportion of 
subjects who had an MRD response within 12 weeks of treatment initiation in the FAS is presented in

Global health status and quality of life 
In TOWER study, Health related quality of life (HRQoL) reported by patients were measured using the 
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire – Core 30 
(EORTC QLQ-C30). In a post-hoc sensitivity analysis, compared to SOC, Blincyto consistently delayed the 
time to clinically meaningful deterioration of HRQoL (≥ 10 point worsening from baseline) for global health 
status [median BLINCYTO versus SOC: 8.1 months versus 1.0 month; HR = 0.60 (95% CI = 0.42, 0.85)],

The primary analysis of OS between 2 arms used 2-sided log-rank test, stratified by 
3 randomisation factors: age (<35 years vs >35 years), prior salvage therapy (yes 
vs no), and prior alloHSCT (yes vs no) 
OS primary analysis was triggered when 75% (248 subjects) of the total number of 
deaths (330) were observed. 
On 28/01/2016, the DMC recommended stopping the study because the p-value 
=0.011 less than threshold for statistical significance for OS p=0.0183

4.2.2.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy  
In FAS set, the median OS was 4.0 months (95% CI: 2.9, 5.3) in the SOC chemotherapy arm compared 
with 7.7 months (95% CI: 5.6, 9.6) in the blinatumomab arm with the hazard ratio 0.71 (95% CI: 0.55, 
0.93)  between  treatment  arms  favoring  blinatumomab.  The  median  follow-up  time  was  similar  (11.8 
months  in  SOC  vs  11.7  months  in  blinatumomab  arm).  The  KM  survival  curves  started  to  separate 
between 2 arms around 3 months (58.4% in SOC vs 67.3% in blinatumomab) corresponding to 2-cycle 
induction phase of blinatumomab treatment (6 weeks/cycle). The largest difference was observed around 
6 months of treatment (38.5% in SOC vs 53.9% in blinatumomab). KM survival estimates came near at 
12 months and were similar at 18 months. Based on the stratified log-rank test, there was a statistically 
significant improvement in OS for blinatumomab as compared to defined investigator’s choice of SOC 
chemotherapy (p = 0.012) according to the pre-specified threshold p-value <0.0194. This difference is 
considered clinically meaningful. 
Consistent results were observed after censoring at the time of HSCT; median OS, censored at the time 
of HSCT, was 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.3, 8.8) in the blinatumomab arm and 3.9 months (95% CI: 2.8, 4.9) 
in the SOC arm (HR, 0.66; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.88; p value = 0.004). The mortality rate following alloHSCT 
among all responders who did not receive anti-leukemic therapy was 10/38 (26.3%; 95% CI: 13.4, 43.1) 
in the blinatumomab arm and 3/12 (25%; 95% CI: 5.5, 57.2) in the SOC group; such mortality rate at 
EMA/CHMP/434726/2018  
Page 56/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
100 days post alloHSCT was 4/38 (12.4%; 95% CI: 4.8%, 29.9%) in the blinatumomab arm and 0/12 
(0%; 95% CI: not estimable) in the SOC group.  
The receipt of an alloHSCT was based upon the investigator’s discretion in this phase 3 study; subjects 
were not randomized by whether or when an HSCT was undertaken. Thus this trial could not distinguish 
the effect of HSCT on clinical benefit such as OS or RFS. The impact of blinatumomab as salvage induction 
therapy on HSCT could be confounded by different baseline and HSCT characteristics. In order to further 
characterise the effect of blinatumomab in patients following alloHSCT the MAH commited to evaluate the 
impact  of  blinatumomab  compared  to  SOC  chemotherapy  on  HSCT  post-blinatumomab  with  careful 
collection  of  all  relevant  data  concerning  HSCT  including  a  control  group.  Given  that  the  benefit  risk 
balance for the overall population was concluded as positive, this study was categorized as a Category 3 
study in the RMP. 
The  submission  of  the  draft  protocol  of  this  Study  20170610  “Overall  survival  and  incidence  of 
transplant-related  adverse  events  in  relapsed/refractory  B-cell  acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia  (ALL) 
patients after allogeneic stem cell transplant: Induction with blinatumomab treatment versus induction 
with chemotherapy” is planned in November 2018, and the final report submission is expected in April 
2025. Submission of interim results should be provided in Q2 2022.  
The MAH will capture all SAEs related to infection, not only serious infections leading to/contributing to 
death, during routine post-transplant follow up and to collect efficacy and safety data on most patients 
who receive HSCT in the EU (see discussion on clinical safety). 
Regarding the secondary endpoints, statistically and clinically significant increases of CR/CRh*/CRi and 
MRD negativity were observed in the blinatumomab arm as compared to the SOC chemotherapy arm 
(43.9% vs 24.3%, 23.6% vs 9.0% respectively). 
Following the SAG advice, the MAH also is requested to re-open the Phase 3 study 00103311 (Tower)  for 
collecting long-term efficacy and safety data to provide analysis of the effect of blinatumomab on OS 
when compared to standard of care chemotherapy for the complete population studied (see RMP). 
In  addition  to  the  above,  the  CHMP  also  considered  that  the  ongoing  studies  in  first  line  B-ALL  and 
B-precursor paediatric ALL are of great interest to assess the B/R of blinatumomab and how it would 
compare in relation to HSCT in the management of childhood ALL (COG-AALL1331) and the direct clinical 
benefit (eg.OS) of chemotherapy combined with blinatumomab among MRD-positive subjects following 
front-line therapy (ECOG-E1910). 
Additional expert consultation 
Following the CHMP request, a Scientific Advisory Group meeting was convened on 22 November 2017 to 
provide advice on the following question: 
After treatment with Blincyto, HSCT (which is normally the only potentially curative option) 
appears as negatively impacting outcomes (OS and RFS). Please discuss the target 
population for Blincyto, in particular if you foresee that the target population would be 
limited to patients never eligible to HSCT? If so, would you consider that this population is 
possible to define prospectively, before treatment? 
The SAG experts concluded that for relapsed/refractory disease, the target population corresponds to the 
population  treated  in  the  prospective,  randomized,  phase  3  trial  (TOWER)  including  patients  with 
Ph-negative  B-cell  precursor  ALL  refractory  to  primary  induction  therapy  or  to  salvage  with  intensive 
combination chemotherapy, first relapse with the first remission lasting less than 12 months, second or 
greater relapse, or relapse at any time after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Longer follow-up should 
EMA/CHMP/434726/2018  
Page 57/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
be requested post-approval to confirm in secondary (exploratory) analyses the long term efficacy and 
assess  if  a  long-term  benefit  can  be  established  or  if  the  effect  on  OS  is  mainly  transient.  It  is 
acknowledged  that  due  to  cross-over,  treatment  switching  and  other  uncontrolled  events  the  effect 
currently observed may be diluted in the long-term, but this can be explored using statistical techniques. 
Conclusion on clinical efficacy  
In  view  of  the  SAG  advice,  and  given  that  this  is  the  only  relevant  comparative  study  in  this  target 
population and that it is generally good practice to follow-up all patients until death, if feasible, the MAH 
has  been  requested  to  collect  as  complete  survival  data  as  possible  for  the Phase  3  study  00103311 
(Tower). Although the difficulties of re-opening follow-up for a study are acknowledged, information on 
overall survival should be readily available. As it would be of interest to obtain a more precise estimation 
of the long-term effect, the MAH will investigate if there is an additional effect on survival affecting also 
events that occur later in the course of the disease. Information on this aspect will aid in exploring the 
effect size in terms of long-term efficacy in the context of the current established efficacy. Although no 
major  differences  are  expected,  the  additional  follow-up  will  provide  more  precise  estimates  and  the 
possibility for further analyses (see RMP). 
Statistically and clinically significant increases of OS, CR/CRh*/CRi and MRD negativity were observed in 
the blinatumomab arm as compared to the SOC chemotherapy arm (7.7 months vs 4.0 months, 43.9% vs 
24.3%,  23.6%  vs  9.0%  respectively).  The  SmPC  has  been  updated  in  section  5.1  with  the  data 
submitted. In conclusion, the Phase 3 study 00103311 data confirmed the efficacy of blinatumumab in 
adult  patients  with  Philadelphia  chromosome-negative  relapsed/refractory  B-cell  precursor  acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and the CHMP agreed that the specific obligation has been fufilled.

4.2.3.  Safety 
Introduction 
The primary analysis of safety was performed on the safety analysis set which included all subjects who 
received protocol-specified therapy analyzed according to the treatment they received.

a.Cumulative dose was the sum of (duration of each infusion) × (dose of each infusion). 
b.A subject may have had more than 1 reason for an interruption. 
c Adverse events that led to treatment interruption were obtained from 2 different case report forms, the adverse 
event case report form and the investigational product case report form . The numbers between the 2 case report 
forms do not match. 
Note: All exposure records with the start date before the data cutoff date were included. Exposure was recorded from 
the treatment start date until the last dose date plus 30 days or before the data cutoff date 
(04 January 2016), whichever came first.

a A subject may have had more than 1 reason for an interruption. 
b Adverse events that led to treatment interruption were obtained from 2 different case report forms, the adverse 
event case report form and the investigational product case report form. The numbers between the 2 case report forms 
do not match most likely because other reasons may have been given for treatment interruption in the investigational 
product CRF rather than adverse event. 
Adverse events 
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) regardless of causality  
EMA/CHMP/434726/2018

TEAE were collected from the first dose of study treatment until 30 days after the last dose or the safety 
follow-up visit. AEs starting before the start of treatment that worsened later (after start of treatment) 
are also defined as treatment-emergent.  
As  of  the  data  cutoff  date  of  4  January  2016,  108/109  subjects  (99.1%)  in  the  SOC  chemotherapy 
treatment arm and 263/267 subjects (98.5%) in the blinatumomab treatment arm had experienced at 
least 1 TEAE. Fatal TEAE were reported for 19 subjects (17.4%) in the SOC chemotherapy arm and 51 
subjects (19.1%) in blinatumomab arm.

Note: Adverse events were coded according to MedDRA version 18.1. Preferred terms were presented in descending 
order of subject incidence in the blinatumomab arm. 
The units for exposure-adjusted event rates are number of events per 100 subject years. 
Exposure time for each individual subject was the date at first dose until the last dose plus 30 days or data cutoff date, 
whichever came first. The total exposure was the sum of exposure time across subjects.

Events of interest 
Events  of  special  interest  for  blinatumomab  included  central  neuropsychiatric  events  due  to  direct 
neurotoxicities  (neurologic  events),  CRS,  infections,  elevated  liver  enzymes,  infusion  reactions 
considering  duration,  TLS,  acute  pancreatitis,  embolic  and  thrombotic  events,  medication  errors  and 
product use issues, cytopenias (including febrile neutropenia and neutropenia), lymphopenias, decreased 
immunoglobulins,  and  events  suggestive  of  leukoencephalopathy  (including  progressive  multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy [PML]). 
Neurologic Event 
Treatment-emergent neurologic events and serious neurologic events were more frequently reported in 
the  blinatumomab  arm  than  in  the  SOC  chemotherapy  arm  (61.0%  vs  49.5%,  6.7%  vs  1.8% 
respectively).  One  subject  (0.4%)  who  was  treated  with  blinatumomab  had  a  fatal  neurologic  event 
preferred term (PT: completed suicide). More subjects interrupted or discontinued study treatment in 
blinatumomab arm than in SOC arm due to central neurologic events (0.9% vs 6.4%, 0.9% vs 3.7% 
respectively).

Note: Adverse events were coded according to MedDRA version 18.1. Subject incidence of  2% in either treatment 
arm was reported. 
Exposure time for each individual subject was the date at first dose until the last dose plus 30 days or data cutoff date, 
whichever came first. The total exposure was the sum of exposure time across subjects. The units for 
EMA/CHMP/434726/2018

exposure-adjusted event rates are number of events per 100 subject years. Treatment-emergent adverse events 
occurred between date at first dose until the last dose plus 30 days or data cutoff date, whichever occurred first. Rows 
were sorted by preferred term in descending order of frequency in the blinatumomab arm. 
Serious neurologic events for blinatumomab included encephalopathy (n=4), aphasia (n=3), and all other 
events occurred in 1 subject. 
The median time to first onset of neurologic events was 7.0 days for both treatment arms; however, the 
mean (SD) time to first onset of neurologic events was earlier for SOC chemotherapy (11.4 [10.6] days) 
compared with blinatumomab (18.5 [29.0] days). The median time (range) to first onset of grade ≥ 3 
neurologic events was also earlier for subjects who received SOC chemotherapy (12.0 days; 1 to 34 days) 
compared  with  subjects  who  received  blinatumomab  (18.0  days;  1  to  401  days).  The  duration  of 
treatment-emergent direct neurotoxicities (neurologic events) is presented in Table 37.

Activities; SOC = standard of care 
All neurologic events resolved for 32 of 54 subjects in SOC arm (59.3%; 32/54) and for 105 subjects of 
163 subjects in the blinatumomab arm (64.4%; 105/163). The median time to resolution for any grade 
was  5.0  days  (range:  1  to  380  days)  and  6.0  days  (1  to  313  days)  for  SOC  chemotherapy  and 
blinatumomab respectively. 
Leukoencephalopathy (including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML]) 
In the phase 3 study, events suggestive of leukoencephalopathy only occurred in 2 subjects (0.7%) who 
received  blinatumomab.  Both  events  (1  event  reported  as  grade  4  leukoencephalopathy  and  1  event 
reported as grade 3 PML) were serious and led to treatment discontinuation; however, neither event was 
fatal nor was the diagnosis of PML confirmed in either subject 
Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) 
CRS was specific to subjects who received blinatumomab (16.1%; 43 subjects), no case was reported in 
SOC chemotherapy arm.  
The  most  frequently  identified  CRS  event  (preferred  term)  was  CRS  (38  subjects)  followed  by 
histiocytosis hematophagic (4 subjects) and cytokine storm (1 subject). 
Serious  CRS  events  occurred  in  10  subjects  (3.7%):  7  subjects  experienced  CRS  and  3  subjects 
experienced  histiocytosis hematophagic.  Treatment was  manageable,  the  cases  were  not  fatal,  and 1 
subject resumed treatment. 
Thirteen subjects (4.9%) experienced grade ≥ 3 CRS events and 1 subject (0.4%) experienced a grade 4 
CRS  event.  CRS  events  led  to  treatment  interruption  for  13  subjects  (4.9%)  and  treatment 
discontinuation for 3 subjects (1.1%). 
The median time (range) to first onset of any CRS events was 2.0 days (1 to 254 days) and the median 
time to first onset of grade ≥ 3 CRS was 4.0 days (1 to 246 days). 
Of 43 subjects experienced CRS in blinatumomab arm events, all events resolved for 39 subjects (90.7%; 
39/43). The median time (range) to CRS resolution was 4.0 days (1 to 21 days).  
Infections 
More infections were reported in subjects receiving SOC chemotherapy than in the blinatumomab arm 
(72.5% vs 64.0%). Serious infections were similar between treatment arms (SOC chemotherapy 30.3% 
vs blinatumomab 28.1%). Fatal infections were also similar between 2 arms (SOC chemotherapy: 11.9% 
[13 subjects]; blinatumomab: 11.2% [30 subjects]). Infections leading to treatment interruptions were 
lower  in  SOC  arm  than  in  blinatumomab  arm  (1.8%  vs  7.5%).  Infections  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuations  were  similar  between  treatment  arms  (SOC  chemotherapy:  4.6%;  blinatumomab: 
3.4%). 
The incidences of upper respiratory tract infection (0.9% vs 7.1%), nasopharyngitis (0.0% vs 4.9%), and 
urinary  tract  infection  (1.8%  vs  4.9%)  were  lower  in  SOC  arm  than  in  blinatumomab  arm  (>2% 
difference). All other identified infections were similar (< 2% difference) or lower for the blinatumomab 
arm compared with the SOC chemotherapy arm.

The incidences of serious pneumonia (1.8% in SOC vs 3.7% in blinatumomab) and serious device related 
infection  (0.9%  in  SOC  vs  2.2%  in  blinatumomab)  were  higher  for  blinatumomab  than  for  SOC 
chemotherapy.  All  other  identified  infections  were  similar  (<  1%  difference)  or  lower  for  the 
blinatumomab arm compared with the SOC chemotherapy arm.

Elevated liver enzymes 
Similar incidences of elevated liver enzyme events were identified in subjects from both treatment arms: 
SOC chemotherapy, 24.8%; blinatumomab, 21.7%.  
Serious  elevated  liver  enzyme  events  (n=3)  were  identified  exclusively  in  subjects  who  received 
blinatumomab:  2  subjects  had  blood  bilirubin  increased  and  1  subject  had  transaminases  increased. 
Grade  ≥ 3  elevated  liver  enzyme  events  were  similar  between  2  arms  (14.7%  SOC,  12.7% 
blinatumomab).  
No subjects in either treatment arm were identified with fatal liver enzyme events. Elevated liver enzyme 
events that led to treatment interruptions (1.5%; 4 subjects) and treatment discontinuations (0.4%; 1 
subject) were identified in the blinatumomab arm with no interruptions or discontinuation reported in the 
SOC chemotherapy arm. 
Transaminases increased (% difference: 3.7%) and hepatic enzyme increased (% difference: 2.1%) were 
higher in blinatumomab than in SOC arm. All other elevated liver enzyme events were similar (< 2% 
difference) or higher for the SOC chemotherapy arm compared with blinatumomab arm.

Infusion reactions considering duration 
The incidence of suggestive infusion reactions (ie events starts within 48h of infusion initiation with no 
duration  restriction)  was  lower  in  the  SOC  chemotherapy  arm  (8.3%;  n=9)  compared  with  the 
blinatumomab arm (34.1%; n=91). Regardless of treatment, no subjects were identified with serious 
infusion reactions. No infusion reactions led to treatment discontinuation or were life-threatening (grade 
4) or fatal. 
Infusion  reactions  leading  to  treatment  interruption  were  specific  to  9  subjects  (3.4%)  who  received 
blinatumomab.

The subject incidence of TLS was 0.9% (1 subject) in the SOC chemotherapy arm and 3.7% (10 subjects) 
in the blinatumomab arm and all events were reported as the preferred term TLS. 
Treatment-emergent  serious  TLS  was  identified  exclusively  for  3  subjects  (1.1%)  who  received 
blinatumomab.  Grade  ≥ 3  treatment-emergent  TLS  was  identified  in  1  subject  (0.9%)  in  the  SOC 
chemotherapy arm and 8 subjects (3.0%) in the blinatumomab arm. 
Regardless of treatment, no subjects were identified with fatal TLS. 
Treatment-emergent TLS leading to treatment interruption and treatment discontinuation occurred in 1 
subject each (0.4%) who received blinatumomab. 
Acute pancreatitis 
In the phase 3 study, treatment-emergent pancreatitis was reported for 2 subjects, 1 subject from each 
treatment arm. Both events were grade 3 in severity. For the subject who received SOC chemotherapy, 
the event was serious, led to treatment interruption, and was considered by the investigator as related to 
SOC chemotherapy.  
Embolic and thrombotic events 
The subject incidence rates for treatment-emergent embolic and thrombotic events were similar with SOC 
chemotherapy (8.3%) compared with blinatumomab (6.0%). Subjects who received SOC chemotherapy 
had subject incidence rates of serious, grade ≥ 3 and grade ≥ 4 embolic and thrombotic events of 1.8% 
(2 subjects) for each. Subjects who received blinatumomab had subject incidence rates of serious, grade

≥  3,  and  grade  ≥  4  events  of  1.1%,  1.5%,  and  0.7%,  respectively.  One  subject  who  received 
blinatumomab experienced a fatal embolic and thrombotic event of hemorrhagic stroke.  
One subject each was identified with embolic and thrombotic events that led to treatment interruption 
(0.4%; 1 subject) or treatment discontinuation (0.4%; 1 subject) specific to the blinatumomab arm. 
By preferred term, in the SOC chemotherapy arm, device occlusion was identified for 3 subjects (2.8%); 
all other embolic and thrombotic events were identified for 1 subject (0.9%) each. In the blinatumomab 
arm, 2 subjects each (0.7%) were identified with deep vein thrombosis, device occlusion, thrombosis, 
and transient ischemic attack; all other embolic and thrombotic events were identified for 1 subject each 
(0.4%). 
Serious  embolic  and  thrombotic  events  were  identified  for  2  subjects  (1.8%)  who  received  SOC 
chemotherapy  including  hemiplegia  and  peripheral artery  thrombosis,  and  for  3  subjects  (1.1%)  who 
received blinatumomab including acute myocardial infarction, hemorrhagic stroke, and hemiparesis.

Medication errors and product use issues 
For  this  study,  a  dose  of  >  10%  higher  than  the  intended  blinatumomab  dose  was  considered  to  be 
clinically important, reported as a serious adverse event, and categorized as “other medically important 
serious event” regardless of outcome (with or without associated adverse events).  
All medication errors occurred exclusively in the blinatumomab arm, 12 subjects (4.5%) were identified 
with medication errors in which all were deemed serious events per protocol-specified requirements. Of 
the 12 subjects who experienced medications, 11 of these events involved blinatumomab administration 
and  1  event  involved  another  chemotherapy  agent.  None  of  the  11  subjects  who  experienced 
EMA/CHMP/434726/2018  
Page 79/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
blinatumomab  administration  errors  experienced  other  adverse  events  in  temporal  relation  to  the 
medication error. No medication errors were fatal or led to discontinuation. 
Medication  errors  (preferred  terms)  included  overdose  (8  subjects;  3.0%),  accidental  overdose  (3 
subjects,  1.1%),  and  medication  error  (1  subject;  0.4%).  Grade  ≥  3  medication  errors  included 
accidental overdose (3 subjects; 1.1%) and medication error (1 subject; 0.4%). 
Cytopenias (including febrile neutropenia and neutropenia) 
In the phase 3 study, the subject incidence rate of treatment-emergent cytopenia events was higher with 
SOC  chemotherapy  (72.5%)  compared  with  blinatumomab  (59.9%).  Serious  cytopenia  events  were 
similar between treatment arms: 15.6% with SOC chemotherapy; 12.7% with blinatumomab. Grade ≥ 3 
and grade ≥ 4 treatment-emergent cytopenia events occurred at higher subject incidence rate with SOC 
chemotherapy  (67.9%  and  52.8%,  respectively)  compared  with  blinatumomab  (45.9%  and  28.8%, 
respectively).  Cytopenias  that  led  to  interruptions  or  discontinuation  were  similar  between  SOC 
chemotherapy  (2.8%  and  3.0%,  respectively)  and  blinatumomab  arms  (1.8%  versus  or  0.7%, 
respectively).  
Four  subjects  (1.5%)  had  fatal  cytopenia  events  in  the  blinatumomab  arm  (2  subjects  experienced 
neutropenic sepsis, and 1 subject each experienced pancytopenia and febrile bone marrow aplasia), while 
no subjects in the SOC chemotherapy arm had fatal cytopenia events.  
The subject incidences of all identified cytopenia events were higher or similar (< 2% difference) for the 
SOC chemotherapy arm compared with the blinatumomab arm.

Adverse events were coded according to MedDRA version 18.1. 
Lymphopenia 
A similar subject incidence of treatment-emergent lymphopenia was identified between treatment arms: 
3.7% (4 subjects) in the SOC chemotherapy arm and 1.9% (5 subjects) in the blinatumomab arm. No 
subjects  were  identified  with  serious  or  fatal  lymphopenia  and  no  treatment-emergent  events  were 
identified  that  led  to  treatment  interruption  or  treatment  discontinuation.  The  incidence  of  identified 
treatment-emergent grade ≥ 3 and grade ≥ 4 lymphopenia was similar between treatment arms (SOC 
chemotherapy:  grade  ≥ 3  [3.7%],  grade  ≥ 4  [2.8%];  blinatumomab:  grade  ≥ 3  [1.5%],  grade  ≥ 4 
[0.7%]).

Decreased immunoglobulins  
In the phase 3 study, the subject incidence rates for decreased immunoglobulin events were lower with 
SOC 
chemotherapy 
(1.8%) 
compared  with  blinatumomab 
(9.7%)  principally  due 
to 
hypogammaglobulinemia (0.9% vs 6.0%). No decreased immunoglobulins events were deemed serious 
or were fatal in either treatment arm. Grade ≥ 3 events of decreased immunoglobulin events were only 
observed in blinatumomab arm (2.6%, 7 subjects), 1 of which was grade 4 in severity.

Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Table 45 Abnormal Changes in Vital Signs (Safety Analysis Set) 
In the phase 3 study, blood pressure was the most frequently reported abnormal vital sign change. In 
subjects who received SOC chemotherapy, the most frequent change was low systolic blood pressure (≤ 
90 mmHg; 14.7%); whereas, in subjects who received blinatumomab, the most frequent change was low 
diastolic blood pressure (≤ 50 mmHg; 17.2%).  
In the phase 3 study, there is no evidence of increased risk associated vital sign changes from baseline for 
subjects who received blinatumomab compared with subjects who received SOC chemotherapy. Changes 
in vital signs observed for blinatumomab in the phase 3 study are consistent with those observed in the 
phase 2 study. 
Serious adverse events and death 
Treatment-emergent SAE 
The incidence of SAEs (regardless of relationship to study treatment) was higher in blinatumomab arm 
than in SOC chemotherapy arm (61.8%, 165/267 versus 45.0%, 49/109) (Table 12-4). In both arms, the 
most affected system organ class was “Infections and Infestations” (30.3%, 33/109 in SOC vs 28.1% 
75/267 blinatumomab arm). The most frequent SAE events in the  SOC chemotherapy treatment arm 
were  febrile  neutropenia  (11.0%;  12/109),  sepsis  (6.4%;  7/109),  and  septic  shock  (2.8%;  3/109); 
whereas,  in  the  blinatumomab  arm  they  were  febrile  neutropenia  (8.6%;  23/267),  pyrexia  (6.0%; 
16/267), and sepsis (4.9%; 13/267). 
EMA/CHMP/434726/2018  
Page 83/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
As compared to SOC arm, SAEs in “General disorders and administration site conditions” (1.8% vs 10.1% 
), “Nervous system disorders” (3.7% vs 7.1%), “Injury, poisoning and procedural complications” (0.9% 
vs 5.6%), Immune system disorders (0.0% vs 4.1%) were more frequently reported in subjects receiving 
blinatumomab.

Deaths 
In  the  phase  3  study,  a  total of  19  subjects  (17.4%)  in  the  SOC  chemotherapy  arm  and  51  subjects 
(19.1%) in the blinatumomab arm had fatal TEAE. For both arm, Infections and Infestations was the most 
affected system organ class (SOC chemotherapy: 11.9%; blinatumomab: 11.2%), principally due to fatal 
sepsis (SOC chemotherapy: 3.7%; blinatumomab: 3.0%).  
In  this  open  label  study,  fatal  TEAE  were  considered  related  to  study  drug  by  investigators  for  7.3% 
(8/109)  of  subjects  in  the  SOC  treatment  arm  and  3.0%  (8/267)  of  subjects  in  the  blinatumomab 
treatment arm. In the blinatumomab arm, 7 of the 8 deaths were in the setting of severe infections and 
1 death was reported as respiratory failure, in an unspecified setting as limited information was provided 
on treatments administered, imaging, or blood culture results. Although the deaths were deemed related 
EMA/CHMP/434726/2018  
Page 84/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
to blinatumomab, infectious deaths occurring in the setting of active disease would not be unexpected in 
this  patient  population,  regardless  of  the  administration  of  blinatumomab.  Similarly  in  the  SOC 
chemotherapy arm, 7 of the 8 deaths deemed related to the SOC chemotherapy arm were attributed to 
infections and occurred in the setting of active disease. The remaining death was reported as acute kidney 
injury, with limited information provided.

Laboratory findings 
In the phase 3 study, shifts from grade 0 or 1 to grade 4 were noted in serum chemistry parameters in 
subjects from both treatment arms. The shifts in serum hematology parameters occurred at a higher 
subject  incidence  rate  for  subjects  who  received  SOC  chemotherapy  compared  with  subjects  who 
received blinatumomab. For subjects who received SOC chemotherapy, the highest number of shifts from 
grade 0 or 1 to grade 4 occurred in lymphocytes (60 subjects; 55.0%), WBC count (35 subjects; 32.1%), 
and  platelets  (34  subjects;  31.2%);  whereas,  in  subjects  who  received  blinatumomab  the  highest 
number of shifts occurred in WBC count (73 subjects; 27.3%), neutrophils (56 subjects; 21.0%), and 
lymphocytes (46 subjects; 17.2%). Median decreases in immunoglobulin levels from baseline to cycle 1 
and  cycle  2  were  less  pronounced  with  SOC  chemotherapy  compared  with  blinatumomab  treatment 
EMA/CHMP/434726/2018

(-0.30 and -1.13 versus -1.35 and -2.25, respectively); a response that has been reported previously for 
blinatumomab (Zugmaier et al, 2014).  
In  the  phase  3  study,  there  is  no  evidence  of  increased  risk  associated  with  serum  chemistry  or 
hematology changes from baseline for subjects who received blinatumomab compared with subjects who 
received SOC chemotherapy. The types and frequencies of serum chemistry and hematology changes 
from baseline, and decreased immunoglobulins observed in the phase 3 study for blinatumomab were 
consistent with those observed in the phase 2 study. 
Safety in special population 
A summary of TEAE by race, sex, and age in the safety analysis set are presented in Table 48. 
Table 48 Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by Race, Sex, and Age (Safety Analysis Set) 
Immunological events 
In the phase 3 study, subjects who were randomized to blinatumomab were tested for anti-blinatumomab 
antibodies before the first dose of blinatumomab on day 1 of cycle 1, on day 29 of cycle 2, and at the 
safety follow-up visit. 
At the time of the data cutoff data, data for immunogenicity were available for 247 subjects. Of these 247 
subjects,  4  subjects  (1.6%)  who  received  blinatumomab  tested  positive  for  anti-blinatumomab 
antibodies: 1 subject tested positive for binding antibodies, 2 subjects tested positive for both binding and 
neutralizing  antibodies  and  1  subject  had  no  results  for  the  binding  antibody,  but  tested  positive  for 
EMA/CHMP/434726/2018  
Page 88/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
neutralizing antibody. Review of the hematologic response in these 4 subjects showed that 3 subjects 
achieved a CR and 1 developed progressive disease. No conclusions can be made from these data.  
According to information in “Anti-Blinatumomab Antibody Assays Report”, valid results of paired samples 
from  pre-dose  and  post-dose  were  available  for  171  patients.  In  5  of  these  patients  (2.9%) 
anti-blinatumomab immune response was detected in serum after at least 2 treatments respectively but 
still in low levels (titer ranged from < 10 to 21870). Using the blinatumomab neutralizing assay it could 
be demonstrated that the ADAs had neutralizing effects on the bioactivity of blinatumomab (except in two 
patients but this is likely resulted from the poorer sensitivity of the Nab assay). Two patients who showed 
very low titers at time point C2D29 (<10) were classified as negative for the presence of ADAs at SFU. 
Thus, in the context of clinical study 00103311, blinatumomab has been shown to cause the formation of 
anti-drug-antibodies in 2.9% of patients treated with blinatumomab and analyzed in this immunogenicity 
study. 
Interruption/Discontinuation due to AES 
Regardless of treatment, a treatment interruption was defined as lasting more than 7 days, but less than 
14 days. Treatment restarted within the same cycle in subjects who had interruptions less than 7 days in 
length. Treatment was discontinued in subjects who had an interruption more than 14 days in length. 
AE leading to treatment interruption 
TEAE  leading  to  treatment  interruption  regardless  of  relationship  were  reported  in  5.5%  (6/109)  of 
subjects receiving SOC chemotherapy and 32.2% (86/267) of subjects receiving blinatumomab.  
Two  highest  subject  incidence  of  TEAE  leading  to  SOC  chemotherapy  interruption  was  in  Blood  and 
Lymphatic  System  Disorders  and  Gastrointestinal  Disorders  (2.8%;  3/109  each)  in  SOC  arm;  and  in 
Infections  and  Infestations  (7.5%;  20/267),  Nervous  system  disorders  and  General  disorders  and 
administration site conditions (7.1%, 19/267 each)  for blinatumomab. By preferred term, in the SOC 
chemotherapy arm, only febrile neutropenia led to treatment interruption in more than 1 subjects (n=2). 
In the blinatumomab arm, TEAE that led to blinatumomab interruption in ≥ 3 subjects were CRS (4.1%; 
11/267), pyrexia (3.0%, 8/267), neutropenia (1.9%, 5/267), device-related infection (1.5%; 4/267), as 
well as seizure, somnolence, tremor and confusional state (1.1%, 3/267 each).  
SAE  leading  to  treatment  interruption  were  reported  in  3.7%  (4/109)  of  subjects  receiving  SOC 
chemotherapy  and  19.5%  (52/267)  of  subjects  receiving  blinatumomab.  In  SOC  arm,  serious  febrile 
neutropenia (n=2) was the only SAE leading to SOC chemotherapy interruption in more than 1 subjects. 
In  blinatumomab  arm,  SAE  leading  to  blinatumomab  interruption  in  ≥  2  subjects  were  CRS  (2.2%; 
6/267),  pyrexia  (1.1%;  3/267)  as  well  as  encephalopathy,  Bacterial  infection,  Bacterial  sepsis, 
Escherichia infection and Pneumonia (0.7%, 2/267 each).  
AE leading to treatment discontinuation 
TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation regardless of relationship were reported in 8.3% (9/109) of 
subjects  receiving  SOC  chemotherapy  and  12.4%  (33/267)  of  subjects  receiving  blinatumomab.  Two 
highest rates of TEAE leading to blinatumomab discontinuation were in Infections and Infestations (3.4%, 
9/267) and Nervous system disorders (3.0%, 8/267). 
SAE leading to discontinuation were reported in 6.4% (7/109) in SOC chemotherapy arm. They were 
reported  in  10.5%  (28/267)  for  blinatumomab  principally  due  to  Infections  and  Infestations  (3.0%, 
8/267) and Nervous system disorders (1.9%, 5/267).

Discussion on clinical safety 
TEAE were collected from the first dose of study treatment until 30 days after the last dose or the safety 
follow-up visit. In this open label study, the causal relationship (ie, related, unrelated) between an AE and 
study treatments was based on investigator’s judgment. 
As  of  the  data  cutoff  date  of  4  January  2016,  108/109  subjects  (99.1%)  in  the  SOC  chemotherapy 
treatment arm and 263/267 subjects (98.5%) in the blinatumomab treatment arm had experienced at 
least 1 TEAE. Patients receiving blinatumomab experienced more SAE (45.0% in SOC arm vs 61.8% in 
blinatumomab arm), events that led to treatment interruption and discontinuation (5.5% and 3.7% in 
SOC arm, vs 32.2% and 12.4% in blinatumomab arm respectively) than in SOC chemotherapy arm. TEAE 
of grade ≥ 3 in severity, life-threatening and fatal AE were similar between treatment arms. Fatal TEAE 
were  reported  for  19  subjects  (17.4%)  in  the  SOC  chemotherapy  arm  and  51  subjects  (19.1%)  in 
blinatumomab arm. 
In  the  SOC  chemotherapy  arm,  the  TEAE  with  the  highest  subject  incidence  were  pyrexia  (45.0%; 
49/109), anemia (42.2%; 46/109), nausea (42.2%; 46/109) and febrile neutropenia (39.4%, 43/109).  
In the blinatumomab arm, the TEAE with the highest subject incidence were pyrexia (59.6%; 159/267), 
headache (28.8%; 77/267), anemia (25.8%; 69/267) and febrile neutropenia (24.0%, 64/267).  
Of  common  all-causality  TEAE,  following  events  were  reported  more  often  (≥5%  difference)  for 
blinatumomab compared to SOC chemotherapy: pyrexia (59.6% vs 45.0%), cough (14.6% vs 5.5%), 
CRS (14.2% vs 0), tremor (9.7% vs 0.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (7.1% vs 0.9%). 
Events  of  special  interest  for  blinatumomab  included  central  neuropsychiatric  events  due  to  direct 
neurotoxicities  (neurologic  events),  CRS,  infections,  elevated  liver  enzymes,  infusion  reactions 
considering  duration,  TLS,  acute  pancreatitis,  embolic  and  thrombotic  events,  medication  errors  and 
product use issues, cytopenias (including febrile neutropenia and neutropenia), lymphopenias, capillary 
leak  syndrome  (CLS),  decreased  immunoglobulins,  and  leukoencephalopathy  (including  progressive 
multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  [PML]).Compared  to  SOC  chemotherapy  arm,  subjects  receiving 
blinatumomab experienced higher incidence of central neuropsychiatric events (49.5% vs 61.0%), CRS 
(0.0% vs 16.1%), infusion reaction (8.3% vs 34.1%), medical errors (0.0% vs 4.5%), TLS (0.9% vs 
3.7%),  decreased  immunoglobulin  (1.8%  vs  9.7%).and  progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy 
(0.0% vs (n=2) 0.7%). Infections, elevated liver enzyme, embolic/thrombotic events and cytopenia were 
more frequent in SOC chemotherapy arm then in blinatumomab. 
All these events are already included in the current SmPC. These EOI are also included in the RMP and 
subjects to additional risk minimization measures in the post-marketing setting, including educational 
materials for physicians, nurses and patients. 
Based on the safety data from Study 00103311, no new ADRs have been identified and the safety and 
tolerability  of  blinatumomab  remains  favorable  in  the  approved  indication.  The  SmPC  section  4.4  has 
been updated to include further information on the neurologic events and section 4.8 has been updated 
with the pooled safety data. 
In  addition  to  investigating  the  long-term  effects  of  HSCT  in  the  target  population  and  to  collect  as 
complete survival data as possible for the Phase 3 study 00103311 (Tower), the CHMP also considered 
that the ongoing studies in first line B-ALL and B-precursor paediatric ALL are of great interest to assess 
the  B/R  of  blinatumomab  and  its  real  place  in  related  to  HSCT  in  the  management  of  childhood  ALL 
(COG-AALL1331)  and  the  direct  benefit  (OS)  of  chemotherapy  combined  with  blinatumomab  among 
MRD-positive subjects following front-line therapy (ECOG-E1910).

Additional expert consultation 
Following the CHMP request, a Scientific Advisory Group meeting was convened on 22 November 2017 to 
provide advice on the following question: 
After treatment with Blincyto, HSCT (which is normally the only potentially curative option) 
appears  as  negatively  impacting  outcomes  (OS  and  RFS).  Please  discuss  the  target 
population  for  Blincyto,  in  particular  if  you  foresee  that  the  target  population  would  be 
limited to patients never eligible to HSCT? If so, would you consider that this population is 
possible to define prospectively, before treatment? 
The SAG experts concluded that for relapsed/refractory disease, the target population corresponds to the 
population  treated  in  the  prospective,  randomized,  phase  3  trial  (TOWER)  including  patients  with 
Ph-negative  B-cell  precursor  ALL  refractory  to  primary  induction  therapy  or  to  salvage  with  intensive 
combination chemotherapy, first relapse with the first remission lasting less than 12 months, second or 
greater relapse, or relapse at any time after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Longer follow-up should 
be requested post-approval to confirm in secondary (exploratory) analyses the long term efficacy and 
assess  if  a  long-term  benefit  can  be  established  or  if  the  effect  on  OS  is  mainly  transient.  It  is 
acknowledged  that  due  to  cross-over,  treatment  switching  and  other  uncontrolled  events  the  effect 
currently observed may be diluted in the long-term, but this can be explored using statistical techniques. 
Conclusion on clinical safety 
Overall, based on the safety data from Study 00103311, no new ADRs have been identified and the safety 
and tolerability of blinatumomab remains favorable in the approved indication. The SmPC section 4.4 has 
been updated to include further information on the neurologic events and section 4.8 has been updated 
with the pooled safety data. 
To further characterize the safety in the subgroup of patients undergoing HSCT after blinatumumab, the 
CHMP  requested  the  MAH  to  evaluate  the  safety  of  patients  post-HSCT  in  registries  as  well  as 
prospectively  in  a  study  comparing  blinatumumab  vs  SOC  chemotherapy  and  in  ongoing  studies  in 
childhood ALL (see RMP).

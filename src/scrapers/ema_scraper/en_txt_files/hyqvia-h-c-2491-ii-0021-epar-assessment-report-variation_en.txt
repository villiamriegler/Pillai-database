2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Baxalta’s combination product immune globulin (IG) infusion 10% with recombinant human 
hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) has been developed to enable the subcutaneous (SC) administration of large 
volumes of IgG, thus addressing the major disadvantage of SC IgG replacement therapy for patients with 
primary immunodeficiency diseases. Immune globulin 10% and rHuPH20 allows administration of IgG SC 
every 3 or 4 weeks as an alternative to intravenous administration or more frequent SC administration in 
patients with PIDD. The function of rHuPH20 in the product combination is to promote the dispersion and 
absorption of IG 10% by temporarily increasing the permeability of the SC tissue. Administration of the 
combination product is a 2-step process that comprises injection of rHuPH20 followed by infusion of IG 
10% into a single SC site through the same needle/infusion set. IG 10 % is marketed as GAMMAGARD 
LIQUID in the US and KIOVIG in Europe. rHuPH20 is a highly purified, neutral pH-active, human 
hyaluronidase produced by genetically engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells containing a 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) plasmid encoding for a soluble fragment of human hyaluronidase (PH20).

rHuPH20 modifies the permeability of the connective tissue through the hydrolysis of hyaluronan and 
temporarily decreases the viscosity of the extracellular matrix and promotes dispersion of injected fluids, 
thus facilitating their absorption.  
At the time of the initial MAA, efficacy in children and adolescents was considered established and the 
available clinical safety data did not reveal any specific concern in any age group. However, CHMP 
expressed a theoretical concern that anti-rHuPH20 antibodies, that were observed in some patients 
treated with HyQvia, could cross-react with endogenous PH20 and potentially effect fertilization, 
pregnancy or neurogenesis/ neuronal repair, thus leading to an exclusion of children from the indication. 
In the present variation application, the MAH presents newly generated clinical data and applies for an 
extension of the indication to the paediatric population.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
Post-approval, Baxter has completed a package of additional nonclinical studies that substantially 
expands the available safety information to address theoretical concerns regarding fertility, pregnancy, 
neurogenesis and neuronal repair. These data were assessed during variation 
EMEA/H/C/002491/II/0013, which received a positive opinion on June 25, 2015 (Update of sections 4.2, 
4.4, 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC in order to update the safety information regarding pregnancy, fertility and 
lactation following new additional preclinical data. Furthermore, the Annex II has been revised to remove 
educational material based on the availability of additional new data).  
These data are summarized below: 
1. Two dedicated Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) rabbit studies designed to evaluate potential effects of 
anti-rHuPH20 antibodies on male and female fertility and embryo-foetal development with a postnatal 
(juvenile) extension were ongoing during the HyQvia review cycle. These studies, now completed, 
demonstrate that anti-rHuPH20 antibodies had no observed adverse effects on male or female fertility, 
pregnancy, or offspring development from conception through adulthood. In addition, there were no 
adverse effects on sexual maturation or mating outcome of offspring persistently exposed to anti 
rHuPH20 antibodies during embryo-foetal and juvenile development (Halozyme Reports 12208 and 
12195). 
2. In vitro expression profiling studies have been expanded to include use of RNASeq technology. 
RNA-Seq is a sensitive, quantitative method that provides a more precise measurement of transcript 
levels than other methods (Wang 2009). RNA-Seq data from human, rabbit, and mouse demonstrate that 
PH20 expression is limited to reproductive tract tissues of the sexually mature male. There was no 
evidence of PH20 expression in foetal tissues and no detectable expression in any neuronal tissues at any 
stage of development. In contrast to the Preston publication, there was no evidence for PH20 expression 
under conditions of damage and repair in the Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG) model of 
Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) by histochemistry or RNA-Seq, despite the presence 
of oligodendrocyte precursor cells in the EAE lesions. 
3. The reported effect of PH20 on oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation was demonstrated 
to be due to a contamination (basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)) of the bovine testicular hyaluronidase 
(BTH) preparation used by Preston (Halozyme Report 13119). There was no effect of rHuPH20 on OPC 
differentiation. Furthermore, the effects of BTH on OPC differentiation were eliminated by inhibition of 
bFGF or depletion of bFGF from the BTH preparation.

4. Genetically engineered gene knockout mice (KO) provide another valuable tool to examine the 
potential impact of loss of function for that gene product. PH20 gene knockout mice were previously 
reported to be normal and fertile (Baba 2002). Further evaluation of PH20 KO mice was conducted to 
determine whether absence of PH20 has any consequence on brain histology, behavior, or neurological 
function. There were no changes in brain histology, myelination, or sensitive assessments of neuronal 
function. There also were no neurobehavioral differences between PH20 knockout mice and wild-type 
litter mates or normal controls, even under conditions of enhanced neurogenesis (Halozyme Report 
13122). The absence of any observed effect in animals with complete loss of PH20 function further 
supports the conclusion that PH20 is not involved in neuronal progenitor cell proliferation or 
differentiation, overall brain development, or neurological function. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH provided a justification for not submitting ERA studies, as due to their nature neither the active 
substance (human immunoglobulin) nor the excipient (rhuPH20, a recombinant protein) are likely to 
result in a significant risk to the environment. In addition, the extension of the indication to the paediatric 
population is not expected to produce a significant increase of use of the product. This is acceptable to the 
CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The clinical investigation of HyQvia included children and adolescents in a sufficient number to fulfil 
guideline requirements, and the agreed PIP for HyQvia in PID (EMEA-000872-PIP01-10-M03, Decision 
number P/0186/2015). All studies included in the agreed PIP are completed and final clinical study 
reports have been submitted with previous applications. 
At the time of initial marketing authorisation evaluation, efficacy in the paediatric patient population was 
confirmed. Clinical safety for the paediatric population in study 160603 was similar to the overall study 
population and there were no unique safety issues associated with the paediatric population. However, 
some areas of uncertainty regarding potential effects of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies cross-reacting with 
endogenous PH20 were raised as concerns at the time. Some of these theoretical concerns have been 
addressed by additional dedicated developmental and reproductive toxicology (DART) studies generated 
post-approval (variation EMEA/H/C/2491/II/0013, positive outcome). 
The results from this study 160902 were submitted in frame of the Paediatric Article 46 Follow-Up 
Measure 008. Summary from this already approved procedure (29 July 2014) is given in the safety 
section below. 
With the present variation, the MAH proposes to extend the current indication of the approved HyQvia 
Product Information (PI) to the paediatric population based on available clinical data in the paediatric 
population covering 3.3 years of exposure with HyQvia. 
The MAH also proposes to perform a phase IV, Post-Authorization Study to collect additional data on the 
safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of HyQvia in paediatric patients (≤18 years). The final protocol 
for this study will be subject to approval.

A total of 24 children ≤18 years of age in the pivotal study 160603 and in the extension study 160902, 
and another 12 in study 161101 which was prematurely ended. This latter group (12) was not included in 
the safety evaluation. At the time of the MAA, the requested interim analysis covered the period from the 
patients’ first exposure to Hyqvia during the ramp-up phase in Epoch 2 of Study 160603 through to the 
interim analysis cut-off date (6 April 2012) in then still ongoing extension Study 160902. The median 
duration was 14.1 and 18.8 patient-years in the 2 to <12 year group and in the 12 to <16 year group, 
respectively. This has since been complemented by more data from Study 160902 so that the overall 
combined exposure of PID patients in both studies is ~ 188 patient-years. As described in the SmPC, the 
longest exposure for adults was 3.8 years and 3.3 years for paediatric patients. 
The following table presents the study participation of patients by age group in the 3 clinical studies.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) data of HyQvia infusion were evaluated during the initial MAA and it was 
concluded that PK parameters were comparable between the different age groups and that satisfactory 
trough levels could be achieved. In addition, it was concluded that PK parameters of SC infusion of IG 
10% after facilitation with rHuPH20 (in trial 160603) are similar to those achieved after IV infusion of IG 
10% (in trial 160601) and thus could support the feasibility of infusing 3- or 4-week doses of IG 10% 
subcutaneously in patients. In the pivotal study 160603, trough levels were compared at the end of Epoch 
1 (= after 3 months of IVIG treatment) with the levels at the end of Epoch 2 (= after ~14 months of SCIG 
treatment with rHuPH20) for 11 subjects aged 2 to < 12 years of age and 70 subjects aged 12 years and 
older (FADS), showing similar values for both treatment modalities. Thus, the basic guideline PK 
requirements were exceeded. Furthermore, for subjects aged 12 or older, bioequivalence with respect to 
AUC0-T for IG 10% administered IV or SC at an adapted dose was shown. 
In addition, for subjects aged 12 years or older, IgG subclass distribution, levels of specific antibodies, 
AUC, Cmax, Tmax, terminal half-life and clearance were determined in both, study 160603 and 160601. The 
totality of data gives a good overview of the PK characteristics of IgG 10% infused after rHuPH20 
facilitation in comparison to IgG 10% infused IV or SC without rHuPH20 (study 160601). The main 
clinically relevant PK parameters like AUC, IgG subclass distribution, levels of specific antibodies are 
comparable between the different treatment modalities.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main studies: 160603 and 160902 
The initial submission for HyQvia was based on the pivotal Phase III study 160603; however, subjects 
enrolled in study 160603 were eligible to enter a long term follow up study (160902) in order to evaluate 
long term safety and efficacy. Sixty six of the 68 subjects who completed study 160603 enrolled in the 
extension study. In the pivotal study 160603, there was no significant difference in infection rates or rates 
of adverse events between those subjects less than or greater than 18 years of age and this continued to 
be the same in the extension study as well as in the overall combined analysis. Eighty three (83) subjects 
were exposed to HyQvia in the pivotal efficacy trial 160603; out of 83 subjects, 24 were younger than 18 
years of age.  
Validated acute serious bacterial infections 
The annual rate of validated acute serious bacterial infections during HyQvia treatment in studies 160603 
and 160902 were 0.025 and 0.020 per patient-year respectively. These were significantly lower than the 
primary endpoint of 1 infection per subject per year (p < 0.0001). Of the 3 validated acute serious 
bacterial infections that occurred in subjects < 18 years of age, 2 were treated as outpatients with oral 
antibiotics and the other one occurred in a patient with Hyper-IgE syndrome. Hyper-IgE patients are 
prone to Staphylococcal pneumonia due to a defect in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 
3 (STAT3) or dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) inflammatory pathways, defects which are in addition to 
the antibody production defect. 
All infections 
An additional analysis of rates of infections in subjects in study 160603, and combined for studies 160603 
and 160902, stratified by age of subjects (18+ years and <18 years) was conducted. The annual rate of 
all infections in study 160603 was similar for subjects less than 18 years of age and those 18 or older; see 
table below. 
The overall rate of infections in the combined 160603/160902 studies was also similar for subjects less 
than 18 years of age and those 18 or older; see table below. 
The CHMP noted that the submitted combined analyses of infection rates from both the pivotal study 
160603 and the extension study 160902 demonstrate that observed rates are comparable to those 
achieved in trials for licensed IG products and that they remain stable over time. The median number of

infusion sites per month was 1.09 for SC administration with rHuPH20, and 1.34 for IV administration. 
Subgroup analyses for all efficacy endpoints of trial 160603 by age and including the ramp-up period were 
provided during the initial MAA evaluation; due to the low number of subjects in some categories and the 
resulting wide confidence intervals, exact interpretation is difficult, however, all available data point in the 
same direction.  
A total of three validated acute serious bacterial infections (VASBIs), all of them pneumonia, occurred 
during the study: 2 in SC-experienced subjects ages 6 and 11 years which occurred after the ramp-up and 
1 in a SC-naïve subject of age 14 which occurred during the ramp-up period. No other subjects had 
VASBIs. The MAH concluded that due to the low number of events and the low number of subjects of ages 
below 16, subgroup analyses of VASBIs by age group or SC-naïve status were not considered to be 
meaningful, which can be agreed by the CHMP. 
2.4.2.  Supportive study 161101 
This was a Phase 2/3, prospective, non-controlled, multi-center study conducted in the US to evaluate 
tolerability and safety and other parameters of subcutaneous treatment using IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 in 
PIDD subjects. The study comprised 3 epochs. In Epoch 1, subjects were treated with IGI, 10% and 
rHuPH20 subcutaneously with a dose/interval ramp-up of 3 weeks at the study site. In Epoch 2, subjects 
received subcutaneous IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 treatment for up to 6 months. The first infusions of Epoch 
2 were administered at the study site; subsequent infusions were preferred to be performed at home (or 
equivalent site), by the trained subject/caregiver, if in the opinion of the investigator such treatment was 
safe and appropriate. The last infusion of Epoch 2 was also performed at the study site, so that the 
investigator could re-assess the proficiency of self-treatment. Following a discussion with the FDA at the 
end of July 2012, all subjects still active in the study stopped rHuPH20 drug product treatment. They went 
into a safety follow-up period (Epoch 3) and were treated with IGI, 10% (Gammagard Liquid) via either 
the intravenous route (IGIV) or the subcutaneous route (IGSC), at the discretion of the investigator and 
the subject. Out of the 54 subjects (9 children) that were screened for the study, 17 patients did not 
commence treatment and 37 started treatment (Safety Analysis Set, SADS). All but one of the subjects 
in the SADS reached Epoch 2 (Epoch 2 Analysis Set, E2DS; N=36). During Epoch 2, 9 subjects withdrew. 
At the time when rHuPH20 was stopped, 1 subject had completed Epoch 2. The remaining 26 were 
switched to Epoch 3. During Epoch 3, 2 subjects withdrew, 24 completed Epoch 3. Thus, 25 subjects 
completed the study (thereof 6 children). On average, 9 children were treated a similar length of time 
compared to the 36 adults. Their exposure to Hyqvia in Epoch 1 + 2 lasted a median of 97 days.   
Assessment report

Primary Efficacy Outcome: Trough levels of total IgG at the end of Epoch 2 (9.21 g/L [95%CI: 
8.28-10.25]) were comparable to the levels measured at screening (median 10.53 g/L [95%CI: 
9.46-11.73]), with a geometric mean ratio of the log-transformed IgG trough level at end of Epoch 2 
versus IgG trough level at screening of 87.9% (95%CI: 79.7-96.8). 
Secondary Efficacy Outcomes:  
- 
- 
- 
No serious bacterial infections were reported in any subject throughout the study. 
The point estimate for the rate of all infections per year was 2.45 (95% CI: 1.55-3.66) for Epoch 1 
and Epoch 2 combined. 
The point estimate for the rate per month of days off either, work, school or daily activity was less 
than 1 day/month. The rate of days on antibiotics was less than 3 days /month. No subjects were 
hospitalized during the study period and the rate of acute physician visit due to infection or other 
illness was less than 1 visit/month. 
- 
Analysis of the mode of infusion was inconclusive due to the premature stop of subject enrollment 
and early termination of Epoch 2, however the following results were observed: 
-  Median number of infusions per month: 2.90 in Epoch1; 1.09 in Epoch2. 
-  Median number of infusion sites (needle sticks) per infusion/month: 2.90 in Epoch 1; 1.12 in 
Epoch 2. 
-  Median duration of infusion less than 2h. 
-  Median maximum infusion rate: 240mL/h in Epoch 1; 300mL/h in Epoch 2. 
-  Median number of weeks to reach final dose interval (3 weeks or 4 weeks): 3 weeks. 
-  No significant differences in the mode of administration characteristics were observed between 
age groups.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
At the time of the initial MAA, the design of the pivotal study 160603 (open-label, non-controlled 
multi-centre study) was considered adequate to fulfil guideline requirements for subcutaneous 
immunoglobulin. The patient population selected, i.e. subjects with PID as defined by WHO criteria, is 
relevant for the intended indication. The study included children and adolescents in sufficient numbers to 
fulfil PIP and relevant guideline requirements. Study centres were located in the US and Canada, but 
subject demographics illustrated that the enrolled subjects can also be regarded as representative for 
European patients with PID. The duration of the study, 3 months on IGIV therapy and 12 months on SC 
IG plus rHuPH20 (following an SC ramp-up phase of approximately 6 weeks) treatment exceeded 
guideline requirements for new SCIG (6 months), but in light of the new facilitation principle, this is 
considered adequate for the evaluation of efficacy. In addition, the extension study 160902 provides data 
on the effects of long-term treatment with HyQvia, and outcomes remained stable over time. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Observed data provide reassurance that IG infused with rhuPH20 facilitation achieves trough levels and 
infection rates comparable to those of other licensed IG products. Furthermore, the median number of 
infusion sites per month was 1.09 for SC administration with rHuPH20, and 1.34 for IV administration. 
During study 160601, subjects who received SC infusions without rHuPH20 had a median of 21.43 sites 
per month. This underlines the main advantage of facilitated SC infusion, namely providing the 
opportunity of infusion intervals comparable to IV administration combined with the possibility for home 
treatment as for conventional SC infusions. 
The CHMP noted that efficacy results of trial 161101 are comparable to those observed for the pivotal trial 
in the initial dossier. However, since study 161101 with HyQvia was discontinued following a discussion 
with the FDA, it only provided supportive data for this application, in the interest of full transparency. No 
paediatric data from this study were included in the submitted paediatric safety/efficacy analysis. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy of HyQvia has already been assessed during the initial marketing authorisation 
application and was found as satisfactory for all age groups. During this type II variation, a reassessment 
of data provided at the time of the MAA in addition to the data provided for this variation reconfirmed this 
conclusion. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
At the time of the marketing authorisation application some of the preclinical data (fertility in guinea pigs, 
but not in other species examined) and theoretical safety considerations on long-term use of 
hyaluronidase and subsequent antibody development led to a cautionary approach that restricted the use 
of Hyqvia to adults. These theoretical concerns were partially addressed by additional dedicated 
developmental and reproductive toxicology (DART) studies generated post-approval (variation 
EMEA/H/C/2491/II/0013 which received a positive opinion on 25 June 2015). In addition, it could be 
shown that the finding of a possible inhibition of the myelination of oligodendrocyte precursor cells in the 
paper by Preston M (Ann Neurol. 2013) was due to contamination with basic fibroblast growth factor 
(bFGF).  
This variation requests the extension of the indication to encompass children based on the previously 
Assessment report

Page 18/35 
 
 
  
assessed study 160902 data, the safety data of study 161101 (although terminated), and safety results 
of study 12222 in the general population. Furthermore the applicant argued that to perform a long-term 
study in children, it would be necessary to have the approved indication, as otherwise recruitment would 
be difficult.  
Study 160603 
Patient exposure 
The initial submission for HyQvia was based on the pivotal Phase III study 160603 (24/83 subjects were 
younger than 18 years of age); however, subjects enrolled in study 160603 were eligible to enter a long 
term follow up study (160902) in order to evaluate long term safety and efficacy. 66 of the 68 subjects 
who completed study 160603 enrolled in the extension study. Safety data from both studies underwent 
the standard analyses and showed rates of adverse event consistent with other studies of 
immunoglobulin products. In the pivotal study 160603 there was no significant difference in infection 
rates or rates of adverse events between those subjects less than or greater than 18 years of age and that 
continued to be true in the extension study as well as in the overall combined analysis. 
Exposure for all patients in the combined studies was 187.69 patient-years and 48.66 patient-years for 
paediatric subjects <18 years of age. The longest exposure was approximately 3.8 years (198 weeks) for 
all subjects and 3.3 years (174 weeks) for the paediatric population. 
Fifteen (15) subjects withdrew or were discontinued from study 160603; 5 of them were <18 years of 
age. Of the 6 subjects who withdrew due to HyQvia-related adverse events, 2 subjects were <18 years of 
age. Three (3) subjects <18 years old withdrew due to geographic factors (N=2) and fear of needle sticks 
(N=1). 
Adverse events  
Systemic Adverse Events 
The rates of adverse events were analysed for the entire period of exposure to HyQvia in both studies 
combined; see table below. Rates of overall and related systemic adverse events were 8.03 and 1.75 per 
subject year respectively. 
An additional analysis of rates of systemic adverse reactions in studies 160603 and 160902 combined, 
stratified by age of subjects (18+ years and <18 years) was conducted. The rate of all systemic as well 
as causally related systemic adverse reactions was lower for the subjects less than 18 years of age; see 
table below. There were no severe or serious adverse reactions in the patients less than 18 years of age. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/37582/2016 
Page 19/35 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Local adverse events 
The overall rate per subject-year of local AEs while on HyQvia treatment in studies 160603/160902 is 
depicted below. None of these AEs were considered serious. 
An additional analysis of rates of local adverse events in studies 160603 and 160902 combined, stratified 
by age of subjects (18+ years and <18 years) was conducted. The rate of all local adverse events per 
patient year for the patients less than 18 years of age, as well as the causally related events, was less 
than half that of the patients 18 years and older, as stated in the table. 
Over 97% of HyQvia infusions (excluding ramp-up) were completed without the need to slow, interrupt, 
or discontinue the infusion due to an adverse event, demonstrating that HyQvia was well tolerated. There 
was no difference between the two age groups. 
The CHMP was of the opinion that the combined analyses of safety data from both the pivotal study 
160603 and the extension study 160902 demonstrate that for rates of both systemic and local adverse 
events are comparable for paediatric and adult subjects. A trend towards a lower incidence of AEs in the 
paediatric age group can be observed, but due to the low subject numbers this is difficult to interpret.

Study 160902  
The results from this study were submitted in frame of the Paediatric Article 46 Follow-Up Measure 008.  
Summary adapted wording from previously approved procedure (29 July 2014): 
Data from the predecessor Study 160603 covered safety parameters for approximately the first 1.5 years 
of IG 10% with rHuPH20 SC treatment. Data from the extension Study 160902 show these parameters 
for the ensuing period of approximately 1.5 to 2 years. Eleven children were followed approx. 686 days.  
Exposure: 
Safety evaluation encompassed SAEs, infusions requiring adjustment, severity of AEs, antibodies to 
rHuPH20, rates of AEs by subject, by infusion, by relationship, by temporal association. Dosing of the Ig 
10% was every 2, 3, or 4 weeks SC preceded by rHuPH20 at 75U/gram Ig. The safety follow-up was either 
after SC or IV administration. 62.1%of patients (41/66) applied a 4 week-infusion interval, 15/66 
(22.7%) subjects, a 2 week-infusion interval and 7/66 (10.6%) a 3-week infusion interval. Across all age 
groups and infusion intervals, a median number of 1.09 infusions/month (range: 0.3-2.1) was 
administered.  
Throughout the study and across all age groups, 1651 AEs were reported, of which 1188 AEs were mild 
in severity, 438 were moderate and 25 were severe. Out of the 1651 total AEs, 1244 AEs occurred under 
IGSC, 10% with rHuPH20 treatment, and 407 during the Safety Follow-up. Throughout the study across 
all age groups, 18 SAEs were reported for a total of 2198 infusions (rate per infusion: 0.0082). All SAEs 
were deemed unrelated to IP by the investigator; none occurred in subjects aged 2 to <12 years. 
During SCIG 10% and rHuPH20 treatment, the rates of all related AEs and of total (related and unrelated) 
AEs (excluding infections) per subject per year were 4.35 and 10.68, respectively.  
The median rates of temporally associated AEs per infusion were comparable for both, the predecessor 
study 160603 and 160902 as well as the Safety Follow-up study, namely 0.21 (95% CI: 0.13; 0.31) and 
0.28/0.25, respectively. A numerical discrepancy became evident between the rates of AEs concerning 
the different age groups; collected data show more adverse events in elderly subjects. Amongst other 
factors, this might be caused by special physical conditions of elderly individuals, especially related to 
their medical history.  No increase in the rate of local AEs was observed after long-term 
rHuPH20-facilitated IGSC, 10% treatment.  
The rate of all adverse reactions by subject was also stable or decreased over time (3.317 during 
rHuPH20-fascilitated IGSC, 10% treatment vs. 2.588 during the Safety Follow-up period). In particular, 
the rates of local adverse reactions by infusion declined (from 8.8% to 3.7%), as is commonly seen with 
conventional subcutaneous therapy. During rHuPH20-facilitated IGSC, 10% treatment, the rate of all AEs 
related to rHuPH20, by subject, was 0.365 and the rate of all AEs related to both IGI, 10% and rHuPH20 
by subject, was 1.444. Analysis of immunogenicity with respect to neutralizing antibodies against 
rHuPH20 did not raise any safety concerns with respect to SC administration of HyQvia. 13/66 patients 
(19.6%) had antibodies, however, no subject developed neutralizing antibodies against rHUPH20 during 
Assessment report

Study 160603 and Study 160902 and anti-rHuPH20 antibody titers declined during IGSC, 10% with 
rHuPH20 treatment and during the Safety Follow-up period. 
The results indicate that HyQvia is an effective treatment for adult and paediatric patients. No new safety 
signals were detected, the majority of AEs was mild, manageable and patients recovered after 
administration of a supportive therapy. One subject experienced a severe anaphylactic reaction during 
the Safety Follow-up period which was considered treatment-related to IGI, 10% and hence, was 
discontinued. Even if true hypersensitivity reactions are rare, this type of Adverse Drug Reaction is a 
potential complication with administration of human normal immunoglobulins. There were no relevant 
differences concerning the types of AE between adult and paediatric patients, the rate of total AEs tended 
to be lower in children than in adults. However, the younger patient population (2 y-16y =11 subjects) 
constitutes a fifth of the patient population aged 16->65 years (55 subjects), so a comparison of these 
rates is of limited validity.

Scores for treatment preference showed that 21 subjects liked the ability to self-administer, 14 subjects

Conclusion on study 160902  
Overall, extension study 160902 as well as the safety follow-up study (total duration 3 – 3.5 years) 
showed results that are consistent with the collected data of the predecessor study 160603. They 
confirmed an acceptable safety and efficacy profile with HyQvia when administered as 2-, 3- or 4-weekly 
scheme in patients with PID. Concerning efficacy results, a 4-weekly treatment schedule is reasonable 
with regard to sufficient IgG (trough) levels and an adequate clinical benefit as defined by protection 
against bacterial infections is provided. 
Study 161101 (undertaken in the US, terminated early after discussion with the FDA) 
Primary Safety Outcome: 
During Epoch 1 and Epoch 2 combined, 59 related systemic AEs occurred. The rate of related systemic 
AEs/infusion, excluding infections (primary outcome) was 0.326 (95%CI: 0.186-0.522) and the rate per 
number of subjects was 37.8% (14/37), for Epochs 1 and 2 combined. 
Secondary Safety Outcomes: 
Tolerability and Safety:  
- 
Proportion of subjects who achieve a treatment interval of 3 or 4 weeks in Epoch 2.  
In the Epoch 2, 6/36 subjects achieved a treatment interval of 3 weeks and the remaining 30 
Assessment report

subjects achieved a treatment interval of 4 weeks. 
- 
Proportion of subjects who maintain a treatment interval of 3 or 4 weeks in Epoch 2 for 24 weeks. 
Out of the 36 subjects that reached Epoch 2, 9 withdrew in Epoch 2 and, hence, did not maintain a 
3-4 week treatment interval and 1 subject completed Epoch 2 maintaining the 3-4 week treatment 
interval. The remaining 26 subjects were switched to Epoch 3 before the end of Epoch 2 according to 
protocol amendment 2. 
- 
Number and rate per infusion (excluding infections) of related local AEs. 
A total of 153 related local AEs occurred during Epoch 1 and Epoch 2 combined, in 27 out of 37 (73.0 
%) subjects. In the E2DS the point estimate of the rate of related local AEs per infusion was 0.84 
(95%CI: 0.582-1.164) in Epoch 1 and Epoch 2 combined.  
- 
Number and rate per infusion (excluding infections) of all AEs. 
A total of 212 related AEs occurred during Epoch 1 and Epoch 2 combined, in 28 out of 37 (75.7%) 
subjects. When considering all related AEs other than infections, in the E2DS the point estimate of 
the rate of all related AEs per infusion was 1.646 (95%CI:1.232- 2.145) in Epoch 1 and Epoch 2 
combined.. 
- 
Number of subjects who develop neutralizing antibodies to rHuPH20 
None of the 37 treated subjects develop neutralizing antibodies to rHuPH20 in the course of the 
study. In addition, no subject developed a positive antibody titer capable of binding to rHuPH20, 
which was defined as a titer ≥160. Titers < 1:160 were considered to be either background 
fluctuation in the assay or consistent with passive transfer of antibody from the IGI, 10%, which has 
been shown to contain such binding antibodies.  
25 participants filled in the SF-36 questionnaire after the study (20 were > 14 years of age and 5 were 
parents of children < 13 years of age) in order to express their treatment preference.  
The table below presents the numbers of adverse events (AEs) and related adverse events (ADRs), 
including infections, for all subjects of all ages who participated in study 161101. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study 161101 
One SAE occurred in Epoch 3 of the study concerning hypoglycemia in a 53 year old white female PID 
patient 6 days after the infusion of Gammagard Liquid (no rHuPH20). The narrative was provided. The 
SAE had resolved at the time of study completion. 
Laboratory findings 
Study 161101 
Haemolysis: Out of 28 subjects, 4 (14.3%) experienced a potential haemolysis, as assessed by a decline 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/37582/2016 
Page 23/35 
 
 
  
 
 
 
in haemoglobin of more than 2.0 g/dL (Subjects). Further analysis showed a positive urine hemosiderin 
for subject  during the ramp-up period and for subject  during the full infusion as well as free haemoglobin 
concentration >600mg/L for Subject  during the ramp-up period. This was considered to be an artefact 
since none of the other parameters of haemolysis were positive. At no time was there a concordance of 
positive tests confirming a diagnosis of haemolysis. None of the incidences of fall in haemoglobin were 
confirmed to be due to a haemolytic reaction; however, a firm conclusion cannot be made based on this 
study.  
Haematology parameters: In the SADS (N=37), 17 clinically significant abnormal results at the 
assessment of the last value in Epoch 2 were reported in subjects who had a normal baseline result for 
that parameter: 1 shift in haematocrit; 1 shift in leukocyte counts; 2 shifts in neutrophil counts; 6 shifts 
in eosinophil counts, 5 shifts in monocyte counts, and 2 shifts in platelet counts. There were no clinically 
significant shifts from normal to abnormal results for the remaining haematology parameters assessed: 
haemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte, basophil and lymphocyte counts.  
Clinical chemistry parameters: Twenty four clinically significant changes from normal to abnormal values 
were reported at the assessment of the last value in Epoch 2 for the following serum clinical chemistry 
parameters: 1 shift in albumin; 1 shift in aldolase; 2 shifts in ALT; 3 shifts in AST; 5 shifts in bicarbonate; 
1 shift in BUN; 1shift in creatinine; 3 shifts in CPK; 3 shifts in glucose; 1 shift in LDH; 2 shifts in potassium 
and 1 shift in protein concentrations. No clinically significant shifts from normal to abnormal results were 
documented for the remaining clinical chemistry parameters assessed: alkaline phosphatase, amylase, 
serum bilirubin, chloride and sodium concentrations. 
Urinalysis: At the assessment of the last value in Epoch 2, 3 clinically significant changes from normal to 
abnormal values were reported: 1 shift in urine protein; 1 shift in urine blood; 1 shift to abnormal specific 
gravity. There were no clinically significant changes from baseline to the assessment of last value in 
Epoch 2 for the remaining parameters: urine glucose, bilirubin, urobilinogen and pH. 
Preference of administration route: 25 participants filled in the SF-36 questionnaire after the study (20 
were > 14 years of age and 5 were parents of children < 13 years of age). For the “overall treatment 
preference” Hyqvia was preferred in 13 cases and 12 stated that they had no preference or preferred the 
former treatment (be it SCIG or IVIG). All 5 parents preferred Hyqvia; this may have to be viewed with 
caution, as parents will want to spare their children (and themselves) the needle sticks. The results are in 
keeping with those of study 160902, where approximately half of the patients preferred Hyqvia.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Of the 9 discontinuation is study 161101 that occurred in Epoch 2, 3 were caused by related AEs on IGI. 
Study 12222 (anti-rHuPH20 antibodies in normal population) 
Study 12222 was a blood sample collection study in volunteers and was designed to determine the 
prevalence of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies in a normal population that was geographically, ethnically, 
and age diverse. Furthermore, this study was intended to explore potential factors predisposing for 
development of such antibodies, and possible consequences to fertility and offspring. An interim analysis 
of 692 patients has been previously submitted (data cut-off Apr 2014). Meanwhile, the study was 
finalised and the final Report 12222 is provided with this submission. Approximately 5% of the general 
adult population tested positive for anti-rHuPH20 antibodies. Separate clinical protocols were established 
for the adult and paediatric portion of this study. The adult protocol (SeraTrials 12007) had a target 
enrolment of at least 800 male and female volunteers, whereas the paediatric protocol (SeraTrials 12010) 
had a target enrolment of at least 200 subjects 12 to 17 years of age. However, due to difficulties in

recruiting certain demographic/age groups, such as children and subjects of advanced age, enrolment 
was terminated and the analysis limited to the samples obtained for the study period August 2012 
through December 2014. Accordingly, the presence or absence of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies, and their 
titers if present, was determined in plasma from samples obtained from 767 normal adult subjects, 381 
men and 386 women, along with 129 subjects age 12-17, 70 boys and 59 girls.  
Forty adults and two subjects age 12-17 (both males) were confirmed positive for rHuPH20-reactive 
antibodies, yielding adult and paediatric positivity rates of 5.2% and 1.6%, respectively. The age 
distributions of subjects from pooled adult and paediatric populations that were positive and negative for 
rHuPH20-reactive antibodies were significantly different (Wilcoxon’s rank-sum p = 0.0006) indicating 
that antibody positivity increased with age. In pooled adult and paediatric subjects, antibody positivity 
was significantly more prevalent in male versus female subjects (Fisher’s exact p = 0.0007), see table 
below. This was also true if only the adult population was considered (odds ratio 3.21 with range 1.55 – 
6.67, Fisher’s exact p = 0.0010). In adults the prevalence across groups of different race/ethnicity was 
not significantly different (likelihood chi-square p = 0.24). The rHuPH20-reactive antibody titers ranged 
from 5 to 2560. Some form of autoimmune or inflammatory disease was identified in 25 subjects. There 
was no significant overall association between the presence of antibodies and autoimmune/inflammatory 
disease.

Associations between fertility/pregnancy outcomes and rHuPH20-reactive antibody positivity (in all adult 
subjects  
Of the 381 participating men, two subjects reported ever visiting a specialist in infertility, and one of those 
two subjects reported being diagnosed with infertility; however, neither was positive for 
rHuPH20-reactive antibodies. Of the 123 male subjects that reported having fathered children, 17 tested 
positive for rHuPH20- reactive antibodies. This constituted a higher ratio than that observed in male 
subjects who did not father children (Fisher’s exact p = 0.0036). Thirty-four men reported having 
undergone vasectomy; of these subjects, 5 tested positive for rHuPH20-reactive antibodies, whereas 25 
of 347 non-vasectomized men tested positive (Fisher’s exact p = 0.17). None of the 30 antibody-positive 
adult male subjects reported having had testicular surgery, injury/trauma, inflammation, or testicular 
mumps; nor any episodes of recurring urinary tract infections. Of the 386 participating women, two 
subjects had visited an infertility specialist, and four reported being diagnosed with infertility (including 
the two that had visited an infertility specialist); however, all were negative for rHuPH20-reactive 
antibodies. Eight female subjects testing positive for rHuPH20-reactive antibodies had borne at least one 
child, and none of them reported having any miscarriages. The rate of childbearing was not statistically 
different between antibody-positive and antibody-negative women. One antibody-positive subject and 
three antibody-negative subjects reported a premature birth (prior to 37 weeks of gestation), and these 
rates were not significantly different from each other (Fisher’s exact p = 0.14). None of the ten female 
antibody-positive subjects reported experiencing recurring urinary tract infections or other infections or 
inflammatory disease of the pelvic area. 
Prevalence of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies 
An analysis of the prevalence of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies in various subgroups of the general 
population was conducted. Antibody-positive individuals were on the average significantly older than 
antibody-negative subjects (p = 0.0006), although there was considerable overlap in age between the 
two populations. Of note, male subjects had approximately 3-fold higher rates of rHuPH20 antibody 
positivity than female subjects, a finding which was statistically significant (p = 0.0007). However, no 
evidence for a negative effect on fertility in rHuPH20-reactive antibody-positive subjects could be 
discerned in either gender. Finally, no association was observed between rHuPH20-reactive antibody 
positivity and autoimmune/inflammatory conditions.  
The CHMP discussed the results in adults and adolescents that had the objective to determine the 
prevalence of anti-PH20 antibodies in healthy male and female subjects. 42 out of 896 subjects tested as 
antibody positive (40/767 adults and 2/129 adolescents), at relatively low titers. Further analyses could 
establish no association with autoimmune disorders or fertility problems in those subjects. The data from 
these two trials underline the fact that anti-PH20 antibodies are present in a proportion of healthy 
subjects (about 4.6% in these trials) without any discernible clinical significance. Consequently, it can be 
concluded that anti-PH20 antibodies are present in plasma donations and therefore possibly in other 
human normal immunoglobulin preparations. Nevertheless, the CHMP requested a clarification whether 
the antibody positivity (which increased with age) could have occurred after the adults had already

reproduced. Based on MAH’s response, it was acknowledge that the study design was not intended to 
clarify any causal relationship between anti-rHuPH20 antibodies and impaired fertility and the CHNP 
concurs that study 12222 contributes to the comprehensive evaluation of anti-PH20 antibodies. 
Fifteen (15) of the 83 subjects exposed to HyQvia during Studies 160603 and 160902 developed at least 
a single positive titer (160) of antibodies capable of binding to rHuPH20. Three (3) of the 15 subjects were 
<18 years old. In one subject <18 years old, the titer ranged from negative to 160 (single positive titer) 
and declined to 10 at the end of the study. In the second subject <18 years old, the titer ranged from 
negative to 1280 (highest titer) and declined to 40 at the end of the study. In the third subject <18 years 
old, the titer ranged from negative to 10240 (highest titer) and declined to 320 at the end of the study. 
For all three subjects, titers declined to baseline or to titer levels observed in PH20-naïve subjects despite 
continued exposure to HyQvia. 
Post-marketing experience  
The latest PSUR was assessed in PSUSA EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001633/201505, which covered the period 
from 01 June 2014 – 31 May 2015. The procedure finalised on 14th January 2016 with the outcome of 
maintenance of the MA. 
Since granting of the marketing authorisation in 2013, cumulatively 496.278 g have been sold. Two (2) 
additional post-marketing adverse reactions have been identified: Hypersensitivity and Influenza like 
illness and are added to the PI.  
Long-term follow-up: Two non-interventional long-term follow-up safety studies (161301 and 161302) 
with HyQvia were ongoing during the reporting interval. 
Study 161301 (Global Baxalta Pregnancy Registry). Current status: No subject was enrolled during the 
reporting period. Preparation for Registry implementation is ongoing (ethic committee approvals, site 
initiation, and notification letters to physicians) 
Study 161302 (Baxalta HyQvia PASS EU). Current status: As of 31 May 2015, 10 sites open in total, (4 in 
Germany, 4 in the Netherlands and 2 in Denmark) and and a total of 30 subjects were enrolled in the 
study. First Irish Ethic Committee approval took place on 17DEC2014. New countries are planned to be 
on-board (Italy and United Kingdom). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Study 160902 (P46 procedure) and its safety follow-up study (total duration 3 - 3.5 years) encompassing 
66 PID patients (thereof 11 children) showed results that were consistent with the collected data of the 
predecessor study 160603. They confirmed an acceptable safety and efficacy profile with HyQvia when 
administered as 2-, 3- or 4-weekly scheme in patients with PID. There were no relevant differences 
concerning the types of AEs between adult and paediatric patients, the rate of total AEs tended to be 
lower in children than in adults. Nevertheless, at the end of the procedure, the conclusion was that 
although the data did not show any grave concerns for children (compared to adults), it did not alter the 
regulatory approach of the use of this product in children, as the number of paediatric patients (11) was 
not sufficient to draw any clear conclusions and could provide sufficient reassurance as to any possible 
long term effects of the product. Therefore, the caution of excluding children from the indication in the 
SmPC was upheld along with the statements concerning pregnancy. However, the conclusion regarding 
the warning statements concerning pregnancy is superseded by the outcome of variation II/13, where 
these warning statements were removed from the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/37582/2016 
Page 27/35 
 
 
  
 
 
In general, the data from study 161101 encompassing 37 PID patients (thereof 9 children) do not show 
any untoward concerns regarding SAEs and neutralizing antibody development (there were no related 
SAEs and no subject developed neutralizing anti-rHuPH20 antibodies). Related local reactions were seen 
in 73% of the patients, which is not unusual for an SCIG application (e.g. for a SCIG EU study within a 
MAA local reactions were seen in 49%, yet in an equivalent US study local reactions were seen in all 
patients (100%)).  
The rate of subjects with systemic related AEs seemed to be rather high (38%) and more in tune with that 
of IVIGs thereby reducing the beneficial effect normally associated with SCIGs. Furthermore, in Epoch 3 
(i.e. SC w/o rHuPH20 or IVIG) the rate of patients with systemic ADRs was 15.4%.  
Moreover, the study is considered only supportive as the assessment is limited due to:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The study protocol was amended due to the aforesaid theoretical considerations of long-term 
effects on fertility. Therefore the actual 6 month data with Hyqvia was reduced to approx. 2.5 
months and 26/36 patients were switched to a treatment without rHuPH20.  
The number of children is very small (9) and no separate evaluation was performed. 
The number of protocol violations is exceedingly large for such a short trial. In particular this 
affects the evaluation of haemolysis. 
There is an overlap of treatment effects from the previous treatment; 15 patients (41%) received 
IVIG on a 3-4 weekly basis, (the remainder received SCIG on a weekly basis). Given the half-life 
of IVIGs at ~ 18-30 days and a virtual wash-out of 5-6 half-lives (min: ~90 days), then a 
considerable amount of the data in Epoch 1 + 2 cannot be properly evaluated. 
The study was early terminated on request of the FDA.  
Study 12222 was conducted in rHuPH20 exposure naïve subjects to determine the prevalence of 
anti-rHuPH20 antibodies in normal population. Samples were obtained from 767 normal adult subjects, 
381 men and 386 women, along with 129 subjects age 12-17, 70 boys and 59 girls. The analysis showed 
that males had ~3-fold higher rates of rHuPH20 antibody positivity than females and there were higher 
rates in adults compared to children (5.2% and 1.6%, respectively). There was no evidence for a direct 
negative effect on fertility in rHuPH20-reactive antibody-positive subjects (in either gender) and no direct 
association was observed between rHuPH20-reactive antibody positivity and autoimmune/inflammatory 
conditions.  
The Product Information of HyQvia has been adequately updated with the safety information from the 
conducted trials. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
All available safety data of HyQvia in healthy volunteers as well as primary immunodeficiency patients 
show an acceptable safety profile across all investigated age groups. However, due to theoretical 
concerns for potential effects of anti-rhuPH20 antibodies (at least transient titres developed in 15/83 
subjects in the pivotal study 160603) on fertility, pregnancy and neuronal regeneration, paediatric 
patients were excluded from the indication at the initial evaluation for marketing authorisation. 
For this variation procedure clinical trials previously or partially assessed (Study 160902 and Study 
12222) and some new clinical data (Study 161101) were submitted – overall these data did not contribute 
significantly to further elucidation of the theoretical concern of long-term effects in children. The MAH also 
addressed the remaining concerns through additional non-clinical and serological studies, which were 
evaluated in previous variation procedure. Furthermore, the MAH also proposed to conduct an additional 
post authorisation safety study in paediatric subjects. In particular, the MAH proposed a post 
authorisation, prospective, non-controlled, multicentre study to evaluate safety, tolerability and other

prior immunoglobulin therapy.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The next data lock point will be 31 May 2016.  
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 8.0 is acceptable. Minor revisions were 
recommended to be taken into account with the next RMP update relating to the categorisation of the 
study Proposed Post-authorization Study on Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity Evaluation of 
HyQvia in Paediatric Subjects with PID in section III of the RMP. The PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The benefits of immunoglobulin replacement therapy with HyQvia in the paediatric population are the 
same as those for the adult population, namely the prevention of serious bacterial infections, a reduced 
incidence of infections, less use of antibiotics, less days absent from work/school. The efficacy of HyQvia 
with regard to these clinically relevant outcomes has already been established at the initial evaluation for 
marketing authorisation in a population including children, adolescents and adult PID patients.  
One of the main advantages of the facilitated SC infusion is the increased infusion interval and the 
reduced need for needle sticks compared to conventional SC infusion. The median number of infusion 
sites per month was 1.09 for SC administration with rHuPH20 and 1.34 for IV administration, in contrast 
to a median of 21.43 sites per month for subjects who received SC infusions without rHuPH20. 
The posology in children and adolescents (0-18 years) is not different to that of adults as the posology for 
each indication is given by body weight and adjusted to the clinical outcome.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There is no real uncertainty as to the benefit of IgG replacement in PID patients. As to the benefit of SCIG 
+ rHuPH20, it seems to be preferred by approximately half of the patients who completed preference 
questionnaires in study 161101). The results are in keeping with those of Study 160902, where 
approximately half of the patients preferred Hyqvia and this is reassuring.  The uncertainty is this regard 
is particularly large with children as their caregivers could be more in favour of SCIG + rHuPH20 than 
adult PID patients would be. This may be addressed in the planned PASS, as stated in the agreed RMP. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
As would be expected from the SC administration of an IgG product, the main adverse events with HyQvia 
are local infusion site reactions with mainly mild to moderate swelling, pain, pruritus and discoloration. 
Systemic adverse events are similar in type to the common ones seen with IVIG treatment. Interestingly, 
the rate of patients with systemic ADRs is reminiscent of rates seen with some IVIGs. This would partially 
counterbalance the habitually lower systemic ADRs seen with normal SCIGs. Safety data at the time of 
the initial marketing authorisation revealed an expected increase of local adverse events and a reduction 
of systemic adverse events in comparison to IV administration of human normal immunoglobulin. The 
observed safety profile was comparable to other licensed immunoglobulin products and did not reveal any 
specific safety signals in any age group.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The uncertainty regarding the possible impact of anti-PH20 antibodies on fertility have been addressed by 
preclinical data in several different animal species, submitted as part of a previous variation and the PI 
was amended accordingly. The majority of these studies did not indicate a safety signal. The human study 
in the general population seems to confirm this. Nevertheless, complete satisfaction as to any potential 
risk of anti-PH20 antibodies especially in children/adolescents on their future fertility cannot be fully 
answered. The post-authorisation safety study concerning tolerability and immunogenicity evaluation of 
HyQvia in 
Paediatric Subjects with PID, as suggested by the MAH, can only look at a limited window in the 
development of the children.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The similar safety profile of the paediatric and adult patients is considered important in order to extend 
the indication of HyQvia to children. However, long-term safety follow up will be conducted by the MAH in 
the post authorisation safety study.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The MAH addressed some of these theoretical concerns with additional dedicated developmental and 
reproductive toxicology (DART) studies generated post-approval. The variation EA/H/C/2491/II/0013 
which received positive opinion on 25 June 2015 led to the editing of the wording in the HyQvia SmPC 
concerning fertility, pregnancy and breast-feeding and the Annex II has been revised to remove 
educational material. 
However, 15 of 83 patients exposed to HyQvia developed at least transient titres of anti-rhuPH20 
antibodies. Theoretical concerns regarding the potential effects of such antibodies cross-reacting with 
endogenous PH20 on fertility, pregnancy and neurogenesis led to the exclusion of children from the 
indication, as paediatric patients cannot provide informed consent to a treatment after weighing its 
benefits and risks. 
In addition to these already assessed data, the final study reports from SeraTrials 12007 (adult protocol) 
and SeraTrials 12010 (adolescent protocol) of the 12222 trial were submitted and evaluated. These trials 
established a prevalence of anti-PH20 antibodies in about 5% of healthy subjects, with no correlation to 
autoimmune diseases or fertility problems. These data look reassuring. A comparison of subgroup 
analyses of efficacy and safety data from clinical trials 160603 and 160902 in PID patients demonstrated 
comparable outcomes in the adult and paediatric population.  
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The beneficial effects of an IG substitution with HyQvia, allowing infusion intervals and numbers of needle 
sticks comparable to the IV administration of immunoglobulin as well as self-administration or 
administration by parents or care-givers for younger patients, are acknowledged. The amount of 
pre-clinical and clinical data to date seems reassuring with regard to the risks of rhuPH20 antibodies. The 
future data from the proposed study paediatric PID Phase IV study 161504 may provide more (long-term) 
clarity in this issue and it is therefore considered acceptable to initiate this trial. 
4.  Recommendations

Extension of indication to include paediatric population for all authorised indications: as a consequence, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0186/2015 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of indication to include paediatric population for all authorised indications: as a consequence, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance.

The single arm, open-label study PONENTE (Trial 6), 
efficacy information based on the final results from 
study D3250C00065 (PONENTE); this is a 
multicenter, open-label, Phase IIIb efficacy and 
safety study of benralizumab 30 mg administered 
subcutaneously to reduce oral corticosteroid use in 
adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma on 
evaluated the efficacy of benralizumab for maintaining 
asthma control during rapid oral corticosteroid (OCS) 
tapering in adult patients with severe asthma (blood 
eosinophil count ≥150 cells/μL at entry or ≥300 cells/μL in 
the past 12 months if study entry count was <150 cells/μL) 
who were OCS-dependent.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
The proportion of patients who eliminated OCS while 
maintaining asthma control was 62.9%. The proportion of 
patients who achieved a final OCS dose less or equal to 5 
mg while maintaining asthma control and not limited by 
adrenal function was 81.9%. Effects on OCS reduction were 
similar irrespective of blood eosinophil count at study entry 
and maintained over an additional period of 24 to 32 
weeks. The annualized exacerbation rate in Trial 6 was 
comparable to that reported in previous trials.

SmPC, Annex 
The open-label safety extension study MELTEMI 
on the maintenance of long-term safety based on the 
II and PL 
(D3250C00037, Trial 5) aimed to evaluate the long-term 
results from study D3250C00037 (MELTEMI) listed as 
a category 3 study in the RMP. This is a multicenter, 
open-label safety extension study to evaluate the 
safety and tolerability of a fixed 30 mg dose of 
benralizumab in adults with severe asthma. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the 
list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet 
and to bring the Product information in line with the 
latest QRD template version 10.2. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
safety and efficacy of a fixed-dose of benralizumab 
administered subcutaneously to severe asthma adult 
patients on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/long-acting β-
agonists (LABA) therapy with or without chronic oral 
corticosteroids and/or other asthma controllers. The 
annualised asthma exacerbation rate in patients receiving 
30 mg benralizumab every 8 weeks spanning a median 
total follow-up of 3.4 years was comparable (0.47) to that 
reported in predecessor Trials (0.48 and 0.65).

Managmenet Plan (RMP) following the finalisation of a 
category 3 long-term safety and tolerability extension study 
(D3250C00021, BORA) and an open label safety extension 
study (MELTEMI). Benralizumab was well tolerated with no 
unexpected safety findings over the on-treatment and post-
treatment periods. As a consequence, the long-term use of 
Page 5/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
benralizumab, serious hypersensibibility, loss/reduction of 
long-term efficacy due to persistent neutralizing anti-drug 
antibodies were no longer included in the RMP as safety 
concerns. Furthermore, the categorisation of helminth 
infection was changed from important identified risk to 
important potential risk.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
INTELENCE, in combination with a boosted protease inhibitor and other antiretroviral medicinal 
products, is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in 
antiretroviral treatment-experienced adult patients and in antiretroviral treatment-experienced 
paediatric patients from 2 years of age (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1).
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.
Posology
INTELENCE must always be given in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products.
Adults
The recommended dose of etravirine for adults is 200 mg (one 200 mg tablet or two 100 mg tablets) 
taken orally twice daily following a meal (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population (2 years to less than 18 years of age)
The recommended dose of etravirine for paediatric patients (2 years to less than 18 years of age and 
weighing at least 10 kg) is based on body weight (see table below). INTELENCE tablet(s) should be 
taken orally, following a meal (see section 5.2).

one 100 mg tablet and two 25 mg tablets twice daily
eight 25 mg tablets twice daily or
two 100 mg tablets twice daily
or one 200 mg tablet twice daily
If the patient misses a dose of INTELENCE within 6 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient 
should take it following a meal as soon as possible and then take the next dose at the regularly 
scheduled time. If a patient misses a dose by more than 6 hours of the time it is usually taken, the 
patient should not take the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule.
If a patient vomits within 4 hours of taking the medicine, another dose of INTELENCE should be 
taken following a meal as soon as possible. If a patient vomits more than 4 hours after taking the 
medicine, the patient does not need to take another dose until the next regularly scheduled time.
Elderly
There is limited information regarding the use of INTELENCE in patients > 65 years of age (see 
section 5.2), therefore caution should be used in this population.
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is suggested in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
Class A or B); INTELENCE should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic 
3
impairment. The pharmacokinetics of etravirine have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Therefore, INTELENCE is not recommended in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population (less than 2 years of age)
INTELENCE should not be used in children less than 2 years of age. Currently available data for 
children between 1 and 2 years old are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 and suggest that the 
benefits do not outweigh the risks in this age group. No data are available for children less than 1 year 
of age.
Method of administration
Oral use.
Patients should be instructed to swallow the tablet(s) whole with a liquid such as water. Patients who 
are unable to swallow the tablet(s) whole may disperse the tablet(s) in a glass of water (see 
section 4.4).
For instructions on dispersion of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Co-administration with elbasvir/grazoprevir (see section 4.5).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
INTELENCE should optimally be combined with other antiretrovirals that exhibit activity against the 
patient’s virus (see section 5.1).
A decreased virologic response to etravirine was observed in patients with viral strains harbouring 3 or 
more among the following mutations V90I, A98G, L100I, K101E/P, V106I, V179D/F, Y181C/I/V, 
and G190A/S (see section 5.1).
Conclusions regarding the relevance of particular mutations or mutational patterns are subject to 
change with additional data, and it is recommended to always consult current interpretation systems 
for analysing resistance test results.
No data other than drug-drug interaction data (see section 4.5) are available when etravirine is 
combined with raltegravir or maraviroc.
Severe cutaneous and hypersensitivity reactions
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported with etravirine. In clinical trials, 
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and erythema multiforme have been rarely (< 0.1%) reported. Treatment 
with INTELENCE should be discontinued if a severe cutaneous reaction develops.
The clinical data are limited and an increased risk of cutaneous reactions in patients with a history of 
NNRTI-associated cutaneous reactions cannot be excluded. Caution should be observed in such 
patients, especially in case of history of a severe cutaneous drug reaction.
Cases of severe hypersensitivity syndromes, including DRESS (Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and 
Systemic Symptoms) and TEN (toxic epidermal necrolysis), sometimes fatal, have been reported with 
the use of etravirine (see section 4.8). The DRESS syndrome is characterised by rash, fever, 
4
eosinophilia and systemic involvement (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied 
by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, hepatitis
and eosinophilia). Time to onset is usually around 3-6 weeks and the outcome in most cases is 
favourable upon discontinuation and after initiation of corticosteroid therapy.
Patients should be informed to seek medical advice if severe rash or hypersensitivity reactions occur. 
Patients who are diagnosed with a hypersensitivity reaction whilst on therapy must discontinue 
INTELENCE immediately.
Delay in stopping INTELENCE treatment after the onset of severe rash may result in a life-threatening 
reaction.
Patients who have stopped treatment due to hypersensitivity reactions should not restart therapy with 
INTELENCE.
Rash
Rash has been reported with etravirine. Most frequently, rash was mild to moderate, occurred in the 
second week of therapy, and was infrequent after week 4. Rash was mostly self-limiting and generally 
resolved within 1 to 2 weeks on continued therapy. When prescribing INTELENCE to females, 
prescribers should be aware that the incidence of rash was higher in females (see section 4.8).
Paediatric population
For children who cannot swallow the tablet(s) whole, the tablet(s) may be dispersed in liquid. This 
should only be considered if the child is likely to take the entire dose of the tablet(s) in liquid (see 
sections 4.2 and 6.6). The importance of consuming the entire dose needs to be highlighted to the child 
and his/her caregiver to avoid too low exposure and lack of virologic response. In case of any doubt 
that a child will take the entire dose of the tablet(s) dispersed in liquid, treatment with another 
antiretroviral product needs to be considered.
Elderly
Experience in geriatric patients is limited: in the Phase III trials, 6 patients aged 65 years or older and 
53 patients aged 56-64 years received etravirine. The type and incidence of adverse reactions in 
patients > 55 years of age were similar to the ones in younger patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Pregnancy
Given the increased etravirine exposure during pregnancy, caution should be applied for those 
pregnant patients that require concomitant medicinal products or have comorbidities that may further 
increase etravirine exposure.
Patients with coexisting conditions
Hepatic impairment
Etravirine is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver and highly bound to plasma proteins. 
Effects on unbound exposure could be expected (has not been studied) and therefore caution is advised 
in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Etravirine has not been studied in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and its use is therefore not recommended in this group of 
patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Co-infection with HBV (hepatitis B virus) or HCV (hepatitis C virus)
Caution should be exercised in patients co-infected with hepatitis B or C virus due to the current 
limited data available. A potential increased risk of liver enzymes increase cannot be excluded.
5
Weight and metabolic parameters
An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral 
therapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in 
some cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating 
this to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to 
established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.
Immune reconstitution syndrome
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an 
inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause 
serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed 
within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus 
retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Any 
inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to 
occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and 
these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.8).
Osteonecrosis
Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been 
reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART. 
Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint 
stiffness or difficulty in movement.
Interactions with medicinal products
It is not recommended to combine etravirine with tipranavir/ritonavir, due to a marked 
pharmacokinetic interaction (76% decrease of etravirine AUC) that could significantly impair the 
virologic response to etravirine.
The combination of etravirine with daclatasvir, atazanavir/cobicistat or darunavir/cobicistat is not 
recommended (see section 4.5).
For further information on interactions with medicinal products see section 4.5.
Lactose intolerance and lactase deficiency
INTELENCE 25 mg tablets
Each tablet contains 40 mg of lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of 
galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take 
this medicine.
INTELENCE 100 mg tablets
Each tablet contains 160 mg of lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of 
galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take 
this medicine.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Medicinal products that affect etravirine exposure
Etravirine is metabolised by CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 followed by glucuronidation of the 
metabolites by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UDPGT). Medicinal products that 
6
induce CYP3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 may increase the clearance of etravirine, resulting in lowered 
plasma concentrations of etravirine.
Co-administration of etravirine and medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 
may decrease the clearance of etravirine and may result in increased plasma concentrations of 
etravirine.
Medicinal products that are affected by the use of etravirine
Etravirine is a weak inducer of CYP3A4. Co-administration of etravirine with medicinal products 
primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 may result in decreased plasma concentrations of such medicinal 
products, which could decrease or shorten their therapeutic effects.
Etravirine is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Etravirine is also a weak inhibitor of 
P-glycoprotein. Co-administration with medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C9 or 
CYP2C19, or transported by P-glycoprotein, may result in increased plasma concentrations of such 
medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect or alter their adverse 
events profile.
Known and theoretical interactions with selected antiretrovirals and non-antiretroviral medicinal 
products are listed in table 2. The table is not all-inclusive.
Interaction table
Interactions between etravirine and co-administered medicinal products are listed in table 2 (increase 
is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, not done as “ND”, confidence interval as 
“CI”).

NNRTIs
Efavirenz
Nevirapine
Rilpivirine
It is not recommended to 
co-administer INTELENCE 
with other NNRTIs.
Combining two NNRTIs has not been shown to 
be beneficial. Concomitant use of etravirine 
with efavirenz or nevirapine may cause a 
significant decrease in the plasma concentration 
of etravirine and loss of therapeutic effect of 
etravirine.
Concomitant use of etravirine with rilpivirine 
may cause a decrease in the plasma 
concentration of rilpivirine and loss of 
therapeutic effect of rilpivirine.
HIV Protease Inhibitors (PIs) – Unboosted (i.e. without co-administration of low-dose ritonavir)
Indinavir
Concomitant use of etravirine with indinavir

Not studied. INTELENCE is expected to 
decrease plasma concentrations of these 
antiarrhythmics.
Etravirine significantly 
reduced plasma 
concentrations of 
dolutegravir. The effect of 
etravirine on dolutegravir 
plasma concentrations was 
mitigated by 
co-administration of 
darunavir/ritonavir or 
lopinavir/ritonavir, and is
expected to be mitigated by 
atazanavir/ritonavir.
INTELENCE should only be 
used with dolutegravir when 
co-administered with 
atazanavir/ritonavir,
darunavir/ritonavir, or 
lopinavir/ritonavir. This 
combination can be used 
without dose adjustment.
INTELENCE and raltegravir 
can be used without dose 
adjustments.
INTELENCE and digoxin 
can be used without dose 
adjustments. It is 
recommended that digoxin 
levels be monitored when 
digoxin is combined with 
INTELENCE.
Caution is warranted and 
therapeutic concentration 
monitoring, if available, is 
recommended for 
antiarrhythmics when 
co-administered with 
INTELENCE.
Not studied. Based on the biliary elimination 
pathway of azithromycin, no drug interactions 
are expected between azithromycin and 
INTELENCE.
INTELENCE and 
azithromycin can be used 
without dose adjustments.

ANTICOAGULANTS
Warfarin
Not studied. Etravirine is expected to increase 
plasma concentrations of warfarin.
Clarithromycin exposure was 
decreased by etravirine; 
however, concentrations of 
the active metabolite, 
14-OH-clarithromycin, were 
increased. Because 
14-OH-clarithromycin has 
reduced activity against 
Mycobacterium avium
complex (MAC), overall 
activity against this pathogen 
may be altered; therefore 
alternatives to clarithromycin 
should be considered for the 
treatment of MAC.
It is recommended that the 
international normalised ratio 
(INR) be monitored when 
warfarin is combined with 
INTELENCE.

Cmax ↑ 1.75 (1.60-1.91)
Not studied. Posaconazole, a potent inhibitor of 
CYP3A4, may increase plasma concentrations 
of etravirine. Itraconazole and ketoconazole are 
potent inhibitors as well as substrates of 
CYP3A4. Concomitant systemic use of 
itraconazole or ketoconazole and etravirine may 
increase plasma concentrations of etravirine. 
Simultaneously, plasma concentrations of 
itraconazole or ketoconazole may be decreased 
by etravirine.

ANTIMYCOBACTERIALS
Rifampicin
Rifapentine
Rifabutin
300 mg once daily
Not studied. Rifampicin and rifapentine are 
expected to decrease plasma concentrations of 
etravirine.
INTELENCE should be used in combination 
with a boosted PI. Rifampicin is contraindicated 
in combination with boosted Pis.
With an associated boosted PI:
No interaction study has been performed. Based 
on historical data, a decrease in etravirine 
exposure may be expected whereas an increase 
in rifabutin exposure and especially in 
25-O-desacetyl-rifabutin may be expected.
With no associated boosted PI (out of the 
recommended indication for etravirine):
rifabutin
AUC ↓ 0.83 (0.75-0.94)
Cmin ↓ 0.76 (0.66-0.87)

AUC ↓ 0.63 (0.54-0.74)
Cmin ↓ 0.65 (0.56-0.74)
Cmax ↓ 0.63 (0.53-0.74)
Close monitoring of 
antimalarial response is 
warranted when 
co-administering 
INTELENCE and 
artemether/lumefantrine as a 
significant decrease in 
exposure of artemether and 
its active metabolite, 
dihydroartemisinin, may 
result in decreased 
antimalarial efficacy. No 
dose adjustment is needed for 
INTELENCE.
Combination not 
recommended.
The combination of 
INTELENCE with a boosted 
PI and rifabutin should be 
used with caution due to the 
risk of decrease in etravirine 
exposure and the risk of 
increase in rifabutin and 
25-O-desacetyl-rifabutin 
exposures.
Close monitoring for 
virologic response and for 
rifabutin related adverse 
reactions is recommended.
Please refer to the product 
information of the associated 
boosted PI for the dose 
adjustment of rifabutin to be 
used.

PLATELET AGGREGGATION INHIBITORS
Co-administration with 
systemic 
immunosuppressants should 
be done with caution because 
plasma concentrations of 
cyclosporin, sirolimus and 
tacrolimus may be affected 
when co-administered with 
INTELENCE.
No changes in methadone 
dosage were required based 
on clinical status during or 
after the period of 
INTELENCE 
co-administration.
Concomitant use of PDE-5 
inhibitors with INTELENCE 
may require dose adjustment 
of the PDE-5 inhibitor to 
attain the desired clinical 
effect.
Clopidogrel
In vitro data show that etravirine has inhibitory 
properties on CYP2C19. It is therefore possible 
that etravirine may inhibit the metabolism of 
clopidogrel to its active metabolite by such 
inhibition of CYP2C19 in vivo. The clinical 
relevance of this interaction has not been
demonstrated.
As a precaution it is 
recommended that 
concomitant use of etravirine 
and clopidogrel should be 
discouraged.

4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
As a general rule, when deciding to use antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in
pregnant women, and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn, 
the animal data as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account in 
order to characterise the safety for the foetus.
Placental transfer has been seen in pregnant rats, but it is not known whether placental transfer of 
etravirine also occurs in pregnant women. Studies in animals do not indicate direct or indirect harmful 
effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development 
(see section 5.3). Based on animal data the malformative risk is unlikely in humans. The clinical data 
do not raise safety concern but are very limited.
Breast-feeding
Etravirine is excreted in human milk.
Because of the potential for adverse events in nursing infants, women should be instructed not to 
breastfeed if they are receiving INTELENCE. It is recommended that women living with HIV do not 
breastfeed in order to avoid transmission of HIV.
Fertility
No human data on the effect of etravirine on fertility are available. In rats, there was no effect on 
mating or fertility with etravirine treatment (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
INTELENCE has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. No studies on the effects 
of INTELENCE on the ability to drive or operate machines have been performed. Adverse reactions 
such as somnolence and vertigo have been reported in etravirine-treated patients and should be 
considered when assessing a patient’s ability to drive or operate machinery (see section 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most frequent (incidence ≥ 10%) adverse reactions of all intensities reported for etravirine were 
rash, diarrhoea, nausea and headache. In the Phase III studies, the rates of discontinuation due to any 
adverse reaction were 7.2% in patients receiving etravirine. The most common adverse reaction
leading to discontinuation was rash.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Adverse reactions reported in patients treated with etravirine are summarised in Table 3. The adverse 
reactions are listed by system organ class (SOC) and frequency. Within each frequency grouping, 
adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as very 
common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) and uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare 
(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and very rare (< 1/10,000).

Description of selected adverse reactions
Rash
Rash was most frequently mild to moderate, generally macular to maculopapular or erythematous, 
mostly occurred in the second week of therapy, and was infrequent after week 4. Rash was mostly 
self-limiting, and generally resolved within 1-2 weeks on continued therapy (see section 4.4). The 
16
incidence of rash was higher in women compared to men in the etravirine arm in the DUET trials 
(rash ≥ grade 2 was reported in 9/60 [15.0%] women versus 51/539 [9.5%] men; discontinuations due 
to rash were reported in 3/60 [5.0%] women versus 10/539 [1.9%] men) (see section 4.4). There was 
no gender difference in severity or treatment discontinuation due to rash. The clinical data are limited 
and an increased risk of cutaneous reactions in patients with a history of NNRTI-associated cutaneous 
reaction cannot be excluded (see section 4.4).
Metabolic parameters
Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see 
section 4.4)
Immune reconstitution syndrome
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic 
infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have 
also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur 
many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).
Osteonecrosis
Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk 
factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy. The 
frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).
Paediatric population (1 year to less than 18 years of age)
The safety assessment in children and adolescents is based on two single-arm trials. PIANO 
(TMC125-C213) is a Phase II trial in which 101 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected 
paediatric patients 6 years to less than 18 years of age received INTELENCE in combination with 
other antiretroviral agents. TMC125-C234/IMPAACT P1090 is a Phase I/II trial in which 
26 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged 1 years to less than 
6 years received INTELENCE in combination with other antiretroviral agents (see section 5.1).
In PIANO and TMC125-C234/IMPAACT P1090, the frequency, type and severity of adverse 
reactions in paediatric patients were comparable to those observed in adults. In PIANO, rash was 
reported more frequently in female subjects than in male subjects (rash ≥ grade 2 was reported in 
13/64 [20.3%] females versus 2/37 [5.4%] males; discontinuations due to rash were reported in 4/64 
[6.3%] females versus 0/37 [0%] males) (see section 4.4). Most often, rash was mild to moderate, of 
macular/papular type, and occurred in the second week of therapy. Rash was mostly self-limiting and 
generally resolved within 1 week on continued therapy.
In a postmarketing retrospective cohort study aiming at substantiating the long-term safety profile of 
etravirine in HIV-1-infected children and adolescents receiving etravirine with other HIV-1 
antiretrovirals (N = 182), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome was reported at a higher incidence (1%) than has 
been reported in adult clinical trials (< 0.1%).
Other special populations
Patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus
In the pooled analysis for DUET-1 and DUET-2, the incidence of hepatic events tended to be higher in 
co-infected subjects treated with etravirine compared to co-infected subjects in the placebo group. 
INTELENCE should be used with caution in these patients (see also sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
17
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
There are no data with regard to symptomatic overdose with etravirine, but it is possible that the most 
frequent adverse reactions of etravirine, i.e. rash, diarrhoea, nausea, and headache would be the most 
common symptoms noted. There is no specific antidote for overdose with etravirine. Treatment of 
overdose with INTELENCE consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital 
signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. Since etravirine is highly protein bound, 
dialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal of the active substance.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors, ATC code: J05AG04.
Mechanism of action
Etravirine is an NNRTI of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Etravirine binds directly to 
reverse transcriptase (RT) and blocks the RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase 
activities by causing a disruption of the enzyme’s catalytic site.
Antiviral activity in vitro
Etravirine exhibits activity against wild type HIV-1 in T-cell lines and primary cells with median 
EC50 values ranging from 0.9 to 5.5 nM. Etravirine demonstrates activity against HIV-1 group M 
(subtypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G) and HIV-1 group O primary isolates with EC50 values ranging from 
0.3 to 1.7 nM and from 11.5 to 21.7 nM, respectively. Although etravirine demonstrates in vitro 
activity against wild type HIV-2 with median EC50 values ranging from 5.7 to 7.2 µM, treatment of 
HIV-2 infection with etravirine is not recommended in the absence of clinical data. Etravirine retains 
activity against HIV-1 viral strains resistant to nucleoside reverse transcriptase and/or protease 
inhibitors. In addition, etravirine demonstrates a fold change (FC) in EC50 ≤ 3 against 60% of 
6,171 NNRTI-resistant clinical isolates.
Resistance
Etravirine efficacy in relation to NNRTI resistance at baseline has mainly been analysed with 
etravirine given in combination with darunavir/ritonavir (DUET-1 and DUET-2). Boosted protease 
inhibitors, like darunavir/ritonavir, show a higher barrier to resistance compared to other classes of 
antiretrovirals. The breakpoints for reduced efficacy with etravirine (> 2 etravirine-associated 
mutations at baseline, see clinical results section) applies when etravirine is given in combination with 
a boosted protease inhibitor. This breakpoint might be lower in antiretroviral combination therapy not 
including a boosted protease inhibitor.
In the Phase III trials DUET-1 and DUET-2, mutations that developed most commonly in patients 
with virologic failure to the etravirine containing regimen were V108I, V179F, V179I, Y181C and 
Y181I, which usually emerged in a background of multiple other NNRTI resistance-associated 
mutations (RAMs). In all the other trials conducted with etravirine in HIV-1 infected patients, the 
following mutations emerged most commonly: L100I, E138G, V179F, V179I, Y181C and H221Y.
18
Cross-resistance
Following virologic failure of an etravirine-containing regimen it is not recommended to treat patients 
with efavirenz and/or nevirapine.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Treatment-experienced adult patients
Pivotal studies
The evidence of efficacy of etravirine is based on 48-week data from 2 Phase III trials DUET-1 and 
DUET-2. These trials were identical in design and similar efficacy for etravirine was seen in each trial. 
The results below are pooled data from the two trials.
Trial characteristics
-
-
Design: randomised (1:1), double-blinded, placebo-controlled.
Treatment: Etravirine vs. placebo, in addition to a background regimen (BR) including
darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/rtv), investigator-selected N(t)RTIs and optional enfuvirtide (ENF).
Main inclusion criteria:


HIV-1 plasma viral load > 5,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml at screening
1 or more NNRTI resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) at screening or from prior 
genotypic analysis (i.e., archived resistance)
3 or more primary PI mutations at screening
on a stable antiretroviral regimen for at least 8 weeks.


Stratification: Randomisation was stratified by the intended use of ENF in the BR, previous use 
of darunavir and screening viral load.
Virologic response was defined as achieving a confirmed undetectable viral load 
(< 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml).

Since there was a significant interaction effect between treatment and ENF, the primary analysis was 
done for 2 ENF strata (patients reusing or not using ENF versus patients using ENF de novo). The 
week 48 results from the pooled analysis of DUET-1 and DUET-2 demonstrated that the etravirine
arm was superior to the placebo arm irrespective of whether ENF was used de novo (p = 0.0199) or 
not (p < 0.0001). Results of this analysis (week 48 data) by ENF stratum are shown in table 4.
Significantly fewer patients in the etravirine arm reached a clinical endpoint (AIDS-defining illness 
and/or death) as compared to the placebo arm (p = 0.0408).
A subgroup analysis of the virologic response (defined as a viral load < 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml) at 
week 48 by baseline viral load and baseline CD4 count (pooled DUET data) is presented in table 5.

Baseline genotype or phenotype and virologic outcome analyses
In DUET-1 and DUET-2, the presence at baseline of 3 or more of the following mutations: V90I, 
A98G, L100I, K101E, K101P, V106I, V179D, V179F, Y181C, Y181I, Y181V, G190A and G190S, 
(etravirine RAMs) was associated with a decreased virologic response to etravirine (see table 6). 
These individual mutations occurred in the presence of other NNRTI RAMs. V179F was never present 
without Y181C.
Conclusions regarding the relevance of particular mutations or mutational patterns are subject to 
change with additional data, and it is recommended to always consult current interpretation systems 
for analysing resistance test results.

Note: all patients in the DUET trials received a background regimen consisting of darunavir/rtv, investigator-selected 
NRTIs and optional enfuvirtide.
The presence of K103N alone, which was the most prevalent NNRTI mutation in DUET-1 and 
DUET-2 at baseline, was not identified as a mutation associated with resistance to etravirine. 
Furthermore, the presence of this mutation alone did not affect the response in the etravirine arm. 
Additional data is required to conclude on the influence of K103N when associated with other 
NNRTIs mutations.
Data from the DUET studies suggest that baseline fold change (FC) in EC50 to etravirine was a 
predictive factor of virologic outcome, with gradually decreasing responses observed above FC 3 and 
FC 13.
FC subgroups are based on the select patient populations in DUET-1 and DUET-2 and are not meant 
to represent definitive clinical susceptibility breakpoints for etravirine.
Exploratory head to head comparison with protease inhibitor in protease inhibitor naïve patients 
(trial TMC125-C227)
TMC125-C227 was an exploratory, randomised, active-controlled open-label trial, which investigated 
the efficacy and safety of etravirine in a treatment regimen, which is not approved under the current 
indication. In the TMC125-C227 study, etravirine (N = 59) was administered with 
2 investigator-selected NRTIs (i.e. without a ritonavir-boosted PI) and compared to an 
investigator-selected combination of a PI with 2 NRTIs (N = 57). The trial population included 
PI-naïve, NNRTI-experienced patients with evidence of NNRTI resistance.
At week 12, virologic response was greater in the control-PI arm (-2.2 log10 copies/ml from baseline; 
n = 53) compared to the etravirine arm (-1.4 log10 copies/ml from baseline; n = 40). This difference 
between treatment arms was statistically significant.
Based on these trial results, etravirine is not recommended for use in combination with N(t)RTIs only 
in patients who have experienced virological failure on an NNRTI- and N(t)RTI-containing regimen.
Paediatric population
Treatment-experienced paediatric patients (6 years to less than 18 years of age)
PIANO is a single-arm, Phase II trial evaluating the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy 
of etravirine in 101 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric patients 6 years to 
less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 16 kg. The study enrolled patients on a stable but 
virologically failing antiretroviral treatment regimen, with a confirmed HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load 
≥ 500 copies/ml. Sensitivity of the virus to etravirine at screening was required.
The median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 3.9 log10 copies/ml, and the median baseline CD4 cell 
count was 385 x 106 cells/l.

At week 48, 53.5% of all paediatric patients had a confirmed undetectable viral load < 50 HIV-1 RNA 
copies/ml according to the TLOVR algorithm. The proportion of paediatric patients with 
< 400 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml was 63.4%. The mean change in plasma HIV-1 RNA from baseline to 
week 48 was -1.53 log10 copies/ml, and the mean CD4 cell count increase from baseline was

Treatment-experienced paediatric patients (1 year to less than 6 years of age)
TMC125-C234/IMPAACT P1090 is a Phase I/II trial evaluating the pharmacokinetics, safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of INTELENCE in 20 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected 
pediatric patients 2 years to less than 6 years of age (Cohort I) and 6 antiretroviral treatment-
experienced HIV-1 infected pediatric patients 1 year to less than 2 years of age (Cohort II). No 
patients have been enrolled in Cohort III (≥ 2 months to < 1 year). The study enrolled patients on a 
virologically failing antiretroviral treatment regimen for at least 8 weeks or on a treatment interruption 
of at least 4 weeks with a history of virologic failure while on an antiretroviral regimen, with a 
confirmed HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load greater than 1,000 copies/ml and with no evidence of 
phenotypic resistance to etravirine at screening.
Table 8 summarizes the virologic response results for the TMC125-C234/IMPAACT P1090 study.

Subgroup analyses showed that for subjects aged 2 to less than 6 years virologic response [HIV RNA 
< 400 copies/ml] was 100.0% [6/6] for subjects who swallowed the etravirine tablet whole, 100% 
[4/4] for subjects who took a combination of both etravirine dispersed in liquid and etravirine tablet 
whole and 60% [6/10] for subjects who took etravirine dispersed in liquid. Of the 4 subjects who did 
not show virologic response and took etravirine dispersed in liquid, 3 showed virologic failure and had 
adherence issues, and one discontinued prior to Week 48 for safety reasons.
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
INTELENCE in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in human immunodeficiency virus 
infection, as per Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) decision in the granted indication (see section 4.2 
for information on paediatric use).
Pregnancy and postpartum
Etravirine (200 mg twice daily), evaluated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products 
in a study of 15 pregnant women during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and postpartum, 
demonstrated that exposure to total etravirine was generally higher during pregnancy compared with 
postpartum, and less so for unbound etravirine exposure (see section 5.2). There were no new 
clinically relevant safety findings in the mothers or in the newborns in this trial.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetic properties of etravirine have been evaluated in adult healthy subjects and in adult 
and paediatric treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected patients. Exposure to etravirine was lower 
(35-50%) in HIV-1 infected patients than in healthy subjects.

* All HIV-1 infected subjects enrolled in Phase III clinical trials received darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily as 
part of their background regimen. Therefore, the pharmacokinetic parameter estimates shown in the table account for 
reductions in the pharmacokinetic parameters of etravirine due to co-administration of etravirine with 
darunavir/ritonavir.
Note: The median protein binding adjusted EC50 for MT4 cells infected with HIV-1/IIIB in vitro = 4 ng/ml.
Absorption
An intravenous formulation of etravirine is unavailable, thus, the absolute bioavailability of etravirine 
is unknown. After oral administration with food, the maximum plasma concentration of etravirine is 
generally achieved within 4 hours.
23
In healthy subjects, the absorption of etravirine is not affected by co-administration of oral ranitidine 
or omeprazole, medicinal products that are known to increase gastric pH.
Effect of food on absorption
The systemic exposure (AUC) to etravirine was decreased by about 50% when etravirine was 
administered under fasting conditions, as compared to administration following a meal. Therefore, 
INTELENCE should be taken following a meal.
Distribution
Etravirine is approximately 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin (99.6%) and α1-acid 
glycoprotein (97.66%-99.02%) in vitro. The distribution of etravirine into compartments other than 
plasma (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, genital tract secretions) has not been evaluated in humans.
Biotransformation
In vitro experiments with human liver microsomes (HLMs) indicate that etravirine primarily 
undergoes oxidative metabolism by the hepatic cytochrome CYP450 (CYP3A) system and, to a lesser 
extent, by the CYP2C family, followed by glucuronidation.
Elimination
After administration of a radiolabeled 14C-etravirine dose, 93.7% and 1.2% of the administered dose of 
14C-etravirine could be retrieved in faeces and urine, respectively. Unchanged etravirine accounted for 
81.2% to 86.4% of the administered dose in faeces. Unchanged etravirine in faeces is likely to be 
unabsorbed drug. Unchanged etravirine was not detected in urine. The terminal elimination half-life of 
etravirine was approximately 30-40 hours.
Special populations
Paediatric population (1 year to less than 18 years of age)
The pharmacokinetics of etravirine in 122 treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric patients, 
1 year to less than 18 years of age, showed that the administered weight-based dosages resulted in 
etravirine exposure comparable to that in adults receiving etravirine 200 mg twice daily (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.2). The population pharmacokinetic estimates for etravirine AUC12h and C0h are 
summarised in the table below.

Elderly
Population pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV infected patients showed that etravirine pharmacokinetics 
are not considerably different in the age range (18 to 77 years) evaluated, with 6 subjects aged 
65 years or older (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Gender
No significant pharmacokinetic differences have been observed between males and females. A limited 
number of females were included in the studies.
Race
Population pharmacokinetic analysis of etravirine in HIV infected patients indicated no apparent 
difference in the exposure to etravirine between Caucasian, Hispanic and Black subjects. The 
pharmacokinetics in other races have not been sufficiently evaluated.
Hepatic impairment
Etravirine is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver. In a study comparing 8 patients with 
mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment to 8 matched controls and 8 patients with moderate 
(Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment to 8 matched controls, the multiple dose pharmacokinetic 
disposition of etravirine was not altered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
However, unbound concentrations have not been assessed. Increased unbound exposure could be 
expected. No dose adjustment is suggested but caution is advised in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment. INTELENCE has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh Class C) and is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection
Population pharmacokinetic analysis of the DUET-1 and DUET-2 trials showed reduced clearance 
(potentially leading to increased exposure and alteration of the safety profile) for etravirine in HIV-1 
infected patients with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection. In view of the limited data 
available in hepatitis B and/or C co-infected patients, particular caution should be paid when 
INTELENCE is used in these patients (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
Renal impairment
The pharmacokinetics of etravirine have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency. Results 
from a mass balance study with radioactive 14C-etravirine showed that < 1.2% of the administered 
dose of etravirine is excreted in the urine. No unchanged drug was detected in urine so the impact of 
renal impairment on etravirine elimination is expected to be minimal. As etravirine is highly bound to 
plasma proteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal 
dialysis (see section 4.2).
Pregnancy and postpartum
Study TMC114HIV3015 evaluated etravirine 200 mg twice daily in combination with other 
antiretroviral medicinal products in 15 pregnant women during the second and third trimesters of 
pregnancy and postpartum. The total etravirine exposure after intake of etravirine 200 mg twice daily
as part of an antiretroviral regimen was generally higher during pregnancy compared with postpartum 
(see Table 11). The differences were less pronounced for unbound etravirine exposure.
In women receiving etravirine 200 mg twice daily, higher mean values for Cmax, AUC12h and Cmin were 
observed during pregnancy compared to postpartum. During the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy 
mean values of these parameters were comparable.
Table 11: Pharmacokinetic results of total etravirine after administration of etravirine 
200 mg twice daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen, during the 2nd trimester of

of pregnancy as compared to postpartum, and 1.1-, 1.4- and 1.2-fold higher, respectively, based during 
the 3rd trimester of pregnancy as compared to postpartum.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Animal toxicology studies have been conducted with etravirine in mice, rats, rabbits and dogs. In 
mice, the key target organs identified were the liver and the coagulation system. Haemorrhagic 
cardiomyopathy was only observed in male mice and was considered to be secondary to severe 
coagulopathy mediated via the vitamin K pathway. In the rat, the key target organs identified were the 
liver, the thyroid and the coagulation system. Exposure in mice was equivalent to human exposure 
while in rats it was below the clinical exposure at the recommended dose. In the dog, changes were 
observed in the liver and gall bladder at exposures approximately 8-fold higher than human exposure 
observed at the recommended dose (200 mg twice daily).
In a study conducted in rats, there were no effects on mating or fertility at exposure levels equivalent 
to those in humans at the clinically recommended dose. There was no teratogenicity with etravirine in 
rats and rabbits at exposures equivalent to those observed in humans at the recommended clinical 
dose. Etravirine had no effect on offspring development during lactation or post weaning at maternal 
exposures equivalent to those observed at the recommended clinical dose.
Etravirine was not carcinogenic in rats and in male mice. An increase in the incidences of 
hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were observed in female mice. The observed hepatocellular 
findings in female mice are generally considered to be rodent specific, associated with liver enzyme 
induction, and of limited relevance to humans. At the highest tested doses, the systemic exposures 
(based on AUC) to etravirine were 0.6-fold (mice) and between 0.2- and 0.7-fold (rats), relative to 
those observed in humans at the recommended therapeutic dose (200 mg twice daily).
In vitro and in vivo studies with etravirine revealed no evidence of a mutagenic potential.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What INTELENCE is and what it is used for
INTELENCE contains the active substance etravirine. INTELENCE belongs to a group of anti-HIV 
medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).
INTELENCE is a medicine used for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) 
infection. INTELENCE works by reducing the amount of HIV in your body. This will improve your 
immune system and reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection.
INTELENCE is used in combination with other anti-HIV medicines to treat adults and children 
2 years of age and older who are infected by HIV and who have used other anti-HIV medicines before.
Your doctor will discuss with you which combination of medicines is best for you.
2. What you need to know before you take INTELENCE
Do not take INTELENCE
-
if you are allergic to etravirine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6)
if you are taking elbasvir/grazoprevir (a medicine to treat hepatitis C infection).
-
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking INTELENCE.
INTELENCE is not a cure for HIV infection. It is part of a treatment reducing the amount of virus in 
the blood.
Elderly
INTELENCE has only been used in a limited number of patients of 65 years or older. If you belong to 
this age group, please discuss the use of INTELENCE with your doctor.
46
Weight and increased blood lipids and glucose
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This 
is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.
Bone problems
Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called 
osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of 
combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe 
immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for 
developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the 
hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please 
inform your doctor.
Tell your doctor about your situation
Make sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.
-
Tell your doctor if you develop a rash. If a rash occurs, it usually appears soon after anti-HIV 
treatment with INTELENCE is started and often disappears within 1 to 2 weeks, even with 
continued use of the medicine. Rarely, during INTELENCE treatment, you can experience 
severe skin rash with blisters or peeling skin, particularly around the mouth or eyes or 
hypersensitivity reaction (allergic reaction including rash and fever but also swelling of the face, 
tongue or throat, difficulty in breathing or swallowing) which could be potentially 
life-threatening. Please contact your doctor immediately if you experience these symptoms. 
Your doctor will advise you how to deal with your symptoms and whether INTELENCE must 
be stopped. If you have stopped treatment due to a hypersensitivity reaction, you should not 
restart therapy with INTELENCE.
Tell your doctor if you have or have had problems with your liver, including hepatitis B and/or 
C. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can take 
INTELENCE.
Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infections. In some patients with 
advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of 
inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is 
believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, 
enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when 
the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines 
for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after 
the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as 
muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of 
the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek 
necessary treatment.

Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children less than 2 years of age and weighing less than 10 kg because the 
potential benefits and risks have not been established.
Other medicines and INTELENCE
INTELENCE might interact with other medicines. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, 
have recently taken, or might take any other medicines.
In most cases, INTELENCE can be combined with anti-HIV medicines belonging to another class.
However, some combinations are not recommended. In other cases, increased monitoring and/or a 
change in the dose of the medicine may be needed. Therefore, always tell your doctor which other 
anti-HIV medicines you take. Furthermore, it is important that you carefully read the package leaflets 
that are provided with these medicines. Follow your doctor’s instruction carefully on which medicines 
can be combined.
47
It is not recommended to combine INTELENCE with any of the following medicines:
-
tipranavir/ritonavir, efavirenz, nevirapine, rilpivirine, indinavir, atazanavir/cobicistat, 
darunavir/cobicistat (anti-HIV medicine)
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines to prevent seizures)
rifampicin, because it is contraindicated with boosted protease inhibitors, and rifapentine 
(medicines to treat some infections such as tuberculosis)
products that contain St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal product used for 
depression)
daclatasvir (a medicine to treat hepatitis C infection).
-
-
-
-
If you are taking any of these, ask your doctor for advice.
The effects of INTELENCE or other medicines might be influenced if you take INTELENCE 
together with any of the following medicines. The dosages of some medicines might need to be 
changed since their therapeutic effect or side effects may be influenced when combined with 
INTELENCE. Tell your doctor if you take:
-
-
dolutegravir, maraviroc, amprevanir/ritonavir and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (anti-HIV medicine)
amiodarone, bepridil, digoxin, disopyramide, flecainide, lidocaine, mexiletine, propafenone and 
quinidine (medicines to treat certain heart disorders, e.g., abnormal heart beat)
warfarin (a medicine used to reduce clotting of the blood). Your doctor will have to check your 
blood
fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole (medicines to treat fungal 
infections)
clarithromycin, rifabutin (antibiotics)
artemether/lumefantrine (a medicine to treat malaria)
diazepam (medicines to treat trouble with sleeping and/or anxiety)
dexamethasone (a corticosteroid used in a variety of conditions such as inflammation and 
allergic reactions)
atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin (cholesterol-lowering medicines)
cyclosporine, sirolimus, tacrolimus (immunosuppressants – medicines used to dampen down 
your immune system)

Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant. Pregnant women should not take INTELENCE 
unless specifically directed by the doctor.
Because of the potential for side effects in breast-fed infants, it is recommended that women not 
breast-feed if they are receiving INTELENCE. 
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should 
discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible.
Driving and using machines
Do not drive or operate machines if you feel sleepy or dizzy after taking your medicines.
INTELENCE contains lactose
INTELENCE tablets contain lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars (lactose), contact your doctor before taking this medicine.
INTELENCE contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium 
free’.
48
3.
How to take INTELENCE
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Use in adults
Other form(s) of this medicine may be more suitable for adults.
The recommended dose of INTELENCE is 200 mg twice a day.
In the morning, take two 100 milligram INTELENCE tablets, following a meal.
In the evening, take two 100 milligram INTELENCE tablets, following a meal.
Use in children and adolescents 2 years of age and older and weighing at least 10 kg
The doctor will work out the right dose based on the weight of the child.
The doctor will inform you exactly how much INTELENCE the child should take.
Instructions for taking INTELENCE for all patients
It is important that you take INTELENCE following a meal. If you take INTELENCE on an empty 
stomach, only half the amount of INTELENCE is absorbed. Follow your doctor’s advice on the type 
of meal you should be taking with INTELENCE.
Swallow the INTELENCE tablet(s) whole with a glass of water. Do not chew the tablet(s). The tablet 
can be divided into two equal doses.
If you are unable to swallow the INTELENCE tablet(s) whole, you may do the following:
-
-
-
-
-
place the tablet(s) in 5 ml (1 teaspoon) of water, or at least enough liquid to cover the 
medicine,
stir well for about 1 minute until the water looks milky,
if desired, add up to 30 ml (2 tablespoons) more of water or alternatively orange juice or 
milk (do not place the tablets directly in orange juice or milk),
drink it immediately,
rinse the glass several times with water, orange juice, or milk and completely swallow the 
rinse each time to make sure you take the entire dose.
If you mix INTELENCE tablet(s) with a liquid, take this first, before other liquid anti-HIV medicines 
that you need to take at the same time.
Contact your doctor if you are not able to swallow the entire dose when mixed with a liquid.
If your child needs to take INTELENCE tablet(s) mixed with a liquid, it is very important that he/she 
takes the entire dose so that the right amount of medicine enters into the body. If the full dose is not 
taken, the risk of the virus developing resistance is higher. Contact your doctor if your child is not able 
to swallow the entire dose when mixed with a liquid, as they may consider giving another medicine to 
treat your child.
Do not use warm (40°C and above) or carbonated beverages when taking INTELENCE tablet(s).
Removing the child resistant cap
The plastic bottle comes with a child resistant cap and should be opened as 
follows:
-
-
Push the plastic screw cap down while turning it counter clockwise.
Remove the unscrewed cap.
49
If you take more INTELENCE than you should
Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately. The most frequent side effects of INTELENCE are 
rash, diarrhoea, nausea, and headache (see section ‘4. Possible side effects’).
If you forget to take INTELENCE
If you notice within 6 hours of the time you usually take INTELENCE, you must take the tablet(s)
as soon as possible. Always take the tablet(s) following a meal. Then take the next dose as usual. If 
you notice after 6 hours, then skip the intake and take the next doses as usual. Do not take a double 
dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you vomit less than 4 hours after taking INTELENCE, take another dose following a meal. If you 
vomit more than 4 hours after taking INTELENCE, then you do not need to take another dose until 
your regularly scheduled dose.
Contact your doctor if you are uncertain about what to do if you miss a dose or vomit.
Do not stop taking INTELENCE without talking to your doctor first
HIV therapy may increase your sense of well-being. Even if you feel better, do not stop taking 
INTELENCE or your other anti-HIV medicines. Doing so could increase the risk of the virus 
developing resistance. Talk to your doctor first.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What INTELENCE is and what it is used for
INTELENCE contains the active substance etravirine. INTELENCE belongs to a group of anti-HIV 
medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).
INTELENCE is a medicine used for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) 
infection. INTELENCE works by reducing the amount of HIV in your body. This will improve your 
immune system and reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection.
INTELENCE is used in combination with other anti-HIV medicines to treat adults and children 
2 years of age and older who are infected by HIV and who have used other anti-HIV medicines before.
Your doctor will discuss with you which combination of medicines is best for you.
2. What you need to know before you take INTELENCE
Do not take INTELENCE
-
if you are allergic to etravirine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6)
if you are taking elbasvir/grazoprevir (a medicine to treat hepatitis C infection).
-
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking INTELENCE.
INTELENCE is not a cure for HIV infection. It is part of a treatment reducing the amount of virus in 
the blood. 
Elderly
INTELENCE has only been used in a limited number of patients of 65 years or older. If you belong to 
this age group, please discuss the use of INTELENCE with your doctor.
54
Weight and increased blood lipids and glucose
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This 
is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.
Bone problems
Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called 
osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of 
combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe 
immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for 
developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the 
hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please 
inform your doctor.
Tell your doctor about your situation
Make sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.
-
Tell your doctor if you develop a rash. If a rash occurs, it usually appears soon after anti-HIV 
treatment with INTELENCE is started and often disappears within 1 to 2 weeks, even with 
continued use of the medicine. Rarely, during INTELENCE treatment, you can experience 
severe skin rash with blisters or peeling skin, particularly around the mouth or eyes or 
hypersensitivity reaction (allergic reaction including rash and fever but also swelling of the face, 
tongue or throat, difficulty in breathing or swallowing) which could be potentially 
life-threatening. Please contact your doctor immediately if you experience these symptoms. 
Your doctor will advise you how to deal with your symptoms and whether INTELENCE must 
be stopped. If you have stopped treatment due to a hypersensitivity reaction, you should not 
restart therapy with INTELENCE.
Tell your doctor if you have or have had problems with your liver, including hepatitis B and/or 
C. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can take 
INTELENCE.
Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infections. In some patients with 
advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of 
inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is 
believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, 
enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when 
the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines 
for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after 
the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as 
muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of 
the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek 
necessary treatment.

Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children less than 2 years of age and weighing less than 10 kg because the 
potential benefits and risks have not been established.
Other medicines and INTELENCE
INTELENCE might interact with other medicines. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking,
have recently taken, or might take any other medicines.
In most cases, INTELENCE can be combined with anti-HIV medicines belonging to another class.
However, some combinations are not recommended. In other cases, increased monitoring and/or a 
change in the dose of the medicine may be needed. Therefore, always tell your doctor which other 
anti-HIV medicines you take. Furthermore, it is important that you carefully read the package leaflets 
that are provided with these medicines. Follow your doctor’s instruction carefully on which medicines 
can be combined.
55
It is not recommended to combine INTELENCE with any of the following medicines:
-
tipranavir/ritonavir, efavirenz, nevirapine, rilpivirine, indinavir, atazanavir/cobicistat, 
darunavir/cobicistat (anti-HIV medicine)
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines to prevent seizures)
rifampicin, because it is contraindicated with boosted protease inhibitors, and rifapentine 
(medicines to treat some infections such as tuberculosis)
products that contain St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal product used for 
depression)
daclatasvir (a medicine to treat hepatitis C infection).
-
-
-
-
If you are taking any of these, ask your doctor for advice.
The effects of INTELENCE or other medicines might be influenced if you take INTELENCE 
together with any of the following medicines. The dosages of some medicines might need to be 
changed since their therapeutic effect or side effects may be influenced when combined with 
INTELENCE. Tell your doctor if you take:
-
-
dolutegravir, maraviroc, amprevanir/ritonavir and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (anti-HIV medicine)
amiodarone, bepridil, digoxin, disopyramide, flecainide, lidocaine, mexiletine, propafenone and 
quinidine (medicines to treat certain heart disorders, e.g., abnormal heart beat)
warfarin (a medicine used to reduce clotting of the blood). Your doctor will have to check your 
blood
fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole (medicines to treat fungal 
infections)
clarithromycin, rifabutin (antibiotics)
artemether/lumefantrine (a medicine to treat malaria)
diazepam (medicines to treat trouble with sleeping and/or anxiety)
dexamethasone (a corticosteroid used in a variety of conditions such as inflammation and 
allergic reactions)
atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin (cholesterol-lowering medicines)
cyclosporine, sirolimus, tacrolimus (immunosuppressants – medicines used to dampen down 
your immune system)
sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil (medicines to treat erectile dysfunction and/or pulmonary arterial 
hypertension)
clopidogrel (a medicine to prevent blood clots).

Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant. Pregnant women should not take INTELENCE 
unless specifically directed by the doctor.
Because of the potential for side effects in breast-fed infants, it is recommended that women not 
breast-feed if they are receiving INTELENCE. 
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should 
discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible.
Driving and using machines
Do not drive or operate machines if you feel sleepy or dizzy after taking your medicines.
INTELENCE contains lactose
INTELENCE tablets contain lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars (lactose), contact your doctor before taking this medicine.
INTELENCE contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium 
free’.
56
3.
How to take INTELENCE
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Use in adults
The recommended dose of INTELENCE is two tablets twice a day.
In the morning, take two 100 milligram INTELENCE tablets, following a meal.
In the evening, take two 100 milligram INTELENCE tablets, following a meal.
Use in children and adolescents 2 years of age and older and weighing at least 10 kg
The doctor will work out the right dose based on the weight of the child.
The doctor will inform you exactly how much INTELENCE the child should take.
Instructions for taking INTELENCE for all patients
It is important that you take INTELENCE following a meal. If you take INTELENCE on an empty 
stomach, only half the amount of INTELENCE is absorbed. Follow your doctor’s advice on the type 
of meal you should be taking with INTELENCE.
Swallow the INTELENCE tablet(s) whole with a glass of water. Do not chew the tablet(s).
If you are unable to swallow the INTELENCE tablet(s) whole, you may do the following:
-
-
-
-
-
place the tablet(s) in 5 ml (1 teaspoon) of water, or at least enough liquid to cover the 
medicine,
stir well for about 1 minute until the water looks milky,
if desired, add up to 30 ml (2 tablespoons) more of water or alternatively orange juice or 
milk (do not place the tablets directly in orange juice or milk),
drink it immediately,
rinse the glass several times with water, orange juice, or milk and completely swallow the 
rinse each time to make sure you take the entire dose.
If you mix INTELENCE tablet(s) with a liquid, take this first, before other liquid anti-HIV medicines 
that you need to take at the same time.
Contact your doctor if you are not able to swallow the entire dose when mixed with a liquid.
If your child needs to take INTELENCE tablet(s) mixed with a liquid, it is very important that he/she 
takes the entire dose so that the right amount of medicine enters into the body. If the full dose is not 
taken, the risk of the virus developing resistance is higher. Contact your doctor if your child is not able 
to swallow the entire dose when mixed with a liquid, as they may consider giving another medicine to 
treat your child.
Do not use warm (40°C and above) or carbonated beverages when taking INTELENCE tablet(s).
Removing the child resistant cap
The plastic bottle comes with a child resistant cap and should be opened as 
follows:
-
-
Push the plastic screw cap down while turning it counter clockwise.
Remove the unscrewed cap.
If you take more INTELENCE than you should
Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately. The most frequent side effects of INTELENCE are 
rash, diarrhoea, nausea, and headache (see section ‘4. Possible side effects’).
57
If you forget to take INTELENCE
If you notice within 6 hours of the time you usually take INTELENCE, you must take the tablet(s)
as soon as possible. Always take the tablet(s) following a meal. Then take the next dose as usual. If 
you notice after 6 hours, then skip the intake and take the next doses as usual. Do not take a double 
dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you vomit less than 4 hours after taking INTELENCE, take another dose following a meal. If you 
vomit more than 4 hours after taking INTELENCE, then you do not need to take another dose until 
your regularly scheduled dose.
Contact your doctor if you are uncertain about what to do if you miss a dose or vomit.
Do not stop taking INTELENCE without talking to your doctor first
HIV therapy may increase your sense of well-being. Even if you feel better, do not stop taking 
INTELENCE or your other anti-HIV medicines. Doing so could increase the risk of the virus 
developing resistance. Talk to your doctor first.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Weight and increased blood lipids and glucose
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This

Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant. Pregnant women should not take INTELENCE 
unless specifically directed by the doctor.
Because of the potential for side effects in breast-fed infants, it is recommended that women not 
breast-feed if they are receiving INTELENCE.
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should 
discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible.
Driving and using machines
Do not drive or operate machines if you feel sleepy or dizzy after taking your medicines.
INTELENCE contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium 
free’.

3.
How to take INTELENCE
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Use in adults
The recommended dose of INTELENCE is one tablet twice a day.
In the morning, take one 200 milligram INTELENCE tablet, following a meal.
In the evening, take one 200 milligram INTELENCE tablet, following a meal.
Use in children and adolescents 2 years of age and older and weighing at least 10 kg
The doctor will work out the right dose based on the weight of the child.
The doctor will inform you exactly how much INTELENCE the child should take.
Instructions for taking INTELENCE for all patients
It is important that you take INTELENCE following a meal. If you take INTELENCE on an empty 
stomach, only half the amount of INTELENCE is absorbed. Follow your doctor’s advice on the type 
of meal you should be taking with INTELENCE.
Swallow the INTELENCE tablet(s) whole with a glass of water. Do not chew the tablet(s).
If you are unable to swallow the INTELENCE tablet(s) whole, you may do the following:
-
-
-
-
-
place the tablet(s) in 5 ml (1 teaspoon) of water, or at least enough liquid to cover the 
medicine,
stir well for about 1 minute until the water looks milky,
if desired, add up to 30 ml (2 tablespoons) more of water or alternatively orange juice or 
milk (do not place the tablets directly in orange juice or milk),
drink it immediately,
rinse the glass several times with water, orange juice, or milk and completely swallow the 
rinse each time to make sure you take the entire dose.
If you mix INTELENCE tablet(s) with a liquid, take this first, before other liquid anti-HIV medicines 
that you need to take at the same time.
Contact your doctor if you are not able to swallow the entire dose when mixed with a liquid. 
If your child needs to take INTELENCE tablet(s) mixed with a liquid, it is very important that he/she 
takes the entire dose so that the right amount of medicine enters into the body. If the full dose is not 
taken, the risk of the virus developing resistance is higher. Contact your doctor if your child is not able 
to swallow the entire dose when mixed with a liquid, as they may consider giving another medicine to 
treat your child.
Do not use warm (40°C and above) or carbonated beverages when taking INTELENCE tablet(s).
Removing the child resistant cap
The plastic bottle comes with a child resistant cap and should be opened as 
follows:
-
-
Push the plastic screw cap down while turning it counter clockwise.
Remove the unscrewed cap.
If you take more INTELENCE than you should
Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately. The most frequent side effects of INTELENCE are 
rash, diarrhoea, nausea, and headache (see section ‘4. Possible side effects’).
65
If you forget to take INTELENCE
If you notice within 6 hours of the time you usually take INTELENCE, you must take the tablet as 
soon as possible. Always take the tablet following a meal. Then take the next dose as usual. If you 
notice after 6 hours, then skip the intake and take the next doses as usual. Do not take a double dose 
to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you vomit less than 4 hours after taking INTELENCE, take another dose following a meal. If you 
vomit more than 4 hours after taking INTELENCE, then you do not need to take another dose until 
your regularly scheduled dose.
Contact your doctor if you are uncertain about what to do if you miss a dose or vomit.
Do not stop taking INTELENCE without talking to your doctor first
HIV therapy may increase your sense of well-being. Even if you feel better, do not stop taking 
INTELENCE or your other anti-HIV medicines. Doing so could increase the risk of the virus 
developing resistance. Talk to your doctor first.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Etravirine (ETR) is a non-nucleoside transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) indicated, in combination with a 
boosted protease inhibitor (PI) and other antiretroviral medicinal products, for the treatment of HIV-1 
infection in antiretroviral (ARV) treatment-experienced adult and paediatric patients from 6 years of 
age. 
This extension of paediatric indication in subjects <6 years old is supported by the data from study 
TMC125-C234 (IMPAACT P1090). This study is part of the currently agreed Intelence Paediatric 
Investigation Plan (EMEA-000222-PIP01-08-M08, decision P/0163/2015 dated 7 August 2017). Week 
48 results of this study were previously assessed in March 2019 as part of the procedure 
EMEA/H/C/000900/P46/053, without further action required.  
For this extension of indication variation II/58, no new clinical study report of study TMC125-C234 was 
provided. In addition, a PopPK analysis report and an erratum of this study TMC125-C234 were 
submitted. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
No new non-clinical pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted to support the extension of 
indication in adolescent patient population, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted to support the extension of 
indication in adolescent patient population, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH did not submit an updated Environmental Risk Assessment in the initial submission for this 
variation, with the reason that this medicinal product is considered unlikely to result in any significant 
increase in the environmental concentration of the active substance. 
It can be acknowledged that target population is only expected to be marginally increased. This is 
because ETR is to be used in ARV experienced children in combination with a boosted Protease 
Inhibitor (PI), while in the newly younger age strata, NNRTI and boosted PI are more expected to be 
sequentially introduced and that vertical transmission of viral strains harbouring resistance is limited.  
However, the CHMP requested the MAH to calculate the new Predicted Environmental Concentrations 
(PEC) value for etravirine for the new target group and then, sum it to the previous PEC to reach the 
Assessment report  
EMA/175628/2020  
Page 6/86 
 
 
 
total PEC and the environmental risk assessment updated based on new PEC value. 
At the request of CHMP, the MAH provided an Environmental Risk Assessment for Etravirine paediatric 
indication (children ≥ 2 to < 6 years). 
The MAH provided an updated ERA according to the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment 
of Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP/SWP/4447/00).  In this version, the market penetration 
factor for etravirine was recalculated using the prevalence data for the indication. This resulted in 
newly calculated PECs (surface water, ground water, sediment and soil) and risk characterization ratios 
(water, sediment and soil). 
Phase I Screening for Persistence, Bioaccumulation, and Toxicity (PBT) 
The logPow calculated for etravirine in study TMC125 is 3.4, which is below 4.5, consequently, no 
screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity according to the European Chemicals Bureau 
(2003) Technical Guidance Document was performed. Etravirine does not exhibit potential for 
bioaccumulation based on logPow. 
Phase I Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration 
An estimation of the PEC of TMC125 in surface waters receiving the discharge of sewage treatment 
facilities was obtained using the following formula: 
For TMC125: DOSEai: = 400 mg/day; WASTEWinh: = 200 L (default); DILUTION: = 10 (default) 
Current WHO/ECDC data indicate that the HIV prevalence in any single EU member state does not 
exceed 0.9% (highest being Estonia) [WHO Global Health Observatory data repository, updated 
September 11, 2019]. However, the INTELENCE population including paediatric population would be a 
small part of this group since patients need to have resistance to multiple antiretroviral therapy classes 
to be eligible. Less than 10% of the HIV infected population is “highly treatment-experienced” but 
sources on this are very difficult to get due to the small size of the population. Therefore, for the 
purpose of this ERA a prevalence of 0.1% was used ((Fpen: = 1% (default) (=0.01)) which is already 
an overestimation of the population.  
PECsurfacewater of TMC125 in surface water is 0.2 µg/L. 
And PECgroundwater = 0.25 × PECsurfacewater = 0.05 μg/L 
Calculation of PNECwater, PNECmicroorganisms, PNECgroundwater 
The PNECwater was based on the lowest NOEC result from the long-term toxicity tests; PNECmicroorganism 
is based on the NOEC result of the microbial effect study and the PNECgroundwater is based on the NOEC 
result of the acute toxicity test with Daphnia magna.  
The PNECsediment for TMC125 is based on the NOEC from the 28 days toxicity test with Chironomus 
riparius. As the NOEC from the 28 days toxicity test with Chironomus riparius is > 20 μg/L, the 
PNECsediment is > 0.2 μg/L. 
For stuvy TMC125: 
PNECwater = 0.49 μg/L 
PNECgroundwater = 0.91 μg/L  
PNECmicroorganisms = 100 mg/L = 100000 μg/L 
Assessment report  
EMA/175628/2020  
Page 7/86 
 
 
 
 
PNECsediment > 0.2 μg/L 
Calculation PEC/PNEC ratios 
PECsurfacewater/PNECwater = 0.2 μg/L / 0.49 μg/L= 0.41 
Consequently, further testing in the aquatic compartment is not necessary and it can be concluded that 
TMC125 and/or its metabolites are unlikely to represent a risk to the aquatic environment. 
PECgroundwater/PNECgroundwater = 0.05 μg/L / 0.91 μg/L= 0.055 
The ratio PECgroundwater/PNECgroundwater is below 1. Consequently, further evaluation on the fate of 
TMC125 and/or its metabolites in the aquatic environment is not needed. 
PECsurfacewater/PNECmicroorganisms = 0.2 μg/L / 100 mg/L= 0.2 x 10-5 
The ratio PECsurfacewater/PNECmicroorganisms is below 0.1. Consequently, further evaluation of the fate and 
effects of TMC125 on microorganisms is not required. 
PECsurfacewater/PNECsediment = 0.2 μg/L / > 0.2 μg/L < 1 The risk ratio PECsediment/PNECsediment is below 1. 
Consequently, further testing in the sediment compartment is not necessary and it can be concluded 
that TMC125 and/or its metabolites are unlikely to represent a risk to the sediment compartment.

Potential to Bioaccumulate 
The kinetic BCF values were 370.1 for the low dose and 530.9 for the high dose. These BCFk values 
are below 1000 indicating that TMC125 does not bioaccumulate in fish. 
Affinity to Bind to Sewage Sludge 
The adsorption/desorption coefficient (Koc) for TMC125 is 16617 kg/L, which is higher than the limit 
value of 10000 kg/L, indicating that ETR has a high affinity to bind to sewage sludge in the sewage 
treatment plant. Consequently, an environmental assessment in the terrestrial compartment was 
conducted. 
For TMC125, PECsludge was calculated as: 
Type (i) STP = 0.413 mg/kg dry sludge (combined sludge, i.e., primary + surplus sludge); 
Type (ii) STP = 0.503 mg/kg dry sludge (surplus sludge). 
PECsoil of TMC125 in soil after the first sludge application is: PECsoil (1) = = 0.00074 mg/kg soil. 
According to the TGD, a realistic worst-case assumption for exposure should be considered assuming 
that sludge application takes place for ten consecutive years. For this calculation, the fraction of active 
substance that remains in the top soil layer at the end of each application year has to be calculated 
using the formula: 
Assessment report  
EMA/175628/2020  
Page 8/86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Facc = e-365 k, where k is a first order rate constant for removal from top soil: 
The yearly accumulation fraction of TMC125 in soil is Facc = 0.65 
Finally, the initial concentration of TMC125 in the top-soil layer after ten applications of sludge is given 
by: 
And PECsoil (10) = 0.0021 mg/kg soil. 
The calculation of PNECsoil is based on the lowest NOEC result from the long-term toxicity tests, i.e., 
76 mg/kg dry soil for terrestrial plants. 
PNECsoil = 7.6 mg/kg soil 
Lastly, the PECsoil/PNECsoil = 0.0021 mg/kg / 7.6 mg/kg = 0.3 × 10-3 
The ratio PECsoil/PNECsoil is below 1. Consequently, further testing in the terrestrial compartment is 
not necessary. In accordance with EMEA Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use, TMC125 and/or its metabolites are considered unlikely to represent a risk to 
the terrestrial compartment following prescribed usage in patients. 
2.2.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The justification provided by the applicant for the ERA exemption was not acceptable by the CHMP, as 
no reliable data were included to show that an increase in the environmental concentration of the 
active substance was not expected.  
At the request of the CHMP, the MAH submitted an updated Environmental Risk Assessment for this 
extension of indication. The PEC/PNEC ratios remain below 1.0 and 0.1 for surface water/ 
groundwater/ sediment and microorganism respectively.  
Etravirine does not exhibit potential for bioaccumulation based on logPow. It doesn’t bioaccumulate in 
fish. 
The calculated adsorption/desorption coefficient (Koc) for TMC125 was 16617 kg/L, higher than the 
limit value of 10000 kg/L. the MAH conducted an environmental assessment of TMC125 in the 
terrestrial compartment. 
The ratio PECsoil/PNECsoil remains below 1, therefore, etravirine and its metabolites are considered 
unlikely to represent a risk to the terrestrial compartment. 
2.2.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the extended indication does not lead to a 
significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of Etravirine.  
Considering the above data, etravirine is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In the European Union (EU), INTELENCE, in combination with a boosted protease inhibitor (PI) and 
other antiretroviral (ARV) medicinal products, is indicated for the treatment of HIV infection in 
antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced adult patients and in ART-experienced paediatric patients 
from 6 years of age. The recommended dose of ETR for paediatric patients aged ≥6 years to <18 
years and weighing ≥16 kg is based on body weight (see Table 2):

An application for the extension of the indication in HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects aged ≥2 to <6 
years was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2018, based on the Week-24 
analysis of Study TMC125-C234. Of note, the purpose of this EU type II variation is to extend to the 
same target population on the basis of the 48 weeks data of this study. 
GCP 
The clinical trial TMC125-C234 was performed in accordance with the ethical principles that have their 
origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent with Good Clinical Practices and applicable 
regulatory requirements, as claimed by the applicant.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Extensions of indication to include paediatric population for antiretroviral agents are primarily based on 
demonstration of comparable exposure in children vs. adults.  As stated in the EMA Guideline on the 
clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infection, a specific demonstration 
of antiviral efficacy in paediatric patients is not required. As it is assumed that the PK/PD relation for a 
direct acting antiviral is roughly similar regardless of the age of the patient, the efficacy of a dose that 
yields sufficiently similar exposure in children, compared to adults, would be inferred. The parameters 
that would be applied to conclude on similarity should be based on available data from the entire 
development programme, including PK and efficacy data in adults 
Main study TMC125-C234 (P1090) 
The clinical PK, efficacy and safety data in support of this younger age paediatric extension are derived 
from an open label phase 1/2 study TMC125-234  (IMPAACT 1090) enrolling 20 subjects in Cohort I 
(aged ≥2 to <6 years) and 6 subjects in Cohort II (aged ≥1 to <2 years). Subjects were on a 
virologically-failing regimen (containing at least 3 ARV). Of note, a Cohort III (< 1 y/o) was originally 
planned but did not enrol and was closed (See Table 4).  
For more details about Clinical Efficacy of study TMC125, refer to section 2.4.1 - Main Study. 
Study design 
TMC125 is a Phase I/II, multicenter, open label 48 week study of ETR in combination with at least 2 
active agents (a boosted PI and at least one additional active drug), for treatment experienced HIV-1-

  Mini-cohort I: non-compartmental PK analysis 
At the start of the study, all subjects in the first mini-cohort (N=6, aged ≥2 to <6 years) were on an 
ETR dose of 5.2 mg/kg bid. The ETR PK parameters for this subgroup are as follows:

Of the 6 subjects in this mini-cohort, 2 subjects had an individual dose adjustment, because their ETR 
AUC12h was below 2,350 ng•h/mL (i.e., below the 10th percentile of the adult ETR AUC12h in the 
DUET studies). Both subjects were adjusted to an ETR 200 mg bid dose and thereafter had an AUC12h 
above 2,350 ng•h/mL. 
A comparison of the geometric mean ETR AUC12h in the mini-cohort with that in adults indicated that 
it was unlikely that, with this ETR dose, the geometric mean ETR exposure would be within target for 
the full cohort (see Table 7):

N: number of subjects with data 
A revision of the ETR dosing table was introduced for the remainder of the cohorts. For 2 subjects of 
the mini-cohort, based on their body weight, the newly recommended ETR dose was the same as their 
initial dose, and PK data for these subjects are included for the summary and analysis of data from 
subjects on the newly recommended dose.

N: number of subjects with data 
a One subject in Cohort II with virologic failure had ETR pre-dose concentrations below the detection limit at the 
intensive PK visit; while the C12h was 159 ng/mL, which is an indication of suboptimal adherence to ETR prior to 
the intensive PK visit, even though non-adherence was not reported. 
The mean ETR PK parameters were lower in subjects in Cohort II, compared to Cohort I. Overall, the 
inter-subject variability was large in both age cohorts. 
The statistical results comparing ETR PK parameters between children and adults (pooled DUET 
studies) are as follows (Table 9):

The mean ETR PK parameters on the recommended dose were not different between males and 
females (p=0.773).  
The mean ETR PK parameters on the recommended dose were numerically higher in black or African 
American children compared to the other race categories; however, this was not statistically significant 
(p=0.094). Similarly, by region, the mean ETR PK parameters were numerically highest in the children 
from Africa, followed by North America, and lowest in the children from South America; this was not 
statistically significant (p=0.066). The mean ETR PK parameters on the recommended dose were 
numerically higher in children with DRV/rtv as boosted PI in their regimen, compared with LPV/rtv, 
though not statistically different (p=0.612).  
The mean ETR PK parameters on the recommended dose were statistically higher in children 
who swallowed the tablets whole compared to those who took the tablets dispersed in liquid 
(p<0.001). It should be noted that there were only 4 children with intensive PK on the recommended 
ETR dose who swallowed the tablet whole. 
  PK/PD relationships 
There was no clear relationship between the ETR PK (steady-state PK for each subject at the intensive 
PK visit) and virologic response (viral load <400 c/ml at Week 48 with FDA snapshot approach; PDVF). 
The ranges of ETR exposures in subjects with or without virologic response largely overlapped. Also for 
the ETR PK parameter quartile PK/PD analysis (FDA Snapshot, TLOVR), there was no clear trend for a 
PK/PD relationship.

One subject in Cohort II with virologic failure had ETR pre-dose concentrations below the detection 
limit at the intensive PK visit; while the C12h was 159 ng/mL, which is an indication of suboptimal 
adherence to ETR prior to the intensive PK visit even though non-adherence was not reported. 
No clear relationship was observed between ETR PK and the occurrence of selected AEs of interest. 
  ETR population PK analysis 
The  main  objective  of  the  current  analysis  is  to  confirm  that  the  dosing  regimens  selected  for  the 
administration of ETR to children below 6 years of age that would result in an exposure comparable to 
that observed in adults. 
DATA 
For  this  analysis,  all  the  available  rich  and  sparse  PK  data  obtained  from  the  P1090  study  (Week  48 
analysis cut-off date July 12, 2018) were added to existing data from historical paediatric studies. These 
historical data consisted of richly sampled PK data collected from children (≥6 to <18 years) in TMC125-
C1262 and sparsely sampled PK data collected from children (≥6 to <18 years) in TMC125-C2133. The 
studies included in the NONMEM data file are summarized in Table 11.

After data exploration of the pooled dataset, selected complete subject’s (ID) data were excluded as the 
data resulted in an incomplete pharmacokinetic-time profile. Additionally, some occasion data for several 
subjects  (OID)  were  excluded  from  the  pooled  dataset  as  they  were  not  in  line  with  other  data.    In 
addition, some (4) subjects had inconsistent data across their entire concentration-time profile and were 
excluded. Individual data from one subject  were excluded as the subject’s data resulted in a very low 
exposure (~4% of target AUC), as this subject suffered from diarrhoea on the days before and the day 
of the pharmacokinetic sampling and, in addition, there were uncertainties regarding the conditions of 
collection/storage of PK samples for this subject.

METHODS 
A paediatric population PK model for ETR was previously established and was used as a starting model 
for this analysis. This prior model consists of a one-compartment model with a zero-order input into the 
depot compartment, after a lag time, followed by a first-order absorption process from depot to central 
compartment,  and  a  first  order  elimination.  The  parameter  estimates  are  shown  in  Table  13.  Inter-
individual variability (IIV) was introduced on the apparent clearance CL/F, apparent central volume V/F 
and absorption rate KA. Weight (WT) was included as a covariate on both CL/F and V/F as presented in 
Table 13.

The  prior  population  PK  model  was  used  as  a  starting  point  for  the  current  analysis.  Based  on  the 
empirical Bayesian estimates of pharmacokinetic model parameters, the P1090 subjects were estimated, 
the  model  was  then  to  be  reparametrized  before  further  model  development.  All  analyses  were 
performed using NONMEM version 7.4.1 with an Intel® Fortran 64 compiler Version 11.1. Data handling, 
graphical evaluations and data simulations were done using R version 3.3.3. 
All models were fitted on the logarithmically transformed data with the additive residual error model, 
using the First Order Conditional Estimation (FOCE) method. During model selection, this estimation step 
was followed by the importance sampling IMP step to improve the estimations of the Objective Function 
Value (OFV). Graphical techniques were used to assess the fit of the model to the data. 
Since the main objective is to confirm the recommended ETR dose selected for the paediatric population, 
the only additional continuous covariate investigated was AGE, as WT was already present in the model 
through the allometric scaling model. Age effects were empirically introduced using the function:

In  addition,  categorical  covariates  mode  of  drug  administration  (FORM:  tablets  swallowed  whole  or 
dispersed) and study (STU) were investigated by addition of the covariate to the model using additional 
fixed effects for the groups of interest. 
To capture differences between the sparse sampling data and the multiple rich PK profiles of the P1090 
subjects, inter-occasion variability (IOV) was introduced. 
Evaluation of the proposed ETR dosing regimen was performed by estimating the probability that the 
typical exposure/AUC lies in the target range (80% to 150% of the geometric mean adult AUC). This 
was  evaluated  across  the  weight  and  dose  range  of  interest,  ie,  5  to  35  kg  and  25  to  200  mg  bid, 
respectively. To this end, the standard error (SE) of the AUC estimate (ie, the extent to which the AUC 
estimate is likely to deviate from the true AUC) had to be derived. Since the AUC is not directly estimated 
in the model, the SE of the AUC predictions were obtained as follows. First, a thousand parameter values 
are sampled form the parameter uncertainty distribution. Next, using the final model (Figures Section 
4), the model predicted AUC at steady state for a given dose (DOSE) and weight (WT) is given by: 
Finally, using these expected values and SEs the probability of the true AUC being in the target 80%-
150% range of the adult AUC can be derived, for any dose and any weight, as: 
RESULTS 
Graphical evaluation of the PRIOR model revealed significant bias in the population predicted exposures 
for  P1090  data  compared  to  data  from  the  original  dataset  (TMC125-C213,  TMC125-C126)  and 
significant trends in the normalized random effects of both CL/F and V/F with respect to the covariates 
of interest, WT and AGE (nest Figures), suggesting a strong correlation between the covariate effect on 
CL/F and V/F.

the 95% CI of the linear regression line. Apparent distortions are due to the log scaling of the x-axis. 
To  model  this  combined  covariate  effect  on  both  CL/F  and  V/F  the  PRIOR  model  was  reparametrized 
such that the IIV on V/F was moved to F1 while keeping the typical value of F1=1. It is important to 
note  that,  given  the  lack  of  IV  data,  the  absolute  oral  bioavailability  remains  undetermined  and  the 
reported values of F1 should thus not be interpreted as such. Moreover, although intuitively attractive, 
the IIV on F1 is not a ‘pure’ estimate of IIV on the  relative oral bioavailability as it also captures the 
correlations among apparent parameters CL/F and V/F. 
The explored hypotheses around the trends observed on the random effects on F1 were that these could 
be due to differences in the mode of drug administration (tablets swallowed whole for nearly all subjects 
in  TMC125-C213  and  TMC125-C126,  and  dispersed  tablets  for  the  majority  of  subjects  in  the  P1090 
study), the subject’s age, or the study itself. The model was thus refitted by including each covariate

separately, however, none of the models proved to be significantly better than the others (based on the 
OFV, in next table).  
Table 14: Run Record for Development of the Base Model 
Since within the age range of the current analysis dataset, the potential age-related differences are not 
likely  to  be  due  to  the  maturation  of  CYP  enzymes,  the  study  or  mode  of  administration  are  more 
plausible  causes  for  the  observed  trends.  A  prior  relative  bioavailability  study  revealed  no  significant 
differences  in  the  absorption  of  ETR  when  dispersed  compared  to  swallowed  whole  (TMC125-C173). 
However, challenges associated with the administration of drugs to the younger age group suggest that 
they may not always ingest the full ETR dose. Consequently, the effect of mode of administration was 
incorporated  in  the  model  as  it  is  more  likely  to  explain  the  observed  differences  that  were  initially 
attributed to age. The final model thus includes mode of administration (as observed in the P1090 study) 
as  an  effect  on  F1.  As  a  result  (next  Figures),  no  further  significant  age  or  weight  effects  could  be 
detected on the random effects of the model parameters.

DOSE SELECTION AND REGIMEN 
The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the proposed ETR dosing regimen in the context of population PK 
modelling, which was done in three steps. For this, it is assumed that the ETR dose is fully administered, 
i.e., F1=1. 
First the model predicted typical clearance, along with the 95% confidence interval, is evaluated over 
the  weight  range  of  interest  and  overlaid  with  the  individual  (post-hoc)  clearance  estimates  along  a 
smoother through those. Although borderline at the lowest bodyweights (corresponding to data from the 
children  with  the  lower  ages  <2  years),  overall  there  do  not  seem  to  be  any  significant  deviations 
between the population and post-hoc estimations of the expected (mean) clearance.

95%CI of the model-predicted CL and the post-hoc estimate of expected CL as function of WT (loess smoother). 
Second, as shown in Figure 4, for any DOSE and WT combination (assuming F1=1) one can derive the 
estimated AUC, evaluate the extent by which the true AUC is likely to deviate from the estimate and 
thus how likely the true AUC will fall in the target range (which is denoted as the confidence level as 
boils down to an integration over the same distribution used to derive the confidence interval).

Figure 10: CL vs Weight with confidence interval 
Left Panel: Contour plot. Ranges in between the black solid lines represent the confidence level that the AUC12h 
for the given ETR dose (represented by the colored horizontal lines) would be within 80% to 150% of that in 
adults. The black dots represent observed WT for subjects in the TMC125-C234 study. 
Right Panel: The solid colored lines represent the mean predicted AUC12h for the given ETR bid dose by body 
weight; the shaded area represents the 90% prediction interval. The horizontal lines represent the mean (solid

the adult AUC12h. The red line in the lower part of the right panel represents the expected fraction of subjects 
below the ‘Min’. 
For doses already in the approved ETR prescribing information, the confidence level of e.g., a 150 mg 
dose given to patients between 25 kg and 30 kg is above 90% so it is very likely that the average AUC 
will fall within the target range with values slightly higher than the geometric mean adult AUC. Evaluating 
the ETR recommended dose regimen as per P1090 study (Table 1) across the weight range indicates 
that confidence levels above 90% are reached across the entire weight range except between 10 and 
11.5 kg (Table 15).

Finally, for the third step of the dose recommendation, i.e., evaluating the expected AUC range across 
the population including IIV, the 90% prediction interval as well as the 10th percentile of the AUC for 
the prosed ETR dose regimen was evaluated across the weight range of interest (Figure 4, right panel). 
From this, it is apparent that the likelihood of under-dosing becomes low as the doses selected were 
confirmed to provide an exposure similar or higher than the typical expo sure for adults and the 10% 
lower bound of the prediction interval rises well above the 10th  percentile of the exposures observed in 
adults (2350 ng.h/mL). These simulations assumed full administration of the ETR dose (F1=1, i.e., no 
difference  in  bioavailability  between  dispersed  or  swallowed  whole).  Thus,  seemingly  omitting  the

deviations  in  F1  (driven  by  mode  of  administration)  included  in  the  final  model.  A  difference  in 
bioavailability  related  to  suboptimal  or  incomplete  intake  of  the  ETR  dose  should  however  not  be 
accounted for by an increase in the recommended dose, as that would lead to higher than anticipated 
ETR exposures in children that do take the complete ETR dose. One could estimate the exposures of the 
(potentially  incomplete)  dispersed  administration  (assuming  F1=63%,  Figure  11).  The  exact  F1  is 
however  difficult  to  predict,  and  it  is  anticipated  that  incomplete  dose  intake  is  mostly  a  problem  for 
younger children, which are on the low end of the body weight range.

The solid colored lines represent the mean predicted AUC12h (assuming F=63%) for the given ETR bid dose by 
body weight; the shaded area represents the 90% prediction interval. The horizontal lines represent the mean 
(solid line) AUC12h in adults with the 80% to 150% range (dotted lines) and the ‘Min’ represents the 10th 
percentile of the adult AUC12h. The red line in the lower part of the figure represents the expected fraction (25% 
indicates ≥25%) of subjects below the ‘Min’. 
CONCLUSION 
The analysis confirms that the ETR recommended doses (as per P1090 protocol version 4.0) would result 
in  comparable  exposures  to  adults,  and,  therefore,  no  significant  alterations  to  the  dosing  regimen 
described in the protocol are deemed necessary. Given the limited data for low weights, this analysis 
should be used with caution for the weight band <8 kg.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In order to propose an appropriate ETR dose for children aged ≥2 to <6 years, new clinical 
pharmacology data obtained on week 48 of an ongoing open-label Phase 1/2 clinical study (TMC125-
C234) was provided. This study intended to evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of ETR in 
combination with an optimized background regimen (OBR) in HIV-1 infected children aged from ≥2 
months to <6 years. 
A validated analytical method, with slight changes in the linearity limits over time, was used. At the 
request of the CHMP, the applicant provided the ISR analysis that was undertaken. The total number of 
analysed samples were 367. The ISR analysis included only 30 samples from Study P1090, slightly 
below the required 10% of study samples. However, results shown that 96% (29 of 30) of the 
reanalysis were within the acceptance value of 20%. In this case, even if extra 7 samples were 
included with negative results, the percentage of correct values would still be above the required ones.  
The clinical study was divided in two cohorts. Initially, all subjects from 2 to <6 years of age were 
treated with ETR 5.2 mg/kg BID for all body weights. However, according to the protocol, a failure to 
meet the safety and/or PK criteria would result in an adjustment of the (starting) dose.  
The mean ETR exposure (AUC and Cmin) was significantly lower for the first 6 patients included in the 
mini-cohort I. Notably, 2 subjects required individual dose adjustment because their ETR AUC12h was 
below 2,350 ng.h/ml. Following the protocol, the evaluation of the mini cohort data resulted in 
improved dose adjustment with different target dose per weight band. 
The MAH proposed to increase ETR dose for subjects weighing <16 kg (6.8 mg/kg BID for subjects 13-
<16 kg, and 8.8 mg/kg BID for subjects <13 kg). This dose adjustment for the lower weight ranges 
was supported by the population PK analysis and intensive PK analysis in subjects receiving the 
recommended dose of ETR. After that, the geometric mean ETR AUC12h for subjects aged ≥2 to <6 
years (Cohort I, N=15) was within the target of 60% to 150% of the geometric mean ETR AUC12h in 
adults.  (See Table 16)

Therefore, ETR exposure observed in subjects from 2 to 6 years old receiving the recommended doses 
are close to those observed in older paediatric subjects treated with the approved ETR dose. The same 
conclusion cannot apply for subjects <2 years old, based on these PK data but also from efficacy data. 
As regards the PK values observed in Cohort I, the number of subjects is low, especially subjects in the 
lower weight range (3 subjects in the 10-<13kg weight range, see baseline data in Section 2.4.1 Main 
Study). This was considered more worrying that PK data in Cohort II, as it speaks in favour of a 
potential inadequate ETR dose, with subexposure and increased risk of virologic failure. In Cohort II, 
the 6 subjects weighted between 8 to 12 kg at baseline (including 3 subjects in the weight range 10-
<13 kg). When focusing on the 3 subjects from Cohort II in this weight range (i.e. the heaviest 
children of this cohort), 2 of them had adequate ETR exposure and 1 subject had suboptimal 
adherence.  
In Cohort I, it is noted that 6 subjects have received a higher-than-recommended ETR dose according 
to individual PK results, because the exposure (AUC12h) on their initial ETR dose was below the 10th 
percentile of the adult exposure. This dose adjustment was not well described in the report, and it was 
not clear how and how much were the dose increased for each individual case  
Upon request of the CHMP, the MAH provided the links to the relevant parts of the report describing 
the dose adjustments on the 5 subjects of Cohort I. The dose adjustments and the reason for dose 
adjustment (i.e., change in body weight, low exposure or other) were clarified by the MAH, with the 
reason of being a Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) dose adjustment. 
Table 18 summarizes the doses and corresponding exposures (AUC12h) for subjects in Cohort I and 
Cohort II who received a dose adjustment, because the exposure (AUC12h) on their initial ETR dose 
was below the 10th percentile of AUC12h in adults.

Regarding the PopPK analysis, a prior model was initially used. However, graphical evaluation of the 
PRIOR model revealed significant bias in the population predicted exposures for P1090 data compared 
to data from the original dataset (TMC125-C213, TMC125-C126). As such, since weight was already 
included in the model, the effect of age, mode of administration and study were further investigated, 
and the final model included the mode of administration (as observed in the P1090 study) as an effect 
on Bioavailability.  
This model seemed appropriate for the purpose, with acceptable goodness of fit plots and parameter 
estimates. However, the CHMP requested the applicant to provide visual predictive checks (VPCs) plots 
by study and cohort (in study P1090), as well as the parameters evaluation by bootstrapping for 
further assessment of the model quality. 
Upon request of the CHMP, the MAH presented VPCs for studies TMS125-C234, TMC125-C213, and 
TMC125-C234 (Figure 12):

Figure 12: Visual Predictive Checks-Observed ETR Plasma Concentrations for Studies 
TMC125-C126, TMC125-C213 and TMC125-234 (Paediatrics) 
The observed ETR plasma concentrations are represented by blue circles. 
The solid red line represents the median observed ETR plasma concentration, and the semitransparent red area 
represents a simulation-based 95% confidence interval for the median. 
The observed 5% and 95% percentiles are presented with dashed red lines, and the 95% confidence intervals for 
the corresponding model predicted percentiles are shown as semitransparent blue areas. 
Figure 12 indicates that the observed ETR plasma concentrations for the three studies are within the 
predictions of the popPK model. For Cohort II of Study TMC12 5-C234, the observed ETR plasma 
concentrations are on the low side of the predictions. However, INTELENCE is not indicated for 
subjects aged ≥1 to <2 years or <10 kg. In addition, intake issues reported in Cohort II may have 
contributed to the lower observed values. 
In addition, the bootstrap results also confirmed the adequacy of the estimated Theta’s and Omega’s 
(see tables in Figure 13) for the intended use and population.

Based on this model, and assuming a F1 of 1, evaluation of the ETR recommended dose regimen as 
per P1090 study across the weight range indicates that confidence levels above 90% are reached 
across the entire weight range except between 10 and 11.5 kg. In addition, the likelihood of under-
dosing becomes low as the doses selected were confirmed to provide an exposure similar or higher 
than the typical expo sure for adults and the 10% lower bound of the prediction interval rises well 
above the 10th   percentile of the exposures observed in adults (2350 ng.h/mL). However, this is not 
the case when considering a suboptimal or incomplete intake of the ETR dose. In this case, and 
assuming a F1=63% (related to the administration as dispersed tablets), the number of expected 
subjects below the 10th percentile of the exposures observed in adults (2350 ng.h/mL) was higher than 
25% in all weight classes.

Based on the popPK model, and after accounting for the allometric effect of weight for children, no 
significant effect of age could be identified. This seems acceptable, as no special maturation effect is 
expected for the ≥2 to <6 years age band. The ETR dose recommendations are, thus, specified by 
weight-band. The race and region effects on the PK of ETR were all non-significant, in line to what was 
already described for adults. Finally, no statistically significant differences were observed in the PK of 
ETR by different combinations of OBR (rtv-boosted atazanavir, rtv-boosted DRV or rtv-boosted LPV). 
This goes in line with the described lack of effect for adults in similar situation, as described in the 
SmPC. 
The CHMP raised the issue that the mean ETR PK parameters on the recommended dose were 
statistically higher in children who swallowed the tablets whole compared to those who took the tablets 
dispersed in liquid (p<0.001). It should be noted that there were only 4 children with intensive PK on 
the recommended ETR dose who swallowed the tablet whole. 
The CHMP requested the MAH to provide further analysis of the adequacy of the formulation for the 
younger population. This topic is discussed below in Section 2.4.2 – Discussion on clinical efficacy 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, based on the available PK data, the proposed ETR may allow to achieve adequate ETR 
exposure for subjects between 2 to 6 years old and weighing at least 10 kg, having in mind that 
adherence is a crucial parameter.  
The  PopPK  analysis  confirmed  that  the  ETR  recommended  doses  (as  per  P1090  protocol  version  4.0) 
would result in comparable exposures to adults, and, therefore, no significant alterations to the dosing 
regimen described in the protocol are deemed necessary. Given the limited data for low weights, this 
analysis should be used with caution for the weight band <8 kg.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Study TMC125-C234 (IMPAACT P1090) 
Study TMC125-C234 (IMPAACT P1090) is a Phase 1/2 study which evaluates the pharmacokinetics, 
safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of ETR in HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects aged 2 months to 
<6 years who were on a virologically failing ARV regimen (containing ≥3 ARVs) for at least 8 weeks or 
on a treatment interruption of at least 4 weeks with a history of virologic failure while on a combination 
ARV regimen (containing ≥3 ARVs). The main results from the Week-48 of this study are summarized 
in this document.

1. Subjects below 6 months of age will only be enrolled upon availability of initial safety and PK data from 
subjects between 6 months and 1 year of age. 
Each cohort was to begin enrolment into an initial mini cohort of 6 subjects. Once the PK and safety 
data were found to be acceptable (as defined per protocol), enrolment was to be continued at the 
same ETR dose to complete enrolment of the remaining subjects in that age cohort (for Cohort I: at 
least 12 subjects), and the mini-cohort of the next age cohort was to be opened for enrolment. 
Subjects in the specific cohort were to continue their treatment at the selected dose, with the aim to 
have at least 12 evaluable subjects whose initial dose was the final recommended ETR dose for their 
age cohort according to PK and safety criteria. 
A dose of ETR was considered acceptable if the dose was tolerated (based on the safety criteria) and if 
the geometric mean ETR AUC12h was between 60% and 150% of the geometric mean ETR AUC12h in 
HIV-1 infected, ART-experienced adults from the DUET studies (ie, between 2,713 and 6,783 
ng*h/mL). 
A failure to meet the safety and/or PK criteria would result in an adjustment of the (starting) dose. 
Subjects already in the (mini-)cohort were to be adjusted to the newly recommended ETR dose if the 
investigator and protocol team believed this was in the best interest of the subject. 
In addition, subjects could have an individual ETR dose adjustment, based on their individual ETR 
exposure (AUC12h) compared with the adult AUC12h from the DUET studies (ie, the individual ETR 
AUC12h should be >2,350 ng*h/mL, the 10th percentile of the ETR AUC12h in HIV-1 infected adults).

At the start of the study, all subjects in the first mini cohort (n=6, aged ≥2 to <6 years) were on an 
ETR dose of 5.2 mg/kg bid. A comparison of the geometric mean ETR AUC12h in the mini cohort with 
that in adults indicated that it was unlikely that with this ETR dose (5.2 mg/kg bid for all bodyweights), 
the geometric mean ETR exposure would be within target for the full cohort. A revision of the ETR 
dosing table was therefore introduced for the remainder of the cohorts as presented below: (see Table 
20).

The study consists of a 48-week treatment period with an early study discontinuation visit for subjects 
who prematurely discontinued, a 4-week follow-up visit for the subjects who discontinued ETR, and a 
long-term safety follow-up of up to 5 years for the subjects continuing to receive study-provided ETR. 
In March 2016 the study protocol was amended by IMPAACT to align with the requirements described 
in the paediatric investigation plan (PIP) (Decision P/0163/2015) and hence offer the possibility of 
opening of Cohort III, based on available PK and safety data to ongoing participants, while the first 
mini-cohort of Cohort II may still be enrolling. This amendment also included a study “go/no-go 
decision point” which was set 2 years after opening of Cohort II in order to determine whether, based 
on the examination of accrual rate and all of the relevant safety and pharmacokinetic data, it would be 
safe and worth to continue the study in an attempt to find an optimal dose for Cohorts II and III. 
On 2 October 2017 (2 years after opening of Cohort II), in line with the study protocol, IMPAACT and 
the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) jointly decided to close enrolment in the study. Cohort I had 
been fully enrolled (N=20), as well as Cohort II (N=6 in the mini-cohort). No patients had been 
enrolled in Cohort III, as investigators preferred to continue to enroll sequentially. At the decision 
point, it was deemed unlikely to find subjects for mini-cohort III in a reasonable timeframe and the 
total of 26 subjects enrolled in the study was considered sufficient to fulfil the PIP requirements and 
allows a PK and clinical analysis to assess the dose of ETR to be used in HIV-1 infected children aged 
<6 years. 
Results are available from the Week-48 analysis of Study TMC125-C234, which includes all available 
PK, safety, efficacy, and resistance data from Cohort I (N=20) and Cohort II (N=6) up to the cut-off 
date of 12 July 2018.

ETR tablets should be swallowed whole with enough water or other liquid within 30 minutes following a 
meal. Subjects unable to swallow the tablets whole may disperse the tablets in a container with a 
minimum of 5 mL (1 teaspoon) of water. One minute should be allowed for the tablet(s) to be 
dispersed, stirring will aid in the dispersion. The dispersed tablet(s) in water may be further diluted 
with a beverage (see list below) not to exceed 30 mL (2 tablespoons) total volume. The 
recommendation for administration to infants is to disperse the tablet in approximately 10 mL of liquid 
(e.g. formula or milk). 
Darunavir 100 mg/mL suspension, darunavir 75 mg tablets, and darunavir 150 mg tablets, will be 
provided through the study if not reasonably available locally. 
Objectives 
Primary Objectives: 
- To evaluate the steady state pharmacokinetics of ETR in combination with an OBR in HIV-infected 
children aged ≥ 2 months to < 6 years. 
- To determine the safety and tolerability of ETR in combination with an OBR in children aged ≥ 2 
months to < 6 years, through 48 weeks of therapy. 
- To determine the appropriate dose of ETR in combination of an OBR for children aged ≥ 2 months to 
< 6 years. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoints: 
- Toxicity Endpoints: Termination from treatment due to a suspected adverse drug reaction (SADR); 
Adverse events of Grade 3 or higher severity; Death 
- Pharmacokinetic Endpoint: Failure to meet PK targets: The target geometric mean ETR AUC12h for 
this study is between 60% and 150% of the geometric mean AUC12h observed in HIV-1-infected 
treatment-experienced adults from the DUET studies (i.e. between 2713 and 6783 ng•h/mL). For the 
individual subject management in this study, subjects with an individual AUC12h below the 10th 
percentile of adult exposure (i.e. <2350 ng•h/mL) will be dose-adjusted in order to meet an AUC12h ≥ 
2350 ng•h/mL. 
The key efficacy endpoint was defined as the number and percentage of subjects with plasma viral 
load <400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL at Week 48 using the FDA Snapshot approach. 
Sample size 
The sample size for this study was estimated using a PK modelling and simulation approach. A 
minimum of 12 subjects in each age cohort was deemed sufficient to assess the ETR PK with sufficient 
precision and to evaluate the safety of ETR in paediatric subjects

Blinding (masking) 
Study TMC125-C234 was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
The following analyses to be performed by Janssen R&D are planned in the protocol: 
- When at least 12 evaluable subjects in Cohort I have completed the Week-24 assessments or 
discontinued earlier. 
- When at least 12 evaluable subjects in Cohort I have completed the Week-48 assessments or 
discontinued earlier (current analysis). 
- When at least 18 subjects across the age cohorts have completed the Week-48 assessments or 
discontinued earlier (current analysis). 
In addition, a complete data analysis will be performed when the last subject has completed the 5-year 
follow-up period or discontinued earlier. 
Considering the possibility to adjust ETR dose according to individual PK and safety data, the following 
analysis populations were considered: 
- Intent-to-treat (ITT) population or population ii: All subjects who had taken at least 1 dose of ETR. 
- Subset i: Subjects throughout on the recommended ETR dose. These subjects started on the 
recommended ETR dose and remained on this dose. These subjects had no individual PK-determined 
dose adjustment. 
- Subset i+a: Subjects on the recommended ETR dose or lower. These subjects started on any ETR 
dose and had no subsequent individual PK-determined dose adjustment. This population includes 
subset i and subset a. Subset a consists of subjects who started on an ETR dose other than 
recommended, all of which had an ETR dose lower than the recommended dose. 
- Subset i+b: Subjects on the recommended ETR dose or higher. These subjects started on the 
recommended ETR dose, with or without a subsequent individual PK-determined dose adjustment. This 
subset includes subset i and subset b, the latter consisting of subjects who started on the 
recommended ETR dose and had individual PK-determined dose adjustments, all of which resulted in a 
higher ETR dose. 
Efficacy data were analysed for the ITT population and for subjects who received the recommended 
ETR dose throughout the study (subset i). Resistance data were analysed for the ITT population. 
Subgroup analyses for efficacy and resistance were performed on the ITT population. 
Results 
Participant flow/Recruitment 
The study is being conducted at multiple sites in Brazil (5 sites; 9 subjects enrolled), the United States 
(US) (4 sites; 4 subjects enrolled), and South Africa (2 sites; 13 subjects enrolled). One site in 
Thailand screened subjects, however, none of these subjects were enrolled in the study. 
At the time of the cut-off date for the Week-48 analysis (12 July 2018), 41 subjects had been screened 
and 26 subjects had been enrolled and received at least one dose of ETR (ITT population): 20 subjects

in Cohort I (≥2 to <6 years) and 6 subjects in Cohort II (≥1 to <2 years) (See Table 23). In total, 15 
subjects (11 subjects in Cohort I, 4 subjects in Cohort II) received the recommended ETR dose 
throughout the study (subset i). The number of subjects in the other subsets is shown in Table 2. See 
Table 3 for a detailed breakdown of the different subject populations based on ETR dose.

In addition to the subjects included in the different subsets described in this table, 1 subject in 
the ITT population in the first mini-cohort) started on a lower ETR dose than the recommended 
dose and then received a higher ETR dose than the recommended dose, due to an individual PK-
determined dose adjustment. 
b   Note that one of these subjects was included in the first mini-cohort I and, based on body weight, 
the initial dose was the same as the recommended ETR dose. Therefore, this subject is included 
in subset i. 
c  Note that one of these subjects was included in the first mini-cohort I and, based on body weight, 
the initial dose received was the same as the recommended ETR dose. This subject subsequently 
had a dose increase based on individual PK results. Therefore, this subject is included in subset b.

- Toxicity: 1 SAE (grade 4 lipase increase) (ETR discontinued on Day 16 [Analysis Time Point Week 2]; 
Cohort I). 
- Clinical events or progression: 1 subject discontinued from the study due to virologic failure (ETR 
discontinued on Day 106 [Analysis Time Point Week 16]; Cohort II); and 1 subject had virologic failure 
and genotyping test revealing a high level of resistance to ETR (ETR discontinued on Day 170 [Analysis 
Time Point Week 24]; Cohort I).

discontinuation because subject developed resistance (ETR discontinued on Day 400 [Analysis Time 
Point Week 60]; Cohort II); and 1 subject met protocol-defined objective (virologic failure due to non-
adherence) requiring termination from the study (ETR discontinued on Day 770 [Analysis Time Point 
Week 108]; Cohort I). 
- Protocol compliance: subject non-compliance with medication intake and clinic visits as defined by 
protocol (ETR discontinued on Day 479 [Analysis Time Point Week 72]; Cohort I). 
- Subject/parent/guardian/physician requested discontinuation of treatment: 1 subject/parent/legal 
guardian withdrew consent for all further study contact prior to completion of the protocol-defined 
study evaluations through 5 years of follow-up (ETR discontinued on Day 1,518 [Analysis Time Point 
Week 216]; Cohort I).

Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was issued on 17 October 2011. There were 4 amendments to the protocol: 
- The first amendment (14 December 2012) was issued to remove Cohorts IIB and IIIB (≥2-
month to <2-year old treatment-naïve children, with or without exposure to ARVs as part of 
a regimen to prevent mother-to-child transmission). Consequently, the number of cohorts was 
changed from 5 to 3, the sample size was updated from 80 to 50 subjects, and stratification by ARV 
exposure was deleted. This amendment was adopted before any study-related procedures had begun. 
- The second amendment (04 October 2013) was issued to revise the PK criteria for 
individual and cohort dose evaluations and adjustments. In order to meet the PK criteria, at 
least 10 of 12 subjects per cohort were to have an AUC12h >2,350 ng*h/mL (>10th percentile of the 
adult AUC12h in the DUET studies) and a geometric mean AUC12h in the cohort to fall within 80% 
to 130% of the geometric mean AUC12h in adults (ie, between 3,618 and 5,879 ng*h/mL). 
For individual PK-determined dose adjustments, a stepwise approach was introduced aimed at 
obtaining an ETR AUC12h around the 20th percentile of the adult AUC12h (instead of the median adult 
AUC12h) and with a first dose adjustment capped at 200 mg twice daily (bid). 
- The third amendment (05 December 2014) was issued to incorporate revisions related to a 
change in the starting ETR dose (as per the new weight-banded ETR dosing table) for the 
study cohorts and a change in the overall PK criteria for evaluation of the (mini-)cohorts. 
- The fourth amendment (10 March 2016) was issued to revise the cohort management plan to allow 
early opening of the mini-cohort of Cohort III (while the first mini-cohort of Cohort II could still be 
enrolling) provided that the available Cohort II safety and PK were acceptable. Subjects <6 months of 
age could only be enrolled after initial safety and PK data from subjects between 6 months and 1 year 
of age were available. A go/no-go decision for further recruitment of study subjects was set 
approximately 2 years following the opening of Cohort II. However, on 02 October 2017, the 
enrolment into Cohort II was closed after enrolment of the 6th subject into mini-cohort II 
(which occurred after the cut-off date for the Week-24 analysis) and it was decided to not 
open Cohort III. 
Baseline data 
In the 2 cohorts combined, 53.8% (14/26) of subjects were male and 46.2% (12/26) were female. In 
the 2 cohorts combined, 50.0% (13/26) of the subjects were from South Africa, 34.6% (9/26) were 
from Brazil, and 15.4% (4/26) were from the US (See Table 26)

Most subjects had previous experience with a NRTI and PI combination (80.8%, 21/26), an NRTI 
(53.8%, 14/26), or an NRTI and NNRTI combination (42.3%, 11/26). The most frequently used 
therapy at screening was an NRTI and PI combination (46.2%, 12/26). The following ARVs were 
previously used by ≥42.3% of subjects (≥11/26 subjects in the 2 cohorts combined): lamivudine 
(used by all subjects), lopinavir boosted with ritonavir (rtv), zidovudine, nevirapine, and abacavir. 
These ARVs were also the most frequently used ARVs at screening, with lamivudine as the most 
frequently used ARV (used by all but 1 subject):

Percentage of subjects with <200 and <50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL at Week 48 
Of the 17 subjects in the ITT population who achieved a virologic response of <400 HIV-1 RNA 
copies/mL at Week 48 (Cohorts I and II combined), 14 subjects in total (13/20 [65.0%] in Cohort I 
and 1/6 [16.7%] in Cohort II) reached a virologic response of <200 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL at Week 48 
per the FDA Snapshot approach. 
Of the 10 subjects in the ITT population (Cohorts I and II combined) with available data for the <50 
HIV-1 RNA copies/mL threshold at Week 48 (ie, where the limit of quantification of the assay was 40 
HIV-1 RNA copies/mL), 9 subjects (8/9 [88.9%] subjects in Cohort I and 1/1 [100%] subjects in 
Cohort II) achieved a viral load <50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL at Week 48.

(N=6), and -2.017 (-4.04; 0.45) log10 copies/mL in Cohorts I and II combined (N=26) (NC=F 
analysis). 
Protocol-defined Virologic Outcome 
The protocol-defined criteria for success were: 
- either HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL or a ≥0.5 log10 reduction in HIV-1 RNA (copies/mL) at Week 8 
- either HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL or a ≥1 log10 reduction in HIV-1 RNA (copies/mL) at Week 12 
- either HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL or a ≥2 log10 reduction in HIV-1 RNA (copies/mL) at Week 24 
- either HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL or a ≥2 log10 reduction in HIV-1 RNA (copies/mL) at Week 48

The protocol-defined criteria for virologic failure were: 
- Lack of virologic response: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
a confirmed HIV-1 RNA at Week 8 that was not ≥0.5 log10 lower than the HIV-1 RNA 
at baseline (unless the viral load at Week 8 was already <400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) 
a confirmed HIV-1 RNA at or after Week 12 that was not ≥1 log10 lower than the HIV 
RNA at baseline (unless the viral load at Week 12 or later was already <400 HIV-1 RNA 
copies/mL) 
a confirmed HIV-1 RNA ≥400 copies/mL and not ≥2 log10 reduction in HIV-1 RNA at 
Week 24 
a confirmed HIV-1 RNA ≥400 copies/mL and not ≥2 log10 reduction in HIV-1 RNA at 
Week 48 
- Virologic rebound: 
• 
for subjects whose nadir was <400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL: a confirmed* HIV-1 RNA 
>1,000 copies/mL (on 2 consecutive measurements at least 1 week but no more than 
4 weeks apart). 
Among the subjects with data at the Week-48 timepoint, 88.9% (16/18) of the subjects in Cohort I, 
25.0% (1/4) of the subjects in Cohort II, and 77.3% (17/22) of the subjects in Cohorts I and II 
combined met the criteria for protocol-defined virologic success.

N: Number of subjects with HIV-1 RNA data. 
For the criteria of protocol-defined success and protocol-defined virologic failure (ie, lack of virologic 
response or virologic rebound)  
Virologic rebound took precedence over the criteria for success and lack of virologic response.Last 
available viral load was defined as the last viral load measurement during treatment. For overall 
protocol-defined virologic outcome, a subject was classified as 'virologic failure' if the subject, over 
time, ever showed protocol-defined virologic failure (ie, lack of virologic response or 
virologic rebound). 
Data from Week 8 onwards were used in the analysis. Subjects who discontinued prior to Week 8 
were not included in the analysis. Subjects without HIV-1 viral load data (Abbott RealTime HIV-1 
assay) at a visit (treatment phase), either due to missing data or due to discontinuation, whatever 
the reason, were not included in the analysis for that specific visit. For 
intermittent visits in between and beyond Weeks 8, 12, 24 and 48, definitions were carried forward. 
If no confirmatory HIV-1 RNA measurement was available (yet) within 1 to 4 weeks, the outcome 
assessment for 'virologic failure' was based on a single HIV-1 RNA measurement, ie, if that single 
value was higher than the threshold, it was classified as virologic failure. 
# Only HIV-1 RNA measurements from the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay were used in the efficacy 
analyses (at Weeks 12, 24 and 48 for Subject ID 
; at Weeks 8 and 24 for Subject ID 
; at Weeks 8 and 12 for Subject ID 
; and at Week 8 for subject ID 
).

Subgroup analyses shown a trend for a higher virologic response rate (according to the FDA Snapshot 
approach and the protocol-defined virologic outcome) for subjects: 
- who were adherent to ETR and/or OBR versus subjects who were non-adherent per questionnaire 
(virologic response [HIV RNA <400 copies/mL] was 76.2% [16/21] for subjects adherent to ETR and 
20.0% [1/5] for subjects non-adherent to ETR; and 75.0% [15/20] for subjects adherent to OBR and 
40.0% [2/5] for subjects non-adherent to OBR), and 
- who swallowed the ETR tablet whole versus subjects who took ETR dispersed (virologic response [HIV 
RNA <400 copies/mL] was 100.0% [6/6] for subject who swallowed the ETR tablet whole and 42.9% 
[6/14] for subjects who took ETR dispersed in liquid). 
  Development of resistance 
Paired resistance data (phenotype and/or genotype) at baseline and endpoint (defined as last viral load 
with available genotype and/or phenotype data within the treatment phase) were available for 9 
subjects (4 in Cohort I and 5 in Cohort II) with confirmed virologic failure. For 2 subjects only paired 
phenotype data were available (both in Cohort II), and for 2 subjects only paired genotype data were 
available (1 in Cohort I and 1 in Cohort II).

Based on available paired phenotype and/or genotype data at baseline and endpoint, development of 
resistance to ETR (ie, ETR WGS≥4 and/or ETR FC>10) was observed for 2/9 subjects (for both during 
the Week-48 period): for 1 subject in Cohort I and for 1 subject in Cohort II (in both subjects 
determined by genotype and phenotype). Both subjects discontinued the study for this reason. In 
addition, 2 subjects (both in Cohort I) developed partial sensitivity to ETR by phenotype (2.9<FC≤10), 
of whom 1 also developed intermediate resistance to ETR by genotype (2.5≤ETR WGS≤3.5). 
Furthermore, 1 subject in Cohort II developed intermediate resistance to ETR by genotype (phenotype 
not available). 
ETR RAMs emerging at endpoint were K101E, E138A, E138Q, V179F, V179T, Y181C, and M230L (all of 
which were observed in at most 1 subject, except for Y181C [3 subjects] and M230L [2 subjects]). The 
only other NNRTI RAMs observed were V179I and V189I (in a single subject in Cohort I). The 
respective OBRs remained sensitive at endpoint in all subjects with available phenotype data at 
endpoint.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Extensions of indication to include paediatric patients for antiretroviral agents are primarily based on 
demonstration of comparable exposure in children vs. adults. A specific demonstration of antiviral 
efficacy in paediatric patients is not required, as it is stressed out in the EMA Guideline on the clinical 
development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infection. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical PK, efficacy and safety data in support of this younger age paediatric extension are derived 
from an open label phase 1/2 study TMC125-234  (IMPAACT 1090) enrolling 20 subjects in Cohort I 
(aged ≥2 to <6 years) and 6 subjects in Cohort II (aged ≥1 to <2 years). Subjects were on a 
virologically failing regimen (containing at least 3 ARV). Of note, a Cohort III (< 1 y/o) was originally 
planned but did not enrol and was closed.  
This paediatric study TMC125-C234 including a research of the optimal dose (based on PK and safety 
criteria) and a sequential inclusion (with the use of mini-cohorts) was compliant with the PIP of 
Intelence (P/0121/2019). According to efficacy data and PK data, the inclusion of subjects from 1 to 
<2 years of age was stopped, which is endorsed. For these younger subjects on a failing ARV regimen, 
other medicines may be available (notably raltegravir), but efavirenz is the only NNRTI available for 
this population. 
When focusing on subjects ≥2 years old (the cohort II was interrupted for efficacy concerns), only half 
of the subjects (11 subjects/20) have received the recommended ETR dose. Additionally: 
- 3 subjects start with a lower ETR dose without further dose adjustment throughout the study,  
- 1 subject start with a lower ETR dose and then received a higher-than-recommended ETR dose due 
to individual PK results, 
- 5 subjects have received a higher ETR dose after dose adjustment based on individual PK results. 
The 4 subjects who start with a lower ETR dose were subjects initially enrolled in the mini-cohort and 
who received the initial recommended ETR dose (which was 5.2 mg/kg bid for all body weights). Then, 
a revision of the ETR dose was introduced according to PK data from this mini-cohort, with an 
increased ETR recommended dose for subjects weighing 13-<16 kg (6.8 mg/kg/BID) and <13 kg (8.8 
mg/kg/BID). According to individual PK dose-adjustments, one of these 4 subjects had an increase of 
its ETR dose according to the new recommended dosing schedule and, whereas the 3 other subjects 
remained with their original ETR dose (subset a). 
Therefore, the efficacy and safety data of the proposed ETR dose in these subjects (i.e. 100 mg BID for 
subjects ≥10 kg to <20 kg, 125 mg BID for subjects ≥20 kg to <25 kg, 150 mg BID for subjects ≥25 
kg to <30 kg and 200 mg BID for subjects ≥30 kg) were issued from only 11 subjects.  
Among the 5 subjects (cohort I) who discontinued from study, 2 may be considered related to ETR (1 
grade 4 lipase increase and 1 virologic failure due to ETR resistance). 
The dose selection was established so that the geometric mean ETR AUC12h was between 60% and 
150% of the geometric mean ETR AUC12h in HIV-1 infected, ART-experienced adults from the DUET 
studies (ie, between 2,713 and 6,783 ng*h/mL). Dose-adjustment may occur according to the 
individual PK data. Initially, all subjects from 2 to <6 years of age were treated with ETR 5.2 mg/kg 
BID, whatever their weight. However, the mean ETR exposure (AUC and Cmin) was significantly lower 
for the first 6 patients included in the mini-cohort I. Notably, 2 subjects required individual dose 
adjustment because their ETR AUC12h was below 2,350 ng.h/ml. Therefore, the Applicant has 
Assessment report  
EMA/175628/2020  
Page 63/86 
 
 
 
proposed to increase ETR dose for subjects weighing <16 kg (6.8 mg/kg BID for subjects 13-<16 kg, 
and 8.8 mg/kg BID for subjects <13 kg).  
This dose adjustment for the lower weight ranges was supported by the population PK analysis and 
intensive PK analysis in subjects receiving the recommended dose of ETR (Refer to section 2.3.2 
Pharmacokinetics and 2.3.3 Discussion of clinical pharmacology). Consequently, among the 20 
subjects above 2 years of age, only 11 children were treated with the recommended ETR dose 
according to their weight. 
The design of the study targeting paediatric patients was acknowledged by the CHMP, with different 
age and/or weight cohorts, a sequential enrolment inter- and intra-cohort, and possible dose 
adjustments based on safety and PK data. The dose selection was established so that the geometric 
mean ETR AUC12h was between 60% and 150% of the geometric mean ETR AUC12h in HIV-1 
infected, ART-experienced adults from the DUET studies (i.e., between 2,713 and 6,783 ng*h/mL).  
The CHMP requested the MAH to discuss the adequacy of this PK objective. In general, the response 
does not add to the discussion in the first round. The ETR AUC12 target (60%-150% of the geometric 
mean ETR AUC12h in ART-experienced adults, i.e. between 2713 and 6783 ng.h/ml) was large to 
consider the high inter-individual variability in clearance of ETR (62% based on the popPK analysis).  
As previously stated, the adequacy of this range may be debatable, notably as regards its lower limit. 
In addition to the proposed ETR doses, a dose adjustment was proposed for subjects with low ETR 
AUC12h (defined as <10th percentile of the adult AUC12h, i.e. 2350 ng.h/ml), which was endorsed. 
Overall, as previously stated, a relevant proportion of subjects (6/20 subjects ≥2 years old) required 
an increase of their ETR dose based on individual PK results, highlighting that the selection of 
paediatric ETR doses in younger subjects was challenging to obtain ETR exposure close to those 
observed in adults.   
Regarding the conduct of the study and the amendments to the protocol, the CHMP signalled that it 
was unclear how the 2nd and 3rd amendments may have impacted the study outcome. The Applicant 
explained the main changes to the PK objectives in amendments 2 and 3 resulted in less strict criteria 
for dose adjustment throughout the study, allowing more extreme exposures in the final data set. 
Overall, most of the subjects were included in the versions 3 and 4 of the protocol, i.e. with the 
recommended ETR doses.  
The included population could be regarded as representative for the target population in medical need, 
with mainly HIV-1 Clade B and C. Four subjects (20%) had viral load >100.000 c/ml and 
approximately half of subjects had mild to severe immunodeficiency. Of note, clinical data in subjects 
receiving ETR 100 mg BID in the weight group 10-<13 kg are very limited and the ETR dose in this 
weight group must be further supported by PK data. At screening, most subjects from Cohort I were 
treated with 2 NRTIs (mainly AZT/3TC) + a 3rd agent [LPV/rtv (n=7), NNRTIs (n=5) or RAL (n=1)]. In 
addition, 6 subjects were treated with monotherapy of lamivudine or zidovudine and one subject did 
not take ARVs at screening. When ETR was introduced in their failing regimen, subjects were rightly 
treated with ETR in combination with a boosted PI (mainly LPV/rtv or DRV/rtv) and at least one 
additional active drug (NRTI or RAL). 
The enrolled subjects have mainly HIV-1 Clade B or C in line with the study centers notably clade C for 
a population mainly from South Africa. According to the baseline characteristics provided in the Annex 
of CSR, in cohort I (2-6 years old), subjects were rather 3 to 5 years old (only 2 subjects were 2 years 
of age at baseline). Enrolled subjects were at baseline in the weight bands 10 to <13 kg (n=3), 13 to 
<16 kg (n=9), 16 to <20 kg (n=5) and 20 to <25 kg (n=3), with a lower weight at 12 kg. Thus, 
clinical data in subjects receiving ETR 100 mg BID in the weight group 10-<13 kg are very limited, but 
PK data are in favor of an adequate ETR dose for these subjects. Four subjects (20%) had viral load 
Assessment report  
EMA/175628/2020  
Page 64/86 
 
 
 
>100.000 c/ml. Considering the WHO classification in paediatric subjects, approximately half of 
subjects had mild to severe immunodeficiency, based on their CD4 cells count and percentage. In 
addition, 13 subjects (65%) were CDC class B or C. 
At screening, the included subjects of cohort I (2-6 years old) were mainly treated with a backbone 
AZT/3TC (n=11) with few subjects treated with ABC/3TC (n=2) and d4T/3TC (n=1). A 3rd agent was 
used by 13 subjects (70%) and consisted in LPV/rtv (n=7), NNRTIs [nevirapine (n=4), efavirenz 
(n=1)] or RAL (n=1). Of note, 6 subjects were treated with monotherapy of lamivudine (n=5) or 
zidovudine (n=1) and one subject did not take ARVs at screening. 
According to the protocol and the therapeutic indication of Intelence, subjects were rightly treated with 
ETR in combination with a boosted PI and at least one additional active drug. In cohort I, the boosted 
PI was mainly LPV/rtv (11 subjects) or DRV/rtv (8 subjects), with only 1 subject treated with ATV/rtv, 
and the 3rd agent was NRTI or RAL. No subjects were treated with more than 3 ARVs 
The CHMP requested the MAH to display, for each subject from Cohort I, i) the number and 
composition of their previous ARV regimen and ii) whether there were modifications of their ARV 
regimen for efficacy and/or resistance concerns . 
The MAH provided further information on the individual number and composition of the previous ARV 
regimen of each subject, which was acknowledged by the CHMP, and clarified that information on the 
reasons for modifications of the subjects' previous ARV regimen was not captured in the study. 
Considering the subjects from Cohort I (2-6 years old), the coadministration of ETR with a boosted PI 
and one additional active drug seems effective, with respectively 80% and 65% of subjects with viral 
load <400 c/ml and <200 c/ml at Week 48. As a matter of fact, it could be highlighted that this level 
of virologic suppression is achieved with 11 among the 20 subjects enrolled in the cohort, treated at 
the recommended ETR dose.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
ETR exposure with the recommended doses in this population is similar to that observed in older 
paediatric subjects (>6 years old, for which ETR is marketed) which was to be aligned to that of adult 
patients. In line with the EU guidelines for anti-HIV drug development, efficacy demonstration in HIV 
infected adults is not required to be duplicated for paediatric claim as soon as similar exposure to 
adults could be achieved to predict similar efficacy and safety. 
Efficacy data although exploratory, can be regarded as reassuring in the cohort in subjects between 2 
to 6 years old, 80% of the 20 subjects have achieved viral load <400 c/ml at Week 48. Therefore, a 
combination of 2 NRTIs + ETR recommended dose + another active ARV (usually PI or RAL) may be 
effective in ARV experienced paediatric subjects. These results were achieved while 11 on 20 subjects 
had required an adjusted dose so that finally be treated according to the recommended dose.  
However, according to subgroup analyses, the mode of administration seems to have a significant 
impact on the efficacy result: across Cohorts I and II, 7/14 subjects who took ETR dispersed in liquid 
(including the 3 failing subjects from Cohort I) experienced virologic failure, vs none subject who 
swallowed the ETR tablet whole. PK data support this difference, with a statistically higher ETR 
exposure in children who swallowed the tablets whole compared to those who took the tablets 
dispersed in liquid. This may be the consequence of a partial intake of ETR when tablets are dispersed 
in liquid, possibly related to a bad taste.

swallowed; ITT (Study TNC125C234) 
This may explain the inadequate rate of virologic response in the youngest subjects (Cohort II). 
Furthermore, PK data has reported a statistically higher ETR exposure in children who swallowed the 
tablets whole (mean ETR AUC12h: 10721 ng.h/ml) compared to those who took the tablets dispersed 
in liquid (mean ETR AUC12h: 2841 ng.h/ml, p<0.001).

Indeed, subgroups analyses highlighted that the mode of administration may have an impact the ETR 
exposure, with lower exposure (and consequently higher rate of virologic failure) in subjects who took 
the tablets dispersed in liquid vs ETR tablets swallowed whole. This trend is also observed with efficacy 
data. However, such administration is expected to be the main used method in younger subjects, 
especially under 6 years old. Notably, 5 of 6 subjects aged ≥2 to <6 years (Cohort I) who required an 
individual dose adjustment took the tablet dispersed in liquid.  
According to the protocol, the ETR tablets were to be swallowed whole with water or other liquid within 
30 minutes following a meal. The tablets could also be dispersed in water or other liquid if the subject 
was unable to swallow the tablets whole. The ETR 25-mg and 100-mg tablets that are used in Study 
TMC125-C234 are the commercially available tablets. It was previously shown that, in healthy adults, 
the bioavailability of ETR was similar when the tablet was dispersed or swallowed whole (geometric 
mean (dispersed/whole) AUC ratio [90%CI]: 96.54% [90.48 – 103.0]). As such, it could be concluded 
that the bioavailability of ETR should be similar for dispersed tablets (taken correctly) compared to 
swallowed whole. However, since during study TMC125-C234 there were notifications of difficulties 
with dosing (refusing/vomiting/spitting up the dose and reporting bad taste). 
This issue was signalled by the CHMP as a potential risks of formulation inadequacy. The formulation 
seems not appropriate for the younger population if not able to swallow whole.  
At the request of the CHMP, the MAH analysed the impact of the mode of administration and the 
adequacy of the formulation. It should be noted that there were only 4 children with intensive PK on 
the recommended ETR dose who swallowed the tablet whole. 
The MAH provided further data on the exposure of dispersed versus whole tablets and intake of entire 
dose. The popPK model, suggesting a formulation effect, was built based on PK data from Studies 
TMC125-C126, TMC125-C213, and TMC125-C234, including those obtained in children <2 years and/or 
<10 kg for whom intake issues were reported

Children in 
P1090: Study TMC125-C234 
The low outlier for AUC12h of dispersed tablets was obtained for Subject 
before and during the PK assessment 
 (12 kg) for which diarrhea was reported 
The popPK model suggests a lower ETR exposure in subjects taking ETR dispersed into liquid vs whole. 
However, the PK values are still within those observed in adults. In addition, there is no PK/PD 
relationship. Therefore, this lower ETR exposure might still be compatible with a virologic response. 
Furthermore, the bioequivalence between ETR tablets administered dispersed vs swallowed whole was 
previously demonstrated in adults (study TMC125-C173). For children, the adequacy of the method for 
ETR administration by dispersion into liquid was verified in a study (CMC Report DS-TEC-41719. In-use 
stability report of R165335 25mg oral tablets). Thus, the bioavailability of ETR (and therefore ETR 
exposure) is expected to be similar whatever its method of administration, provided that i) the 
procedure for ETR tablets dispersion was rightly performed by the child caregiver, and ii) there was no 
intake issue by the child. 
In children from 2 to <6 years of age, ETR sub-exposure was reported in subjects who took ETR 
tablets dispersed in liquid (which is expected to be the main method of administration in these 
subjects). This was due to intake issues (refusal by the child, notably because of bad taste), and low 
ETR dose (for subjects who had a body weight at the higher end (16-<20kg) of the range for which a 
dose a 100 mg was recommended (10-<20kg). This was predicted by the popPK analysis, where 10% 
to 20% of subjects weighing between 16-20 kg and receiving the recommended ETR dose (100 mg 
BID) are expected to have ETR AUC below the threshold of 2350 ng.h/ml. Of note, ETR is already 
indicated with this posology for children weighing 16 to 20 kg. For these subjects, no virological failure 
was reported. 
In the case of children below 2 years of age, ETR sub-exposure and virological failure were associated 
to intake issues. 
In addition, CHMP recommended the MAH to strongly advise in the SmPC that for children between 2 
to 6 years of age who cannot swallow the tablet, a different drug can favourably be used instead of 
dispersing the tablet in liquid and potentially getting too low exposure. For the rare situations where 
Assessment report  
EMA/175628/2020  
Page 68/86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ETR is considered as the last option available and cannot be swallowed whole, CHMP recommended the 
MAH to reinforce the recommendation for an adequate handling of the dispersed tablet and discuss 
recommendation of Plasma Drug Monitoring (PDM) to ensure the adequacy of the ETR dose. 
The MAH exposed that PDM, while not bearing major safety concerns, seemed unlikely to yield in 
improvements in treatment outcome. The CHMP agreed that a systematic TDM might not be an 
optimal tool, in view of the lack of PK/PD relationship and the fact that this might not always be locally 
feasible. Instead, the focus should stay on ensuring the adequate dispersion and complete intake of 
the ETR dose rather than the ETR plasma concentration. 
In relation to the very low rate of virologic success in the younger cohort (1-<2 years old), with almost 
all included subjects (5/6) who have experienced virologic failure, the CHMP endorsed the MAH 
decision to stop inclusion of these subjects. However, CHMP requested the MAH to further scrutinize 
the reasons behind such a poor virologic response notably based on PK data and mode of 
administration and discuss the potential relevance for the claimed target paediatric extension.  
Moreover, The CHMP requested the MAH to clarify if any condition (e.g. concomitant infection) has 
occurred in subjects with virologic failure which could have contributed to the observed increase in 
viral load in these cases. When focusing on the 3 subjects from Cohort II who experienced virologic 
failure, no common characteristic may be highlighted (notably as regards the weight or the subset 
group of ETR dose).  
The MAH explored the potential reasons that could explain the inadequate response rate in subjects 
below 2 years of age. In Cohort II (≥1 to <2 years), the MAH found that treatment adherence issues 
and infection episodes (mostly upper respiratory infections) seem to be the likely underlying reasons 
for the observed increase in viral load in these subjects.  
In the case of Cohort I (≥2 to <6 years), the MAH found that treatment adherence issues seem to be 
the likely underlying reasons for the observed increase in viral load in these subjects. 
Adherence/intake issues were not reported to the same extent as those reported in Cohort II.  
The MAH’s response was acknowledged by the CHMP. Even though infection episodes were occasionally 
identified, and in some cases temporally associated with a rise in viral load, the main driver for 
virologic failure was more likely related to treatment adherence issues (particularly in cohort I). 
Again, the CHMP reinforced the concept that ensuring adequate administration is essential to obtain 
optimal virologic response. 
Finally, regarding the development of resistance, the emergence of NNRTI RAMs is consistent with the 
known resistance profile of ETR. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, it is acknowledged that this study is not designed to substantiate clinical efficacy in subjects <6 
years  old.  Nonetheless,  the  efficacy  data  in  subjects  between  2  to  6  years  of  age  suggest  that  the 
recommended ETR doses, co-administered with boosted PI and another ARV, could be effective to obtain 
virologic success in ARV-experienced children between 2 to 6 years of age at the recommended dose. 
However, when integrating the PK and efficacy findings (notably the poor response rate in children from 
1 to 2 years of age, with reasons of potential relevance for the claimed population) there is a need to 
better understand the situations under which ETR would not be adequate for achieving virologic response 
in the newly targeted younger paediatric age strata. 
Concerns were raised on the fact that mode of administration may impact the ETR exposure, with lower 
exposure  in  subjects  who  took  the  tablets  dispersed  in  liquid,  even  more  when  having  in  mind  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/175628/2020  
Page 69/86 
 
 
 
significant  PK  variability  of  ETR.  Moreover,  some  patients  have  required  higher  than  the  ETR 
recommended  dose.    Inadequate  method  of  dispersion  and  intake  issues  seem  to  be  the  more  likely 
reasons  for  ETR  sub-exposure  and  consequently  for  virologic  failure.  Therefore,  the  MAH proposed  to 
reinforce the message in the SmPC and PL in response to CHMP recommendation. The MAH has included 
a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC in regards to the potential risk of inadequate intake with potential 
virologic impact. It includes more explicit content, reflecting to some extent the recommendations given 
to the caregivers during the clinical trial (notably the methods of dilution of the tablets with the precision 
of the required volumes to be use). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
At the cut-off date for the Week-48 analysis (12 July 2018), 26 subjects had been included in the 
study: 20 subjects aged ≥2 to <6 years (Cohort I) and 6 subjects aged ≥1 to <2 years (Cohort II). A 
total of 15 subjects received the recommended ETR dose throughout the study (subset i), 11 subjects 
in Cohort I and 4 subjects in Cohort II. A total of 22 subjects received the recommended ETR dose or 
higher (subset i+b), 16 subjects in Cohort I and 6 subjects in Cohort II. 
- Cohort I (ITT population, N=20): Mean (SD) ETR exposure: 143.11 (82.88) weeks; Total patient-
years of ETR exposure: 54.9 years 
- Cohort II (ITT population, N=6): Mean (SD) ETR exposure: 53.48 (25.64) weeks; Total patient-years 
of ETR exposure: 6.1 years 
Of these 26 subjects, 18 (69.2%) subjects (15 [75.0%] subjects in Cohort I and 3 [50.0%] subjects in 
Cohort II) were ongoing in the study at the time of analysis. Data beyond Week 48 were available for 
17/26 (16/20 subjects in Cohort I and 1/6 subjects in Cohort II) subjects, with a maximum follow-up 
until Week 276. 
Adverse events  
All subjects in each cohort reported at least one adverse event (AE). The incidence of grade 3 or grade 
4 AEs was 45.0% (9/20) and 83.3% (5/6) in Cohort I and Cohort II, respectively, and the incidence of 
serious adverse events (SAEs) at least possibly related to ETR was 10.0% (2/20) and 0% (0/6) of 
subjects in Cohort I and Cohort II, respectively. The majority of the AEs occurred between baseline 
and the Week 48 visit.

There were no deaths during the study. 
SAEs were reported in 15.0% (3/20) of subjects in Cohort I and 50.0% (3/6) of subjects in Cohort II: 
- All SAEs by preferred term were reported in at most 1 subject within a cohort, except for lipase 
increased (reported in 2 subjects in Cohort I). 
- Two subjects (1 in each cohort) had more than 1 SAE (Subject in Cohort I: lipase increased and 
platelet count decreased; Subject in Cohort II: platelet count decreased and ligament sprain). 
- Three SAEs were grade 4 in severity (platelet count decreased and lipase increased in 1 subject in 
Cohort I, and anemia in 1 subject in Cohort II), and 1 was grade 2 in severity (ligament sprain); the 
other SAEs were grade 3 in severity.

One subject in Cohort I had grade 4 lipase increased leading to permanent discontinuation of ETR at 
Week 2 (see Section 5.1.2.3). This grade 4 AE was reported as serious and considered related to ETR 
and OBR. No other (S)AEs led to permanent discontinuation of ETR. 
Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in 45.0% (9/20) of subjects in Cohort I and 83.3% (5/6) of subjects in 
Cohort II: 
- All grade 3-4 AEs concerned abnormalities in laboratory parameters or vital signs. 
- All grade 3-4 AEs by preferred term occurred in at most 2 subjects within a cohort, except for blood 
pressure diastolic increased (reported in 3 subjects in each cohort) and blood pressure systolic 
increased (reported in 3 subjects in Cohort II). 
- In Cohort I, 3 grade 3-4 AEs were reported as serious (lipase increased, neutrophil count decreased, 
and platelet count decreased). 
- In Cohort II, 3 grade 3-4 AEs were reported as serious (neutrophil count decreased, platelet count 
decreased, and anemia). 
- All Grade 3-4 AEs occurred between baseline and the Week 48 visit, except for 1 case of blood 
pressure diastolic increased in each cohort, 1 case of blood cholesterol increased, 1 case of blood 
pressure systolic increased, 1 case of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) increased, and 1 case of pyrexia.

  Skin events 
Skin adverse events have been reported in 65% (13/20) of patients from cohort I and 83.3% (5/6) of 
patients from cohort II. All skin AEOI were grade 1 or 2 in severity. None led to ETR discontinuation. 
None of the skin adverse events for which a causality assessment is available was considered as related 
to ETR. 
For the rash, the most frequent skin AEOI reported in 55% (11/20) of patients from cohort I and 50% 
(3/6)  of  patients  from  cohort  II,  all  cases  resolved  while  ETR  treatment  was  continued  and  therefore 
none have been considered as related to ETR. 
For (severe) cutaneous reactions, reported in 10% (2/20) of patients from cohort I and 16.7% (1/6) of 
patients  from  cohort  II,  one  event  in  cohort  I  was  considered  as  not  related  to  ETR  and  the  causal 
relationship to ETR for the other 2 AE was not reported.  
For angioedema and related AE reported in 10% (2/20) of patients from cohort I (wheezing and 
urticarial) and 33% (2/6) of patients from cohort II (wheezing), all cases but one grade 2 were grade 1 
in severity and the causal relationship was considered as not related or not reported. ARV therapies

have been continued in all cases. Overall none of the 4 cases have been considered as suggestive of 
angioneurotic syndrome. 
  Hepatic events 
Hepatic adverse events have been reported in 33% (2/6) patients from cohort II and in none patients 
from  cohort  I.  Both  AEs  occurred  before  week  48  and  none  of  them  were  serious  or  led  to  ETR 
discontinuation. There were: 
-hepatomegaly  reported  in  a 
  patient  on  day  1  which  resolved  on  D106.  HPM  was 
considered as not related to ETR. 
-one grade 4 ALT increased (possibly related to ETR and OBR) and grade 3 AST increased (considered 
as not related to ETR/OBT) reported at week 16 in a 
 patient which resolved at week 24. 
Both ETR and OBT have been temporarily suspended for 2 day at week 16. 
Apart from the case described above, no other grade 3 or 4 hepatic laboratory abnormalities have been 
reported. 
  Pancreatic events 
Pancreatic adverse events occurred in 10% (2/20) of patients from cohort I and none from cohort II. 
Both patients from cohort I experienced serious lipase increase before week 48: 
-a 
 patient experienced grade 4 lipase increased considered as definitely related to ETR 
and probably related to OBT at week 2. On day 16, ETR was permanently discontinued and OBT (LPV/rtv 
and  RTG)  temporarily  suspended.  The  patient  had  no  symptoms  of  pancreatitis  and  abdominal  CT 
normal. At days 36 and 44, he had grade 2 lipase increase. The OBR was re-started. 
-a 
 patient experienced grade 3 lipase increased at week 16. He had normal lipase at 
baseline and lipase returned to grade 2 at day 130 and to normal at the last assessment post-treatment. 
The AE was considered as possibly related to ETR and probably related to OBR (LPV/rtv and raltegravir). 
Apart  from  these  grade  3  and  4  lipase  increase  described  above,  no  other  grade  3  or  4  laboratory 
anomalies were reported. 
  Lipid-related events: 
Lipid-related adverse events have been reported in 5% (1/20) of patients from cohort I and none from 
cohort II. The only AE reported was a grade 3 blood cholesterol increased at week 120 and a grade 3 
LDL  cholesterol  increased  at  week  156.  Both  AEs  were  not  serious.  ETR  was  not  discontinued.  The 
causality assessment for ETR was not specified. No other graded lipid-related laboratory abnormalities 
were reported in the paediatric population included in the study. 
  Other AEOI: 
As neuropsychiatric AEs, one grade 2 insomnia was reported on day 1303 in a 
 patient 
from  cohort  I.  The  duration  of  the  AE  is  unknown.  The  AE  was  considered  as  not  related  to  ETR  and 
causality to OBR was not reported. 
A neoplastic AEs, one skin papilloma (grade 1 not related to ETR) was reported in a patient from the 
cohort I. 
Otherwise, no bleeding and cardiac AEs have been reported in the study.

Laboratory findings 
The majority of treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities reported are grade 1 or 2. Grade 3 
and/or 4 disorders have been reported in 9 patients. Apart from the 5 reported described earlier, there 
have been 1 Hb decreased in a patient from cohort II, 1 platelet count decreased in 2 patients (1 in 
each cohort) and absolute neutrophils count decreased in 3 patients (1 in cohort II and 2 in cohort I). 
None led to ETR discontinuation.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
1 subject (5.0%) in Cohort I (and none in Cohort II) permanently discontinued ETR due to grade 4 
lipase increased, which was reported as a grade 4 SAE that was considered to be related to ETR and 
the OBR. 
Other safety assessments 
The review of vital signs or electrocardiogram parameters did not identify any clinically relevant findings. 
Regarding growth parameters, the median height-for-age z-scores increased over time in both cohort I 
and  II  and  the  median  weight-for-age  z-scores  increase  was  small  notably  in  cohort  I.  Head 
circumferences have been measured in subjects aged <3 years. The median head circumference z-scores 
increased over time in cohort II and was available in only 1 patient from cohort I. 
Overall, according to the MAH, no newly identified safety concerns have emerged from the review of 
safety data gathered in the study. 
Post marketing experience 
At the time of the finalization of this Summary of Clinical Safety Addendum, 16 Periodic Benefit Risk 
Evaluation Reports (PBRERs)/Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) were available summarizing the 
safety data for ETR obtained by Global Medical Safety of Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research 
& Development during the period from 27 March 2008 to 27 September 2018, including data from 
paediatric patients. Additionally, postmarketing exposure data were requested for the period from 28 
September 2018 to 31 July 2019. 
There were 168,480 units of 25 mg ETR tablets distributed worldwide from launch to 31 July 2019. 
Based on the 313,187,880 tablets distributed worldwide from launch to 31 July 2019, the estimated 
exposure to 100 mg ETR is 217,491 person-years. Based on the 237,414,548 tablets distributed 
worldwide from launch to 31 July 2019, the estimated exposure to 200 mg ETR is 329,742 person-
years. 
The most recent PBRER/PSUR concluded that, no new risk or change in the risks characteristics were 
identified during the reporting period and that ETR continues to have a favourable benefit-risk profile 
for the treatment of patients with the approved indication. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, AEs considered related to ETR were lipase increase (n=2), ALT increase (n=1), vomiting (n=1) 
and platelet count decreased (n=1). As expected, rash and other skin events were commonly observed 
(69% of all subjects) although none was considered related to ETR. Two hepatic events were observed, 
Assessment report  
EMA/175628/2020  
Page 75/86 
 
 
 
 
both in Cohort II (1-<2 years old). In Cohort I (2-<6 years old), 2 lipase increases, both considered 
related to ETR, were observed, including one Grade 4 leading to discontinuation. No symptoms of 
pancreatitis were observed.  
Rash, ALT increase and lipase increase are known AEs observed with ETR. No new AEs was observed.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
According to the Applicant, there were no newly identified clinically relevant safety findings in subjects 
from either Cohort I (aged ≥2 to <6 years) or Cohort II (aged ≥1 to <2 years) of this study, up to the 
safety cut-off date of 31 July 2019, compared with the known ETR safety profile in HIV-1 infected 
adults, adolescents and children aged ≥6 years. However, the number of subjects included in this 
study is too small to detect potential safety concern in this population. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. The PSUR 
cycle for the medicinal product should continue to follow a one-yearly cycle. The next data lock point 
will be 27 September 2020. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version (version 3, with a DLP 31 July 2019) with this application, 
in replacement of version 12.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 3 is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 3 with the following content: 
Safety concerns 
The main proposed RMP changes were the revision of the safety specifications and PhV Plan due to the 
extended indication to children from 2 years of age instead of 6 years of age and the revision of the 
RMP in accordance with GVP Module V Rev 2. 
The changes proposed are detailed below for each section 
Epidemiology of the indications and Target Population 
The figures concerning the target population (adults and children) have been revised accordingly based 
on the 2018 UNAIDS report. 
Clinical trial exposure 
The figures concerning children exposed to etravirine in clinical trials notably in studies TMC125-C234 
and TMC125-C213 have been updated accordingly. 
Safety specifications 
Assessment report  
EMA/175628/2020  
Page 76/86 
 
 
 
 
Based on the extension of the submitted indication to paediatric patients from 2 years of age, the MAH 
has proposed : 
to change missing information “long-term safety data in children 6 years to less than 18 years 
• 
of age” to “long-term safety data in children 2 years to less than 18 years of age”, 
• 
to remove the following important identified risks: 
-Rash/ severe cutaneous reactions 
-severe hypersensitivity including Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms 
(DRESS), 
-hepatotoxicity 
-pancreatitis 
-hyperlipidemia 
-coronary artery disorders 
-development of drug resistance 
-drug-drug interactions 
The justification provided by the applicant to remove from the safety specifications all these risks is that 
all these risks have been identified during the clinical development program. In post-marketing, no new 
signals have been raised. The applicant considers these risks to be fully characterized and appropriately 
managed. Moreover, there are no outstanding additional pharmacovigilance activities to evaluate these 
risks  for  Intelence  and  no  further  evaluation  is  considered  as  needed.  Most  risks  are  included  in  the 
European Guidelines as adverse reactions of individual ARV drugs. The information provided in the SmPC 
and Package Leaflet is considered as sufficient to inform on these risks. 
• 
to remove the following important potential risks: 
o  overdose due to medication error, 
The Applicant justifies this removal stating that no cases of medication error and consequently no 
medication error resulting in overdose have been reported during the clinical development program. 
No new signals have been raised in post-marketing on this issue. There are also no outstanding 
additional pharmacovigilance activities to evaluate these risks for Intelence and no further evaluation 
is considered as needed. 
o 
immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome 
Cases  of  IRIS  have  been  reported  with  etravirine-containing  cART  during  its  clinical  development 
program. No new signals have been raised in post-marketing on this issue. There are also no outstanding 
additional pharmacovigilance activities to evaluate these risks for Intelence and no further evaluation is 
considered  as  needed.  The  diagnosis  and  management  of  this  potential  risk  has  been  included  into 
standard clinical practise. And the information provided in the SmPC and Package Leaflet is considered 
as sufficient to inform on these risks. 
• 
to remove the following missing information: 
o 
children less than 6 years of age 
The MAH justifies this removal by stating that children less than 6 years of age are no longer 
considered as missing information since indication of Intelence is proposed to be extended to children 
from 2 years of age based on results from the week 48 report of the TMC125-C234/IMPAACT study. 
o  pregnant and breastfeeding women 
Assessment report  
EMA/175628/2020  
Page 77/86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The reason to justify this removal is according to the MAH that data from trial TMC114HIV3015 (PK and 
ETR during pregnancy) indicated that there is no clinically relevant impact of pregnancy on ETR PK (total 
exposure  was  generally  higher  during  pregnancy  but  nevertheless  in  range  with  previously  observed 
value in HIV-infected subjects). There have been no new clinically relevant safety findings in the mothers 
and in the newborns in this trial. Moreover, no signal i.e. no major teratogenic effect associated with 
etravirine  have  been  identified  in  the  APR.  Data  from  an  Investigator  Initiated  Study  indicated  that 
etravirine is excreted in human milk. The effect of etravirine on newborns/ infants is unknown. No other 
signal have been identified in post-marketing. There are no outstanding additional pharmacovigilance 
activities to evaluate the risks associated with the etravirine use during pregnancy and no need for it. 
The information provided in the PI (SmPC and PIL) is considered as sufficient (i.e. given the increased 
ETR  exposure  during  pregnancy,  caution  should  should  be  applied  for  pregnant  patients  that  require 
concomitant  medicinal  products  or  have  comorbidities  that  may  further  increase  ETR  exposure,  HIV-
infected  women  should  be  instructed  not  to  breast-feed  under  any  circumstances  in  order  to  avoid 
transmission of HIV). 
o  elderly (65 years of age and above) 
Although limited information is available on the use of etravirine in elderly patients, the MAH states that 
evidence suggests that the safety profile of etravirine in this population is not different from that in the 
general population. 
Overall, the list of safety specifications proposed by the MAH for Intelence is summarized in the table 
below: 
Table 45: Summary of Safety Concerns from the annotated Risk Management Plan 
Considering the rationale provided by the applicant and the revised GVP Module V Rev 2, the safety 
concerns listed above can be considered as appropriate.

Pharmacovigilance plan 
No new additional pharmacovigilance activities have been proposed in the timeframe of the extension 
of indication in children from the age of 2 years. The study TMC125-EPPICC has been completed and 
has therefore it has been deleted. The ongoing and planned additional pharmacovigilance activities are 
summarized in the table below: 
Table 46: Ongoing and Planned Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities from the annotated 
Risk Management Plan 
Assessment report  
EMA/175628/2020  
Page 79/86 
 
 
 
 
The final report of the study TMC125-EPPICC has been recently evaluated at the European level 
(EMA/H/C/900/P46) and led to reinforce the Intelence PI regarding the occurrence of Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome in paediatric population with etravirine (type II variation II/055) . The revision of the 
additional pharmacovigilance activities planned for etravirine with additional follow-up of children 
enrolled in studies TMC125-C234/IMPAACT P1090 and TMC125-C239. Routine pharmacovigilance and 
the proposed post-authorisation PhV development plan are sufficient to identify and characterise the 
risks of the product. 
Risk minimisation measures 
No additional risk minimization measures have been proposed by the applicant in the timeframe of the 
extended indication for etravirine in children from the age of 2 years. 
The risk minimization measures proposed for the missing information are summarized in the table 
below:

Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures 
The proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the 
proposed indication. 
Elements for a public summary of the RMP 
The elements for a public summary of the RMP do not require revision following the conclusion of the 
procedure. 
The Annexes have been revised accordingly to the changes done previously. No additional information 
has been added. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. Sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update section 4.5 of the SmPC to remove the 
interactions with Nefinavir, Boceprevir and Simeprevir and to include some typographic changes in 
Annex II C and D. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
While untreated HIV-1 infection remains a life-threatening disease, it has become a chronic disease 
with combined antiretroviral therapy being early introduced to prevent pejorative impact of immune 
deficiency (notably including opportunistic infections in patients with CD4<200/mm3). 
The goal of ARV therapy for HIV-1 infection is to delay disease progression and prolong survival by 
achieving maximal and durable suppression of HIV-1 replication. Thanks to combined antiretroviral 
therapies [mostly consisting in tri-therapy with one main agent [boosted protease inhibitor (PI), 
integrase inhibitor (INI) or non-nucleoside transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)] and a backbone regimen 
[with two nucleoside-reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI)] nowadays available high level of viral 
suppression (>90% of patients with HIV RNA <50 copies/ml) can be achieved in HIV infected patients. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently, the main ARV available for children below 6 years of age to be used as part of a 
multitherapy with NRTIs backbone are: 
- NNRTIs: EFV (≥3 years old and ≥15 kg), NVP (≥2 months old) 
- PIs: DRV/rtv (≥3 years old and ≥15 kg), LPV/rtv (≥14 days old) 
- INI: raltegravir (from birth) 
- other: maraviroc (≥2 years old and ≥10 kg) 
Assessment report  
EMA/175628/2020  
Page 81/86 
 
 
 
Etravirine is a non-nucleoside analogue that, unlike others, can retain some level of activity against 
strains harbouring NNRTI resistance. Therefore, its pharmacodynamic properties confer some potential 
added value in children with NNRTI-RAM. While a medical need could be considered in Africa, given the 
use of nevirapine as part of prevention of vertical transmission and the concerning emergence of 
resistance, the situation is to be mitigated in EU/US and all the more given the availability of 
raltegravir. On a general point of view, the need for a triple class regimen with ETR (NNRTI) plus a 
boosted PI plus a third agent clearly limits the potential use in younger children, where NNRTI and 
boosted PI are preferably introduced sequentially to spare the subsequent lines of treatment in this 
chronic disease. However, still a medical need can be observed in EU given notably the migrant 
population from Africa. 
In the European Union (EU), INTELENCE, in combination with a boosted protease inhibitor (PI) 
and other antiretroviral (ARV) medicinal products, is indicated for the treatment of HIV infection in 
antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced adult patients and in ART-experienced paediatric patients 
from 6 years of age.  
An application for the extension of the indication in HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects aged ≥2 to <6 
years was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2018, based on the Week-24 
analysis of Study TMC125-C234. The purpose of the current EU type II variation is to extend the use of 
ETR to the same target population based on the 48 weeks data of this study. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The clinical PK, efficacy and safety data in support of this younger age paediatric extension are derived 
from an open label phase 1/2 study TMC125-234  (IMPAACT 1090) enrolling 20 subjects in Cohort I 
(aged ≥2 to <6 years) and 6 subjects in Cohort II (aged ≥1 to <2 years). Subjects were on a 
virologically failing regimen (containing at least 3 ARV). Of note, a Cohort III (< 1 y/o) was originally 
planned but did not enrol and was closed.  
Initially, all subjects from 2 to <6 years of age were treated with ETR 5.2 mg/kg BID, whatever their 
weight. However, the mean ETR exposure (AUC and Cmin) was significantly lower for the first 6 
patients included in the mini-cohort I. Notably, 2 subjects required individual dose adjustment because 
their ETR AUC12h was below 2,350 ng.h/ml. Therefore, the Applicant proposed to increase ETR dose 
for subjects weighing <16 kg (6.8 mg/kg BID for subjects 13-<16 kg, and 8.8 mg/kg BID for subjects 
<13 kg). This dose adjustment for the lower weight ranges was supported by the population PK 
analysis and intensive PK analysis in subjects receiving the recommended dose of ETR. 
ETR exposure with the recommended doses in this population is similar to that observed in older 
paediatric subjects (>6 years old, for which ETR is already authorized) which was to be aligned to that 
of adult patients. In line with the EU guidelines for anti-HIV drug development, efficacy demonstration 
in HIV infected adults is not required to be duplicated for paediatric claim as soon as similar exposure 
to adults could be achieved to predict similar efficacy and safety. 
In subjects between 2 to 6 years old (Cohort I), 80% of the 20 subjects have achieved viral load <400 
c/ml at Week 48. Therefore, a combination of 2 NRTIs + ETR recommended dose + another active ARV 
(usually PI or raltegravir) may be effective in ARV experienced paediatric subjects. These results were 
achieved while 11 on 20 subjects had required an adjusted dose so that finally be treated according to 
the recommended dose.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
It should be considered that conclusions on favourable effects were drawn from a very low number of 
subjects. In addition, the findings in some children shed some doubts on the adequate use of the drug 
in young children.  
When having in mind that 11 children required dose adjustment to the recommended dose and 16 
required dose adjustment to ETR dose or higher, this could indicate that 5 subjects in this cohort 
required a higher dose than the recommended dose for achieving adequate PK exposure.  
While the PK parameters in the cohort II (1y/o to <2 y/o) were not that far from those in cohort I and 
6 subjects in cohort II received the recommended ETR dose or higher, 5 on the 6 patients in cohort II 
did not achieve virologic success.

While the low response rate discouraged the applicant for any claim in the corresponding cohort II age 
strata, such finding needs to be scrutinized, since this shed doubts for the adequate use of the drug in 
children close to the lower age limit of the cohort I age strata.  
The mode of administration seems to have a significant impact on the efficacy results: 7/14 subjects 
who took ETR dispersed in liquid (including 4 subjects aged between 1-2 years old) experienced 
virologic failure, vs 0/6 subjects who swallowed the ETR tablet whole. This may explain the inadequate 
rate of virologic response in the youngest subjects (Cohort II). Furthermore, PK data has reported a 
statistically higher ETR exposure in children who swallowed the tablets whole (mean ETR AUC12h: 
10721 ng.h/ml) compared to those who took the tablets dispersed in liquid (mean ETR AUC12h: 2841 
ng.h/ml, p<0.001). 
The applicant discussed this issue and concluded that the lower ETR exposure might still be compatible 
with a virologic response. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, it is acknowledged that this study is not designed to substantiate clinical efficacy in subjects 
<6 years old.  
Considering the PK data, no overexposure of ETR is expected is subjects <6 years of age receiving the 
recommended ETR doses.  
AEs considered related to ETR were lipase increase (n=2), ALT increase (n=1), vomiting (n=1) and 
platelet count decreased (n=1). As expected, rash and other skin events were commonly observed 
(69% of all subjects) although none was considered related to ETR. Two hepatic events were observed, 
both in Cohort II (1-<2 years old). In Cohort I (2-<6 years old), 2 lipase increases, both considered 
Assessment report  
EMA/175628/2020  
Page 83/86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
related to ETR, were observed, including one Grade 4 leading to discontinuation. No symptoms of 
pancreatitis were observed.  
Rash, ALT increase and lipase increase are known AEs observed with ETR. No new AEs was observed. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The number of subjects and the duration of ETR exposure are too limited to adequately substantiate 
the clinical safety of ETR in this paediatric population. At least no trend for a differential safety pattern 
seems to be identified. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
As above discussed, the need of a triple class regimen with ETR (NNRTI) plus a boosted PI plus a third 
agent clearly limits the potential use in younger children, where NNRTI and boosted PI are preferably 
introduced sequentially to spare the subsequent lines of treatment in this chronic disease. However, 
still a medical need can be observed in EU given notably the migrant population from Africa where 
nevirapine was used in vertical transmission with emergence of NNRTI resistance. Given that ETR is 
shown to maintain activity in presence of some NNRTI RAM, it is expected to be of potential interest in 
children.  
Based on PK data, from intensive PK sampling and from POP PK modelling, ETR exposure is expected 
to be similar between the paediatric subjects 2-<6 years old and 6-<18 years old, and within the AUC 
range considered to be effective and safe (i.e. 60%-150% of the mean ETR AUC in adults).  
AEs associated to Intelence are mainly gastrointestinal disorders and skin rash, with Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome (SJS) which were reported at a higher incidence (1%) in paediatric subjects (6-18 years 
old) in a pos-tmarketing retrospective cohort than has been reported in adult clinical trials. Of note, no 
SJS were reported in the study TMC125-C234. Other severe cutaneous and hypersensitivity reactions 
were reported with Intelence. Transaminase and lipase increase were also reported. 
However, the need for higher dose than the recommended in some children and the fact that the 
method of administration seems to significantly influence ETR PK parameters, with lower ETR exposure 
and consequently higher rate of virologic failure when ETR tablets are dispersed into liquid (main 
method of administration for subjects <6 years of age) is a source of concern. Also having in mind that 
the use of ETR in children from 1 to <2 years of age is considered inadequate so shedding also doubt 
for the use in the lower age limit of the claimed age strata.  
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Considering that the targeted ETR exposure is obtained with the recommended ETR doses in paediatric 
subjects from 2 to 6 years old, the benefits provided by Intelence (i.e. to obtain a virologic suppression 
in ART-experienced subjects with virologic failure), coadministered with 2 NRTIs and a boosted PI, 
outweigh the potential risks associated to Intelence (i.e. mainly rash and severe hypersensitivity 
reactions, and also emergence of NNRTI-RAM).

The RMP (version 13.1) of the product has been updated to remove the completed additional 
pharmacovigilance activities (TMC125-C234/P1090 (Week 48) and TMC125-EPPICC) from the 
pharmacovigilance plan of the RMP). The RMP has also been updated to meet the requirements and 
updated definitions in the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Guideline on good pharmacovigilance 
practices (GVP) Module V Revision 2 (EMA/838713/2011; Rev 2) and Guidance on the format of the 
RMP in the European Union (EMA/164014/2018 Rev 2.0.1) including proposed removal of safety 
concerns. The PRAC agreed with version 13.1 of the RMP. 
The MAH took the opportunity to update section 4.5 of the SmPC to remove the interactions with 
Nefinavir, Boceprevir and Simeprevir and to include some typographic changes in Annex II C and D.

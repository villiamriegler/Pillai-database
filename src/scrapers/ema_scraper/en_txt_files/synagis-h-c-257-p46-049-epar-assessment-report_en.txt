1.  Introduction 
In January 2017, the MAH submitted the completed post-marketing observational paediatric study 
P10-410 (PMOS GERM 06-01) entitled "Prospective, non-interventional observation study for the use of 
palivizumab in high-risk children in Germany" in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has been provided. 
The MAH states, that the safety and effectiveness of this study is consistent with the previously 
established benefit risk profile of Synagis and does not recommend any changes to the SmPC. 
Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that: 
P10-410 (PMOS GERM 06-01) entitled "Prospective, non-interventional observation study for the use of 
palivizumab in high-risk children in Germany", is a stand-alone study and does not form part of a 
development programme. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study. 
Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1κ) specific for the fusion protein (F-protein) of 
RSV that has potent neutralizing and fusion-inhibitory activity against a broad range of RSV isolates. 
Based on clinical studies in preterm infants and children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia the product 
was licensed in the US in 1998 and in the EU in 1999. Further studies were subsequently conducted in 
different patient groups. The pharmaceutical formulation used in the study was the lyophilized 
formulation of palivizumab. 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
Synagis is approved for the prevention of serious lower-respiratory-tract disease requiring 
hospitalisation caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children at high risk for RSV disease: 
•  Children born at 35 weeks of gestation or less and less than six months of age at the onset of 
the RSV season; 
•  Children less than two years of age and requiring treatment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia 
(BPD) within the last six months; 
•  Children less than two years of age and with haemodynamically significant congenital heart 
disease (CHD).

1.3.2.  Description 
Methods 
Objective 
Post-marketing observational study (PMOS) to describe comprehensive real-world data on the use of 
palivizumab in high-risk subjects in Germany, to collect data on palivizumab administration, frequency 
of hospitalisations ,  drug adherence, and risk factors for RSV disease. 
Study design 
Observational, non-randomized, longitudinal, single-arm, multi-center, cohort study to assess the 
safety and effectiveness of palivizumab immunoprophylaxis in children from 2002 – 2016 in preterm 
infants or infants born with hs-CHD.  
Primary care pediatricians from outpatient facilities and neonatologists from inpatient facilities in 
Germany contributed data to the registry. 
The key recorded study variables were: Demographic data, geographic location, risk factors for RSV 
disease, diagnoses and RSV testing, RSV hospitalization (admission dates, length of stay, ICU 
admission, supplemental oxygen required, and mechanical ventilation), palivizumab administrations 
(dates, weight of infant and dose), adverse reactions, and parents' compliance to RSV use. 
Inclusion Criteria 
The inclusion criteria were as stated in the palivizumab EU Summary of Product Characteristics:   
•  Subjects born at 35 weeks of gestation or less and less than 6 months of age at the 
 onset of the RSV season. 
•  Subjects less than 2 years of age and requiring treatment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia 
(BPD resp. chronic lung disease (CLD)) within the last 6 months. 
•  Subjects less than 2 years of age and with hemodynamically significant congenital heart 
disease (hsCHD). 
Exclusion Criteria 
The exclusion criteria were as stated in the palivizumab EU Summary of Product characteristics: 
•  Subjects with known hypersensitivity to palivizumab or any component of the formulation, or 
other humanized monoclonal antibodies. 
Characteristics (SmPC): Study population: 
A total of 142,723 injections were documented in 29,468 evaluable subjects during the study period, 
2002-2016. Results of the study were subdivided into three parts due to procedural changes including 
changes in the methods of study data reporting: 
i)  Seasons 2002/03 – 2006/07 
i)  Seasons 2007/08 and 2008/09, 
ii)  Seasons 2009/10 – 2015/16. 
Statistical Methods: 
As this was a descriptive study, summary statistics are provided.

Results 
Mean age of subjects upon start of immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab was between 4.3 and 5.9 
months; overall 54% of infants were males, 46% female. Median number of palivizumab 
immunoprophylaxis injections for all study seasons was 5 (range: 1 – 12). The proportion of subjects 
that received more than 5 palivizumab injections during the corresponding RSV season ranged from 
35% to 45%.   
Most evaluable subjects were premature (median gestational age, 29-32 weeks).  A significant 
proportion of subjects across the three study periods (19% – 43%) had BPD. Across the three study 
periods, between 25% and 35% of infants were diagnosed with CHD. A significant proportion of 
subjects across the three study groups were diagnosed with CLD (19% – 43%). 
In 2004 the German regulatory agency added hs-CHD  to the list of approved  indications for 
palivizumab. Starting in 2008/09, the investigators could indicate whether hs-CHD was the main 
reason for prophylaxis; this was documented in 13% – 14.1% of patients.  
The average number of RSV-related hospitalizations in infants with CHD diagnosis was 0.8% (n = 26). 
The RSV-related hospitalization rates over the three study periods were 0.7% – 1.6%. These rates are 
within the expected margins derived from prospective randomized trials. 
Safety results 
Overall, 839 adverse events (AEs) were reported. The most frequent serious adverse events (≥ 5% of 
subjects) were: bronchitis (12%), hospitalization (11%), pneumonia (11%), respiratory syncytial virus 
bronchiolitis (8%) and pneumonia respiratory syncytial viral infection (5%). 
Of note, a hospitalization was by definition considered a serious criterion, and not an event term. Thus, 
the term "hospitalization" was only coded if no other event term was documented in the reporting 
form, or if the event was assessed as "non-serious" or as "no case." The majority of AEs were 
categorized as serious (95.8% of all reported events), which may be due to a potential underreporting 
of non-serious events. 
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
No new efficacy or safety concerns are identified. The effectiveness and safety observed in this large 
observational study is in agreement with the registration trials and with other observational studies.  
1.4.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The submitted post-marketing paediatric study P10-410 in accordance with article 46 of the Paediatric 
Regulation, is in agreement with the currently approved SMPC and no further regulatory action is 
deemed necessary.  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

Update of section 4.8 of the ProQuad and M-M-
RVaxpro SmPC to clarify that in severely 
immunocompromised individuals inadvertently 
vaccinated with measles-containing vaccine, measles 
inclusion body encephalitis, pneumonitis, and fatal 
outcome as a direct consequence of disseminated 
measles vaccine virus infection have been reported; 
disseminated mumps and rubella vaccine virus

encephalitis, pneumonitis and death as a direct 
consequence of disseminated measles vaccine virus 
infection have been reported post-marketing in severely

contraindication - vaccinated with measles-containing 
vaccines. As a consequence, the existing statement in the 
product information concerning encephalitis and 
encephalopathy was clarified.

Pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, the European Commission requested on 
15 March 2012, the opinion of the CHMP further to 
the evaluation of the most recent published data and 
post marketing surveillance regarding the 
vaccination with measles, mumps, rubella and 
varicella vaccines in pregnant women and 
immunocompromised subjects. The CHMP was 
requested to assess the impact thereof on the risk-
benefit balance of M-M-RVAXPRO in these specific 
populations and to give its opinion whether the 
marketing authorisation of this product should be 
maintained, varied, suspended or withdrawn.

Measures (FUMs) that have been approved by the CHMP 
and given that the MAH  commits to submit the data 
requested in the ongoing follow-up measures (FUMs that 
have not been fulfilled yet), it can be concluded that the 
product M-M-RVAXPRO conforms to the current CHMP 
quality guidelines. No change in the immunogenicity profile 
or efficacy of M-M-RVAXPRO was observed in clinical trials 
conducted since initial marketing authorisation. With 
respect to safety data no new specific safety concern was 
raised in clinical trials. The safety results provided in the 
PSUR data did not indicate any new safety signal or new 
adverse events, which are not covered in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC.  Based on the data available the benefit/risk balance 
of M-M-RVAXPRO remains positive. The proposed SmPC, 
PIL and labelling were endorsed by the CHMP. The CHMP is 
of the opinion that the renewal can be granted with 
unlimited validity.

RVAXPRO with Prevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine 
based on 4 clinical studies (P019, P066, P067 and 
P057). Section 2 of the PL was updated accordingly.  
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to modify 
approval for the concomitant administration of MM-
RVAXPRO with Prevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine. 
Based on studies conducted with ProQuad (measles, 
mumps, rubella, and varicella virus vaccine) and M-M-RII/

data analysed (protocols P019, P066, P067 and P057) 
confirmed that M-M-RVAXPRO can be administered 
concomitantly with hepatitis A vaccine (VAQTA) and 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar-Pneumococcal 
7-valent conjugate vaccine) without impairing antibody 
responses to measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis A, or the 
serotypes of S. pneumoniae included in pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine. The data also demonstrated that the 
concomitant administration of M-M-RVAXPRO with hepatitis 
A vaccine and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine had an 
acceptable safety profile. The results were appropriated to 
support concomitant administration of M-M-RVAXPRO with 
hepatitis A vaccine and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. 
The vaccine demonstrated a favorable benefit/risk profile, 
and the proposed prescribing information for M-M-
RVAXPRO was supported by the data analysed.  
No safety concern was established by the concomitant use 
of ProQuad/MMRVAXPRO, VAQTA and Prevenar.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and

M -M-RVAXPO the CHMP agreed to include the adverse 
events pneumonia and epididymitis in the EU Product 
Information. 
Epididymitis is a common complication of infection by wild 
mumps virus and it was considered biologically possible 
that a small number of patients may develop similar 
complications after vaccination. In reviewing the 
spontaneous reports, from market introduction up until 10 
September 2007, with more than 550 million doses 
distributed worldwide, 13 cases of epididymitis were 
identified that could be temporally associated with the 
administration of the M-M-R vaccine. 
Pneumonia is a common complication of infection by wild 
measles virus. After vaccination with any live virus vaccine, 
it is biologically possible that very few patients may 
develop respiratory complications ranging from mild upper 
respiratory infections to pneumonia. Reviewing the 
spontaneous reports, there were 7 cases of pneumonia 
temporally associated with the administration of M-M-R II, 
the nationally authorised predecessor vaccine to M-M-
RVAXPRO produced using human serum albumin. The 
CHMP therefore agreed to include these events in the 
Product Information.

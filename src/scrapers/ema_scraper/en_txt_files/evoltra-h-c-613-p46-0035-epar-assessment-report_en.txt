Introduction 
Clofarabine  is  currently  approved,  as  a  single  agent,  for  the  treatment  of  acute  lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL) in paediatric patients who have relapsed or are refractory after receiving at least two 
prior  regimens  and  where  there  is  no  other  treatment  option  anticipated  to  result  in  a  durable 
response.  The  recommended  dose  is  52 mg/m2  of  body  surface  area  administered  by  intravenous 
infusion over 2 hours daily for 5 consecutive days. 
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 190112006, the MAH submitted a report for Study 
CL021800205: a Phase 1/2 dose-escalation study designed to characterize the feasibility, safety, and 
efficacy  of  clofarabine  in  combination  with  etoposide  and  cyclophosphamide  in  refractory  or  relapsed 
ALL and AML (Phase 1 only) paediatric patients. 
The primary objective of the phase 1 was to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting 
toxicity  (DLT),  and  the  recommended  Phase  2  dose  (RP2D)  of  clofarabine  when  used  in  combination 
with etoposide and cyclophosphamide. 
The phase II of the study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of Clofarabine with 
Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide at the recommended Phase 2 dose in ALL paediatric patients.  
The  combined  regimen  at  the  R2PD  was  associated  with  a  very  high  toxicity  as  evidenced  by  the 
80.0%  patients  who  experienced  at  least  1  related  SAE  and  the  3  cases  of  veno-occlusive  disease 
(VOD) reported in the phase II study (4 cases were also reported during the phase I period).   
Following the 3 cases of VOD reported in the phase II, CL021800205 study protocol was amended in 
order  to  exclude  patients  who  previously  underwent  HSCT.  This  amendment  raised  into  question  the 
feasibility of HSCT in children who received the combination with R2PD.  
Thus, the MAH was requested to provide results regarding procedures and outcome of HSCT, from ALL 
studies investigating the new combined regimen. 
MAH Response  
The studies in ALL with the regimen clofarabine, etoposide and cyclophosphamide are CLO21800205 
and VHR Pilot (CLO08808). 
CLO21800205 
PHASE 1 : 
In this phase, 10 patients (40.0%) underwent HSCT, including 7 patients with ALL and 3 patients with 
AML. 
Of these 10 patients, 3 patients received bone marrow stem cells, 2 patients received peripheral blood 
stem cells, and 5 patients received cord blood stem cells. Of the patients receiving bone marrow stem 
cells,  2  received  allogeneic  bone  marrow  with  6/6  antigen  match  and  1  received  matched  unrelated 
donor bone marrow with  9/10 antigen match. Both patients who received peripheral blood stem cells 
were a 10/10 antigen match. One of these patients received two allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell 
transplants  within  a  nine-month  interval.  Five  patients  received  cord  blood  stem  cells  with  antigen 
matches ranging from 4/6-6/6. Out of the 10 patients, 7 received total body preparative radiotherapy 
and for 8 patients G-CSF or GM-CSF was used.

For  the  cellularity  of  the  infused  graft:  CD34+  ranged  from  3-71x106/kg  recipient  weight  and 
nucleated cell count from 2.67-11.17x108/kg recipient weight.  
Six  patients  had  CR,  3  patients  CRp  and  1  patient  had  progressive  disease  as  best  investigator 
response.  The  average  OS  is  55.96  weeks  and  the  average  initial  poststudy  transplant  survival,  the 
time from date of initial post-study transplant to date of death, or if the patient is still alive, censoring 
at date of last known follow-up visit, is 55.07 weeks. Two patients were alive at last follow-up.  
Eight  patients  had  post-transplant  AEs:  29  infections,  1  hepatic  VOD  grade  4,  1  multiorgan  failure,  2 
cardiac  arrests,  1  moderate  liver  lesions,  4  Graft  Versus  Host  Disease  (GVHD),  1  hemorrhage 
pulmonary, 2 acute distress syndromes and 1 platelet transfusion reaction.  
In total, 4 patients developed acute GVHD (3 grade 1-2 and 1 grade 3-4). One patient recovered from 
GVHD and one patient had a mixed response. Two patients developed chronic GVHD. Of the 2 patients 
with chronic GVHD, 1 patient initially developed grade 2 acute GVHD which subsequently improved to 
grade  1.  The  second  patient  experienced  two  separate  episodes  of  acute  GVHD  (grade  1-2).  Both 
patients eventually established a stable disease.  
PHASE 2: 
In this phase, 10 patients (40.0%) underwent HSCT, of which all had ALL. 
Of these 10 patients, 4 patients received bone marrow stem cells, 3 patients received peripheral blood 
stem cells, and 3 patients received cord blood stem cells. Of the patients receiving bone marrow stem 
cells, 1 received allogeneic bone marrow with 10/10 antigen match and 3 received matched unrelated 
donor  bone  marrow  with  6/6,  10/10  and  as  reported  on  the  CRF  a  1.0  antigen  match.  Two  patients 
who received peripheral blood stem cells were a 10/10 antigen match. The antigen match of the third 
patient  is  unknown.  Three  patients  received  cord  blood  stem  cells;  two  with  antigen  matches  of  4/6 
and 5/6. Out of the 10 patients, 5 received total body preparative radiotherapy and for 8 patients G-
CSF or GM-CSF was used. For the cellularity of the infused graft: CD34+ ranged from 2.6-9.8 x 106/kg 
recipient weight and nucleated cell count from 0.11-18.42 x 108/kg recipient weight.  
Four patients had CR, 3 patients CRp, 2 patients had partial remission and 1 patient was not evaluable 
as  best  investigator  response.  The  average  OS  is  55.17  weeks  and  the  average  initial  post-study 
transplant survival is 41.66 weeks. Six patients were alive at last follow-up.  
Nine  patients  had  post-transplant  AEs:  53  infections  or  infection  related  investigations,  4  GVHD,  1 
grade 4 renal failure (acute oliguric renal failure), 1 grade 3 pericardial effusion, 2 hepatic VOD (grades 
3  and  4),  2  multiorgan  failure,  1  pulmonary  hemorrhage,  1  pancytopenia,  1  respiratory  distress,  1 
hepatic insufficiency grade 2, 1 ascites and 1 febrile neutropenia.  
In  total,  4  patients  developed  acute  GVHD  (grades  1-2).  One  patient  recovered  from  GVHD  and  one 
patient  established  a  stable  disease.  The  other  two  patients  developed  chronic  GVHD:  1  patient  had 
GVHD grade 2 and established a stable disease and the other patient had GVHD grade 2 and second 
time initially grade 2 turning into grade 1, establishing partial response.

Two patients (001-0001 and 002-0002) out of the 8 patients enrolled received post study HSCT. Both 
patients received bone marrow stem cells. 
Patient  001-0001  had  an  unrelated  bone  marrow  transplant  with  a  6/6  antigen  match.  The  patient 
underwent  total  body  preparative  radiotherapy.  The  cellularity  of  the  graft  was  2.50  x  106  CD34+ 
cells/kg recipient weight. No G-CSF or GM-CSF was used.  
Patient  002-0002  had  a  related  bone  marrow  transplant  with  a  6/6  antigen  match.  The  patient 
underwent total body preparative radiotherapy. The cellularity of the graft was 57.10 x 108 nucleated 
cells/kg recipient weight and CD 7.76 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg recipient weight. No G-CSF or GM-CSF was 
used. 
Both  achieved  successful  neutrophil  engraftment.  Both  patients  experienced  acute  GVHD,  but 
recovered. 
Neither  patient  reported  other  post-transplant  AEs.  Patient  002-0002  achieved  CR  and  patient  001-
0001 achieved PR (75 days after HSCT and 87 days after HSCT, respectively). Both patients were alive 
at last follow-up. 
MAH Discussion  
Review  of  the  summary  table  above  reveals  the  following  findings.  There  were  a  total  of  22  patients 
who  received  post  study  HSCT.  Ten  of  these  patients  were  alive  at  last  follow  up.  Six  patients  died 
within 100 days of transplant, and 6 others died more than 100 days after transplant. 
The  causes  of  death  for  the  patients  dying  within  100  days  of  transplant  included  3  cases  of  multi-
organ failure, one case each of ARDS and pulmonary hemorrhage and one case unspecified. Significant 
peri-transplant  adverse  events  for  these  6  patients  included  2  cases  of  grade  4  VOD  and  various 
infections (viral, bacterial and fungal). 
Of  the  10  patients  alive  at  last  follow  up,  seven  experienced  events  of  infection.  There  were  32  total 
infectious events in seven patients; 3 patients experienced 2-3 events each and 4 patients experienced 
5-8 events each. Infections occur commonly in patients undergoing HSCT. The nature and severity of 
infections experienced by these patients was consistent with what is expected for allogeneic HSCT. 
The incidence of VOD in the pediatric transplant population has been reported to be in the range of 11–
31%,  with  an  associated  death  rate  of  up  to  50%  (SH  Lee,  et  al.  2010).  In  our  series  of  pediatric 
patients undergoing HSCT following treatment with clofarabine, etoposide and cyclophosphamide, the 
incidence  of  VOD  is  13.6%  (3/22),  with  a  fatality  rate  of  66%  (2/3).  Thus,  there  is  no  evidence  to 
suggest  that  induction  with  clofarabine-containing  regimens  would  preclude  successful  HSCT.  On  the 
contrary,  45%  (10/22)  of  these  patients  were  alive  and  in  CR  at  last  follow  up,  representing  a 
successful outcome in these relapsed/ refractory patients without many therapeutic options. 
GVHD  is  an  expected  outcome  in  allogeneic  HSCT,  and  for  some  malignancies  has  been  linked  to 
therapeutic success through Graft-vs-Leukemia responses. The severity of GVHD is related to type of 
transplant (related vs.  unrelated), cell source (peripheral blood vs. bone marrow vs. cord), degree of 
match  between  recipient  and  donor,  and  GVHD  chemoprophylaxis.  As  these  variables  were  not 
captured  for  each  patient  in  this  series,  it  is  difficult  to  determine  expected  GVHD  rates  for  the 
population. However, of the patients in this series, the reported GVHD experience was generally mild. 
Two  patients  experienced  GVHD  that  was  ≥  grade  3  in  severity,  and  there  were  no  fatal  events  of 
GVHD.

In summary, patients undergoing HSCT following ALL induction regimens containing the combination of 
clofarabine,  etoposide,  and  cyclophosphamide  experience  a  similar  spectrum  of  adverse  events  to 
those  experience  by  patients  undergoing  HSCT  following  other  ALL  induction  regimens.  Patient 
outcomes are promising as well, with several patients alive >2 years post-HSCT. 
Rapporteur’s Overall Conclusion and Recommendation 
58  patients  with  acute  leukaemia  were  enrolled  in  studies  where  they  received  the  combination 
regimen of clofarabine, etoposide and cyclophosphamide. 
22 of these 58 patients (38%) were able to proceed to post study HSCT:  
-  10 out of the 25 patients enrolled in the phase 1 of the study CLO21800205;  
-  10 out of the 25 patients enrolled in the phase 2 of the study CLO21800205; 
-  2 out of the 8 patients enrolled in the study CLO08808. 
13  out  of  the  20  patients  of  phase  ½  study  CLO21800205  who  underwent  HSCT  received  the 
recommended phase 2 dose (dose of the cohort 5 of the phase 1 of the study: Clofarabine (40mg/m2 
D1-5),  Etoposide  (100  mg/m2  D1-5),  Cyclophosphamide  (440  mg/m2  D1-5)).  The  7  remaining 
patients received lower doses of chemotherapy: 2 were from cohort 1, 1 from cohort 2, 1 from cohort 
3 and 3 from cohort 4. 
For the 10 patients of phase 1 of study CLO21800205  who underwent post study HSCT, the average 
OS is 55.96 weeks and the average initial poststudy transplant survival, is 41.93 weeks. Two patients 
were  alive  at  last  follow-up  with  a  post  study  transplant  survival  of  99.1  weeks  and  100.3  weeks 
respectively,  one  was  enrolled  in  cohort  2  and  one  was  enrolled  in  cohort  4,  one  was  suffering  from 
ALL and one was suffering from AML. 
For the 10 patients of phase 2 of study CLO21800205  who underwent post study HSCT, the average 
OS is 55.17 weeks and the average initial post-study transplant survival is 41.66 weeks. Six patients 
were  alive  at  last  follow-up  with  a  post  study  transplant  survival  of  100.6  weeks,  26.6  weeks,  94.6 
weeks, 49.3 weeks, 41.4 weeks and 38 weeks respectively. 
The 2 patients enrolled in the study CLO08808 who underwent HSCT after study were alive at the last 
follow up (respectively 26 weeks and 20 weeks after post study transplant). 
Thus, 10 out of the 22 patients who underwent HSCT were alive at the last follow up (45%). 
Regarding  the  12  remaining  patients,  6  died  within 100  days  of  transplant  included  3  cases  of  multi-
organ  failure,  one  case  of  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome,  one  case  of    pulmonary  hemorrhage 
and one case unspecified.  
The following post-transplant AEs of interest were reported  
-  VOD:  
3 cases of VOD were reported in this series of paediatric patients undergoing HSCT following 
treatment  with  clofarabine,  etoposide  and  cyclophosphamide:  2  cases  of  grade  4  VOD 
(patient 004-0007 and patient 010-0041) and one case of grade 3 VOD (patient 010-0026).  Thus, 
incidence  of  VOD  was  13.6%  (3/22).  A  fatality  rate  of  66%  (2/3)  was  noted.  Two 
patients received RP2 Dose and for 2 patients the graft was from unrelated donors (the type 
of  transplant  was  not  documented  for  the  remaining  patient).  As  states  by  the  MAH,  these 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to Article 46 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/60591/2014  
Page 5/6 
 
 
 
 
 
results  are  in  line  with  the  reported  incidence  and  fatalities  of  VOD  in  the  pediatric  transplant 
population. 
-  GVHD:  
Acute GVHD: 10 patients experienced event of acute GVHD (10/22: 45%). For 2 patients GVHD was 
severe (grade 3) and for the remaining patients the reported event of acute GVHD was mild/moderate. 
For 9 of these patients the graft was from unrelated donors. 
Chronic GVHD: 4 patients experienced events of chronic GVHD, severity grade I/II.= (for 3 patients, a 
previous event of acute GVHD was reported). 
In Conclusion,  
- 
among  the  58  patients  with  acute  leukaemia  enrolled  in  studies  where  they  received  the 
combination  regimen  of  clofarabine,  etoposide  and  cyclophosphamide,  22  (38%)  were  able  to 
proceed to post study HSCT; 
-  10  out  of  the  22  patients  who  underwent  HSCT  were  alive  at  the  last  follow  up  (45%),  with  for 
some patients a prolonged post study transplant survival (more than one year for 4 patients); 
-  Nature  and  incidence  of  post  transplant  AE  reported,  especially  VOD  and  GVHD,  were  consistent 
with was is expected for allogenic HSCT; 
- 
For  the  time  being  and  taking  into  account  the  limited  data  available,  there  is  no  evidence  to 
suggest  that  induction  with  clofarabine-containing  regimens  affect  the  feasibility  of  HSCT  in 
children who received the combination with R2PD.

1.  Introduction 
On 22 December 2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Vimizim (active substance 
recombinant human n-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase; elosulfase alfa; or BMN 110), in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. On July 20th 2017 the response to the 
outstanding issues were received. The assessment of the responses can be found in section 5 and the 
updated overall conclusion and recommendation in section 3 of this report. 
A short clinical overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH submitted the results of study MOR-005: A Multicenter, Multinational, Extension Study to 
Evaluate the Long-Term Efficacy and Safety of BMN 110 in Patients with Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA 
(Morquio A Syndrome). 
Study MOR-004 is the pivotal study which formed the basis for approval (see EPAR). Participants who 
completed MOR-004 were eligible to continue treatment in the 24-week extension study MOR-005 
(part I) and continue up to 240 weeks (part II). 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
MPS IVA is a rare inherited disorder caused by mutations of the gene that codes for the lysosomal 
enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS), which degrades glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) 
including keratan sulfate (KS) and chondroitin sulfate. With insufficient GALNS, GAGs progressively 
accumulate in multiple organs and tissues. The pervasive and progressive accumulation of GAGs leads 
to significant morbidities and multi-systemic clinical impairments resulting in diminished functional 
capacity, decreased endurance, impaired quality of life, and early mortality. The most common 
features of patients with MPS IVA are progressive skeletal dysplasia requiring frequent surgical 
procedures mostly related to musculoskeletal or respiratory dysfunction, and a significant limitation in 
mobility, endurance, and respiratory function. In addition, pain is frequently reported by patients with 
MPS IVA. 
Vimizim is a formulation of elosulfase alfa, which is a purified enzyme produced by recombinant DNA 
technology in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line. Vimizim is an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) 
intended to provide exogenous enzyme GALNS allowing cellular uptake by the mannose-6-phosphate 
receptor and transportation to the lysosomes. This enzyme uptake into the lysosomes promotes 
increased catabolism of KS in tissue macrophages, hyaline cartilage, other connective tissues, and 
heart valve, and reduces the progressive accumulation of KS which is responsible for the clinical 
manifestations of MPS IVA.

Marketing Authorisation was granted for Vimizim (elosulfase alfa; BMN 110) in the European Union on 
28 April 2014.  
At the time of MAA, study MOR-005 was an ongoing phase 3 extension Study to Evaluate the Long-
Term Efficacy and Safety of elosulfase alfa in Patients with Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (Morquio A 
Syndrome). For study MOR-005 data up to week 24 have been assessed during the MAA. Now data up 
to week 168 are submitted. 
No SmPC changes are proposed by the applicant. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study

Description 
Methods 
• 
Study participants  
Individuals with MPS IVA who completed MOR-004, who did not have any conditions that would 
interfere with study completion, and who were expected to be able to comply with the treatment 
schedule, were eligible to participate in this study. 
Rapporteur’s comment 
The methods and patients selection of study MOR004/005 are already described in the initial day 80 
clinical assessment report during the Marketing authorisation application (MAA).  
The included patient population is characteristic for a population of patients suffering from Morquio 
disease. Patients with (stem cell) transplantation are excluded because the transplanted patients are 
capable to produce acetylgalactosamine; thus those patients would not benefit from treatment.  The 
study was limited to patients 5 years of age and over. 
• 
Treatments 
Figure 1 present the design of the MOR-004 and MOR-005 study. The combination of MOR-004 and 
MOR-005 data creates 4 treatment cohorts as described below. Cohorts in Part 1 were: 
  Cohort PBO-QOW: Patients received placebo in MOR-004 and a BMN 110 dose regimen of 2.0 
mg/kg/qow (every other week) in MOR-005 
  Cohort PBO-QW: Patients received placebo in MOR-004 and a BMN 110 dose regimen of 2.0 
mg/kg/qw (every week) in MOR-005

  Cohort QOW-QOW: Patients received BMN 110 dose regimens of 2.0 mg/kg/qow in MOR-004 
and MOR-005 
  Cohort QW-QW: Patients received BMN 110 dose regimens of 2.0 mg/kg/qw in MOR-004 and 
MOR-005 
With the initiation of Part 2 of MOR-005 on 01DEC2012, all patients were transitioned to the 2.0 
mg/kg/qw dosing regimen. 
During Part 1 (the double-blind phase of the study), patients received intravenous (IV) infusions of 
BMN 110 at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg/qw or 2.0 mg/kg/qow until 30NOV2012. Patients randomized to the 
2.0 mg/kg/qow arm received infusions of placebo on alternating weeks, to mask active drug weeks. 
In Part 2 (as of 01DEC2012), all patients receive 2.0 mg/kg/qw for the remainder of the study.

PBO-QOW, Placebo-BMN 110 2.0 mg/kg/qow; PBO-QW, Placebo-BMN 110 2.0 mg/kg/qw; QOW-QOW, BMN 110-BMN 110 2.0 
mg/kg/qow; QW-QW, BMN 110-BMN 110 2.0 mg/kg/qw With the initiation of Part 2 of MOR-005 on 01DEC2012, all subjects were 
transitioned to the 2.0 mg/kg/qw dosing regimen.  
The specific time of transition for each subject depended on date of study enrolment, ranging from Week 39 to Week 96. 
The following BMN 110 manufacturing lots were utilized in the study 
In Part 1, placebo solution was administered IV, at a volume equivalent to that needed for a 2.0 mg/kg 
dose of BMN 110 diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride, on alternating weeks for the 2.0 mg/kg/qow arm to 
mask active drug weeks. Each infusion was administered over a period of approximately 4 hours.

The placebo formulation consisted of the same excipients as, was identical in appearance to, and was 
prepared in the same manner as BMN 110. 
The following placebo manufacturing lots were utilized in the study (note that lot numbers were 
identical to those of BMN 110 to maintain blind):  
Placebo solution is not used in Part 2. 
Rapporteur’s comment 
Note that part 1 of this study was already discussed during the MAA assessment. Therefore, the 
assessment report will mainly focus on the data of part 2 (week 72/48), where relevant the complete 
study data will be taken into account. Results obtained after the completion of part 1 of study MOR005 
indicated that the BMN 110 2.0 mg/kg/qw regimen is superior to placebo (study MOR004) whereas the 
BMN 110 2.0 mg/kg/qow regimen - based on the 6MWT results - could not demonstrate superiority 
over placebo(study MOR 005, part 1). 
The placebo-QW and QW-QW groups are the most relevant groups, the results from these two groups 
will contribute to the knowledge on the long term treatment. 
In the other groups (QOW-QOW and PBO-QOQ) conclusions should be drawn with caution, as these 
groups switched to the approved SmPC dosing not earlier than at the start of part 2 of the study. As 
the specific time of transition for each patient depended on date of study enrolment, ranging from 
Week 39 to Week 96, there is variation in time on a specific dosing. This hampers the assessment of 
the long term effect in these two groups.  
Duration of Treatment: 
Patients receive treatment up to Week 240 or until one of the following occurs: the patient (or their 
parent or legally authorized representative) withdraws consent and the patient discontinues from the 
study or study treatment, the patient is discontinued from the study or study treatment at the 
discretion of the Investigator or BioMarin, or the study is terminated. 
Rapporteur’s comment 
A follow-up of 240 weeks is an acceptable period; any clinically relevant improvement should be 
observable within this interval. 
Study MOR-005 was planned to continue up to Week 240, however it was prematurely terminated by 
the MAH. The timing of the termination as well as justification for this should be provided by the 
applicant (OC).

PIQ 
Safety: 
The safety population consisted of all patients who were enrolled and received at least one dose of 
study drug in MOR-005. The safety population was analysed according to the treatment received and 
for the Total population. All safety analyses are presented based on the safety population. Safety data 
were summarized descriptively by study week. Safety was evaluated by monitoring AEs, changes in 
physical examination, vital signs, laboratory tests, ECGs, ECHOs, immunogenicity tests, and 
concomitant medications after the initial study drug administration. 
A hypersensitivity AE was defined as any AE that coded to a PT included in the Standardized MedDRA 
(v. 16.1) for the Total population) Queries (broad) for anaphylactic reaction and angioedema. To 
obtain the Total population incidence of hypersensitivity AEs, duplicate patient records were deleted.  
In fusion associated reactions (IARs) were defined broadly per protocol any AE occurring after start of 
the infusion and within 1 day following the end of the infusion, regardless of the investigator's 
assessment of relatedness to study drug administration.  
Immunogenicity: 
Routine immunogenicity testing included assays for anti-BMN 110 total TAb, NAb, and anti-BMN 110 
IgE. Serum sample collection for immunogenicity testing was scheduled at Baseline, Weeks 12, and 
every 12 weeks thereafter in Part 1 and every 24 weeks in Part 2. The total antibody assay measures 
multiple anti-drug antibody isotypes in one assay, eliminating the need for multiple isotype-specific 
assays to assess the anti-drug antibody response. 
Pharmacokinetics: 
During this study, pharmacokinetic samples are collected from all Japanese patients to fulfil the 
Japanese health authority request. 
Rapporteur’s comment 
There are many endpoints in this relative small patient population.

The 6MWT, respiratory function, anthropometric measures and the MPS Health Assessment 
Questionnaire together are considered indicative for observing a clinically relevant effect in these 
patients. As elosulfase alfa is a lifelong treatment, the results of these endpoints will be especially 
important in the paediatric population. As these children are still in the development phase, the 
aforementioned endpoints will be indicative whether in the long run these patients will benefit from 
treatment. This benefit should be clinically relevant for these patients, e.g. anthropometric measures 
(z-scores) showing a positive trend or stable trend towards normal values. This also applies to the 
respiratory function, and the patients should have benefit in terms of self-care and mobility. As 
mentioned above, the population that received the 2 mg/kg/QW (QW-QW and PBO-QW) dosing is 
considered the most important population to demonstrate any sustained effect of long-term treatment. 
• 
Sample size 
Planned: up to 175 
Enrolled: 173; 2 patients who completed MOR-004 did not enrol in MOR-005. 
Part 1 of the study was completed on 30NOV2012; 172 patients completed Part 1 (1 patient withdrew 
consent) and remain on study as of the data cut-off date of 04JAN2013. Part 2 was initiated on 
01DEC2012 and was completed on 16JUN2016. 
• 
Statistical methods 
A per-protocol (PP) population was previously used to perform sensitivity analyses for the efficacy 
endpoints in Part 1. The analyses based on the PP population were performed for the abbreviated CSR 
(18 March 2013), but given that the final CSR is based on follow-up of 120 weeks or more for most 
patients, the amount of data omitted in a PP analysis would be large using the same criteria. For this 
reason, a MPP population was defined for this longer term study, replacing the PP population. 
The MPP population was used for this final report to perform sensitivity analysis for the efficacy 
endpoints. The MPP criteria are to omit from the ITT population the following patients from analysis: 
1. Patients with any orthopaedic surgery in the first 120 weeks of MOR-004/005, based on 
medical monitor review. 
2. Patients who were administered less than 80% of dosing within the first 120 weeks of MOR-
004/005. 
In Part 1, available efficacy variables including endurance tests, urine keratan sulfate, RFTs, and 
anthropometric measurements are compared between treatment groups. Due to the nature of this 
ongoing study, all statistical comparisons were for descriptive purposes only.  
Anthropometric measurements assessed at MOR-004 Baseline, Week 24, and every 24 weeks in Part 1 
and Part 2 of MOR-005 were summarized. Normalized standing height (z-score) was computed using 
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) normal population values. Change from Baseline in all 
anthropometric measurements (length, standing height, sitting height, weight) were summarized. 
Graphical displays showing the mean and standard error of the mean were supplied. 
Baseline summaries and safety analysis are descriptive. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables 
consist of mean, standard deviation, median, and range and also include count and percentage for 
categorical variables.

Patients who received any dose of study drug and had any post-treatment safety information were 
included in the safety analysis. Adverse events were coded in accordance with the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA v. 15.0). The number and percentage of patient incidences of all 
AEs, AEs related to study drug, serious adverse events (SAEs), SAEs related to study drug, deaths 
during the study, study drug discontinuations due to an AE, or study withdrawals due to an AE were 
tabulated by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT). Patient listings are provided for 
SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation or study withdrawals. All AE summaries 
include only treatment-emergent AEs reported during the study period. Infusion associated reactions 
are summarized by SOC, PT, and severity. The following safety measures are summarized 
descriptively: concomitant medications, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and immunogenicity 
results. Cervical spine (flexion–extension) X-ray data and results from routine physical examinations 
will be presented as listings. 
Serum samples were collected for immunogenicity testing at Baseline, Week 12, and every 12 weeks 
thereafter in Part 1 and are collected every 24 weeks in Part 2. Routine immunogenicity testing 
includes assays for anti-BMN 110 total antibody (TAb), neutralizing antibody (NAb), which here and 
throughout the document refers to antibodies capable of inhibiting binding of BMN 110 to the cation-
independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor, and anti-BMN 110 immunoglobulin E (IgE). When TAb 
was negative, NAb was not assessed. Anti-BMN 110 IgE, total IgE, complement component 4, and 
serum tryptase were assessed when patients experienced a severe (grade 3 according to CTCAE, 
v.4.0) IAR or an IAR requiring infusion interruption or discontinuation. 
Study MOR-005 includes the same patients, routes of administration, dosage regimens, and safety and 
efficacy assessments as MOR-004. Given these similarities, combining the safety and efficacy data 
from the 2 studies was considered appropriate. 
Rapporteur’s comment 
The applicant proposes to replace the PP criteria reported in the MAA with the MPP criteria which omit 
patients with orthopaedic surgery in the first 120 weeks of MOR-004/005, based on medical monitor 
review and patients who were administered less than 80% of dosing within the first 120 weeks of 
MOR-004/005 from the ITT. In total 55 patients were excluded in the MPP population (Listing 
16.2.3.2).The applicant’s rationale for using a MPP population instead of the PP can be accepted.  
Further, it is acceptable to combine the results of study MOR-004 and MOR-005 as patients, routes of 
administration, dosage regimens, and safety and efficacy assessments were identical. This was already 
accepted during the MAA where the interim results of study MOR-005 were submitted (data up to week 
48).

Baseline data 
There were no meaningful imbalances in the ITT population between the continuous-treatment (QOW-
QOW and QW-QW) cohorts at Baseline in demographic and other baseline characteristics. 
Although some variability in demographic and baseline characteristics was evident, there is no 
indication that the continuous-treatment cohorts in the ITT population were substantially different at 
Baseline in demographic or disease state characteristics, as expected, as nearly all of these patients 
continued into MOR-005. 
There were imbalances in the ITT population between the placebo-switch cohorts at Baseline in 
demographic and other baseline characteristics. Upon re-randomization of the placebo cohort in MOR-
004 (n=59) to either the weekly (n=29) or every other week (n=29) dose regimens in MOR-005, 
imbalances between the MOR-005 cohorts PBO-QOW and PBO-QW were noted in endurance measures 
and age at Week 24 (MOR-005 Week 0). Because this re-randomization was not stratified by age or 
6MWT categories, as was the case at the time of randomization into MOR-004, imbalances of the MOR-
005 placebo-switch cohorts by chance is highly plausible. 
In the continuous-treatment cohorts QOW-QOW and QW-QW, age of study patients at enrolment 
ranged from 5.0 to 49.1 years. Distribution of age groups was generally similar between cohorts. Mean 
age (15.3, 12.8 years) and proportion of males (57.6%, 46.4%) were similar in the QOW-QOW and 
QW-QW cohorts, respectively. In the placebo-switch cohorts PBO-QOW and PBO-QW, age of study 
patients at enrolment ranged from 5.0 to 57.4 years. Mean age (16.7, 13.5 years) and proportion of 
males (51.7%, 37.9%) were higher in the PBO-QOW cohort compared to the PBO-QW cohort, 
respectively. As expected in this patient population, the most commonly represented age group was 5 
to 11 years in each of the 4 cohorts.

Rapporteur’s comment 
As already concluded during the MAA assessment, in the double blind phase of study MOR-004 there 
were imbalances in the placebo controlled groups. After enrolment in MOR-005 part 1 this imbalance 
has been solved for the previous on placebo patients.  The applicant’s interim report (cut off 18 March 
2013), submitted during the MAA, summarizes the results for the entire Part 1 study efficacy data.  
The majority of the patient’s ITT population (n=173) are paediatric patients; 5-11 years, 93/173 
(53.8%); 12-18 years 46/173 (26.6%), over 19 years 31/173 (19.7%). The youngest patient enrolled 
was 5 years old and the eldest 57 years. 
The applicant is requested to submit the baseline data and efficacy results for the paediatric patients 
and paediatric subpopulation separately (OC).   
The applicant is requested to submit the baseline demographics and characteristics for the MPP 
population, paediatric, adult and paediatric subpopulations separately (OC).   
• 
Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy results are first presented for patients who received the same BMN 110 treatment regimen 
from Baseline of the parent study (MOR-004) to Week 48 (QW-QW and QOW-QOW [continuous-
treatment] cohorts), followed by results from patients who switched from placebo treatment in MOR-
004 to BMN 110 treatment in MOR-005 (PBO-QW and PBO-QOW [placebo-switch] cohorts). 
The primary efficacy variable of this extension study was distance walked in a 6MWT, which provides a 
measure for endurance. The 3MSCT, also a measure of endurance, and normalized urine KS were 
secondary efficacy variables. The urine KS measurements were normalized by dividing by urine 
creatinine levels, resulting in μg/mg creatinine units. In Part 1 of MOR-005, the 6MWT and the 3MSCT 
were performed at Week 12 and Week 24, and at 24-week intervals thereafter. Normalized urine KS 
was assessed every 12 weeks. In Part 2 of MOR-005, the 6MWT and 3MSCT were performed at 48-
week intervals; normalized urine KS was assessed every 24 weeks. Endurance tests were performed in 
duplicate (on separate days) and the average of the 2 measurements was used as the score for that 
week. Patients who were physically unable to perform the endurance tests were scored as zero meters 
or stairs/minute.

With the initiation of Part 2 (01DEC2012), all patients in QOW-QOW cohort began receiving BMN 110 
2.0 mg/kg weekly; the specific time of transition for each patient depended on date of study 
enrolment, ranging from Week 39 to Week 96 (Figure 1). 
6MWT: 
For Part 1, patients showed sustained improvement in 6MWT distance through Weeks. The interim 
report (18MAR2013) summarizes results for the Part 1. Continued treatment with weekly BMN 110 in 
MOR-005 Part 2 demonstrated further improved 6MWT results for the Total population in the ITT 
population (n=173) (Figure 2) and for the MPP population (n=124) (Figure 3). Mean (SE) change from 
baseline in 6MWT distance over 168 weeks for ITT and MPP populations are shown. Not all patients 
reported results for all time points (including MOR-005 Week 0); the number of patients with data 
available are shown for each time point. Discussion of data after Week 168 is not included due to the 
relatively low number of patients that continued on the study after Week 168. 
Table 3 displays a descriptive summary of the 6MWT distance change from baseline for the ITT 
population. A descriptive summary of the 6MWT distance change from baseline for MPP population are 
provided in Table 4. 
The main reason reported for not performing the tests was that the patients were physically unable to 
perform them. Patients who could not complete a 6MWT (including the primary reason) are presented 
by time point. The primary reasons for failing to complete a test were fatigue and pain. For patients 
that used walking aids, they were required to use the same type of walk aid throughout the study to 
avoid adding uncontrolled variation and introducing bias in estimation of treatment effect.

b With start of Part 2 of MOR-005 (01DEC2012), patients in QOW-QOW cohort began receiving 2.0 mg/kg weekly; the specific time

no Week 48 endurance assessment in Part 2. 
In the PBO-QW cohort of the ITT population, the mean change in 6MWT distance from MOR-004 
Baseline was 4.0 (±68.48) meters at Week 36 and 15.0 (±83.78) meters at Week 48. 
Results in patients previously treated with placebo in MOR-004 are difficult to interpret for several 
reasons. Patients who had received placebo in MOR-004 were randomized without stratification to BMN 
110 for Part 1 of MOR-005, resulting in a substantial between-cohort imbalance in age and endurance 
measures at Week 24. The numbers of patients in the placebo-switch cohorts at Week 48 were only 
half the size of the continuous-treatment cohorts. The overall small sample sizes resulted in large 
standard errors and overlapping confidence intervals. In addition, during MOR-005, 3 patients in the 
PBO-QW group experienced lower limb fracture (n=1) and orthopaedic surgeries (n=2) which may 
have skewed the group mean test results, as evidenced by substantial differences between results 
from the ITT and MPP analyses.

Rapporteur’s comment 
General remark: the figures in the dossier are difficult to interpret, as no clearly distinctive legend is 
used as in the published results of this study Hendriksz et al. (2016). For clarity the figures (A and B) 
from this publication have been inserted below.

It is important to realise that in part 2 (start at week 72/48) all patients were switched to 2.0 mg/kg 
QW dose (approved per SmPC), however this transition was not at a prespecified time point but varied 
per patient. This complicates the assessment of the treatment effect for those patients on the QOW 
regimen (e.g. QOW-QOW and PBO-QOW). Therefore, conclusions in these two groups should be drawn 
with caution. For the assessment of the long term effects the patients that received the 2 mg/kg/QW 
and those switched from placebo to QW dosing are considered most important. The long term data in 
the QW-QW groups seems to indicate that with continued treatment the effect on the 6MWT somewhat 
declines. In the placebo-QW group a similar trend is observed. 
Further, the assessment of the (long term) 6MWT and 3MSCT data is hampered, as submitted data 
appear not to be corrected for age and gender. At baseline the mean (SD) for the 6MWT was 209.5 
(74.0) meter. As such it is unknown whether the observed improvements for 6MWT approximately 50 
meters (mean change) are due to treatment or whether other confounding factors (“training effect” or 
patient’ s growth) contribute to this effect. Note that patients were required to use their walking aids 
(if applicable) throughout the study.   
In addition, it should be noted that the presented data in the figures are a mean value for the total 
study population (n=173, all age groups). The applicant is requested to submit analyses for 6MWT 
corrected for age and gender (using z-scores (Z-6MWT)). As the QW-QW and placebo-QW groups are 
considered the most relevant populations (see above), these analyses should be submitted for these 
two groups only. These data should be compared to the normalized 6MWT in healthy peers (OC). 
The applicant is requested to discuss whether there are patient characteristics that could help to 
determine if a patient could be a non-responder to elosulfase alfa treatment. The applicant should 
explore the possibility to include stopping rules in the SmPC for those patients not benefitting from 
treatment (anymore) (OC). 
The applicant is requested to also plot the results of the treated population as well as the natural 
history population as z-scores of the 6MWT, FEV1, standing height and, growth velocity. For each 
measurement a separate graph should be submitted. For the growth velocity the applicant should plot 
the actual data against the CDC growth and the published MPS IV growth curves (OC).  
Furthermore, it is of scientific and clinical interest to verify whether there is an association between the 
6MWT, lung capacity and MPS HAQ. The applicant is requested to submit these analyses (OC). 
3MSCT: 
For Part 1, patients showed sustained improvement in 3MSCT through Week 36. The interim report 
(18MAR2013) summarizes results for the Part 1. Continued treatment with weekly BMN 110 in Part 2 
of MOR-005 further improved 3MSCT results for the Total population for the ITT population (n=176) 
(Figure 11.4.1.2.2) and for the MPP population (n=124) (Figure 11.4.1.2.2). Mean (SE) change from 
baseline in 3MSCT over 168 weeks for the ITT and MPP populations are shown. Not all patients 
reported results for all time points (including MOR-005 Week 0); the number of patients with data 
available are shown for each time point. Discussion of data after Week 168 is not included due to the 
relatively low number of patients that continued in the study after Week 168. 
Table 5 displays a descriptive summary of the 3MSCT rate change from baseline for the ITT population. 
A descriptive summary of the 3MSCT rate change from baseline for MPP population are provided in 
Table 6.

The main reason reported for not performing the tests was that the patients were physically unable to 
perform. Patients who performed but could not complete a 3MSCT (including the primary reason) are 
presented by time point. The primary reasons for failing to complete a test were fatigue and pain.

MOR-005). 
Rapporteur’s comment 
The beneficial effects on the 3MSCT seen in study MOR-004 are confirmed in this study. The clinical 
relevance of the observed improvement remains to be established. The figures A and B below are 
taken from Hendriksz et al. (2016) for clarity. 
In part 2 all patients were switched to 2 mg/kg QW treatment, however the transition occurred at 
different time points. Therefore, conclusions for the QOW-QOW and PBO-QOW groups can only be 
drawn cautiously. For the QW-QW population there seems to be a sustained effect on the 3MSCT, 
similar for the PBO-QW population. However, it is to be noted that this is a mean of the overall 
population. The applicant does not seem to have taken into account the difference in age groups and 
gender.

Urine keratan sulfate 
For Part 1, patients showed sustained reduction in urine KS through Weeks 36 (Figure 6). The interim 
CSR (18MAR2013) summarizes results for the Part 1. Continued treatment with weekly BMN 110 in 
Part 2 of MOR-005 resulted in further reduction in normalized urine KS for the Total ITT population 
(n=176) (Figure 11.4.1.3.1), and for the MPP population (n=124) (Figure 11.4.1.3.2). Mean (SE) 
percent change from baseline in normalized urine KS over 168 weeks for the ITT and MPP populations 
are shown. Not all patients reported results for all time points (including MOR-005 Week 0); the 
number of patients with data available are shown for each time point. Since patients transitioned to 
Part 2 with a variable amount of BMN 110 treatment and follow-up, over the range Weeks 39 through 
96 (MOR005 Week 15–72), a large percentage of patients were not required to be assessed at Week 
60 (MOR005 Week 36) for urine KS.  
Discussion of data after Week 168 is not included due to the relatively low number of patients that 
continued on the study after Week 168. 
Table 7 displays a descriptive summary of normalized urine KS percent change from baseline for the 
ITT population (Table 14.2.3.1). A descriptive summary of normalized urine KS percent change from 
baseline for the for MPP population are provided in Table 8. 
Patients in both the Total ITT and the MPP populations continued to show sustained reduction in urine 
KS through Week 168. The slight increase starting at Week 144 and continuing to Week 168 may have 
been due to the decrease in sample size at Week 144 and further decrease at Week 168. The reduction 
in normalized urine KS was similar for the Total ITT and MPP populations because, unlike endurance 
measures, normalized urine KS is not influenced by factors such as orthopaedic surgeries. 
Descriptive summaries using the ITT population (Figure 6 [mean change], and for the MPP population 
(Figure 7 [mean change]) yielded results consistent with the mean percent change from baseline 
results.

c Week 48 endurance assessment results included only patients who reached Week 48 while in Part 1 of the study as there was n o 
Week 48 assessment in Part 2. This led to a reduced sample size at Week 48. Since patients transitioned to Part 2 with a variable 
amount of BMN 110 treatment and follow-up, over the range Weeks 39 – 96 (MOR005 Week 15 – 72), a large percentage of 
patients were not required to be assessed at Week 60 (MOR005 Week 36) for uKS.

Rapporteur’s comment 
The results obtained for KS further support the observation that with continued elosulfase alfa 
treatment the pharmacodynamic effect is maintained. 
Patients previously on placebo treatment in MOR-004 who switched to active treatment in MOR-005, 
showed a similar reduction for KS as those patients on active treatment in MOR-005, thus confirming 
the pharmacodynamic activity of elosulfase alfa. 
Respiratory Function Tests (RFTs): 
In Part 1 of MOR-005, the RFTs were performed at Week 24 and at Week 48. Patients sustained 
numerical improvements in all RFTs (MVV, FET, FEV1, FIVC) that had been achieved in MOR-004. The 
interim CSR (18MAR2013) summarizes results for the Part 1.  
The number of patients in each cohort with Week 48 assessments was approximately half than at 
Baseline due to the change in RFT assessment schedule with the transition to Part 2 of MOR-005. RFTs 
were performed every 48 weeks in MOR-005 Part 2. Not all patients reported results for all time points 
(including MOR-005 Week 0); the number of patients with data available are shown for each time 
point. Discussion of data after Week 168 is not included due to the relatively low number of patients 
that continued on the study after Week 168. 
Long-term data for the Total population (ITT and MPP) shows numerical improvements in RFTs from 
MOR-004 baseline and sustained over time.  
Patients who did not perform the RFT (including the primary reason) are listed (the primary reason for 
patients not performing the RFTs was insufficient developmental maturity).  
Patients who could not complete the RFTs are presented by time point.  
Maximum Voluntary Ventilation 
Results for the Total population (ITT and MPP) are as follows: Mean percent changes (±SD) from MOR-
004  Baseline  in  MVV  at  Week  48  for  ITT  (n=63)  and  for  the  MPP  population  (n=41)  were  8.5% 
(±32.08) and 2.5% (±23.05), respectively. At Week 72, values for the ITT population (n=144) and for 
the  MPP  population  (n=111)  were  10.9%  (±32.48)  and  9.6%  (±28.97),  respectively.  At  Week  120 
values for the ITT population (n=133) and for the MPP population (n=106) were 11.1% (±51.61) and 
5.7% (32.62), respectively. At Week 168 values for the ITT population (n=67) and for the Total MPP 
population (n=53) were 7.1% (±30.11) and 7.7% (±31.74), respectively. 
Forced Vital Capacity 
Mean percent changes (±SD) from  MOR-004 Baseline in FVC at Week 48 (n=71), Week 72 (n=157), 
Week  120  (n=147),  and  Week  168  (n=71)  for  the  Total  ITT  population  were  3.2%  (±12.62),  7.3% 
(±16.57),  9.4%  (±21.33),  and  14.5%  (±24.90),  respectively.  The  descriptive  summaries  show  that 
with  continued  treatment  with  BMN  110  in  MOR-005,  numerical  improvement  in  FVC  was  sustained 
over time in the Total ITT population. 
Forced Expiratory Time 
Mean percent changes (±SD) from MOR-004 Baseline in FET at Week 48 (n= 69), Week 72 (n=151), 
Week 120 (n=140), and Week 168 (n=64) for the Total ITT population were 22.9% (±128.91), 29.0

(±89.25), 50.9% (±190.78), and 69.1% (±121.15), respectively. The descriptive summaries show 
that with continued treatment with BMN 110 in MOR-005, numerical improvement in FET was

(±35.97), 21.2% (±151.51), and 11.9% (±26.71), respectively. The descriptive summaries show that 
with continued treatment with BMN 110 in MOR-005, numerical improvement in FIVC was sustained 
over time in the Total ITT population. 
Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second 
Mean percent changes (±SD) from MOR-004 Baseline in FEV1 at Week 48 (n= 71), Week 72 (n=156), 
Week 120 (n=147), and Week 168 (n=71) for the Total ITT population were 2.9% (±12.58), 6.2% 
(±19.27), 8.3% (±24.79), and 9.9% (±25.00), respectively. The descriptive summaries (see also 
Table 9) show that with continued treatment with BMN 110 in MOR-005, numerical improvement in 
FEV1 was sustained over time in the Total ITT population.

Rapporteur’s comment 
Respiratory function, including MVV, FET, FEV1, FIVC, and FVC, were evaluated. With continued 
elosulfase alfa treatment respiratory function seems to improve numerically. It is expected that an 
improvement in respiratory function would also influence the endurance capacity of a patient (and thus 
a possible contribution to improvement of 6MWT, 3MSCT). However, given the somewhat disappointing 
results for the 6MWT, it is very likely that other pathophysiological features play a role in the observed 
deterioration. This remains unknown. The applicant is requested to submit the predicted values for 
FEV1 and FVC. Further, an analysis should be performed using z-scores. In addition, the applicant 
should plot the mean results for FEV1 and FVC against the data from the natural history population 
(OC). 
Anthropometric measurements: 
Analyses of Normalized Standing Height and Growth Rate 
Results from the interim CSR report (MOR-005, 18MAR2013) suggested that the positive treatment 
effect observed in MOR-004 on normalized standing height and growth rate z-scores in males ≤18 
years and females ≤15 years (i.e., age-restricted) was maintained with longer treatment on the 
weekly regimen of BMN 110. Long-term data summarized in this report show continued positive 
treatment effect in the Total population (ITT and MPP).  
Descriptive Statistics: Normalized Growth Rate and Standing Height Z-Scores In the age-restricted 
population, the MOR-004 Baseline mean (±SD) normalized growth rate z-scores were -0.5 (±0.63; n = 
59) for the ITT population (Table 10) and -0.4 (±0.62; n = 39) for the MPP population (with age 
restriction; restricted to Females age <=15 years and Males age <= 18 years), indicating that both 
treatment groups at Baseline were within 1 standard deviation below normal age-adjusted growth rate 
z-scores. In the Total ITT population (with age restriction), the mean change in normalized growth rate 
z-scores from MOR-004 Baseline was 0.4 (±0.85, n = 59) at Week 24, -0.4 (±0.79, n = 118) at Week 
48, 0.2 (±0.90, n = 57) at Week 72, 0.1 (±1.17, n = 54) at Week 120, and 0.0 (±0.97, n = 33) at 
Week 144. In the Total MPP population (with age restriction), the mean change in normalized growth

rate z-scores from MOR-004 Baseline was 0.4 (±0.82, n = 39 at Week 24, 0.2 (±0.81, n = 38) at 
Week 48, 0.0 (±0.97, n = 39) at Week 72, 0.0 (±1.27, n = 38) at Week 120. and, -0.2 (±0.99, n = 
22) at Week 144. 
Mean (±SD) change in the normalized growth rate z-score from MOR-004 Baseline to Week 24 in the 
age-restricted Total ITT and MPP populations were positive and remained positive at Week 72, and 
Week 120, which is suggestive of a continued trend toward a more normal growth rate with long-term 
treatment. In the Total ITT population, mean change from MOR-004 Baseline to Week 120 in the 
normalized growth rate z-score was also positive. 
In the age-restricted population, the MOR-004 Baseline mean (±SD) normalized standing height z-
scores were -5.5 (± 2.16; n = 123) for the Total ITT population indicating that at Baseline it was more 
than 5 standard deviations below normal age-adjusted standing height z-scores (Table 10). In the ITT 
population (age restricted), the mean change from MOR-004 Baseline was -0.1 (±0.40, n = 122) at 
Week 24, -0.3 (±0.61, n =117) at Week 48, -0.4 (±0.69, n = 116) at Week 72, and -0.7 (±1.03, n = 
112) at Week 120. Normalized standing height z-scores change from baseline were less than 1 SD for 
Week 24 through Week 120 in the age-restricted and Total ITT population.

Rapporteur’s comment 
Note that the data were restricted to females age ≤15 years and males age ≤ 18 years. 
On continued treatment with elosulfase alfa, the anthropologic measures show a normalised growth 
rate, SD between -1 and +1. It appears that in these patients there is no catch up growth.  
Other Anthropometric Measures 
In Part 1, positive changes in the absolute values in most anthropometric measurements were 
observed in patients who received continuous treatment with BMN 110; however, standard deviations 
were large. The mean (±SD) changes in absolute values for the anthropometric measures from MOR-
004 Baseline to Week 48 in the entire ITT population were similar between cohorts. 
Continued treatment with weekly BMN 110 in Part 2 through Week 120 showed similar findings. 
Discussion of data after Week 120 is not included due to the relatively low number of patients that 
continued on the study after Week 120.  
Mean (±SD) changes in absolute values for the Total population: 
 
standing height values at Week 48 (n=158), Week 72 (n=158), and Week 120 (n= 150) were 
1.8 cm (±2.36), 2.5 cm (±2.62), and, 3.5 cm (±3.64), respectively. 
 
sitting height values at Week 48 (n=161), Week 72 (n=161), and Week 120 (n=155) were -
2.3 cm (±11.95), -1.8 cm (±12.82), and, -1.5 cm (±11.61), respectively. 
 
length values at Week 48 (n=157), Week 72 (n=158), and Week 120 (n= 150) were 2.2 cm 
(±2.67), 2.6 cm (±3.52), and 3.6 cm (±9.06), respectively.  
  weight values at Week 48 (n=167), Week 72 (n=168), and Week 120 (n= 160) were 1.7 kg 
(±2.18), 2.2 kg (±2.34), and 3.3 kg (±3.24), respectively.  
To explore these findings further, analyses were performed using the age-restricted population (males 
≤18 years and females ≤15 years). In general, a numerically larger change was observed in the 
absolute values of these 4 anthropometric measures in the younger (growing) population compared to 
the Total study population. 
Mean (±SD) changes in absolute values for the Total population: 
 
standing height values at Week 48 (n=117), Week 72 (n=116), and Week 120 (n= 112) were 
2.2 cm (±2.42), 3.3 cm (±2.38), and, 4.7 cm (±3.34) respectively.  
 
sitting height values at Week 48 (n=120), Week 72 (n=118), and Week 120 (n= 115) were - 
1.5 cm (±10.87), -0.5 cm (±11.78), and -0.3 cm (±11.02), respectively.

  weight values at Week 48 (n=124), Week 72 (n=125), and Week 120 (n= 121) were 1.9 kg 
(±2.16), 2.4 kg (±2.18), 3.9 kg (±3.07), respectively. 
Rapporteur’s comment 
Numerical anthropometric data should some positive effects, however SD-values are large and 
therefore, no firm conclusion can be drawn. 
The applicant is requested to also plot the results of standing height z-score, growth velocity z-score, 
and standing height against data for the natural history population (OC).  
Radiographs of Lumbar Spine and Lower Extremity 
Radiographs of the lower extremity were performed for patients ≤20 years old only. Data from 
radiographs performed in MOR-004, or within 72 weeks prior to enrolment, may have been used for 
the Baseline radiographs. Subsequent radiographs were performed at 72-week intervals from the time 
of the most recent radiograph. 
The mean (± SD) change from Baseline for the Total population in the left lower extremity length was 
0.7 cm (± 1.36) at Week 24 (n=87), 1.7 cm (± 3.74) at Week 96 (n=75). Changes in the right lower 
extremity were similar to those in the left.  
The mean (± SD) change from Baseline for the Total population in the right lower extremity length was 
0.7 cm (± 1.57) at Week 24 (n=86), 2.0 cm (± 2.21) at Week 96 (n=76). 
Rapporteur’s comment 
The data on the radiographs of the lumbar spine and lower extremities showed some minimal 
improvement. The numerical values are in line with the values for height, indicating some 
improvement. The clinical relevance of these changes remain to be demonstrated. 
Other Measurements 
No meaningful treatment effects or negative signals were observed in corneal clouding, audiometry, 
PIQ, CTX1, or PIIANP. No definitive conclusions can be drawn from results obtained for these 
measurements. 
Rapporteur’s comment 
The MPS HAQ was developed to assess the self-care and mobility skills of patients with MPS I. The 
questionnaire includes self-care (eating/drinking, dressing, bathing, grooming, tooth brushing, and 
toileting) and mobility domains (dexterity, mobility, walking, stair climbing, and gross motor skills). 
Caregiver assistance items were also to be included to assess the extent to which assistance was 
required for the performance of activities related to the self-care and mobility domains. This is 
considered an important part of the assessment, as improvement in this domain of self-care and 
mobility could also add to the possible benefit of elosulfase alfa in these patients.  
It is important to realise that a higher Domain score signifies more impaired functionality and 
therefore, results in a negative direction indicate improvement in functionality.

Based on the data submitted in the appendices of the dossier (table 14.2.7.1 and 14.2.7.3, inserted 
below) it can be concluded that patients mobility scores thus show a small positive trend over time for 
all treatment groups (note only the change from baseline to week 120 is taken, but this improvement 
is visible throughout the treatment period). Similar results were observed for the self-care domain. The 
clinical relevance of this marginal improvement is unknown. Note that the placebo group (PBO) in the 
table below does not exist anymore in study MOR-005, thus are not applicable (NA) in these tables.  
Safety results 
BMN 110 was generally well-tolerated in patients younger than 5 years. There were no deaths during 
the study and no patients withdrew from the study or permanently discontinued treatment due to an 
AE.

Rapporteur’s comment 
Patients in the PBO-QOW groups seem to experience more AE’s related to the respiratory system. In 
general, respiratory issues in Morquio patients are well known from literature. The applicant is 
requested to submit the “Drug-Related Adverse Events by Preferred Term in ≥ 10%” stratified by age-
groups (<18 years and ≥18 years). This to confirm that the safety profile in paediatric patients is 
similar to those observed in the adults. If appropriate the applicant is requested to update SmPC 
section 4.8 (OC).  
Death and Serious Adverse Events 
Deaths 
One patient (Patient 0024-4173; female age 11 years at time of enrolment) died during the study 
during Part 2 due to an AE (MedDRA Preferred Term: lung disorder), which was considered not related 
to study drug as assessed by the investigator and attributable to underlying disease. The patient 
suffered a serious Grade 4 event of myelopathy and was scheduled for laminectomy plus spinal fusion, 
and hospitalised (28 October 2013).  Following the surgery, the patient remained hospitalized with a 
left pleural effusion requiring a chest tube; she had no sensation or mobility below T3-T4. On an 
unreported date, her pulmonary function declined, becoming a serious Grade 5 lung disorder. On 15 
November 2013, the patient died; the cause of death was reported as postoperative pulmonary 
complications. 
Rapporteur’s comment 
One patient died during part 2 of the MOR-005 study. The patient died due to post operative 
pulmonary complications. It is plausible that this was related to the underlying disease. 
Serious adverse events 
Overall, 89 patients (51.4%) reported at least one SAE. The most commonly reported SAE was knee 
deformity (29 patients [16.8%]) followed by poor venous access (12 patients [6.9%]). Other SAEs 
reported by more than 1 patient included central venous catheterization, joint instability, medical 
device removal (each 5 patients), lower respiratory tract infection, spinal cord compression, vomiting 
(each 4 patients), cervical cord compression, developmental hip dysplasia, device dislocation, 
gastroenteritis, pneumonia (each 3 patients), anaphylactic reaction, asthma, back pain, medical device 
implantation, middle ear effusion, otitis media, sleep apnoea syndrome, and tonsillar hypertrophy 
(each 2 patients). Most SAEs were reported by one patient each. 
Five patients (2.9%) reported study drug-related SAEs, which included anaphylactic reaction (2 
patients), haematuria, hypersensitivity, and vomiting (each 1 patient).

Rapporteur’s comment 
Five patients (2.9%) reported study drug-related SAEs, which included anaphylactic reaction (2 
patients), haematuria, hypersensitivity, and vomiting (each 1 patient). This is already covered in the 
warning section of the approved SmPC. No further action is deemed necessary at this moment. 
Hypersensitivity Adverse Events 
Overall, 89 (51.4%) patients reported hypersensitivity AEs. The most commonly reported 
hypersensitivity AE PT was urticaria (30 patients [17.3%]) followed by wheezing (20 patients 
[11.6%]), nasal obstruction (15 patients [8.7%]), and hypersensitivity (10 patients [5.8%]) (all in 
Angioedema SMQ (Standardized MedDRA Query)) (Table 15).  
Other hypersensitivity AE PTs (Angioedema or Anaphylactic Reaction SMQ) reported in more than 1 
patient included cough (9 patients), peripheral oedema (8 patients), dyspnoea (each 6 patients), 
obstructive airways disorder, rash, pruritus (each 5 patients), flushing (4 patients), throat tightness, 
eye swelling, lip swelling, erythema, (each 3 patients), stridor, swelling face, choking, drug 
hypersensitivity, oedema, hypotension, anaphylactic reaction, bronchospasm, and chest discomfort 
(each 2 patients). Forty-nine patients (28.3%) experienced reported study drug-related 
hypersensitivity AEs. The most commonly reported study drug-related hypersensitivity AE PT was 
urticaria (Angioedema SMQ 25 patients [14.5%]). Two patients each experienced an AE coded to the 
PT anaphylactic reaction (Patient 0021-4005 and Patient 1075-4007); both events were study-drug 
related SAEs.  
Twenty patients were identified as having events of anaphylaxis during MOR-005 using the 
anaphylactic reaction SMQ (Table 15).

Rapporteur’s comment 
89 patients (54.9%) reported hypersensitivity reactions. Most reported was urticaria, followed by 
wheezing. Hypersensitivity reaction appears well manageable with infusion rate adjustments and/or 
medical intervention. The approved SmPC section 4.4 (warnings) already includes the occurrence of 
infusion related reactions and severe allergic reactions, and how to respond to these. Therefore, at this 
moment no action seems necessary.  
Infusion-Associated Reactions 
IARs are summarized in Table 16. Nearly all patients (98.3%) reported IARs. The most common IARs 
were similar to the most common AEs overall and included pyrexia (51.4%), vomiting (49.1%), and 
headache (46.8%).  
Most of the IARs that occurred during the study were Grade 2 (58.4% of patients) in severity. Nineteen 
patients (11.0%) reported Grade 3 IARs. Three patients (1.7%) reported Grade 4 IARs, which included 
asthma (Patient 1075-4084), anaphylactic reaction (Patient 0021-4005), and status asthmaticus 
(Patient 1017-4075); these Grade 4 IARs were also classified as SAEs. The Grade 4 IAR of anaphylactic 
reaction (Patient 0021-4005) was also classified as a hypersensitivity AE and was considered possibly 
related to study drug. Twenty-two patients (12.7%) experienced severe IARs. 
A subset of IARs led to interruption or discontinuation of infusion during the study visit. Infusions were 
interrupted due to AEs for 46 patients (26.6%). Infusions were discontinued during a study visit due to 
AEs for 41 patients (23.7%) (Table 16). One patient (Patient 1159-4096; 41 year old male) 
permanently discontinued study drug due to a Grade 1 IAR AE of proteinuria. The proteinuria did not 
resolve after discontinuation. The investigator assessed the event of proteinuria as not related to study 
treatment.

Most IARs in all patients were either tolerated by patients with no change to infusion rate, or were 
successfully managed by either interrupting or discontinuing infusion at that visit, and in some cases, 
additional medical intervention.

Rapporteur’s comment 
Nearly all patients (98.3%) reported IARs. The most common IARs were similar to the most common 
AEs overall and included pyrexia (51.4%), vomiting (49.1%), and headache (46.8%). One patient 
permanently discontinued treatment due to persisting proteinuria. 
The SmPC in section 4.8 mentions “…Infusion reactions (IRs) occurring in ≥ 10% of patients treated 
with Vimizim.” and “IRs were generally mild or moderate, and the frequency was higher during the 
first 12 weeks of treatment and tended to occur less frequently with time.” However, in the combined 
safety population of studies MOR-004 and MOR-005, nearly all patients (98.3%) reported Infusion 
Associated Reactions (IARs). The MAH should discuss whether the frequency of IRs in this study was 
higher than already described in the SmPC and, if needed, propose amendments of the SmPC wording 
(OC). 
Infusion Associated Reactions Resulting in Infusion Interruption or Discontinuation and Requiring 
Medical Intervention 
AEs that resulted in infusion interruption or infusion discontinuation and also required medical 
intervention were reported by 42 (24.3%) and 19 (11.0%) patients, respectively. Most of these 
patients had the AEs managed with IV antihistamines (33 patients [19.1%]) or IV steroids (30 patients 
[17.3%]).

Rapporteur’s comment:  
It is known for this product that patients can experience infusion related reactions and require medical 
intervention. Measurements to be taken when an infusion related reaction occurs or how to pre-treat 
the patient prior to elosulfase alfa infusion with antihistaminics are already stated in the SmPC 
(posology and warning section).  
Pregnancy 
Patient 0025-4010 (QW-QW cohort; 37 years old female) had an ectopic pregnancy that was reported 
as an SAE (20 Feb 2014 to 22 Feb 2014). The patient had no previous pregnancy history prior to 
enrolment in MOR-004. She started treatment with BMN 110 2.0 mg/kg/week in MOR-004 on 24 June 
2011, and started treatment in MOR-005 on 9 December 2011. On an unspecified date, the subject 
became pregnant while receiving BMN 110. The date of her last menstrual period was 15 July 2013. 
BMN 110 therapy continued during the pregnancy. On 5 September 2013, an ultrasound revealed a 
gestational sac without an embryo (serious Grade 2 blighted ovum), and the diagnosis was confirmed 
with additional testing on 13 September 2013. Treatment for the event included an unspecified 
procedure, and the event was considered resolved on 25 September 2013. No action was taken with 
study medication in response to the event, and the subject continued to received BMN 110. 
The date of her last menstrual period was 25 December 2013. On 14 February 2014, an ultrasound 
showed an empty uterus with suspicion of an ectopic pregnancy. She was hospitalized on 20 February 
2014 for a serious Grade 3 ectopic pregnancy with hemoperitoneum. On that date, she underwent a 
therapeutic abortion via right salpingectomy. The patient was discharged home on 22 February 2014, 
and the event was considered resolved on that date. No action was taken with study medication in 
response to the event. The investigator assessed the events of blighted ovum and ectopic pregnancy 
as not related to study treatment.

The patient received her last infusion of study drug on 04 Jul 2014 (Part 2, Week 134) and exited the 
study on 12 Sep 2014. 
Rapporteur’s comment 
During the study 1 patient became pregnant twice. Both pregnancies were ectopic.  The conclusion of 
the investigator that the ectotopic pregnancies were not related to the study drug seems plausible. 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs, clinical chemistry, haematology, or urinalysis results 
were observed. 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
There were no clinically significant trends in vital signs, ECG, ECHOs in the total population, based on 
review of changes in vital signs from pre-infusion to during or post-infusion.  
Immunogenicity and Efficacy 
All patients treated with BMN 110 developed antidrug total antibody (Tab) by Week 24 of MOR-004. In 
the extension study, all treatment groups, including patients who had previously been on placebo, 
were TAb positive by study Week 36 (MOR-005 Week 12). All patients remained TAb positive 
throughout the study and TAb titers were similar across treatment groups at Week 120. Nearly all 
patients tested positive for elosulfase alfa specific neutralizing antibodies (Nab) at least once, with 
incidence of Nab positivity peaking at 85.9% at study Week 36, then steadily declining to 66.0% at 
study Week 120. In all treatment groups, mean urine KS remained below treatment-naive baseline 
despite the presence of antidrug antibodies. No relationship was observed between TAb titers or NAb 
positivity and changes in urine KS, 6MWT, or 3MSCT from Baseline to Week 120. 
All patients treated with BMN 110 developed anti-BMN 110TAb by study Week 36 and remained 
positive for TAb throughout MOR-005. Patients who received placebo in MOR-004 initiated BMN 110 
treatment upon entering MOR-005, and all patients in this group tested positive for TAb following 12 
weeks of BMN 110 treatment. From study Week 36 through to study end, all patients remained TAb 
positive and mean titer values remained similar across all treatment groups through Week 120 (Figure 
8). There were no apparent differences in TAb titer between the ITT and MPP populations.

Rapporteur’s comment:  
All patients treated with elosulfase alfa developed antidrug TAb by Week 24 of MOR-004. In the 
extension study, all treatment groups, including patients who had previously been on placebo, were 
TAb positive by study Week 36 (MOR-005 Week 12). All patients remained TAb positive throughout the 
study and TAb titers were similar across treatment groups at Week 120.  
After switching to elosulfase alfa treatment, patients previously on placebo all showed an increase in 
Nab titers, following the same trend as observed during study MOR-004.  
No relationship was observed between TAb titers or NAb positivity and changes in urine KS, 6MWT, or 
3MSCT from Baseline to Week 120.  
Mean TAb titer was not associated with either the presence or severity of hypersensitivity AEs. Through 
the end of MOR-005, 89 of 172 patients (51.7%) experienced a hypersensitivity AE (Table 18). There 
was no difference in mean TAb titer between patients that experienced hypersensitivity AEs vs those 
that did not.

Rapporteur’s comment:  
The data indicate that there is no association between Tab titers and AE severity or efficacy. This is in 
line with the data assessed during the initial MAA.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Based on the submitted uncontrolled data of the extension study MOR-005 no firm conclusions can be 
drawn at this moment. Study MOR-005 is the long-term extension study of study MOR-004, which is 
partially discussed during the initial MAA (data up to week 48 (week 24) were already assessed in the 
MAA).  
Data up to week 168 have now become available. In total 173 patients were included in the study. The 
majority of the population were paediatric patients over 5 years of age (5-11 years, 93/173 (53.8%); 
12-18 years 46/173 (26.6%), over 19 years 31/173 (19.7%)).  
The results obtained for urine keratin sulphate (KS) indicate that with continued elosulfase alfa 
treatment the pharmacodynamic effect is maintained. This is confirmed in patients previously on 
placebo treatment in MOR-004 who switched to active treatment in MOR-005. 
The 6MWT, respiratory function (capacity), anthropometric measures and the MPS Health Assessment 
Questionnaire are considered important indicators for observing a clinically relevant effect in these 
patients. As elosulfase alfa is a life-long treatment, it will be especially important for the paediatric 
patient population that in due time a clear relevant clinical benefit for these patients is 
observed/demonstrated.  
As all patients on the 2 mg/kg every other week (QOW) dosage were switched to the approved dosage 
(2 mg/kg every week (QW)) in accordance with the SmPC, the results of the patients in the QOW-QOW 
and Placebo-QOW should be interpreted with caution. The patients who received the QW regimen 
during the whole study (QW-QW and placebo-QW) are considered the most important groups, as these 
data will add to the knowledge of the long term treatment effect of elosulfase alfa.  
In the QW-QW group, the results of the 6MWT from MOR-005 show some initial improvement up to 
week 48 (part 1 of the study), but the long term data suggests that the effect decline under continued 
treatment (part 2 of the study). A similar trend is observed in the placebo-QW group. As the 
respiratory function seems to improve numerically in the patients with continued elosulfase alfa 
treatment, it is expected that this would also influence the endurance capacity of a patient resulting in 
an improvement of 6MWT. The interpretation of the data is hampered as the results are not normalized. 
For this reason the applicant should submit the results of the 6MWT, FEV1, FVC, height and height 
velocity based on z-scores for the QW-QW and placebo-QW groups.  
On continued treatment with elosulfase alfa, the anthropologic measures show a normalised growth 
rate, SD between -1 and +1.

Data from the MPS Health Assessment Questionnaire (MPS HAQ), both self-care and mobility domain, 
showed a marginal positive trend for all treatment groups. The clinical relevance of this marginal 
improvement is unknown. 
Altogether, taken the above observations, there seems to be limited clinical benefit of continued 
elosulfase alfa treatment on the 6MWT, lung capacity and MPS HAQ.  It is therefore of scientific and 
clinical interest to verify whether there is an association between the 6MWT, lung capacity and MPS 
HAQ. The applicant is requested to explore this relationship. 
Elosulfase alfa was generally well-tolerated in patients over 5 years. Hypersensitivity reactions appear 
to be well manageable with infusion rate adjustments and/or medical intervention. This is in line with 
the approved SmPC.  No new or unexpected adverse events were observed. With respect to the drug-
related AEs the applicant should submit the data stratified by age groups to confirm the statement that 
the safety in patients over 5 years of age is similar to those observed in adults. One patient died due 
to post operative pulmonary complications.  During the study one patient became pregnant twice. Both 
pregnancies were ectopic. This is not considered to be related to the study drug. 
All patients treated with elosulfase alfa developed antidrug total antibody (Tab) by week 24 of MOR-
004. In the extension study, all treatment groups, including patients who had previously been on 
placebo, were TAb positive by study Week 36 (MOR-005 Week 12). All patients remained TAb positive 
throughout the study and TAb titers were similar across treatment groups at Week 120. Data indicate 
that there is no association between Tab titers and AE severity. This is in line with the data assessed 
during the initial MAA. 
3.  Rapporteur’s updated overall conclusion and 
recommendation 
In the previous assessment round the MAH was requested to submit additional analyses for baseline 
adjusted characteristics (e.g. age, gender). The rationale of this request was based on the need to 
examine whether there were any possible stopping rules for those patients that may not benefit from 
treatment. As requested the additional analyses were submitted by the MAH. However, in these 
analyses no clear difference between the age-groups (5-11 years and 12-18 years) were observed. 
Furthermore, when stratified by walking distance at baseline and use of walking aids, again no 
difference could be observed.  
The data for 6MWT and 3MSCT showed that in both age groups treatment showed comparable results 
after 96 weeks. Initially an improvement is observed, however, at a later time point a decline in 
treatment effect is noticed in the younger population. With respect to the lung function (FEV1 and FVC) 
it is shown that the younger patients (5-11 years) showed slightly more improvement than the older 
patients (12-18 years). 
In general patients in study MOR-005 had, besides an improvement in oligosaccharides (i.e. a decline), 
a better pulmonary function, endurance  and daily self-care when compared to the natural history 
cohort. However, no firm conclusions can be drawn as the data were gathered in an open label study.  
In order to investigate whether there was a correlation between the 6MWT and lung capacity with the 
MPS HAQ, the MAH performed a correlation analysis. The association is considered weak.  Within the 
time-frame of the study the positive effect on the lung function and endurance apparently does not 
translate into a clear improvement of QoL.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/711038/2017  
Page 50/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In conclusion, based on data comparing the patients in study MOR-005 to the natural history cohort, 
there is no direct evidence for introducing stopping rules. 
No new or unexpected safety signals were observed from the study. The safety results are consistent 
with prior studies and the safety profile for elosulfase alfa within the scope of the current knowledge. 
At this moment, there is no need to update SmPC section 4.8. 
The benefit/risk of elosulfase alfa remains positive.  
Data from the registry are awaited due time. 
 Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action is required. 
4.  Request for supplementary information 
1.  With respect to the 6MWT, FEV1, FVC, height and height velocity the MAH is requested to 
submit analyses using z-scores. These data should be submitted for the patient-groups that 
received 2.0 mg/kg QW during study 004 and 005, as the (QW-QW and placebo-QW groups 
separately) are the most relevant populations in this regard. Further, these data should be 
compared to the natural history population (study MOR-001). For each measurement (6MWT, 
FEV1, FVC, height and height velocity) a separate graph should be submitted. On the x-axis 
the time on treatment should be plotted, on the y-axis the z-score. The data of the natural 
history group should be incorporated in each graph. 
2.  For height and growth velocity (y-axis) the MAH should plot against age (x-axis), and the CDC 
and the published MSP growth curves should be incorporated (refer to the publication by P. 
Harmatz et al., Molecular Genetics and Metabolism 109 (2013) 54–61). Graphs should be 
submitted for males and females separately. 
3.  The MAH is requested to submit the baseline data and efficacy results for the paediatric 
patients and paediatric subpopulation separately.   
4.  The MAH is requested to submit the baseline demographics and characteristics for the MPP 
population, paediatric, adult and paediatric subpopulations separately. 
5.  In the MPS HAQ a marginal positive improvement was observed. The clinical relevance is 
unknown.  The MAH is requested to submit the results for both MPS HAQ domains stratified by 
age groups, as this may provide insight on whether there is a difference in impact between the 
age groups. 
6.  As elosulfase alfa is for life-long treatment, presumably starting early in life (after diagnosis), it 
is clear that a clinically relevant benefit for the patient is to be expected. In this case the 
6MWT, lung capacity and MPS HAQ are considered important indicators for observing a 
clinically relevant effect in these patients, although other factors are important as well. It is 
therefore important to verify whether there is an association between the 6MWT, lung capacity 
and MPS HAQ. The MAH is requested to submit these analyses.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/711038/2017  
Page 51/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7.  The MAH is requested to discuss whether there are any patient characteristics that could help 
to determine, a priori, those patients that will not benefit from elosulfase alfa treatment. The 
MAH should explore the possibility to include stopping rules in the SmPC for those patients not 
(or no longer) having a benefit from treatment.  
8.  Study MOR-005 was planned to continue up to Week 240, however it was prematurely 
terminated by the MAH. The timing of the termination as well as justification for this should be 
provided by the MAH.  
9.  The MAH is requested to submit the “Drug-Related Adverse Events by Preferred Term in ≥ 
10%” stratified by age-groups (<18 years and ≥18 years), to confirm that the safety profile in 
paediatric patients is similar to that observed in the adult population. When appropriate SmPC 
section 4.8 should be updated accordingly. 
10. The SmPC in section 4.8 mentions “…. Infusion reactions (IRs) occurring in ≥ 10% of patients 
treated with Vimizim.” and “IRs were generally mild or moderate, and the frequency was 
higher during the first 12 weeks of treatment and tended to occur less frequently with time.” 
However, in the combined safety population of studies MOR-004 and MOR-005, nearly all 
patients (98.3%) reported Infusion Associated Reactions (IARs). The MAH should discuss 
whether the frequency of IRs in this study was higher than already described in the SmPC and, 
if needed, propose amendments of the SmPC wording. 
5.  MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Question 1. 
Study MOR-005 was planned to continue up to Week 240, however it was prematurely 
terminated by the MAH. The timing of the termination as well as justification for this should 
be provided by the MAH. 
MAH Response 
The primary objective of MOR-005 was to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy of a 2.0 mg/kg dose 
of BMN 110, administered weekly or every other week, in subjects with MPS IVA. MOR-004 was the 
pivotal study. Extension study MOR-005 allowed the MOR-004 MPS IVA patient population to continue 
on therapy in a clinical trial setting; as the drug was approved country by country, patients would 
discontinue study MOR-005 and move on to commercially available treatment. 
The 240-week maximum study duration was originally proposed by the Sponsor to allow for a long 
extension period of continued patient treatment, without need for additional protocol amendments, 
until commercial product could be made available, and was written at a time when the timing for 
availability of commercial product could not be accurately predicted. As such the 240-week maximum 
study duration was not driven by scientific considerations, but to simplify the clinical management of 
the studies. It is for this reason the study duration was described in MOR-005 clinical protocols as ‘Up 
to 240 weeks’. Following the European Commission Decision on the Vimizim Marketing Authorisation 
Application in 2014, and as Member States finalised Pricing and Reimbursement/Continued Access, 
patients were transitioned to commercial treatment and the study sites were closed. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH explained that due to the availability of the commercial products patients could be 
transitioned from study MOR-005 to the commercial product. In the protocol it was stated that patients

could receive up to 240 weeks of treatment in study MOR-005, as no accurate prediction could be 
made when the Vimizim was commercial available. 
Issue resolved. 
Question 2. 
The MAH is requested to discuss whether there are patient characteristics that could help to 
determine if a patient could be a non-responder to elosulfase alfa treatment. The MAH 
should explore the possibility to include stopping rules in the SmPC for those patients not 
benefitting from treatment (anymore). 
MAH Response: 
MPS IVA is a rare, devastating, inherited disorder caused by mutations of the gene that codes for the 
lysosomal enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS), which degrades glycosaminoglycans 
(GAGs) including keratan sulfate (KS) and chondroitin-6- sulfate (C6S). With insufficient GALNS, GAGs 
progressively accumulate in multiple organs and tissues. 
The pervasive and progressive accumulation of GAGs leads to significant morbidities and multisystemic 
clinical impairments resulting in diminished functional capacity, decreased endurance, impaired quality 
of life, and early mortality.  
Patients with Morquio A suffer from a progressive decline in endurance as measured by the 6 Minute 
Walk Test (6MWT) (−6.84m ±5.38m per year), lung function (on average, FVC and MVV increased in 
patients aged ≤14 years [FVC: 9.06%; MVV: 10.25%], but decreased in older patients [FVC: -2.34%; 
MVV: -9.58%]), and activities in daily living (significant decline in all domains of MPS HAQ) (Harmatz 
2015; Hendriksz 2014a; Hendriksz 2017). It has also been shown that not all patients respond to 
treatment in the same way (Hendriksz 2014a). Therefore, when assessing the data on effectiveness, it 
is important that more than one endpoint is taken into account to determine whether or not a patient 
is benefitting from therapy. 
In study MOR-005 patient randomisation was stratified according to the baseline walk distance (6MWT 
≤ 200m ≥) and age group (5-11, 12-18 and ≥19 years). Exploratory analyses were performed to 
obtain an indication of whether treatment effects differed across several baseline covariates, including 
the screening 6MWT, age category, sex, race and region. Subgroup analyses did not provide strong 
evidence of differences in treatment effect according to any of the categories of age group, sex, race 
and geographic region (Hendriksz 2014b, supplementary Table 5). 
Regarding the first 24 weeks of elosulfase alfa treatment, although only the 6MWT showed a 
significantly greater treatment effect compared to placebo, the majority of the remaining estimates fell 
to the right of zero (positive), indicating numerically higher treatment effects for weekly elosulfase alfa 
over 24 weeks (Hendriksz 2014a). Efficacy results for the MOR-004 primary (6MWT), secondary 
(3MSCT), and tertiary endpoints (respiratory, anthropometric, MPS-HAQ) for elosulfase alfa QW  
treatment versus placebo over 24 weeks are summarised in the forest plot in Figure 2.1 which 
demonstrates numerical improvements across multiple domains in favour of treatment.

Figure 2.1: Forest Plot of Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Efficacy Endpoints for 
Study MOR-004: elosulfase alfa QW Treatment Versus Placebo for 24 weeks – 
ITT. 
In the MOR-005 extension study, the initial 24-week efficacy of elosulfase alfa treatment (as displayed 
in Figure 2.1) was demonstrated to continue over 120 weeks across the treatment groups: treatment 
with once-weekly elosulfase alfa sustained the positive treatment effects on uKS, endurance and 
pulmonary function measures (Hendriksz 2016a). For the 120 week analysis, two main populations 
were analyzed, the intention to treat (ITT) population, which included all patients who received a dose 
of elosulfase alfa, and the modified per protocol (MPP) population, which controlled for confounding by 
excluding those patients who had surgeries after week 24, and/or had missed more than three doses 
of elosulfase alfa. Hence the data below includes the MPP analysis. 
There was almost identical improvement in endurance over 120 weeks for patients who at baseline had 
endurance categorised as substantially limited (6MWT ≤200 m) and less limited (6MWT >200 m) 
(Figure 2.2) as was the improvement in endurance of patients both with and without the use of 
walking aid at baseline (Figure 2.3).

As there was no placebo arm after 24 weeks, the MOR-005 outcomes were compared to matched 
patients from the natural history study, MOR-001 (MorCAP). Patients receiving elosulfase alfa over 120 
weeks demonstrated significant overall improvements in uKS levels (p<0.0001), endurance (p=0.005) 
(Hendriksz 2016a), pulmonary function (FVC p= 0.04; FEV1 p=0.03) (Hendriksz 2016b) and activities 
of daily living (ADL) that were significantly greater compared with untreated patients (Hughes 2017, 
Hendriksz, 2017). Increases in FVC and FEV1 were greater in treated patients than in untreated 
patients overall, but also in ERT-treated patients ≤ 14 years of age. It could be argued that this may 
have been caused in part by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)-induced growth acceleration, as 
treated patients showed a mean (SE) increase in height of +5.1 (3.5) cm over 2 years compared to 
only +2.8 (2.8) cm in the untreated patients. However, FVC and FEV1 also improved in ERT-treated 
patients >14 years of age (when growth is much more limited), while the untreated MorCAP patients in 
this age group showed considerable decline (Hendriksz 2016b, Figure 3c). Mean (SE) growth in this 
older patient age group was +1.3 (3.2) cm in treated vs -0.0 (0.9) cm in untreated patients, 
suggesting that the increase in respiratory function by ERT was most likely mediated by other 
mechanisms, such as decreased upper airway obstruction, increased chest wall compliance, improved 
respiratory muscle strength, and/or improved diaphragmatic movement due to a reduction in liver size 
and a reduction in GAG tissue storage (Hendriksz 2016a, Hendriksz 2016b, Hughes 2017). 
In conclusion the results of MOR-005 do not provide any conclusive evidence regarding patient 
characteristics that allow the determination of patient response to elosulfase alfa treatment. Patients 
with MPS IVA show considerable heterogeneity of disease; there is no single measure of efficacy that 
captures all benefit. Some patients will show benefit on functional tests but not on respiratory function 
tests and vice versa. In addition, efficacy outcomes are highly variable. For example, patients can 
show large decreases in the 6MWT in the event of orthopaedic surgery. Given these conditions, it is 
challenging to determine stopping rules at this time. Stratification using a baseline walk test cut off of 
>200m does not suggest a difference in response. Please also see responses to Question 3 for a more 
detailed assessment of stratification using age groups 5-11 and 12-18 with respect to 6MWT, 3MSC, 
Lung Function Tests and uGAGs.

The current expert consensus is that all patients with MPS IVA should be treated with elosulfase alfa in 
order to determine response. Therefore, given the above factors, we are currently unable to propose 
any stopping rules in the SmPC. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
It is agreed with the MAH that the treatment effectiveness should not be based on one single endpoint, 
especially in a heterogeneous disease such as Morquio A. It is also understandable that within this 
patient population the youngest patients may show more improvement in endurance than the older 
patients. 
The MAH was requested to discuss whether there are any patient characteristics that could help to 
determine if a patient could be a non-responder to elosulfase alfa treatment. For this question the MAH 
showed that based on stratification to patients capable of walking >200m at baseline compared to 
≤200m, no difference in response could be observed. Similar for stratification by walking aid or no aid. 
The difference in scaling of the figures is noted, but improvement is comparable. Further, the 
publication by Hendriksz et al. (2016a) showed that patients in MOR-005 had more improvement in 
uKS and endurance compared to matched patients from the historical control (MorCap) (6MWT; figure 
below). 
In addition, pulmonary function in treated patients was also better than in the matched patients from 
the historical control (MorCap) (Hendriksz et al. 2016b). As discussed by the MAH patients ≤14 years 
of age showed more improvement than those >14 years of age. Both age groups showed more 
improvement than the historically matched population.

Hughes et al (2017) showed that in daily living patients on treatment showed better result than those 
from the MorCAP population. However, it should be noted that the patient numbers are limited and this 
hampers drawing firm conclusions. 
It is agreed with the MAH that based on data comparing the patients in study MOR-005 and the 
MorCAP, there is no direct evidence for stopping rules. 
Issue resolved 
Question 3. 
The MAH is requested to submit the baseline data and efficacy results for the paediatric 
patients and paediatric subpopulation separately.

populations (5-11 years and 12-18 years) are presented in this section, according to efficacy 
assessment. 
The 6MWT and 3MSCT data are presented in Table 3.1, respiratory function data are presented in 
Table 3.2, and uKS data are presented in Table 3.3. HAQ data are discussed in response to Question 7. 
Overall, improvements in efficacy endpoints seen in the MOR-005 total population were reflected in the 
paediatric sub-populations: improvements of a similar magnitude to the overall population were 
observed in endurance tests, respiratory function and uKS. However, any interpretation of data by 
paediatric sub-group should be done with caution. Given the small numbers of patients in some sub-
groups and the high variability of the data, it was not possible to draw any meaningful conclusions on 
differences in response between paediatric sub-populations. 
Baseline data for the 6MWT were comparable between treatment cohorts. The 6MWT was lower in the 
12-18 years sub-population (187.2 m in the PBO-QW group and 185.0 m in the QW-QW group) than 
the 5-11 years sub-population (208.9 m for the PBO-QW group and 232.8 m for the QW-QW group), 
which is reflective of the natural history data which shows a gradual decline over time. In the total 
population, improvements were seen in the 6MWT, with an overall mean increase of 33.0 m from 
baseline to Week 120 (MPP, n=123). For the paediatric subpopulations, change from baseline data for 
the 6MWT were highly variable and difficult to interpret. Note that given the small n for the 5-11 years 
subpopulation (n=11 at week 168), one patient who had a substantial decline (-309m) had a very 
large impact on the mean. It is also important to remember that not every patient will respond to 
treatment in the same manner and therefore important to assess all results for each individual patient 
(Hendriksz 2014b Figure 1 A & B). 
Baseline data for the 3MSCT were comparable between treatment cohorts and paediatric sub-
populations (mean 3MSCT ranged from 26.3 and 36.5 stairs/min). In the total population, 
improvements were seen in the 3MSCT, with an overall mean increase of 7.4 stairs/min from baseline 
to Week 120 (MPP, n=122). Change from baseline data for the 3MSCT were highly variable and 
difficult to interpret. Baseline data for the 3MSCT were comparable between treatment cohorts and 
paediatric sub-populations (mean 3MSCT ranged from 26.3 and 36.5 stairs/min). 
In the total population, improvements were seen in the 3MSCT, with an overall mean increase of 7.4 
stairs/min from baseline to Week 120 (MPP, n=122). Change from baseline data for the 3MSCT were 
highly variable and difficult to interpret. In the PBOQW group, median change to Week 96 (n=13) was 
positive in the 12-18 years subpopulation (2.9 stairs/min) and showed no change in the 5-11 years 
sub-population; low patient numbers at Week 144 (n=4) did not allow any meaningful interpretation. 
As discussed above, one patient may be driving the decline in the mean for the 5-11 sub-group.

paediatric population as a whole (<19 years) and for the paediatric sub-populations (5-11 years and 
12-18 years) are discussed here and presented in MPP Table 3.2.  
Baseline data for FEV1 were comparable between treatment cohorts and between the paediatric sub-
populations (mean FEV1 ranged from 0.5 L in the PBO-QW group for the 5-11 years sub-population to 
1.4 L in the PBQ-QW group for the 12-18 years subpopulation). In the total population, improvements 
were seen in FEV1, with an overall mean (SD) increase of 8.3% (24.79%) from baseline to Week 120 
(MPP, n=147). For the paediatric sub-populations, change from baseline data for FEV1 were highly 
variable.  Note that given the small n for the 12-18 years sub-population (n=6 at Week 168), one 
patient who had a substantial decline (-16%) may have had a large impact on the summary data. 
Baseline data for FVC were comparable between treatment cohorts; mean FVC ranged from 0.6 L in 
the PBO-QW group for the 5-11 years sub-population to 1.6 L in the PBQQW group for the 12-18 years 
sub-population. Mean FVC in the PBO-QW group was higher for the 12-18 years sub-population (1.6 L) 
than the 5-11 years sub-population (0.6 L); this difference was not observable in the QW-QW group.

For PBO-QW, in order to remove the placebo effect, the first 24 weeks data have been excluded and subsequent visits have been re-
labeled, such as week 48 become to week 24 etc.  
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
As requested the MAH presented the baseline data and the efficacy data stratified by the paediatric 
subgroups (5-11 years; 12-18 years) separately. Baseline values for 6MWT, 3MSCT, FEV1, FVC and 
uKS were balanced.  
The data for 6MWT and 3MSCT showed that in both age groups treatment showed comparable results 
after 96 weeks. Initially an improvement is observed, however, at a later time point in the younger

population a decline is noticed. With respect to the lung function (FEV1 and FVC) it can be observed 
that the younger patients (5-11 years) showed slightly more improvement, compared to the older 
patients. This seems to be in line with the publication of Hughes et al. (2017) (see above).  
As in the overall population a decrease in uKS was also observed in the age groups in both study arms 
(e.g. PBO-QW and QW-QW). 
Note that due to the open-label character and the limited number of patients no conclusion can be 
drawn. 
For the assessment of data on the Health Assessment Questionnaire refer to question 7. 
Issue resolved. 
Question 4. 
The MAH is requested to submit the baseline demographics and characteristics for the MPP population, 
paediatric, adult and paediatric subpopulations separately.

When investigating the PBO-QW and QW-QW arms of each sub-population (See Table 4.2), there do 
not appear to be any significant discrepancies in the demographic characteristics within sub-
populations, indicating a balanced comparison between arms.

A further breakdown of the sub-populations by trial arm showed no significant differences between trial 
arms within the same population. However, it should be noted that there were fewer patients in the 
PBO-QW arm when compared to the QW-QW arm (data not shown). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
As requested the MAH submitted the baseline demographics and characteristics. No major differences 
between the different age groups were noticed. Although comparison of the groups should be done 
with caution, most paediatric patients could walk more than 200 m at baseline. This may be explained 
by the progressive cause of the disease. Similar for the 3MSCT. Remarkably the adult population had 
lower ukS values at baseline, which is in line with the natural history of the disease, where older 
patients showed a decline in uKS with age. 
Issue resolved.  
Question 5. 
With respect to the 6MWT, FEV1, FVC, height and height velocity the MAH is requested to 
submit analyses using z-scores. These data should be submitted for the patient-groups that 
received 2.0 mg/kg QW during study 004 and 005, as the (QW-QW and placebo-QW groups 
separately) are the most relevant populations in this regard. Further, these data should be 
compared to the natural history population (study MOR-001). For each measurement 
(6MWT, FEV1, FVC, height and height velocity) a separate graph should be submitted. On 
the x-axis the time on treatment should be plotted, on the y-axis the z-score. The data of 
the natural history group should be incorporated in each graph. 
MAH Response: 
Table 5.1 and 5.2 provides an overview of Z-scores for 6MWT, FEV1, FVC, Height and Growth Velocity 
for the MOR-001 and the MOR-005 PBO-QW and QW-QW populations in the ITT and MPP population. 
Anthropometric Z-scores were based on the CDC growth charts (standardised by sex and age). For the 
6MWT, FEV1, and FVC, there are no norms available. Therefore, these were calculated by pooling the 
first measurement of MOR-001 with the baseline of PBO-QW and QW-QW populations, forming six 
groups stratified by sex and the three age groups of interest, with Z-scores being produced by taking 
the mean and SD of these groups.

Figure 5.1 to Figure 5.5 provide a graphical representation of the Z-scores for each outcome 
respectively comparing MOR-001 and MOR-005 MPP populations. The Figures indicate that there was 
relatively wide variation in all three populations of interest for each outcome. It should be noted that 
patients in the MOR-001 study did not have the same assessment schedule as the trial patients and 
therefore the timing of the measurements varied compared to the MOR-005 populations. 
Similarly to the primary and secondary endpoint data presented previously, overall, treated patients 
improved when compared with natural history. 
For the 6MWT, the natural history group saw a decline in Z-score (-0.1, SD 0.70), while the PBO-QW 
group saw no change in Z-score over time (PBO-QW 0.0, SD 1.21) and the QW QW group saw an 
increase in Z-score over time (QW-QW 0.4, SD 1.06), indicating a positive treatment effect. However, 
it should be noted that there are no published 6MWT norms for MPS IVA patients and therefore the Z-
score data should be interpreted with caution. 
For the respiratory function tests, the data was skewed, and therefore the z-scores were based on 
log(FEV1) and log(FVC). For FEV1, Z-scores for the natural history cohort improved slightly (0.1, SD 
0.26). The Z-score for the PBO-QW improved by 0.3 (SD 0.49). The QW-QW group saw limited change 
in Z-score (0.0, SD 0.83). It is worth noting that there was a wide range in responses, with many 
patients on treatment achieving an increase in Z-score (range for treated patients: -4.3 to 1.1). The 
results for FVC were similar, with the Z-scores for natural history showing a slight improvement (0.1, 
SD 0.26), PBO-QW group showing an improvement in Z-score (0.2, SD 0.36) and the QW-QW group 
showing stability (0.0, SD 0.71). Similarly, there was a wide range of FVC Z-score changes in the 
treated group (-3.7 to 0.9). 
For standing height, the natural history cohort showed a clear negative trend, with the patients having 
a Z-score change of -0.8. Patients in the treated groups also had a negative change in standing height 
Z-score of -0.6 (SD 0.82) for the PBO-QW group, and -0.6 (SD 0.94) for the QW-QW group. Again, it is 
worth noting that these Z-scores were derived from CDC population norms, and therefore it is 
expected that the Morquio A population is less tall (a negative Z-score) compared to the unaffected 
population. The mean Z-scores for the treated group appear to be closer to the population norm than 
the untreated group. However, as with the other measures, there is considerable variation in all three 
populations.  
Finally, for growth velocity, the Z-scores showed improvement for the natural history and the treated 
groups over time. It is unclear whether or not this is due to natural growth patterns in these  
populations. As with standing height, these Z-scores were derived from CDC population norms, and not 
Morquio A, so negative Z-scores would be expected for this population. As with the other outcomes, 
there was considerable variation in all populations.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH’s efforts to submit the requested data are highly appreciated, as it is clear that there are no 
norms available for the 6MWT, FEV1 and FVC. It is agreed with the MAH that there is a high variability 
amongst the patients, which is representative for the heterogeneity of the disease. The figures 
submitted for 6MWT, FEV1, FVC, standing height and growth velocity did not show a distinctive 
pattern. 
Issue resolved. 
Question 6. 
As elosulfase alfa is for life-long treatment, presumably starting early in life (after 
diagnosis), it is clear that a clinically relevant benefit for the patient is to be expected. In 
this case the 6MWT, lung capacity and MPS HAQ are considered important indicators for 
observing a clinically relevant effect in these patients, although other factors are important 
as well. It is of scientific and clinical interest to verify whether there is an association 
between the 6MWT, lung capacity and MPS HAQ. The MAH is requested to submit these 
analyses. 
MAH Response: 
Pearson Correlation Coefficients between 6MWT, FVC (lung capacity), and the three domains of the 
MPS HAQ (self-care, mobility and caregiver assistance) were performed on MOR-004/005 Week 120 
data, and the change from baseline to Week 120 data, to assess the relationship between variables in 
the ITT population of Study MOR-005.

At Week 120, the analysis showed a significant positive correlation between all variables (Table 6.1 
and Figure 6.1). The increases in 6MWT from baseline were associated with increases in lung function 
(FVC) and decreases in the MPS HAQ domains (Table 6.2). This is perhaps unsurprising, as it would be 
expected that improved endurance would have a relationship with pulmonary function, and mobility. In 
addition, the ability to be more ambulatory and to be able to breathe better would be likely to reduce 
the self-care and caregiver burden, particularly when help was needed with walking even short 
distances.

In the ITT population, the changes from baseline to Week 120 in the 6MWT was significantly correlated 
with FVC (L), and the Mobility and Caregiver assistance domains suggesting an improvement in

assistance. The change in 6MWT was not significantly associated with a change in the self-care 
domain; however, the coefficient indicated an improvement. 
Change in FVC (L) was significantly correlated with improvements in endurance (6MWT). While the 
correlation coefficients indicated an improvement in the three MPS HAQ domains, the correlation was 
not significant. As previously mentioned, lung function would be expected to have a positive correlation 
with improvements in endurance, as the ability to breathe better would allow more physical activity. 
The MPS HAQ domains were also significantly correlated with each other.

It is no surprise that the domains of the MPS HAQ are correlated with each other. For the 
measurements at week 120 there is only a slight correlation (|Pearson’s correlation coefficient| >0.55) 
between 6MWT and Mobility. The other correlations considering the measurements at week 120 and 
the changes from baseline to week 120 are considered weak (|Pearson’s correlation coefficient| within 
(0.3, 0.5) and (0.0 and 0.3), respectively).  
Within the time-frame of the study the positive effect on the lung function and endurance apparently 
does not translate into a clear improvement in QoL. 
Issue resolved. 
Question 7. 
In the MPS HAQ a marginal positive improvement was observed. The clinical relevance is 
unknown. The MAH is requested to submit the results for both MPS HAQ domains stratified 
by age groups, as this may provide insight on whether there is a difference in impact 
between the age groups.

MAH Response: 
The data shows that patients receiving the licensed dose improved across all three domains, regardless 
of age, which is consistent with the published data (Hendriksz 2017). Figure 7.1 to Figure 7.3 provide a 
graphical representation of the change from baseline to 120 weeks for the three MPS HAQ domains 
(Mobility, Self-Care, and Caregiver Burden, respectively). It is difficult to make any statistical claims of 
differences between sub-groups given the small number of patients in some sub-groups and the wide 
range of responses from patients or their caregivers as is consistent with the other sub-group analyses 
from the MOR-004/005 trials. It is important to remember that a reduction in score is a positive 
outcome for all three domains of the MPS HAQ.  
In terms of changes in mobility, Figure 7.1 highlights that there are no significant differences between 
adult and paediatric populations, nor between the ITT and MPP populations. However, it appears that 
those patients who received the licensed dose are consistently showing improvement across 
populations. The wide confidence intervals are reflective of the small population size in some sub-
populations. 
A similar pattern was seen for the Self-Care (See Figure 7.2) and Caregiver Burden domains (See  
Figure 7.3): an improvement in scores over 120 weeks, but no clear differences between age groups, 
and the QW-QW arms generally performing better than the PBO-QW group in the paediatric sub-
groups.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
As requested the MAH provided the subgroup analysis for the 3 health domains. Note that negative 
values represent an improvement. There are no apparent differences between the various age groups 
analysed. Unfortunately it cannot be concluded that one of the age groups profits more from 
treatment. The preventive effect of the ERT can not be concluded from this (short-term) analysis. The 
results of the registry are to be awaited to provide more (long-term) data. 
Issue resolved.

Question 8. 
For height and growth velocity (y-axis) the MAH should plot against age (x-axis), and the 
CDC and the published MSP growth curves should be incorporated (refer to the publication 
by P. Harmatz et al., Molecular Genetics and Metabolism 109 (2013) 54–61). Graphs should 
be submitted for males and females separately. 
MAH Response: 
As requested, the MAH has provided plots for male and female height versus age in the MOR-001 and 
MOR-005 population with both the published MPS growth curves and the CDC growth curves (see 
Figure 8.1). As discussed in the publication by Harmatz 2013 (based on MOR-001 data) and Montaño 
2007, MPS IVA patients are for the most part significantly shorter than the unaffected population, but 
show considerable variation. There are no clear differences in height between the MOR-001 population 
and the MOR-005 population.

ITT trial population with CDC and MPS IV growth curves.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
It is agreed with the MAH that no distinctive differences in height were observed between the MOR005 
study and the natural history (MOR-001). In general, Morquio A patients are smaller than the healthy 
population. 
However, it is curious that the eldest patient in the MOR-005 study was about 49 years of age (see 
Table 1 in this report) and the figures display patients aged 50 and over. In the placebo controlled 
phase the eldest patient included was about 57 years.  
Issue not resolved, however not further pursued. 
Question 9. 
The MAH is requested to submit the “Drug-Related Adverse Events by Preferred Term in ≥ 
10%” stratified by age-groups (<18 years and ≥18 years). This to confirm that the safety 
profile in paediatric patients is similar to those observed in the adults. If appropriate the 
MAH is requested to update SmPC section 4.8. 
MAH Response: 
As reported in section 4.8 of the SmPC, the patients in the placebo-controlled trial were ages 5 to 57 
years old. The vast majority (80.3%) of the patients were patients 18 or younger. Amongst these 
patients the events of pyrexia, rash, and nausea were less than 5% higher in this group than in those 
19 or older. With the exception of vomiting, all other events were less common in the younger 
population. Although vomiting was observed in almost 10% more paediatric patients, it is already 
classified as very common in the EU SmPC therefore, the frequency would not change and an update 
would not be required.  
Table 9.1 provides the Drug-Related Adverse Events by Preferred Term stratified by adult (≥19 years) 
and paediatric (≤18 years) patient populations. The MAH concludes that the safety profile for both 
sub-populations is similar, with the most common events related to infusion associated reactions.

There appeared to be a larger proportion (>10% greater) of adult patients with fatigue, chest 
discomfort, chills, hypertension and arthralgia than in the paediatric population. BioMarin determined 
events in the MOR 004 study were adverse drug reactions using the following criteria: (1) Events 
observed in patients receiving active drug must have a 5% or higher incidence than placebo, (2) The 
event must have a plausible, clinically meaningful relationship to drug (3) Severe events that were 
plausible and clinically meaningful were included without regards to the number of events. In MOR-
004, the events of chest discomfort, rash and urticaria did meet criteria in the context of an infusion 
related reaction. Based on data provided, the MAH does not believe an update to the SmPC is required 
at this time.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
It is agreed with the MAH that the safety profile for both sub-populations is comparable, with the most 
common events related to infusion associated reactions. There appeared to be a larger proportion 
(>10% greater) of adult patients with fatigue, chest discomfort, chills, hypertension and arthralgia 
than in the paediatric population. In the currently approved SmPC these adverse events are already 
stated, hence there is no need to update section 4.8 at this moment.  
Issue resolved. 
Question 10. 
The SmPC in section 4.8 mentions “…Infusion reactions (IRs) occurring in ≥ 10% of 
patients treated with Vimizim.” and “IRs were generally mild or moderate, and the 
frequency was higher during the first 12 weeks of treatment and tended to occur less 
frequently with time.” However, in the combined safety population of studies MOR-004 and 
MOR-005, nearly all patients (98.3%) reported Infusion Associated Reactions (IARs). The 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/711038/2017  
Page 79/81 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
   
 
 
 
MAH should discuss whether the frequency of IRs in this study was higher than already 
described in the SmPC and, if needed, propose amendments of the SmPC wording. 
MAH Response: 
The current SmPC states that the majority of adverse reactions in clinical trials were Infusion reactions 
(IRs). The most common symptoms of these IRs were identified as those occurring in ≥10% of all 
patients treated with Vimizim and an incidence of ≥5% more, in the patients receiving active drug 
when compared to those receiving placebo in MOR-004. 
In MOR 004, the most common symptoms of IARs included pyrexia (36.2%) vomiting (37.9%), and 
headache (32.8%) in patients receiving 2.0 mg/kg/ week. In the combined safety population, the most 
common symptoms of IRs were pyrexia (51.4%), vomiting (49.1%), and headache (46.8%). These 
symptoms are currently described in the SmPC with a frequency categorized as very common. Since 
these events were similar to the most common AEs overall and are already categorized as very 
common, the sponsor believes that an amendment to the SmPC at this time is not warranted. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
It is agreed with the MAH that currently no update for SmPC section 4.8 is needed.  
Issue resolved.

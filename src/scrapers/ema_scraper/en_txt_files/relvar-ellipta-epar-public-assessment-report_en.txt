the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  for  Relvar  Ellipta,  through  the  centralised  procedure  under 
Article  3  (2)  (a)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004.  The  eligibility  to  the  centralised  procedure  was 
agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 15 December 2011.  
The applicant applied for the following indications: 
Asthma Indication: 
Relvar Ellipta is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years 
and older, where use of a combination product (long-acting beta2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is 
appropriate. 
COPD Indication: 
Relvar  Ellipta  is  indicated  for  symptomatic  treatment  of  patients  with  COPD  with  a  FEV1  <70% 
predicted normal (post-bronchodilator) in patients with an exacerbation history. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article  8.3  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  -  complete  and  independent  application.  The  applicant  indicated 
that  fluticasone  furoate  was  considered  to  be  a  known  active  substance  and  vilanterol  a  new  active 
substance. 
The  application  submitted  is  composed  of  administrative  information,  complete  quality  data,  non-
clinical  and  clinical  data  based  on  applicants’  own  tests  and  studies  and/or  bibliographic  literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  7  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision 
P/0049/2012 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) and on the granting of a class 
waiver for the condition “COPD” (EMA/825560/2008). 
At  the  time  of  submission  of  the  application,  the  PIP  P/0049/2012  was  not  yet  completed  as  some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000,  the  applicant  did  not  submit  a  critical  report  addressing  the  possible  similarity  with 
authorised  orphan  medicinal  products  because  there  is  no  authorised  orphan  medicinal  product  for  a 
condition related to the proposed indications. 
New active Substance status 
The  applicant  requested  the  active  substance  vilanterol  (as  trifenatate)  contained  in  the  above 
medicinal product to  be  considered  as  a  new  active  substance  in  itself,  as  it is  not  a  constituent  of  a 
product previously authorised within the Union.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Asthma is a chronic pulmonary disease characterized by airway inflammation, bronchoconstriction and 
increased  airway  responsiveness  [Global  Initiative  in  Asthma  (GINA)  Guideline,  2011]  affecting  1%-
18%  of  the  population  across  different  countries.  The  mortality,  morbidity  and  costs  associated  with 
asthma  are  substantial.  Inhaled  corticosteroids  (ICS)  are  considered  the  most  effective  anti-
inflammatory treatments for all severities of persistent asthma [GINA Guideline, 2011], resulting in a 
control  of  asthma  symptoms,  improvement  in  quality  of  life  and  lung  function  and  reduction  in  the 
frequency  and  severity  of  asthma  exacerbations.  Add-on  therapy  with  inhaled  LABA  is  preferred  to 
increasing the dose of ICS to achieve asthma control, and is associated with improvement in symptom 
scores,  decreases in  nocturnal  asthma  symptoms,  improvement in  lung  function  and  reduction of  the 
number  of  asthma  exacerbations.  Without  concomitant  ICS  inhaled  LABA  may  be  associated  with 
increased  risk  of  serious  asthma-related  events  (including  hospitalisation,  intubation  and  death),  and 
therefore inhaled LABA therapy should not be used as monotherapy in asthma [GINA Guideline, 2011]. 
Chronic  Obstructive  Pulmonary  Disease  (COPD)  is  a  common  disease  that  accounts  for  5%  of  deaths 
globally  [World  Health  Organisation  (WHO)  2012].  As  a  leading  cause  of  morbidity  and  mortality 
worldwide,  COPD  produces  a  substantial,  and  growing,  economic  and  social  burden  [GOLD,  2011]. 
COPD  is  characterised  by  persistent,  usually  progressive,  airflow  limitation  associated  with  an 
enhanced  inflammatory  response  in  the  airways  and  the  lungs.  Exacerbations  and  comorbidities 
contribute  to  the  overall  severity  [Global  Initiative  for  Obstructive  Lung  Disease  (GOLD),  2011].  An 
exacerbation  is  an  acute  event  characterised  by  a  worsening  of  the  symptoms  of  COPD  that  require 
treatment  with  oral  corticosteroids  and/or  antibiotics  (moderate  exacerbations)  or  that  require  an  in-
patient  hospitalization  (severe  exacerbations).  The  goals  of  pharmacologic  therapy  in  COPD  are  the 
reduction  in  symptoms  and  in  the  frequency  and  severity  of  exacerbations,  and  the  improvement  of 
health  status  and  exercise  tolerance  [GOLD,  2011].  Bronchodilators,  such  as  long-acting  beta2 
agonists (LABA), are key to improving lung function and managing symptoms in COPD. In patients not 
adequately controlled with a LABA, the addition of a ICS usually leads to reductions in the frequency of 
exacerbations,  improves  symptoms  and  quality  of  life  and  produces  small  improvements  in  lung 
function [GOLD, 2011].  
About the product 
Relvar  Ellipta  100 µg/25 µg  &  200 µg/25 µg  inhalation  powder  is  a  pre-dispensed  multi  dose  dry 
powder  for  oral  inhalation.  The  active  ingredients  are  fluticasone  furoate  (FF)  and  Vilanterol  (VI)  (as 
trifenatate). FF is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with potent anti-inflammatory activity, while 
VI is a selective long-acting, beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA).

Assessment report  
EMA/282960/2013

The  novel  dry  powder  inhaler  (NDPI),  called  Ellipta,  incorporates  two  blister  strips,  one  containing  a 
blend  of  micronised  FF  and  lactose  monohydrate  and  the  other  containing  a  blend  of  micronised  VI, 
lactose monohydrate and magnesium stearate. Upon actuation, the inhaler delivers the contents of one 
blister containing FF blend and one blister containing VI blend.  
Relvar Ellipta is a novel ICS/LABA fixed dose combination for oral inhalation administered from a Novel 
Dry  Powder  Inhaler  (NDPI).  It  contains  fluticasone  furoate  (FF;  GW685698X),  an  ICS,  and  vilanterol 
(VI;  vilanterol trifenatate;  GW642444M),  an  inhaled  LABA.  Neither  FF  nor  VI  is  currently  available  as 
an  individual  component  for  oral  inhalation  However,  FF  is  the  active  substance  in  Avamys,  an 
intranasal corticosteroid authorised via the Centralised Procedure. 
It  should  be  noted  that  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  dossier  referred  to  Relvar  Ellipta  100 
μg/25 µg and 200 µg/25 µg as the finished medicinal product, which corresponds to the metered dose 
of both active substances. This was the basis used during the assessment of this application. However 
in  accordance  with  the  “Guideline  on  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SmPC)  and  QRD 
Recommendations on the expression of strength in the name of Centrally Authorised Human Medicinal 
Products”  (as  stated  in  Section  1  of  the  SmPC  and  in  the  name  section  of  the  Labelling  and  Package 
Leaflet),  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  strength  should  refer  to  the  delivered  dose  of  both  active 
substances  and  therefore  the  name  of  the  medicinal  product  finally  approved  by  the  Committee  was 
expressed as follows: Relvar Ellipta 92 μg/22 µg and 184 µg/22 µg, in all official approved documents 
(CHMP  opinion/future  EC  decision  and  CHMP  assessment  report).  Since 100  μg/25  µg  and  200  µg/25 
µg (metered dose) were the strengths referred to throughout the non-clinical and clinical development 
of this medicinal product and the data submitted in the application, this has been left unchanged in the 
sections of this assessment report relating to the non-clinical and clinical development.  
The Applicant initially applied for the following two indications:  
•  Regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older where use of a 
combination product (long-acting beta2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate. 
•  Symptomatic  treatment  of  patients  with  COPD  with  a  FEV1<70%  predicted  normal  (post-
bronchodilator) in patients with an exacerbation history. 
In asthma, the posology requested is one inhalation of Relvar Ellipta 100 μg/25 μg once daily (OD). If 
patients  are  inadequately  controlled  on  Relvar  Ellipta  100 mcg/25 μg  OD,  the  dose  of  Relvar  Ellipta 
200 μg/25 μg should be considered.  
In  COPD,  the  posology  requested is one  inhalation of  Relvar  Ellipta  100 mcg/25 μg  OD.  Relvar  Ellipta 
200 μg/25 mcg is  not  recommended in  COPD,  due  to  lack  of  superior efficacy  compared  to  the  lower 
dose, and increase in risk of pneumonia and other adverse events.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Relvar Ellipta is a pre-dispensed inhalation powder which is presented in a plastic inhaler. The inhaler 
contains two multi-dose blister strips, both strips have either 14 or 30 of pre-filled blisters. One strip 
contains  25  micrograms  of  vilanterol  (as  vilanterol  trifenatate)  per  blister;  the  other  strip  contains 
either  100  micrograms  or  200  micrograms  of  fluticasone  furoate  per  blister.  Lactose  monohydrate  is 
included as a diluent/carrier in both inhalation powders; magnesium stearate is included as a chemical 
stabiliser in the vilanterol blisters only. The composition is described in section 6.1. of the SmPC. Two 
strengths  have  been  developed:  fluticasone  furoate  and  vilanterol  trifenatate  100  micrograms/25 
micrograms and 200 micrograms/25 micrograms. When actuated, the inhaler delivers the contents of a 
single  blister  simultaneously  from  each  of  the  two  blister  strips.  Each  actuation  provides  a  delivered 
dose  of  92  micrograms  of  fluticasone  furoate  and  22  micrograms  of  vilanterol  (as  trifenatate)  in  the 
case  of  the  100/25  presentation,  or  184  micrograms  of  fluticasone  furoate  and  22  micrograms  of 
vilanterol (as trifenatate) in the case of the 200/25 presentation. The inhaler is packaged in a sealed 
tray with a desiccant.  
The Applicant has received scientific advice from the EMA on the development of Relvar Ellipta and has 
complied with it. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Relvar  Ellipta  contains  two  active  substances:  fluticasone  furoate,  an  established  corticosteroid,  and 
vilanterol trifenatate, a novel long-acting β2 agonist. 
Fluticasone furoate 
The  applicant  is  the  marketing  authorisation  holder  of  another  centrally  authorised  medicinal  product 
(Avamys) that contains fluticasone furoate as active substance. The quality of fluticasone furoate used 
in  Relvar  Ellipta  is  identical  to  the  one  used  in  Avamys  with  the  exception  of  its  particle  size 
distribution. Full information on fluticasone furoate has been provided in this application. 
Fluticasone furoate is a white crystalline, non-hygroscopic powder that is practically insoluble in water 
and slightly soluble in acetone, dimethylsulphoxide and ethanol. 
The chemical name is (6α,11β,16α,17α)-6,9-Difluoro-17-{[(fluoromethyl)thio]carbonyl}-11-hydroxy-
16-methyl-3-oxoandrosta-1,4-dien-17-yl 2-furancarboxylate and it has the following structural

IR,  X-ray  crystallography.  Fluticasone  furoate  exhibits  stereoisomerism  due  to  the  presence  of  nine 
chiral  centers.  Polymorphism  has  been  observed  for  fluticasone  furoate,  the  synthesis  process 
consistently yields one polymorphic form. 
Manufacture 
Non-micronised fluticasone furoate is supplied by one active substance manufacturer. It is synthesised 
by a 6-step process followed by micronisation, which is performed at another site. The manufacturing 
process  development  was  already  assessed  within  a  previous  marketing  authorisation  application 
fromthe same applicant. The starting materials and reagents are well defined and adequate in-process 
controls  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  For  each  step  of  the  manufacturing  synthesis,  acceptable 
ranges have been defined for the manufacturing process parameters.  
The synthesis process consistently results in the polymorph which is thermodynamically most stable at 
room temperature. Attention was paid to the optimisation of the micronisation process in view of the 
particle size distribution specifications for the micronized drug substance in the medicinal product.  
In  addition  to  the  initial  manufacturing  process,  the  dossier  includes  an  alternative  manufacturing 
process for fluticasone furoate which differs slightly in only two steps. Comparative batch analysis data 
for  fluticasone  furoate  batches  manufactured  by  both  processes  (at  pilot  and  commercial  scale) 
demonstrated that the two processes are comparable. Only one additional impurity was detected in the 
batches prepared by the alternative method and the impurity has been included in the drug substance 
specification. 
Specification 
The fluticasone furoate specification in Relvar Ellipta is the same as for Avamys, with the exception of 
the  controls  on  the  particle  size  distribution.  The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for 
description  (visual),  identity  and  solid  state  form  (IR),  fluticasone  furoate  content  (HPLC),  related 
impurities (HPLC), residual solvent (GC), water content (Karl Fischer titration), residue on ignition and 
particle size distribution (laser diffraction). The absence of a microbial limit test is justified on the basis 
of batch results and the fact that antimicrobial reagents and/or heating are used in the manufacturing 
process. 
It has been demonstrated that the assay results and impurity levels are not affected by micronisation 
and  therefore  it  was  found  acceptable  to  perform  the  assay  and  content  of  related  impurities  on  the 
non-micronised drug substance. The limits for impurities have been qualified for the inhalation route in 
safety assessment studies. It is considered acceptable that the specification does not include a test for 
enantiomeric purity on the basis that no new chiral centres are formed during the synthesis of the drug 
substance, the absolute stereochemistry is the same as that of the starting material. All analytical test 
procedures used for the specifications have been adequately validated. 
Batch  analysis  data  for  three  production  scale  batches  of  the  active  substance  (non-micronised  and 
micronised) have been provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to 
batch. 
Stability 
Stability  studies  have  been  conducted  on  threeproduction  scale  batches  of  micronised  and 
threebatches  of  non-micronised  active  substance  manufactured  using  the  proposed  commercial 
process.

Photostability  studies  have  been  performed  to  study  the  sensitivity  of  the  active  substance  to  light. 
Stress  testing  was  performed  on  3  batches  of  micronised  and  on  one  batch  of  non-micronised 
fluticasone  furoate.  The  micronised  batches  were  stored  for  up  to  3  months  at  25°C/80%  RH, 
40°C/75% RH, and 50°C/ambient humidity; the non-micronised batch was stored for up to 3 months 
at 25°C/80% RH and 40°C/75% RH. 
Forced degradation studies were also conducted in the solid state (4 weeks at 80ºC under ambient and 
75% relative humidity), and in solution under acidic, basic and oxidative conditions, and on exposure 
to light, in order to identify potential degradation pathways. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  drug  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container and 
proposed storage conditions. 
Vilanterol trifenatate 
Vilanterol  trifenatate  is  the  second  active  substance  in  Relvar  Ellipta.  It  is  a  white,  non-hygroscopic 
powder  that  is  practically  insoluble  in  water;  practically  insoluble  in  heptane;  very  slightly  soluble  in 
toluene  and  t-methyl  butyl  ether;  slightly  soluble  in  acetonitrile,  ethanol  and  2-propanol;  soluble  in 
methanol; freely soluble in dichloromethane and dimethyl sulfoxide.  
The  chemical  name  of  vilanterol  trifenatate  is:  triphenylacetic  acid  -  4-{(1R)-2-[(6-{2-[(2,6-
dichlorobenzyl)oxy]ethoxy}hexyl)amino]-1-hydroxyethyl}-2-(hydroxymethyl)phenol  and  it  has  the 
following structural formula: 
Vilanterol  trifenatate  is  the  triphenylacetate  salt  of  vilanterol,  a  secondary  amine.  It  contains  one 
asymmetric carbon; the drug substance is the R-isomer. The molecular structure of vilanterol has been 
elucidated by proton and carbon NMR, MS, IR, elemental analysis and X-ray crystallography. 
Vilanterol  exhibits  stereoisomerism  due  to  the  presence  of  one  chiral  center.  Enantiomeric  purity  is 
controlled routinely by chiral HPLC. Polymorphism has not been observed for vilanterol trifenatate. 
Manufacture 
Micronised vilanterol trifenatate is supplied by one active substance manufacturer. It is synthesised by 
a process followed by micronisation. Micronisation is performed at another site. 
Vilanterol  trifenatate  was  developed  using  a  ‘quality  by  design’  (QbD)  approach  which  involved  the 
identification of potential critical process parameters (CPPs) that might have an impact on the critical 
quality attributes (CQAs) of the drug substance. Proven acceptable ranges (PAR) or ranges have been 
proposed for the CPP. A detailed description of the manufacturing process has been provided and the 
scaling-up  of  the  PARs/ranges  has  been  justified.  Well  defined  starting  materials  and  reagents  have 
been used and adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis.

Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  description  (visual),  identity  (IR),  vilanterol 
trifenatate  content  (HPLC),  related  impurities  (HPLC),  enantiomer  content  (chiral  HPLC),  residual 
solvent  (GC),  water  content  (Karl  Fischer  titration),  residue  on  ignition  and  particle  size  distribution 
(laser  diffraction).  The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial 
methods have been appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch  analysis  data  have  been  provided  for  sixteen  production  scale  batches  of  non-micronised 
vilanterol  trifenatate  manufactured  using  the  commercial  process.  From  twelve  of  these  batches,  51 
batches of micronised vilanterol trifenatate have been produced and analysed. All batches tested were 
found to comply with the pre-defined specifications. The results demonstrate that the active ingredient 
can be manufactured reproducibly. 
Stability 
Stability  data  obtained  under  ICH  long-term  conditions  (25ºC/60%  RH)  and  accelerated  conditions 
(40ºC/75%  RH)  have  been  provided  for  6  batches  of  micronized  vilanterol  and  two  batches  of  non-
micronised  vilanterol.  Up  to  36  months  long  term  data  for  micronised  and  up  to  48  months  for  non-
micronised  vilanterol  and  up  to  6  months  accelerated  stability  data  were  presented.  The  stability 
batches  have  been  manufactured  by  the  proposed  commercial  process  at  the  commercial  scale  and 
were packed in the containers representative of those intended for marketing. 
Photostability  testing  and  stress  testing  was  performed  on  2  batches  each  of  micronised  and  non-
micronised  vilanterol  trifenatate.  The  stress  testing  conditions  include:  50°C/ambient  humidity; 
freeze/thaw conditions, storage under reduced packaging and exposure to light. 
Furthermore,  forced  degradation  studies  were  conducted  under  elevated  temperature  and  relative 
humidity, under acidic, basic and oxidative conditions and under UV/visible light exposure. 
The  following  parameters  were  tested:  description,  vilanterol  trifenatate  content,  impurities, 
enantiomer  content,  water  content,  particle  size  distribution  of  the  micronised  and  non-micronised 
drug substance by laser diffraction, specific surface area of the non-micronised drug substance and of 
the micronised vilanterol trifenatate (nitrogen gas adsorption), solid state form (XRPD) and the melting 
point/amorphous  content  (differential  scanning  calorimetry).  The  analytical  tests  used  are  stability 
indicating. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  drug  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container and 
proposed storage conditions. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The  goal  was  to  develop  a  dry  powder  inhaler  that  would  deliver  fluticasone  furoate  in  combination 
with  vilanterol  trifenatate.  It  was  decided  to  formulate  the  drug  substances  in  two  separate  powders 
for inhalation within a single inhaler. This approach allowed for independent formulation development 
and optimisation of the inhalation powders and required the development of a novel dry powder inhaler 
capable  of  delivering  pre-metered  doses  from  two  blister  strips  simultaneously.  The  inhaler  has  been 
designed to provide up to thirty days therapy and it incorporates a counter which shows the number of 
doses remaining.

A quality by design (QbD) approach was adopted for product development. The following critical quality 
attributes (CQAs) were identified for the drug product: identity, drug-related impurities, emitted dose, 
particle  size distribution  of  the  emitted  dose  (PSD), foreign  particulate  matter,  microbiological  quality 
and leachables. Three of the drug product CQAs (identity, PSD and drug-related impurities) were found 
to  be  strongly  related  to  the  quality  attributes  of  the  micronized  fluticasone  furoate  and  vilanterol 
trifenatate.  Multiple  linear  regression  (MLR)  was  used  to  model  the  fine  particle  mass  per  inhalation 
from the particle size distribution of both active substances.  
The  applicant  performed  a  risk  assessment  (Failure  Modes  and  Effects  Analysis)  to  identify  the 
manufacturing process parameters that needed to be further studied in development and defined their 
criticality. Univariate and multivariate (DOE) studies have been performed to identify and confirm CPP 
and ranges/set points have been defined for the critical process parameters.  
The  excipients  used  in  Relvar  Ellipta  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is 
compliant  with  Ph.  Eur  standards  and  additional  in-house  standards.  There  are  no  novel  excipients 
used  in  the  finished  product  formulation.  The  fluticasone  furoate  blister  contains  only  lactose 
monohydrate  (diluent/carrier)  as  excipient.  The  excipients  in  the  vilanterol  blister  are  magnesium 
stearate  (stabiliser)  and lactose  monohydrate  (diluent/carrier).  The  presence of  lactose  is  reflected in 
section 2 of the SmPC. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
A  novel  inhalation  device  containing  two  separate  blister  strips  has  been  developed  to  allow  optimal 
inhalation  of  the  active  substances.  The  blister  strips  are  made  of  a  formed  silver  coloured  base  foil 
laminate,  sealed  with  a  peelable  lid  foil  laminate.  Confirmation  that  the  packaging  materials  comply 
with the current EU requirements has been provided. 
The  inhaler  has  a  light  grey  body  and  a  pale  blue  mouthpiece.  It  is  packed  in  a  foil  tray  which  also 
contains  a  desiccant.  Adequate  information  on  the  design  and  composition  of  the  inhaler  has  been 
included in the product information. 
Adventitious agents 
Lactose monohydrate is of animal origin and magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin. 
Manufacture of the product 
Relvar  Ellipta  is  manufactured  by  a  standard  manufacturing  process  that  involves  the  following 
operations:  fluticasone  furoate  blending,  filling  of  the  fluticasone  furoate  strip,  vilanterol  blending, 
filling of the vilanterol strip, assembly of the inhaler and packing.   
A  ‘quality  by  design’  (QbD)  approach  was  used  in  the  development  of  Relvar  Ellipta.  The  process 
parameters  and  attributes  that  could  potentially  affect  drug  product  CQAs  were  investigated  and  the 
critical process parameters have been adequately identified. The manufacturing process is adequately 
described and critical steps are under control.  
The data collected as part of process qualification indicate that the manufacturing process is robust and 
will consistently yield a product of acceptable quality.  The process has been validated for ten batches 
of  inhalers  containing  fluticasone  furoate/vilanterol  100/25  µg  and  for  four  batches  of  inhalers 
containing  fluticasone  furoate/vilanterol  200/25  µg.  These  batches  were  produced  using  the  final 
manufacturing  processes  for  blending,  filling  and  assembly  and  by  a  representative  process  for 
packing, all performed at the commercial site and at a commercial scale. A process validation protocol 
has been provided and the process validation studies will be finalised prior to commercialisation. 
All sites involved in the manufacture of the drug product are appropriately documented as complying 
with GMP.

Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  appearance,  identification  of 
fluticasone furoate and vilanterol (UV, HPLC-UV, HPLC-fluorescence), mean fluticasone furoate content 
and  mean  vilanterol  content  per  blister  (both  100  ±  5%  of  nominal  blister  content  by  HPLC), 
fluticasone furoate uniformity of delivered dose (HPLC), vilanterol uniformity of delivered dose (HPLC), 
fine  particle  mass  of  fluticasone  furoate  and  vilanterol  (by  next  generation  impaction)  and 
microbiological  quality  of  fluticasone  furoate  and  of  vilanterol.  The  analytical  methods  have  been 
adequately validated.    
Batch  analysis  data  have  been  presented  for  seven  production-scale  batches  of  fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol 100/25 µg and fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 200/25 µg inhalation powders. For both 
strengths,  results  have  been  presented  for  four  batches  in  the  30-dose  and  three  batches  in  the  14-
dose  presentations.  The  batches  were  all  produced  at  the  intended  site  of  manufacture.  All  fourteen 
batches  for  which  results  have  been  provided  complied  fully  with  the  release  specification  presented 
above.  The  data  confirm  consistency  and  uniformity  of  manufacture  and  indicate  that  the  process  is 
capable of consistently producing a finished product that meets the predefined specifications and that 
the manufacturing process is under control. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data have been generated under long-term (25ºC/60%RH), intermediate (30ºC/75%RH), and 
accelerated  (40ºC/75%RH)  conditions  in  line  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Up  to  24  months  primary 
stability  data  for  fluticasone  furoate/vilanterol  inhalation  powder  are  presented  for  three  batches  of 
each 100/25 microgram and 200/25 microgram product in two foil laminate secondary packs (tray and 
overwrap),  both  containing  a  desiccant  packet.  These  batches  were  produced  at  production-scale  at 
the proposed commercial site using commercial equipment, (except representative equipment used for 
packing  into  tray).  The  primary  pack  (blister  strip)  is  identical  to  the  one  intended  for 
commercialisation,  and  the  tray  and  inhaler  used  in  the  stability  studies  are  representative  of  the 
commercial  one.  The  tests  performed  are  the  same  as  those  in  the  shelf-life  specification  with  3 
additional tests and are considered to be stability indicating.  
In-use  stability  data  have  been  generated  using  both  initial  and  aged  (e.g.  12,  16  and  22.5  months) 
samples  stored  at  25  °C/60%  RH,25°C/75%  RH  and  30°C/75%  RH  for  up  to  3  months  following 
removal from their secondary packs. The in-use studies were conducted for both strengths. Based on 
the  in-use  stability  data,  the  applicant  tightened  the  release  specifications  to ensure  that  the product 
does not go out of specification during its in-use period. The secondary pack integrity was identified as 
critical  because  it  could  affect  the  content  of  drug-related  impurities  and/or  the  particle-size 
distribution. The integrity of the pack is tested using an automated vacuum pack tester.  
In addition, the applicant has performed the following stress testing studies: freeze/thaw studies, and 
studies at 5 ºC and 50 ºC. 
The  shelf-life  specifications  include  the  same  tests  as  for  release  with  the  exception  of  the  following 
three  additional  tests:  fluticasone  furoate  and  vilanterol  drug-related  impurities  (HPLC)  and  mean 
moisture content. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC 
are acceptable.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information  on  the  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  active  substances  and  finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner and adequate information has been provided on 
the design and testing of the inhalation device. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.  
The  applicant  has  applied  QbD  principles  in  the  development  of  the  active  substance  and  finished 
product  and  their  manufacturing  process.  However,  no  design  spaces  were  claimed  for  the 
manufacturing process of the active substance, nor for the finished product. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a no unresolved quality issues impacting the benefit/risk 
ratio of the product.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A  comprehensive  non-clinical  development  was  conducted  to  support  the  chronic  use  of  fluticasone 
furoate  and  of  vilanterol  in  humans.  The  non-clinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetic,  and  toxicology 
studies  reported  in  this  dossier  were  conducted  respecting  the  established  guidelines.  Non-clinical 
studies  conducted  with  the  combination  of  fluticasone  furoate  and  vilanterol  were  limited  to  primary 
pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, repeat-dose toxicity studies and reproduction toxicity studies in 
line  with  the  Guideline  on  the  non-clinical  development  of  fixed  combinations  of  medicinal  products 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Pivotal studies regarding fluticasone furoate, vilanterol and the combination of fluticasone furoate and 
vilanterol were performed in compliance with GLP.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Glucocorticoid receptor binding 
In  vitro,  GW685698  bound  with  high  affinity  to  the  human  glucocorticoid  receptor  (GR)  and  with 
significantly  greater  affinity  than  fluticasone  propionate,  budesonide  and  dexamethasone  and 
dissociates  very  slowly  from  the  receptor.  X-ray  crystal  analysis  of  the  GR  ligand  binding  domain 
revealed that in the GW685698 structure, the furoate substituent fully occupied a 17α pocket making a 
number  of  hydrophobic  packing  interactions  with  the  side  chains  lining  the  pocket  which  was  more 
significant  than  that  seen  with  the  fluticasone  propionate  structure  (Report  RR2006/00018/00).    The 
difference  in  receptor  affinity  between  GW685698  versus  fluticasone  propionate  may  be  due  to 
increased hydrophobic packing interactions in the 17α pocket. 
Glucocorticoid receptor functional assays 
Activated GR affects a number of downstream pathways  via a transrepressive mechanism - inhibiting 
the function of certain transcription factors such as Nuclear Factor κB (NFκB)  and Activated Protein-1 
(AP-1),  or  through  a  transactivation  mechanism  where  the  GR  binds  directly  to  DNA  to  cause  an 
increase in the transcription of certain gene products [Barnes, 1998].  The influence of GW685698, the 
primary metabolite of GW685698 - GW694301X (M10), and a number of other clinically used steroids 
on these downstream signalling pathways was assessed in a variety of in vitro cellular assays. 
Effect of transrepression: 
The  transrepressive  effects  of  GW685698,  its  major  metabolite  GW694301X  (M10)  and  a  number  of 
clinically used steroids were investigated in NFκB and AP-1 assays. In the NFκB assay, the ability of the 
test  compounds  to  inhibit  tumour  necrosis  factor-α  (TNF-α)-induced  NFκB  function  was  assessed  in 
human  A549  (caucasian  lung  carcinoma)  cells  transfected  with  a  vector  containing  the  secreted 
alkaline phosphatase (SPAP) gene driven by a fragment of the ELAM promoter containing binding sites 
for NFκB. In the AP-1 assay, the ability of the test compound to inhibit epidermal growth factor (EGF)-
induced AP-1-dependent increases in luminescence was assessed in human A549 cells transfected with 
a  vector  containing  the  firefly  luciferase  gene  driven  by  the  minimal  interleukin  (IL)-2  promoter 
containing AP-1 binding sites. 
GW685698  was  found  to  potently  inhibit  TNFα-induced  NFκB  function  and  an  EGF-induced  AP-1-
dependent  increase  in  luminescence,  with  comparable  potency  to  fluticasone  propionate  and 
mometasone furoate. The metabolite GW694301X (M10) showed only very weak activity in functional 
assays  (>6000-fold  weaker  than  GW685698)  and  will  therefore  contribute  negligible  glucocorticoid 
activity in vivo. 
In  the  NFκB  inhibition  assay,  GR694301X  was  found  to  be  a  less  potent  agonist  (pEC50  6.5  ±  0.2; 
n=10) than other steroids tested and between 1000- to 10000-fold weaker than GW685698 depending 
on  assay  dilution  conditions,  therefore,  the  metabolite  is  unlikely  to  contribute  to  steroidal  activity  at 
therapeutic doses.

The  effect  of  GW685698  and  a  number  of  clinically  used  steroids  on  the  pro-inflammatory  NFkB 
transcription factor pathway was further examined in the human lung A549 epithelial cell line using an 
improved  steroid  dilution  methodology  which  avoided  loss  of  test  compound  through  precipitation. 
A549  cells  expressing  SPAP  were  incubated  with  test  compound  and  TNFα  for  15  hours,  and  the 
activation  of  the  NFκB  transcription  pathway  was  measured  spectrophotometrically  as  previously 
performed. 
TNFα-induced  NFκB  function  was  inhibited  by  GW685698  with  comparable  potency  to  fluticasone 
propionate and mometasone furoate. GW685698 also produced a maximal inhibitory response similar 
to that seen with fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate. Budesonide, another clinically used 
glucocorticoid,  had  a  substantially  weaker  potency  for  the  inhibition  of  TNFα-induced  NFκB  function 
than  GW685698.  GW694301X  (M10)  showed  only  very  weak  activity  in  this  assay  (>10000-fold 
weaker than GW685698). 
The differences observed in the NFκB EC50 inhibition values between the studies amounts to the new 
methodology  employed  in  the  various  reports  where  precipitation  of  the  compound  is  prevented  thus 
prohibiting  a  loss  of  compound  and  an  overestimation  of  the  test  compound’s  concentration  and 
therefore an underestimation of potency.  
Effects on transactivation: 
Transactivation  effects  of  GW685698,  GW694301X  (M10)  and  several  clinically  used  glucocorticoids 
were investigated in human lung epithelial cell lines using 2 different glucocorticoid response element 
(GRE)  transactivation  assays.  In  addition,  a  rat  liver  cell  assay  was  used  to  examine  transactivation 
activity  of  the  test  compounds  in  an  endogenous  GRE  system  using  the  classical  GRE-driven  gene 
product tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) assay. 
Overall, GW685698 potently increased transactivation in the human GRE, MMTV-GRE and endogenous 
TAT assays, with comparable potency to fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate.  GW694301X 
(M10) showed only very weak activity in the MMTV-GRE and endogenous TAT tests, i.e., 8000- to 
11000-fold weaker than GW685698, consistent with the NFκB data. 
Inhibition of cytokine release: 
GW685698  was  found  to  potently  inhibit  the  TNFα-induced  release  of  IL-8  from  the  bronchial  cells 
(IC50  =  3.5  pM)  with  comparable  potency  to  fluticasone  propionate  (IC50  =  7.25  pM)  and 
mometasone furoate (IC50 = 5 pM). Flunisolide and budesonide had far higher IC50 values of 590 and 
48 pM, respectively, demonstrating their weaker GR activity. 
GW685698  has  the  greatest  inhibitory  potency  for  TNF  release  from  LPS-activated  human  primary 
peripheral  mononuclear  cells  in  vitro  compared  to  clinically  used  inhaled  glucocorticoids  fluticasone 
propionate,  budesonide,  ciclesonide  active  principle  (CAP)  and  prednisolone.    pIC50  values  are  as 
follows:  GW685698,  9.93;  fluticasone  propionate,  9.63;  budesonide,  8.41;  CAP,  8.5;  prednisolone, 
7.23. 
Duration and rate of action studies: 
In  a  series  of  in  vitro  functional  assays  examining  the  duration  and  rate  of  action  of  GW685698 
compared to fluticasone propionate, sustained inhibition of cytokine synthesis (IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF) 
was  achieved  with  GW658698  and  was  also  accompanied  by  a longer  duration  of  action  compared to 
other clinically used steroids.

In  monolayer  of  human  lung  epithelial  (16HBE14o-)  cells,  GW685698  had  a  greater  tissue  retention 
compared  to  fluticasone  propionate  as  well  as  a  greater  level  of  binding  to  a  suspension  of  sliced 
human lung tissue. 
In examining the protective effects of steroids on airway epithelial barrier, GW685698 demonstrated a 
highly  efficacious  cellular  protection  from  protease  induced  damage  with  a  potency  greater  than  that 
seen with fluticasone propionate, mometasone furoate and other clinically used steroids.  Furthermore, 
GW685698 was more potent in inducing a decrease in epithelial permeability. 
Steroid receptor selectivity: 
The  selectivity  of  GW685698  for  the  GR  over  a  number  of  other  steroid  receptor  subtypes  was 
examined  in  vitro.  GW685698  was  highly  selective  for  the  human  GR  over  other  human  steroid 
hormone  receptor  subtypes.  Selectivity  ranged  from  approximately  32-  to  >300000-fold,  and  was 
similar  to  that  seen  with  fluticasone  propionate  and  substantially  better  than  that  seen  with 
mometasone furoate and ciclesonide active principle.  W694301X (M10) had no affinity at the AR, ERα 
or ERβ receptors and displayed no activity in the MR antagonist assay up to a concentration of 1 mcM. 
GW694301X  (M10)  displayed  low  but  measurable  affinity  for  the  PR  receptor.  However,  this  was  at 
least  100-fold  less  than  GW685698  and  was  therefore  considered  unlikely  to  contribute  to  any 
significant activity at this receptor. 
In vivo Studies – Anti-inflammatory activity 
The  effect  of  GW685698  in  the  delayed  type  hypersensitivity  model  of  ear  inflammation  was 
investigated in female BALB/c mice and male Lewis rats (Report SH2002/00044/00).  GW685698 dose-
dependently  inhibited  ear  swelling  induced  by  oxazolone  sensitisation  in  mice  and  rats.  When 
compared  to  fluticasone  propionate,  GW685698  exhibited  comparable  or  superior  anti-inflammatory 
activity in these models.  
The  effect  of  GW685698  was  further  evaluated  in  a  Brown  Norway  lung  eosinophilia  model  which 
measures an allergic inflammation of the lung by systemic and inhaled administration of allergen (1 mg 
ovalbumin)  characterised  by  a  profound  eosinophilia.  GW685698  was  associated  with  a  dose-
dependent  inhibition  of  lung  eosinophilia  in  this  model  (n=4  rats/group).  Significant  inhibition  of 
eosinophilia  was  achieved  after  a  single  dose  of  30  mcg  and  the  response  was  significantly  greater 
(p=0.016)  than  that  seen  with  an  equivalent  dose  of  fluticasone  propionate  (75%  inhibition  with 
GW685698 vs 50% inhibition with fluticasone propionate). A long anti-inflammatory duration of action 
in this model, with intratracheal administration of 100 mcg of GW685698 producing close to a maximal 
anti-inflammatory effect when given 14 hours prior to ovalbumin challenge was also observed. 
Finally,  the  inhibitory  effects  of  GW685698  on  antigen-induced  nasal  symptoms  (sneezing  and  nasal 
rubbing) was compared to that of fluticasone propionate following intranasal administration to actively 
sensitised  male  Wistar  rats.  GW685698  showed  a  significant  and  dose-related  inhibitory  effect  on 
antigen  induced  nasal  symptoms  (sneezing  and  nasal  rubbing)  of  comparable  potency  to  fluticasone 
propionate but with a longer duration.

Vilanterol (GW64244) 
In vitro studies  
Radioligand binding studies: 
Radioligand  binding  studies  were  performed  to  investigate  the  binding  kinetics  of  3H-GW642444  (as 
the  triphenylacetate  salt,  GW642444M)  in  membranes  prepared  from  either  transfected  Chinese 
hamster  ovary  (CHO)  cells  expressing  the  human  beta2-receptor  or  from  human  lung  parenchyma. 
GW642444 binds to the human beta2-receptor with high affinity coupled with fast K (pKD range 9.44 
to  10.8)  similar  to  that  of  salmeterol  and  higher  than  R,R-formoterol  and  indacaterol.  Competition 
binding  curves  for  a  range  of  beta2-receptor  agonist  and  antagonists  were  completed  against  3H-
GW642444.  The  pKi  values  determined  were  in  good  agreement  with  literature  values  generated 
against antagonist radioligands.  3H-GW642444M demonstrates a fast koff from the low affinity receptor 
state and a moderately slow koff from the high affinity receptor state at ambient temperature. 
In vitro efficacy: 
GW642444  (as  the  acetate  salt,  GW642444A)  was  assessed  in  a  variety  of  in  vitro  functional  assays 
and  its  potency  compared  with  that  of  salmeterol  and  R,R-formoterol  (beta2-receptor  agonists)  or 
isoprenaline (non-selective beta-agonist). 
GW642444  caused  a  concentration-dependant  pigment  dispersal  in  melatonin  pre-treated  frog 
melanophores  expressing  the  beta2-receptor.    GW642444  was  found  to  be  a  potent  agonist  at  the 
human  beta2-receptor  with  a  slightly  greater  potency  than  salmeterol  and  similar  potency  to  R,R-
formoterol  and  isoprenaline  (log  half-maximal  effective  concentration  (pEC50)  9.3,  8.8,  9.4  and  9.1, 
respectively). 
In  functional  adenyl  cyclase  assays  utilising  CHO  cells  stably  expressing  human  beta2-receptors, 
GW642444  had  a  similar  potency  to  salmeterol.  In  the  CHO  cells  stably  expressing  the  human  beta2 
adrenoceptors  (at  levels  which  allow  for  partial  agonists  to  be  discriminated),  GW642444  has  an 
intrinsic activity greater than salmeterol but lower than R,R-formoterol. The effects of GW642444 were 
also  antagonised  by  propranolol  and  sotalol  in  a  competitive  manner,  with  the  dissociation  constant 
pKbs obtained being similar to those against salmeterol (estimated pKb values for propranolol [9.6 and 
9.7]  and  sotalol  [7.3  and  7.3]  against  salmeterol  and  GW642444,  respectively).  These  data  indicate 
that GW642444 and salmeterol act as orthosteric agonists at the human beta2-receptor. 
In vitro selectivity: 
GW642444 (as the acetate salt, GW642444A and the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was assessed 
in  vitro  in  a  Luciferase  reporter  gene  selectivity  assay  or  a  TR-FRET  LANCE  cAMP  assay  in  CHO  cells 
stably expressing human  beta1-, beta2- and human beta3-receptors. Its potency compared with that 
of  salmeterol,  R,R-formoterol  and  indacaterol  (beta2-receptor  agonists)  or  isoprenaline  (non-selective 
beta-agonist).  GW642444  demonstrated  similar  selectivity  to  salmeterol  for  beta2  over  human  beta1 
and  human  beta3-receptors.  GW642444  was  significantly  more  selective  than  R,R-formoterol  and 
indacaterol against human beta1 and human beta3-receptors.

In vitro onset and duration of action: 
In  assessing  the  potency  and  duration  of  action  of  GW642444,  GW642444  caused  a  concentration 
dependent increase in the TR-FRET LANCE cAMP assay carried out in CHO cells expressing recombinant 
beta2-receptors.  GW642444, salmeterol and indacaterol showed long persistence of action (duration) 
at  the  beta2-receptor  following  washout  in  contrast  to  R,R-formoterol  which  shows  a  significant 
washout profile, indicating a lack of duration in this assay. 
Potency and duration of action of GW642444 was also assessed using guinea  pig trachea and human 
bronchus. GW642444 was shown to be a potent and selective beta2-receptor agonist on the guinea pig 
isolated superfused (electrically stimulated) trachea (pEC50 = 7.87). GW642444 was similar in potency 
(pEC50  =  7.68)  and  duration  to  salmeterol  and  around  30-fold  weaker  than  R,R-formoterol. 
GW642444  has  a  more  rapid  onset  than  salmeterol  and  similar  to  R,R-formoterol  (half  onset  time 
[Ot50] values of 6.6 minutes, 25 minutes and 13 minutes, respectively). The effects of GW642444 on 
guinea pig trachea were antagonised by propranolol and sotalol in a competitive manner. Reassertion 
studies with sotalol were consistent with CHO cell assays and support a long duration of action. Studies 
with  GW642444  on  human  isolated  bronchus  tissues  stimulated  with  either  prostaglandin  F2alpha  or 
methacholine showed a similar potency and duration profile to that seen in guinea pig trachea.   
Characterisation of GW642444 metabolites and S-enantiomer: 
The beta1- and beta2-agonist activity of GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M), its S-
enantiomer (GSK907117), 4 human metabolites (GW630200 [M29], GSK932009 [M33], GSK1676112 
[M20] and GW875428 [M40]) and a further potential metabolite GW853734, was evaluated in TR-FRET 
LANCE assay measuring cAMP production in recombinant CHO cells expressing human beta1- or beta2-
receptors.  The  GW642444  metabolites  GW630200  (M29)  and  GSK932009  (M33)  were  at  least  2500-
fold less potent than GW642444 on the beta2-receptor, and the metabolites GW875428, GSK1676112 
and GW853734 were poorly active with intrinsic activity ~30%, 70% and 50%, respectively, at beta2. 
The  GW642444  S-enantiomer  was  around  60  times  less  potent  at  beta2  than  GW642444. 
Pharmacological activity against the beta2-receptor was negligible for the other GW642444 metabolites 
tested.  None  of  the  metabolites  tested  or  the  S  enantiomer  showed  any  notable  pharmacological 
activity against the beta1-receptor. 
In vivo activity 
The  bronchoprotective  effects  of  GW642444  over  time  were  assessed  using  histamine  challenge  in 
conscious  male  and  female  guinea  pigs  (up  to  8/sex).  Airway  responsiveness  was  measured  using 
whole body plethysmography. GW642444 was a potent and long-acting inhibitor of histamine induced 
bronchospasm in the conscious guinea pig when administered by the inhaled route (nebulised aerosol). 
GW642444  had  a  similar  potency  to  salmeterol  and  at  an  equi-effective  (EC90)  dose  the  duration  of 
action of GW642444 was similar to salmeterol.

Repeat  dosing  studies  (once  daily/4  days  at  EC90)  induced  tachyphylaxis,  manifest  by  a  parallel 
rightward  shift  in  the  dose-response  curve  which  amounted  to  an  approximate  4-fold  reduction  in 
potency  pretreated  with  GW642444.  This  tachyphylaxis  was  considered  surmountable  and  was 
evidenced near the top of the dose-response curve. Repeated exposure to GW642444 daily for 5 days 
at  the  EC90  also  caused  a  statistically  significant  decrease  in the  duration of action  from  10  hours  to 
<4 hours. 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
The Applicant has submitted one study which compare the anti-inflammatory effects of GW685698 and 
GW642444  administered  in  combination  with  those  of  other  marketed  ICS/LABA  combinations,  as 
fluticasone  propionate  (FP)/salmeterol,  mometasone  furoate  (MF)/formoterol  in  peripheral  blood 
monocytes  (PBMC)  isolated  from  15  COPD  patients.  Furthermore,  the  effect  of  GW685698  on  the 
inhibition of GM-CSF production, glucocorticoid-dependent MKP-1 gene expression, GR binding and GR 
nuclear  translocation  was  compared  to  those  of  FP,  budesonide  and  MF  in  A549  cells.  The  results 
showed that FP did not inhibit TNFα-induced interleukin (IL)-8 released, while GW685698 and MF both 
displayed a moderate inhibitory effect. GW685698 showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of IL-8 
production,  but  the  maximum  efficiency  was  limited  (<10%).  10-8 M  of  GW642444  administered  with 
GW685698  resulted  in  an  increased  inhibition  of  30%.  MF  also  showed  concentration  dependent 
inhibition  and  10-8  M  formoterol  enhanced  MF  effects,  meanwhile  10-7M  of  salmeterol  enhanced  FP 
effects.  The  level  of  inhibition  seen  with  the  combination  mometasone  furoate/formoterol  was  similar 
to that seen with the combination of GW685698 and GW642444. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
The  secondary  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  GW685698  were  investigated  in  male  CD  rats 
intratracheally dosed with vehicle, GW685698 (10 and 100 mcg) or fluticasone propionate (10 and 100 
mcg) once daily for 3 days, since thymus involution is a documented index of systemic side effects of 
glucocorticoids. Thymus showed a weight reduction of 21.6 and 20.4% with GW685698 and fluticasone 
propionate  at  10  mcg,  respectively.  At  100  mcg,  the  reduction  was  of  67%  with  GW685698  and  of 
78% with fluticasone propionate, respectively. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
In vitro studies 
The  selectivity  of  GW642444A  (1  mcM)  for  7-transmembrane  (7TM)  receptors,  ion  channels  and

In vivo studies 
An in vivo secondary pharmacology study has been performed to assess the affect of inhaled doses of

were  observed.  Four  treatment  related  macroscopic  findings 
were  observed  in  the  liver.  Pallor  and  enlargement  were 
observed in all treated animals. Linear red capsular streaks and 
subcapsular  haemorrhages  were  observed 
in  high  dose 
animals. The temporal and masseter muscles were observed to 
be  wasted  in  all  treated  animals  and  this  is  considered  to  be 
related  to  treatment.  Treatment  related  microscopic  findings 
were  observed  in  the  adrenals,  skin  (injection  and  standard

Rat 
Conscious  male  Sprague  Dawley  rats  were  intravenously  administered  with  single  dose  of  vehicle  or 
GW642444H. Animals were observed for peripheral and central nervous systems activities (e.g., motor 
activity,  behaviour,  co-ordination,  somatic  sensory/motor  reflex  responses  and  automatic  responses 
such  as  piloerection,  pupil  size,  lachrymation,  salivation,  overt  cardiovascular  and  gastrointestinal 
effects) and potential effects on body temperature.  
In  other  study  also  performed  in  conscious  male  Sprague  Dawley  CD  rats,  GW642444M  was 
administered  as  a  single  dose  via  snout-only  inhalation.  Animals  were  subjected  to  neurobehavioural 
observations  using  a  standard  observation  battery,  quantitative  motor  activity  evaluations  and  the 
recording  of  body  temperature.  Body  temperature  and  neurobehavioural  endpoints  were  monitored 
before  dosing  (to obtain  baseline  measurements),  and  subsequently  at  1.25, 3  and  9  hours  from  the 
start  of  exposure  while  motor  activity  was  evaluated  before  the  dosing  and  at  1.25,  9  and  25  hours 
from the start of the exposure.

tail  current 
inhibited  hERG 
GW642444 
in  a 
concentration-dependent  manner.  At  30.7  mcM 
GW642444 inhibited hERG tail current completely. 
The IC25, IC50 and IC75 values for GW642444 inhibition 
of  hERG  tail  current  were  2.0,  4.8  and  12.6  mcM 
(0.99, 2.3 and 6.1 mcg/mL), respectively. 
At stimulation frequencies of 0.5 and 1 Hz, exposure 
to GW642444 at concentrations of 1 and 10 mcM 
caused a concentration-dependant depolarization of 
RMP and decreases in UA, MRD and APD. At 100 mcM 
GW642444 action potentials could not be elicited in 3 
of the 4 test substance treated fibres. In the 
remaining fibre RMP, UA and APD were further 
reduced compared to the effects observed at 10 mcM 
GW642444 (the effect on MRD was similar to the 
effects observed at 10 mcM) at 1 Hz. This fibre 
became spontaneous at 0.5 Hz. Due to these effects 
meaningful statistical analysis could not be performed 
at 0.5 and 3 Hz. 
These results are consistent with inhibition of cardiac 
potassium (IK1) and sodium channels although an 
additional inhibition of cardiac calcium channels 
cannot be ruled out. 
At  1  mcg/kg,  moderate  increase  in  heart  rate  of 
approximately  60  bpm  (lasting  approximately  20-25 
minutes along with small decreases in blood pressure, 
PR-  and  QT-  intervals  detected  5-minutes  post  dose. 
At  0.3  mcg/kg,  smaller  increase  in  heart  rate  (26 
levels 
bpm),  which 
approximately10 minutes after dosing. There were no 
other  cardiovascular  or  ECG  changes 
following 
treatment with GW642444H. 
At  1  mcg/kg,  small  decrease  in  blood  pressure  of 
approximately  10  mmHg  lasting  approximately  15 
minutes  and  an 
rate  of 
increase 
approximately 67 bpm which lasted for approximately 
55  minutes.  At  0.3  mcg/kg,  smaller  increase  in  heart 
rate of approximately 37 bpm. At both doses, 0.3 and 
1 mcg/kg, reductions in PR, RR, QT and QTcL interval, 
attributed to the changes in heart rate. At 0.1 mcg/kg, 
very small prolongation of QT and QTcL interval. QTcL 
increased  by  approximately  6  msecs  and  returned  to 
predose  levels  at  approximatley  40  minutes  following

in ECG rhythm or waveform morphology at any dose 
In vitro studies 
Effects on QT interval. hERG assay 
The  potential  capacity  of  GW642444H  to  inhibit  hERG  tail  current  was  evaluated  by  whole  cell  patch 
clamp method in HEK-293 cells stably transfected with hERG cDNA. Peak hERG tail current amplitude 
was measured prior to and following exposure to GW642444H, DMSO, (vehicle) or E-4031 (0.1 mcM; 
an inhibitor of hERG tail current) using 4 to 5 cells/concentration.  
Effect on QT interval. Purkinje fibre assay 
In other in vitro study using beagle dog isolated Purkinje fibres, the effects of GW642444H on cardiac 
action  potential,  including action  potential duration  at  60  and 90%  repolarization  (ADP60  and  ADP90), 
resting  membrane  potential  (RMP),  maximum  rate  of  depolarisation  (MRD)  and  upstroke  amplitude 
(UA) was examined. All mentioned parameters were measured at 1 and 0.5 Hz, except MRD that was 
measured at 3 Hz in the presence of vehicle or GW642444 at 100 mcM.  
In vivo studies 
Dog  
GW642444H was administered intravenously to conscious male beagle dogs to evaluate its effects on 
arterial  pressures,  heart  rate,  and  electrocardiograph  parameters.  Cardiovascular  function  and  ECG 
parameters  were  monitored  via  telemetry  from  30  minutes  prior  to  dosing,  during  the  1  minute 
infusion period and for 4 hours after dosing.  
In  conscious  male  beagle  dog  was  also  evaluated  the  effects  of  GW642444M  in  the  cardiovascular 
function and ECG parameters. Systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure, pulse pressure, heart rate 
and  ECG  parameters  were  monitored  via  telemetry  from  30  minutes  before  dosing,  during  the  1 
minute infusion period and for 4 hours after dosing. ECG waveforms were observed for any abnormal 
changes in rhythm or morphology.

Noteworthy findings 
At  666  ug/kg:  slight  increases  in  respiratory  rate 
during  20  to  60  minutes  of  exposure  but  this 
increases was not evident at 24 and 48 hours after 
exposure and since it was mild and had no effect on 
minute  volume  (total  pulmonary  ventilation)  it  is 
not considered to be an adverse effect. 
Statistically  significant  changes  in  respiratory  rate 
at 15 minutes and 1 hour during exposure for 36.02 
and  718.13  μg/kg  groups  and  at  24  hours  for  the 
36.02  and  36327.03  μg/kg  groups.  Since  these 
baseline-adjusted  differences  were  minor,  isolated 
events, and were not dose-dependent, they are not 
considered to be drug-related. 
The  effects  of  GW642444H  on  the  respiratory  system  were  evaluated  in  conscious  male  Sprague-
Dawley CD rats. T tidal volume, respiratory rate and minute volume were the respiratory parameters 
monitored before the dosing and at approximately 24 and 48 hours after exposure to the product.  
In other study in conscious male Sprague-Dawley CD rats was also evaluate the effects of GW642444M 
on the respiratory. The tidal volume, respiratory rate and minute volume were respiratory parameters 
evaluated and measured prior to dosing, continuously during the 1 hour and for approximately 1 hour 
at approximately 24 hours post-exposure.  
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
No  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  performed  on  the  fixed  dose  combination  fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol based on the data available for each compound which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
Nonclinical pharmacology studies conducted in vitro and in vivo have clearly shown that GW685698 is 
an  extremely  potent  and  effective  glucocorticoid  receptor  agonist  with  a  sustained  and  selective 
mechanism of action and that GW642444 is a selective long-acting and potent beta2 receptor agonist. 
In vitro studies evaluating the selectivity of GW685698 or GW642444 using a panel of receptors and/or 
channels  suggested  that  neither  compound  is  likely  to  produce  biological  effects  unrelated  to  their 
primary activity. 
Based  on  the  high  selectivity  of  the  two  compounds  to  their  native  receptors,  and  the  low  plasma 
concentrations within the efficacious dose range (as a consequence of the low inhaled dose, poor oral 
bioavailability  and  subsequent  moderate  or  high  rates  of  clearance  from  the  bloodstream),  the 
potential for pharmacodynamic drug interactions is considered small. 
No  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  were  submitted  for  the  combination  fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol based on the data available for each compound which is considered acceptable.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
The  HPLC-MS/MS  assay  for  the  quantification  of  fluticasone  furoate  has  been  validated  adequately  in 
mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and human plasma. Acceptable linearity, precision, accuracy and specificity of 
fluticasone furoate were observed over the concentration range 10 (rabbit and dog), 20 (mouse, rat) 
to 200 pg/mL and in human plasma 10 to 1000 or 2000 pg/mL. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
The LC-MS/MS assay for the quantification of vilanterol has been validated adequately in mouse, rat, 
rabbit  and  dog  plasma.  Acceptable  linearity,  precision,  accuracy  and  specificity  of  vilanterol  were 
observed over the concentration range 0.1 to 50 or 100 ng/mL. 
Absorption 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Absorption of GW685698 from the lung following inhalation administration was moderately rapid in all 
non-clinical  species  (mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog),  Tmax  being  generally  up  to  1.5  hours  after  the  end  of 
the  inhalation  period  or  sooner.  GW685698  was  well  absorbed  in  the  rat  and  dog  following  oral 
administration  with  oral  absorption  estimated  as  at  least  30  and  19%  respectively,  based  on  the 
recovery of drug related material (DRM) in bile and urine in bile-duct cannulated (BDC) animals. In the 
rat,  rabbit  and  dog,  however,  oral  systemic  exposure  to  GW685698  was  limited  by  its  negligible  oral 
bioavailability  -  approximately  1%  or  lower  when  dosed  as  a  suspension.  The  low  oral  absolute 
bioavailability  of  GW685698  is  most  likely  due  to  extensive  first  pass  metabolism.  Oral  absorption  of 
GW685698  in  human,  as  in  animals,  was  good  with  at  least  30%  of  the  administered  dose  absorbed 
following  oral  administration  of  14C-GW685698  in  solution  based  on  a  comparison  of  radioactivity 
AUC0-t  values 
following  oral  and 
intravenous  administrations.  Corresponding  human  oral 
bioavailability, as in animals, was low (approximately 1%), mediated, as in animals, by extensive first 
pass metabolism of orally absorbed drug. 
In single i.v. dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, PK profiles were comparable in both genders among 
all species examined (rat, rabbit, dog and human). High clearance and large volume of distribution was 
achieved indicating extensive distribution to all tissues. 
Following a single subcutaneous administration in rat and dog, GW685698 had a long apparent plasma 
half-life  (approximately  25  and  160  hours  in  rat  and  dog,  respectively)  suggesting  absorption  rate 
limited  elimination.  This  is  consistent  with  formation  of  a  depot  which  provided  sustained  release  of 
GW685698  into  the  systemic  circulation  over  a  long  period  of  time.  Animals  dosed  by  subcutaneous 
administration  may  have  prolonged  exposure  compared  to  animals  or  humans  dosed  by  inhalation 
administration  and  are  thought  to  explain  the  delayed  effects  observed  in  the  safety  pharmacology 
study. 
In repeat dose inhalation studies in mouse, rat, rabbit and dog for up to 39 weeks, 58 weeks, 2 weeks 
and  39  weeks,  respectively,  Inter-animal  and  inter-study  variability  of  systemic  exposure  to 
GW685698  was  high  as  is  typical  following  inhalation  administration.  The  mean  data,  however, 
consistently showed the same trends between studies.

Systemic  exposure  to  GW685698  following  inhalation  administration  to  mice,  rats,  rabbits,  dogs  and 
human increased with increasing dose, in either a proportional or less than dose-proportional manner. 
Overall, there was little evidence of accumulation of GW685698 in animals on repeated administration 
with  less  than  2-fold  change  in  systemic  exposure  reported  following  repeated  administration  on  the 
majority  of  studies.  Small  increases  were  occasionally  reported  in  the  rat  and  dog.  Accumulation  of 
GW685698 following repeated inhalation administration to human was also less than 2-fold. Systemic 
exposure was typically similar in males and females in the mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and human. Tmax 
usually occurred immediately following the end of the dosing period (nominally 1 hour in duration) in 
all species. The addition of magnesium stearate as an excipient in rat and dog vehicle formulations did 
not influence the toxicokinetics of GW685698.  
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Absorption  of  GW642444  from  the  lung  following  inhalation  administration  was  rapid  in  all  nonclinical 
species  with  Tmax  generally  at  the  first  sample  taken  after  the  end  of  the  inhalation  period.  Oral 
absorption  of  14C-GW642444  was  good  in  both  rat  and  dog  with  at  least  37%  and  56%  orally 
absorbed  in  BDC  rats  and  intact  dogs,  respectively.  Oral  bioavailability  of  GW642444,  however,  was 
low in the rat (1.1%) and moderate in the dog (29.7%). Hepatic portal vein plasma concentrations of 
GW642444 in mice and rats suggest that first-pass hepatic clearance limits oral bioavailability in these 
species.  Oral  bioavailability  in  the  rat  is,  therefore,  limited  mainly  by  first  pass  hepatic  clearance  as 
well  as  incomplete  absorption.  The  higher  oral  bioavailability  (and  lower  blood  clearance,  see  table 
below)  in  the  dog  suggests  that  a  greater  proportion  of  the  swallowed  component  escapes  first  pass 
hepatic clearance and, as a result, the oral component in the dog is likely to make a larger contribution 
to systemic exposure following inhalation administration. 
Oral  absorption  of  GW642444  in  human,  as  in  animals,  was  good  with  at  least  50%  orally  absorbed 
based  on  urinary  recovery  of  DRM  following  administration  of  14C-GW642444  in  solution  (Study 
B2C106181). Exposure to GW642444 represented a very small percentage (in the region of <0.5%) of 
DRM in plasma indicating that the low human oral bioavailability (< 2%), was mediated by extensive 
first pass metabolism. 
Differences  in  blood  clearance  of  GW642444  was  observed  in  rat,  dog  and  human  and  ranged  from 
moderate in the rat (35% of rat liver blood flow of 90 mL/min/kg), lower in the dog (26% of dog liver 
blood flow of 40 mL/min/kg ) and high in human (> human liver blood flow). The steady state volume 
of distribution of GW642444 was high in the rat and human but moderate in the dog, exceeding total 
body water in all species.

In  repeat  dose  inhalation  studies  using  dry  powder  formulations,  systemic  exposure  to  GW642444 
(AUC0-t  and  Cmax)  increased  with  increasing  dose  in  a  proportional  or  less  than  dose-proportional 
manner;  subproportionality  was  generally  associated  with  higher  doses.  There  was  little  evidence  of 
accumulation  of  GW642444  exposure  with  time,  although  increased  AUC0-t  values  were  occasionally 
observed  upon  repeat  dosing  in  some  of  the  rat  studies.  Overall,  there  were  no  marked  changes  in 
systemic  exposure  between  males  and  females  in  the  mouse,  rat  or  dog.  There  were  no  marked 
changes in systemic exposure with time or gender, following repeated administration of GW642444 in 
human.  Tmax  was  generally  at  the  first  sample  time  after  the  end  of  the  inhalation  period  indicating 
rapid  absorption  across  the  lung.  A  comparison  of  the  systemic  exposure  to  GW642444  achieved  in 
pivotal toxicity studies and in humans following its administration at the proposed commercial dose is 
seen in the table below. Exposure to GW642444 in animal toxicity studies was considerably greater (in 
most cases) than following proposed dose of GW642444 to human. 
Inclusion  of  magnesium  stearate  as  an  excipient  in  rat  and  dog  vehicle  formulations  for  inhalation 
studies did not result in notable changes to systemic exposure. 
Systemic exposure (AUC0-t and Cmax) to GI179710 (the triphenylacetate counter-ion of GW642444M 
triphenylacetate  salt)  following  inhalation  administration of  GW642444M increased  proportionally  with 
dose in rats and dogs but less than proportionally in the mouse. In the rat, there was some evidence 
for  accumulation  on  repeat  dosing  but  not  in  the  mouse  or  dog.  Overall,  in  the  majority  of  studies, 
there were no differences in systemic exposure between genders. 
In repeat dose clinical studies where asthma and  COPD patients were administered at doses of up to 
50 mcg GW642444M, concentrations of GI179710 were below the limits of quantification (1 ng/mL) in 
the  majority of  subjects. Cmax  concentrations  of  GI179710  on  repeat  dose  inhalation  toxicity  studies 
(mean of males/females over whole study at the highest dose level administered) were > 1000 ng/mL 
in the mouse and rat and > 200 ng/mL in the dog and pregnant rabbit. Large systemic exposure ratios 
for GI179710, relative to human, have, therefore been established in toxicology studies. 
Systemic  exposure  (AUC0-t  and  Cmax)  to  Human  metabolites  GW630200  (M29)  and  GSK932009 
(M33) generally increased with increasing dose in either a proportional or less than dose-proportional 
manner. Mouse, rat and dog were all exposed to both metabolites with metabolite:parent ratios (based 
on  AUC0-t)  of  0.002  to  0.01  for  GW630200  (M29)  and  0.02  to  0.08  for  GSK932009  (M33).  No 
consistent difference in exposure to metabolites was observed between males and females.  
In repeat dose clinical studies where asthma and COPD patients were administered doses of up to 50 
mcg GW642444M by the inhalation route, concentrations of GW630200 (M29) and GSK932009 (M33) 
were below the limits of quantification (0.09 and 0.18 ng/mL, respectively) in the majority (99.8%) of 
subjects.  Cmax  concentrations  of  GW630200  (M29)  and  GSK932009  (M33)  observed  in  nonclinical 
repeat dose inhalation toxicity studies (at the highest dose level administered as recommended in ICH 
M3(R2)  were  >  0.7  ng/mL  for  GW630200  (M29)  and  >  3  ng/mL  for  GSK932009  (M33)  in  the  rat, 
mouse  and  dog.  Mice,  rat  and  dogs  have,  therefore,  been  exposed  to  higher  concentrations  of  these 
metabolites compared to human.

Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
In a repeat dose studies exposure to GW685698 or GW642444 (AUC0-t and Cmax) was not markedly 
increased  when  dosed  in combination  compared to when  dosed  alone  by  the inhalation  route  to  rats, 
rabbits  and  dogs.  There  were,  however,  occasional  incidences,  especially  in  the  shorter  duration 
studies (< 4 weeks), where systemic exposure (to GW685698, GW642444, or both components) were 
lower  on  co-administration.  However,  there  was  no  notable  difference  in  systemic  exposure  to 
GW685698 or GW642444 when they  were dosed in combination in human studies compared to when 
they were dosed alone. As per single agent alone, magnesium stearate as an excipient did not result in 
notable changes to systemic exposure to either GW685698 or GW642444 when dosed in combination 
to the dog. 
Distribution 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Protein Binding: 
The  plasma  protein  binding  characteristics  of  3H-GW685698  were  determined  using  an  ultrafiltration 
method. The mean binding of 3H-GW685698 was found to be high (>99.5 in dog, rabbit, mouse and 
human; >97% in rat) and showed no concentration-dependence across the range of 0.2 to 5 ng/mL. 
Plasma  protein  binding  at  the  lowest  concentration  investigated  (0.2  ng/mL)  was  96.4,  99.6,  99.6, 
>99.5 and >99.6% in rat, dog, rabbit, mouse and human, respectively. 
In  a  second  study,  plasma  protein  binding  characteristics  of  3H-GW685698  was  determined  using 
ultracentrifugation.  In  all  species  tested,  the  binding  of  3H-GW685698  to  plasma  proteins  was 
moderate  (75  to  93%)  and  similar  across  the  3H-GW685698  concentration  range  used  (0.2  to  5 
ng/mL).  No  apparent  sex-related  differences  were  observed  in  the  plasma  protein  binding  of  3H-
GW685698 in humans. 
In  a  study  examining  the  binding  properties  of  14C-GW685698  (20  to  250  ng)  in  selected  human 
plasma  proteins,  fresh  human  plasma  and  protein  solutions,  binding  was  comparable  to  that  seen  in 
the ultrafiltration method.  The extent of binding in albumin solution and α1-acid glycoprotein solution 
was high being 96% and 90%, respectively. The extent of binding to γ-globulin was low at 33%. There 
was  no  evidence  of  any  concentration-dependent binding  of  14C-GW685698 across  the  concentration 
range employed.  
Whole blood distribution: 
Blood samples collected from male mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and humans were utilised in a study of the 
distribution of 3H-GW685698 in whole blood. The blood to plasma concentration ratios were similar for 
each  species  and  no  concentration-dependent  blood  cell  association  was  observed  across  the 
concentration  range  of  0.2  to  5  ng/mL.  In  all  species  investigated,  3H-GW685698  had  a  higher 
association for plasma than for blood cells. Percentage associated with cellular fraction ranged from 6 
to  23%.  As  the  concentration  in  blood  is  lower  than  the  corresponding  plasma  concentration,  the 
clearance  in  vivo  from  the  blood  will  be  higher  than  that  from  plasma.  No  apparent  sex  related 
differences were observed in the blood distribution of 3H-GW685698 in humans.

Whole  blood  distribution  of  radioactive  14C-GW685698  was  also  examined  in  dogs.  14C-GW685698 
was administered intravenously (infusion over 30 minutes) to male beagle dogs (n=3) at a dose of 100 
mcg/kg,  as  a  0.1  mg/mL  solution  in  PEG  400:  8%  w/v  2-hydroxypropyl  β-cyclodextrin  solution 
(aqueous) (1:3). Radioactivity was assessed in the excreta and also in plasma and whole blood taken 
from each dog at various time points up to 96 hours after dosing. Whole blood concentrations of total 
radioactivity  were  lower  than  those  observed  in  the  corresponding  plasma  samples  at  all  time  points 
investigated.  Mean  whole  blood:plasma  radioactivity  concentration  ratios  ranged  from  0.64  to  0.74. 
These  data  indicated  that  circulating  radioactivity  was  predominantly  associated  with  the  plasma 
fraction. 
Membrane transporter inhibition studies: 
GW685698  and  GW694301X  (M10)  inhibited  human  OATP1B1  in  a  stably  transfected  CHO-OATP1B 
with cell line with calculated IC50 values of 0.2 and 2.6 mcM (0.11 and 1.4 mcg/mL), respectively. In 
contrast,  GW685698  and  GW694301X  (M10)  did  not  inhibit  transport  of  digoxin  by  human  P-gp  by 
polarized  Madin-Darby  canine  kidney  MDCKII-MDR1  cells  transfected  with  the  human  MDR1  gene 
(produces  the  P-gp  protein)  at  concentrations  up  to  30  and  100  mcM  (16  and  54  mcg/mL), 
respectively.  Finally  in  an  effort  to  determine  if  GW685698  was  a  substrate  for  human  P-gp,  the 
potential  for  P-gp  to  transport  GW685698  was  investigated  using  stable  transfected  MDCKII-MDR1 
cells  cultured  as  monolayers  plus  or  minus  an  inhibitor  of  human  P-gp  (GF120918).  The  apparent 
passive permeability of GW685698 was moderate [P7.4 of 80 ± 45 nm/s (mean ± SD)], indicating that 
it should diffuse across most membranes. The basal to apical efflux ratio for GW685698 in the absence 
of  GF120918  was  3  and  this  was  reduced  to  0.5  in  the  presence  of  the  inhibitor,  indicating  that  the 
compound was a substrate of P-gp. 
In vivo distribution studies: 
The  tissue  distribution  of  3H-GW685698  has  been  assessed  in  the  albino  and  pigmented  rat  using 
quantitative whole body autoradiography (QWBA) following iv and oral administration.

In  the  first  of  three  tissue  distribution  studies  performed  using  the  intravenous  route  of  drug 
administration,  pigmented  (Random  Hooded)  and  albino  (Wistar  Han)  male  rats  (n=5  and  15, 
respectively) received 3H-GW685698 as a single bolus dose of 133 mcg/kg.  The vehicle used in this 
study  comprised  10%  Cremaphor  in  saline.  Rats  were  killed  (n=1  and  3  for  pigmented  and  albino, 
respectively)  at  0.5,  1,  4,  24  and  168  hours  after  dose  administration,  and  QWBA  performed.  In 
general,  radioactive  drug-related  material  (DRM)  was  widely  distributed  throughout  the  tissues  and 
most tissue radioactivity levels were higher than those found in the blood at 0.5 to 24 hours post dose. 
At 168 hours, tissue levels of radioactivity were only detectable (lower limit of quantification of 13 ng 
equi/g tissue), by QWBA, in the liver (40 ng equi/g of tissue) and kidney cortex (21 ng equi/g tissue in 
the region of proximal tubules). The highest levels of DRM were seen 0.5 hours after administration in 
the small intestine and small intestine wall, indicating extensive biliary clearance and secretion across 
the gastrointestinal tract wall. Levels in the lower large intestine rose later as might be expected from 
passage of gastrointestinal contents. Levels of DRM in the stomach and stomach wall were also high at 
the early time points. This may indicate transfer of a weakly acidic metabolite into the stomach. Tissue 
half-lives of radioactivity in liver, blood and kidney (cortex) as determined over 24 to 168 hours after 
intravenous  administration  ranged  from  90  to  170  hours.  DRM  was  not  detectable  (lower  limit  of 
quantification  of  13  ng  equi/g  tissue)  in  the  uveal  tract  of  the  pigmented  rats,  indicating  no  notable 
binding  to  melanin  had occurred  for  the parent or metabolites.  The  tissue  distribution  of  radioactivity 
was similar in albino (WH) and pigmented (RH) rats. 
In the second intravenous whole body autoradiography study, 14C-GW685698 was administered as a 
bolus  over  approximately  30  seconds  to  6  male  pigmented  rats  (Lister  Hooded)  at  a  dose  of  1000 
mcg/kg.  The  vehicle  used  in  this  study  comprised  40%  polyethylene  glycol  400  and  10%  DMSO  in 
saline. Single rats were killed at 1 and 4 hours, and 1, 3, 10 and 35 days post dose, and whole body 
autoradiography  performed.  Non-uniform  levels  of  radioactivity  were  found  in  the  liver,  lung,  spleen 
and  bone  marrow,  particularly  at  1  and  4  hours  and  1  and  3  days  post  dose,  consistent  with 
microcrystalline deposits of either undissolved or precipitated test material building up in the capillaries 
of  the  vascular  system  within  the  aforementioned  tissues.  Consequently,  no  quantification  of  the 
autoradiograms was performed in this study. This pattern of radioactivity was attributed to the dosing 
method and vehicle employed since it was not observed in subsequent studies that utilised alternative 
vehicles and infusion dosing (up to 1 hour) and using similar doses. 
Qualitative assessment of the autoradiograms revealed that DRM was widely distributed in the tissues 
at the first sampling time (1 hour); that the highest concentrations of radioactivity were found at this 
time; and that radioactivity concentrations declined such that by the final sampling time at 35 days, no 
tissues contained visible levels of radioactivity. Compared with other tissues, the brain and spinal cord 
only contained low levels of radioactivity at 1 and 4 hours post dose. Low levels of radioactivity were 
noted  in  the  uveal  tract/retina  during  the  first  3  days  post  dose  but  radioactivity  was  no  longer 
detectable at 10 days, suggesting no notable binding to melanin.

To  overcome  the  precipitation  of  DRM  observed  in  the  previous  study,  the  study  was  repeated  with 
14C-GW685698 given as an infusion over a 30 minute period to 6 male pigmented rats (Lister Hooded) 
at a dose of 1000 mcg/kg. The vehicle used in this study comprised 10% Cremaphor in saline. Single 
rats  were  killed  at  1  and  4  hours,  and  1,  3,  10  and  35  days  post  dose,  and  QWBA  performed. 
Radioactivity was widely distributed at 1 hour after the start of the infusion (first time point). Highest 
levels  of  radioactivity  at  this  time  were  measured  in  the  following  organs,  presented  in  descending 
order  of  radioactivity:  mucosa  of  the  small  intestine,  liver,  Harderian  gland,  kidney  cortex,  preputial 
gland,  adrenal  cortex,  exorbital  lachrymal  gland,  brown  fat,  intra-orbital  lachrymal  gland,  mucoas  of 
the caecum, pancreas, white fat, aortic wall, epimysim and blood. The vast majority of tissues attained 
their highest observed concentrations at this time. Relatively low levels of radioactivity were associated 
with the brain, spinal cord and lens of the eye at 1 and 4 hours post dose. Thereafter, radioactivity was 
not  measurable  (lower  limit  of  quantification  of  3  to  5  ng  equi/g  tissue)  in  these  tissues.  By  10  days 
post dose, tissue concentrations of radioactivity had declined such that all values were either close to 
or below the limits of reliable quantification. At 35 days post dose, very low but quantifiable levels of 
radioactivity could be measured only in the spleen and blood. 
In  examining  distribution  after  oral  administration,  pigmented  (Random  Hooded)  and  albino  (Wistar 
Han) male rats (n=5 and 15, respectively) received a single oral administration of 3H-GW685698 at a 
nominal dose of 133 mcg/kg. 
Rats were killed (n=1 and 3 for pigmented and albino, respectively) at 1, 4, 8, 24 and 168 hours post 
dose, and QWBA performed. There was limited distribution of radioactive drug-related material (DRM) 
into the  tissues.  The  kidney,  liver,  spleen  and  gastrointestinal tract  were the only  tissues  with  higher 
levels  than  in  the  blood  at  1  to  24  hours  after  dosing.  This  limited  distribution  contrasts  with  the 
findings  after  intravenous  dosing  and  is  probably  due  to  relatively  low  absorption  and  rapid  biliary 
clearance of the material that is absorbed. At 168 hours, radioactivity was only detectable, by QWBA, 
in the liver (17 ng equi/g tissue) and in the kidney cortex (18 ng equi/g tissue in the region of proximal 
tubules),  as  observed  after  intravenous  dosing.  The  half-life  of  radioactivity  in  the  liver,  blood  and 
kidney  (cortex)  of  albino  rats,  measured  over  the  period  24  to  168  hours  post  dose,  ranged  from 
between  70  to  110  hours.  The  levels  of  DRM  in  the  blood  were  consistent  with  a  half-life  of  <110 
hours. No DRM was detectable (lower limit of quantification of 13 ng equi/g tissue) in the uveal tract of 
pigmented  rats,  indicating  that  no  notable  binding  to  melanin  had  occurred  for  the  parent  or 
metabolites. There was no apparent difference between DRM levels in albino and pigmented rats. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Plasma Binding:  
In  vitro  plasma  protein  binding  of  GW642444  (parent  form)  was  studied  in  rat,  guinea  pig,  dog  and 
human  plasma  using  equilibrium  dialysis.  Plasma  samples  were incubated  with  0.05  and  0.1  mcg/mL 
GW642444. The dialysates and remaining plasma samples were analysed for GW642444 by HPLC-MS. 
Binding of GW642444 to plasma proteins was moderately high in rats (84%), guinea pigs (92%), dog 
(98%) and human plasma (94%).

In a second study, plasma protein binding of GW642444 (as the α-phenylcinnamate salt, GW642444H) 
was investigated at concentrations of 0.005, 0.025, 0.125 or 0.625 mcg/mL in mouse, rat, guinea pig, 
female rabbit, dog and human plasma by equilibrium dialysis. The concentration of GW642444 in the 
dialysate and dialysed plasma, along with the original (non-dialysed) plasma sample, was determined 
by  HPLC-MS/MS.  The  extent  of  plasma  protein  binding  was  moderately  high  at  levels  >90%,  and 
appeared  to  be  consistent  across  the  concentration  range  within  all  species  investigated.  The  mean 
plasma protein binding of GW642444 was 94.3, 92.3, 98.9, 93.4, 98.7 and 97.2% in the mouse, rat, 
guinea pig, female rabbit, dog and human, respectively. 
Finally,  protein  binding  of  GW642444  (2  ng/mL  as  the  triphenylacetate  salt,  GW642444M)  was 
investigated  by  ultrafiltration  in  incubations  with  human  serum  albumin  (40  mg/mL),  α-acid 
glycoprotein (0.8 mg/mL) and γ-globlin (7 mg/mL) dissolved individually in phosphate buffered saline 
(Report 2011N118910_00).  GW642444 was moderately bound to human serum albumin (60.3%) and 
α-acid glycoprotein (60.8%), whereas the extent of binding to γ-globlin was low (7.9%). 
A study was also performed to examine the in vitro protein binding of 14C-GI179710 (the counter ion 
of  GW642444M  triphenylacetate  salt  -  0.05,  0.2  and  0.5  mcg/mL  )  in  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog  and 
human  plasma  using  equilibrium  dialysis.  The  mean  plasma  protein  binding  of  14C-GI179710  was 
95.0,  96.5,  >99,  97.1  and  97.7%  in  the  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog  and  human,  respectively.  Extent  of 
binding  was  high  and  appeared  to  be  consistent  across  the  concentration  range  investigated  within 
each species. 
Whole Blood Distribution 
In  an  in  vitro  blood  cell  distribution  study,  GW642444  (0.1  mcg/mL)  was  shown  to  have  a  low 
moderate association with the cellular fraction of rat and human blood (58 to 63% in rat; 35 to 36% in 
human).  The  blood:plasma  ratio  following  30  minutes  incubation  was  1.5:1  and  0.85:1  for  rat  and 
human, respectively. 
Similarly  in  a  definitive  study  conducted  during  drug  development,  the  blood  cell  association  of  14C-
GW642444  (parent  form) was  investigated  at  concentrations  of  0.05,  0.2  and  0.5  mcg/mL  in  mouse, 
rat, guinea pig, female rabbit, dog and human plasma. The extent of blood cell association was low to 
moderate and there was no evidence of any concentration-dependence on association. The mean blood 
to plasma ratios of 14C-GW642444 were 1.0, 1.1, 0.73, 1.0, 0.50 and 0.76 in the mouse, rat, guinea 
pig, female rabbit, dog and human, respectively. The corresponding mean blood cell association values 
were 41.3, 55.9, 15.6, 41.4, 10.7 and 36.1%, respectively. 
For  the  counter  ion of  GW642444M  triphenylacetate  salt  (0.05,  0.2  and 0.5 mcg/mL),  mean  blood  to 
plasma  ratios  were  0.70,  0.63,  0.66,  0.49  and  0.60  in  the  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog  and  human, 
respectively.  The  corresponding  mean  percentage  blood  cell  association  values  were  16.8,  14.5,  <1, 
7.4  and  4.4%,  respectively.  Blood  cell  association  of  14C-GI179710  was  low  and  there  was  no 
evidence for any concentration-dependence on association.

P-glycoprotein transport and membrane permeability: 
GW642444 was screened in Madin-Darby canine kidney II cell line transfected with human MDR1 gene 
(MDCKII-MDR1)  cells  to  assess  whether  it  was  a  substrate  for  human  P-gp.  The  bidirectional 
permeability of GW642444 (5 and 10 mcM), from basolateral to apical (B→A) and apical to basolateral 
(A→B),  was  measured  in  the  presence  and  absence  of  GF120918,  a  known  inhibitor  of  P-gp. 
GW642444  was  determined  to  be  a  substrate  of  human  P-gp  with  B→A/A→B  efflux  ratios  of  33.5  to 
53.7 and 1.4 to1.5 in the absence and presence of GF120918, respectively. 
In  a  second  definitive  study,  the  potential  for  human  P-gp  to  transport  GW642444  (as  the  α-
phenylcinnamate  salt,  GW642444H  -  0.5  mcM.)  was  investigated  using  stable  transfected  MDCKII-
MDR1  cells  in  the  absence  and  presence  of  a  potent  P-gp  inhibitor.  GW642444  was  a  substrate  of 
human  P-gp  (apical  efflux  ratio  of  GW642444  determined  as  ≥25.7  and  0.5  in  the  absence  and 
presence  of  GF120918A,  respectively).  The  passive  membrane  permeability  of  GW642444  (average 
P7.4)  was  of  34  ±  13  nm/s.  A  passive  permeability  of  34  nm/s  is  currently  classified  as  a  moderate 
permeability,  although  at  the  time  of  the  study,  it  was  classified  as  being  low  passive  permeability. 
Poor mass balance was observed for GW642444 and results from the assay should be interpreted with 
caution. 
P-glycoprotein inhibition: 
A study was performed to assess the ability of GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) 
to  inhibit  human  P-gp  mediated  transport  of  3H-digoxin  using  stable  transfected  MDCKII-MDR1  cell.  
GW642444  inhibited  the  transport  of  digoxin  via  human  P-gp  in  vitro  by  26%  at  the  highest 
concentration tested (100 mcM). There was no evidence of inhibition at 30 mcM or below. As a result 
IC50 values could not be calculated but would be >100 mcM based on the data from this study. 
In vivo distribution studies: 
P-glycoprotein transport: 
In  a  pharmacokinetic  study  designed  to  provide  information  on  the  role  of  P-gp  in  attenuating  CNS 
penetration  and  oral  absorption  of  GW642444,  a  single  oral  dose  of  GW642444  (as  the 
triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) at a target dose level of 1000 mcg/kg was administered to 21 male 
mdr1a/1b (knockout, KO) and 21 male FVBn (wildtype, WT) mice.   
GW642444 exposures (based upon AUC0-t values) in hepatic portal vein (HPV) plasma were generally 
similar between KO and WT mice. Systemic concentrations of GW642444 and GSK932009 (M33) were 
higher in KO compared to WT mice (AUC0-t increases of 1.8- and 3-fold, respectively). In addition, the 
liver  exposure  to  GW642444  was  higher in  KO  mice  versus  WT  mice  (2.5-fold).  In  brain  homogenate 
there was at least a 7.4-fold increase in the AUC0-t value of GW642444 in KO mice compared to WT 
mice. In conclusion, P-gp attenuated the CNS penetration of GW642444, but did not appear to play a 
major role in limiting its absorption. The role of P-gp in the biliary elimination of GW642444 and/or its 
metabolites was thought unlikely to be of biological importance.

Blood, plasma, liver and lung and GI tract concentration 
As  part  of  the  excretion  studies  performed  with  14C-  GW642444  (as  the  α-phenylcinnamate  salt, 
GW642444H-  350  mcg/kg)  via  i.v  or  oral  route  in  male  Sprague  Dawley  rats,  total  radioactivity  in 
blood, plasma, lungs and liver were determined for up to 96 hours post dose.  The mean blood:plasma 
concentration ratios of total DRM ranged from 0.8 to 1.1 following intravenous dosing and from 0.4 to 
0.7  following  oral  administration.  These  data  indicate  that  radioactivity  was  predominantly  associated 
with  the  plasma  fraction.  The  mean  liver:plasma  ratios  of  DRM  ranged  from  17  to  21  following 
intravenous dosing and from 3 to 11 following oral administration. Similarly, lung:plasma ratios ranged 
from 4 to 22 and 0.6 to 2 following intravenous and oral dosing, respectively. These data demonstrate 
a greater uptake of systemic DRM into the liver compared to lung. 
In  another  excretion  study,  the  concentrations  of  total  radioactivity  in  blood,  plasma  and  liver  were 
determined  at  a  single  sample  time  (48  hours  post  dose)  following  administration  of  a  single 
intravenous or oral dose of 14C-GW642444 (1000 mcg/kg, nominal) to male BDC Sprague Dawley rats 
(n=3/group).    Mean  blood:plasma  concentration  ratios  of  DRM  were  0.7  (intravenous)  and  0.9  (oral) 
corresponding to a blood cell association of 15% (intravenous) and 42% (oral), respectively. The mean 
liver:plasma  concentration  ratios  of  DRM  for  each  dosing  route  were  similar,  approximately  12 
(intravenous) and 8 (oral). 
Likewise, the concentration of total radioactivity in blood, plasma, lungs and liver was determined in an 
excretion  study  following  administration  of  a  single  intravenous  or  single  oral  dose  of  14C-GI179710 
(counter ion of GW642444M triphenylacetate salt) at 500 and 1000 mcg/kg, respectively, to groups of 
male  Sprague  Dawley  rats  (n=3/group).  The  mean  blood:plasma  concentration  ratios  of  DRM  ranged 
from  0.5  to  0.8  for  both  routes  of  administration.  These  data  indicate  that  DRM  was  predominantly 
associated with the plasma fraction. Similarly, mean liver:plasma and lung:plasma ratios ranged from 
6  to  27  and  0.5  to  0.9,  respectively.  These  data  demonstrate  uptake  of  systemic  DRM  into  the  liver 
was greater than for the lung. 
Whole body distribution 
Whole  body  distribution  was  examined  in  rats  and  dogs  following  iv  and  oral  administration  of  14C-
GW642444.   
Pigmented  (Lister  Hooded)  male  rats  (n=6/group)  received  a  single  intravenous  (over  30  seconds) 
administration  of  14C-GW642444  (as  the α-phenylcinnamate  salt,  GW642444H)  at  a  nominal  dose  of 
350 mcg/kg. Following intravenous dosing, rats were killed (n=1) at 15 minutes, 6 hours, and 1, 3, 10 
and 35 days post dose, and QWBA performed. DRM was widely distributed into tissues at 15 minutes 
post  dose,  with  the  highest  observed  concentrations  for  the  vast  majority  of  tissues  occurring  at  this 
time.    The  vast  majority  of  tissues  contained  concentrations  greater  than  that  observed  in  blood. 
Highest concentrations of DRM at 15 minutes post dose were observed in the kidney, adrenals, choroid 
plexus  and  thyroid.  The  highest  observed  concentrations  for  some  tissues,  including  the  Harderian 
gland, brown and white fat, preputial gland, seminal vesicles and pancreas, did not occur until 6 hours 
after dosing. DRM was also distributed into melanin containing tissues such as the eye and pigmented 
skin. Distribution into the brain or CNS was low following intravenous administration. Concentrations of 
DRM  declined  from  the  earlier  time  points  and  at  35  days  only  the  uveal  tract/retina  and  testis 
contained quantifiable radioactivity.

After Pigmented (Lister Hooded) male rats (n=6/group) received a single oral (gavage) administration 
of  14C-GW642444  (as  the  α-phenylcinnamate  salt,  GW642444H)  at  a  nominal  dose  of  350  mcg/kg, 
only  a  limited  number  of  tissues  contained  quantifiable  concentrations  of  radioactivity  at  any  time 
point.  Those  that  did  included the  kidney  (cortex  and  medulla),  liver,  adrenal,  salivary  glands, brown 
fat,  lung,  uveal  tract  and  the  mucosae  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  Other  than  the  gastrointestinal 
tract, no tissue contained quantifiable levels after 3 days. 
For  the  14C-GI179710  counter  ion  (500  mcg/kg),  DRM  was  widely  distributed  in  Pigmented  (Lister 
Hooded) male rats with the highest concentrations observed in the vast majority of tissues at the first 
sampling  time  (5  minutes)  following  iv  administration.  Highest  concentrations  were  observed  in  the 
liver,  tongue,  kidney  cortex,  myocardium,  pineal  body,  lung  and  bulbo-urethral  gland.  With  the 
exception  of  various  components  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  all  tissues  attained  their  highest 
observed  concentrations  of  DRM  at  5  minutes  after  dosing.  Tissue  concentrations  of  DRM  declined 
rapidly such that by 3 days post dose, concentrations in all tissues were generally below or close to the 
limit of quantification (0.003 mcg equivalents of GI179710/g). There was no evidence of association of 
DRM  with  melanin  containing  tissues,  with  no  tissue  containing  a  quantifiable  concentration  of 
radioactivity at 35 days post dose. 
Following  oral  dosing  (gavage)  of  the  14C-GI179710  counter  ion  (500  mcg/kg)  DRM  was  widely 
distributed, with highest concentrations of radioactivity observed in the vast majority of tissues at the 
first sampling time (30 minutes). The tissues containing the highest concentrations of DRM at this time 
(excluding components of the gastrointestinal tract) were the liver, kidney cortex, tooth pulp, pancreas 
and  tongue.  Tissue  concentrations  of  DRM  declined  rapidly  such  that  by  3  days  post  dose, 
concentrations  in  all  tissues  were  generally  below  or  close  to  the  limit  of  quantification  (0.003  mcg 
equivalents  of  GI179710/g).  There  was  no  evidence  of  association  of  DRM  with  melanin  containing 
tissues, with no tissue containing a quantifiable concentration of radioactivity at 35 days post dose. 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
A  single  study  has  been  performed  to  assess  the  protein  binding  of  GW685698  and  GW642444  co-
incubated in plasma from healthy volunteers, severe renally impaired subjects and mild, moderate and 
severe hepatically impaired subjects. 
Plasma Protein Binding: 
The protein binding of GW685698 (10 ng/mL) and GW642444 (2 ng/mL) as the triphenylacetate salt, 
GW642444M, was investigated in incubations where both components were co-incubated with plasma 
obtained  from  healthy  subjects  (male  and  female),  severe  renally  impaired  subjects  and  mild, 
moderate  and  severe  hepatically  impaired  subjects.  In  addition,  the  protein  binding  of  GW642444  (2 
ng/mL)  was  also  investigated  in  incubations  with  individual  human  plasma  proteins:  human  serum 
albumin  (40  mg/mL),  α-acid  glycoprotein  (0.8  mg/mL)  and  γ-globulin  (7  mg/mL)  dissolved  in 
phosphate  buffered  saline.  Plasma  protein  binding  was  determined  by  ultrafiltration  following 
incubation for 15 minutes at 37°C. The concentration of GW685698 and GW642444 in the ultrafiltrate 
and  original  plasma  incubation  was  determined  by  HPLC-MS/MS.  Protein  binding  of  GW685698  was 
similar  in  incubations  of  plasma  obtained  from  healthy  male  and  females  and  renal  and  hepatic 
impaired  human  subjects  (>99.7%  in  all  cases).  Protein  binding  of  GW642444  was  similar  in  plasma 
obtained from male (89.1 to 91.7%) and female (88.7 to 90.9%) human subjects. Protein binding of 
GW642444  was  higher  (corresponding  to  lower  protein  free  concentrations)  in  plasma  obtained  from 
renal  and  hepatic  impaired  subjects  (93.3  to  95.8%)  compared  to  healthy  subjects.  GW642444  was 
moderately  bound  to  human  serum  albumin  (60.3%)  and  α-acid  glycoprotein  (60.8%),  whereas  the 
extent of binding to γ-globlin was low (7.9%).

Metabolism 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
In vitro studies: 
In  vitro  studies  were performed  using  hepatic  microsomes,  hepatocytes  and heterologiusly  expressed 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.  The major route of metabolism observed in vitro, in all species, was 
hydrolysis of the S-fluoromethyl carbothioate function to form the carboxylic acid, GW694301X (M10). 
All  metabolites  identified  in  human  hepatocytes  were  formed  via  this  route,  sometimes  coupled  with 
other routes e.g. glucuronide conjugation (M24) or oxidative defluorination at the C-6 position (M26). 
Hydrolysis  to  GW694301X  (M10)  was  also  observed  in  mouse,  rat,  dog  and  rabbit  hepatocyte 
incubations. Oxidative defluorination, to M21 or M26, and glucuronide conjugation, to M24, were also 
observed in rat and dog hepatocytes. 
Metabolism  of  GW685698  and  generation  of  GW694301X  (M10)  in  human  liver  was  completely 
inhibited  by  the  CYP3A4  inhibitor  ketoconazole  only  or  was  only  shown  to  occur  in  the  presence  of 
CYP3A4  enzymes  following  incubation  with  human  heterologously  expressed  CYP  enzymes.    Further 
studies  correlating  human  metabolism  with  in  vitro  reaction  phenotyping  experiments  indicated  that 
the main routes of human metabolism were also catalysed by CYP3A4. This included both hydrolysis of 
the S-fluoromethyl carbothioate function to form the carboxylic acid, GW694301X (M10) and oxidative 
defluorination  (to  M26  and  related  metabolites).  Furthermore  of  the  other  metabolites  identified  in  in 
situ  studies  using  isolated  perfused  rat  liver  (IPRL),  almost  all  resulted  exclusively  from  further 
metabolism of M10, i.e., hydrolysis coupled with: glucuronide conjugation (M5, M7); thiol conjugation 
(M1,  M2,  M3,  M4,  M1);  oxidative  defluorination  (M2,  M5,  M8,  M9);  hydroxylation  (M9); 
dehydrogenation (M11) and loss of the furoic acid moiety (M6, M12). 
There  was  no  evidence  of  metabolism  of  GW685698  by  human  lung  microsome  or  s9  preparations 
(WD2004/00004/00). GW685698 was metabolised in dog nasal s9 preparations but not metabolised in 
rat  s9  nasal  preparations  or  human  CYP2A13  (a  CYP450  isoenzyme  known  to  be  present  in  human 
nasal mucosa). 
In vivo studies: 
In all nonclinical species (mouse, rat, dog, rabbit and human), the principal route of metabolism was 
hydrolysis  of  the  S-fluoromethyl  carbothioate  to  form  a  range  of  metabolites  including  GW694301X 
(M10).  
GW694301X (M10) was characterised as a major metabolite in mouse, rat and dog metabolism studies 
(using  intravenous  and  oral  routes)  and  was  identified  as  a  metabolite  in  dog  plasma  following 
intravenous administration.  In most cases the principle route of metabolism was via hydrolysis of the 
S-fluoromethyl  carbothioate  group  to  several  metabolites  including  that  of  the  major  metabolite 
GW694301X  (M10).    In  rat,  other  principal  metabolites  coupled  hydrolysis  to  M10  with  glucuronide 
conjugation  (M24)  and  glutathione  conjugation  (M1/M3  and  M31).  Oxidative  defluorination  (M8)  and 
loss  of  the  furoate  moiety  from  the  carboxylic  acid  was  also  observed  (M6).    In  dog,  other  principal 
metabolites  coupled  hydrolysis  to  M10  with  defluorination  (M8,  M26  and  M29),  hydroxylation  (M29), 
cysteinyl  glycine  conjugation  (M23),  defluorination/glucuronide  conjugation  (M25),  and  glucuronide 
conjugation  (M24).  In  humans,  following  oral  or  intravenous  administration  of  14C-GW685698  to 
humans the only major drug-related component identified in the faeces was GW694301X (M10). Other 
identified metabolites coupled hydrolysis to M10 with defluorination and hydroxylation (M26 and M32). 
These  metabolites  were  not  identified  in  non-clinical  species  tested  but  were  judged  as  being  minor 
representing <3% of DRM.

Vilanterol (GW64244) 
In vitro studies: 
In vitro studies were performed using hepatic and lung microsomes, hepatocytes and cytochrome P450 
(CYP) screen. In microsomes from rats, dogs and humans, and lung microsomes from humans the in 
vitro  clearance  of  GW642444  was  high  in  rat  (19  to  31  mL/min/g liver)  and human  liver  microsomes 
(30 to 49 mL/min/g liver) and moderate in dog liver microsomes (8 mL/min/g liver). Characterisation 
of  human  microsomal  drug-related  products  by  HPLC-MS  indicated  that  the  most  abundant  human 
microsomal metabolite was GW630200 (subsequently referred to as M29). GW642444 was stable when 
incubated  with  human  lung  microsomes.    Similarly,  intrinsic  clearance  of  GW642444  (as  the 
triphenylacetate  salt,  GW642444M)  by  human  liver  microsomes  was  rapid,  with  a  mean  calculated 
intrinsic  clearance  value  of  111  mL/min/g  liver.  Intrinsic  clearance  of  GW642444  in  human  intestinal 
microsomes was approximately 4.5-fold lower than observed for liver microsomes, and GW642444 was 
metabolically stable using human lung microsomes. 
Metabolism of 14C-GW642444 by human liver microsomes and microsomes expressing individual CYP 
isoenzymes,  showed  that  turnover  of  14C-GW642444  was  high  (48%)  in  human  liver  microsomes 
producing  4  major  metabolites;  M29  (GW630200)  and  M31  formed  following  O-dealkylation,  M20 
formed  following  N-dealkylation  and  M40  resulting  from  amine  hydrolysis.  Other  minor  metabolites, 
M47,  M26,  M16  and  M32,  were  also  detected  by  LC/MSn  only.  The  production  of  M29  (GW630200), 
M31 and M20 was predominantly mediated by CYP3A4 with minor contributions from CYP2D6. M40 was 
thought likely to be a further metabolite of M20 which is not mediated by cytochrome P450 but may be 
due  to  amine  oxidase.  In  human  liver  microsomes  the  predominant  route  of  metabolism  was  O-
dealkylation  to  M29  (GW630200).  The  in  vitro  metabolism  of  GW642444  was  primarily  mediated  by 
CYP3A4 with minor contributions by CYP2D6.   
The in vitro turnover of GW642444 in human hepatocytes in 2 hours was 95% (1 mcM) and 81% (12.5 
mcM). At a concentration of 1 mcM the intrinsic clearance of GW642444 was 0.021 mL/min/106 cells 
(~2.5 mL/min/g liver). The major metabolite of GW642444 in human liver hepatocytes was identified 
as a carboxylic acid derivative of GW630200 (M29) - subsequently referred to as GSK932009 or M33. 
The  extent  of  metabolism  in  human  liver  hepatocytes  varied  between  the  different  preparations  and 
ranged  between  42 to  64%  turnover  at 4  hours.  The  major  route  of  metabolism  in each  human  liver 
hepatocyte  sample  studied  was  O-dealkylation  to  M33  (GSK932009)  and  M29  (GW630200)  which 
represented  means  of  approximately  12  and  24%  of  the  total  metabolism,  respectively.  These 
metabolites  were  also  detected  in  rat  and  dog.    Other  minor  metabolites  were  detected  which 
represented approximately 7% or less of the total metabolism and were generally, also, the result of 
dealkylation  metabolism.  The  major  metabolite  identified  in  rat  liver  hepatocytes  was  M12,  an  O-
glucuronide conjugate, which represented approximately 40% of the metabolites assigned. The major 
metabolite  identified  in  dog  liver  hepatocytes  was  M26  (C-dealkylation  or  oxidative  loss  of  the  salicyl 
alcohol)  which  represented  approximately  43%  of  the  metabolites  assigned.  Numerous  other 
metabolites were identified in the rat and dog which included a range of O-dealkylated metabolites. 
The  main  route  of  metabolism  of  GI179710  in  human  hepatocytes  was  acyl  glucuronidation, 
representing  approximately  95%  of  the  total  metabolism.  Other  metabolites  resulted  from  para-
hydroxylation/acyl  glucuronidation  and  acyl  glucose  conjugation  which  represented  5%  or  less  of  the 
total  metabolism.  Acyl  glucuronidation  was  prevalent  in  all  nonclinical  species  (mouse,  rat,  female 
rabbit  and  dog)  investigated  (78  to  94%  of  the  total  metabolism).  In  general,  metabolic  profiles  in 
nonclinical  and  human  hepatocytes  were  qualitatively  similar.  The  extent  of  metabolism  of  14C-
GI179710 was high in all species investigated.

A  study  was  performed  to  assess  the  potential  for  chiral  conversion  of  GW642444  (R-enantiomer)  to 
GSK907117 (S-enantiomer) in control human plasma and in rat and dog ex-vivo plasma obtained from 
separate  studies.  Using  chiral  HPLC  separation  with  MS  detection  to  detect  interconversion  of 
GW642444 and its enantiomer GSK907117, no evidence of chiral conversion (>10%) of GW642444 to 
GSK907117 in plasma obtained following inhaled administration of GW642444M to the rat or dog or in 
incubations of GW642444 in control human plasma was observed. 
Finally, in a cytochrome P450 inhibition screen, the mean IC50 values for GW642444 were >100, >23, 
>70  and  12  mcM  for  CYP450  1A2,  2C9,  2C19  and  2D6,  respectively.  The  inhibition  potential  of 
GW642444 for CYP3A4 was determined against two CYP3A4 substrates: diethoxyfluorescein (DEF) and 
7- benzoquinoline (7BQ). The mean IC50 values were 4.2 and 11 mcM, respectively. 
In vivo studies: 
Following  intravenous  administration  of  14C-GW642444  (α-phenylcinnamate  salt)  at  350  mcg/kg  in 
male  Sprague  Dawley  rats,  the  main  routes  of  elimination  of  DRM  were  via  the  faeces  (69%  of  the 
administered dose) and urine (19% of the administered dose). Elimination was largely by metabolism 
with the main routes being dealkylation (13% dose via M7, M26, M1, M3/30, M9), oxidation (22% dose 
via M34, M7, M30, M1, M9) and glucuronide conjugation (5% dose via M1, M3). A further 13% of the 
administered  dose  was  excreted  as  unchanged  GW642444  in  the  faeces  potentially  resulting  from 
either  direct  secretion  of  GW642444  or  hydrolysis  of  the  corresponding  glucuronide.  The  principal 
radiolabelled components observed in plasma following intravenous dosing were unchanged parent and 
an unidentified component.  Similarly, in male BDC Sprague Dawley rat using single intravenous (500 
mcg/kg) doses of 14C-GW642444, the main routes of elimination of DRM were via the bile (45% of the 
dose) and urine (32% of the dose). Metabolite quantification in both urine and bile was difficult due to 
the  complexity  of  the  profiles  and  the  low  concentration  of  radioactivity  in  the  samples.  The  main 
metabolites  were  by  glucuronidation  (to  M12  representing  8%  of  the  dose  in  bile)  and  by  O-
dealkylation/oxidation  (to  M7,  M9  and  M30  representing  5,  5  and  3%  of  the  dose,  respectively,  in 
urine).  Faecal  elimination  was  a  minor  route  (6%  of  the  dose)  and  contained  mainly  unchanged 
GW642444 (4% of the dose), possibly resulting from direct gut secretion.   
Following intravenous administration of 14C-GI179710 to rats, the principal radiolabelled components 
in  plasma,  liver  and  lung  samples  at  the  selected  time  points  were  unchanged  GI179710  and  M18. 
GI179710  represented  35  to  65%  plasma  radioactivity  whilst  M18  represented  16  to  28%  of  plasma 
radioactivity.

Following  oral  administration  of  14C-GW642444  (α-phenylcinnamate  salt)  at  350  mcg/kg  in  male 
Sprague  Dawley  rats,  elimination  was  was  largely  via  faeces  (86%  of  the  administered  dose)  which 
mainly constituted unchanged parent (at least 77% of the administered dose). Unchanged GW642444 
in  rat  faeces  is  potentially  due  to  incomplete  absorption,  hydrolysis  of  one  or  more  glucuronide 
conjugates  or  direct  GI  secretion.  Rat  urine  contained  a  further  4.7%  of  the  dose  which  was  almost 
exclusively  made  up  of  metabolites  with  unchanged  GW642444  being  unquantifiable.  Consistent  with 
intravenous administration, the main urinary metabolites resulted from dealkylation (M7, M26, M1, M3, 
M30, M9), oxidation (M7, M26, M30, M9) or glucuronide conjugation (M1, M3). No metabolites could be 
detected  by  LC-MSn  where  the  14C-label  of  GW642444  was  lost  due  to  O-dealkylation.  Plasma 
obtained following oral administration was not analysed due to insufficient radioactivity. Furthermore, 
in  male  BDC  Sprague  Dawley  rat  using  single  oral  (1000  mcg/kg)  doses  of  14C-GW642444,  faecal, 
biliary  and  urinary  excretion  accounted  for  54.6,  28.3  and  8.8%  of  the  dose,  respectively.  Faecal 
radioactivity  contained  predominantly  unchanged  GW642444  (49%  administered  dose)  which  is  most 
likely  unabsorbed  drug  although  a  proportion  may  be  a  result  from  direct  gut  secretion.  The  main 
routes  of  metabolism  of  GW642444  in  the  BDC  rat  following  oral  dosing  were  by  glucuronidation  (to 
M12  which  represented  25%  of  the  dose  in  bile)  or  by  O-dealkylation,  oxidation  and  O-glucuronide 
conjugation (to M1 which represented 4.5% of the dose in urine). 
Following  oral  administration  of  14C-GI179710  to  rats,  the  principal  radiolabelled  components  in 
plasma,  liver  and  lung  samples  at  the  selected  time  points  were  unchanged  GI179710  (33  to  55% 
plasma radioactivity) and the acyl glucuronide (17 to 32% of plasma radioactivity). 
Major  metabolites  were  also  examined  in  male  beagle  dogs  dosed  with  a  single  intravenous  or  single 
oral  doses  of  14C-GW642444  (as  the  α-phenylcinnamate  salt,  GW642444H)  at  50  and  100  mcg/kg, 
respectively.  Following  intravenous  administration  of  14C-GW642444  (as  the  α-phenylcinnamate  salt, 
GW642444H)  to  the  dog,  elimination  of  DRM  was  via  both  the  faeces  and  urine  (48  and  39%  of  the 
administered  dose,  respectively).  Elimination  was  almost  completely  by  metabolism  with  the  main 
routes being dealkylation (30% dose via M30, M7, M33 and M9) and oxidation (45% dose via M30, M7, 
M16  and  M9).  The  proportion  of  dose  excreted  as  unchanged  GW642444  was  negligible.  No 
metabolites could be detected by HPLC-MS where the 14C-label had been lost. Unchanged GW642444 
was the only major component observed in dog plasma following intravenous dosing. A high proportion 
of  DRM  in  dog  plasma  and  faeces  was  unextractable.    Elimination  of  14C-GW642444  DRM  following 
oral administration was via both faeces and urine (56 and 22% of the administered dose, respectively). 
Unchanged GW642444 represented only 16% of the administered dose in dog faeces and is probably a 
reflection  of  either  moderate  or  good  absorption  of  the  14C-GW642444  α-phenylcinnamate  salt.  The 
main  routes  of  metabolism  in  the  dog  (as  for  intravenous  administration)  were  via  dealkylation  (to 
M30, M7, M33, M9 and M26) and oxidation (to M30, M7, M16), representing a combined 23% and 19% 
of  the  administered  dose,  respectively.  Two  principal  radiolabelled  components  were  detected  in  dog 
plasma  (1  hour  post  dose)  and  were  identified  as  unchanged  GW642444  (44%  plasma  radioactivity) 
and  M26  (a  metabolite  resulting  from  C-dealkylation  and  representing  30%  plasma  radioactivity).  A 
large proportion of DRM in dog plasma was unextractable.

Following  intravenous  administration  of  14C-GI179710  (500  mcg/kg)  to  the  dog,  elimination  of  DRM 
was  mainly  via  faeces  (88%  administered  dose)  but  also  via  urine  (11%  administered  dose). 
Elimination was largely by excretion of unchanged GI179710 (73% administered dose), of which 72% 
and  1%  administered  dose  was  in  the  faeces  and  urine,  respectively.  Unchanged  GI179710  in  faecal 
extracts may have (at least in part) resulted from hydrolysis of the corresponding acyl glucuronides. A 
further 13% of the administered dose was eliminated via acyl glucuronidation (comprising 9% dose in 
urine and 4% in faeces). The principal radiolabelled components in the plasma samples at the selected 
time points were unchanged GI179710 (16 to 70% plasma radioactivity) and the acyl glucuronides (17 
to  57%).  An  acyl  glucose  conjugate  represented  3  to  17%  plasma  radioactivity.  Following  oral 
administration of 14C-GI179710 (1000 mcg/kg) to the dog (Report FD2005/00186/00), elimination of 
radioactive  DRM  in  the  dog  was  predominantly  via  the  faeces  (76%  dose)  with  urine  representing 
approximately  17%  of  dose.  Unchanged  GI179710  was  the  largest  component  in  dog  faeces 
representing  57%  of  the  administered  dose  which  may  have  resulted  from  either  incomplete 
absorption or hydrolysis of the corresponding acyl glucuronides. The similarity between the elimination 
data  in  urine  and  faeces  from  dogs  dosed  orally  and  intravenously,  however,  would  tend  to  indicate 
that  oral  absorption  was  good.  Approximately  15%  of  the  administered  dose  was  eliminated  via  acyl 
glucuronidation  (comprising  12%  and  3%  dose  in  urine  and  faeces,  respectively).  The  principal 
radiolabelled  components  in  plasma  samples  at  the  selected  time  points  were  unchanged  GI179710 
(25  to  52%  plasma  radioactivity)  and  acyl  glucuronides  (38  to  52%).  An  acyl  glucose  conjugate 
represented 6 to 10% plasma radioactivity. 
In humans, information on metabolism was obtained from human plasma on Day 7 following repeated 
inhalation  dosing  of  GW642444  (as  the  α-phenylcinnamate  salt,  GW642444H)  at  200  mcg/kg  to 
asthmatic  subjects.  GW642444  was  detected  in  all  the  samples  analysed.  M33  (GSK932009,  O-
dealkylation  with  oxidation)  was  detected  in  pooled  0  to  12  hour  plasma  and  in  individual  plasma 
samples taken at 1 hour post dose from all 9 subjects. M29 (GW630200, O-dealkylation) was detected 
in  the  plasma  of  one  out  of  nine  subjects  taken  at  1  hour  post  dose.  It  is  possible  that  other 
metabolites may have been present in plasma but were not detected under the conditions used.  
Metabolism  of  GW642444  was  also  studied  in  six  healthy  male  volunteers  following  a  single  oral 
administration  of  14C-GW642444  (200  mcg).  Elimination  of  GW642444  was  mainly  by  metabolism 
followed  by  excretion  of  metabolites  in  urine,  or  to  a  lesser  extent,  faeces.  The  main  routes  of 
metabolism were assigned as various O-dealkylation pathways which accounted for up to 78% of the 
recovered  radioactive  dose  (combined  for  urine  and  faeces).  Metabolism  via  C-  or  N-dealkylation 
accounted  for  a  further  5%  of  the  recovered  radioactive  dose.  Unchanged  GW642444  was  a  small 
component in faeces (5% of the recovered radioactive dose), representing either unabsorbed material 
or  unchanged  GW642444  (or  conjugate)  secreted  directly  into  the  GI  tract  or  via  human  bile.  The 
residual 12% of the recovered radioactive dose constituted a mixture of small unassigned components. 
Human circulating plasma metabolites were also mainly the products of O- or C-dealkylation. 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
No metabolism PK studies were performed on the fixed dose combination fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
which was considered acceptable based on the data provided for the individual compounds.

Excretion 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Rat: 
Following  a  single oral of 3H-GW685698, 100  mcg/kg  (nominal)  in  male  and female  Wistar  Han  rats, 
the majority of the DRM was excreted in the faeces (90% to 92% of the dose) with the majority being 
excreted within the first 24 hours after dosing (77% to 87% of the dose). Very little of the dose (0.5 to 
0.7%)  was  excreted  in  the  urine.  At  168  hours  after  dosing,  only  traces  of  the  administered  dose 
remained in the carcass (<1%). There was no difference in the excretion pattern of DRM between the 
sexes, and the total mean recovery of DRM in both male and female rats was 92% of the dose. 
Following  a  single  intravenous  dose  of  3H-GW685698  as  a  bolus  at  100  mcg/kg  in  male  and  female 
Wistar  Han  rats,  most  of  DRM  was  again  excreted  in  the  faeces  (90%  to  97%  of  the  dose),  with  the 
majority being excreted within the first 24 hours after dosing (79% to 89% of the dose). These data 
indicated that the majority of the DRM was eliminated via the bile into the gastrointestinal tract. Minor 
amounts  of  the  dose  were  excreted  in  the  urine  (0.3%  to  1.1%  of  the  dose),  indicating  that  renal 
excretion is a minor route of elimination following intravenous dosing. At 168 hours after dosing, only 
traces of the administered dose remained in the carcass (<1%). There was no notable difference in the 
excretion  pattern  of  DRM  between  the  sexes,  and  the  total  mean  recovery  of  DRM  in  both  male  and 
female rats was 94% and 96%, respectively. 
The  majority  of  the  recovered  radioactivity  (67%)  following  a  bolus  dose  of  14C-GW685698  (1000 
mcg/mL)  administered to male  Wistar  Han  rats  was  excreted  in  the  faeces  within  24  hours  of  dosing 
(~61%  of  the  dose)  with  the  total  mean  recovery  over  96  hours  in  the  faeces  being  approximately 
65%  of  the  dose.  Urinary  excretion  accounted  for  approximately  1.2%  of  the  dose.  Digestion  of  the 
carcass  only  accounted  for  a  further  1.1%  of  the  radioactive  dose,  indicating  that  the  discrepancy 
between dosed and recovered radioactivity was not due to retention in tissues.  Following a 30 minute 
intravenous infusion of 14C-GW685698 (0.2 mg/mL) to male Wistar Han rats, the mean total recovery 
of the radioactive dose over 48 hours was 91%. The higher recovery of radioactivity from the rats in 
this  study  in  which  a  different  dose  vehicle  and  infusion  administration  were  used  indicates  that  the 
lower recovery in the previous study was probably due to the bolus administration and precipitation of 
the dose following administration. As seen in previous intravenous elimination studies, the major route 
of  elimination  was  via  the  faeces,  accounting  for  86.4%  of  the  dose;  urinary  excretion  was  a  minor 
route, accounting for only 1.7% of the dose. Minor amounts of the administered radioactivity (0.97%) 
were  recovered  in  expired  gases.  Elimination  of  radioactivity  was  rapid  with  the  majority  (>85%)  of 
the dose excreted over the first 24 hours. A mean of 1.9% of the dose was resident in the carcasses at 
48 hours post dose. 
Subcutaneous  administration  of  3H-GW685698  at  a  dose  of  100  mcg/kg  in  Wistar  Han  rats  again 
demonstrated that most of the dose was excreted in the faeces (42% to 81%) with excretion occurring 
over the 168 hours collection period after dosing. Generally, the majority of the DRM was excreted in 
the first 72 hours after dosing compared to that excreted in the next 96 hours. Very little of the dose 
was  excreted  in  the  urine  (0  to  0.7%).  At  168  hours  after  dosing,  a  considerable  amount  of  the 
radioactive DRM remained in the carcass (5% to 43%), indicating incomplete release from the site of 
administration.  The  total  mean  recovery  of  DRM  in  male  and  female  Wistar  Han  rats  was  81%  and 
84%, respectively.

Dog: 
Following a single oral of 3H-GW685698 (100 mcg/kg (nominal)) to beagle dogs, the majority of DRM 
was excreted mainly in the faeces via biliary excretion, with  negligible renal excretion (the maximum 
urinary  recovery  of  DRM  was  about  2%).  The  mean  total  recovery  of  DRM  (including  cage  washes  at 
less than 1% of dose) was 91% over 168 hours. The majority of DRM was excreted within 48 hours. 
No apparent sex-related differences were observed in the excretion of radioactive DRM. 
Following  intravenous  dosing  of  3H-GW685698  (100  mcg/kg)  as  a  slow  bolus    to  beagle  dogs, 
excretion of the DRM occurred mainly in the faeces via biliary excretion, with negligible renal excretion 
(the  maximum  urinary  recovery  of  DRM  was  about  2%).  The  mean  total  recovery  of  DRM  (including 
cage  washes  at  less  than  1%  of  dose)  was  83%  over  168  hours.  The  majority  of  DRM  was  excreted 
within  48  hours.  No  apparent  sex-related  differences  were  observed  in  the  excretion  of  DRM.  In  a 
subsequent  study,  a  bolus  dose  of  14C-GW685698  (100  mcg/mL)  was  mainly  excreted  in  the  faeces 
within  48  hours  of  dosing  (60%  of  the  administered  dose).  Urinary  excretion  accounted  for 
approximately 2% of the dose with cage washings accounting for a further 0.2%. Like that seen in the 
rats  study,  there  was  an  incomplete  recovery  of  radioactivity  from  the  dogs  in  this  study  with 
approximately 66% of the radioactivity being recovered over the 96 hour collection period. 
Following  intravenous  infusion  of  14C-GW685698  (100  mcg/mL)  over  a  30  minute  period  to  beagle 
dogs, the majority of radioactivity was eliminated in the faeces, which accounted for a mean of 81.1% 
of  the  dose  administered,  consistent  with  biliary  secretion  of  GW685698  DRM  followed  by  faecal 
excretion.  Urinary  elimination  was  minor,  accounting  for  a  mean  of  3.5%  of  dose.  Elimination  was 
initially rapid with a mean of approximately 80% of the dose being recovered by 48 hours post dose. 
The  total  recovery  of  radioactivity  (86%)  was  improved  compared  to  the  previous  study,  suggesting 
that  the  lower  recoveries  (on  the  previous  study)  were  due  to  precipitation  of  the  bolus  intravenous 
dose. 
Subcutaneous  administration  also  showed  comparable  elimination  routes  in  beagle  dogs  dosed  with 
100  mcg/mL  3H-GW685698  when  compared  with  oral  and  iv,  although  at  a  slower  rate.    Analysis  of 
the dosing areas collected from the dogs indicated that approximately 48% of the dose still retained at 
the  dose  site,  1  week  after  dosing.  This  provides  evidence  that  3H-GW685698  forms  a  depot  at  the 
subcutaneous dose site from which DRM was slowly released into the systemic circulation. No apparent 
sex-related differences were observed in the excretion of DRM. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Rat: 
Following a single oral 14C-GW642444 (as the α-phenylcinnamate salt, GW642444H) (350 mcg/kg) in 
male Sprague Dawley rats, the major route of elimination observed was via the faeces (mean of 86.1% 
of  the  dose),  with  urinary  elimination  accounting  for  a  mean  of  4.7%  of  the  dose  (see  table  below). 
Elimination of radioactivity was rapid with a mean of approximately 86% of the dose being eliminated 
during 0 to 24 hours post dose. A mean total of 0.2% of the dose was present in the gastrointestinal 
tracts, residual carcasses and livers at 96 hours. At least 5% of the dose was absorbed as judged by 
DRM  in  the  urine  and  residual  carcass  following  oral  administration.  A  comparison  of  radioactivity 
eliminated in urine following oral (4.7%) and intravenous (18.6%) administrations would indicate that 
absorption  was  probably  as  high  as  approximately  25%.  The  mean  total  recovery  of  radioactivity 
(including cage washes) was 91.8% of the dose.

Following a single intravenous dosing in the same study (350 mcg/kg slow bolus over 30 minutes), the 
major  route  of  elimination  of  radioactive  DRM  was  via  the  faeces  (mean  of  69.2%  of  the  dose),  with 
urinary  elimination  accounting  for  a  mean  18.6%  of  the  dose  (see  table  below).  Elimination  of 
radioactivity was fairly rapid with a mean of approximately 73% of the dose eliminated in the urine and 
faeces during 0 to 24 hours post dose. A mean total of approximately 2% of the dose was present in 
the  gastrointestinal  tracts,  residual  carcasses  and  livers  at  96  hours.  The  mean  total  recovery  of 
radioactivity (including cage washes) was 93.3% of the dose. 
Following  a  single  oral  dose  of  14C-GI179710  (triphenylacteic  acid,  the  counter  ion  of  GW642444M 
triphenylacetate  salt)  (1000  mcg/kg)  to  male  Sprague  Dawley  rats,  the  major  route  of  elimination  of 
the  radioactive  DRM,  the  major  route  of  elimination  of  DRM  was  via  the  faeces  (mean  84.4%  of  the 
dose).  Urinary  elimination  accounted  for  a  mean  3.6%  of  the  dose.  Elimination  of  radioactivity  was 
relatively rapid, with a mean of 85% of the dose being recovered in the urine, faeces and cage washes 
by  48  hours  post  dose.  At  least  4%  of  the  dose  was  absorbed  as  judged  by  DRM  in  the  urine  and 
residual  carcass  and  tissues  following  oral  administration.  A  comparison  of  radioactivity  eliminated  in 
urine  following  oral  (3.6%)  and  intravenous  (4.2%)  administrations  would  indicate  that  actual 
absorption  was  probably  higher  than  this.  The  mean  total  recovery  of  radioactivity  (including  cage 
washes) was 88.7% of the dose. 
Following a single intravenous dosing in the same study (500 mcg/kg slow bolus over 30 minutes), the 
major route of elimination of DRM was via the faeces (mean of 84.8% of the dose). Urinary elimination 
accounted  for  a  mean  of  4.2%  of  the  dose.  Elimination  of  radioactivity  was  relatively  rapid,  with  at 
least 87% of the dose being recovered in the urine, faeces and cage washes by 48 hours post dose. A 
mean  total  of  0.4%  of  the  dose  was  recovered  in  the  liver,  lungs,  gastrointestinal  tract  and  residual 
carcass. The mean total recovery of radioactivity (including cage washes) was 90% of the dose. 
To  gain  information  on  the  extent  of  biliary  excretion  and  metabolism  of  GW642444,  male  BDC 
Sprague  Dawley  rats  were  given  a  single  intravenous  or  oral  dose  of  14C-GW642444  (parent  form) 
(500mcg/kg).  The  major  routes  of  elimination  of  DRM  following  intravenous  administration  were  via 
the bile and urine (means of 45% and 32% of the dose, respectively). Approximately 6% of the dose 
was recovered in the faeces. Mean total recovery (including cage washings, livers and carcasses) was 
94% at 48 hours post dose. The major routes of elimination of DRM following oral administration were 
also  via  the  faeces  and  bile  (means  of  55%  and  28%  of  the  dose,  respectively),  a  further  9%  was 
eliminated  via  the  urine.  A  mean  of  at  least  37%  of  the  dose  was  orally  absorbed,  as  judged  by  the 
amounts of DRM in bile and urine. Mean total recovery (including cage washings, livers and carcasses) 
was 95% at 48 hours post dose. Elimination of radioactivity was rapid following both intravenous and 
oral administration, with the majority of the dose being recovered by 24 hours post dose.

Dog: 
Following  a  single  oral  14C-GW642444  (as  the  α-phenylcinnamate  salt,  GW642444H)  to  male  beagle 
dogs, the major route of elimination observed via the faeces (a mean of 56% of the dose), with urinary 
excretion  accounting  for  a  mean  of  22%  of  the  dose  (see  table  below).  Initial  elimination  of 
radioactivity  was  relatively  rapid,  with  a  mean  of  approximately  70%  of  the  dose  eliminated  in  the 
urine and faeces during the period of 0 to 24 hours post dose. At least approximately 22% of the dose 
was  absorbed  as  judged  by  DRM  in  the  urine  following  oral  administration.  A  comparison  of 
radioactivity eliminated in urine following oral (22% dose) and intravenous (39% dose) administration 
would indicate that absorption was probably as high as approximately 56%. The mean total recovery 
of radioactivity (including cage washes) was 79% of the dose. Following a single intravenous dosing in 
the same study, the major route of elimination observed was again via the faeces (a mean of 47.9% of 
the  dose),  with  urinary  excretion  accounting  for  a  mean  of  38.8%  of  the  dose  (see  table  below). 
Elimination  of  radioactivity  was  relatively  rapid  with  a  mean  of  approximately  70%  of  the  dose 
eliminated in the urine and faeces during the period 0 to 24 hours post dose. The mean total recovery

Following  a  single  oral  dose  of  14C-GI179710  (triphenylacteic  acid,  the  counter  ion  of  GW642444M 
triphenylacetate salt) (1000 mcg/kg), the major route of elimination of radioactivity was via the faeces 
(a mean of 56% of the dose), with urinary excretion accounting for a mean of 22% of the dose. Initial

22%  of  the  dose  was  absorbed  as  judged  by  DRM  in  the  urine  following  oral  administration.  A 
comparison of radioactivity eliminated in urine following oral (22% dose) and intravenous (39% dose) 
administration would indicate that absorption was probably as high as approximately 56%. The mean 
total  recovery  of  radioactivity  (including  cage  washes)  was  79%  of  the  dose.    When  dosed 
intravenously  (500  mcg/kg  slow  bolus  over  one  minute),  the  major  route of  elimination  observed  via 
the faeces (mean of 88.4% of the dose). Urinary excretion accounted for a mean of 11.1% of the dose. 
Elimination of DRM was prolonged, with a mean of 5.2% of the dose eliminated during 96 to 168 hours 
post dose. The mean total recovery of radioactivity (including cage washes) was 100.6% of the dose.

Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Cytochrome P450 induction by GW685698 in animals 
The potential for GW685698 to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes was investigated in rats. Portions of 
the liver were collected from groups of Wistar Han rats (n=6/sex) which had  received a daily inhaled 
dosed of GW685698 at a target dose of 64 mcg/kg in a 4 week toxicology study.  
Daily  treatment  of  the  rats  with  GW685698  at  this  dose  for  4  weeks  was  not  found  to  have  any 
significant effects on hepatic microsomal protein or total cytochrome P450 (CYP) concentrations, or on 
the activities of the CYP1A, CYP3A, CYP2B, CYP2E or CYP4A enzymes. 
No  other  nonclinical  studies  have  been  performed  to  specifically  investigate  the  potential  for 
GW685698 to undergo pharmacokinetic drug interactions when administered concomitantly with other 
drugs or foods.

Cytochrome P450 induction by GW642444 in animals 
Four  studies  were  performed  in  rats  to  investigate  the  potential  for  GW642444  to  induce  the 
cytochrome  P450  enzymes  following  repeat  inhalation  doses  of  GW642444  as  the  α-phenylcinnamate 
salt,  GW642444H or  as  a triphenulate  salt,  significant,  but  weak  induction  of CYP2B1  mRNA  at  doses 
greater than 890 mcg/kg/day was seen only in male rats dosed for 7 days. No other notable changes 
were observed. Minor increases in the levels of CYP2B2 gene expression (to approximately 7-, 6- and 
6-fold the control values) were observed from all dose groups (0, 45.1, 261.1 or 708.7 mcg/kg/day) in 
the  female  rats  dosed  for  4  weeks.    No  other  notable  changes  were  seen  in  males  or  females 
thereafter. 
No  notable  changes  in  either  the  mean  concentrations  of  microsomal  protein  or  total  CYP450  up 
to7087 mcg/kg/day for 4 weeks. In male rats, there was evidence of a small increase in CYP2E activity 
to a maximum of approximately twice the control. Evidence of a marked increase in the production of 
an  unknown  metabolite  of  testosterone  was  observed  in  all  male  dose  groups.  The  identity  and 
biological  significance  of  this  metabolite  is  unknown.  In  addition,  a  small  dose-dependent  increase  in 
the activity of testosterone 7-alpha hydroxylase (up to approximately3 times the mean control activity) 
was observed in the male only. The biological consequence is unknown. 
Finally,  following  daily  dosing  of  GW642444  to  Sprague  Dawley  rats  for  14  days  at  doses  of  up  to 
34422  mcg/kg/day,  there was  no  unequivocal  evidence  of  a  dose-dependent  increase  in  the levels  of 
mRNA for CYP1A1, 1A2, 2B1, 2B2, 2E1, 3A2 (males only, as it is a male specific gene), 3A23 and 4A1. 
No  other  non-clinical  studies  have  been  performed  to  specifically  investigate  the  potential  for 
GW642444 to undergo pharmacokinetic drug interactions when administered concomitantly with other 
drugs  or  foods.  In  toxicology  studies  investigating  the  combination  of  GW642444  with  the 
corticosteroid, GW685698, there was little evidence, in any study, for increased exposure (AUC0-t and 
Cmax)  to  either  GW685698  or  GW642444  (>2-  to  3-fold)  when  dosed  in  combination  compared  to 
when  dosed  alone,  suggesting  that  neither  molecule  interferes  with  the  systemic  clearance  of  the 
other. Likewise, toxicokinetics of GW642444 were generally unaffected following co-administration with 
LAMAs (GSK233705 or GSK573719, two developmental GSK compounds).  
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
No non-clinical studies have been performed to specifically investigate the potential for GW685698 or 
GW642444 to undergo pharmacokinetic drug interactions when administered concomitantly with other 
drugs  or  foods.  In  toxicology  studies  investigating  the  combination  of  GW685698  and  GW642444, 
there was little evidence, in any study, for increased exposure to either GW685698 or GW642444 when 
dosed in combination compared to when dosed alone, suggesting that neither molecule interferes with 
the  systemic  clearance  of  the  other.  There  were  occasional  incidences,  especially  in  the  shorter 
duration studies, where systemic exposure of both components was lower on co-administration.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The  toxicity  of  fluticasone  furoate  and  of  vilanterol  have  been  evaluated  in  an  extensive  non-clinical 
program. The toxicology program included single-dose and repeat-dose toxicity studies in five species 
(mice,  rats,  dogs,  rabbits  and  guinea  pigs)  via  four  routes  of  administration  (oral,  subcutaneous, 
intravenous and inhalation), in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity studies, reproduction and developmental 
toxicity  studies  and  carcinogenicity  studies.  Repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  and  reproduction  toxicity 
studies were conducted with the FDC fluticasone furoate/vilanterol. This is in line with the Guideline on 
the 
non-clinical 
development 
of 
fixed 
combinations 
of  medicinal 
products 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). 
Single dose toxicity 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Single  dose  toxicity  studies  have  been  performed  in  order  to  determine  the  inhalation  toxicity  of 
GW685698.  In  addition,  single  dose  toxicity  studies  have  been  performed  with  GW685698 
administered  via  the  oral,  SC  and  IV  routes,  Dose  levels  in  the  inhalation  studies  represented  the 
highest  technically  achievable  aerosol  concentrations  with  a  particle  size  distribution  suitable  for 
inhalation testing in rodents.  
In one study, CD-1 mice were given vehicle alone (lactose) or GW685698 then killed on Day 3 or Day 
15.  It  was  observed  marked  body  weight  loss  in  the  majority  of  males  (mean  4.3%)  and  all  females 
(mean  10.8%).  Treatment-related  microscopic  findings  are  limited  to  atrophy  in  the  thymus  of  all 
GW685698-treated  animals  and  lymphoid  depletion  in  the  spleen  of  4  animals.  Reversibility  of  the 
microscopic findings and body weight loss was apparent. 
It  was  observed  a  transient,  marked  body  weight  loss  in  all  animals  treated  with  GW685698. 
Treatment-related  microscopic  findings  were  limited  to  reduced  thymus  size  accompanied  by  atrophy 
and  histiocytosis  in  all  GW685698-treated  animals,  and  lymphoid  atrophy  in  the  tracheobronchial 
lymph node of 5 animals. Reddish discoloration of the bronchial lymph node was also noted in one of 
these  animals.  By  Day  15,  lymphoid  atrophy  in the thymus  and  a  reddish  isolated thymic  focus  were 
observed in  one  animal  only;  however,  lymph  node  changes  had  fully  resolved.  The  inhaled  MNLD  of 
GW685698 was defined as ≥ 4400 mcg/kg in the Wistar Han rat. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Single  dose  acute  toxicity  studies  have  not  been  performed  with  GW642444,  except  for  one  study 
designed  to  assess  the  tolerability  of  GW642444  (as  the  α-phenyl  cinnamate  salt)  administered  as  a 
5% dry powder blend in lactose by inhaled administration in beagle dogs.  
In  this  study,  it  was  observed  that  the  administration  of  GW642444  resulted  in  vasodilation  and 
increases  in  pulse  rate.  Pulse  rates  were  elevated  until  12  hours  after  dosing  in  both  the  male  and 
female but were similar to pre-dosing values at 24 hours after completion of dosing. Serum cTnI levels 
were increased in the male, with peak levels being attained 8 hours after dosing.  
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
No  single  dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  on  the  fixed  dose  combination  fluticasone 
furoate/vilanteol which was considered acceptable based on the data available for each compound.

Repeat-dose toxicity 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
The  repeated  dose  inhalation  profile  toxicity  of  GW685698  was  appropriately  assessed  in  mice,  rats 
and  dogs  at  doses  up  to  76.9,  20.3  and  59.6  mcg/kg/day  for  durations  up  to  13,  26  and  39  weeks, 
respectively.  The  high  doses  used  in  these  studies  were  selected  on  the  basis  of  maximum  tolerated 
repeat dose, which were generally limited by decreased body weight gain. In dogs and rats, systemic 
exposures  (AUC)  achieved  at  these  doses  were  less  than  10-fold  those  achieved  in  humans  at  the 
proposed commercial dose of 200 mcg/day. Therefore, exposure multiples are not given for the effects 
observed.  The  obtained  findings  in  these  studies  were  typically  associated  with  glucocorticoid  excess 
and  commonly  reported  for  other  marketed  inhaled  steroids  including  GW685698,  therefore  a  NOAEL 
was not identified. The GW685698 related findings observed in these studies are described below.  
Clinical  observations  included  reductions  in  body  weight  or  lower  body  weight  gain  in  mice,  rats  and 
dogs  at  most  dose levels;  hair  loss  and/or  skin  thinning  in  mice,  rats  and dogs  in  most  dose  groups, 
and  hair  growth  being  predominantly  in  the  telogen  phase  in  rats  dosed  at  ≥8.3  mcg/kg/day  for  26 
weeks and in dogs given GW685698 at ≥20.6 mcg/kg/day with or without GW642444 in the 13 week 
combination toxicity study. 
Immunosuppression  observations  included  buccal  cavity  papillomas  (canine  papilloma  virus), 
exacerbation of minor respiratory tract lesions, chronic inflammation of the stomach and demodecosis 
in the 13 and 39 week studies in dog. 
Lymphoid tissues showed the expected reversible lymphoid depletion in thymus (together with thymic 
atrophy  and  reduced  thymus  weight),  spleen,  larynx,  tonsils,  lymph  nodes  (mesenteric,  mandibular, 
bronchial,  cervical),  NALT,  GALT  and  /  or  laryngeal  mucosal-associated  lymphoid  tissue  in  mice,  rats 
and dogs in most studies.  
Haematology  observations  included  lymphocytopenia,  eosinopenia  and  neutrophilia  in  mice,  rats  and 
dogs  in  most  studies,  together  with  increase  in  red  blood  cell  parameters  (haematocrit,  haemoglobin 
concentration and/or erythrocyte count) in rats and decrease in dogs.  
In the pituitary gland, it was observed reduction in ACTH-producing cells with the resulting increased 
prominence  of  other  cellular  types  including  the  acidophilic  cells  in  the  39  week  study  in  dogs.  The 
impact of this effect included adrenocortical atrophy, a reduction in adrenal weight and lower or absent 
plasma levels of cortisol in all dog studies.  
Metabolic  effects  included  changes  in  clinical  chemistry  parameters  in  rats  and  dogs  (plasma 
triglycerides,  cholesterol,  total  protein,  glucose,  alkaline  phosphatase  and  alanine  aminotransferase 
activities, urinary volume and electrolytes). In addition, reversible hepatocellular vacuolation/increased 
rarefaction was seen in most dog studies.

In the lungs, it was observed increase of minimal eosinophilic inclusions in a very small proportion of 
Clara  cells of  the  bronchial  epithelium  at  all  dose  levels  in  rat  studies  for  ≥  3  months.  The  inclusions 
stained  positive  for  surfactant  protein-D,  which  is  known  to  be  up-regulated  by  corticosteroids.  The 
severity of this effect did not progress with continued treatment and was not seen in mice or dogs, so 
it 
is  considered 
rat  specific. 
It  was  also  observed 
reversible 
increase 
in  alveolar 
histiocytosis/aggregations  of  foamy  macrophages  around  terminal  bronchioles  in  the  lungs  of  rats  in 
the  inhalation  studies  of  4  to  26  weeks  duration  at  doses  up  to  56.4  mcg/kg/day  (representing 
deposited  lung  doses  up  to  5-fold  that  at  the  proposed  commercial  dose).  This  effect  did  not  exceed 
levels  of  severity  seen  in  background  data,  did  not  progress  with  longer  durations  of  dosing  since  it 
was not seen in the carcinogenicity study, and is a normal physiological response to the deposition of 
particulate material in the rat.  
In  the  kidney,  it  was  observed  slight  increase  of  the  naturally  occurring  hyaline  droplets  in  the  renal 
cortical tubules of male rats in some rat studies up to 13 weeks duration with GW685698 alone or in 
combination  with  GW642444.  This  finding  is  considered  to  reflect  a  male  rat-specific  exacerbation 
associated with α2 microglobulin accumulation, which does not have consequence for administration to 
humans. In addition, it was observed slightly increased of focal nephropathy/tubular basophilia in dogs 
at  ≥30.1  mcg/kg/day  in  the  39  week  inhaled  study.  This  effect  was  of  mild  severity,  and  similar  to 
those normally expected in healthy control dogs, so it is considered not to indicate a direct nephrotoxic 
effect.  
In the mammary glands of female rats given GW685698 alone and in combination with GW642444 in 
the  4  and  13  week  combination  toxicity  studies,  an  increased  secretory  activity  was  observed.  A  no 
effect  dose  for  this  change  was  not  identified  and  there  was  an  increased  incidence  in  rats  given 
GW685698  (53.8  or  52.6  mcg/kg/day)  in  combination  with  GW642444  (30.7  or  5.82  mcg/kg/day, 
respectively)  compared  with  those  given  GW685698  (56.4  mcg/kg/day)  alone.  According  to  the 
Applicant, this effect has been reported with other marketed corticosteroids, therefore it is considered 
to have little relevance to the therapeutic use.  
In the rat teeth, it was observed pallor of incisor teeth associated with vacuolation, degeneration and 
disorganisation  of  the  ameloblast  layer  (≥52  mcg/kg/day)  and/or  disorganisation  of  the  odontoblast 
layer at all doses (≥7.85 mcg/kg/day) in animals exposed to GW685698 alone and in combination with 
GW642444  in  the  13  week  study.  These  effects  were  not  seen  in  the  dog,  mouse  or  rabbit.  This  is  a 
known  effect  of  corticosteroids  and  it  is  possible  that  paediatric  patients  may  be  susceptible  to  these 
effects  of  inhaled  corticosteroids,  however,  it  is  less  likely  to  be  of  relevance  for  use  in  adults  or 
adolescent patients. 
In the stomach, minimal or slight inflammatory changes predominantly in the cardia region, were seen 
in  the  39  week  dog  study  at  doses ≥30.1  mcg/kg/day.  These  changes  were  considered  secondary  to 
the immunosuppressant effects of treatment. In addition, minimal or slight GW685698 related findings 
were  seen  in  antrum,  body  and  cardia  regions  of  stomachs  from  dogs  given  GW685698  at  ≥20.6 
mcg/kg/day  with  or  without  GW642444  in  the  13  week  combination  toxicity  study.  Slight  gastric 
erosion  in  the  glandular  stomach  was  also  noted  in  a  small  number  of  rats  exposed  34.6  or  38.9 
mcg/kg/day  for  2  weeks.  This  pathology  is  variable  in  both  species,  did  not  progress  with  longer 
treatment, and it is considered a class effect.

In  addition,  there  was  an  increase  of  connective  tissue  hyalinisation  in  the  pyloric  mucosa  of  the 
stomach  at  all  doses  in  the  2  year  carcinogenicity  study  in  the  mouse.  The  hyaline  material  was 
negative  with  classical  amyloid  staining  (Congo  red  and  Sirius  red),  but  was  positive  for  connective 
tissue  (collagen)  with  Van  Gieson  staining.  Severity  was  minimal  or  slight  in the  majority  of  animals, 
there was no glandular degeneration, and the epithelium retained normal functional appearance. This 
alteration was not seen in rats or dogs, and it is considered to be a local effect on the mucosa since a 
high proportion of the inhaled dose is swallowed.  
In the gall bladder, an increase of luminal mucin was seen in dogs which appear to be dog specific. A 
minor  increase  in  lipid  vacuolation  in  the  bile  duct  and  gall  bladder  epithelium,  not  associated  with 
cellular degeneration or inflammatory changes, was also seen in some dog studies. Since this effect is 
of  similar  severity  to  that  observed  in  untreated  dogs,  and  is  a  dog-specific  observation,  it  is 
considered not of concern for human safety. 
In the skeletal muscle, it was observed pallor and/or minimal to slight myofibre atrophy in hindlimbs of 
dogs given GW685698 at ≥61.0 mcg/kg/day (achieving systemic exposures ≥4-fold those achieved at 
the  proposed  commercial  dose)  with  or  without  GW642444  in  the  13  week  combination  toxicology 
study.  This  is  an  effect  sometimes  seen  with  corticosteroids  in  the  dog  following  long-term 
administration.

Vilanterol (GW64244) 
The  toxicity  profile  of  GW642444  has  been  investigated  adequately  in  repeat  dose  inhaled  toxicity 
studies of up to 13 weeks in mice, 26 weeks in rats and 39 weeks in dogs. Identified NOAELs ocurred 
generally at doses achieving systemic exposures at large multiples of those seen in human patients at 
the proposed commercial dose of 25 mcg/day (13 week mice study NOAEL=38200 mcg/kg/day (4500 
(Cmax) or 2210-fold (AUC)); 26 week female rats study NOAEL=57.7 mcg/kg/day (31 (Cmax) or 20-
fold (AUC)); 26 week male rats study NOAEL=10253 mcg/kg/day (5680 (Cmax) or 2630-fold (AUC)); 
39  week  toxicity  dogs  study  NOAEL=62.5  mcg/kg/day  (305  (Cmax)  or  124-fold  (AUC)).  Toxicological 
findings  in  these  studies were  mostly  associated  with  the  primary  pharmacology  and  seen  with  other 
marketed beta2 agonists. These findings are described below. 
The  principal  toxicity  of  GW642444  was  in  the  heart  and  cardiovascular  system.  GW642444  caused 
tachycardia,  vasodilation,  heart  lesions  in  dogs.  Microscopic  changes  (predominantly  myocardial 
fibrosis) in the papillary muscle of the heart which correlated with increase in heart-rate were seen in 
most  studies.  In  the  13  and  39  week  studies  in  dogs,  NOAELs  for  papillary  muscle  changes  were 
identified  as  9.3  and  62.5  mcg/kg/day,  respectively  (systemic  exposures  26-  or  124-times  those 
achieved in humans at the proposed commercial dose). However, the dose of 0.953 mcg/kg/day with 
and without GW685698 in the 4 week combination toxicity study, produced myocardial fibrosis of the 
interventricular septum. In addition, increases in serum cTnI were noted in some dogs. Cardiovascular 
responses  in  the  dog  were  expected  effects  in  dogs  experiencing  beta2-agonist  peripheral 
vasodilatation and reflex tachycardia. Such lesions could not be relevant to the use in humans at the 
proposed  commercial  dose  because  tachycardia  occurred  at  exposure  44-fold  the  human  exposure  at 
the proposed commercial dose.

In the upper respiratory tract, GW642444 produced irritancy in mice, rats and dogs. In rats, minimal 
to  marked  microscopic  changes  in  nasal  cavity  /  sinuses,  nasopharynx  and  larynx  at  ≥10253 
mcg/kg/day  were  observed  in  the  13  or  26  week  toxicity  studies.  In  mice,  this  finding  which  was  its 
principal  toxicity  was  noted  at  ≥  1020  mcg/kg/day  in  the  13  week  study,  with  nasal  turbinates  and 
larynx being the primary sites, as well as an increased of luminal inflammatory cells/cell debris in the 
nasal  cavity  from  females  at  all  doses  and  olfactory  degenerative  changes  at  ≥62  mcg/kg/day  in  the 
mouse carcinogenicity study. In dogs, this finding was observed in the 39 week inhaled toxicity study, 
in the respiratory epithelium of all treated groups and in the squamous and transitional epithelia of a 
single  male  given  510  mcg/kg/day.  In  addition,  minimal  to  moderate  lymphoid  cell  infiltrate  in  the 
lamina  propria  of  the  olfactory  epithelium  was  seen  in  animals  given  ≥62.5mcg/kg/day.  The  upper 
respiratory  tract  irritancy  determined  the  NOAEL  in  the  13  week  study  in  rat  and  was  the  main  test 
article-related  finding  in  the  13  week  study  in  mouse.  The  findings  observed  in  rats  and  mice  are 
considered  not  to  predict  unacceptable  irritancy  in  humans,  as  the  larynx  is  a  particularly  sensitive 
area of the respiratory tract in rodents and since GW642444 was given for an extended period of time 
which contrasts sharply with the oral inhalation method in humans. The changes in the nasal cavities 
of  dogs  are  also  not  of  concern  as  they  were  only  seen  at  high  doses  administered  by  oronasal 
facemask over a 30 or 60 minute period each day. 
In the lung, it was observed greater incidence of focal pulmonary haemorrhage in rats dosed up to 4 
weeks  duration.  However,  this  effect  is  not  considered  to  be  of  relevance  to  humans  because  it  was 
limited to the rat, resulted from deposited lung doses 37-fold to 25800-fold the proposed commercial 
dose of GW642444 and was seen with similar incidence in control rats. 
Metabolic  effects  produced  by  GW642444  included  increased  weight  gain  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs  at 
most dose levels within the majority of studies, which is a result from an alteration in the distribution 
of fat, enhanced protein synthesis and a reduction in protein degradation in muscle; variable changes 
in serum or plasma protein, albumin, urea and /or creatinine concentrations in mouse, rat and/or dog 
after 13 and or 26/39 weeks treatment which are secondary to the changes in muscle mass and do not 
represent a toxic event. These effects are considered not to represent a hazard to human health since 
there  have  been  no  consequences  with  other  beta2  agonists  in  clinical  use.  Reduction  in  plasma 
glucose  concentrations  in  rats  at  all  doses  in  the  13  and  26  week  studies  have  also  been  observed, 
which may be due to an overcompensation of insulin response to an acute rise in glucose; decrease in 
triglyceride  levels  in  rats  at  ≥657.9  mcg/kg/day  which  is  likely  to  be  related  to  the  beta-adrenergic 
stimulation  of  lipolysis;  changes  in  electrolytes  in  rats  at  all  doses  which  have  been  suggested  to  be 
due to increased tissue uptake or a secondary effect resulting from an increase in insulin. 
In addition, minimal increase in serum alkaline phosphatase activity and bilirubin concentration and a 
decrease  in  serum  alanine  aminotransferase  activity  in  rats  at  doses  ≥658  mcg/kg/day  have  been 
observed  in  the  13  week  toxicity  study.  These  changes  are  considered  not  to  represent  a  hazard  to 
human since none were noted during the rat 26 week study at doses achieving AUC0-t exposures up to 
2500-fold greater than those in humans at the proposed commercial dose.  
Changes produced by GW642444 in hepatocyte rarefaction were seen in the 13 and/or 39 weeks study 
in  dogs  at  doses  ≥9.3  mcg/kg/day  (<21-fold  human  exposure)  and  in  mice  at  doses  ≥6490 
mcg/kg/day (312-fold human exposure). It was showed that these changes in rarefaction were due to 
alterations  in  glycogen  distribution  which  were  fully  reversible.  Administration  of  GW642444  (35.0 
mcg/kg/day)  in  combination  with  GW685698  (63.9  mcg/kg/day)  in  the  13  week  combination  toxicity 
study  in  dogs,  produced  increased  incidence  and  severity  of  changes  in  hepatocyte  rarefaction 
compared with GW642444 (33.5 mcg/kg/day) alone. This apparently enhanced effect in only the high 
dose  combination  and  is  considered  of  no  clinical  relevance  since  at  these doses,  systemic  exposures 
were  77-fold  (GW642444)  and  6-fold  (GW685698)  greater  than  those  in  patients  at  the  proposed 
commercial doses.

In  the  skeletal  muscle,  minor  microscopic  changes  were  seen  in  male  rats  in  all  groups  given 
GW642444  at  ≥6.29  mcg/kg/day  (expected  AUC0-t  is  similar  to  AUC0-t  at  the  human  commercial 
dose)  alone  or  in  combination  with  GW685698  in  the  4  week  combination  toxicity  study.  These 
changes  were  not  seen  in  the  other  performed  studies  with  GW642444  at  doses  achieving  AUC0-t 
>2500-fold greater than that at the proposed commercial dose. 
Haematology  changes  in dogs  included increase  in platelet  count  at  the  highest  dose tested  (2010  to 
571 mcg/kg/day) in the 4 week study, increase in white blood cell count, primarily due to neutrophils 
and monocytes, at 501 mcg/kg in the 13 week study, slight reduction in haemoglobin in female given 
510  mcg/kg/day  during  the  39  week  study.  In  rats,  increase  in  neutrophil  and/or  monocyte  counts, 
along with very small reductions in erythrocyte parameters were noted at 34422 mcg/kg/day with an 
increase  in  reticulocyte  count  apparent  at  ≥625  mcg/kg/day  in  the  14  day  study,  and  reversible 
reductions in platelet counts at ≥56.2 mcg/kg/day (13 weeks) or ≥537 mcg/kg/day (26 weeks). At the 
NOEL  for  haematological  changes  in  the  26  week  study  in  rats  (57.7mcg/kg/day)  and  the  39-week 
study  in  dogs  (62.5  mcg/kg/day),  AUC0-t  was  20-  or  124-fold  greater,  respectively,  than  human 
AUC0-t  at  the  proposed  commercial  dose,  thus  these  findings  are  considered  not  relevant  for  human 
safety at this dose. 
In the thymus, GW642444 was associated with increase of thymic involution/atrophy in dogs at doses 
of  ≥137,  ≥64.2,  ≥9.3  and  510  mcg/kg/day  administered  for  14  days  or  4,  13  or  39  weeks, 
respectively. In dogs, although seen at all doses in the 13 week study in which AUC0-t was ≥26-fold 
greater  than  that  at  the  proposed  human  commercial  dose,  in  the  39  week  study  at  the  NOEL  (62.5 
mcg/kg/day),  AUC0-t  was  124-fold  greater  than  human.  Furthermore,  involution/atrophy  of  the 
thymus  is  a  normal  age-related  change  in  dogs  which  is  often  further  advanced  with  experimental 
stress and is considered not relevant for humans.  
In the female reproductive tract, GW642444 was associated with dose-related myometrial hypertrophy 
seen at doses ≥1020 mcg/kg/day in mouse in the 13 week study and at ≥62 mcg/kg/day in the mouse 
carcinogenicity  study.  The  fact  that  no  myometrial  hypertrophy  in  the  13  week  mouse  study  at  58.6 
mcg/kg/day  (35-fold  human  exposure)  have  been  observed  suggests  the  uterine  changes  have  no 
relevance  to  human  use  at  the  proposed  commercial  dose.  There  was  also  an  increase  of  cystic 
endometrial  hyperplasia  in  all  treated  groups  in  the  mouse  carcinogenicity  study  which  will  be 
discussed in the carcinogenicity part. 
In  rats,  reversible  decrease  of  recent  corpora  lutea,  increase  of  dilated  or  cystic  follicles  in  the  ovary 
and increase of females in a proestrus or estrus state in the 26 weeks study at ≥537 mcg/kg/day have 
been  observed.  At  the  same  doses  in  the  mammary  gland  of  rats,  non-reversible  increase  of  acinar 
development  and  secretory  activity,  as  well  as  incidences  of  lobular  hyperplasia  with  atypia  and/or 
mammary adenoma have been observed. The NOAEL for these effects in rats is 57.7 mcg/kg/day (20-
fold  human  exposure),  which  determined  of  the  rat  26  week  study.  In  addition  in  the  104  week 
carcinogenicity  study  in  rats,  increase  of  serum  estradiol  concentrations  in  females  but  not  males, 
increase  of  ovarian  cysts  at  all  dose  levels,  increase  of  mesovarian  ligament  smooth  muscle 
hyperplasia/hypertrophy  and  leiomyomata  at  ≥84.4/28.2  mcg/kg/day  have  been  observed.  The 
absence of these changes in males in the 26 week study suggests that GW642444 may be acting at a 
local  level  in  the  female  reproductive  tract  in  the  rat  rather  than  through  any  perturbation  of  the 
hypothalamic-pituitary axis.

In mice, the incidence of development of ovarian cysts was increased at ≥62.0 mcg/kg/day, but not at 
6.40 mcg/kg/day at which AUC0-t was 30-fold the clinical exposure at the proposed commercial dose. 
In  the  rat  carcinogenicity  study  the  incidence  of  ovarian  cysts  was  increased  at  all  doses.  These 
ovarian  changes  are  considered  to  be  rodent-specific  and  are  of  no  relevance  to  humans  because  a 
similar beta2 related mechanism for cyst formation had not been identified over many patient years of 
clinical  use  with  other  beta2  agonists.  These  changes  were  not  seen  in  dogs  receiving  GW642444  at 
doses of up to 510 mcg/kg/day for 39 weeks. 
The benign neoplastic changes in the mammary glands (mammary adenoma; lobular hyperplasia with 
atypia)  of  rats  dosed  for  26  weeks  were  restricted  to  2/18  animals  at  2670  mcg/kg/day  where  the 
mean exposure was >1000 times higher than in humans at the proposed commercial dose. GW642444 
is not genotoxic and the NOAEL for this finding (537 mcg/kg/day) was 135 times greater than that in 
humans  at  the  proposed  commercial  dose  and  therefore  indicates  no  clinical  concern.  There  were  no 
GW642444-related  mammary  findings  in  the  carcinogenicity  study  in  rats  in  which  doses  up  to  657 
mcg/kg/day were administered for up to 104 weeks.

In relation to the toxicity of α-phenylcinnamate salt of GW642444, this salt showed similar significant 
safety  findings  to  the  triphenylacetate  salt  of  GW642444.  However,  there  were  safety  findings  seen 
only  with  the  triphenylacetate  salt  of  GW642444,  such  as  the  observed  changes  in  haematologic  and 
biochemistry  parameters.  The  comparison  of  toxicity  profile  of  both  salts  of  GW642444  could  have 
been clearer in one comparative study which includes the two salts. 
In relation to magnesium stearate toxicity alone, in repeat dose studies of up to 26 weeks duration in 
the  rat  and  4  weeks  duration  in  the dog  with  this  compound  has  demonstrated  little to  no  toxicity  of 
clinical  relevance.  Deposited  lung  doses  of  magnesium  stearate  at  the  NOAEL  in  rats  (1648 
mcg/kg/day  for  26  weeks)  or  dogs  (5820  mcg/kg/day  for  4  weeks)  were  210  or  1016-fold, 
respectively,  the  deposited  lung  dose  in  humans  given  an  inhaled  formulation  containing  130  mcg 
magnesium stearate.  
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
The repeat dose toxicity of the combination of GW685698 and GW642444 was adequately assessed up 
to  a  maximum  of  13  weeks  duration  in  rats  and  dogs.  These  studies  were  performed  due  to 
consideration for the pharmacokinetic profile of the compounds alone. In the 13 week studies with the 
combination of GW685698 and GW642444, the high doses used in both species were selected on the 
basis of the maximum tolerated dose of GW685698 (up to 56 mcg/kg/day in rats and 60 mcg/kg/day 
in dogs) and the dose of GW642444 was selected to achieve ratios appropriate for clinical development 
(up to 28 mcg/kg/day in rats and 30 mcg/kg/day in dogs at maximum 50% of GW685698 dose). The 
systemic exposures to GW685698 (AUC0-t) achieved at these doses were similar to, or small multiples 
of,  those  achieved  in  humans  at  the  proposed  commercial  dose  of  200  mcg/day  (less  than  3-fold  in 
rats; less than 6-fold in dogs). Since lower doses of GW642444 were used for the combination studies 
than  for  studies  investigating  GW642444  alone,  the  exposures  achieved  compared  with  those  in 
humans at the proposed commercial dose of 25 mcg/day were less than those examined in the studies 
with GW642444 alone (up to 13-fold in rats; up to 130-fold in dogs). 
The  general  toxicity  profile  for  GW685698  and  GW642444  in  combination  was  dominated  by  the 
pharmacology-related effects of the corticosteroid GW685698. The combined inhaled administration of 
GW685698  and  GW642444  to  rats  and  dogs  did  not  reveal  any  new  toxicities  from  those  seen  when 
the  test  articles  were  administered  alone,  except  for  the  following:  a  further  increase  of  mammary 
gland  secretion  in  the  rat  given  high  doses  of  GW685698  in  combination  with  GW642444  compared 
with  GW685698  alone,  change  in  glycogen  redistribution  was  higher  in  animals  treated  with  the 
highest  combination  dose  of  both  GW685698  and  GW642444  compared  with  those  dogs  given 
GW642444  alone,  and  an  increase  of  aggregates  of  foamy  alveolar  macrophages  was  present  in  rats 
exposed to GW685698 alone or in combination with GW642444.

GW642444  (as  the  α-phenyl  cinnamate  salt)  was  not  mutagenic  in  a  bacterial  mutagenicity  assay  at 
concentrations up to ≥1500 mcg/plate, as well as  did not induce morphological transformation in the 
Syrian hamster embryo cell transformation assay up to 32.5 mcg/mL (limited by cytotoxicity) and was 
not  genotoxic  in  vivo  in  either  the  rat  micronucleus  assay  or  the  unscheduled  DNA  synthesis  assay 
using  rat  hepatocytes  at  maximum  tolerated  intravenous  doses  that  produced  plasma  concentrations 
>20000  times  (Cmax)  higher  than  those  seen  in  humans.  However,  although  GW642444  (as  the  α-
phenyl cinnamate salt) was not genotoxic in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay in the absence of S9-
mix at concentrations up to 30 and 8 mcg/mL, GW642444 (as the α-phenyl cinnamate salt) did induce 
an  equivocal,  non-reproducible  response  in  the  presence  of  S9-mix  at  highly cytotoxic  concentrations 
(≤20% Relative Total Growth). The weight of evidence from the all data indicates that GW642444 (as 
the  α-phenyl  cinnamate  salt)  does  not  represent  a  genotoxic  hazard  to  humans.  On  the  other  hand, 
GI179710 did  not  cause  gene  mutation  in  a  bacterial  mutagenicity  test  or  chromosomal  damage  in  a 
mammalian in vitro assay. The concentrations of GI179710 tested alone represent considerably higher 
levels  than  would  have  been  achieved  if  tested  as  part  of  GW642444  (as  the  triphenylacetate  salt). 
Since  both  GW642444  (parent)  and  GI179710  (triphenylacetic  acid)  were  not  genotoxic,  it  is 
acceptable  that  the  commercial  compound  GW642444M  (the  triphenylacetate  salt  of  GW642444)  is 
considered not to represent a genotoxic hazard to humans. 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
No  genotoxicity  studies  have  been  performed  for  the  combination  fluticasone furoate/vilanterol  which 
is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Carcinogenicity 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Mouse carcinogenicity study 
The  carcinogenic  potential  of  GW685698  was  assessed  in  a  2  year  inhalation  repeat  dose  study  in 
which  groups  of  mice  (60/sex/group)  were  administered  estimated  achieved  doses  of  0  (vehicle,  2 
groups), 2.2, 6.1, 18.8 mcg/kg/day in lactose once daily, for 1 hour/day. 
There  was  no  evidence  of  an  effect  of  treatment  on  mortality  rates.    Unscheduled  deaths  were 
comparable across all groups at week 78 and at week 104 the percentage survival was greater than or 
equal to 30% across all groups.

A treatment related increased incidence of hairloss, chiefly on the head/nasal region, was recorded for 
animals at all doses. Hairloss in the nasal region together with scabs and depressions in a few animals, 
were  also  seen  macroscopically  at  termination.  Microscopically  in  the  skin  there  was  an  increased 
incidence of inflammatory changes (epidermal ulceration/hyperplasia, dermal fibrosis and scabs) at all 
doses.  Reduced  body  weight  gain  was  seen  at  6.09  and  18.8  mcg/kg/day,  and  minor  changes  in 
haematology  (reduced  lymphocytes  in  males  (all  doses)  and  increased  platelets  in  females  (18.8 
mcg/kg/day)  and  clinical  chemistry  parameters  (lower  urea  and  higher  total  protein  levels)  were 
observed in week 104.  Microscopic pathological findings in the lymphoid tissues and stomach together 
with  inflammatory  changes  in  the  respiratory  tract  were  seen  at  all  doses.  In  the  lungs  there  was  a 
reduction in the amount of BALT in males and females in all treated groups. The severity of the change 
showed  a  clear  relationship  to  dose.  In  the  nasal  turbinates  there  was  a  reduction  in  the  amount  of 
NALT  in  intermediate  and  high  dose  males  and  in  females  from  all  treated  groups.  There  was  also  a 
reduced incidence of epithelial eosinophilic inclusions in the nasal cavity in males and females from all 
treated  groups.  In  the  stomach  there  was  dose-related  increase  in  the  incidence  and  severity  of 
connective  tissue  hyalinisation  in  the  stomach  of  males  and  females  at  all  doses.  This  is  considered 
likely to be a local effect on the mucosa since a high proportion of the inhaled dose is swallowed. The 
severity was minimal or slight in the majority of animals, there was no glandular degeneration, and the 
epithelium  retained  normal  functional  appearance.  These  findings  are  considered  to  be  related  to  the 
pharmacological action of this class of compound. 
Treatment  with  GW685698  did  not  increase  the  incidence  of  any  neoplastic  finding.  However,  the 
overall  incidence  of  malignant  lymphoma  was  decreased  in  high  dose  females.  There  was  a  slight 
increase  in  the  incidence  of  bronchioloalveolar  epithelial  hyperplasia,  and  of  bronchioloalveolar 
adenoma  in  the  lungs  of  males  receiving  6.1  mcg/kg/day,  compared  with  concurrent  controls.  This 
increase  was  also  present  when  the  total  number of  bronchioloalveolar  adenoma  per  dose  group  was 
examined  indicating  that  in  this  group  there  was  a  higher  number  of  animals  with  more  than  one 
tumour.  However  the  increased  incidence  of  bronchioloalveolar  adenoma  was  considered  to  be 
fortuitous given that the incidence of the adenomas was not dose dependent (i.e. absent on the high 
dose group), a low incidence was seen in  females at the same dose and a comparable incidence was 
observed in historical controls for this tumour type (see table below).

Toxicokinetic  analysis  revealed  systemic  exposure  to  GW685698  was  demonstrated  in  each  of  the 
dosed  groups.  There  were  insufficient  data,  however,  to  determine  an  AUC  in  the  mice  that  received 
the  lowest  dose  (2.2  mcg/kg/day).  Tmax  was  at  the  first  sampling  occasion,  nominally  65  minutes 
after  the  start  of  dosing.  There  was  an  approximately  proportional  increase  in  systemic  exposure  (as 
assessed  by  DNAUC0-t)  to  GW685698  with  increasing  dose  in  the  mice  with  approximately  a  3-fold 
increase in DNAUC0-t for a 3-fold increase in dose between 6.1 and 18.8 mcg/kg/day. There were no 
notable differences in the plasma concentrations of GW685698 between the sexes over the entire dose 
range.  At  18.8  mcg/kg/day  AUC0-t  was  677  pg.h/mL  and  Cmax  was  353  pg/mL  at  Week  39  (data 
combined for males and females). 
Rat carcinogenicity study 
The carcinogenic potential of GW685698 was assessed in a 2 year inhalation repeat dose study in which 
groups  of  rats  (60/sex/group)  were  administered  estimated  achieved  doses  of  0  (vehicle,  2  groups), 
1.0, 3.2, 8.6 mcg/kg/day in lactose once daily (1 hour/day). 
Survival in male rats was unaffected by treatment with GW685698X. However, in females there was a 
treatment-related reduction in survival at 3.19 and 8.61 mcg/kg/day during the final 13 weeks of the 
study  although  there  were  no  associated  histopathological  changes.  A  treatment  related  degree  of 
hairloss,  chiefly  located  on  the  head/nasal  region,  was  recorded  for  intermediate  and  high  dose 
animals.    Minor  changes  in  haematology  (significantly  reduced  total  white  cells,  lymphocytes, 
eosinophils,  basophils  and  monocytes)  and  clinical  chemistry  parameters  (higher  potassium  levels  in 
males and biliribin levels in females) occurred at 8.61 mcg/kg/day.

Treatment  with  GW685698  did  not  increase  the  incidence  of  any  neoplastic  finding  for  any  group  of 
animals.  However,  there  were  decreased  incidences  of  haemangioma  and  lymphangioma  in  the 
mesenteric  lymph  node  and  of  thymoma  (lymphoid)  in  animals  receiving  8.6  mcg/kg/day.  The 
incidence of focal endothelial hyperplasia in the mesenteric lymph node was also reduced in this group. 
Microscopic  pathological  findings  in  the  lymphoid  tissues  together  with  changes  in  inflammatory 
responses  in  the  respiratory  tract  were  seen  at  all  doses.    In  the  nasal  turbinates  a  decreased 
cellularity  of  the  NALT  was  accompanied  by  a  decreased  incidence  and/or  degree  of  eosinophilic 
inclusions  in  the  olfactory  epithelium  at  all  doses.  However,  in  the  lungs,  decreased  cellularity  of  the 
BALT  was  accompanied  by  a  minimal  increase  in  the  incidence  of  eosinophilic  inclusions  in  the 
bronchiolar epithelium at all doses. This latter finding was consistent with similar observations after 13 
and  26  weeks  treatment  demonstrating  a  lack  of  progression  despite  lifetime  administration;  the 
content  of  the  inclusions  was  identified  as  Surfactant  Protein-D.  Furthermore,  the  incidence  of 
inflammatory  cells  or  inflammation  was  reduced  at  all  doses  in  the  lamina  propria  of  the  respiratory 
epithelium of the nasal cavity, the nasopharynx, trachea, tracheal bifurcation at the point of bifurcation 
and in the adjacent trachea and bronchi at 3.2 and 8.6 mcg/kg/day, and in the nasal turbinates, lungs 
and lamina propria of the larynx at 8.6 mcg/kg/day. Other changes included an increased incidence of 
pigmented  macrophages  in  the  lamina  propria  of  the  larynx  at  all  doses,  alveolar  pigmented 
macrophages (females only) and perivascular/peribronchiolar pigmented macrophages in the lung, and 
decreased incidence of foamy macrophages in the lung at 3.2 and 8.6 mcg/kg/day. At all doses there 
was  an  increased  incidence  of  dilated  vaginations  from  the  ventral  pouch  of  the  larynx  and  an 
increased  incidence  of  mastocytosis  in  the  mesenteric  lymph  node.  At  8.6  mcg/kg/day  there  was  an 
increased  incidence  of  dilated  glands  in  the  trachea  (males  only).  The  lung  changes  were  associated 
with a decreased incidence of pale lungs observed macroscopically at the terminal kill. 
GW685698  was  only  quantificable  at  the  highest  dose  level  (8.6  mcg/kg/day).  Systemic  exposure  to 
GW685698 (as assessed by AUC0-t and Cmax) was similar in both Weeks 45 and 58 and in males and 
females.  At  8.16  mcg/kg/day  overall  AUC0-t  was  0.320  ng.h/mL  and  Cmax  was  0.122  ng/mL  (data 
combined for males and females at Weeks 45 and 58). 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Mouse carcinogenicity study 
The carcinogenic potential of GW64244 was assessed in a 2 year inhalation repeat dose study in which 
groups of mice (60/sex/group) were administered estimated achieved doses of 0 (vehicle, 2 groups), 
1.0,  3.2,  8.6  mcg/kg/day  in  lactose  once  daily  (1  hour/day).    The  original  design  required  60  main 
study  animals/sex/group  and  66  toxicokinetic  animals/sex/group.  Due  to  the  high  mortality  that 
occurred  across  all  groups  during  the  first  few  months  of  the  study,  when  compared  with  historical 
control  data,  24  toxicokinetic  animals/sex/group  were  reassigned  as  main  study  animals;  these 
animals had not previously been subject to any blood sampling. All data related to these animals have 
been  combined  with  the  main  study  animals  and  is  reported  together.  The  total  group  size  was 
therefore 84 animals/sex/group in the main study and 42 animals/sex/group in the toxicokinetic study.

High  mortality  occurred  across  all  groups  when  compared  with  historical  control  data  due  to  swollen 
abdomen which was believed to be associated with the design of the restraint tube, possibly leading to 
air  swallowing.    As  a  result  the  tube  end  caps  were  changed  on  several  occasions  during  the  study, 
following  which  there  was  a  marked  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  swollen  abdomen.    Despite  these 
mortalities, a sufficient number of animals survived to the end of the study to assess the carcinogenic 
potential of GW642444. 
The most common cause of death in both sexes was gaseous distension of the GIT (see above). Other 
common  causes  of  death  included  lymphoreticular  neoplasms  (both  sexes),  urogenital  tract 
infection/obstruction  (primarily  in  males)  and  skin  ulceration/infection,  including  pododermatitis  and 
tail  infection  (both  sexes).  All  conditions  occurred  in  control  and  treated  groups,  and  showed  no 
evidence of a dose-response or clear association with GW642444 administration.  
Administration  of  GW642444  was  associated  with  test  article-related  neoplastic  and  non-neoplastic 
proliferative changes in the ovaries and uterus and non-neoplastic changes in the ovaries, uterus and 
vagina  of  females  and  in  the  nasal  cavity  of  both  sexes.  In  the  ovary,  an  increased  incidence  of  sex 
cord  stromal  hypertrophy/hyperplasia  was  seen  at  all  doses  and  an  increased  incidence  of 
tubulostromal hyperplasia, sex cord tumors and ovarian cysts (and ovarian compression due to cysts) 
at  ≥62  mcg/kg/day.  An  increased  incidence  of  tubulostromal  adenomas  was  seen  at  29500 
mcg/kg/day. In the uterus, an increased incidence and severity of cystic endometrial hyperplasia was 
seen  at  all  doses,  accompanied  by  endometrial  glandular  squamous  metaplasia  in  a  few  females  at 
6150  or  29500  mcg/kg/day.  Myometrial  hypertrophy/hyperplasia  and  an  increased  incidence  of 
leiomyoma  and/or  leiomyosarcoma  were  seen  at  ≥62  mcg/kg/day.  In  the  vagina,  a  slight  increased 
incidence of anestrus appearance (with/without mucin) was seen in at all doses. In the nasal cavity, an 
increased incidence and/or severity of luminal inflammatory cells/cell debris was seen in females at all 
doses  and  olfactory  degenerative  changes  were  seen  in  both  sexes  at  ≥62  mcg/kg/day.  The  findings 
were minimal or slight in severity at doses up to 615 mcg/kg/day, but were more notably increased in 
incidence and severity in both sexes given ≥6150 mcg/kg/day. 
GW642444  systemic  exposure  (AUC0-t)  to  male  and  female  mice  based  on  combined  values  from 
Weeks  4  and  26  were  7.93,  34.9,  135,  920  and  3591  ng.h/mL  at  6.4,  62,  615,  6150  or  29500 
mcg/kg/day,  respectively.  Following  treatment  with  GW642666  systemic  exposure  was  also 
demonstrated  to  GI17910  (counterion)  and  GSK932009  and  GW630200  (the  major  human 
metabolites). 
Rat carcinogenicity study 
GW642444 was given to Sprague Dawley rats (60/sex/group) at estimated achieved doses of 0, 10.5, 
84.4, 223 and 657 mcg/kg/day for 60 minutes once daily for 85 weeks by nose-only inhalation. Due to 
increased  mortality  dosing  was  stopped  for  females  given  223  and  657  mcg/kg/day  at  Week  85  (26 
and  23  animals  surviving  in  these  groups,  respectively).  These  females  remained  on  study  without 
further treatment until group survival fell to 15 (Weeks 95 or 96, respectively) at which time they were 
electively killed. The doses of the remaining females were reduced from Week 86 to 3.47 (from 10.5) 
and 28.2 (from 84.4) mcg/kg/day by decreasing the daily exposure duration from 60 to 20 minutes for 
the  remainder  of  the  study.  Females  at  84.4/28.2  mcg/kg/day  were  terminated  in  Week  95  due  to 
survival  reaching  15.  Control  females  and  females  given  10.5/3.47  mcg/kg/day  were  killed  in  Week 
104.  All  males  were  electively  killed  in  Week  101  when  the  number  of  survivors  in  the  control  group 
fell to less than 20.

Early mortality associated with pituitary neoplasms was observed in male rats given ≥223 mcg/kg/day 
GW642444 and females given ≥84.4/28.2 mcg/kg/day. In both sexes this finding was proposed to be 
the  result  of  pharmacologically-mediated  increased body  weight  gain  in  the  early  stages  of  the  study 
and  increased  food  consumption.  In  females  hormonal  imbalance  resulting  from  pharmacologically-
mediated,  dose  related,  increase  incidence  and  severity  (size)  of  ovarian  follicular  cysts  may  have 
contributed to the reduced latency of the pituitary findings. 
An  increased  incidence  of  mesovarian  smooth  muscle  hyperplasia/hypertrophy  and  of  mesovarian 
leiomyomata  was  seen  in  females  given  ≥84.4/28.2  mcg/kg/day.  The  findings  were  present  in 
decedent females and those surviving to terminal kill and are considered a consequence of prolonged 
β2-adrenergic stimulation.   
GW642444 systemic exposure (AUC0-t) to male rats based on combined values from Weeks 4 and 26 
were  0.420,  8.52,  16.9  and  51.8  ng.h/mL  at  10.5,  84.4,  223  and  657  mcg/kg/day,  respectively.

Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
The fixed dose combination of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol contains two compounds assessed as non 
carcinogenic.  The  carcinogenic  potential  is  thus  fully  assessed.  Hence  other  studies  assessing 
carcinogenic potential with the combination are not needed in accordance with the requirements of the 
“Guideline  on  the  Non-Clinical  Development  of  Fixed  Combinations  of  Medicinal  Products

Female fertility, early embryonic and embryofetal development 
GW685698 or vehicle (lactose) was administered by inhalation, once a day for 1 hour, to groups of 22 
female  Wistar  Han  rats  at  estimated  achieved  doses  of  0,  11,  23  and  91  mcg/kg/day  from  2  weeks 
prior to mating until gestation Day 17. 
Animals  receiving  91  mcg/kg/day  showed  overall  body  weight  loss  during  the  first  week  of  dosing 
followed by a period of lower body weight gain persisting into the first half of the gestation period. This 
was coupled with slightly reduced food consumption. 
There  were  no  clinical  signs,  macroscopic  findings,  adverse  effects  upon  mating  performance,  pre-
coital  interval  or  fertility  related  to  treatment  with  GW685698.  A  slightly  higher  incidence  of  longer 
oestrus cycles (4 or 5 days) was observed in animals at 91 mcg/kg/day. No major skeletal or visceral 
abnormalities were noted in the foetuses from females at any dose. However, lower fetal weight (5%) 
and related increased incidence of fetuses with incompletely ossified sternebrae were noted in females 
exposed  to  91  mcg/kg/day.  Owing  to  these  effects,  the  NOAEL  for  fertility,  early  embryonic  and 
embryofoetal development in the rat was considered to be 23 mcg/kg/day. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Rat 
Male fertility  
GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was administered as a dry powder formulation 
to male Sprague Dawley rats (25/group) at estimated achieved doses of 0 (vehicle), 62, 824 or 31508 
mcg/kg/day (4 or 40% w/w blend in lactose) once daily for 60 minutes by nose only inhalation for 54 
to  57  days.  After  14  days  of  treatment,  treated  males  were  co-habited  1:1  with  untreated  females. 
Mated females were separated from the males and considered to be on Day 0 post coitum (pc). Mated 
females and their litters were euthanized on Day 20 pc. 
Paternal effects were evidenced at 824 and 31508 mcg/kg/day by increased body weight gain and post 
dosing  clinical  signs  (salivation,  periorbital  fur  staining  and/or  wetness  of  the  muzzle  and  lower  jaw 
associated  with  salivation).  Mating,  fertility  and  conception  rate  were  unaffected.  Slight  organ  weight 
differences  in  epididymis  ventral  prostate  and  seminal  vesicles  at  824  and  31508  mcg/kg/day  were 
inconsequential to mating or fertility and therefore not considered adverse effects. The NOAEL for male 
fertility was considered to be ≥31508 mcg/kg/day. 
Female fertility and early embryonic development 
The effects of GW642444 on mating and fertility and on early embryonic development to implantation 
were  assessed  in  a  study  in  Sprague  Dawley  rats.  GW642444  (as  the  triphenylacetate  salt, 
GW642444M)  was  administered  as  a  dry  powder  formulation  to  mated  females  (25/group)  at 
estimated achieved doses of 0 (vehicle), 49.4 or 664 mcg/kg/day (as a 4% blend in lactose) or 37112 
mcg/kg/day  (as  a  40%  blend  in  lactose)  via  snout  only  inhalation  (1  hour)  for  15  days  before  co-
habitation,  during  co-habitation  with  untreated  males  (1  to  12  days)  and  on  Days  0  to  6  pc.  Mated 
females and their litters were euthanized on Day 20 pc. 
Evidence  of  maternal  effects  was  noted  at  ≥49.4  mcg/kg/day  as  indicated  by  increased  body  weight 
and  body  weight  gains.  There  was  no  evidence  of  an  adverse  effect  on  female  fertility  or  early 
embryonic  development.  Based  on  these  results,  the  NOAEL  for  effects  on  female  fertility  and  early 
embryonic development in this study was considered to be ≥37112 mcg/kg/day.

Rabbit 
Preliminary & definitive embryofoetal development study  
A  preliminary  study  was  conducted  to  evaluate  the  toxicity  of  GW685698  when  administered  by 
inhalation to pregnant New Zealand white rabbits. This provided sufficient information to select doses 
for  a  subsequent  definitive  embryofoetal  development  study  in  the  rabbit.    In  the  preliminary  study, 
groups of 6 female New Zealand white rabbits were treated, from gestation day 8 to 20, with vehicle 
(lactose) or GW685698. Animals were exposed once a day for 1 hour at estimated achieved doses of 
9.7, 46.6 and 85.1 mcg/kg/day. 
Dose-related  reductions  in  maternal  body  weight  gain  were  evident  at  all  dose  levels  together  with  a 
reduction  in  food  consumption  at  9.7  and  46.6  mcg/kg/day.  There  were  no  clinical  signs  related  to 
treatment  with  GW685698.    All  rabbits  at  85.1  mcg/kg/day  and  2  of  6  females  at  46.6  mcg/kg/day 
were  terminated  between  gestation  day  19  and  23  following  abortion  of  their  fetuses.  Post-
implantation  losses  were  increased  and  litter  weights  reduced  in  all  GW685698  treated  groups.  Mean 
foetal weights were also lower in animals treated at 46.6 mcg/kg/day. Due to the effects on maternal 
and  fetal  body  weight,  a  targeted  high  dose  of  10  mcg/kg/day  was  considered  suitable  for  a 
subsequent definitive study. 
In the definitive study, GW685698 or vehicle (lactose) was administered (1 hour/day) by inhalation to 
groups  of  22  female  New  Zealand  white  rabbits  from  gestation  Day  8  to  20  at  estimated  achieved 
doses of 1.8, 3.2 and 8.1 mcg/kg/day. 
A  transient  loss  in  body  weight  was  noted  in  all  GW685698  treated  groups  over  the  first  4  days  of 
treatment,  thereafter,  weight  gain  was  comparable  to  controls.  There  were  no  treatment  related 
effects on food consumption or clinical signs. 
There were also no treatment related effects on corpora lutea, implantation count, placental or foetal 
weight.  An  increased  incidence  of  incompletely  ossified  sternebrae  and  metacarpals/phalanges  was 
seen in foetuses from animals treated at 3.2 or 8.1 mcg/kg/day. However, since there was a greater 
incidence at 3.2 mcg/kg/day than 8.1 mcg/kg/day and there was no associated effect on fetal weight, 
this finding is considered to be unrelated to treatment.  A NOAEL of 8.1 mcg/kg/day was ascribed for 
embryofoetal development in the rabbit.

Rat 
Embryofetal development studies (Report CD2006/01166/01): 
GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was administered as a dry powder formulation 
to mated female Sprague Dawley rats (22/group) at estimated achieved doses of 0 (vehicle), 45.4 or 
613  mcg/kg/day  (as  a  4%  blend  in  lactose)  or  33733  mcg/kg/day  (as  a  40%  blend  in  lactose)  via 
snout only inhalation (1 hour) on Days 6 to 17 pc. Mated females and their litters were euthanized on 
Day 21 pc. 
Maternal effects at ≥613 mcg/kg/day was evidenced by substantially increased body weight gains and 
increased  or  decreased  food  consumption.  There  was  no  evidence  of  an  adverse  effect  on  pregnancy 
(numbers of corpora lutea, implantation sites, live fetuses and dead fetuses, resorptions, sex ratio, and 
the  pre  and  post  implantation  losses)  or  on  embryofetal  development  (no  major  malformations  nor 
minor  external,  visceral  or  skeletal  anomalies).  Based  on  these  results,  the  developmental  NOAEL  on 
this study was considered to be >33733 mcg/kg/day. 
Rabbit 
Dose ranging and pivotal inhalation embryofetal development studies  
A study was performed to establish tolerated doses in the non-pregnant rabbit, to assess the effects on 
progress and outcome of pregnancy in rabbits, and to establish suitable doses for a main embryo-fetal 
development study. GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was administered as a dry 
powder  formulation  (40% (w/w)  blend  in  lactose)  to  groups  of  non-pregnant  (4/group)  and  pregnant 
(5/group)  New  Zealand  white  rabbits,  at  estimated achieved  doses  of  447,  1350,  5120,  19600  (non-
pregnant) and 0, 5330 and 18800 mcg/kg/day (pregnant), via snout only inhalation (1 hour) for up to 
13 days which in the pregnant animals was from Days 7 to 19 pc. 
Treatment  with  GW642444  at  doses  up  to  19600  mcg/kg/day  was  well  tolerated  by  unmated  female 
rabbits following snout-only inhalation administration for 1 hour per day for up to 13 days. Treatment 
of  pregnant  female  rabbits  from  Days  7  to  19  pc  at  5330  or  18800  mcg/kg/day  was  associated  with 
lower  group  mean  food  consumption  during  the  first  2  days  of  treatment  (Days  7  to  8  pc). 
Unacceptable levels of intrauterine deaths were noted at 18800 mcg/kg/day. Open eyelid was evident 
in  fetuses  at  5330  and  18800  mcg/kg/day,  limb,  snout  and  palate  malformations  were  also  noted  at 
18800 mcg/kg/day. 
Toxicokinetic  evaluation  on  Day  5  of  treatment  (Day  11  post  coitum)  at  5330  mcg/kg/day  revealed 
study exposure normalised AUC0-t of 244 ng.h/mL and Cmax of 110 ng/mL  
In the main pivotal study, GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was administered as 
a dry powder formulation (7% (w/w) blend in lactose) to mated New Zealand white rabbits (22/group) 
at estimated achieved doses of 0 (vehicle), 62.7, 591 and 5740 mcg/kg/day via snout only inhalation 
(1 hour) from Days 7 to 19 pc. Pregnant rabbits and their litters were killed on Day 29 pc.

Mean fetal weight was low at 5740 mcg/kg/day. GW642444 at 5740 mcg/kg/day caused open/partially 
open eyelids/punctate opening, cleft palate and forelimb flexure/malrotation. Also, at 62.7 mcg/kg/day 
there were open/partially open eyelids/punctuate opening and cleft palate. A dose relationship was not 
established (these abnormalities were not found at 591 mcg/kg/day), suggesting the aetiology of the 
findings  at  the  low  dose may  be  multifactoral  (test  article  and other  factors).  In  addition,  there  were 
higher incidences of fetuses/litters with bridges of ossification/partially fused/fused sternebral centres, 
small  misshapen  interparietals,  enlarged  anterior/posterior  fontanelle,  incomplete  ossification  of  the 
5th  sternebrae,  epiphyses  and  metacarpals/phalanges  and  an  associated  costal  cartilage  abnormality 
in the 5740 mcg/kg/day group compared with controls, which may reflect the lower mean fetal weight 
in this group.  A clear developmental no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) for GW642444M was 
not  identified  in  this  study.  The  exposure  (normalised  AUC  and  Cmax)  at  the  lowest  dose  of  62.7 
mcg/kg/day were 3.76 ng.h/mL and 2.07 ng/mL, respectively. 
Dose ranging and pivotal subcutaneous embryofetal development studies  
Subcutaneous studies were conducted in the rabbit in order to determine whether the low incidence of 
developmental effects observed following inhalation administration of GW642444 could be reproduced.  
In  a  dose  range  finding  study,  GW642444  (as  the  triphenylacetate  salt,  GW642444M)  was 
administered  at  doses of 20,  200  and 2000  mcg/kg/day,  via  subcutaneous  injection  (formulated  as a 
solution in 20/80 PEG400/8% 2HPBC), to pregnant New Zealand white rabbits (4/group) from Day 7 to 
11 pc. Mated females and their litters were euthanized on Day 12 pc. GW642444 produced no effects 
on  clinical  signs,  body  weight  or  food  consumption  and  all  animals  were  pregnant  at  scheduled 
euthanasia.  At  the  highest  tolerated  dose  of  2000  mcg/kg/day  AUC0-t  and  Cmax  values  were  2160 
mcg.h/mL and 408 mcg/mL, respectively, for GW642444. 
In the main pivotal study, GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was administered to 
pregnant  New  Zealand  white  rabbits  (22/group)  at  doses  of  0  (vehicle  alone),  3,  7,  30  or  300 
mcg/kg/day, via subcutaneous injection (formulated as a solution in 20/80 PEG400/8% 2HPBC), from 
Days 7 to 19 pc. Mated females and their litters were euthanized on Day 29 pc. 
Maternal  body  weights  were  increased  at  30  and  300  mcg/kg/day,  while  food  consumption  was 
decreased  at  300  mcg/kg/day  at  the  end  of  the  drug  treatment  period.  Fetal  body  weights  were 
reduced  at  300  mcg/kg/day  and  fetal  skeletal  variations  (less  than  the  expected  number  of  ossified 
forepaw metacarpals, talus bone not ossified, and cervical vertebral centrum not ossified) indicative of 
developmental delay were also observed at this dose level. Open eye, a malformation, observed in one 
fetus at 300 mcg/kg/day  was considered treatment-related since it was observed at a similar plasma 
exposure  in  another  study  when  GW642444  was  administered  by  inhalation,  and  it  is  a  common 
finding in rabbit fetuses when β2-agonists are administered to does by inhalation administration. The 
NOAEL  for  embryofetal  development  in  rabbits  was  therefore  30  mcg/kg/day  based  upon  the 
decreased fetal weights, fetal skeletal variations indicative of developmental delay and the observation 
of  open  eye  at  300  mcg/kg/day.  The  AUC0-t  values  at  30  mcg/kg/day  for  GW642444  and  its 
counterion  GI179710  (triphenylacetate)  were  22.4  and  18.4  ng.h/mL,  respectively,  and  the  Cmax 
values for these 2 analytes were 6.26 and 12.4 ng/mL, respectively.

Rat 
Embryofetal developmental study  
GW685698 and GW642444 were administered to mated Sprague Dawley female rats (n=22/group) at 
estimated achieved doses of 0 (vehicle alone), 82.0 mcg/kg/day (GW685698 alone), 86.9 mcg/kg/day 
(GW642444  alone),  or  in  combination  at  7.9/8.3,  29.5/31.7,  94.4/3.5  or  94.9/98.3  mcg/kg, 
GW685698/GW642444  respectively  by  nose  only  inhalation  (1  hour  duration)  on  days  6  to  17  post 
coitum  (pc).  The  vehicle  was  lactose  blended  with  1%  (w/w)  magnesium  stearate.  Formulations 
contained  GW685698  (0.3  to  3%)  and  /  or  GW642444  (0.1  to  3%)  blended  with  vehicle  and 
administered as a dry powder. 
Evidence of maternal effects was noted in groups administered estimated achieved doses of 82 to 94.9 
mcg/kg/day  GW685698,  either  alone  or  in  combination  with  GW642444  (82.0/0,  94.4/3.5  and 
94.9/98.3  mcg/kg/day  GW685698/GW642444),  as  indicated  by  lower  body  weights  and  food 
consumption 
compared 
to 
controls. 
Females 
administered 
29.5/31.7  mcg/kg/day 
GW685698/GW642444  also  showed  lower  body  weights.  At  the  maternally  toxic  doses  of  82.0/0, 
94.4/3.5 and 94.9/98.3 mcg/kg/day GW685698/GW642444, there was fetal growth retardation, but no 
other developmental toxicity was noted. The addition of GW642444 had no apparent influence on the 
maternal  and  fetal  effects  attributed to the  administration  of  GW685698.  Based  on  these  results,  the 
No  Observed  Adverse  Effect  Level  (NOAEL)  for  embryofetal  development  on  this  study  for  the 
combination was considered to be 29.5/31.7 mcg/kg/day GW685698/GW642444.

Pre- and post-natal development study 
To  investigate  potential  effects  on  pregnancy,  parturition  and  lactation,  and  on  pre-  and  post-natal 
survival,  growth,  development,  and  reproductive  performance  of  offspring,  GW685698  or  vehicle 
(lactose) was administered by inhalation to groups of 22 or 23 female Wistar Han rats from gestation 
day 6 to 20 and Days 2 to at least Day 21 post partum. Animals were exposed once daily for 1 hour at 
estimated  achieved  doses  of  0,  5.5,  15.7  and  27.2  mcg/kg/day.  The  female  F0  generation  were 
allowed  to  deliver  naturally.  At  84  days  post  partum,  the  F1  generation  males  and  females  were 
cohabited in a ratio of 1 to 1 for up to 14 days. Mated F1 females were allowed to deliver naturally and 
they and their litters (F2 generation) were evaluated on Day 7 post partum. 
In the F0 generation, dose dependent reductions in body weight gain were observed in pregnant dams 
given  15.7  or  27.2  mcg/kg/day,  resulting  in  lower  body  weights  compared  to  controls.  At  15.7  and 
27.2 mcg/kg/day, lower food consumption was also evident. The gestation index, length of gestation, 
numbers  of  live  and  dead  pups,  sex  ratio,  and  live  birth  index  were  unaffected  by  treatment  with 
GW685698. 
For the F1 generation pups, viability, survival and lactation indices, clinical condition, pup weights and 
gross  pathology  were  unaffected  by  treatment  of  the  F0  Dams.  Development  of  these  pups  to 
adulthood  was  similarly  unaffected  (including  preputial  separation  and  vaginal  opening).  Behavioural 
performance  (assessed  by  motor  activity,  auditory  startle  habituation  and  water  maze)  was 
comparable to controls.

Following mating of the F1 generation, all measured parameters, including mating index, fertility index 
and  conception  rate,  gestation  index  and  gestation  length,  sex  ratio,  and  numbers  of  live,  dead  and 
malformed pups were comparable to controls. Pup viability and survival indices, clinical condition, pup 
body  weights  and  terminal  examinations  were  also  undisturbed  in  the  F2  generation  compared  to 
controls. 
The NOAEL for developmental (F1/F2) effects was considered to be 27.2 mcg/kg/day.

Pre- and post-natal development study 
GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was given to groups of mated female Sprague 
Dawley  rats  (24/group)  by  oral  gavage  administration  at  doses  of  0  (vehicle),  300,  3000  and  10000 
mcg/kg/day  beginning  on  Day  6  pc  and  continuing  to  Day  20  post  partum  (pp)  as  a  suspension  in 
1.0% w/v aqueous methylcellulose. F0 females were allowed to deliver naturally. Mated (F0) females 
were  euthanized  on  Day  21  pp.  On  Postnatal  Day  (PND)  21,  46  to  48  F1  males  and  46  to  48  F1 
females were assigned to each dose group and assigned to one of two subsets. Subset 1 was selected 
for  PND  77  auditory  startle  habituation  evaluation  and  reproductive  performance.  Mated  F1  females 
assigned to Subset 1 were allowed to deliver naturally and the dams and F2 litters were evaluated until 
Day  7  pp.  Subset  2  was  selected  for  motor  activity,  PND  45  auditory  startle  habituation,  and  Morris 
Watermaze evaluations. F1 offspring assigned to Subset 2 were euthanized after behavior testing was 
completed.  F1  males  assigned  to  Subset  1  were  euthanized  following  completion  of  the  cohabitation 
period,  and  F1  females  assigned  to  Subset  1  were  allowed  to  deliver  naturally,  and  were  then 
euthanized with their litters (F2 offspring) on Day 7 pp. 
Increases in the mean maternal F0 body weight and body weight gains throughout the post coitum and 
post  partum  periods  at  all  dose  levels  with  a  related  increase  in  food  consumption  during  the  post 
coitum period at 10 mg/kg/day and an increase in the average delivery time per pup at 10 mg/kg/day 
were considered to be related to the pharmacology. There were no other adverse effects on maternal 
(F0) pregnancy, parturition, lactation or offspring (F1) survival.   
Pre- and post-weaning body weights were decreased in the 3 and 10 mg/kg/day dose groups without 
any adverse consequences to other measures of growth and development. There were no effects on F1 
neurobehavioral or reproductive function (F1 pregnancy, parturition and lactation) or F2 survival. 
The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal (F0) reproductive function as well as effects 
on pre- and post-natal development of the offspring in rats is 10 mg/kg/day; the highest group tested.

Dermal irritancy  
Two  studies  were  conducted  in  New  Zealand  white  rabbits  to  assess  the  potential  for  GW685698  to 
cause dermal irritation. In one study, 500 mcg of solid test material moistened with 0.5 mL of distilled

GW685698 produced no evidence of irritation in this study.  
In a second experiment, 0.5 mL of a 2 mcg/mL aqueous solution of GW685698, formulated in ethanol 
was applied under an occlusive dressing for 16 hours to the shorn intact skin of 3 male New Zealand 
white rabbits. Following removal of the test material, and observation of the dermis for up to 72 hours, 
there  was  no  evidence  of  erythema  or  oedema.  Using  the  Draize  classification  scheme,  GW685698 
produced a primary irritation index of 0.0, and therefore was classified as a non-irritant to rabbit skin. 
Ocular irritancy  
The potential ocular irritancy of the intranasal clinical formulation of GW685698 (0.05% w/w aqueous 
suspension) was assessed in New Zealand white rabbits in case of accidental exposure during normal 
clinical  use.  A  volume  of  100  mcL  of  undiluted test  formulation  was  administered  as  a  single  dose  to 
three male rabbits. The formulation was placed into the everted lower lid of the right eye. The left eye 
served  as  the  untreated  control.  The  upper  and  lower  lids  were  held  together  for  approximately  1 
second following instillation. Eye irritation was evaluated and scored following the standardised Draize 
scoring technique at approximately 1, 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours after instillation. No residual test article 
was present.  
All animals survived until study termination at 72 hours post-instillation. Mild redness (irritation score 
of 1) of the conjunctivae was present at 1 and 4 hours post-instillation in 2 of 3 rabbits, but this had 
resolved by 24 hours. Corneal injury was evaluated by sodium fluorescein examination at the 24 hour 
observation period. There was no effect on the cornea or iris in any of the treated eyes. 
Intranasal irritancy of different formulations of GW685698  
A  study  was  performed  to  assess  the  intranasal  irritancy  of  two  potential  clinical  formulations  of 
GW685698.  Groups  of  3  beagle  dogs  were  dosed  twice  daily  for  3  consecutive  days.    Each  dose 
consisted of 3x 100 mcL actuations per nostril, with at least 6 hours between doses. One treated group  
received  0.03%  (w/w)  GW685698  formulated  in  5%  (w/w)  Tyloxapol,  0.015%  (w/w)  benzalkonium 
chloride and 0.015% (w/w) disodium EDTA. The other group received  0.05% (w/w) GW685698 in 5% 
(w/w) Triton X-100, 0.015% (w/w) benzalkonium chloride and 0.015% (w/w) disodium EDTA. Control 
animals received 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride.

Twice daily intranasal dosing for 3 consecutive days using the formulation containing GW685698 with 
Triton  X-100  was  not tolerated  and  resulted  in  treatment  related  changes  strongly  indicative of  nasal 
cavity irritancy. Clinical signs noted in this group were, on Day 1, slight and/or moderate snuffling, and 
slight  salivation.  Due  to  distress  seen  during  the  dosing  procedure,  dosing  was  discontinued  for  one 
animal before the end of the treatment period. Microscopic examination revealed a combination of the 
following  changes:  moderate  to  severe  thinning  and  degeneration  of  the  nasal  cavity  squamous 
epithelium,  accompanied  in  one  animal  by  mild  submucosal  inflammation  in  this  squamous  region; 
mild  to  moderate  goblet  cell  hyperplasia  of  the  respiratory  epithelium,  affecting  regions  lined  purely 
with  respiratory  epithelium  and  also  the  more  posterior  regions  lined  by  a  combination  of  respiratory 
and  olfactory  epithelium;  minimal  to  severe  focal  or  multifocal  necrosis  of  the  respiratory  epithelium 
accompanied  by  mild  to  severe  squamous  metaplasia  of  this  epithelium  and  mild  or  moderate 
submucosal inflammation; and/or minimal focal or multifocal erosions with early repair of the olfactory 
epithelium.The  formulation  containing  GW685698  with  Tyloxapol  was  well  tolerated  and  no  changes 
considered to be related to treatment were seen in the nasal cavity. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Dermal irritancy - Local lymph node assay in the mouse 
A study was performed to assess the skin sensitisation potential of the GW642444 in the CBA/Ca strain 
mouse following topical application to the dorsal surface of the ear. Following a preliminary screening 
test,  a  group  of  four  animals  were  treated  with  50  mcL  (25  mcL  per  ear)  of  GW642444  at  a 
concentration of 50% w/w in dimethyl formamide (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) daily for 
3 days. A further group of four animals was treated with dimethyl formamide alone. All animals were 
observed twice daily on Days 1, 2 and 3 and on a daily basis on Days 4, 5 and 6. 
No signs of systemic toxicity or local irritation were noted in the GW642444 treated or control animals 
during  the  test.  Off  white  residual  test  material  on  ears  and  fur  was  noted  in  GW642444  treated 
animals  post  dose  on  Day  1  and  on  Days  2  to  5.  Bodyweight  changes  of  the  GW642444  treated 
animals  between  Day  1  and  Day  6  were  comparable  to  those  observed  in  the  corresponding  control 
group  animals  over  the  same  period.  GW642444  was  considered  to  be  a  non-sensitiser  under  the 
conditions of the test. 
Dermal  irritancy  -  GW642444:  determination  of  skin  irritation  potential  using  the  skinethic 
reconstituted human epidermal model  
A study was performed to determine the skin irritation potential of GW642444 (as the  triphenylacetate 
salt,  GW642444M)  using  the  SkinEthic  Reconstituted  Human  Epidermalmodel  (RHE,  SkinEthic 
Laboratories,  Nice,  France)  following  treatment  periods  of  4  and  24  hours.  The  test  is  based  on  the 
hypothesis  that  irritant  chemicals  are  able  to  penetrate  the  stratum  corneum  of  the  SkinEthic  RHE 
model and are sufficiently cytotoxic to cause cell death in the underlying cell layers. Triplicate SkinEthic 
tissues were treated with 25 mg of GW642444 and exposed for 4 hours and 24 hours. A prediction of 
skin irritation potential of the GW642444 was made based on % viability. The relative mean viability of 
the GW642444 treated tissues was 110.1% after 4 hours exposure and 93.9% after 24 hours exposure 
indicating that GW642444 was considered to be a non irritant.

Ocular irritancy - GW642444: determination of eye irritation potential using an in vitro test strategy  
A study was performed to determine the eye irritation potential of GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate 
salt,  GW642444M)  using  the  SkinEthic  Reconstituted  Human  Corneal  model  (RHC,  SkinEthic 
Laboratories, Nice, France) following treatment periods of 10 and 60 minutes. The test is based on the 
hypothesis that irritant chemicals are able to penetrate the corneal epithelial tissue and are sufficiently 
cytotoxic  to  cause  cell  death.  Triplicate  SkinEthic  tissues  were  treated  with  30  mg  of  GW642444  and 
exposed for 10 minutes and 60 minutes. A prediction of the eye irritation potential of the GW642444 
was  made  based  on %  viability.  The  relative  mean  viability  of  GW642444 treated  tissues  was  98.2% 
after a 10 minute exposure and 97.2% after a 60 minute exposure indicating that GW642444 was not 
likely to be a severe ocular irritant.

Immunotoxicity 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Inhalation tolerability and immunological sensitisation in the guinea pig  
The tolerability of an aerosol formulation of GW685698 during daily 1 hour inhalation exposures for 5 
days,  and  the  sensitisation  potential  of  GW685698  when  inhaled  for  1  hour  for  5  consecutive  days, 
followed  by  a  17  day  off-drug  period  and  a  single  1  hour  inhalation  challenge  exposure,  was 
investigated in the guinea pig.  In the tolerability arm of this study, groups of 5 male guinea pigs were 
given  0  (air  only)  and  an  estimated  achieved  dose  of  70.6  mcg/kg/day)  GW685698  once  daily  for  5 
days by nose only inhalation. The daily doses of GW685698 were well tolerated.  
To  assess  the  sensitisation  potential  of  GW685698,  groups  of  10  male  guinea  pigs  were  given 
GW685698X (0, 67.1, 71.2 mcg/kg/day) via inhalation for 60 minutes for 5 consecutive days, followed 
by  a  17  day  off-drug  period  and  a  single  60  minute  inhalation  challenge  exposure  (ovalbumin  or 
saline). 
There was no evidence of respiratory hypersensitivity reactions in guinea pigs exposed to 5 daily doses 
of  GW685698  followed  by  a  single  inhalation  challenge  exposure  17  days  later.    The  positive  control 
(ovalbumin) did elicit an acute anaphylactic reaction. 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
A  weight  of  evidence  review  for  potential  immunotoxicity  associated  with  GW685698  in  combination 
with GW642444 was conducted prior to the initiation of the Phase III clinical programme. In summary, 
based  on  pharmacology  expected  from  a  potent  corticosteroid  receptor  agonist  and  immune-related 
effects  observed  in  preclinical  studies  with  GW685698  alone  or  in  combination  with  GW642444  at 
systemic  exposures  similar  to  or  small  multiples  of  those  achieved  in  humans  at  the  proposed 
commercial dose, there is a theoretical risk of immunotoxicity. However, this risk was considered low 
for  clinical  use  based  on  extensive  experience  in  the  clinic  with  similar  inhaled  products  (e.g. 
salmeterol  /  fluticasone  propionate)  and  a  lack  of  generalised  systemic  immunosuppression  observed 
in humans at the recommended doses.

Studies on impurities 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Genotoxicity (AMES test) for GW642444 impurities  
An  Ames  test  was  conducted  with  GW844166X  (an  intermediate  in  the  synthesis  of  the  drug 
substance), using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and  TA1537 and Escherichia 
coli  strain  WP2  uvrA  (pKM101)  .  GW844166X  was  formulated  in  dimethyl  sulphoxide  (DMSO)  and 
assays were conducted with concentrations in the range 50 to 5000 mcg/plate. GW844166X induced a 
dose-related increase in the frequency of TA1535 revertant colonies, in the presence of S9 only, from 
50 mcg/plate. These increases achieved a threefold increase over the concurrent vehicle control at 50 
mcg/plate  rising  to  a  22-fold  increase  at  1500  mcg/plate.  Revertant  colony  frequency  increases  in 
excess  of  twofold  were  also  noted  for  TA100  (presence  of  S9  only)  at  500  and  1500  mcg/plate.  No 
significant  increases  in  the  frequency  of  revertant  colonies  were  recorded  for  any  of  the  remaining 
bacterial  strains,  with  any  dose  of  the  test  material,  either  with  or  without  metabolic  activation. 
GW844166X was considered mutagenic under the conditions of this test. 
An  Ames  test  was  conducted  with  2,6-dichlorobenzyl  chloride  (precursor  used  to  manufacture  the 
starting  material  GW842540X)  using  Salmonella  typhimurium  strains  TA98,  TA100,  TA1535  and 
TA1537 and Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA (pKM101). 2,6- dichlorobenzyl chloride was formulated in 
dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and assays were conducted with concentrations in the range 1.5 to 1500 
mcg/plate. 2,6- dichlorobenzyl chloride was non-mutagenic in all assays at concentrations up to 1500 
mcg/plate, in the absence and presence of an in vitro metabolic activation system (rat liver S9-mix). 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  (ERA)  submitted  for  Relvar  Ellipta  was  prepared  in  compliance 
with  the  Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00).  The  two  active  substances  fluticasone  furoate  and  vilanterol  have  been 
assessed  separately.  Predicted  environmental  concentrations  were  significantly  below  the  threshold 
value of 0.01 μL, indicating that no a Phase II – Tier A is needed for both active substances. 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
A  Phase  I  environmental  risk  assessment  was  performed  to  evaluate  potential  environmental  risks  of 
fluticasone  furoate.  The  log  K ow  was  determined  according  to  study  OECD  117  with  a  value  of  2.61. 
Based on the log K ow value being below 3, fluticasone furoate is not expected to be a bio-accumulative 
substance.The  environmental  exposure  assessment  was  estimated  according  to  the  formula  for  the 
calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC):

Fluticasone  furoate  is  a  glucocorticoid,  hence  it  should  be  considered  as  a  potential  endocrine 
disruptor.  Therefore  the  potential  endocrine  activity  of  this  compound  should  be  investigated.  In  the 
context of the obligation of the Applicant to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following point to be addressed: 
•  An OECD 210 modified extended early life-stage study in fish using fluticasone furoate should 
be conducted to complete the Environmental Risk Assessment. Once the results are available, 
the Environmental Risk Assessment should be updated accordingly. 
The  results  from  this  additional  study  were  not  considered  required  by  the  Committee  before  the 
adoption of the positive CHMP opinion and it is confirmed that these applications comply with Article 6 
of Regulation 726/2004 having regard to the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  combination  of  an  inhaled  corticosteroid  (fluticasone  furoate)  with  a  long  acting  beta2-agonist 
(vilanterol)  is  a  well  established  principle  for  asthma  and  COPD  therapy  as  both  components  have  a 
complementary  mechanism  of  action.  The  data  of  the  only  primary  pharmacodynamics  study  with 
GW685698 and GW642444 in combination confirmed that GW685698 and GW642444 administered in 
combination  could  deliver  improved  anti-inflammmatory  efficiency  when  compared  to  the  inhaled 
corticosteroid alone.  
Administration  of  fluticasone  furoate  combined  with  vilanterol  did  not  result  in  any  significant  new 
toxicity. 
Fluticasone  furoate  was  not  genotoxic  in  a  standard  battery  of  studies  and  was  not  carcinogenic  in 
lifetime inhalation studies in rats or mice at exposures similar to those at the maximum recommended 
human  dose,  based  on  AUC.  In  genetic  toxicity  studies,  vilanterol  (as  alpha-phenylcinnamate)  and 
triphenylacetic acid were not genotoxic indicating that vilanterol (as trifenatate) does not represent a 
genotoxic  hazard  to  humans.    Consistent  with  findings  for  other  beta2  agonists,  in  lifetime inhalation 
studies vilanterol trifenatate caused proliferative effects in the female rat and mouse reproductive tract 
and rat pituitary gland. There was no increase in tumour incidence in rats or mice at exposures 2- or 
30-fold, respectively, those at the maximum recommended human dose, based on AUC.

Effects seen following inhalation administration of fluticasone furoate in combination with vilanterol in 
rats were similar to those seen with fluticasone furoate alone. Fluticasone furoate was not teratogenic 
in rats or rabbits, but delayed development in rats and caused abortion in rabbits at maternally toxic 
doses. There were no effects on development in rats at exposures approximately 3-times greater than 
those  at  the  maximum  recommended  human  dose,  based  on  AUC.  Vilanterol  trifenatate  was  not 
teratogenic in rats. In inhalation studies in rabbits, vilanterol trifenatate caused effects similar to those 
seen  with  other  beta2  agonists  (cleft  palate,  open  eyelids,  sternebral 
fusion  and 
limb 
flexure/malrotation). When given subcutaneously there were no effects at exposures 84 times greater 
than those at the maximum recommended human dose, based on AUC. 
Neither  fluticasone  furoate  nor  vilanterol  trifenatate  had  any  adverse  effects  on  fertility  or  pre-  and 
post-natal development in rats. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  overall  non-clinical  development  programme  of  the  fluticasone  furoate/vilanterol  FDC  was 
considered  adequate  to  support  the  recommendation  for  a  marketing  authorisation  for  Relvar  Ellipta. 
The  available  non-clinical  data  including  the  results  obtained  from  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  and 
reproduction  toxicity  studies  with  Relvar  Ellipta  and  the  environmental  risk  assessment  did  not  raise 
any  particular  safety  issue.  Based  on  the  available  non-clinical  safety  data  with  the  two  compounds, 
fluticasone  furoate  and  vilanterol,  it  is  concluded  that  the  FDC  should  be  well  tolerated  when  used  in 
human at the proposed dosage.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
The  Applicant  initially  sought  a  Marketing  Authorisation  for  fluticasone  furoate/vilanterol  inhalation 
powder for the regular, treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older where 
use of a combination product (long-acting beta2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate and 
for  the  symptomatic  treatment  of  patients  with  COPD  with  a  FEV1<70%  predicted  normal  (post-
bronchodilator)  in  patients  with  an  exacerbation  history.  The  recommended  starting  dose  of  Relvar 
Ellipta for the treatment of asthma in patients aged 12 and older is 92/22 μg once daily. The dose can 
be  increased  to  184/22  μg  once  daily  for  patients  not  sufficiently  controlled  on  92/22  μg  once  daily. 
The  recommended  starting  dose  of  Relvar  Ellipta  for  the  treatment  of  COPD  in  adult  patients  is  also 
92/22 μg once daily. 
The clinical development program of Relvar Ellipta was designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy 
of fluticasone furoate, vilanterol and fluticasone furoare/vilanterol as FDC in patients with asthma and 
COPD.

Scientific  advice  was  provided  by  the  CHMP  in  2008,  2009  and  2010  on  the  clinical  aspects  of  the 
development  program 
for  FF/VI 
for  asthma  and 
for  COPD  on 
four  separate  occasions 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/343456/2011).  Scientific  Advice  from  the  CHMP  on  the  design  of  Phase  IIb  dose-
ranging  studies  for  the  individual  components  in  adult  and  adolescent  subjects  with  asthma,  on  the 
Phase  III  asthma  programme  and  on  the  Phase  III  COPD  programme  was  sought.  As  a  consequence 
the  Applicant  changed  the  number  of  strengths  of  FF/VI  investigated  in  the  asthma  and  COPD 
programmes. After the results of the Phase IIb studies became available, the Applicant decided not to 
progress the highest proposed strength for asthma (400/25 μg) and but only the 100/25 and 200/25 
μg strengths. The dose of FP comparator in the Phase III studies was also adjusted accordingly based 
on  these data.  The  Phase III  COPD  programme  was  also  modified  to include a  lower  strength  (50/25 
μg), as a no effect/less effective dose as recommended by CHMP. Scientif Advice was also provided by 
the  CHMP  on  the  paediatric  clinical  and  non-clinical  development  programme  for  FF/VI  for  asthma  in 
July 2008.  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The  clinical  trials  were  performed  in  accordance  with  GCP  as  claimed  by  the  applicant.  The  applicant 
has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community  were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
The  CHMP  was  informed  on  the  11th    of  June  2013  that  13%  of  tiotropium  treated  patients  in  study 
DB2113360  (COPD  indication)  were  not  blinded  to  treatment  due  to  an  incorrect  coverage  of  the 
original foil supplied by an US contractor. The Applicant was requested during the evaluation to show 
how  this  issue  did  not  impact  on  the  final  results.  The  Applicant  provided  a  preliminary  analysis  of 
several important clinical endpoints (trough FEV1, 0-6 hour FEV1, SGRQ, TDI) comparing change over 
time  in  patients  treated  with  the  potentially  defectively  masked  tiotropium  to  those  treated  with 
correctly masked tiotropium. However, there are several deficiencies in the analysis provided (e.g. only 
the results for the tiotropium and vilanterol arms were provided, the numbers per treatment arm and 
the dropout rate are unknown). In conclusion, the information provided by the Applicant does not allow 
to draw firm conclusions on the impact of the unblinding of tiotropium in study DB2113360. However, 
considering  that  87%  of  patients  in  the  tiotropium  arm  were  still  blinded  and  that  study  DB2113360 
versus  tiotropium  is  considered  only  as  supportive,  the  impact  of  the  unblinding  remains  as  an 
uncertainty  that  can  be  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP  as  it  does  not  change  the  benefit/risk  of 
the VI/FF combination.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of FF and VI have been characterised with inhaled FF/VI administered via the NDPI in studies in 
healthy  subjects,  subjects  with  asthma  (including  paediatric  subjects),  subjects  with  COPD,  and 
subjects  with  renal  or  hepatic  impairment.  The  Applicant  also  included  information  regarding  studies 
administering the individual components, FF and VI, using different routes, formulations and inhalers. 
The  assessment  of  the  PK  focused  exclusively  on  the  combination  administered  via  the  NDPI. 
Pharmacokinetic  data  for  FF  and  VI  was  also  obtained  from  phase  IIb  studies  with  the  individual 
components  in  subjects  with  asthma  and  subjects  with  COPD  and  Phase  III  studies  with  FF/VI  or  FF 
and  VI  alone.  The  concentration  time  data  from  these  studies  have  been  used,  where  possible,  to 
develop  population  pharmacokinetic  models  to  investigate  potential  covariate  effects  such  as 
demographics  on  the  pharmacokinetics  and  to  evaluate  potential  relationship  between  FF  and  VI 
Systemic exposure and reported AEs in the Phase III.  
In  total  11  clinical  pharmacology  studies  have  been  performed  and  completed  with  the  inhaled  FF/VI 
administered via the NDPI, and 8 out of the 11 studies have a pharmacokinetic evaluation.  
Absorption 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of FF and VI have been studied separately after 
oral and intravenous (FF only) administration of radiolabelled drug (studies FFR10008, B2C106181 and 
B2C106180). The inhaled absorption characteristics of FF and VI following administration of FF/VI via 
NDPI  and  the  distribution  and  pharmacokinetics  of  FF  and  of  VI  following  intravenous  administration 
have been studied in study HZA102934.

Bioavailability 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Comparison of radioactivity AUC(0-t) values estimated following oral (2 mg solution) and intravenous 
(250 mcg) dosing indicate that at least 30% of the dose was absorbed following oral administration of 
[14C]FF  in  solution  (study  FFR10008).  Exposure  to  parent  FF  represented  a  small  percentage  (in  the 
region of <3%) of the total drug-related material in plasma. This was indicative of extensive first-pass 
metabolism of orally absorbed FF and the presence of one or more circulating FF metabolites following 
oral dosing. 
The  oral  bioavailability  of  FF  was  low,  on  average  1.26%.  Given  this  low  oral  bioavailability  for  FF, 
systemic  FF  exposure  following  inhaled  administration  is  primarily  due  to  absorption  of  the  inhaled 
portion of the dose delivered to the lung. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Based  on  urinary  recovery  of  radioactivity  (study  B2C106181),  at  least 50.4%  of  the  VI  solution  oral 
dose  was  absorbed  via  the  gut,  resulting  in  notable  exposure  to  drug  related  material.  Based  on  the 
proportion of unchanged VI in human faeces (5% of the recovered dose) oral absorption is likely to be 
greater than this estimate. Exposure to parent VI represented a very small percentage (in the region of 
<0.5%)  of  the  total  drug-related  material  in  plasma.  This  was  indicative  of  extensive  first-pass 
metabolism of orally absorbed VI and the presence of one or more circulating VI metabolites following 
oral dosing. 
Following oral administration, maximum VI plasma concentrations were achieved at a median time of 
30  minutes  post-dose  (study  B2C106180).  The  low  approximate  estimate  of  VI  oral  bioavailability 
(<2%),  calculated  from  ratio  of  AUCs  to  a  common  time  point  after  oral  and  IV  administration, 
suggested  a  minimal  oral  contribution  to  the  overall  inhaled  pharmacokinetic  profile  in  healthy 
subjects.  Consequently,  following  inhaled  administration,  systemic  VI  exposure  is  primarily  due  to 
absorption of the inhaled portion of the dose delivered to the lung. 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
Study  HZA102934  was  an  open-label,  non-randomised,  single  dose,  three-way  crossover  study  in 
healthy  male  and  female  subjects  to  determine  the  absolute  bioavailability  of  FF  (800  mcg)  and  VI 
(100  mcg)  when  administered  as  the  FF/VI  inhalation  powder  via  NDPI  (4  inhalations  of  200/25  mcg 
strength).  The  study  included  single  intravenous  dosing  of  250  mcg  FF  and  55  mcg  VI  in  treatment 
periods 2 and 3, respectively, which provided data on the disposition of FF and VI. 
The absolute bioavailability for FF when administered by inhalation as FF/VI via the novel dry powder 
was  15.2%  (90%  CI:  12.6%,  18.4%).  The  absolute  bioavailability  for  VI  when  administered  by 
inhalation as FF/VI via the novel dry powder was 27.3% (90% CI: 21.6%, 34.6%). 
For FF the t½ following FF/VI 800/100 mcg inhaled administration was notably longer than that seen 
following IV dosing (on average 24 hours versus 15 hours). This suggested that the elimination of FF is 
absorption  rate  limited  following  inhaled  administration.  For  VI  the  apparent  t½  following  FF/VI 
800/100  mcg  inhaled  administration  and  IV  dosing  were  very  similar  (on  average  2.47  hours  versus 
2.40 hours) suggesting no rate limiting absorption for VI following inhaled dosing. 
To  investigate  this  further,  the  inhaled  concentration-time  data  for  FF  and  VI  from  study  HZA102934 
were subjected to deconvolution analysis and time versus percent remaining to be absorbed data were 
generated. Summaries of the mean absorption time (MAT), the time for absorption of 90% of the total 
bioavailable dose (T90) and absorption half-life (t½,absorp) values are presented in the table below.

Table 15.  Summary of FF and VI Absorption Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Inhaled 
Administration of FF/VI 800/100 mcg in Healthy Subjects [HZA102934] 
Bioequivalence 
No  bioequivalence  studies  were  performed  with  fluticasone  furoate/vilanterol  since  there  were  no 
changes to the formulation in the blisters during product development after the start of the Phase III 
studies.  
Influence of food 
It is likely that the majority of an inhaled dose of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol is eventually swallowed 
and therefore the presence of food in the GI tract has the potential to influence its absorption into the 
systemic  circulation.  Dosing  with  food  can  affect  the  rate  and  extent  of  drug  absorption.  However, 
according to the applicant, any orally absorbed FF or VI from the swallowed portion of an FF/VI inhaled 
dose  undergoes  extensive  first  pass  metabolism  and  data  from  the  absolute  bioavailability  study 
showed no capacity limitation on the first pass effect for either FF or VI at daily doses of up to 4 times 
greater than the highest clinical dose of FF/VI. Therefore, even if co-administration with food were to 
affect  the  rate  and/or  extent  of  absorption  of  either  molecule  it  would  not  be  expected  to  result  in 
higher  systemic  exposure,  compared to  the  fasted  state,  at the  proposed  clinical  doses of  FF/VI. This 
was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Distribution 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Following intravenous dosing, FF was extensively distributed (study HZA102934). The average volume 
of  distribution  at  steady-state  was  661  L.  Following  intravenous  dosing  with  [14C]FF  the  level  of 
radioactivity  in  blood  was  lower  than  the  corresponding  level  in  plasma  following  intravenous  dosing, 
indicating a low association with red blood cells (study FFR10008). Blood cell association of FF had an 
in  vitro  blood-to-plasma  ratio of  0.6  for  man.  In-vitro  plasma  protein  binding  in  human  plasma  of  FF 
was  very  high  with  an  average  value  of  >99.6%  at  the  lowest  concentrations  investigated.  Plasma 
protein  binding  was  very  high  (>  99%)  regardless  of  concentration  and  predominantly  bound  to 
albumin (96%) and α1-acid glycoprotein (90%) (studies WD2005/01123/00 and WD2003/01268/00). 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Following intravenous dosing, VI was extensively distributed (study HZA102934). The average volume 
of  distribution  at  steady-state  was  165  L.  Blood  cell  association  of  VI  had  a  blood-to-plasma  ratio  of 
0.8  for  man  (study  WD2006/02044/00).  In-vitro  plasma  protein  binding  of  VI  in  human  plasma  was 
moderately high with an average value of 93.9%. Both plasma protein binding and blood cell binding 
for VI were independent of concentration.  
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
No  additional  studies  have  been  conducted  for  the  fluticasone  furoate/vilanterol  FDC  which  is 
considered acceptable.

Elimination 
Excretion 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
The  intravenous  pharmacokinetics  of  FF  showed  high  plasma  clearance  (geometric  mean:  65.4  L/h 
[95%  CI:  58.8  L/h,  72.8  L/h])  (study  HZA102934).  The  terminal  phase  elimination  half-life  of  FF 
following  intravenous  dosing  was,  on  average,  15.12  h  (95%  CI:  11.82,  19.35).  Following  oral  and 
intravenous  administration  of  [14C]FF  to  healthy  male  subjects  in  clinical  study  FFR10008  total 
radioactivity  was  excreted  primarily  in  faeces,  accounting  for  on  average  approximately  101%  and 
90% of the administered dose by 168 and 264 hour post dose, respectively. Excretion of drug related 
material in the faeces following intravenous dosing is probably indicative of biliary excretion. Excretion 
of total radioactivity via urine accounted for on average approximately 1% and 2% of the administered 
dose following oral and intravenous administration, respectively. Due to these low amounts the nature 
of this material was not investigated. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
The  intravenous  pharmacokinetics  of  VI  showed  high  plasma  clearance  (geometric  mean:  108  L/h 
[95% CI: 86.2 L/h, 135 L/h]) (study HZA102934). The apparent terminal phase elimination half-life of 
VI  following  intravenous  dosing  was,  on  average,  2.40  h  (95%  CI:  1.65,  3.48).  Following  oral 
administration of [14C]VI to healthy male subjects in clinical study B2C106181 total radioactivity was 
excreted  primarily  in  urine  (50.4%  of  the  administered  radioactive  dose  or  70%  of  the  recovered 
radioactivity).  Faecal  elimination  accounted  for  21.2%  of  the  administered  radioactive  dose  over  the 
168  h  post-dose  period  (corresponding  to  30%  of  the  recovered  radioactivity).  Most  of  the  urinary 
radioactivity (48.4% of the administered radioactive dose) was excreted within 24 hours post-dose and 
most of  the  faecal  radioactivity  (20.6% of  the  administered  radioactive  dose)  was  excreted  within  96 
hour  post-dose.  Although  only  72%  of  the  administered  radioactive  dose  was  recovered  in  urine  and 
faeces  collected  over  7  days  post-dose,  the  elimination  of  VI  drug-related  material  was  essentially 
complete  within  120  hour  of  dosing  with  less  than  0.2%  of  the  administered  oral  radioactive  dose 
being recovered in the 120 to 144 h and 144 to 168 hour urine and faecal post-dose collections. The 
discrepancy  between  administered  and  recovered  radioactivity  is  most  likely  due  to  technical 
consequences  resulting  from  the  analytical  approaches  required  as  a  result  of  the  low  chemical  and 
radioactive doses administered. 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
No  additional  studies  have  been  conducted  for  the  FDC  fluticasone  furoate/vilanterol  which  is 
considered acceptable. 
Metabolism 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
The  human  metabolism  of  FF  was  investigated  using  faeces,  urine  and  plasma  samples  collected 
following  oral  and  intravenous  administration  of  [14C]FF  to  healthy  male  subjects  (study  FFR10008). 
FF was eliminated in human mainly by metabolism with metabolites being excreted almost exclusively 
in  faeces.  The  principal  route  of  metabolism  was  via  hydrolysis  of  the  S-fluoromethyl  carbothioate 
group  to  form  GW694301X  (M10).  Two  other  minor  drug-related  components  were  assigned  in  the 
human faecal extracts which were formed as a result of either defluorination and hydroxylation (M26) 
or  by  hydroxylation  of  GW694301X  (M32).  Identification  of  other  drug-related  material  present  in 
human faeces was not practically possible due to the low chemical mass present in the samples. There 
was  no  in  vivo  evidence  for  cleavage  of  the  furoate  moiety  resulting  in  the  formation  of  fluticasone.

EMA/282960/2013

Following  oral  administration  unchanged  FF  and  GW694301X  (M10)  were  both  minor  components  in 
plasma. GW694301X (M10) has been shown to have negligible pharmacological activity (at least 6000-
fold lower) compared with parent FF (study HR2007/00010/00) and could not be detected (LLQ of 20 
pg/mL) in plasma following inhaled FF administration to humans at doses up 4 mg (study FFA10001). 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
The human metabolism of VI  was investigated using faecal, urine, plasma and duodenal bile samples 
collected following oral administration of [14C]VI to healthy male subjects in clinical study B2C106181. 
Following  oral  administration,  VI  was  absorbed  then  eliminated  mainly  by  metabolism  followed  by 
excretion of metabolites in urine and faeces (approximately 70% and 30% of the recovered radioactive 
dose,  respectively).  The  main  route  of  metabolism  was  by  O-dealkylation  to  a  range  of  metabolites 
with significantly reduced β1- and β2-agonist activity that included GW630200 and GSK932009. Up to 
78% of the recovered dose (in all excreta) was potentially associated with O-dealkylated metabolites. 
Ndealkylation  (to  M20)  and  C-dealkylation  (to  M26)  were  minor  pathways  in  human  representing  a 
combined  5%  of  the  recovered  dose.  Unchanged  VI  in  human  faeces  (5%  of  the  recovered  oral 
radioactive  dose)  represented  either  unabsorbed  dose  or  absorbed  but  unchanged  VI  (or  conjugate) 
secreted  directly  into  the  GI  tract  or  via  human  bile.  Duodenal  bile  collected  using  the  exploratory 
EnteroTest  device  technique  contained  low  levels  of  radioactivity.  This  may  be  a  reflection  of 
metabolites  being  eliminated  mainly  via  alternative  non-biliary  routes  (e.g.  urine)  or  could  be  due  to 
non-optimal collection of the bile samples or inefficient gall bladder emptying in the subjects. 
The  applicant  states  that  three  independent  pieces  of  data  support  the  hypothesis  that  human 
metabolites of VI make a negligible contribution to its pharmacological effect in man. Firstly, following 
oral administration of [14C]VI (200 mcg) in study B2C106181 plasma concentrations of VI metabolites 
(drug-related material) were significantly higher than VI plasma concentrations and were also likely to 
be considerably greater than plasma concentrations of metabolites produced after administration of the 
therapeutic  inhaled  VI  dose  (25  mcg).  Secondly,  despite  the  higher  metabolite  concentrations,  there 
were no changes in measured vital signs or heart rate which is indicative of a lack of metabolite beta-
adrenoceptor  activity.  Metabolites  representative  of  the  major  human  metabolic  routes,  including 
GW630200  and  GSK932009  have  been  synthesised,  tested  and  shown  to  have  negligible 
pharmacological  activity  against  both  β1-  and  β2-receptors  (study  HR2008/00016/00).  Lastly,  in 
human  liver  microsome  incubations  with  VI,  β2-activity  diminished  with  time  in  proportion  with  the 
loss of VI by metabolism indicating that the β2 activity is due to the presence of parent VI. 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
No  additional  studies  have  been  conducted  for  the  FDC  fluticasone  furoate/vilanterol  which  is 
considered acceptable. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
Study  HZA102932  was  an  open-label,  three-way  crossover,  single  dose,  study  to  evaluate  the  dose 
proportionality of fluticasone furoate (FF) and vilanterol (VI) when administered to healthy subjects as 
FF/VI inhalation powder from the novel dry powder inhaler.

Methods 
The principal aim of the study was to assess whether the systemic exposure of fluticasone furoate (FF) 
increased  proportionately  across  different  strength  combinations  of  FF/vilanterol  (VI)  and  whether  VI 
systemic exposure was constant across the different strengths.  
Eligible subjects were healthy male or female volunteers. 
There were three treatment periods. During each of these subjects attended the unit on Day -1, were 
resident  until the  morning  of  Day  2  and  then  attended  the  unit  for  blood  sampling  at  32  h  post-dose 
(Day 2) and 48 h post-dose (Day 3). 
Subjects received the following three treatments in accordance with the randomisation schedule: 
FF/VI 200/100 mcg (four inhalations of FF/VI 50/25 mcg) 
FF/VI 400/100 mcg (four inhalations of FF/VI 100/25 mcg) 
FF/VI 800/100 mcg (four inhalations of FF/VI 200/25 mcg)

Time dependency 
Study  HZA114624  was  a  randomised,  repeat-dose,  placebo-controlled,  three  way  crossover  double-
blind study to evaluate and compare the efficacy of FF/VI inhalation powder, when administered either 
in the morning or in the evening, in male and female asthmatic subjects. 
Methods 
The  primary  aim  was  to  investigate  the  effect  of  the  time  of  dosing;  morning  or  evening    on  the 
efficacy  (0–24  h  weighted  mean  FEV1  (the  primary  endpoint)  on  Day  14  of  repeat  dose  FF/VI 
administered via a novel dry powder inhaler in subjects with persistent bronchial asthma.  
Eligible subjects were male and female, aged eighteen to seventy years, with a documented history of 
persistent asthma and had been using an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), with or without a SABA, for at 
least  12  weeks  prior  to  screening.  Subjects  had  a  screening  pre-bronchodilator  FEV1  of  at  least  60% 
predicted normal and reversible airway disease, defined as an increase in FEV1 of at least 12.0% over 
baseline and an absolute change of at least 200 mL following nebulised salbutamol.  
Subjects  meeting  all  of  the  inclusion  criteria  and  none  of  the  exclusion  criteria  during  the  screening 
visit entered a 14 day run-in period. During the run-in period, subjects were required to discontinue all 
of  their  usual  asthma  medication,  with  the  exception  of  inhaled  short-acting  beta-agonists  (SABA), 
which were supplied by the site. During the run-in period subjects also recorded AM and PM PEF using 
an  electronic  PEF  meter,  which  was  provided  to  the  subjects  at  screening.  The  first  dose  in  each 
treatment period was the Day 1 PM dose. Subjects were admitted to the clinical unit in the evening of 
Day 1 in each treatment period, a minimum of 1 h before the first dose, for baseline assessments. 
The three treatment arms, dosed at nine a.m and nine p.m., were: 
• 
• 
• 
FF/VI 100 mcg/25 mcg administered in the morning for 14 days with placebo in the evening  
FF/VI 100 mcg/25 mcg administered in the evening for 14 days with placebo in the morning  
Placebo administered for 14 days in the morning and evening. 
There was a washout of 14 to 21 days between treatment arms.

Pharmacokinetics in target population 
COPD 
A  meta-analysis  was  conducted  to  characterise  the  FF  and  VI  population  pharmacokinetics  and 
population PK/PD profile of FF/VI and the individual components (FF and VI) administered once-daily in 
the  morning  to  subjects  with  COPD.  Three  Phase  IIIa  (studies  HZC110946,  HZC112206  and 
HZC112207)  and  one  Phase  II  (study  HZC111348)  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled  studies  in  subjects  with  COPD  were  included  in  the  VI  meta-analysis.  A  further  Phase  I 
randomised,  placebo-controlled  investigation  in  healthy  subjects  (study  HZA102936),  with  intense  PK 
sampling,  was  included  to  support  population  PK  modelling  and  stabilise  parameter  estimation.  This 
Phase  I  study  was  chosen  because  it  included  a  supra-therapeutic  FF/VI  dose  (800/100  mcg).  In  all 
studies FF/VI (800/100, 200/25, 100/25 and 50/25 mcg), FF (100 and 200 mcg) or VI (25 mcg) were 
administered once-daily (QD) in the morning via NDPI. 
The FF population PK analysis dataset comprised of 1307 individuals and included 11,798 observations 
of  which  39%  were  reported  as  non-quantifiable  (NQ).  Most  (94%)  were  patients  with  COPD.  The  VI 
population  PK  analysis  dataset  was  comprised  of  1167  individuals  and  10,807  observations  of  which 
30% were reported as NQ; 94% came from patients with COPD. As a consequence of the large extent 
of NQ data it was necessary to use methodology that maximised the likelihood for all the data, treating 
those data below the LLQ as censored.  
Fluticasone furoate 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  FF  in  subjects  with  COPD  was  well  described  by  a  two  compartment  model 
with 1st order absorption and 1st order elimination. The only covariate found to be significant was race 
on inhaled clearance (CL/F). Based on the final model, the population mean estimate for CL/F was 230 
L/h for a white Caucasian subject with COPD. Estimates of FF AUC(0-24) for East Asian, Japanese and 
South  Asian  subjects  were  on  average  23%  to  30%  higher  compared  with  white  Caucasian  subjects. 
For  subjects  categorised  as  Asian  Central,  White  Arabic,  American  Indian/Native  Alaskan  and  ‘Other’, 
estimates  of  FF  AUC(0-24)  were  on  average  10%  to  26%  higher  compared  with  white  Caucasian 
subjects  and  for  African  American  estimates  of  AUC(0-24)  were  on  average 27%  lower to  8%  higher 
compared  with  white  Caucasians  although,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  numbers  of  subjects  in  these 
race  categories  were  low  at  each  dose  level.  Although  there  is  evidence  for  higher  FF  systemic 
exposure in these ethnic groups, values are still below those associated with unwanted systemic effects 
on  the  HPA-axis.  For  African  American  subjects  with  COPD  CL/F  was  higher  and  AUC(0-24)  was  on 
average 27% lower to 3% higher compared with white Caucasian subjects with COPD. Comparison of 
the  model  predicted  FF  systemic  exposure  (final  model)  showed  no  notable  difference  between 
individual component versus combination treatment. Model predicted FF systemic exposure in subjects 
with COPD by FF dose is summarised in the table below.

The pharmacokinetics of VI in subjects with COPD was well described by a three compartment model 
with zero-order absorption. The analysis showed that there was a decrease (27%) in inhaled clearance 
(CL/F)  over  the  observed  age  41  to  84  years.  A  reduction  (47%)  in  CL/F  is  also  predicted  over  the 
bodyweight  range  of  160  to  35  kg  in  subjects  with  COPD.  The  central  volume  (V1/F)  was  found  to 
decrease (30%) with increasing age (41-84 years), to be lower (12%) in females and to be increased 
with  smoking.  Additionally,  the  Phase  II  study  HZC111348  was  a  significant  covariate  on  CL/F  and 
V1/F.  
As  a  result  of  lower  CL/F  and  a  smaller  central  volume  (V1/F),  the  VI  exposure  was  predicted  to  be 
higher  (approximately  1.5-fold  higher  AUC(0-24)  and  2.7-fold  higher  Cmax)  in  the  small  number  of 
subjects  with  COPD  (n=39)  recruited  to  the  Phase  II  study  (study  HZC111348)  compared  with  the 
larger  Phase  IIIa  population  (n=  1052  subjects  with  COPD).  The  reason  for  this  marked  study 
difference is unclear. Despite the higher systemic VI exposure in HZC111348, the FF/VI dose was well 
tolerated and was  not associated with an increase in heart rate (weighted mean 0-4 hours difference 
from  placebo  was  0.6  bpm  [95%  CI:  -3.9  to  5.1]).  Comparison  of  the  model  predicted  VI  systemic 
exposure  (final  model)  showed  no  notable  difference  between  individual  component  versus 
combination treatment.  
Asthma 
A  meta-analysis  was  conducted  to  characterise  the  FF  and  VI  population  pharmacokinetic  profile  of 
FF/VI  and  the  individual  component  (FF)  administered  once-daily  in  the  evening  to  subjects  with 
asthma.  Four Phase IIIa studies (studies HZA106827, HZA106829, HZA106839 and HZA106851) were 
included  in  the  meta-analyses.  A  further  Phase  I  randomised,  placebo-controlled  investigation  in 
healthy  subjects  (study  HZA102936),  with  intense  PK  sampling,  was  included.  The  FF  population  PK 
analysis included 1,295 individuals who provided 9,247 observations of which 29.5% were reported as 
NQ. The VI population PK analysis dataset was comprised of 932 subjects who provided a total of 6934 
observations of which 56% were reported as NQ.  
Fluticasone furoate 
The  analysis  showed  that  the  plasma  FF  concentration  time  profile  following  FF/VI  or  FF  could  be 
described by a two-compartment model with 1st order absorption and 1st order elimination. The only 
covariate found to be significant was race (East Asian, Japanese and South Asian) on inhaled clearance 
(CL/F). Based on the final model, the population mean estimate for CL/F was 183 L/h for a subject with 
asthma.  Estimates  of  FF  AUC(0-24)  for  East  Asian,  Japanese  and  South  Asian  subjects  were  on 
average  33%  to 53%  higher  compared  with  subjects  in  other  racial  groups. This  finding  is  consistent 
with results seen previously in healthy subjects of East Asian origin. The higher FF systemic exposure 
in this group, compared with subjects of non-Asian heritage, was not associated with greater systemic 
effects on 24 hour urinary cortisol excretion.

VI  concentration-time  profiles  in  subjects  with  asthma  reflected  rapid  reach  of  VI  Cmax  but  provided 
little  data  to  define  the  absorption  phase.  Based  on  the  observed  concentration-time  profiles,  and 
previous  modelling  in  subjects  with  COPD,  a  three  compartment  linear  model  with  zero-order 
absorption  and  1st  order  elimination  was  evaluated.  The  following  covariates  were  found  to  be 
significant:  on  inhaled  clearance  (CL/F)  and  the  volume  of  the  central  compartment  (V1/F)  and  race 
(East Asian, Japanese and South Asian) on V1/F. Reflecting the sparse nature of the VI PK profile >1.5 
hours  post-dose,  population  parameter  estimates  describing  inter-compartment  clearance  (Q2/F  and 
Q3/F) and peripheral volume (V3/F) and inter-individual variability for V2/F, V3/F, Q2/F and Q3/F were 
poorly  defined  for  subjects  with  asthma  and  were  fixed  to  population  estimates  reported  for  healthy 
subjects in study HZA102936 in a previous meta-analysis. 
The  final  population  PK  model  incorporated  the  effect  of  study  HZA106851  on  CL/F  and  race 
(RACE1=2)  and  study  HZA106851  on  V1/F  for  subjects  with  asthma.  Based  on  the  final  model,  the 
population  estimate  for  VI  V1/F  is  predicted  to  be  lower  (81%)  for  those  subjects  with  an  Asian 
heritage  (East  Asian,  Japanese,  South  East  Asian)  compared  with  subjects  with  asthma  from  a  non-
Asian  heritage.  This  difference  may  in  part  be  explained  by  the  observation  that  Asian  subjects  were 
generally  smaller,  with  their  average  weight  approximately  20%  lower.  As  a  result  VI  Cmax  is 
predicted  to  be  220  to  287%  higher  and  AUC(0-24)  comparable  for  those  subjects  from  an  Asian 
heritage  compared  with  subjects  with  asthma  from  a  non-Asian  heritage.  However,  there  is  no 
evidence that this higher VI Cmax results in an effect on observed heart rate (change from baseline 5-
20 minutes post-dose in studies HA106827, HZA106829 and HZA106839). 
Renal impairment 
Study HZA113970 was an open, non-randomised pharmacokinetic and safety study of repeat doses of 
FF/VI combination in healthy subjects and in subjects with severe renal impairment. 
Methods 
The  principal  aim  of  the  study  was  to  investigate  the  effect  of  severe  renal  impairment  on  the 
pharmacokinetics of FF/VI following repeat administration of 200/25 mcg daily via a novel dry powder 
inhaler.

Control subjects were matched to subjects with severe renal impairment by gender, ethnicity, age (±5 
years) and body mass index (±15%). Renally impaired subjects had to have creatinine clearance <30 
mL/min  calculated  by  the  Cockcroft-Gault  equation  using  serum  creatinine.  Subjects  with  renal 
insufficiency  had  to  have  stable  renal  function  defined  as  ≤25%  difference  in  creatinine  clearance 
assessed on two occasions. 
The primary endpoint was fluticasone furoate and VI pharmacokinetics: area under the concentration-
time  curve  from  time  zero  (pre-dose)  to  last  time  of  quantifiable  concentration,  area  under  the 
concentration-time  curve  from  zero  (pre-dose)  to  8  h  (AUC(0–8)),  maximum  observed  concentration 
(Cmax), the time of Cmax (tmax) on Days 1 and 7 and area under the concentration-time curve from 
zero  (pre-dose)  to  24  h  (AUC(0–24))  and  terminal  phase  half-life  (t½)  on  Day  7  Pharmacodynamic 
variables were secondary endpoints.  
Results 
Nine subjects with severe renal impairment were recruited and nine matched controls one in each 
group was female and eight were male: mean age was 55.4 years (range 36 – 66) for healthy subjects 
and 55.8 (range 36 - 67) for renally impaired subjects.

Hepatic impairment 
Study  HZA111789  was  an  open,  non-randomised,  pharmacokinetic  and  safety  study  of  repeat  dose 
FF/VI  (200/25  mcg)  in  healthy  subjects  and  in  subjects  with  mild,  moderate  or  severe  hepatic 
impairment. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment received reduced doses of 100/12.5 mcg. 
Methods 
The principal aim of the study was to investigate the effect of varying degrees of hepatic impairment 
on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  FF/VI  following  repeat  administration  via  the  novel  dry  powder  inhaler 
(NDPI). Subjects took one puff daily for seven days.

Hepatically  impaired  subjects  were  classified  into  groups  using  the  Child-Pugh  classification  –  mild: 
Child-Pugh A (5–6 points); moderate: Child-Pugh B (7–9 points); severe: Child-Pugh C (10–15 points) 
Subjects  with  mild  and  moderate  hepatic  impairment  were  recruited  first.  Once  a  subject  with 
moderate  hepatic  impairment  had  been  enrolled  a  matched  healthy  control  was  enrolled.  Healthy 
controls were matched by gender, ethnicity, age ±5 years and body mass index ±15%. Subjects with 
severe hepatic impairment were not enrolled into the study until nine subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment and their matched control subjects had completed the study.  
Results 
Thirty-five  subjects  were  enrolled  and  all  35  completed  the  study.  Subjects  with  severe  hepatic 
impairment were slightly older, on average, than other subjects (58 years vs. 50–52 years). The table 
below shows the outcome for the main pharmacokinetic variables.

Repeat dose FF/VI (200/25 mcg) had no clinically relevant effects on weighted mean serum cortisol in 
subjects with mild hepatic impairment. In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment weighted mean 
(0–24 h) serum cortisol was reduced by on average 34% (90% CI 11% to 51% decrease) compared 
with healthy subjects. Repeat dose FF/VI (100/12.5 mcg) had no clinically relevant effect on weighted 
mean serum cortisol in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. 
To conclude studies in subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment showed an 
increase in systemic exposure to fluticasone furoate (both Cmax and AUC). 
For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment the maximum dose is 92/22 micrograms.  
Gender and race 
The  effect  of  gender  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  FF  and  VI  following  FF/VI  via  NDPI  has  been 
investigated  as  a  part  of  the  covariate  evaluation  in  the  population  PK  analyses  (FF  and  VI)  of  COPD 
and asthma phase III or phase II studies. The applicant states that there was no evidence for gender 
to affect the PK of either FF or VI.  
Relvar Ellipta  
Assessment report

A  specific  study  (study  HZA113477)  was  performed to  evaluate  race  on  PK  parameters.  Both  AUC(0-
24) and Cmax were higher in the East Asian ethnic compared with Caucasian group (FF 200 mcg and 
FF  800  mcg).  On  the  other  hand  the  average  mean  absorption  time  (MAT)  for  this  ethnic  group  was 
approximately double that for Caucasian subjects, that is, FF resides longer in the lung of East Asian. 
However  there  was  no  evidence  for  a  difference  in  serum  cortisol  weighted  mean.  These  data  are 
consistent  with  the  results  of  the  population  PK  analysis.  Regarding  Vilanterol  no  specific  study  was 
performed,  and  the  results  of  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis,  race  was  not  a  significant 
covariate  in  COPD  but  it  was  for  volume  of  the  central  compartment  in  asthma.  The  approach  is 
considered appropriated and there are no further comments.  
Weight 
Taking  into  account  the  results  of  the  population  PK  analysis  weight  is  not  a  significant  covariate  in 
asthma  but  in  COPD  there  was  a  reduction  of  47%  in  inhaled  clearance  (CL/F)  of  VI  over  the  body 
weight range of 160 to 35 kg. The applicant states that it is unlikely to be of clinical relevance and this 
was supported by the CHMP.  
Elderly population 
In total, only 8 subjects were aged 65-74 years and there were no subjects aged 75-84 years or ≥85 
years  in  the  clinical  pharmacological  studies.  For  population  PK  analyses  the  numbers  are  as  follows 
(see table below): 
Table 22.  Summary of number of subjects by age category 
The  central  volume  (V1/F)  was  found  to  decrease  (30%)  with  increasing  age  (41-84  years).  For  an 
elderly  subject  (aged  84  years)  with  low  bodyweight  (35  kg)  CL/F  is predicted  to  be  35%  lower than 
the  population  estimate  (subject  with  COPD  aged  60  years  and  bodyweight  of  70  kg).  This  modest 
effect of age of VI CL/F may in part reflect declining renal function in the elderly. 
The vast majority of elderly patients included in the population PK analysis come from COPD studies, 
which is expectred taking into account the characteristics of patients with this pathology. The number 
included is considered adequate to obtain correct pharmacokinetic data in the PK model related to age.  
Paediatric population 
The PK parameters of FF/VI in patients less than 12 years of age have not been studied as reflected in 
section 5.2 of the SmPC. The Applicant provided information of two studies in children aged 5 to 11 for 
FF and VI administered alone (studies HZA102942 and HZA112776). No relevant difference in systemic 
exposure  (Cmax  and  AUC(0-24)  with  either  FF  or  VI  was  observed  in  adolescents  with  asthma 
compared to adults.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Fluticasone furoate is an in vitro inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 (IC50 
values  between  0.5  and  1.5  microM).  FF  and  its  major  metabolite  GW694301X  were  found  to  inhibit 
the human transporter protein OATP1B1 (IC50 values of 0.2 and 2.6 microM, respectively). At clinical 
doses  of  FF  the  highest  anticipated  Cmax  in  man  (<0.0001  mcg/mL)  is  at  least  1000-fold  lower  than 
the lowest IC50 value of 0.2 microM (equivalent to 0.11 mcg/mL) as a worst case scenario for all CYPs 
and  transporters  investigated.  There  was  no  direct  or  metabolism-based  inhibition  of  any  of  the 
cytochrome  P450  enzymes  (CYP1A2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6  or 
CYP3A4) observed with GW694301X. Therefore the inhibition potential of FF on CYP P450 enzymes and 
OATP1B1 at low clinical inhalation doses is considered to be negligible. 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Vilanterol is an in vitro inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 (IC50 values between 3.5 and 12 microM). At 
clinical doses the highest anticipated Cmax in man (<0.2 ng/mL or 0.5 nM) is at least 1000-fold lower 
than  the  lowest  IC50  value  (3.5  mcM)  (equivalent  to1.6  mcg/mL)  as  a  worst  case  for  all  CYPs  and 
transporters  investigated.  Therefore  the  inhibition  potential  of  VI  CYP  P450  enzymes  at  low  inhaled 
clinical doses is considered to be negligible. 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
Using  the  approach  recommended  by  the  FDA  in  its  guidance  on  drug  interactions,  I/Ki  values  for  FF 
and VI were estimated to be 0.0002 and 0.0003 for CYP3A4,  which are both considerably lower than 
the threshold of concern of 0.1. For FF the resulting ratio of 0.002 for the worst case IC50 (in this case 
100  nM  for  OATP1B1)  was  also  considerably  lower  than  the  FDA  threshold  of  concern  of  0.1  and, 
therefore,  the  perpetrator  interaction  potential  of  both  FF  and  VI  is  negligible.  Using  the  approach 
recommended  by  the  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of  Drug  Interactions  (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev.1) 
the  Cmax  of  FF  (<0.2  nM)  corresponds  to  a  free  concentration  of  <0.0008  nM  (assuming  protein 
binding  of  99.6%).  The  estimated  Ki  for  OATP1B1  (100  nM),  as  a  worse  case,  is  125,000  fold  higher 
than the unbound Cmax. The Cmax of VI (<0.5 nM) corresponds to a free concentration of < 0.03 nM 
(assuming protein binding of 93.9%). The estimated Ki for CYP3A4 as a worse case (2 mcM) is 70,000 
fold  higher  than  the  unbound  Cmax.  Therefore,  further  clinical  investigation  of  either  FF  or  VI  is  not 
warranted  since  these  values  are  considerably  greater  than  the  threshold  of concern  in  this  guidance 
(<50 fold higher). 
In vivo 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
Fluticasone  furoate  and  VI  are  both  substrates of  cytochrome  P450  3A4  (CYP3A4)  and  P-glycoprotein 
(P-gp).  
Cytochrome CYP3A4 
Study  HZA105548  was  a  double-blind,  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  repeat  dose,  two-way 
crossover  drug  interaction  study  to  investigate  the  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  effects 
following  administration  of  FF/VI  200/25  mcg  inhalation  powder  with  ketoconazole,  a  strong  CYP3A4 
inhibitor and a potent P-gp inhibitor. Ketoconazole coadministration increased mean FF AUC(0-24) and 
Cmax by 36% and 33%, respectively and mean VI AUC(0-t’) and Cmax 65% and 22%, respectively.

Co-administration of repeat dose ketoconazole and FF/VI (200/25 mcg) had no effect on heart rate or 
blood potassium compared with FF/VI and placebo. Pre-defined equivalence criteria were met because 
the  90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  treatment  differences  were  within  ±10  bpm  for  heart  rate  and 
±0.22 mmol/L for potassium. Similarly, there was no effect on either minimum diastolic or maximum 
systolic blood pressure. Co-administration of repeat dose ketoconazole and FF/VI (200/25 mcg) had an 
effect  on  serum  cortisol  (27%  reduction,  on  average)  compared  with  FF/VI  and  placebo.  This  was 
consistent with the increase in FF systemic exposure [AUC(0-24)].  
Co-administration of repeat dose ketoconazole and FF/VI (200/25 mcg) had a effect on maximum QTcF 
(0–4  h),  which  was  on  average  7.55  msec  greater  compared  with  FF/VI  and  placebo.  However, 
ketoconazole  alone  (i.e.  without  any  co-administered  drug)  administered  as  200  mg  twice  daily  has 
been  reported  to  be  associated  with  QTc  increases  of  approximately  5  to  6  msec  and  up  to 
approximately 6 to 12 msec which is not considered to be clinically relevant. 
P-gp Drug Interaction 
Fluticasone furoate and VI are both substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The Applicant states that study 
HZA105548  did  not  indicate  significant  liability  for  FF/VI  when  co-administered  with  ketoconazole,  a 
strong  CYP3A4  and  potent  P-gp  inhibitor  and  therefore  no  specific  study  with  a  P-gp  inhibitor  was 
conducted with FF/VI. The effect of verapamil, a potent P-gp inhibitor and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor 
on  VI  has  been  studied  as  part  of  a  long-acting  muscarinic  antagonist/long-acting  ß2-agonist 
development program. Its co-administration with verapamil (240 mg once daily for five days) did not 
affect the VI  Cmax or AUC suggesting that VI pharmacokinetics would not be significantly affected by 
P-gp inhibition. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Relvar  is  a  combination  of  two  different  medicines:  fluticasone  furoate  (FF)  and  vilanterol  trifenatate 
(VI). 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Fluticasone  furoate  is  a  synthetic  trifluorinated  corticosteroid  with  potent  anti-inflammatory  activity. 
The  precise  mechanism  through  which  fluticasone  furoate  affects  asthma  and  COPD  symptoms  is  not 
known.  Corticosteroids  have  been  shown  to  have  a  wide  range  of  actions  on  multiple  cell  types  (e.g. 
eosinophils,  macrophages,  lymphocytes)  and  mediators  (e.g.  cytokines  and  chemokines  involved  in 
inflammation). 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Vilanterol  trifenatate  is  a  selective  long-acting,  beta2  adrenergic  agonist  (LABA).  The  pharmacologic 
effects  of  beta2  adrenoceptor  agonist  drugs,  including  vilanterol  trifenatate,  are  at  least  in  part 
attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenylate cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion 
of  adenosine  triphosphate  (ATP)  to  cyclic-3’,5’-adenosine  monophosphate  (cyclic  AMP).  Increased 
cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of 
immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Broncho-protective effect:  
The bronchoprotective effect of FF/VI against allergen challenge in subjects with asthma was assessed 
in comparison with FF and VI (early and late asthmatic response [EAR and LAR, respectively]) and in 
comparison with FF (EAR only) and all of them with placebo. 
EAR  was  measured  as  weighted  mean  FEV1  change  from  baseline  0-2  hours  after  allergen  challenge 
(studies HZA113090 and HZA113126). The greatest effects on the EAR were seen with FF/VI compared 
with FF or VI alone. In fact, Relvar achieved a FEV1 of 145 mL greater compared with placebo (which 
represents  a  percentage  of  12%  greater  in  terms  of  maximum  decrease  from  baseline)  in  study 
HZA113090 and 263 mL greater (16% greater) in study HZA113126. 
LAR was only assessed in study HZA113126 showing FEV1 515 mL greater than placebo, representing 
an improvement in minimum FEV1 of 70.5% greater. Both, FF/VI and FF alone, virtually abolished the 
LAR compared with VI alone, which had a smaller effect. This suggests that the effect of FF/VI on the 
LAR was primarily due to the FF component. 
Bronchodilator effect: 
The  bronchodilator  effect  of  VI  was  assessed  in  subjects  with  asthma  and  subjects  with  COPD.  Lung 
function was measured and analysed as a pharmacodynamic endpoint in several early (pre-Phase IIb) 
clinical  pharmacology  studies  with  VI  including  studies  in  healthy  Japanese  subjects  (study 
DB2113208), adult subjects with asthma (studies B2C104604, B2C106996 and B2C111401), pediatric 
subjects  with  asthma  (study  HZA112776)  and  subjects  with  COPD  (study  B2C110165).  In  both 
populations  (asthma  and COPD  patients)  single  dose  VI  (25,  50  and 100  mcg)  demonstrated  efficacy 
compared with placebo as measured by FEV1. There were statistically significant differences in FEV1 at 
all  time  points  from  30  minutes  to  24  h  post-dose.  The  efficacy  of  single  dose  VI  (6.25,  25  and  100 
mcg)  formulated  in  lactose  with  and  without  magnesium  stearate  was  compared  in  subjects  with 
asthma. For the VI formulation with lactose and magnesium stearate mean FEV1 (23 to 24 hours) was 
statistically significantly greater than placebo with differences greater than 200 mL at the 25 mcg and 
100 mcg doses. 
Effect on bronchial hyper-reactivity and airway responsiveness: 
The  effects  of  repeat  dose  FF/VI,  FF  and  VI  on  allergen-induced  bronchial  hyper-reactivity  were 
assessed by methacholine challenge in study HZA113126. Reduced bronchial hyper-reactivity following 
administration  of  FF/VI  was  indicated  by  a  statistically  significant  increase  in  the  doubling  doses  of 
methacholine required to produce a 20% reduction in FEV1 compared with either placebo, FF alone or 
VI  alone.  A  significant  effect  was  seen  when  comparing  FF/VI  with  FF  alone  indicating  some 
contribution  from  VI  when  administered  as  the  FF/VI  combination.  A  significant  effect  was  also  seen 
when comparing FF/VI with VI alone indicating the contribution of FF when administered as the FF/VI 
combination.  The  airway  responsiveness  is  caused  by  FF.  The  duration  of  effect  of  FF  on  airway 
responsiveness  was  assessed  by  conducting  the  AMP  challenge  2,  12  and  26  hours  after  a  single  FF 
1000  mcg  dose  (studies  FFA10022,  FFA10026,  FFA10027  and  FFA10007).  The  mean  AMP  PC20 
(Provocative  Concentration  which  causes  a  20%  decrease  in  FEV1)  doubling  dose  was  increased  by 
2.18,  1.54  and  1.3,  respectively.  In  comparison  fluticasone  propionate  (FP)  1000  mcg  did  not 
significantly  reduce  airway  responsiveness  to  AMP  compared  with  placebo  when  delivered  26  hours 
prior  to  the  challenge  (mean  AMP  PC20  doubling  dose  was  0.33)  compared  with  an  increase  of  1.72 
when FP was administered 14 hours before AMP challenge.

Administration AM or PM: The results of study HZA114624 showed that repeat dose FF/VI 100/25 mcg 
administered  once  daily  in  the  morning  or  evening  resulted  in  clinically  significant  increases  in 
weighted mean FEV1 (Day 14; 0–24 h) and trough FEV1 (Day 14; AM and PM) compared with placebo 
with no apparent clinically significant difference between AM or PM dosing (difference of 44mL). 
Effect on Exhaled Oxide Nitric: Repeat dose FF significantly reduced eNO by up to 48% compared with 
placebo (studies FFA10022 and FFA10028). There was some evidence that the duration of effect of FF 
1000 mcg on eNO was more prolonged compared with Fluticasone Propionate (FP) 1000 mcg at 24 and 
72 h post last dose (difference of 11.3 ppb and 24 ppb, respectively). 
Secondary pharmacology 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
FF may reduce both serum and urine cortisol, like other corticosteroids. Inhaled FF at repeat doses up 
to 400 mcg was not consistently associated with statistically significant decreases in serum or urinary 
cortisol. However, at higher doses above the therapeutic range (up to 1600 mcg) corticosteroid class-
related  decreases  in  serum  and  urine  cortisol  levels  were  seen.  There  was  no  greater  reduction  in 
serum cortisol produced by repeat dose FF/VI in subjects with severe renal impairment compared with 
healthy  subjects.  However  serum  cortisol  was  reduced  by  approximately  a  third  in  subjects  with 
moderate  hepatic  impairment  after  FF/VI  200/25  mcg  and  a  similar  effect  would  be  anticipated  in 
subjects  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  at  this  dose.  There  was  evidence  of  a  greater  reduction  in 
serum cortisol after repeat dose administration of FF 200 mcg in healthy Japanese subjects compared 
with  Caucasian  subjects  although  there  was  no  difference  between  Chinese  or  Korean  subjects  and 
Caucasian  subjects.  In  a  small  study  (study  HZA102942)  serum  cortisol  was  16%  lower  in  pediatric 
subjects with asthma after repeat dose administration of FF 100 mcg although this was not statistically 
significant. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Common and unwanted systemic effects related to exposure to high supra-therapeutic doses of beta2-
adrenoceptor  agonists  include  hypokalemia,  hyperglycaemia  and  sinus  tachycardia,  although  these 
effects  are  limited  by  local  topical  administration  in  the  lung,  low  clinical  doses  and  first  pass 
metabolism  of  the  swallowed  portion  of  the  dose  and  also  tend  to  show  tachyphylaxis  on  repeat 
dosing. The potential systemic beta-adrenergic effects of therapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses of VI 
were assessed by measurement of blood (or plasma or serum) potassium and glucose and vital signs 
(heart  rate  and  blood  pressure)  in  healthy  subjects  (including  Japanese)  as  well  as  in  subjects  with 
renal impairment, hepatic impairment, COPD and asthma (including pediatric subjects). 
Blood  potassium:  The  clinical  pharmacology  would  demonstrate  that  VI  (either  alone  or  in 
combination) at doses up to 50 mcg does not lead to serum potassium decreases. Only at doses of 100 
mcg  it  produced  a  slight  reduction  in  blood  potassium  (<0.1  mmol/L)  and  at  doses  of  200  mcg  it 
produced a 0.24 mmol/L reduction. Repeat dose VI was not associated with a greater effect on blood 
potassium  than  seen  after  a  single  dose.  Co-administration  of  VI  with  a  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitor 
(ketoconazole)  did  not  result  in  a  greater  reduction  in  blood  potassium  than  with  VI  alone  (studies 
HZA105548 and B2C112205). There was no evidence of a different effect on blood potassium when VI 
was administered as FF/VI compared with VI alone (studies HZA105871 and HZA102940).

Heart rate: The clinical pharmacology data would suggest that VI at doses above 25 mcg is associated 
with  small  but  statistically  significant  increases  in  heart  rate  compared  with  placebo.  Repeat  dose  VI 
was  not  associated  with  a  greater  effect  on  heart  rate  than  seen  after  a  single  dose  and  may  have 
diminished  (i.e.  showed  tachyphylaxis).  When  measured  by  12-lead  ECG  in  the  thorough  QT  study, 
mean  increases  in  0-4  h  maximum  heart  rate  of  <4.0  bpm  and  <12.5  bpm  were  seen  after  repeat 
dose FF/VI 200/25 mcg and 800/100 mcg, respectively. There was no evidence of a greater heart rate 
response  to  VI  in  subjects  with  renal  impairment,  hepatic  impairment,  COPD  or  asthma  (including 
pediatric subjects). Repeat dose FF/VI administration with the strong CYP3A4 and potent P-gp inhibitor 
ketoconazole was not associated with an increased effect on heart rate. 
Systolic  and  diastolic  blood  Pressure:  In  healthy  subjects  and  subjects  with  asthma  or  COPD,  VI  at 
doses up to 100 mcg was not consistently associated with clinically relevant or statistically significant 
effects  on  blood  pressure  after  either  single  or  repeat  dose  administration.  It  is  also  important  to 
mention  that  there  is  no  evidence  of  a  difference  after  administration  of  FF/VI  with  Ketoconazole 
(studies  HZA  105548  and  B2C112205).    However,  in  asthmatic  patients  a  statistically  significantly 
reduction  in  diastolic  blood  pressure  is  observed  after  a  100  mcg  VI  dose  (-4.73  mmHg  in  study 
B2C111401).  
Blood Glucose: The clinical pharmacology data would suggest that VI at the proposed therapeutic dose 
as well as at doses up to 50 mcg was not consistently associated with clinically relevant or statistically 
significant  increases  in  blood  glucose.  Administration  of  VI  100  mcg  was  associated  with  increases  in 
maximum  blood  glucose  although  the  effect  tended  to  be  small  (<1  mmol/L)  and  was  not  of  clinical 
concern.  Repeat  dose  VI  was  not  associated  with  a  greater effect  on  blood  glucose  than  seen  after  a 
single  dose  and  actually  showed  signs  of  diminishing  (i.e.  showed  tachyphylaxis).  There  was  no 
evidence  of  a  greater  effect  of  VI  on  blood  glucose  in  subjects  with  COPD  or  asthma  (including 
pediatric subjects) or in healthy Japanese subjects. 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
In  the  Thorough  QT  study  (study  HZA102936)  with  FF/VI  there  was  a  lack  of  effect  on  QTcF  or  on 
individually  corrected  QTc  (QTci)  at  the  proposed  upper  therapeutic  FF/VI  dose  (200/25  mcg  for  7 
days). All time-matched QTcF mean differences from placebo (0-24 h) were less than 5 msec with no 
upper  90%  CI  values  greater  than  10  msec.  At  a  dose  representing  four  times  the  proposed  upper 
therapeutic  FF/VI  dose  (800/100  mcg  for  7  days),  there  was  an  effect  on  QTcF  during  the  first  hour 
after  dosing.  The  largest  mean  time-matched  difference  from  placebo  was  9.6  msec  (90%  CI:  7.2, 
12.0) seen 30 minutes after dosing. This was the only time point where the upper 90% CI exceeded 10 
msec.  
There was little effect on QTci at both doses of FF/VI: all time-matched mean difference from placebo 
values were less than 5 msec with no 90% CI values greater than 10 msec. Heart rate increases were 
seen  at  both  FF/VI  doses  with  maximum  effects  seen  10  minutes  after  dosing.  This  was  particularly 
evident  for  the  FF/VI  800/100  mcg  dose  where  the  mean  heart  rate  increased  by  17  bpm  compared 
with placebo. Maximum heart rate (0-4h; mean difference from placebo [90%CI]) was 3.9 bpm [2.7, 
5.1]  and  12.4  bpm  [11.2,  13.6]  following  administration  of  FF/VI  200/25  mcg  and  800/100  mcg, 
respectively.  Weighted  mean  heart  rate  (0-4h;  mean  difference  from  placebo [90%CI])  was  2.6  bpm 
[1.6,  3.5]  and  7.5  bpm  [6.6,  8.5]  following  administration  of  FF/VI  200/25  mcg  and  800/100  mcg, 
respectively.  Co-administration  of  FF/VI  with  the  CYP3A4  inhibitor  ketoconazole  was  not  associated 
with an increase in the QTc interval above those reported for ketoconazole alone. Administration of VI 
25 mcg in pediatric subjects (5-11 years) with asthma was not associated with increases in the QTcF 
interval.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  absolute  bioavailability  for  fluticasone  furoate  and  vilanterol  when  administered  by  inhalation  as 
fluticasone  furoate/vilanterol  was  on  average  15.2%  and  27.3%,  respectively.  The  oral  bioavailability 
of  both  fluticasone  furoate  and  vilanterol  was  low,  on  average  1.26%  and  <2%,  respectively.  Given 
this  low  oral  bioavailability,  systemic  exposure  for  fluticasone  furoate  and  vilanterol  following  inhaled 
administration is primarily due to absorption of the inhaled portion of the dose delivered to the lung. 
Following  intravenous  dosing,  both  fluticasone  furoate  and  vilanterol  are  extensively  distributed  with 
average  volumes  of  distribution  at  steady  state  of  661  L  and  165  L,  respectively.  Both  fluticasone 
furoate  and  vilanterol  have  a  low  association  with  red  blood  cells.  In  vitro  plasma  protein  binding  in 
human  plasma  of  fluticasone  furoate  and  vilanterol  was  high.  Fluticasone  furoate  and  vilanterol  are 
substrates 
for  P-glycoprotein 
(P-gp),  however,  concomitant  administration  of 
fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol  with  P-gp  inhibitors  is  considered  unlikely  to  alter  fluticasone  furoate  or  vilanterol 
systemic exposure since they are both well absorbed molecules. 
Based  on  in  vitro  data,  the  major  routes  of  metabolism  of  both  fluticasone  furoate  and  vilanterol  in 
human  are  mediated  primarily  by  CYP3A4.  Fluticasone  furoate  is  primarily  metabolised  through 
hydrolysis  of  the  S-fluoromethyl  carbothioate  group  to  metabolites  with  significantly  reduced 
corticosteroid  activity.  Vilanterol  is  primarily  metabolised  by  O  dealkylation  to  a  range  of  metabolites 
with significantly reduced β1- and β2-agonist activity. 
Following oral administration, fluticasone furoate was eliminated in humans mainly by metabolism with 
metabolites  being  excreted  almost  exclusively  in  faeces,  with  <1%  of  the  recovered  radioactive  dose 
eliminated in the urine. Following oral administration, vilanterol was eliminated mainly by metabolism 
followed  by  excretion  of  metabolites  in  urine  and  faeces  approximately  70%  and  30%  of  the 
radioactive dose respectively in a human radiolabel study conducted by the oral route.  
In  adolescents  (12  years  or  older),  there  are  no  recommended  dose  modifications.  The 
pharmacokinetics  of  fluticasone  furoate/vilanterol  in  patients  less  than  12  years  of  age  has  not  been 
studied.  
The  effects  of  age  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  fluticasone  furoate  and  vilanterol  were  determined  in 
phase  III  studies  in  COPD  and  asthma.  There  was  no  evidence  for  age  (12-84)  to  affect  the 
pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate and vilanterol in subjects with asthma. There was no evidence 
for age to affect the pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate in subjects with COPD while there was an 
increase  (37%)  in  AUC  (0-24)  of  vilanterol  over  the  observed  age  range  of  41  to  84  years.  For  an 
elderly  subject  (aged  84  years)  with  low  bodyweight  (35  kg)  vilanterol  AUC  (0-24)  is  predicted to be 
35% higher than the population estimate (subject with COPD aged 60 years and bodyweight of 70 kg), 
whilst Cmax was unchanged. These differences are unlikely to be of clinical relevance. In subjects with 
asthma and subjects with COPD there are no recommended dose modifications. 
A  clinical  pharmacology  study  of  fluticasone  furoate/vilanterol  showed  that  severe  renal  impairment 
(creatinine clearance <30mL/min) did not result in significantly greater exposure to fluticasone furoate 
or  vilanterol  or  more  marked  corticosteroid  or  beta2-agonist  systemic  effects  compared  with  healthy 
subjects.  No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment.

Following repeat dosing of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol for 7 days, there was an increase in fluticasone 
furoate  systemic  exposure  (up  to  three-fold  as  measured  by  AUC(0–24))  in  subjects  with  hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh A, B or C) compared with healthy subjects. The increase in fluticasone furoate 
systemic  exposure  in  subjects  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  B;  fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol  184/22  micrograms)  was  associated  with  an  average  34%  reduction  in  serum 
cortisol  compared  with  healthy  subjects.  Dose-normalised  fluticasone  furoate  systemic  exposure  was 
similar in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C). Following repeat 
dosing  of  fluticasone  furoate/vilanterol  for  7  days,  there  was  no  significant  increase  in  systemic 
exposure to vilanterol (Cmax and AUC) in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh  A,  B  or  C).  There  were  no  clinically  relevant  effects  of  the  fluticasone  furoate/vilanterol 
combination on beta-adrenergic systemic effects (heart rate or serum potassium) in subjects with mild 
or  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (vilanterol,  22  micrograms)  or  with  severe  hepatic  impairment 
(vilanterol, 12.5 micrograms) compared with healthy subjects. 
There  was  no  evidence  for  race,  gender,  weight  or  BMI  (body  mass  index)  to  influence  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  fluticasone  furoate  based  on  a  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  of  phase  III 
data in 1213 subjects with asthma (712 females) and 1225 subjects with COPD (392 females).  There 
was no evidence for race, gender, weight or BMI to influence the pharmacokinetics of vilanterol based 
on  a  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  in  856  subjects  with  asthma  (500  females)  and  1091 
subjects with COPD (340 females). No dosage adjustment is necessary based on race, gender, weight 
or BMI. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Relvar  is  a  combination  of  two  active  ingredients,  fluticasone  furoate  and  vilanterol  trifenatate.  Both 
have complementary mechanisms of action. The precise mechanism through which fluticasone furoate 
affects asthma and COPD symptoms is not known, although it is supposed to be mediated through its 
anti-inflammatory  activity.  The  activity  of  vilanterol  is  mediated  through  increased  cyclic  AMP  levels, 
which cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle (bronchodilatory effect) and inhibition of release of 
mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.  
With  respect  to  VI  secondary  pharmacology,  systemic  effects  related  to  exposure  to  high  supra-
therapeutic doses of beta2-adrenoceptor agonists may include hypokalemia, hyperglycaemia and sinus 
tachycardia. VI (either alone or in combination) produced a slight reduction in blood potassium (<0.1 
mmol/L) at doses of 100 mcg and 0.24 mmol/L reduction at doses of 200 mcg. VI at doses above 25 
mcg  was  associated  with  small  but  statistically  significant  increases  in  heart  rate  compared  with 
placebo.  VI  at  the  proposed  therapeutic  dose  as  well  as  at  doses  up  to  50  mcg  was  not  consistently 
associated  with  clinically  relevant  or  statistically  significant  increases  in  blood  glucose.  In  healthy 
subjects and subjects with asthma or COPD, VI at doses up to 100 mcg was not consistently associated 
with clinically relevant or statistically significant effects on blood pressure after either single or repeat 
dose administration. Regarding FF secondary pharmacology, inhaled FF at repeat doses up to 400 mcg 
was  not  consistently  associated  with  statistically  significant  decreases  in  serum  or  urinary  cortisol.  At 
higher  doses  above  the  therapeutic  range  (up  to  1600  mcg)  corticosteroid  class-related  decreases  in 
serum  and  urine  cortisol  levels  were  seen.  Reduction  in  serum  cortisol  was  also  observed  in  subjects 
with moderate hepatic impairment after FF/VI 200/25 mcg and a similar effect would be anticipated in 
subjects  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  at  this  dose.  There  was  evidence  of  a  greater  reduction  in 
serum cortisol after repeat dose administration of FF 200 mcg in healthy Japanese subjects compared 
with Caucasian subjects.

In  the  thorough  QT  study  (study  HZA102936)  with  FF/VI  there  was  a  lack  of  effect  on  QTcF  or  on 
individually  corrected  QTc  (QTci)  at  the  proposed  upper  therapeutic  FF/VI  dose  (200/25  mcg  for  7 
days). All time-matched QTcF mean differences from placebo (0-24 h) were less than 5 msec with no 
upper 90% CI values greater than 10 msec.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  the  FF/VI  FDC  has  been  well  documented.  FF/VI  has  a 
pharmacokinetic  profile  with  low  potential  for  interactions  due  to  the  low  plasma  concentration 
achieved  after  inhaled  dosing.  Exposure  differences  based  on  gender,  age,  weight,  race,  renal 
impairment and mild hepatic impairment were estimated and were not considered clinically relevant. In 
hepatic impairment FF/VI’s exposure was increased (up to three-fold as measured by AUC) compared 
with healthy subjects after repeated dosing for 7 days. The maximum recommended dose of FF/VI in 
patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment is 92/22 for the treatment of asthma. 
The pharmacodynamics of FF/VI indicates that this compound is potentially efficient in the treatment of 
asthma  and  COPD.  The  pharmacodynamics  of  FF/VI  is  considered  to  be  adequately  characterised  by 
the studies performed in phase I. The results of these studies are appropriately reflected in the SmPC.

Selection of FF (GW685698X) dose and dose interval is supported by five studies. Two of them (studies 
FFA112202  and  FFA106783)  support  the  interval  of  OD  vs  BD  and  three,  the  strength  (studies 
FFA109687, FFA109685 and FFA109684).

Although the dose response to ICS for improved lung function is limited, it was considered that a single 
ICS strength would not meet the needs of all asthma patients therefore two doses of FF, 100 and 200 
mcg, were selected for combination with VI on the basis of results from three dose-ranging studies in 
subjects with persistent asthma (including subjects symptomatic on short-acting beta2-agonists [study 
FFA109687] and low to medium doses of ICS [studies FFA109684, FFA109685]) that tested a range of 
doses  of  FF  (from  25  mcg  to  800  mcg  once  daily,  dosed  in  the  evening).  Marketed  doses  of  FP  were 
also included for assay sensitivity. 
Results  for  different  FF  doses  on  trough  FEV1  from  the  three  dose  ranging  studies  in  subjects  with 
varying  severity  of  asthma  are  summarised  in  the  figure  below  and  show  substantial  efficacy  with  FF 
100 and near maximal efficacy with FF 200. 
Figure 1.  Adjusted  Treatment Differences From Placebo  of Change from Baseline in Trough 
FEV1 (L) (LOCF)at Week 8 Across FF Dose- Ranging Studies in Asthma 
In FFA109687, the FF 50 group failed to meet the pre-defined 200 mL difference from placebo (129 mL 
[95%  CI:  11,  247]),  although  this  difference  was  statistically  significant.  A  post  hoc  analysis  by 
baseline lung function confirmed that trough FEV1 improvements relative to placebo were substantially 
lower at 50 mcg (36 mL [95% CI: -181, 253]) than at 100 mcg (267 mL [95% CI: 70, 463]) or 200 
mcg  (190  mL  [95%  CI:  -6,  386])  in  subjects  with  more  severe  asthma  (FEV1  ≤65%  of  predicted 
normal).  As  a  consequence  it  was  concluded  that  FF  50  would  not  be  an  adequate  dose  for  patients 
who would be candidates for treatment with an ICS/LABA combination.

In  both  FFA109687  and  FFA109685,  a  small  incremental  improvement  for  FF  200  over  FF  100  was 
observed.  Additionally,  a  post  hoc  analysis  of  FFA109685  based  on  asthma  severity,  showed  that 
treatment  with  higher  doses  of  FF  in  subjects  with  more  severe  disease  (FEV1  ≤65%  of  predicted 
normal)  resulted  in  greater  improvements  in  FEV1  relative  to  placebo  than  for  similar  subjects  who 
received FF 100. Subjects treated with FF 200 achieved improvements of 125 mL [95% CI: -83, 334] 
which was almost double the improvement seen with FF 100 (67 mL [95% CI: -141, 275]). In Study 
FFA109684,  there  was  no  evidence  of  an  FF  dose  response  between  200  and  800  mcg.  Further 
differentiation  was  not  observed  in  a  post  hoc  analysis  in  subjects  with  more  severe  disease  (FEV1 
≤65%  of  predicted  of  normal)  and  all  doses  led  to  an  improvement  in  FEV1  that  was  at  least 
comparable  to  that  observed  with  FP  500  twice  daily.  Therefore,  two  strengths  of  FF/VI  (100/25  and 
200/25  mcg)  were  investigated  in  Phase  III  in  order  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  majority  of  asthma 
patients for whom ICS/LABA is considered appropriate.  
Study  FFA112202  (performed  in  subjects  with  asthma)  was  designed  to  ensure  the  comparability  of 
once- and twice-daily dosing (to confirm FF is an intrinsic once-daily ICS). Results demonstrated that 
FF 200 once daily was non-inferior to FF 100 twice daily (difference of the point estimate 0 mL [CI: -
49,  49)]  for  the  Per  Protocol  Population  and  11  mL:  [95%  CI:  -35,  56]  for  the  ITT  Population).  This 
study  had  sufficient  sensitivity  to  detect  a  difference  between  once-  and  twice-daily  dosing  since  a 
numerically  superior  improvement  in  FEV1  compared  with  placebo  was  observed  for  the  true  twice-
daily comparator, FP, at doses of 100 mcg twice daily compared with 200 mcg once daily. 
Based on the clinical response over a range of asthma severities, doses, and the fact that it is widely 
recognised  from treatment  guidelines  [GINA,  2011]  and  from  clinical  practice  that one  dose of  ICS  is 
not  suitable  for  all  severities  of  asthma,  FF  100  and  FF  200  were  selected  as  appropriate  doses  to 
combine  with  a  LABA  for  the  asthma  populations  under  study  in  the  Phase  III  programme.  This  was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The  effects  of  ICS  in  COPD  patients  cannot  be  assessed  reliably  in  short  term  studies  using  lung 
function parameters as an endpoint. Therefore, the Phase IIb dose-ranging studies with FF in subjects 
with asthma were used to guide the selection of doses of FF to be evaluated in the FF/VI combination 
in Phase III studies in subjects with COPD. As subjects with COPD generally have a greater degree of 
airflow obstruction, a lesser degree of reversibility to inhaled bronchodilators, and are less responsive 
to the effects of ICS on lung function, it was considered that the FF 50 dose would constitute the less 
effective/no effect dose in subjects with COPD. Therefore, three doses of FF (50, 100 and 200 mcg) in 
combination  with  VI  were  included  in  the  Phase  III  programme  to  define  the  optimal  dose  of  FF  for 
combination with VI in COPD patients. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
Vilanterol 
The 25 mcg dose of VI was selected for testing in the Phase III programmes for asthma and COPD on 
the  basis  of  results  from  separate  dose-ranging  studies  in  subjects  with  asthma  (study  B2C109575) 
and  in  subjects  with  COPD  (study  B2C111045),  which  tested  a  range  of  VI  doses  (3,  6.25,  12.5,  25 
and 50 mcg once daily).

Study B2C109575 in subjects with asthma receiving concomitant ICS, demonstrated that 25 mcg was 
the  appropriate  VI  dose  based  on  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  as  well  as  the  safety  profile. 
Neither the 3 nor the 6.25 mcg doses were significantly different from placebo for the primary endpoint 
of  trough  FEV1.  Although  once-daily  treatment  with  VI  12.5,  25  and  50  resulted  in  a  similar  level  of 
improvement  in  the  primary  endpoint  of  trough  FEV1  that  was  also  statistically  significantly  greater 
than  that  observed  with  placebo,  data  on  the  secondary  symptomatic  endpoints  of  rescue-free  and 
symptom-free  24-hour  periods  showed  nearly  double  the  effect  for  VI  25  compared  with  VI  12.5. 
Additionally, fewer than 50% of subjects treated with the 12.5 mcg dose showed an improvement from 
baseline in FEV1 of at least 12% and 200 mL (a predefined improvement that is generally accepted to 
represent  reversibility  to  bronchodilators  [GINA,  2011])  at  any  timepoint  across  a  24-hour  period  at 
Day 28 compared with 47% to 71% at any timepoint for 25 mcg, supporting the use of a dose of VI of 
at  least  25  mcg.  There  appeared  to  be  only  a  small  additional  benefit  conferred  by  the  50  mcg  dose 
compared with the 25 mcg dose, indicating that VI 25 mcg was the appropriate dose for subjects with 
asthma. 
These data in asthma were supported by dose-finding data in subjects with COPD, from which a dose 
of  25  mcg  was  also  identified  as  the  appropriate  dose  for  use  in  the  treatment  of  COPD.  Specifically, 
the 25 mcg dose of VI was selected for evaluation in Phase III on the basis of results in the Phase IIb 
study  in  subjects  with  COPD  (Study  B2C111045),  which  demonstrated  that  based  on  primary  and 
secondary  endpoints  as  well  as  the  safety  profile,  25  mcg  was  the  appropriate  dose  to  progress. 
Although all VI doses were statistically significantly different from placebo for the primary endpoint of 
trough FEV1, compared with placebo, adjusted mean treatment differences of ≥130 mL in trough FEV1 
(the  treatment  difference on  which  the  study  was  powered)  were  observed  with  VI  25  and  VI  50  but 
not with lower doses.

The  dosing  interval  for  VI  was  investigated  in  Study  HZA113310,  which  was  designed  to  compare 
once- and twice-daily dosing, to confirm VI is an intrinsic once-daily LABA. The dose of VI selected for 
this  comparison  (12.5  mcg  once  daily)  was  less  than  the  25  mcg  dose  selected  for  progression  to 
Phase III in order to assure that the assessment was not made on the upper part of the doseresponse 
curve  where  differences  between  dose  regimens  would  be  more  difficult  to  detect.  Weighted  mean 
FEV1 (0-24 hour) on Day 7 was almost identical between VI 6.25 twice daily and VI 12.5 once daily (LS 
mean  difference  from  placebo  of  166  mL  and  168  mL,  respectively),  indicating  comparable 
improvements  regardless  of  whether  the  same  total  nominal  dose  was  administered  once  daily  or 
divided  and  administered  twice  daily.  Weighted  mean  was  considered  a  better  measure  than  trough 
FEV1 to compare the efficacy over a comparable time interval (e.g., 24 hours) rather than at a single 
point  (e.g.,  trough),  which,  based  on  the  timepoint  selected,  could  give  an  unfair  advantage  to  one 
regimen over the other. 
As a consequence of all these data in subjects with either asthma or COPD, VI 25 mcg once daily was 
selected  as  the  appropriate  dose  to  propose  for  marketing  as  part  of  the  FF/VI  combination  for  both 
patient populations. 
AM versus PM dosing 
The  asthma  programme  was  conducted  with  evening  dosing  whereas  the  COPD  programme  was 
conducted  with  morning  dosing.  It  is  recognized  that  due  to  lifestyles  (e.g.  work  schedules)  some 
patients  might  find  it  more  convenient  to  dose  their  medication  in  the  morning  as  opposed  to  the 
evening  or  vice  versa.  Study  HZA114624    demonstrated  that  FF/VI  100/25,  whether  dosed  in  the 
morning  or  evening  resulted  in  a  clinically  significant  and  comparable  increase  in  FEV1  at  all  time 
points  over  0-24  hours  on  Day  14.  In  comparison  with  placebo,  there  was  little  indication  of  diurnal 
variation  in  FEV1  after  FF/VI  (morning  or  evening)  with  no  evidence  of  the  early  morning  nadir  seen 
with  placebo.  These  data  support  the  dosing  recommendation  that  FF/VI  may  be  dosed  in  either  the 
morning or evening. 
The results of this study, which studied bronchodilatation in subjects with asthma, can be extrapolated 
to the COPD population as there is no reason to believe the diurnal response to bronchodilators would 
differ between asthma and COPD. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Asthma 
The  clinical  development  program  to  support  the  approval  of  FF/VI  in  asthma  included  efficacy  data 
from a total of 16 completed clinical studies (7 Phase III and 9 Phase II studies). The Phase III studies 
were  performed  using  the  final  formulation  and  final  inhaler  (NDPI).  Three  studies  are  considered 
pivotal for the evaluation of this dossier (studies HZA106827, HZA106829 and HZA106837) and two as 
supportive (studies HZA113091 and HZA106851).

Study HZA 106827 
Methods 
Study  HZA106827  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  (with  rescue  medication), 
parallel group multi-centre study of Fluticasone Furoate/GW642444 Inhalation Powder and Fluticasone 
Furoate Inhalation Powder alone in the treatment of persistent asthma in adults and adolescents. 
Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria 
Outpatients of either sex aged ≥12 years at Visit 1 (Screening) (or ≥18 years of age if local regulation 
or  the  regulatory  status  of  study  medication  permit  enrolment  of  adults  only),  with  a  diagnosis  of 
asthma (as defined by the National Institutes of Health [NIH, 2007]) for at least 12 weeks prior to Visit 
1 (Screening) were eligible for this study. All subjects were to be using an ICS, with or without LABA, 
for at least 12 weeks prior to Visit 1. In addition, all subjects were either to have been maintained on a 
stable low to mid ICS dose (Fluticasone Propionate (FP) 100 - 250mcg twice daily or equivalent) for at 
least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1, or to have been maintained on a stable dose of an ICS/LABA low-dose 
combination  product  (e.g.,  SERETIDE™/ADVAIR™  100/50  twice-daily  or  equivalent  via  other 
combination  products  or  via  separate  inhalers)  for  at  least  4  weeks  prior  to  Visit  1.  Subjects  taking 
Symbicort  as  needed  were  to  switch  to  Symbicort  maintenance  dosing  with  use  of  a  short-acting 
beta2-agonist (SABA) for symptom relief at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. 
LABA therapy was not permitted beginning on the day of Visit 1 (last dose of LABA was taken on day 
prior to Visit 1). Combination therapy had to be stopped at Visit 1 and subjects switched to the same 
ICS  dose  of  the  same  ICS  for  the  Run-in  Period.  All  subjects  had  to  be  able  to  replace  their  current 
SABA treatment with salbutamol/albuterol aerosol inhaler at Visit 1 for use as needed for the duration 
of the study, and withhold salbutamol/albuterol for at least 6 hours prior to study visits. 
Subjects were to have a best pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of 40% to 90% of the predicted normal value at 
Visit 1. Predicted values were based upon NHANES III [Hankinson, 2010]. If a subject was recorded as 
having Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, then the Mexican-American adjustments were used (irrespective of 
race). If a subject was recorded as being of African-American/African heritage race, then the African-
American  adjustments  were  used.  If  a  subject  was  recorded  as  being  of  Asian  race,  then  the  Asian 
adjustment was used. Otherwise, the Caucasian equations were used. 
Subjects  had  to  demonstrate  a  ≥12%  and  ≥200  mL  reversibility  of  FEV1  within  10-40  minutes 
following 2-4 inhalations of salbutamol/albuterol inhalation aerosol (or equivalent nebulised treatment 
with salbutamol/albuterol solution) at Visit 1.

respiratory  infection  that  had  not  resolved  within  4  weeks  of  Visit  1  and  led  to  a  change  in  asthma 
management  or  was  expected  to  affect  the  subject’s  asthma  status  or  ability  to  participate  in  the 
study.  Subjects  could  not  have  experienced  any  asthma  exacerbation  requiring  oral  corticosteroids 
within 12 weeks of Visit 1, or that resulted in overnight hospitalisation or emergency room attendance 
requiring additional treatment for asthma within 6 months prior to Visit 1. Subjects could not have any 
concurrent respiratory disease or any clinically significant, uncontrolled condition or disease states. 
Subjects  could  have  no  visual  evidence  of  candidiasis  at  Visit  1,  could  not  have  used  any 
investigational  drug  within  30  days  prior  to  Visit  1  or  within  five  half-lives  (t½)  of  the  prior 
investigational  study,  could  not  have  used  inhaled  tobacco  products  within  the  previous  3  months  or 
have  historical  use  of  10  pack  years,  severe  milk  protein  allergy  or  specific  drug  allergies,  or  used 
prohibited  medications  within  the  specified  time  periods.  A  subject  could  not  have  previously  been 
randomised  to  treatment  in  another  Phase  III  FF/VI  combination  product  study.  No  subject  was 
permitted  to  perform  night  shift  work  for  1  week  prior  to  Visit  1  until  completion  of  the  study 
Treatment Period. A subject was not eligible if they or their parent or legal guardian had any infirmity, 
disability, disease, or geographical location which might have impaired compliance with any aspect of 
this  study  protocol.  No  subject  was  permitted  if  who  was  an  immediate  family  member  of  the 
investigator, sub-investigator, study coordinator, or employee of the participating investigator. 
Inclusion criteria for randomisation to treatment 
At  the  end  of  the  Run-in  Period  (Visit  3),  a  subject  was  eligible  to  enter  the  treatment  period  of  the 
study if he/she met the following randomisation criteria: 
1.  Evening pre-dose FEV1 of between 40% and 90% of their predicted normal at Visit 3. 
2.  Demonstrated  and  reported  in  an  eDiary,  symptoms  of  asthma  (a  score  of  ≥1  on  daytime  or 
night-time asthma symptom scores) and/or daily albuterol/salbutamol use on ≥ 4 of the last 7 
consecutive days of the Run-in Period. 
3.  Subjects  recorded  the  use  of  Run-in  asthma  controller  medication  on  ≥4  of  the  last  7

Exclusion criteria for randomisation to treatment 
1.  Evidence  of  clinically  significant  abnormal  laboratory  tests  during  Visit  1  which  were  still 
abnormal  upon  repeat  analysis  and  were  not  believed  to  be  due  to  disease(s)  present.  Each 
investigator used his/her discretion in determining the clinical significance of the abnormality. 
2.  Changes  in  asthma  medication  (excluding  salbutamol/albuterol  inhalation  aerosol  provided  at 
Visit 1). 
3.  Occurrence  of  a  culture-documented  or  suspected  bacterial  or  viral  infection  of  the  upper  or 
lower  respiratory  tract,  sinus  or  middle  ear  during  the  Run-in  Period  that  led  to  a  change  in 
asthma management or, in the opinion of the investigator, was expected to affect the subject’s 
asthma status or the subject’s ability to participate in the study. 
4.  Evidence  of  significant  abnormality  in  the  12-lead  ECG  performed  at  Visit  2  and/or  Visit  3  (in

7.  Subject was unable to use the inhaler correctly after 3 separate demonstrations at Visit 3. 
Treatments 
The  Applicant  provided  the  investigational  products  in  an  NDPI  for  use  in  this  study.  Subjects  were 
assigned to one of the following study medications which were supplied in this study. 
Trade label salbutamol/albuterol inhalation aerosol were provided locally by each country participating 
in  the  trial  (except  for  US  sites  where  GSK  Global  Supplies  Operations  [GSO UK]  supplied the  rescue 
medication)  and  was  given  to  all  subjects  to  use  as  required  throughout  the  study  to  treat  asthma 
symptoms. 
Any study inhaler that failed to function properly was identified to the Applicant’s personnel for return 
to  the  Applicant  for  testing.  Details  of  the  failure  were  documented  in  the  eCRF.  The  subject  had  to 
return  the  inhaler  to  the  clinic  as  soon  as  possible  and  avoid  missing  any  doses.  The  site  staff  then 
notified the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) and obtained a new treatment pack number for 
that subject and dispensed a new study medication kit from the site's investigational product supply as 
instructed by the IVRS. 
No extension to the study was planned and no post-study treatment was available. Investigators were 
advised  to  prescribe  asthma  medication  appropriate  to  the  severity  of  the  subject’s  asthma  in 
accordance with asthma guidelines (e.g. [GINA 2009; NIH, 2007]). 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of FF/VI Inhalation Powder 
100 mcg/25 mcg and FF 100 mcg both administered once-daily in the evening in adolescent and adult 
subjects,  12  years  of  age  and  older,  with  persistent  bronchial  asthma  over  a  12-week  treatment 
period.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Co-primary endpoint 
•  Mean change from baseline in clinic visit trough (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 at the 
end of the 84-day treatment period in all subjects. 
•  Weighted mean serial FEV1 over 0-24 hours post-dose calculated in a subset of subjects at the 
end  of  the  84-day  double-blind  treatment  period.  24-hour  serial  FEV1  included  post-dose 
assessments after 5, 15, 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 16, 20, 23 and 24 hours. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
•  Mean  change  from  baseline  in  the  percentage  of  rescue-free  24-hour  periods  during  the  12-
week treatment period, captured daily via electronic patient diary (eDiary). 
•  Change from baseline in the percentage of symptom-free 24-hour periods during the 12-week 
treatment period, captured daily via electronic patient diary (eDiary). 
•  Change from baseline in total AQLQ (+12) score at the end of 12-week treatment period. 
• 
The number of withdrawals due to lack of efficacy during the 12-week treatment period. 
Sample size 
Approximately 570 subjects were randomised in a ratio of 1:1:1 to give 190 randomised subjects per 
arm. The sample size calculation assumed a 5% withdrawal rate in the first 2 weeks of the study and a 
15% withdrawal rate over the whole treatment period of the study. This ensured 180 subjects per arm 
who  contributed  to  the  analysis  of  trough  FEV1  and  the  analysis  of  %  rescue-free  24-hour  periods. 
60%  of  all  randomised  subjects  had  serial  FEV1  measurements  at  Week  12  if  they  completed  the 
treatment period. A 15% withdrawal rate ensured 96 subjects per arm who contributed to the analysis 
of weighted mean serial FEV1 over 0-24 hours at Week 12. 
The  assumptions  of  a  standard  deviation  of  405  mL for  trough  FEV1,  325  mL  for  0-24  hour  weighted 
mean  FEV1  and  30%  for  the  percentage  of  rescue-free  days  were  based  on  estimates  from  previous 
studies  along  with  an  update  using  recent  FF  and  VI  Phase  II  study  data  and  used  a  significance 
declared at the two-sided 5% significance level. 
Randomisation 
Assignment of subject number 
At  Visit  1,  a  unique  Subject  Number  was  assigned  to  any  subject  who  had  at  least  one  Visit  1 
procedure  performed,  other  than  informed  consent.  The  unique  Subject  Number  was  used  to  identify 
individual subjects during the course of the study. 
Assignment of treatment number 
At Visit 3, subjects meeting the eligibility criteria were stratified according to the use of LABA at Visit 1. 
These  eligible  subjects  were  assigned  to  study  treatment  in  accordance  with  the  randomisation 
schedule  by  IVRS,  which  confirmed  the  subject’s  CRF  number  (Subject  Number)  and  provided  two 
additional types of numbers: 
•  A  treatment  pack  number  that  identified  the  double-blind  medication  to  be  dispensed  to  the 
subject. 
•  A randomisation number which was assigned from the randomisation schedule.

Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study, so neither the subject nor the investigator knew which study medication 
the subject was receiving. This study utilised IVRS for emergency unblinding. 
Statistical methods 
The  primary  analysis  for  both  co-primary  endpoints  was  performed  using  an  Analysis  of  Covariance 
(ANCOVA)  model  allowing  for  the  effects  due  to  baseline  (pre-dose  measurement  on  Day  0)  FEV1, 
region, sex, age and treatment group. 
Estimated  treatment  differences  for  treatment  comparisons  were  presented  together  with  95% 
Confidence Intervals (CIs) for the mean differences and p-values for comparisons, as appropriate. 
For the analysis of trough FEV1, Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) was used to impute missing 
data. A supporting analysis was also performed using a Repeated Measures Mixed Model. Missing data 
were  not  implicitly  imputed  in  this  analysis;  however,  all  non-missing  data  for  a  subject  were  used 
within the analysis to estimate the Day 84 treatment effects. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A  total  of  1110  subjects  were  screened  for  this  study,  of  which  379  (34%)  were  screen  failures  and 
120 (11%) failed the Run-in. The most common reason for Screen failure was not meeting the entry 
criteria  (33%),  while  the  most  common  reason  for  Runin  failure  was  that  the  subject  did  not  meet 
continuation criteria (9%). 
A total of 610 subjects were randomised to treatment and 609 were in the Intent-to-Treat population, 
of  which  the  majority,  515  (85%)  completed  and  94  (15%)  withdrew  prematurely  (see  table  below). 
The most common primary reason for withdrawal was lack of efficacy, which was given by 45 subjects 
(7%). The percentage of subjects giving lack of efficacy as the primary reason for withdrawal was 16% 
in the placebo group, 3% in the FF 100 group and 3% in the FF/VI 100/25 group (see table below).

Conduct of the study 
There  were  two  amendments  (one  local  and  one  global)  to  the  original  clinical  trial  protocol.  These 
amendments were considered not influencing the study results. 
Baseline data 
The study demographics show that a slightly higher percentage of subjects in the ITT population were 
female (58%) than male (42%) and the mean age was 39.7 years. A total of 82 subjects (13%) were 
adolescents, i.e. aged 12 years to less than 18 years. The majority of subjects were white (84%) and 
not Hispanic/Latino (94%) (see table below).

Table 26.  Summary of Demographic Characteristics (ITT Population) 
Subjects  had  a  similar  duration  of  asthma  across  all  treatments  (11.31  to  13.19  years)  with  92%  to 
95% across all treatment groups reporting a duration of asthma of at least one year or more. 
Mean  pre-  and  post-salbutamol  FEV1  values  at  Screening  and  mean  pre-salbutamol  FEV1  values  at 
baseline were similar across the treatment groups. The overall percent predicted FEV1 was 67.59% at 
screening, with an improvement to 70.43% at baseline (Visit 3) (see table below). Subjects had similar 
reversibility  to  salbutamol  across  the  treatments,  with  an  overall  mean  FEV1  reversibility  of  28.71%, 
and absolute reversibility of 614.2 mL.

Outcomes and estimation 
The  co-primary  endpoints were  mean  change  from  baseline  in  trough  FEV1 at  Week  12  (all  subjects) 
and  weighted  mean  serial  FEV1  over  0-24  hours  in  a  subset  of  subjects  at  Week  12.  Baseline  was 
defined  as  the  pre-dose  value  obtained  at  Visit  3  (Day  0)  and  trough  was  defined  as  the  pre-dose 
measurement  taken  at  the  clinic  visit  while  still  on-treatment.  The  pre-dose  measurement  taken  at 
Visit 7 (Week 12) was used for the co-primary endpoint. 
Trough FEV1 at Week 12 
The  mean  trough  FEV1  values  ranged  from  2.576  L  to  2.698  L  across  the  treatment  groups. 
.Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) were observed in favour of both the FF/VI 100/25 and FF 
100  treatments  relative  to  placebo;  no  statistically  significant  difference  was  observed  between  the 
FF/VI 100/25 and FF 100 treatments (see table below). 
Table 29.  Statistical  Analysis  of  Change  from  Baseline  in  Trough  FEV1  (L)  (LOCF)  at  Week 
12 (ITT Population) 
A repeated measures analysis of trough FEV1 (adjusted for baseline, region, sex, age, treatment, visit, 
visit  by  baseline  interaction  and  visit  by  treatment  interaction)  was  consistent  with  the  primary 
analysis  and  showed  statistically  significant  differences  between  FF  100  and  placebo  and  between 
FF/VI  100/25  and  placebo  at  all  timepoints.  However,  there  remained  no  statistically  significant 
difference between the two active treatments throughout the study. 
For analysis of trough FEV1 at Week 12, excluding Investigator 171806 and excluding both Investigator 
0406088  and  Investigator  171806,  the  results  were  entirely  consistent  with  those  seen  for  the  ITT 
population. 
Weighted Mean FEV1 (0-24 h) at Week 12 
The weighted mean FEV1 values ranged from 2.599 L to 2.861 L. 
Similarly  to  the  trough  FEV1  endpoint,  statistically  significant  differences  (p<0.05)  were  observed  in 
favour of both the FF/VI 100/25 and FF 100 treatments relative to placebo; no statistically significant 
difference was observed between the FF/VI 100/25 and FF 100 treatments (see table below).

Table 30.  Statistical  Analysis  of  Change  from  Baseline  in Weighted  Mean  FEV1  (L)  (0-24  h) 
at Week 12 (ITT Population, Subset Analysis) 
Similar  outcomes  were  observed  following  analysis  of  the  co-primary  endpoints  using  the  PP 
population. 
The  results  for  the  weighted  mean  (0-24  h)  FEV1  at  Week  12  excluding  Investigator  171806  were 
identical to the results for the overall ITT population as this investigator’s subjects were not part of the 
subset  that  performed  serial  FEV1  measurements.  The  results  excluding  both  Investigator  0406088 
and Investigator 171806  were consistent with the results seen for the ITT population with respect to 
the  treatment  differences of  FF/VI  100/25  and  FF 100  relative  to placebo.  Exclusion  of the  data  from 
both investigator sites produced the same absolute treatment difference between FF/VI 100/25 and FF 
100 as seen with the ITT population (116 mL) but the p-value changed from 0.060 to 0.045.

Methods 
Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria 
Outpatients of either sex aged ≥12 years at Visit 1 (Screening) (or ≥18 years of age if local regulations 
or  the  regulatory  status  of  study  medication  permit  enrolment  of  adults  only),  with  a  diagnosis  of 
asthma (as defined by the National Institutes of Health [NIH, 2007]) for at least 12 weeks prior to Visit 
1 (Screening) were eligible for this study. All subjects were to be using an ICS, with or without LABA, 
for at least 12 weeks prior to Visit 1. In addition, subjects were to either have been maintained on a 
stable  ICS  dose  (FP  500  BD  or  equivalent)  for  4  weeks  prior  to  Visit  1,  or  were  to  have  been 
maintained  on  a  stable  dose  of  an  ICS/LABA  mid-dose  combination  product  (e.g.,  SERETIDE/ADVAIR 
250/50 twice daily or equivalent via other combination products or via separate inhalers) for at least 4 
weeks prior to Visit 1. Subjects taking Symbicort as needed were to switch to Symbicort maintenance 
dosing with use of a SABA for symptom relief at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. 
LABA therapy was not permitted beginning on the day of Visit 1 (Screening). 
Combination therapy was to be stopped at Visit 1 and subjects switched to the same ICS dose for the 
Run-In  Period.  All  subjects  had  to  be  able  to  replace  their  current  SABA  treatment  with 
albuterol/salbutamol  aerosol  inhaler  at  Visit  1  for  use  as  needed  for  the  duration  of  the  study,  and 
withhold albuterol/salbutamol for at least 6 hours prior to study visits. 
Subjects were to have a best pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of 40% to 90% of the predicted normal value at 
Visit  1  (Screening).  Predicted  values  were  based  upon  National  Health  and  Nutrition  Examination 
Survey  (NHANES)  III  [Hankinson,  2010].  If  a  subject  was  recorded  as  having  Hispanic  or  Latino 
ethnicity, then the Mexican-American equations were to be used (irrespective of race). If a subject was 
recorded as being of African-American/African heritage race, then the African-American equations were 
to  be  used.  If  a  subject  was  recorded  as  being  of  Asian  race,  then  the  Asian  adjustment  was  to  be 
used. Otherwise, the Caucasian equation was to be used. 
Subjects  had  to  demonstrate  a  ≥12%  and  ≥200  mL  evening  reversibility  of  FEV1  within  10  to  40 
minutes  following  two  to  four  inhalations  of  albuterol/salbutamol  inhalation  aerosol  (or  equivalent 
nebulised treatment with albuterol/salbutamol solution) at Visit 1. 
Exclusion criteria 
Subjects could not have a history of life-threatening asthma within the last 10 years or any respiratory 
infection that had not resolved within 4 weeks of Visit 1 and led to a change in asthma management or 
was expected to affect the subject’s asthma status or ability to participate in the study. Subjects could 
not have experienced any asthma exacerbation requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids within 12 
weeks of Visit 1, or that resulted in overnight hospitalisation or emergency room attendance requiring 
additional  treatment  for  asthma  within  6  months  prior  to  Visit  1.  Subjects  could  not  have  any 
concurrent respiratory disease or any clinically significant, uncontrolled condition or disease states. 
Relvar Ellipta  
Assessment report  
EMA/282960/2013

Subjects  could  have  no  visual  evidence  of  candidiasis  at  Visit  1,  could  not  have  used  any 
investigational drug within 30 days prior to Visit 1, or within five half-lives of the prior investigational 
drug,  could  not  have  used  inhaled  tobacco  products  in  the  3  months  prior  to  Screening  or  have 
historical  use  of  ≥10-pack  years,  severe  milk  protein  allergy  or  specific  drug  allergies,  or  used 
prohibited  medications  within  the  specified  time  periods.  A  subject  could  not  have  previously  been 
randomised  to  treatment  in  another  Phase  III  FF/VI  combination  product  study.  No  subject  was 
permitted  to  perform  night  shift  work  for  1  week  prior  to  Visit  1  until  completion  of  the  study 
Treatment Period. A subject was not eligible if they or their parent or legal guardian had any infirmity, 
disability, disease, or geographical location which might have impaired compliance with any aspect of 
the  study  protocol.  No  subject  was  permitted  who  was  an  immediate  family  member  of  the 
investigator, sub-investigator, study coordinator, or employee of the participating investigator. 
Randomisation Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria 
At the end of the Run-In Period (Visit 3), a subject was eligible to enter the Treatment Period of the 
study if they met the following criteria: 
1.  Evening pre-dose FEV1 of between 40% and 90% of their predicted normal at Visit 3. 
2.  Demonstrated and reported in an eDiary, symptoms of asthma (a score of ≥3 on the combined 
daytime  or  night-time  asthma  symptom  scale)  and/or  daily  albuterol/salbutamol  on  at  least 
four of the last seven consecutive days of the Run-In Period. 
3.  Recorded use of run-in asthma controller medication use on at least 4 of the last 7 consecutive 
days of the Run-In Period. 
4.  Compliance with completion of the eDiary reporting, defined as completion of all questions on 
at least 4 out of the last 7 consecutive days of the Run-in Period. 
Subjects were not eligible for randomisation to double-blind treatment if they met any of the following 
criteria at Visit 3: 
1.  Evidence  of  clinically  significant  abnormal  laboratory  tests  during  Visit  1  which  were  still 
abnormal upon repeat testing and were not believed to be due to the disease(s) present. Each 
investigator was to use his or her own discretion in determining the clinical significance of the 
abnormality. 
2.  Changes  in  asthma  medication  (excluding  albuterol/salbutamol  inhalation  aerosol  provided  at 
Visit 1). 
3.  Occurrence  of  a  culture-documented  or  suspected  bacterial  or  viral  infection  of  the  upper  or 
lower  respiratory  tract,  sinus  or  middle  ear  during  the  Run-In  Period  that  led  to  a  change  in 
asthma management or, in the opinion of the investigator, was expected to affect the subject’s 
asthma status or the subject’s ability to participate in the study. 
4.  Evidence of significant abnormality in the 12-lead ECG performed at Visit 2 and/or Visit 3. 
5.  Evidence  of  a  severe  exacerbation,  defined  as  deterioration  of  asthma  requiring  the  use  of 
systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection) for at least 3 days or an in-patient 
hospitalisation  or  emergency  department  visit  due  to  asthma  that  required  systemic 
corticosteroids between Visits 1 and 3. 
6.  Clinical visual evidence of oral candidiasis at the Randomisation Visit (Visit 3).

Treatments 
Table 31.  Description of Study Treatments 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of FF/VI inhalation powder 
200 mcg/25 mcg administered once daily each evening to FF inhalation powder 200 mcg administered 
alone  once  daily  each  evening  in  adolescent  and  adult  subjects  12  years  of  age  and  older  with 
persistent bronchial asthma over a 24-week Treatment Period. 
The  secondary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  of  FF  200  mcg  administered  once 
daily each evening with FP 500 mcg administered twice daily. 
In  addition,  the  safety  of  FF  200  mcg  and  FP  500  mcg  was  assessed  over  the  24-week  Treatment 
Period.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Co-primary endpoints 
•  Mean change from baseline in clinic visit trough (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 at the 
end  of  the  168-day  (24  week)  Treatment  Period  in  all  subjects.  FEV1  was  measured  in  the 
evening  at  Clinic  Visit  1,  and  Visits  3  to  10  between  5:00  PM  and  11:00  PM  electronically  by 
spirometry. The highest of three technically acceptable measurements was recorded. 
•  Weighted  mean  serial  FEV1  over  0  to  24  hours  post-dose,  calculated  in  a  subset  of  subjects 
performing  serial  FEV1  at  the  end  of  the  double-blind  Treatment  Period.  Twenty-four-hour 
serial  FEV1  included  pre-dose  assessment  within  5  minutes  prior  to  dosing,  and  post-dose 
assessments after 5, 15 and 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 16, 20, 23 and 24 hours.  
Secondary endpoints 
•  Mean  change  from  baseline  in  the  percentage  of  rescue-free  24-hour  periods  during  the  24-
week Treatment Period. 
•  Change from baseline in the percentage of symptom-free 24-hour periods during the 24-week 
Treatment Period. 
•  Change from baseline in total AQLQ (12+) score at the end of 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. 
The  AQLQ  (12+)  questionnaire  helps  to  measure  the  functional  problems  that  are  most 
troublesome to subjects with asthma. It contains 32 items in four domains: activity limitation 
(11  items),  symptoms  (12  items),  emotional  function  (five  items)  and  environmental  stimuli 
(four items). The response format consists of a seven-point scale where a value of 1 indicates 
“total  impairment”  and  a  value  of  7  indicates  “no  impairment”.  The  32  items  of  the 
questionnaire are averaged to produce the total AQLQ (12+) score.  
Sample size 
It was planned to randomise a total of 588 subjects into this study in a ratio of 1:1:1 (196 subjects per 
arm). It was anticipated that there would be a 4% withdrawal rate for the first 2 weeks, which would 
still ensure 188 subjects per arm who contribute to the analysis of trough FEV1 and the analysis of % 
rescue-free  24-hour  periods.  Sixty  percent  of  all  randomised  subjects  would  have  had  serial  FEV1 
measurements  at  Week  24  if  they  completed  the  Treatment  Period.  It  was  anticipated  that  15%  of 
subjects  would  withdraw  over  the  entire  Treatment  Period  of  the  study,  which  would  still  ensure  that 
99  subjects  per  arm  contributed  to  the  analysis  of  weighted  mean  serial  FEV1  over  0  to  24  hours  at 
Week 24. 
With 188 subjects per arm with a trough FEV1 value, this study had 95% power to detect a treatment 
difference  of  150  mL  in  change  from  baseline  in  trough  FEV1  between  the  FF/VI  combination  and  FF 
alone.  This  assumed  a  common  standard  deviation  (SD)  of  405  mL  (based  on  previous  studies)  and 
significance  declared  at  the  2-sided  5%  significance  level.  From  the  subset  of  60%  of  randomised 
subjects, 99 subjects per arm were expected to complete the Treatment Period giving this study 96% 
power  to  detect  a  treatment  difference  of  175  mL  in  weighted  mean  serial  FEV1  over  0  to  24  hours 
between  the  FF/VI  combination  and  FF  alone.  This  assumed  a  common  SD  of  325  mL  (based  on 
previous studies) and significance declared at the two-sided 5% significance level. The overall power of 
the study to detect treatment differences for both primary endpoints was 92%.

Randomisation 
At Visit 1, a unique subject number, that identified the subject throughout the study, was assigned to 
any subject who had at least one Visit 1 procedure performed, other than informed consent. 
At Visit 3 (Randomisation Visit), subjects meeting the eligibility criteria were stratified according to the 
use of LABA at Screening (Visit 1) and assigned to study treatment through a telephone call to IVRS, in 
accordance  with  the  randomisation  schedule.  During  this  call,  the  IVRS  confirmed  the  subject’s  CRF 
number (subject number) and provided two additional types of numbers: 
• 
Two  treatment  pack  numbers  that  identified  the  double-blind  medications  that  were  to  be 
dispensed  to  the  subject  from  the  investigator’s  inventory;  one  for  the  NDPI  and  one  for  the 
DISKUS/ACCUHALER. 
•  A randomisation number assigned from a computer-generated randomisation schedule created 
by the Applicant. 
Blinding (masking) 
This  was  a  double-blind  double-dummy  study.  Study  medications  taken  during  the  Treatment  Period 
were double-blind and double dummy (identical appearance and regimen). Neither the subject nor the 
investigator  knew  which  study  medication  the  subject  was  receiving.  This  study  utilised  an  IVRS  for 
emergency  unblinding.  The  treatment  assignment  could  be  obtained  by  calling  the  registration  and 
medication ordering system IVRS. 
Statistical methods 
The primary treatment comparison was FF/VI 200/25 OD combination versus FF 200 OD alone for the 
co-primary  efficacy  endpoints  (mean  change  from  baseline  in  clinic  visit  trough  FEV1  and  weighted 
mean  FEV1  over  0  to  24  hours  at  the  end  of  the  24-week  Treatment  Period).  The  primary  analyses 
were performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). 
Results 
Participant flow 
A  total  of  1206  subjects  were  screened  for  this  study  from  six  countries  (Russia,  the  US,  Romania, 
Germany, Poland and Japan) and 63 centres; 478 (40%) of the subjects screened were withdrawn at 
the  Screening  Visit  (Screen  Failures),  primarily  because  they  did  not  meet  the  protocol-defined 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of the 728 subjects who entered the Run-In Period, 141 subjects (12% of 
the  Total  Population)  were  withdrawn  prior  to  being  randomised  (Run-in  Failures).  The  majority  of 
subjects  who  did  not  complete  the  Run-In  Period  failed  to  meet  the  protocol-specified  continuation 
criteria.

Table 32.  Screen and Run-In Failures (Study HZA106829, Total Population) 
A  total  of  586  subjects  completed  the  Screening  and  Run-in  Periods,  were  randomly  assigned  to 
treatment,  and  received  at  least  one  dose  of  double-blind  study  medication  in  the  Treatment  Period. 
These  subjects  comprised  the  ITT  Population.  In  addition,  Subject  9829  was  randomised  in  error  but 
did not receive study drug. This subject was not included in the ITT Population.  
Eighty-one  percent  of  subjects  across  the  treatment  groups  completed  the  study,  and  attendance  at 
each scheduled clinic visit was high. A slightly higher percentage of subjects withdrew from the FF 200 
OD  treatment  group  (25%)  compared  with  the  FF/VI  200/25  OD  group  (14%)  and  the  FP  500  BD 
group (17%). 
Lack  of  efficacy  resulted  in  premature  withdrawal  of  11%  of  subjects  in  the  FF  200  OD  group, 
compared with 3% of the FF/VI 200/25 OD group and 9% of the FP 500 BD group. The most common 
subreason for withdrawal due to lack of efficacy was PEF (recorded in the electronic diary) being below 
the PEF stability limit calculated at Visit 3. 
Withdrawal  of  consent  was  the  next  most  common  reason  for  premature  withdrawal  with  7%  of 
subjects in the FF 200 OD group, 2% of subjects in the FF/VI 200/25 OD group and 4% of subjects in 
the  FP  500  BD  group  withdrawing  consent.  No  other  reason  for  withdrawal  was  responsible  for  more 
than 2% of subjects withdrawing from the study.

Baseline data 
The  demographic  characteristics  of  the  ITT  Population  are  summarised  in  the  table  below.  Within  the 
ITT  Population,  the  majority  of  the  subjects  were  White  (84%)  and  female  (59%).  Overall,  2%  of 
subjects  were  of  Hispanic/Latino  ethnicity,  and  the  mean  age  was  approximately  46  years.  A  total of 
23 subjects (4%) were aged ≤18 years at Screening. 
The demographic characteristics of the PP Population were similar to those of the ITT Population (see 
table below).

Table 34.  Demographics (HZA106829, ITT Population) 
Asthma  history  was  similar  across  the  treatment  groups  (see  table  below).  The  majority  of  subjects 
participating in the study (60%) had experienced a duration of asthma of ≥10 years. Only 11 subjects 
(2%) had asthma for less than 1 year. The mean duration of asthma was 15.53 years (range: 0.3 to 
68 years).

Numbers analysed 
Six  populations  were  defined  in  the  RAP  for  this  study  (Total,  ITT,  PP,  Urinary  Cortisol,  FF  PK  and  VI 
PK).  The  Total,  ITT,  PP  and  Urinary  Cortisol  Populations  are  summarised  in  the  table  below.  These 
populations  were  defined  prior  to  unblinding  the  study  data.  The  Randomised  population  was  not  a 
RAP-defined population, but comprised 587 subjects who were randomised and given a randomisation 
number. Subject 9829 was randomised in error but did not receive study drug and was not included in 
the ITT Population. 
The  ITT  Population  was  the  population  of  primary  interest  for  all  efficacy  and  safety  endpoints 
(excluding urinary cortisol analyses), and this population included 586 subjects who were randomised 
and received at least one dose of study medication. 
Of the 586 subjects in the ITT population, 515 (88%) were included in the PP Population. 
These were subjects in the ITT Population not identified as full protocol deviators with respect to RAP-
defined criteria that were considered to impact the primary efficacy analysis. The PP Population was of 
equal  importance  to  the  ITT  population  in  assessing  non-inferiority  of  FF  200  OD  to  FP  500  BD  on 
change from baseline in clinic visit trough FEV1. It was otherwise only used for confirmatory analyses 
of the co-primary and powered secondary efficacy endpoints. 
The  Urinary  Cortisol  Population  comprised  389  subjects  (66%)  from  the  ITT  Population  for  whom  a 
urine sample was collected and whose urine samples were not considered to have confounding factors 
that would affect the interpretation of the results.

Outcomes and estimation 
Evening Trough FEV1 
The mean change from baseline in clinic visit trough (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 at the end 
of  the  24-week  Treatment  Period  was  one  of  the  co-primary  endpoints.  The  primary  treatment 
comparison was of FF/VI 200/25 OD versus FF 200 OD alone. A summary of the evening trough FEV1 
(LOCF)  and  a  statistical  analysis  of  trough  FEV1  at  Week  24  (LOCF)  are  presented  in  the  two  tables 
below. 
Mean  baseline  pre-brochodilator  FEV1  was  well  balanced  across  the  treatment  groups,  ranging  from 
2.129  L  in  the  FF/VI  200/25  OD  group  to  2.190  L  in  the  FF  200  OD  group.  At  Week  24,  the  FF/VI 
200/25  group  showed  a  least  squares  (LS)  mean  change  from  baseline  improvement  of  193  mL 
greater than the FF 200 OD group and 210 mL greater than the FP 500 BD group. This difference was 
clinically meaningful and statistically significant (p<0.001) for each comparison. The improvement was 
similar between the FF 200 OD and FP 500 BD groups (difference of 18 mL in favour of FF [95% CI, -
66, 102 mL]). 
The  by-country  summary  of  the  evening  trough  FEV1  (LOCF)  for  the  ITT  Population  demonstrated 
similar  trends  to  the  overall  population.  The  non-inferiority  of  FF  200  OD  to  FP  500  BD  was  also 
assessed. 
Non-inferiority was demonstrated as the lower bound of the 95% CI for trough FEV1 was greater than 
the  predefined  non-inferiority  margin  of  -125  mL  (treatment  difference  of  18  mL  [CI:  -66  mL,  102 
mL]). 
The summaries and analysis were repeated for the PP Population. These results were supportive of the 
ITT  analysis  showing  an  LS  mean  change  from  baseline  improvement  of  182  mL  greater  than  the  FF 
200 OD group and 225 mL greater than the FP 500 BD group at the Week 24 visit. Again, these results 
were statistically significant (p<0.001). The non-inferiority results obtained from the PP Population for 
FF 200 OD to FP 500 BD were supportive of the ITT as again the lower bound of the 95% CI for trough 
FEV1 was greater than the predefined non-inferiority margin of -125 mL (treatment difference of 43 mL 
[CI: -48 mL, 133 mL]).

Weighted Mean Serial FEV1 Over 0 to 24 Hours Post-Dose 
The  weighted  mean  FEV1  over  0  to  24  hours  at  the  end  of  the  24-week  Treatment  Period  was  a  co-
primary endpoint. The primary treatment comparison was of FF/VI 200/25 OD versus FF 200 OD alone. 
A summary of weighted mean 0 to 24 hours FEV1 and a statistical analysis of the data are presented in 
the two tables below.

The  greatest  values  for  the  weighted  mean  0  to  24  hour  FEV1  measurement  were  seen  in  the  FF/VI 
200/25  OD  group  (2.716  L),  followed  by  the  FF  200  OD  group  (2.663  L)  and  the  FP  500  BD  group 
(2.322 L). The FF/VI 200/25 OD group demonstrated an LS mean improvement of 136 mL greater than 
the FF 200 OD group and 206 mL greater than the FP 500 BD group. Both of these comparisons were 
statistically  significant  (p=0.048  and  p=0.003  for  the  FF  200  OD  and  FP  500  BD  comparisons 
respectively). In addition, the point estimate for the difference between FF/VI 200/25 OD and FF 200 
OD fell within the 95% CI of the FF/VI 200/25 OD and FP 500 BD comparison, and vice versa. 
The  by-country  summaries  showed  some  variations  compared  with  the  overall  population.  Germany, 
the Russian Federation, and the US broadly followed the trends observed in the overall population. In 
Poland, however, the greatest change from baseline was observed for subjects in the FF 200 OD group 
(523  mL),  followed  by  the  FF/VI  200/25  OD  group  (388  mL)  and  the  FP  500  BD  group  (145  mL).  In 
Romania,  the  greatest  change  from  baseline  was  observed  for  subjects  in  the  FP  500  BD  group  (297 
mL), followed by the FF/VI 200/25 OD group (289 mL), and the FF 200 OD group (183 mL). However, 
it  should  be  noted  that  the  number  of  subjects  that  provided  weighted  mean  data  from  Poland  and 
Romania was small (samples sizes (N) of N=45 and N=34 for Poland and Romania, respectively), and 
therefore interpretation of these data are limited.

Study HZA106837 
Study  HZA106837  was  a  Long-Term,  Randomized,  Double-Blind,  Parallel  Group  Study  of  Fluticasone 
Furoate/GW642444  Inhalation  Powder  Once-  Daily  and  Fluticasone  Furoate  Inhalation  Powder  Once-
Daily in Subjects with Asthma. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria 
Male and female subjects, treated as outpatients, 12 years of age and older with a history of asthma, 
as  defined  by  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  [NIH,  2007],  for  at  least  1  year  prior  to  Visit  1 
(Screening)  using  fluticasone  propionate  200  to  1000  mcg/day  or  equivalent  or  fluticasone 
propionate/salmeterol 200/100 to 500/100 mcg/day or equivalent for at least 12 weeks prior to Visit 1 
and  a  history  of  one  or  more  asthma  exacerbations  that  required  treatment  with  oral/systemic 
corticosteroids or emergency department visit or in-patient hospitalization for the treatment of asthma 
within 12 months prior to Visit 1 were eligible for this study. 
Subjects  had  to  have  a  best  forced  expiratory  volume  in  one  second  (FEV1)  of  50%  to  90%  of  the 
predicted  normal  value  at  visit  1  and  demonstrate  a  ≥12%  and  ≥200mL  reversibility  of  FEV1  within 
approximately 10 to 40 minutes following 2 to 4 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol. 
Predicted  values  were  based  upon  National  Health  and  Nutrition  Examination  Survey  (NHANES)  III 
[Hankinson, 1999]. All subjects had to be able to replace their current short-acting beta2-agonists with 
albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol at Visit 1 for use as needed for the duration of the study. 
Exclusion criteria 
Subjects could not have a history of life-threatening asthma within last 5 years, evidence of concurrent 
respiratory disease, or other clinically significant medical conditions. 
Relvar Ellipta  
Assessment report  
EMA/282960/2013

Subjects also had to have a negative oropharyngeal examination (no candidiasis) at Screening, could 
not have participated in a previous Phase III FF/VI study, could not have used tobacco products in the 
3 months prior to screening or have a historical use of ≥10-pack years, severe milk protein allergy or 
specific drug allergies, or used prohibited medications within the specified time periods. 
Randomization Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria 
At  the  end  of  the  run-in  period  (Visit  2),  subjects  had  to  meet  the  following  FEV1  and  albuterol 
use/asthma symptom criteria in order to be randomized to double-blind treatment: 
• 
PM pre-dose FEV1 50% to 90% of the predicted normal 
•  A documented use of albuterol/salbutamol and/or asthma symptoms on at least 3 of the last 7 
consecutive days of the run-in period. 
Subjects were not eligible for randomization to double-blind treatment if they met any of the following 
criteria at Visit 2: 
•  Clinically  significant  abnormal  laboratory  tests  during  Visit  1,  which  were  still  abnormal  upon 
repeat analysis and not believed to be due to disease(s) present. 
•  Changes  in  asthma  medication  between  Visits  1  and  2  (excluding  albuterol/salbutamol 
inhalation aerosol provided at Visit 1). 
•  Occurrence  of  a  culture-documented  or  suspected  bacterial  or  viral  infection  of  the  upper  or 
lower  respiratory  tract,  sinus  or  middle  ear  during  the  run-in  period  that  led  to  a  change  in 
asthma  management,  or  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator  could  affect  the  subject’s  asthma 
status or the subject’s ability to participate in the study. 
•  Asthma  exacerbation  requiring  in-patient  hospitalization  or  emergency  department  visit 
between Visits 1 and 2. 
• 
Evidence of significant abnormality in the 12-lead ECG performed at Visit 1, as judged by the 
investigator.

Objectives 
The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  demonstrate  that  treatment  with  FF/VI  once-daily  administered  in 
the  evening  significantly  decreased  the  risk  of  severe  asthma  exacerbations  as  measured  by  time  to 
first severe asthma exacerbation when compared with the same dose of FF alone administered once-
daily in the evening in subjects 12 years of age and older with asthma. This study established safety as 
well as demonstrated benefit of the addition of a LABA to an ICS by utilizing an endpoint (time to first 
severe asthma exacerbation) that informs on both safety and efficacy. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was the time to first severe asthma exacerbation. 
An  adjudication  committee  was  utilized  to  determine  if  serious  adverse  events  were  classified  as 
asthma-related  and  to  ensure  that  all  severe  asthma  exacerbations  were  captured  as  defined  in  the 
protocol. Additional details are provided in the Adjudication Guidelines. 
A  severe  asthma  exacerbation  was  defined  as  deterioration  of  asthma  requiring  the  use  of  systemic 
corticosteroids (tablets, suspensions, or injection) for at least 3 days or an inpatient hospitalization or 
emergency  department  visit  due  to  asthma  that  required  systemic  corticosteroids.  Courses  of 
corticosteroids  separated  by  1  week  or  more  were  treated  as  separate  severe  asthma  exacerbations 
[Reddel, 2009]. 
Subjects were withdrawn from the study if they experienced 3 severe asthma exacerbations in any 6 
month period or 4 severe asthma exacerbations during the doubleblind treatment period. 
Secondary endpoints 
•  Rate of severe asthma exacerbation per subject per year. 
•  Change from baseline at Week 36 in PM pre-dose trough FEV1. 
Sample size 
This event-driven study was designed to have 90% power to detect the following reductions (see table 
below) in the risk of experiencing a severe asthma exacerbation for FF/VI compared with FF. 
Table 41.  Number  of  Events  Required  to  Detect  Selected  Hazard  Ratios  at  Various 
Significance Levels 
Since  subjects  were  followed  for  a  variable  length  of  time  (up  to  at  most  18  months),  the  following 
assumptions were made to calculate the approximate number of subjects to be randomized: 
•  10% of subjects in each treatment group lost to follow-up during one year 
•  20%  of  subjects  within  the  FF  treatment  arm  would  have  one  or  more  severe  asthma 
exacerbation within a year (based on rated observed in ICS-alone arms in similar studies) 
Relvar Ellipta  
Assessment report  
EMA/282960/2013

• 
the following recruitment pattern: 106 subjects randomized in month 1, 155 in month 2, 293 
in month 3, 258 in month 4, 172 in month 5, 208 in month 6, 249 in month 7, 278 in month 8, 
and 399 in month 9. 
A  total  sample  size  of  2000  (1000  per  arm)  would  provide  90%  power  based  on  the  above 
assumptions, with a recruitment period of 8.704 months and total study duration of approximately 17 
months (17.138 months based on alpha=0.05, 17.117 for alpha=0.01, and 17.533 for alpha=0.001). 
For  the  interim  analysis,  the  Haybittle-Peto  approach  was  used  to  account  for  the  assessment  of 
overwhelming  superiority  for  the  primary  endpoint;  a  high  threshold  (onesided  p<0.000005,  the 
equivalent  of  two-sided  p<0.00001)  was  applied.  For  the  final  analysis,  an  adjusted  p-value  and  the 
median  unbiased  estimate  of  the  hazard  ratio  with  its  associated  confidence  intervals  was  calculated 
using discrete stagewise ordering as described by Tsiatis, Rosner and Mehta [Tsiatis, 1984]. 
Randomisation 
Subjects  who  were  eligible  for  the  treatment  phase  were  assigned  to  study  treatment  following  a 
telephone  call  to  the  Interactive  Voice  Response  System  (IVRS),  in  accordance  with  the  computer 
generated  randomization  schedule.  Once  a  randomization  number  had  been  assigned  to  a  subject,  it 
could not be reassigned to any other subject in the study. 
At subsequent visits where study medication was dispensed, a telephone call was made to the IVRS for 
the next treatment pack number(s) to be assigned from the investigator’s inventory. 
Blinding (masking) 
The  treatments  in  this  study  were  double-blind.  Neither  the  investigator  nor  the  subject  knew  which 
treatment  the  subject  was  receiving.  The  investigator  or  treating  physician  could  unblind  a  subject’s 
treatment assignment only in the case of an emergency, when knowledge of the study treatment was 
essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the subject. Subjects whose treatment 
was unblinded were withdrawn from the study.  
Statistical methods 
The  time  to  first  severe  asthma  exacerbation  was  analysed  using  a  Cox  proportional  hazards 
regression  model,  including  terms  for  baseline  disease  severity  (FEV1  measured  at  randomization), 
sex,  age,  and  region,  for  the  ITT  and  PP  populations.  The  estimated  hazard  ratio  (HR)  with  95% 
confidence  interval  and  p-value,  all  adjusted  for  the  interim  analysis,  were  presented.  Cumulative 
incidence curves from the Cox model showing time-to-event curves for the two treatment groups were 
produced. The above analysis was repeated for the ITT population excluding all data from Investigator 
171806  due  to  concerns  regarding  study  procedures  at  this  site.  In  addition,  for  the  purposes  of  the 
primary  efficacy,  analysis,  a  decision  was  made  after  the  blind  was  broken  to  exclude  a  further 
investigator  (Investigator  040688),  who  randomized  16  subjects,  due  to  GCP  issues  identified  during 
an audit of his site. 
Therefore  a  second  sensitivity  analysis  was  run  post-unblinding  excluding  both  Investigator  171806 
and Investigator 040688. A decision was made and documented prior to doing any sensitivity analyses 
that the ITT Population would remain the primary population for presentation of results and inference 
throughout the CSR.

Cumulative incidence curves using the Kaplan-Meier method were presented overall, by country and by 
race. As a supportive analysis, the log-rank test was used to compare treatment groups with estimated 
hazard ratio, 95% confidence interval and p-value presented. Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidence curve 
showing time to withdrawal prior to the first severe asthma exacerbation was produced. 
A sensitivity analysis was performed with stratification by center for events only (i.e., ignoring time to 
event).  An  exact  estimate  of  the  common  odds  ratio  (OR),  an  exact  95%  CI  and  exact  p-value  were 
calculated. 
Interactions  between  treatment  and  each  covariate  were  investigated,  with  separate  models  for  each 
interaction. The resulting p-values for the interactions from each of the models and HRs for treatment 
for each covariate subgroup were plotted. 
Informative  censoring  was  investigated,  and  a  Kaplan-Meier  cumulative  incidence  curve  was 
presented. 
Summaries were produced for number and percent of subjects who had a severe asthma exacerbation, 
the number of exacerbations which led to withdrawal, use of systemic/oral corticosteroids, emergency 
room  visit,  hospitalization,  or  intubation,  and  duration  of  severe  asthma  exacerbations.  Reasons  that 
led to the diagnosis of a severe asthma exacerbation were summarized and then displayed graphically 
overall and by country. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A  total  of  2020  subjects  were  randomized  and  2019  (>99%)  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study 
medication and were included in the ITT Population (see table below). One hundred sixty-seven (167) 
sites  in  11  countries  participated  in  this  study.  The  United  States  had  the  largest  subject  enrollment 
(373  subjects,  18%),  followed  by  Russian  Federation  (300  subjects,  15%),  Mexico  (233  subjects, 
12%),  Ukraine  (231  subjects,  11%),  Germany  (179  subjects,  9%),  Argentina  (159  subjects,  8%), 
Poland  (156  subjects,  8%),  Philippines  (154  subjects,  8%),  Romania  (153  subjects,  8%),  Japan  (62 
subjects, 3%) and Australia (19 subjects, <1%). 
The majority of the subjects (87%) completed the study (see table below). The most common primary 
reason  for  withdrawal  was  withdrawing  consent  (5%).  One  subject  in  the  FF/VI  100/25  group  was 
withdrawn due to meeting liver function abnormality protocol-defined stopping criteria.

Table 42.  Disposition of Subjects (Study HZA106837, ITT Population) 
Attendance at clinic visits declined slightly over time due to subject withdrawals, from 100% at Day 1 
to  86%  at  Week  44.  The  percentage  of  subjects  attending  the  clinic  at  Weeks  52,  60  and  68  was 
notably lower than the other visits (3% to 42%) due to the study reaching completion prior to the time 
a majority of the subjects would have attended those visits. All subjects who completed treatment per 
the protocol were treated for at least 24 weeks. 
Conduct of the study 
There  was  one  local  protocol  amendments  to  the  original  clinical  trial  protocol.  This  amendment  was 
considered not influencing the study results. 
Baseline data 
Demographics were generally comparable across the treatment groups in the ITT Population (see table 
below).  The  majority  of  subjects  in  the  ITT  Population  were  White  (73%),  not  of  Hispanic/Latino 
ethnicity  (85%),  and  female  (67%);  the  mean  age  was  41.7  years.  Adolescents  (subjects  12  to  17 
years of age) comprised 14% of the ITT Population.

Asthma  history  was  similar  across  the  treatment  groups  (see  table  below).  More  than  half  of  the 
subjects  participating  in  the  study  (59%)  had  a  history  of  asthma  for  at  least  10  years.  The  mean 
duration  of  asthma  was  15.54  years  (range:  1  year  to  70  years).  All  but  one  subject  had  an 
exacerbation  in  the  year  prior  to  study  entry.  The  number  of  exacerbations  a  subject  experienced  in 
the  year  prior  to  Screening  was  recorded  on  the  exacerbation  history  page  of  the  eCRF.  In  addition, 
investigators could document on the eligibility page of the eCRF if a subject did not meet the protocol 
defined  asthma  exacerbation  history.  In  three  instances,  the  investigator  recorded  on  the  eligibility 
page that the subject did not meet the exacerbation history criteria; however, per the information on 
the  exacerbation  history  page,  a  protocol  defined exacerbation  had  occurred  in  the  previous  year.  Of 
the subjects who had exacerbations in the previous year, the majority (57%) had one exacerbation. 
Table 44.  Duration of Asthma and Exacerbation History (Study HZA106837, ITT Population) 
Of the subjects who had ≥1 exacerbations in the previous 12 months, the incidence of Type 1, Type 2 
and  Type  3  exacerbations  were  similar  across  treatment  groups.  Twenty-two  percent  (22%)  of 
subjects  in  each  treatment  group  had  previously  been  hospitalized  (in-patient  or  ER  visit)  for  an 
exacerbation (Type 3 exacerbation). 
The majority of subjects enrolled in the study had never smoked (86%). 
Screening  lung  function  tests  showed  a  mean  pre-bronchodilator  FEV1  of  2.11  L,  mean  post-
bronchodilator FEV1 of 2.61 L, mean percent predicted FEV1 of 68.9%, and mean reversibility of 24.4% 
and  499.6  mL  (see  table  below).  Baseline  pulmonary  function  test  results  were  similar  to  Screening 
with mean pre-dose FEV1 of 2.20 L and mean percent predicted FEV1 had increased slightly to 71.9%. 
Screening and baseline results were comparable across the treatment groups.

Table 45.  Screening Lung Function Test Results (Study HZA106837, ITT Population) 
Screening  and  baseline  pulmonary  function  test  results  by  country  showed  some  slight  differences 
compared  with  all  countries  combined.  Both  Japan  and  Philippines  had  lower  mean  absolute 
reversibility  (433.2  mL  and  363.4  mL,  respectively).  Both  Poland  and  Ukraine  had  higher  mean 
absolute  reversibility  (551.2  mL  and  555.7  mL,  respectively).  Australia  had  lower  mean  percent 
reversibility  (20.9%)  and  mean  absolute  reversibility  (477.4  mL).  Romania  had  higher  mean  percent 
predicted  FEV1  (75.4%  at  screening  and  75.8%  at  baseline)  and  lower  mean  percent  reversibility 
(18.0%) and mean absolute reversibility (436.5 mL). Argentina, Germany, Mexico, Russia and US were 
all similar to all countries combined. 
Within  each  country,  with  the  exception  of  Australia  and  Romania,  the  screening  and  baseline 
pulmonary  function  test  results  were  similar  between  the  treatment  groups.  In  Australia,  the  FF  100 
group  had  higher  screening  and  baseline  mean  percent  predicted  FEV1  (72.2%  and  73.7%, 
respectively)  compared  with  the  FF/VI  100/25  screening  and  baseline  mean  percent  predicted  FEV1 
(67.1%  and  66.5%,  respectively).  In  Romania,  the  FF  100  group  had  a  higher  mean  absolute 
reversibility (460.6 mL) than the FF/VI 100/25 group (412.0 mL).

Numbers analysed 
A  total  of 2020  subject  were  randomized  and  2019  (>99%)  were included in  the  ITT  Population  (see 
table  below).  The  majority  of  the  subjects  in  the  ITT  Population  (89%)  were  included  in  the  PP 
Population. 
Table 46.  Subject Populations (Study HZA106837) 
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was the time to first severe asthma exacerbation. 
The hazard ratio from the Cox Model (adjusted for the interim analysis) for FF/VI 100/25 versus FF 100 
was  0.795  (95%  CI  0.642,  0.985).  This  represents  a  20%  reduction  in  the  risk  of  experiencing  a 
severe asthma exacerbation for subjects treated with FF/VI 100/25 compared with FF 100 (p=0.036). 
Table 47.  Cox  Proportional  Hazards  Analysis  of  Time  to  First  Severe  Asthma  Exacerbation 
(Study HZA106837, ITT Population) 
Supporting analysis using the PP population gave similar results (hazard ratio for FF/VI 100/25 versus 
FF 100 of 0.722 [95% CI 0.548, 0.950]; 28% reduction [p=0.020]). 
For the purposes of the primary efficacy analysis, a decision was made by the Applicant to perform a 
sensitivity  analysis  excluding  all  subjects  enrolled  by  Investigator  171806  and  Investigator  040688 
because  of  study  conduct  irregularities  at  these  sites.  The  results  of  the  Cox  Proportional  Hazards 
Analysis  of  time  to  first  severe  asthma  exacerbation  excluding  Investigator  171806  on  his  own  and 
excluding both Investigator 171806 and Investigator 040688 were entirely consistent with the results 
seen for the ITT population. 
Results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  of  Log  Rank  Analysis  of  time  to  first  severe  asthma  exacerbation 
support  those  shown  in  the  Cox  Proportional  Hazards  Analysis  of  time  to  first  severe  asthma 
exacerbation.

Kaplan-Meier  cumulative  incidence  curve  for  time  to  first  severe  asthma  exacerbation  show  fewer 
subjects  treated  with  FF/VI  (15.2%  [  95%  CI  13.0%,  17.6%])  had  one  or  more  severe  asthma 
exacerbation by 52 weeks than subjects treated with FF alone (19.3% [95% CI 16.9%, 22.0%]). 
COPD indication 
The clinical development program to support the approval of FF/VI Inhalation Powder in subjects with 
COPD consists of eleven Phase IIa-IIIb studies in adult subjects with COPD (see table below). Of these, 
four,  Phase  IIIa  studies  with  FF/VI  Inhalation  Powder  (HZC112206,  HZC112207,  HZC102871,  and 
HZC102970)  are  considered  primary  studies  for  the  COPD  indication.  Five  studies  that  provided 
additional  efficacy  and  safety  data  are  considered  supportive;  four  studies  with  FF/VI  Inhalation 
Powder  (HZC110946,  HZC113107,  HZC113109  and  HZC112352)  and  one  study  with  VI  Inhalation 
Powder monotherapy (B2C111045).

Studies HZC112206 and HZC112207 
Study  HCZ112206  and  study  HCZ112207  were  two  24-Week  Studies  to  Evaluate  the  Efficacy  and 
Safety  of  Fluticasone  Furoate  (GW685698)/GW642444  Inhalation  Powder  and  the  Individual 
Components  Delivered  Once  Daily  (AM)  Via  a  Novel  Dry  Powder  Inhaler  Compared  with  Placebo  in 
Subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria 
Subjects eligible for enrollment in the study were to have met all of the following criteria:  
1.  Type of subject: outpatient 
2.  Informed  consent:  Subjects  gave  their  signed  and  dated  written  informed  consent  to 
participate. 
3.  Gender: Male or female subjects 
Female  subjects  were  eligible  to  enter  and  participate  in  the  study  if  they  were  of  non-child-
bearing  potential  (i.e.,  physiologically  incapable  of becoming  pregnant,  including  females  who 
were post-menopausal or surgically sterile).  
Females  of  child-bearing  potential  were  eligible  if  they  had  a  negative  pregnancy  test  at 
screening  and  agreed  to  acceptable  contraceptive  methods  used  consistently  and  correctly 
(i.e.,  in  accordance  with  the  approved  product  label  and  the  instructions  of  the  physician  for 
the duration of the study – screening to follow-up contact). 
4.  Age: ≥40 years of age at Screening (Visit 1) 
5.  COPD  diagnosis:  Subjects  with  a  clinical  history  of  COPD  in  accordance  with  the  following 
definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society [Celli, 2004]: 
COPD is a preventable and treatable disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully 
reversible.  The  airflow  limitation  is  usually  progressive  and  is  associated  with  an  abnormal 
inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette 
smoking. Although COPD affects the lungs, it also produces significant systemic consequences. 
6.  Tobacco use: Subjects with a current or prior history of ≥10 pack-years of cigarette smoking at 
Screening  (Visit  1).  Former  smokers  were  defined  as  those  who  had  stopped  smoking  for  at 
least  6  months  prior  to  Visit  1.  Pipe  and/or  cigar  use  was  not  used  to  calculate  pack-year 
history. 
Number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day/20) x number of years smoked. 
7.  Severity of Disease: 
•  Subject  with  a  measured  post-albuterol/salbutamol  FEV1/FVC  ratio  of  ≤0.70  at 
Screening (Visit 1) [Pelligrino, 2005] 
•  Subjects  with  a  measured  post-albuterol/salbutamol  FEV1  ≤70%  of  predicted  normal 
values  calculated  (via  centralized  vendor  equipment)  using  NHANES  III  reference 
equations [Hankinson, 1999] at Screening (Visit 1).

Post-bronchodilator  spirometry  was  performed  approximately  10-15  minutes  after  the  subject 
had  self-administered  4  inhalations  (i.e.,  total  400  mcg)  of  albuterol/salbutamol  via  an  MDI 
with  a  valved-holding  chamber.  The  study  provided  central  spirometry  equipment  calculated 
the FEV1/FVC ratio and FEV1 percent predicted values. 
8.  Dyspnea:  Achieved  a  score  of  ≥2  on  the  Modified  Medical  Research  Council  Dyspnea  Scale 
(mMRC) at Screening (Visit 1). 
Main exclusion criteria 
Subjects meeting any of the following criteria were not to be enrolled in the study: 
1.  Pregnancy:  Women  who  were  pregnant  or  lactating  or  who  were  planning  on  becoming 
pregnant during the study. 
2.  Asthma: Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthma. (Subjects with a prior history of asthma 
were eligible if they had a current diagnosis of COPD) 
3.  α1-antitrypsin  deficiency:  Subjects  with  α1-antitrypsin  deficiency  as  the  underlying  cause  of 
COPD 
4.  Other  respiratory  disorders:  Subjects  with  active  tuberculosis,  lung  cancer,  bronchiectasis, 
sarcoidosis,  lung  fibrosis,  pulmonary  hypertension,  interstitial  lung  diseases  or  other  active 
pulmonary diseases 
5.  Lung  resection:  Subjects  with  lung  volume  reduction  surgery  within  the  12  months  prior  to 
Screening (Visit 1) 
6.  Chest X-ray (or CT scan): Subjects with a chest X-ray (or CT scan) that revealed evidence of 
clinically significant abnormalities not believed to be due to the presence of COPD. A chest X-
ray  was  taken  at  Screening  (Visit  1)  if  a  chest  X-ray  or  CT  scan  was  not  available  within  6 
months prior to Visit 1. For sites in Germany, if a chest X-ray (or CT scan) was not available in 
the 6 months preceding Screening (Visit 1), the subject was not eligible for the study. 
7.  Hospitalization: Subjects who were hospitalized due to poorly controlled COPD within 12 weeks 
of Visit 1. 
8.  Poorly controlled COPD: Subjects with poorly controlled COPD, defined as the occurrence of the 
following in  the  6  weeks  prior to  Visit  1:  Acute  worsening  of  COPD  that  was  managed  by  the 
subject with corticosteroids or antibiotics or that required treatment prescribed by a physician. 
9.  Lower  respiratory  tract  infection:  Subjects  with  lower  respiratory  tract  infection  that  required 
the use of antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1.

10. Other  diseases/abnormalities:  Subjects  with  historical  or  current  evidence  of  clinically 
significant  cardiovascular  (i.e.,  pacemaker),  neurological,  psychiatric,  renal,  hepatic, 
immunological,  endocrine 
(including  uncontrolled  diabetes  or 
thyroid  disease)  or 
haematological  abnormalities  that  were  uncontrolled.  Significant  was  defined  as  any  disease 
that,  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator,  would  put  the  safety  of  the  subject  at  risk  through 
participation,  or  which  would  affect  the  efficacy  or  safety  analysis  if  the  disease/condition 
exacerbated during the study. 
11. Hypertension: Subjects with clinically significant hypertension that was uncontrolled. 
12. Drug/food allergy: Subjects with a  history of hypersensitivity to any of the study medications 
(e.g.,  beta-agonists,  corticosteroid)  or  components  of  the  inhalation  powder  (e.g.,  lactose, 
magnesium stearate). In addition, subjects with a history of severe milk protein allergy that, in 
the  opinion  of  the  study  physician,  contraindicated  the  subject’s  participation  were  also 
excluded. 
13. Medication  prior  to  spirometry:  Subjects  who  were  medically  unable  to  withhold  their 
albuterol/salbutamol  and/or  their  ipratropium  for  the  4-hour  period  required  prior  to 
spirometry testing at each study visit. 
14. Additional medication: Use of the following medications within the following time intervals prior 
to Visit 1 or during the study: 
Oxygen  therapy:  Subjects  receiving  treatment  with  long-term  oxygen  therapy  (LTOT)  or 
nocturnal oxygen therapy required for greater than 12 hours a day. Oxygen prn use (i.e., ≤12 
hours per day) was not exclusionary.  
15. Prior  use  of  study  medication/other  investigational  drugs:  Subjects  who  had  previously  been 
randomized  to  treatment  with  VI  in  the  B2C111045  study,  randomized  to  treatment  in  the 
HZC111348  study  or  had  participated  in  the  HZC112207,  HZC102871,  HZC102970,  or 
HZC110946 studies. Subjects who had received an investigational drug within 30 days of entry 
into  this  study  (Screening),  or  within  5  drug  half-lives  of  the  investigational  drug,  whichever 
was longer. 
Treatments 
All  blinded  study  medication  was  delivered  via  the  novel  dry  powder  inhaler.  Each  novel  dry  powder 
inhaler provided a total of 30 doses (60 blisters), with each actuation comprising the contents of one 
blister from each of the two internal foil strips simultaneously.  
The  novel  dry  powder  inhaler  containing  randomized  treatment  appeared  identical  on  the  outside  to 
the  subject  (and  his/her  caregiver)  and  the  investigator.  Subjects  were  instructed  to  take  one 
inhalation each morning.

All  subjects  received  supplemental  albuterol/salbutamol  (MDI  and/or  nebules)  to  be  used  on  an  as-
needed  basis  (rescue  medication)  throughout  the  study.  This  rescue  medication  was  sourced  locally 
and  dispensed  as  study  medication  at  the  study  sites.  Ipratropium  bromide  alone  was  permitted, 
provided  that  the  subject  was  on  a  stable  dose  from  Screening  (Visit  1)  and  remained  on  the  stable 
dose  throughout  the  study;  however,  ipratropium  must  have  been  withheld  for  4  hours  prior  to  and 
during each clinic visit. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  study  HCZ112206  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  FF/GW642444 
Inhalation  Powder  50/25  mcg  QD,  FF/GW642444  Inhalation  Powder  100/25  mcg  QD,  FF  Inhalation 
Powder  100  mcg  QD,  GW642444  Inhalation  Powder  25  mcg  QD,  and  placebo  when  administered  via 
the novel dry powder inhaler (NDPI) over a 24-week treatment period in subjects with COPD. 
The primary objective of study HCZ112207 was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FF/VI inhalation 
powder 100/25mcg QD, FF/VI inhalation powder 200/25mcg QD, FF inhalation powder 100mcg QD, FF 
Inhalation  Powder  200mcg  QD,  VI  inhalation  powder  25mcg  QD,  and  placebo  when  administered  via 
the novel dry powder inhaler (NDPI) over a 24-week treatment period in subjects with COPD. 
A secondary objective of the two studies was to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of FF and 
GW642444  and  to  evaluate  pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic  relationships,  if  any,  between  FF  or 
GW642444  systemic  exposure  and  systemic  PD  endpoints  following  administration  of  FF/GW642444 
Inhalation Powder to subjects with COPD over 24 weeks of treatment. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Co-primary endpoint 
• 
Post-dose FEV1 assessed by weighted mean (WM) over the first 0-4 hrs on Treatment Day 168  
•  Change from baseline in trough FEV1 on Treatment Day 169.

Sample size 
Sample  size  calculations  were  based  on  the  co-primary  endpoints  of  post-dose  FEV1  assessed  by 
weighted mean (WM) over the first 0-4 hrs on Treatment Day 168 and change from baseline in trough 
FEV1  on  Treatment  Day  169.  Each  endpoint  was  analyzed  using  Mixed  Models  Repeated  Measures 
(MMRM) analysis.  
The  sample  size  calculations  used  an  estimate  of  residual  standard  deviation  of  210  mL  which  was 
based  upon  the  Phase  IIb  study  of  VI  in  COPD  subjects  [study  B2C111045]  and  previous  studies  in 
COPD  subjects  with  the  fluticasone  propionate/salmeterol  (FSC)  combination.  A  study  with  146 
evaluable subjects per arm has a 90% power to detect an 80 mL difference between FF/VI and  VI in 
trough  FEV1  on  Day  169,  a  treatment  difference  considered  appropriate  for  this  comparison.  A  two-
sample t-test and two-sided 5% significance level was used in these calculations. 
Relvar Ellipta  
Assessment report  
EMA/282960/2013

A 100 mL difference was considered appropriate for comparisons of VI versus placebo and FF/VI versus 
placebo  for  both  trough  FEV1  and  WM  0-4  hrs  FEV1  and  of  FF/VI  versus  FF  for  WM  0-4  hrs  FEV1.  A 
study with 146 evaluable subjects per arm has 98% power to detect a treatment difference of 100 mL 
for these comparisons. 
Although, in MMRM, all available post-baseline assessments up to endpoint for subjects in the Intent-
to-Treat Population were utilized in the analysis, data for subjects who withdraw prematurely from the 
study were not explicitly imputed. Hence, to allow for an estimated 27% withdrawal rate, 200 subjects 
were to be randomised to each treatment arm. 
Randomisation 
Subjects  were  assigned  to  study  treatment  in  accordance  with  the  central  randomization  schedule. 
Once a randomization number was assigned to a subject, the same number could not be reassigned to 
any  other  subject  in  the  study.  Subjects  were  stratified  based  on  smoking  status  (former/current 
smoker).  Subjects  were  centrally  randomized  using  RAMOS,  an  Interactive  Voice  Response  System 
(IVRS). This is a telephone based system used by the investigator or designee to register the subject, 
randomize the subject and provide medication assignment information. 
Following  the  2-week  Run-In  period,  eligible  subjects  were  randomized  (1:1:1:1:1)  to  one  of  the 
following 5 possible treatments, administered as one inhalation each morning for 24 weeks:

Statistical methods 
As the study was centrally randomised, the primary efficacy endpoint was collected using standardized 
spirometric  equipment  across  all  centers  and  the  data  were  centrally  overread,  no  adjustment  for 
individual centers was performed in the statistical analysis. Centre-grouping (geographical region) was 
included in the analysis models. Centre grouping was defined prior to breaking the blind. Centres were 
grouped into geographical region: USA, European Union and Other. 
0-4 hrs Post-Dose Weighted Mean FEV1 on Day 168 
The  primary  analysis  was  performed  using  mixed  model  repeated  measures  (MMRM)  and  had 
covariates  of  baseline  FEV1,  smoking  status  (stratum),  Day,  centre  grouping,  treatment,  Day  by 
baseline  interaction  and  Day  by  treatment  interaction,  where  Day  is  nominal.  The  model  used  all 
available 0- 4 hrs weighted mean FEV1 values recorded on Days 1, 14, 56, 84, and 168. Missing data 
were not directly imputed in this analysis; however, all non-missing data for a subject was used within 
the analysis to estimate the treatment effect for 0-4 hrs weighted mean FEV1 on Day 168. Two models 
were  fitted;  one  with  a  response  variable  of  0-4  hrs  weighted  mean  FEV1,  and  one  with  a  response 
variable  of  change  from  baseline  0-4  hrs  weighted  mean  FEV1.  The  above  primary  analysis  was 
repeated for the PP Population. 
Change from Baseline in Clinic Visit Trough FEV1 on Treatment Day 169 
The primary analysis was performed on the ITT Population using the same MMRM model as described 
for  weighted  mean  FEV1  0-4  hrs  post-dose.  All  available  trough  FEV1  values,  recorded  at  each  clinic 
visit, were used in the analysis. The primary analysis was repeated for the PP Population. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Study HZC112206 
A  total  of  1030  subjects  completed  the  screening  and  run-in  periods,  were  randomly  assigned  to 
treatment,  and  received  at  least  one  dose  of  double-blind  study  medication  in  the  treatment  period. 
These  subjects  comprised  the  ITT  population.  The  majority  of  subjects  in  each  treatment  group 
(approximately 70% of subjects across the treatment groups) completed the study, and attendance at 
each  scheduled  clinic  visit  was  high.  The  percentages  of  subjects  who  withdrew  from  the  study  were 
similar across the active treatment groups (27% to 31%) and similar to the percentage who withdrew 
from the placebo group (33%). 
The most common primary reason for premature withdrawal was adverse event, and the percentages 
of  subjects  who  withdrew  from  the  FF/VI  groups  (7%  to  8%)  due  to  adverse  events  were  similar 
compared  with  placebo  (7%)  and  lower  than  in  the  FF  100  (11%)  and  VI  25  (12%)  groups.  Lack  of 
efficacy resulted in premature withdrawal of 6% of subjects in the FF/VI groups compared with 10% of 
the  placebo  group  and  7%  and  9%  of  the  VI  and  FF  groups,  respectively.  The  majority  of  the 
premature  withdrawals  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  were  due  to  COPD  exacerbation.  The  percentages  of 
subjects  withdrawn  prematurely  due  to  other  reasons  were  low  and  similar  across  the  treatment 
groups.

When reasons for withdrawal were examined by time interval in the study, reasons for withdrawal were 
similar  in  subjects  who  withdrew  within  the  first  12  weeks  of  treatment  and  for  those  who  withdrew 
after  12  weeks  of  treatment.  Across  all  treatment  groups,  the  numbers  of  subjects  withdrawn  during 
the first 12 weeks of treatment were slightly higher than the numbers of subjects withdrawn after 12 
weeks of treatment.

A  total  of  1224  subjects  completed  the  screening  and  run-in  periods,  were  randomized  to  treatment, 
and  received  at  least  one  dose  of  double-blind  study  medication  in  the  treatment  period  (see  table 
below). These subjects comprised the ITT population.  
The majority of subjects in each treatment group (approximately 75% of subjects across the treatment 
groups)  completed  the  study,  and  attendance  at  each  scheduled  clinic  visit  was  generally  high.  The 
percentages of subjects who withdrew from the study were similar across the active treatment groups 
(21% to 29%) and similar to the percentage who withdrew from the placebo group (29%). 
The most common primary reason for premature withdrawal was adverse event, and the percentages 
of  subjects  who  withdrew  from  the  FF/VI  groups  due  to  adverse  events  (8%  and  9%)  were  similar 
compared  with  placebo  (9%)  and  similar  to  the percentages  in  the  FF  100,  FF  200  and  VI  25 groups 
(6%,  7%,  7%  respectively).  Lack  of  efficacy  as  a  reason  for  withdrawal  was  higher  in  the  placebo 
group  (6%)  than  the  active  treatment  groups  (2%  to  5%)  and  the  majority  of  the  premature 
withdrawals  from  lack  of  efficacy  were  due  to  COPD  exacerbation.  The  percentages  of  subjects 
withdrawn prematurely due to other reasons were low (≤5%) and similar across the treatment groups. 
When reasons for withdrawal were examined by time interval in the study, reasons for withdrawal were 
similar  in  subjects  who  withdrew  within  the  first  12  weeks  of  treatment  and  for  those  who  withdrew 
after  12  weeks  of  treatment.  Across  all  treatment  groups,  the  numbers  of  subjects  withdrawn  during 
the first 12 weeks of treatment were slightly higher than the numbers of subjects withdrawn after 12 
weeks of treatment.

Conduct of the study 
The  protocol  was  amended  one  time  for  both  study  HCZ112206  and  study  HCZ112207  and  the 
amendment applied to all study sites. At the effective date of the amendment, 43% (444 of 1031) of 
the subjects had been randomized. 
The amendment was considered not influencing the study results. 
Baseline data 
Study HZC112206 
Within the ITT Population, the majority of the subjects were White (72%) and male (67%); the mean 
age  was  approximately  63  years.  The  mean  body  mass  index  (BMI)  of  26.1  kg/m2  indicates  that 
subjects tended to be slightly overweight. 
The demographic characteristics of the PP Population were similar to those of the ITT Population (see 
table below).

At screening, 39% of the  subjects in the ITT Population had COPD diagnosed between 1 and 5 years 
prior to study entry; 30% had COPD diagnosed between 5 and 10 years prior to study entry (see table 
below). With the exception of 8% of subjects who had a diagnosis made less than one year prior, the 
remainder (22%) had held a COPD diagnosis of 10 years or more. Sixty-one percent of subjects had a 
diagnosis  of  chronic  bronchitis  and  65%  had  a  diagnosis  of  emphysema.  Subjects  could  have  had  a 
diagnosis of both chronic bronchitis and emphysema. 
Table 52.  Summary of COPD History at Screening 
In  the  12  months  prior  to  the  screening  Visit,  90  subjects  (9%)  had  experienced  one  exacerbation 
managed without corticosteroids or antibiotics, and 16 subjects (2%) experienced 2 exacerbations that 
were managed without corticosteroids or antibiotics (Table 5.23). Two subjects (<1%) reported more 
than  2  COPD  exacerbations  managed  without  corticosteroids or  antibiotics.  In  the  12  months prior  to 
screening,  202  subjects  (20%)  had  one  exacerbation  that  required  corticosteroids  or  antibiotics,  31 
subjects  (3%)  had  two  exacerbations  treated  with  corticosteroids  or  antibiotics,  and  10  subjects 
(<1%) had >2 exacerbations that required treatment with corticosteroids. Sixty-seven subjects (7%) 
required  hospitalization  for  one  exacerbation  in  the  12  months  prior  to  screening,  and  4  subjects 
(<1%) had two or more exacerbations that required hospitalization. 
At  screening,  subjects  within  the  ITT  Population  had  smoked  a  mean  of  24  cigarettes  a  day  and  had 
smoked for 38.2 years, with a mean number of pack years of 46.0. The smoking history of the subjects 
was similar across the treatment groups. 
The  smoking  status  of  the  subjects  was  similar  across  the  treatment  groups  at  screening,  during  the 
study (assessed at Day 84) and at the end of the treatment period (see table below).

Table 53.  Summary of Smoking Status (ITT Population) 
The  table  below  summarizes  screening  and  baseline  lung  function  data  of  the  ITT  Population.  At 
screening,  the  mean  post-bronchodilator  FEV1  of  1.41,  mean  post-bronchodilator  percent  predicted 
FEV1  of  48.3%  (broad  range  of  17-72%),  and  the  mean  FEV1/FVC  ratio  of  48%  (broad  range  of  18-
74%)  indicated  that  the  ITT  Population  overall  had  moderate  to  very  severely  impaired  pulmonary 
function.  The  mean  percent  reversibility  (i.e.,  percentage  change  in  FEV1  following  400  mcg  inhaled 
albuterol/salbutamol) of the ITT Population was 15.9%. 
Screening  post-bronchodilator  lung  function  data  were  similar  across  the  treatment  groups.  For  all 
treatment groups, mean pre-bronchodilator lung function at screening was higher than mean baseline 
FEV1. There was imbalance across the treatment groups in screening pre-bronchodilator and baseline 
FEV1 with lower mean values recorded for the FF 100 group and the FF/VI 50/25 group. At baseline the 
mean  value  for  the  FF  100  group  was  1.140  compared  to  a  mean  of  1.268  recorded  for  the  VI  25 
group. Mean baseline FEV1 for subjects who completed the treatment period and those who withdrew 
prior to the end of the treatment period was similar for the VI 25 and FF 50/25 groups. 
However,  it  was  lower  for  the  subjects  who  withdrew  from  the  Placebo,  FF  100  and  FF/VI  100/25 
groups  compared  with  those  who  completed  the  treatment  period  in  these  groups,  indicating  that,  in 
these  groups,  the  subjects  who  withdrew  on  average  had  worse  COPD  in  terms  of  lung  function. 
Various a priori defined sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the results to 
the impact of withdrawals. 
Percent  predicted  FEV1  was  similar  across  the  treatment  groups  at  baseline,  with  generally  higher 
mean % predicted values for the subjects who completed the treatment period compared to those who 
withdrew prior to the end of the treatment period. 
Approximately 90% of the ITT population was either GOLD Stage II or III at screening and 10% of the 
population  was  GOLD  Stage  IV.  Thirty-four  percent  of  the  population  was  reversible  (FEV1  of  ≥12% 
and ≥200 mL following administration of albuterol/salbutamol) and 66% was non-reversible.

below). With the exception of 11% of subjects who had a diagnosis made less than one year prior, the 
remainder (22%) had held a COPD diagnosis of 10 years or more. Sixty-nine percent of subjects had a 
diagnosis  of  chronic  bronchitis  and  59%  had  a  diagnosis  of  emphysema.  Subjects  could  have  had  a

Table 56.  Summary of COPD History at Screening 
In the 12 months prior to the Screening Visit, 128 subjects (10%) had experienced one exacerbation 
managed without corticosteroids or antibiotics, and 9 subjects (<1%) experienced 2 exacerbations that 
were  managed  without  corticosteroids  or  antibiotics  (see  table  below).  Four  subjects  (<1%)  reported 
more  than  2  COPD  exacerbations  managed  without  corticosteroids  or  antibiotics.  In  the  12  months 
prior  to  screening,  250  subjects  (20%)  had  one  exacerbation  that  required  corticosteroids  or 
antibiotics, 32 subjects (3%) had two exacerbations treated with corticosteroids or antibiotics, and 22 
subjects  (2%)  had  >2  exacerbations  that  required  treatment  with  corticosteroids  or  antibiotics.  One 
hundred  and  thirteen  subjects  (9%)  required  hospitalization  for  one  exacerbation  in  the  12  months 
prior to screening, and 9 subjects (<1%) had two or more exacerbations that required hospitalization. 
The  percentages  and  types  of  exacerbations  occurring  prior  to  screening  were  similar  across  the 
treatment groups. 
At  screening,  subjects  within  the  ITT  Population  had  smoked  a  mean  of  23  cigarettes  a  day  and  had 
smoked for a mean of 36.5 years, with a mean number of pack years of 42.5 (see table below). The 
smoking  history  of  the  subjects  was  similar  across  the  treatment  groups;  54%  of  the  subjects  were 
current smokers and 46% were former smokers. At the end of the treatment period, 52% were current 
smokers and 48% were former smokers. 
The  smoking  status  of  the  subjects  was  similar  across  the  treatment  groups  at  screening,  during  the 
study (assessed at Day 84) and at the end of the treatment period (see table below).

Table 57.  Summary of Smoking Status (ITT Population) 
At screening, the mean post-bronchodilator FEV1 of 1.49L, mean percent predicted postbronchodilator 
FEV1  of  47.9%  (broad  range  of  14-87%),  and  the  mean  postbronchodilator  FEV1/FVC  ratio  of  47% 
(broad range of 17-88%) indicated that the ITT Population overall had moderate to severely impaired 
pulmonary function (see table below). 
The mean percent reversibility of the ITT Population was 12%. 
Subjects  in  the  FF/VI  200/25  and  FF  100  groups  were  slightly  less  reversible  than  subjects  in  other 
groups;  Percent  predicted  FEV1  and  FEV1/FVC  ratio  at  screening  were  similar  across  the  treatment 
groups.  For  all  treatment  groups  except  the  FF  200  group,  mean  prebronchodilator  lung  function  at 
screening  was  higher  than  mean  baseline  FEV1.  There  was  imbalance  across the  treatment  groups  in 
screening pre-bronchodilator and baseline FEV1 with lower mean values recorded for the FF 200 group 
and  the  FF/VI  200/25  group.  At  baseline  the  lowest  mean  value  was  recorded  for  the  FF/VI  200/25 
group (1.311) compared to the highest mean value of 1.387 recorded for the FF 100 group. 
Mean baseline FEV1 for subjects who completed the treatment period was higher than for the subjects 
who  withdrew  from  the  Placebo,  FF  100,  FF  200  and  FF/VI  100/25  groups,  indicating  that,  in  these 
groups, the subjects who withdrew on average had worse COPD in terms of lung function. In contrast, 
mean baseline FEV1 for subjects who completed the treatment period was lower than for the subjects 
who withdrew from the VI 25and FF/VI 200/25 groups.

Numbers analysed 
Study HZC112206 
The ITT Population was the population of primary interest for all efficacy and safety endpoints, and this 
population included 1030 subjects who were randomised to and received at least one dose of double-
blind study medication in the treatment period. 
Of  the  1030  subjects  in  the  ITT  population,  983  (95%)  were  included  in  the  Per  Protocol  population. 
These were subjects in the ITT Population not identified as full protocol deviators with respect to RAP-
defined  criteria  that  were  considered  to  impact  the  primary  efficacy  analysis.  The  Per  Protocol 
Population was used for confirmatory analyses of the primary efficacy endpoints only.

Study HCZ112207 
The All-Subjects Enrolled (ASE) population comprised 1909 subjects who were enrolled, had a subject 
number record in the study database, and had at least one status recorded (i.e., screen failure, run-in 
failure, early withdrawal or completed the study). Of these, 683 subjects (36%) were Screen or Run-In 
failures (see table below). 
The Randomized population was not a RAP-defined population, but comprised 1,226 subjects who were 
randomized and given a randomization number. 
The ITT Population was the population of primary interest for all efficacy and safety endpoints, and this

Outcomes and estimation 
Study HZC112206 
Weighted Mean FEV1 (0-4 h) 
Weighted mean FEV1 0-4 hours was one of two co-primary endpoints for this study. This endpoint was 
selected to evaluate the contribution of VI to the combination product. Weighted mean FEV1 0-4 hours 
post-dose was assessed in the clinic on Treatment Days 1 (date of randomization), 14, 56, 84, and 168 
(last  dose  of treatment). The  primary  timepoint  for  this  co-primary endpoint was  Treatment  Day 168 
(Visit 11) and it was analyzed in accordance with the a priori testing strategy defined in the protocol. 
There  was  imbalance  across  the  treatment  groups  in  baseline  FEV1 with  lower  mean  values  recorded 
for  the  FF  100  group  and the  FF/VI  50/25  group  (Placebo,  1.232  L;  FF  100 1.140  L;  VI  25, 1.268 L; 
FF/VI  50/25,  1.195  L;  FF/VI  100/25,  1.227  L).  Adjustments  for  baseline  in  the  statistical  analysis 
models  were  defined  a  priori  in  the  RAP.  On  Treatment  Day  168,  the  FF/VI  100/25  treatment  group 
and the VI treatment group showed statistically significant improvements in weighted mean FEV1 0- 4 
hours post-dose compared with the placebo group. The FF/VI 100/25 group demonstrated an LS mean 
improvement of 173 mL compared with the placebo group. 
The  VI  group  demonstrated  a  103  mL  LS  mean  improvement  compared  with  the  placebo  group. 
Furthermore, the FF/VI 100/25 group demonstrated a statistically significant LS mean improvement of 
120  mL  compared  with  the  FF  100  group,  demonstrating  the  relative  contribution  of  VI  on  lung 
function. 
In  addition,  at  Treatment  Day  168  the  FF/VI  50/25  treatment  group  demonstrated  an  improvement 
compared with placebo (192 mL, p<0.001).

Although  not  designated  primary  treatment  comparisons,  both  FF/VI  groups  demonstrated 
improvements  compared  with  the  VI  group  (p≤0.006)  as  did  the  FF  100  group  compared  with  the 
placebo group (p=0.040).

The  second  co-primary  endpoint  in  this  study  was  change  from  baseline  in  Clinic  Visit  trough  (pre-
bronchodilator  and  pre-dose)  FEV1  on  Treatment  Day  169  (Visit  12).  This  endpoint  was  selected  to 
evaluate  the  contribution  of  FF  in  the  combination  and  the  24-  hour  effect  of  VI.  Clinic  Visit  trough 
FEV1 was  assessed  at  each  clinic  visit  starting  with  Visit  3  (1  day  after  randomization  and  first  dose) 
through  the  last  clinic  visit  (Treatment  Day  169).  Trough  FEV1  was  defined  as  the  mean  of  the  FEV1 
values obtained 23 and 24 hours after dosing on the previous day.

There  was  imbalance  across  the  treatment  groups  in  screening  pre-bronchodilator  and  baseline  FEV1 
with  lower  mean  values  recorded  for  the  FF  100  group  and  the  FF/VI  50/25  group.  At  baseline  the 
mean  value  for  the  FF  100  group  was  1.140  compared  with  a  mean  of  1.268  recorded  for  the  VI  25 
group.  Adjustments  for  baseline  in the  statistical  analysis  models  were defined  a priori in  the  RAP.  On 
Treatment  Day 169, the  FF/VI  100/25  and  VI  groups  showed  statistically  significant  improvements  in 
LS mean change from baseline trough FEV1 compared with the placebo group. The FF/VI 100/25 group 
showed an LS mean change from baseline improvement of 115mL compared with the placebo group; 
the VI group showed a 67mL LS mean change from baseline improvement compared with the placebo 
group.  However,  the  FF/VI  100/25  group  did  not  show  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  LS 
mean change from baseline trough FEV1 compared with the VI group, although there was a numerical 
improvement of 48 mL. 
As a result of the primary comparison of FF/VI 100/25 against VI not achieving statistical significance 
at  the  5%  level  for  the  co-primary  endpoint  of  trough  FEV1  at  Day  169,  the  restrictions  of  the  step-
down testing procedure have not been met and therefore the results of all further statistical analyses 
are interpreted descriptively. 
In  addition  to  the  primary  treatment  comparison,  on  Treatment  Day  169,  the  FF/VI  50/25  group 
showed  improvement  in  LS  mean  change  from  baseline  trough  FEV1  compared  with  both  placebo 
(p<0.001) and the VI group (p=0.025) (see table below). 
Although not designated a primary treatment comparison, the FF/VI 100/25 group also demonstrated 
an  improvement  in  LS  mean  change  from  baseline  trough  FEV1  compared  with  the  FF  100  group 
(p=0.003) (see table below).

Weighted Mean FEV1 (0-4 h) 
Weighted mean FEV1 0-4 hours was one of two co-primary endpoints for this study. This endpoint was 
selected to evaluate the contribution of VI to the combination product. Weighted mean FEV1 0-4 hours 
post-dose was assessed in the clinic on Treatment Days 1 (date of randomization), 14, 56, 84, and 168 
(last  dose  of treatment). The  primary  timepoint  for  this  co-primary endpoint was  Treatment  Day 168 
(Visit 11) and it was analyzed in accordance with the a priori testing strategy defined in the protocol. 
There  was  imbalance  across  the  treatment groups  in  baseline  FEV1  with lower  mean  values  recorded 
for the FF 200 group and the FF/VI 200/25 group (Placebo; 1.332L, FF 100; 1.387L, FF 200; 1.317L; 
VI  25;  1.360L;  FF/VI  100/25;  1.349L  and  FF/VI  200/25;  1.311L.  Adjustments  for  baseline  in  the 
statistical  analysis  models  were  defined  a  priori  in  the  RAP.  On  Treatment  Day  168,  the  VI  25  and 
FF/VI  200/25  treatment  groups  showed  clinically  meaningful,  statistically  significant  improvements  in 
weighted mean FEV1 0-4 hours post-dose compared with the placebo group. The FF/VI 200/25 group 
demonstrated  an  LS  mean  improvement  of  209  mL  compared  with  the  placebo  group.  The  VI  group 
demonstrated  a  185  mL  LS  mean  improvement  compared  with  the  placebo  group.  Furthermore,  the 
FF/VI  200/25  group  demonstrated  a  clinically  meaningful,  statistically  significant  LS  mean 
improvement of 168 mL compared with the FF 200 group, demonstrating the relative contribution of VI 
on lung function. 
In  addition,  at  Treatment  Day  168  the  FF/VI  100/25  treatment  group  demonstrated  an  improvement 
compared with placebo (214 mL, p<0.001) and compared with FF 100 (168 mL, p<0.001).

Trough FEV1 
The  second  co-primary  endpoint  in  this  study  was  change  from  baseline  in  Clinic  Visit  trough  (pre-
bronchodilator  and  pre-dose)  FEV1  on  Treatment  Day  169  (Visit  12).  This  endpoint  was  selected  to 
evaluate  the  contribution  of  FF  in  the  combination  and  the  24-  hour  effect  of  VI.  Trough  FEV1  was 
assessed at each clinic visit starting with Visit 3 (1 day after randomization and first dose) through the 
last clinic Visit (Treatment Day 169). 
Trough  FEV1  was  defined  as  the  mean  of  the  FEV1  values  obtained  23  and  24  hours  after  dosing  on 
the  previous  day.  There  was  imbalance  across  the  treatment  groups  in  Screening  pre-bronchodilator 
and baseline FEV1, with lower mean values recorded for the FF 200 group and the FF/VI 200/25 group. 
At baseline, the mean values were: Placebo; 1.332L, FF 100; 1.387L, FF 200; 1.317L; VI 25; 1.360L; 
FF/VI  100/25;  1.349L  and  FF/VI  200/25;  1.311L.  Adjustments  for  baseline  in  the  statistical  analysis 
models were defined a priori in the RAP. 
On Treatment Day 169, the FF/VI 200/25 and VI groups showed statistically significant improvements 
in  LS  mean  change  from  baseline  trough  FEV1  compared  with  the  placebo  group.  The  FF/VI  200/25 
group  demonstrated  a  least  squares  mean  change  from  baseline  improvement  of  131  mL  compared 
with  the  placebo  group;  the  VI  group  demonstrated  a  100  mL  LS  mean  change  from  baseline 
improvement compared with the placebo group.

However,  the  FF/VI  200/25  group  did  not  show  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  LS  mean 
change  from  baseline  trough  FEV1  compared  with  the  VI  group,  although  there  was  a  numerical

As a result of the primary comparison of FF/VI 200/25 against VI not achieving statistical significance 
at  the  5%  level  for  the  co-primary  endpoint  of  trough  FEV1  at  Day  169,  the  restrictions  of  the  step-

In addition to the primary treatment comparisions for the FF/VI 200/25 group, on Treatment Day 169, 
the FF/VI 100/25 group showed improvement in LS mean change from baseline trough FEV1 compared 
with placebo (p<0.001) (see table below). 
Although  not  designated  a  primary  treatment  comparison,  the  FF/VI  200/25  and  100/25 groups  both 
also demonstrated an improvement in LS mean change from baseline trough FEV1 compared with the 
FF 200 and FF 100 groups respectively (p<0.001) (see table below).

affiliation with the investigator site. 
Treatments 
All  blinded  dry  powder  formulations  of  FF/VI  and  VI  were  administered  via  an  NDPI;  each  inhaler 
containing a total of 30 doses (60 blisters). 
Each actuation delivered the contents of one blister from each of two internal foil strips simultaneously. 
Relvar Ellipta  
Assessment report

Subjects received open-label FP/SAL 250/50 during the run-in period. Subjects were instructed to take 
1  inhalation  each  morning  and  evening  with  approximately  12  hours  between  doses.  In  addition,  all 
subjects  received  supplemental  albuterol/salbutamol  (MDI  and/or  nebules)  to  be  used  as  needed 
throughout the study. This rescue medication was sourced by the Applicant for sites in the USA, for all 
other sites it was sourced locally. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  safety  and  efficacy  of  FF/VI  50/25  mcg,  100/25 
mcg  and  200/25  mcg  versus  VI  25  mcg  on  the  annual  rate  of  moderate  and severe  exacerbations  in 
subjects  with  COPD  over a  52-week  treatment  period.  All dosing  was  once-daily  in  the  morning.  This 
study  evaluated  the  contribution  of  the  ICS  component  on  reducing  the  annual  rate  of  moderate-
severe exacerbations when used in combination with a fixed dose of the LABA in subjects with COPD. 
Secondary  objectives  in  this  study  were  to  evaluate  long  term  safety  and  other  efficacy  assessments 
and to further investigate any reported cases of pneumonia in subjects with COPD. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
•  Annual rate of moderate and severe exacerbations. 
•  Mean change from baseline in clinic visit trough (prebronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 at the 
end of the 28-day treatment period. 
Secondary endpoints 
• 
Time to first moderate or severe exacerbation. 
•  Annual rate of exacerbations requiring systemic/oral corticosteroids. 
•  Change from baseline in trough FEV1 at Visit 11. 
Sample size 
Sample size calculations were based on the primary endpoint, the annual rate of moderate and severe 
exacerbations and on the comparison of each FF/VI combination arm compared with the VI-alone arm. 
The annual rate of moderate and severe exacerbations in the VI treatment arm was assumed to be 1.4 
based  on  estimates  of  1.40  to  1.59  from  the  salmeterol  arms  of  the  FP/SAL  combination  studies 
[Kardos,  2007;  [Ferguson,  2008].  Estimates  of  the  dispersion  parameter  in  previous  FP/SAL  studies 
have  been  0.7  [Calverley,  2007];  0.46  [Calverley,  2003];  0.48  [Ferguson,  2008]  and  0.47  [Kardos, 
2007].  As  the  current  study  was  a  multicenter,  international  study  the  higher  estimate  of  dispersion 
was used in the sample size calculation. A study with 390 evaluable subjects per arm had 90% power 
to  detect  a  25%  reduction  in  the  annual  rate  of  moderate  and  severe  exacerbations  on  a  FF/VI 
combination  arm  compared  with  the  VI-alone  arm.  Calculations  were  based  on  a  Negative  Binomial 
regression  and  used  a  two-sided  5%  significance  level.  No  adjustments  in  the  type  I  error  for 
multiplicity were made due to the step-down testing procedure employed. 
Subjects  were  randomized  in  equal  proportions  to  all  four  treatment  groups  and  all  randomized 
subjects  were  considered  to  be  evaluable,  irrespective  of  whether  they  withdrew  from  the  study 
prematurely. Therefore, 1560 evaluable (randomized) subjects (390 subjects per treatment arm) were 
required.  Assuming  a  40%  screening  and  run-in  failure  rate,  2600  subjects  were  planned  to  be 
screened.

A  two-sided  5%  risk  associated  with  incorrectly  rejecting  the  null  hypothesis  (significance  level)  was 
considered acceptable for this study. 
Randomisation 
The  central  randomization  schedule  was  generated  by  the  Applicant  using  a  validated  computerized 
system  (RandAll).  Subjects  were  randomized  using  Registration  and  Medication  Ordering  System 
(RAMOS): an automated, IVRS which was used by the investigator or designee to register the subject, 
randomize the subject and receive medication assignment information. 
Following  the  run-in  period,  eligible  subjects  were  randomized  (1:1:1:1)  to  one  of  four  double-blind 
treatments  delivered  by  NDPI  once  daily  in  the  morning  for  52  weeks  (FF/VI  50/25,  FF/VI  100/25, 
FF/VI 200/25, or VI 25). Randomization was stratified by smoking status. 
Blinding (masking) 
This  was  a  double-blind  study.  Neither  the  subject  nor  the  investigator  knew  which  study  medication 
the  subject  was  receiving,  and  the  NDPIs  containing  randomized  treatment  appeared identical on  the 
outside to the subject (and his/her caregiver) and the investigator. 
Statistical methods 
This  was  a  superiority  study.  The  primary  comparisons  of  interest  were  the  pair-wise  comparisons  of 
each  dose  regimen  of  FF/VI  with  VI  alone  for  the  primary  endpoint  the  annual  rate  of  moderate  and 
severe  exacerbations.  Inference  was  restricted  by  the  stepdown  multiplicity  strategy.  All  primary 
comparisons were performed at the 5% significance level and used the ITT Population. 
The  primary  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  the  annual  rate  of  moderate  and  severe 
exacerbations  was  performed  on  the  ITT  population  using  a  generalized  linear  model,  assuming  the 
Negative  Binomial  distribution.  The  response  variable  was  the  number  of  recorded,  on-treatment, 
moderate  and  severe  exacerbations  experienced  per  subject.  The  explanatory  variables  were 
treatment  group,  smoking  status  at  screening  (stratification  variable),  baseline  disease  severity  (as 
percent  predicted  FEV1)  and  center  grouping.  The  model  also  included  the  logarithm  of  time  on 
treatment per subject (derived from exposure start and stop) as an offset variable. 
The  least  squares  (LS)  mean  exacerbation  rates  per  year,  pair-wise  treatment  ratios  for  each  FF/VI 
strength  against  VI  alone,  and  associated  p-values  and  95%  confidence  limits  were  presented. 
Percentage  reduction  in  exacerbation  rates  per  year  and  associated  95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs) 
were also presented.

Results 
Participant flow 
Study HZC102871 
A  total of  1622  subjects were  included  in  the  ITT  Population.  The  majority  of  subjects  completed the 
study  (75%).  The  number  of  subjects  completing  the  treatment  period  was  similar  across  the 
treatment groups, with the least completers reported for the VI 25 group (72% of subjects). Subjects 
were  enrolled  at  167  centers  in  15  countries  (Argentina,  Australia,  Canada,  Chile,  Estonia,  Germany, 
Italy,  Mexico,  Netherlands,  Peru,  Philippines,  South  Africa,  Sweden,  UK,  and  USA)  (Table  5.08). 
Countries/centers  were  grouped  as  follows:  USA,  European  Union  (included  Estonia,  Germany,  Italy, 
Netherlands, Sweden, and UK), Other 1 (included Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Philippines), and 
Other 2 (included Australia, Canada, and South Africa). 
Overall, the most common primary reason for premature withdrawal was AE (107 subjects, 7%); the 
incidence of AEs leading to premature withdrawal was lowest in the VI 25 group (22 subjects, 5%) and 
highest in the FF/VI 200/25 group (31 subjects, 8%). Ninety-one subjects (6%) withdrew their consent 
and  were  thus  withdrawn  from  the  study:  34  subjects  (8%)  in  the  VI  25  group,  18  subjects  (4%)  in 
the FF/VI 50/25 group, 17 subjects (4%) in the FF/VI 100/25 group, and 22 subjects (5%) in the FF/VI 
200/25 group. In total, 42 subjects (3%) withdrew for a primary reason of lack of efficacy with a sub-
reason  of  exacerbation:  15  subjects  (4%)  in  the  VI  25  group,  10  subjects  (2%)  in  the  FF/VI  50/25 
group,  four  subjects  (<1%)  in  the  FF/VI  100/25  group,  and  13  subjects  (3%)  in  the  FF/VI  200/25 
group. 
A  summary  of  the  end  of  study  record  split  by  treatment  period  quarterly  intervals  and  shows  that 
almost  half  of  all  the  subject  withdrawals  occurred  during  Q1:  total  195  subjects  (12%  of  all  ITT 
subjects)  compared  with  56  to  72  subjects  withdrawing  (3  to  4%  of  all  ITT  subjects)  across  the 
remaining three study quarters of the study period. Reasons for withdrawal were similar across all four 
study quarters.

A total of 1633 subjects were included in the ITT Population (see table below). The majority of subjects 
completed  the  study  (73%).  The  number  of  subjects  completing  the  treatment  period  was  similar 
across the treatment groups, with the least completers reported for the VI 25 group (70% of subjects). 
Subjects  were  enrolled  at  183  centres  in  15  countries.  For  the  purposes  of  statistical  analyses, 
countries/centres were grouped as follows: USA, European Union (included Denmark, Germany, Italy, 
The  Netherlands,  Spain,  Sweden,  UK,  Other  1  (which  included  Argentina,  Chile,  Mexico,  Peru),  and 
Other 2 (which included Australia, Canada, South Africa) (Table 5.09 and RAP appendix). 
Overall,  the  most  common  primary  reason  for  premature  withdrawal  was  adverse  event  (AE)  (122 
subjects, 7%) and Withdrew consent (102 subjects, 6%). In total, 44 subjects (3%) withdrew for lack 
of  efficacy  due  to  an  exacerbation.  For  the  VI  25  group,  more  than  double  the  number  of  subjects 
reported  lack  of  efficacy  due  to  an  exacerbation  (20  subjects,  5%)  compared  with  the  FF/VI  groups 
(seven to nine subjects, all 2%). 
A  summary  of  the  end  of  study  record  split  by  treatment  period  quarterly  intervals  shows  that  most 
subjects withdrew during Quarter 1: total 229 subjects (14% of all ITT subjects) compared with 55-90 
subjects  withdrawing  (3  to  6%  of  all  ITT  subject)  across  the  remaining  four  quarters  of  the  study 
period. Reasons for withdrawal were similar across all four study Quarters.

Study HZC102871 
Within  the  ITT  Population,  the  majority  of  the  subjects  were  White  (82%)  and  more  than  half  of  the 
subjects  were  male  (59%);  the  mean  age  was  63.6  years  (see  table  below).  The  mean  body  mass 
index (BMI) of 26.69 kg/m2 indicates that subjects tended to be overweight. 
The  demographic  characteristics  were  similar  across  the  treatment  groups.  The  demographic 
characteristics of the PP Population were similar to those of the ITT Population.

Table 67.  Summary of Demographic Characteristics (ITT Population) 
At screening, most subjects in the ITT Population had a COPD diagnosis for between 1 and <10 years 
(≥1  and  <5  years:  593  subjects  [37%];  ≥5  and  <10  years:  509  subjects  [31%]).  The  duration  of 
COPD  was  similar  across  the  treatment  groups.  A  total  of  42%  of  subjects  reportedly  suffered  from 
chronic bronchitis alone, 35% from emphysema alone, and 23% from both. 
In  the  12  months  prior  to  the  screening  Visit,  the  majority  of  subjects  (1502  subjects,  93%)  had 
experienced at least 1 exacerbation that required oral/systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics (not 
involving  hospitalization).  In  total,  317  subjects  (20%)  required  hospitalization  for  at  least  1 
exacerbation in the 12 months prior to the screening visit. The incidence of hospitalizations was similar 
across the treatment groups. 
At  screening,  the  mean  number  of  smoking  pack-years  was  47.5.  Assessment  of  smoking  status  at 
screening showed that 685 subjects (42%) in the ITT Population were current smokers. At the end of 
the  52-week treatment  period,  39% of  subjects  were  current  smokers.  Smoking  status  was  balanced 
between the treatment groups and the majority of subjects did not change their smoking status during 
the course of the study (see table below).

Outcomes and estimation 
Study HZC102871 
For  the  primary  endpoint  of  the  annual  rate  of  moderate  and  severe  exacerbations,  the  primary 
comparison of interest was the pair-wise comparison of each strength of FF/VI with VI alone for the ITT 
Population.  In  order  to  account  for  multiplicity  across  treatment  comparisons  and  key  endpoints,  a 
step-down  testing  procedure  was  applied,  whereby  inference  for  a  test  in  the  pre-defined  hierarchy 
was  dependent  upon  statistical  significance  having  been  achieved  for  the  previous  tests  in  the 
hierarchy. 
For  the  primary  analysis  (ITT  population  using  a  negative  binomial  model)  of  the  primary  endpoint, 
compared with VI 25, treatment with FF/VI at all strengths provided a numeric improvement in the LS 
mean annual rate of moderate and severe exacerbations, with a 13% (p=0.181), 34% (p<0.001), and 
15% (p=0.109) reduction for FF/VI 50/25, 100/25 and 200/25, respectively. As statistical significance 
was  not  achieved  for  the comparison  of  FF/VI  200/25  vs.  VI  25  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  all 
further statistical analyses are described but are not strictly inferential.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Asthma indication 
The  Applicant  provided  a  pooled  efficacy  analysis  named  Integrated  Asthma  Clinical  Studies  that 
includes  the  three  main  clinical  studies,  one  parallel  group  Phase  III  study  with  FF  alone  (study 
FFA112059) and one safety study designed to explore the effects of FF/VI on HPA axis system (study 
HZA106851).  
Study  FFA112059  is  a  multicentre,  randomised,  placebo  controlled  (with  rescue  medication),  double-
blind, double-dummy, parallel group study. Subjects meeting all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion  criteria  during  Visit  1  entered  a  4-week  run-in  period  during  which  they  remained  on  their 
baseline inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) medication. At Visit 2, subjects meeting the eligibility criteria were 
randomised to receive one of the following three double blind treatments in a 1:1:1 ratio for 24 weeks 
(168 days): FF 100 mcg inhalation powder once daily (OD [omen in die]) in the evening plus placebo 
twice daily (BD [bis in die]), fluticasone propionate (FP) 250 mcg BD plus placebo OD in the evening, 
or placebo OD in the evening and placebo BD. 
Study  HZA106851  is  a  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  parallel-group,  placebo-  (double-
dummy)  and  active-  (prednisolone  10mg)  controlled  study  in  subjects  12  to  65  years  of  age  with 
persistent  asthma.  Subjects  who  satisfied  all  the  inclusion/  exclusion  criteria  at  the  Screening  Visit 
(Visit 1) entered a 7 to 14-day run-in period. At the end to the run-in period subjects were randomised 
to  receive  6  weeks  treatment  with  FF/VI  200/25  mcg,  FF/VI  100/25  mcg,  placebo,  or  placebo  + 
prednisolone 10mg (last 7 days of treatment only). At Visit 4 (Day 28), each subject was provided 10 
blinded capsules (placebo or prednisolone 10 mg) and instructed to take one capsule each morning on 
the last 7 days of treatment. 
Demographic characteristics of Integrated Asthma studies are provided in the table below.

Main outcome (weighted mean FEV1 0-4 hours at Day 168) 
The  table  below  summarizes  the  statistical  analyses  of  the  integrated  data  for  the  main  outcome 
(weighted mean FEV1 0-4 hours at Day 168): FF/VI (50/25, 100/25 and 200/25) and VI 25 treatment 
groups demonstrated significant improvements in weighted mean FEV1 0-4 hours post-dose compared 
with  the  placebo  group;  FF/VI  100/25  and  200/25  groups  demonstrated  significant  improvements  in 
weighted mean FEV1 0-4 hours post-dose compared with the respective FF group, demonstrating the 
relative  contribution  of  VI  on  lung  function.  There  was  no  evidence  of  a  dose  response  between  the 
FF/VI 50/25, 100/25 and 200/25 groups.

- Integrated Results: HZC112206 and HZC112207 
Co-primary endpoint: trough FEV1 at Day 169 
The  table  below  presents  a  summary  of  the  statistical  analysis  of  the  mean  change  from  baseline  in 
trough FEV1 at Day 169 for the integrated data. Consistent with the results for the individual studies 
HZC112206 and HZC112207, results of the integrated analyses showed the following: 
•  All  three  FF/VI  combination  groups  and  the  VI  25  group  demonstrated  statistically  significant 
improvements  in  the  LS  mean  change  from  baseline  trough  FEV1  compared  with  the  placebo 
group.  The  improvements  were  generally  similar  across  the  FF/VI  50/25,  FF/VI  100/25  and 
FF/VI 200/25 groups, 138 mL 129 mL and 119 mL, respectively. 
•  Consistent  with  the  HZC112206  results,  the  integrated  analysis  showed  that  the  FF/VI  50/25 
group demonstrated an improvement of 55 mL compared with the VI 25 group (p=0.020); The 
FF/VI  100/25  group  demonstrated  an  improvement  of  46  mL  compared  with  the  VI  25  group 
(p=0.017), while the p-values for the improvement observed between the FF/VI 100/25 and VI 
25 groups (45-48 mL) are 0.093 and 0.082, respectively, for the individual studies. 
•  Consistent with the results of the HZC112207 results, the integrated analysis showed that the 
36  mL  increase  for  FF/VI  200/25  compared  with  VI  25  alone  was  not  statistically  significant 
(p=0.124).

•  Although not defined as a primary treatment comparison, the FF/VI 100/25 and FF/VI 200/25 
groups  also  demonstrated  improvements  of  91mL  and  123  mL,  respectively,  compared  with 
the respective FF alone group (p<0.001). 
• 
There was no evidence of a dose-response relationship between any of the FF/VI groups.

The table below presents a summary of the statistical analysis of the analysis results for annual rate of 
moderate  or  severe  COPD  exacerbations  for  the  integrated  data.  The  pooled  analysis  demonstrated 
that  all  three  strengths  of  FF/VI  provided  significantly  (p≤0.014)  greater  reductions  in  the  LS  mean 
annual rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations compared with VI 25 treatment alone, with the 
FF/VI 100/25 group demonstrating the greatest reduction (27%; p<0.001). The percentage reduction 
in  the  FF/VI  50/25-treated  group  (16%;  p=0.014)  was  less  than  that  observed  in  the  FF/VI  100/25-
treated group and that there was no efficacy advantage of the FF/VI 200/25 strength over the 100/25 
strength.

A Poisson analysis of on-treatment moderate or severe COPD exacerbations (using the ITT population) 
for  the  integrated  dataset  for  studies  HZC102871  and  HZC102970  showed  similar  results  than  the 
negative  binomial  analysis  for  the  integrated  data  as  presented  in  the  previous  table.  FF/VI  100/25 
showed a 25% relative percent reduction in the annual rate of exacerbations compared with VI 25. 
In terms of patients with exacerbations, both the FF/VI 100/25 and 200/25 doses had a 42% rate of 
exacerbators,  compared  with  49%  of  exacerbators  in  the  VI  25  group,  which  means  a  15%  relative 
difference and a 7% absolute difference. The FF/VI 200/25 dose achieved the lowest number of severe 
exacerbations (64 cases) compared with 75 cases with the FF/VI 100/25 dose and 83 cases with the VI 
25  dose,  while  the  FF/VI  100/25  dose  achieved  the  lowest  number  of  exacerbations  leading  to 
withdrawal or increase in rescue medication. 
Time to First Moderate or Severe Exacerbation (Kaplan-Meier analysis) 
Results of the pooled analysis showed that there was no efficacy advantage of FF/VI 200/25 strength 
over the 100/25 strength, with HR of 0.75 and 0.76 versus VI 25, respectively. 
Annual Rate of Exacerbations Requiring Systemic/Oral Corticosteroids 
Results  of  the  pooled  analysis  showed  that  there  was  no  efficacy  advantage  of  the  FF/VI  200/25 
strength over the 100/25 strength, with HR of 0.73 and 0.70 versus VI 25, respectively. 
Trough FEV1 at Week 52 for studies HZC102871 and HZC102970 
The  pooled  analysis  shows  a  statistically  significant,  although  not  clinically  relevant  improvement  in 
trough  FEV1  at  Week  52  in  subjects  in  the  FF/VI  groups  compared  with  the  VI  25  group  (differences 
ranging from 38 to 46 mL; p<0.001 for all comparisons). Consistent with the results for the individual 
studies,  the  results  for  the  integrated  analysis  demonstrate  the  poor  contribution  of  FF  on  lung 
function. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Asthma indication 
No dedicated studies in special populations have been conducted. The pivotal clinical studies submitted 
with this application included patients ≥ 12 years and > 65 years, but the numbers were too small to 
allow  statistical  analysis  for  most  treatment  groups.In  an  integrated  analysis a  numerical  benefit  was 
seen for FF/VI over placebo and over FF alone in trough FEV1 in both age groups at Week 2, Week 12 
and Week 24.  
COPD 
No dedicated studies in special populations have been conducted. The subgroup analyses provided did 
not  show  clinically  relevant  interaction of  baseline  characteristics  [age,  race, gender,  smoking  status, 
geographical  region,  reversibility,  percent-predicted  FEV1,  spirometric  COPD  severity  (moderate, 
severe), cardiovascular history], on the effect on lung function or exacerbations.

Study HZA113091 
Study HZA113091 was a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group study 
to  investigate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  FF/VI  100/25  mcg  via  Novel  Dry  Powder  Inhaler  (NDPI) 
administered  once  daily  in  the  evening  and  FP/salmeterol  250/50  mcg  via  Accuhaler/Diskus 
administered twice daily. Following screening to assess eligibility and a 4-week run-in period, subjects 
were  randomised  to  receive  either  FF/VI  100/25  mcg  via  NDPI  once  daily  (evening)  plus  placebo  via 
Accuhaler/Diskus 
twice  daily  (morning  and  evening),  or  FP/salmeterol  250/50  mcg  via 
Accuhaler/Diskus  twice daily (morning and evening) plus placebo via NDPI once daily (evening). The 
treatment  phase  of  the  study  comprised  a  24-week  treatment  period.  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint 
was weighted mean for 24 h serial FEV1 (see first table below). The secondary efficacy measures were 
individual  serial  FEV1  assessments  at  the  end  of  the  24-week  treatment  period  (see  second  table 
below).

COPD indication 
Three supportive 12-week (3-month) studies (studies HZC113107, HZC113109 and HZC112352) are 
described below. 
Study HZC113107 
Study  HZC113107  was  a  12-Week  phase  III  mulicentre  study  to  Evaluate  the  24  Hour  Pulmonary 
Function of Fluticasone Furoate (FF)/Vilanterol (VI) Inhalation Powder (FF/VI Inhalation Powder) Once 
Daily Compared with Salmeterol/Fluticasone Propionate (FP) Inhalation Powder Twice Daily in Subjects 
with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.  
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  24  hour  spirometric effect  (forced  expiratory 
volume  in  1  second  [FEV1])  of  FF/VI  inhalation  powder  100/25  mcg  once  daily  compared  with 
salmeterol/FP inhalation powder 50/500 mcg twice daily over a 12 week treatment period in subjects 
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
Methodology 
This  was  a  multicentre,  randomised  (1:1),  stratified  (subject’s  reversibility  to  salbutamol),  double-
blind,  double-dummy,  12-week  parallel-group  study  evaluating  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  treatment 
with  FF/VI  (GW685698/GW642444)  100/25  once  daily  (OD  [omne  in  die])  (in  the  morning)  versus 
salmeterol/FP 50/500 twice daily (BID [bis in die])  on lung function in  subjects with COPD. At Visit 1 
(Screening Visit, start of run-in period), subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion  criteria  entered  a  2-week,  single-blind  (placebo),  run-in  period  to  obtain  baseline 
assessments  of  salbutamol  use  and  to  evaluate  the  subject’s  adherence  with  study  treatment  and 
procedures, diary card completion and assessment of disease stability. An initial supply of salbutamol 
(a short-acting, beta2-agonist) was provided to each subject to use as needed for symptomatic relief 
of  COPD  symptoms  during  both  the  run-in  and  treatment  periods.  The  overall  study  duration 
(Screening to Follow-up) for subjects who completed the study was approximately 15 weeks.

Number of subjects 
It was planned to randomise approximately 500 subjects to double-blind medication to ensure at least 
425  subjects  completed  the  12-week  treatment  period.  A  total  of  702  subjects  were  screened  and, 
after Screening and run-in failures, 528 subjects were randomised and received study treatment. 
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion 
Males  or  females,  ≥40  years  of  age  at  Screening  with  an  established  clinical  history  of  COPD  in 
accordance  with  the  definition  by  the  American  Thoracic  Society/European  Respiratory  Society  were 
eligible  for  inclusion.  Subjects  were  current  or  previous  cigarette  smokers  with  a  history  of  cigarette 
smoking  of  ≥10  pack-years  at  Screening.  Subjects  were  required  to  have  a  post-salbutamol 
FEV1/forced  vital  capacity  ratio  of  ≤0.70  and  a  post-salbutamol  FEV1  of  ≤70%  of  predicted  normal 
values  at  Visit  1  (Screening)  calculated  using  National  Health  and  Nutrition  Examination  Survey  III 
reference  equations.  Subjects  were  also  required  to  have  been  hospitalised  or  treated  with  oral 
corticosteroids or antibiotics for their COPD within the last 3 years prior to Visit 1 (Screening). 
Treatment administration 
At Visit 2 (Randomisation Visit), following the 2-week run-in period, eligible subjects were randomised 
(1:1)  to  1  of  the  following  2  possible  treatments,  administered  as  1  inhalation  each  morning  and 
evening for 12 weeks: FF/VI 100/25 OD and Salmeterol/FP 50/500 BID. 
Criteria for evaluation 
The primary endpoint was change  from baseline trough in 24-hour weighted-mean serial FEV1 at the 
end of 12 weeks of treatment on Treatment Day 84 (Visit 5). The secondary endpoints were: - Time to 
onset  (increase  of  100  mL  above  baseline  in  FEV1)  on  Treatment  Day  1  (Visit  2);  -  Change  from 
baseline  in  trough  FEV1  at  the  end  of  12  weeks  of  treatment  on  Treatment  Day  85  (24th  hour 
assessment at Visit 5). 
Statistical methods 
A total of 212 evaluable subjects in each of the active treatment groups would provide 90% power to 
detect  a  difference  between  FF/VI  and  salmeterol/FP  of  60  mL  in  weighted  mean  FEV1  at  Week  12, 
assuming  a  standard  deviation  of  190  mL  and  a  2-sided,  5%  significance  level.  Allowing  for  a  15% 
withdrawal  rate  post-randomisation,  250  subjects  were  planned  to  be  randomised  to  both  active 
treatment  arms.  This  was  a  superiority  study.  The  primary  analysis  used  an  analysis  of  covariance 
(ANCOVA)  model.  Covariates  included  baseline  FEV1,  reversibility  stratum,  smoking  status  (at 
Screening), and treatment. 
Demographics 
A  total  of  528  subjects  completed  the  Screening  and  run-in  periods,  were  randomly  assigned  to 
treatment and received at least 1 dose of double-blind study medication in the treatment period (ITT 
Population). 
Efficacy 
The  current  study  was  unable  to  demonstrate  a  statistically  significant  improvement  for  the  primary 
endpoint,  change  from  baseline  trough  in  24-hour  weighted-mean  FEV1  on  Treatment  Day  84, 
between the FF/VI 100/25 OD treatment group and the salmeterol/FP 50/500 BID.  The least squares 
(LS)  mean  change  from  baseline  trough  in  24-hour  weighted-mean  FEV1  on  Treatment  Day  84  was 
130  ml  in  the  FF/VI  100/25  OD  treatment  group  and  108  ml  in  the  salmeterol/FP  50/500  BID 
treatment group (Dif: 22 ml; 95% CI: -18 ml to 63 ml; p = 0.282).

No  statistical  differences  were  found  between  the  treatment  groups  for  the  secondary  efficacy 
parameters of time to onset on Treatment Day 1 (p=0.280) or change from baseline in trough FEV1 on 
Treatment  Day  85  (p=0.294).  The  median  time  to  onset  was  16  and  28  minutes  post-dosing  for  the 
FF/VI 100/25 OD and salmeterol/FP 50/500 BID treatment groups, respectively. The LS mean change 
from baseline in trough FEV1 on Treatment Day 85 (24 hour assessment at Visit 5) was 0.111 L in the 
FF/VI  100/25  OD  treatment  group  and 0.088  L in  the  salmeterol/FP  50/500 BID  treatment group;  as 
for  the  primary  endpoint; the  difference  between the  treatment  groups  was  not  clinically  meaningful. 
There was no statistical difference between the treatment groups for SGRQ-C Total Score. There was a 
nominal  statistical  difference  in  favour  of  the  salmeterol/FP  50/500  BID  treatment  group,  compared 
with the FF/VI 100/25 OD treatment group, in the percentage of responders for the anxiety/depression 
dimension  of  the  EuroQol  Questionnaire  (EQ-5D)  at  Visit  5  (p=0.049).  No  other  dimensions  showed 
any statistical differences between the 2 treatment groups. 
Study HZC113109 
Study  HZC113109  was  a  12-Week  multicentre  phase  III  study  to  Evaluate  the  24-Hour  Pulmonary 
Function  Profile  of  Fluticasone  Furoate  /Vilanterol  (FF/VI)  Inhalation  Powder  100/25mcg  Once  Daily 
Compared  with  Fluticasone  Propionate/Salmeterol  Inhalation  Powder  250/50mcg  Twice  Daily  in 
Subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  24  hour  spirometry  effect  (forced  expiratory 
volume  in  1  second  [FEV1])  of  FF/VI  100/25  mcg  once  daily  (OD)  compared  with  fluticasone 
propionate (FP)/salmeterol 250/50 mcg BID over a 12-week treatment period in subjects with COPD. 
Methodology 
This was a multicentre, randomised (1:1), stratified (subject’s reversibility to albuterol [salbutamol]), 
double-blind, double-dummy, 12-week parallel-group study evaluating the effects of once daily in the 
morning  treatment  of  FF/VI  inhalation  powder  100/25  mcg  versus  FP/salmeterol  inhalation  powder 
250/50 mcg twice daily on lung function in subjects with COPD. 
At  Visit  1  (Screening  Visit,  start  of  run-in  period),  subjects  who  met  all  of  the  inclusion  criteria  and 
none of the exclusion criteria entered a 2-week, single-blind (placebo), run-in period to obtain baseline 
assessments  of  albuterol  (salbutamol)  use  and  to  evaluate  the  subject’s  adherence  with  study 
treatment and procedures, diary card completion and assessment of disease stability. An initial supply 
of albuterol (salbutamol), a short-acting, beta2-agonist (SABA), was provided to each subject to use as 
needed for symptomatic relief of COPD symptoms during both the run-in and treatment periods. 
The  subject’s  use  of  albuterol  (salbutamol)  was  assessed  at  each  clinic  visit  and  additional  albuterol 
(salbutamol)  was  dispensed  to  the  subject  as  needed.  Ipratropium  bromide  alone  was  permitted, 
provided  that  the  subject  was  on  a  stable  dose  from  Visit  1  (Screening)  and  remained  on  the  stable 
dose  throughout  the  study.  The  overall  study  duration  (Screening  to  Follow-up)  for  each  subject  was 
approximately 15 weeks. 
Number of subjects 
It was planned to randomise approximately 500 subjects to double-blind medication to ensure at least 
425  subjects  completed  the  12-week  treatment  period.  A  total  of  733  subjects  were  screened  and, 
after screening and run-in failures, 519 subjects were randomised and received study treatment.

Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion 
Males  or  females,  ≥40  years  of  age  at  screening  with  an  established  clinical  history  of  COPD  in 
accordance  with  the  definition  by  the  American  Thoracic  Society/European  Respiratory  Society  were 
eligible  for  inclusion.  Subjects  were  current  or  previous  cigarette  smokers  with  a  history  of  cigarette 
smoking of ≥10 pack-years at Screening. Subjects were required to have a post-albuterol (salbutamol) 
FEV1/forced  vital  capacity  (FVC)  ratio  of  ≤0.70  and  a  post-albuterol  (salbutamol)  FEV1  of  ≤70%  of 
predicted  normal  values  at  Visit  1  (Screening)  calculated  using  National  Health  and  Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) III reference equations. 
Treatment administration 
At Visit 2 (Randomisation Visit), following the 2-week run-in period, eligible subjects were randomised 
(1:1)  to  1  of  the  following  2  possible  treatments,  administered  as  1  inhalation  each  morning  and 
evening  for  12  weeks:  -  FF/VI  inhalation  powder  100/25  mcg  OD;  -  FP/salmeterol  inhalation  powder 
250/50 mcg BID. 
Criteria for evaluation 
The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline trough in 24-hour weighted-mean serial FEV1 
at the end of 12 weeks of treatment on Treatment Day 84 (Visit 5). The secondary endpoint was time 
to onset (increase of 100 mL above baseline in FEV1) on Treatment Day 1 (Visit 2). 
Statistical methods 
A total of 212 evaluable subjects in each of the active treatment groups would provide 90% power to 
detect  a  difference  between  FF/VI  and  FP/salmeterol  of  60  mL  in  weighted-mean  FEV1  at  Week  12, 
assuming  a  standard  deviation  (SD)  of  190  mL  and  a  2-sided,  5%  significance  level.  Allowing  for  a 
15% withdrawal rate post-randomisation, 250 subjects were planned to be randomised to each active 
treatment  arm.  This  was  a  superiority  study.  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  change  from 
baseline trough in weighted-mean 24-hour serial FEV1 at Week 12 for the ITT Population. 
Efficacy 
The  current  study  showed  a  statistically  significant  improvement  for  the  primary  endpoint  of  change 
from baseline trough in 24-hour weighted-mean FEV1 on Treatment Day 84, between the FF/VI 100/25 
OD treatment group and the FP/salmeterol 250/50 BID treatment group. The least squares (LS) mean 
change from baseline trough in 24-hour weighted-mean FEV1 on Treatment Day 84 was 174 mL in the 
FF/VI  100/25  OD  treatment  group  and  94  mL  in  the  FP/salmeterol  250/50  BID  treatment  group  (LS 
mean difference: +80 mL; 95% CI: +37 to +124 ml; p <0.001). 
A statistically significant difference was found between the treatment groups for the secondary efficacy 
parameter of time to onset on Treatment Day 1 (p=0.012). The median time to onset was 15 and 30 
minutes  post-dose  for  the  FF/VI  100/25  OD  and  FP/salmeterol  250/50  BID  treatment  groups, 
respectively. The LS mean change from baseline trough in 24-hour weighted-mean FVC on Treatment 
Day 84 was 152 mL in the FF/VI 100/25 OD treatment group and 59 mL in the FP/salmeterol 250/50 
BID treatment group (p=0.003). At Week 12 (Treatment Day 84), mean changes from baseline in pre-
dose  IC  were  111  mL  and  66  mL  in  the  FF/VI  100/25  OD  and  FP/salmeterol  250/50  BID  treatment 
groups, respectively. There were no differences seen between the 2 treatment groups for supplemental 
use of albuterol (salbutamol) and supplemental albuterol (salbutamol) rescue-free days.

Study HZC112352 
Study  HZC112352  was  a  12-Week  multicentre  phase  III  study  to  Evaluate  the  24-Hour  Pulmonary 
Function  Profile  of  Fluticasone  Furoate  /Vilanterol  (FF/VI)  Inhalation  Powder  100/25mcg  Once  Daily 
Compared  with  Fluticasone  Propionate/Salmeterol  Inhalation  Powder  250/50mcg  Twice  Daily  in 
Subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  24  hour  spirometry  effect  (forced  expiratory 
volume  in  1  second  [FEV1])  of  FF/VI  100/25  mcg  once  daily  (OD)  compared  with  fluticasone 
propionate (FP)/salmeterol 250/50 mcg BID over a 12-week treatment period in subjects with COPD. 
Methodology, planned subjects, treatments and criteria for evaluation 
The  methodology,  planned  subjects,  treatments  and  criteria  for  evaluation  were  identical  to  the 
previous study HZC113109. 
Demographics 
A  total  of  511  subjects  completed  the  screening  and  run-in  periods  and  were  randomly  assigned  to 
treatment. 
Efficacy 
The  current  study  was  unable  to  demonstrate  a  statistically  significant  improvement  for  the  primary 
endpoint, change from baseline trough in 24-hour weighted mean FEV1 on Treatment Day 84, between 
the  FF/VI  100/25  OD  treatment  group  and  the  FP/salmeterol  250/50  BID  treatment  group  (LS  mean 
difference: 29 ml; 95%CI: -22 to 80 ml; p=0.267). 
No  statistical  differences  were  found  between  the  treatment  groups  for  the  secondary  efficacy 
parameter  of  time  to  onset  on  Treatment  Day  1.  There  were  no  differences  seen  between  the 
treatment  groups  for  supplemental  salbutamol  use,  inspiratory  capacity  (IC),  serial  forced  vital 
capacity (FVC) and weight mean FVC. 
Safety 
Safety assessments in the current study confirmed and extended the findings of previous studies, and 
provided  further  evidence  that  the  FF/VI  combination  is  generally  well  tolerated.  The  incidence  of 
pneumonia  was  low  in  the  study:  2  subjects  [<1%]  in  the  FF/VI  100/25  OD  group  and  0  subjects  in 
the  FP/salmeterol  250/50 BID  group).  There  were  11  and  4  subjects  with  COPD  exacerbations  in  the 
FF/VI 100/25 OD and FP/salmeterol 250/50 BID groups, respectively. All COPD exacerbations in both 
treatment groups resolved. There were  no fatalities related to COPD exacerbations. Three subjects in 
the  FF/VI  100/25  OD  treatment  group  and  no  subjects  in  the  FP/salmeterol  250/50  BID  treatment 
group were hospitalised as a result of an exacerbation during the study.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Asthma indication 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Three  pivotal  studies  (studies  HZA106827,  HZA106829  and  HZA106837)  were  submitted  with  this 
application to compare the effect of the new FF/VI FDC versus FF as monotherapy, FP as monotherapy 
or versus placebo. Two studies (studies HZA 106827 and HZA106837) were performed with the lower 
dose  FF/VI  100/25  μg  and  one  study  (study  HZA106829)  was  performed  with  the  higher  dose  FF/VI 
200/25  μg.  The  design  of  these  studies  (randomised,  blinded,  placebo  or  active  controlled)  was 
considered adequate by the CHMP to support the efficacy of the new FDC FF/VI.  
The design of these studies is similar. Patients were randomised after a run-in period in which patients 
were treated only with an ICS.  
With  regard  to  the  patient  population  included  in  these  studies,  it  seems  that  more  severe  patients 
were  included  in  the  study  with  the  higher  FDC  strength  but  minimal  differences  in  lung  function  at 
baseline  (FEV1%  predicted)  compared to the  study  in  less  severe  patients  and  low  dose of  the  FF/VI 
FDC.  Although  in  study  HZA106837  patients  were  required  to  be  symptomatic  and  patients  carried  a 
daily  diary,  the  data  were  not  captured  in  the  database  and  therefore  it  was  impossible  to  know  the 
baseline  status  regarding  symptoms  free  and  rescue  free  days  in  that  population.  Additional  data 
provided  by  the  Applicant  during  the  evaluation  for  studies  HZA106827  and  HZA106829  show  that 
patients  were  uncontrolled  at  baseline.  In  addition,  there  were  very  few  “symptoms  free  24  h”  and 
“rescue free 24 h” periods at baseline in all treatment groups. This is in line with the requirements of 
the  Note  for  Guidance  on  Clinical  Investigation  of  Medicinal  Products  for  Treatment  of  Asthma 
(CPMP/EWP/2922/01). 
Treatment  arm  comparators  were  placebo,  FF  100  mcg  OD,  FF  200  mcg  and  FP  500  mcg  BD.  The 
inclusion  of  a  placebo  arm  was  to  ensure  assay  sensitivity.  The  comparison  with  FP  500  mcg  BD  is 
considered  important  as  FF  is  not  currently  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  asthma  as 
monocomponent. The dose of FP is the highest dose currently approved for the treatment of asthma. 
The  duration  of  treatment  was  12  weeks  for  the  placebo  controlled  study,  24  weeks  for  the  active 
controlled  study  and  24  to  76  weeks  for  the  exacerbations  study.  These  study  duration  were 
considered in line with the current regulatory guidelines and acceptable by the CHMP.  
The two co-primary efficacy endpoints selected (trough FEV1 and weighted mean FEV1) are recognised 
as  parameters  to  assess  lung  function  in  scientific  guidelines.  Other  clinical  endpoints  such  as 
symptoms  free  or  rescue  free  24  h  were  included  as  secondary  endpoints.  These  endpoints  provide 
evidence  on  whether  the  FDC  is  able  to  maintain  asthma  control.  Furthermore  exacerbation  is 
considered  an  important  and  valuable  endpoint  to  assess  asthma  control  and  a  specific  study  (study 
HZA106837) to evaluate this endpoint was conducted.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Contradictory  results  were  obtained  for  the  two  dose  strengths.  In  the  case  of  the  low  dose  (FF/VI 
100/25  μg)  study  HZA106827  failed  to  demonstrate  a  statistical  and  clinically  relevant  differences 
between  FF/VI  100/25  mcg  and  placebo  and  between  FF/VI  100/25  mcg  and  FF  100  μg  in  both  co-
primary endpoints. As the Applicant proposed a hierarchical approach for the analysis, the analysis of 
all secondary variables should be considered as descriptive only. However the improvement in rescue 
free and symptom free 24 h was minimal for the FDC FF/VI 100/25 μg compared to placebo and to FF 
100  μg.  For  the  high  dose  (FF/VI  200/25  mcg)  a  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  FF/VI 
200/25 μg and the active comparator FP 1000 μg or FF 200 μg in though FEV1 was observed in study 
HZA106829 but not as high as expected. The Applicant argued that one possible explanation is that the 
effect  of  the  LABA  may  have  not  been  fully  maintained  throughout  the  24  hours.  This  is  not 
unexpected because it is known that the half life of vilanterol was of only 2.5 hours.  
A reduction in the number of severe exacerbations is considered a clinically relevant result in terms of 
control of asthma. However, in the study of exacerbations the reduction was of 20% for FF/VI 100/25 
vs FF100 that corresponds to an absolute reduction of 3.1%. Although the study was not powered to 
detect differences in trough FEV1 between treatments it did not reach 100 ml and the clinical relevance 
of these effects was questioned. The reliability of the results is also of concern as the comparator used 
in the study (FF) is not available as monocomponent.  
As the effect on asthma exacerbations in study HZA106837 in absolute terms is limited, the Applicant 
was requested by the CHMP during the evaluation to justify the clinical relevance of the observed effect 
taking into account that the comparator used in the study (FF) is neither marketed nor applied for.  
The  Applicant  acknowledged  that  interpreting  the  clinical  significance  of  exacerbation  reductions  in 
study  HZA106837  is  difficult  as  there  was  no  standard  of  care  comparator  group.  According  to  the 
Applicant,  the  exacerbation  rate  observed  in  the  FF  100  group  (0.19)  compares  favourably  with 
exacerbation  rates  reported  in  previous  studies published  in  the  literature  of  patients  uncontrolled  on 
medium  dose  ICS,  in  which  annualised  rates  ranging  from  0.31  to  0.35  were  reported  for  patients 
receiving  budesonide  alone  (Peters,  2008;  Scicchitano,  2004;  O’Byrne,  2004).  In  two  recent  studies 
which  assessed  the  effect  of  adding  salmeterol  to  FP  on  asthma  exacerbation  rates  (Kerwin,  2011; 
Katial, 2011), rates of 0.27 to 0.30 exacerbations/patient/year were reported for subjects receiving FP 
250 BD monotherapy.  
Additionally,  time  to  first  “on  treatment”  asthma  exacerbation  was  assessed  in  an  integration  of  11 
studies.  The  adjusted  probability  of  a  patient  reporting  at  least  one  severe  asthma  exacerbation  by 
week 24 was 10.8 (95% CI 5.7, 15.7) on placebo, 4.0 (2.3, 5.7) on FF 100 and 4.8 (0.5, 8.9) on FP 
250  BD.  The  hazard  ratio  for  the  risk  of  experiencing  a  severe  asthma  exacerbation  for  FF  100  vs. 
placebo  was  0.358  (0,190,  0.675),  p=0.002,  representing  a  statistically  significant  64%  reduction  in 
the risk of experiencing a severe asthma exacerbation for subjects treated with FF 100 compared with 
Placebo.  In  the  Applicant’s  view,  these  data  support  the  efficacy  of  FF  100  monotherapy  in  reducing 
the  risk  of  severe  asthma  exacerbations  and  suggest  it  has  a  similar  treatment  effect  to  marketed 
corticosteroids. Similarly, a statistically significant 53% (p=0.021) reduction in the risk of experiencing 
a severe asthma exacerbation was seen for subjects treated with FF 200 compared with Placebo. 
According  to  the  Applicant,  the  exacerbation  rate  observed  in  the  FF/VI  group  (  0.14)  also  compares 
favourably  with  exacerbation  rates  reported  in  previous  studies  of  patients  uncontrolled  on  medium-
dose ICS, in which annualised rates of 0.17 to 0.19 were reported for formoterol/budesonide (Peters, 
2008;  Scicchitano,  2004;  O’Byrne,  2004).  In  two  recent  studies  which  assessed  the  effect  of  adding 
salmeterol  to  FP  on  asthma  exacerbation  rates  (Kerwin,  2011;  Katial,  2011),  rates  of  0.17  to  0.25 
were reported for subjects receiving FP/salmeterol 250/50 BD.

The probability of a patient experiencing a severe asthma exacerbation on FF 100 and on FF/VI 100/25 
was  the  primary  endpoint  in  study  HZA106837.  The  Adjusted  Probability  of  a  patient  having  one  or 
more Severe Asthma Exacerbations by 52 Weeks was 15.9 % on FF 100 and 12.8% on FF/VI 100/25. 
The  Applicant  acknowledges  that  the  absolute  reduction  was  only  3.1%,  however  this  represents  a 
20% reduction in the risk of experiencing a severe asthma exacerbation for subjects treated with FF/VI 
100/25  compared  with  FF  100  (p=0.036).  Additionally  the  ratio  of  the  exacerbation  rate  for  FF/VI 
versus  FF  100  was  0.755  (p=0.014  95%  CI  0.603,  0.945)  which  represents  a  25%  reduction  in  the 
rate of severe asthma exacerbations. 
The  Applicant  however  argued  that  cross-study  comparison  of  the  FF/VI  exacerbation  data  with 
individual published studies conducted prior to 2009 is considered problematic since a more stringent 
definition  of  severe  exacerbation  was  used  (Redell,  2009).  In  study  HZA106837  a  severe  asthma 
exacerbation  was  defined  as  requiring  “Use  of  systemic  corticosteroids  for  at  least  3  days  or  a 
hospitalisation  or  ER  visit  because  of  asthma  requiring  systemic  corticosteroids”  (ATS/ERS  taskforce; 
Redell,  2009).  In  contrast,  older  studies  (O’Byrne,  2004;  Scicchitano,  2004)  defined  asthma 
exacerbation by requirement for oral steroids or reduction in PEF. A reduction in PEF correlates poorly 
with  clinical  prescription  of  corticosteroids  (Redell,  2009).  Exacerbations  defined  by  PEF  reduction 
would be more responsive to a LABA thereby inflating the apparent benefit of ICS/LABA compared with 
ICS alone. Additionally the O’Byrne 2004 and Scicchitano 2004 studies used budesonide/formoterol as 
a controller and as relief inhaler (instead of using SABA) in contrast to the fixed regimen used in the 
FF/VI programme. This would also tend to show a bigger treatment effect as compared with the FF/VI 
data. 
The Applicant provided during the evaluation a Cochrane review of the incremental benefit of adding a 
LABA to an ICS to reinforce that, the effect of FF/VI 100/25 on asthma exacerbation is similar to other 
LABA/ICS.  
Furthermore  the  Applicant  was  requested  by  the  CHMP  to  demonstrate  consistency  of  the  observed 
effect  by  performing  different  sensitivity  analyses.  The  Applicant  submitted  during  the  evaluation  a 
number  of  sensitivity  analyses,  all  of  which  support  the  primary  analysis  of  time  to  first  severe 
exacerbation.  
In  study  HZA106837  where  the  low  dose  of  FF/VI  (100/25)  was  studied,  the  risk  of  experiencing  a 
severe  asthma  exacerbation  was  decreased  by  20%  compared  with  FF  100  alone  (hazard  ratio  = 
0.795, p = 0.036 95% CI (0.642; 0.985) and the rate of severe asthma exacerbations was decreased 
by  25%  compared  with  FF  100  alone  (P  =  0.014).  Although  these  reductions  in  absolute  terms  are 
small they were considered clinically relevant by the CHMP.

The Applicant was also requested by the CHMP to provide any available direct or indirect comparison in 
terms  of  exacerbations,  symptoms  score  and  FEV1  of  the  FDC  FF/VI  versus  marketed  products. 
According  to  the  Applicant  the  most  compelling  comparison  is  a  direct  comparison  of  FF/VI  to  a 
marketed  ICS/LABA  combination  product.  Data  are  available  for  FF/VI  100/25  versus  FP/salmeterol 
250/50  BD  in  a  6  month  parallel  group  study,  study  HZA113091,  which  randomised  806  patients 
uncontrolled on mid dose ICS. The primary endpoint was 0- 24 hour weighted mean FEV1 at the end of 
the  24  week  treatment  period.  Both  treatments  resulted  in  an  improvement  in  lung  function  from 
baseline over 24 h, with a LS mean increase from baseline in weighted mean FEV1 of 341 mL for the 
FF/VI group and 377 mL for the FP/salmeterol group. The adjusted mean treatment difference of -37 
mL  between  the  groups  was  not  statistically  significant  (p=0.162).  Trough  FEV1  was  measured  as  a 
secondary  endpoint  at  24  hours  after  the  last  dose  of  FF/VI  and  12  hours  after  the  last  dose  of 
FP/salmeterol. Subjects in the FP/salmeterol group achieved a LS mean change from baseline in trough 
FEV1 of 300 mL and subjects in the FF/VI group 281 mL, the difference in adjusted mean of 19 mL was 
not statistically significant (p=0.485). 
The  incidence  of  asthma  exacerbations  was  low  and  similar  across  the  treatment  groups,  with  the 
highest  percentage  of  on-treatment  events  in  the  FP/salmeterol  group  (12  subjects,  3%)  compared 
with  the  FF/VI  group  (10  subjects,  2%).  One  subject  in  the  FF/VI  group  vs.  2  subjects  in  the 
FP/salmeterol group were hospitalised due to their asthma exacerbations. 
Overall,  data  from  the  head  to  head  study  of  FF/VI  100/25  OD  versus  FP/salmeterol  250/50  BD 
showed no significant differences in improvement in FEV1,  whether assessed by 0-24 hour FEV1 AUC 
or trough FEV1. In the Applicant’s opinion, the number of asthma exacerbations was similar in the two 
treatment  groups  and  there  was  no  significant  difference  overall  in  improvements  in  quality  of  life  or 
control  assessments  by  ACT.  However,  in  a  post-hoc  analysis,  significantly  more  patients  on  FF/VI 
were  responders  in  terms  of  improvement  in  asthma  related  quality  of  life  as  determined  by 
percentage  of  patients  who  had  an  improvement  of  at  least  0.5  (the  MCID)  in  their  AQLQ  score. 
According  to  the  Applicant,  these  data  demonstrate  that  the  efficacy  of  FF/VI  is  comparable  to  the 
currently marketed FP/salmeterol combination product. 
The  Applicant  provided  further  data  from  indirect  comparisons.  The  FP/salmeterol  studies  included  in 
the  original  phase  III  registration  studies  (Kavuru,  2000;  Aubier,  1999;  Shapiro,  2000)  submitted 
which  included  a  comparison  of  FP/salmeterol  vs.  FP,  results  of  two  strata  from  the  GOAL  study 
(Bateman  2004)  (corresponding  to  the  strata  that  recruited patients  uncontrolled  on low or  mid dose 
ICS and therefore, a similar population to that recruited to the FF/VI clinical programme) and results of 
two recent 12 month studies comparing FP/salmeterol and FP (Kerwin, 2011; Kaital, 2011).

The improvements in lung function resulting from treatment with FF/VI , both in terms of change from 
baseline  and  of  the  incremental  benefit  of  adding  VI  to  FF  alone  are  within  the  same  range  as  those 
observed  with  FP/salmeterol  compared  to  FP  and  budesonide/formoterol  compared  to  budesonide 
alone. When adding salmeterol to FP the improvement in trough FEV1 ranged from 40 mL to 230 mL 
with the most recent 12 month studies (Kaitel, 2011 and Kerwin, 2011) showing only an incremental 
benefit of 110 mL and 40 mL, respectively. In the Applicant’s view, the 83 to 95mL incremental benefit 
in  FEV1  demonstrated  in  study  HZA106837  is  similar  to  the  benefit  of  adding  salmeterol  to  FP  in  a 
recent 12 month asthma study. 
Additionally  the  incremental  benefit  of  VI  over  FF  alone  in  improving  symptom  free  days  was  12.1% 
(6.2,18.1;p<0.001) for FF/VI 100/25 vs. FF100 in study HZA106827 and in study HZA106829 was 8.4 
(2.0,14.8, p=0.010 ) for FF/VI 200/25 vs. FF200 and 4.9 (-1.6,11.3,p=0.137) for FF/VI 200/25 vs. FP 
500BD.  From  the  Applicant’s  point  of  view  these  improvements  are  similar  to  the  range  of 
improvements 
in  symptom 
free  days  seen  with  FP/salmeterol 
(8-15%)  vs.  FP  and 
budesonide/formoterol  vs.  budesonide  (7-14%).  Thus  across  a  number  of  endpoints,  the 
improvements  seen  on  addition  of  VI  to  FF  are  generally  similar  to  the  benefits  seen  on  adding 
salmeterol to FP and formoterol to budesonide.  
The Applicant submitted the results of study HZA113091 during the evaluation, a superiority study of 
FF/VI  100/25  OD  vs  FP/salmeterol  250/50  with  duration  of  24  weeks.  The  study  failed  to  show 
superiority  of  FF/VI  in  lung  function  parameters  versus  FP/salmeterol.  But  an  important  issue  is  that 
the  study  was  not  designed  to  assess  properly  asthma  exacerbations.  Neither  the  sample  size,  which 
was  planned  for  a  lung  parameter,  nor  the  length  of  the  study  allows  an  accuracy  evaluation  of 
exacerbation in this direct comparison. 
The  applicant  argued  that  the  modest  improvement  of  FF/VI  100/25  compared  with  FF100  in  lung 
function  parameters  (83-95  ml  improvement in  FEV1  in  the  evening)  compared  with  a  more  relevant 
improvement  in  other  studies  in  asthma  may  be  due  to  a  different  timing  of  the  assessment  of  lung 
function, which was conducted in the evening in studies with FF/VI and in the morning in other studies 
with LABA/ICS. This explanation can neither be confirmed nor ruled out. Moreover, the Applicant states 
that  an  83-95  ml  improvement  in  the  evening  is  clinically  relevant  but  this  statement  was  not 
supported by references.  
As  in  the  indirect  comparisons  provided  by  the  Applicant  similar  improvements  in  lung  function 
parameters  (FEV1,  exacerbation  rates,  recsue  free  days)  were  observed  with  FF/VI  versus  FF  alone 
and  with  FP/salmeterol  versus  FP  alone  or  budesonide/salmeterol  versus  budesonide  alone  the  CHMP 
concluded that the magnitude of effects on lung function of FF/VI versus FF alone can be considered as 
clinically relevant.  
Based  on  the  results  of  study  HZA106827  (no  benefit  observed  in  terms  of  lung  function  parameters 
and the effects in terms of asthma control (rescue-free days, symptoms free day and exacerbations)), 
the  Applicant  was  requested  to  justify  the  pertinence  of  the  marketing  authorisation  of  the  low  dose 
FF/VI 100/25.

According  to  the  Applicant,  in  study  HZA106827,  although  FF/VI  100/25  and  FF100  were  both 
significantly superior to placebo in improving the co-primary endpoints of trough FEV1 and 0-24 hour 
weighted  mean  FEV1,  the  difference  between  FF/VI  and  FF  was  not  significant  for  either  endpoint. 
Although  in  this  particular  study  the  benefit  of  adding  VI  was  not  seen  for  FEV1,  clinically  relevant 
differences were observed for both AM and PM PEF; treatment differences between FF/VI 100/25 and 
FF 100 were 14.6 L/min (95% CI: 7.9, 21.3) and 12.3 L/min (95% CI: 5.8, 18.8), respectively. PEF is 
a reliable and valid measure of lung function; improvements of 12 to 15 L/min have historically been 
regarded  as  clinically  relevant  and  the  benefit  of  the  addition  of  VI  to  FF  was  within  this  range. 
According  to  the  Applicant,  the  reason  for  the  inconsistency  between  FEV1  and  PEF  is  unknown, 
especially  considering  clinically  relevant  improvements  in  FEV1  were  observed  in  a  more  severe 
population in study HZA106829 (although FF/VI 200/25 was used in this study  both studies assessed 
the incremental efficacy of adding the same dose of VI to FF).  
In  an  attempt  to  understand  if  a  ceiling  effect  may  have  contributed  to  why  FF/VI  100/25  was  not 
shown  to  be  significantly  superior  to  FF100  for  trough  FEV1  in  sudy  HZA106827,  the  Applicant 
conducted a post hoc analysis to look at trough FEV1 (L) at Week 12 relative to post-salbutamol FEV1 
at Screening (i.e. to assess how near personal best the patient’s FEV1 was at the end of the treatment 
period). Post salbutamol FEV1 at screening was taken as the patient’s personal best. In the FF group, 
the  median  FEV1  reached  at  the  end  of  treatment  was  92.5%  of  their  post  salbutamol  FEV1  at 
screening and consequently there was only a limited margin to demonstrate any further improvement 
with  the  addition  of  VI.  In  the  FF/VI  group  the  median  FEV1  was  96%  suggesting  that  the  lack  of 
benefit  of  FF/VI  over  FF  may  have  been  as  a  result  of  the  patients  achieving  near  maximal 
bronchodilation with FF alone. 
Although  statistically  significant  improvements  in  FEV1  were  not  demonstrated  in  study  HZA106827 
versus  FF  100,  treatment  with  FF/VI  100/25  showed  greater  improvements  in  rescue  and  symptom-
free 24-hour periods compared with FF 100, with changes of 10.6% (p<0.001) and 12.1% (p<0.001), 
respectively,  suggesting,  in  the  Applicant’s  view,  a  contribution  from  the  VI  component  on  these 
symptomatic  endpoints.  Also,  the  incremental  improvement  on  symptom-  and  rescue-free  24-hour 
periods  is  similar  to  the  incremental  benefit  of  FP/salmeterol  over  FP  on  symptom  and  rescue  free 
days. 
Furthermore,  at  Week  12,  more  subjects  were  controlled  (with  an  ACT  score  of  20  or  more,  Schatz 
2006) in the FF/VI group (61%) than in the FF group (54%). The Applicant states that although study 
HZA106827  was  a  failed  study  as  it  did  not  show  statistically  significant  differences  between  FF/VI 
100/25 and FF 100 for the primary endpoints of trough and 0-24 hour weighted mean FEV1, clinically 
relevant  benefits  of  the  combination  over  FF  monotherapy  were  seen  for  symptomatic  endpoints  and 
lung function as determined by AM and PM PEF. Additionally, it should be noted that in an integrated 
analysis of studies FFA112059, HZA106827 and HZA106837, a 77ml improvement in trough FEV1withf 
FF/VI 100/25 over FF 100 was shown at 12 weeks, which was statistically significant (p<0.001).

For  the  low  dose  of  FF/VI  (100/25  µg)  statistically  significant  differences  in  the  two  co-primary 
endpoints  change  from  baseline  in  trough  FEV1  and  mean  FEV1  at  week  12  versus  placebo  were 
observed  in  study  HZA106827.  In  addition  statistically  significant  differences  in  secondary  efficacy 
endpoints (rescue free and symptoms free 24h periods) versus placebo were also observed. Although 
the  results  failed  to  show  statistically  significant  differences  between  FF/VI  and  FF  monotherapy  on 
relevant lung function parameters and small but clinically relevant effects of the FF/VI on symptomatic 
endpoints versus FF monotherapy were observed, the CHMP considered that the efficacy of the FF/VI 
100/25  dose  in  asthma  is  well  supported.  Furthermore,  the  effects  observed  with  FF/VI  100/25  dose 
are similar to the one obtained with other LABA/ICS combinations.  
The Applicant was requested during the evaluation to justify the clinically relevance of the differences 
reported in the study HZA106829 for the lung function parameters and the effect in terms of asthma 
control (0.4/7 additional rescue-free days per week vs a marketed inhaled corticosteroid as FP given in 
monotherapy). 
In  study  HZA106829,  FF/VI  200/25  was  compared  with  both  FF  200  and  FP  500  BD.  Statistically 
significant  improvements  for  FF/VI  over  both  FF  200  and  FP  500  BD  were  seen  for  the  co-primary 
endpoints  of  trough  FEV1  and  weighted  mean  FEV1.  The  study  was  powered  to  show  a  difference  of 
150 mL in trough FEV1 of FF/VI over ICS alone and a difference of 175 mL for weighted mean FEV1. 
Treatment  differences  in  excess  of  150  mL  were  seen  for  both  FF/VI  vs.  FF  200  and  for  FF/VI  vs.  FP 
500 BD for trough FEV1.  However, for weighted mean FEV1, while the treatment difference for FF/VI 
vs. FP 500 BD exceeded 175 mL, the difference between FF/VI and FF 200 was 136 mL.  
Weighted mean FEV1 was powered for a greater difference between treatments as a rapid increase in 
FEV1  was  expected  when  taking  FF/VI  due  to  the  effect  of  the  LABA  which  may  not  have  been  fully 
maintained throughout the 24 hours. However with FF/VI, lung function remains very stable over a 24 
hour  period  with  little  evidence  of  diurnal  variation.  A  minimally  important  difference  for  treatment 
differences  in  weighted  mean  FEV1  has  not  been  determined;  however,  given  the  benefit  of  FF/VI 
200/25  over  FF  200  and  FP  500  BD  seen  in  all  measures  of  lung  function,  including  trough  FEV1, 
weighted mean FEV1 and AM and PM PEF, the Applicant believes that the incremental benefit of adding 
VI  to  ICS  alone  (either  FF  200  or  FP  500  BD)  is  both  statistically  and  clinically  relevant,  in  the 
Applicant’s opinion. 
Although a statistically significant benefit of FF/VI 200/25 compared with FF 200 was seen for rescue-
free  24-hour  periods,  the  difference  between  FF/VI  200/25  and  FP  500  BD  was  not  statistically 
significant. Indeed, the incremental benefit of 6.3% (corresponding to 0.4 additional rescue-free days 
per week) versus FP 500 BD given as monotherapy is of marginal clinical relevance, according to the 
Applicant.  However  it  is  important  to  look  across  all  endpoints  in  determining  the  benefit  of  one 
treatment over another. FF/VI 200/25 led to clinically relevant improvements over FP 500 BD for FEV1 
both  trough  and  0-24  hour  weighted  mean  as  well  as  AM  and  PM  PEF  (Figure  3).  Additionally, 
significantly  more  patients  were  withdrawn  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  in  the  FP  group  than  in  the  FF/VI 
200/25 group.

The  values  observed  for  weighted  mean  FEV1  of  FF/VI  200/25  versus  FF  200,  although  significant, 
were not as higher as expected. The Applicant argued that one possible explanation is that the effect of 
the LABA may have not been fully maintained throughout the 24 hours. This is not unexpected because 
it is known that the plasma elimination half life of vilanterol was on average of only 2.5 hours.  
According to the Applicant the effect of FF/VI dosed once daily was evenly sustained over the 24-hour 
dosing interval confirming that once daily dosing is appropriate. This is entirely expected given the long 
lung residence time of VI and its ability to persist in the tissue and freely associate with and dissociate 
from the beta2-receptor (‘reassertion’). Consequently the 24 hour duration of action of VI is related to 
its  topical  activity  in  the  lung  and  is  not  a  function  of  the  apparent  systemic  half-life  (2.5  hours); 
indeed  it  was  a  specific  design  feature  of  VI  that  it  would  be  rapidly  metabolised  to  reduce  systemic 
effects. 
For the high dose of FF/VI (200/25) statistically significant differences in the two co-primary endpoints 
change  from  baseline  in  trough  FEV1  and  mean  FEV1  at  week  12  versus  FF  200  and  FP  1000  were 
obtained in study HZA106829. The differences achieved on lung function parameters were greated with 
the high dose than with the low dose. In addition, statistically significant differences in the secondary 
endpoint  rescue-free  24h  periods  versus  FF  200  were  also  observed.  The  CHMP  therefore  considered 
that  the  efficacy  of  the  FF/VI  200/25  dose  in  asthma  is  well  supported.  Furthermore,  the  effects 
observed  with  the  FF/VI  200/25  dose  are  similar  to  the  one  obtained  with  other  LABA/ICS 
combinations.  
The  number  of  patients  from  special  populations  (≥  12  years  and  ≥  65  years)  included  is  scarce  to 
obtain conclusive efficacy information. Moreover when patients below 18 years of age were analysed in 
study HZA106837 more patients in FF/VI treatment arm evidenced a severe exacerbation compares to 
FF treatment. 
A  binding  agreement  with  the  PDCO  was  to  recruit  a  minimum  of  12%  adolescents  into  studies 
HZA106827, HZA106829, HZA106837, HZA106839, FFA112059 and B2C112060. However, because of 
the  difficulty  in  finding  adolescents  uncontrolled  on  mid  dose  ICS/LABA  or  high  dose  ICS  for  study 
HZA106829, the target enrolment of adolescents in this study was modified to 4%. Study investigators 
were  unable  to  find  adequate  numbers  of  adolescent  subjects  treated  with  higher  dose  ICS  or  mid 
strength  ICS/LABA  for  screening.  Investigator  feedback  was  that  higher  dose  ICS  or  mid  strength 
ICS/LABA is not routinely used in the treatment of adolescent asthma. According to the Applicant, this 
is consistent with prescribing data which shows mid strength FP/salmeterol (250/50 mcg BD) was used 
to treat approximately 125,000 adolescents across the entire USA. As a consequence of this difficulty 
in  recruiting  adolescent  subjects  uncontrolled  on  high  dose  ICS  or  mid  dose  ICS/LABA  to  study 
HZA106829, the pivotal efficacy study for FF/VI 200/25 strength, the number of adolescents included 
for FF/VI 200/25 and FF 200 is low.

Although  elderly  patients  were  not  specifically  excluded  from  FF/VI  Phase  III  studies  in  asthma,  the 
number  of  subjects  recruited  over  65  years  of  age  is  low.  A  study  in  USA  by  Oraka  suggested  that 
asthma  prevalence  rates  decreased  with  the  advancement  of  age,  concurrent  with  an  increase  in  the 
prevalence  of  COPD  across  age  groups  (Oraka,  2012);  he  suggested  that  up  to  30%  of  asthma 
subjects  aged  65  or  greater  may  have  co-morbid  COPD.  As  the  studies  in  the  FF/VI  asthma  clinical 
development programme excluded those with co morbid COPD (so the effects of treatment in a ‘clean’ 
asthma population could be determined), may explain why only a limited number of patients over the 
age of 65 were enrolled into these studies.  
Although  the  number  of  adolescents  and  patients  aged  >65  years  was  too  small  to  allow  statistical 
analysis for most treatment groups, in an integrated analysis a benefit of FF/VI over placebo and over 
FF  alone  in  trough  FEV1  was  seen  in  both  age  groups  at  Week  2,  Week  12  and  Week  24,  further 
supporting the CHMP’s acceptance of clinical efficacy for the asthma indication.  
The indication applied for initially by the Applicant was considered broader by the CHMP than the data 
submitted  to  support  it  as  this  indication  represents  a  step-up  indication  in  patients  not  adequately 
controlled with an ICS alone and a substitution indication when a patient is already controlled with an 
ICS  plus  a  LABA.  This  second  part  of  the  indication  was  not  considered  supported  by  the  submitted 
data and importantly a formulation with FF as monocomponent is not available.  
According  to  the  Applicant,  FDC  of  an  ICS  and  a  LABA  are  recommended  for use  in  patients that  are 
uncontrolled on ICS (and ‘as needed’ SABA) or who are already taking an ICS and LABA. The approved 
indication  for  FP/salmeterol  specifies  this  latter  group  as  ‘patients  already  adequately  controlled  on 
both an inhaled corticosteroid and long acting beta-agonist’ since at the time it was registered it was 
foreseen  that  patients  could  ‘step  across’  from  concurrent  therapy  to  simplify  treatment.  Additionally 
GINA recommends that patients uncontrolled on low dose inhaled corticosteroids and long acting beta 
agonists  should  be  stepped  up  to  medium  or  high  dose  inhaled  corticosteroid plus  a  long  acting  beta 
agonist. 
Although  the  individual  components  for  FF/VI  are  not  currently  available,  patients  who  remain 
symptomatic  despite  existing  ICS/LABA  therapy  may  benefit  from  treatment  with  FF/VI.  In  addition 
patients who are already on twice daily ICS/LABA therapy but not satisfactorily controlled may benefit 
from the new FF/VI FDC. Therefore the Applicant believes that an asthma indication which represents a 
“step-up” indication in patients not adequately controlled with ICS and a “substitution indication” which 
covers patients uncontrolled with an ICS plus a LABA is appropriate.  
This  second  part  of  the  initially  claimed  indication  was  not  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP  as  no 
direct comparison between FF/VI and an approved FDC of an ICS and a LABA was submitted with this 
application.  As  a  consequence  the  Applicant  submitted  during  the  evaluation  a  revised  asthma 
indication including only the step-up part of the indication as follows: 
Relvar Ellipta is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 
years and older where use of a combination medicinal product (long-acting-beta 2-agonist and inhaled 
corticosteroid) is appropriate: 
• 
patients  not  adequately  controlled  with  inhaled  corticosteroids  and  as  “needed”  inhaled  short 
acting beta2-agonist.  
Which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

COPD indication 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Four  pivotal  studies  were  submitted  to  support  the  COPD  indication:  two  6-month  clinical  studies 
(studies  HZC112206  and  HZC112207)  and  two  1-year  clinical  studies  (studies  HZC102871  and 
HZC102970). These four studies were all well designed double-blind phase III multicenter studies and 
were well conducted. Their objective was respectively to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 
FF/VI  Inhalation  Powder  administered  OD  on  lung  function  (for  the  6-month  studies)  and/or 
exacerbations  (for  the  1-year  studies).  Inclusion  criteria  corresponded  to  patients  with  accepted 
spirometric  criteria  for  moderate-severe  COPD  (FEV1  /  FVC  ratio  (post-bronchodilator)  <  70%  and 
FEV1  (post-bronchodilator)  <  70%  of  predicted).  Six-month  studies  HZC112206  and  HZC112207 
assessed  the  efficacy  of  VI  25  as  monotherapy  and the  effect of  VI  25  when added to  FF  100.  Study 
HZC112206  also  assessed  the  effect  of  FF  50  and  FF  100  when  added  to  VI  25,  whereas  study 
HZC112207  assessed  the  effect  of  FF  100  and  FF  200  when  added  to  VI  25  and  the  effect  of  VI  25 
when  added  to  FF  200.  One-year  studies  HZC102970  and  HZC102871  evaluated  three  dosage 
strengths of FF/VI Inhalation Powder (50/25, 100/25 and 200/25 μg OD) versus VI Inhalation Powder 
25  μg  OD  in  subjects  with  COPD.  In  the  6-month  studies,  a  100  mL  difference  was  considered 
appropriate for comparisons of VI versus placebo and FF/VI versus placebo for both trough FEV1 and 
WM  0-4  hrs  FEV1  and  of  FF/VI  versus  FF  for  WM  0-4  hrs  FEV1,  while  in  the  1-year  studies,  a  25% 
relative  reduction  in  the  annual  rate  of  moderate  and  severe  exacerbations  in  a  FF/VI  arm  compared 
with a VI-alone arm was considered appropriate. In the 6-month studies, the co-primary endpoints of 
WM 0-4hrs post-dose FEV1 on Day 168 and the change from baseline in trough FEV1 on Day 169 were 
analysed  using  a  repeated  measures  model.  The  primary  analysis  was  performed  using  Mixed  Model 
Repeated  Measures  analysis  (MMRM)  with  covariates  of  study,  baseline  FEV1,  smoking  status 
(stratum),  Day,  geographical  region,  treatment,  Day  by  baseline  interaction  and  Day  by  treatment 
interaction.  In  the  1-year  pivotal  studies,  the  primary  endpoint  of  the  annual  rate  of  moderate  and 
severe exacerbations was analysed using a generalized linear model, assuming the Negative Binomial 
distribution.  A  supportive  analysis  was  also  performed  whereby  the  number  of  moderate/severe 
exacerbations  were  analysed  using  a  Poisson  regression  model.  In  all  pivotal  studies,  subjects  were 
assigned to study treatment in accordance with the central randomization schedule.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
6-month studies HZC112206 and HZC112207 
In the 6-month studies HZC112206 and HZC112207, the FF/VI (50/25, 100/25 and 200/25) and VI 25 
treatment groups showed clinically meaningful improvements in weighted mean FEV1 0-4 hours post-
dose (co-primary endpoint) compared with the placebo group. However, with respect to the other co-
primary endpoint (trough FEV1), the difference between VI 25 and placebo in pooled 6-month studies 
(67  to  100  ml  in  studies  HZC112206  and  HCZ112207,  respectively)  was  below  the  minimal  clinically 
relevant difference in COPD trials (100 to 140 ml).

The small differences in trough FEV1 observed between FF/VI and VI may reflect the small contribution 
of  corticosteroids  in  lung  function  on  top  of  a  LABA.  These  results  are  not  too  dissimilar  to  what  has 
been  reported  with  other  inhaled  corticosteroids  (ICS)  in  similar  COPD  patient  populations 
[Sharafkhaneh,  2012;  Ferguson,  2008].  There  was  a  lack  of  clinically  relevant  effect  of  FF/VI  100/25 
versus placebo in the secondary endpoint mean CRQ-SAS Dyspnoea Domain scores (MCID, >0.5 point 
improvement)  in  both  6-month  lung  function  studies  (studies  HZC112206  and  HZC112207),  which  is 
against  a  symptomatic  benefit  of  the  FDC  in  patients  with  COPD.  However,  a  responder  analysis  for 
CRQ-SAS  Dyspnea  scores  showed  that  the  odds  of  being  a  responder  was  between  1.67  and  2.03 
times greater with FF/VI than with placebo. In addition, there were modest improvements between the 
FF/VI  100/25  group  and  the  placebo  group  for  the  secondary  endpoints  of  COPD  symptoms  and  the 
number  of  night-time  awakenings  requiring  salbutamol,  over  the  6-month  treatment  period,  while  a 
post-hoc analysis of total rescue-free days showed that FF/VI 100/25 provided a higher percentage of 
salbutamol-free  days  (19%  difference  versus  placebo  in  HZC112206  and  14%  difference  versus 
placebo in study HZC112207).  
1-year studies HZC102871 and HCZ102970 
In  study  HZC102970,  treatment  with  FF/VI  at  all  strengths  provided  a  statistically  significant 
improvement  in  the  primary  endpoint  LS  mean  annual  rate  of  moderate  and  severe  exacerbations 
compared with VI 25 treatment. There was a lack of dose-response in annual rate of moderate/severe 
exacerbations  in  the  two 1-year  pivotal  studies,  with  a  differential  effect  of  the  FF/VI  200/25  dose  in 
each  of  the  studies.  The  results  for  the  secondary  endpoint  time  to  first  exacerbation  and  moderate 
exacerbations requiring treatment with oral/systemic corticosteroids were consistent with those of the 
main exacerbation outcome. In study HZC102871, improvements ranged from 41-64 mL in the FF/VI 
groups  compared  with  the  VI  25  group  (p≤0.011).  In  study  HZC102970,  numerical  improvements  in 
LS mean trough FEV1 at  Week 52 were observed for the FF/VI 100/25 and  200/25 groups compared 
with the VI 25 group, 24 mL and 26 mL, respectively, which were not statistically significant.  
During  the  evaluation  the  Applicant  was  requested  by  the  CHMP  to  comment  on  the  active  control 
group  chosen  in  the  6-month  and  1-year  studies  (VI  25)  which  does  not  correspond  to  a  LABA 
authorised for use in patients with COPD, and the VI dosing chosen (25 mcg once daily) which seems 
suboptimal in order to establish the place of this FDC in the treatment of COPD. 
In  undertaking  dose-ranging  for  VI  in  COPD,  the  Applicant  aimed  to identify  and  select  a dose  at  the 
inflection  of  the  steep  part  of  the  FEV1  dose  response  curve,  which  also  had  an  acceptable  safety 
profile. However, no attempt was made to select a VI dose that was superior to a currently marketed 
product.  The  selection  of  VI  25  from  the  dose-ranging  study  (study  B2C111045)  incorporated  the 
above  mentioned  principles  and  the  proposed  minimum  clinically  important  difference  (MCID)  of  100 
mL  (Donohue,  2004;  Cazzola,  2008).  Recognizing  that  baseline  reversibility  to  salbutamol  can 
influence selection of the MCID, VI 25 was also the minimal dose that exceeded the 100 mL threshold 
for  trough  FEV1  in  the  non-reversible  population.  In  the  non-reversible  population,  no  additional 
benefit  was  derived  from  the  50  µg  dose.  The  CHMP  accepted  the  applicant’s  conclusion  that 
improvements  observed  following  treatment  with  vilanterol  are  broadly  consistent  to  those  observed 
with  other  approved  long-acting  beta-agonists.  In  clinical  studies  there  is  evidence  that  a  100  ml 
improvement in FEV1 was not always achieved following treatment with formoterol and salmeterol. In 
two  6-month  studies  of  salmeterol  (50  µg  bd)  in  COPD  patients,  the  change  from  baseline  in  trough 
FEV1  compared  with  placebo  was  92  mL  (Hanania  2003,  Mahler  2002).  In  the  12  month  TRISTAN 
study  (SFCB3024),  which  was  pivotal  for  registration  of  FP/salmeterol  500/50  µg  bd  in  COPD 
(Calverley  2003)  the  adjusted  treatment  difference  over  52  weeks  between  salmeterol  and  placebo 
was 60 mL (95% CI 32, 88). In addition, in a 6-month study with formoterol 9 µg bd (Tashkin, 2008), 
the change from baseline in trough FEV1 relative to placebo was just 40 mL (95% CI 0, 70; p<0.05).

Thus,  excluding  indacaterol,  currently  approved  LABAs  have  not  consistently  attained  the  putative 
MCID of 100 mL in COPD patients. 
As  noted  above,  the  degree  of  reversibility  can  impact  the  ability  to  achieve  the  MCID.  In  the 
aforementioned  6  month  salmeterol  studies  (Hanania,  2003;  Mahler  2002),  the  reversibility  to 
salbutamol  in  subjects  randomised  to  salmeterol  was  21.3%  and  21.2%,  respectively,  with  55%  and 
51%  of  subjects  having  met  the  definition  of  reversible  (i.e.  ≥  12%  and  200  mL  increase  in  FEV1 
following salbutamol 400 µg) in the two trials, respectively. In contrast, the percentage of reversibility 
of  subjects  randomised  to  VI  25  µg  in  studies  HZC112206  and  HZC112207  was  14.6%  and  12.7%, 
respectively, with 31% and 30% of VI 25 subjects meeting the reversibility criteria. 
The  efficacy  of  once  daily  vs  twice  daily  dosing  of  VI  was  compared  in  subjects  with  asthma  (study 
HZA113310).  Subjects  with  COPD  are  less  sensitive  to  beta-agonists  (i.e.  VI  produces  less 
bronchodilation than in subjects with asthma) therefore conducting the study in subjects with asthma 
enabled a greater discrimination between once and twice daily dosing regimens. Subjects received VI 
6.25  µg  bd  and  12.5  µg  OD  to  ensure  that  the  comparison  was  not  made  on  the  upper  part  of  the 
efficacy  dose-response  curve  where  treatment  differences  would  be  more  difficult  to  detect.  The 
weighted  mean  FEV1  (0-24  h;  Day  7)  difference  from  placebo  was  almost  identical  for  the  two 
regimens (166 and 168 mL, respectively) indicating that the efficacy of VI was no greater if the once 
daily  dose  was  divided  and  administered  twice  daily.  Weighted  mean  FEV1  was  considered  a  better 
measure than trough FEV1 to compare efficacy over 24 hours as comparison of a single time point (i.e. 
at  trough)  could  give  an  unfair  advantage  to  one  regimen  over  another  depending  on  the  time-point 
selected. The CHMP accepted the Applicant’s conclusion, despite the Guideline on clinical investigation 
of medicinal products in the treatment of COPD (EMA/CHMP/483572/2012 -corr1) clearly states that “If 
FEV1  is  the  primary  endpoint,  the  pre-bronchodilator  (trough)  FEV1  is  the  preferred  measure  in  the 
development of a new product for maintenance treatment”.  
Regarding  the effect  of  VI  25  on  exacerbation  rates,  the  Applicant  argued that  comparing  the  two 1-
year  studies  (HZC102970/HZC102871)  with  TORCH  is  not  appropriate  due  to  differences  in  study 
populations; HZC102970/HZC102871 were conducted in subjects with a history of an exacerbation in 
the year prior to screening whereas subjects in TORCH were not required to have exacerbations within 
the  year  prior  to  screening  (Calverley,  2007).  Rather,  a  more  appropriate  comparison  is  with 
SCO40043/SCO100250,  two,  1-year  studies  with  SERETIDE  250/50  (Ferguson  2008;  Anzueto,  2009) 
and  SCO30006,  a  44-week  study  with  SERETIDE  500/50  (Kardos  2007).  Similar  to  the  two  1-year 
studies  with  FF/VI,  these  three  studies  required  a  history  of  exacerbations  within  the  year  prior  to 
screening.  In  SCO30006  the  LS  mean  annual  rate  of  moderate  and  severe  exacerbations  per  patient 
was  1.4  in  the  salmeterol  group.  In  the  pooled  data  SCO40043/SCO100250,  the  annual  rate  of 
moderate  and  severe  exacerbations  in  patients  treated  with  salmeterol  was  1.58.  Although,  cross-
study comparisons are fraught with risk, in similarly designed trials in a similar patient population the 
exacerbation rate was considerably lower with VI than salmeterol which could reflect that VI is better 
than  salmeterol  in  reducing  exacerbations.  Furthermore,  the  lower  exacerbation  rate  with  VI  would 
more  likely  underestimate,  rather  than  overestimate  the  effect  of  FF/VI.  Therefore  the  company 
concludes that VI 25 mcg is an appropriate comparator for the one year exacerbation studies. 
The  Applicant  recognised  that  a  FDC  of  an  ICS  and  a  LABA  are  not  intended  to  be  used  as  first  line 
therapy and therefore proposed to modify the indication as follows: 
Relvar is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of patients with COPD, with a FEV1 <70% predicted 
normal (post-bronchodilator) and an exacerbations history despite regular bronchodilator therapy.

The revised indication was considered acceptable by the CHMP. The also also CHMP considered that the 
active  control  group  chosen  in  the  6-month  and  1-year  pivotal  studies  (VI  25  µg),  despite  not 
corresponding  to  a  LABA  currently  authorised  for  use  in  patients  with  COPD,  was  an  acceptable 
comparator, and that the 25 VI dose selected was appropriate. 
The  Applicant  was  requested  by  the  CHMP  during  the  evaluation  to  further  discuss  the  clinical 
relevance of the effect on annual exacerbations of the FDC versus VI alone. An analysis of the annual 
rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations for the integrated data showed a 27% reduction with 
the FF/VI 100/25 group versus VI 25 alone. The overall relative risk reduction is above the 22% that is 
normally  considered  as  clinically  relevant  difference.  However,  in  absolute  terms,  the  reduction  is  of 
only  0.30  exacerbations  per  year  (0.81  versus  1.11),  which  is  below  the  1  exacerbation  per  year 
considered  clinically  relevant  (Cazzola  et  al.  Eur  Respir  J.  2008;  31:  416–8).  The  Applicant  was 
requested  to  provide  several  pooled  1-year  data  analyses  and  to  discuss  available  data  from  the 
literature with similar products. 
As  these  studies  were  1  year  in  duration  and  conducted  in  subjects  with  a  prior  history  of  COPD 
exacerbations, inclusion of a placebo arm was not felt to be clinically relevant by the Applicant.  
Results of a statistical analysis for both the annual rate of moderate and the annual rate of severe, on-
treatment  COPD  exacerbations  for  the integrated  data  from  studies  HZC102871  and  HZC102970  was 
provided  by  the  Applicant  during  the  evaluation.  The  LS  mean  annual  rate  of  a  moderate  COPD 
exacerbations  was  comparable  to  the  primary  analysis  (0.81  FF/VI  100/25  vs  1.11  VI)  with  a  lower 
annual  rate  in  the  three  FF/VI  arms  (0.70  to  0.83) compared  with  the  VI  arm  (0.99).  The  integrated 
results presented for moderate exacerbations reflect those seen in the overall analysis with statistically 
significant (p≤0.019) reductions in all three FF/VI strengths compared with VI alone. 
The  LS  mean  annual  rate  of  severe  COPD  exacerbation  was  low  and  comparable  across  all  four 
treatment  groups  (range  0.08  to  0.10).  Over  the  treatment  period,  subjects  in  the  FF/VI  50/25  and 
FF/VI 200/25 groups demonstrated an 18% (p=0.313) and 20% reduction (p=0.280), respectively, in 
the annual rate of severe COPD exacerbations compared with subjects in the VI 25 group; subjects in 
the  FF/VI  100/25  group  demonstrated  a  reduction  of  8%  (p=0.695)  compared  with  the VI  25  group. 
However,  these  analyses  are  underpowered  and  need  to  be  interpreted  with  caution  due  to  the  very 
low number of severe exacerbations reported in all treatment arms during the study. 
The Applicant provided the number of moderate and severe exacerbations that occurred in each of the 
four  treatment  arms  in  the  two,  1-year  exacerbation  studies  (pooled  studies  HZC102970  and 
HZC102871). Compared with VI 25, there were 187 fewer exacerbations with FF/VI 100/25 (i.e., 741 
minus 554); 141 fewer with FF/VI 200/25 and 91 fewer with FF/VI 50/25. 
In the two, 1-year exacerbation studies (pooled studies HZC102970 and HZC102871) the mean rate of 
moderate/severe  exacerbations  in  VI  treated  patients  was  1.11/  year;  all  strengths  of  FF/VI 
significantly reduced this rate by 16-27%. The event-based number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent 
1  moderate/severe exacerbation  per  year  was  5.6, 3.3  and  3.8  for  FF/VI  50/25,  100/25  and  200/25, 
respectively  compared  with  VI  25  alone.  It  is  important  to  recognise  that  NNT  values  should  not  be 
interpreted  as  absolute  values;  rather  they  are  relative  to  the  control  arm,  study  duration  and  the 
event rates observed in the specific trial. The event-based NNT calculations were based on the method 
proposed by Halpin 2005.

A  summary  of  the  statistical  analysis  results  for  the  time  to  first  moderate  and  time  to  first  severe 
COPD exacerbation for the integrated data from studies HZC102871 and HZC102970 was submitted by 
the  Applicant  during  the  evaluation.  Treatment  with  FF/VI  100/25  and  FF/VI  200/25  significantly 
lowered the risk of the time to first moderate COPD exacerbation compared with VI 25 treatment (risk 
reductions  of  26%;  p<0.001).  Treatment  with  FF/VI  50/25  also  lowered  the  risk  of  the  time  to  first 
moderate  COPD  exacerbation  (risk  reduction  12%)  compared  with  treatment  with  VI  25  alone; 
however,  the  difference  was  not  significant  (p=0.096).  The  integrated  results  presented  for  time  to 
first  moderate  exacerbations  reflects  those  seen  in  the  overall  analysis  with  statistically  significant 
(p<0.001) reductions in the two highest FF/VI strengths compared with the VI strength. 
There was no difference detected in time to first severe exacerbation between the FF/VI strengths and 
the VI group. This is likely due to the small number of events as reported previously (LS mean annual 
rate ≤ 0.10). 
In studies HZC102871 and HZC102970 severe exacerbations were defined as worsening symptoms of 
COPD  that  required  treatment  with  in-patient  hospitalization.  Severe  exacerbations  made  up  a  small 
percentage  of  all  moderate/severe  exacerbations  ranging  from  11-14%  across  the  treatment  groups. 
An  analysis  of  severe  exacerbations  (annual  rate  and  time  to  first)  was  provided  by  the  Applicant 
during the evaluation as described above. A meaningful statistical analysis of exacerbations leading to 
death could not be conducted due to the small number of events. 
The Applicant provided during the evaluation several sensitivity analyses on exacerbations. An analysis 
of  the  proportion  of  responders  for  the  integrated  studies  HZC102871  and  HZC102970  where  a 
responder  is  a  subject  who  did  not  report  a  moderate/severe  exacerbation  and  did  not  withdrew 
prematurely from the study showed that the odds of being responder were significantly higher for both 
the FF/VI 100/25 and FF/VI 200/25 strengths compared with VI alone. However, this analysis does not 
account for time on treatment until non-response (i.e. moderate/severe exacerbation or withdrawal). 
The  annual  rate  of  moderate/severe  exacerbations  for  those  completing  the  studies  is  lower  than  for 
the  overall  ITT  population.  However,  the  LS  mean  annual  rate  of  a  moderate/severe  COPD 
exacerbation for the completer analysis for the individual studies was lower in the two higher strengths 
of FF/VI (0.65 to 0.72) compared with the VI arm (0.82 to 0.89). The integrated results presented for 
the  completer  analysis  for  moderate/severe  exacerbations  reflects  those  seen  in  the  overall  analysis 
with  statistically  significant  reductions  (20  and  19%;  p≤0.010)  in  the  two  higher  strengths  of  FF/VI 
compared with the VI strength. 
The  Applicant  also  provided  a  summary  of  the  COPD  exacerbations  from  studies  HZC113107, 
HZC113109,  and  HZC112352.  All  three  studies  were  only  12  weeks  duration  and  in  two  of  the  three 
studies  (studies  HZC113107  and  HZC112352)  subjects  were  not  required  to  have  a  history  of 
exacerbations.  As  a  consequence,  the  number  of  events  is  small  which  precludes  drawing  any 
meaningful comparisons. 
The  overall  ancillary  analyses  provided  by  the  Applicant  showed  that  the  FF/VI  100/25  provided  a 
reduction  in  moderate  exacerbations  compared  with  VI  25  OD  dose  that  may  be  considered  to  be  as 
clinically  relevant.  However  the  effect  of  FF/VI  100/25  versus  VI  25  on  severe  exacerbations  was 
neither statistically nor clinically relevant in the different sensitivity analyses conducted.  
The  available  comparative  exacerbation  data  of  the  FF/VI  combination  versus  FC/S  is  limited  to  3-
month studies, in which the overall rate of exacerbations was very low: FF/VI 2.42% vs FC/S 1.94%.

The  Applicant  further  argued  that  previous  studies  assessing  the  effect  of  ICS/LABA  combinations  on 
severe  exacerbation  rate  also  failed  to  demonstrate  a  reduction  in  severe  exacerbations.  The  3-year 
TORCH  study  compared  fluticasone  propionate,  salmeterol,  and  placebo  with  FP/salmeterol  500/50  in 
approximately  6200  subjects  with  COPD.  Although  this  study  was  conducted  in  a  broader  COPD 
population than  the  FF/VI  exacerbation  studies,  (i.e.,  subjects  without  a  history  of  exacerbation  were 
included),  a  statistically  significant  reduction  (12%) in  the  annual  rate  of  moderate  and  severe  COPD 
exacerbations was demonstrated in TORCH when comparing salmeterol with FP/salmeterol (p=0.002) 
[Calverley 2007]. However, similar to the FF/VI exacerbation studies a reduction in the annual rate of 
severe exacerbations was not observed when comparing salmeterol with FP/salmeterol. If a reduction 
in severe exacerbations could not be demonstrated in a study of the size and duration of TORCH, it is 
not  surprising  that  it  was  not  demonstrated  in  the  two  1-year  FF/VI  exacerbation  studies  that  had  a 
smaller  sample  size  (N=3255).  In  the  12  month  TRISTAN  study  which  served  as  the  pivotal 
registration  study  for  FP/salmeterol  in  the  EU  and  was  conducted  in  subjects  with  a  history  of 
exacerbations  a  7%  reduction  in  moderate  and  severe  exacerbations  was  observed  when  comparing 
FP/salmeterol  500/50  with  salmeterol  alone  [Calverley,  2003].  However,  consistent  with  the  FF/VI 
exacerbation  studies  and  TORCH,  a  reduction  in  the  annual  rate  of  severe  exacerbations  was  not 
demonstrated.  Again  and  not  surprisingly,  this  was  due  to  the  low  number  of  subjects  in  each 
treatment group having a severe exacerbation. 
The CHMP concluded that the reduction in moderate exacerbations is clinically relevant, but the effect 
of FF/VI 100/25 versus VI 25 on severe exacerbations was not statistically significant in the different 
sensitivity analyses conducted. Notwithstanding, it is agreed that the lack of significant effect of FF/VI 
100/25  versus  VI  25  on  severe  exacerbations  was  similar  to  the  lack  of  effect  seen  in  TORCH  and 
TRISTAN studies in the comparison of the LABA/ICS combination versus the LABA monocomponent.  
Results in subpopulations  
No specific studies were conducted in special populations. Subgroup analyses did not show a clinically 
relevant  interaction  of  baseline  characteristics  on  the  effect  of  the  drug  on  lung  function  or 
exacerbations. 
Supportive studies 
The 12-Week study HZC113107 was unable to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement for 
the primary endpoint change from baseline trough in 24-hour weighted-mean FEV1 on Treatment Day 
84  between  the  FF/VI  100/25  OD  treatment  group  and  the  salmeterol/FP  50/500  BID.  The  least 
squares (LS) mean change from baseline trough in 24-hour weighted-mean FEV1 on Treatment Day 84 
was  130  ml  in  the  FF/VI  100/25  OD  treatment  group  and  108  ml  in  the  salmeterol/FP  50/500  BID 
treatment group (Dif: 22 ml; 95% CI: -18 ml to 63 ml; p = 0.282). The difference was less than the 
60 ml that was predefined as the clinically relevant difference.  
Relvar Ellipta  
Assessment report  
EMA/282960/2013 
Page 226/279 
 
  
The  12-week  studies  HZC113109  and  HZC112352,  identical  in  design,  showed  diverging  results.  In 
study  HZC113109,  FF/VI  100/25  OD  was  found  to  be  significantly  more  efficacious  in  improving 
weighted-mean 24-hour FEV1 after 12 weeks of treatment than FP/salmeterol 250/50 BID in subjects 
with COPD. The least squares (LS) mean change from baseline trough in 24-hour weighted-mean FEV1 
on  Treatment  Day  84  was  174  mL  in  the  FF/VI  100/25  OD  treatment  group  and  94  mL  in  the 
FP/salmeterol 250/50 BID treatment group (LS mean difference: +80 mL; 95% CI: +37 to +124 ml; p 
<0.001). In addition, a significantly shorter median time to onset of effect on Day 1 was demonstrated 
in  the  FF/VI  100/25  OD  treatment  group  compared  with  the  FP/salmeterol  250/50  BID  treatment 
group. Exacerbation rates were similar. In study HZC112352, both FF/VI 100/25 OD and FP/salmeterol 
250/50  BID  demonstrated  improvements  from  baseline  in  lung  function  in  subjects  with  COPD. 
However, the difference between treatments for the primary endpoint (weighted Mean FEV1 up to 24 
Hours on Day 84) was neither statistically significant nor clinically meaningful (LS mean difference: 29 
ml; 95%CI: -22 to 80 ml; p=0.267). In addition, there were more subjects with COPD exacerbations in 
the  FF/VI  100/25  OD  and  FP/salmeterol  250/50  BID  groups  (11  and  4  COPD  exacerbations, 
espectively). No explanation for the differences observed between studies HZC113109 and HZC112352 
for the primary endpoint (mean change from baseline trough for 0-24hr weighted mean serial FEV1 on 
Day 84) could be provided. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Asthma indication 
Two doses of a new combination of FF/VI (100/25 and 200/25) are applied for the treatment of asthma 
patients  when  a  combination  with  an  ICS  and  a  LABA  is  considered  adequate  (switch  and  step-up 
indication). The asthma indication applied for initially was considered broader than the data submitted 
by  the  CHMP  as  it  represents  both  a  step-up  indication  in  patients  not  adequately  controlled  with  an 
ICS  and  a  substitution  indication  when  a  patient  is  already  controlled  with  an  ICS  plus  a  LABA.  This 
second  part  of  the  indication  was  not  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP  as  no  direct  comparison 
between FF/VI and an approved FDC of an ICS and a LABA was submitted with this application. As a 
consequence the Applicant submitted during the evaluation a revised asthma indication including only 
the step-up part of the indication as follows: 
Relvar Ellipta is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 
years and older where use of a combination medicinal product (long-acting-beta 2-agonist and inhaled 
corticosteroid) is appropriate: 
• 
patients  not  adequately  controlled  with  inhaled  corticosteroids  and  as  “needed”  inhaled  short 
acting beta2-agonist.  
Which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
For  the  low  dose  of  FF/VI  (100/25  µg)  in  study  HZA106827  statistically  significant  differences  in  the 
two  co-primary  endpoints  change  from  baseline  in  trough  FEV1  and  mean  FEV1  at  week  12  versus 
placebo  were  observed  in  study  HZA106827.  In  addition  statistically  significant  differences  in 
secondary  efficacy  endpoints  (rescue  free  and  symptoms  free  24h  periods)  versus  placebo  were  also 
observed. Although the results failed to show statistically significant differences between FF/VI and FF 
monotherapy on relevant lung function parameters and small but clinically relevant effects of the FF/VI 
on  symptomatic  endpoints  versus  FF  monotherapy  were  observed,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
efficacy of the FF/VI 100/25 dose in asthma is well supported. Furthermore, the effects observed with 
FF/VI 100/25 dose are similar to the one obtained with other LABA/ICS combinations.  
Relvar Ellipta  
Assessment report  
EMA/282960/2013 
Page 227/279 
 
  
For  the  low  dose  of  FF/VI  (100/25)  the  risk  of  experiencing  a  severe  asthma  exacerbation  was 
decreased  by  20%  compared  with  FF  100  alone  (hazard  ratio  =  0.795,  p  =  0.036  95%  CI  (0.642; 
0.985)  and  the  rate  of  severe  asthma  exacerbations  was  decreased  by  25%  compared  with  FF  100 
alone  (P  =  0.014)  in  study  HZA106837.Although  these  reductions  in  absolute  terms  are  small  they 
were considered clinically relevant by the CHMP.  
For the high dose of FF/VI (200/25) in study HZA106829 statistically significant differences in the two 
co-primary endpoints change from baseline in trough FEV1 and mean FEV1 at week 12 versus FF 200 
and FP 1000 were obtained in study HZA106829. The differences achieved on lung function parameters 
were greater with the high dose than with the low dose. In addition, statistically significant differences 
in  the  secondary  endpoint  rescue-free  24h  periods  versus  FF  200  were  also  observed.  The  CHMP 
therefore  considered  that  the  efficacy  of  the  FF/VI  200/25  dose  in  asthma  is  well  supported. 
Furthermore,  the  effects  observed  with  the  FF/VI  200/25  dose  are  similar  to  the  one  obtained  with 
other LABA/ICS combinations.  
Taking into account the asthma indication initially claimed by the Applicant, adequate characterization 
of  the  population  and  the  status  of  asthma  at  baseline  measured  by  the  symptom  score  is  key. 
Although  in  study  HZA106837  patients  were  required  to  be  symptomatic  and  patients  carried  a  daily 
diary,  the  data  were  not  captured  in  the  database  and  therefore  it  makes  it  difficult  to  know  the 
baseline status of patients regarding symptoms free and rescue free days in that population, which is 
considered a limitation of the efficacy analysis. The results of both studies HZA106827 and HZA106829 
show that patients were uncontrolled at baseline and that there were very few symptoms free 24 h and 
rescue  free 24  h periods at  baseline in  all treatments  groups.  This  is in  line with  the  requirements  of 
Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Clinical  Investigation  for  medicinal  products  in  the  treatment  of  asthma 
(CPMP/EWP/2922/01) on the population to be included in these trials. 
Although  the  number  of  adolescents  and  patients  aged  >65  years  was  too  small  to  allow  statistical 
analysis for most treatment groups, in an integrated analysis a benefit of FF/VI over placebo and over 
FF  alone  in  trough  FEV1  was  seen  in  both  age  groups  at  Week  2,  Week  12  and  Week  24,  further 
supporting the CHMP’s acceptance of clinical efficacy for the asthma indication.  
COPD indication 
In  the  6-month  pivotal  studies  HZC112206  and  HZC112207,  for  FF/VI  100/25,  statistically  significant 
improvements  in  the  co-primary  endpoints  weighted  mean  FEV1  0-4  hours  at  Day  168  and  change 
from baseline in pre-dose trough FEv1 at D169 were observed versus placebo and versus FF 100 alone 
but  not  versus  VI  25  alone.  In  addition,although  there  was  a  lack  of  statistically  significant  effect  of 
FF/VI 100/25 versus placebo in mean CRQ-SAS Dyspnoea Domain scores in both studies HZC112206 
and  HZC112207,  a  responder  analysis  for  CRQ-SAS  Dyspnea  scores  showed that  the  odds of  being  a 
responder was between 1.67 and 2.03 times greater with FF/VI 100/25 than with placebo. In addition, 
statistically significant improvements with FF/VI 100/25 versus placebo for the secondary endpoints of 
COPD  symptoms  scores  and  the  number  of  night-time  awakenings  requiring  rescue  medication 
(salbutamol), while a post-hoc analysis of total rescue-free days showed that FF/VI 100/25 provided a 
higher  percentage  of  salbutamol-free  days  (19%  and  14%  difference  versus  placebo  in  study 
HZC112206 and in study HZC112207 respectively).  
Relvar Ellipta

EMA/282960/2013 
Page 228/279 
 
  
In the one-year pivotal studies HZC102970 and HZC102871, treatment with FF/VI 100/25 provided a 
statistically  significant  improvement  in  the  primary  endpoint  LS  mean  annual  rate  of  moderate  and 
severe exacerbations compared with VI 25 (between 21% and 34% reduction in each of the studies). 
There  was  a  lack  of  dose-response  between  the  three  doses  of  FF/VI  studied  in  annual  rate  of 
moderate/severe  exacerbations  in  the  one-year  pivotal  studies,  with  a  differential  effect  of  the  FF/VI 
200/25 dose in each of the studies (more prominent in study HZC102970 than in study HZC102871). 
For the secondary endpoint time to first exacerbation and moderate exacerbations requiring treatment 
with  oral/systemic  corticosteroids,  treatment  with  FF/VI  100/25  provided  a  statistically  significant 
reduction  versus  VI  25  alone  for  both  one-year  studies.  These  results  are  consistent  with  those 
observed  for  the  main  exacerbation  outcome.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  active  control  group 
chosen  in  the  6-month  and  1-year  pivotal  studies  (VI  25  µg),  despite  not  corresponding  to  a  LABA 
currently authorised for use in patients with COPD, was an acceptable comparator, and that the 25 VI 
dose selected was appropriate. The CHMP therefore considered that the data provided by the Applicant 
adequately demonstrated the clinical relevance of the effect of FF/VI 100/25 on COPD exacerbations.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  clinical  development  program  to  support  the  approval  of  FF/VI  Inhalation  Powder  consists  of  16 
clinical  studies  in  subjects  with  asthma,  10  clinical  studies  in  patients  with  COPD  and  52  clinical 
pharmacology studies. 
Safety  data  from  the  two  intended  indications  (asthma  and  COPD)  were  presented  separately.  Given 
the existing differences between the populations and conditions this was considered acceptabe.  
As  requested  by  the  CHMP  an  additional  analysis  of  the  global  safety  profile  of  the  product  was 
provided  by  the  Applicant  during  the  evaluation.  The  integration  of  data  for  the  two  intended 
indications did not show additional potential clinical relevant AEs, drug related AEs and serious AEs that 
previously reported.  
The safety data of FF/VI are classified into different analyses sets for COPD and asthma indications: 
•  COPD  
a)  Integrated  safety  analysis  of  seven  primary  and  supporting  COPD  studies  (HZC112206, 
HZC112207, HZC102871, HZC102970, HZC110946, HZC111348, and B2C111045).  
b)  Separate integrations of the two 6-month studies (HZC112206 and HZC112207) and of the two 
1-year exacerbation studies (HZC102970 and HZC102871).  
c)  Safety  data  from  studies  HZC112352,  HZC113107  and  HZC113109  were  not  integrated 
because  they  contained  differing  comparator  arms  (fluticasone  propionate/salmeterol)  than 
other studies.

Table 94.  Asthma. Grouping the studies 
A  total  of  52  Clinical  Pharmacological  studies  (24  evaluating  FF,  17  evaluating  VI    and  11  evaluating 
the  FF/VI  combination  in  subjects  with  COPD,  asthma,  hepatic  impairment,  renal  impairment  and  in 
healthy subjects) provide further support. For the main purpose of this assessment COPD and Asthma 
Integrated Summary sets constitute the respective primary population for safety analysis. 
The safety profile of FF/VI has been defined with respect to placebo and each mono component of the 
combination  (FF  and  VI).  Comparisons  versus  active  comparators  were  not  part  of  the  integrated 
safety  data  sets  although  some  results  have  been  discussed  by  the  Applicant  when  considered 
relevant.  These  comparative  analyses  were  considered  of  relevance  in  order  to  put  into  context  the 
product  with  respect  to  other  alternatives  of  reference.  In  this  regard,  the  Applicant  provided  one 
integrated analysis for COPD of three studies with FP/salmeterol as comparator, and two independent 
studies  for  the  asthma  indication  (study  HZA113091  with  FF/VI  100/25  versus  FP/salmeterol  250/50 
BD,  and  study  HZA106839  with  FF/VI  100/25,  FF/VI  200/25  and  FP  500BD).  The  frequency  of  AEs, 
serious  AEs,  drug  related  AEs  and  AEs  of  special  interest  were  similar  between  treatments  with  the 
exception of cardiovascular events that were more frequent in FF/VI 200/25 group in asthma patients.

Patient exposure 
A total of 17,109 subjects, were treated in the FF/VI clinical studies in subjects with asthma or COPD. 
In addition, 1304 subjects were treated in the 52 clinical pharmacology studies.  
A  total  of  7783  subjects  with  COPD  were  treated  in  the  COPD  clinical  programme.  Of  these,  1060 
subjects were treated with FF/VI 50/25, 2034 subjects with FF/VI 100/25 and 1047 subjects with FF/VI 
200/25.  A  total  of  1867  subjects  were  treated  with  the  various  strengths  of  FF/VI  for  more  than  48 
weeks, and 686 subjects were treated with the various strengths of FF/VI for more than 52 weeks. 
Table 95.  Summary of Exposure to Study Drug (All Integrated Studies ITT Population) 
A  total  of  10,630    subjects  with  asthma  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication  in  the  FF/VI 
clinical development program. Of these subjects, 2652 were treated with FF/VI. A total of 646 subjects 
in the FF/VI 100/25 group, and 100 subjects in the FF/VI 200/25 group were treated for more than 52 
weeks. 
Table 96.  Treatment Exposure (Integrated Asthma Clinical Studies, Key Treatment Groups) 
The  size  of  the  database  and  the  duration  of  exposure  of  FF/VI  are  considered  sufficient  for  the 
evaluation of the safety profile of the medicinal product for both indications. The long term exposure is 
considered limited for the high dose to be administered in asthmatic subjects (FF/VI 200/25). 
Most of the subjects enrolled in COPD and asthma studies received at least one dose of the medicinal 
product  and  completed  the  studies.  Patients  on  corticosteroids  (combined  or  not)  showed  greater 
percentages  of  withdrawals  than  those  on  vilanterol.  The  most  common  reasons  for  withdrawal  from 
the  COPD  studies  were  adverse  events  (7%)  and  lack  of  efficacy  (4%),  mainly  due  to  COPD 
exacerbations.  These  figures  are  similar  when  six-month  and  one-year  safety  sets  are  revised.  With 
respect  to  asthma  studies,  lack  of  efficacy  was  the  most  common  reason,  although  not  for  FF/VI 
groups which showed lower percentages than placebo or other active groups.  
The majority of the subjects included in the seven primary COPD studies were White (85%) and male 
(62%);  the  mean  age  was  62.9  years.  Subjects  tended  to  be  slightly  overweight.  Similar 
characteristics  were  observed  when  Six-Month  Lung  Function  Studies  and  One-Year  Exacerbation 
Studies  were  separately  analysed.  A  total  of  2508  subjects  were  aged  at  least  65  years.  The  safety 
database allows, with some exceptions (e.g.>85 y) the characterisation of most of the population.

The majority of subjects in the asthma ITT Population was white (74%) and female (62%) and had a 
mean  age  of  41  years.  The  mean  age  of  subjects in  the  key  treatment groups  ranged  from  40  to  43 
years. Seven percent to 14% of subjects in the key treatment groups were 12 to 17 years of age and 
5% to 7% of subjects in the key treatment groups were 65 to 84 years of age. No subjects in the key 
treatment  groups  were  85  years  of  age  or  older.  To  conclude  the  number  of  adolescents  and  elderly 
patients  included  in  the  astma  studies  is  considered  limited.  Safety  in  asthmatic  adolescents  patients 
treated  with  the  200/25  strength  is  included  as  missing  information  in  the  RMP  (continual  proactive 
Pharmacovigilance activities). 
Adverse events 
The incidence of AEs has only been presented for COPD and asthma studies when reported by ≥3% of 
subjects  (preferred  terms).  An  approach  providing  the  frequency  of  all  adverse  events  would  have 
been preferable in order to have a more accurate picture of the safety profile of the combination. For 
both COPD and asthma the Applicant has provided the exposure-adjusted number of subjects reporting 
adverse events in the “all studies” integration (SOC) given the important difference in exposure to drug 
among the different studies.  
The  most  frequent  AEs  for  both  the  COPD  and  asthma  studies  were  headache,  nasopharyngitis  and 
upper respiratory tract infections, with similar incidences in both populations. When exposure-adjusted 
number of subjects reporting AEs is considered, nasopharingitis, upper respiratory tract infections and 
headache  are  the  most  frequent  (194.9,  102.8  and  143.5  events  per  1000  subjects-years  of 
exposure). Similar figures were observed for the asthma studies. This is in line with what expected for 
this kind of combinations.

Oral candidiasis was also common in the COPD population and bronchitis and oropharyngeal pain in the 
asthma population. There was not a totally clear dose response relationship. These AEs are in line with 
those already known for authorised FDC of LABAs and ICS. 
Drug-related adverse events 
For the COPD indication the Applicant has not provided data on the drug-related adverse events for all 
integrated  clinical  studies  in  the  COPD  population.  For  asthma,  drug-related  adverse  events  were 
reported  for  the  highest  dose  (FF/VI  200/25)  (11%).  Frequencies  were  similar  for  the  combination 
groups  and  treatments  containing  FF.  As  expected,  lower  incidence  was  seen  in  the  placebo  group. 
Dysphonia and oral candidiasis were the most frequently drug-related adverse events reported for all 
treatment groups. Both AEs are known local effects of corticosteroids. 
Events of special interest 
The  Applicant  has  provided  safety  evaluation  of  adverse  events  known  to  occur  with  both 
monocomponents  of  the  combination  (bone  disorders,  cardiovascular  effects,  effects  on  potassium, 
effects  on  glucose,  hypersensitivity,  local  corticosteroid  effects,  ocular  effects,  LRTI  excluding 
pneumonia, pneumonia, systemic corticosteroid effects and tremor).

For both indications the most frequent adverse events of special interest were with local steroid effects 
being more frequent with the highest doses (12% for the FF/VI 100/25 and 15% for FF/VI 200/25 for 
COPD, and 8% and 11% respectively for asthma). Surprisingly, the highest incidence of oropharyngeal 
candidiasis  in  COPD  studies  was  noted  in  the  lowest  dose  combination  group  (4%)  and  these  events 
occurred at lower incidences in the FF/VI 100/25 and 200/25 groups (1% - 2%).  
Pneumonia 
Given  that  pneumonia  is  a  well-known  risk  associated  with  steroids,  the  Applicant  has  provided  a 
specific  analysis  of  this  AE  in  COPD  studies.  The  incidence  of  pneumonia  was  around  6%  across  the 
FF/VI  groups  compared  with  3%  in  the  VI  25  group,  <1%  in  the  placebo  and  FF  groups.  However, 
when data are discussed as subjects with an event/1000 treatment years, the FF/VI 200/25 group has 
the worst numbers for pneumonia (76.7 in the FF/VI 200/25 group and 68.2 in the FF/VI 100/25 vs. 
18  for  placebo).  For  severe  pneumonia  these  figures  are  as  follows:  32.5,  22.7  and  0,  respectively 
while  for  serious  pneumonia  the  following  have  been  reported:  33.8  for  FF/VI  200/25  and  6  for 
placebo). Finally, the exposure-adjusted numbers of subjects with fatal pneumonia are as follows: 7.8 
for FF/VI 200/25 versus 1.2 for FF/VI 100/25 and 0 for the rest of groups. Although the highest dose 
(FF/VI  200/25)  is  not  recommended  in  the  treatment  of  COPD,  a  potential  similar  effect  in  asthma 
patients for whom the FF/VI 200/25 dose can be used cannot be ruled out.  
Table 99.  Summary of On-Treatment Pneumonia (All Studies ITT Population) 
The  Applicant  has  also estimated  the time to  first on-treatment  pneumonia in  COPD.  Results  indicate 
that  the  risk  for  pneumonia  and  serious  pneumonia  were  higher  in  all  FF/VI  treatment  groups 
compared  with  the  VI  25  group  with  statistically  significant  difference.  For  the  lowest  intended 
posology FF/VI 100/25 the hazard ratio for “pneumonia” was 1.8 (1.2-3.0) p=0.01 and HR for “serious 
pneumonia”  was  3  (1.4-6.8)  p=0.007.  For  the  highest  combination  dose  the  HR  was  2  (1.3,  3.2)  for 
“pneumonia” and 2.7 (1.3, 6.3) for “serious pneumonia”.

Table 100.  Analysis of Time to First On-Treatment Pneumonia and Time to First Serious On-
Treatment Pneumonia (HCZ102871/HZC102970ITT) 
Data for asthma studies show similar results for the highest dose combination (18.4 subjects with an 
event/1000  subject-year  of  exposure  in  the  highest  dose  combination  group  versus  9.6  in  the  lowest 
combination dose group and 8 in the placebo group).  
The  Applicant  was  request  by  the  CHMP  to  provide  any  available  data  on  pneumonia  of  the  FF/VI 
combinations  in  comparison  with  ADVAIR/SERETIDE  from  comparative  studies  (incidence  and 
exposure-adjusted; total and separately for FF/VI 100/25 and 200/25). 
Exposure-adjusted  data  showed  a  dose-related  higher  incidence  of  pneumonia,  severe  pneumonia, 
serious pneumonia and fatal pneumonia for the FF/VI combination in comparison with VI in a specific 
analysis  in  COPD.  In  addition,  data  regarding  pneumonia  rates  in  asthma  studies  also  suggested  a 
dose-related deleterious effect of the FF/VI combination. The Applicant was requested by the CHMP to 
provide comparisions with other authorised FDC of a LABA and an ICS and to provide further analyses 
of pneumonia. 
The  Applicant  provided  during  the  evaluation  additional  analyses  to  further  investigate  the  risk  of 
pneumonia with FF/VI and how this compares with a marketed ICS/LABA, namely FP/salmeterol.  
The  Applicant  has  re-reviewed  the  terms  selected  for  pneumonia  and  included  additional  terms;  the 
final list is included in the table below:

For  asthma  unlike  COPD,  because  of  the  difference  in  study  designs  and  exposures  and  also  the  fact 
that  no  subject  in  the  FF/VI  asthma  programme  had  multiple  events,  the  main  focus  is  on  incidence 
and exposure adjusted incidence. The data are presented along with 95% CIs. For COPD, as subjects 
could  report  more  than  one  event,  event  rates  (number  of  events  per  1000  patient  years)  and 
incidence (not adjusted for exposure) are presented. 
In  the  FF/VI  studies,  severity  of  pneumonia  was  determined  by  the  Investigator.  For  example,  there 
were  occasions  when  pneumonia  was  designated  “severe”  by  the  investigator  yet  apparently  did  not 
result  in  hospitalisation  (i.e.  “non-serious”).  Conversely,  there  were  pneumonia  episodes  that  were 
classified as “moderate” by the investigator, yet the subject was hospitalised (i.e. “serious’). As such, 
the designation of severity by the investigator should not necessarily be construed to indicate a serious 
pneumonia event and vice versa. Severity was not determined based on published pneumonia severity 
indices  such  as  CURB-65.  Furthermore,  the  Applicant  did  not  collect  data  on  all  components  of  such 
indices and so severity using such definitions cannot be defined post-hoc.  
The Applicant recognised the importance of comparing the data from the FF/VI programme with data 
from  other  authorised  products.  Across  both  asthma  and  COPD,  the  Applicant  conducted  four  studies 
versus  FP/salmeterol.  Three  studies  evaluated  FF/VI  100/25  OD  compared  with  either  FP/salmeterol 
500/50  bd  (in  study  HZC113107)  or  250/50  bd  (in  studies  HZC112352  and  HZC113109)  over  a  12-
week treatment period in subjects with COPD. One study, study HZA113091, evaluated FF/VI 100/25 
OD compared with FP/salmeterol 250/50 bd over a 24-week treatment period in subjects with asthma. 
No  studies  have  been  conducted  to  directly  compare  FF/VI  200/25  with  FP/salmeterol.  However,  in 
light  of  the  short  treatment  duration  of  these  studies  and  differences  in  patient  population  to  the 
proposed  therapeutic  indication  for  COPD,  the  Applicant  considered  appropriate  to  make  indirect 
comparisons.

COPD 
Three  studies  were  conducted  to  compare  FF/VI  with  FP/salmeterol  in  COPD;  HZC113109  and 
HZC112352  compared  FF/VI  100/25  OD  with  FP/salmeterol  250/50  bd,  the  licensed  strength  for 
treatment of COPD in the US, and HZC113107 compared FF/VI 100/25 OD with FP/salmeterol 500/50 
bd,  the  licensed  strength  for  treatment  of  COPD  in  the  EU.  Subjects  in  HZC113107  were  required  to 
have  had  an  exacerbation  in  the  three  years  prior  to  randomisation,  however  in  HZC113109  and 
HZC112352 there was no formal requirement for subjects to have had an exacerbation history. These 
differences in patient population are considered important since a history of exacerbations is a known 
risk factor for developing pneumonia [Müllerova, 2012].  
Table 101.  Summary of Pneumonia Adverse Events (COPD studies HZC113107, HZC113109, 
HZC112352) 
Overall, the incidence of pneumonia in the FF/VI 100/25 group (5 subjects with an event; <1%) was 
similar  to  that  in  the  FP/salmeterol  500/50  group  (2  subjects  with  an  event;  <1%)  in  the  12  week 
studies  ;  there  were  no  events  in  the  FP/salmeterol  250/50  group.  This  is  not  surprising  since  in  the 
FP/salmeterol  250/50  comparator  studies  subjects  were  not  required  to  have  a  history  of 
exacerbations. 
Asthma 
Evidence from direct comparisons versus FP/salmeterol suggests no difference in risk of pneumonia or 
serious  pneumonia  in  asthma.  One  24-week  study  HZA113091  was  conducted  to  compare  the  FF/VI 
100/25 combination with FP/salmeterol 250/50 bd in asthma. 
There were no events of pneumonia or serious pneumonia in the FF/VI arm compared with 2 events of 
pneumonia  in  the  FP/salmeterol  group  including  1  serious  pneumonia  event.  No  severe  pneumonia 
events were reported in either treatment group and there were no fatal events.

Table 102.  Sumamry of Pneumonia Adverse Events in Asthma (HZA113091) 
The  Applicant  was  requested  by  the  CHMP  to  provide  a  specific  analysis  of  pneumonia  severity  in 
asthma  patients  in  a  similar  manner  than  in  COPD  (incidence  and  exposure-adjusted;  total  and 
separately for FF/VI 100/25 and 200/25 versus the comparators). 
Overall, the incidence of pneumonia was low (<=1.1%) in all treatment groups with the 95% CIs for 
both the incidence and the exposure rate overlapping across treatment groups). No subjects reported 
more  than  one  asthma  event.  When  grouping  treatment  groups  according  to  whether  they  contained 
FF 100, FF 200, another ICS or no ICS, the lowest incidence of pneumonia occurred in the all non-ICS 
containing  and  all  ICS  (other  than  FF)  groups  (0.2%  in  both)  compared  with  0.6%  in  the  all  FF  100 
containing  group  and  0.7%  in  the  all  FF  200  containing  group.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that 
placebo was only included in studies of 6 months duration or less compared with a maximum duration 
of 76 weeks for the FF/VI 100/25 and FF100 treatment group.

Serious Pneumonia 
Overall, the incidence of serious pneumonia was low and similar across groups (0% to 0.3%), with the 
lowest  incidence  occurring  in  the  FP  100  bd  and  FP  250  bd  groups  (0%)  and  the  highest  incidence 
occurring in the FF 100 group (0.3%).  
Exposure  adjusted  numbers  of  subjects  reporting  serious  pneumonia  were  similar  across  treatment 
groups with the highest reported in the FF 200, FP 500 bd and FP/salmeterol 250/50 bd groups (5.2, 
5.6  and  5.7  subjects  with  an  event/1000  treatment  years,  respectively)  compared  with  the  placebo 
and FF 100 groups (4.8 and 4.2 subjects with an event/1000 treatment years, respectively), the FF/VI 
200/25  group  (3.7  subjects  with  an  event/1000  treatment  years)  and  the  FF/VI  100/25  group  (2.8 
subjects  with  an  event/1000  treatment  years).  No  serious  pneumonia  was  reported in  the  FP  100 bd 
and FP 250 bd groups.

Severe Pneumonia 
Events of pneumonia that were considered severe (severity based on the investigator’s discretion on a 
scale  of  mild,  moderate  or  severe  as  indicated  for  adverse  events)  occurred  only  in  FF  containing 
treatment  arms:  2  subjects  each  in  the  FF/VI  200/25  and  FF  100  groups  and  1  subject  each  in  the 
FF/VI 100/25 and FF 200 groups. 
Fatal Pneumonia 
One  subject,  receiving  FF  100,  had  fatal  pneumonia  reported  as  an  adverse  event  in  the  long-term 
asthma exacerbation study. 
The  Applicant  was  requested  by  the  CHMP  to  provide  an  analysis  of  all  pneumonia  events  from  all 
studies including short term including all ‘types’ and terms which might signal pneumonia.  
COPD 
Pneumonia 
In the FF/VI COPD clinical programme, data were originally integrated for the 6-month studies and 1-
year  exacerbation  studies  separately.  The  adverse  event  data  from  seven  Phase  II/III  studies 
(including  the  two  6  month  studies  and  the  two  1  year  studies)  were  also  integrated  although  the 
interpretation  of  these  data  is  confounded  by  the  different  durations  of  exposure,  treatment  groups, 
baselines  and  subject  populations  across  the  seven  studies.  Differences  in  the  subject  populations  is 
particularly important since subjects in the one-year studies were required to have at least one COPD 
exacerbation in the 12-months prior to the study that required systemic/oral corticosteroids, antibiotics 
and/or hospitalization which increased their risk of pneumonia. 
One year exacerbation studies 
The  Applicant  states  that the  most  relevant  studies to  compare  rates  of  pneumonia  are  the  two,  one 
year  exacerbation,  trials  (HZC102970  and  HZC102871)  conducted  with  FF/VI  100/25  and  two,  one 
year  exacerbation  trials  (SCO400043  and  SCO100250)  [Ferguson,  2008;  Anzueto,  2009]  conducted 
with  FP/salmeterol  250/50  bd.  These  four  studies  were  of identical design  although  the  FF/VI  100/25 
studies  were  conducted  globally  whereas  the  FP/salmeterol  250/50  studies  were  conducted  only  in 
North  America.  In  addition,  comparisons  can  be  made  to  SCO30006  [Kardos,  2007],  a  44  week 
exacerbation  study  conducted  in  Germany  with  FP/salmeterol  500/50  bd  which  differed  slightly  from 
the FF/VI 100/25 OD and FP/salmeterol 250/50 bd studies in that the latter four studies included a 4 
week  run-in  period  where  all  subjects  received  FP/salmeterol  250/50.  All  five studies  were conducted 
in  patients  with  a  history  of  exacerbations.  Based  on  indirect  comparisons  of  pneumonia  rates  from 
COPD  studies  of  similar  design  and  population,  the number  of  pneumonias  per  1000 treatment  years 
on  FF/VI  100/25  OD  was  slightly  lower  than  the  rate  observed  in  an  integrated  analysis  of  the  two 
studies with FP/salmeterol 250/50 bd, although the rate was somewhat higher than with FP/salmeterol 
500/50  bd.  However  it  should  be  noted  that  the  rate  on  FP/salmeterol  500/50  is  based  on  only  one 
study  and  in  SCO30006  the  rates  of  pneumonia  in  all  treatment  arms  including  salmeterol  were 
generally lower than other studies with FP/salmeterol.

SCO30006, SCO0100250 ITT) 
All COPD studies 
The  original  seven  study  integration  presented  in  the  MAA  has  been  updated  to  include  the  three  12 
week  head  to  head  studies  versus  FP/salmeterol.  In  addition,  to  provide  some  comparative  data, 
integrations have been performed for all FP/salmeterol 250/50 studies and for all FP/salmeterol 500/50 
studies  (excluding  TORCH).  For  the  latter  integration,  TORCH  was  reported  separately.  As  this  was  a 
three year outcome study in a large number of subjects for which there is no similar study conducted 
with FF/VI or with FP/salmeterol 250/50 it was considered inappropriate to include it in the integration 
presented below. 
Overall, across all ten integrated studies (all studies, ITT population), the incidence of pneumonia was 
greater  in  the  FF/VI  200/25  and  FF/VI  50/25  treatment  groups  (5%  to  6%)  than  in  the  VI  25  group 
(3%), the FF 100 and FF 200 groups (1%), and the placebo group (<1%). The incidence in the FF/VI 
100/25  group  (3%)  was  similar  to  VI.  (see  table  below).  Exposure-adjusted  number  of  pneumonias 
were higher in the FF/VI treatment groups (69.2 to 92.3 events/1000 treatment years) compared with 
the  VI  25  group  (42.2  events/1000  treatment  years),  the  FF  100  and  FF  200  groups  (44.6  and  37.6 
events/1000  treatment  years,  respectively),  and  the  placebo  group  (18.0  events/1000  treatment 
years). These data are driven primarily by the larger number of subjects with pneumonia in the one-
year exacerbation studies, in which some subjects entered with a history of pneumonia, and may have 
been more at risk compared with the remaining studies in this “all studies” integration. This 10-study 
integration illustrates the importance of combining data from similar studies as the rate of pneumonia 
in  the  FF/VI  100/25  arm  has  been  diluted  by  data  from  shorter  duration  studies  in  a  less  “at  risk” 
population.

to the rates observed in the FP/salmeterol 250/50 exacerbation studies, which recruited a more at risk 
population.

Serious Pneumonia 
One year exacerbation studies 
Based on indirect comparisons of pneumonia rates from COPD studies of similar design and population, 
the  rate  of  serious  pneumonias  was  lower  on  FF/VI  100/25  (42.9)  and  FF/VI  200/25  (35.1)  than 
FP/salmeterol  250/50  (53.0)  and  slightly  higher  than  the  rate  observed  following  treatment  with 
FP/salmeterol  500/50  (34.5).  However  it  should  be  noted  that  the  rate  on  FP/salmeterol  500/50  is 
based  on  only  one  study  and  in  SCO30006  the  rates  of  pneumonia  in  all  treatment  arms  including 
salmeterol were generally lower than other studies with FP/salmeterol. Exposure adjusted numbers of 
serious  pneumonia  ranged  from  35.1  to  42.9  events/1000  treatment  years  in  the  FF/VI  groups 
compared with 12.1 events/1000 treatment years for the VI 25 treatment group 
All COPD studies 
Across all ten integrated studies (all studies, ITT population), the incidence of serious pneumonia was 
greater in the FF/VI 200/25 and 50/25 treatment groups (2%) than in the FF/VI 100/25 group (1% ), 
VI  25  group  (<1%),  the  FF  100  and  FF  200  groups  (<1%  each),  and  the  placebo  group  (<1%). 
Overall, across all integrated FP/salmeterol 500/50 studies excluding TORCH, the incidence of serious 
pneumonia  was  greater  in  the  FP/salmeterol  500/50  treatment  group  (3.3%)  than  in  the  salmeterol 
group  (1.3%),  the  FP  group  (1.7%),  and  the  placebo  group  (0.4%).  The  number  of  serious 
pneumonias was higher in the TORCH study than in other FP/salmeterol 500/50 studies but similar to 
the rates observed in the 250/50 exacerbation studies, which recruited a more at risk population.  
Severe Pneumonia 
One year exacerbation studies 
In  the  FF/VI  groups,  2%  to  3%  of  the  subjects  had  pneumonia  that  was  considered  severe  (severity 
based on the investigator’s discretion on a scale of mild, moderate or severe as indicated for adverse 
events)  compared  with  <1%  that  were  considered severe  in the  VI  25  group,  and  exposure  adjusted 
numbers  of  severe  pneumonia  ranged  from  24.2  to  35.5  events/1000  treatment  years  in  the  FF/VI 
groups compared with 7.6 events/1000 treatment years for the VI 25 treatment group.

All COPD studies 
Across all ten integrated studies (all studies, ITT population), the incidence of severe pneumonia was 
greater in the FF/VI 200/25 and 50/25 treatment groups (2%) than in the FF/VI 100/25 group (1% ), 
VI 25 group (<1%), the FF 100 and FF 200 groups (<1% each), and the placebo group (<1%). 
Fatal Pneumonia 
One year exacerbation studies 
Seven  subjects  had  fatal  pneumonia  reported  as  an  adverse  event  across  the  two  oneyear 
exacerbation  studies,  one  subject  in  the  FF/VI  100/25  treatment  group  and  6  subjects  in  the  FF/VI 
200/25 treatment group. The exposure adjusted numbers of subjects with fatal pneumonia in the FF/VI 
100/25 group was 1.5 subjects with an event/1000 treatment years compared with 8.8 subjects with 
an event/1000 treatment years for the FF/VI 200/25 treatment group.  
There  were  7  fatal  on-treatment  pneumonia  related  events  in  the  COPD  Population  (an  additional 
subject  had  a  fatal  COPD  exacerbation  although  pneumonia  was  also  reported);  all  but  one  of  these 
was with the FF/VI 200/25 strength in a single study; one event was with the FF/VI 100/25 strength in 
a different study. This site also reported a much higher incidence of SAEs and deaths from all-causes 
irrespective of treatment than any other site. In order to further understand these pneumonia events 
in  the  FF/VI  programme,  further  statistical  analysis  of  the  HZC102871  and  HZC102970  studies  was 
undertaken; in particular the characteristics of the subjects recruited in the Philippines compared with 
the  rest  of  the  populations  in  the  two  studies.  Additional  analyses  of  other  large  sponsored  by  the 
Applicant  COPD  studies  (TORCH),  with  sites  in  the  Philippines  was  also  completed.  Finally,  several 
members  from  the  Applicant’s  Respiratory  team  travelled  to  Manila,  Philippines  to  meet  with  the 
investigators who recruited subjects into the FF/VI studies to identify any differences in site make-up, 
subject  demographics,  medical  care  delivery,  etc.,  which  might  influence  outcomes.  These 
investigations  suggest  these  events  may  have  been  influenced  by  a  combination  of  other  factors 
including disease severity, healthcare system and reporting of cause of death. 
All COPD studies 
Across  all  ten  integrated  studies  (all  studies,  ITT  population),  the  incidence  of  fatal  pneumonia  was 
greater in the FF/VI 200/25 and 100/25 treatment groups (<1%; 6 and 1 event respectively) than in 
the FF/VI 50/25 group, VI 25 group, the FF 100 and FF 200 groups, and the placebo group in which no 
fatal events were reported. Excluding TORCH, six subjects had fatal pneumonia reported as an adverse 
event  in  the  FP/salmeterol  500/50  programme,  four  subjects  in  the  FP/salmeterol  500/50  treatment 
group,  one  subject  in  the  salmeterol  50  treatment  group  and  1  subject  in  the  placebo  group.  Seven 
subjects  had  fatal  pneumonia  reported  as  an  adverse  event in  the  FP/salmeterol 250/50 programme, 
six  subjects  in  the  FP/salmeterol  250/50  treatment  group  and  one  subject  in  the  salmeterol  50 
treatment  group.  There  were  no  events  in  the  placebo  or  FP  250  group.  There  were  12  fatal 
pneumonias  in  the  TORCH  study,  which  is  more  than  in  any  other  FP/salmeterol  study.  This  is  not 
surprising since the TORCH study was of much longer duration.

Asthma 
Pneumonia 
In  the  asthma  programme,  the  incidence  of  Community  Acquired  Pneumonia  (CAP)  for  FF  containing 
(i.e. FF and FF/VI) groups was within the same range of incidences seen with other ICS. Importantly, 
the  highest  incidence  seen  in  the  FF/VI  200/25  group  (18.4  subjects  with  an  event  per  1000  patient 
years) was very similar to the highest incidence of 19.7 patients with an event per 1000 patient years) 
seen  in  FP/salmeterol  250/50  bd  group  in  the  integration  of  the  FP/salmeterol  studies.  The  detailed 
analysis of the FP/salmeterol studies is shown in the three tables below. However, to facilitate indirect 
comparison  of  pneumonia  rates  for  FF/VI  and  FP/salmeterol,  rates  and  exposure  adjusted  rates  for 
pneumonia and serious pneumonia are shown in the table below. 
In  the  FF/VI  studies,  duration  of  treatment  varied,  the  maximum  duration  of  placebo  treatment  was 
<=24 weeks compared with a maximum treatment duration of 76 weeks for the FF/VI 100/25 and FF 
100  groups.  Similarly  in  the  FP/salmeterol  integrated  studies  the  duration  of  treatment  with  placebo 
was  shorter  than  active  treatment.  Hence,  results  of  the  integrated  analysis  for  studies  of  <=  24 
weeks (Table 12 and Table 13) and > 24 weeks are also shown.

Table 113.  Summary of Pneumonia Adverse Events (All FF/VI asthma studies ≤ 24 weeks) 
The incidence of pneumonia in the placebo group in the FF/VI asthma integrated analysis was similar 
to the incidence in the ‘Non ICS’ group in the FP/salmeterol asthma integrated analysis. The incidence 
for  the  ‘All  FF  200  containing’  group  was  greater  than  for  the  ‘All  FF  100  containing’  group  but  was 
similar to that seen on the ‘All FP 250 bd containing’ group. 
Serious Pneumonia 
There  were  few  serious  events  of  pneumonia  either  in  the  integration  of  the  FF/VI  studies  or  in  the 
FP/salmeterol integrated studies. There was no evidence of an increased incidence of pneumonia in ‘All 
FF 200 containing’ compared with ‘All FF100 containing,’ with placebo, with FP/salmeterol 250/50 bd or 
FP/salmeterol 500/50 bd. 
Fatal Pneumonia 
One subject, receiving FP/salmeterol 500/50 bd had fatal pneumonia reported as an adverse event and 
fatal pneumonia was one subject reported for one subject receiving FF 100. 
The Applicant has provided during the evaluation ancillary analyses in order to further characterize the 
risk  of  pneumonia  with  FF/VI.  However,  these  analyses  have  methodological  limitations.  On  the  one 
hand,  there  was  not  a  pre-specified  definition  or  adjudication  of  pneumonia  cases  and  its  severity, 
which were subjectively adjudicated by the investigator. As a result, there may be a wide variation in 
pneumonia  rates  depending  on  the  investigators’  personal  criteria,  and  potential  under-reporting 
cannot be ruled out. On the other hand, the integrated analyses and indirect comparisons provided are 
of  limited  validity,  given  the  differences  in  study  populations,  study  durations  and  designs  across 
studies.  Taking  into  account  these  limitations,  the  level  of  uncertainty  surrounding  the  risk  of 
pneumonia with the FDC FF/VI was considered acceptable by the CHMP as pneumonia is a well known 
class effect of ICS and that the magnitude of risk was considered similar to other authorized FDC of an 
ICS and a LABA.

Cardiovascular events 
Cardiovascular  events  are  of  special  concern  in  patient  receiving  LABA.  In  the  COPD  indication  the 
incidence of cardiovascular events adjusted by exposure, was similar for FF/VI treatments (range from 
130.0  to  160.1)  but  higher  for  the  placebo  group  (318.8)  and  FF  monotherapy  group  (range  from 
222.8  to  251).  In  the  asthma  population,  the  incidence  of  cardiovascular  events  (adjusted  by 
exposure)  was  higher  in  the  FF/VI  200/25  group  (154.8/1000  subject  years)  compared  to  FF/VI 
100/25 (65.5), FF 100 (54.1) and FF 200 (76.6). A higher incidence of extrasystoles was seen in the 
FF/VI 200/25 group for the asthma studies.  
Asthma exacerbations 
Asthma  exacerbations  were  also  assessed  as  a  safety  issue.  The  same  definition  for  all  Phase  III 
studies  (deterioration  of  asthma  requiring  the  use  of  systemic  or  oral  corticosteroids  (tablets, 
suspension, or injection) for at least 3 days or an in-patient hospitalization or emergency department 
visit due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids).  
The  Cox  proportional  hazards  analysis  of  time  to  first  on-time  asthma  exacerbation  shows  24% 
reduction  in  risk  of  experience  a  severe  asthma  exacerbation  in  subjects  treated  with  FF/VI  100/25 
compared to FF100 (p=0.01). However, no statistically significant difference was seen with the dose of 
FF/VI 200/25 compared to FF 200 monotherapy. 
A  composite  endpoint  (hospitalisations,  intubation  and  death)  was  assessed  by  the  Applicant 
comparing FF/VI combination groups and VI with non-LABA containing products. Data show that there 
is a similar risk of asthma related events for all arms of treatment.  
Table 114.  Cox  Proportional  Hazards  Analysis  of  Time  to  First  On-Treatment  Asthma 
Exacerbation (Integrated Asthma Clinical Studies, Key Treatment Groups) 
Long-term  safety  was  assessed  in  the  one-year  exacerbation  studies.  The  number  of  subjects 
randomized and who took at least one dose of study medication in these two studies and provided over 
2700  subject-years  of  exposure  which  is  considered  sufficient  according  to  the  ICH  E1  guideline 
”Population Exposure: The Extent of Population Exposure to Assess Clinical Safety” requirements. Data 
on the safety profile for an onset <6 months or > 6months were provided.

For  the  COPD  indication,  the  incidence  of  most  AEs  (SOCs)  was  slightly  higher  in  the  first  6  months. 
The most common AEs were infection and infestations (around 40% in the first 6-month period for the 
recommended posology (FF/VI 100/25).  
Similar findings were observed for the asthma indication.  
Other  AEs  of  special  interest  were  hypersensitivity,  bone  disorders,  bone  fractures,  systemic  steroid 
effects and tremor that had a low incidence (3-0%) in absolute terms and adjusted by exposure. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
For the COPD studies, 11 subjects died in the six month studies and 53 in the one year studies. Thirty 
five  patients died  in  study  HZC102871.  For this indication,  fatal  pneumonias were  particularly  high in 
the FF/VI 200/25 group as well as the number of fatal CV events in the VI containing groups.  
With regard to the asthma studies, only four deaths (pneumonia, lung cancer, car accident and sudden 
death) were reported, none of them were related to treatment.  
Laboratory findings 
The following issues are discussed below: serum glucose and potassium, liver events, laboratory tests 
including (fasting and non-fasting) glucose, potassium, liver function tests etc., hematology tests, 24-
hour urinary and serum cortisol, biochemical markers of bone metabolism, vital signs (heart rate and 
systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure),  ECGs  (QT(F)c,  ECG  heart  rate),  holter  monitoring  and  ocular 
effects.  
Overall, results of laboratory values and physical examination are mainly presented by describing pre-
dose  and  post-dose  values,  their  respective  changes  versus  baseline  and  placebo,  as  well  as  the 
“worst-case”  scenarios  (e.g.  the  maximum  change  for  glucose  and  the  minimum  for  potassium). 
Changes with respect to the normal range of the analyte have also been described. Statistical analyses 
(ANCOVA) have been performed. 
As  stated  by  the  Applicant  there  are  difficulties  in  the  interpretation  of  the  data  due  to  the  different 
lengths of exposure, different timing among studies in sample collection, different patient populations, 
different number of patients available for assessment, etc. 
Blood  samples  were  sent to  central laboratories  and  central  reading  was  performed  for  assessing  the 
risk for QTc prolongation. In addition, clinical concern levels were established a priori for liver function 
tests (LFT) according to the Applicant’s standard liver chemistry stopping criteria that seems to differ 
between phase 3/4 and phase 1/2. These criteria have been detailed for asthma and COPD. 
Serum glucose and potassium 
Hypokalemia and hyperglycaemia are recognized systemic effects with beta2-agonists (usually seen at 
supratherapeutic doses) and corticosteroids (hyperglycemia only) and are generally related to systemic 
exposure.  
Sample collection for glucose measurement were performed both in fasting and non-fasting conditions 
which  makes  difficult  the  interpretation  of  this  particular  parameter.  Only  the  fasting  values  are 
discussed. As in COPD studies pre-dose values were collected in non-fasting conditions while the post-
dose  value  was  collected  in  fasting  conditions  only  changes  in  glucose  in  asthmatic  patients  are 
discussed below. The obvious limitation of this approach is that hyperglycemia is likely to be of more 
relevance for COPD patients given that they are usually older.

Fasting  glucose  was  only  collected  in  five  Integrated  Asthma  Clinical  Studies,  thus  only  five  of  the 
seven key treatment groups are represented. Very few (≤4) subjects in the Placebo + ICS and VI 25 + 
ICS  groups  had  post-baseline  fasting  glucose  measures,  thus  these  groups  are  excluded  from 
discussion of changes from baseline.  
Mean  baseline  values  across  the  key  treatment  groups  were  similar  and  ranged  from  5.05  to  5.18 
mmol/L (see table below). Maximum post-baseline glucose values were increased from baseline in the 
Placebo, FF/VI 100/25 and FF 100 groups; however, mean changes from baseline were small, ranging 
from 0.01 to 0.47 mmol/L.  
Table 115.  Fasting Glucose Data (Integrated Asthma Clinical Studies, Key Treatment 
Groups) 
When  results  are  described  as  change  with  respect  to  the  normal  range  the  FF/VI  100/25  group  had 
the  largest  percentage  of  subjects  with  increases  in  glucose.  However,  it  also  had  the  largest 
percentage of subjects with decreases in glucose (11% vs. 5% for the Placebo and FF 100 groups). 
Serial glucose measurements (fasting) were performed in study HZA106827 (12 weeks, FF/VI 100/25 
OD, FF 100 OD and placebo) pre-dose and at 5-20 minutes (Tmax for VI) post-dose at Week 0 and at 
Week  12.  At  Week  12  (post-dose),  the  mean  change  for  FF/VI  100/25  relative  to  Placebo  was  -0.31 
mmol/L and the mean change for FF 100 was -0.03 mmol/L. The treatment difference between FF/VI 
100/25 and FF 100 was -0.28 (CI: -0.65 to 0.09). 
In the Integrated Asthma Clinical Studies, glucose-related AEs were reported for a total of 20 subjects: 
6 subjects (<1%) in the FF/VI 100/25 group, 4 subjects (<1%) in the FF/VI 200/25 group, 8 subjects 
(<1%) in the FF 100 group and 2 subjects (<1%) in the FF 200 group. None of these were serious or 
led to withdrawal. 
The  analytical  results  above  presented  do  not  suggest  that  the  proposed  dose  of  FF/VI  100/25  is 
associated with substantial changes in serum glucose. However, the lack of fasting glucose data for the 
arms FF/VI 200/25 (integrated analysis) and FF 200 do not permit to assess whether a dose-response 
relationship  exists  although  it  would  appear  that  glucose-related  adverse  events  occurred  only  in 
patients  treated  with  either  the  combination  or  FF  alone.  While  the  recommended  dose  for  patients 
with COPD is FF/VI 100/25 asthmatic patients may receive FF/VI 200/25. Diabetic patients experienced 
higher changes in glucose levels from baseline although such changes were small.

Mean potassium levels at baseline were similar across treatment groups in the two indications studied 
(range in the main safety datasets: 4.46 to 4.53 mmol/l for COPD patients and 5.05 to 5.18 mmol/l in 
asthmatic patients which is slightly above the normal range of 3.5 to 5.0 mol/l). While in patients with 
COPD  no  relevant  findings  on  this  parameter  were  observed  in  asthmatic  patients  minimum  post-
baseline  potassium  values  were  lower  compared  with  baseline  in  all  groups.  However,  mean  changes 
from  baseline  were  minimal  and  ranged  from  -0.24  (FF/VI  100/25)  to  -0.05  mmol/L  (VI  25+ICS).  
Changes from baseline to low (with respect to the normal range) were observed in a low percentage of 
patients.  
In  Study  B2C109575  (dosing  ranging  study  for  vilanterol)  no  statistically  significant  changes  from 
baseline (0-4 h) statistically significant maximum mean decreases of -0.14 mmol/L from baseline were 
observed  for  both  the  VI  6.25  and  VI  50  groups  compared  with  Placebo  on  Day  28.  However,  no 
statistically significant differences vs. placebo were seen for the remaining groups of VI (VI 3, VI 12.5, 
or VI 25).      
A  single  AE  of  hypokalemia  was  reported  for  one  subject  (FF  100  group)  in  the  Integrated  Asthma 
Clinical Studies, an. This AE was not serious and did not lead to withdrawal. 
Liver events 
Overall,  in  the  respective  main  safety  datasets  elevated  Liver  Function  Tests  of  potential  clinical 
concern  were  reported  while  on  treatment  for  5  patients  (COPD)  and  for  13  asthmatic  patients.  The 
narratives  provided  show  that  for  some  of  them  underlying  chronic  hepatitis  C,  concomitant 
medications etc. may explain this increase.  
24-hour urinary cortisol excretion/serum cortisol  
Interpretation of urinary cortisol excretion values is difficult due to the high variability of this measure 
(coefficient of variation higher than 70% for the geometric mean values).  
In  the  six  month  COPD  studies  the  day  168  to  baseline  ratio  for  geometric  mean  values  of  urinary 
cortisol was 0.96 on placebo, 0.92 on FF/VI 50/25, 1.07 on FF/VI 100/25, 0.99 on FF/VI 200/25, 0.90 
on VI 25, 0.84 on FF 100 and 0.89 on FF 200.  
The  statistical  analysis  of  the  24-hour  urinary  cortisol  excretion  data  did  not  show  statistically 
significant  differences  from  placebo  for  all  active  treatment  groups.  The  adjusted  geometric  mean 
urinary cortisol ratios to baseline ranged from a 12% decrease for the FF 100 group to a 1% increase 
for  the  FF/VI  100/25  group.  There  were  also  no  statistically  significant  differences  in  24-hour  urinary 
cortisol excretion between the FF/VI 100/25 group and the FF 100 group, the FF/VI 200/25 group and 
the  FF  200  group,  nor  were  there  any  statistically  significant  differences  between  any  FF/VI 
combination  group  and  the  VI  25 group.  The  figure  below  graphically  depicts  the least  squares  mean 
ratios from placebo in urinary cortisol excretion at Day 168 for the active treatment groups.

Some  evidence  of  dose-dependency  is  observed  in  study  HZC110946  (cross-over,  28-day  period) 
where  the  geometric  mean  for  weighted  mean  serum  cortisol  levels  for  the  FF/VI  200/25  mcg 
treatment was lower (168.8 nmol/L) than placebo (189.1 nmol/L) and the remaining treatment groups 
(FF/VI 50/25 mcg: 181.2 nmol/L and FF/VI 100/25 mcg: 185.9 nmol/L).  
In asthmatic patients urinary cortisol excretion was log transformed and analyzed on the Urine Cortisol 
(UC) Population (a subset of the ITT population whose urine samples did not have confounding factors 
that would affect the interpretation of results). 
Geometric means for 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion at baseline and end of treatment and the ratio 
to baseline are shown in the table below.

In  studies  addressing  morning  (AM)  vs.  evening  (PM)  dosing  (FFA20001  and  FFA106783)  a  17% 
reduction  in  the  FP  250  PM  group  in  study  FFA20001  was  observed  relative  to  Placebo,  which  was 
statistically significant while there were no statistically significant reductions in 24-hour urinary cortisol 
excretion in either of the FF 100 groups relative to Placebo (ratios = 0.99 and 0.95 for FF 100 AM and 
PM respectively). In Study FFA106783, there were no statistically significant reductions in any of the FF 
treatment  groups  relative  to  Placebo  (ratios  =  0.90  to  1.19).  The  24-hour  urinary  cortisol  excretion 
ratios (Week 8/Baseline) for all FF treatments (range 0.78 to 1.03) were comparable to Placebo (0.87).  
In  study  FFA112202  (addressing  once  vs.  twice  daily  dosing)  the  24-hour  urinary  cortisol  excretion 
ratios  (Day  28/Baseline)  for  the  FF  groups  (0.61  and  0.68  for  the  200  OD  and  the  100  BD  groups, 
respectively) were lower compared with Placebo (0.82) and the FP groups (0.84 and 0.73 for the 200 
OD  and  the  100  BD,  respectively).  When  the  active  treatment  groups  were  compared  with  Placebo, 
there  was  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  the  active  versus  Placebo  ratio  for  both  FF  groups, 
while there was no statistically significant difference in the active versus Placebo ratio for the FP groups 
(see table below).

Clinical chemistry  
Changes  form  baseline  in  clinical  chemistry  values  revealed  that  most  patients  remained  within  the 
normal  range  or  had  no  changes  from  baseline  with  respect  to  the  normal  range.  Liver  events  (the 
CHMP’s  understanding  is  that  these  liver  events  refer  to  clusters  of  increases  in  liver  enzymes  that 
would suggest liver disease) have been previously discussed.  
Hematology  
Similarly  to  above,  most  patients  remained  within  the  normal  range  or  had  no  change  from  baseline 
with respect to the normal range in hematology values. There were not remarkable findings on these 
parameters.  
Biochemical markers of bone metabolism  
Biochemical  markers  of  bone  metabolism  were  determined  in  study  HZ102871  (1-year  exacerbation 
study  in  patients  with  COPD).  The  FF/VI  200/25  group  showed  a  statistically  significance  decrease  of 
9% in osteocalcin (a marker of bone formation) which, in the Applicant’s opinion, is not thought to be 
clinically  relevant.  Decreased  bone  mineral  density  and  associated  fractures  has  been  included  as  an 
important potential risk in the RMP.

Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate) 
Heart rate was recorded as part of the normal physical assessment as well as in ECG. In COPD patients 
pulse  rate  was  recorded  pre-dose  and  10-minute  post-dose  and  no  clinically  remarkable  differences 
across  the  treatment  groups  were  seen  although  in  the  one-year  exacerbation  studies  all  treatments 
included VI making difficult the assessment of LABA-related effects.  
ECG  heart  rate  values  repeated  measures  analysis  showed  few  statistically  significant  differences  at 
any  timepoint  for  heart  rate,  i.e.  the  difference  vs.  placebo  in  the  10-min  post-dose  ECG  heart  rate 
reached  statistical  significance  in  the  FF/VI  100,25,  FF/VI  200/25  and  VI  25  groups.  However,  these 
differences, in the range of 1 to 2 bpm, were not considered clinically important.  
The  expected  (increased)  effect  of  vilanterol  on  pulse  rate  was  more  evident  in  asthmatic  patients 
where  the  post-dose  measurement  was  apparently  performed  at  30  minutes  (Tmax  for  VI).  Mean 
change from baseline in trough (pre-dose) pulse rate ranged from 5.9 bpm in the Placebo group to 8.1 
bpm in the FF/VI 100/25 group. Mean change from baseline in 0-30 minute post-dose pulse rate was 
slightly  higher  than  trough  pulse  rate  and  ranged  from  4.6  bpm  in  the  Placebo  +  ICS  group  to  10.1 
bpm in the FF/VI 100/25 group. 
In study B2C109575 (VI dose finding), the statistical analysis showed that difference from Placebo for 
mean maximum increase from baseline in pulse rate was significant for the VI 50 group on Day 28 (2.7 
bpm, p=0.026) suggesting dose-dependency.  
In asthmatic patients in study B2C112060 (VI 25 vs. SALM 100 with Placebo, all with concurrent ICS) 
mean changes from baseline at 0-30 minutes post-dose in heart rate (ECG) were larger than at trough. 
and the VI 25 + ICS group (7.6 bpm).  
In  asthmatic  patients  mean  values  for  trough  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  at  screening  and 
baseline were generally similar across the key treatment groups.  Analyses of post-baseline values (30 
minutes  post-dose)  show  that  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  0-30  minute  postdose  systolic  and 
diastolic  blood  pressure  were  similar  to  trough  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  and  ranged  from 
5.1  mmHg  in  the  VI  25  +  ICS  group  to  10.0  mmHg  in  the  FF/VI  100/25  group  for  systolic  blood 
pressure and -8.8 mmHg in the FF/VI 100/25 and FF/VI 200/25 groups to -5.4 mmHg in the Placebo + 
ICS  group  for  diastolic  blood  pressure.  In  spite  of  the  fact  that  in  the  statistical  analysis  none  of  the 
treatment  comparisons  for  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  were  statistically  significant  both  the 
magnitude of the increase seen in systolic blood pressure and the decrease in diastolic blood pressure 
are of concern. Analysis of pre-dose and 10 minute post-dose systolic and diastolic blood pressure in 
COPD patients showed, overall, little changes. The notable increase in SBP and decrease in DBP seen in 
studies  B2C109575  and  HZA106839  are  related  with  the  time  when  blood  pressure  was  measured 
which  is  probably  correlated  with  the  maximum  effect  of  VI.  There  were  no  differences  in  adverse 
events exposure-adjusted associated with hypertension between FF/VI and comparator treatments. 
In  conclusion,  vilanterol  (either  alone  or  in  combination)  is  associated  with  an  increase  in  heart  rate 
that  seems  more  evident  at  30  minute  post-dose.    The  magnitude  of  the  increase  in  heart  rate  after 
dosing  is  around  5  to  10  bpm.  Increases  in  systolic  blood  pressure  have  been  described  for  other 
beta2-agonist  mainly  at  higher  doses.  While  for  most  of  the  lab  values  and  vital  signs  discussed 
changes  are  either  of  small  size  or  in  the  range  described  for  other  beta2-agonists  the  magnitude  of 
the changes in blood pressure in asthmatic patients are difficult to understand.

Electrocardiograms 
In  the  6-month  lung  function  studies  in  COPD,  twelve-lead  ECGs  were  conducted  for  all  subjects  at 
Screening, Day 1 (pre- and 10min post-dose), Day 84 (pre- and 10min post-dose) and Day 168 in the 
six-month  lung  function  studies  in  COPD.  In  addition  to  the  ECGs,  twenty-four-hour  12-lead  Holter 
monitoring  was  obtained  in  a  subset  of  approximately  half  of  the  subjects  in  each  treatment  arm 
(Holter  Population)  at  selected  sites  in  6-month  lung  function  studies  in  COPD.  Each  ECG/Holter  was 
reviewed by a team of centralized cardiologist over-readers who reported individual findings that were 
observed  on  the  ECG/Holter.  A  total  of  2254  patients  had  ECG  available  and  1016  had  a  Holter 
available.  During  these  studies,  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  were  found  across  treatment 
groups  (placebo,  FF/VI  combination  or  VI  and  FF  alone)  for    mean  QTc(F)  or  percentage  of  subjects 
with  QTc(F)  values  ≤450,  >450  to  ≤480,  >480  to  ≤500,  and  >500  msec.  Regarding  ECG  heart  rate 
values repeated measures, maximum mean differences were in the range of  1 to 2 bpm, which were 
not  considered  clinically  important.  In  COPD,  the  most  common  abnormalities  of  potential  clinical 
importance  prior  to  dosing  were  depolarization  abnormalities  and  most  commonly  were  right  bundle 
branch block or partial bundle branch block, which is within expected for an old COPD population with 
concomitant diseases. There were also a number of subjects across the treatment groups for whom old 
myocardial  infarction  was  detected.  The  FF/VI  200/25  group  had  the  highest  percentage  of  subjects 
with  abnormalities  of  potential  clinical  importance  at  baseline  (16%),  and  this  percentage  did  not 
increase at any time post-baseline. More frequent Holter abnormalities of potential clinical importance 
were ventricular ectopics (extrasystoles) and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, which occurred at 
similar incidence in the FF/VI combination groups compared with placebo, the VI 25 group and the FF 
100 group. 
In  the  one-year  COPD  exacerbation  studies,  twelve-lead  ECGs  were  conducted  for  all  subjects  at 
Screening, Week 12, Week 28 and Week 52. A total of 3255 patients had ECG available. The results for 
QTc(F) values and ECG heart rate were similar to those discussed above for the 6-month studies. 
The Integrated Asthma Clinical Studies included the analysis of 1001 subjects with available ECGs. The 
results  for  QTc(F)  values  and  ECG  heart  rate  were  similar  to  those  discussed  above.  In  addition,  in 
study  B2C112060,  which  compared  VI  25  and  SALM  100  with  Placebo  (all  with  concurrent  ICS).  the 
incidence  of  ECG  abnormalities  of  clinical  importance  at  any  time  post-baseline  was  similar  to 
screening  in  each  treatment  group  (5%,  3%,  and  5%,  respectively)  and  changes  in  mean  heart  rate 
from baseline were <5 bpm in all groups, and similar between the VI 25 (3.4 bpm) and SALM 100 (3.8 
bpm)  groups.  Therefore,  no  apparent  treatment-related  changes  on  ECG  findings  or  pulse  rate  were 
observed  between  VI  and  salmeterol.  Finally,  in  Study  HZA106839,  24-hour  Holter  monitoring  was 
performed in a subset of subjects (≥50% in each treatment group: FF/VI 100/25 OD, FF/VI 200/25 OD 
and FP 500 BID) at screening, Day 1, Week 28 and Week 52. At screening, there was an imbalance in 
the proportion of subjects with >50 VEs (any type  of VE) in the FF/VI groups (10%, 16%) compared 
with the FP group (4%). In all three treatment groups, the proportion of subjects having >50 VEs (any 
type),  ≥1  ventricular  singlet,  and  ≥1  ventricular  couplet  at  the  post-baseline  visits,  as  well  as  the 
maximum number of VEs, were similar to those observed at screening.

In summary, no major issues arise from the ECG/Holter assessment during COPD and asthma studies. 
The more frequent ECG/Holter abnormalities found are well related to beta-agonists (e.g.: tachycardia 
and  extrasystoles)  or  are  present  in  the  target  population  (partial  bundle  branch  block  in  COPD 
patients with concomitant heart disease at baseline). Data from study B2C112060, suggest that there 
are  no  apparent  treatment-related  changes  on  ECG  findings  or  pulse  rate  between  VI  25  and  SALM 
100.  
Ocular effects 
Low  incidence  (<1%)  of  ocular  effects  was  reported  for  the  combination  in  the  four  primary  COPD 
studies. Similar numbers were recorded in asthma studies. In order to avoid the confounding effect of 
age a comprehensive ocular examination was conducted in asthmatic patients exposed to FF/VI (or FP) 
for  one  year.  No  significant  differences  were  observed  in  comparison  with  ocular  effects  reported  for 
inhaled fluticasone propionate.  
Safety in special populations 
COPD 
•  Gender: Overall, in the four primary COPD studies female subjects reported a higher percentage of 
any  AE  compared  with  the  ITT  Population,  and  this  increased  incidence  of  AEs  in  female  subjects 
was seen across most SOC categories. 
•  Age: Overall, the incidence of AEs was similar to the ITT Population across all age categories. 
•  Pneumonia: Overall, subjects with a history of pneumonia compared with subjects with no history of 
pneumonia had a higher incidence of any AE. 
•  Geographical  region:  Subjects  from  the  European  Union  tended  to  report  a  lower  incidence  of  any 
AE compared with the subjects in the US and in the “Other” region. 
•  There  was  no  indication  of  a  difference  in  the  incidence  of  any  AE  based  on  reversibility,  percent 
predicted FEV1 (GOLD subgroups), smoking or cardiovascular history/risk factors. 
Asthma 
The  safety  profile  of  FF/VI  in  asthma  patients  does  not  seem  to  be  modified  by  age.  Gender  and 
geographical  regions  were  apparently  the  most  relevant  factors.  Females  and  USA  patients  showed a 
worse  safety  profile  than  males  and  European  subjects.  A  similar  behaviour  was  also  observed  for 
placebo  and  each  compound  this  does  not  seem  to  represent  a  matter  of  concern  for  FF/VI.  Other 
factors such as race are strongly influenced by the numbers.

Table 118.  Incidence  of  Adverse  Events  by  Subgroup  (Integrated  Asthma  Clinical  Studies, 
Key Treatment Groups) 
The number of asthmatic adolescents and elderly, as already stated, is quite limited. As no assessment 
of  growth  has  been  performed  in  the  adolescent  population  it  has  been  included  in  the  RMP  as  an 
important potential risk.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Two  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  studies  with  concomitant  administration  of  ketoconazole 
in  healthy  subjects  have  been  conducted.  The  most  significant  finding  was  the  increase  of  QTc  (7.55 
msec)  after  FF/VI  200/25  with  ketoconazole  compared  with  the  administration  of  placebo.  Other 
common  adverse  event  was  headache  and  nausea  reported  more  frequently  with  FF/VI  200/25  and 
ketoconazole  than  FF/VI  200/25  plus  placebo.  As  mentioned  in  the  PK  section,  an  increase  in  the 
exposure  for  FF  and  VI  is  observed  with  the  concomitant  administration  of  ketoconazole  and, 
subsequently,  a  reduction  on  serum  cortisol.  This  reduction  could  not  be  considered  negligible  in 
patients with hepatic impairment.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
For the COPD indication the treatment group for which more subjects discontinued the study drug was 
FF  100  (9%)  compared  with  8%  in  FF/VI  100/25  and  200/25  group.  Again,  infections  and  cardiac 
disorders are the most common events leading to discontinuation.  
For  the  asthma  indication  there  was  a  2%  of  withdrawal  in  the  Integrated  Asthma  Clinical  Studies 
similar  percentage  the  other  treatments.  The  most  common  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were 
asthma exacerbation and dysphonia (3 subjects each) for FF/VI 100/25 group.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 17109 subjects were treated with the FF/VI FDC in clinical studies in the treatment of asthma 
or COPD. A total of 1867 subjects were treated with FF/VI for more than 48 weeks, and 686 subjects 
were treated with FF/VI for more than 52 weeks. The size of the safety database and the duration of 
exposure are considered sufficient for the evaluation of the most frequent AEs of the FF/VI FDC. 
The  most  frequent  AEs  reported  in  both  the  COPD  and  the  asthma  studies  were  headache, 
nasopharyngitis  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infections,  with  similar  incidences  in  both  populations. 
When  exposure-adjusted  numbers  are  considered,  nasopharingitis,  upper  respiratory  tract  infections 
and  headache  were  the  most  frequently  reported  adverse  events.  Similar  numbers  were  observed  in 
the asthma studies. This is in line with what is observed for FDC of an ICS and a LABA.  
A  total  of  11  deaths  were  reported  in  the  six  month  COPD  studies  and  53  deaths  in  the  one  year 
studies.  Of  note  thirty  five  patients  deaths  were  reported  in  the  52  weeks  exacerbation  study 
HZC102871.  For  the  COPD  indication,  fatal  pneumonias  were  particularly  high  in  the  FF/VI  200/25 
group  as  well  as  the  number  of  fatal  CV  events  in  the  VI  containing  groups.  Only  four  deaths 
(pneumonia, lung cancer,  car accident and sudden death) were reported in the asthma studies, none 
of them were related to treatment.  
The  observed  incidence of  pneumonia  was  around  6%  across  the  FF/VI  groups  compared  with  3% in 
the  VI  25  group,  <1%  in  the  placebo  and  FF  groups.  However,  when  data  are  discussed  as  subjects 
with  an  event/1000  treatment  years,  the  FF/VI  200/25  group  has  the  worst  numbers  for  pneumonia 
(76.7  in  the  FF/VI  200/25  group  and  68.2  in  the  FF/VI  100/25  vs.  18  for  placebo).  For  severe 
pneumonia these figures were as follows: 32.5, 22.7 and 0, respectively while for serious pneumonia 
the  following  have  been  reported:  33.8  for  FF/VI  200/25  and  6  for  placebo).  Finally,  the  exposure-
adjusted numbers of subjects with fatal pneumonia are as follows: 7.8 for FF/VI 200/25 versus 1.2 for 
FF/VI 100/25 and 0 for the rest of groups. This is a concern although the highest dose (FF/VI 200/25) 
is not recommended in COPD. A potential similar effect on asthma patients for whom the FF/VI 200/25 
dosage  can  be  used,  cannot  be  ruled  out.  The  Applicant  has  provided  during  the  evaluation  ancillary 
analyses  in  order  to  further  characterize  the  risk  of  pneumonia  with  FF/VI.  However  these  analyses 
have  methodological  limitations.  On  the  one  hand,  there  was  not  a  pre-specified  definition  or 
adjudication  of  pneumonia  cases  and  its  severity,  which  were  subjectively  adjudicated  by  the 
investigator.  As  a  result,  there  may  be  a  wide  variation  in  pneumonia  rates  depending  on  the 
investigators’ personal criteria, and potential under-reporting cannot be ruled out. On the other hand, 
the integrated analyses and indirect comparisons provided are of limited validity, given the differences 
in study populations, study durations and designs across studies. Taking into account these limitations, 
the  level  of  uncertainty  surrounding  the  risk  of  pneumonia  with  the  FDC  FF/VI  was  considered 
acceptable  by the  CHMP  as  pneumonia  is  a  well  known  class  effect  of  ICS  and  that the  magnitude of 
risk was considered similar to other authorized FDC of an ICS and a LABA. In section 4.2 of the SmPC 
it  is  stated  that  the  highest  strength  is  not  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  COPD  and  a  warning  is 
included  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  and  pneumonia  is  included  as  an  important  identified  risk  in  the 
RMP. Pneumonia will be further characterized in ongoing and future studies and by continual proactive 
Pharmacovigilance activities as described in the RMP. In addition the CHMP requested the Applicant to 
conduct two post-authorisation safety studies (one for the COPD and one for the asthma indication) to 
further  investigate  this  risk  of  pneumonia  with  FF/VI  compared  with  other  ICS/LABA  FDCs  (as 
described in the RMP).

A higher incidence of cardiocascular events was seen in the FF/VI 200/25 group for the asthma studies 
related  with  a  higher  incidence  of  extrasystoles.  Cardiovascular  events,  and  particularly  tachycardia, 
are known AEs related to LABA products. A warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC and 
serious  cardiovascular  events  has  been  included  as  an  important  potential  risk  in  the  RMP.  Serious 
cardiovascular  events  will  be  further  characterized  in  the  SUMMIT  study  and  by  continual  proactive 
Pharmacovigilance activities as described in the RMP. 
For  asthma  exacerbations  the  same  definition  was  used  throughout  all  Phase  III  studies.  A  24% 
reduction  in  risk  of  experience  a  severe  asthma  exacerbation  in  subjects  treated  with  FF/VI  100/25 
compared  to  FF100  was  observed  (p=0.01).  However,  no  statistically  significant  difference  was  seen 
with  the  dose  of  FF/VI  200/25  compared  to  FF  200  monotherapy.  Using  a  composite  endpoint  of 
hospitalisations,  intubation  and  death,  a  similar  risk  of  asthma  related  events  was  observed  when 
comparing FF/VI groups versus non LABA-containing products.  
For  the  COPD  indication,  the  incidence  of  most  AEs  (SOCs)  was  slightly  higher  in  the  first  6  months. 
The most common AEs were infection and infestations (around 40% in the first 6-month period for the 
recommended  posology  (FF/VI  100/25).  Similar  findings  were  observed  for  the  asthma  indication. 
Other  AEs  of  special  interest  were  hypersensitivity,  bone  disorders,  bone  fractures,  systemic  steroid 
effects  and  tremor  that  had  a  low  incidence  (3-0%)  in  absolute  terms  and  adjusted  by  exposure. 
Consistent  with  other  corticosteroid  products  already  authorised,  a  warning  has  been  included  in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC regarding the risk of hyperglycaemia in diabetic patients. The Applicant overall 
conclusion  is  that  there  is  little  evidence  in  the  main  safety  datasets  showing  a  treatment  effect  on 
cortisol. A dose-dependent effect is not either clearly seen in the main integrated analyses. What it is 
not discussed is the apparent lack of consistency in some results within and between studies when the 
same  dose  of  FF  is  compared  as  part  of  the  combination  with  the  monocomponents.  The  absence  of 
dose-dependency  is  somehow  worrisome  as  a  certain  degree  of  dose-dependent  effect  is  expected 
casting doubts on the quality of the data. Some of the data presented show that FF 200 is associated 
with  a  higher  risk  of  cortisol  disturbance.  In  addition,  higher  doses  administered  once  daily  seem  to 
cause a higher decrease in urinary cortisol than twice daily dosing. Whether urinary cortisol excretion 
is  more  affected  by  dosing  in  the  morning  or  in  the  evening  is  not  entirely  clear  as  there  were  no 
statistical  significant  differences  between  FF  100  administered  either  AM  or  PM  vs.  placebo.  The  ratio 
vs. baseline were 0.99 for AM dosing and 0.95 for PM dosing. The fact that FP 250 PM caused a 17% 
reduction versus placebo suggests that PM dosing is more likely to affect cortisol levels. Although the 
magnitude  of  the  decrease  in  urinary  cortisol  is  somehow  limited  a  warning  has  been  included  in 
section  4.4  of the  SmPC  and  adrenal  suppression  has  been  included  as  an  important  potential  risk  in 
the  RMP.  Corticosteroid  associated  eye  disorders  has  been  included  as  an  important  potential  risk  in 
the RMP and will be further characterized in the SUMMIT study as described in the RMP. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the size of the safety database and the duration of exposure are considered sufficient for the 
evaluation  of  the  most  frequent  AEs  of  the  FF/VI  FDC,  which  are  in  line  with  the  one  reported  in 
authorised ICS/LABA FDC.  
Concerning cardiovascular events, a higher incidence was seen in the FF/VI 200/25 group for the 
asthma studies related with a higher incidence of extrasystoles. Cardiovascular events, and particularly 
tachycardia, are known AEs related to LABA products.

Concerning  the  risk  of  pneumonia,  the  data  provided  did  not  allow  to  fully  characterize  the  risk 
associated with FF/VI. To address this concern, in section 4.2 of the SmPC it is stated that the highest 
strength is not indicated for the treatment of COPD and a warning has been included in section 4.4 of 
the  SmPC  and  pneumonia  is  identified  as  an  important  risk  in  the  RMP.  In  addition  the  CHMP  has 
imposed a requirement on the Applicant to conduct two post-authorisation interventional safety studies 
(one for the COPD and one for the asthma indication) to further investigate this risk of pneumonia with 
FF/VI  compared  with  other  ICS/LABA  FDCs  (as  described  in  the  RMP).  The  risk  of  pneumonia  will  be 
further characterized in ongoing and planned studies as described in the RMP. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements. 
It  is  recommended  that,  when  available,  the  PSMF  number  assigned  by  the  extended  EudraVigilance 
Medicinal Product Dictionary (XEVMPD) should be included in the statement. 
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
Based  on  the  PRAC  review  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan  version  5.0,  the  PRAC  considers  by 
consensus  that  the  risk  management  system  for  fluticasone  furoate/vilanterol  trifenatate  (Relvar 
Ellipta) in the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, where 
use  of  a  combination  product  (long-acting  beta2-agonist  and  inhaled  corticosteroid)  is  appropriate 
(patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and “as needed” inhaled short acting 
beta2-agonists)  and  for  the  symptomatic  treatment  of  patients  with  COPD  with  a  FEV1  <70% 
predicted  normal  (post-bronchodilator)  in  patients  with  an  exacerbation  history  despite  regular 
bronchodilator therapy, is acceptable. 
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

*Category 1 are imposed activities considered key to the benefit risk of the product. 
Category 2 are specific obligations 
Category 3 are required additional PhV activity (to address specific safety concerns or to measure effectiveness of risk minimisation measures) 
The  PRAC,  having  considered  the  data  submitted,  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  proposed  post-
authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.  
Some  minor  changes  should  be  included  in  the  full  protocol  of  Salford  COPD  and  Salford  asthma 
studies  that  should  be  submitted  for  assessment  no  later  than  1  month  following  the  Commission 
Decision: 
• 
Regarding  both  protocols:  Although  the  codes  and  the  diagnostic  criteria  of  pneumonia  have 
been provided, the procedure for the validation of diagnosis including possible external reviewers is not 
clear described. This point should be included in the full protocols. 
• 
Regarding  asthma  study:  demographic 
information,  collected  clinical  and 
laboratory 
information  and  the  FF/VI  dose  should  be  incorporated  in  the  assessment  of  each  episode  of 
pneumonia to evaluate risk factors and effect modifiers similarly to COPD study.  
According  to  the  Applicant  no  formal  statistical  analysis  is  planned  due  to  low  event  rate  and  lack  of 
statistical power for this study. Although it is accepted, detailed analysis of the lack of statistical power 
should be provided together with an exploratory analysis on the risk of pneumonia. These data should 
be part of the full protocol and included in the statistical analysis plan. 
The  PRAC  also  considered  that  routine  PhV  is  sufficient  to  monitor  the  effectiveness  of  the  risk 
minimisation measures.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that: 
The proposed routine risk minimisation measures are considered sufficient to minimise the risks of the 
product in the proposed indications. 
However the descriptions of the safety concerns in the next update should be the same than described 
in section 1 (ie fracture). 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.  
Following the PRAC advice, the Applicant submitted a revised version 6.0 of the RMP specifying that 
the revised protocols of the Salford COPD and Salford asthma studies will be submitted within one 
month of issue of the Commision Decision. The RMP version 6.0 was considered acceptable.

Beneficial effects 
Asthma 
The  design  of  the  clinical  trials  in  asthma  (studies  HZA106827,  HZA106829  and  HZA106837)  is 
adequate.  
For  the  low  dose  of  FF/VI  (100/25  µg)  in  study  HZA106827  statistically  significant  differences  in  the 
two  co-primary  endpoints  change  from  baseline  in  trough  FEV1  and  mean  FEV1  at  week  12  versus 
placebo (0.172 and 0.302 respectively) were observed. In addition statistically significant differences in 
secondary  efficacy  endpoints  (rescue  free  and  symptoms  free  24h  periods)  versus  placebo  were  also 
observed.  These  effects  observed  with  the  FF/VI  100/25  dose  are  similar  to  the  one  obtained  with 
other  LABA/ICS  combinations.  In  addition  the  risk  of  experiencing  a  severe  asthma  exacerbation  was 
decreased  by  20%  compared  with  FF  100  alone  (hazard  ratio  =  0.795,  p  =  0.036  95%  CI  (0.642; 
0.985)  and  the  rate  of  severe  asthma  exacerbations  was  decreased  by  25%  compared  with  FF  100 
alone (p = 0.014) in study HZA106837. 
For the high dose of FF/VI (200/25) in study HZA106829 statistically significant differences in the two 
co-primary endpoints change from baseline in trough FEV1 and mean FEV1 at week 12 versus FF 200 
and FP 1000 were obtained in study HZA106829. The differences achieved on lung function parameters 
were greater with the high dose than with the low dose (0.193 and 0.136 for FF/VI 200/25 versus FF 
200  and  0.036  and  0.116  for  FF/VI  100/25  versus  FF  100  respectively  for  the  two  co-primary 
endpoints).  In  addition,  statistically  significant  differences  in  the  secondary  endpoint  rescue-free  24h 
periods  versus  FF  200  were  also  observed.  These  effects  observed  with  the  FF/VI  200/25  dose  are 
similar to the one obtained with other LABA/ICS combinations.  
COPD 
Pivotal  studies  with  FF/VI  in  COPD  (studies  HZC112206,  HZC112207,  HZC102781  and  HZC102970) 
were generally well conducted. 
In  the  6-month  pivotal  studies  (studies  HZC112206  and  HZC112207),  for  FF/VI  100/25,  statistically 
significant improvements in the co-primary endpoints weighted mean FEV1 0-4 hours at Day 168 and 
change  from  baseline  in  pre-dose  trough  FEV1  at  D169  were  observed  versus  placebo  (respectively 
0.173  and 0.115 in  study HZC112206  and  0.214  and  0.144  in  study  HZC112207)  and  versus  FF  100 
alone (respectively 0.120 and 0.082 in study HZC112206 and 0.168 and 0.100 in study HZC112207). 
In  addition,  a  responder  analysis  for  CRQ-SAS  Dyspnea  scores  showed  that  the  odds  of  being  a 
responder was between 1.67 and 2.03 times greater with FF/VI 100/25 than with placebo. In addition, 
statistically significant improvements with FF/VI 100/25 versus placebo for the secondary endpoints of 
COPD  symptoms  scores  and  the  number  of  night-time  awakenings  requiring  rescue  medication 
(salbutamol), while a post-hoc analysis of total rescue-free days showed that FF/VI 100/25 provided a 
higher  percentage  of  salbutamol-free  days  (19%  and  14%  difference  versus  placebo  in  study 
HZC112206 and in study HZC112207 respectively).

In  the  one-year  pivotal  studies  (studies  HZC102970  and  HZC102871),  treatment  with  FF/VI  100/25 
provided  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  the  primary  endpoint  LS  mean  annual  rate  of 
moderate and severe exacerbations compared with VI 25 (between 21% and 34% reduction in each of 
the  studies).  For  the  secondary  endpoint  time  to  first  exacerbation  and  moderate  exacerbations 
requiring  treatment  with  oral/systemic  corticosteroids,  treatment  with  FF/VI  100/25  provided  a 
statistically  significant  reduction  versus  VI  25  alone  for  both  one-year  studies.  These  results  are 
consistent with those observed for the main exacerbation outcome.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Asthma 
For  the  low  dose  of  FF/VI  (100/25  µg)  in  study  HZA106827  the  results  failed  to  show  statistically 
significant  differences  between  FF/VI  and  FF  monotherapy  on  relevant  lung  function  parameters  and 
small effects of the FF/VI on symptomatic endpoints versus FF monotherapy were observed. Neither FF 
nor VI are currently authorised as mono component for the treatment of asthma. However the effects 
observed  on  pulmonary  function  parameters  and  symptomatic  endpoints  with  FF/VI  100/25  are 
considered  clinically  relevant  and  consistent  with  the  literature  data  available  for  clinical  trials  with 
other approved FDC of an ICS and a LABA for the treatment of asthma.  
The  number  of  adolescents  and  patients  aged  >65  years  included  was  too  small  to  allow  statistical 
analysis  for  most  treatment  groups.  But  in  an  integrated  analysis  a  numerical  benefit  of  FF/VI  over 
placebo and FF alone was observed on both aged groups at Week 2, Week 12 and Week 24. 
COPD 
In the 6-month pivotal studies (studies HZC112206 and HZC112207), for FF/VI 100/25, no statistically 
significant improvements in the co-primary endpoints weighted mean FEV1 0-4 hours at Day 168 and 
change from baseline in pre-dose trough FEv1 at D169 were observed versus VI 25 alone. However, a 
statistically significant improvements with FF/VI 100/25 versus placebo for the secondary endpoints of 
COPD  symptoms  scores  and  the  number  of  night-time  awakenings  requiring  rescue  medication 
(salbutamol), while a post-hoc analysis of total rescue-free days showed that FF/VI 100/25 provided a 
higher  percentage  of  salbutamol-free  days  (19%  and  14%  difference  versus  placebo  in  study 
HZC112206  and  in  study  HZC112207  respectively).  In  addition,  there  was  a  lack  of  statistically 
significant  effect  of  FF/VI  100/25  versus  placebo  in  mean  CRQ-SAS  Dyspnoea  Domain  scores  in  both 
studies  HZC112206  and  HZC112207.  However  a  responder  analysis  for  CRQ-SAS  Dyspnea  scores 
showed  that  the  odds  of  being  a  responder  was  between  1.67  and  2.03  times  greater  with  FF/VI 
100/25 than with placebo. 
In  the  one-year  pivotal  studies  (studies  HZC102970  and  HZC102871),  there  was  a  lack  of  dose-
response between the three doses of FF/VI studied in annual rate of moderate/severe exacerbations in 
the with a differential effect of the FF/VI 200/25 dose in each of the studies (more prominent in study 
HZC102970 than in study HZC102871). However for the secondary endpoint time to first exacerbation 
and  moderate  exacerbations  requiring  treatment  with  oral/systemic  corticosteroids,  treatment  with 
FF/VI 100/25 provided a statistically significant reduction versus VI 25 alone for both one-year studies. 
These results are consistent with those observed for the main exacerbation outcome. Neither FF nor VI 
are  currently  authorised  as  mono  component  for  the  treatment  of  COPD.  The  CHMP  however 
considered that the active control group chosen in the 6-month and 1-year pivotal studies (VI 25 µg), 
despite  not  corresponding  to  a  LABA  currently  authorised  for  use  in  patients  with  COPD,  was  an 
acceptable comparator, and that the 25 VI dose selected was appropriate.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In  general  the  most  frequent  AEs  observed  with  FF/VI  in  the  treatment  of  asthma  and  COPD 
(headache, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections) are in line with the one reported in 
authorised ICS/LABA FDC.  
For  the  COPD  indication,  the  incidence  of  most  AEs  (SOCs)  was  slightly  higher  in  the  first  6  months. 
The most common AEs were infection and infestations (around 40% in the first 6-month period for the 
recommended  posology  (FF/VI  100/25).  Similar  findings  were  observed  for  the  asthma  indication. 
Other  AEs  of  special  interest  were  hypersensitivity,  bone  disorders,  bone  fractures,  systemic  steroid 
effects and tremor that had a low incidence (3-0%) in absolute terms and adjusted by exposure. 
A  higher  risk  of  cortisol  disturbance  (urinary  cortisol)  was  observed  with  the  FF/VI  200/25  dose.  In 
addition, higher doses administered once daily seem to cause a higher decrease in urinary cortisol than 
twice daily dosing.  
A higher incidence of cardiocascular events was seen in the FF/VI 200/25 group for the asthma studies 
related with a higher incidence of extrasystoles. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The  observed  incidence of  pneumonia  was  around  6%  across  the  FF/VI  groups  compared  with  3% in 
the  VI  25  group,  <1%  in  the  placebo  and  FF  groups.  However,  when  data  are  discussed  as  subjects 
with  an  event/1000  treatment  years,  the  FF/VI  200/25  group  has  the  worst  numbers  for  pneumonia 
(76.7  in  the  FF/VI  200/25  group  and  68.2  in  the  FF/VI  100/25  vs.  18  for  placebo).  For  severe 
pneumonia  32.5,  22.7  and  0,  respectively  have  been  reported  while  for  serious  pneumonia  the 
following have been reported: 33.8 for FF/VI 200/25 and 6 for placebo). Finally, the exposure-adjusted 
numbers of subjects with fatal pneumonia was 7.8 for FF/VI 200/25 versus 1.2 for FF/VI 100/25 and 0 
for the rest of groups. A potential similar effect on asthma patients for whom the FF/VI 200/25 dosage 
can be used, cannot be ruled out. However these analyses have methodological limitations: there was 
no pre-specified definition or adjudication of pneumonia cases and its severity. As a result, there may 
be  a  wide  variation  in  pneumonia  rates  and  potential  under-reporting  cannot  be  ruled  out.  The 
integrated  analyses  and  indirect  comparisons provided  are  of limited  validity, given  the differences in 
study populations, study durations and designs across studies.  To address this concern, in section 4.2 
of the SmPC it is stated that the highest strength is not indicated for the treatment of COPD and a a 
warning has been included in the SmPC and pneumonia is identified as an important risk in the RMP. In 
addition  the  CHMP  has  imposed  a  requirement  on  the  Applicant  to  conduct  two  post-authorisation 
safety studies comparing FF/VI with other ICS/LABA FDCs (as described in the RMP).

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Asthma  
In order to provide an adequate control of asthma the observed effect in terms of pulmonary function 
parameters should be complemented with control in symptoms and exacerbations.  
For FF/VI 100/25 statistically significant differences in change from baseline in trough FEV1 and mean 
FEV1  and  in  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  at  week  12  versus  placebo  were  observed  in  study 
HZA106827. Although the results failed to show statistically significant differences between FF/VI and 
FF  monotherapy  on  relevant  lung  function  parameters  and  small  but  clinically  relevant  effects  of  the 
FF/VI on symptomatic endpoints versus FF monotherapy were observed, the CHMP considered that the 
efficacy of the FF/VI 100/25 dose in asthma is well supported. Furthermore, the effects observed with 
FF/VI  100/25  dose  are  similar  to  the  one  obtained  with  other  LABA/ICS  combinations.  The  risk  of 
experiencing  a  severe  asthma  exacerbation  was  decreased  by  20%  compared  with  FF  100  alone 
(hazard ratio = 0.795, p = 0.036 95% CI (0.642; 0.985) and the rate of severe asthma exacerbations 
was decreased by 25% compared with FF 100 alone (P = 0.014). Although these reductions in absolute 
terms are small they were considered clinically relevant by the CHMP. 
For  FF/VI  200/25  statistically  significant  differences  in  the  two  co-primary  endpoints  change  from 
baseline  in  trough  FEV1  and  mean  FEV1  at  week  12  versus  FF  200  and  FP  1000  were  obtained.  In 
addition,  statistically  significant  differences  in  the  secondary  endpoint  rescue-free  24h  periods  versus 
FF 200 were also observed. The CHMP therefore considered that the efficacy of the FF/VI 200/25 dose 
in asthma is well supported. Furthermore, the effects observed with the FF/VI 200/25 dose are similar 
to the one obtained with other LABA/ICS combinations.  
Although  the  number  of  adolescents  and  patients  aged  >65  years  was  too  small  to  allow  statistical 
analysis for most treatment groups, in an integrated analysis a benefit of FF/VI over placebo and over 
FF  alone  in  trough  FEV1  was  seen  in  both  age  groups  at  Week  2,  Week  12  and  Week  24,  further 
supporting the CHMP’s acceptance of clinical efficacy for the asthma indication.  
COPD 
The  improvement  in  pulmonary  function  and  reduction  in  symptoms like exacerbations  and  dyspnoea 
are  key  targets  in  the  treatment  of  COPD,  while  pneumonia  is  the  main  serious  complication  of  ICS 
therapy in COPD.  
In  the  6-month  pivotal  studies,  for  FF/VI  100/25,  statistically  significant  improvements  in  the  co-
primary  endpoints  weighted  mean  FEV1  0-4  hours  at  Day  168  and  change  from  baseline  in  pre-dose 
trough  FEv1  at  D169  were  observed  versus  placebo  and  versus  FF  100  alone  but  not  versus  VI  25 
alone.  In  addition,although  there  was  a  lack  of  statistically  significant  effect  of  FF/VI  100/25  versus 
placebo in mean CRQ-SAS Dyspnoea Domain scores in both studies, a responder analysis for CRQ-SAS 
Dyspnea scores showed that the odds of being a responder was between 1.67 and 2.03 times greater 
with  FF/VI  100/25  than  with  placebo.  In  addition,  statistically  significant  improvements  with  FF/VI 
100/25  versus  placebo  for  the  secondary  endpoints  of  COPD  symptoms  scores  and  the  number  of 
night-time  awakenings  requiring  rescue  medication  (salbutamol),  while  a  post-hoc  analysis  of  total 
rescue-free  days  showed  that  FF/VI  100/25  provided  a  higher  percentage  of  salbutamol-free  days 
(19% and 14% difference versus placebo in study HZC112206 and in study HZC112207 respectively). 
Relvar Ellipta

EMA/282960/2013 
Page 274/279 
 
  
In  the  one-year  pivotal  studies,  treatment  with  FF/VI  100/25  provided  a  statistically  significant 
improvement  in  the  primary  endpoint  LS  mean  annual  rate  of  moderate  and  severe  exacerbations 
compared  with  VI  25  (between  21%  and  34%  reduction  in  each  of  the  studies).  There  was  a  lack  of 
dose-response  between  the  three  doses  of  FF/VI  studied  in  annual  rate  of  moderate/severe 
exacerbations  in  the  one-year  pivotal  studies,  with  a  differential  effect  of  the  FF/VI  200/25  dose  in 
each of the studies. For the secondary endpoint time to first exacerbation and moderate exacerbations 
requiring  treatment  with  oral/systemic  corticosteroids,  treatment  with  FF/VI  100/25  provided  a 
statistically  significant  reduction  versus  VI  25  alone  for  both  one-year  studies.  These  results  are 
consistent  with  those  observed  for  the  main  exacerbation  outcome.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the 
active  control  group  chosen  in  the  6-month  and  1-year  pivotal  studies  (VI  25  µg),  despite  not 
corresponding  to  a  LABA  currently  authorised  for  use  in  patients  with  COPD,  was  an  acceptable 
comparator, and that the 25 VI dose selected was appropriate. The CHMP therefore considered that the 
data  provided  by  the  Applicant  adequately  demonstrated  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  effect  of  FF/VI 
100/25 on COPD exacerbations.  
Although 6 fatal cases in the COPD studies and a higher incidence of pneumonia cases with the highest 
strength  in  the  asthma  studies  have  been  observed,  pneumonia  is  a  well  known  effect  of  ICSs.  To 
address  this  concern,  a  warning  has  been  included  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  and  pneumonia  is 
identified  as  an  important  risk  in  the  RMP.  In  addition  the  CHMP  has  imposed  a  requirement  on  the 
Applicant to conduct two post-authorisation interventional safety studies (one for the COPD and one for 
the  asthma  indication)  to  further  investigate  this  risk  of  pneumonia  with  FF/VI  compared  with  other 
ICS/LABA  FDCs  (as  described  in  the  RMP).  The  risk  of  pneumonia  will  be  further  characterized  in 
ongoing and planned studies as described in the RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The CHMP considers that the available data provides evidence of clinically relevant effects of the FF/VI 
FDC  in  the  treatment  of  asthma  and  COPD.  Therefore,  the  overall  benefit/risk  of  Relvar  Ellipta  is 
considered positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Asthma 
The effects observed on pulmonary function parameters and symptomatic endpoints with FF/VI 100/25 
and 200/25 are clinically relevant and consistent with the literature data available for clinical trials with 
other  approved  FDC  of  an  ICS  and  a  LABA  for  the  treatment  of  asthma.  Furthermore  the  effects 
observed  on  exacerbations  with  FF/VI  versus  FF  are  clinically  relevant,  and  in  line  with  the  literature 
data available for approved FDC of an ICS and a LABA. 
COPD 
The  improvements  observed  in  the  6  month-studies  on  pulmonary  function  parameters  symptomatic 
endpoints  with  FF/VI  100/2  are  considered  clinically  relevant  by  the  CHMP.  In  addition,  a  responder 
analysis  for  CRQ-SAS  Dyspnea  scores  showed  that  the  odds  of  being  a  responder  was  between  1.67 
and  2.03  times  greater  with  FF/VI  100/25  than  with  placebo.  Furthermore  statistically  significant 
improvements  with  FF/VI  100/25  versus  placebo  for  the  secondary  endpoints  of  COPD  symptoms 
scores  and  the  number  of  night-time  awakenings  requiring  rescue  medication  (salbutamol),  while  a 
post-hoc analysis of total rescue-free days showed that FF/VI 100/25 provided a higher percentage of 
salbutamol-free  days  (19%  and  14%  difference  versus  placebo  in  study  HZC112206  and  in  study 
HZC112207 respectively).

The  decrease  observed  in  the  one-year  studies  on  the  annual  rate  of  moderate  and  severe 
exacerbations with FF/VI 100/25 are considered clinically relevant by the CHMP. The CHMP considered 
that  the  active  control  group  chosen  in  the  6-month  and  one-year  pivotal  studies,  VI  25,  despite  not 
corresponding  to  a  LABA  currently  authorised  for  use  in  patients  with  COPD,  was  an  acceptable 
comparator, and that the 25 VI dose selected was appropriate.  
Although 6 fatal cases in the COPD studies and a higher incidence of pneumonia cases with the highest 
strength  in  the  asthma  studies  have  been  observed,  pneumonia  is  a  well  known  effect  of  ICSs.  To 
address  this  concern,  a  warning  has  been  included  in  the  SmPC  and  pneumonia  is  identified  as  an 
important  risk  in  the  RMP.  In  addition  the  CHMP  has  imposed  a  requirement  on  the  Applicant  to 
conduct  two  post-authorisation  safety  studies  comparing  FF/VI  with  other  ICS/LABA  FDCs  (as 
described in the RMP). 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by  majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Relvar Ellipta in: 
• 
• 
the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, where use 
of a combination product (long-acting beta 2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate: 
patients  not  adequately  controlled  with  inhaled  corticosteroids  and  “as  needed”  inhaled  short 
acting beta2-agonists). 
the symptomatic treatment of patients with COPD with a FEV1 <70% predicted normal (post-
bronchodilator) in patients with an exacerbation history despite regular bronchodilator therapy.  
is  favourable  and  therefore  recommends  the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  subject  to  the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
•  Periodic safety update reports  
The  marketing  authorisation  holder  shall  submit  the  first  periodic  safety  update  report  for  this 
product within six months following authorisation. Subsequently, the marketing authorisation holder 
shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in accordance with the requirements set 
out  in  the  list  of  Union  reference  dates  (EURD  list)  provided  for  under  Article  107c(7)  of  Directive 
2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal 
product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The  MAH  shall  perform  the  required  Pharmacovigilance  activities  and  interventions  detailed  in  the 
agreed  RMP  presented  in  Module  1.8.2  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  and  any  agreed  subsequent 
updates of the RMP.

An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result 
of an important (Pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
If  the  submission  of  a  PSUR  and  the  update  of  a  RMP  coincide,  they  can  be  submitted  at  the  same 
time. 
•  Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Description 
Submission of final clinical study report for the interventional post-authorisation safety 
study to further investigate the risk of pneumonia with Relvar Ellipta compared with 
other ICS/LABA FDC in the treatment of COPD, according to a protocol agreed by the 
Committee.  
Due date 
30 September 
2015  
Submission of final clinical study report for the interventional post-authorisation safety

the Committee 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
to be implemented by the Member States. 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  the  quality  properties  of  the  active  substance,  the  CHMP 
considers that vilanterol (as trifenatate) is qualified as a new active substance. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore,  the  CHMP  reviewed  the  available  paediatric  data  of  studies  subject  to  the  agreed 
Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  P/0049/2012  and  the  results  of  these  studies  are  reflected  in  the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
Divergent position to the majority recommendation is appended to this report.

Divergent Position 
The undersigned members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s opinion recommending the granting 
of a Marketing Authorisation for Relvar Ellipta for the following indications:  
Asthma Indication:  
Relvar Ellipta is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years 
and older, where use of a combination product (long-acting beta2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is 
appropriate: 
• 
patients  not  adequately  controlled  with  inhaled  corticosteroids  and  “as  needed”  inhaled  short 
acting beta2-agonists. 
COPD Indication:  
Relvar Ellipta is indicated for symptomatic treatment of adults with COPD with a FEV1 <70% predicted 
normal (post-bronchodilator) with an exacerbation history despite regular bronchodilator therapy.  
The reasons for divergent opinion were as follows: 
In  asthma,  the  superiority  of  the  fixed  dose  combination  (FDC)  to  the  mono  components  on 
bronchodilatory  effect  and  symptomatic  improvement  has  not  been  sufficiently  demonstrated 
(Guideline  on  Fixed  Combination  Medicinal  Products  (CPMP/EWP/240/95  Rev.  1)).  None  of  the  mono 
components  have  been  previously  approved  for  the  treatment  of  asthma,  and  non-inferiority  of  the 
FDC  compared  with  established  LABA/ICS  FDC  therapies,  or  superiority  of  the  FDC  compared  with 
established LABA or ICS mono therapies in asthma has not been proven.  
Regarding the COPD indication, no clear symptomatic benefit of the FDC versus placebo was apparent 
on  dyspnoea  scores,  and  the  chosen  active  comparator  (VI)  for  the  exacerbation  studies  is  not 
considered optimal as it is not an authorised LABA for the treatment of patients with COPD. Therefore, 
the magnitude of the symptomatic effect (dyspnoea, exacerbations) of the FDC in COPD is uncertain. 
The issue is hampered by the lack of comparisons with established COPD therapies.  
In relation to safety issues, the risk of pneumonia seems to be a common and serious adverse event, 
with 6 fatal cases of pneumonia observed in the COPD studies, which are of special concern. This risk 
cannot be fully characterized due to methodological limitations of the clinical studies with regard to the 
assessment of pneumonia.

1.  Introduction 
On  28  Aug  2021,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  risankizumab,  in  accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Risankizumab  is  a  fully  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  of  the  IgG1  subclass  directed  towards  IL-23 
p19  and  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis  in  adults  who  are  candidates  for 
systemic therapy. The MAH also submitted an extension of indication for treatment of active psoriatic 
arthritis (PsA) in adults (EMEA/H/C/004759/II/0014). 
The objective of Study M16-813 was to assess the safety and efficacy of risankizumab versus placebo 
for the treatment of moderate to severe Atopic dermatitis (AD) in adult and adolescent subjects 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Treatment  was  given  with  either  placebo  or  Risankizumab  (ABBV-066)  Solution  for  injection  in  pre-
filled syringe (PFS) 75 mg/0.83 mL (90 mg/mL) solution for injection.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final study report for:  
M16-813  A  Phase  2,  Multicenter,  Randomized,  Placebo-  Controlled,  Double-Blind  Study  to  Evaluate 
Risankizumab in Adult and Adolescent Subjects with Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study M16-813 
Description 
Study  M16-813  was  a  Phase  2,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  multicentre  study  to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of risankizumab for the treatment of moderate to severe AD in adult 
and  adolescent  subjects  with  onset  of  symptoms  at  least  2  years  before  the  Baseline  Visit.  The 
duration of the study was up to 65 weeks and included a screening period of up to 35 days, a 16-week 
double-blind  treatment  period  (Period  A),  a  36-week  double-blind treatment  period  (Period  B),  and  a 
safety phone call approximately 20 weeks after the last dose of study drug. The primary analysis was 
performed  when  all  subjects  completed  Week  16.  Eligible  subjects  were  randomized  at  Baseline  to 
receive  risankizumab  150  mg,  risankizumab  300  mg,  or  matching  placebo  (2:2:1,  respectively)  at 
Week  0  and  Week  4  of  Period  A.  In  Period  B,  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  were  re-randomized  at 
Week  16  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  receive  either  risankizumab  150  mg  or  300  mg  for  the  remainder  of  the 
study. Subjects originally randomized to risankizumab 150 mg or 300 mg in Period A stayed on their 
previously assigned treatment through the end of the study.

All subjects received risankizumab at the Week 16, Week 28, and Week 40 visits. The last visit to the 
study  site  occurred  at  Week  52.  Subjects  had  a  final  follow  up  call  20  weeks  after  the  last  dose 
administration.  During  Period  B,  subjects  with  less  than  50%  reduction  from  Baseline  in  the  Eczema 
Area and Severity Index (< EASI 50) were allowed to begin approved concomitant rescue treatment. 
Rescue treatment was limited to up to twice-daily application of topical corticosteroids. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The following primary and key secondary objectives were evaluated: 
• 
Primary  endpoint:  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  at  least  a  75%  reduction  from  Baseline  in 
EASI (EASI 75) at Week 16; 
•  Key  secondary  endpoint:  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  validated  Investigator  Global 
Assessment Scale for Atopic Dermatitis of "0" or "1" (on a 5-point scale) with a reduction from 
Baseline of ≥ 2 points at Week 16; 
•  Key  secondary  endpoint:  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  a  reduction  of  ≥  4  points  in  worst 
pruritus numerical rating scale from Baseline to Week 16. 
Study population /Sample size 
The  intent-to-treat  population  consisted  of  172  subjects  who  were  randomized  in  Study  M16-813.  All 
randomized subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug in Study M16-813. Of all subjects, 55.8% 
were male, 53.5% were white, and the median age was 42.5 years (14 years min and 83 years max 
age).  The  median  EASI  (overall  score)  at  Baseline  was  26.80  (range:  16.0,  72.0),  indicative  of  a 
population with moderate to severe AD disease activity. 
Key inclusion/exclusion criteria 
Eligible  subjects  were  adults  who  were  ≥  18  years  old  and,  where  locally  permissible  and  approved, 
adolescent subjects who were at least 12 years old. Subjects must have had: 
•  Diagnosis of AD with onset of symptoms at least 2 years prior to Baseline. 
•  Moderate to severe AD at the Baseline Visit, defined by Eczema Area and Severity Index ≥ 16, 
body surface area (BSA) ≥ 10%, and validated Investigator Global Assessment Scale for Atopic 
Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) score of ≥ 3. 
•  History of inadequate response to previous topical corticosteroid and/or topical calcineurin inhibitor 
treatments or a medical inability to receive these treatments. 
Subjects  with  prior  exposure  to  any  biologic  immunomodulatory  agent  or  Janus  kinase  inhibitor  were 
excluded  from  the  study.  Concurrent  treatment  with  systemic  therapy  that  can  also  be  used  for  the 
treatment  of  AD  (biologic or  non-biologic),  as  well  as  use  of  topical  and/or  phototherapy  treatments, 
was prohibited throughout the study. 
Treatments 
Period A (Baseline up to Week 16) 
Study  site  staff  administered  study  drug;  risankizumab  75  mg/0.83  mL  (90  mg/mL)  injected 
subcutaneously  (SC)  as  risankizumab  150  mg  (2  ×  75  mg  pre-filled  syringe  (PFS)  and  2  ×  placebo

Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity Endpoints 
Serum  risankizumab  concentrations,  anti-drug  antibodies  (ADA),  and  neutralizing  antibodies  (nAb) 
were determined from blood collected by venipuncture at scheduled visits. 
Statistical Methods 
Efficacy:  Pairwise  comparison  of  the  primary  endpoint  and  the  key  secondary  endpoints  was 
conducted between each risankizumab group (risankizumab 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively) versus 
the  placebo  group  using  the  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  test,  stratified  by  baseline  disease  severity 
(moderate [vIGA-AD 3] versus severe [vIGA-AD 4]). For the analysis of the primary endpoint and key 
secondary endpoints, non-responder imputation (NRI) with multiple imputation to handle missing data 
due to COVID-19 (NRI-C) was used as the primary approach. Efficacy data for subjects who switched 
to  rescue  medications  was  imputed  from  the  point  of  rescue  using  an  NRI  approach  for  the  primary 
endpoint and key secondary endpoints. 
Pharmacokinetics  and  Immunogenicity: Serum risankizumab concentrations were summarized at 
each sampling time point for each dose group using descriptive statistics. ADA titres were tabulated for

each subject at the respective study visits. The number and percentage of subjects with ADA and NAb 
were calculated by dose group. 
Safety:  All  safety  analyses  were  performed  on  the  Safety  Population  for  both  treatment  periods, 
respectively,  as  well  as  the  All  Risankizumab  Treated  population,  based  on  the  treatment  subjects 
actually received. Safety was assessed by AEs, laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG variables. Missing 
safety  data  was  not  imputed  for  safety  analysis.  AEs  were  coded  using  Medical  Dictionary  for 
Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA).  A  treatment-emergent  adverse  event  (TEAE)  was  defined  as  an  AE 
with onset or worsening on or after the first dose of study drug and within 140 days (20 weeks) after 
the last dose of study treatment injection. The number and percentage of subjects experiencing TEAEs 
was tabulated using MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred term, as well as by severity and 
by  relationship  to  the  study  drug  as  assessed  by  the  investigator.  Summaries  (i.e.,  number, 
percentages,  and  events  per  100  patient-years)  of  TEAEs,  SAEs,  deaths,  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation,  and  areas  of  safety  interest  were  provided.  Pre-treatment  AEs  were  summarized 
separately. 
For  laboratory  test  and  vital  signs  variables,  mean  change  from  baseline  and  percentage  of  subjects 
with  evaluations  meeting  criteria  for  pre-defined  Potentially  Clinically  Significant  values  were 
summarized. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 172 subjects were randomized in this study. Twenty-eight subjects (16.3%) discontinued the 
study  in  Period  A.  The  most  common  primary  reason  for  study  discontinuation  in  Period  A  was 
withdrawal of consent. Seventy-three subjects (50.7%) discontinued the study in Period B. The most 
common  primary  reason  for  study  discontinuation  in  Period  B  was  "other,"  including 43  subjects  who 
discontinued the study due to the early termination of the study by the Sponsor. Seventy-one subjects 
(49.3%) completed the study. 
Efficacy results 
A summary of the primary and key secondary endpoint results is presented in the table below.

Study M16-813 did not meet the primary endpoint, the proportion of subjects achieving at least a 75% 
reduction from Baseline in EASI (EASI 75) at Week 16 (table above). Neither risankizumab 150 mg nor 
risankizumab  300  mg  showed  a  statistically  significantly  greater  percentage  of  subjects  achieving  an 
EASI 75 response at Week 16 compared with the placebo group. 
CHMP comments 
The primary endpoint, the proportion of subjects achieving EASI 75 at Week 16, was not met. Neither 
risankizumab 150 mg nor risankizumab 300 mg showed a statistically significantly greater percentage 
of  subjects  achieving  an  EASI  75  response  at  Week 16  compared  with  the  placebo  group.  Secondary 
endpoints,  (the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  IGA-AD  of  "0"  or  "1"  (on  a  5-point  scale)  with  a 
reduction from Baseline of ≥ 2 points at Week 16 and the proportion of subjects achieving a reduction 
of ≥ 4 points in worst pruritus numerical rating scale from Baseline to Week 16) were also not met. The 
MAH has outlined that the indication of AD will not be further pursued. 
Pharmacokinetic Results 
A summary of risankizumab serum concentrations during study duration is presented in Table 4.

Immunogenicity of risankizumab was assessed using a 3-tiered approach. In this tiered approach, all 
ADA  samples  were  first  analysed  in  a  screening  assay  (Tier  1).  The  samples  that  were  screened 
positive  were  confirmed  in  the  confirmatory  assay  (Tier  2)  followed  by  the  titre  determination  step 
(Tier  3)  in  which  titres  were  determined  for  the  confirmed  positive  samples.  The  confirmed  positive 
samples  were  also  evaluated  in  the  NAb  assay  to  detect  the  presence  of  NAb.  Incidence  of  ADAs 
(treatment-emergent)  to  risankizumab  was  defined when  a  subject  was  (1)  ADA–negative or  missing 
assessment  at  Baseline  and  became  ADA-positive  at  1  or  more  time  points  post  Week  0  visit  in  this 
study, or (2) ADA-positive at Baseline and showed a 4-fold or greater increase in titer values relative 
to Baseline. 
The summary of treatment-emergent ADAs and NAbs to risankizumab in subjects who received at least 
1 dose of risankizumab during the study duration (52 weeks) is presented in Table 5.

As shown in Table 6, the geometric mean serum risankizumab concentrations in ADA-positive subjects 
appeared to be lower than that of ADA-negative subjects. Only 2 subjects developed NAb at Week 16 
and Week 52 in the risankizumab 150 mg treatment arm and 1 subject developed NAb at Week 16 in 
risankizumab  300  mg  treatment  arm,  resulting  in  risankizumab  exposures  within  the  range  of  NAb-
negative  subjects  in  the  same  treatment  arms.  Given  the  limited  number  of  subjects  who  developed 
ADA  and/or  NAb,  these data  should  be  interpreted with  caution.  None  of  the subjects  switching  from 
placebo  to  risankizumab  150  mg  SC  or  risankizumab  300  mg  SC  treatment  arms  at  Week  16 
developed ADA at Week 52. 
Similar proportions of ADA-positive and ADA-negative subjects achieved the primary efficacy endpoint 
in  the  risankizumab  150  mg  treatment  arm  (28.6%  versus  25.9%),  but  in  the  risankizumab  300  mg 
treatment  arm,  a  higher  proportion  of  ADA-positive  subjects  achieved  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint 
(42.9% vs. 20.7%) (Table 7). However, these data should be interpreted with caution due to the small 
number of subjects who developed ADA and NAb.

CHMP comments 
The incidence of the ADA and NAb to risankizumab in M16-813 across the study duration of weeks 0 to 
52 (ADAs in 10.9% or 15/138 of evaluable subjects and NAbs in 4 subjects (2.9%) is lower than those 
observed  in  phase  3  trials  which  made  up  the  plaque  psoriasis  development  programme  (where  the 
anti-drug  antibody  and  NAb  incidence  to  risankizumab  150mg  at  Week  0,  Week  4,  and  q12w 
thereafter) was 19% and 8%, respectively over 16 weeks duration (based on 1288 evaluable subjects) 
and 24% and 14% respectively over 52 weeks duration).  
Whereas  the  presence  of  neutralizing  antibodies  (NAb)  to  risankizumab  was  not  correlated  with 
risankizumab  clearance  in  the  psoriasis  programme,  the  risankizumab  concentrations  in  ADA-positive 
subjects  treated in  M16-813  appeared  to  be  lower  than that of  ADA-negative subjects  though  similar 
proportions  of  ADA-positive  and  ADA-negative  subjects  achieved  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  in  the 
risankizumab  150  mg  treatment  arm  (28.6%  versus  25.9%  and  in  fact  in  the  risankizumab  300  mg 
treatment  arm,  a  higher  proportion  of  ADA-positive  subjects  achieved  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint 
(42.9% vs. 20.7%). 
It is agreed however that the low numbers of subjects who developed ADA and/or Nab mean that all 
these  findings  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  and  the  impact  of  immunogenicity  on  risankizumab 
exposure and efficacy cannot be adequately assessed from these data.  
Safety results 
The  safety  population  in  Period  A  was  defined  as  all  subjects  who  were  randomized  at  baseline  and 
received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  drug  in  Treatment  Period  A.  The  safety  population  in  Period  B  was 
defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Treatment Period B. Subjects were 
assigned to a treatment group based on the treatment actually received. The All Risankizumab Treated 
population  consisted  of  all  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  risankizumab  in  the  study.  This 
population was used to provide a comprehensive summary of safety. Mean extent of exposure for the 
All Risankizumab Treated population was 272.4 days (SD, 104.76). 
A summary of Adverse Events experienced by patients in period A is presented below in Table 9.

Three subjects (8.8%) in the placebo group experienced SAEs; no SAEs were experienced by subjects 
in the risankizumab 150 mg or 300 mg treatment groups. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of 
study  drug  were  reported  in  4  subjects  (5.8%)  in  the  risankizumab  150  mg  treatment  group,  2 
subjects (2.9%) in the risankizumab 300 mg treatment group, and 7 subjects (20.6%) in the placebo 
group. There was 1 treatment-emergent death during Period A of a subject in the placebo group.

In  Period  B,  a  total  of  142  subjects  (13  subjects  in  the  placebo  to  risankizumab  150  mg  treatment 
group,  11  subjects  in  the  placebo  to  risankizumab  300  mg  treatment  group,  61  subjects  in  the 
risankizumab 150 mg treatment group, and 57 subjects in the risankizumab 300 mg treatment group) 
received at least one dose of study drug. Six subjects (46.2%) in the placebo/ risankizumab 150 mg 
treatment  group,  5  subjects  (45.5%)  in  the  placebo/  risankizumab  300  mg  treatment  group,  29 
subjects  (47.5%)  in  the  risankizumab  150  mg  treatment  group,  and  29  subjects  (50.9%)  in  the 
risankizumab  300  mg  treatment  group  experienced  at  least  1  AE.  Two  subjects  (15.4%)  in  the 
placebo/ risankizumab 150 mg treatment group, 2 subjects (18.2%) in the placebo/ risankizumab 300 
mg  treatment  group,  10  subjects  (16.4%)  in  the  risankizumab  150  mg  treatment  group,  and  3 
subjects  (5.3%)  in  the  risankizumab  300  mg  treatment  group  experienced  treatment-emergent  AEs 
with a reasonable possibility of being drug-related, as assessed by the investigator. No subjects in the 
placebo/  risankizumab  150  mg  treatment  group  or  the  placebo/  risankizumab  300  mg  treatment 
groups, 2 subjects (3.3%) in the risankizumab 150 mg treatment group, and 3 subjects (5.3%) in the 
risankizumab 300 mg treatment group experienced SAEs. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of 
study  drug  were  reported  in  2  subjects  (15.4%)  in  the  placebo/  risankizumab  150  mg  treatment 
group,  no  subjects  in  the  placebo/  risankizumab  300  mg  treatment  group,  2  subjects  (3.3%)  in  the

A  treatment-emergent  hypersensitivity  reaction  was  experienced  by  1  subject  (2.9%)  in  the  placebo 
group (dermatitis atopic) and no subjects receiving risankizumab treatment throughout this study. 
Infections 
In the All Risankizumab Treated population, 2 (1.2%) subjects experienced a treatment-emergent 
serious infection, with cellulitis being the only reported PT. No events of serious infection led to study 
drug  discontinuation.  In  the  All  Risankizumab  Treated  population,  2  (1.2%)  subjects  experienced  an 
opportunistic infection excluding TB and herpes zoster, with cellulitis and Kaposi's varicelliform eruption 
being the only reported PTs. No events in this category led to study drug discontinuation. 
Malignancies 
In  the  All  Risankizumab  Treated  population,  2  subjects  (2.4%)  experienced  at  least  1  treatment-
emergent  malignancy,  including  1  event  of  neoplasm  and  1  event  of  Bowen's  disease.  Neither  event 
was serious. Neither event in this category led to study drug discontinuation. 
Hepatic Events 
In  the  All  Risankizumab  Treated  population,  4  subjects  (2.5%)  experienced  at  least  1  treatment-
emergent hepatic event, with ALT increased being the most commonly reported (> 2 subjects) PT (3 
subjects;  1.9%).  None  of  the  events  were  serious.  No  events  in  this  category  led  to  study  drug 
discontinuation. 
Discussion on Paediatric Data 
Study  M16-813  enrolled  3  paediatric  patients.  The  first  paediatric  subject  was  randomized  to  receive 
risankizumab 150 mg. The subject completed all dosing up to the Week 28 visit and was discontinued 
when the study was terminated by the sponsor. There were no AEs reported for this subject. 
The  second  paediatric  subject  had  a  history  of  food  allergies  (allergic  to  peanuts  since  2015  and 
allergic  to  seafood  since  2010)  was  randomized  to  receive  risankizumab  300  mg.  The  subject  
completed  the  first  dose  of  study  drug.  On  Day  12  following  initial  drug  administration,  the  site 
reported that the subject experienced one non-serious allergic reaction event of moderate severity with 
symptoms of eye swelling, lip swelling, and swelling face, went to the emergency room, and received 
IV  fluids,  an  antihistamine  (diphenhydramine),  a  H2  receptor  antagonist  (famotidine),  and 
methylprednisolone to manage the symptoms. The subject claimed not to be exposed to either of the 
known allergens outlined in the medical history. The associated AE was considered by the investigator 
to  have  no  reasonable  possibility  of  being  related  to  study  drug.  The  subject  and    parent  decided  to 
discontinue  the  study  (i.e.,  withdrew  consent)  on  Day  31  after  3  failed  attempts  to  collect  blood 
samples and after given the option to continue study participation without receiving study drug. 
The third paediatric subject  was randomized to receive risankizumab 300 mg. The subject completed 
all  dosing up  to  the  Week  28  visit  and  withdrew  consent  to  continue  study  participation  on  Day  192. 
The  subject  specified  reason  of  withdrawn  consent  was  "not  satisfied  with  the  skin  condition."  There 
were no AEs reported for this subject. 
CHMP comments 
There were no SAEs experienced by subjects in the risankizumab 150 mg or 300 mg treatment groups 
during  the  blinded  period,  and  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  occurred  at  greater  frequency  in  the 
placebo group (reported in 4 subjects (5.8%) in the risankizumab 150 mg treatment group, 2 subjects 
(2.9%) in the risankizumab 300 mg treatment group, and 7 subjects (20.6%) in the placebo group). 
The  most  common  AEs  in  the  all  risankizumab  treated  population  were  in  line  with  the  known  safety 
profile/underlying diseased population and included AEs from infections and infestations SOC (28% of

150mg treated patients and 35% of 300mg treated patients), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
SOC  with  41.5%  of  150mg  treated  patients  and  35%  of  300mg  treated  patients  –  the  majority  of 
which  were  (a  worsening  of)  atopic  dermatitis  32.9%  nd  25%  respectively.  There  were  no  events  of 
note  for  the  important  potential  risks  of  MACE  and  Serious  hypersensitivity  reactions.  Serious 
infections occurred in 2 (1.2%) subjects with cellulitis being the only reported PT. No events of serious 
infection  led  to  study  drug  discontinuation.  In  the  All  Risankizumab  Treated  population,  2  (1.2%) 
subjects  experienced  an  opportunistic  infection  excluding  TB  and  herpes  zoster,  with  cellulitis  and 
Kaposi's  varicelliform  eruption  being  the  only  reported  PTs.  No  events  in  this  category  led  to  study 
drug  discontinuation.  In  the  All  Risankizumab  Treated  population,  2  subjects  (2.4%)  experienced  at 
least  1  treatment-emergent  malignancy,  including  1  event  of  neoplasm  and  1  event  of  Bowen's 
Disease. The data relating to paediatric patients does not provide any new safety concerns. 
Overall, it is agreed that no new safety signals have been identified. 
2.3.3.  Discussion clinical aspects. 
Study  M16-813  was  a  Phase  2,  multicenter,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind  study  to 
evaluate  risankizumab  in  adult  and  adolescent  subjects  with  moderate  to  severe  AD.  Of  the  172 
subjects randomized, 71 subjects (49.3%) completed the study. 
The primary endpoint, the proportion of subjects achieving EASI 75 at Week 16, was not met. Neither 
risankizumab 150 mg nor risankizumab 300 mg showed a statistically significantly greater percentage 
of  subjects  achieving  an  EASI  75  response  at  Week 16  compared  with  the  placebo  group. Secondary 
endpoints,  (the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  IGA-AD  of  "0"  or  "1"  (on  a  5-point  scale)  with  a 
reduction from Baseline of ≥ 2 points at Week 16 and the proportion of subjects achieving a reduction 
of ≥ 4 points in worst pruritus numerical rating scale from Baseline to Week 16) were also not met. The 
MAH has outlined that the indication of AD will not be further pursued. 
In  this  study  no  new  safety  signals  have  been  identified.  The  benefit-risk  profile  of  risankizumab 
remains  unchanged,  and  therefore  no  update  to  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  have  been 
proposed as a result of these data. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Study M16-813 was a Phase 2, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study 
evaluating  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Risankizumab  150  mg  and  300  mg  in  adult  and  adolescent 
subjects  with  moderate  to  severe  Atopic  Dermatitis  (AD).  This  study  failed  to  meet  primary  and 
secondary endpoints and based on the efficacy results, this Phase 2 AD study was discontinued. There 
were no new safety concerns identified that would impact ongoing trials for other indications.
